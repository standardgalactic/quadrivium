An Introduction to Group Theory

Preface
Preface
The success of Group Theory is impressive and extraordinary. It is, perhaps, the most powerful and 
influential branch of all Mathematics. Its influence is strongly felt in almost all scientific and artistic 
disciplines (in Music, in particular) and in Mathematics itself. Group Theory extracts the essential 
characteristics of diverse situations in which some type of symmetry or transformation appears. Given a 
non-empty set, a binary operation is defined on it such that certain axioms hold, that is, it possesses a 
structure (the group structure). The concept of structure, and the concepts related to structure such as 
isomorphism, play a decisive role in modern Mathematics.
The general theory of structures is a powerful tool. Whenever someone proves that his objects of study satisfy 
the axioms of a certain structure, he immediately obtains all the valid results of the theory for his objects. 
There is no need to prove each one of the results in particular. Indeed, it can be said that the structures 
allow the classification of the different branches of Mathematics (or even the different objects in Music (! )).
The present text is based on the book in Spanish “Teoría de Grupos: un primer curso” by Emilio 
Lluis-Puebla, published by the Sociedad Matemática Mexicana This new text contains the material that 
corresponds to a course on the subject that is offered in the Mathematics Department of the Facultad 
de Ciencias of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México plus optional introductory material for 
a basic course on Mathematical Music Theory.
This text follows the approach of other texts by Emilio Lluis-Puebla on Linear Algebra and Homological 
Algebra. A modern presentation is chosen, where the language of commutative diagrams and universal 
properties, so necessary in Modern Mathematics, in Physics and Computer Science, among other 
disciplines, is introduced.
This work consists of four chapters. Each section contains a series of problems that can be solved with 
creativity by using the content that is presented there; these problems form a fundamental part of the text. 
They also are designed with the objective of reinforcing students’ mathematical writing. Throughout the 
first three chapters, representative examples (that are not numbered) of applications of Group Theory to 
Mathematical Music Theory are included for students who already have some knowledge of Music Theory.
In chapter 4, elaborated by Mariana Montiel, the application of Group Theory to Music Theory is presented 
in detail. Some basic aspects of Mathematical Music Theory are explained and, in the process, some 
essential elements of both areas are given to readers with different backgrounds. For this reason, the 
examples follow from some of the outstanding theoretical aspects of the previous chapters; the musical 
terms are introduced as they are needed so that a reader without musical background can understand the 
essence of how Group Theory is used to explain certain pre-established musical relations. On the other 
hand, for the reader with knowledge of Music Theory only, this chapter provides concrete elements, as 
well as motivation, to begin to understand Group Theory.

Introduction
Introduction
Mathematics exist from the initial stages of human existence. Practically every human being is a 
mathematician in some sense, from those that use mathematics to those that discover and create new 
mathematics. Everybody is also, to a certain extent, a philosopher of mathematics. Indeed, everyone who 
measures, recognizes people or things, counts, or says “as clear as two plus two is four” are mathematicians 
or philosophers of mathematics. However, only a very small number of people specialize in creating, 
teaching, researching or popularizing mathematics.
Mathematics is a pillar and foundation of our civilization. From the first half of the XIX century, due to 
the progress in different areas, mathematical sciences were unified, and the name of “Mathematics” as 
a single discipline was justified. According to the philologist Arrigo Coen, mathema means “erudition”, 
manthánein is the infinitive “to learn”, the root mendh means, in the passive tense, “knowledge”. In other 
words, it is the relative to learning. In an implicit sense, Mathematics means “what is worth learning”. 
It is also said that Mathematics is “a science par excellence”.
However, it can also be said that there are very few people that posses correct and up-to-date information 
about the branches and sub-branches of Mathematics. Children and young adults of our time can have 
good approximated images of electrons, galaxies, black holes, the genetic code, etc. Nevertheless, they 
will find, with difficulty, mathematical concepts that go beyond the first half of the XIX century. This is 
due to the nature of mathematical concepts.
It is a very common belief that a mathematician is a person who carries out enormous sums of natural 
numbers during every day of his life. It is also true that people suppose that a mathematician knows 
how to add and multiply natural numbers at a great speed. If we think a little about the concepts that 
the majority of people have about mathematicians, we could reach the conclusion that mathematicians 
are not necessary, given that a pocket calculator can carry out this work.
When one asks “what is the difference between a mathematician and an accountant?”, it is considered 
equivalent to the question “what is the difference between x and x?”. That is, it is supposed that they do the 
same. If it is explained that only on rare occasions does a mathematician carry out sums or multiplications, 
it seems incredible. It also appears incredible that a great number of advanced mathematics texts will 
not usually use numbers bigger than 10, with the exception, perhaps, of the page numbers.

Introduction
During many years, the emphasis has been on teaching children to learn multiplication tables, on the 
calculation of enormous additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and square roots, but of very 
small numbers (as far as big numbers, the majority of people have little idea of their magnitude). After, as 
teenagers, those that could sum and multiply polynomials were considered geniuses by their classmates, 
in possession of a great mathematical talent and afterwords, if they were lucky, they were taught to add 
and multiply complex numbers.
It would seem, then, that a mathematician is a person that passes his life doing addition and multiplication 
(of small numbers), something like the person in charge of the banking aspect of a business. This 
impression exists in the majority of people. Nothing further than the truth. Mathematicians are not those 
who calculate or do arithmetic operations, but those who invent how to calculate or do operations. To 
do Mathematics is to imagine, to create, to reason.
To be able to count, it was somehow necessary to represent numbers, for example, with the fingers. Then 
the abacus embodied a step forward, although still tied to counting with the fingers, and is still used 
in some parts of the planet. Afterwards, the arithmetic machine that was invented by Pascal in 1642 
allowed people to carry out addition and subtraction through a very ingenious system of gears. Today, 
the pocket calculators allow us to carry out, in seconds, calculations that would have taken years to do 
before, and have also allowed us to get rid of the logarithm tables and the slide rule.
However, in general, the students and graduates of any area will respond to the question “what is the sum?”, 
or rather “what is addition?”, by shrugging their shoulders, in spite of having spent twelve years doing sums, 
and that the sum is a primitive concept. It is also common that when a child, or a young person or an adult 
with a professional degree confronts a problem, he does not know whether to add, subtract, multply or cry.
The concept of binary operation, or law of composition, is one of the oldest in Mathematics and goes 
back to the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians [B] who already had methods to calculate addition and 
multiplication of positive integers and positive rational numbers (remember that they did not use the 
number system that we use). However, as time went on, mathematicians realized that the most important 
aspects were not the tables for adding or multplying certain “numbers”, but the set itself and the binary 
operation defined on it. The binary operation, together with certain properties that must be satisfied, 
gave way to the fundamental concept of group.

Introduction
Historically, the concept of binary operation, or law of composition, was extended in two ways, in which 
we can only find a certain resemblance with the numerical cases of the Egyptians and Babylonians [B].
The first was by Gauss, when he studied quadratic forms with integer coefficients, and when he saw 
that the law of composition was compatible with particular equivalence classes. The second culminated 
in the concept of group, in the Theory of Substitutions (by means of the development of the ideas of 
Lagrange, Vandermonde and Gauss in the solution of algebraic equations). However, these ideas remained 
superficial, with Galois being the real pioneer of Group Theory when he reduced the study of algebraic 
equations to the study of the permutation groups associated to them.
The English mathematicians of the first half of the XIX century isolated the concept of law of composition 
and extended the area of Algebra by applying it to Logic (Boole), vectors and quaternions (Hamilton) 
and matrices (Cayley). By the end of the XIX century, Algebra was focused on the study of algebraic 
structures, leaving behind the interest for the applications of the solutions to numerical equations. This 
orientation gave way to three fundamental trends [B]:
(i) Number Theory, that emerged from the German mathematicians Dirichlet, Kummer, Kronecker, 
Dedekind and Hilbert, based on the work of Gauss. The concept of field was fundamental.
(ii) The creation of Linear Algebra in England by Sylvester, Clifford; in the United States by Pierce, Dickson, 
Wedderburn; and in Germany and France by Weirstrass, Dedekind, Frobenius, Molien, Laguerre, Cartan.

Introduction
(iii) Group Theory that, in the beginning, was focused on the study of permutation groups. It was 
Jordan who developed the work of Galois, Serret and other predessesors. He introduced the concept 
of homomorphism and was the first to study infinite groups. Later, Lie, Klein and Poincaré developed 
these studies considerably. Finally, it was seen that the fundamental and essential idea of group lay in 
its law of composition, or binary operation, and not in the nature of its objects.
The success of Group Theory is impressive and extraordinary. It suffices to mention its influence in 
almost all of Mathematics and in other areas of knowledge. The examples given in 1.1 could leave the 
non-mathematician perplex, with a false idea about the hobbies that mathematicians create, consisting 
of combining “numbers” in a strange perverse way. However, the examples considered in this section 
are vitally important for Number Theory (the number 3 can be replaced by any natural number n  – if 
n = 12 we obtain clock arithmetic – or by a prime number p, obtaining important concepts and results), 
for Group Theory itself (dihedral or symmetric groups) or for Music, in relation to the chromatic scale. 
By observing this, it can be seen that what really is done in Group Theory, is extract the essential aspects 
from these examples, that is, given a non-empty set, we define a binary operation on it, such that certain 
axioms, postulates or properties hold, in other words, they possess a structure (the group structure). 
There exist several concepts linked to that of structure, one of the most important being isomorphism.
The concept of structure and those concepts related to it, such as isomorphism, play a decisive role 
in contemporary Mathematics. The general theories of the important structures are very powerful 
tools. Whenever someone proves that his objects of study satisfy the axioms of a certain structure, he 
immediately obtains all the valid results of the theory for his objects. There is no need to prove each one 
of the results in particular. One use of structures and isomorphisms made in modern Mathematics is 
the classification of its different branches (the nature of the objects is not important, the essential aspect 
are their relations to each other).
In the Middle Ages, Mathematics was classified as Arithmetic, Music, Geo-metry and Astronomy, 
which composed the Quadrivium. Afterwards, and until the middle of the XIX century, the branches of 
Mathematics were distinguished by the objects they studied, for example, Arithmetic, Algebra, Analytic 
Geometry, Analysis, with some subdivisions. It was as if we said that, given that bats and eagles fly, they 
must both be birds. We now can see beyond the surface and extract the underlying structures from the 
mere appearance.
Currently there are 63 branches of mathematics with over 5000 sub-classifica-tions. Among them are 
Algebraic Topology (composite structures), Homological Algebra (purification of the interaction between 
Algebra and Topology, created in the fifties), and Algebraic K-Theory (one of the most recent branches, 
created in the seventies).

An Introduction to Group Theory

Introduction
The idea of the connection between Mathematics and Music has been present historically and the scope 
of this connection has been broadened significatively since it was made explicit, for the first time, by 
Pythagoras of Samos. Chapter 4 presents a facet of the modern development of Mathematical Music 
Theory, based in its transformational nature. In this context, Group Theory plays the role of protagonist.
The foundations of this application can be attributed, in particular, to David Lewin, who developed 
Transformational Theory and gave rise to a new form of music theory, designed for the analysis of 
modern music. This new theory is known as Neo-Riemannian Theory.
Neo-Riemannian Theory is inspired in the work of the German musical theorist Hugo Riemann, who 
contributed to the effort to establish relations between tones and intervals. The need of this change arose 
from the industrial, political and social changes that ocurred during the XIX century. It was i­ne­vitable 
that they would exercise an important effect on the music of that time, and these changes were frequently 
expressed by means of bold modulations, innovative chord progressions, dissonance and resolutions and, 
in general, much less preparation for abrupt changes. These radical transformations gave rise, in music, 
to postromanticism and, finally, to atonality. Naturally, tonal theory in music could not explain these 
developments, and new tools had to be contructed to analyze and explain the evolution of this music; 
thus the birth of Neo-Riemannian Theory.
While Riemann was fundamentally interested in substituting the existing system of chord labelling and 
musical events at the time, Lewin saw the potential of these labels to describe the movement between 
these musical events. Lewin’s work takes form in his extensive contribution to the definition of the 
operations that describe musical movement (that is,Transformational Theory) and, going even further, 
he applied Group Theory to Music. These sets of transformation not only form groups, but they are 
isomophic to each other and to the dihedral group. What’s more, they satisfy several properties that 
allow us to conclude that duality exists.
Some people think that Mathematics is only a game that interests the intellect in a detached, cold way. 
Poincaré affirmed that this way of thinking does not take into account the sensation of mathematical 
beauty, of the harmony of numbers and shapes, as well as geometric elegance. There is, certainly, a 
sensation of aesthetic pleasure that every real mathematician has felt and, of course, belongs to the 
category of sensitive emotions. The beauty and elegance of Mathematics consists of all the elements 
harmonically displayed such that our mind can embrace their totality while maintaining, at the same 
time, their details.
This harmony, continues Poincaré, is an immediate satisfaction of our aesthetic needs, and a help that 
sustains and guides the mind. At the same time, by placing an ordered totality in our sight, we can make 
out a mathematical law, or truth. This is the aesthetic sensitivity that plays the role of a delicate filter, 
which, Poincaré concludes, explains why the person that does not have will never be a true creator.
For the authors of this text, Mathematics is one of the Fine Arts, the purest of them, that has the gift of 
being the most precise, and the precision of the Sciences.

1.1	
Binary Operations
In this section we present one of the oldest concepts in Mathematics, the binary operation or law of 
composition. We will also see to what extent certain “popular sayings”, for example “as clear as two plus 
two is four” and “the order of the factors does not change the product”, are true.
We will review some elementary concepts.
First, recall the set of integers.
Z = {... −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
Second, ask yourself: – how are two sets “properly” related”? Let A  and B  be two arbitrary sets. We say 
that f : A −→B  is a function of A  to B  if, to each element of A, we associate a unique element of B.
For example, if A = {a, b, c}  and B = {p, q, r, s}  then f : A −→B  given by the following 
association

is not a function, given that we do not associate to an object A  a unique element of B , ( p  and q  
are associated to a ). The sets A  and B  are called, respectively, the domain and the codomain of the 
function f .
The subset of the codomain that consists of those elements associated to the domain is called the range 
of f . Thus, in the previous function, the range of f  is the set {p, q, r} ; the element s  of B  is not 
in the range of f, that is, it is not the image of any element of A  under f .
We use the following notation to denote the images of the elements of A  under f :

Third: consider the Cartesian product of a set A, denoted by A × A,  that consists of all ordered pairs 
of elements of A , that is,
A × A = {(a, b)|a, b ∈A}
Now we can define the important concept of binary operation, or law of composition. Let G  be a non-
empty set. A binary operation or law of composition on G is a function f : G × G −→G  where 
(x, y) −→f(x, y).
It is obvious that we can denote a function with any symbol, for example f, g, h, ♦, ▲, ♣, ♥, ×, ⊗, ∗, 
etc. Hence, in Z , we can have a binary operation

Binary Operations
and, by abuse or convenience of notation, we can denote f(x, y) as xfy . For example, 
(3, 2) −→f(3, 2) = 3f2.
If the binary operation f  is denoted as + (the usual sum in Z ) then (3, 2) −→+(3, 2) = 3 + 2 
is equal to 5. If the binary operation f  is denoted as ·  (the usual multiplication in Z ), then 
(3, 2) −→·(3, 2) = 3 · 2 is equal to 6. Observe that a binary operation is defined on a non-empty 
set G .
1.1 Example. Define a set in the following way: consider three boxes and distribute the integers in each 
box in an ordered way:
We will denote the boxes as follows: the first one as [0] because it contains zero, (or 0 + 3Z , that is, the 
multiples of 3), the second [1] because it contains the number one (or 1 + 3Z , that is, all multples of 
3 plus 1), and the third box [2] because it contains the number two (or 2 + 3Z , that is, all multiples 
of 3 plus 2). We will assign the number 0 to the box [0], because its elements have a remainder of 0 
when divided by 3; analogously, we assign the number 1 to the box [1], and the number 2 to the box 
[2] , given that their elements have remainders 1 and 2 respectively when divided by 3. Consider the set 
Z3 = {0, 1, 2}  called the complete set of remainders module 3, because when dividing by 3 we get 
remainders 0, 1 or 2. Define a binary operation that could be denoted by f, g, h, ♦, ▲, ♣, ♥, ×, ⊗, ∗, 
etc; we choose +. Thus, 
+ : Z3 × Z3 −→Z3

 Figure 1.1: The chromatic scale
 Figure 1.2: The C major (left) and F major (right) scales
Example. In Mathematical Music Theory it is very useful to interpret the chromatic equal tempered 
scale (figure 1.1) as the group Z12, with the associations 
F :$ 3> F` :$ 4> G :$ 5> G` :$ 6>
H :$ 7> I :$ 8> I` :$ 9> J :$ :>
J` :$ ;> D :$ <> D` :$ 43> E :$ 44>
if we are interested in the pitch of a note1 without taking into account the octave2 in which it is found.
This way it is easy to transpose melodies, scales or chords. For example, the C-major scale 
{C, D, E, F, G, A, B} = {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11}  can be transposed to the scale of F-major (figure ?) by 
adding 5 to each note. Explicitly, we have

Binary Operations
It is common to hear the saying “as clear as two plus two is four”. However, as we have seen in the 
previous examples, 2 + 2 = 1, 2 + 1 = 0, 2·3 = 1, 3·4 = 2, etc. and clearly 2 + 2 ̸= 4. In the 
previous examples we have considered the sets Z3 and Z5 on which we have defined a “sum” or binary 
operation. The usual sum in the natural and integer numbers is a binary operation, as is the multiplication 
defined on these sets. These are the binary operations considered in the saying. In the first years of school 
a special emphasis is made on the algorithms for adding and multiplying natural numbers (i.e. in the 
procedure or manner of adding and multplying these numbers). After several years emphasis is made 
on adding and multiplying integers, and on multiplying and dividing polynomials. In general, when one 
“adds”, the set on which the binary operation is defined must always be specified.
It is also common to hear the saying that “the order of the factors does not change the product”. Will 
this always be true? 
1.3 Example. Consider the set ∆3 of the rigid movements of the equilateral triangle with vertices 
A, B, C, that is, the rotations about the baricenters of 0◦, 120◦ and 240◦ and the reflections about 
the medians. Denote these rigid movements in the following way:
0 = [ABC/ABC], 1 = [ABC/BCA], 2 = [ABC/CAB]
3 = [ABC/ACB], 4 = [ABC/CBA], 5 = [ABC/BAC]
The elements 0, 1 and 2 correspond to the rotations. The elements 3, 4 and 5 correspond to the 
reflections. Define a binary operation ◦ on ∆3:
◦:
∆3 × ∆3
−→
∆3
(x, y)
−→
◦(x, y) = x ◦y
Calculate:
[ABC/BCA] ◦[ABC/BCA] = [ABC/CAB]
that is
(1, 1)−→◦(1, 1) = 1◦1 = 2.
[ABC/CAB] ◦[ABC/ACB] = [ABC/BAC]
that is
(2, 3)−→◦(2, 3) = 2 ◦3 = 5.
[ABC/ACB] ◦[ABC/CAB] = [ABC/CBA]
that is
(3, 2)−→◦(3, 2) = 3 ◦2 = 4.
Observe that 
2 ◦3 ̸= 3 ◦2.
Now, 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 ◦3 = 3 ◦2?

Binary Operations
The concept of binary operation, or law of composition, is one of the oldest in Mathematics and goes 
back to the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians who already had methods to calculate addition and 
multiplication of positive integers and positive rational numbers (recall that they did not use the number 
system that we use). However, as time went on, mathematicians realized that the most important aspects 
were not the tables for adding or multiplying certain “numbers”, but the set itself and the binary operation 
defined on it. The binary operation, together with certain properties that must be satisfied, gave way to 
the fundamental concept of group.
We will say, in an informal manner that later on we will make precise, that a group is a non-empty set 
G  together with a binary operation f : G × G −→G , denoted (G, f) which is associative, has an 
identity element and each member of the set has an inverse. The image of (x, y) in G  will be denoted 
(x, y) −→f(x, y). By abuse, or convenience of notation we will denote f(x, y) as xfy  and call it 
the composition of x  and y .
It is easy to show (see the problems below) that the sets Z3, Z5 and ∆3 with their respective binary 
operation, have a group structure. As can be seen in the case of (∆3, ◦), the group concept is closely 
linked to the concept of symmetry. The previous examples show some sets that posees a group structure, 
and how varied these can be.

Binary Operations
We can define functions f : G −→G , g : G2 = G × G −→G , h : G × G × G −→G  or 
j : Gn = G × ... × G −→G  producing unary operations, binary, ternary or n -ary. The null 
operation is the function i : {e} −→G .
An algebraic structure or algebraic system is a set C  together with one or more n-ary operations. In 
the following section we will define some of them.
1.4 Definition. Consider H , a subset of a group (G, ◦). We say that H  es stable or closed with respect 
to the binary operation if x ◦y ∈H, for all elements x, y ∈H . Observe that the restriction of ◦ to 
a stable or closed subset H  provides a binary operation for H  called the induced binary operation.
Problems
1.1 Construct a table that represents the multiplication of all the elements of Z3.
1.2 Construct a table that represents the sum of all the elements of Z5.
1.3 Construct a table that represents the multiplication of all the elements of Z5.
1.4 Show that ∆3 with the binary operation defined in the Example 1.3 is a group.
1.5 Let Σ3 be the set of all the permutations of 1, 2, 3. Calculate the number of elements in Σ3. Define 
a binary operation on Σ3 and construct its table.
1.6 Let Σn be the set of all permutations of a set with n  elements. Calculate the number of elements 
of Σn.
1.7 Construct a table that represents the sum of all the elements of Z6 and compare it with the tables 
Σ3 and ∆3. Observe that the tables of Σ3 and ∆3 are the same, except for the names and order 
of the elements. Show that these last two are groups and establish a bijective function between their 
elements. Observe that the table for Z6 allows you to show that it is a group, but that it is totally 
different from the other two.

Algebraic Structures
In this section we will define several algebraic structures, some of which already have been implicitly 
studied. The idea is to present a brief panorama of some of the algebraic structures (not the specific 
study of the category of groups), thereby situating the reader in a better position to understand the objects 
of study of Group Theory. We will suppose that the reader knows the foundations of Linear Algebra as 
in [Ll2] and we will use the same notation as used in that source.
Let (V, +, µ) be a vector space over a field K , as is defined in Linear Algebra. If we eliminate the 
scalar multiplication µ  what remains is a set with a binary operation +, in which the four usual axioms 
hold. Then we say that (V, +) is a commutative group under +. Formally, with this notation and in 
this context (in the next section we will give another, more general, definition of group) we repeat the 
definition of group given in the previous section, to connect it with the study of vector spaces.
2.1 Definition. A group is a pair (G, +) where G  is a non-empty set and 
+: G × G →G
is a binary operation 
(u, v) −→+(u, v)
and where, by convenience or abuse of notation we write 
+(u, v) = u + v
such that
1.	 +(+(u, v), w) = +(u, +(v, w)), that is, (u + v) + w = u + (v + w)
2.	 there exists an element O ∈G , called the identity element, such that 
+(v, O) = v + O = v
3.	 for every v ∈G  there exists an element, called inverse, denoted by −v , such that 
+(v, −v) = v + (−v) = O .
We say that a group is commutative if it also satisfies
4.	  +(u, v) = +(v, u) that is, u + v = v + u .
If in the previous definition we consider a set E  with a binary operation + where none of the conditions 
hold, we say that (E, +) is a magma (or grupoid).

If in the previous definition we consider a set S  with a binary operation + where (i) holds, we say that 
(S, +) is a semigroup.
If in definition 2.1 we also consider a set M  with a binary operation + in which (i) and (ii) hold, we 
say that (M, +) is a monoid.
2.2 Example. The set N  of natural numbers with the usual sum is a semigroup but not a monoid because 
it has no identity element. (Z, +) and (Zn, +) (with n ∈N ) are commutative monoids under the 
“sum” and (N, ·), (Z, ·) and (Zn, ·) are “multiplicative” monoids..
2.3 Example. The reader can prove that (Z, +), (nZ, +), n ∈Z , (Q, +), (Q∗= Q −{0}, ·), 
(R, +), (R∗= R −{0}, ·), (C, +), (C∗= C −{0}, ·), (Zn, +), (∆3, ◦), (Σ3, ◦), (Σn, ◦), 
(MnK, +), where MnK  denotes the square matrices with n × n  coefficients in a field K , (GLnK, +) 
and (GLnK, ·), where GLnK  denotes the square invertible matrices of dimension n × n  (n ∈N ) 
with coefficients in a field K , are groups (with the usual binary operations in each one of them).
Example. Composers frequently take a theme and apply different symmetries to it, to give variety to a 
musical creation.

Algebraic Structures
Three common procedures are the inversion (Is ) respect to the pitch s , the retrograde (R ) and the 
retrograde with inversion (RIs ). To fix ideas we define, provisionally, an n -motive as a sequence 
{xi}n
i=1 with xi ∈Z12 for evey i  (taking into account the identification that we saw in the previous 
section). We denote as T (n) the set of all n -motives. We define the inversion, the retrogadation and 
the retrograde with inversion as 
Is : T (n) →T (n),
{xi}n
i=1 →{yi = 2s −xi}n
i=1,
R : T (n) →T (n),
{xi}n
i=1 →{yi = xn−i+1}n
i=1,
and 
RIs : T (n) →T (n),
{xi}n
i=1 →{yi = 2s −xn−i+1}n
i=1.
Let s  be a fixed pitch in the equal-tempered scale and {xi}n
i=1 ∈T (n). We see that 
Is ◦Is({xi}n
i=1) = Is(yi = {2s −xi}n
i=1)
= {wi = 2s −(2s −xi)}n
i=1
= {wi = 2s −2s + xi}n
i=1
= {wi = xi}n
i=1 = {xi}n
i=1,
that is, Is ◦Is = idT (n). In a similar way 
R ◦R({xi}n
i=1) = R({yi = xn−i+1}n
i=1)
= {wi = yn−i+1}n
i=1
= {wi = xn−(n−i+1)+1)}n
i=1
= {wi = xn−n+i−1+1}n
i=1
= {wi = xi}n
i=1 = {xi}n
i=1
which indicates that R ◦R = idT (n). Finally, 
Is ◦R({xi}n
i=1) = Is({yi = xn−i+1}n
i=1)
= {wi = 2s −yi}n
i=1
= {wi = 2s −xn−i+1}n
i=1 = IRs
= {wi = yn−i+1}n
i=1
= R({yi = 2s −xi}n
i=1) = R ◦Is({xi}n
i=1)

from where it can be concluded that 
Is ◦R = IRs = R ◦Is,
and also implies that 
IRs ◦IRs = (R ◦Is) ◦(Is ◦R)
= R ◦(Is ◦(Is ◦R))
= R ◦((Is ◦Is) ◦R)
= R ◦(idT (n) ◦R)
= R ◦R
= idT (n).
the previous development shows that the composition of functions, when restricted to the subset 
ST s = {Is, R, IRs, idT (n)}
of the set of transformations of T (n) to itself is closed. As the composition of functions is associative, 
it can be seen that (ST s, ◦) is a group, whose identity is idT (n) and the inverses of Is , R  and IRs  
are themselves.
For example, we can take the 5-motive 
{x1 = A = 9, x2 = G = 7, x3 = F = 5, x4 = E = 4, x5 = G = 7}
that appears in the 29th bar of Fugue 6 in D minor from the first book of “Das Wohltemperierte Klavier” 
by J.S. Bach. If we invert it respect to the pitch G = 7 (recalling that 2 · 7 = 14 = 2), obtenemos 
i|4 @ 5  {4 @ 8> |5 @ 5  {5 @ :>
|6 @ 5  {6 @ <> |7 @ 5  {7 @ 43> |8 @ 5  {8 @ :j
which is 
{y1 = F, y2 = G, y3 = A, y4 = B♭, y5 = G};
and is found in bar 33.

If we use retrogade, the resulting motive is {y1 = G, y2 = E, y3 = F, y4 = G, y5 = A}  (it is just 
the original, but backwards) that appears between bars 7 and 8. If we apply a retrograde with inversion 
we obtain {y1 = G, y2 = B♭, y3 = A, y4 = G, y5 = F}. A transposition of this set is seen in bar 36 
of the work.
 Figure 1.3: Motive with symmetries
 Figure 1.4: Geometric representation of the symmetries
The transformations of the motive can be seen in the figure 1.3, where a) is the original motive b) is its 
inversion with respect to G, c) is its retrograde and d) is its retrograde with inversion with respect to G. 
A more geometric presentation of Bach’s motives is seen in the figure 1.4.
Recall that we denote the binary operation on a set with any symbol, for example +, ∗, ◦, ⋄, ⋆, θ, •, △, 
etc, which is what we will do from here on. We say the the order of a group (G, ·) is the number of 
elements of the set G  and we will denote it with o(G) or with |G|  sim:vGv indistinctly. Thus, the 
ways to write this are, for example: (Zn, +) has order n , o(∆3, ◦) = 6, |Σ3| = 6, o(Σn) = n!. If 
|G|  is infinite (finite) we say that G  es infinite (finite). Then, Z  is infinite (forms an infinite group 
under the usual sum).
To relate two groups it is necessary to define a function that preserves the group structure.

2.4 Definition. Let (G, ⋄) and (G′, ⋆)  be two groups. A homomorphism of groups is a function 
f : G →G′  such that f(u ⋄v) = f(u) ⋆f(v).
Example. Consider the set of functions 
T = {et : t ∈Z12}
where we define 
et : Z12 →Z12,
a →a + t.
Then (T, ◦) is a group, where ◦ is the composition of functions. This group is isomorphic to (Z12, +), 
under the isomorphism 
φ : Z12 →T,
x →ex.
Indeed, 
φ(x + y) = ex+y = ex ◦ey = φ(x) ◦φ(y);

we leave it to the reader to show that φ  is bijective and that its inverse is also a homomorphism.
From the musical point of view, T  is the group of all transpositions, and this shows that it is isomorphic 
to the equal tempered chromatic scale. For more details about transpositions, see chapter 4, section 4.2. 
Now, we will recall the definition of action and define the concept of a group with operators:
2.5 Definition. Let Ω and A  be two sets. An action of Ω on A  is a function of Ω× A  on the set A .
2.6 Definition. Let Ω be a set. A group (G, ·) together with an action on Ω in (G, ·)
◦: Ω× G
−→
G,
(α, x)
→
◦(α, x) = α ◦x = xα,
that is distributive with respect to the composition law of (G, ·) is called a group with operators in Ω.
Example. Let GL(Z12) = {1, 5, 7, 11} ⊆Z12 (the elements of Z12 with multiplicative inverse). If 
G = (Z12, +), then by defining the action 
◦: GL(Z12) × Z12 →Z12
(u, x) →ux
we get Z12 as a group with operators on GL(Z12). Indeed, 
◦(u, x + y) = u(x + y) = ux + uy = ◦(u, x) + ◦(u, y).
The set of operators is, in fact, a group under multiplication in Z12. Recall that Z12 can be interpreted as 
the equal tempered scale modulo octaves and, for this reason, these operators are very important. They 
can be used to classify chords, scales or motives, by considering those that are transformed according 
to GL(Z12) as equivalent, and this has musical meaning. For example, if 11 ∈GL(Z12) acts on Z12 
it inverts the pitches, a very useful operation in counterpoint and in the manipulation of motives.
The distributive law can be expressed as 
(xy)α = xαyα
i.e., 
(α, xy) −→◦(α, xy) = α ◦(xy) = (α ◦x)(α ◦y).

2.7 Observation. In a group G  with operators in Ω, each element of Ω (called operator) defines an 
endomorphism (i.e. a homomorphism from G −→G ) of the group G . Considere Ω= Z  and for 
x ∈G , n ∈Z  define 
◦: Z × G
−→
G,
(n, x)
→
n ◦x = xn.
If G  is abelian, we have 
n(xy) = (xy)n = xnyn = (nx)(ny).
Hence, every abelian group G  can be seen as a group with operators in Z.
2.8 Definition. A ring is a triple (Λ, +, ·) where Λ is a set, + and ·  are binary operations such that
1.	 (Λ, +) is a commutative group,
2.	 (Λ, ·) is a semigroup,
3.	 u(v + w) = uv + uw  and (u + v)w = uw + vw .
The reader can show that (Z, +, ·), (Zn, +, ·),(Q, +, ·), (R, +, ·),  
(MnK, +, ·), (K, +, ·),(K[x], +, ·), (C, +, ·) are rings.
If a ring (Λ, +, ·) satisfies:
4.	 (Λ, ·) is a commutative semigroup, then (Λ, +, ·) is called a commutative ring.
If (Λ, ·) is monoid, we say that (Λ, +, ·) is a ring with identity or a unit ring.
Recall that if the product of two elements different from zero of a ring Λ yields the zero element of the 
ring, then these two elements are caller zero divisors. If the ring (∆, +, ·) with 1 ̸= 0 does not have 
zero divisors, it is called an integral domain. If an integral domain has a multiplicative inverse for every 
non-zero element, it is called a division ring.
Finally, a field is a commutative division ring.
How do we relate two rings? Through functions that preserve the ring structure. If (Λ, ⋄, ⋆) and 
(Λ′, +, ·) are rings, a ring homomorphism is a function that is a homomorphism on the commutative 
group of Λ into the commutative group of Λ′  and that is also a homomorphism of semigroups of Λ 
into semigroups of Λ′ , that is,
f(u ⋄v) = f(u) + f(v) and f(u ⋆v) = f(u) · f(v).

Algebraic Structures
If we consider a commutative ring with identity, (Λ, +, ·), instead of a field K,  when defining a 
vector space, we obtain an algebraic structure called a (left) Λ-module. Then, as a particular case of the 
Λ-modules we have the K-modules, i.e. the vector spaces over a field K.
Many of the results for vector spaces are valid for Λ-modules, it is enough to take K = Λ, a commutative 
ring with an identity element. In particular, we relate two Λ-modules by means of a homomorphism of 
Λ-modules. Λ-modules are generalizations of the concepts of commutative group and vector space, and 
they are the objects of study of Homological Algebra (see [Ll1]). Imitating vector spaces, if a Λ-modules 
has a basis, we call it a free Λ-module. Not every Λ-modules has a basis, that is, not every Λ-modules 
is free, but every vector space or K-module is free, that is, it has a basis. We say that a Λ-modules is 
projective if it is the sumand of the direct sum of a free module, and it is finitely generated if it has a 
finite set of generators.
Example. The cartesian product I = Z12 × Z12 can be seen as the set of all equal tempered counterpoint 
intervals: the first component represents the “base” pitch of the interval and the second its “length”. For 
example, the pair (0, 0) represents the zero interval (or octave, there is no difference) with base pitch 
C, whereas the pair (2, 7) represents an ascending fifth over D (or, also, a descending fourth over D)3.

We can define a sum on this set 
+ : I × I →I,
((a, b), (c, d)) →(a + c, b + d).
and a multiplication by a scalar 
· : Z12 × I →I,
(k, (c, d)) →(kc, kd).
that converts it into a Z12-module. These operations have a musicological meaning. For example, 
multiplication by the scalar −1 = 11 ∈Z12 is equivalent to inverting the intervals and reflecting the 
base point with respect to the pitch C. To sum (c, 0) to any element of the form (a, b) is equivalent to 
transposing the base pitch a  by c  units, but preserving the distance of the interval. Such procedures 
are common in counterpoint. 
An algebra over Λ (Λ is a commutative ring with identity) is a set A that is simultaneously a ring 
and a Λ-module. T﻿hat is, an algebra (A, +, µ, ·) is a Λ-module with another binary operation called 
multiplicación with the extra condition that makes the binary operation and the scalar multiplication 
compatible, which is the following:
(λu + λ′v)w = λ(uw) + λ′(vw)
 w(λu + λ′v) = λ(wu) + λ′(wv)	
for λ, λ′ ∈Λ; u, v, w ∈A
In particular we see that (λu)v = λ(uv) = u(λv), thus λuv  is a well defined element of A. We leave 
it to the reader to provide the definition of a homorphism of algebras, and to recognize several examples 
of well known algebras that have been implicitly introduced.
Example. We can define a multiplication on I  in the following way: 
∗: I × I →I,
((a, b), (c, d)) →(ac, ad + bc).
This way (I, +, ·, ∗) is transformed into an algebra on Z12 because, on the one hand, 
((a, b) + (c, d)) ∗(u, v) = (a + c, b + d) ∗(u, v)
= ((a + c)u, (a + c)v + (b + d)u)
= (au + cu, av + cv + bu + du)
= (au, av + bu) + (cu, cv + du)
= (a, b) ∗(u, v) + (c, d) ∗(u, v),

and, on the other 
(u, v) ∗((a, b) + (c, d)) = (u, v) ∗(a + c, b + d)
= (u(a + c), u(b + d) + v(a + c))
= (ua + uc, ub + ud + va + vc)
= (ua, va + ub) + (uc, ud + cv)
= (u, v)(a, b) + (u, v)(c, d)
Figure 1.5: Multiplication of the descending interval ((2, 7),−) by (−1, 2) to obtain ((10, 9),+).
and also 
(k · (a, b)) ∗(u, v) = (ka, kb) ∗(u, v)
= (kau, kav + kbu)
= k(au, av + bu) = k · ((a, b) ∗(u, v)).
This multiplication is meaningful from the musicological point of view. To show why, we first define 
the functions 
α+ : I →Z12,
(x, y) →x + y,
and 
α−: I →Z12,
(x, y) →x −y.
Given a counterpoint interval (x, y) ∈I , the functions α+ and α− allow us to recover the “ endpoint” 
of the interval, depending on the orientation. For example, if ((7, 7), +) is the ascending fifth over G, 
we can obtain the “endpoint” by summing the “length” of the interval to the base pitch. 
α+(7, 7) = 7 + 7 = 2

that is, the pitch D. Now, if ((2, 7), −) is the descending fifth over D, the “endpoint” results from 
subtracting the “length” of the interval from the base pitch. 
α−(2, 7) = 2 −7 = 7,
which is the pitch G.
We observe that 
α+((−1, 2) ∗(x, y)) = α+(−x, 2x −y)

= x −y = α−(x, y).
this relation, in musical terms, tells us that, if we have a descending counterpoint interval ((x, y), −) 
with endpoint x −y , we can change it for the ascending counterpoint interval 
((−1, 2) ∗(x, y), +) = ((−x, 2x −y), +)
if we are intereseted in preserving its “ endpoint”. For example, we change the descending fifth over D 
((2, 7), −) for 
((−1, 2) ∗(2, 7), +) = ((−2, 4 −7), +) = ((10, 9), +),

which is the ascending major sixth over A ♯. Both counterpoint intervals have the pitch G as their  
“endpoint” (figure 1.5).
The previous development is important in counterpoint where, in general, it is required that the intervals 
between two voices have the same orientation (whether ascending or descending). If they have opposite 
directions at some point (as when the voices cross), we can change the orientation of some intervals 
through multiplication by (−1, 2) until they are uniform, but maintaining one of the voices as invariant.
For more details about the musicological meaning of I , seen as a Z12-algebra and its applications to 
counterpoint, consult [M], part VII.
If conditions are imposed on the multiplication of an algebra we can obtain commutative algebras, 
associative algebras, algebras with identity.
A associative algebra with identity, such that every element different from zero is invertible, is called a 
division algebra.
2.9 Example. (MnK, +, ·, µ), where MnK  denotes the n × n  square matrices with coefficients in a 
field K  ( µ  denotes the scalar multiplication) is an algebra, the same as (K, +, ·, µ) and (K[x], +, ·, µ).
We define a graduated algebra as a sequence A = (A0, A1, A2, ...) of algebras Ai , one for each index 
i ∈N.
For those who have studied, in an elementary Linear Algebra, or Multilinear Algebra course, recall the 
following concepts from Multilinear Algebra (as in [Ll2]), that are not requisites for this text.
2.10 Example. Let T k(V ) = ⊗kV = V ⊗K · · · ⊗K V  be the tensorial product of a vector space V  on 
the field K, k  times. We call T k(V ) the tensor space of degree k  of V . If we define a multiplication
· : T kV × T lV →T k+lV as
(u1 ⊗... ⊗uk) · (v1 ⊗... ⊗vl) = u1 ⊗... ⊗uk ⊗v1 ⊗... ⊗vl
we 
obtain 
a 
graduated 
algebra 
(where 
we 
define 
T 0V = K  
and 
T 1V = V ) 
TV = (K, V, T 2V, T 3V, T 4V, . . .) called the tensor algebra of V .

Elementary Properties
In this section we present some elementary properties of groups. To the particular case of Group Theory, 
what was mentioned previously in general terms will be applied; that is, every time a property is proved 
for a set with a binary operation that satisfies the group axioms, this property is immediately valid for 
all sets that satisfy the group axioms.
Consider a group (G, ·). If x  and y  are elements of G , we denote x · y  as xy , to simplify the notation. 
Let e  be the identity element of G. With this notation, the generalized definition of group, that was 
promised in the previous section, is:
A group is a pair (G, ·) where G  is a non-empty set and 
·: G × G →G
is a binary operation 
(x, y) −→·(x, y)
where, by abuse or convenience of notation, we write 
·(x, y) = x · y = xy

such that
1.	 (xy)z = x(yz); x, y, z ∈G .
2.	 there exists an element e ∈G  such that ey = y , for every y ∈G.
3.	 for every y ∈G  there exists an element, denoted y−1, such that (y−1)y = e .
We say that a group is commutative or abelian if it also satisfies
4.	 xy = yx , for every x, y ∈G , that is, its binary operation is commutative.
If the group is abelian, it is usual to denote its binary operation with the + sign.
We can understand the concept of group as a special case of groups with operators in ∅ (and as an 
action, the only one possible of ∅ on G ).
The element e  will be called the left identity element or simply left identity of x  and y−1will be 
called the left inverse of y . Analogously, we have a right identity element and a right inverse. When 
the binary operation’s notation is clear, frequently it is omitted and the group (G, ·) is designated as G .
We will see that, in our definition of group, the stipulation of a left identity element and a left inverse 
implies the existence of a right identity and right inverse.
3.1 Proposition. In a group (G, ·), if an element is a left inverse it is also a right inverse. If e  is a left 
identity, then it is a right identity.
Proof. Consider x−1x = e  for any element x ∈G . Consider the left inverse element of x−1, that is, 
(x−1)−1x−1 = e . Then 
xx−1 = e(xx−1) = ((x−1)−1x−1)(xx−1) = (x−1)−1ex−1 = (x−1)−1x−1 = e.
Hence x−1 is a right inverse of x . Now, for any element x , consider the equalities 
xe = x(x−1x) = (xx−1)x = ex = x.
Thus e  is a right identity.♦
We say that e  is the identity element of a group G  if e  is a left or right identity element and we talk 
about the inverse of an element if its left or right inverse exist.
We will now see some elementary properties:

3.2 Proposition. The identity element e  of a group G  is unique.
Proof. Let e′  be another identity element such that e′e = e . As e  is also an identity, then e′e = e′ . 
Thus e = e′.♦
3.3 Proposition. If xy = xz  in a group G , then y = z . Analogously, yx = zx , then y = z .
Proof. If xy = xz , then x−1(xy) = x−1(xz). By associativity, (x−1x)y = (x−1x)z . Hence, ey = ez  
and, finally, y = z . If yx = zx , then y = z , which can be proved in the same way.♦
3.4 Proposition. In an arbitrary group G , the inverse of any element is unique.
Proof. Let x′  be another inverse element of the element x . Then, x′x = e . We also know that x−1x = e . 
Thus, x′x = x−1x = e . By the previous proposition, x′ = x−1.♦
3.5 Proposition. In an arbitrary group G , if x, y ∈G, the equations xa = y  and bx = y  have a 
unique solution in G .
Proof. Let x(x−1y) = (xx−1)y = ey = y . Hence, a = x−1y  is a solution to xa = y . Suppose that 
there are two solutions, xa = y  and xa′ = y . Then xa = xa′ , and a = a′ . Analogously for the other 
case.♦
3.6 Proposition. Let G  be a group. For any elements x, y  in G  
(xy)−1 = y−1x−1.
Proof. As 
(xy)(y−1x−1)
=
x(yy−1)x−1 = xx−1 = e,
(y−1x−1)(xy)
=
y−1(x−1x)y = y−1y = e
then (xy)−1 = y−1x−1.♦
Recall the definition of group homomorphism from the previous section with the following notation: 
Let (G, +) and (G′, ·) be two groups. A group homomorphism is a function f : G →G′  such that 
f(u + v) = f(u) · f(v).
Some examples follow.

3.7 Example. Let G = R3 and G′ = R  with the usual sum. We define f : G →G′  by the rule 
f(x, y, z) = 8x −4y + 4z . We will show that f  is a homomorphism. As 
f((x1, y1, z1) + (x2, y2, z2))
=
f(x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2)
=
8(x1 + x2) −4(y1 + y2) + 4(z1 + z2) y
f(x1, y1, z1) + f(x2, y2, z2)
=
(8x1, −4y1 + 4z1) + (8x2 −4y2 + 4z2),
f  is a homomorphism.
3.8 Proposition. Let f : G →G′  be a homomorphism of groups. If e  is an identity element of G  
then f(e) = e′  is the identity of G′ .
Proof. Consider e′f(x) = f(x) = f(ex) = f(e)f(x). Multiplying both sides by the inverse of f(x) 
we obtain e′f(x)f(x)−1 = f(e)f(x)f(x)−1. Then e′ = e′e′ = f(e)e′ = f(e). Thus e′ = f(e).♦
3.9 Example. Let G = G′ = R2. We define f : G →G′  by f(x, y) = (x + 8, y + 2). As 
f(0, 0) = (8, 2) ̸= (0, 0), f  is not a homomorphism, because all group homomorphisms send the 
identity element in the domain to the identity element in the codomain.
3.10 Proposition. The composition of two group homomorphisms is a group homomorphism.

Proof. Let f : G′ →G  and g : G →G′′  be group homomorphisms. Then 
(g ◦f)(x + y) = g(f(x + y)) = g(f(x) + f(y)) = g(f(x)) + g(f(y)) = (g ◦f)(x) +
(g ◦f)(y)
Hence (g ◦f) is a homomorphism.♦
3.11 Definition. Let f : G →G′  be a group homomorphism. We say that f  es un isomorphism, 
and write f : G
∼
=→G′  if there exists a homomorphism g : G′ →G  such that g ◦f = 1G  and 
f ◦g = 1G′ .
It is easy to show (Problem 3.13) that, if g  exists, it is determined uniquely; We denote it by f −1 and 
it is called the inverse of f . Hence, f : G →G′  is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective. We 
say that two groups G  and G′  are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism f : G
∼
=→G′  and we 
write G ∼= G′.
3.12 Definition. Let f : G →G′  be a group homomorphism. The kernel of f , denoted as ker f , is 
the set of all elements x ∈G  such that f(x) = e′  where e′  denotes the identity of G′. The image of 
f , denoted im f , is the set {  f(x) : x ∈G}.
If in the definition of homomorphism ker  f = {e}  we say that f  is a monomorphism and we denote 
it by f : G ↣G′ ; if im  f = G′  we say that f  is an epimorphism and we denote it by f : G ↠G′  
and if f  is such that ker f = {e}  and im  f = G′  then we say that f  is an isomorphism. In other 
words, f  is a monomorphism when it is injective; it is an epimorphism when it is surjective (onto), and 
it is an isomorphism when it is bijective (Problem 3.13). A homorphism f : G →G  will be called an 
endomorphism and, if f  is bijective, we will call it an automorphism.
3.13 Proposition. Let f : G′ →G , g : G →G′′  be two group homomorphisms and h = g ◦f  the 
composition of the two. Then, (i) if h  is a monomorphism, f  is a monomorphism, and (ii) if h  is an 
epimorphsm, g  is an epimorphism.
Proof. (i) Suppose that h  is a monomorphism. If f(x) = f(y) then h(x) = g(f(x)) = g(f(y)) = h(y). 
As h  is a monomorphism, x = y . Hence f  is a monomorphism. (ii) Suppose that h  is an epimorphism. 
Then h(G′) = G′′. Thus, G′′ = h(G′) = g(f(G′)) ⊂g(G) ⊂G′′ . Hence, g(G) = G′′ .♦
We say that a homomorphism f : G →G′  is trivial if f(x) = e′  for every x ∈G . That is, im  
f = {e′}. If f  is trivial, we denote it as O  (see Problem 3.9). Thus f = O  if and only if ker f = G .
Now we will study those subsets of a group which are, also, groups themselves.

3.14 Definition. We say that a subset H  of (G, ·) is a subgroup of G  if H  is a stable group, that is, 
if H  is closed under the induced binary operation. We denote this as H < G.
We will see a result that provides a way of showing that a subset of a group is a subgroup.
3.15 Proposition. A subset H  of (G, ·) is a subgroup of G  if and only if the following three conditions 
are satisfied:
1.	 H  is stable or closed under · .
2.	 the identity element e  of G  is in H.
3.	 if x ∈H, then x−1 ∈H.
Proof. See Problem 3.4.♦
3.16 Example. (Z, +) is a subgroup of (R, +). (Q+, ·) is a subgroup of (R+, ·). (Q, +) is also a 
subgroup of (R, +), (R, +) is a subgroup of (C, +) and (2Z, +) is a subgroup of (Z, +).
3.17 Example. Let (G, ·) be a group. Both G  and {e}  are subgroups of (G, ·), called improper 
subgroups . All other subgroups are called proper. The subgroup {e}  is called the trivial subgroup 
and it is usual to denote it, by abuse of notation, only by e  where e  can also be denoted as 0 or 1 or 
any other notation that represents the identity element of the group under consideration.
3.18 Proposition. The intersection of subgroups of G  is a subgroup of G .
Proof. Let {Hi}i∈I  be a collection of subgroups of G , indexed by a set I  of indices. We take x, y ∈∩iHi . 
As ∩iHi ⊂Hi  for every i , we see that x, y ∈Hi . As Hi  is a subgroup of G , x + y ∈Hi , e ∈Hi , 
x−1 ∈Hi  for every i ∈I . Hence, x + y ∈∩Hi, e ∈∩Hi, x−1 ∈∩Hi .♦
3.19 Proposition. Let f : G →G′  be a homomorphism of groups. Then, if H  is a subgroup of G , 
f(H) is subgroup of G′  and if H′ is a subgroup of G′ , f −1(H′) is a subgroup of G .
Proof. We will show that f(H) = {f(x)|x ∈H}  is a subgroup of G′. Let v, w ∈f(H); Then there 
exist x, y ∈H  such that f(x) = v , f(y) = w . As H  is a subgroup of G , x + y ∈H . As f  is a 
homomorphism, f(e) = e′ ∈f(H), v + w = f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) ∈f(H). If x ∈H  then 
f(x) ∈f(H). As H  is a subgroup of G , x−1 ∈H . Then (Problem 3.18) f(x−1) = f(x)−1 ∈f(H). 
Hence, f(H) is a subgroup of G′.

Now, we will see that f −1(H′) = {x ∈G|f(x) ∈H′}  is a subgroup of G . Let x, y ∈f −1(H′), 
then f(x) and f(y) are in H′ . As H′  is a subgroup of G′  and f  is a homomorphism, 
f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ∈H′  and f(e) = e′ ∈H′ . Given that f(x) ∈H′ , as f(x)−1 = f(x−1) , 
f(x)−1 ∈H′ . Hence f −1(H′) is a subgroup of G .♦
Observe that in the previous Proposition the inverse image is a subgroup of the domain, although there 
is not necessarily an inverse function f −1 for f . The inverse image of {e′}  is the kernel of f  and 
the inverse image of any subgroup contains the kernel of f .
3.20 Corollary. Let f : G →G′  be a group homomorphism. Then im  f  is a subgroup of G′  and 
ker  f  is a subgroup of G .
Proof. Immediate from the previous proposition taking H = G  and H′ = e′ .♦
We will denote as Hom(X, Y ) the set of homomorphisms of an abelian group X  in an abelian 
group Y . Let f, g : X −→Y  be homomorphisms of abelian groups and define f + g : X −→Y  by 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x). It is easy to show that this definition makes Hom(X, Y ) an abelian 
group, (Problem 3.21).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Elementary Properties
3.17 In a group G , show that if an element x  is idempotent (x · x = x) then x = e , where e  is the 
identity element of G . Use this to show that under a group homomorphism, the identity element 
in the domain is sent, under the homomorphism, to the identity element in the codomain.
3.18 Let f : G →G′  be a group homomorphism. Show that if x ∈G  then f(x−1) = f(x)−1.
3.19 Let X, Y  and G  be abelian groups. We say that f : X × Y →G  is a biadditive function 
if 
f(x1 + x2, y) = f(x1, y) + f(x2, y) 
and 
f(x, y1 + y2) = f(x, y1) + f(x, y2) 
for 
x, x1, x2 ∈X, y, y1, y2 ∈Y. Show that
1.	 f(λx, y) = λf(x, y) = f(x, λy) for every x ∈X, y ∈Y  and λ ∈Z.
2.	 f  is never injective unless X = Y = 0.
3.20 Show that the group (Z[x], +) is isomorphic to the group (Q+, ·).
3.21 Consider Hom(X, Y ) as the set of homomorphisms of the abelian group X  into the abelian group 
Y . Let f, g : X −→Y  be group homomorphisms of abelian groups and define f + g : X −→Y  
by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x). Show that this definition makes Hom(X, Y ) an abelian group.
3.22 Let ψ: Y ′ −→Y  be a homomorphism of abelian groups and (X
f
−→Y ′) an element of 
Hom(X, Y ′). Associate a homomorphism (X
g
−→Y ) ∈Hom(X, Y ) to f  with a function 
given by 
ψ∗= Hom(X, ψ): Hom(X, Y ′) −→Hom(X, Y )
where ψ∗(f) = ψ ◦f . Show that ψ∗ is a homomorphism of abelian groups.
3.23 Let ϕ: X′ −→X  be a homomorphism of abelian groups and (X
g
−→Y ) ∈Hom(X, Y ). 
Associate a homomorphism (X′
f
−→Y ) ∈Hom(X′, Y ) to g  with a function given by 
(ϕ, Y ): Hom(X, Y ) −→(X′, Y ) such that ϕ∗(g) = g ◦ϕ . Show that ϕ∗ is a homomorphism 
of abelian groups.
3.24 Let ψ: Y ′ −→Y  and ψ′ : Y −→Y ′′  be homomorphisms of abelian groups and X  an abelian 
group. Show that if 1Y : Y −→Y  is the identity, then 1Y∗: Hom(X, Y ) −→Hom(X, Y ) is 
the identity of Hom(X, Y ), and (ψ′ ◦ψ)∗= ψ′
∗◦ψ∗.
3.25 Let ϕ: X′ −→X  and ϕ′ : X −→X′′  be homomorphisms of abelian groups and Y  an abelian 
group. Show that if 1X : X −→X  is the identity, then 1∗
X : Hom(X, Y ) −→Hom(X, Y ) is 
the identity of Hom(X, Y ), and (ϕ′ ◦ϕ)∗= ϕ∗◦ϕ′∗.

Cyclic Groups
1.4	
Cyclic Groups
Consider a multiplicative group (G, ·) and the powers of a fixed element x ∈G , that is, {xn|n ∈Z}  
where we define x0 = e .
4.1 Proposition. The set {xn|n ∈Z}  denoted (x) is a subgroup of G .
Proof. As xixj = xi+j , the product of two elements of the set is in the set; thus (x) is closed. As 
x0 = e , e ∈(x). Finally, for xn , we consider x−n . Then, xnx−n = e .♦
4.2 Definition. The subgroup (x) will be called the cyclic subgroup of G  generated by one of its 
elements x  and we say that x  is a generator of (x). If (x) = G  we say that G  is a cyclic group 
generated by x .
If there does not exist a natural number n  for the subgroup (x) such that xn = e  we say that (x) 
is infinite cyclic. If n  is the smallest natural such that xn = e , then (x) consists of the elements 
xn−1, ...x1, e = xn and, in this case, we say that (x) is cyclic group of order n .
4.3 Example. Z  and Zn  are cyclic groups, the first is infinite, and the second is finite. 3Z = (3) 
is also cyclic and, in general, nZ = (n) are infinite cyclic groups, n ∈N. Observe that 
(8) = 8Z <(4) = 4Z <(2) = 2Z .

Cyclic Groups
4.4 Example. (1) = (3) = Z4, (1) = (−1) = Z .
4.5 Proposition. If G  is a cyclic group, then it is commutative (abelian).
Proof. Let (x) = G. Then xmxr = xm+r = xr+m = xrxm . Hence G  is commutative (abelian).♦
4.6 Definition. Let G  be any group and x  an element of G. Let r  be the smallest natural number 
such that xr = e , then we say that x  has order r . If there does not exist a natural number r  such that 
xr = e , we say that x  has infinite order.
When we consider non abelian groups we will usually use the multiplicative notation and when the 
groups are abelian we will usually use additive notation. However, we will use multiplicative notation 
for cyclic groups (which are abelian).
We have the following properties (known as the laws of exponents) in multiplicative notation 
xnxm = xn+m, (xn)m = xnm, x−n = (xn)−1
and, in additive notation
nx + mx = (n + m)x, m(nx) = (mn)x, (−n)x = −(nx).
If a group G  is abelian, the following holds 
n(x + y) = nx + ny.
Observe that (once Problems 4.2 and 4.3 are solved) for each n ∈N  there is a cyclic group of order 
n , (n) = nZ . Observe, as well, that if we have two cyclic groups of order n , when we take their 
generators, we can find a one-to-one correspondence with each power of the generator, which means 
that, essentially, there is only one cyclic group of order n  structurally. In other words, two cyclic groups 
of the same order are isomorphic, as we will see below.
4.7 Theorem. Let (G, ·) be a infinite cyclic group. Then the function
h : Z −→G
given by
n −→xn
for a fixed element x  of G  is an isomorphism of groups.

Cyclic Groups
Proof. 
h(n + m) = xn+m = xnxm = h(n)h(m), 
thus 
h  
is 
a 
homomorphism. 
If 
h(n) = xn = xm = h(m), then n = m . thus h  is injective. For every xn ∈G , the integer n  goes 
to xn  under h . Hence, h  is surjective.♦
Example. Consider the infinite cyclic subgroup of (R∗, ·) (the nonzero reals with the usual multiplication) 
generated by the element
x =
12√
2
(1)
The number x  is, by definition, the quotient of the frequencies between a pitch and another that is a 
semitone above (see chapter 4, section 1). The numbers xk  (up to multplication by a constant) correspond 
to the hertzian frequencies of the pitches used in the music of equal tempered tuning.
By theorem 4.7 we see that (x) is isomorphic to (Z, +). We will abuse of this isomorphism and associate 
a pitch to each element of the group (Z, +) or to the group (Z12, +), as can be seen in section 2 of 
chapter 3.
In addition, such an isomorphism reflects the way our brain interprets the musical distances, or intervals 
(for more details, see chapter 3, section 2 and chapter 4, section 1). 
4.8 Theorem. Every finite cyclic group of order n , with a generator of order n , is isomorphic to Zn .
Proof. Let G  be a cyclic group of order n . Let x  be a generator of G  such that xn = e . We define 
h : Zn −→G
given by
[m] −→h([m]) = xm.
Suppose that h([j]) = h([k]), then xj = xk. Hence, xj−k = e. Thus, j −k = rn  and n|j −k. 
Therefore, [j] = [k] in Zn.We can also suppose that the ker  h = {[j]}. Then h([j]) = e. Hence 
xj = e = x0. Thus, [j] = [0] in Zn. Therefore, h  is injective. It is easy to see that h  is well defined, 
it is a homomorphism and it is surjective, (Problem 4.5).♦

Cyclic Groups
4.9 Observation. Consider a cyclic group generated by en element x  of order n , and consider q  an 
integer such that n = mq. The different powers of x , say
xq, x2q, x3q, ..., xmq = xn = e,
form a cyclic subgroup of (x) of order m.
Similarly, if N  is a nontrivial subgroup of (x) we can take the least positive integer q  such that xq ∈N. 
As e = xn = xmq , and m|n , it is clear that N  has m = n/q  elements. Finally if o(G) = n , then 
xj  is a generator of G  if and only if (n, j) = 1, (Problem 4.7).
4.10 Example. Consider (Z12, +). The generators of Z12 are the elements j  such that (12, j) = 1, 
that is, j = 1, 5, 7 and 11. Thus, Z12 = (1) = (5) = (7) = (11). The possibilities for q  and m  in 
12 = qm  are 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4, 4 and 3, 6 and 2, 12 and 1 respectively. Hence, the 
different powers of a generator x , 
x1q, x2q, x3q, ..., xmq = x12 = 0

Cyclic Groups
form a cyclic subgroup of (x) of order m.  If we take x = 1, which makes the calculations easy, 
we obtain the powers of 1: For q = 1, m = 12, {11·1, 12·1, 13·1, ..., 112·1 = 112 = 0}  which, 
in additive notation is {1 · 1, 2 · 1, 3 · 1, ..., 12 · 1 = 0}  and we get, exactly (1) = Z12. 
Analogously, for 
q = 2, m = 6, we obtain 
{11·2, 12·2, 13·2, ..., 16·2 = 112 = 0}  which, 
in 
additive 
notation 
is 
{2 · 1, 4 · 1, 6 · 1, ..., 12 · 1 = 0} = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0} = (2). 
For q = 3, m = 4, we get {11·3, 12·3, 13·3, 14·3 = 112 = 0}  which, in additive notation is  
{3 · 1, 6 · 1, 9 · 1, 12 · 1 = 0} = {3, 6, 9, 0} = (3). 
For 
q = 4, 
m = 3, 
we 
obtain  
{11·4, 12·4, 13·4 = 112 = 0}  
which, 
in 
additive 
notation 
is 
{4 · 1, 8 · 1, 12 · 1 = 0} = {4, 8, 0} = (4). For q = 6, m = 2, we get {11·6, 12·6 = 112 = 0}  
which, in additive notation, is {6 · 1, 12 · 1 = 0} = {6, 0} = (6). Finally, for q = 12, m = 1, we 
get {11·12 = 0}  which, in additive notation, is {12 · 1 = 0} = {0} = (0) = O . Thus we have a

Chapter 2
2.1	
Exact Sequences
In this section we will study finite and infinite sequences of group homomorphisms.
· · · −→G′
f
−→G
g
−→G′′ −→· · ·
We begin with the study of sequences where the kernel of the “outgoing” homomorphism contains the 
image of the “incoming” homomorphism.
1.1 Definition. We say that a sequence of groups 
· · · −→Gi−1
fi−1
−→Gi
fi
−→Gi+1
fi+1
−→· · ·
is semiexact in Gi  if im  fi−1 ⊂ker fi . If it is semiexact in each group, we call it a semiexact sequence.
This definition is equivalent, as we will soon see, to the composition of the two homomorphisms, the 
“outgoing” and the “incoming”, being the trivial homomorphism. By abuse of notation, we denote the 
identity element of any group as e, or sometimes as eGi  to specifiy the identity of the group Gi , and 
we denote the trivial morphism as O  or “zero”.
1.2 Proposition. A sequence of groups 
· · · −→Gi−1
fi−1
−−→Gi
fi
−→Gi+1
fi+1
−−→· · ·
es semiexact in Gi  if and only if the composition fi ◦fi−1 = O.
Proof. Suppose that a sequence is semiexact in Gi . Then im  fi−1 ⊂ker fi . We see that the composition 
[fi ◦fi−1](x) = O(x) = eGi+1 for every x ∈Gi−1. As fi−1(x) ∈im  fi−1 ⊂ker fi , we have 
fi(fi−1(x)) = eGi+1 = O(x). Thus, as x  is arbitrary, fi ◦fi−1 = O. Now, suppose fi ◦fi−1 = O . 
Let y ∈im  fi−1 be arbitrary. Then there exists an x ∈Gi−1 such that fi−1(x) = y . Then 
fi(y) = fi(fi−1(x)) = O(x) = eGi+1, and y ∈f −1
i
(e) = ker fi . We have shown that, if y ∈im  
fi−1, then y ∈ker fi  for any y . Thus im  fi−1 ⊂ker fi .♦

is exact in Gi  if it is semiexact and im  fi−1 ⊃ker fi . If it is exact in each group, we call it an exact 
sequence.
We will also say that such a sequence is exact in Gi  if and only if im  fi−1 = ker fi . Every exact 
sequence is semiexact, but not every semiexact sequence is exact. An exact sequence of the form
e −→G′
f
−→G
g
−→G′′ −→e
will be called a short exact sequence.
1.4 Example. Consider the sequence 
O
h
−→Z2
f=×2
−−−→Z4
g
−→Z2
k
−→O.
Here, f  is given by f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 2; g(0) = g(2) = 0 and g(1) = g(3) = 1. It is easy to 
show that f  and g , defined this way, are group homomorphisms. It is clear that im  h = {0} = ker 
f , im  f = {0, 2} = ker g , and im  g = {0, 1} = ker k . Thus, it is a short exact sequence.

Here 
f  
is 
given 
by 
f(0) = (0, 0) 
and 
f(1) = (1, 0); 
g(0, 0) = g(1, 0) = 0 
and 
g(0, 1) = g(1, 1) = 1. It is easy to prove that f  and g  defined this way are group homomorphisms. 
It is clear that im  h = {0} = ker f , im  f = {(0, 0), (1, 0)} = ker g , and im  g = {0, 1} = ker 
k . Hence, it is a short exact sequence.
Example. Let M  be an R -module (that certainly is a group under addition), and 
Mk = M ⊕M ⊕· · · ⊕M



k
.
In a first approximation, the musical objects (whether a scale, a chord, a motif, a rhythm) can be seen 
as a subset of some appropriate Mk  module. In Mathematical Music Theory, it is very interesting to 
classify the musical objects with musical meaning, up to isomorphism, of Mk. For example, how many 
different chords or scales are there if we consider all the transpositions as equivalent? Or, how many 
motifs are there if the permutations of their elements are considered, essentially, as the same motif? 
A short exact sequence that is used in the classification of musical objects is 
0 →M
∆n+1
−→Mn+1 dn+1
−→Mn →0
where ∆k  is the diagonal morphism 
∆k : M −→Mk,

and dk+1 the difference morphismfism 
dk+1 : Mk+1 −→M,
(m0, . . . , mk) −→(m1 −m0, . . . , mk −m0).
As ∆n+1(m) = 0 if and only if m = 0, we have ker ∆n+1 = 0. Then 
dn+1(m0, . . . , mn) = (m1 −m0, . . . , mn −m0) = (0, . . . , 0)

if and only if mk = m0 for k = 1, . . . , n . Hence ker dn+1 = im ∆n+1. Finally, dn+1 is surjective, 
because for any (m1, . . . , mn) we can see that 
dn+1(0, m1, . . . , mn) = (m1 −0, . . . , mn −0) = (m1, . . . , mn).
In other words, the im dn+1 = Mn . 
Often we elimnate the symbol ◦ from the notation g ◦f  and write, simply, gf . Consider an exact 
sequence of groups
H′
f
−→H
g
−→G
h
−→G′′
with f  an epimorphism and h  a monomorphism. Then im  f = H  and ker h = e . As the sequence 
is exact, H = im  f = ker g  and im  g = ker h = e ; then, g  is the trivial homomorphism. Inversely, 
if g  is the trivial homomorphism, then f  is an epimorphism and h  is a monomorphism. Thus, we have
1.6 Proposition. If 
H′
f
−→H
g
−→G
h
−→G′′
is an exact sequence of groups, h  is monomorphism if and only if g  is trivial; g  is trivial if and only 
if f  is an epimorphism.
So, when we have a short exact sequence as follows
e −→G′
f
−→G
g
−→G′′ −→e
we will write it, indistinctly, as 
G′

g↠G′′
where ↣ denotes injective and ↠ surjective.

two of the three homomorphisms h′ , h , h′′  are isomorphisms. Then the third is also an isomorphism.
Proof. Suppose that h′  and h′′  are isomorphisms. We will show that h  is a monomorfism: let 
x ∈ker h ; then gh(x) = g(eH) = h′′f(x) = eH′′ . As h′′  is an isomorphism, then f(x) = eG′′ . 
Thus there exists an x′ ∈G′  such that f ′(x′) = x , because the sequence on top is exact. Then 
hf ′(x′) = h(x) = eH = g′h′(x′). As g′h′  is injective, then x′ = eG . Hence, f ′(x′) = x = eG .
Now we will show that h  is an epimorphism. Let y ∈H . As h′′ is an isomorphism, there exists x′′ ∈G′′  
such that g(y) = h′′(x′′). As f  is surjective, there exists z ∈G  such that f(z) = x′′ . Hence,
g(y −h(z)) = g(y) −gh(z) = g(y) −h′′f(z) = g(y) −h′′(x′′) = g(y) −g(y) = eH′′.

Thus, y −h(z) ∈ker g . As the sequence on the bottom is exact, there exists y′ ∈H′ with 
g′(y′) = y −h(z). As h′  is an isomorphism, there exists x′ ∈G′  such that h′(x′) = y′ . Thus,
h(f ′(x′) + z) = hf ′(x′) + h(z) = g′h′(x′) + h(z) = g′(y′) + y −g′(y′) = y.
If we define x = f ′(x′) + z , we have h(x) = y . The other two possible cases are left as an exercise,

Quotient Groups
Consider the first example of section 1. We distributed the integers in three boxes, where none of them 
were in two or more of the boxes, only in one of them. We labelled the boxes with three labels. We gave 
a group structure to the set of boxes by defining a binary operation. The reader verified that, indeed, we 
had a commutative group. We will call the boxes cosets and we will call the group a quotient group. In 
this case it is the quotient of Z  “modulo” 3Z , which we will denote Z3.
Recall the concept of vector space quotient studied in Linear Algebra (see [Ll2]) and consider the additive 
part for the case in which G  is an abelian group and H  a subgroup of G , with x ∈G ; we denoted 
as x + H  the set {x + y|y ∈H}. These elements, x + H , will be called cosets of H  in G . As 
0 ∈H  and x = x + 0 ∈x + H, each x ∈G  belongs to a coset. It was verified that any two cosets 
are either equal, or their intersection is empty (they are disjoint). The set of all cosets of H  in G  was 
denoted as G/H  and G/H  was given a group structure by
+: G/H × G/H →G/H$
such that 
((x + H), (y + H)) −→((x + y) + H).

It was also proved that this binary operation is well defined and that it defines an abelian group structure 
(the additive part of the vector space) in G/H . We wil call G/H , the quotient group of G  modulo H .
It was also seen that H  is a subgroup of the group G  and if y ∈x + H , then there exists w ∈H  
such that y = x + w . Hence y −x = w ∈H . Therefore, if y −x ∈H  then y −x = w ∈H . 
Thus y = x + w ∈x + H  , and y −x ∈H ⇐⇒−(y −x) = x −y ∈H ⇐⇒x ∈y + H . 
In synthesis, 
y ∈x + H ⇐⇒y −x ∈H ⇐⇒x ∈y + H.
Finally, we saw p: G →G/H  given by x −→x + H. If x, w ∈G , then 
p(x + w) = (x + w) + H = (x + H) + (w + H) = p(x) + p(w).
Hence, p  is a homomorphism called the canonical projection.
All of this was done for vector spaces over a field K. However, recall that the additive part of a vector 
space is an abelian group.
What about the non-commutative case? What happens? We will imitate the previous development and 
adjust it to the non-commutative context. To begin, we consider, once again, the first example of section 
1. An equivalence relation called congruence modulo 3 was taken, where x ≡y  (mod  3) if and only if 
3| −x + y , or, in other words, −x + y ∈3Z . What we will do, is generalize this equivalence relation 
to non abelian groups, using multiplicative notation as follows:
2.1 Definition. Consider the subgroup H  of a group (G, ·) and elements x, y ∈G. We say that x  is 
congruent on the left with y  if x−1y ∈H  (that is, if y = xh  for some h ∈H ) and we denote it as 
x ≡i y  (mod  H). Analogously, we say that x  is congruent on the right with y  if xy−1 ∈H  and 
we denote it as x ≡d y  (mod  H).
Observe that, in the abelian case, the concepts of left and right congruence coincide, given that x−1y ∈H  
if and only if (x−1y)−1 = y−1x = xy−1 ∈H.

2.2 Proposition. The left and right congruence relations are equivalence relations.
Proof. As x ≡i x (mod H) ⇐⇒x−1x = e ∈H , the relation is reflexive. As x ≡i y (mod  
H) ⇐⇒x−1y ∈H ⇐⇒(x−1y)−1 ∈H ⇐⇒y−1x ∈H ⇐⇒y ≡i x (mod H) the relation is 
symmetric. Finally, if x ≡i y (mod  H) and y ≡i z (mod  H) then x−1y ∈H  and y−1z ∈H . 
Hence (x−1y)(y−1z) ∈H ⇐⇒x−1ez = x−1z ∈H. Thus x ≡i z (mod H) and the relation is 
transitive. Analogously for the right congruence.♦
2.3 Proposition. The left and right equivalence clases [x] of the relation defined can be expressed as 
xH = {xh|h ∈H}
and 
Hx = {hx|h ∈H}
respectively.

Quotient Groups
Proof. The equivalence classes of any element x  of G  can be expressed as (using the symmetry):
[x]
=
{y ∈G|y ≡i x (mod H)}
=
{y ∈G|x ≡i y (mod H)}
=
{y ∈G|x−1y = h ∈H}
=
{y ∈G|y = xh; h ∈xH}
=
{xh|h ∈H} = xH.
The same is true for the equivalence classes under the relation of right congruence modulo H.♦
Observe that a group G  is the union of the left or right cosets of H  in G . Similarly, two cosets are 
either disjoint or the same. We will call the equivalence clases xH  and Hx  the left cosets and right 
cosets respectively.
Consider the set of all left cosets, and denote it as G/H . We want to give the set a group structure 
and make the natural or canonical projection p : G −→G/H  a homomorphism. This is not always 
possible, but we will see what conditions will allow it.
2.4 Definition. We say that a subgroup H  of G  is normal in G  (denoted H ◁G ) if for every x ∈G , 
xHx−1 ⊂H  where xHx−1 = {xhx−1|h ∈H} .
Given that xHx−1 ⊂H  holds for every element x ∈G  by this definition, in particular it holds 
for x−1 ∈G . Then, x−1Hx ⊂H. Thus, for every h ∈H , h = x(x−1hx)x−1 ∈xHx−1. Then 
H ⊂xHx−1 and xHx−1 = H. From here it is easy to see that every left coset is a right coset and 
that xH = Hx  for every x ∈G  (Problema 2.4). We also observe that every subgroup of an abelian 
group is normal and that the trivial subgroups are normal in G  (Problema 2.5).
2.5 Proposition. A subgroup H  of G  is normal if and only if (xH)(yH) = (xy)H  for every 
x, y ∈G .
Proof. Suppose that H  is normal and we take any two elements x, y ∈G . It is easy to see that 
(xH)(yH) = (xyH) Problem 2.9. Now, suppose that (xH)(yH) = (xy)H  for every x, y ∈G . 
Let h ∈H  and x ∈G  be arbitrary. Then 
xhx−1 = (xh)(x−1e) ∈(xH)(x−1H) = eH = H,
and H  is normal.♦

2.6 Theorem. Let H  be a normal subgroup of G . Then G/H  is a group with a binary operation 
· : G/H × G/H −→G/H
given by 
((xH), (yH)) →·((xH), (yH)) = (xH) · (yH) = (xH)(yH) = (xy)H.
In addition, the canonical projection p : G −→G/H  is an epimorphism whose kernel is H , i.e. 
ker p = H.
Proof. It is immediate to see that the group axioms hold in G/H  with eH = H  as the identity element 
and x−1H  as the inverse of xH. As p(xy) = (xy)H = (xH)(yH) = p(x)p(y) and p  is surjective, 
then it is an epimorphism. Finally, 
ker(p)
=
{x ∈G|p(x) = eH = H} =
=
{x ∈G|xH = H} = {x ∈G|x ∈H}
=
H.♦
2.7 Corollary. If H ◁G  then H  is the kernel of the homomorphism g  from G  into G′  for a group 
G′, i.e. H = ker(g : G −→G′) for a group G′.
Proof. As H  is normal, then it is the kernel of an epimorphism, as in the previous theorem.♦
2.8 Proposition. If H = ker(g : G −→G′) for a group G′  then H ◁G .
Proof. Let h ∈H  and x ∈G  be arbitrary. Then 
g(xhx−1) = g(x)g(h)g(x−1) = g(x)eg(x−1) = g(x)(g(x))−1 = e.
Therefore, xhx−1 ∈ker(g : G −→G′) = H .♦
By the previous corollary and proposition, the normality condition is necessary, and sufficient, for the 
concept of quotient group.
2.9 Theorem. (Lagrange) If G  is a group of order n  and H < G , then o(H)|o(G).

An Introduction to Group Theory

Quotient Groups
Proof. As G  is the union of its left cosets, the number of elements n  of G , is equal to the product of 
the number of left cosets r  times the number of elements of each set m = o(H) because the cosets 
of H  has the same number of elements m  (Problem 2.2) and they are either disjoint or equal. Thus, 
n = rm , that is, o(H)|o(G).♦
The number of left (or right) cosets of a subgroup H < G  will be denoted (G : H) and we will call it 
the índex of H  in G , that is, (G : H) = o(G/H). By Problem 2.4, the index of H  in G  does not 
depend if left or right cosets are considered, and it can be finite or infinite. Clearly, as each coset has 
o(H) elements, (G : H) = o(G)/o(H).
2.10 Corollary. If the order of a group G  es prime, then G  is cyclic.
Proof. Let p = o(G) and (x) the cyclic subgroup generated by the element x ̸= e ∈G. By the Theorem 
of Lagrange 2 ≤o((x)), and o((x))|p . Then, o((x)) = p  , thus (x) = G  and G  is cyclic.♦
From the previous corollary we can infer that there exists one, and only one, group (up to isomorphism) 
of prime order.Observe that a group of prime order cannot have nontrivial proper subgroups. The trivial 
subgroups G  and e  are normal in G . Hence G/G  is the trivial group e  and G/e  is isomorphic to 
G . We say that a group G  is simple if its only normal subgroups are trivial. The alternating group An  
is simple for n ≥5 as we will see in the following chapter.

Finally we have the following
2.11 Theorem. Let (x) be a cyclic group generated by x  and h : (x) −→H  a group homomorphism. 
Then im  h = h((x)) is a cyclic subgroup of H.
Proof. Suppose that (x) has order n. If h  is a homomorphism and x  generates (x), as h(xr) = [h(x)]r 
(Problem 2.13), then h(x) generates im h  because h(e) = (h(xn) = [h(x)]n = e.♦
Example. The human brain perceives two pitches as essentially identical when their frequencies have 
a ratio equal to 2r with r ∈Z . That is, it “ identifies” two frequencies u, w ∈(x) < (R∗, ·) when 
u−1w ∈(x12), where x  is the real number given by the equation (1.1). Indeed, 
x12 = (
12√
2)12 = 2
and u−1w = w
u ∈(2) = (x12) means that w
u = 2r  for some r ∈Z .
Given that 
h : Z →(x),
n →xn,
defines an isomorphism between Z  and (x), the pitches which are essentially different to the human 
ear happen to be those whose quotient is 
(x)
(x12)
∼=
Z
12Z = Z12;
the reader should verify that, indeed, (x12) ∼= 12Z  under the isomorphism h .
This way one justifies the abuse of nomenclature committed when identifying elements of Z  and Z12 
with pitches. It is also very useful for defining the concept of scale in a rigurous manner. A scale E  is 
a subset of Z  (which we see as pitches) such that 
e12(E) = E + 12 = E
that is, x + 12 ∈E  for every x ∈E .
The scales are well behaved under the canonical projection p : Z →Z12 =
Z
12Z , in the sense that 
p−1(p(E)) = E.

The set p(E) ⊆Z12 is called the chord of the scale4. Generally the abuse of nomenclature is committed 
when referring to a scale by its chord, as in the example from Chapter 1, Section 1.
In fact, given a subset S ⊆Z12, we define a scale as 
E = p−1(S);
the reader should prove that this, indeed, defines a scale and that the chord of this scale is S . For 
example, the scale that comes from S = Z12 is exactly the chormatic scale. 
Let C = {Cn, ∂n}  be a chain complex, or chain. The homology group of degree n C , Hn(C) is 
defined as the quotient Hn(C) = ker ∂n/im  ∂n+1. That is, given a chain
C : · · · −→Cn+1
∂n+1
−−−→Cn
∂n
−→Cn−1 −→· · ·
we consider the kernel of ∂n, ker ∂n ⊂Cn , and the image of im  ∂n+1 ⊂Cn , and we form the 
quotient ker  ∂n/im  ∂n+1. Note that C  is a semiexact sequence, that is, im  ∂n+1 ⊂ker ∂n , and 
that the quotient Hn(C) = ker ∂n/im  ∂n+1 measures the inexactness of C . Indeed, if C  is exact, 
then im  ∂n+1 = ker ∂n  and Hn(C) = 0.
The elements of Cn are known as chains of degree n , and the homomorphisms ∂n  are called diferentials 
or boundary operators. The elements of the kernel of ∂n  are called cycles of degree n , denoted as 
Zn(C) and the elements of the image of ∂n+1 are called boundaries of degree n , denoted as Bn(C). 
Thus, Hn(C) = Zn(C)/Bn(C).
We say that two elements of Hn(C) are homologous if they belong to the same coset. The element of 
Hn(C), determined by the cycle c  of degree n , is called the homology class of c  and is denoted by 
[c]. Then, for each n ∈Z , we define a homology group Hn(C). We call H∗(C) = {Hn(C)}  the 
homology of the chain C .

Isomorphism Theorems
3.1 Definition. An automorphism of a group G  is an isomorphism of G  into G .
For every element x ∈G , the function
ιx :
G −→G given by
y −→xyx−1
is an automorphism of G , see Problem 3.1, called inner automorphism. In these terms we can say that 
H  is a normal (or invariant) subgroup if and only if H  is invariant under every inner automorphism 
of G .
3.2 Proposition. Let H ◁G  and H′ ◁G′. Consider the cannonical projections to the corresponding 
quotients p : G −→G/H  y p′ : G′ −→G′/H′ . If g : G −→G′  is a group homomorphism such 
that g(H) ⊂H′, then g∗: G/H −→G′/H′  given by xH →g∗(xH) = g(x)H′  is well defined 
and is a group homomorphism called the homomorphism induced by g  in the quotient groups. The 
following square is also commutative

g∗

and im  g∗= p′(im  g) and ker  g∗= p(g−1(H′)).
Proof. If x ∈G  and y ∈H  are arbitrary, given that g(xy) = g(x)g(y) ∈g(x)g(H) ⊂g(x)H′ , the 
image of xH  under g  is contained in a unique coset of H′ , say g(xH) ⊂g(x)H′ . Then, we define 
g∗:
G/H
−→
G′/H′ such that
xH

g∗(xH) = g(x)H′.
It is immediate to prove that g∗ is well defined and to prove it is a homomorphism, consider any cosets 
xH  and x′H. Then,

Isomorphism Theorems
We will show that the square commutes: consider and element 
x  of 
G . Then 
(p′ ◦g)(x) = p′(g(x)) = g(x)H′ = g∗(xH) = g∗(p(x)) = (g∗◦p)(x). 
Thus (p′ ◦g) = (g∗◦p). As p  and p′  are epimorphisms, it is also clear that im g∗= p′(im  g) y 
ker  g∗= p(g−1(H′)).♦
3.3 Theorem. Under the same hypothesis of the previous proposition, in particular, if g  is an 
epimorphism with H′ = e  and H = ker g  then G′/H′ ∼= G′  and g∗ is an isomorphism in the 
following commutative diagram:
G

Proof. If g  is an epimorphism with H′ = e  and H = ker g  then G′ = G′/H′  and g∗ is an 
isomorphism. As ker g∗= p(g−1(e)) = p(ker g) = p(H) = eH = eG/H = e , then g∗ is a 
monomorphism and as im g∗= p′(im  g) = G′  then g∗ is an epimorphism, hence an isomorphism.

3.4  Theorem. Let H ◁G  and, as a particular case of the previous theorem, e = H′ ◁G′  with H ⊂ker g . 
Then there is a unique homomorphism g∗: G/H −→G′  given by xH →g∗(xH) = g(x)H′ = g(x). 
Also, ker g∗= ker g/H  and im  g = im  g∗. g∗ is an isomorphism if and only if, g  is an epimorphism 
and H = ker g.
Proof. By the previous theorem, g  is a homomorphism. It is unique since it is determined by g. 
Also, xH ∈ker g∗ if and only if g(x) = e , which happens if and only if x ∈ker g. So, 
ker g∗= {xH|x ∈ker g} = ker g/H. Clearly im  g = im  g∗. Finaly, g∗ is an epimorphism if 
and only if g  is an epimorphism and g∗ is a monomorphism if and only if ker g∗= ker g/H  is the 
trivial subgroup of G/H  which happens when ker g = H.♦
3.5 Corollary. (First Isomorphism Theorem). Under the same hipotheses as the previous theorem 
G/ ker g ∼= im  g .
Proof. As g  is an epimorphism, im g = G′, then G/ ker g ∼= im  g .♦
In other words, if g : G ↠G′  is an epimorphism of groups with kernel ker  g , then there exists a 
unique isomorphism g∗: G/ ker g ∼= G′, such that g = g∗◦p , that is, any homomorpism of G  with 
kernel ker  g  has an image that is isomorphic to G/ ker g . Even more, it tells us that any epimorphism 
g : G ↠G′  has as its codomain a quotient group, that is, the codomain of g  is the quotient of the 
domain of g  modulo the kernel of g . It also tells us which isomorphism: that in which im g = im  g∗. 
This result, G/ ker g ∼= im  g  is known as the First Isomorphism Theorem. Given a group and a 
normal subgroup we can “determine” the quotient group without having to establish the cosets, as we 
will see later on.
3.6 Example. Let H  be a normal subgroup of a group G . Consider the quotient group G/H . Let 
i: H −→G  be an inclusion monomorphism and p: G −→G/H  the projection epimorphism. Then
im  i = H = ker p , hence:

is a short exact sequence. Consider now a short exact sequence
e
h
−→G′
f
−→G
g
−→G′′
k
−→e.
Then im  f = ker g , f  is a monomorphism (because e = im  h = ker f ) and g  is an epimorphism 
(because im  g = ker k = G′′). Let H = im f = ker g  which is a normal subgroup of G , then f  
establishes an isomorphism H
∼
=
−→G′  and g  establishes another isomorphism G/H
∼
=
−→G′′  by the 
first isomorphism theorem. Hence a short exact sequence is equivalent to a sequence of a subgroup and 
a quotient group of a group.
3.7 Example. g : G ↠G′  where G = Z  and G′ = Zn  is an epimorphism with the kernel being the 
subgroup nZ , that is, 
e −→nZ −→Z
g
−→Zn −→e
is a short exact sequence. Then, by the previous theorem, Z/nZ ∼= Zn .
3.8 Example. Let G  be the multiplicative group of real numbers different from zero R∗ and G′  is 
the multiplicative group of the positive reals P∗. Consider the epimorphism g : G ↠G′  given by 
x →g(x) = |x|  where |x|  denotes the absolute value of x . The kernel of g  is {±1}.  Then the 
sequence 
e −→{±1} −→R∗
g
−→P∗−→e
is exact. By the previous theorem, the quotien group R∗/{±1}  is isomorphic to P∗.
3.9 Example. Let G  be the additive group of the real numbers R  and G′  the multiplicative group of 
complex numbers S1 with absolute value equal to 1. Let g : G ↠G′  be the epimorphism given by 
θ →g(θ) = e2πiθ. Its kernel is Z . Then the sequence 
e −→Z −→R
g
−→S1 −→e
is exact and by the previous theorem, R/Z ∼= S1.
We will generalize the concept of coset:
3.10 Definition. Let H  and N  be any two subgroups of a group G . The product of H  and N  is 
HN = {xy|x ∈H, y ∈N} .

Isomorphism Theorems
Thus, a left coset is xH = {x}H, for x ∈G. We can generalize this concept and define, for a family 
of subgroups {Hi|i ∈I}  with I  a set of linearly ordered indices

i∈I
Hi = {x1x2x3 · · · xj|xk ∈Hik, i1 < i2 < · · · < ij, j ≥0}.
Observe that HN  is not necessarily a subgroup of G  because the product of the multiplication of two 
of its elements is not necessarily in HN. If G  is abelian then it is a subgroup of G.
3.11 
Theorem. 
(Second 
Isomorphism 
Theorem). 
Let 
H < G , 
N ◁G. 
Then 
(HN)/N ∼= H/(H ∩N).
Proof. As N ◁G, it is easy to see that (H ∩N) ◁H. Define 
h : HN −→H/(H ∩N) given by xy →h(xy) = x(H ∩N).
We will see that h  is well defined: Suppose that x1y1 = xy , then x−1x1 = yy−1
1 . Thus, x−1x1 ∈H  
and x−1x1 ∈N , then x−1x1 ∈H ∩N. Hence, in H/(H ∩N), x(H ∩N) = x1(H ∩N) and 
h(xy) = h(x1y1).

Isomorphism Theorems
We will verify that h  is a homomorphism. As N ◁G , x1y2 = y2x3. Then, 
h((x1y1)(x2y2)) = h((x1x2)(y3y2)) = x1x2(H ∩N) = x1(H ∩N)x2(H ∩N) =
h(x1y1)h(x2y2)
As ker h = {xy ∈HN|x ∈H ∩N} = N  and as h(xe) = x(H ∩N) for every x ∈H, using 
the First Isomorphism Theorem, HN/N ∼= H/(H ∩N).♦
3.12 Ejemplo. Consider 
G
=
Z × Z × Z × Z,
H
=
Z × Z × Z × {0} y
N
=
{0} × Z × Z × Z.
Then 
HN
=
Z × Z × Z × Z y
H ∩N
=
{0} × Z × Z×{0}.
Therefore, 
HN/N ∼= Z ∼= H/(H ∩N).
3.13 Theorem. (Third Isomorphism Theorem). Let H ◁G  and N ◁G  with N < H . Then, 
G/H ∼= (G/N)/(H/N).
Proof. We define 
h :
G −→(G/N)/(H/N) by
x −→(xN)(H/N).
As
h(xy)
=
((xy)N)(H/N) = ((xN)(yN))(H/N)
=
[(xN)(H/N)][(yN)(H/N)] = h(x)h(y),
h  is a homomorphism. Its kernel is ker  h = {k ∈G|h(k) = H/N}. These are, exactly, the elements 
of H. Using the First Isomorphism Theorem, G/H ∼= (G/N)/(H/N).

Isomorphism Theorems

Example. 
Consider 
N = 6Z < H = 2Z < G = Z . 
Then 
G/H = Z/2Z ∼= Z2. 
G/N = Z/6Z . We can see that, (Z/6Z)/(2Z/6Z) also has 2 elements and is isomorfic to Z2.
Problems
3.1 Prove that for every element x ∈G, the homomorphism
ιx :
G −→G given by
y →xyx−1
is an automorphism of G, called the inner automorphism.
3.2 Consider the set of all inner automorphisms of a group G , denoted In(G). Prove that it is a group 
under the operation of composition.
3.3 Consider the set Aut(G) of all automorphisms of the group G . Prove that Aut(G) is a group 
under composition and that In(G) ◁Aut(G). Two automorphisms f, g  are said to belong to the 
same “automorphism class” if f = h ◦g  for some automorphism h . Prove that the automorphism 
classes form a group Aut(G)/In(G) called “outer automorphisms of G”.
3.4 Provide the details, in the proof of Theorem 3.2, which show that g∗ is well defined. Prove, as well, 
that im g∗= p′(im  g) and ker  g∗= p(g−1(H′)).
3.5 Provide the complete details of the proof of Theorem 3.4.
3.6 We will call the quotient groups of a homomorphism of abelian groups g : G −→G′′, the coimage 
and cokernel, if 
coim g
=
G/ ker g
coker g
=
G′′/im g.
Let g : G −→G′′  be a homomorphism of abelin groups. Prove that the sequence 
e −→ker g −→G −→G′′ −→coker g −→e
is exact. Observe that, in this context, the First Isomorphism Theorem says that coim g ∼= im  g.
3.7 Prove that a group homomorphism g : G →G′′  is a monomorphism if and only if ker g = e  
and is a epimorphism if and only if coker g = e.
3.8 Verify that the sequences shown in the examples are, indeed, short exact sequences.

Recall that if H  and N are any two subgroups of a group G , the product of H  and N  is 
HN = {xy|x ∈H, y ∈N}  and for a family of subgroups {Hi|i ∈I}  with I  a set of linearly 
ordered indices

i∈I
Hi = {x1x2x3...xj|xk ∈Hik, i1 < i2 < · · · < ij, j ≥0}.
Recall that HN  is not necessarily a subgroup of G  because, if we multiply two of its elements, we do 
not always obtain an element in HN. If G  is abelian then HN  is a subgroup of G.
Consider a family of groups {Gi}. The external direct product of this family is 

i∈I
Gi = {(x1, ..., xn)|xi ∈Gi}
which has a group structure given by 
(x1, ..., xn)(y1, ..., yn) = (x1y1, ..., xnyn).
If we use additive notation, we write ⊕
i∈IGi  and we call it the external direct sum.

Example. The external direct sum 
Zm ⊕Zn
is used in Mathematical Music Theory to study the motifs in n -tempered scales with m-cyclic onsets. 
Specifically, 
p1 : Zm ⊕Zn →Zm,
(x, y) →x
is the first projection, a motif µ  in Zm ⊕Zn is an element of the power set5 ℘(Zm ⊕Zn) of Zm ⊕Zn 
such that p1(u) ̸= p1(v) for every u, v ∈µ . The idea is that, given an onset t , they should not coincide 
in more than one note.
For example, {(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4)} ⊆Z3 ⊕Z12 represent thel motif C, D, E (in this order) in a time 
signature of three, as can be seen in figure ?. On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4)} ⊆Z3 ⊕Z12 
is not a motif because p1(1, 2) = 1 = p1(1, 4), which means that at the onset 1 the pitches D and E 
coincide.

an element (x1, x2) = (h(1), h(2)) ∈G1 × G2 and that, inversely, a pair (x1, x2) ∈G1 × G2 
determines a function h : {1, 2} −→G1 ∪G2 given by h(1) = x1 and h(2) = x2. Thus, there exists 
a one to one correspondence between the set of all functions defined this way, and the group G1 × G2.
4.1 Theorem. Let G  be a group. Consider a family of groups {Gi}i∈I  and a family of homomorphisms

Hence ϕ = ϕ′ .♦

We will now see the case of two factors, in which a group G  is isomorphic to the weak external product 
of one of its subgroups.
4.3 Proposition. Let H  and N  be any two normal subgroups of a group G. If HN = G  and 
H ∩N = e  then H × N ∼= G.
Proof. As HN = G, if g ∈G, xy = g  with x ∈H, y ∈N.  We will see that x  and y  are determined 
in a unique way by g : because if g = x1y1 then xy = x1y1. Hence, x−1x1 = yy−1
1 . As this element 
is in the intersection of H  and N, x−1x1 = yy−1
1
= e . Therefore, x = x1 and y = y1.

Now we establish an isomorphism between H × N  and G. Define h : H × N −→G  given by 
(x, y) −→h(x, y) = xy . h  is a homomorphism because if we consider the commutator x−1y−1xy  
then (x−1y−1x)y ∈N  because N  is normal in G  and x−1(y−1xy) ∈H  because H  is normal in 
G. Hence, as x−1y−1xy  is in the intersection of H  and N, x−1y−1xy = e, then xy = yx. Thus, 
h((x1, y1)(x2, y2)) = h(x1x2, y1y2) = x1x2y1y2 = x1y1x2y2 = h(x1, y1)h(x2, y2). Finally, it is 
easy to see that h  is bijective (Problem 4.12).♦
4.4 Definition. We will say that a group G  is a direct product (internal) of H  and N  if H  and N  
are normal subgroups of G  such that HN = G  and H ∩N = e.
Observe that in this definition H  and N  are subgroups of G. If G = H × N  as the external direct 
product, we can consider G  as an internal direct product by the subgroups that are images of H  and 
N, that is, H × {1}  and {1} × N, but not of H  and N. Then it is clear the the two types of products 
provide, in reality, isomorphic groups and we just call it direct product.

Then Hom(

Proof. Define ρ  by ρ(ϕ) = (ϕιi)i∈I . It is clear that ρ  is a homomorphism. We will show that ρ  is

the homomorphism 0: Xi −→Y  is such that 0 = ϕ ◦ιi . Hence, ϕ = 0. Therefore, ker ρ = {0} . We 
will show that ρ  is an epimorphism: let (ϕi)i∈I ∈
i∈I Hom(Xi, Y ). Then we have ϕi : Xi −→Y  for 
every i ∈I. By the universal property of the direct sum, there exists a homomorphism ϕ: 
i∈I

such that ϕιi = ϕi  for each i ∈I . Thus, ρ(ϕ) = (ϕi)i∈I .♦

Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
Chapter 3
3.1	
Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
We will say that a group G  is finitely generated if it has a finite set of generators. The most important 
result about finitely generated abelian groups can be formulated in two ways, such that they provide 
“invariants”; then two groups will be isomorphic if and only if they have the same numerical invariants.
1.1 Theorem. Every finitely generated abelian group G  is isomorphic to the direct product of n  cyclic 
groups of order pλi
i  with r  infinite cyclic groups, where the pi  are prime numbers, not necessarily 
distinct, and the λi  are positive integers. The direct product is unique up to the order of its factors.
This means that G  looks like:
G ∼= Zpλ1
1 × ... × Zpλn
n × Z × ... × Z.
The second way of establishing this important result is:
1.2 Theorem. Every finitely generated abelian group G  is isomorphic to the direct product of n  cyclic 
groups of order mi  with r  infinite cyclic groups, where mi|mi+1 for 1 ≤i ≤n −1.
This means that G  looks like:
G ∼= Zm1 × ... × Zmn × Z × ... × Z.
The integers mi  are called torsion coefficients of G. These two theorems provide us with a classification, 
up to isomorphism, of all finitely generated abelian groups, that is, if we have a finitely generated abelian 
group, this should have the structure defined in the two previous theorems. As special cases, we have 
the following:
1.3 Theorem. (i) If G  is a finitely generated abelian group that does not have elements of finite order, 
then it is isomorphic to the direct product of a finite number of copies of Z  and (ii) If G  is a finite 
abelian group then it is isomorphic to a direct product of finite cyclic groups of order mi  where mi|mi+1 
for 1 ≤i ≤n −1.

Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
That is, in the case (i) G ∼= Z × ... × Z  with r  copies of Z  we say that G  is a free abelian group of 
rank r. In the case (ii) G ∼= Zm1 × ... × Zmn  where mi|mi+1 for 1 ≤i ≤n −1 the elements of the 
list m1, ..., mn are called invariant factorsof the group G. Two finite abelian groups are isomorphic 
if and only if they have the same invariant factors. A list can be made of all the non-isomorphic abelian 
groups of a certain order n . It is enough to find all the possible lists m1, ..., mn such that mi|mi+1 
for 1 ≤i ≤n −1 with product n. In conclusion, we have:
1.4 Theorem. Let G ∼= Zm1 × ... × Zmn × Z × ... × Z , with r  copies of Z , where mi|mi+1 for 
1 ≤i ≤n −1 y G′ ∼= Zk1 × ... × Zkj × Z × ... × Z , with s  copies of Z , where ki|ki+1 for 
1 ≤i ≤j −1. If G ∼= G′  then mi = ki  for 1 ≤i ≤n, n = j  and r = s.
Although the Primary Decomposition Theorem is studied in a Linear Algebra course (as in [Ll2]), due 
to the approach of this presentation of Group Theory (as a first course), directed towards the study of 
Homological Algebra and Algebraic Topology, we prefer to postpone the proofs of these theorems for a 
future course on Module Theory, and see these theorems as special cases of the corresponding theorems 
for finitely generated modules over a prinicpal ideal ring. This way we can present other topics that are 
usually excluded from an introductory text on Group Theory. The reader who is interested can consult 
the proofs in [B-M, Cap. X] or [H, Cap. II y IV]. Now we will see how these theorems are used.

Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
1.5 Example. All the possible finitely generated abelian groups of order 36 are obtained, using the first 
theorem, in the following manner: decompose 36 in powers of primes, such as 36 = 22 · 32. Then all 
the possible groups of the first way, (not isomorphic one to the other) are
Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z3,
Z4 × Z3 × Z3,
Z2 × Z2 × Z9,
Z4 × Z9
and, by the second way (not isomorphic one to the other) they are:
Z6 × Z6,
Z3 × Z12,
Z2 × Z18,
Z36.
In summary, we have four abelian groups (up to isomorphism) of order 36. The first ones on the list 
correspond to the order of those written in the second list.
1.6 Example. All possible finitely generated abelian groups of order 540 are obtained, the first way, by 
decomposing 540 in powers of primes as 540 = 22 · 33 · 5. Then, the possible groups (not isomorphic 
one to the other) are: 
Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z3 × Z3 × Z5,
Z4 × Z3 × Z3 × Z3 × Z5,
Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z9 × Z5,
Z2 × Z2 × Z27 × Z5,
Z4 × Z3 × Z9 × Z5,
Z4 × Z27 × Z5
and, by the second way (not isomorphic one to the other) are: 
Z3 × Z6 × Z30,
Z3 × Z3 × Z60,
Z2 × Z270,
Z6 × Z90,
Z3 × Z180,
Z540.

Thus, we have six abelian groups (up to isomorphism) of order 540. The ones in the first list correspond 
to the order of those written in the second list.
Consider a chain C = {Cn, ∂n}  of finitely generated abelian groups and the homology group of degree 
n  of C , Hn(C) = ker ∂n/im  ∂n+1 = Zn(C)/Bn(C).  The subgroups Zn(C) and Bn(C) of Cn 
are finitely generated, hence Hn(C) is finitely generated. The torsion coefficients of Hn(C) are called 
torsion coefficients of degree n  of C  and the rank of Hn(C) is called the Betti number βn(C) of 
degree n  of C. The integer χ(C) = 
n(−1)nβn(C) is called The Euler-Poincaré characteristic 
of the chain C.

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
Consider the set Σn that consists of all the permutations of the set In = {1, ..., n}, that is, Σn consists 
of all the bijective functions of In  onto In . In I.2 we saw that Σn is a grup under the binary operation 
◦ and that |Σn| = n! Recall Σ3 and its corresponding table as in I.1. Its elements are:

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
Let σ  be a permutation of Σn and define in In = {1, ..., n}  a relation given by i ≡j  if and only 
if σr(i) = j, for some integer r. It can be easily verified that this is an equivalence relation in In  
(Problem 2.4). The equivalence classes are called orbits of σ. For example, the orbit of the element 1 
of the permutacion

(1, 3, 6, 4, 11, 8, 7, 9, 10, 12)(2, 5)
is {1, 3, 6, 4, 11, 8, 7, 9, 10, 12} , and that of the element 2 is {2, 5}. Observe that if an orbit has more 
than one element, it then forms a cycle of length equal to the number of the elements in the orbit. Thus, if 
O1, ..., Ok  are the orbits (which are disjoint) of a permutation σ  and c1, ..., ck  are the cycles (disjoint) 
given by cj(i) = σ(i) if i ∈Oj  or i  if i /∈Oj  then σ = c1c2 · · · ck. Hence, we have the following
2.1 Proposition. Every permutation σ  can be written as the product of disjoint cycles.♦
Observe that the representation as a product of disjoint cycles is unique up to the order in which they 
are written. Clearly, the composition of two disjoint cycles is commutative and as every cycle can be 
expressed as (i1, i2, ..., ir) = (i1, ir)(i1, ir−1) · · ·(i1, i3)(i1, i2) we have the following
2.2 Corollary. Every permutation σ ∈Σn  for n ≥2 is a product of transpositions, not necessarily 
disjoint.♦
For example, 
(1, 3, 6, 4, 11, 8, 7, 9, 10, 12)(2, 5)
=
(1, 12)(1, 10)(1, 9)(1, 7)(1, 8)(1, 11)(1, 4)(1, 6)(1, 3)(2, 5).
Observe that, by decomposing a permutation as a product of transpositions, we can always add the 
identity transformation, written as(ij, ik)(ij, ik), in such a way that the decomposition is not unique.
2.3 Definition. We say that a group G  acts (on the left) on a set X if there exists a function
a :
G × X
−→
X,
(g, x)
→
a(g, x),
where 
a(g, x) 
will 
be 
denoted 
gx, 
such 
that 
(e, x) →a(e, x) = ex = x  
and 
(gg′, x) →a(gg′, x) = (gg′)x = g(g′x) hold.

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
If G  acts on X  we say that X  is a G -set. In the notation (g, x) →a(g, x) = gx , writing gx  is 
a common abuse of notation and is defined in a particular way in every case. An analogous definition 
can be given of a right action.
We will see some examples.
2.4 Example. Every group G  is a G-set with the binary operation seen as an action. Every group can 
be considered an H-set as well, with H  a subgroup of G, and here we have H × G −→G  given by 
(h, x) →a(h, x) = hx. This action is called translation (on the left). Every vector space V  over a 
field K  can be seen as a K -set where the multiplicative part of K  acts on V .
2.5 Example. In  is a Σn-set with the action a : Σn × In −→In  given by (σ, i) →a(σ, i) = σ(i).
2.6 Example. Considere an action of a subgroup H of G, a : H × G −→G  given by 
(h, x) →a(h, x) = hxh−1. This action is called conjugation by h. The element hxh−1 is called a 
conjugate of x.
Let X  be a G-set with a : G × X −→X. We say that two elements x, y ∈X  are related and we 
write x ∼y  if and only if there exists g ∈G  such that a(g, x) = gx = y  for some g ∈G.

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
2.7 Proposition. ∼ is an equivalence relation and the set 
	
Gx = {g ∈G|gx = x}
is a subgroup of G.
Proof. As, for every x ∈X, ex = x, then x ∼x. If x ∼y  then there exists g ∈G  such that 
gx = y  for some g ∈G. Then, x = ex = (g−1g)x = g−1(gx) = g−1y, thus y ∼x. If x ∼y  and 
y ∼z  then there exist g, g′ ∈G  such that gx = y  y g′y = z . Then (g′g)x = g′(gx) = g′y = z, 
thus x ∼z. Consider g, g′ ∈Gx.  Then gx = x  and g′x = x. Hence, (gg′)x = g(g′x) = gx = x. 
Therefore, gg′ ∈Gx. Clearly ex = x, so e ∈Gx. Finally, if g ∈Gx then gx = x  and 
x = ex = (g−1g)x = g−1(gx) = g−1x. Thus, g−1 ∈Gx. Hence Gx  is a subgroup of G.♦
The subgroup Gx  is called isotropy subgroup of x  or stabilizer of x. We will call each class of the 
equivalence relation ˜ the orbit of X  under G. If x ∈X  we will call the equivalence class of x  the 
orbit of x  and we will denote it as Gx.
We will give names to specific orbits:
(i) If a group G  acts on itself under conjugation, the orbit {gxg−1}  with g ∈G  will be called the 
conjugate class of x.
(ii) If the subgroup H < G  acts on G  by conjugation, the isotropy group Hx = {h ∈H : hx = xh}  
is called the centralizer of x  in H  and we will denote it as CH(x).
(iii) If H = G, CG(x) it will be called the centralizer of x.
(iv) If H < G  acts on the set of subgroups of G  by conjugation, then the subgroup of H  that leaves 
K fixed is called the normalizer of K  in H, denoted as NH(K) = {h ∈H|hKh−1 = K}.
(v) In particular, if we have the case in which H = G, that is, NG(K) we will just call it the normalizer 
of K.
2.8 Theorem. Let X  be a G-set a : G × X −→X. If x ∈X, then the number of equivalence classes, 
or orbits, is equal to the index of Gx  in G , that is, |Gx| = (G : Gx).
Proof. Define a function 
ω :
Gx
−→
G/Gx
given by
a(g, x) = gx = y
→
ω(a(g, x)) = ω(gx) = gGx.

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
We will see that ω  is well defined: suppose that a(h, x) = hx = y  for h ∈G  as well. Then gx = hx, 
g−1(gx) = g−1(hx) and x = (g−1h)x. Thus, g−1h ∈Gx, h ∈gGx and gGx = hGx .
Now we will see that ω  is injective: if y, z ∈Gx  and ω(y) = ω(z). Then there exists h, k ∈G  such 
that a(h, x) = hx = y  and a(k, x) = kx = z, with k ∈hGx. Then k = hg  for some g ∈Gx,  
then z = kx = (hg)x = h(gx) = hx = y. Therefore, ω  is injective.
We will see that ω  is surjective: let hGx  be a left coset. Then if hx = y, we have hGx = ω(y). Thus 
ω  is surjective. Therefore, |Gx| = (G : Gx).♦
2.9 Corollary. If o(G) is finite, then o(Gx)|o(G).
Proof. As o(G) Then o(G) = o(Gx)o(Gx).♦
Example. Define a chord S  as a subset of the scale Z12, that is S ∈℘(Z12). The group 
−→
GL(Z12) = {et · u : t ∈Z12, u ∈GL(Z12)}
is called the general affine group of Z12 (or group of affine symmetries of Z12) and acts on ℘(Z12) as 
α : −→
GL(Z12) × ℘(Z12) →℘(Z12),
(et · u, {x}) →{et · u(x)} = {ux + t}.
For example, the D minor chord6 {D, F, A} = {2, 5, 9}  can be transposed to E minor using e2 · 1, 
that is 
e2 · 1({D, F, A}) = e2 · 1({2, 5, 9})

Guerino Mazzola has calculated all the isotropy groups of the chords in Z12, and a table that summarizes 
this information can be found in the book The Topos of Music [M], in the appendix L. In particular, the 
isotropy group of a major chord is always trivial (that is, it is {e0 · 1}), and the cardinality of its orbit 
is |−→
GL(Z12)| = 48, with the same happening in the case of the minor chords. This means that, from 
the affine point of view, there are 48 major and minor chords in the orbit of each one of them or that, 
at the end, there really only exists one major (or minor) chord. On the other hand, an augmented chord 
A  (for example, Caug = {0, 4, 8}) has an isotropy group of cardinality 12. Thus, there are 
o(−→
GL(Z12)A) = o(−→
GL(Z12))
o(−→
GL(Z12)A)
= 48
12 = 4
elements in its orbit, and really twelve augmented chords from the affine point of view.

Permutations, Orbits and Sylow Theorems
2.10 Theorem. Let G  be a finite group, g ∈G  and Xg = {x ∈X|gx = x}. If n  is the number of 
orbits of X  in G  then n = 
g∈G
|Xg|o(G)−1.
Proof. Let r  be the number of pairs (g, x) such that gx = x.  There are |Xg|  pairs for every g  and 
|Gx|  for every x. Then 
r =

g∈G
|Xg| =

x∈X
|Gx|.
As o(Gx) = (G : Gx) = o(G)/o(Gx) by the previous theorem, then o(Gx) = o(G)/o(Gx). Hence, 
r = 
x∈X
(|G|/|Gx|) = |G| 
x∈X
(1/|Gx|). However, 1/|Gx|  is the same for every x  in the same orbit 
and if O  denotes any orbit, then 
x∈O
(1/|Gx|) = 
x∈O
(1/|O|) = 1. Substituting, we obtain r = o(G)n.♦
Example. We denote Z12 ⊕Z12 as Z2
12 and consider the group

and its action on the motifs in Z2

this action on these motifs and, in particular, the number of classes of the 72 element motifs. According 
to his calculations, this number is

2.11 Proposition. Let X be a G-set. The function
ω :
G
−→
ΣX
g
→
ω(g) = σg(x) = gx
is a homomorphism. 
Proof. We will see that σg : X −→X  is, indeed, a permutation: If σg(x) = σg(y), then gx = gy. 
Thus g−1(gx) = g−1(gy) and (g−1g)x = (g−1g)y. Hence, ex = ey  and x = y. Therefore, σg is 
injective.
As σg(g−1x) = g(g−1x) = (gg−1)x = ex = x, for each x  there exists g−1x  such that σg(g−1x) = x. 
Thus, σg is surjective. ω  is a homomorphism since
ω(gg′)
=
σgg′(x) = (gg′)x = g(g′x) = gσg′(x)
=
σg(σg′(x)) = ω(g)(σg′(x)) = ω(g)ω(g′).♦
2.12 Corollary. (Cayley) If G  is a group then there exists a monomorphism G −→ΣG , that is, every 
group is isomorphic to a group of permutations. If G  is a finite group of order n  then it is isomorphic 
to a subgroup of Σn.
Proof. Consider the action of G  on itself by left translation and apply the previous proposition, obtaining 
ω :
G
−→
ΣG given by
g
→
ω(g) = σg(x) = gx.
If ω(g) = σg(x) = gx = IG, then σg(x) = gx = x  for every x ∈G. If we take x = e  then ge = e  
and g = e. Thus, ω  is a monomorfphism. As a particular case, if o(G) = n  then ΣG = Σn.
Another way of writing this is the following: Let 
	
H = {σg : G −→G|x →σg(x) = gx, for every ﬁxed g ∈G }

be a candidate for the subgroup of ΣG. σg : G −→G  is clearly a permutation 
of G , because if σg(x) = σg(y) then 
gx = gy  and x = y ; also, if x ∈G  then 
σg(g−1x) = gg−1x = x . It can be verified immediately that H is a subgroup of ΣG  because 
σg ◦σg′(x)) = σg(g′x) = g(g′x) = (gg′)x = σgg′(x) for every x ∈G, as σe(x) = ex = x  for 
every x ∈G, H  contains the identity permutation and, finally, as σgσg′ = σgg′, σgσg−1 = σgg−1 = σe 
y σg−1σg = σg−1g = σe we see that σg−1 = (σg)−1. Now, define 
h
:
G −→H by
g
→
h(g) = σg.
As 
h(gg′)(x) = σgg′(x) = (gg′)x = g(g′x) = σg(σg′(x)) = (σgσg′)(x)) = h(g)h(g′)
h  is a homomorphism. If h(g) = h(g′) then, in particular, σg(e) = ge = g = g′ = g′e = σg′(e), 
thus g = g′  and h  es inyective. Hence h  is an isomorphism.♦
The Sylow theorems provide us with important information about finite non-commutative groups. They 
tell us, among other things, that if the power of a prime divides the order of a group, this group has a 
subgroup of that order.
2.13 Definition. A group G  is called a p -group ( p  a prime number), if all the elements of G  have 
the order of a power of p.
2.14 Theorem. (First Sylow Theorem)) Let G  be a group of order pnm  where p  is prime, n ≥1 
and such that p ∤m.  Then, G  contains a subgroup of order pi  for every i  such that 1 ≤i ≤n, and 
every subgroup H  of G  of order pi  is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of order pi+1 for 1 ≤i < n.
2.15 Definition. Let p  be prime number. We say that P  is a Sylow p -subgrupo of G  if P  is a 
maximum p -subgroup of G, i.e., if K  is a p -group such that P < K < G  then P = K.
2.16 Theorem. (Second Sylow Theorem) Two Sylow p -subgroups of a finite group G  are conjugates.
2.17 Theorem. (Third Sylow Theorem) If G  is a finite group and p|o(G) ( p  prime), then the number 
of Sylow p -subgroups of G  divides the order of G  and is congruent with 1 modulo p.
See [A] or [F] for the proofs of the Sylow theorems.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Consider the Cartesian product A = X × Z2 where X  denotes any set and Z2 = {−1, 1} . For each 
element x  of X  we will use the notation x1 = (x, 1) and x−1 = (x, −1). Consider the set K of all 
the finite sequences of elements with repetition of the set A. Define a binary operation on K  
K × K
→
K,
(x1, ..., xr)(y1, ..., ys)
→
(x1, ..., xr, y1, ..., ys).
We will call the elements of A  the alphabet, and the elements of K  words, which are formal products 
of the elements of A.

Example. 
Take 
X = {x1, x2, x3, x4} . 
The

We say that a word is reduced if, for every element x  of X, x1 is never next to x−1 or viceversa. Let 
L  be the set of all reduced words of K  and add the empty word (which is not in K) and which we 
will denote as 1.
Now we will define a binary operation on L  with the following conditions: if one of the elements x  
or y  is 1, then their product is x  or y ; if this is not the case, their product is a reduced word xy . It 
can be proved that this binary operation provides L  with a group structure.
3.2 Definition. A free group on a set X  is a pair (L, f) where L  is a group and f : X −→L  is a 
function such that, for any function g : X −→G , G  some group, there exists a unique homomorphism 
h : L −→G  such that the following triangle is commutative:

We define a function f : X −→L  by f(x) = x1 ∈L . Suppose that g : X −→G  is any function 
of X into a group G. Define a function h : L −→G  by 
h(k)

It is easy to prove that h  is a group homomorphism such that h ◦f = g . If h′ : L −→G  is another

h′(k) = h′(x1)η1h′(x2)η2 · · · h′(xn)ηn = g(x1)η1g(x2)η2 · · · g(xn)ηn. Hence, h = h′. Thus we have 
the following
3.3 Theorem. For every set X  there always exists a free group on X .♦
Consider a free group on the set X  denoted (L, f), where f : X −→L  is a function. We see that such 
a function f  is injective: Suppose that x, y ∈X  with x ̸= y . Consider a group G  and g : X −→G  
a function such that g(x) ̸= g(y). As h(f(x)) = g(x) ̸= g(y) = h(f(y)) we see that f(x) ̸= f(y). 
We can also see that f(X) generates L : let H  be the subgroup of L  generated by f(X). Then f  
defines a function g : X −→H  with i ◦g = f, where i  denotes the inclusion of H  in L . As L  is 
free, there exists a homomorphism h : L −→H  such that h ◦f = g .

It is clear that IL ◦f = f , and i ◦h ◦f = i ◦g = f. By uniqueness, i ◦h = IL . Thus, i  is surjective. 
Thus, H = G  and f(X) generates L .
Suppose that (L′, g) is another free group on the same set X  as L . Then we can consider the following

Here, as L  is free, there exists a unique homomorphism h  such that g = h ◦f  and as L′  is also

Analogously we can consider the diagram

and obtain IL′ = h ◦h′ . Thus, L ∼= L′ . We can summarize the preceeding analysis in the following
3.4 Theorem. Let (L, f) be a free group on X . Then f  is injective and f(X) generates L . (L, f) 
is unique up to isomorphism.♦
Observe that every set X  determines a unique free group. As f  is injective, identify X  with its image 
and f(X) is a subset generated by L. We can say that every function g : X −→G  extends to a 
unique homomorphism h : L −→G . We will call L  the free group generated by the elements of 
the set X. Observe that every free group is infinite.
Let G  be any group. We can choose a subset X  of G  that generates G. We always can, because 
we can choose X = G. Consider the free group generated by X . Then the inclusion function 
g : X −→G  extends to a homomorphism h : L −→G. h  is surjective because X  generates G  
and X = g(X) ⊂h(L). If N  is the kernel of h, by the first isomorphism theorem, G ∼= L/N . We 
can summarize this in the following
3.5 Theorem. Every group is isomorphic to the quotient of a free group.♦

Free Groups
Denote the set of generators of a subgroup N  of a free group L, as R. As the group L  is totally 
determined by the set X  and the normal subgroup N  is determined by the set R , the group G ∼= L/N  
can be defined by a set whose elements we will call generators of G  and by a set R  whose elements 
we will call relations that define G .
Consider a reduced word k = xη1
1 xη2
2 · · · xηn
n ̸= 1, that is, an element of R  such that, if N  is not a 
trivial subgroup, we will omit the identity (1) from the set R . As k ∈N , it represents the identity 
element in the quotient. We will denote it by the expression xη1
1 xη2
2 · · · xηn
n = 1.
We will say that the sets X  and R  form a presentation (X|R) of the group G ∼= L/N . There can 
be different presentations of the same group. In such cases we will call them isomorphic presentations.
3.6 Example. The dihedral group Dn  n ≥2, is the group of order 2n  generated by two elements  
a  and b  with relations an = 1, b2 = 1 and bab = a−1.
3.7 Example. (x| ) is a presentation of the free group Z. That is, a generator, but no relations. That is 
the reason behind the term free, that is, free of relations.
3.8 Example. (x|xn = e) is a presentation of the cyclic group Zn .
3.9 Definition. A free abelian group in the set X  is a pair (L, f) where L  is an abelian group and 
f : X −→L  is a function such that, for any function g : X −→G , G  any abelian group, there 
exists a unique homomorphism h : L −→G  such that the following triangle commutes:

The following two theorems are proved in the same way as those that correspond to free groups:
3.10 Theorem. Let (L, f) be a free abelian group on X. Then f  is injective and f(X) generates L . 
(L, f) is unique up to isomorphism.♦
3.11 Theorem. Any abelian group is isomorphic to the quotient of a free abelian group.♦
3.12 Theorem. For any set X  there always exists a free abelian group on X.
Proof. Let (K, i : X →K) be a free group on a set X. Consider the quotient group L = K/K′ where 
K′  denotes the commutator subgroup, and the projection of this quotient group p : K →K/K′. We 
see that (L, f) is a free abelian group on X, f = p ◦i.

Let g : X →G  be any function of X  into an abelian group G. As K  is a free group on X, there exists 
a homomorphism k : K →G  such that k ◦i = g. As G  is an abelian group, k  sends the commutator 
subgroup K′  of K  to the element 0 of G. Thus, k  induces a homomorphism h : L →G  such that 
h ◦p = k.  Hence h ◦p ◦i = k ◦i = g. The uniqueness is immediate and we leave it as an exercise.♦
As the function f = p ◦i  is injective, we can identify X  with its image f(X) in L. Then X  is a 
subset of L  that generates L . We say that a function g  extends to a unique homomorphism h  and we 
call L  a free abelian group generated by (the elements) of the set X. We assert that any group G  is a 
free abelian group, if it is isomorphic to a free abelian group L  generated by a set X. If f ′ : L →G  
and we denote the restriction of f  to X  as f, then (G, f) is a free abelian group on the set X. We call 
the image f(X) the basis of the free abelian group G. It is clear that every function g : f(X) →H, 
where H  is any abelian group, extends to a unique homomorphism h : G →H. (Problem 3.3).
3.13 Example. Consider the group that consists of the direct sum of n  copies of Z. Then (1, 0, ..., 0), 
(0, 1, 0, ...0),..., (0, ..., 0, 1) is a basis of that free abelian group. The group of the integers modulo 
n  is not free abelian.

Verify that h  is a group homomorphism such that h ◦f = g  in the context of Theorem 3.3.
3.3 We say that any group G  is a free abelian group, if it is isomorphic to a free abelian group L  
generated by a set X . If f ′ : L →G  and we denote the restriction of f ′  to X  as f, then (G, f) 
is a free abelian group on the set X. We will call the image f(X) the basis of the free abelian 
group G. Prove that every function g : f(X) →H  where H  is any abelian group extends to a 
unique homomorphism h : G →H.
3.4 We say that a free abelian group has finite or infinite rank if it has a finite or infinite basis, respectively. 
Show that if a basis is finite with n  elements (infinite), then any other basis is also finite with n  
elements (infinite).
3.5 Let L  and L′  be isomorphic abelian groups generated by X  and X′  respectively. Show that if X  
consists of a finite number of elements, then X′  consists of the same number of elements..
3.6 Let {Gj}j∈X  be a family of abelian groups indexed by the set X  with every Gj ∼= Z, j ∈X. 
Define L = {α : X →Z | α(j) = 0 for almost every j ∈X}  together with a binary operation 
given by (α + β)(j) = α(j) + β(j) j ∈X.
1.	 Prove that L  is an abelian group.
2.	 Define f : X →L  as j →f(j)(i) = 1 if i = j, 0 if i ̸= j. Show that (L, f) is a free 
abelian group on X.
3.	 Prove that 

j∈X Gj ∼= (L, f).

Tensor Product
We will define an abelian group in which there are only biadditive relations.
4.1 Definition. Let X  and Y  be abelian groups. The tensor product of X  and Y  is the pair (T, f), 
where T  is an abelian group and f : X × Y →T  is a biadditive function, such that, if G  is an abelian 
group and g : X × Y →G  is biadditive, then there exists a unique homomorphism h: T →G  such 
that g = h ◦f .
The condition g = h ◦f  can be represented by the diagram
X × Y
f
−→
T
g ↘
↙h
G
The previous definition tells us that any biadditive function g : X × Y →G  can be expressed in terms 
of f : X × Y →T  as g(x, y) = h(f(x, y)) for a unique homomorphism h: T →G.

Tensor Product
We will see that the tensor product of two abelian groups, if it exists, is unique. That is, given two 
tensor products (T, f) and (T ′, f ′) of X  and Y  there exists an isomorphism between T  and T ′ . 
This is immediate because, as T  is a tensor product , there exists h: T →T ′  such that f ′ = h ◦f . 
Analogously, as T ′  is a tensor product, there exists h′ : T ′ →T  such that f = h′ ◦f ′ . Consider the 
following diagrams
T
f ↗
↓h
X × Y
f′

T ′
f ↘
↓h′
T
T ′
f ↗
↓h′

f
−→
T
f′ ↘
↓h
T ′
As T  is a tensor product, and 1T : T →T  is such that 1T ◦f = f  we see that h′ ◦h ◦f = f  as 
well. Thus, by uniqueness, we have h′ ◦h = 1T . Similarly, as T ′  is a tensor product, and 1T ′ : T ′ →T ′  
is such that 1T ′ ◦f ′ = f ′  and h ◦h′ ◦f ′ = f ′  as well, by uniqueness we see that h ◦h′ = 1T ′. 
Hence, h  is an isomorphism. Then we can identify the tensor product of T  of X  and denote it as 
T = X ⊗Y  or, simply, X ⊗Y .
Now we will see that, given two abelian groups, their tensor product always exists
4.2 Proposition. Let X  and Y  be two abelian groups. Then there exists and abelian group T  that 
fulfills the previous definition.
Proof. Let L  be a free abelian group with basis X × Y  and let G  be a subgroup of L  generared by 
the elements (x + x′, y) −(x, y) −(x′, y) and (x, y + y′) −(x, y) −(x, y′) where x, x′ ∈X  and 
y, y′ ∈Y. Define X ⊗Y = T = L/G . Denote as x ⊗y  the coset (x, y) + G . It can be shown 
immediately that X × Y →X ⊗Y , given by f(x, y) = x ⊗y  is biadditive, (Problem 4.1). We will 
se that X ⊗Y  is, indeed, a tensor product. Let G′  be an abelian group. Consider the triangle
X × Y
f
−→
T
g ↘
↙h′
G′
where g  is biadditive. As L  is free with basis X × Y , there exists a homomorphism h′ : L →G  such 
that g = h′ ◦f . It is easy to see that h′  is annihilated by the generators of G. Hence, G ⊂ker h′ , and 
induces a homomorphism h: L/G →G′  such that the following triangle commutes:

It is easy to show that h  is unique (Problem 4.1).♦
For every x ∈X  and y ∈Y , the element f(x, y) will be written as x ⊗y . It can be shown (Problem 
4.2) that f(X × Y ) generates the tensor product T , which we will denote as X ⊗Y . Then, every 
element of X ⊗Y  can be written as 
r
i=1 λi(xi ⊗yi) with λi ∈Z , xi ∈X , yi ∈Y . This expression 
is not unique because different representatives can be chosen from a coset. Due to this, we can define 
X ⊗Y  alternatively as the abelian group generated by all the symbols x ⊗y , x ∈X , y ∈Y , subject 
to the relations 
(x1 + x2) ⊗y
=
x1 ⊗y + x2 ⊗y,
x ⊗(y1 + y2)
=
x ⊗y1 + x ⊗y2.
This expression is not unique because, by the biadditivity of f, we have
(x1 + x2) ⊗y
=
(x1 ⊗y) + (x2 ⊗y),
x ⊗(y1 + y2)
=
(x ⊗y1) + (x ⊗y2),
where 
x1, x2, x ∈X  
and 
y1, y2, y ∈Y . 
As 
a 
particular 
case 
we 
have 
that, 
for 
λ ∈Z, (λx) ⊗y = λ(x ⊗y) = x ⊗(λy). 
If 
λ = −1 
we 
can 
see 
that 
(−x) ⊗y = −(x ⊗y) = x ⊗(−y) and if λ = 0 it can be seen that 0 ⊗y = 0 = x ⊗0. Hence, any 
element of X ⊗Y  can be written as 
r

i=1
(xi ⊗yi)
where xi ∈X, yi ∈Y .
The biadditive function f  is called the universal biadditive function (any other biadditive function 
g : X × Y →G  is obtained from f ). We say the due to the universal property, the abelian group 
X ⊗Y  is determined uniquely up to isomorphism.
Let ϕ: X′ →X, ψ: Y ′ →Y  be homomorphisms of abelian groups

Thus 
(ϕ ⊗ψ)(x ⊗y) = ϕ(x) ⊗ψ(y), x ∈X′, y ∈Y ′.

(ϕ′ ◦ϕ) ⊗(ψ′ ◦ψ) = (ϕ′ ⊗ψ′) ◦(ϕ ⊗ψ).
In particular, the following propositions are immediate.
4.3 Proposition. Let ψ: Y ′ →Y  and ψ′ : Y →Y ′′  be homomorphisms of abelian groups and X  
an abelian group. Then
(i) if 1X : X →X  and 1Y : Y →Y  are identity homomorphisms then 1X ⊗1Y  is the identity of 
X ⊗Y , and
(ii) (1X ⊗ψ′) ◦(1X ⊗ψ) = (1X ⊗(ψ′ ◦ψ)).♦
We can show these properties with the following diagram:

1.	 if 1X : X →X  and 1Y : Y →Y  are the identity homomorphisms, then 1X ⊗1Y  is the

As 
(1X ⊗ψ′)(1X ⊗ψ) = (1X ⊗ψ′ψ) = 1X ⊗0 = 0
we can see that im(1X ⊗ψ) ⊂ker(1X ⊗ψ′). It remains to verify that (1X ⊗ψ) ⊃ker(1X ⊗ψ′), 
which we will leave to the reader, as well as part (ii).♦
The previous result is the best we can obtain. For example, is we consider an exact sequence

where 2.  denotes the multiplication by two, when the tensor product is constructed with Y = Z/2 
we obtain

which is equivalent to

but 2∗ is not injective.
Now we will establish some properties of the tensor product.
4.7 Proposition. Let Y  be an abelian group. Then Y ⊗Z ∼= Y ∼= Z ⊗Y .
Proof. Let g : Y × Z →Y  be the biadditive function given by g(y, λ) = λy , λ ∈Z , y ∈Y . Then 
there exists a unique homomorphism h: Y ⊗Z →Y  such that h ◦f = g , that is, the following

The biadditive function g  is surjective because g(y, 1) = 1 · y = y . As h ◦f = g  then h  is surjective.
We will see that h  is injective: sea x ∈Y ⊗Z . Then there exist elements {yi}n

thus 
h(x) = h(y ⊗1) = h(f(y, 1)) = g(y, 1) = 1 · y = y.
If h(y ⊗1) = 0 then y = 0 and x = y ⊗1 = 0. Hence, h  es inyective. The proof that Y ∼= Z ⊗Y  
is left to the reader(Problem 4.5).♦

Proof. Consider the biadditive function 
g′′: X × Y →X ⊗Y ⊗Z
given by g′′(x, y) = x ⊗y ⊗w  for w ∈Z  fixed, which induces a homomorphism 
hw : X ⊗Y →X ⊗Y ⊗Z
such that 
hw(x ⊗y) = x ⊗y ⊗w.

The function g  is biadditive and induces a homomorphism h: (X ⊗Y ) ⊗Z →X ⊗Y ⊗Z

h((x ⊗y) ⊗w) = x ⊗y ⊗w.
We now construct a function

such that h′ ◦h = 1(X⊗Y )⊗Z  and h ◦h′ = 1X⊗Y ⊗Z . To construct h′  consider the function

g′  is linear in each variable, thus induces a homomorphism

It is easily verified that h′ ◦h = 1(X⊗Y )⊗Z  and that h ◦h′ = 1X⊗Y ⊗Z  thus, h  and h′  are

Musical Background
Chapter 4
A detailed exposition of some applications of Group Theory toMusic Theory will be made in this chapter. 
Some basic applications of Mathematical Music Theory will be explained and, in the process, we hope to 
contribute theoretical and analytical elements to readers with different backgrounds, both in Mathematics 
as well as Music. With this in mind, the examples follow from some of the most important theoretical 
aspects of the previous chapters; the musical terms and concepts are introduced as they are needed, so 
that a reader, without a musical background can understand the essence of how Group Theory is used 
to explain certain pre-established musical relations. For the reader with knowledge of Music Theory, 
this chapter provides concrete elements, as well as motivation, to begin to comprehend Group Theory.
A goal of Music Theory is to describe the possibilities of a pitch system. A pitch is the sound that is heard 
and that, usually, is associated to frequencies of vibrations. Traditionally, the study of the intervals between 
pitches was done using the frequency ratios of the powers of small integers. Modern Mathematical 
Music Theory offers an independent way of understanding pich systems by considering the intervals as 
transformations. In this chapter we will explore and develop some aspects of Neo-Riemannian Theory, in 
particular the duality of the TI and PLR groups. The content of this chapter is based on [CFS] and [DP].

Musical Background
4.1	
Musical Background
The twelve pitches of our modern system use the names of the first 7 letters of the alphabet. Each letter 
represents a different frequency and the letters are repeated when the frequency of a pitch is doubled. 
The range of pitches which begin with a frequencey, until it is doubled, is known as an octave. By 
convention, the octave is divided into 12 equal intervals, from which we obtain a set of 12 pitches, such 
that the frequency of each pitch results from multiplying the previous one by 
12√
2. This is known as 
equal tempered tuning. Previous to equal tempered tuning, musicians used, among others, just tuning, 
which is a system whose notes have frequencies that are related by ratios of integers. In equal tempered 
tuning, the difference in frequency between each note is called a semitone. With only 7 letters and 12 
notes, the symbol ♯ is used to denote a pitch that is a semitone above the original and the symbol ♭ to 
denote a pitch that is a semitone below the original. For example, if we take the pitch G, then the note 
that is above by a semitone would be G ♯ and the note that is below by a semitone would be G♭. The 
complete set of twelve notes is called the chromatic scale and is denoted, musically, as follows: 
C, C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯, A, A♯, B.
As was previously mentioned, two successive notes differ by a semitone. The note that is a semitone 
above G is G ♯, although this same note is a semitone below A and can be denoted as A♭. This property 
of notes possessing multiple names in equal tempered tuning is known as harmonic equivalence. This 
is shown together with the frequency values of each pitch (beginning with middle C8 and the eleven 
notes that follow it) in the table 4.1.
Table 1: Frecuencies of the notes in the central octave.
As all multiples of a certain frequency are represented by the same letter, it is mathematically convenient 
to represent the set of twelve notes by the integers modulo 12 (Z12), where each element is a class and 
represents an infinite set of numbers. According to the literature on Mathematical Music Theory, we 
will assign number to the letters, as is shown in the figure 4.1.

Figure 1: Notes assigned to the elements of Z12.
This assignment is not rigid, and it is valid to assign 0 to any of the 12 notes. In this chapter, we are 
interested in sets of notes that are played simultaneously. These sets of notes are known as chords. We 
will concentrate, in particular, on the group of chords known as triads, that is, sets of 3 notes that are 
played simultaneously.
Now, there are 12
3

= 220 subsets of 3 notes of the set of 12 notes. However, we will limit ourselves 
to the study of sets of 3 elements that are known as major and minor chords.
The three notes of a triad are called the root, the third and the fifth, respectively. Each triad has the name 
of its root. However, in our work the triads are sets and the order is not important (except to identify 
the root, of course). The major and minor chords are defined as follows:

Musical Background
Definition 1 We will say the the chord {a, b, c} ∈℘(Z12) is a major chord if b = a + 4 and 
c = a + 7. 
The major chords, in this order, are in the root position and are designated with upper case letters, such 
as G♯= {8, 0, 3} .In the case of G ♯, the root is G♯= 8, the third is B♯= 0, and the fifth is D ♯= 3.
In spite of this musical observation, in the mathematical work with the triads (that are sets of three 
elements) we insist that the order does not matter: sometimes it will be more useful to refer to G♯ as, 
say, {3, 0, 8} . The same is true for the minor chords that are defined as follows.
Definition 2 We say that a chord {a, b, c} ∈℘(Z12) is a minor chord if b = a + 3 and c = a + 7. 
The minor chords in this order are also in root position, and will be denoted with lower case letters, for 
example, f = {5, 8, 0} . Now that we have defined the elements, we will refer to them as pitch class triads. 
Definition 3 The complete set of the 24 major and minor chords will be denoted as M. Specífically,
M = {{x, x + 3, x + 7}, {X, X + 4, X + 7}|x, X ∈Z12}.
We willl emphasize, once again, that chords are sets and, for this reason, are not ordered. In other 
words: by definitions 1 and 2 if the set {5, 8, 0}  is written in another order, say, {0, 8, 5} , there is no 
difference because both sets represent the F minor chord. The F minor chord is formed by playing the 
notes F, A♭, and C simultaneously. If we take {0, 8, 5} , we are still be indicating that the notes C, A♭, 
and F will be played together, forming the F minor chord. Hence, the root position of the chord (as in 
the definitions ? and ?) shows how the components of the chord will be included, but the individual 
notes can be distributed many ways without changing the identity of the chord.
There is a detail that should be considered with respect to the term “triad of pitch classes”. It should be 
clear with which elements we are working because, up until now, we have refered to the triad of pitch 
classes just as a triad. However, an element x  in M  is a tríad, where x = {a, b, c} , and a, b, c ∈Z12. 
This notation is used because it is comfortable and simple, but to be precise we must remember that 
Z12 is a set of cosets: 
Z12 = {[0], [1], . . ., [11]},
where
^3` @ i= = = >57> 45> 3> 45> 57> = = =j>

Musical Background
Therefore, a ∈Z12, really means that [a] ∈Z12. We call them pitch classes because every note from 
C to B represents all multiples of those pitches, in the same way that every coset in Z12 represents all 
the numbers modulo 12 of which they are multiples. For this reason, when reading x = {a, b, c} , 
we are really reading [x] = {[a], [b], [c]} . Hence, this idea is extended from pitch classes to triads of 
pitch classes, where all the elements in M  are also classes. As an example, take the C major chord, 
x = {0, 4, 7}. If C major is seen as a class of triads, it whould be represented in the following way: 
C = [x] = {[0], [4], [7]} = {. . . , {−12, −8, −5}, {0, 4, 7}, {12, 16, 19}, · · ·}.
Now that we have clarified the difference between the basic elements and the classes, we will continure 
denoting [x] with x, for simplicity.

The T and I Transformations
4.2	
The T and I Transformations
In Music Theory, transposition refers to the process of translating a pitch, or set of pitches, by a constant 
interval. The musical definition of this transformation can be translated directly into the definition of a 
mathematical transformation.
2.1 Definition. Let x ∈M, where x = {a, b, c}. A transposition is a function Tn : M →M  given 
by 
Tn(x) = x + n = {a + n, b + n, c + n},
where n ∈Z.
Tn  can only be applied to the 24 elements (triads) in M , but there is an infinite amount of transpositions 
of any triad because n ∈Z. However, after having transposed any triad 12 times, the same sequence of 
triads is obtained once again. For example:
T0(C)
T0({0, 4, 7}) = {0, 4, 7}
T1(C)
T1({0, 4, 7}) = {1, 5, 8}
...
T12(C)
T12({0, 4, 7}) = {0, 4, 7} = T0(C)
T13(C)
T13({0, 4, 7}) = {1, 5, 8} = T1(C)
...
T0 behaves like the identity function and, for every triad, there are at most 12 different transpositions.

The T and I Transformations
We can see the transpositions, geometrically, as the rotations of a triangle through 12 points equally 
distributed in a circle. The three vertices of the triangle represent all the pitches of the triad. For example, 
the C major chord {0, 4, 7}  is situated in the upper left corner of the figure 4.2. Then the three vertices, 
or pitches, are rotated towards the right, one by one. The figure 4.2 presents the process of applying 
Tn({0, 4, 7}), for every 0 ≤n < 12, to the C major chord.
2.2 Definition. Let x ∈M , where x = {a, b, c} . An inversion is a function In : M →M  given by 
In(x) = −x + n = {−A + n, −B + n, −C + n}
where n ∈Z .
 Figure 4.2: The twelve transpositions of the C major {0, 4, 7} triad.
As in the case of the transpositions, there are 24 tríads to invert and an infinite number of inversions 
of each triad. However, once again, when we invert a triad and then transpose it 12 times, we are back 
to the starting point, and the same sequence is obtained when we begin again. For example:

Once again it can be seen that for each triad there are no more than 12 different inversions. In contrast with 
the geometric representation of the transposition, the representation that corresponds to the inversion 
is relatively more descriptive. All the inversions can be ilustrated as reflections of triangles with respect 
to the vertical axis that passes through 0 and 6 in the circle. At first sight, thefigure ? does not present 
the 12 inversions of {0, 4, 7} . With the intention of illustrating the reflections, the figure presents the 
inverted form of every major triad. However, each one of these triads is, at the end, a transposition of 
the original triad {0, 4, 7} . In other words, if each one of the triads of the figure 4.2 is reflected, the 
ones from the figure 4.3 are obtained.
2.3 Proposition. For every n, k ∈Z , such that n ≡k mod 12, 
Tn = Tk
and
In = Ik
Proof. As n ≡k mod 12, then n = 12q + k , for some q ∈Z . Hence 
Tn = T12q+k = T12q ◦Tk = (T0)q ◦Tk = (i)q ◦Tk = Tk
where i  is the identity transformation (or the translation by 0) and 
In = I12q+k
∗= T12q ◦Ik = (T0)q ◦Ik = (i)q ◦Ik = Ik;
the equality marked with an asterisc will be shown in lemma 4.2.♦
2.4 Definition. The set of all the transposition and inversion functions is denote as TI, and is defined as: 
TI = {Tn, In|n = 0, . . . , 11}.
It turns out that we can represent all these elements in a more compact form if we analyze the four 
possibile compositions of the T and I functions.
2.5 Lemma. In the TI set there exist the following relations: 
Tm ◦Tn = Tm+n mod 12,
Tm ◦In = Im+n mod 12,
Im ◦Tn = Im−n mod 12,
Im ◦In = Tm−n mod 12.

Proof. For the first equality we have 
Tm ◦Tn = Tm(Tn({a, b, c}))
= Tm({a + n, b + n, c + n})
= {a + n + m, b + n + m, c + n + m}
= {a + (m + n), b + (m + n), c + (m + n)}
= Tm+n mod 12
whereas for the second 
Tm ◦In = Tm(In({a, b, c}))
= Tm({−a + n, −b + n, −c + n})
= {−a + n + m, −b + n + m, −c + n + m}
= {−a + (m + n), −b + (m + n), −c + (m + n)}
= Im+n mod 12.
The proof of the other two equalities is left as an exercise for the reader. ♦
If the functions of the TI set are applied consecutively to any triad in M, all of the set M  is reproduced. 
We reiterate that the figures 4.2 and 4.3 show the result of applying all the functions of T and I to 
C = {0, 4, 7} .
It is left to the reader to show, in the exercises, that the functions in T  and I  are well defined.

The T and I Transformations
2.6 Theorem. The TI set forms a group under composition.
Proof. 
1.	 For all f, g ∈TI, f ◦g = h ∈TI, by the lemma 4.2, then TI  is closed under 
composition.
2.	 The following is satisfied
T0 ◦Tn
=
T0+n = Tn,
Tn ◦T0
=
Tn+0 = Tn,
T0 ◦In
=
I0+n = In,
In ◦T0
=
In−0 = In.
Hence, T0 = i ∈TI  (i.e. T0 is the identity element).
3.	 On the one hand the relationships:
Tn ◦T12−n
=
Tn+12−n = T12 = T0,
T12−n ◦Tn
=
T12−n+n = T12 = T0,
implied T −1
n
= T12−n and on the other we have In ◦In = Tn−n = T0; this shows that 
I−1
n
= In.
4.	 By the properties of the composition of functions, the operation ◦ is associative. 
Then TI  is a group under composition.♦

2.2 Show that the operations on I  are well defined. That is, if [x] is a triad of pitch classes in M , for 
every x1, x2 ∈[x] we have: In(x1) ≡In(x2), i.e. In({a1, b1, c1}) ≡In({a2, b2, c2}).

The P, L and R Transformations
4.3	
The P, L and R Transformations
In addition to the T  and I  transformations that we apply to the set M , we also have the parallel (P), 
leading tone exchange (L ), and relative (R ) functions. Analogously to what occurs with the T  and I  
functions, there are musical, group theoretic and geometric descriptions of the P , L  and R  functions. 
The descriptions and definitions of these three will not be separated, as with the T  and I  functions, 
and several examples will be provided after the formal definition.
Two triads are said to be parallel if they have the same letter name, but are of opposite parity (parity 
meaning major or minor). For instance, the parallel minor of F major, F = {5, 9, 0} , is f-minor 
f = {5, 8, 0} . Both triads are named with the letter F but one is major and the other is minor.
Two triads are said to be relative if they are again of opposite parity, and if the root of the minor triad 
is three semitones below the root of major triad. To illustrate, we take F-major {5, 9, 0}  and count 
three semitones below 5, which is 2 and then build a minor chord on 2. This yields the d-minor chord 
{2, 5, 9} , and d minor is the relative minor of F-major.
Lastly, the leading tone exchange is derived from the fact that a semitone below any pitch is called the 
leading tone of that pitch. Therefore, the leading tone exchange of any triad is also of opposite parity, 
and the root of the major triad is replaced with its leading tone. We use F-major {5, 9, 0} once again 
to illustrate. The root of F is 5, which is replaced with its leading tone, 4. It suffices for now to say that 
the only minor chord with the pitches 4, 9, and 0 is the a-minor chord, {4, 0, 9} .
Below are the mathematical definitions of P , L , and R  which are then followed by examples .
3.1 Definition. Let x, Y ∈M, where x = {a, b, c}  is a minor triad and Y = {A, B, C}  is a major 
triad. Then 
P(x) = P({a, b, c}) = {a, b + 1, c},
P(Y ) = P({A, B, C}) = {A, B −1, C},
L(x) = L({a, b, c}) = {c + 1, a, b},
L(Y ) = L({A, B, C}) = {B, C, A −1},
R(x) = R({a, b, c}) = {b, c, a −2},
R(Y ) = R({A, B, C}) = {C + 2, A, B}.

The P, L and R Transformations
We now explore what the set of P , L , and R  functions looks like and we will start with the geometric 
representation. As with the T  and I  functions, there is a rather interesting representation of the P , 
L , and R  functions, known as the Tonnetz.
The word Tonnetz is German for “tone network” and was invented by Leonhard Euler. It was Hugo 
Riemann that explored its capacity to chart harmonic motion, that is, the movement from one pitch 
or triad to another. The original Tonnetz has undergone various alterations, but we will use the version 
shown in figure 4.4. Note that the vertices are pitch classes and the triangles represent major and minor 
triads. As mentioned before, the P , L , and R  transformations preserve 2 pitches when applied to any 
triad in M. Therefore, the rotation of a triangle about any one of its edges yields another triangle which 
is equivalent to one of the three triads that P , L , or R  would produce. Notice that if we expand the 
diagram with more vertices, we see that they start repeating vertically and horizontally and, in effect, 
the grid wraps around and therefore lies on a torus.

The P, L and R Transformations
 Figure 4.4: Oettingen/Riemann Tonnetz
Now we will analyze the compositions of the functions P, L, and R and the powers of these compositions, 
to determine all the elements of the set. Note that P, L, y R are involutive. That is:
P 2 = L2 = R2 = i.
We will show this for the function P, as the L and R functions behave in the same way. 
P ◦P({a, b, c}) = P({a, b + 1, c}) = {a, (b + 1) −1, c} = {a, b, c} = i({a, b, c})
By consecutively applying R to any triad and then L to the result, the following sequence of triads is 
produced (again, upper case representing major triads and lower case representing minor triads): 
C, a, F, d, B♭, g, E♭, c, A♭, f, D♭, b♭, G♭, e♭, B, g♯, E, c♯, A, f♯, D, b, G, e, C
(1)
This sequence is a famous progression in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, first observed by Cohn [C]. To 
follow the first step in the construction of the sequence, we take C = {0, 4, 7}  and apply the functions 
R and L, obtaining:
R({0, 4, 7}) = {9, 0, 4} = a.
Hence, C is taken to its relative minor, which is a. After that, we get: 
L ◦R({0, 4, 7}) = L({4, 0, 9}) = {5, 9, 0} = F,

The P, L and R Transformations
which shows that it is taken to its leading tone exchange, which is F major. By continuing this way, 
the row of triads shown above is produced. Even more, when the functions R  and L  are applied to 
any major triad of M, in this order, the same cyclic sequence of triads results. On the other hand, the 
sequence is produced in reverse order when applied to any minor triad. In general, we can observe that: 
(L ◦R)3({A, B, C}) = (L ◦R)2(L ◦R({A, B, C}))
= (L ◦R)2({B + 1, C + 2, A})
= (L ◦R)(C + 3, A + 2, B + 1)
= {A + 3, B + 3, C + 3}
and this pattern can be used four times to obtain: 
(L ◦R)12({A, B, C}) = (L ◦R)9((L ◦R)3({A, B, C})
= (L ◦R)9({A + 3, B + 3, C + 3})
= (L ◦R)6((L ◦R)3({A + 3, B + 3, C + 3}))
= (L ◦R)6({A + 6, B + 6, C + 6})
= (L ◦R)3((L ◦R)3({A + 6, B + 6, C + 6}))
= (L ◦R)3({A + 9, B + 9, C + 9})
= {A + 12, B + 12, C + 12}
= {A, B, C} = i({A, B, C}).
Analogously, if (L ◦R)12 = (L ◦R) ◦(L ◦R)11 is applied to a minor triad, the same triad results. 
The following step in the process of calculating the effect of the powers of L ◦R  is R ◦(L ◦R)13. 
First we have: 
R ◦(L ◦R)12({A, B, C}) = {C + 2, B, A} = R({A, B, C}).
If we calculate L ◦R ◦(L ◦R)12 = (L ◦R)13 we obtain 
(L ◦R)13({A, B, C}) = {A + 1, C + 2, B} = L ◦R({A, B, C})
and the pattern repeats itself.
This way it can be verified that (L ◦R)12 behaves as the identity and we can assert that: 
(L ◦R)12 = i = (L ◦R)0.
Once again it can be observed that any arbitrary exponent of the function will always be contained in 
the set:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.
This fact can be treated formally in a proposition.

The P, L and R Transformations
It seems curious that the P  and L  functions are not explicitly mentioned in the definition of the PLR 
set, but we can generate the whole set M  without using them. However, both P  and L  are represented, 
because the reader can show that 
	
P = R ◦(L ◦R)3
(2)
and 
	
L = R ◦(L ◦R)11.
(3)
These equalities hold whether applied to a major or minor triad.
Now we can conclude that the list of all functions (L ◦R)n and R ◦(L ◦R)m  is much more exhaustive 
than it might appear. It contains the set of compositions that include the P , L  and R  functions, as well 
as the compositions L ◦R  and R ◦L . Moreover, these 24 different functions transform any element 
of M  into a distinct element of M.
We will denote the compositions L ◦R  and R ◦L,  from here on, simply as LR  and RL , respectively.
3.4 Lemma. The set is closed under composition ◦.
Proof. It is left to the reader to show, as an exercise, that the P , L  and R  operations are well defined, 
and that all the possible compositions of P , L  and R  are in the PLR set.♦
3.5 Theorem. The PLR set forms a group under composition. In particular, 
(R(LR)n)−1 = R(LR)n
and
((LR)n)−1 = (LR)k
where k = −n mod 12.
Proof. The lemma 4.3 proves that every possible composition, including the inverses, are in the PLR set.

3.5 Theorem. The PLR set forms a group under composition. In particular,

and
((LR)n)−1 = (LR)k
where k = −n mod 12.
Proof. The lemma 4.3 proves that every possible composition, including the inverses, are in the PLR set.
Therefore, the P , L  and R  functions satisfy the group properties, as associativity is a property of the 
functions. Although we know the existence of the inverses, it is interesting see the generators of the 
inverses in the PLR group.
For the lemma 4.3 proof, for all functions of the form R ◦(LR)n  we have
R ◦(LR)n ◦R ◦(LR)n = i.
Therefore, (R ◦(LR)n)−1 = R ◦(LR)n.
For the functions that appear as (LR)n ,
((LR)n)−1 = (LR)−n = (LR)−nmod12 = (LR)k.
where k = −nmod12.♦
Problems
3.1 Exhibit a trajectory on the Tonnetz such that a sequence of R  and L  functions transform the triad 
{5, 9, 0}  into itself, after passing through all the other triads of M  in the process.
3.2 Show that the P , L  and R  operations are well defined. That is, if [x] is a triad of pitch classes in 
M  then, for every x1, x2 ∈[x] we have: 
P(x1) ≡P(x2),
i.e.
P({a1, b1, c1}) ≡P({a2, b2, c2}),
L(x1) ≡L(x2),
i.e.
L({a1, b1, c1}) ≡L({a2, b2, c2}),

The Isomorphism between PLR and TI
Now we will exhibit an explicit isomorphism between the TI and PLR groups although, as both are 
isomophic to the group of symmetries of the dodecagon (see the exercises 4.2 and 4.3), they are 
isomorphic by transitivity.
The isomorphism we are interested in between the TI and PLR groups does not send (as one might 
think) a function in one of the groups to a function in the other, such that both transform a triad x  
into the same triad y . Consider the transformation denoted by φ , in the table 4.3. This is, exactly, the 
isomorphism that will be verified in the theorem 4.
Table 3: The isomorphism φ : PLR →TI.

The Isomorphism between PLR and TI
The isomorphism is constructed in the following way. First the generators and the identities of the TI 
and PLR groups are exhibited. For example, the generators of TI are T1 and I0, with the relations 
(T1)12 = i
and
(I0)2 = i.
The generators of the the PLR group are LR and R, with the relations 
(LR)12 = i
and
R2 = i.
This suggests the following: take T1 to LR  and I0 to R . The identity T0 is taken to the identity (LR)0. 
The other functions reveal a pattern between the powers of RL and the subindices of the functions T and I.
Theorem 4 There exists a bijective homorphism φ : PLR →TI such that 
φ((LR)x) = Tx,
φ(R ◦(LR)x) = In,
where n = −xmod12. 
Proof. By using the table 4.3 we can conclude that the function is bijective. Now we will carry out a 
pointwise evaluation of all the possible combinations of the generators of the PLR group. We will show 
that for every g, h ∈PLR  and all x ∈M,
φ(g ◦h)(x) = φ(g)(φ(h)(x)).
Let x = {a, b, c} ∈M, and let g = LR  and h = R . Then the left side of the equation is:
φ(g ◦h)({a, b, c})
=
φ((LR) ◦R)({a, b, c})
=
φ(L ◦R ◦R)({a, b, c})
=
φ(L)({a, b, c})

The Duality of the TI and PLR Groups
4.5	
The Duality of the TI and PLR Groups
We know from chapter 3, definition 2.3, what it means for a group G  to act on a set X .
5.1 Lemma. The set M  is a TI-set. In other words, the TI group acts on M .
Proof. We define the action of Tm, In ∈TI on x ∈M  through the evaluation, ie 
φ(Tm, x) = Tm ∗x = Tm(x)
y
φ(In, x) = In ∗x = In(x).
Since for any functions f, g ∈TI we have: 
(f ◦g) ∗x = (f ◦g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f ∗(g ∗x)
as well as i ∗x = T0 ∗x = T0(x) = x = i(x), it follows that IT acts on M .♦
5.2 Lemma. The set M  is a PLR-set. In other words, the PLR group acts on M .
Proof. Defining the action through the evaluation, the proof is essentially the same as the previous 
lemma.♦
Recall, also from chapter 3, the definition of the orbit of X  under G .
5.3 Lemma. For every x ∈M , the orbit TIx  of x  is M .
Proof. As illustrated in figures 4.2 and 4.3, where all the functions are applied to a single triad, the entire 
set M  is generated. Even thought the table shows only the functions applied to the C major chord, it 
can be easily verified that the functions act in the same manner on any major or minor triad. So the 
orbit of the TI group is:
TIx = {f ∗x | f ∈TI} = M.♦
We leave it as an exercise to show that, for every x ∈M , the orbit PLRx  is also M . Recall the 
definition of isotropic subgroup (or stabilizer) from chapter 3, as well as the orbit-stabilizer theorem 
(theorem 2.8).
5.4 Lemma. Let x ∈M . Then the stabilizer of x  under PLR is 
PLRx = {f ∈PLR|f ∗x = x} = i = (LR)0

The Duality of the TI and PLR Groups
Proof. We use Theorem 3.2.8. to see that 
|PLRx| = |PLR|
|PLRx|.
But |PLR| = 24 as there are 24 functions in PLR and |PLRx| = 24 since PLRx = M . This gives us
|PLRx| = 24
24 = 1.
Naturally, i ∗x = x , so PLR i ∈{x}  and is the only member of the set. Therefore, the stabilizer is 
trivial.♦
We leave it as an exercise to show that if x ∈M , then the stabilizer of x  under TI is 
TIx = {f ∈TI | f ∗x = x} = i = T0.
5.5 Definition. An action of a group G  on a set X  is free if for any g, h ∈G  and x ∈X  
g ∗x ̸= f ∗x . This condition is equivalent to g ∗x = x  if and only if g  is the identity element of G .
5.6 Corollary. The TI and PLR groups act freely on M .
Proof. We’ve already established that for all x ∈M  TIx{x} = i  and PLRx = i  are the stabilizers. 
Therefore, the actions of TI and PLR groups on M  meet the definition of free action.♦
5.7 Definition. An action of a group G  on a set X  is transitive if for any x, y ∈X  there exists 
g ∈G  such that g ∗x = y .
5.8 Definition. An action of a group G  on a set X  is regular if it is transitive and free (also called 
“simply transitive”).
Now we will show that the TI and PLR groups act regularly on M .
5.9 Proposition. The actions of the TI and PLR groups on M  are regular, that is, they are transitive 
and free.
Proof. We can deduce the regularity from figures 4.2 and 4.3 and the equation(?). First, we see that all 
functions acting on any x  produce the entire set M . In other words, for every y  in M  always exists 
a function g  such that g(x) = y . Moreover, this happens without a repeat occurrence of triads, which 
means that only one function transforms any triad in any other triad. Therefore, g  is unique.

Therefore, the findings can be used to infer the regularity. Since, for all x, it holds that TIx = M , then 
given z, y ∈M  there are f, g ∈TI such that f ∗x = z  and g ∗x = y . This means that
f −1(z) = f −1 ∗(f ∗x) = (f −1 ◦f) ∗x = i ∗x = x
and
(g ◦f −1) ∗z = g ∗(f −1(z)) = g ∗x = y

so that g ◦f −1 is an element of the group that sends z  to y  by means of this action. Finally, if there 
are g1, g2 ∈TI such that g−1

◦g1 = i  then g2 = g1. But the stabilizer of x  is trivial, so g2 = g1
and therefore g2 = g1. This demonstrates that TI is regular. The PLR case is analogous.♦
Recall the definition of the centralizer of a group from chapter 3. The concept of centralizer is based on 
commutativity and, because of this, we will examine the commutativity between elements of TI and PLR.
5.10 Lemma. All the elements of the PLR and TI groups commute.
We should show the commutativity of the generators of each group, that is,
W4  +OU, @ +OU,  W4>
+7144,
W4  U @ U  W4>
+7145,
L3  +OU, @ +OU,  L3>
+7146,
L3  U @ U  L3=
+7147,
It is left as an exercise complete the proof of this lemma.♦
Figure 4.6: Musical illustration of I0 ◦ R(a) = R ◦ I0(a).
The figures 4.5 y 4.6 provide musical examples of commutativity with the use of commutative diagrams.
Given that the commutative relations are valid when any element of M  is evaluated, for every f  in 
TI and for every g  in PLR, the commutative diagram is always valid.

The commutative nature of the TI and PLR groups brings us to the last notion we need for duality.
As the TI and PLR groups are transformations of M  into itself, they are permutation groups and, 
consequently, subgroups of the symmetric group of M  (i.e. Sym(M), which is the group of all bijections 
of M  into itself under function composition). Recall the definition of centralizer from chapter 3. We 
will examine the centralizers of each group (TI and PLR) as subgroups of the big group Sym(M).

The Duality of the TI and PLR Groups
Proof. First we consider the centralizer of the TI group, 
CSym(M)(TI) = {g ∈Sym(M)|fg = gf, ∀f ∈TI}.
By lemma 5.11 we have that for every g ∈PLR and f ∈TI, f ◦g = g ◦f . Then the PLR group is 
contained in CSym(M)(TI). We should verify that there do not exist other functions that do not belong 
to the PLR group in CSym(M)(TI). We begin by looking at the stabilizer of x  in CSym(M)(TI). 
Suppose that h ∈CSym(M)(TI) and that it fixes x ∈M . Let g ∈TI. Then:
k+{, @ {>
j+k+{,, @ j+{,>
k+j+{,, @ j+{,>
where the last equality follows from the fact that h  is in the centralizer. By proposition ? we know that 
TI acts regularly, hence for every y ∈M  there exists a g  such that y = g(x). This shows that for 
every x, y ∈M  
h(y) = h(g(x)) = g(x) = y.
In particular, h(y) = y  for every y ∈M . However, the only element in CSym(M)(TI) that fixes all 
elements in CSym(M)(TI) is i, hence h  is the identity element. Thus, CSym(M)(TI)x = i .
By applying theorem 2.8 from Chapter 3 (the orbit-stabilizer theorem) to CSym(M)(TI)x  we obtain: 
|CSym(M)(TI)x|
=
|CSym(M)(TI)|
|CSym(M)(TI)x|
=
|CSym(M)(TI)| ≤|M| = 24,
given that the orbit of x  under CSym(M)(TI) is contained in M . On the other hand, 
PLR ⊆CSym(M)(TI), giving us:
|PLR| ≤|CSym(M)(TI)|.
Combining these inequalities, we see that |CSym(M)(TI)| = 24 and the centralizer of TI must be the 
group PLR. We still must show that the centralizer of the PLR goupr is the TI group. However, we only 
have to interchange the roles of the TI group with the PLR group from the beginning of the proof to 
show that CSym(M)(PLR) = TI.

The Duality of the TI and PLR Groups
5.12 Definition. Let H  and K  be subgroups of the symmetric group Sym(X) (i.e. H  and K  are 
permutation groups on the set X). Then H  and K  are said to be dual if each one acts regularly on 
X  and one is the centralizer of the other in Sym(X).
The multiple lemmas and theorems that have been seen are used to deduce the duality of the TI and 
PLR groups.
5.13 Theorem. The TI and PLR groups are dual.
Proof. The statement follows from Proposition 4.5 and Lemma 4.5.
Problems
5.1 Show that for all x ∈M , the orbit of x  is PLRx = M.
5.2 Show that if x ∈M , and M  is a set-T/I , then the stabilizer of x  is 
T/Ix = {f ∈T/I | fx = x} = T0
5.3 Show the lemma 5.10. All the elements of the PLR and TI groups commute.

2.1 Let x1, x2 ∈[x] ∈M , where x1 = ⟨a1, b1, c1⟩ and x2 = ⟨a2, b2, c2⟩. Then x1 and x2 
are elements in the class of triads [x] = ⟨[a], [b], [c]⟩. We see that a1, a2 ∈[a] ∈Z12, b1, 
b2 ∈[b] ∈Z12, and c1, c2 ∈[c] ∈Z12, then: Tn(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩) = ⟨a1 + n, b1 + n, c1 + n⟩ and, 
Tn(⟨a2, b2, c2⟩) = ⟨a2 + n, b2 + n, c2 + n⟩ as, a1 ∈[a], then (a1 + n) ∈[a + n] and a2 ∈[a], 
then (a2 + n) ∈[a + n].
Similarly (b1 + n), (b2 + n) ∈[b + n] and (c1 + n), (c2 + n) ∈[c + n] which gives us:
Tn(x1)
=
Tn(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩)

⟨a1 + n, b1 + n, c1 + n⟩
≡
⟨a2 + n, b2 + n, c2 + n⟩
≡
Tn(⟨a2, b2, c2⟩)
≡
Tn(x2).
Hence Tn  is well defined.

i) Let x1, x2 ∈[x] ∈M , where x1 = ⟨a1, b1, c1⟩and x2 = ⟨a2, b2, c2⟩. Then x1 and x2 are 
elements in of the class of triads [x] = ⟨[a], [b], [c]⟩and a1, a2 ∈[a] ∈Z12, b1, b2 ∈[b] ∈Z12, 
c1, c2 ∈[c] ∈Z12.
P(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩) = ⟨C1, B1 + 1, A1⟩and 
P(⟨a2, b2, c2⟩) = ⟨C2, B2 + 1, A2⟩. 
As 
A1 ∈[A], 
then 
(A1 + n) ∈[A + n] 
and 
A2 ∈[A]. 
Thus 
(A2 + n) ∈[A + n]. 
Analogously, 
(B1 + n), (B2 + n) ∈[B + n] and (C1 + n), (C2 + n) ∈[C + n]. Then: 
P (x1)

ii)   L(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩) = ⟨A1 + 1, C1, B1⟩ and L(⟨a2, b2, c2⟩) = ⟨A2 + 1, C2, B2⟩. As A1 ∈[A], 
then 
(A1 + n) ∈[A + n] 
and 
A2 ∈[A]. 
Thus 
(A2 + n) ∈[A + n]. 
Similarly, 
(B1 + n), (B2 + n) ∈[B + n] and (C1 + n), (C2 + n) ∈[C + n] then:

Hence L  is well defined.
iii)   R(⟨a1, b1, c1⟩) = ⟨B1, A1, C1 −2⟩ and R(⟨a2, b2, c2⟩) = ⟨B2, A2, C2 −2⟩. As A1 ∈[A], 
then (A1 + n) ∈[A + n] and A2 ∈[A]. Hence (A2 + n) ∈[A + n]. Similarly (B1 + n), (B2 + n) 
[B + n] and (C1 + n), (C2 + n)[C + n]. Then

Thus R  is well defined. ♦
4.1 Let x  be any composition of P , L  and R  functions. We say that x  has length of, at the most n , 
if there exists a decomposition of x  as the composition of, at the most, n  functions of P , L  and R. 
We will prove by induction that any composition of P , L  and R  functions is in the PLR set.
The base case: verify that, for any x  of length n = 1, x  is in the PLR set.
Case 1: If x = P = R(LR)3, then x ∈PLR.
Case 2: If x = L = R(LR)11, then x ∈PLR.
Case 3: If x = R , then x ∈PLR.
We assume that, if x  has at most length k  for every k ≥1, then x ∈PLR.
Induction step: Verify that, for any x  of length k + 1, x ∈PLR.

Let y  be of length k + 1; then, by definition, y  is a composition of k + 1 P , L  and R  functions. Let 
“a ” be the first function of the composition; then a ∈{P, L, R} , and y = a ∗x . Now, the length of x  
is ≤k  and we know that x ∈PLR. Hence, there exists an n  such that x = (LR)n or x = R(LR)n.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

An Introduction to Group Theory

The Authors
The success of Group Theory is impressive and extraordinary. It is, perhaps, the most powerful and 
influential branch of all Mathematics. Its influence is strongly felt in almost all scientific and artistic 
disciplines (in Music, in particular) and in Mathematics itself. Group Theory extracts the essential 
characteristics of diverse situations in which some type of symmetry or transformation appears. The 
concept of structure, and the concepts related to structure such as isomorphism, play a decisive role in 
modern Mathematics. 
In this text, a modern presentation is chosen, where the language of commutative diagrams and universal 
properties, so necessary in Modern Mathematics, in Physics and Computer Science, among other 
disciplines, is introduced.
This text consists of four chapters. Each section contains a series of problems that can be solved with 
creativity by using the content that is presented there; these problems form a fundamental part of the text. 
They also are designed with the objective of reinforcing students’ mathematical writing. Throughout the 
first three chapters, representative examples (that are not numbered) of applications of Group Theory to 
Mathematical Music Theory are included for students who already have some knowledge of Music Theory.
In chapter 4, the application of Group Theory to Music Theory is presented in detail. Some basic aspects 
of Mathematical Music Theory are explained and, in the process, some essential elements of both areas 
are given to readers with different backgrounds. For this reason, the examples follow from some of the 
outstanding theoretical aspects of the previous chapters; the musical terms are introduced as they are 
needed so that a reader without musical background can understand the essence of how Group Theory 
is used to explain certain pre-established musical relations. On the other hand, for the reader with 
knowledge of Music Theory only, this chapter provides concrete elements, as well as motivation, to begin 
to understand Group Theory.

 Pitch is the perception that one has of the frequency of a sound. Fixed pitches are chosen in 
Music, so that they can be composed, such as in the case of the ones that make up the equal 
tempered scale. See chapter 4, section 1.
2.	
 An octave is the distance (or interval) that is percieved between a note and another with double 
(or half) its frequency. See chapter 4, section1.
3.	
 This ambiguity is resolved by giving an o­rien­ta­tion to the counterpoint interval ξ ∈I  , that 
is, + if it is ascending and − if it is descending, and it is written (ξ, +) or (ξ, −). If it is not 
specified, it is understood that the orientation is ascending.
4.	
In chapter 3, section 2, we will see that this is a very appropriate name.
5.	
The symbol ℘X  denotes the power set of X.
6.	
For the definition of major and minor chorse, see chapter 4.
7.	
The human brain interprets the distances between the pitches logarithmically. That is, the distance 
(in octaves) between a pitch of frequency F1 and another with frequency F2 is perceived as 
| log2(F1) −log2(F2)|. For this reason, if F2 = 2F1, then the distance is  
| log2(F1) −log2(F2)| = | log2(F1) −log2(2F1)| = | log2( F1
2F1)| = | log2
1
2| = | −1| = 1.
The reader can verify that if the distance between F1 and 2F2 is divided in twelve equal parts, 
the frequencies of the resulting pitches are the same as those obtained by multplying F1 by 
successive powers of .
8.	
In the scientific notation of pitch, middle C is located in the fourth octave. That is why it is 
denoted C.
