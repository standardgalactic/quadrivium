Preface
There has been a need for a textbook in mechanics of materials for students in 2- or
4-year technology programs in engineering, architecture, or building construction.
In addition, students in vocational schools and technical institutes will ﬁnd in this
book the fundamentals of statics and strength of materials that will be vital in school
and in their professional lives.
This text provides the necessary information required for students of the afore-
mentioned programs to successfully grasp important physical concepts. The mate-
rial has been written in a simple way, with only some knowledge of college algebra
and trigonometry required; no special engineering background or knowledge of
calculus is necessary for understanding this text.
I have taught statics and strength of materials in the engineering program at
Texas State Technical College-Harlingen for the past 15 years, and I have presented
the material here in the same way that I would present it in the classroom. Each
topic is followed by examples so the student can learn the problem solving methods
and apply them in real-world problems. The student will also see a set of practice
problems at the end of each topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a summary
with a set of review questions and problems.
Doing the homework will give the student a much deeper understanding of the
variety of concepts and encourage him/her to continue studying this fascinating
branch of engineering. It goes without saying that the material in this text could also
be a valuable reference for those individuals seeking state licensing in professional
engineering. The students taking this class must not just read the book; they should
take it as a serious and important text, concentrating on each chapter, working on
the problems carefully, analyzing each problem, and trying to relate them to real-
world situations or problems they are currently facing on the job site. This is how to
learn engineering science. They always say that mastery of technical ideas often
means hard work and concentration. Those who are not afraid of a challenge can
excel!
I have organized the chapters in a simple way so the student can easily read and
understand the material. I have avoided using difﬁcult language. In fact, the book is
based on the simplest educational process; I believe that in writing such a technical
book this method must be followed. In Chap. 1, I introduce the basic fundamentals,
deﬁnitions in mechanics of materials, and the metric and English systems of units.
v

I have shown examples and also included some questions and problems for the
student to work on. Working on engineering problems requires a ﬁrm understand-
ing of how to do unit conversions, because the unit conversion is the building block
of engineering science. In Chap. 2, I cover force systems on structures, force
components, equilibrium of forces, and the free body diagram.
Chapter 3 discusses force moments, principle of moments, moment equations for
equilibrium, and application of force moments in engineering. Numerous example
problems are introduced and solved throughout this chapter. Chapter 4 covers the
centroid of an area, and Chap. 5 discusses the moment of inertia of an area, and
many example problems are solved throughout this chapter to clarify this important
concept.
Stress and strain are introduced in Chap. 6, and numerous real-world problems
are solved in all the sections of the chapter. Chapter 7 covers torsion in circular
sections, and discusses how to calculate the transmission of power through a
rotating shaft. In Chap. 8, I explain the shear and bending moment in a beam and
show many example problems for which the student might ﬁnd applications in
structural engineering and building construction.
Chapter 9 discusses bending stresses in beams and covers the resisting moment
and ﬂexure formulas for beams. In Chap. 10, I explain the columns and slenderness
ratio for compression members. Steel and timber columns are also discussed in this
chapter with example problems.
There are two appendices in this book, A and B. Appendix A shows the beam
diagrams and formulas for helping the students to solve the homework problems.
Appendix B provides information about the centroids and properties of areas. The
students are encouraged to refer to any updated strength of materials or engineering
texts to extract more information about the standard steel or timber, if necessary.
Author decided not to include the tables of properties from the other current
sources, because they may lack data or may be outdated.
In closing, my academic experience teaching mathematics, physics, and engi-
neering courses for 27 years at colleges and universities in Texas, and also my
practice as a professional engineer were the primary impetus for writing this book.
This book will hopefully show how the fundamental concepts of mechanics of
materials can be applied to real-world problems.
I wish to extend my thanks to the staff and faculty at Texas State Technical
College-Harlingen, who provided me guidance, encouragement, and support.
Finally, I am grateful to my loving son Reza, for his help and encouragement in
making this book possible.
I have tried to produce an error-free book, but no doubt some errors still remain.
Please let me know of any that you ﬁnd. Comments, suggestions, and criticisms are
always welcome from readers.

•
Deﬁne vector and scalar quantities with some examples
1.1
Mechanics of Materials
Mechanics is deﬁned as the study of the effects of forces on bodies. Statics is the
study of bodies that are at rest or moving with constant velocity while subjected to
force systems. When the changes of shape of the body and the internal state of the
body due to the effects of external force systems become important, the study is

then known as mechanics of materials or strength of materials. It is essential that the
following basic terms be understood, since they continually recur in all phases of
this technical study.
1.2
Trigonometry
To analyze the forces and work on problems in mechanics of materials or any type
of engineering problems, the student must have a thorough understanding of
algebraic and trigonometric functions and formulas. Solution of mechanics of
materials problems requires such mathematical principles.
1.3
Metric and English Systems of Units
Units are used to deﬁne the size of physical quantities. Meter, kilogram, second,
newton, and Kelvin are, respectively, units of length, mass, time, force (weight),
and temperature in the metric system (SI). Foot, slug, second, pound, and degrees
Rankin are, respectively, units of length, mass, time, force (weight), and tempera-
ture in English system.
The metric system (SI) offers major advantages relative to the English system.
For example, the metric system uses only one basic unit for length, the meter,
whereas, the English system uses many basic units for length such as inch, foot,
yard, mile, etc. Also, because the metric system is based on multiples of 10, it is
easier to use and learn.
The metric system of units, today, has been adopted all over the world. However,
the United States is making progress toward the adoption of SI units in order to sell
American products more easily on the world market. Therefore, information about
the conversion factors is provided between the SI and the English system of units.

Fundamental Terms
Mass
Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter. It is related to the inertia of the body
and is usually considered a constant. The unit of mass in the metric system is
the kilogram.
Force
This term is applied to any action on a body which tends to make it move, change
its motion, or change its size and shape. A force usually produces acceleration. The
unit of force in the metric system is the newton (N) and in the English system,
the pound (lb).

Introduction

Example 1.1 Convert 75 lb to newtons.
(75 lb) (4.45 N/1 lb) ¼ 334 N.
Example 1.2 Convert 150,000 newtons to pounds (lb)
(150,000 N) (1 lb/4.45 N) ¼ 3.37  104 lb
Pressure
Pressure is the external force per unit area. It is calculated by dividing the total
external force acting on a cross-sectional area of a body or substance. The unit of
pressure in the metric system is N/m2 (Pa), and in the English system, lb/in.2 (psi).
Example 1.3 Find the pressure, in metric units, that a hollow cast-iron column
exerts on its foundation shown in Fig. 1.1.

Area of the column (A) ¼ π/4(122  11.52) ¼ 9.23 in.2
Pressure (P) ¼ Force/Area ¼ 20,000 lb/9.23 in.2 ¼ 2,167 lb/in.2 (psi)
Using conversion factors: 1 kPa ¼ 1,000 N/m2 ¼ 0.145 lb/in.2
(2,167 psi) (1 kPa/0.145 psi) ¼ 14,944.83 kPa
Density
This term may refer either to weight or mass density. Weight density is the weight
per unit volume of a body or substance. The unit of weight density in the metric
system is N/m3 and in the English system, lb/ft3. Mass density is the mass per unit
volume of a body or substance. The unit of mass density in the metric system is
kg/m3 and in the English system, slug/ft3.
Weight
Weight is the force with which a body is attracted toward the center of the earth by
gravitational pull. The unit of weight in the metric system is the newton (N), and in
the English system, the pound (lb).

Example 1.4 Find the weight of a wooden block 20 cm  15 cm  10 cm. Assume
the weight density of wood to be
D ¼ 227 N/m3.
Find the volume of the block:
V ¼ width  depth  length ¼ 10 cm  15 cm  20 cm ¼ 3,000 cm3
Using conversion factors: 1 cm3 ¼ 106 m3
(3,000 cm3) (106 m3/1 cm3) ¼ 0.003 m3
Find the weight of the block:
W ¼ VD ¼ 0.003 m3  227 N/m3 ¼ 0.681 N.
Load
This term is used to indicate that a body of some weight is applying a force against
some supporting structure or part of a structure. For example, a load weighing
100 lb is applied on a beam supported at two ends. Or, a beam itself can be
considered a certain load on part of a structure.
Example 1.5 A brick wall 6 in. thick and 8 ft high supports a roof load equal to
1,500 lb/ft of wall. If the reinforced concrete footing of the wall is 1.7 ft deep and
2.5 ft wide, ﬁnd the pressure between the footing and the soil (Fig. 1.2) (consider
1 ft of the wall).

P ¼ force/area ¼ 2,618 lb/2.5 ft  1 ft ¼ 1,047 lb/ft2.
Moment
The tendency of a force to cause rotation about an axis through some point is known
as moment. Moment (M) of a force (F) about a given point (O), is the product of the
force and its perpendicular distance r from the line of action between the force and
point O.
The point or axis of rotation is called the center of moments. The perpendicular
distance between the line of action and the center of rotation is called the moment arm.
This can be formulated as:
M ¼ F  r
Moment of Force ¼ Magnitude of Force  Moment Arm
The unit of moment in the metric system is N-m, and in the English system, inch-
pounds (in.-lb) or foot-pounds (ft-lb).
Example 1.6 A 10 ft beam has a load of 600 lb at a distance of 2 ft from the left end
of the beam. Calculate the moment of load about each end point (Fig. 1.3).

Fig. 1.3
Solution Moment of force ¼ 600 lb  2 ft ¼ + 1,200 ft-lb
Moment of force ¼ 600 lb  8 ft ¼ 4,800 ft-lb
Notice the sign of moment clockwise (+) and counterclockwise ().
Example 1.7 Convert 10.94 in.-lb to newton-meters.
Using conversion factors: 1 lb ¼ 4.45 N, and 1 in. ¼ 0.0254 m
1 in.-lb ¼ 0.0254 m  4.45 N ¼ 0.1130 N-m
Therefore, (10.94 in.-lb) (0.1130 N-m/in.-lb) ¼ 1.24 N-m

Couple
Couple is a pair of parallel forces equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Their only effect is to produce a moment. The only motion a couple can cause is
rotation (Fig. 1.4). Note that the moment of a couple is equal to the product of one
of its forces F and the perpendicular distance d between the forces
M ¼ F  d

Vector
In general, any quantity that has direction and magnitude is a vector quantity.
Examples include force, weight, displacement, velocity, and acceleration, etc.
Scalar
Scalar quantities are quantities that have magnitude only. They are complete
without a direction. Examples include mass, density, area, volume, distance,
speed, time, temperature, work, power, etc.

Vector Operations
1.5.1
Multiplication and Division of Vectors by a Scalar
When a vector is multiplied by a scalar quantity, its magnitude will be changed.
Depending on the positive or negative values of the scalar, the magnitude of the
vector will be increased or decreased. In the same manner, we use this operation if
we divide a vector by any positive or negative scalar quantity.

Introduction

1.5.2
Addition of Vectors
There are two common graphical methods for ﬁnding the geometric sum of vectors.
Polygon method
Parallelogram method
Polygon Method
This method is mostly used in applications dealing with the addition of more than
two vectors. Use a ruler and protractor to measure the size (magnitude) and
direction of the vector. Measurements must be done to proper scale. Continue this
process for each vector until you ﬁnd the magnitude and direction of the resultant
vector (Fig. 1.5).
A
B
R
C
θ
Fig. 1.5
Note that the resultant vector will be drawn with its tail at the origin (starting
point) and its tip joined to the tip of the last vector. Also, the order in which the
vectors are added together has no effect in obtaining the resultant of the vector.
Parallelogram Method
In the parallelogram method, the resultant of only two forces will be obtained, and
the lines of actions of these two forces pass through a common origin. The two
forces form the sides of a parallelogram whose diagonal will be represented as the
resultant of the two forces (Fig. 1.6). In the parallelogram method, vectors A and
B do not depend upon the order in which they are added. The addition of two
vectors is commutative, and we write
A þ B ¼ B þ A

1.5.3
Subtraction of Vectors
Subtraction of vectors A and B is obtained by adding to A the negative vector
B (B). We write
A  B ¼ A þ B
ð
Þ
In graphical representation, A  B is constructed by connecting the tail of (A) to
the head of (B).
Subtraction is a special case of addition; therefore, vector addition rules can be
applied to vector subtraction.
Example 1.8 A car is pulled out by two cables as shown (Fig. 1.7). If cable A is
exerting 1,200 lb, ﬁnd the force exerted by cable B needed to move the car straight
out. Use trigonometric laws to work on the problem.
(Assume that the resultant of forces is directed along the axis of the car.)

Solution Use a triangle rule. Note that the triangle rule, in fact, is half of the
parallelogram rule mentioned earlier. Notice that the resultant of the forces must be
perpendicular to the front of the car to keep the car straight.
Using the triangle rule, the force on cable B can be calculated using the law of
sines. We write

Chapter Summary
1. The subject of mechanics of materials is concerned with the behavior of deform-
able bodies under the inﬂuence of external loads.
2. Fundamental terms such as mass, force, weight, load, density, pressure, moment,
and couple are used in our subject of interest.
3. We presented the metric (SI) and English systems of units both used in engi-
neering problems.
You have learned the major distinction between metric and English systems of
units and the advantages of the metric over the English system in our technolog-
ical world.
4. The concepts of vector and scalar quantities, and how they are applied in
mechanics of materials were covered. Vectors have magnitude and direction,
whereas scalars are only identiﬁed by magnitude.
5. Since the vectors have magnitude and direction, they may not be added in the
usual manner. For this purpose, both the polygon and parallelogram methods
were presented.

Force Systems on Structures
2
Overview
The task in designing any type of a structure requires a deep understanding of
forces acting on the parts of the structure. For this purpose the designer must study
the types of external forces and take into account the principles of statics. Statics is
mostly concerned with the reaction of the body under the inﬂuence of external
forces. Once we understand the nature and effects of forces on the body, then we
will be able to study the material properties of an entire structure under the forces
acting on it and show a proper design for the application of interest.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to deﬁne different types of forces
(collinear and concurrent) and compute the respective resultants for these types of
force systems by the parallelogram and force triangle methods. You will also be
able to deﬁne and compute equilibrium conditions for concurrent force systems and
the concept of a free body diagram. Your knowledge, application, and problem
solving skills will be determined by your performance on the chapter test.
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
•

2.1
Collinear Forces
The point of the body where the force is applied is called the point of application of
the force, and the line along which it acts is called its line of action. The sense of the
force, that is, the direction in which it acts, is shown by an arrow. When two forces
F1 and F2 act along the same line, they are called collinear forces (Fig. 2.1).
F1
F2
Fig. 2.1
2.2
Resultant of Collinear Forces
If forces F1 and F2 also have the same direction, the magnitude of their resultant R,
can be obtained by adding the magnitudes of the two forces.
R ¼ F1 þ F2
For example, if F1 ¼ 200 N and F2 ¼ 350 N, then
R ¼ 200 þ 350 ¼ 550N
As a general rule, when a force acts to the right, it is considered positive, and
when it acts to the left, it is negative. The rule of determining the resultant of
collinear forces may be stated as follows:
The resultant of any number of forces acting along the same straight line is
their algebraic sum.
Example 2.1 Find the resultant of the collinear force system shown (Fig. 2.2).
25 lb
20 lb
15 lb
10 lb
Fig. 2.2
Solution
R ¼ þ15 þ 25  20  10 ¼ þ10lb
Thus, the four given forces may be replaced by a single force of 10 lb acting to
the right (positive direction).

Solution
R ¼ þ8 þ 12  10 ¼ 10N
Therefore, three given forces may be replaced by a single force of 10 N in the
positive direction (upward). Notice that the resultant of two collinear forces, for
horizontal or vertical directions, can be found by the graphical method discussed
earlier.

Solution To establish the equilibrium condition, the sum of the forces on one side
must be equal to the sum of the forces on the other side, i.e., the resultant of the
force system is equal to zero.
185 þ 110 þ 315  424  F ¼ 0
Solving algebraically we get,
F ¼ 186lb

Resultant of Concurrent Forces
A resultant is a single force which can replace two or more concurrent forces and
produce the same effect on the body as the concurrent forces. The resultant will
always act at the point of intersection.
The magnitude and direction of the resultant of concurrent force systems can be
found by trigonometric or graphical techniques. In the trigonometric method, the
law of sines, the law of cosines, and the Pythagorean theorem can be applied. Or it

can be determined graphically using a parallelogram, polygon laws, or the force
triangle law.
Example 2.4 Two concurrent forces of 30 lb and 40 lb act on a body and make an
angle of 90 with each other as shown (Fig. 2.11). Find the magnitude and direction

Solution
(a)
Graphically: the forces must be drawn to scale. From point A, draw AB
equal to 30 lb to any convenient scale and parallel to force P, as shown in
Fig. 2.11a, b. From B, draw a line BC in the direction of force F and of a
length to represent 40 lb. Then the line AC is the resultant R in magnitude
and direction. By measurement, R is found to be 50 lb. Angle α can be
measured with a protractor. Figure 2.11a shows the graphical solution by
means of force triangle.
(b)
Mathematically: using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle
constructed of P, F, and R, we have
R2
¼ P2 þ F2
R
¼ √P2 þ F2 ¼ √9002 þ 1, 6002
R

The angle α that R makes with P may be found from
tan α ¼ BC=AB ¼ F=P ¼ 40=30 ¼ 1:33

Solution Any force may be resolved into two components at right angles to each
other. The components of forces in the x and y directions are determined using
trigonometric functions. The forces or component forces in the x and y directions,
then, are summed into one single force having ∑Fx and ∑Fy direction. This forms
a right triangle with legs equal to ∑Fx and ∑Fy whose hypotenuse is the resultant
force in magnitude and direction of the given system of forces. That is,

Components of a Force
The resultant of the forces was previously deﬁned as a single force that will produce
the same effect as two forces. Also, it was stated that two forces with their resultant
form a triangle. The converse of this statement is also true: a force may be replaced
by any two forces which, with the given force, form a triangle.
Problems in mechanics of materials are often simpliﬁed by resolving forces into
components in the x and y axes and perpendicular to each other. Figure 2.16 shows a
force F. This force can be resolved into two components F1 and F2 perpendicular to
each other, where their magnitudes can be calculated knowing the magnitude and
direction of the original vector F.

If the angle between F and F1 is α, then by the right triangle relationship,

The components F1 and F2 can also be found graphically if they (including force
F) are measured to a proper scale.

2.6
Equilibrium of Concurrent Force Systems
Equilibrium is a state of balance between opposing forces or actions such that
moving a body in one direction is canceled out by other forces that move the body
in other directions. Or, in mechanics of materials, a body under the action of a
concurrent force system is in equilibrium if the resultant of the force system is equal
to zero. In equation form:
X
Fx ¼ 0
X
Fy ¼ 0
When a system of forces is in an equilibrium state, the force polygon of the
forces in tip-to-tail fashion will be closed (Fig. 2.33).

Equilibrant and the Force Triangle
If two forces are acting on a body, the third force that will hold them in equilibrium
is called the equilibrant, or the balancing force. As an example, the relations among
three forces in equilibrium could be shown by forces F1 ¼ F2 ¼ 6,000 lb (Fig. 2.34).
These forces are concurrent forces since their lines of action meet at point M. Then,
what is the direction and magnitude of a horizontal force F3 exerted at the same
point M such that F1, F2, and F3 will all be in equilibrium?

Action and Reaction
According to Newton’s third law, if a particle exerts a force on another particle,
then the second particle exerts a collinear force of equal magnitude and opposite
direction on the ﬁrst particle. The wall resists the push with an equal and opposite
force, too; this is called a reaction. A body weighing 10 lb rests on a table. The
action force is the downward pull due to the earth’s attraction. The table exerts an
upward reaction N and N ¼ 10 lb, as the forces are in equilibrium (Fig. 2.38).

Newton’s First Law and Free Body Diagram
Newton’s First Law: If a particle is acted on by forces whose resultant is zero, it
remains at rest or will move with constant speed along a straight line. This idea can
be utilized in analysis of actual physical engineering problems. These problems can
simply be converted into an equilibrium system of forces acting on the particle. In
this determination, a free body diagram will be very helpful. A free body diagram is
a diagram that represents all the forces acting on a particle.
As an example, consider a block W hanging from two cables tied together at C
(Fig. 2.39a). To determine the tension in AC and BC, we construct the free body

Isaac Newton (1642–1727)
Sir Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day of 1642 in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe,
England, where his mother managed the farm left by her husband who died
two months before Isaac was born. The baby was frail and sickly, but he somehow
managed to survive and grow stronger, even though he never enjoyed

excellent health. He was educated at a local school of low educational standards and
as a youth showed no special ﬂair except for an interest in mechanical devices. He
was a curious boy and an average student in the grammar school at Grantham.
Newton did well enough in his subjects to be admitted to Trinity College of
Cambridge in 1661.
When Newton received his bachelor’s degree in April 1665, he had to leave
Cambridge because the university was closed down, and plague was widespread in
the London area. He returned to his home at Woolsthorpe, where he spent the next
two years contemplating the ideas about space and time and motion he had ﬁrst
considered while at the university.
By the time of his return to Cambridge (in 1667), it is tolerably certain that he
had already ﬁrmly laid the foundations of his work in the three great ﬁelds with
which his name is forever associated: calculus, the nature of light, and universal
gravitation and its consequences. Newton’s theory of gravitation was based on his
theory that “the rate of fall was proportional to the strength of the gravitational force
and that this force fell off according to the square of the distance from the center of
earth.”
His observation of an apple falling from a tree to the ground while at
Woolsthorpe led Newton to conclude that the earth was pulling on the apple and
the apple on the earth. Newton was the ﬁrst to speculate that the force that caused
the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that keeps the moon in its orbit
around the earth and the earth in its orbit around the sun. Newton not only uniﬁed
and completed the mechanics of Galileo and Kepler, but he showed that the
dynamic motions of the universe can be described by basic mathematical
relationships that are valid anywhere in the universe. Newton’s achievements
dominated science and philosophy for the next two centuries.
At ﬁrst Newton did not publish his discoveries. He is described by most of his
contemporaries, including Robert Hooke and Huygens, as having had an abnormal
fear of criticism. Later, his astronomer friend Edmond Halley (1656–1742)
recognized his greatness and encouraged him to publish his results. This caused
Newton to begin working on a book explaining his theory of gravitation, as well as
the three laws of motion. He ﬁnished the manuscript in 18 months, and it was
published in 1687 at Halley’s expense as the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica (The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). The book is
usually referred to simply as the Principia.
Written in the form of a series of densely worked geometrical axioms and proofs,
it remains the greatest and most inﬂuential scientiﬁc work ever written. It offered a
vision of a universe wound up by a cosmic hand and left to run down on its own
with all dynamic motions governed by the law of gravitation. The Principia brought
Newton worldwide fame and ensured his unequalled reputation in the scientiﬁc
community.
The Principia is divided into three books. In a prefatory section Newton deﬁnes
concepts of mechanics such as inertia, momentum, and force; he then states the
three famous laws of motion, which are:

Law I A body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line,
unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.
Law II The change (in the quantity) of motion is proportional to the motive power
impressed and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is
impressed.
In the deﬁnition of motion, Newton means the mass times the velocity. Hence
the change in motion, if the mass is constant, is the change in velocity, i.e., the
acceleration.
Law III For every action, there is always an opposite and equal reaction, or the
mutual actions of the two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to
contrary parts. Although his discoveries were among many made during the
Scientiﬁc Revolution, Isaac Newton’s universal principles of gravity found no
parallels in science at the time.
Newton’s legacy to modern science is rivaled only by the work of Albert
Einstein, who in the twentieth century, would overturn Newton’s concept of the
universe, stating that space, distance, and motion were not absolute but relative, and
that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had ever conceived.

Overview
A complete study of force systems and their applications requires understanding of
the fundamental concept of moment. We will deﬁne the moment of a force and how
to calculate it. The moment of a force is the tendency of the force to produce
rotation about any axis.
Learning Objectives

a force for many systems and to apply the principle of moments to ﬁnd the resultant
of a non-concurrent force system. You will also be able to deﬁne the equilibrium of
parallel forces in a plane, and compute support reactions in beams with the
application of moment of forces. Your knowledge, application, and problem solving
skills will be determined by your performance on the chapter test.

point A in one direction, and about point B in the opposite direction. Some rule for
the direction of rotation is then necessary.

Solution As mentioned earlier, the moment of a force must be perpendicular to the
moment arm.
Now, we can resolve the force into its x and y components (Fx and Fy) as shown
in Fig. 3.6. Fx, however, does not contribute to the moment of force F, because it is
not perpendicular to the moment arm. In this case, only Fy will contribute to the
calculation of moment of force F.

Principle of Moments
The principle of moments, called Varignon’s theorem, states that the moment of a
force about a point is exactly equal to the sum of the moments of the components of
that force about the point. This principle is used in calculating the moment of a
force when it is too difﬁcult to calculate the perpendicular distance (see Example
3.3). A variety of structural problems in mechanics of materials can be dealt with
through the principle of moments by using the rectangular components of the force.
Example 3.5 Determine the moment of the 200-N force shown in Fig. 3.8 with
respect to point O.

Fig. 3.8
Solution The easiest way to solve the problem is to use the principle of moments.
In this case we need to resolve the given 200-N force the along x and y axes. The
components are:
Fx ¼ 200 cos 30 ¼ 173N
Fy ¼ 200 sin 30 ¼ 100N
and the moment of force F, using the principle of moments, is the sum of the
moments of force components about the point O. Then we have:
Mo ¼ 173  1:5 þ 100  5 ¼ 760N:m

3.4
Moment Equation for Equilibrium
The moment equation for equilibrium with respect to a point states that the sum of
the moments of all the forces about that point is equal to zero. In other words, the
resultant moment about that point is zero. That means:
X
M ¼ 0
Example 3.6 The condition of moment equilibrium about a pivot point O (Fig. 3.9)
of two forces F1 and F2 is:

If
F1 ¼ 180 N
F2 ¼ 300 N
r1 ¼ 320 cm
From Eq. (3.2), we get,
r2

ð
Þ=F2 ¼ 180N  320cm

The principle of moment equilibrium was known thousands years ago, and the
lever was used in the construction of the pyramids as well as in a variety of
ingenious devices and mechanisms.

Equilibrium of Parallel Coplanar Forces
Forces whose lines of actions are not intersecting each other are called parallel
forces. The resultant of parallel forces which are in equilibrium is equal to zero. In
fact, the equilibrium equations for parallel forces are
X
Fx ¼ 0
X
Fy ¼ 0
X
M ¼ 0
Note that in a parallel force system, the problem cannot be solved without using
the moment equation. That means the ﬁrst two equations above are necessary for
equilibrium conditions, but are not themselves sufﬁcient. With the moment equa-
tion, the force system equilibrium will be established.
The principle involved in the study and application of parallel forces is best
understood by a simple example. Let’s look at the following beam (Fig. 3.22)
experiencing three forces at points A, B, and C. We can check whether the beam is
in equilibrium.

The sum of the forces is: 40 + 80  120 ¼ 0.
We compute the moment of forces about points A, B, and C as follows:

ð
Þ  4  120
ð
Þ ¼ 480  480 ¼ 0
These results illustrate the principle that the above parallel forces are in equilib-
rium, and that the sum of their moments about any axis through any point is zero. In
other words, if a body is in equilibrium, it must neither translate nor rotate. Then the
conditions for static equilibrium are as follows:
1. The algebraic sum of the forces must be equal to zero.
X
F ¼ 0
2. The algebraic sum of the moments about any axis through any point must be
equal to zero.

M ¼ 0

Applications of Moment of Forces
One of the applications of the moment of forces is to determine the reactions in a
beam-loaded system. The loads can be concentrated or distributed loads. A special
type of distributed load is a uniformly distributed load, or a load with constant
density. Examples of these types of loading will be shown later.

Distributed Load Systems
There are many problems in mechanics of materials that deal with certain types of
distributed load. Examples of distributed load are things like roof loads, ﬂoor loads,
wind loads, and snow loads. If the load is distributed uniformly along the length, it
is called a uniformly distributed load. Distributed loads can also be non-uniform.
Distributed loads normally are depicted by a diagram, called a load diagram. The
resultant of a distributed load is simply the area of the load diagram (Fig. 3.27).

Example 3.13 Compute the magnitude of the reactions for the beam shown

Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 B.C.)
Of all the Greek philosophers who concerned themselves with physical phenomena,
Archimedes of Syracuse was the most notable and was closest to what we now
consider a scientist. Archimedes, the son of the astronomer Phidias, was born at
Syracuse in 287 B.C., and was good friends with King Hieron, the local ruler.
Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading
scientists in classical antiquity. He spent part of his youth in Egypt learning
mathematics from the immediate successors of Euclid.
Archimedes combined theory and experiment in a manner similar to scientiﬁc
procedure today, but no body of basic scientiﬁc principles resulted from his work.
He was a great experimentalist, a physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer.
He tied geometry to mechanics and used geometrical arguments ingeniously to
make his proofs. In mechanics he wrote On the Equilibrium of Planes or The
Centers of Gravity of Planes, a work in two books. He is most famous for his
discovery of the principle of buoyancy (the Archimedes principle), the water snail,
Archimedes screw, a helical pump for raising water for irrigation, and the astro-
nomical cross-staff with which he made accurate celestial observations.
Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 B.C.)
77

He is credited with designing innovative machines, such as compound pulleys,
and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion. He
demonstrated his mathematical skill by showing how to deduce geometrically the
number pi (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) to any desired
accuracy. He did this by approximating the circumference of a circle with the
perimeter of a circumscribed or inscribed many-sided regular polygon.
He was also one of the ﬁrst to apply mathematics to physical phenomena,
founding hydrostatics and statics, including an explanation of the principle of the
lever. Unlike Aristotle, whose mechanics is integrated into a theory of physics
which goes so far as to incorporate a system of the world, Archimedes made an
autonomous theoretical science of statics, based on postulates of experimental
origin and afterwards supported by mathematically rigorous demonstrations.
How much Archimedes truly preferred the theoretical to the practical may never
be known. It is clear, however, that in his work there is tension between theory and
application, a tension that still prevails mathematics 22 centuries later. Archimedes
died at the age 75.

Centroid of an Area

Overview
For most of the problems in mechanics of materials, it frequently happens that we
must determine the position of the centroid; this is accomplished most readily by
mathematical methods. This chapter is designed to show what the centroid of an
area is and how to ﬁnd it. Knowing the centroid of an area is very useful in
structural design, especially when a beam is subjected to loads that cause it to
bend about a neutral axis which passes through the centroid.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to deﬁne and determine the location
of the centroid of a plane ﬁgure, and then use the mathematical concept of moment of
an area to ﬁnd the centroid of various shapes. Your knowledge, application, and
problem solving skills will be determined by your performance on the chapter test.
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
•
Deﬁne center of gravity
•
Deﬁne and compute the centroid of a simple area
•
Deﬁne and compute the moment of a simple area with respect to an axis
•
Deﬁne a composite area
•
Compute the moment of a composite area with respect to an axis
•
Determine the location of the centroid of a composite area
4.1
Center of Gravity
Imagine that a body is composed of an inﬁnite number of small particles, and each
particle has its own gravitational force that acts towards the Earth’s center. These
forces are assumed to be a parallel force system, and the resultant of these forces
(the weight of the body) will act through a point, the body’s center of gravity.

4.2
Centroid of an Area
If we assume that a body is very thin with uniform thickness, then the resultant of
forces would be proportional to the area instead of the volume. The location of this
resultant is called the centroid of the area. Location of the centroid is deﬁned by
x and y coordinates from a set a reference axes (Fig. 4.1). The centroid of an area is a
very important point in structural engineering design due to the fact that the bending
of the objects occurs about the neutral axis where the location of the centroid is.

The position of the centroid for symmetrical shapes will be along the line of
symmetry. Or, if there are two lines of symmetry, the centroid will be at their point
of intersection. We will ﬁrst show the centroid of a plane area, and then the centroid
of a composite area will be discussed later in this chapter.
For example, the centroid of a symmetrical ﬁgure such as a rectangle is the point
of intersection of the diagonals (Fig. 4.2a), and the centroid of a circular area is its
geometrical center, i.e. its center (Fig. 4.2b). The centroid of a triangular area is at a
distance equal to one-third of the perpendicular distance measured from any side to
the opposite vertex (Fig. 4.2c).

Now we will show you how to ﬁnd the location of the centroid of some simple
geometrical ﬁgures. Most of these ﬁgures you already know, but some of these
ﬁgures have formulas whose proofs require calculus, which puts them beyond the
scope of this book. However, the student is encouraged to pursue them if he/she is
interested.

The distance from the centroid to the y axis is:
Xc ¼ 2=3 6
ð Þ þ 2 ¼ 4cm þ 2cm ¼ 6 cm;
so the coordinates of the centroid are C (6, 6).

Moment of a Simple Area
The concept of moment of an area is used to simplify the calculation of the centroid
of a plane ﬁgure. It is deﬁned as the product of the area and the normal distance of
the centroid of the area from a given axis.
The moment of an area can be found with respect to the x axis or the y axis.
Suppose we want to calculate the moment of the rectangular area shown (Fig. 4.11)
with respect to the x axis. Then we multiply the area by the normal distance from the
centroid to the x axis. This mathematically is represented as:
Mx ¼ AYc
Yc
X
Y
Xc
Fig. 4.11
In the same manner, the moment of an area with respect to the y axis is the
product of the area and the normal distance from the centroid to the y axis. This is
also represented as:
My ¼ AXc
The unit for the moment of an area in the English system is in.2  in. ¼ in.3, and
in the metric system it is mm2  mm ¼ mm3. This kind of dimension may not be
conceivable to most of us; it is just a mathematical concept.
Now, to calculate the moment of a simple area, such as a rectangle, triangle,
square, or circle, with respect to the x or y axis, we simply multiply the value of the
area by the centroid normal distance from the axis to get the moment of an area with
respect to the given axis.

x and y axes.

Solution The area of the triangle is

The distance from the centroid to the base of the triangle is
h=3 ¼ 90=3 ¼ 30mm
and the distance from the centroid to the x axis is
Yc ¼ 30mm þ 30mm ¼ 60mm
Therefore, the moment of the area with respect to the x axis is
Mx ¼ 2, 700mm2  60mm ¼ 162, 000mm3
We can repeat the same procedure to ﬁnd the moment of the area of the above
triangle with respect to the y axis.
The distance from the centroid to the y axis is
Xc ¼ 2=3 60
ð
Þ þ 20mm ¼ 60mm;
and the moment of area with respect to y axis is

Moment of a Composite Area
Generally, the moment of an area with respect to any axis is equal to the sum of the
moments of the divided parts of the entire area with respect to the axis. In other
words, if we are looking at the moment of a complicated area, it is logical to divide
it into simple areas, ﬁnd the moment of each of these areas, and then add all the
moments to obtain the moment of the entire area. The following examples will
clarify this idea.

Centroids of Composite Areas
To ﬁnd the centroid of a composite area, we must calculate the moment of the
composite area as shown in earlier examples. That means we have to follow the
approach by dividing the composite area into simple areas, and then ﬁnd the
moment of each simple area. Once we add the moments of these areas together,
we get the moment of the composite area with respect to the x or y axis.
Now we can locate the centroid of a composite area, given the moment of a
composite area and also the total area. The rest of the calculation is simply a basic
algebraic operation. The process is shown in the following examples.

Moment of Inertia

Overview
When we study equations in mechanics of materials, we use some of the properties
of sections. One of these properties that depends on the size and shape of the
member is called the moment of inertia. Moment of inertia is a mathematical
property of an area that controls resistance to bending, buckling, or rotation of
the member.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to calculate the moment of inertia
of an area. Also, you will learn about of one the important properties of an area.
This property is used extensively in structural engineering designs dealing with
bending or rotation of the members. Your knowledge, application, and problem
solving skills will be determined by your performance on the chapter test.
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
•
Deﬁne the moment of an area
•
Deﬁne and calculate the moment of inertia of a simple area
•
Deﬁne and calculate the moment of inertia using the parallel axis theorem with
respect to an axis other than the centroidal axis
•
Calculate the moment of inertia of a composite area
5.1
Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia of an area is the capacity of a cross section to resist bending or
buckling. It represents a mathematical concept that is dependent on the size and
shape of the section of the member. The bending axis of a member is also the
centroidal axis; therefore, the ability to locate the centroid of a shape is closely
associated with moment of inertia. Engineers use the moment of inertia to determine
the state of stress in a section, and determine the amount of deﬂection in a beam.

The deﬁnition of the moment of inertia of an area can be thought of as the sum of
the products of all the small areas and the squares of their distances from the axis
being considered. This gives
X
ay2
withrespecttothexaxis
or
X
ax2
withrespecttotheyaxis
If we represent the moment of inertia by the letter I, then the moment of inertia
with respect to the x axis is
Ix ¼
X
ay2
Similarly, the moment of inertia with respect to the y axis is
Iy ¼
X
ax2
Units
Moment of inertia is expressed in units of length to the fourth power. Although
dimensionally speaking it seems unusual, it is just a mathematical abstract and is an
important property in the design of beams and columns. We will see in the
following examples the methods of calculating the moment of inertia for a given
beam section subjected to bending. If we choose the unit of length as in., then the
unit of the moment of inertia is
in:2  in:2 ¼ in:4
In the metric system, if the unit of length taken is mm, then the unit of the
moment of inertia is
mm2  mm2 ¼ mm4
5.2
Moment of Inertia of Simple Areas
Using calculus and integrating equations for an area, we will be able to extract the
exact values for the moment of inertia. Derivation of the moment of inertia
formulas for most commonly used shapes such as rectangle, triangle, and circle
are given in Table 5.1. The radius of gyration (r) of an area in the table represents
the distance from the moment of inertia axis at which the entire area could be
considered without changing its moment of inertia. The radius of gyration is a
property of a shape’s area and is mostly used in column design. It is expressed as

r ¼ √I=A
J is called the polar moment of inertia and is deﬁned as the moment of inertia
with respect to an axis perpendicular to the plane of the area. In this case, it could be
the Z–Z axis perpendicular to the X–Y plane.
Therefore,
J ¼
X
ar2
where
r2 ¼ x2 + y2 for any right triangle, and r is the moment arm.
It must be noted here that these formulas are only applicable for an area’s
centroidal axis. However, to ﬁnd the moment of inertia for an axis other than the
centroidal axis, a different approach which will be discussed later in this chapter
is used.

Parallel Axis Theorem
When it is necessary to ﬁnd the moment of inertia of an area with respect to any axis
other than the centroidal axis, the parallel axis theorem must be used. This theorem
simply says that the moment of inertia with respect to any axis parallel to its
centroidal axis is equal to its centroidal moment of inertia plus the area times the
square of the distance between two axes. This theorem is also called the transfer
formula (Fig. 5.13).
In equation form:
Ix ¼ Ixc þ Ad2
or
Iy ¼ Iyc þ Ad2
Here Ix and Iy are the moments of inertia of an area with respect to the x and
y axes, respectively. Ixc and Iyc are the moments of inertia with respect to the
centroidal axis. A is the area of the cross section, and d is the perpendicular distance
between the two parallel axes.

Moment of Inertia of Composite Areas
As we discussed earlier in Chap. 4, a composite area is an area that can be divided
into simple areas. Composite areas are frequently used in the construction industry,
such as in I-beams and column cross sections, or other structural members. To
calculate the moment of inertia for a composite area, we simply apply the same type

of formulations and methodology that we used for simple areas, except that we must
add the moment of inertia of each part to come up with the total moment of inertia
of the entire area, which is the moment of inertia of the composite area.

Chapter Summary
The moment of inertia is a property of an area. It is a mathematical quantity that
affects the load-carrying capacity of beams and columns. An increase in the
moment of inertia with respect to an axis will produce higher resistance to bending
forces. The unit of inertia is in.4, or mm4. Moments of inertia with respect to the
centroidal x and y axes are

Stress and Strain

Overview
Designers of machinery and structures must know the relationship between the
external forces acting on elastic bodies and the internal forces developed due to the
inﬂuence of these forces. In this chapter, we will study new technical terms such as
stress, strain, deformation, and modulus of elasticity. These are the concepts that a
designer must take into consideration when dealing with elastic bodies. Both the
analysis and the design of various elements of a structure are involved the determi-
nation of stress and deformation and the selection of proper materials based on the
principles of mechanics of materials.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to deﬁne and compute tensile or
compressive stress, shear stress, and allowable stress. Also, you will be able to
calculate the deformation (elongation) of elastic bodies subject to external forces
and plot the stress–strain diagrams for different materials, and identify the modulus
of elasticity based on the stress–strain diagrams of materials. Your knowledge,
application, and problem solving skills will be determined by your performance on
the chapter test.
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
•
Deﬁne and compute stress under tension or compression
•
Deﬁne shearing stress and allowable stress in building structures
•
Deﬁne and calculate deformation (elongation) of different materials
•
Deﬁne and compute strain under tension or compression
•
Deﬁne modulus of elasticity and its importance in designing structural members
•
Illustrate a stress–strain diagram and its properties

6.1
Simple Stress
When a body is subjected to external forces a system of internal forces is developed.
It is important in engineering mechanics to determine the intensity of these forces
on the various cross section portions of the body, as the resistances to applied
forces depend on these intensities. This intensity is called stress and it is a measure
of the resisting forces. Stress is determined by dividing the total applied load (force)
F, by the total area of loaded cross section A. This is expressed as
σ ¼ F=A
The unit of stress in the metric system is newtons per square meter (N/m2). One
newton per square meter is equivalent to one pascal (Pa). The unit of stress in the
English system is pounds per square inch (psi).
There is, however, another unit in engineering calculations: kilo-pounds, which
is equivalent to 1,000 lb and is abbreviated as kip. In this case, the unit of stress will
be kilo-pounds per square inch, or ksi.
6.2
Components of Stress
The internal resistance F is decomposed into component Fn perpendicular to the
plane (known as normal force) and a force component Ft, parallel to the plane
(known as shear force). The quantities Fn/A and Ft/A represent average normal and
shear forces per unit area. These quantities are called normal stress and shear stress
respectively. In general, normal and shear stresses are not uniformly distributed
over the entire area of interest, and their magnitudes shall be found at any point
within the area. However, in special cases where the components of Fn and Ft are
uniformly distributed over the entire area A, the above equations for normal and
shear stresses can be applied.
6.3
Tensile and Compressive Stresses
Tensile and compressive stresses are normal stresses developed within a body as a
result of external forces. These stresses are axial stresses and act along the longitu-
dinal axis of the member. Their action is in the same direction as the applied force.
In the tensile or compressive stress, the force is applied normal to the cross
section under consideration, however if the transverse force is applied to a member
the internal forces develop in the plane of the cross section and they are called
shearing forces (Fig. 6.1). Since shear distribution in the cross section of the
member is not necessarily uniform, an average shear stress is used. Examples of
shear stress are found in bolts, rivets and pins that are being used for connecting of
various structural members.

Definitions
The following are the useful terms that are extensively used in engineering gener-
ally, and mechanics of materials especially.
Allowable Stress
Allowable stress is the maximum stress that a member can
safely sustain in service. It is also called design stress.
Brittleness
Brittleness is the property of a material to fail without exces-
sive deformation
Ductility
Ductility is the property of a material that allows the material to
elongate under certain stress without breaking. Some materials
like copper, and gold are relatively more ductile than others.
Elasticity
Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its size and
shape after elastic deformation.
Elastic Limit
Elastic limit is the highest value of the stress for which the
material behaves elastically.
Hardness
Hardness is the resistance of a material to penetration and
abrasion.
Malleability
Malleability is the property of a material with which it deforms
under compressive stress without rupture. It is the tendency that
the material to be hammered or rolled into sheets.
6.4
Definitions
145

Plasticity
Plasticity is the property of a material with which it deforms
under stress without rupture and not to return to its original size
and shape.
Stiffness
Stiffness is the resistance of material to bending or deformation.
Strength
Strength of a material is the ability to withstand high forces
without failure. Some materials represent better resistance than
others. For instance, compressive and tensile strengths of steel
are the same, whereas concrete is strong in compression and
weak in tension.
Toughness
Toughness is the resistance of material to high forces without
breaking.
6.5
Normal Stresses Under Axial Tension or Compression
As we discussed earlier, tensile and compressive internal forces develop in the
structural members when they are under the axial loads. The internal forces will
distribute over the entire cross section and create normal stresses in the cross
section of the member. Figure 6.3 shows the force distribution on the cross section
of the bar directed to the left when the force F is directed to the right.

When the member is under tension, the stress is called tensile stress. If the
member is under compression, then the stress is called compressive stress. Tensile
and compressive stresses are called normal stresses, since the force F and the force
distribution are both perpendicular to the cross section of the member (Fig. 6.4).
Normal stress formula σ ¼ F/A discussed earlier, can be applied for tensile or
compressive stresses conditionally the force F is centrally applied to the cross
section of the member.

Stress and Strain

Note that the sense of the stress is also important. It cannot be determined from
the sign of the force vector. If the stress is tending to stretch the body or pull it apart,
it is called tension. Any tension is considered positive. If the stress is compressive
or squashing the body, it is called compression and carries a negative sign.

ing structures, it is essential that the structure not fail. Thus, the design is based on
some lower value called allowable stress or design stress. If, for example, a certain
type of steel is known to have an ultimate strength of 110,000 psi, a lower allowable
stress would be used for design, say 55,000 psi. This allowable stress would allow
only half the load the ultimate stress would allow. Allowable stress values are
different for different materials, and they are tabulated and recommended by the
International Building Code Association.
The ratio of the ultimate stress to the allowable stress is known as the factor of
safety.
factorof safety ¼ ultimatestrength = allowablestress

of 50,000 lb if the allowable tensile stress of the steel is 25, 000 psi.

Tensile and Compressive Strain
When a deformable body is subjected to stresses, it undergoes deformation. Defor-
mation is normally accompanied by a geometrical change of the body. In other
words, the dimensions of a body may be elongated or shortened. The total defor-
mation, or change in the shape or size of a body under the force is called elongation,
shown by symbol δ. If, for example, the original length of a rod is L, and after the
rod experiences a tensile force is Lf, the elongation is
δ ¼ L  Lf
In most engineering problems, it will be more meaningful to express the
deformation on a unit basis. Therefore, we use tensile or compressive strain. Strain,
represented by the symbol ε, is deﬁned as the total deformation (δ) of a body
divided by the original length of the body to indicate its unit deformation and is
written as
ε ¼ δ=L
Note that, by deﬁnition, strain is a dimensionless quantity. However, it is
common to express strain in units of length divided by units of original length,
such as inches per in or mm/mm.

Strain is sometimes used as a synonym for deformation. For example, if the
elongation of a 20-ft rod under a tensile force is 0.15 in. (i.e. δ ¼ 0.15 in.), the strain
or deformation is
ε ¼ δ=L ¼ 0:15in:= 20  12in:
ð
Þ ¼ 0:000625in:=in:
In this example, the total elongation is 0.15 in. and the deformation (strain) is
0.000625 and has no physical unit, so the strain would be the same whether we are
working with English units or metric units. Figures 6.17 and 6.18 show the applied

The Relationship Between Stress and Strain
The relationship between stress and strain exists in most engineering testing of
materials. Experiments show that when a specimen is subjected to tensile stress,
there is a closely proportional increase in strain, such that strain increases in direct
relation to stress as long as stress is kept within certain limits. If the generated stress
exceeds the limiting value, the corresponding strain will no longer be proportional
to the stress. This limiting value is known as the proportional limit.
Robert Hooke (1635–1703), discovered that stress and strain are directly pro-
portional to each other. He plotted the calculated values of stress and strain for
increasing the load and called it a stress–strain diagram, known as Hooke’s law. A
stress–strain diagram shows a linear relationship between stress and strain as long
as the values of stress are not too high (Fig. 6.19). Thomas Young (1773–1829)
found out that the ratio of the stress and strain values remained constant. This
constant is now called Young’s modulus or the modulus of elasticity (E). Note that
the slope of the straight line part of the diagram is known as the modulus of
elasticity of the material.

The mathematical relation between stress, strain, and the modulus of elasticity is
expressed by the equation
E ¼ stress=strain: ¼ σ=ε
Modulus of elasticity E is an important property in engineering with which
engineers can predict the behavior of materials. It can be interpreted as the measure
of the stiffness of a material. That means that materials with higher values of
modulus of elasticity are stiffer than others, and they have more ability to resist a
deformation. The value of the modulus of elasticity is constant for a speciﬁc
material and can be found in a table for a number of common materials. The unit
for modulus of elasticity in the metric system is expressed in pascals (Pa) or mega-
pascals (MPa) and, in the English system is pounds per square inch (psi).

Chapter Summary
Engineers must ﬁrst identify the external forces acting on a structural member, and
then calculate the internal resistance, called stress, developed by the member.
Based on this, and other related properties such as strain and the modulus of
elasticity, the designer is able to select the material and design the size and shape
of the member that will properly resist the applied forces.

Stress and Strain

The materials used vary in quality and physical and mechanical characteristics.
Hence, it is important that a designer have good knowledge of the properties of the
materials being used. In this chapter, we introduced the concepts of stress, strain,
and deformation, and the relationship between stress and strain in different
materials.
Stress is deﬁned as the force per unit area for a speciﬁc material under loading.
The unit of stress in the English system is psi, and in the metric system is Pa, or
MPa. There are three normal stresses: tensile stress, compressive stress, and shear
stress. These may be calculated using the stress formula:
σ ¼ F=A
Strain is deﬁned as the total deformation, or stretching, per unit length of the
member. The formula to calculate the strain is
ε ¼ δ=L
Stress is directly proportional to the strain:
σ ¼ E  ε
This relation is known as Hooke’s law and the proportionality constant is called
the modulus of elasticity (E) of the material. The modulus of elasticity is a measure
of a material’s resistance to deformation. The above linear equation is valid
provided that the stress does not exceed the proportional limit of the material.
The proportional limit is the maximum stress for which stress is proportional to
strain.

Stephen P. Timoshenko (1878–1972)
Stepan Prokopovych Timoshenko was born on December 22, 1878 in the village of
Shpotivka in the Ukrain. Timoshenko’s early life seems to have been a happy one in
pleasant rural surroundings. He studied at a “realnaya” school from 1889 to 1896.
Timoshenko continued his education towards a university degree at the
St. Petersburg Institute of Engineering. After graduating in 1901, he stayed on
teaching in this same institution from 1901 to 1903 and then worked at the
St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute under Viktor Kyrpychov 1903–1906. His
restlessness and discontent with the educational system extant in Russia at that
time motivated the young Timoshenko to venture out to explore, examine, and
assimilate diverse pedagogical views and cultures in France, Germany, and
England. In 1905 he was sent for 1 year to the University of Go¨ttingen where he
worked under Ludwig Prandtl.
In the fall of 1906 he was appointed to the Chair of Strengths of Materials at the
Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Thanks to his tormented spirit at this institute,
Timoshenko took the plunge to writing his maiden Russian classic, Strength of
Materials in 1908 (Part I) and 1910 (Part II). From 1907 to 1911 as a professor at
the Polytechnic Institute he did research in the area of ﬁnite element methods of
elastic calculations, and did excellent research work on buckling. He was elected
dean of the Division of Structural Engineering in 1909.
In 1911 he was awarded the D. I. Zhuravski prize of St. Petersburg; he went there
to work as a Professor in the Electro-technical Institute and the St. Petersburg
Institute of the Railways (1911–1917). During that time he developed the theory of
elasticity and the theory of beam deﬂection, and continued to study buckling.
In 1922 Timoshenko moved to the United States where he worked for the
Westinghouse Electric Corporation from 1923 to 1927, after which he became a
faculty professor at the University of Michigan where he created the ﬁrst bachelor’s
and doctoral programs in engineering mechanics. His textbooks have been
published in 36 languages. His ﬁrst textbooks and papers were written in Russian;
later in his life, he published mostly in English.
Stephen P. Timoshenko (1878–1972)
161

The following 3 years 1935–1937, Timoshenko teamed up with Gere and Young
for three more books: a condensed guide of strength of materials, elastic stability,
and engineering mechanics. These unique texts explore intricate mathematical
techniques to explain some subtle aspects underlying elasticity and stability to
give new insight into the behavior of solids and structures for engineering design.
From 1936 onward he was a professor at Stanford University.
The year 1953 saw the great Timoshenko epic, The History of Strength of
Materials with a brief account of the history of the theory of elasticity and structural
mechanics. Tracing the history all the way back to Archimedes, he carries the
reader through the period of Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Hooke, Newton, Mariotte,
Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, and Coloumb, reaching the end of the eighteenth
century.
This missionary zeal of Timoshenko for writing books for improving teaching
and for guiding practical engineers has played a key role in uplifting technical
education worldwide, but more emphatically in the United States. In 1960 he
moved to Wuppertal (Western Germany) to be with his daughter. He died in
1972 and his ashes are buried in Alta Mesa Memorial Park, Palo Alto, California.

Overview
In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamental concepts underlying normal
stress, strain, and shear stress in structural members. These stresses are developed
in a body to resist external forces. In this chapter we will study the shear stress in a
circular cross section when it is subjected to torsion. We will learn the concept of
torque, and the twisting action applied to the axis of a member, and then we will
determine the shear stresses developed to resist the application of torque, or
twisting moment.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to calculate the torque, or
twisting moment, on a circular section of a shaft and to calculate the torsional
shearing stresses developed on the cross-sectional planes of a shaft. Also, you will
learn how to calculate the transmitting power (in horsepower) developed by a
rotational shaft. Your knowledge, application, and problem solving skills will be
determined by your performance on the chapter test.
7.1
Torque
When a circular bar is subjected to a twisting action it tends to twist; the stresses
developed in the bar are called torsional stresses. In other words, the bar is subjected
to torque, or twisting moment, and is said to be in torsion, or under torsional load.
Torque is expressed in units of length and force. The unit of torque in the English
system is inch-pounds, and in the metric system is newton-meters. The torque on a
shaft is applied through pulleys or gears at different locations of the shaft, and the
amount of the torque at any point on the shaft is the moment of the force along the
axis of the shaft (Fig. 7.1).

Torsional Shearing Stress in a Solid Circular Shaft
Let’s take a look at a circular shaft (Fig. 7.4) that is ﬁxed at one end and free at the
other end. When the shaft is subjected to torque, the shearing stresses occur in the
circular cross section of the shaft. The direction of the shearing stress at any point in
the cross section is perpendicular to the radius of the shaft at the point of interest
(Fig. 7.5).

Consider an inﬁnitesimal area a located on the shaft. It can be shown that the

1. For design purposes, the above formula (7.6) is only valid for a solid circular

2. Developed shear stresses are assumed to be below the proportional limit, and
shaft materials follow Hooke’s law. Beyond the elastic limit the formula will no
longer be valid.

Transmission of Power by a Rotating Shaft
A common objective of rotating shaft design is to transmit the power. When the
torque is applied to a shaft and turns the shaft, work is performed. By deﬁnition,
work is the product of the magnitude of the displacement and the component of the
force in the direction of the displacement. This can be expressed as
W ¼ F  x
where x is the distance that a belt or cable moves on the pulley because of applied
torque. Since the applied torque turns the shaft, this linear distance can be modiﬁed
to circular distance. Therefore, the above formula for work can be written as
W ¼ T θ
where T is torque applied on the shaft, and θ is angle of rotation in radians.
Power is deﬁned as work done per unit time:
P ¼ W=t
The unit of work in the metric system is N.m or Joule (J). The unit of time is the
second and the unit of power is J/s ¼ Watt (W). In the English system, the unit of
work is the ft-lb; the unit of time is the second, and the unit of power is ft-lb/s. No

conversion between ft-lb/s and horsepower.
1horsepower hp
ð
Þ ¼ 550ftlb=s ¼ 33, 000ftlb=min
or
1hp ¼ 39, 600in:lb=min
The work done in one revolution is 2 π T and the new formula for work per
minute is
W=min ¼ 2π T n
or
Power ¼ work=time
T the unit of T is in.-lb, and n is the number of revolutions per min (RPM).
Substituting this information in the formula for power (HP), we get:
HP ¼ 2π T n=396, 000 ¼ T n=63, 025
Note that 39,600 in.-lb per minute is equal to 1 HP.

order to make the metric system work. The unit of torque must be N.m, and rpm (n)
will be divided by 60 to become rps. The equation for the metric system, then, is

Chapter Summary
When the torque, or twisting moment, is applied to a circular shaft, it tends to rotate
the shaft. This action causes torsional shear stresses that develop in the shaft. In a
solid circular shaft, these stresses vary linearly from the center of the shaft to a
maximum at the outer surface of the shaft. This is expressed as
τmax ¼ 16T=πd3

Shear and Bending Moment in Beams
8
Overview
A beam is one of the most common structural pieces loaded by forces acting
perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. It is supported at its ends, where it supports
the loads. The study of beams is important to a designer; designers must carefully
study the behavior of the beam and choose the material and its dimensions so that
the beam will safely carry the loading. In this chapter we will show how to evaluate
shear force and bending moment in the beam and how to use this determination to
design a beam. Shear force and bending moment are developed internally by
external loading and reactions.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to deﬁne beam and loading and
calculate shear force and bending moment in the beam at different cross sections.
You will also learn how to construct shear and moment diagrams for various beam
loadings. Your knowledge, application, and problem solving skills will be deter-
mined by your performance on the chapter test.
8.1
Types of Beams
A beam is a member which is long compared to its cross-sectional dimension, and is
loaded by the forces perpendicular to its long dimension. The beam is in equilib-
rium under the action of an applied system of forces and the reactions. Beams can
be classiﬁed into types by the number and position of supports.
1. Simply supported beam: If the beam supports at the ends are either pins or
rollers, the beam is called simply supported or a simple beam. Note that there is
no restraint against rotation or translation at the supports (Fig. 8.1).

2. Fixed beam: A beam is called a ﬁxed beam if it is supported by two ﬁxed
supports that do not allow any end rotation or translation as the beam is loaded
(Fig. 8.2).
P
Fig. 8.2
3. Cantilever beam: A beam with a ﬁxed support at one end and the other end
unsupported is called a cantilever beam. Under loading, the ﬁxed support does
not allow rotation or translation (Fig. 8.3).
P
Fig. 8.3
4. Overhanging beam: A beam with one or two supports that are not positioned at
the ends of the beam is called an overhanging beam (Fig. 8.4)

The simply supported, cantilever, and overhanging beams are grouped as stati-
cally determinant, because their reactions can be calculated using three laws of
equilibrium:
∑Fx ¼ 0, ∑Fy ¼ 0, and ∑M ¼ 0. The ﬁxed and continuous beams are grouped as
statically indeterminate, because their reactions cannot be calculated only by using
the above equations.
In this case, an additional equation based on the deformation situation of the
beam must be established.
8.2
Types of Loadings
Loads on beams are classiﬁed as concentrated or distributed.
1. Concentrated load: This load acts over a short length of a beam and at a deﬁnite
point. The unit of concentrated load in the English system is pounds or kips, and
in the metric system is newtons (Fig. 8.6).

2. Distributed load: This load spreads out over a considerable length of a beam.
One form of distributed load is called a uniformly distributed load, which exists
over a partial or the entire length of a beam (Fig. 8.7)

In this type of loading, the load density is the same for the entire length of
loading. For example, if L ¼ 18 ft, and w (density) ¼ 300 lb-ft, then the total load is
300 lb-ft  18 ft ¼ 5,400 lb. The unit for load density in the English system is
pounds per linear foot (lb/ft, or kips per linear foot (kips/ft), and in the metric
system is newtons per meter (N/m). If the load is non-uniformly distributed, then
the beam has a varying density. In this case, the distributed load diagram looks like
a triangle (Fig. 8.8) or a trapezoid shape.

In engineering design and applications, the loads may be classiﬁed as dead loads
or live loads. Dead loads are permanent static loads which are imposed on a
structure, such as the weight of the structural members, materials, and equipment.
Live loads are movable loads such as vehicles and people or natural forces like ice,
wind, earthquake, snow, or any other impacts that inﬂuence motion on a structure.
8.3
Beam Reactions
To analyze and compute the internal forces along the beam, ﬁrst it is necessary to
ﬁnd the beam reactions. To determine the beam reactions we must apply the three
laws of equilibrium as we studied earlier. These laws stated:
The algebraic sum of all forces in the horizontal and vertical directions must be equal to
zero. Also, the algebraic sum of moments in respect to any point must be equal to zero.
This, mathematically will be written as:

Fh ¼ 0
ð8:1Þ
180
8
Shear and Bending Moment in Beams

X
Fv ¼ 0
ð8:2Þ

M ¼ 0
ð8:3Þ
The ﬁrst and second equations above assure that the beam will not move in the
horizontal or vertical direction. The third law assures that the beam will not rotate
with respect to any point in the plane of action.

Shear Force
When a beam is subjected to applied forces, internal forces develop in the beam.
Since the beam has supports and the system is in an equilibrium condition, the beam
should resist these internal forces. This type of force is called shear force, or simply
shear. The magnitude of the shear has a direct effect on the magnitude of the shear
stress in the beam, and also on the design and analysis of the structural members.
Shear forces develop along the entire length of the beam, and their magnitude
varies at each cross section of the beam. They actually act perpendicularly to the
longitudinal axis of the beam. Our main objectives in ﬁnding the shear in beams are
twofold. First, we have to know the maximum value of the shear in order to design
the beam properly so that it can resist overall shear and will not fail when it is
loaded.
The second objective is to calculate the values of shear along the length of the
beam, so that we can ﬁnd out where the beam fails under bending and where the
shear value is zero. This will be clearly explained later in the section of shear/
bending moment diagrams.

8.5
Computation of Shear Force
As mentioned earlier, the designer must ﬁrst know the magnitude of the shear force
at any section of the beam to get the right picture of beam design. The magnitude of
shear force at any section of the beam is equal to the sum of all the vertical forces
either to the right or to the left of the section. To compute the shear force for any
section of the beam, we simply call the upward forces (reactions) positive and
downward forces (loads) negative. Then, the magnitude of the shear force at any
section of the beam is equal to sum of the reactions minus the sum of the loads to the
left of the section. This can be stated as:
Shear ¼ Reactions  Loads
To understand this concept, let’s try an example.

Shear Diagrams
In the previous section, we computed the value of shear at any section along the
length of a beam. Designing a beam requires the variation of shear at arbitrary
locations on the beam. This important task can be accomplished using a graphical
technique referred to as a shear diagram.
Shear diagrams are graphical representations of the shear force variations over
the length of a beam. The shear diagram shows the magnitude of shear at various
points along a beam and is useful in ﬁnding the maximum value of shear when
designing a beam.
The shear diagram is drawn directly underneath the free body diagram of the
beam and will show the variation of shear values over the length of the beam. The
following examples illustrate the construction of shear diagrams for a variety of
beam loadings.
Example 8.8 Construct a shear diagram for the simply supported beam shown
(Fig. 8.33).

Solution First we calculate the reactions. Using the laws of equilibrium, we ﬁnd
that RA ¼ 400 lb and RB ¼ 100 lb. Remember, to calculate the shear at any section,
we use the equation
V ¼ R  L
where V is the shear, R is the reaction, and L is the load at the left side of the section.
Now we proceed to calculate the shear from reaction A until we reach a load of
500 lb. We will see that the shear value does not change and follows a horizontal
straight line with a constant value of
V ¼ þ400  0 ¼ þ400lb
At the load 500 lb, the shear suddenly passes from positive to negative quantity,
because
V ¼ þ400  500 ¼ 100lb
Obviously, the shear goes to zero on the baseline when it suddenly passes from a
positive to a negative quantity. From this point on until it reaches reaction B, the
shear again stays constant on the horizontal line and its value is V ¼ 100 lb. Notice
that the value of the shear is represented by the distance from the baseline to the
shear diagram (Fig. 8.34).

Notice that the shear decreases uniformly as x increases. At the center of the span
(x ¼ 7 ft) the shear goes to zero. Plotting the positive shear values above the
baseline and the negative shear values below the baseline results in a shear diagram
that resembles a sloping straight line (Fig. 8.38).

Bending Moment
In the last two sections, we discussed the shear force and shear diagram and their
important impact on designing a beam. In addition to these, there is another
important internal quantity that must be considered before the design stage can
proceed. This internal quantity is called the bending moment.
The bending moment at any section along the length of a beam is the measure of
the tendency of the beam to bend due to the forces acting on it. The bending moment
will vary, but at any section of a beam is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments
of the forces to either the right or to the left of the section.

Bending Moment Diagrams
A bending moment diagram is a diagram that shows the variations of bending
moment values at each cross section along a beam. A bending moment diagram like
the shear diagram discussed earlier is an important item in designing a beam. In
fact, the designer must simultaneously consider the shear and bending moment
diagrams, analyze them, and ﬁnd out where the bending moment diagram reaches a
maximum point.
8.10
Construction of a Bending Moment Diagram
To construct the bending moment diagram, we calculate the bending moment at the
sections of interest along the beam, and then we draw the diagram below the shear
diagram based on the calculated points of bending moments. The diagram does not
have to be to scale; a good approximation will do the job. Notice that the positive
bending moments are above the baseline, and the negative ones are below. Also,
usually for the beams loaded with concentrated forces, the bending moment dia-
gram is a straight line drawn between the forces.

that the value of maximum bending moment occurs at the section of the beam at
which the shear is zero (this can be proven using the knowledge of calculus).
In this example, the maximum value of the bending moment is at a distance of
8 ft from the RA. This value is 19,200 lb-ft. In designing the beams, the value of the
maximum bending moment is the moment with which we particularly are
concerned.

Chapter Summary
Under different types of loading, internal forces develop in the beam. These forces
are called shear forces. Shear force can be calculated at any arbitrary cross section
of a beam using the sum of the reactions and loads at the left side of the beam. This
was formulated as:
V ¼ R  L
The graphical representation of the shear along the length of the beam is called a
shear diagram. With the help of a shear diagram we can ﬁnd the value of shear at
any point along the beam. This method is very useful for helping a designer of
beams understand the variations of the shear along the length of a beam.
The calculation of the bending moment and its importance in designing a beam
can be shown with some simple examples. To calculate the bending moment, we
simply take into consideration the moment of all forces (reactions and loads) with
respect to any point to the left side of the point of interest. In fact, the bending
210
8
Shear and Bending Moment in Beams

moment at any section along the length of the beam is the measure of the tendency
of the beam to bend due to the forces acting on it.
Now we can introduce the moment diagram, and we show how important that is
for the designer to calculate both the values of shear and bending moment at any
point along the length of the beam. It can also be proven mathematically or
graphically that the maximum value of the bending moment will occur at the
section where the shear is zero.

Shear and Bending Moment in Beams

Bending Stresses in Beams
9
Overview
In the previous chapter we discussed the shear forces and bending moments that
were caused by applying external forces to a beam. Therefore, a beam must resist
these shear forces and bending moments. The beam itself must develop internal
resistance to (1) resist shear forces, referred to as shear stresses; and to (2) resist
bending moments, referred to as bending stresses or ﬂexural stresses. For beam
design purposes, it is very important to calculate the shear stresses and bending
stresses at the various locations of a beam. Since the shear stresses have been
covered earlier, this chapter will only emphasize the bending stresses that are
caused by bending moments.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to deﬁne the neutral plane, called
the plane of zero bending. You will also learn how to calculate the maximum
bending stress using the ﬂexure formula and compare it with the maximum resisting
moment when the design problem arises. Your knowledge, application, and problem
solving skill will be determined by your performance on the chapter test.
9.1
Introduction
When shear forces and bending moments develop in a beam because of external
forces, the beam will create internal resistance to these forces, called resisting
shearing stresses and bending stresses.
Consider the simply supported beam shown in Fig. 9.1 before it is subjected to
the load. If we look at a short length of the beam between the cross sections A-B and
C-D, we see that these two segments are parallel and of equal lengths. As the beam
is loaded and bends, points A and C move closer together and points B and D are
stretched at the bottom (Fig. 9.2).

In other words, segment AC shortens and segment BD lengthens. The top of the
beam is in compression and the bottom is in tension. The maximum compression
stress occurs at the upper ﬁber of the beam; the magnitude of the stress decreases
below the upper ﬁber, and eventually goes to zero at the neutral plane. The
intersection of the neutral plane with the cross-sectional plane is called the neutral
axis (Fig. 9.3). Also, the maximum tensile stress occurs at the bottom ﬁber of the
beam and goes to zero at the neutral plane.

The theory of beams plays an important role in structural design and is used by
the designer as a powerful technique to analyze various structures. In fact, beam
theory gives an accurate and deep understanding of the behavior of a structure. One
of the most useful models of beam theory was developed by Euler and Bernoulli,
known as the Euler–Bernoulli theory of beams. This theory was based on the
following assumptions:
1. The cross section of the beam is inﬁnitely rigid in its own plane.
2. The cross section of the beam remains in the plane after deformation.
3. The cross section of the beam remains normal to the deformed axis of the beam.
It has been assumed that the stress in any ﬁber does not exceed the proportional
limit of the material, and so it will support Hooke’s law—meaning that the stress is
216
9
Bending Stresses in Beams

proportional to the distance from the neutral plane and the sections A-B and C-D,
before and after bending, remain in a straight line (Fig. 9.4).
As a result, the stress distribution will have a triangular shape. Stress changes
from zero at the neutral axis to either a maximum compressive stress at the top outer
ﬁber or to a maximum tensile stress at the bottom outer ﬁber.

Resisting Moment
The next question is how do tension and compression stress resist the externally
applied bending moment. Consider a simple beam subjected to a concentrated load
P (Fig. 9.5). The free-body diagram shows the part of the beam to the left of the
cross section X-X. The reaction R1 creates a clockwise rotation with respect to
point O, which is the bending moment of the section. The next item is the moment
of the stresses on the cross section.

If we call the sum of the compressive stresses C and the sum of the tensile
stresses T, then the T-C couple is the resisting moment developed by the beam in
response to the externally applied bending moment (Fig. 9.6).

This resisting moment tends to cause a counterclockwise rotation, and is equal to
the bending moment if the beam is in equilibrium. Mathematically, this can be
written as
R1  a ¼ C  y þ T  y
This is called the theory of ﬂexure in beams. Knowing the bending moment of
the beam, we will be able to design the beam to resist bending and its resisting
moment is equal to the external bending moment.
9.3
The Flexure Formula
As we mentioned earlier, if the stresses in the beam are lower than the material’s
proportional limit, Hooke’s law can be applied; this means that the strains are
related to the stresses by a constant called the modulus of elasticity. In other words,
the bending stresses caused by bending moments are proportional to the distance
from the neutral axis of the beam. The relationship between the bending moment
(M) on the cross section, bending stresses (σ), and properties of the cross section,
called the ﬂexure formula, is applied for the purposes of analyzing and designing
beams.
The maximum bending stress at the outer ﬁber with a distance c from the neutral
axis is proportional to the bending stress at a distance y from the neutral axis.
Figure 9.6 shows maximum tension or compression bending stress at the outer ﬁber.
This can be written as
σy=y ¼ σmax=c
ð9:1Þ
σy ¼ yσmax=c
The internal resisting moment is the sum of the force F times lever arm y about

In Eq. 9.5 above, if the stress is in psi, distance is in inches, and themoment of
inertia is in in.4, then the unit of bending moment in the English system is lb-in. If
we precisely look at Eq. 9.5 we will ﬁnd out that it represents the resisting moment
dealing with the size, material, and shape of the beam cross section. The expression
can be simpliﬁed by substituting S ¼ I/c, called the section modulus. Then the
formula becomes
M ¼ σ S
ð9:6Þ
The section modulus S is an important property of the cross section and can be
considered a measure of the strength of a beam. It is also a characteristic of the
bending capacity and stiffness of a beam cross section. The larger the section
modulus, the smaller the stresses developed in the section for a certain bending
moment. Equation 9.6 shows that the larger the section modulus, the larger the
bending moment developed at the beam cross section for certain compressive or
tensile stresses. Values of section moduli for some cross sectional shapes can be
found in the tables of properties of materials.

sectional dimension is 5 in.  10 in. and the bending moment is 50,000 lb-in.

Chapter Summary
When a beam is subjected to external loads, shear forces and bending moments
develop in the beam. Therefore, a beam must resist these external shear forces and
bending moments. The beam itself must develop internal resistance to resist shear
forces and bending moments.
The stresses caused by the bending moments are called bending stresses. For
beam design purposes, it is very important to calculate the shear stresses and
bending stresses at various locations of a beam. The bending stress varies from
zero at the neutral axis to a maximum at the tensile and compressive side of
the beam.

Overview
Structural members that are subjected to axial compressive loads are called
columns; their lengths are several times greater than their cross-sectional
dimensions. Columns have wide application in the construction industry and are
very important in overall design for buildings and bridges. Columns can bend
under compressive axial loading, and they might be subject to eccentric axial
loading. This phenomenon is called buckling; this means that the column has lost
its stability by buckling. In this chapter the buckling of a column as a result of

Introduction
A column is a structural member subjected to an end load whose action line
parallels that of the member and whose length is generally ten or more times its
least lateral dimension. The most common materials for columns are steel, wood,
aluminum, and concrete. Normally, the stronger the material, the larger the load the
column can carry. Shorter columns have more load-carrying capacity than longer
columns.
Generally, all axially loaded columns are called compressive members. There
are other structural members that carry compressive loads, but they are not neces-
sarily columns, such as pillars and piers. The size of the column is another factor
that has an effect on the load-carrying capacity of the column. End connections of
the column have an effect on the load-carrying capacity of the column. End

connections of a column are classiﬁed as pinned and ﬁxed connections (Fig. 10.1).
Columns with ﬁxed end connections have higher load-carrying capacities.

Slenderness Ratio
The slenderness ratio is a very important quantity in the design process of compres-
sion members. The slenderness ratio is equal to the length of the compression
member divided by the least radius of gyration of the cross section. It is shown by L/
r, where L is length of the member and r is the least radius of gyration of the cross
section.
It is written as
r ¼ √I=A
In order to get the least radius of gyration, we have to choose the smallest
moment of inertia, either Ix or Iy in the formula.
For low-carbon steel, a short compression member is one that has a slenderness
ratio below about 40; for aluminum–magnesium alloys, any compression member
that has a slenderness ratio below 10 is considered a short compression member.
Example 10.1 Calculate the slenderness ratio of a compression member 8 ft long
with the cross section shown (Fig. 10.2).

Failure in Columns
Columns can be classiﬁed as three types: short, long, and intermediate (Fig. 10.4).
Failure in short columns is distinguished by the crushing (yielding) of material, due
to the stresses developed in the material which are greater than the yielding stress.
Long column fails are due to buckling, meaning that the column actually defects
laterally and bends near the middle of its length. Buckling in long columns occurs at
stresses below the yielding stress of the material. Failure in intermediate columns is
a combination of material yielding and buckling. Buckling in intermediate columns
takes place at higher stresses.

Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), Swiss mathematician, derived a formula for a
slender column that shows how the critical load would cause buckling in this type of
column. The formula is the Euler equation and was named after him for his great
contribution to column theory. Today it is still used as the basis for the analysis and
design of slender columns. The Euler equation is expressed as
Pe ¼ π2EI=L2
ð10:1Þ
where
Pe ¼ the critical load or the Euler buckling load, lb or N.
E ¼ the modulus of elasticity of the material, psi or MPa
I ¼ the smallest moment of inertia of the cross section, in.4 or mm4
L ¼ the length of the column between the hinges, in. or mm
The Euler formula is used to precisely predict the buckling load if the buckling
stress is less than the proportional limit of the material. For the purpose of
comparison, the Euler formula can be expressed in terms of buckling stress using
Eq. 10.1 and substituting Ar2 for the moment of inertia, I.

ð10:2Þ
The Euler equation has some limitations in the fact that it is only used if buckling
occurs, as stresses on a column are low and in the material’s elastic region.
Example 10.4 Calculate the critical load using the Euler formula for a 250-mm
long rectangular steel bar 15 mm by 4 mm, to be used as a pin-connected compres-
sion member. Assume the modulus of elasticity for steel is 200  103 MPa.
Solution First, we must ﬁnd out if the Euler formula can be used for this problem.
In other words, the compression member must be a slender column.
Calculate the moment of inertia Ix and Iy to ﬁnd out which one is smaller.
Ix ¼ 1=12 15
ð
Þ 4
ð Þ3 ¼ 80mm4
and
Iy ¼ 1=12 4
ð Þ 15
ð
Þ3 ¼ 1, 124mm4
Ix is smaller than Iy.
The area is A ¼ 15  4 ¼ 60 mm2
The radius of gyration is
r
¼ √I=A
¼ √80=60 ¼ 1:15mm
The slenderness ratio is
L=r ¼ 250mm=1:15mm ¼ 217
Since 217 > 150 (steel), the compression member is a slender column, and the
Euler formula can be applied.

Timber Columns
Simple, solid, square or rectangular wood columns are the most frequently used
types of timber in the construction industry today. Round cross-sectional columns
are also classiﬁed as simple solid columns, but are used less frequently. The other
types of timber columns are spaced columns and built-up columns.
In this section, we only discuss the simple, solid square or rectangular cross
section. The most widely used design code for the analysis and design of timber
columns is recommended by the National Forest Products Association (NFPA),
under the National Design Speciﬁcation for Wood Construction.
10.5
Allowable Stress in Timber Columns
The long column (slender column) is deﬁned by the L/d ratio, where L is the actual
length of the column, and d is the smallest dimension of the column cross section.
The slenderness ratio for a simple solid timber column is limited to L/d ¼ 50.
For timber columns, the allowable axial compressive stress is given by the
formula
10.5
Allowable Stress in Timber Columns
233

σall ¼ 0:3E= L=d
ð
Þ2
where
E ¼ the modulus of elasticity of timber, psi
L ¼ actual length of the column, in.
d ¼ the least dimension of the column, in.
The above equation is basically the same as the Euler equation, except for the
new deﬁnition of L/d for a timber column. This ratio is limited to 50 or less.
Example

for
a
pin-connected 4  8 timber column of Douglas ﬁr that is 10 ft long. The table
value of allowable stress is (sc ¼ 1,050 psi).
Solution
L=d ¼ 10 12
ð
Þ=3:5 ¼ 34:3 < 50
OK
[Note that the dressed value of 4  8 Douglas structural timber is 3½  7¼.]
Now we must calculate a factor called K to ﬁnd out if the column can perform as
a slender one.
K ¼ 0:671√E=sc ¼ 0:671√1, 700, 000=1, 050 ¼ 27
For longer columns (K  L/d  50)
Since 27 < 34.3 < 50, it is a slender column and we use

Solution
L=d ¼ 20  12=5:5 ¼ 43:6 < 50
OK
Now we must calculate a factor called K to ﬁnd out if the column can perform as
a slender one.
K ¼ 0:671√E=sc ¼ 0:671√1, 400, 000=875 ¼ 26:8

Chapter Summary
Here is a brief summary of what you have learned in this chapter.
Columns are generally considered as compression members and classiﬁed as
short, intermediate, and long (slender). Columns fail due to a type of bending called
buckling. In short and intermediate columns, the buckling occurs due to inelastic
bending. In long columns, the buckling occurs due to an elastic bending.
The Euler equation is used for calculating the buckling critical load and is
expressed as
Pe ¼ π2EI=L2
The Euler formula is limited to the proportional limit of the material.
The critical stress is
σe ¼ π2E


= L=r
ð
Þ2
L/r is called the slenderness ratio. For a steel slender column, the slenderness
ratio is above 150.
For timber columns, the allowable stress based on the Euler formula is given as
σall ¼ 0:3E= L=d
ð
Þ2
The codes limit L/d to 50 or less.
