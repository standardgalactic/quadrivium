Preface
In recent years, the convergence of blockchain technology and Digital Twin 
(DT) applications within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has sparked a 
transformative wave in how we perceive, manage, and secure interconnected 
systems. This preface sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the 
privacy and security perspectives inherent in the amalgamation of blockchain 
and Digital Twin technologies within IoT networks. The Internet of Things, 
characterized by the seamless interconnectivity of devices, sensors, and 
actuators, has ushered in an era of unprecedented data generation and 
exchange. However, this proliferation of data has brought about significant 
concerns regarding privacy and security. As IoT devices continue to permeate 
various facets of our daily lives, from smart homes to industrial processes, 
safeguarding sensitive information becomes paramount. Digital Twins, 
virtual replicas of physical entities or systems, have emerged as a pivotal 
component in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of IoT networks. 
By providing real-time insights, predictive analytics, and the ability to 
simulate and optimize operations, Digital Twins contribute to informed 
decision-making and proactive management of IoT ecosystems. The integration 
of blockchain technology into IoT networks introduces a decentralized and 
tamper-resistant ledger that ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in 
data transactions. Blockchain’s distributed nature mitigates single points of 
failure and unauthorized access, addressing some of the security concerns 
associated with centralized systems. Moreover, smart contracts within 
blockchain networks automate and enforce predefined rules, adding an extra 
layer of trust and accountability to transactions. However, this amalgamation 
of technologies also raises intricate challenges, particularly in the realms of 
privacy and security. Balancing the need for transparency with the imperative 
to protect sensitive information becomes a delicate task. As Digital Twins 
generate intricate replicas of physical entities, ensuring the privacy of the 
data they handle becomes crucial. Simultaneously, securing the decentralized 
infrastructure of blockchain networks from potential vulnerabilities and 
attacks is imperative for maintaining the integrity of the entire system. This 
preface sets the tone for a deeper exploration of the multifaceted dimensions

1.  Introduction
Since the development of the internet, education has been much more 
accessible to everyone. People from many walks of life, including students, 
academics, and working professionals, use online communities to publish and 
sell their work. To participate in any of these services, however, membership 
is essential. The files are uploaded directly into the application; thus, there 
is no protection. Data Integrity verification is necessary to achieve security 
in cloud-based information systems [1]. Kumar et al. [2] developed a 
privacy-preserving and secure framework with the help of block-chain. In 
their approach, PPSF is working mainly on two key strategies: one is two-level 
privacy, and another one is an intrusion detection scheme. In 2017, Omar et al. 
[3] designed a privacy-preserving platform for healthcare data for supporting 
security features and assuring pseudonymity by using cryptography functions 
to protect the patient’s data. There have been attempts. Users must subscribe 
to their application to see their work, and only those who have done so are

granted access to the associated files. Since third-party applications are used 
in this method, the content creator receives less payment. 
To do away with intermediaries and ensure safe file sharing, we developed 
a revolutionary approach: a cloud-based system based on Block Chain. This 
method allows users to share files safely and swiftly [4].
The blockchain-powered cloud-based file-sharing system uses the cloud 
computing infrastructure to provide reliable and secure services. Cloud 
computing has completely changed the game’s rules in the modern world. 
As a result of cloud computing, users and businesses may have access to 
software without investing in new computers [5]. Everything from making 
a computer-generated image to providing AI services might be done on the 
cloud. As a relatively new technological development, cloud computing 
has steadily gained market penetration over the last three years. With the 
cloud-based file-sharing method, users may easily share and receive data 
from one another [6]. This approach allows users to store and share data using 
cloud networks simply and efficiently. When we store information in the 
cloud, we give up control, which raises severe worries about the safety of our 
data’s privacy and reliability [7]. This paper aims to go through an encrypted 
method of cloud-based file sharing. During this research, we developed a 
brand-new strategy for exchanging digital media. This file-viewing transaction 
is executed through a blockchain, which moves it from user to user. It allows 
many individuals to share and receive files without worrying about security. It 
is recommended that data be encrypted before cloud storage. This is possible 
due to the usage of an encryption technique. Most file-sharing services and 
applications implement secure file-sharing by ensuring only authorized users 
can see and download data.
Video lessons, research papers, and anything in between may all be 
uploaded in this manner by users. This encryption method works with every 
file type imaginable. Our primary focus is removing barriers between you and 
the original originator of a file. To do this, blockchain technology is utilized. 
The term “blockchain” refers to a distributed digital ledger maintained by a 
computer network that records and verifies financial transactions. In addition, 
the network is secure against attacks, and the information entered cannot be 
modified. A user who needs access to these resources can pay for them by 
submitting a transaction on the blockchain. The technique involves the creator 
of the file setting the price. Young individuals who do not know each other 
engage in this conversation.
On the other hand, features such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, 
and authentication must be ensured to safeguard shared information’s privacy, 
authenticity, and truthfulness [8]. Bojjagani et al. [9, 10, 11, 12] addressed 
the various security attacks on three application levels, communication, 
and device. They demonstrated how to keep the information secure from 

BCECBN: Secure File Sharing System  3
intruders in their approach, especially with the well-known active attacks of 
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), replay, Denial of service (DoS), and phishing 
attacks. And provide vulnerabilities with risk behaviours in their scheme.
Our key contributions to this chapter are the following:
	1.	 We have developed a unique blockchain-based preserving and securing 
data services for IoT to assure user security. In this system, tamper-proof 
records generated using pairing-based encryption can be integrated into 
blockchain transactions. It allows tamper-proof data to remain secure 
even if the underlying blockchain is compromised.
	2.	 Using blockchain-based smart contracts, we develop safe payment 
mechanisms that allow users and uploaders to pay for associated services 
reliably and automatically.
	3.	 We present a security analysis to prove that our system is safe from 
collusion, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The findings 
demonstrate that our technique is efficient and practical, with a modest 
calculation overhead.
Organization of the chapter: The rest of the chapter is organized as 
follows: An overview of the related work on cloud-based privacy-preserving 
techniques using blockchain in Section 2. Section 3 describes the proposed 
model. Section 4 provides results and discussions, and Section 5 presents 
concluding remarks and future work.
2.  Related Work
Multiple file-sharing software options exist. This generation of apps prioritizes 
openness over privacy and productivity. We need a centralized app where 
all files are accessible by every user who registers or uses the app because 
these apps share data. Therefore, we have highlighted a few related software 
programs:
We used the AES encryption technique in our app. It was formerly 
possible to encrypt information using AES. Rayarapu et al. [13] paid particular 
attention to the processes involved in secretly encrypting and storing data on a 
disc and then decrypting that data with the same key. This system employs a 
cryptographic algorithm based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). 
AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 refer to the relative key sizes (128 bits, 
192 bits, and 256 bits) and rounds (10, 12, and 14) required to unlock the vault 
that closes around the data. The key and the encrypted data are transmitted 
via a series of characters that are exchanged in this technique. To prevent 
unauthorized changes to the encrypted files, they are made read-only. The 
system’s main selling point is preventing users from deleting encrypted data

using the right-click menu. As a result, there will be a higher level of protection 
for the data stored on the disc.
Amin et al. [14] developed a framework for helping both user cooperation 
and resource sharing was given extensive treatment in this essay. They 
advocated for a P2P network with centralized connection management 
performed by a directory server. The directory server was used to help create 
the overlay network and guarantee a quick and effective search. They devised 
a plan to build and manage the overlay network that makes the most available 
resources while keeping latency minimal. For the last step, we use simulation 
to test how well the proposed framework runs. Oliveira et al. [15] developed a 
framework for the security options provided by a few cloud storage services, 
allowing users to share files without intermediaries and pay only for the space 
they use. They used Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Google Cloud 
Storage, HP Public Cloud, RackSpace Cloud Files, Windows Azure Storage, 
and Luna Cloud. The permissions of the services, their semantics, and the 
various access-granting mechanisms used to provide these permissions to 
users were all discussed.
Furthermore, a collection of techniques for safely moving information 
among various public cloud storage services was outlined. Several protocols 
were developed to facilitate communication between users of different 
cloud services by augmenting a predefined set of characteristics. We took 
this as a guide and saved our files with Azure Storage Services. By utilizing 
Azure’s services, we can rest easy knowing that our data is safe. We used 
the Paturi et al. [16] paradigm to combine a blockchain with a user’s deposit 
of a negligible quantity of crypto to the file’s author in a single transaction. 
Smart contracts are used for this purpose. Researchers used blockchain 
technology to devise a mechanism for financially rewarding participants in 
a waste management system. They proposed a new AI-powered management 
system built on blockchain and the IoT. It uses smart contracts and blockchain 
technologies to reward people for putting trash in smart bins. Yeh et al. 
[17] designed a framework on a revocable and monitorable peer-to-peer 
file-sharing mechanism over a consortium blockchain. For their approach, they 
ensured file revocation in the decentralized environment. The data integrity of 
the executable peer-to-peer file-sharing tool is verified and generate a unique 
file authentication code for each “InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)’’ node is 
used to determine whether the file-sharing system is synchronized correctly. 
Also, Yeh et al. scheme integrates the autonomous smart contracts and Intel 
SGX hardware to obtain the monitorable merit.

3.  Proposed Model
We introduced a secure file-sharing solution to protect cloud-stored files and 
data. Users of the proposed system can simultaneously exchange files with 
several other users. This software provides the highest possible level of safety 
for its users. Before uploading a file to the server, the user can encrypt it, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
When a file is posted to this application, all registered users have access 
to it and its metadata, including the uploader’s name, the file’s size, and the 
date it was uploaded. A user can only view an uploaded file by requesting it 
directly from whoever originally posted it. When users attempt to download 
content, they are sent to a crypto payment gateway. An email with the secret 
key is sent to the user to confirm a successful transfer of funds. After entering 
the secret key, the user will have access to the files and be able to view or 
download them. We developed the AES algorithm to encrypt data in our 
proposed system. A private key is generated while the data is being encrypted. 
Any file type (.docx,.pdf,.mp4) can be encrypted with this framework, 
provided the secret key satisfies essential creation conditions such as required 
length and complexity. A file encrypted with a specific algorithm will have 
its name changed to filename.txt, suggesting that it may be read as plaintext 
or deciphered using a text editor. Data in an encrypted file is safe against 
tampering. The proposed method’s steps are shown in the flowchart of the 
encryption and decryption process in Fig. 2.
We built a safe online platform to exchange information. Users must sign 
up for the service before they can use it. Upon completing the registration 
process, the user is automatically sent to the login page and granted access. 
The whole functionality of the framework is now available to the user. It 
includes viewing, uploading, encrypting, and decrypting data. For security 
reasons, before a user may send another user an encrypted file, the file must 
be encrypted with the encrypt function. User-generated private keys are used 
to protect information throughout the encryption process. Once the encryption 
is complete, the user can submit the encrypted file, and its corresponding 
metadata is shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 1.  System architecture encrypting & uploading files to a cloud.

6  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Any user who wants to view a file after it has been posted will need the 
secret key produced by the person who submitted the file shown in Fig. 4. The 
user must use the same private key provided by the uploader to decrypt the 
file. If the key does not match, the user will be informed that the file cannot 
be decrypted and cannot access it. The user can view and download the file

successfully if the secret key is entered correctly. By utilizing this method, we 
can ensure the safety of the files stored on our server.
Any user who wants to view a file after it has been posted will need the 
secret key produced by the person who submitted the file. The user should 
provide the same secret key provided by the uploader to decrypt the file. If the 
key does not match, the user will be informed that the file cannot be decrypted 
and cannot access it. The user can view and download the file if the secret key 
is entered correctly. By utilizing this method, we can ensure the safety of the 
files stored on our server.
On view files, you may see all the uploaded documents. When you upload 
a file, it will be saved in the cloud. Once a user signs up for the service, they 
can access the application and decrypt any file shown in Fig. 5. User action 
Figure 3.  Encryption function.
Figure 4.  System architecture for retrieving the files.

is required before accessing downloaded encrypted files. If the payment is 
successful, the user is sent to the download page after clicking the option 
to send money. A password-protected PDF with the key and download 
confirmation is emailed to the user when the download is complete. 
The encrypted file is then manually picked for decryption. The data is 
sent to the decryption service for processing. We must enter the author’s key 
to access the file during decryption. If the decryption is successful, the user 
can access the data. The decryption procedure is shown in the Flowchart in 
Fig. 6.
The financial transactions are conducted using blockchain technology. 
We use blockchain technology to keep track of all the file downloads and 
uploads that users request. The Pay to View feature is also realized using 
the blockchain bitcoin concept. The smart contract will execute these tasks. 
Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that may record transactions and 
keep tabs on assets in a corporate or business setting. Rather than maintaining 
records in a central location, blockchain stores data in connected blocks shared 
across participants. Each block in the blockchain contains the cryptographic 
hash, timestamp, and transaction details from the previous block. Bitcoin’s 
distributed ledger, or blockchain, was developed as an alternative to the 
traditional financial system, in which institutions play the role of trusted 
intermediaries in facilitating authorized transactions and preventing fraud. To

maintain their customer database, banks impose astronomical transaction costs 
and maintain a personal database. Ether, Ripple, and Lite-coin are some of the 
numerous cryptocurrencies that may be used on the open-source blockchain 
network that facilitates transactions today. Payments sent to individuals may 
be guaranteed to arrive promptly and securely through Smart Contracts. 
Blockchain technology underpins the whole operation, ensuring openness in 
all dealings. Using a blockchain to transmit money helps make the software 
more transparent, letting the creator see who sent the money and received the 
data. All financial dealings are recorded on the blockchain for posterity.
Transactions involving money or other assets may now be conducted 
digitally and openly, thanks to smart contracts and agreements between 
two parties on a blockchain. Ethereum’s smart contract functionality and 
decentralized blockchain architecture make it a frontrunner in the emerging 
smart contract market. The term “smart contract” refers to a small piece of 
code stored on a blockchain that runs automatically when specific conditions 
are met. This operation runs on its own. They streamline enforcing agreements, 
ensuring all parties know the conclusion without delays or extra effort. All 
financial dealings may be finalized using smart contracts, eliminating the need 
for any third parties. In the same way that a traditional contract sets down each 
party’s obligations to an agreement, smart contracts do the same. Still, they 
also enact those obligations without needing a mediator or arbitrator. 
A blockchain-powered cloud storage service keeps a log to track all 
the requests for downloading and uploading files. The Pay to View feature 
is also realized using the blockchain bitcoin concept, shown in Fig. 7. The 
smart contract will execute these tasks. If the uploader signs a Blockchain 
transaction, the application will allow him to upload his file. He will not be 
charged anything extra, but the user’s confidential data of wallet address, 
Figure 7.  Flowchart of processing pay to view.

10  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
for example. Where he expects to get his crypto tokens from downloaders, 
royalty amount, data, and time will be recorded. The secret document is then 
uploaded to Azure DB, where anybody may download it. 
Users can go through a directory of accessible files and download 
anything. They’ll have to fork out the specified amount in bitcoins that the 
file’s uploader stipulated. After a transaction is completed and money is 
received, the blockchain is updated with the downloader’s information and 
the time and date the file was obtained. This creates a public blockchain log 
of file transfers. Payments are processed swiftly, and the identities of those 
who upload and download information can be reliably tracked, all thanks to 
blockchain technology.
As was mentioned before, we hosted our app on the Microsoft Azure 
cloud shown in Fig. 8. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service 
developed and managed by Microsoft. When it comes to cloud services, 
Azure has you covered. Like other Microsoft offerings, Azure is a free and 
open-source cloud computing platform; however, the Azure client software 
development kit (SDK) is not. Software as a service (SAAS), platform 
as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), are all cloud 
computing paradigms that are provided by Azure. Numerous businesses take 
advantage of Azure’s cloud services. While most of Azure’s offerings are 
Microsoft-centric, some Linux-specific options exist. There is no need to 
install any software on the client machine to make use of Azure’s hosting 
services for email servers, web servers, applications, Active Directory, virtual 
machines, remote desktop management, content delivery networks (CDNs), 
messaging services, data management, and big data tools, among others.1

We developed the framework on local machines, tested it thoroughly, and 
only then sent it to the cloud, where it is currently being hosted and used 
in production. However, deploying an app is difficult; it requires several 
behind-the-scenes processes to be finished. The Azure App Service, which 
we used to push our code to the cloud, requires Python 3.7 or later and a 
Linux server environment, which we couldn’t utilize because we relied on the 
Django framework.
With Azure App Service, you may use any language or framework to 
build and host REST APIs, backend processes, and web apps. The Azure 
app service allows us to set scalability and availability parameters without 
worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. In this chapter, we 
allowed an Azure App Service as a hosting provider since I am responsible for 
many tasks while operating my application locally, including:
	1.	 We must specify and acquire actual servers, storage, networking 
equipment, and any other essential gear.
	2.	 Ensure that the primary, backup, cooling systems, and so on are all 
operational.
	3.	 Set up and configure the network.
	4.	 Install and configure any virtualization software, operating system, 
middleware, or runtime components your application requires.
	5.	 Install and configure a web server such as IIS, Apache, or Nginx.
As Azure is a PaaS, we can eliminate all these positions by moving app 
development to the cloud. Our team can solely focus on maintaining our 
app and its associated data. Azure takes care of the rest. You won’t need to 
worry about managing the network or the underlying infrastructure. Examples 
include updating the OS, implementing critical repairs, updating runtime 
components, or putting middleware in place. Everything runs well because 
of Azure. Now you can devote even more time to the parts of the application 
that matter.
Before you can host our software in Azure, you’ll need to create a web 
app for Azure App Service. If we have access to the Azure portal, we can use 
it to build an Azure app. All the required settings must be adjusted, including 
the resource group, web app name, application environment, app service plan, 
etc. If everything checks out, we can start building the web app. The next step 
is to create our web application. To move the database from on-premises to 
Azure, we must first make a PostgreSQL database in Azure after launching 
the web app. We added a firewall rule to our app’s server after we created the 
Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Using Azure’s web app and PostgreSQL, 
we establish a connection between the two. The web app code requires the 

12  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
value of four environment variables (DBHOST, DBNAME, DBUSER, and 
DBPASS) to connect to the PostgreSQL server. 
After connecting to the PostgreSQL database, we push our application 
code to Azure. When an application is successfully deployed to Azure, a DNS 
name is automatically generated for remote access via the internet, allowing 
us to log in from any device.2
4.  Results and Discussion
We utilized Microsoft’s Azure App Service to deploy proposed framework to 
the cloud. After an app has been deployed to Azure, a public URL is created 
to be accessed from anywhere. We used the Remix platform and its associated 
web3.js API to interact with the Blockchain network during the deployment. 
We conducted our business dealings with the help of the meta mask plugin 
wallet and its associated test accounts. To set up our system, we resorted to 
Matic networks.
Figure 9 reveals that we must encrypt the file before uploading it to the 
cloud. That’s why we experimented with a range of file sizes to gauge the time 
required for the encryption process.
The next step is to upload the encrypted data to the cloud. The size of 
the file will grow after encryption. After determining how long it would take 
to upload the encrypted files. The time in seconds vs. file upload is shown in 
Fig. 10.

As seen in Fig. 4, after the information has been uploaded to the cloud, 
it is accessible to anybody who has registered for an account. As a result, the 
user must first send the crypto before the file can be downloaded. When the 
payment is complete, the user may access the download link. This has resulted 
in a wide range of modifications to file sizes. So, we timed the downloads 
to see how long it took. The file download vs. time in seconds is shown in 
Fig. 11. Since this is the case, decoding the information will follow data 
collection. We see the decryption method in action in Fig. 6.
Consequently, we tried out the function with various sizes to understand 
how much time is needed for decryption. Encryption results in a larger file 
Figure 10.  File upload.
Figure 11.  File download.

14  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
size, while decryption is much quicker than encryption. This data was gleaned 
from the chart. The file size vs. decryption time is shown in Fig. 12.
5.  Conclusions and Future Work
File sharing using cloud-based systems in peer-to-peer is challenging because 
many untrusted parties may access legitimate information. For this, many 
security and privacy-preserving schemes have evolved. But still, it is a task 
to save secure data from the adversary. In this chapter, we have proposed 
a novel solution so that no untrusted parties and attackers challenge to 
exploit the attacks during data share, especially in the cloud, with the help 
of a blockchain-enabled mechanism for file-sharing systems. Our main 
contribution is developing a secure framework to showcase novel architecture, 
secure mechanisms, and privacy-preserving using blockchain technology.
Before launching any application in the public storage areas, the client 
must establish a secure connection with a Content Delivery Network (CDN). 
It is essential to connect the millions of people who rely on file sharing; thus, 
we need a reliable solution to accommodate them all. For future work, the 
proposed framework is to integrate the developed application with a CDN.

1.  Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking infrastructure that connects 
everyday physical devices, appliances, vehicles, and other things linked to 
the Internet and interconnects to each other for exchanging data [1]. The 
IoT devices can sense and collect physical environmental changes like 
temperature, humidity, light, smoke, etc. The collected data are then organized 
and analyzed to make decisions, to share the collected data with authorized 
services or applications, and to interact with humans and/or other devices. 
The IoT makes human life much easier by automatically interacting, remotely 
controlling, and monitoring devices to improve the quality of life and reduce 
human efforts as much as possible [2]. Smart homes, Smart agriculture, 
Transport systems, and Education are widely used IoT industries.
In the past decade, IoT has been a profound innovation that intensifies 
comforts and enhances the quality of human life. However, several challenges 
need to be addressed. One of the challenges of IoT is Standardization, as the 
different IoT devices and applications use a wide variety of communication 
technologies such as WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc. [3]. A standardized 
architecture is crucial for hassle-free communications. The Second challenge

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  17
is the Reliability and hardware problem. For any IoT-related applications, a 
physical device is a must. However, people prefer low-cost and highly reliable 
devices. Making such highly reliable devices at a low cost is very challenging. 
Another critical challenge is the security issues [4]. Competent health care and 
video surveillance system usage are increasing very fast. It is imperative to 
keep all personal details secure. Many data breaching situations are happening 
around the world. Many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms take part in IoT 
security purposes.
These are some of the crucial problems related to IoT. There are many 
other challenges, such as interconnectivity, integration, resource allocation, 
etc. [5]. Traditional networking components and infrastructure cannot deal 
with the application-specific requirements of IoT. The different applications 
require different Quality of Services (QoS). For example, the smart healthcare 
system needs reliable and low-delay connectivity, whereas the video 
streaming application tolerates delay. So, it is crucial to design the network 
infrastructure in such a way that each application gets its own QoS. However, 
it is a challenging task to allocate different kinds of resources and QoS for 
each application and connected device. Because every application and device 
are connected through available resources and protocols, it is challenging 
to provide designated QoS for each application with the same network 
infrastructure [6].
To address these problems and QoS-related challenges, the Software 
Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising solution. SDN is a technology that 
can centrally control the network using software applications to improve the 
network performance. SDN centralizes the network control by decoupling the 
forwarding process (Data plane) from the control process (Control plane) [7]. 
The control plane consists of one or more controllers, where all the intelligence 
is located. The control plane can monitor, analyze, and make decisions about 
the network. The SDN infrastructure is more software-dependent and less 
hardware-dependent. That is, it is easier to program different applications 
and related QoS remotely without the help of new hardware equipment. 
With the help of SDN, the IoT network infrastructure will be more scalable, 
standardized, and secured [8, 9].
2.  IoT
IoT is the new paradigm that connects physical objects, collects, and analyzes 
data, makes decisions, and controls devices remotely. IoT enhances the quality 
of human life by automatically controlling physical devices and using novel 
applications. Physical objects, devices, or sensors are the essential elements 
of IoT. These devices are capable of sensing surrounding environmental 
changes and collecting those data. The data could be pressure information of 

18  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
a person or a video from a surveillance system. Recently a device consisting 
of multiple sensors can collect heterogeneous data in real-time. The collected 
data is transmitted to neighboring devices, a central unit, or a cloud using 
various communication technologies such as mobile networks, Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, RFID, etc. [10]. The collected data is then processed in the storage 
location. The edge devices are also capable of processing small quantities of 
data. The cloud is the finest solution for storing and processing large amounts 
of data. Different Machine Learning (ML) and statistical methods are used 
for analyzing these data. The processed information then is sent to the user or 
appropriate devices for further action.
Most industries, such as semiconductors, telecommunications, and 
software, invest in IoT technology. The Finances [11] estimate that the number 
of connected devices will likely be 25.44 billion. Almost every industry is 
using IoT applications in their business and products. The major IoT-dependent 
industries are Health care, Smart home, Transportation, Manufacturing, and 
Education. Figure 1 shows the heterogeneous IoT applications and different 
communication technologies.
The healthcare system is one of the leading industries that depend on IoT 
technology. Wearable IoT devices can monitor the patient’s data 24/7 and warn 
health care professionals in case of unusual data. It can analyzes the patient’s 
data and diagnose the illness. IoT technology is used for other complex tasks 
like robotic surgery. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is another IoT application for 
intelligent transportation systems. In IoV, vehicles are connected and with the 
environment through the internet. The connected vehicles can collect data 
from other vehicles and the environment to compute the best traffic route, 
Figure 1.  IoT applications.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  19
avoid accidents and congestion, etc. Many other IoT-related applications that 
enhance the quality of human life [12].
2.1  IoT Architecture
Five-layer architecture is the best-proposed architecture for connecting 
heterogeneous IoT devices, communication technologies, and business aspects 
[1]. Five-layer architecture is the extension of the basic IoT architecture and 
is shown in Fig. 2. Next, we provide a brief explanation of the Five layers.
2.1.1  Data Layer
The data layer, or the perception layer, is the bottom layer in the layered 
architecture. The data layer consists of sensors and actuators that sense 
environmental changes and collect information like temperature, pressure, 
gas leakage, intrusion detection, etc. These physical devices are connected 
either through wired or wireless connectivity. The collected data is transferred 
to another layer for further action.
2.1.2  Network Layer
The network layer ensures connectivity between devices and the core network. 
It is the layer between the data layer and the data processing layer. The 
collected data can be transferred through various communication protocols 
such as RFID, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, etc.
2.1.3  Data Processing Layer
The data processing layer, also called the middleware layer, can store, analyze, 
and make decisions based on the data. It stores the data with the device address, 
name, date, and sensed data. It manipulates and computes the data using 
ML/statistical technologies to find hidden information and make the 
appropriate decisions. Some of the responsibilities of the preprocessing layer 
are: (1) Data accumulation: Correctly assigning different data types to their 
appropriate storage space (2) Data abstraction: Aggregating the data from 
various sources (3) Data analysis: Finding the hidden pattern of data for 
decision making.
2.1.4  Application Layer
The application layer manages the different applications or services requested 
by the customers. For example, the application layer can check the whole 
house and inform the owner about the home’s condition for security purposes. 
The Application layer provides high-quality services to the end user. It offers 

20  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
various services, such as smart agriculture, intelligent healthcare systems, 
Transportation systems, and Education.
2.1.5  Business Layer
The business layer controls the application and services of the overall IoT 
system. The business layer does the business model of the services requested 
by a customer. Flowcharts and graphs can be used to show the performance of 
a business model. It also designs and implements the whole model, analyzes 
it, monitors, evaluates, checks the errors, and modifies the system.
3.  Software Defined Networks (SDN)
Software Defined Networks (SDN), often referred to as a new paradigm, 
simplify network management and control by decoupling the control plane 
and data plane [13]. SDN enables the programmability of the network for 
automation. Computer networks include many physical devices (switches, 
routers, sensors, etc.) and protocols for the functionality of these devices. 
Device management and scalability are the main problems for traditional 
Figure 2.  IoT five layer architecture.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  21
networks. The SDN-enabled network can easily manage the network by using 
logically centralized SDN controllers. The control logic from the networking 
devices is shifted to the SDN controllers, which enhances the flexibility and 
programmability of the network [14].
3.1  SDN Architecture
The SDN architecture [15] consists of three layers: the data layer, the controller 
layer, and the application layer, shown in Fig. 3. The SDN architecture also 
provides a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), namely the 
Northbound and Southbound interfaces, for simplifying the network services.
Figure 3.  SDN architecture.
3.1.1  Data Plane
The Data Plane consists of network devices such as switches, routers, nodes, 
etc. The network devices are responsible for forwarding the data based on the 
rules implemented by the controller plane. The OpenFlow protocol is used for 
communication between the data plane and the controller plane. At the arrival 
of new packets, OpenFlow switches to check the ‘matching fields’ of the flow 
table entries and forward the data with the matched flow entry. If there is no 
matched flow entry, the switch sends a ‘packet-in’ message to the controller 
for further action.

22  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
3.1.2  Controller Plane
The SDN controller plane consists of logically distributed controllers, which 
provide intelligence to the entire network. The controller is responsible for 
forwarding policies and network management such as routing, load balancing, 
topology management, security, etc. The control plane communicates to the 
data and application planes through the southbound and northbound interfaces, 
respectively.
3.1.3  Application Plane
The application plane consists of different user-defined applications 
such as smart cities, innovative healthcare, transportation systems, etc. It 
communicates with the controller plane through the northbound interface.
4.  SDIoT
Managing heterogeneous devices, communication protocols, and generated 
data types in IoT systems is challenging. Due to programmability, central 
view, and innovative protocols, SDN can be integrated with IoT systems for 
better performance and is named SDIoT [16]. SDN controller and OpenFlow 
switches are the main components of the SDIoT network [17]. OpenFlow 
switches are used to forward the data packets. SDN controller connects 
the switches and communicates through OpenFlow protocol. The SDIoT 
networks are used in health care, smart city, smart home, etc. applications 
to get full advantages of the central control from SDN [18]. SDN manages 
resource management, routing, and communication in IoT networks.
4.1  SDN-enabled Smartcity
The smart city enhances the life quality of people living in urban areas [19]. 
A large deployment of sensors and other physical devices connected with 
modern technologies gathered information from the environment and built 
intelligent functionality. The smart city relates to many other components, 
such as smart transportation, market, education, health care, etc., for their 
functionality. Security is the primary concern of innovative city applications. 
A secure smart city architecture is essential for protecting personal data, 
avoiding cyber-attacks, automation, and adding functionalities.
To enhance the scalability, security, and storage and reduce the energy 
consumption, latency, and collecting and organization of the data, the authors 
[20] propose a distributed and decentralized blockchain-software defined 
networking-based energy-aware architecture for smart city applications 
shown in Fig. 4. The perception layer consists of all IoT devices that 
provide the data to the users. The edge layer processes the data efficiently, 

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  23
and the cloud layer stores the data and provides the service to the users. 
The centralized SDN controller can manage network activities and detect 
cyber-attacks, blockchain provides end-to-end security against threats, and 
network function virtualization (NFV) reduces the entire energy usage and 
increases the lifetime of devices. Moreover, a cluster head selection (CHS) 
algorithm cooperates with the network reducing energy consumption.
To improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of human life, protect personal 
data, and make intelligent decisions for various functions, the work done in 
[21] presents an SDN-based four basic IoT architectural blocks for secure 
smart cities. The blocks are the Black network, SDN controller, Unified 
registry, and Key management system. The Black networks can secure all 
data associated with the IoT protocols. Black networks avoid both active and 
passive attacks and ensure the security and privacy of the network. The SDN 
controllers ensure a secure communication path for black networks and other 
smart city applications. The Unified registry manages all the heterogeneous 
functions, addressing schemes, and physical devices. The Key management 
systems focus on the secure communication of IoT nodes utilizing shared 
keys. The keys enable security, simplicity, and resource efficiency.
4.2  SDN-enabled Smart Healthcare
The smart healthcare system enables the services to the patients inside 
the hospitals as well as outside of the hospital. The wireless body area 
network (WBAN) [22] is the key enabler for the above-mentioned service. 
WBAN consists of various sensors, such as blood pressure monitors, body 
temperature monitors, glucose monitors, etc., that can sense the health-related 
data of individuals and forward any unusual data to healthcare professionals. 
Delay and security threats in data communication are the primary concerns of 
smart healthcare systems. Any alteration in the patient’s health data may have 
Figure 4.  SDN enabled smart city architecture.

24  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
profound implications. A well-defined architecture is a must to overcome the 
issues in smart healthcare.
The Soft-Health [23], an SDN-based fog architecture, is proposed 
to serve various IoT-based healthcare applications. Soft-Health ensures 
minimum delay, less packet loss, and minimum network overhead. The fog 
layer consists of SDN switches that forward the incoming packets to the 
appropriate fog or cloud layers based on the criticality index (CI). CI is based 
on the physiological parameters of the sensed data. Also, Soft-Health utilizes 
the maximum capacity of the fog node through an optimization function.
To address the various healthcare applications and their QoS, the authors 
[24] propose a multi-tier healthcare architecture composed of end devices and 
edge and cloud servers. In this architecture, the resources are organized in 
a layered manner and controlled by SDN controllers shown in Fig. 5. The 
device tier consists of sensors and wearables that can sense medical data. The 
Edge tier makes the real-time analysis of sensed data, accesses the patient’s 
past medical records, and forwards them to the health care professionals. It 
also stores these data temporarily. The cloud tier stores the data permanently 
for future use. The SDN controller layer controls and manages all these tiers 
through the northbound interface.
An intelligent software-defined fog architecture (i-Health) is presented in 
[25], which limits unnecessary data transmission in the Industrial Internet of 
Things (IIoT). The locally processed sensed data is transferred to fog or cloud 
for effective process and decision making, leading to unwanted delay. The 
i-health reduces this delay by placing fog nodes near the local data processing 
(LDP) unit. The proposed architecture finds the best accessible nodes based 
on their QoS, such as memory, battery capacity, I/O, and processing capability. 
Then, the Fog ranking Service (FRS) unit determines the rank of each fog 
node based on the QoS parameters.
Figure 5.  SDN enabled smart healthcare architecture.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  25
E Barka et al. [26] present a Secured and Trusted Healthcare Monitoring 
Architecture Using SDN and Blockchain (STHM) to ensure a healthcare 
system’s security, privacy, and flexibility. The STHM consists of four layers, 
namely: User layer, SDN layer, Security layer, and Blockchain layer. The 
user layer is the bottom layer, which includes all types of sensors, actuators, 
and mobile applications for sensing and communicating data to the target 
databases. The user layer is integrated with the SDN layer through southbound 
APIs and the Security layer through Northbound APIs. The security layer 
consists of various security modules which provide security and privacy for 
health monitoring systems. The Blockchain layer ensures security for all 
system actors.
4.3  SDN-enabled Smart Grid
The smart grid (SG), also called the smart electrical grid, is a modern power grid 
[27]. The system uses two-way digital communication for power generation. 
It efficiently generates and transmits power using machine learning (ML) 
techniques and other technologies. The smart grid provides various benefits 
to the users, such as self-monitoring, self-healing, and control.
SG and Electrical vehicles (EV) are increasingly popular due to their 
simplicity and energy availability. The EV market is increasing drastically. 
However, this will make an impact on the SGs. To normalize the power 
demand of SG, the work in [28] proposes a decentralized cloud computing 
architecture based on SDN and NFV. The users can communicate with the 
grids in a real-time way. The proposed architecture can optimize the energy, 
load, and price and maintain the grid’s stability.
The SDN-microSENSE [29] shown in Fig. 6, is an SDN-enabled smart 
grid architecture for security concerns. The SDN-microSENSE consists of 
three main modules: (1) SDN-microSENSE Risk Assessment Framework 
(S-RAF) (2) Cross-Layer Energy Prevention and Detection System 
(XL-EPDS) (3) SDN-enabled Self-healing Framework (SDN-SELF) is 
deployed in the application plane of the SDIoT architecture. Apart from 
the application layer, the SDN-microSENSE architecture also includes 
(a) a Data Plane, (b) a Control Plane, and (c) a Management Plane. The Grid 
plane consists of various devices used in smart grid applications for collecting 
data. The data plane contains Openflow switches for forwarding data packets 
collected from the grid plane. The control plane consists of SDN controllers 
that get information from both the application and management planes for 
configuring the data plane accordingly. The application plane consists of 
different business problems related to industries. Finally, the management 
plane provides all the functionalities related to security.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  27
4.4  SDN-enabled Smart Transportation
Smart transportation or Intelligent transportation system uses various 
technologies to monitor, analyze, and manage transportation system to 
increase efficiency and safety. Emerging technologies such as Fifth Generation 
(5G) communication and IoT make intelligent transportation a reality. The 
IoT provides sensors and actuators for collecting data, and 5G technology 
provides high-speed data communication. The main concern of intelligent 
traffic transportation development is avoiding accidents and traffic congestion 
in an energy-efficient and cost-effective manner.
To handle the traffic congestion problem in VANET, an SD-VANET 
[30] framework is proposed. The data plane consists of vehicles, sensors, 
and OpenFlow switches. The SDN controller is responsible for taking all the 
actions, such as routing, load balancing, topology management, congestion 
control, accident prediction, etc., based on the data from the data plane. For 
congestion control, SD-VANET periodically collects data from the data plane 
and builds a global network to make decisions such as route planning, mobility 
management, and congestion mitigation.
The work done in [31] provides a generic architecture of SDVN along 
with its different planes and their interconnection shown in Fig. 7. The Data 
Plane consists of SDN-enabled switches. The data plane is connected to the 
control plane through the southbound interface and forwards the data packets 
according to the controller’s instructions. The control plane consists of an 
SDN controller, which is the brain of the network. The controller generates 
the flow rules based on the data packets. The application plane is the topmost 
layer connected to the control plane through the northbound interface. The 
Figure 7.  SDN enabled smart transportation architecture.
Traffic management

28  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
application layer consists of all the applications, such as routing, QoS, traffic 
management, etc.
4.5  SDN-enabled Smart Agriculture
The largest food source of the world is Agriculture. Based on the United 
Nations (UN) survey, the world population will reach 11 billion by 2050, 
meaning that the global demand for food will continue to increase [32]. Smart 
agriculture depends on technologies such as IoT, robotics, and Artificial 
intelligence (AI) for farming to increase the quality and quantity of the 
corps with less human intervention. The lifecycle of smart farming includes 
(1) observation, (2) diagnosis, (3) decision, and (4) action. In the observation 
phase, the sensors collect data from the crops, soil, or atmosphere. The collected 
data was then analyzed through various technologies. Based on the analysis 
result, the authority can decide, and the end user makes an action according 
to this, and the cycle repeats from the beginning. However, smart agriculture 
is still developing and faces many challenges, such as security, continuous 
monitoring of soil and water, automatic irrigation, etc. Compatibility with the 
technologies used in intelligent farming compatibility, constrained resources, 
and big data are also other challenges.
Various technologies such as cloud computing, SDN, and AI enable varied 
solutions to overcome these challenges. The SDN provides many advantages 
to smart agriculture, including network scalability, resource utilization, and 
application customization.
The authors [33] discussed a generalized SDN-based architecture for 
agriculture applications shown in Fig. 8. The architecture consists of Four 
layers. The bottom layer is the perception layer, which includes various 
IoT-based agricultural networks. The data plane is comprised of SDN switches 
dedicated to data forwarding. In the control plane, the SDN controller with the 
NFV orchestration system forms a centralized control system for the whole 
network. The application layer consists of different user-defined applications 
for agricultural services.
The work done in [34] focuses on the privacy and safety issues of Internet 
of Things (IoT)-based Precision Agriculture (PA). The proposed SDN 
gateway regulatory system ensures control of a foreign device without having 
access to sensitive farm information. The proposed framework is divided 
into two different devices and network layers. The devices are separated 
as home and foreign agents. Home devices are registered devices in the 
network. Foreign agents are devices that are not registered in the network. 
Foreign agents are controlled and managed by SDN controllers. SDN 
ensures complete security to the underlined network by blocking the threatful 
foreign agents.

4.6  SDN-enabled Smarthome
A smart home refers to an automatic and secured home environment where 
all appliances and devices are connected to the owner and controlled remotely 
from anywhere with the help of the internet. Smart home devices are connected 
to each other and controlled by a central point such as a smartphone, laptop, 
Figure 8.  SDN enabled smart agriculture architecture.

30  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
or tablet. Innovative home security systems can detect any unusual movement 
in the home when the owners are away, and they can call the authorities or 
the owner. The lighting control systems control the lights, reducing electricity 
usage and cost savings.
While the smart home ensures security, energy savings, cost savings, and 
Quality of life, there are still challenges. Smart homes always need strong 
and continuous internet access, which may require hardware access points 
for the entire house. Security risk is the other concern. Hackers can control 
the cameras and routers, steal personal videos, and ruin home appliances’ 
functionality.
The work done in [35] proposes an architecture, namely SHSec, for 
addressing the challenges of flexible device utilization, heterogeneous device 
interoperability, and security enhancement in smart homes using SDN. 
SHSec, shown in Fig. 9, consists of three layers, infrastructure layer, control 
layer, and application layer. The infrastructure layer comprises all smart home 
devices and appliances, such as fridges, lights, washing machines, and gas 
sensors. The infrastructure layer is connected to the control layer. The control 
layer enables all the functionality and security of the smart home. The control 
layer consists of the orchestrator and KNOT. Orchestrator mainly deals with 
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and provides access control and data 
security for application layer services. KNOT consists of three modules: 
packet parser, flow graph builder, and attack mitigation. It deals with security 
Figure 9.  SDN enabled smart home architecture.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  31
attacks and mitigates them when a saturation attack occurs. With the help of 
an orchestrator and KNOT, the SHSec provides flexibility and security to the 
home environment.
SDN with ML and Deep learning (DL) based architecture for smart homes 
is proposed in [36]. The architecture consists of three layers—the first is the 
data layer, which includes all the sensors and home appliances. The Raspberry 
Pi is used as a gateway for connecting all the devices. The middle layer is 
the OpenFlow layer, consisting of OpenFlow switches for data transmission. 
The control layer consists of a Ryu controller with Raspberry Pi installation. 
The ML or DL algorithm in the control layer classifies whether the incoming 
data packet is normal or abnormal. If the data packet is normal, the controller 
adds a flow rule for the forwarding process. Otherwise, for abnormal traffic, 
the controller adds a flag to the data packet and asks the switch to discard the 
packet. The controller can ensure the security of the entire home network by 
using ML or DL implementation.
5.  Other Integrated Technologies in SDIoT
A high computation and communication capacity and extensive resources 
are required to meet the demands of future massive IoT applications. The 
SDN with emerging cloud-related technologies (fog and edge computing) can 
play an essential role in supporting and implementing IoT applications [37]. 
Moreover, SDN can integrate with the recent advent technologies such as 
blockchain and NFV to play a vital part in IoT application management and 
security. Fog and edge computing extends the cloud services to the edge of the 
network to reduce the latency of IoT applications. The NFV technology provides 
more resources to the IoT application through virtualization. The blockchain 
ensures the security and confidentiality of each data communication in the 
IoT network. Cloud computing provides ample storage space for massive IoT 
data. Moreover, the SDN technology integrated with IoT can manage all the 
technologies centrally.
5.1  NFV Integrated with SDIoT Networks
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) replaces the hardware equipment with 
Virtual Machines (VM). Due to the NFV, the network operators can provide 
new services and applications without installing new hardware components. 
So, they can enable the services with less time and cost. The virtual machines 
run all the software dedicated to routing, load balancing, etc., instead of the 
specific network device. The operators can program all the services in the 
SDN controller for VMs. The NFV technology reduces new application costs 
and speeds up the process. Security is the primary concern of NFV because it 
is still in its infant stage.

32  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
A general SDN-IoT architecture with NFV is shown in Fig. 10, is 
discussed in [38]. The architecture consists of different modules: (1) NFVI, 
(2) VNFs, and (3) Management and orchestration plane (MANO). NFVI 
includes different hardware and software components required to connect 
to the carrier network. VNFs are run on one or multiple VMs and provide 
functionality to the different applications and services. The MANO provides 
connectivity for different services to NFVI, VNF, and APIs.
5.2  Blockchain Integrated with SDIoT Networks
A blockchain is a database that is shared between all nodes in a network. 
Blockchain can store information in a digital format. Blockchain ensures the 
guarantee of data security in its database. The blockchain stored the data in 
a block instead of tables. The blockchain can collect all the information, but 
there is no facility to edit, alter, or delete. In this way, the blockchain ensures 
the security of the data.
IoT interconnects devices and services to collect data, discover 
information, and support automation in various fields such as healthcare, 
education, smart cities, and smart homes. IoT always deals with heterogeneous 
devices and services that also provide heterogeneous data. IoT must provide 
flexibility, strict security, and confidentiality for these applications. SDN 
offers the scalability and flexibility of the services. In parallel, the Blockchain 
Figure 10.  NFV integrated SDIoT architecture.

Integrating IoT and SDN: System Architecture and Research Challenges  33
ensures the security of the system. The Blockchain-enabled SDIoT is now a 
new business model for various applications.
The work done in [39] proposes a blockchain-based architecture called 
BCSDNIoT for the SDIoT network for security, as shown in Fig. 11. The 
architecture consists of four layers. The perception layer includes all 
the IoT devices, sensors, and actuators for collecting data from different 
environments. The data plane consists of network gateways and OpenFlow 
switches. The gateway provides communication between IoT devices and 
OpenFlow switches. The control plane includes distributed SDN controllers 
and a blockchain network. All the controllers are connected to the blockchain 
network, so each device in the perception layer can also communicate with 
Figure 11.  Blockchain integrated SDIoT architecture.

the blockchain network. The Intrusion detection system (IDS) module in each 
controller prevents any external and internal attack in the network.
6.  Challenges and Future Directions
6.1  Security
Security and privacy issues are the main problems related to the SDIoT 
network. The heterogeneity of IoT devices and communication protocols 
worsened security issues [40, 41]. Due to the limited computing power and 
battery issues, highly complicated security systems added to IoT devices are 
impractical. The blockchain technique integrated with the SDN network can 
manage the security issues in the SDIoT network. The SDN provides the 
central view of the network, and the blockchain provides the data integrity in 
the network.
6.2  Resource Allocation
Allocating enough resources to IoT devices and applications takes time and 
effort. Due to its heterogeneous nature, the requirement for IoT devices is 
different. The NFV technology integrated with SDN can overcome this 
resource allocation problem and effectively handle network management.
6.3  Data Volume and Analysis
The use of IoT has risen due to the availability of high-speed internet and 
low-cost IoT devices. These IoT devices produce a large volume of 
heterogeneous data. Storing and analyzing this big data is a problem for 
industries nowadays. Cloudlet technologies such as cloud, fog, and edge 
computing techniques integrated with SDIoT can solve this big data issue. 
Cloud computing provides long-time data storage facilities and complex 
analysis techniques. The fog and edge computing provide temporary storage 
and immediate analysis results. It will make decision-making faster and 
reduce delays.
7.  Conclusion
IoT is a promising solution for many automated applications. The integration 
with IoT and SDN provides flexibility and programmability to the network. In 
this chapter, we focused on SDN-based IoT applications and their architectures 
to offer QoS, cost-effective and reliable services to users. Moreover, different 
integrating technologies of SDIoT are discussed—blockchain and NFV. We 
identified some issues and challenges presented in the SDIoT network and 
highlighted different valuable approaches to address the challenges. To sum

Chapter 3
Revolutionising HR through the 
Deployment of 
Blockchain Technology
A Bibliometric Review
Rukma Ramachandran1,* and Vimal Babu2
1.  Introduction
Blockchain Technology (BT) and Data Analytics (DA) have been rapidly 
adopted in various fields as they provide transparent and secured data 
visibility, in the field of Management. Several organisations have begun using 
the technology for supply chain management. Walmart, for example, has 
adopted a Blockchain-based system to track the supply chain of mangoes and 
pork in China, which has helped improve efficiency and transparency [1]. 
Furthermore, BT is also being employed in the sphere of finance to allow safe 
and transparent transactions. JP Morgan, for example, has deployed a BT for 
cross-border payments, reducing processing time from several days to a few 
hours [2], thus improving payment efficiency.
In the field of human resource management (HRM), BT transforms 
various HRM processes—it can securely store employee records, such as 
payroll information, contracts, and performance data. This can help increase 
the security and transparency of the HRM processes. Furthermore, BT can 
also be utilised to conduct background checks on candidates during the

recruitment process [3]. For example, a BT-based system can be used to keep 
a candidate’s educational qualifications and job history, which authorised 
people can access.
The use of DA in HRM has become increasingly common as organisations 
seek to leverage data-driven insights for more effective decision-making. 
The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has reported that 
71% of HR professionals use data analytics in their decision-making process, 
with the most common areas of application being recruitment and talent 
management [4].
For example, global companies such as Google and Intel, are using DA to 
identify and assess potential candidates. Google has implemented an algorithm 
that predicts job performance based on various factors, including education, 
work experience, and the candidate’s responses to a series of questions [5]. 
Similarly, Intel uses DA to identify patterns in employee behaviour and assess 
employee engagement, which helps in the development of employee retention 
strategies [6]. 
The scope for the use of BT in HRM is competitive and is a new area 
of exploration. BT helps in the verification of a job candidate’s credentials. 
This streamlines the hiring process, by keeping a protected and absolute 
record of a candidate’s education, work experience, and other credentials. The 
BT-based recruitment platform BlockRecruit, allows candidates to upload 
their verified credentials onto a blockchain, making it easier for recruiters to 
verify the information [7]. 
Thus, BT and DA collectively contribute to the development of 
blockchain-based HRM systems. These systems help store and manage 
employee data securely, while also leveraging data analytics to provide insights 
into employee behaviour and engagement. For example, the HRM platform 
Chronobank uses BT to store employee data securely and uses data analytics 
to provide insights into employee performance, which can help managers 
make better decisions about promotions, bonuses, and other incentives [8].
Therefore, this chapter understands the gap of the need to conduct 
Bibliometric analysis to understand the progress and trend in the rise of 
literature in BT and DA, particularly HR analytics. The purpose of the chapter 
is to:
	1.	 Identify and analyse the rising pattern of the use of BT and DA in the 
HRM of organisations.
	2.	 Determine authors and articles in the field of HRM of organisations with 
respect to BT and DA.

40  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
	3.	 Explore the co-authorship patterns in the literature on BT and DA in the 
HRM of organisations and identify the most impactful collaborations.
	4.	 Analyse the geographical distribution of research in HRM of organisations 
with respect to BT and DA and identify the leading countries in terms of 
research output.
2.  Literature Survey
2.1  HRM in the Era of Emerging Technologies
Organisations are adopting new technologies to improve their HR functions, 
enhance efficiency, and streamline their processes. Recently, the rise of DA 
and BT has revolutionised HR management. DA has enabled HR departments 
to make data-driven decisions, while BT provides a safe and apparent platform 
for managing HR records. HR teams now gain insights into employee 
performance, engagement, and retention. As a result, they have been able to 
devise methods to boost employee performance and retention. According to 
[9], HR departments use DA to evaluate employee performance and make 
informed decisions about hiring, training, and development.
Blockchain technology is also being used to improve HR management. 
It provides a secure and transparent platform for managing HR records, such 
as employee contracts, performance evaluations, and payroll. A study by [10] 
found that BT is being used to enhance the security and efficiency of HR 
processes, such as background checks, CV verification, and onboarding. 
In addition to DA and BT, other developing technologies, are also being 
used in HR management. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based 
recruitment tools are being used to screen job applicants and select the best 
prospects for the job. These technologies utilise machine learning algorithms 
to analyse resumes, cover letters, and other application materials, allowing 
HR teams to manage resources more efficiently and effectively during the 
recruitment process.
One example of an AI-based recruitment tool is Mya, an AI-powered 
chatbot that conducts initial candidate screening for companies such as 
Deloitte and L’Oréal. The chatbot asks relevant questions and assesses 
candidates’ eligibility for the post, using natural language processing and 
machine learning. Another example is Pymetrics, a game-based assessment 
platform that uses neuroscience and AI to recruit the best candidates for a 
given job.
2.2  The Use of BT in HRM
Research studies have highlighted the possibility of BT in HRM. A study by 
Wang et al. [10] found that BT is being used to enhance the security and 

Revolutionising HR through the Deployment of Blockchain Technology  41
efficiency of HR processes, such as background checks, C.V. verification and 
onboarding. The authors found that BT can provide a secure and tamper-proof 
platform for storing employee records, making it easier for HR departments 
to verify employee credentials and ensure compliance.
Similarly, another study [11], showcased blockchain’s potential in talent 
management. The authors proposed a BT-based computer system for talent 
management. The system uses BT to store candidate information, verify 
credentials, and track the hiring process, making it easier for HR departments 
to manage and track talent acquisition and work on smart contracts to automate 
the recruitment and hiring process. As BT’s use grows in organisations, more 
HR departments are anticipated to utilise blockchain-based tools to optimise 
their HR operations.
2.3  Use of Data Analytics in Human Resource Management
Data analytics has revolutionised HRM by enabling HR departments to make 
data-driven decisions. Vast amounts of data on employee performance, 
productivity, and engagement can now be analysed leveraging DA, enabling 
the department to analyse patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to 
improve HRM practices. 
HR departments, for example, can use predictive analytics to discover 
the best candidates for job openings by analysing resumes, career history, 
and competencies. Analytics can also be used to assess employee performance 
and find areas for improvement. According to Wang et al. [12], DA is being 
utilised in HRM to boost employee engagement and retention by analysing 
employee feedback, performance statistics, and social media data.
Data analytics can also be used to track employee well-being and 
mental health. DA can be used to detect early indicators of employee burnout 
and stress by analysing employee behaviour, communication patterns, and 
social media activity [13]. This can assist HR departments in developing ways 
to enhance employee well-being and lower the risk of burnout. 
Furthermore, DA can be utilised to assess the efficacy of HRM 
programmes and policies. HR departments can track the effectiveness 
of training and development programmes, employee perks, and other HR 
activities. This can assist HR departments in making informed judgments 
about future HRM strategies and investments.
Therefore, with the use of DA in HRM it is becoming increasingly 
important for organisations to stay competitive and improve their HRM 
practices. By leveraging data analytics, HR departments can gain valuable 
insights into employee performance, engagement, and well-being, and use 
this information to make informed decisions about recruitment, retention, 
training, and development.

42  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
2.4  Collective Contribution of Blockchain Technology and Data 
Analytics in Human Resource Management
Blockchain technology and Data Analytics can collectively improve HRM 
practices in organisations. Blockchain provides a secure and transparent 
platform for managing HR records, while DA can be used to identify 
and analyse the hash function in the chain of blocks. This can enable HR 
departments to improve their decision-making processes, reduce costs, and 
increase efficiency.
For example, BT can be used to store employee records such as 
performance data, payroll information, and contracts. These records can be 
accessed by authorised personnel, and the records are tamper-proof, ensuring 
their integrity. DA can then be used to evaluate this data to identify trends, 
patterns, and insights that can be used to improve HRM practices.
A study by Salah et al. [16] found that the combination of BT and DA can 
be used to create a secure and decentralised HRM system. The study projected 
a BT-based HRM system that uses data analytics to analyse employee data 
and make informed decisions about HRM practices.
3.  Methodology
BT has emerged recently due to its potential to revolutionise various industries. 
In the field of HRM, decision-making, and analytics, BT has been suggested as 
a solution to various problems such as data privacy, security, and transparency. 
However, a systematic literature review related to the use of BT in these areas 
is still lacking. Thus, the study aims to identify and screen articles related to 
the use of BT and DA in HRM, decision-making, and provide an overview of 
the research conducted in this area.
For the accomplishment of the purpose of this study, we used the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) protocol. The PRISMA protocol is a widely recognised framework 
for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It consists of four 
stages: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Table 1 shows the 
PRISMA protocol as explained below:
3.1  Identification
We conducted a comprehensive search of an electronic database (Scopus) for 
articles related to the use of BT in HRM, decision-making, and analytics. 
The search was conducted on 10th April 2023, and we used the following 
keywords: “blockchain” AND (“human resource” OR “HRM” OR “analytics” 
OR “decision making”). The search strategy was designed to identify articles 

Revolutionising HR through the Deployment of Blockchain Technology  43
that were relevant to our research question. The total number of articles 
retrieved in this stage was 2598.

and inclusion of articles. By using a rigorous methodology, we were able to 
provide a comprehensive overview of the literature BT and DA in HRM.
4.  Results and Findings
4.1  Current Trends
The statistics in Table 2 show an increase in the publication of articles on both 
BT and DA in recent years. In 2017, there were only two publications on the 
topic, but by 2022, there were 190 papers published, indicating the increasing 
interest in these emerging technologies.
The rise in publications on BT and DA suggests that both these 
technologies have significant potential in HR management. BT provides a 
secure and transparent platform for managing HR records, which can reduce 
fraudulent actions, errors, and data ethics. The use of BT in HR can improve 
the security and efficiency of HR processes, such as background checks, CV 
verification, and payroll.

DA, on the other hand, enables HR departments to leverage big data 
analytics to analyse the patterns, trends, and perceptions that can be used to 
improve HRM practices. Data analytics is being used in several HRM areas, 
including recruitment, employee retention, and training and development.
Overall, the increasing number of publications on Blockchain Technology 
and Data Analytics suggests that these technologies are becoming more 
important in HR management. The potential benefits of these technologies 
include improved efficiency, better decision-making, and enhanced security. 
As more organisations adopt these technologies, it is persistent to play an 
increasingly important role in the future of HR management.
4.2  Most Influential Authors and Publications—Citation Analysis
Citation analysis is an essential part of Bibliometric analysis and involves the 
identification of the number of occurrences of articles that have been cited by 
other works. This helps researchers to analyse the most influential publications 
and authors in a particular field of study, as well as the relationships between 
different research topics. This information can be used to understand the 
evolution of research trends over time, to identify research gaps, and to 
highlight areas where further research is needed.
VOS Viewer is a popular software tool used for citation analysis. The 
tool is designed to help researchers visualise Bibliometric networks, including 
co-authorship and citation networks. It provides an easy way to explore large 
bibliographic datasets and identify key publications, authors, and research 
topics. The current study utilises this software to serve the research objectives.
The aim of conducting this analysis in Bibliometric research is fulfilled 
with deeper insights into the research landscape in a particular field. By 
analysing citation patterns, researchers can identify the most influential 
works and authors, as well as the relationships between different research 
topics. Therefore, to uncover the facts, and to lay future research directions, 
the study aims to achieve its purpose. Overall, it is an important measurement 
for obtaining interpretation into the research avenue and can help researchers 
make more informed decisions about their research priorities and strategies.
The analysis in Table 3, uncovers the top authors in the area of HRM of 
organisations with respect to BT and DA and is dominated by authors who 
have researched and published works on different areas of BT [14].
Most of the articles in the list focus on the application of BT in industrial 
and managerial functions. The articles also explore the use of BT to address 
issues such as transparency, traceability, and sustainability in Industry and 
Management.
The authors on the list are from various parts of the world, with a significant 
number of authors from India and China. The list includes authors from both 

46  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
academia and industry, highlighting the importance of collaboration between 
academia and industry in researching and developing blockchain technology 
applications.
4.3  The Most Impactful Collaboration of Co-Authorship
Analysing co-authorship of documents based on organisations is an important 
aspect of Bibliometric analysis. This analysis provides insights into the 
collaborative research efforts of organisations and helps identify the most 
productive and influential organisations in a given field.
Table 4 shows the analysis of co-authorship of documents based on 
organisations which are listed along with number of citations and strengths. 
The organisations listed have published three to four documents and have 
received citations ranging from 57 to 370. The total link strength is a measure 
of the strength of the co-authorship links between the authors from the same 
organisation. It provides information on how closely the authors are connected 
in terms of their research collaborations. An organisation with a higher link

strength indicates a stronger collaboration among its authors, which can lead 
to more impactful research outputs. 
4.4  Leading Countries in Terms of Research Output
Bibliographic coupling is a Bibliometric analysis method, that compares the 
number of common references shared by two papers to determine how similar 
their research interests are. It is an essential research method for establishing 
links between research papers and authors.
In the context of BT and DA, Bibliographic coupling can help identify 
the leading countries in terms of research contribution towards this field. By 
analysing the count of citations, documents, and total link strength of different 
countries, we can understand the level of research activities and collaborations 
between countries in this field.
Table 5 gives an insight into the Bibliographic coupling of leading 
countries in terms of research contribution towards BT and DA. The Table 
shows the country (region), along with the total count of documents, citations, 
and strength.
The United States, China, and India have the highest number of documents 
and citations, indicating their leading contribution towards research on BT and 
DA. The same is shown in Fig. 2. Of importance is that, the total link strength 
of India is higher than that of China and the United States, indicating a higher 
degree of collaboration and interconnectivity between Indian research papers 
on this topic. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and 
South Korea, also have made significant contributions to research in this field. 
These insights can help researchers and policymakers identify the leading 
countries and potential collaborators in this field, which can lead to better 
cooperation and research outcomes.

4.5  Co-citation Analysis
The frequency of co-citation of references in other publications is used to 
determine the strength of links between documents in Co-citation Analysis. 
It is a widely used approach for identifying influential works and writers, as 
well as for mapping the intellectual structure of a research topic. Co-citation 
analysis includes author co-citation, journal/source co-citation, and keyword 
co-citation. The examination of author co-citations requires determining the 
frequency with which writers are mentioned in other works jointly. The study 
of journal/source co-citations involves determining how frequently journals 
or sources are mentioned together in other publications. Keyword co-citation 
analysis is the technique of determining the frequency with which keywords 
are mentioned together in other publications.
The Process
There are two main methods of Co-citation Analysis:-full counting and 
fractional counting. 
Full counting involves assigning each co-citation a value of 1, regardless of 
the number of co-citations involving that pair of documents. This method is 
simpler and easier to apply, but it may overestimate the strength of relationships 
between documents.
Fractional counting involves assigning a fraction of a co-citation to each 
document and documents cited in the co-citation. Although it is more 
complex, but is considered to be more accurate, as it accounts for the 
number of co-citations involving each document. In the study mentioned, 
co-citation analysis was performed on authorship co-citation and journal/source 
co-citation using fractional counting methods. Authorship co-citation analysis 
involved identifying the frequency with which authors were cited together 
in other publications related to the research field of interest. Journal/source 
co-citation analysis involved identifying the frequency with which journals 
or sources were cited together in other publications related to the research 
field of interest. The fractional counting method was used to account for the 
number of co-citations involving each document, which provided a more 
accurate representation of the strength of relationships between documents. 
Co-citation analysis is a useful technique for identifying important works and 
authors in a research field and mapping the intellectual structure of that field. 
Table 6 represents the co-citation analysis of authorship co-citation. This 
analysis aims to identify the most cited authors within a particular research 
field. In this case, the focus is on BT and DA. The Table above provides 
information on the count of citations and strength for each author. Citations 
refer to the count of an author’s work that is cited by different authors, while 

50  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
total link strength refers to the sum of all the links between the given author 
and other authors within the same co-citation network.
From Fig. 3 below, we can observe that Zhang, Y. has the highest number 
of citations and total link strength, indicating that his work is frequently cited 
by other authors in the field. Similarly, Sarkis, J. and Wang, Y. also have high 
citations and link strength, suggesting that their research is influential in the 
field. Other notable authors in Fig. 3 include Gunasekaran, A., Kumar, N., 
and Kouhizadeh, M., who have the highest count of citations and total link 
strength, indicating that their research is influential and widely cited by other 
authors in the field.
Overall, this Co-citation Analysis of authorship co-citation provides 
insights into the most influential authors in the field of BT and DA, which can 
analyse the rising research pattern and scope of future research.

5.  Discussion
Bibliometric analysis is an important tool of research which is used to analyse 
the impact and influence of scholarly publications in a particular field of 
study. In recent times, the use of BT and DA in HRM have gained much 
attention from scholars and practitioners alike. As a result, it becomes critical 

Revolutionising HR through the Deployment of Blockchain Technology  53
to consider and analyse the upcoming patterns in this area of study, to provide 
insights for future research and practice.
As evident in Figs. 5 and 6, one can easily identify the need to include BT 
and DA in the HRM of an organisation.. As seen in the figures, a negligible 
number of sub-areas of HRM can be found. This attracts more publications in 
collaboration with the HRM of an organisation to work with the collaborative 
effort of BT and DA.

Figure 6.  Co-occurrence of data analytics and blockchain.

54  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
This study utilises Bibliometric Analysis to achieve the research 
objectives, which are to identify current trends, most influential authors and 
articles, co-authorship patterns, and leading countries in the use of BT and DA 
in HRM of organisations. The Bibliometric Analysis enables the identification 
and analysis of research patterns, collaborations, and contributions of scholars 
and institutions to a particular field of study.
This discussion will provide insights into the Bibliometric review from 
the study and their implications and directions for future practice. The use of 
Bibliometric analysis in this study provides a comprehensive understanding 
of the research landscape in the area of BT and DA in HRM of organisations. 
The findings of this study highlight the increasing trend in the use of BT and 
DA in the HRM of organisations. 
The use of BT in HRM has gained significant attention due to its 
capability to enhance transparency, data privacy, and security in HRM 
processes. Similarly, the use of DA in HRM has been found to enhance 
decision-making, improve recruitment and selection processes, and increase 
employee engagement and retention.
The co-authorship analysis revealed that there is a significant level of 
collaboration in the literature on BT and DA in HRM, with Zhang, Y., Wang, 
Y., and Chen, X. being the most impactful collaborators. This implies that 
collaboration is essential for the advancement of knowledge in this area. 
Therefore, future research should encourage collaboration among authors, 
institutions, and countries to facilitate the development of knowledge in 
this field.
The geographical analysis revealed that the United States, China, and 
India are the leading countries in terms of research output in the area of HRM 
with respect to BT and DA. This implies that these countries have invested 
significantly in research in this field. However, there is a need for increased 
research from other countries to enhance the diversity of perspectives and 
approaches in this area of research.
Based on the findings of this study, it is clear that the use of BT and 
DA in organisational HRM is an area of research that requires additional 
investigation. Researchers, institutions, and governments should invest more 
in this subject to better understand how these technologies might be used to 
improve human resource management operations. Collaboration between 
authors, institutions, and countries should be encouraged in order to enhance 
knowledge in this field. Finally, future research should aim to widen the scope 
of viewpoints and approaches to this topic by including other countries in the 
geographical analysis.

6.  Limitations and Future Scope of Research
	 •	 The study is based on a specific set of keywords and databases, which 
may not cover all relevant articles and authors in the field. It is possible 
that some relevant publications were excluded from the analysis due to 
the limitations of the search terms used. 
	 •	 The study only considers articles written in English, which may have 
resulted in the exclusion of important research published in other 
languages. 
	 •	 Bibliometric Analysis being a quantitative method relies on the availability 
and accuracy of citation data. However, citation data can be influenced 
by factors such as self-citation and citation biases, which may limit the 
accuracy of the analysis. 
	 •	 Bibliometric Analysis cannot provide a complete picture of the research 
landscape and should be complemented with qualitative methods such as 
expert interviews and case studies to gain an inclusive understanding of 
the trends and practices in the field.
Overall, while the Bibliometric Analysis provides valuable insights into 
the present research on BT and DA in HRM of organisations, the findings 
should be interpreted with caution and considered in conjunction with other 
sources of information.
Based on the findings of this study, there is scope for future research 
that can be explored in the area of BT and DA in HRM. Firstly, while this 
study focused on the Bibliometric Analysis of publications in this field, 
future research can investigate the actual implementation and adoption of 
BT and DA in HRM practices. This can involve case studies and surveys of 
organisations to gain insights into the challenges, benefits, and outcomes of 
using these technologies. Secondly, the co-authorship analysis revealed the 
most impactful collaborations in this field. Future research can explore the 
nature and dynamics of these collaborations, and investigate how it leads to the 
development and knowledge in this area. Thirdly, the geographical distribution 
analysis identified the leading countries in terms of research output. Future 
research can investigate the factors that contribute to the research output of

1.  Introduction
According to Xu [107], the construction industry is commonly acknowledged 
as a sector that heavily relies on information, which requires precise, 
all-encompassing, and prompt communication in a clear format that the 
intended receiver can understand. During the complete duration of a 
construction project, a significant volume of information is generated, 
spanning from the preliminary ideation phase to the ultimate dismantling 
phase. Effective management of information flow, processing of vast amounts 
of data, and extraction of actionable insights are essential for achieving 
success in construction projects [20]. Scholars have observed that effective 
information management is critical at every construction project’s lifecycle 
stage. This includes the creation and dissemination of information and its 
comprehension and application in the construction, upkeep, repurposing, and 
eventual disposal of the project. The academic discourse has predominantly 
centered on data management in the design and construction stages, despite 
acknowledging the importance of information  throughout  the project’s 
lifespan. Despite the fact that these stages are crucial, they only contribute

between 30 and 40% of the project’s overall costs. According to Nical [75], the 
operating and usage phase comprises 60 to 80% of the entire project lifecycle.
The conservative stance of the construction industry towards 
technological advancements and their potential applications has been a subject 
of criticism. However, in recent decades, the industry has made significant 
strides in improving information management by implementing BIM [73]. 
3D object information systems have replaced the conventional approach of 
the construction industry of utilizing 2D drawing information systems due 
to the advent of BIM [13]. BIM has been a pivotal instrument of innovation 
within the construction sector for over a decade. The attainment of objectives 
in building design, is contingent upon the adoption of a holistic approach, the 
promotion of collaboration and communication among key stakeholders, the 
enhancement of productivity, the improvement of the final product’s overall 
quality, and the minimization of fragmentation. These factors have been 
identified as critical [90, 97]. As highlighted in reference [28], BIM offers a 
notable advantage in cohesively presenting project information throughout its 
entire life cycle, unlike a fragmented approach.
Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, employs the most recent 
advancements in Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enable 
notable progress in diverse fields [63]. The principal aim of this initiative is to 
augment efficiency and efficacy by facilitating intercommunication between 
machines [106]. The industrial production technological advances of Industry 
4.0, commonly known as “Digital Twins” (DT), are frequently characterized 
as a virtual copy of a physical asset with  high precision and real-time 
bidirectional interaction capabilities for simulation objectives. Furthermore, it 
provides decision-supporting functionalities to improve product services. This 
definition is supported by reference [115]. DT provides a practical method for 
tracking resources, simulating scenarios, and coming up with solutions, and 
is frequently considered a flexible and scalable solution [100, 116]. There 
has been a surge of interest among academic and business communities in 
utilizing DT systems within the construction sector.
Although a significant study has been conducted on the utilization and 
advantages of BIM in the construction process, it has been noted that BIM 
must also capture the data produced during the operational and usage phases, 
as evidenced by previous studies [57]. Integrating innovative technologies 
is of utmost importance for the construction industry, especially in the 
context of the advent of Industry 4.0. The DT,  a digitization technology, 
specifically developed to monitor a physical asset and enhance operational 
efficiency by acquiring real-time data that enables predictive maintenance and 
informs decision-making, constitutes a pivotal component of the Industry 4.0 
strategy [57].

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  61
1.1  The Principle of Intelligent Building Construction
The notion of Integrated Construction (IC) is based on the integration 
of advanced construction technology [56, 72, 112, 114] and Information 
Technology (IT) [45, 47, 53, 60, 62], with a particular emphasis on 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [11, 30, 55], as reported by the Global 
Engineering Frontier 2018 [27]. Traditionally, the construction life-cycle, 
which includes project approval, design, manufacturing, transportation, 
assembly, operation and maintenance, and service, is  when the activities 
related to making physical systems, like building parts, techniques, and 
components, are examined. The twin model of cyberspace [110, 113] is used 
to aid in the comprehension and utilization of data, the creation of models, the 
evaluation and forecasting of states, the application of intelligent optimization 
techniques, and the making of important decisions. This is achieved by 
applying knowledge concerning creating objects, processes, equipment, and 
procedures, encouraging  innovation, and  incorporating  intelligent-sensing 
technology [49, 101, 111].
The construction industry has undergone significant technological 
advancements, prompting the introduction of Industry 4.0, which proposes 
a novel construction technology aimed at achieving high adaptability, rapid 
design changes through IT, and more flexible technical workforce training. CPS 
[11, 30, 55], BIM [36, 85], IoT [31, 91], big data [7, 9], and cloud computing 
[46, 108] are just some of the cutting-edge technologies currently used in 
construction. The notion of Industrial Ecology (IE) has gained heightened 
prominence in the era of Industry 4.0, owing to the growing urgency of 
sustainability as a critical issue. The concept of Intelligent Construction 
(IC) involves the integration of various technological advancements such as 
perception technology, data mining, design optimization, and management 
decision-making to ensure a smooth and efficient construction process. This 
approach aims to effectively coordinate all involved parties and achieve 
energy-efficient completion of construction tasks. These developments have 
been documented in various academic sources [33, 65, 78]. The phenomenon 
of diversification has been noted in the field of Integrated Circuits (IC), 
as there has been a proliferation of IC systems that are tailored to perform 
specific functions and are being utilised in real-world construction endeavors. 
As a result, there has been a significant increase in cognitive capacity 
in construction, as evidenced by studies [15, 83].
1.2  DT’s Basic Idea
Greives [41] defines DT as “a model for creating an informational mirror 
image of a physical object” (animate and inanimate alike). Integrating physical 
and virtual realms facilitates uninterrupted data transmission and allows for 

62  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
the cohabitation of virtual and physical entities [34]. The definition of DT 
comprises two fundamental constituents. The initial emphasis is on elucidating 
the correlation between the tangible prototype and its digital simulation. 
To generate data in real-time, sensors [48, 74] establish a connection. As 
previously stated, DT refers to a digital representation of a physical entity that 
is updated in real time. It accurately maps physical objects, and depending on 
particular models, it can describe and improve these objects.
2.  Review of Literature
This section analyzes  the present status of Digital Twin implementation 
in the construction sector, focusing on its key features, specifically  quick 
updates, and two-way coordination. Although smart buildings with automated 
systems are increasingly common, the construction sector has adopted DT 
less frequently than other industries. Digital Technology utilisation  within 
the construction industry, possesses a vast scope that surpasses the mere 
incorporation of automated systems into structures. It also includes the 
synchronization of these systems, which makes it easier for the cyber and 
physical domains to work closely together. These systems are often called 
Cyber-Physical systems. Integrating  these systems, in building design 
and construction presents opportunities for developing  sophisticated and 
intelligent structures [10, 70]. These structures integrate automated sensors, 
actuators, and other technologies that act as a means of monitoring physical 
assets. This establishes a basis for the implementation of DT.
The functionality of DT is reliant on quick updates and bidirectional 
communication [80]. According to research, incorporating DT into the 
technological development process, provides a more adaptable and refined 
model, mainly when implemented in the early stages of product creation [43]. 
DT’s advancement is contingent upon acquiring sensory data derived from the 
tangible prototype. The virtual model can efficiently manage and supervise 
the product by acquiring requisite data from tangible resources. According 
to reference [80], project managers and analysts can access the virtual model 
produced via their mobile devices. Thus, incorporating a DT during the initial 
stages of a project would guarantee precise synchronisation and efficient 
operation of the system.
The utilisation of DT technology enables the collection of data, which can 
facilitate the efficiency of construction activities and management, throughout 
the life cycle over an extended period. However, the extent of optimisation 
is dependent on the quantity of information gathered. The outcomes of DT 
are ascertained through the amalgamation of information and empirical 

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  63
evidence generated by the sensors  integrated into the tangible systems. In 
terms of architecture and built environment,1 DT has been determined to 
possess various attributes, including BIM and the ability to generate 3D and 
2D representations, schedules, contracts, and construction documents such as 
submittals, change orders, and RFIs. Additionally, operational data obtained 
from embedded sensors and data derived from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning technology are also incorporated into DT. Integrating these 
characteristics enables intelligent building administrators to attain access, 
regulate, identify malfunctions, and make informed judgments concerning a 
property’s diverse systems, workspaces, and conglomerates.
One example of implementing  DT in the built environment is the 
Frasers Tower in Singapore. This establishment provides an interconnected 
collaborative workspace that caters  to the needs of individuals and 
businesses, seeking to leverage DT for their operations.2 Bentley Systems 
and Schneider Electric worked together on the project at hand. The project 
involved acquiring data through the utilization of 179 Bluetooth beacons in 
conference rooms and 900 sensors specifically intended for assessing lighting, 
temperature, and air quality. The platform above utilises embedded sensors 
and telemetry to generate 2,100 data points, subsequently linked to the cloud 
through Microsoft Azure. This integration facilitates the implementation of 
a comprehensive environmental management system. The implementation 
of digital technology solutions within the construction industry in Singapore 
needs to be improved in contrast to other sectors. 
As per the findings of Bughin et al.’s research [26], the construction 
sector has a relatively low adoption rate of digitization, estimated at 1.4%. On 
the contrary, the ICT sector exhibits the most significant rate of digitization 
adoption, approximated at 4.6%. The investigation was carried out within 
the timeframe  2005 to 2014. Thus,  the implementation of digitisation 
within the construction sector may have escalated after this period. Brilakis 
et al. [24] assert that, despite the potential benefits that DT technology can 
offer stakeholders in the built environment, its full potential has not yet been 
realized.
When developing a Decision Tree, it is imperative to define the objective 
for which it is being constructed clearly. The selection of the physical asset 
that is to undergo digitisation and the corresponding Level of Detail (LoD) 
necessary for the creation of the DT is dependent on the intended objective of 
the DT [24]. This is because a DT entails advanced analytical techniques and 
is a broad notion. DT can be defined as the application of digital technologies

64  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
to achieve a project or industry objective within the construction domain. As 
per the findings of Braun et al. [23], the primary role of a DT is to monitor 
and oversee the advancement of construction projects. The DT objective to 
assess the condition of a bridge was defined by another application in the 
construction sector [88]. According to scholarly literature, a geometric DT is 
a computer-generated model augmented with semantic information, serving 
as the basis for constructing a comprehensive DT [24]. The first stage in 
creating  a DT entails the production of a digital geometric representation 
that will be linked to the corresponding physical component serving as the 
foundation for the DT application.
BIM is a crucial instrument in a structure’s  planning, building, and 
maintenance. It can  produce the necessary three-dimensional models that 
are necessary for the creation of a digital prototype [24]. BIM offers DT an 
essential input (including geometrical inputs), especially for new projects. 
It is noted that even though these processes are automated, they still take 
more time than using digital models created with BIM. Agapaki et al. [2] 
made this determination, identifying that the labor hours used to model 
53,834 pipes were approximately 5,200, if the digital representations of the 
facilities were accessible, it is possible that the time spent could have been 
allocated toward other constructive endeavors. Nevertheless, endeavors are 
underway to employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the modeling of 
extant structures. The office space modeling was automated by Qi et al. [32] 
using semantic segmentation of points cloud deep learning. Apart from the 
ultimate chromatic manifestation, the output model maintains congruity with 
the input model about its geometry.
Brilakis et al. [24] have reported that geometric models are generated 
through  Bottom-up and Top-down methodologies. The Bottom-up 
methodology involves the identification of geometric primitives, such as 
lines, planes, and cuboids, within a given point cloud. These primitives 
are subsequently organised and classified into more complex geometrical 
structures, and their spatial and functional interrelationships are established. 
Ultimately, a geometric model is generated based on the steps above. The 
Top-Down methodology produces geometric models by recognizing 
that items within the representations can be differentiated, based on their 
orientation and interdependence with other entities in the constructed setting, 
such as the interrelationship between towers, levels, and chambers. This 
approach is dependent on the asset’s context, and it works well for buildings 
and overpasses that adhere to standardized contextual guidelines. The present 
discourse expounds on the techniques employed in generating geometric 

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  65
models from pre-existing structures, obviating the requirement of digital 
models to construct the requisite DT platform.
Following the creation of the digital representation of the DT, the 
subsequent step involves integrating it with the physical system. The bridge is 
equipped with sensors that gather pertinent information, which is subsequently 
modeled in the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud infrastructure to provide the 
expected instantaneous notifications. Utilisation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and Machine Learning (ML) are employed to replicate the information derived 
from the tangible assets within the IoT cloud. DT must conduct sophisticated 
data analytics on the IoT cloud, to achieve contemporary updates and 
bidirectional communication. The functional specifications of the proposed 
DT platform serve as the basis for data analytics, as they delineate the 
platform’s purpose. The physical entity undergoes uninterrupted data gathering 
through sensors accountable for transferring the data to the IoT platform, via 
the communication network. Following this, a data simulation is performed 
on the forum. The sensors are utilised to incorporate the feedback into the 
physical asset. The virtual model is subject to continuous updates contingent 
upon the physical asset’s current condition.
3.  Building Information Modeling
BIM has emerged as a crucial methodology for the digitization of the supply 
chain for the built environment. It is a knowledge-sharing methodology, 
that employs digital representations of a building’s structural and functional 
elements [17]. Over recent years, the employment of incentives and BIM has 
experienced a notable increase. It has garnered significant attention due to 
its capacity to enhance quality and minimize costs and time [14]. Although 
BIM has been implemented in various significant design and construction 
undertakings, it has yet to become  ubiquitous in  the industry. Modern 
construction and design endeavors have exhibited enhanced efficacy in cost 
reduction, quality improvement, schedule adherence, and facilitation of 
superior communication among project stakeholders. Implementing  BIM 
as a methodology has resulted in several benefits for project owners. These 
benefits include the potential to mitigate claims, simplify calculations 
and visualizations for marketing purposes, and promote interdisciplinary 
collaboration.
BIM originated during the 1950s and 1960s through  Computer Aided 
Design (CAD). The development of CAD software can be traced back to 
1963 when Ivan Sutherland created Sketchpad, a graphical user interface. 

66  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Subsequently, in the 1970s, the French Aerospace Company converted the 
software from two dimensions (2D) to three dimensions (3D). After  this, 
Autodesk attained eminence in the realm of Information Technology 
throughout the 1980s and 1990s, owing to the triumph of its AutoCAD 
offering. The 4D model was introduced to aid stakeholders, particularly those 
in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) sector, in effectively 
managing time-sensitive schedules and resource allocation. This model 
superseded the previous 3D model. Subsequently, the development of 5D 
was initiated in correlation with the estimation of project expenses. Quantity 
surveyors or cost estimators can utilize the 5D model to authenticate project 
costs during the estimation phase. The sixth dimension (6D) emphasizes 
sustainable practices more, whereas the seventh dimension (7D) is primarily 
concerned with managing  facilities. Nevertheless, the functions above  are 
imperative for the expansion of n-dimensional space. As per Beveridge’s 
[18] findings, the 8D designation was intended for integrated project delivery 
and maintainability. Accordingly, the  9D assignment was allocated for 
acoustics, the 10D title was assigned for security, and the 11D appointment 
was reserved for heat. This illustrates that the development of BIM originated 
in the 1950s and has since undergone an ongoing evolution.
BIM is a swiftly growing and pioneering technology, widely employed in 
the global construction industry. This tool is imperative in modern engineering, 
construction, and architectural procedures. The technology above facilitates 
the generation of one or multiple precise digital representations of edifices, 
exhibiting commendable interoperability. 
The ISO196503 standard endorses a novel technology that has been 
sanctioned by the government and is applicable to projects of varying levels 
and dimensions. By 2022, BIM softwares such as Revit, Navisworks, Tekla, 
BIM Collab, Plannerly, and Autodesk BIM 360 will enable interoperability. 
BIM encompasses various  levels and dimensions. It has been utilized in 
various endeavors. 
John Sisk & Son successfully integrated BIM into the Quintain Wembley 
project4 in London by utilizing their Digital Project Delivery (DPD) 
methodology, as documented in a case study by BIM Plus. Furthermore, Revit 
was utilized to simulate the NHS Nightingale Hospital in East London.5

3.1  Applications
The following are some of the ways in which different applications of a BIM 
can be put to use:
	 •	 Rendering in three dimensions can be quickly and easily produced 
in-house with very little additional labor required.
	 •	 Generating shop drawings for diverse building systems is a straightforward 
task. Upon completion of the model, the metal sheet ductwork shop 
drawing can be expeditiously generated. This serves as an illustration of 
the ease with which it can be accomplished.
	 •	 These models are available for use by fire departments along with other 
officials in the course of their evaluation of building projects.
	 •	 Modifying a Building Information Model to visually depict potential 
issues, such as leaks and evacuation plans, is straightforward.
	 •	 Facilities management departments can utilize BIM software to facilitate 
repairs, layout modifications, and maintenance operations.
	 •	 The BIM software comes equipped with a built-in cost feature estimation. 
Any changes made to the model cause automatic extraction and 
modification of the quantity of material.
	 •	 Material ordering, building component fabrication, and delivery can all 
be effectively scheduled with the help of a BIM.
	 •	 The three-dimensional scaling of BIM models, allows for comprehensive 
visual inspection of practical systems, thereby identifying and 
eliminating potential interferences. Using this procedure, it is possible 
to ensure that the pipes do not come into contact with any steel beams, 
ducts, or walls.
3.2  Benefits
As per the findings of CRC Construction Innovation [54], the primary benefit 
of BIM is its ability to offer a precise geometric depiction of a building’s 
constituents in a unified data ecosystem. Additional advantages encompass 
the following aspects:
	 •	 It is much simpler to share information and is also possible to reuse it and 
add value to it.
	 •	 Analyzing  building proposals, rapid simulation execution, and 
performance bench-marking are all viable methods for developing 
enhanced and innovative solutions.
	 •	 The cost of longevity is better understood, and there is greater predictability 
in environmental performance.

68  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
	 •	 The output of documentation is adaptable and makes use of automation.
	 •	 The electronic representation of product data can be utilized in subsequent 
stages of production, including the fabrication and integration of structural 
systems. In addition, this data can also be exploited for financial gains.
	 •	 When presented in a clear and concise manner, proposals are more easily 
understood.
	 •	 Data about prerequisites, blueprinting, erection, and functioning can all 
be employed in facilities administration.
4.  DT-Key Concepts
4.1  History
The initial mention of a “twin” in the domain of DT can be traced to the 
aerospace industry and has its origins in NASA’s Apollo project during the 
1960s, as documented in NASA Technology Roadmaps [22, 73, 92]. The 
NASA project involved the construction of two spacecrafts, one of which 
would orbit the planet as ‘the twin’ and carry out the mission [22, 117]. 
Rosen et al. [86] employed the term “twin” as a representation that effectively 
mirrored the operational behaviour of the missions in real-time. According to 
Zhaung et al. [117], the “twin” was a tangible entity during that period. ‘Twin’ 
did not at this time include the digital component. The phrase “Digital Twin” 
was first introduced by Michael Grieves in 2003 within the context of his 
instruction on Product LManagement (PLM) [42]. PLM is a comprehensive 
approach that encompasses a range of business activities associated with data 
creation, modification, and utilization, spanning the entire product lifecycle 
from design and production to maintenance, recycling, and disposal [89]. 
According to Kritzinger et al. [61], DT is a digital representation of a physical 
system created as a distinct entity but continues to be linked to the biological 
system. This definition was derived from an industry presentation cited by 
the authors. Following definitions and implementations of DT have adopted 
this mode of reasoning, wherein intelligent devices are utilised to establish 
a connection between a digital representation and a tangible object, and 
the digital model is continuously updated in real time through a functional 
communication infrastructure. As per the findings of Grieves and Vickers 
[43], the DT should comprise comprehensive and relevant data about  the 
physical system asset, which is acquired through rigorous examination of 
the real-world scenario. This is necessary to ensure that the DT accurately 
and effectively reflects the biological system. Figure 1 presents a concise 
overview of significant advancements in the evolution of the DT concept.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  69
4.2  Definition of DT
The initial stage in comprehending the DT concept involves providing a lucidly 
articulated definition. Various scholars have proposed distinct interpretations to 
articulate the nature of DT technologies. Michael Grieves initially defined DT 
as an information mirroring model [44] during his  Product Management 
course. Nonetheless, this definition is needed to comprehend the concept of DT 
comprehensively. Several authors have formulated the following definitions 
of DT. Rosen et al. [86] characterized DT as a fusion of tangible and intangible 
domains that are analogous to one another, to evaluate the life cycle functions 
of the fundamental component. This definition offers a concise elucidation 
of the role and components of the DT. Boschert and Rosen [22] subsequently 
provided a more concise definition of DT as encompassing all pertinent 
physical and functional information about a given system or product. The 
definition in question accentuated the significance of data interchange and the 
algorithms that regulate the behavior of both tangible and intangible models. 
Despite its brevity, this definition disregarded the constituent elements and 
objectives of DT data, instead opting to concentrate exclusively on the data 
itself. Grieves and Vickers [43] have expounded on the concept of DT in PLM, 
characterizing it as a collection of digital information constructs that precisely 
depict a physically manufactured product, encompassing its atomic and 
macro-geometric aspects. It is a digital depiction of the output. To gain a more 
comprehensive understanding of the digital design of the final product and to 
address any potential discrepancies in execution, it was proposed to conduct 
a comparison between a DT and its corresponding engineering design, which 
represents the physical manifestation of the object [43]. The current definition 
provides a more comprehensive account of DT compared to Grieve’s report of 
2005 [44], with a heightened focus on managing the life cycle.
According to Lui et al. [66], the concept of Digital Twin can be defined as 
a flexible depiction of a concrete resource or structure that adjusts promptly 
to operational changes, by gathering and evaluating real-time data  and 
can anticipate future conditions of the related physical entity. Compared to 
Figure 1.  The DT milestone was developed as per the work of Qi et al. [60].

70  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
previous definitions of DT, this specific definition demonstrates a higher 
level of comprehensiveness. A DT is a technological system that leverages 
various tools, technologies, and  communication infrastructure (i.e., the 
internet) to collect data from tangible objects and replicate their digital 
representations. According to Madni et al. [68], the term DT refers to a 
digital portrayal of a system’s maintenance, performance, and health status 
information  continuously updated in real-time throughout  the system’s 
operational cycle. The definitions put forth by Lui et al. [66] and Madni et al. 
[68] center on the ability of DT to progress over time through the acquisition 
of updated information from the physical asset, which is then utilized to 
monitor the performance of the said asset. The definitions above are highly 
comprehensive and pertinent to the construction sector, as they relate to 
applying DT for proactive maintenance and ongoing monitoring within this 
specific field. A DT offers reliable models based on the quantity of collected 
data and presents a real-time depiction of the condition of the tangible entity.
4.3  Key Features
The development of DT has led to the creation of new platforms and routes 
that allow the execution of functionalities and services in the simplest 
way possible. One of the most innovative digital platforms that makes 
digital/virtual twins of physical assets has been named DT [69]. The DT 
functions facilitate system data evaluation and tracking through the interaction 
of the physical and digital realms.6 The virtual model can seamlessly interact 
with the physical entity using effective communication platforms and rapid 
updates. As per the source, IoT has been recognized as a viable communication 
platform facilitated by sensors, cloud computing, and big data analytics [66]. 
The primary mechanism that underlies the functionality of DT is the 
communication of information and data from one endpoint to the other. During 
the asset’s entire life cycle, information is continuously exchanged between 
a tangible and intangible assets [1, 86]. Through the iterative adaptation to 
operational modifications utilizing information and online data acquisition, 
a DT can emulate a physical asset by offering future prognostications. By 
anticipating necessary maintenance actions for a physical asset, maintenance 
strategies can transition from a reactive approach to a predictive one.
The linkage or interaction between the physical and virtual products of 
a DT, which necessitates the use of analytics at every stage, holds significant 
6	 https://www.gavstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Digital Twin Concept.pdf.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  71
importance. Madni and colleagues (2018) identified several features of 
Decision Trees, as outlined in their study [68].
	 •	 A DT represents the distinct instance, performance, maintenance, repair 
history, health status, and other attributes of a physical structure.
	 •	 Preventive maintenance schedules are established based on the historical 
data of the physical structure.
	 •	 It makes use of the virtual model, to track, comprehend, and forecast 
future performance and maintenance patterns for physical assets. 
	 •	 Developers and facility managers can keep an eye on the system’s 
performance and potentially make adjustments to bring it in line with 
expectations. 
	 •	 Using the interconnectivity facilitated by digital threads, monitoring the 
various phases comprising the life cycle of tangible assets becomes 
feasible.
	 •	 Predictive analytics can be employed to forecast system performance 
in the future by refining assumptions based on data collected from the 
physical structure.
	 •	 By troubleshooting broken remote equipment, it may be possible to 
perform remote maintenance.
	 •	 Integrating data obtained from the Internet of Things and data derived 
from physical assets is leveraged to enhance and streamline services and 
operational processes.
	 •	 The duration of the physical system’s existence can be represented 
through a discrete-time model that emulates operational and maintenance 
information.
4.4  System Architecture
A thorough understanding of the dynamics necessary for DT functionality 
is crucial in order to address the system architecture. Engineering data, such 
as CAD files, product specifications, geometry models, material properties, 
validation results, IoT sensor readings, and simulation results, all play a role 
in the dynamics that determine the DT system’s architecture [79]. Selecting an 
appropriate model for creating a Decision Tree is contingent upon its intended 
application. Effective system implementation  will significantly influence 
the physical infrastructure’s  design, construction, and operation  over its 
entire lifespan. According to the literature, the three primary constituents of 
DT are the tangible system, the intangible system, and the interconnecting 
communication channel [40]. The constituents of DT are comprised of 
various technological advancements that facilitate its implementation, 

72  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
including but not limited to mobile devices, cyber-physical systems, sensors, 
and communication networks. Cyber-physical systems facilitate the smooth 
integration of virtual and physical models [3, 4, 5]. To replicate the actions 
of a tangible entity through a digital representation, and offer appropriate 
remedies when necessary, sensors are affixed to the human structure [22]. 
The information produced by the interconnected sensors is transmitted to the 
cloud through the IoT. Furthermore, it is synchronized with the virtual system 
to ensure that the latest data regarding the physical system is available.
DT leverages the benefits of the IoT to streamline the transmission of 
information from rudimentary sensory data to sophisticated insights [66]. AI, 
machine learning, and simulation prowess are all must-haves for this method. 
Real-time updation of the virtual model is enabled by processing data and 
information obtained from the attached sensors. Therefore, a  fundamental 
requirement for this procedure is  high  proficiency in simulation, machine 
learning, and AI. The ability to update the virtual model in real time  is 
facilitated by  processing  data and information collected by the attached 
sensors. To establish a seamless communication pathway between the two 
domains, the DT above  attributes entail extracting  information from the 
tangible infrastructure and harmonizing archival and current data [100].
Data (such as structures, external data, and blueprint data), reasoning 
(such as AI/ML models or unpredictable rules), key performance indicators 
(such as efficiency, emissions, NORI, and safety indicators), and context 
(such as occupant behavior, system/device behavior, and workflows) are the 
four fundamental components of a DT identified by Castaldini (29). These 
elements are crucial for the successful implementation of a DT. The four 
fundamental components play a decisive role in shaping the system architecture 
and functionality of a DT. Tao and colleagues [100] have expanded upon the 
four fundamental components by categorizing them into six distinct domains. 
These areas include data measurement, interaction with the virtual product, 
behavior  simulation, behavior control, data analysis, data integration, and 
visualization; virtual products; and behavior simulation.
As per the findings of the 2022 Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) 
Webinar report, the worldwide construction industry is projected to experience 
a growth of $8 trillion by the year 2030, primarily propelled by China, the 
United States, and India.7 As per the Global Construction 2030 report findings, 
it is anticipated that China, the United States, and India will spearhead global 
growth and contribute to 57% of the overall expansion. The report further 
forecasts that the worldwide construction output will surge 85% and reach 
7	 https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/8-emerging-construction-technology-trends/

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  73
$15.5 trillion by 2030. Cutting-edge technologies and construction software 
will be utilized throughout all phases of the construction process, including 
project planning, on-site work, and complementary stages. Advanced 
technologies and construction software will be employed throughout the 
project’s various stages, including project planning, on-site work, and 
complementary phases.
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have been major 
innovations in recent construction technology, offering visualizations. 
The incorporation of VR and AR is anticipated to significantly impact the 
projected $8 trillion global growth of the industry by 2030. The potential for 
AR/VR technology to be utilized in remote site inspections has been noted 
to significantly reduce construction costs by up to 90% when implemented 
in 2022. Additionally, it promotes teamwork, communication, and safety for 
AEC employees.
4.4.1  Drones
Over a decade ago, drones were first used in construction. Commencing 2023 
and beyond, we can anticipate the emergence of more sophisticated drones 
with a focus on AI. Using drones with 3D LIDAR scans and real-time aerial 
imagery is revolutionising the construction industry.
4.4.2  Blockchain Technology
In  2023 and beyond,  Blockchain Technology is expected to enhance cost 
management and facilitate efficient procurement strategies throughout 
the  (AEC) industry. Incorporating  a technological innovation (comprising 
interconnected data blocks forming a digital ledger that encompasses all 
transactional and milestone records), into the construction sector is a relatively 
recent development, having occurred within the last decade. The analogy can 
be drawn between a physical chain and a project’s transactions, where each 
link represents a particular transaction, and the system inherently maintains 
equilibrium. Unlike other alternatives, this  option is characterized by its 
security, decentralization, and flexibility, allowing it to adapt to projects of 
varying scales.
4.4.3  DT
The implementation of DT represents the latest technological advancement 
in the AEC sector, aimed at resolving operational management challenges. 
The process entails using simulation techniques to generate a prototype of 
a building. The DT trends and functionality domain pertains to intelligent 
multidimensional digital models. In the upcoming years,  the number of 

74  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
buildings experiencing operational issues is expected to decrease. This can 
be attributed to the use of  DTs, which can  simulate, predict, and provide 
informed decisions based on  environmental circumstances. Designers 
and technicians conduct a performance analysis that considers  occupants’ 
behavior through patterns and spatial considerations.
4.4.4  3D Laser Scanner
The DT technology is a recent development in the AEC industry, focusing on 
managing operational issues. Simulation is utilised as a means of constructing 
a building prototype. DT’s development and utility depend  on the use of 
sophisticated multi-dimensional digital models. The utilisation of Decision 
Trees is expected to result in a decrease in operational challenges encountered 
by buildings beyond the year 2023. This is due to their capacity to imitate, 
forecast, and aid in decision-making based on actual situations. Designers and 
technicians utilise patterns and spatial considerations to conduct performance 
analysis and  factor in occupant behavior. The technology in question was 
exemplified through the utilisation of Aiguilles-Queyras Hospital Center,8 
a medical facility in the French Alps. The 3D laser scanner manufactured 
by FARO9 comprehensively scans the entire pre-existing hospital structure, 
thereby generating a novel model to facilitate the renovation process.
4.4.5  4D Simulation
Using 4D simulations is a contemporary technological approach, that aims to 
minimize expenses and time associated with onsite and offsite projects. This is 
a significant consideration, given the construction industry’s persistent pursuit 
of efficiency. The Bentley pipeline project10 for the Haweswater Aqueduct 
utilized 4D simulation, which allowed Mott MacDonald to save 20 days.
4.4.6  3D Printing
While less  prevalent than BIM, 3D printing represents one of the latest 
technological advancements in the construction industry. In 1995, a 
mechanism was introduced to generate  three-dimensional structures from 
digital models. The utilization of 3D software to produce 3D models has gained 
significant popularity in 2023. The utilization of 3D printing technology by 
the engineers at Arup facilitated the fabrication of steel nodes for a structure

that is distinguished by its lightweight properties.11 Furthermore, Win Sun 
Decoration Design Engineering,12 a Shanghai-based corporation utilized 3D 
printing technology to administer a blend of rapidly solidifying cement and 
repurposed constituents in a spreadable format.
5. Structured DT System Design
As per the academic discourse, a city represents a complex network of 
interrelated social, economic, and physical components [67]. Information and 
Communication Technology infrastructure in urban areas, facilitates the 
interconnection of diverse asset groups and the derivation of insights from 
multiple data sets, as noted in reference [93]. Consequently, an urban local 
body (ULB) may be regarded as a valuable entity that amalgamates diverse 
constituent assets, comprising edifices, amenities, transportation systems, 
and populace. Thus, a city-level DT refers to an interactive digital model 
of a city that integrates all its sub-DTs. Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical 
parent-child relationship among DTs across multiple levels. To  ensure the 
confidentiality of data within each  data terminal, higher-level DTs (such 
as those at the city level) engage in bidirectional communication with 
lower-level sub-DTs (such as those at the building level). This communication 
involves requesting necessary data, addressing stakeholder requests, and 
providing tailored services.
In this chapter, a hierarchical architecture is shown for both the city and 
the building levels. The following sections comprise the processes of obtaining 
data, transmitting it, creating digital models, integrating data and models, and 
implementing service layers.

Figure 2.  DT links and order between the different levels.

76  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
5.1  Data Acquisition Layer
Each DT is made up of a layer for getting data. Because there are so 
many kinds of data and so much of it at the city level, it is essential and hard 
to design a way to get data. This holds regardless of the data’s nature, origin, 
structure, or content. Also, the subsets, like buildings and transportation 
systems, will have  sub-DTs based on their daily operations roles. The 
sub-DTs can provide the city DT with requested data, information, or models. 
Various techniques are utilized for data collection, including but not limited 
to radio-frequency identification (RFID), image-based methods, distributed 
sensor systems, wireless communication, and mobile access (e.g., in Wi-Fi 
environments). Each twin uses  the DT architecture  based on different 
sub-DT levels, such as buildings, with real-time data collection, efficient data 
management, and integration [35, 51]. Figure 3 shows a close-up of the DT 
architecture used for buildings. Building DTs have the same architecture as 
city DTs, with a data acquisition layer, transmission layer, digital modeling 
layer, data/model integration layer (with a simulation engine and data analysis 
functions), and service layer (with space use and workplace design).
Figure 3.  City and building DT system architecture.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  77
5.2  Transmission Layer
The data collection and processing layers rely on the transmission layer to 
deliver the information to the next level for processing. In this layer, different 
kinds of communication technologies could be used, such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, 
near-field communication (NFC), mobile-to-mobile (M2M), and Zwave, as 
well as 3G, 4G, long-term evolution (LTE), 5G, and low-power wide-area 
networks (LP-WAN) [37, 52]. Despite the rapid development of competing 
technologies, Wi-Fi remains the most common and widely adopted WLAN 
solution. 
Despite being the most widely adopted technology, concerns regarding 
the security of Digital Technologies in developing urban areas utilizing 
Wi-Fi have rendered the unlicensed spectrum band problematic [42]. Light 
Fidelity (Li-Fi) and Low Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WAN) are two 
intriguing possibilities for developing distributed technologies (DTs) that 
require wide-area coverage both at the construction and city levels [58, 94]. 
This is particularly relevant when thinking about network efficiency and data 
transfer rate.
5.3  Digital Modeling Layer
The digital modeling layer comprises various digital representations of 
the physical asset, such as BIM and City Information Modeling (CIM), 
along with supplementary data that facilitates the upper layers, such as 
meteorological information and cultural contexts. BIM and CIM use similar 
ideas when discussing information models at the city level. They expand the 
ways that models, data, and methods like geographic information systems 
(GIS) can be used in city settings (like urban planning) to help people make 
decisions [38, 39]. In DTs, different models and types of models can be used 
for other goals. Real-time monitoring and control, an assets management 
model, a CIM for city and infrastructure planning, scenario modeling, and a 
decision support system are all excellent examples [21, 59]. To achieve unity 
with particular target applications, from singular infrastructures to complete 
edifices and municipalities, it is imperative to utilize a pre-established 
schema and systematic modeling procedures during the development of DT 
at construction and city scales [46]. The optimisation of city digital twins’ 
performance relies heavily on the efficient and hierarchical design of models, 
data storage, integration, and query systems. The significance of this matter is 
heightened when confronted with intricate and extensive data sets, requiring 
the implementation of city-level storage and administration systems of 
considerable magnitude. Utilising cloud computing, storage, and data/model 
visualization can  enhance data management  at both the city and building 
levels, promoting a dynamic and practical approach.

78  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
5.4  Data/Model Integration Layer
The primary constituent of this structure is the stratum that amalgamates the 
data and model. This layer aims to integrate all available data sources within 
the designated data architecture. The stratum in question encompasses the 
requisite instruments for operations such as data processing, storage, analysis, 
integration, and manipulation and AI-facilitated knowledge acquisition that 
assist’ decision-making [40]. As per the architectural framework, the actual 
state of building assets, including work orders, present maintenance data, and 
their respective statuses, alongside municipal assets, such as transportation 
conditions and energy usage, would be contemporaneously revised [64, 95].
5.5  Service Layer
The design is executed in the  service layer,  the uppermost tier of the DT 
architecture. To facilitate communication between people, communities, and 
the data/model integration layer, the system processes data from Knowledge 
Engines (KE). The service layer gives societal services and checks how 
well-built DTs work. This changes how happy people are with things like 
smart transportation, building sustainable communities, and taking care of the 
environment. Moreover, to enhance overall satisfaction, knowledge engineers 
(KEs) ought to integrate user feedback as an external source of knowledge.
6.  Strengths of DT in Construction
In the real estate field, using  DTs can facilitate a thorough assessment of 
the physical attributes of a property, enabling brokers or owners to gather 
and scrutinize relevant information about the asset’s state and effectiveness. 
Therefore, the use of DTs in the construction and real estate industries has the 
potential to achieve previously un-imagined levels of efficiency in these areas 
(as well as time, expense, sustainability, and safety). As such, it is deemed a 
critical tool for the entire building sector.
6.1  Automate Project Control
Digital technologies can  provide instantaneous feedback on the condition 
and efficacy of construction projects, thereby facilitating monitoring of their 
advancement. Sensor, drone, laser scanner, and monitoring system data can 
all be integrated into a virtual model [8]. Artificial Intelligence-enabled DT 
solutions can efficiently handle, evaluate, and exhibit the combined data in the 
form of an as-is-built model. Additionally, these solutions can provide hourly 
or daily comparisons to the baseline model. Monitoring and identifying any 
potential variances in budget or schedule during a construction project would 

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  79
aid project teams to devise and execute appropriate corrective measures, 
ultimately leading to the resolution of typical construction progress challenges.
6.2  Resource Planning and Logistics
The construction industry may generate significant waste due to the extra 
handling and transportation of supplies, tools, and labor. The implementation 
of DT solutions has the potential to enable a lean methodology in 
managing  resources, thereby contributing to the reduction of wastage. 
The alternatives mentioned above  can  provide immediate supervision 
over-allocating  resources and  handling  waste, thereby augmenting the 
efficiency and efficacy of the construction procedure. One instance of utilizing 
digital technologies in monitoring construction project advancement is the 
amalgamation of sensory information derived from construction equipment 
and vehicles. This approach enables the acquisition of instantaneous 
information regarding the location and utilization of assets, thereby facilitating 
the identification of possible obstructions or inadequacies. The benefits of 
decision trees is that they have the potential to assist the construction industry 
in mitigating resource depletion and improving time allocation, as evidenced 
by sources [6, 87, 109].
6.3  Construction Safety
The safety performance exhibited by the construction sector is below the 
optimal level. Integrating  AI with cameras, sensors, and mobile devices 
through DTs technology provides a comprehensive safety framework for the 
construction sector.13 DTs provide a real-time capability for site reconstruction, 
which the construction sector can utilise  to facilitate the monitoring and 
tracking of the construction process. This characteristic can assist in detecting 
and resolving any discrepancies or variations from the established protocol 
that pose a safety risk [50]. This data makes it possible to avert the use of 
hazardous substances and involvement in risky undertakings within specified 
regions. Furthermore, the management can establish a mechanism for timely 
notifications that notifies them when an employee is at risk and transmits a 
signal to the employee’s wearable gadget. Moreover, Decision Trees have the 
potential to detect hazardous actions and provide customized instruction to 
workers in simulated settings, obviating the necessity for costly and protracted 
on-site training and ultimately reducing the likelihood of mishaps [50].

80  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
6.4  Quality Assurance
DT solutions can help improve quality assurance in construction by giving 
real-time information about how the different parts and systems used in the 
project are working and how they are behaving. DT technology employs image 
processing algorithms to assess the condition of different components and 
materials on a construction site by analyzing photographic or video imagery. 
Concrete condition assessment and crack detection in columns and other 
structures are among the potential applications of this technique. This can 
aid in identifying future issues or deficiencies and implementing corrective 
measures to ensure the quality of the construction procedure.
6.5  Assessing Building Performance
DT solutions can  measure how well a building works, by simulating its 
behavior and performance under different conditions and scenarios. The 
objective of integrating data from various sources, including sensors, 
simulations, and BIM models, can be achieved through implementation. For 
example, DTs can facilitate the assessment of a building’s energy efficiency 
by simulating energy generation and consumption. In addition, this approach 
enables the evaluation of the effects of various design and operational 
strategies on the building’s energy performance. By optimising air, heat, and 
humidity circulation and evaluating the impacts of diverse design and control 
approaches, buildings can be assessed for their indoor environmental quality 
and comfort levels [50].
6.6  Anomaly Detection in Pumps
As part of the proposed DT architecture, the current service can detect spikes in 
vibration data that herald the onset of abnormal faults on Heating, Ventilation, 
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) pumps. To do this, we analyze vibration 
data that can be used as diagnostic indicators of the pumps’ underlying 
mechanical health. Additional information about the shape and placement 
of buildings is available through BIM. In contrast, Building  Management 
Systems (BMS) and live sensors primarily oversee the operational state of 
critical assets. The integration layer of data and model facilitates the astute 
extraction of data about pumps, which is made possible by implementing the 
Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema during the demonstration. The 
Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts, a prevalent method for detecting change 
points, are employed to examine the extracted pump data and see instances 
where the fundamental vibration symptom parameters diverge from their 
anticipated values.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  81
6.7  Maintenance/Repair Prioritization
The allocation of resources is contingent to the prioritisation of maintenance 
tasks. As per Mobley’s estimates [71], it can be inferred that a mere 
one-third of maintenance expenses are utilized efficiently. The present 
application uses a developed Decision Tree and leverages advancements in 
mobile communications, social networking, and machine learning to tackle the 
aforementioned municipal limitations. Furthermore, the provision of assets on 
the Internet is facilitated through the utilisation of asset tags and a digital asset 
profile. Individuals who utilise assets, can scan corresponding labels using a 
mobile application. This action enables viewing of digital profiles and the 
ability to append comments detailing any issues or problems encountered.14 
The proposed approach utilises a machine learning algorithm, operationalized 
by integrating data and model layers, to deduce the significance of individual 
asset defects. The feedback obtained from this process is subsequently 
employed as the input for the algorithm.
6.8  Green Urban Energy Planning
Urban energy planning has advanced beyond providing basic human needs 
and meeting societal expectations. It has now established a comprehensive 
approach to tackle ecological and energy-related concerns on an urban 
level, with the ultimate goal of achieving reduced carbon intensity. This 
particular application demonstrates the successful integration of sensing and 
computation capabilities within building DT. The integration is achieved 
through the utilisation of sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory 
(LSTM) technology, which approximates the characteristics of building 
energy demand patterns. By utilising this data, it is possible to determine the 
future requirements for the capacity and energy output of the energy supply 
infrastructure within the urban development framework. This objective’s 
attainment can be facilitated by acquiring quantitative data on energy demand 
and the spatial distribution of the projected energy. Integrating an appropriate 
quantity of renewable energy sources can lead to an improved energy 
consumption pattern in urban areas.
7.  Limitations of DT in Construction
Certain construction firms may encounter persistent challenges within the 
industry that must be surmounted before successfully implementing digital 
technologies. This section will address the primary challenges that require 
attention when implementing Decision Trees in the construction industry.
14	https://itemit.com/

82  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
7.1  Lack of Contractual Awareness
Comprehending the intricacies of a contract constitutes a fundamental element 
of every construction undertaking, and the integration of novel technologies, 
such as DTs, can substantially alter the process. The utilization of Design 
Teams can serve as a means to ensure that contractual obligations about a 
building project are comprehended and adhered to by all parties involved. 
This is achieved by monitoring the project’s scope and the client’s primary 
objectives.
7.2  Lack of Data Understanding
Numerous construction firms need help  utilising data efficiently due to 
inadequate tools for acquiring insights, disparate data management systems 
between information technology and operational technology, and limited 
access to real-time data or data within time constraints. One of the advantages 
of Matterport is its ability to integrate with various data streams seamlessly.
7.3  The Move to BIM
Numerous construction companies  rely on 2D design technology for 
significant construction projects. Implementing a BIM model, connected to 
a virtual design and construction process necessitates using  advanced 3D 
modeling technology and acquiring novel skill sets within an organization.
7.4  No Structure or Defined SOPs
The advent of DTs poses an additional obstacle for stakeholders, as specific 
construction projects may need to  possess established protocols for data 
exchange and issue resolution. Decision Trees guarantee uniformity among all 
stakeholders involved in a project’s lifespan, including contractors, inspectors, 
and clients, by establishing a unified and reliable information source.
8.  Data Management Perspective on DT Development
The success of a DT at the city and building levels is contingent upon 
resolving four significant data management issues, as identified by the pilot. 
This is because a DT is fundamentally constructed upon data.
8.1  Data Integration
The process of identifying a data trustee presents several challenges in the 
realm of data management, particularly in the consolidation of data from 
disparate sources that are geographically dispersed and exhibit diversity. 
Using the provided DT, we can see how different data sources, such as 

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  83
real-time sensors, BMS, Cloud Services, and AMS, can be integrated to 
create a comprehensive picture. Various technological solutions are available 
to enable data integration from a technical standpoint. The technologies in 
question encompass a range of mechanisms, including extract, transform, 
and load (ETL), which facilitate data transfer  between systems and 
service-oriented architectures that can  expose data as a service [25]. 
Data virtualization, warehouses, and lakes [19] can also aid integration. 
However, in the context of organisational integration, employing a blend of 
various technologies as the only solution is often insufficient in addressing 
all issues [12]. Therefore, the primary obstacle in the development of DT 
lies in integrating  diverse data sources and establishing  connections with 
supplementary assets.
The utilization of big data is of paramount importance in  digital 
transformations, characterized by their significant volume, velocity, and variety. 
Many DT functions would be unfeasible to execute without big data. The 
Semantic ETL workflow [16] represents a viable solution for data integration 
in  digital transformation. The methodology above  can be investigated to 
assimilate substantial amounts of data from various origins into a unified data 
structure, enabling quick data retrieval and bolstering innovative applications. 
During the transform phase of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, 
semantic technologies are utilised to establish a semantic data model and 
generate semantically linked data in the format of Resource Description 
Framework (RDF) triples. Subsequently, the triples above are retained within 
a repository of organized data, commonly called  a data warehouse. The 
conventional approach is commonly utilised during the extraction and loading 
phases of the ETL process.
8.2  Diverse Source Data Systems 
The fundamental data required for tracking and prediction algorithms 
are stored in source systems,  typically distributed systems operating  on 
various software platforms and database systems. The optimal performance 
of queries to extract data from these systems presents a formidable obstacle. 
Implementing a NoSQL engine within DynamoDB is appropriate for executing 
general parallel data queries, amidst a substantial influx of concurrent 
requests and storing data vastly. The significance of current and punctual data 
is particularly crucial within the framework of DTs. In certain circumstances, 
acquiring a consistent stream of real-time data, such as telemetry data, may 
be imperative under extraordinary conditions. Furthermore, urban downtown 
areas must retrieve data from their subordinate downtown areas.
The structure of data models often varies across systems due to the 
diverse storage options available to database designers for the same data type. 

84  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
The manifestation of data is represented through different database tables, 
individual records, and the selection of specific attributes. Determining the 
originality of a data record about a specific machine in one system compared 
to another in a different approach presents a significant obstacle in the absence 
of a universally accepted standard or a globally unique identifier (GUID) for 
data records across diverse data sources. As a result, several terminologies, 
including entity linking, record linkage, entity resolution, data matching, and 
data duplication, are utilized in diverse systems [98]. 
An additional challenge involves the task of reconciling discrepancies 
in both the meaning and structure of the information. As an illustration, the 
classification of external pipework as part of a boiler may be encompassed 
by one reference while being excluded by another. The field of Master Data 
Management (MDM) provides solutions to the issues above by guiding on 
establishing consensus on data definitions and regulating its evolution 
and modification over time [76, 77]. Thus, to  maintain uniformity in the 
terminology, it becomes imperative to harmonize the discrepancies in distinct 
parameters within databases. For instance, diverse measurement systems may 
be utilized, such as Celsius or Fahrenheit.
8.3  Data Synchronization
The data synchronisation process  is not explicitly referenced within the 
preceding section of the demonstrator. The integration of data and models 
in the respective layer was primarily carried out through manual offline 
means. The synchronisation of multiple data copies is a crucial aspect 
of implementing a practical DT, as it determines the optimal timing and 
frequency required to provide the decision-makers with the most up-to-date 
information. The matter at hand is intricate, as it involves a trade-off between 
synchronisation expenses and the quality of data, which may suffer from 
staleness [82]. The costs incurred from utilizing resources such as computing 
facilities and personnel in the ITechnology field are encompassed within the 
ambit of synchronisation costs. The act of locking [104] systems to access data 
and the potential reduction in computing power can result in a considerable 
disruption cost to businesses. This is because any decrease in computer power 
can limit the energy available for essential business operations [82]. These 
factors highlight the potential impact of computing resources on business 
operations.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  85
8.4  Data Quality
As per the assertion made by Wang and Strong [103], the concept of data 
quality can be defined as “fitness for use,” which considers the data’s intended 
use and adherence to the specified requirements. The utilisation of data in 
Decision Trees must support the concurrent facilitation of various applications, 
including but not limited to service decision-making and predictive analysis. 
Therefore, the  information stored in a Decision Tree has the potential to 
degrade, rendering it unsuitable for use due to various factors.
Utilising this approach for acquiring data from source systems may result 
in a potential compromise of data quality. If the query for data extraction is 
formulated erroneously, inaccurate records may be procured. During semantic 
processing, incorrect data transformations may result in data loss. In the event 
of a flawless data extraction process, any errors in the source systems› data 
will still be transmitted to the data warehouse. Specific errors, such as invalid 
or improperly formatted data, can be identified and rectified during the 
transformation process [105]. Data technicians can utilize publicly available 
online data at the municipal level, such as meteorological predictions. The 
utilisation of online data may necessitate a distinct comprehension of data 
quality compared to conventional database systems, as the former may possess 
questionable quality [67].
9.  BIM vs DT
BIM and DT technology are designed to enhance process transparency, 
cooperation, and efficiency. Nevertheless, these two technologies exhibit 
notable distinctions.15
15	https://www.indovance.com/knowledge-center/building-information-modeling-bim-vs-digital-
twins/

86  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
9.1  Definition
	 •	 BIM - BIM is a methodology that entails generating and managing digital 
representations of the aesthetic and functional characteristics of locations.
	 •	 DT - A digital representation of physical assets, processes, and systems, 
as well as their dynamics, is what is meant when someone refers to 
something as having a “Digital Twin.”
9.2  Function
	 •	 BIM - During the design and construction phases of a project, BIM is 
intended to serve not only as a digital database but also as a tool that 
makes collaboration and visualization more accessible.
	 •	 DT - The purpose of DTs is to assist with the management and upkeep of 
the building.
10.  Case Study
The Shanghai East Hospital, also known as the East Hospital, is a highly 
regarded general hospital in the Lujiazui commercial district of Shanghai, 
situated in the eastern region of China [81]. The rating received is of the 
highest academic caliber, an A-grade. Tongji University is the affiliated 
institution of the hospital. 
The recently erected Case Building is a comprehensive hub for medical 
care, education, scientific inquiry, emergency response, preventative measures, 
and healthcare services. Unlike previous clinical facilities, the  new tower 
emphasizes necessary public medical safety measures and advanced medical 
care services. The building consists  of 26 levels, with 24 levels situated 
above ground and two underground. It provides sleeping arrangements for 
500 individuals and covers a significant built-up area of around 83000 square 
meters [81]. 
Before  the erection of the novel clinical tower, the mechanical and 
electrical apparatus at East Hospital consisted of complex operating systems 
that functioned autonomously. These systems comprise medical procedures, 
including gas, sewage treatment, and medical equipment. The insufficient 
operational and maintenance efficacy at East Hospital can be attributed to the 
demand for increased efficiency among middle and upper-level management 
personnel.
Furthermore, the hospital infrastructure requires continuous operation 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. As a result, the department responsible 
for O&M management will encounter considerable pressure. Furthermore, 
traditional approaches to manual bookkeeping administration have become 

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  87
obsolete and non-intuitive, owing to the challenge of overseeing and 
scrutinising voluminous datasets from diverse origins.
The case study utilized the “continuous lifecycle integration method” 
as its main technical innovation. The approach entails the execution 
of a comprehensive timetable that enables the systematic and punctual 
incorporation of pertinent material across the complete duration. Typically, 
construction endeavors encompass a range of activities, including AEC, as 
well as Operation and Maintenance (O&M) tasks, which are integrated into 
their timeline. Thus, the complete life cycle may be partitioned into various 
stages, encompassing, though not restricted to, the design, construction, and 
operation and maintenance phases. 
The Operations and Maintenance phase is a crucial stage in a building’s 
lifecycle, given its substantial allocation of budget and lifetime costs. The 
domains of O&M and AEC are intrinsically linked. In the design phase, basic 
static information is determined, encompassing geometry, facility-related 
data, spatial partitioning, and electrical system logic, among other factors. 
During construction, intelligent hardware devices are installed or maintained 
to gather dynamic operational data. 
Figure 4 illustrates the fundamental steps in developing a Decision Tree 
for the hospital framework. The procedure begins with a physical healthcare 
establishment and concludes with creating a comprehensive decision-making 
framework. The first phase of the process entailed the conversion of the 
hospital into a digital format through the utilisation of geometry modeling 
techniques. The geometry modeling process mainly entailed utilizing CAD 
drawings in the design phase. The utilization of the 3D point cloud method, 
which involves laser scanning or photogrammetry, has been explored in cases 
that involve complex mechanical areas. This was recorded and cited in the 
reference identified as [96]. Incorporating  the BIM modeling process was 
a crucial milestone. As contact [102] indicates, it is commonly imperative 
to segregate dynamically generated information from static ontology data 
to uphold inherent data security and employ suitable storage strategies.
Consequently, an initial BIM was constructed by incorporating stationary 
models and ontology data. Using business systems and sensor devices, 
a dynamic BIM or digital shadow has been generated through process 
monitoring. The integration of analysis engines equipped with preexisting 
knowledge and AI models should be implemented immediately following the 
monitoring of incoming data. The on-site investigation played a crucial role in 
establishing a connection between the object mapping process and the actual 
hospital environment. It is imperative that accurate object mapping is utilized 
to transmit functional modules and diagnostic recommendations to a physical 
hospital facility.

88  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
The fundamental concept underlying the design of the DT schema was 
the strategic execution of appropriate actions at the appropriate moments. 
From the onset of the design phase, it is imperative to integrate all contents, 
including static data, dynamic information, and potential diagnosis models 
from relevant stakeholders, in a timely manner throughout the various stages 
of the lifecycle.
11.  Discussion
The DT has emerged as a powerful tool that has gained considerable traction 
across various industry sectors, garnering attention from scholars and 
corporations both domestically and internationally. The term above pertains 
to the electronic representation of a physical asset and its diverse instances, 
employing current information. At the outset, digital transformation requires 
the creation of virtual models of tangible assets, which are subsequently 
linked to their physical counterparts through  sensors, intelligent devices 
(e.g.,  controllers and actuators), digital platforms, and communication 
networks. The sensors gather data from the tangible constituents and 
convey it to the digital medium via networks. The effectiveness and 
functional abilities of DT models rely on the amount and caliber of data 
and information accumulated over time regarding the physical asset. As per 
Buddoo’s statement [84], automating  the decision-making process for the 
DT of the physical system requires a pragmatic analysis of the collected 
data and information. The capability to provide real-time updates and virtual 
Figure 4.  Main steps from reality to DT.

A Study on Health Monitoring of the Structures through Digital Twin  89
control of physical components is exclusively determined by data analytics. 
Unfortunately, utilising  DT functionalities is more prevalent in industries 
other than the construction sector. 
DT’s adaptability is considered  a critical factor in its widespread 
applicability and progress across diverse industries. According to Tao et al. 
[99], DT is currently providing benefits to the manufacturing sector, such as 
closed-loop manufacturing, optimization of product design, and intelligent 
maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) processes. The manufacturing 
industry has adopted DT technology in four primary domains: DT-based product 
design, intelligent manufacturing in DT-enabled factories, product DT for 
usage monitoring, and DT as a facilitator for smart maintenance, repair, and 
overhaul (MRO) operations. The integration of DT applications within the 
manufacturing industry enables the identification and resolution of production 
bottlenecks while ensuring that final products meet user specifications with 
minimal resource and time wastage. 
The construction sector has transitioned from traditional building design 
and construction techniques to integrating mechanical structures, commonly 
called smart buildings, which are furnished with many intelligent devices. The 
incorporation of smart devices aims to augment buildings’ operational efficacy 
and ensure maximum user satisfaction. Numerous attempts have been made to 
implement DT technology in the construction sector. These efforts encompass 
diverse applications, such as monitoring the progress of construction activities 
[23] and generating a digital bridge model using a geometrical framework for 
DT implementation [24]. These software programs present potential benefits 
for enhancing DT applications in the construction sector and gaining a deeper 
understanding of their importance. 
Digital technology presents potential advantages in the construction sector 
by enabling the assessment of a design’s viability before its implementation. 
According to Siemens,16 the early verification and validation of initial design 
choices is a crucial aspect of planning and coordinating multi-disciplinary 
solutions to enhance building performance. This process is considered an 
indispensable tool in achieving this objective. The potential advantages of 
utilising Design Thinking during the design phase are extensive and can 
have a positive impact throughout the entire lifecycle of a project or product. 
Real-time monitoring of construction projects enables the evaluation of 
compliance with established design standards. DT solutions have the potential 
to be implemented in post-construction scenarios to monitor  building 
performance and facilitate virtual bi-directional coordination.

12.  Conclusion
The scientific concept of “Digital Twin” (DT) provides significant advantages 
and flexibility to physical objects/systems and their digital counterparts within 
the Industry 4.0 environment. Digital twin technologies in the construction 
industry enable the accumulation of data about an asset and its constituent 
parts, thereby facilitating the acquisition of pertinent insights into the 
support and its components over some time. This technology can reduce the 
monitoring and regulation of assets, as well as the optimisation of processes, 
throughout  their operational lifespan. DT technology plays a crucial role 
in constructing facilities by predicting  a facility’s life cycle performance 
and generating economic value by optimizing  potential future scenarios. 
Predicting  the lifecycle enables adopting  a Condition-Based Maintenance 
(CBM) program, which utilises up-to-date information to effectively allocate 
and enhance maintenance resources. Despite the widespread adoption of 
DT in various industries, such as construction, its full potential still needs 
to be realized. The present study offers a valuable overview for scholars and 
professionals regarding the current status of Digital Transformation across 
diverse sectors, with a particular emphasis on the construction industry. 
The construction industry has been able to  adopt DT more 
easily through cutting-edge technologies like BIM, point cloud segmentation, 
augmented reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, and 
sensors. Given the complexities of the construction industry, it is essential 
to implement DT applications to address current issues. Before beginning 
construction, conducting a design feasibility analysis with the help of DT 
technology can save time and money. When incorporated during the planning 
phase, it allows for  tracking progress and identifying  deviances from 
predetermined plans. To keep tabs on how well a building’s many systems 
and appliances function, DT must be put into place wherever operations 
and maintenance are conducted. By providing real-time access to digital 
models of facilities, facilities managers can improve decision-making and 
the building’s performance through bidirectional coordination based on 
up-to-date information. Thus, DT can be helpful when planning for the 
construction as well as during the execution, maintenance and monitoring of 
the structures.

Smart Agricultural Platform to 
Increase the Human Life Span 
Using Blockchain Technique

1.  Introduction
Different economic areas of the country, including health care, farming, and 
business, were drawn to the advancement of technology in order to grow their 
enterprises and increase their profits. By utilising the sensing capabilities of 
IoT sensors, the advent of IoT in the agricultural industry provides a plethora 
of farming programs, like soil surveillance, crop value evaluation as well as 
water supply for cultivation. Similarly, population growth and environmental 
issues like shortages of water, changes in the climate, and warming oceans 
have an impact on crop output as a whole [1]. According to a study from the 
UN, the world’s total population has increased by 2 billion people in the last 
30 years. In 2050, it will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.7 billion, in accordance with 
their research [2]. As a result, there are now significant concerns about how to 
meet the rising food demand due to population growth. Hence, there is now 
a real issue regarding how to meet the rising need for food due to population 
growth.
Farmers must boost agricultural output by increasing farmland or by 
utilising the inorganic way of farming in order to meet the growing demand 
for food. Overusing herbicides and fertilisers, however, lowers agricultural 
excellence and poses [3, 4] a risk to humanity. Also, eating unhealthy food

produced by non-organic farming has negative effects on the body, including 
nausea, vertigo, nervousness, constipation, and nausea, which shortens life 
expectancy. As a result, maximum residual limits for every pesticide utilised 
for crops have been set by various food regulatory authorities, including “the 
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)”, and “Committee 
on the Environment, and Public Health and Food Safety” [5]. Farmers 
nevertheless continue to use less expensive, off-patent pesticides like “lindane 
and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)”, which are difficult to remove 
from the soil as well as from water [6].
Ingenious solutions kept numerous researchers from addressing the 
aforementioned problems with smart technology in agriculture. For instance, 
Hassaan et al. [7] investigated the environmental impacts and pesticide toxicity 
parameters. They researched a number of methods for estimating how few 
pesticides are present in crops. Additionally, they talked about how pesticides 
can affect human beings through a variety of routes, including inhalation, 
skin contact, and ingestion. Edge computing as well as blockchain technology 
has recently drawn attention in part thanks to providing possibilities for data 
protection and storage [8]. Taking into account this context, the scientists of [8] 
proposed an information discovery technique that incorporates a hyper-ledger, 
which offers effectual storage volume and maintains food confidentiality. 
Additionally, the authors suggested [9] a small signing approach for the 
network of blockchain connections employing edge computing as well as a 
hash algorithm to address data efficiency difficulties in detecting crops [10]. 
The proposed system is contrasted with well-known digital form signatures. 
The efficiency of the short-form signature technique, which reduces the data 
storage reaction time, is demonstrated by their findings.
This method inspired us to develop a smart farming system based on 
blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) that effectively anticipates the abuse 
of insecticides in the crop as well as maximises the expectancy of human 
life. Initially, the collected crop records included environmental elements 
like hydrogen potential (pH) levels, temperature, and rainfall, agricultural 
characteristics including pesticides, pesticide threshold, crop and soil type. 
The dataset was then pre-processed by utilising normalisation approaches, 
missing values were filled in using centralised tendency measures as well as 
irrelevant features. The pre-processed dataset is further separated as testing 
and training datasets, with the training dataset being sent to several AI models 
for training, including Multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines 
(SVM), Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM), perceptrons, and Logistic 
Regression (LR). On the other side, the accuracy of the above-mentioned 
technique is verified using the tested dataset. To avoid manipulation in data 
assaults when invaders change the pesticide threshold in order to confuse 
regulatory agencies, the projected data must be protected. Because of this, 

Blockchain-Enhanced Smart Agriculture for Longevity  99
the proposed framework incorporates blockchain technology to store the 
forecasted data in the distributed blockchain ledger. Additionally, adopting 6G 
offers characteristics such as extremely low latency, high stability, ubiquitous 
high data rates as well as availability, which improves the performance of the 
proposed framework.
2.  Related Works
Numerous studies have been conducted in the agricultural field that aid in cost 
calculation, weed detection, and crop and pesticide prediction. The researcher 
employs several methods and uses algorithms that revolutionise the agriculture 
industry all over the world. To improve the quality and volume of the crop, 
they use contemporary information and communication techniques like 
“machine learning (ML)”, edge computing, “deep learning (DL)” as well as 
IoT. An improved agricultural production pest detection model, for instance, 
was presented by Jiao et al. [11]. They sought to address the low accuracy and 
efficiency problems in the conventional agriculture system. To do that, they 
used the pest dataset, which has 20 k photos as well as 24 classes, and the 
DL model. For the purpose of identifying agricultural pests, they presented 
the “anchor-free region convolutional neural network (AF-RCNN)” [12–13], 
“faster R-CNN”, and “you only look once (YOLO)” models. They haven’t, 
however, looked into how pests affect both the relevant crop and people. 
Then, for the detection of pests, Chen et al. [13] suggested “YOLOv3 and 
LSTM” [14–16]. They lessen crop loss and the harm that pesticide use causes 
to the environment. For crop recommendation, the author Priyadharshini et al. 
introduced the AI-based categorisation technique in [17]. They discovered the 
right soil characteristics, planting window, and geographic location to boost 
output and lower crop failure.
An AI-based technique that forecasts environmentally friendly crops 
based on the fertility of the soil was integrated by Nalwanga et al. [18]. 
They combined hardware “STM32F401CC and soil sensors” with software 
“STM32CubeIDE to monitor” the minerals in the soil while using the least 
amount of fertiliser. Then, Ref. [19] put forth a “crop yield prediction model 
based on artificial neural networks (ANN)”. They used pH sensors as well as 
moisture sensors to gather their findings. Their suggested technique discusses 
the sensor’s interfaced ANN network and produces effective outcomes. 
DL-based strategies were used by Jin et al. [20] to find the weeds in the crop. 
They suggested the CenterNet technique, which can recognise weeds and 
detect vegetables in a vegetable plantation. They also suggested SVM, Naive 
Bayes as well as KNN, classification algorithms in [21] along with a GPS and 
IoT module to prophecy soil quality as well as identify the kind and quantity 
of fertiliser and pesticides used in a crop. For the classification and detection 

100  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
of insects, Kasinathan et al. [22] introduced SVM, ANN, Naive Bayes, CNN 
as well as K-nearest neighbour (KNN), They examined the various classifiers 
and found CNN to be the most accurate and best-suited model.
KNN, random forest as well and SVM classifiers have recently been 
proposed by Sreedevi et al. [23] for the prediction of plant and crop diseases. 
The farmer can rent from them a tractor, a roller, a seed drill, a watering 
system as well as a harvester. Prior to the cultivation of crops, they suggest 
the crop grown, forecast plant diseases, and display the soil testing facilities. 
Additionally, Elakkiya et al. [24] reported AI-based methods for determining 
soil quality and disease-borne pathogens. In certain research studies, the 
authors place more emphasis on crop recommendations, weed identification, 
and insect and weed identification than they do on pesticides and their 
application in crops. Due to this, Durai et al. [25] proposed employing 
AI-based techniques to recommend crops and herbicides, and to identify 
weeds, and estimate costs. The use of CNN for pest classification was suggested 
by Setiawan et al. [26]. They categorise insect species to decide on the best 
preventive measures and lessen agricultural damage. The aforementioned 
research, however, did not take into account how pesticides affect both crops 
and people.
3. Methodology with Problem Formulation
Here, an outline of the methodology that predicts the optimal levels of 
pesticides to preserve human life expectancy. In the suggested system, we

Every pesticide has a predetermined threshold number known as pthr, 
which is the maximum amount of pesticide that can be used on a crop. To 
maximise human life expectancy, we used AI algorithms to forecast the 
pesticide threshold in crop output. As a criterion for human life expectancy, 
we took into account the pesticide threshold for safe human consumption as 
well. The following are the effects of pesticide use on human life expectancy.
 
For, p < pthr → ω = high 
(5)
 
p > pthr → ω = low 
(6)
where p is the number of pesticides (m) that were applied to the specific 
crop. pthr denotes the applicable pesticide’s threshold value, and designates 
the expectancy of the human life parameter. The crop value is sent to the 
blockchain layer along with the relevant pesticides in this instance.
On a frontier server that offers minimal computing complexity when 
analysing information training, the suggested system handles information 
collecting, pre-processing, splitting, as well as validation. After gathering 
the crop information, we used pre-processing methods such normalisation 
as well as outlier and duplicate removal. Users must manage vast amounts 
of data and carry out data analytics for pesticide as well as crop forecast as 
well as cost of production assessment in the agriculture sector. They need the 
data to be authenticated and safe for that. To ensure security, reliability, and 
dependability in smart agriculture, we suggested using a blockchain system 
based on IPFS. Additionally, it faces data tampering attempts that change 
the pesticide threshold value to evade food regulatory agencies. In order to 
analyse the human life expectancy depending on the appropriate pesticide 
p used on crops Crp, the system model illustrates the detrimental effects of 
pesticides on the human body. Pesticide use has a negative impact on the 
human body when it reaches the threshold limit, as was stated in Eq. (6). As a 
result, the following is an explanation of the human life expectancy problem.

In this study, we set out to increase human life expectancy while keeping 
in mind the use of pesticides in the pertinent crop. The predetermined threshold 
value that limits the application of pesticides in the crop is represented by 
constraint Crp1 in this case. Crp2 indicates if it is 0 or 1.

4. The Proposed Framework
The AI-based system of classification presented in this section aims to increase 
human life expectancy by anticipating the pesticide threshold of a given crop. 
Different AI algorithms, including LSTM, MLP, SVM, as well as LR, were 
taken into consideration for the calculation of that threshold. Five levels make 
up the suggested framework: the edge intelligence layer, the data layer, the 
application layer, the blockchain layer as well as the communication layer.
Data layer
We have a variety of crops Crpn in this stratum, including maize, rice, papaya, 
bananas, chickpeas, etc., in the farm fi. Based on the maximum limit for 
the relevant crop, the farmer utilises the insecticides (threshold value) fr. 
Typically, pesticides are used to eradicate plants and insects and increase the 
crop’s productivity and yield. However, improper application of pesticides 
compromises human health and damages the soil, water, and turf [27]. As a 
result, we emphasised in the data layer that the farmer ffr1 sprinkles pesticides 
pm using an aerial vehicle or a farmer manually sprays the pesticide into the 
crop using a pesticide fountain. 
 
∀Crpn → p1, p2,…pm,n ∈ 1,2,3,.. 
(10)
One comma-separated value (CSV) file contains the collected data from 
various farms fi. The CSV file is then sent on to the edge intelligence layer 
for additional processing that precisely forecasts the pesticide threshold in the 
crop to maximise human life expectancy.
Edge Intelligence Layer
Data collection, preliminary processing, and probability prediction need a lot 
of computing resources in conventional AI methods. This is due to the fact 
that the input data (dataset) must travel to the global machines/servers for 
the reason of prognosis and classification, which lowers the computational 
efficiency of AI models. As a result, the input data doesn’t depend on the 
global computers; rather, it is trained only on edge servers that have local AI 
training capabilities. This enhances the edge intelligence layer’s effectiveness 
in terms of speedier response times and lowers the computational burden 
associated with data training.
Crop gathering information from the data layer in CSV file format is the 
first stage in creating this layer. To estimate the lifespan of humans, we have 
gathered the Kaggle [28] dataset. To train the AI systems, the gathered data 
is insufficient. As a result, we gathered information from additional sources 
that included threshold values and insecticides pertinent to the crop. The final

dataset, D, shows how soil fertility is affected by temperature, humidity, and 
rainfall when different crop kinds are grown along with various pesticides 
and at their maximum permissible levels. The dataset consists of 12 columns  
(CL1, CL2,…CLk) and 900 rows (R1, R2,…Rq).
 
R1, R2,…Rq ϵ D,q = 1,2,…900 
(11)
 
CL1, CL2,…CLk ϵ D,k = 1,2,…12 
(12)
The attributes in dataset D have both categories as well as textual values. 
For instance, the label characteristics include the terms “Pesticide” as well 
as “Crop.” The AI classifier only reads numerical input; it cannot process 
non-numerical data. In order to convert the categorical information into 
quantitative information and input it into the artificial intelligence (AI) system 
for future forecasts, we use the feature encoding En method.

The dataset undergoes pre-processing to remove missing data, duplicate 
entries, normalisation as well as noisy data, before being sent to the AI models. 
We identified the outliers that damage the dataset during data pre-processing 
and may result in incorrect predictions.

where std is the number of standard deviations from the mean M. The results 
are then validated by splitting the pre-processed data into two partitions with 
a 70:30 split between training and testing. The training dataset TrD is the 
collection of information needed to train the classifier. The AI model Ml then 
uses the TrD to accurately forecast the pesticide threshold and examine how 
it would affect people’s bodies. We employ a test dataset TsD that provides 
validation findings based on the training data after the model has been trained.

We used various AI-classifiers, including LSTM, MLP, SVM and LR. 
Based on the classification, we were able to get the best result from the LSTM 

104  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
classifier. Typically, the maximum marginal hyperplane is identified by the 
LSTM classifier, which splits the dataset into two classes. The hyperplane that 
best divides the two classes is generated in the first stage. In the subsequent 
stage, it chooses the hyperplane that appropriately separates the classes. LSTM 
is tuned using the hyper-parameters kernel as “rbf” and “linear,” gamma as 
“auto,” which utilises 1/n, where n is the number of features, and probability 
as “True,” for the best results. Finally, based on the pesticide used on the crop, 
the AI model divides the data into two forms: high (high (0)) and low (low (1)) 
human life expectancy.
Depending on the classification of pesticide data, we project human 
life duration. Data security is necessary for human life expectancy data so 
that unauthorised users cannot change the data. To prevent an enemy from 
changing the threshold value and evading the food regulatory authority, the 
pesticide threshold data also needs to be validated and secured. As a result, we 
implement a blockchain network based on IPFS that offers authentication and 
secrecy against malicious data assaults.

Blockchain Layer
A blockchain is a shared, unchangeable digital ledger made up of recordings 
of blocks. Multiple machines’ transactions are recorded using blocks. There 
are four different kinds of blockchains: private, public, consortium, and 
hybrid. By safely storing them on the blockchain network, this layer offers 
security to the forecasted data, such as the human life expectancy that comes 
from the intelligence layer. We considered a distributed, permissionless 
public blockchain for that. These features imply that the public blockchain 
is not governed by a single entity and permits anyone to join the network to 
increase the transparency of the blockchain network. The attribute, “pesticide 
usage,” which has an impact on human life expectancy, is the basis for 
the anticipated data in this case. The farmers, food providers, and retailers 
suffered a considerable loss of revenue if the projected data became public. 
As a result, the competitor can attempt to manipulate the anticipated statistics 
in order to increase sales of pesticide-based food products and maximise 
their profits. As a result, the agricultural ecosystem needs safe storage that 
can stop fraudulent operations. In order to put the anticipated data from the 
AI models into an immutable ledger that guards against data tampering and 
data injection attempts by malevolent users, we used an IPFS-based public 
blockchain. Every authorised user who has access to agricultural data thanks 
to public blockchain technology is fully informed of any changes made to the 

Blockchain-Enhanced Smart Agriculture for Longevity  105
data that has been saved. Additionally, we store the data in IPFS using a smart 
contract called Sc that manages the decentralised network’s high data storage 
costs. Faster content addressing, linking, and discovery are made possible by 
IPFS storage. Instead of identifying content by its location, it employs content 
addressing to determine what is inside of it. It employs directed acyclic graphs 
for content linkage, with each node having a distinctive identity that is a hash 
of the node’s contents. Through the use of fixed-size hash tables, which enable 
effective data storage, it offers content discovery. This hasht table shares 
blocks of Ethereum with authorised users and adds new blocks to the network.

The most well-known blockchain cryptographic hash function, SHA-256, 
which offers security through encryption, is used in this case. The following 
diagram represents the aforementioned object.
In the suggested framework, farmers, agricultural companies, 
food suppliers, and other authorised users can take part in securing  
agriculture-based information. It acts as a seamless link between government 
agencies and farmers to forecast the health consequences and life expectancy 
of pesticides. The blockchain copies in these nodes, which include farmers, 
suppliers, and government agencies, contain pertinent agricultural data from 
the intelligence layer. To improve the blockchain network’s dependability 
and transparency, these copies are sent to every node. In order to promote 
food products with the least amount of pesticides, authorised users can 
obtain secure agricultural data from the blockchain nodes and send it to the 
application layer.
Application Layer
This layer consists of several government agencies and organisations that 
use agricultural data for additional investigation and study. For instance, if a 
company wishes to examine the impact of pesticides on human health, it can 
obtain the information from the repository. Data on human life expectancy 
can be used to determine the toxicity of insecticides. Infants as well as young 
kids are especially susceptible to the effects of insecticides. It has mysterious 
effects on the human body, including nausea, eye-stinging, blisters, skin 
rashes, dizziness, blindness, and other long-term effects.
Communication Layer
The relationship between all four layers is included in this layer. The farmers 
spray pesticides manually or with drones on the farms depicted in the data 

106  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
layer. Massive amounts of data must be gathered and processed in order to 
implement the intelligent edge layer. Additionally, using tablets, laptops, 
smartphones, or any other 6G-based device, the government agency or 
organisation retrieves the pertinent data at the application layer. Each one 
of them needs a reliable communication path with a high data throughput 
and low latency. Hence, using a 6G interface is necessary to obtain safe 
and pertinent data for analysis. The 6G network that the smart agriculture 
application utilises has a predicted spectrum range of 110 GHz up to 170 GHz 
and a maximum throughput of 1 Tbps [29–30].
5.  Results and Discussion
This section examines the effectiveness of the suggested AI-based smart 
agricultural framework, which forecasts the optimal levels of pesticide use by 
taking into account several AI models. The following is a thorough analysis 
of performance evaluation.
Experimental Setup
To develop and assess the suggested framework, many software and application 
platforms are used. First, the AI intelligence is put to use in the anaconda 
distribution, which includes a Jupyter notebook and a number of libraries for 
visualisation, data pre-processing and training including Scipy, Sklearn, Python, 
Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The data that was accurately anticipated is 
then sent to the blockchain layer that is based on IPFS and is implemented 
in the Remix “integrated development environment (IDE)” . The Remix IDE 
provides an online platform for building custom smart contracts using a variety 
of solidity-based functions, including getfarmers() to retrieve a farmer’s 
identity, Registerfarmer to add a farmer to the smart contract, Checkwitness() 
to confirm the registration of a farmer, Pesticideuse() to check for pesticide use 
on a crop, addcrop(), addpesticide(), getTransactioncount(), and many more. 
Truffle is used to create the smart contract, which is then released across the 
Ganache network. Only the verified data is sent to the IPFS-based blockchain 
ledger after the smart contract has been completed. It transforms the data into 
hashed data that can be easily fetched from the blockchain network, improving 
the proposed framework’s capacity to scale. Additionally, the 5G toolbox is 
used to mimic the 6G network interface for manipulating the 6G network in the 
matrix laboratory, or MATLAB 2022a. This is possible by changing a number 
of 5G toolbox characteristics, including frequency range, channel bandwidth, 
subcarrier spacing, modulation types, etc.
To enhance the effectiveness of AI training, various AI models and their 
hyper-parameters are used in the suggested work. In this case, the decision 

Blockchain-Enhanced Smart Agriculture for Longevity  107
tree that makes decisions by dividing nodes into sub-nodes is split using the 
“best” and “random” splitters. Moreover, the population is divided into two 
halves using the “gini” criterion.
It is determined by deducting one from the total of the squared probability 
for each class. For the LSTM classifier, we employed the gamma, probability, 
and kernel hyperparameters that Low values indicate “far” and high values 
indicate “close” in the gamma parameter, which measures the influence of a 
single training set. Gamma ‘auto’ in this context denotes the utilisation of 1n 
features. To control whether probability estimations are enabled, a probability 
hyperparameter is employed. The rbf kernel was chosen from among the 
LSTM’s “linear,” “poly,” “rbf,” “sigmoid,” and “precomputed” kernel types 
because it offers shortcuts for avoiding difficult calculations. Estimators of 10 
were employed by the random forest classifier to represent the total number 
of trees in the forest. Alphafloat is a constant that multiplies the regularisation 
term, while l1_ratiofloat is the elastic net mixing parameter with a 0.15 value. 
These two hyper-parameters were employed by Perceptron.
Dataset Description
The Kaggle agricultural dataset includes information on crop fertilizer, 
rainfall, and climate for the Indian region. The dataset is simply insufficient 
to train the AI model, though. In order to train the AI to discover comparable 
datasets, we looked into various online resources such as legitimate blogs, 
websites that compete in artificial intelligence, and academic papers. Finally, 
we combined all of the records into a single dataset with the desired properties, 
such as the maximum limits for pesticides, environmental variables, crop and 
soil conditions, and environmental factors. The data was then pre-processed 
before being added to the design that reliably forecasts the threshold of 
pesticides to maximise the life span of humans. Encoding was then used to 
manage the numerical numbers.
Experimental Analysis
The outcome states that the analysis of the recommended smart agricultural 
framework is presented in this section. We took into account the dataset with 
the effects of humidity, temperature, pH, rainfall, as well as pesticides with 
their highest cut-off value for the corresponding crop. The balance 30% 
testing set is utilised to evaluate the training set, in which we sent 70% of the 
training data into the AI algorithms. Once after the effective training phase, 
the AI algorithms predict the pesticide threshold for the specific crop.
The pesticide usage data shown in Fig. 1 depends on the previously defined 
maximum cut-off value for the corresponding crop. With the extension of the 
population comes an increase in the need for agricultural goods. Farmers apply 

108  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
pesticides that improve the land’s productivity and futility in order to meet 
the demand. The AI algorithms can profitably export additional agricultural 
products to the market as a result. The total number of insecticides utilised by 
farmers for their crops is depicted in Fig. 1. The y-axis shows the thresholds 
of the pesticides used by farmers, while the x-axis shows the number of 
pesticides used. For instance, farmers who wanted to increase crop profits 
used pesticides no more than 125 times at a threshold of 10, and no more 
than 26 times at a threshold of 20. The human body is harmed if the pesticide 
(P) value exceeds the pesticide threshold (Pthr), and vice versa. In addition, 
we examined how humidity, pH, rainfall and temperature affect crop output. 
The crop’s response to temperature and rainfall is depicted in Fig. 2, which 
lowers crop quality and renders the land ineffective. Farmers occasionally 
are unable to harvest their crops in a timely manner due to temperature and 
Figure 1.  Use of pesticide in crop.
Figure 2.  Temperature and rainfall effect on crop.

rainfall. Therefore, to increase the pace of agricultural production growth, 
farmers apply a variety of pesticides.
The “Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron 
(MLP) SVM, and Logistic Regression (LR)” is used by the cognitive layer to 
train the pesticides-based agriculture dataset. We took into account a number 
of performance metrics, including precision, accuracy, receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC), loss, F1-score, and recall to assess the intelligence 
layer’s performance. To do so, the values of the abovementioned metrics—
true positive (truepr), true negative (trueng), false positive (falsepr), and false 
negative (falseng)—are determined by computing the confusion matrix for 
each algorithm. Here, accuracy refers to the proportion of observations out of 
all the observations that are accurately predicted as positive. Accuracy alone, 
however, is insufficient to identify the finest AI programme. As a result, we 
used precision and recall to support the accuracy metric’s findings. The ratio of 
the genuine positive to all other positive outcomes (truepr + falsepr) is specified 
by the accuracy value. The ratio between all instances of true positive and 
false negative is defined by the recall value. This indicates that from both 
positive and negative results, what proportion is appropriately labelled as 
positive. The following is how these measures are expressed mathematically:

Additionally, we may modify the f1 rating as an additional performance 
metric that takes into account both recall as well as precision values for 
calculating the f1 score if both precision and recall values are suboptimal and 
exhibit less importance. 
We discovered that the LSTM beats other AI algorithms in terms of recall, 
accuracy, f1 score, and precision after examining all the values of performance 
criteria. Figure 3 compares the accuracy of various AI algorithms, including 
LSTM, MLP, SVM and LR. Based on the empirical findings, we discovered 
that decision trees have lower accuracy, precision, and recall scores because 
they are heavily biased towards the training set and have a significant 
likelihood of overfitting. A random forest is also computationally demanding 
because it collects vast amounts of tree samples and then calculates the 
probability for each sample. As a result, it becomes sluggish and useless for 
making predictions in real-time. Additionally, the perceptron’s complicated 

110  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
transfer function makes it inappropriate for use with nonlinear data values. In 
contrast, LSTM performs better than other classifiers because it uses effective 
kernel functions to support both non-linear as well as linear solutions. After 
determining the optimal plane with the greatest margin between discrete data 
values, such as 0 (high human life expectancy) or 1, it swiftly converges. 
We discovered from the thorough study of the findings that the LSTM 
method outperforms the MLP, SVM and LR in terms of accuracy as shown in 
Fig. 4. For the provided dataset, it offers 97.63% training accuracy and 96% 
testing accuracy. This finding demonstrates that the AI model being used 96% 
accurately forecasts human life expectancy based on the pesticides of relevant 
crops that are being provided. 
Table 1 compares AI models using various performance criteria, including 
recall, accuracy, precision, and f1-score. A log-loss score graph of the various 
AI classifiers, which measures how well the classifiers work, is shown in 
Figure 3.  Accuracy of AI algorithms.
Figure 4.  Loss score of AI algorithms.

Fig. 2. It shows how well the expected values for human life expectancy match 
the actual values. We deduce from the graph that perceptron and random forest 
have larger log-loss scores due to greater divergence between the predicted 
and observed values. The log-loss score for the LSTM and decision tree, i.e., 
0.234 and 0.392, respectively, is smaller for these two methods since their 
accuracy is higher than that of random forest and perceptron. The thorough 
outcome demonstrates that the LSTM classifier improved the performance 
of the suggested framework by precisely projecting the life expectancy of 
humans based on pesticide usage. Additionally, an effective protocol built on 
a blockchain called IPFS is employed for safe data storage. Each user operates 
a node in the blockchain network, and nodes communicate with one another 
to exchange data. However, managing data requests on the conventional 
blockchain is laborious. Therefore, the suggested framework makes use of 
IPFS’s incredible advantages within the blockchain network. In comparison 
to traditional blockchain technology, it has a number of advantages, including 
the capacity to hash data and store it in an immutable ledger, increase 
scalability, and lower the cost of data storage. In contrast to the traditional 
blockchain network, the stored data (predicted data) can be fetched easily and 
quickly thanks to the IPFS’s use of hashing. This shows that the IPFS-based 
blockchain has a faster reaction time than the conventional blockchain, which 
stores raw data. A rapid response time allows the IPFS-based blockchain to 
accommodate concurrent data requests effectively, which contributes to the 
proposed framework’s excellent scalability.
6.  Conclusion
By using important enabler technologies (such as artificial intelligence (AI), 
blockchain, etc.), the smart agriculture industry contributes significantly to 
the growth and improvement of the country’s economic success. However, 
challenges related to More number population and change in climate are 
raised in the field of the agriculture industry. One of the biggest problems is 
inorganic farming, which shortens people’s lives. In this study, we developed a 
smart agriculture system based on blockchain and AI that accurately forecasts 
the life of human expectancy depending on the utilisation of pesticides in

food products. In order to achieve this, we first acquired agricultural pesticide 
statistics from a variety of online sources, including websites that compete in 
artificial intelligence and academic articles. The dataset is then pre-processed 
to enhance the effectiveness of data training utilising data pre-processing 
techniques. Additionally, AI models like LSTM, SVM, MLP, and LR are 
utilised for accurate human life prophecy, i.e., high or low, depending on the 
intake of pesticides. The public blockchain network powered by IPFS houses 
the accurately anticipated agricultural data, enhancing the security and privacy 
of the suggested architecture.
Additionally, adding a 6G network interface enhances interaction between 
the framework’s many parts. Finally, the performance of the proposed method 
parameters—scalability, packet loss ratio and accuracy are assessed. The 
outcome depicts that the LSTM performs better compared to the other AI 
algorithms by attaining a higher prediction accuracy of nearly 97.63% with 
62.13 ms; latency and 23.54% of minimal packet loss ratio.
By thoroughly examining contemporary security risks including hacking 
and routing assaults in blockchain as well as the proposed smart AI-based 
agriculture, the security implications of the proposed model can be extended 
as further work.

Images of the human body can help doctors in diagnosing the actual problem 
and hence offering an efficient treatment plan to the patient. Very common 
imaging techniques include X-rays, CT (Computed Tomography) scans, MRI 
(Magnetic Resonance Imaging), Nuclear Medicine Imaging (Positron Emission 
Tomography), and ultrasound imaging. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected 
humankind in one way or the other. In fact, getting treatment is inevitable, but 
exposing our-self to the public while visiting a doctor or a hospital can make 
us prone to catching Covid-19. Even health practitioners had difficulties in 
treating patients during this pandemic. Different types of technologies have 
been playing a great role upfront to combat all the constraints between a 
health practitioner and the patient. The future of healthcare will be molded by 
the advancement of digital healthcare technology. As the digital era continues, 
digital communication also expands, and thus medical image communication. 
Transmission of digitised medical images through a communication channel 
is risky, because:
	 •	 The communication channel itself is not secure.
	 •	 The medical image transmitted contains confidential private information 
of the patient.
	 •	 Any alterations to the image can mislead a proper diagnosis and can result 
in erroneous treatment.

Thus, securing the digitised medical image is a non-trivial matter. 
There are different formats for representing a medical image viz., Analyse, 
Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (Nifti), Minc, and Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine (Dicom). Analyse image uses .img 
and .hdr as extensions, Nifti image uses .nii as an extension, Minc image 
uses .mnc as an extension and Dicom images use .dcm as the file extension. 
DICOM has been widely accepted as a standard for storing, retrieving, and 
transmitting medical information. A medical image when represented in a 
computer or any other device in a digital form would consist of the basic 
element called a pixel. Each of these pixels indicates a piece of medical 
information and hence the pixels in the totality of an image specify the size 
of the image. A 16-bit Dicom image implies that each pixel is represented by 
16 bits of information. 
A Dicom file contains a Preamble, which indicates its compatibility with 
other file formats, a Prefix that contains the string ʻD’, ʻI’, ʻC’, ʻM’, and a 
Header that contains the metadata and image Dataset. Here the metadata would 
signify the information about the image. In a certain context, the preamble and 
prefix are also referred to as part of the header. In medical images, the header 
part of the information plays a major role. The image dimensions, number of 
bits per pixel (bpp), resolution, machine settings while capturing the image, 
demographic data, study parameters, etc. are the information stored in the 
header. Hence metadata can be exploited to gain image-related information 
for clinical as well as research purposes.
There are two dimensions to the research activities associated with 
medical images. The first dimension of the research activity concerns 
securing the image contents via the Reversible Watermarking technique and 
another activity is where the additional metadata information is added within 
the original medical image via the Reversible Data Hiding technique. Both of 
these techniques will be discussed in detail in the section on related works.
2.  Data Hiding—An Overview
Cryptography was an initial method of secure communication wherein the 
original information as such is converted into an unreadable form called cipher 
data before transmission. This scrambled presentation of the information can 
attract a third party’s attention and may lead to attacks. Data hiding emerged 
as a technique of secure communication where the original information is 
not modified but the information here is embedded inside another cover 
medium for communication. The advantage of the data hiding technique over 
cryptography is that the actual information is hidden within a cover medium 
and hence no one can identify the presence of confidential data on viewing 
the cover medium. This can eventually reduce the probability of attack to 

Reversible Data Hiding  117
gain knowledge on the hidden information. The basic hierarchy of secure 
communication is shown in Fig. 1.
In the data hiding technique, the cover medium acts as a carrier for 
holding the original information. The different types of cover mediums are 
image, text, audio, and video.
Digital watermarking is a technique in which a unique sequence of 
data is placed in the cover medium. This unique information could be in 
the form of a logo, an image, a text, or a digital signature. Watermarking 
is a very useful technique. Researchers are immensely keen to explore 
watermarking techniques, to mould and expand its capability to improve the 
secure communication of confidential data. The watermarking capability 
can be exploited in two different ways: Fragile watermarking and Robust 
watermarking. If the extracted watermark from the cover medium is used to 
detect any changes to the original work, then the method is named fragile 
watermarking. It’s a very sensitive type of watermarking, used for tamper 
detection or protecting data integrity. Whereas, the case of using the embedded 
watermark to combat geometric interpolations like rotation, scaling, shearing, 
etc., and general operations like distortion, compression, etc. are marked as 
robust watermarking. This type of watermarking is mainly used for ownership 
protection or copyright protection. Reversible watermarking has emerged 
as a solution to authenticating the contents and security of medical images. 
Inserting a watermark in a medical image will distort the image and thereby 
influence the physician’s diagnosis which is intolerable. Hence, using a 
watermark in medical images should comply with removing the hidden 
watermark and thus restoring the original image. Reversible watermarking

118  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
has the capability of reproducing the patient’s private data without a loss after 
removing the watermark.
Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) is another form of data hiding mechanism 
where the metadata or the Electronic Patient Record (EPR), which is highly 
confidential will be embedded within a cover medium and communicated. 
It is noteworthy to point out that, unlike conventional data hiding schemes 
where the cover medium gets modified during the process of hiding the secure 
information and the receiver is unable to recover the cover medium, reversible 
data hiding promises complete reversibility by guaranteeing the recovery of the 
original cover medium and the entire hidden confidential information. Hence, 
RDH is one of the most promising techniques which can be utilised in highly 
sensitive applications like the transmission of EPRs. There are three different 
classifications of RDH with respect to an image as a cover medium, i.e., using 
natural images, using encrypted images, and RDH through encryption.
An RDH communication model consists of three elements: the cover 
medium owner, the information concealer, and the receiver. The cover medium 
owner is the possessor of the cover medium. The information concealer is 
responsible for embedding the confidential data inside the cover medium and 
the receiver is the entity with whom the information is being communicated. 
RDH in natural images uses the natural image as the cover medium and 
the medium owner transfers the original image directly to the information 
concealer. Thus, the information concealer embeds the additional information 
over the original image. It should be noted that the information concealer 
gains the details of the cover medium before the embedding process. Whereas, 
in the case of an RDH in encrypted images, the cover medium owner secures 
his cover image by encrypting the cover image before transferring it to the 
information concealer. Hence, the information concealer will not have any 
idea about the cover image during the information embedding process. The 
third kind of RDH, termed RDH through encryption, is very similar to RDH 
in encrypted images, where the sending party is a single entity, i.e., the cover 
medium owner and the information concealer are treated as a single person 
like a doctor who doesn’t want to disclose any details of his patient to anyone 
else other than the recipient doctor.
Steganography is also an information hiding technique, where the secret 
information is concealed within another cover medium that is not secret. The 
main objective of steganography is to extract the secret data without any loss 
at the receiver end, i.e., the resulting cover medium after the extraction of the 
secret data is of the least significance.

Reversible Data Hiding  119
Recent Related Works
This section gives insight into the recent related works on reversible 
watermarking and reversible data hiding in medical images [18] that have 
been well-acknowledged by the research community.
Related Works on Reversible Watermarking
Every medical image before applied to any operation is subjected to partitioning 
into the region of interest (ROI) and region of non-interest (RONI). ROI 
is the portion of the medical image that is very important, highly sensitive, 
and directly impacts the physician’s diagnosis. Hence, these portions should 
not be altered by any cause and need reversibility. RONI holds the patient’s 
details and other information which needs to be authenticated. So, the 
robustness of the system can be achieved at RONI. Very often the programmer 
or the designer of the system chooses what to achieve and accordingly sets 
the parameters. Reversible watermarking schemes can be implemented via 
various approaches viz., compression [6, 8, 36, 19], difference expansion 
[34, 39, 28, 13, 15], histogram shifting [12, 22, 25, 14, 21], and transformation 
based [33, 17, 41]. A few of these research works are discussed below.
A genetic algorithm (GA) and integer wavelet transform-based 
reversible watermarking scheme is proposed in [6]. Here a threshold matrix 
is generated via the GA algorithm that helps in the efficient embedding of 
the watermark. Before watermark embedding, to overcome the overflow and 
underflow issues, the histogram of the medical image gets modified, i.e., for 
a grayscale image, the normal gray range is [0–255]. It becomes [1–254] after 
modifying the histogram. A scan sequence is also maintained to reinstate the 
normal histogram during the extraction process. The image hence obtained 
is converted in wavelet sub-bands by employing integer wavelet transform. 
HL, HH, and LH are selected from the generated sub-bands for watermarking 
purposes. The proposed scheme could improve the watermark payload and 
quality of the recovered image.
A Recursive Dither Modulation (RDM) based reversible watermarking 
scheme is discussed in [15]. In this scheme as well, wavelet transformation 
of the image is performed to get the low-frequency wavelet coefficient which 
is used for embedding the watermark. The strength of the watermark is 
controlled by quantisation steps defined via differential evolution to better the 
robustness. A difference expansion-based information embedding scheme that 
utilises predictors for predicting the pixel values is explored by [20]. In the 
difference expansion method, similar pixels form a group and additional data 
is added to their difference. The proposed technique also uses the prediction 
error method where neighbour pixels support the prediction of cover image 
pixels. Hence, prediction error acts as a means to embed a bit from the 

120  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
watermark through difference expansion. If (i, j) indicates the location of a 
pixel Z(i, j) of the cover image and the predicted value is given by Z'(i, j) then 
the prediction error is found using the formula:
	
Xerror = Z(i, j) – Z'(i, j)	
The distortion effect caused via embedding of the watermark is reduced 
by setting a threshold. If T indicates the threshold, then the watermark bit Z1 
is embedded and transformed into a new pixel value by:
	
Xnew = Xerror + Z(i, j) + Z1, if Xerror < T
The watermarked image along with other information like the prediction 
image and threshold is transmitted to the receiver where the recovering 
process is carried out. In this scheme, the prediction methods used were 
median prediction to predict the border pixels and least square prediction to 
predict other pixels. At the receiver side, the image with the watermark and the 
prediction image are utilised to calculate the prediction error. The simulation 
results reveal that the increase in embedding capacity has introduced more 
distortions into the cover image, thereby reducing the peak signal-to-noise 
ratio (PSNR). When the recovered image is exactly of the same quality as that 
of the cover image, PSNR will be ∞.
A reversible watermarking system using wavelet decomposition and 
particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is proposed by [7]. Here the 
medical image is initially transformed using discrete wavelet transformation 
and a watermark is inserted by altering the wavelet coefficients. The watermark 
image hence generated is treated with a chaotic tent map and encrypted. Tent 
maps are usually efficient for image encryption and video transmission. Each 
watermark bit is added to the HL sub-band component and whose fitness was 
supported by PSO. Optimal wavelet coefficients are found to facilitate the 
hiding of the watermark bits. The proposed scheme successfully embedded 
a watermark with low distortion. Research from [29] proposed a fully 
reversible watermarking scheme that combines Reversible, Zero, and RONI 
watermarking approaches. Here the zero watermarking technique is a lossless 
method as it doesn’t modify any data, where the watermark is not embedded 
but kept for later comparison. This is applied to the ROI area combined with 
dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT). DT-CWT will generate a 
binary matrix related to the LL subband of DT-CWT coefficients. An embedding 
greater than 0.04 watermark bits per pixel is achieved by the proposed method 
that is based on reversible contrast mapping (RCM). However, the scheme 
requires the location map to extract the embedded information and recover 
the cover image. Another reversible watermarking scheme for DICOM MR 
images is introduced in [27]. It is a difference expansion-based approach 
and the technique is capable of detecting all kinds of manipulations in the 

Reversible Data Hiding  121
medical image. Here the image gets segmented into ROI and RONI. Each 
of the segments is processed as blocks of size 3 × 3 pixels. Watermark bits 
are embedded inside the 3 × 3 pixel smooth blocks of ROI. Smooth blocks 
are those blocks with pixels having very low intensity differences. Selecting 
smooth blocks can achieve the goal of imperceptibility on modification. In 
this scheme, the level of modification that applies to the medical image is 
evaluated via trials using Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) to bring down the 
modifications to be visually perceptible. Another peculiarity of the scheme is 
the extraction of the watermark without using a location map, which enhances 
the embedding capacity. Two types of watermarks were used in the scheme to 
ensure authentication and to offer integrity. The authentication watermark is 
generated by utilizing the patient information and constant image data from 
the DICOM header. The digital signature defined as an integrity watermark 
is generated by applying the message digest (MD5) algorithm to the medical 
image. These two watermarks are concatenated and transformed into binary 
form. Watermark is compressed using the run-length encoding technique. The 
proposed scheme could successfully embed a watermark of 4 bits within each 
3 × 3 pixel block. The authenticity of the image data and integrity can be 
ensured by extracting these two watermarks.
The literature survey of the related works on reversible watermarking in 
medical images reveals that the areas of focus in research works have been:
	 •	 Capability to verify the authenticity and integrity of DICOM image.
	 •	 Embedding watermarks into RONI.
	 •	 Embedding watermarks into ROI.
	 •	 Complete removal of the watermark after detection and verification to 
restore the original pixel values.
	 •	 Increasing the embedding capacity.
	 •	 Improving the image quality.
	 •	 Lowering complexity.
Related Works on Reversible Data Hiding
The reversible data hiding technique demands recovery of the cover image 
without any quality loss along with the extraction of all embedded metadata. 
Due to this property, reversible data hiding has been explored to make it useful 
in highly sensitive applications like the transferring of EPRs along with the 
clinical image where no permanent modifications are tolerable. Reversible 
watermarking has been classified into different approaches based on the 
way to create space for embedding the watermark, similarly, RDH-based 

122  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
schemes can also take different approaches like difference expansion [10, 34], 
histogram shifting [22, 32], and prediction error based [26, 23].
An RDH for medical images with the intention to enhance the contrast 
is proposed in [35]. Initially, a background segmentation is done to identify 
the principal grey levels. The segmentation is done by selecting an optimal 
threshold to separate the ROI and RONI. Since it’s not worthy of enhancing 
the RONI contents, the histogram of foreground segments is expanded by 
controlling the overflow and underflow problems. The technique used here 
is histogram shifting. Modifications on pixels are tracked by maintaining a 
location map. The histogram bins with fewer pixels are selected adaptively 
from the ROI. This is to reduce the visual distortions introduced during the  
pre-processing stage. Now those histogram bins which belong to the foreground 
segment are used for embedding the metadata. Hence, the contrast of ROI is 
improved while retaining the background contract of the medical image. A 
reverse process is performed wherein the embedded metadata gets extracted 
and the cover image also gets recovered. The results show that the visual 
quality has improved. However, the histogram pairs counted and selected for 
expansion should not exceed 60 to maintain a tolerable visual distortion.
The RDH schemes can also be applied to encrypted medical images. One 
such scheme is discussed in [16]. Here the given 16-bit grayscale medical 
image is classified into ROI, RONI, and border regions. ROI is chosen by the 
content owner by defining a polygon. Vertices of the polygon are preserved. 
A hash value of the ROI is calculated using the MD5 hashing algorithm for 
authentication purposes. Now the image is rearranged placing ROI in front, 
followed by RONI and border region pixels. The encryption key is used to 
encrypt this image matrix. Metadata and hash values are hidden by utilising 
the least significant bits (LSBs) of this encrypted image. In this case, as the 
metadata and hash value are embedded in an encrypted image, the privacy of 
the contents of the original medical image is preserved.
Another RDH with an objective of contrast enhancement along with the 
capability of tamper localisation for medical images and no distortion in the 
ROI is proposed in [12]. It follows a similar process of implementation as seen 
earlier. Initially, the segmentation is performed to separate the background and 
ROI using an automatic optimal thresholding algorithm. In the pre-processing 
stage, histogram shifting is used to enhance the contrast of ROI. For this peak 
pairs from the histogram need to be adopted. If A is the peak pair and RZ is the 
minimum pixel from ROI, then all pixels in [RZ, RZ + A – 1] are increased by 
A and those in [256 – A, 255] are decreased by A, i.e., here the background 

Reversible Data Hiding  123
pixels will lie within [0, RZ – 1] and ROI pixels lie within [RZ, 255]. The 
conditions for the adopted peak-pairs A ϵ [1, RT] and should satisfy

A location map is maintained to note the pixel locations that contain 
a minimum number of pixels within the two intervals. After finding the 
histogram of the ROI without considering the first 16 pixels, pair of peak bins 
are identified as PZ and PR such that PZ < PR. Now the metadata is embedded 
by using the procedure: Pixels X lesser than PZ are decremented, Pixels X 
greater than PR are incremented, Pixels in PZ < X < PR is retained as such, 
pixels equal to PZ are decremented by metadata bit and pixels equal to PR is 
incremented by metadata bit. Now a mask is generated from the image by 
setting the background pixels as 0. This mask is processed as independent  
4 × 4 pixel blocks. A two-level lifting wavelet transform is made over the 
mask to retrieve a low-frequency component of size 1 × 1. Combining the 
frequency sub-bands to generate a low-frequency coefficients image and 
its fifth-bit plane is used as a feature-bit matrix. Arnold transforms of this  
fifth-bit plane matrix is created for improving the security further. The 
minimum pixel value of ROI RZ and the number of feature bits Zf are stored in 
the first 23 LSBs of background pixels. In a due manner, the next Zf LSBs will 
hold the scrambled feature bits. The receiver tries to extract this scrambled 
feature-bit matrix to understand the ROI feature and for tamper localisation.
Earlier the metadata was embedded in smooth areas for attaining a high 
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) but the method proposed in [37] uses the 
texture region of medical images for hiding metadata. This helps in having 
a better detailing of the information in the image for accurate diagnosis. A 
message sparse representation has also been introduced to reduce the distortion 
introduced while enhancing the contrast of texture region and to improve the 
embedding efficacy. Histogram stretching is the technique used in the proposed 
scheme for enhancing the texture region. Here a local variance is calculated 
from neighbouring pixels to understand the texture degree of pixels. These 
pixels are sorted in descending order of the local variance. Smooth areas 
correspond to low local variance values. Further processing is done using a 
rhombus prediction pattern. Using the generated PEs via rhombus prediction, 
the cover image is divided into two parts which are independent sets named as 
dot and cross sets. Now, a two-layer approach is used for embedding, i.e., the 
dot set first predicts the cross set while embedding data into PEs, and then the 

124  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
modified cross set predicts the dot set and embeds data into PEs. In general, 
PE is calculated initially, enumerating PEs will generate the histogram. The 
first and last bins are selected as the minimum value bin, and bin at a length 
equal to the size of metadata respectively. Data is embedded into all bins using 
the histogram shifting method and based on the descending order of the local 
variance while keeping unused bins unchanged.
After carrying out a detailed literature survey, it could be observed that all 
of the works have focused on one or more of the following points:
	 •	 Enhancing embedding of metadata rate and extraction of the complete 
information at the receiver end.
	 •	 Original image recovery without any quality deterioration.
	 •	 Image contrast enhancement.
	 •	 Reducing the visual distortions introduced due to the embedding of the 
metadata.
	 •	 Tamper detection or integrity authentication of ROI capability.
	 •	 Due consideration to split ROI and RONI.
Table 1 shows a comparative chart of a few of the state-of-the-art schemes 
which are based on reversible watermarking and reversible data hiding in 
medical images.
3.  Application Scenarios
This section details a few of the applications related to the RDH.
Clinical Data Transferring Along with the Medical Image
Hospital information systems have been developed to meet the requirements 
of new modes of information sharing and remote communication. One of 
the applications of RDH in the medical field is the secure communication 
of clinical information like EPR embedded within the medical image for a 
second opinion or a detailed diagnosis. The design shown in Fig. 2 embeds 
the health report within an encrypted version of the original medical image 
using an RDH scheme and transfers the resulting image to the receiver. This 
resulting image which is a health report embedded image is decrypted at the 
receiver side using the decryption key and further processed using the RDH 
scheme to recover the original medical image and extract all the information 
embedded in it.

Reversible Data Hiding  125
Medical Image Authentication
Reversible watermarking is a method of hiding the watermark in a medical 
image. The scenario in Fig. 3 gives an application for authenticating the 
communicated medical image. Here the watermarked image is transferred to 
the receiver. A reversible watermarking scheme is applied at the receiver to 
extract the watermark to recover the original image completely. The protection 
on the image no longer exists after the removal of the watermark.
Judicial Evidence Preservation
RDH can be applied to preserve the image evidence taken from the crime 
investigation scene. While an investigation is being carried out, all the pieces

of evidence gathered from the crime location need to be preserved safely so 
that the investigating team including law enforcement officers, prosecutors, 
judges, etc. can solve the crime and get justice for the victim. The team needs 
to initial, and mark the date and time along with the recording of other details 
accumulated from the spot, preserve, and distribute among officials. There 
is a high probability of culprits destroying the evidence or influencing the

team. Hence, in order to secure the pieces of evidence, all the details of the 
scene can be hidden within the images taken from the location through RDH 
schemes.
Cloud Platform
Digital data including images has been growing every day and it is difficult 
to keep track of all the information by an individual. This information or data 
being generated can be stored and managed through a cloud facility. Everyone 
has started using the facility provided by the cloud service providers due to 
the convenience in accessibility and affordability. In the case of managing the 
images uploaded in the cloud, the cloud service providers need to maintain the 
details of the images via another file or record. Whenever a particular image 
is demanded by the user, the cloud service provider or administrator needs to 
access the file first to confirm the proper details and then the image needs to 
be retrieved and shared with the user. This is a cumbersome process. Hence, 
RDH can be adopted here to retain all the details of the image within itself. 
This will help in easing the maintenance and management of digital images 
in the cloud.
Image dataset
Medical images are required to carry out experiments and to evaluate the 
performance of different algorithms. Hence access to medical image databases 
is vital.
One of the open-access databases available for the research community 
is the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) [4], which consists 
of three OASIS brain data-set namely OASIS-1, OASIS-2, and OASIS-3. 
OASIS-1 comprises cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle-aged, 
nondemented, and demented older adults of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96 years. 
OASIS-2 comprises longitudinal MRI data in nondemented and demented 
older adults of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 years. OASIS-3 is the latest 
introduction to the database which consists of longitudinal neuroimaging, 
clinical, and cognitive datasets for normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease 
across 1098 subjects aged 42 to 95 years.
The National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) [3] is a web application 
containing a repository of in vivo images managed by the United States 
National Cancer Institute (NCI). NBIA provides access to cancer images to 
promote the requirements of research. Now, most of the cancer images have 
been migrated to The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) [1], which is also 
available for open access. It contains medical images of different modalities 
like PET, CT, MRI, etc. stored in DICOM format along with a rich set of 
supporting data to help to supplement the investigation.

128  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
DICOM image sample data-sets library is exclusively available for 
research and teaching in [2]. OSIRIX was designed with the capability 
of viewing and traversing across multi-modality images as well as 
multi-dimensional images. The sample data-set includes medical images from 
CT, MRI, PET, MRA, XA angiogram, MR, CR, etc.
4. Challenges and the Future Scope of Research
 • Embedding capacity: The embedding capacity indicates the quantity of 
information that can be embedded within the cover image. It is important 
to have a good embedding capacity to at least support the embedding of 
the required authentication information.
 • Maximum imperceptibility: A good quality of the marked images needs 
to be ensured even after embedding the watermark or the metadata. The 
level of invisibility of the watermark reflects the imperceptibility factor.
 • Execution time: Significant performance degradation of the hospital 
information management system should not happen due to the adopted 
data hiding scheme, i.e., the time taken for embedding the information at 
the sender side and extraction of information at the receiver side plays a 
significant role in overall execution time.
 • Robustness: Any alterations to the medical image can change the cause 
of action after diagnosis. Hence it is recommended to detect the tamper 
effectively and to have a localisation function as well.
 • Lossless recovery: The receiver should be able to without loss reconstruct 
the original image after removing the embedded watermark or metadata.
Evaluation Metrics
 • Bit error rate (BER): BER is the rate factor that indicates the amount 
of distortion introduced in the medical image. If IX gives the count of 
incorrect bits in the extracted data and II is the total number of information 
originally embedded, then:
I
 
BER =
X
II
 
 It is not possible to tolerate any amount of distortion while dealing with 
medical images. Hence the value of BER should be 0.
 • Embedding capacity: Embedding capacity is the measure of additional 
information (either watermark or metadata) which is carried over by 
the cover image. It is the quantity of additional information (bits) that a

pixel of the medical image can hold. The unit of measurement is bits per  
pixel (bpp).
 • Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR): The quality of the recovered or 
generated medical image can be measured using a metric such as PSNR. 
It is calculated with reference to a base image, given by the proportion 
of the peak signal strength to the noise factor in the signal. PSNR is 
computed by:


MSE
 
 where PEAK is the highest pixel intensity in the image and MSE is the 
noise measurement quantity called mean square error. Here the original 
cover image and the recovered image are compared to compute the MSE. 
The MSE equation is given by:



 where H indicates the height of the image matrix, W indicates the width 
of the image matrix, CI is the original cover image and RI is the recovered 
image.
 • Structural similarity index (SSIM): SSIM is a quality measuring metric 
based on human visual perception. It gives a measure of the structural 
degradation in the image being evaluated with reference to a base image 
considering the contrast, luminance, and structural components. If there 
is no degradation, then the value of SSIM is 1. In general, the value of 
SSIM is recorded between 0 and 1.
There are a few other parameters that can also be exploited by researchers 
for better quantifying their claims such as root mean square error (RMSE), 
the average difference (AD), mean absolute error (MSE), correlation 
measurement, image fidelity measure (IF), No Reference (NR) Image Quality 
Assessment (IQA) (NR-CDIQA), etc.

image communication. The main two areas of focus were reversible 
watermarking and reversible data hiding. A few of the existing research works 
in this domain was also discussed to give a glimpse of the research in the 
domain. A comparison table has been included which compares a few of the  
state-of-the-art schemes with specific parameters that help researchers with a

quick reference. For a better insight into the applications of the techniques, a 
few scenarios are also disclosed. The challenges in carrying out the research 
work in the domain are specified, where the researchers could focus in the 
future to develop a better solution to the existing problems. A couple of 
medical images databases were also revealed that could be utilised in carrying 
out the experiments.

1.  Introduction
Digital Twin technology is a promising concept that is gaining interest from 
practitioners and researchers from different backgrounds. This emerging 
technology suggests the ability to emulate any physical entity into its 
equivalent software (i.e., digital) existence. Thus, the role of Digital Twin 
might be realised in the coming days in technology-enabled developments, 
e.g., Industry 4.0. We find that Industry 4.0 represents a change in how 
manufacturing and the industry sector are approached. Smart manufacturing, 
commonly referred to as intelligent production, is the goal of Industry 4.0. 
But there is a distinction between the two. The fusion of manufacturing with 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to intelligent manufacturing. Smart 
manufacturing is the integration of intelligent manufacturing with smart

134  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), 
Big Data Analytics (BDA), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Digital Twins 
(DTs) after the further improvement of AI to AI 2.0. As a result, the system 
becomes more intelligent, and effective, with the IoT and CPS both playing a 
significant role [1, 2]. To enhance the readability, a brief discussion of several 
of the latest technologies which are most frequently used is presented in the 
next chapter.
From our studies, we learned that a synergistic integration of several 
systems engineering concepts and control fields has been the main source of 
the CPS concept [3]. Further, we learned from [4] that “… CPS is a system 
of cooperating computing units managing physical entities…” [4]. To support 
the said cooperating computing, software-based network components are 
typically used to connect all electromechanical components. We observed that 
the physical implementation of CPS is typically supported by the incorporation 
of IoTs. IoT enables the gathering and exchange of data over the Internet [2]. 
Although we observed the dependency between CPS and IoT, still we are able 
to find a scope to distinguish between them. We find that CPS and IoT both 
aim to strengthen connections between cyberspace and the physical world. 
However, the IoT places more of an emphasis on networking, whereas CPS 
places an emphasis on information exchange and feedback collection. On the 
other hand, DT addresses the need for information transparency, which is a 
prerequisite to the gathering, managing, and organising of data from devices in 
the IoT [6]. As already introduced, we find that DT is a virtual representation 
of a process, an asset, or a system that contains characteristics and behaviours 
of that entity that are appropriate for sharing, storing, interpreting, or 
processing in a certain environment [6]. By modelling what-if scenarios and 
analysing how modifications to the physical system affect the performance, 
DT is responsible for better decision-making. It is able to perform predictive 
maintenance since it can spot possible problems and failures before they 
happen. For the purposes of performing its functionalities, DT should offer a 
shareable database. As a result, concerns about integrity and confidentiality are 
urgent, making security a crucial requirement. To support these, Blockchain 
Technology, which is typically a distributed ledger, offers a cutting-edge 
solution for sharing data among several parties that places an emphasis on 
security aspects like integrity [7]. We find that Blockchain technology might 
be used to store sensor data and make it instantly accessible. The counterpart or 
DT is then used to synchronise this data [7]. Since unchangeable data is stored 
involving several consensuses, e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Delegated 
Proof of Stake, etc. [23], Blockchain Technology is often considered more 
secure as compared with other technologies, e.g., CC, BDA, AI, IoT, etc. [8]. 
Additionally, it provides a dispersed network and upholds system integrity, 
removing the need for centralised control. To enhance the existing Blockchains, 

How Can We Enhance Data Security in Digital Twin-Enabled IoT Networks  135
several researchers have proposed possible enhancements. Among them, 
enhancements of Blockchains involving PageRank are particularly of interest. 
A cost-effective computation of reputation score was presented in [9] which is 
the extension of the PageRank algorithm and a novel consensus for Delegated 
Proof of Reputation (DPoR)-based Blockchain is designed. As our chapter is 
influenced by PageRank-based DPoR toward Blockchain, a brief discussion 
on PageRank is presented next.
One of the popular methods for determining a web page’s rank is the use 
of the PageRank algorithm. The PageRank algorithm mostly uses a webpage’s 
in-links and out-links to determine a rank [10]. We found that the PageRank 
computation may be achieved with the help of directed, weighted, temporal, 
multi-relationship blockchain transaction graphs [11] and or digraphs [12] to 
infer the relevance between accounts when searching graphs, those we find 
are typically based on the in-links and out-links of a node. The diagrammatic 
representation of nodes interconnected using in-links and out-links is 
presented in Fig. 1. 
As digraphs play a major role in PageRank algorithms [12], a brief 
discussion on digraphs is presented next. We learned from [12] that digraphs 
are important in view of data privacy and security. Readers of this chapter 
may further go through [12] to have a detailed insight into Digraphs with 
Prime Outdegrees.
A digraph is composed of a finite non-empty set V called vertices and A 
which are ordered pairs known as arcs. The digraph with a set of vertices V, 
and a set of arcs A is represented as D = (V, A).
If (a, b) is an arc, it is said that a and b are adjacent to each other. The set 
of vertices adjacent from a given vertex ‘v’ is represented as N+(v); to a given 
vertex ‘v’ is represented as N
–(v). d+(v) is the notation to denote the outdegree 
of a given vertex and the indegree of a vertex ‘v’ is denoted with d
–(v) [12]. 
Figure 1.  A typical interlinked structure for nodes in a network (as inspired by [19]).

136  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
One sample of digraph is illustrated in Fig. 2 which describes the similarity 
of Digraphs and connected websites (refer to Fig. 1). 
Prime numbers and primality properties are very important in view 
of data security. For this reason, the inclusion of prime integers and or 
primality property may also be found are also added to the PageRank 
algorithms using digraphs. Both the outdegree sequence of PageRank 
uniform digraphs with prime outdegree and the degree sequence of PageRank 
uniform symmetric digraphs have been described [12]. For many scientific 
and engineering applications as well as security-related techniques, prime 
numbers are more crucial. There are various ways to determine whether a 
given integer is prime, but Fermat primality testing offers the highest level of 
certainty. Equations 1 and 2 provide evidence for Fermat’s idea of 
primality [13]. Researchers in the past have investigated the use of Cellular 
Automata (CAs) in a prime generation [14–17]. Following Equation 1, and 
Equation 2 as studied from [24] once again presented those that describe the 
Fermat Primality checking algorithm.
	
AP ≡ A(mod P)	
(1)
where P is a prime; A is a natural number.
Furthermore, if P * A  (A is not divisible by P), then some minimum 
exponent P is found such that
	
AP–1 ≡ 1 (mod P)	
(2)
where, AP–1 – 1 is divisible by P.
On the other hand, we find that complex systems may be dynamically 
modelled using ECAs, which is a mathematical technique. The CA architectures 
have a number of dimensions. This chapter focuses on elementary cellular 
automata, which are 3-cell structures with two neighbours (ECAs). There are 
Figure 2.  A typical diagram for a diagraph (as inspired from [12]).

How Can We Enhance Data Security in Digital Twin-Enabled IoT Networks  137
two situations involving boundaries. The first and last cells are connected 
in periodic boundary cellular automata (PBCAs); the first and last cells are 
grounded in null boundary cellular automata (NBCAs). The diagrammatic 
representation of PBCAs and NBCAs can be seen in Fig. 3.
As discussed in [18] there are few ECAs basics which are followed next: 
	 •	 Linear CAs rule: If the next state computing function is defined using 
XOR or XNOR logic, then it is considered as a Linear CAs rule.
	 •	 Non-linear CAs rule: If the next state computing function is defined 
using AND, OR logic, then it is considered as a Non-linear CAs rule.
	 •	 Homogeneous (uniform CAs): If every cell of the CAs configuration 
is applied with the same CAs rule, then it is referred to as Homogeneous 
(uniform) CAs.
	 •	 Heterogeneous (hybrid CAs): If two or more cells of the CAs 
configuration are applied with different CAs rules then it is referred to as 
Heterogeneous (hybrid) CAs.
Uses of ECAs for several scientific and engineering applications may 
be found in a number of different kinds of literature. Among them, the 
usefulness of an ECAs-based PageRank validation methodology in the Cloud 
was discussed in [19] with reference to the physical components’ low energy 
consumption. Furthermore, the suggested method by [19] guarantees improved 
performance for analytical and real-time internet traffic data analysis toward 
PageRank validation. It was further concluded in [19] that environmental 
sustainability depends on a system’s stability and energy efficiency. As a 
result, a PageRank validation model based on energy stability was described 
in [20]. The experiments were conducted in [19, 20] to demonstrate that 
MTCMOS flip-flops have the lowest power consumption and DT – TG 
flip-flops have the most. At 1.0 vdd and 2.0 vdd, it has been observed that each 
DT – TG flip-flops require 1.20 E – 05 watts (W) and 1.20 E – 0.5 watts (W), 
Figure 3.  A typical diagram for ECAs at different boundaries (as inspired from [20]).

138  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
respectively. Thus, it was concluded in [19, 20] that the ECAs-based model 
uses extremely low energy.
From our studies, though we have found several kinds of literature to 
upgrade the Blockchains, we still, did not find that a systematic study was 
ever presented to incorporate such modelling towards the construction of the 
energy-efficient simple construction and possible upgradation of existing 
Blockchain technology. For this reason, we find an opportunity to continue 
our research. 
The major contributions of our presented chapter are as followed. 
	 •	 It introduces a synergetic integration of several existing technologies, 
e.g., digraph, PageRank, and ECAs towards the possible enhancement of 
Blockchains. 
	 •	 It further presents a novel design towards an enhanced Blockchain 
involving the prime outdegree finding of PageRank regular digraph for 
superior data security in digital twin-enabled IoT networks. 
	 •	 An effective and easy implementation for the primality confirmation 
using Fermat’s theorem using Python 3.10.6 is presented in this chapter 
to verify the prime outdegree associated with the Blockchain network 
which ensures the time complexity of O(n * p2). 
	 •	 A python program using Python 3.10.6 is presented to find out the 
out-links for a node in a Blockchain network which ensures the time 
complexity of O(n).
The architecture of the remaining chapter is as followed. Section 
2 presents related works, Section 3 briefly describes the background 
works, Section 4 presents the proposed work; Section 5 presents the result 
analysis, and Section 6 presents the concluding remarks and future research 
direction.
2.  Related Works
A detailed discussion on CPS and DTs was provided in [1]. Further, an 
analysis of CPS and IoT focusing on the similarities, and differences as 
well as the relationship between them was enlightened in [3]. In addition to 
this, definitions of the DT concepts were also derived specifically in view 
of Industry 4.0 in [2]. Along with diving into the definitions of the DT, 
all-inclusive definitions of IoTs: ranging from localised to global systems, 
were presented in [4] with sufficient insights towards several IoTs architectures 
and their specific requirements. Further, a future research direction, key 
challenges and scientific problems in view of IoTs were briefly presented in 
[5]. We found that DT and IoT standards were investigated in [6] to stimulate 

How Can We Enhance Data Security in Digital Twin-Enabled IoT Networks  139
the consolidation of standards. Besides, the discussion of DT concerning 
challenges and solutions, a proper need was justified in [6] to address the 
security measures. Therefore, as a solution to secure DT’s sharable database, 
the usage of novel technology of distributed ledgers was introduced in [7] that 
suppresses integrity and confidentiality issues. 
Blockchain technology is the best example of a distributed ledger and 
hence we observe a rapid evolution of the Blockchain. The Blockchains and 
its importance in smart contracts was presented in [8]. Several attempts to 
enhance the Blockchains might be found in the literature. Among several 
others, we find, an enhanced consensus in Blockchain technology for 
Industry 4.0 was presented in [9]. We find that in [9], a proper justification 
was presented for the consideration of web PageRank in Blockchain networks 
toward the computation of reputation-based consensus. Thus, the PageRank 
algorithm was extended to provide this new consensus for DPoR (Delegated 
Proof of Reputation)-based Blockchain. The ECAs-based PageRank 
validation approach was utilised in [9] to accomplish this. The outdegree 
sequence of PageRank [10, 11] uniform digraphs [12] with prime outdegrees 
and characterisation of the degree sequence of PageRank uniform symmetric 
digraphs was discussed in [12]. The significance of PageRank uniform 
digraphs in the context of data security is discussed in [13]. An energy 
stability-aware strategy in ECAs-based PageRank validation model is proposed 
[18]. Researchers have placed a lot of emphasis on energy efficiency and low 
power usage in computers [19]. Thus, we observe the focus on energy-based 
PageRank computation and validation. The amount of content on a web page 
closely relates to its energy and page rank, as explained in [19]. 
In [18–21], several scenarios of PageRank, including stable traffic 
PageRank, increasing traffic PageRank, and decreasing traffic PageRank, 
were discussed. In [21], the RMT (Rule Mean Term) for the fundamental 
frame, increasing traffic, and decreasing traffic were considered. ECAs 
incorporation into the PageRank validation model added design simplicity 
and energy efficiency. An in-depth investigation of PageRank as well as 
the connection between page energy are presented in [21]. Additionally, a 
mathematical model of PageRank was discussed using discrete Green’s 
functions [27] presented in [21] which ensured energy efficiency. Several 
other literature available [28–32] may also be observed, which further 
focused on the emphasis on PageRank and other ECAs-based applications. 
As our research in the presented chapter is greatly influenced by the works of 
[18–20, 22], we choose to present them briefly in Section 3.

140  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
3. Background
As studied in [20], we find that websites are indexed (i.e., ranked) mostly 
based on the number of in-links and out-links. To facilitate the ranking  
(i.e., indexing of websites) several static and dynamic PageRank computation 
algorithms have been presented by researchers. However, after ranking any 
website, we find an argue to validate the computed PageRank [18–20]. We 
found that in [20], using D flip-flops, ECAs were employed to accomplish 
page ranking validation at a low cost. Based on Langton’s λ-parameter, ECAs 
rules at NBCA configuration were further investigated [20]. In addition to the 
significance of PageRank validation, a green strategy was also presented in 
[18–19] that preserved energy efficiency in the computed dynamic PageRank.
In [19], we observed a focus on environmental sustainability by ensuring 
energy efficiency in associated design. To ensure the system’s possible 
competence in validating PageRank using ECAs at a low-cost physical 
implementation, a few experiments were conducted and it was concluded 
that a change in energy causes a change in the PageRank of a web page, 
i.e., (∆Eweb page) α (∆ page rank) where, ∆Eweb page is referred to as change of 
energy for web page and ∆ page rank is referred to as change of PageRank. 
It also examined the relationship between the energy changes and the amount 
of change in stored information and finally presented the relationship that 
(∆Iweb page) α (∆Eweb page) where, ∆Iweb page referred to as a change of stored

Further, we observed from [18] that page traffic has a substantial 
influence towards the computation of PageRank. A web page’s bandwidth is a 
crucial component of its energy stability [21]. The average page load time for 
a website significantly influences its PageRank trends in the event of constant 
bandwidth [18]. As a result, an index named StabilityIndexweb page has been

employed to validate PageRank in terms of energy stability [18]. Equation 5 
explains Stability indexweb page of PageRank validation.

Another important aspect is data security where the application of 
Prime numbers may be observed. We found that CAs may be linked with the 
cost-efficient Primes finding method to improve data security and privacy. 
In [22], prime sequence generation using ECAs is provided as a flip-flop 
cost implementation of ECAs-based modelling. Here, the fixed boundary 
environment has been used to investigate the natural sequence of primes, or 
primes A000040, which improves data security and privacy. At an automaton 
with a size of 8, the first 50 numbers of the A000040 series can be explored. A 
hybrid ECAs produced by the ECAs rules 60 and 204 is discovered to produce 
every cycle in its transition diagram [22]. 
4. Proposed Work 
Based on the ECAs-based design as briefly discussed in Section 3, we 
presented a synergetic integration of several ECAs-based models to enhance 
the Blockchains. Figure 4 presents an operational flowchart that illustrates 
how energy-based PageRank towards enhanced Blockchain consensus 
is considered. The computation of out-links of a node and primality test 
using Fermat’s theorem as found in Fig. 5 and Fig. 8 that are described in  
algorithms 1, and 2. Firstly, the out-links of a node are calculated and it checks 
whether the number of out-links are prime or not using Fermat’s theorem. 
This helps us to ensure that the node has a prime out-degree. Algorithm 1 was 
designed to compute the number of out-links of a node. Algorithm 2 checks 
the primality of the output we got from algorithm 1. Table 1 contains the 
results we got on calculating the out-links of each node. 
Algorithm 1. Calculating the number of out-links in the given website
Input: URL for a website.
Output: Number of out links associated with that website.
1. Import BeautifulSoup and requests libraries
2. Set the URL of the web page to be scraped
3. Use the requests module to get the HTML content of the web page
 webpage = requests.get(url)
4. Extract the HTML content using the text attribute of the response object
 page_data = webpage.text

142  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
5. Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML content with the ‘lxml’ parser
  soup = BeautifulSoup(page_data, features = ‘lxml’)
6. Initialize a variable ‘cnt’ to 0
7. For each ‘a’ tag found on the web page: 
  for i in soup.find_all(‘a’)
  cnt = cnt+1 # Increment the ‘cnt’ variable
8. Print the total number of out-links found on the web page.

How Can We Enhance Data Security in Digital Twin-Enabled IoT Networks  143
In Fig. 4, the nodes (typically URLs of a website as suggested by [9] 
instead of real nodes of a Blockchain network) are considered to examine 
the number of out-links of each node is calculated and on the other hand, the 
ECAs-based prime numbers are generated. We request readers to go through 
[22] for detailed information regarding ECAs-based prime generation. These 
generated out-link numbers are passed through the Fermat Primality test (refer 
to Algorithm 2) for verifying for the second time whether they are primes. 
The final set of primes after the Fermat Primality test are called primes. The 
number of out-links ‘n’ of each node is now checked whether the ‘n’ is part 
of the natural primes. If yes, that particular node is further considered for 
Energy-based PageRank towards enhanced Blockchain consensus. 
Algorithm 2. Testing the primality of a number using Fermat’s theorem
Input: a file with odd numbers.
Output: a file with prime numbers from the given input.
  # Define the gcd function using Euclid’s algorithm
1. function gcd(a, b):
2. while b is not 0:
  temp = a
  a = b
  b = temp % b
3. return a
  # Define primalityTest function to check if a number is a prime
4. function primalityTest(p):
5.  for i from 1 to p-1:
6.    if gcd(p, i) is not 1:
        return 0
7.    else:
    if (i^(p-1) mod p) is not 1:
      return 0
8.  return 1
  # Open input and output files
9. file = input from command line argument
10. inp = open(file, ‘r’)
11. lines = read all lines from inp
12. f = open(“output.txt”, “w”)
  # Iterate through each line in the input file
13. for i in lines:
14.  if i is not equal to 1 and primalityTest(i) is true:
    f.write(i)
  # Close input and output files
15. inp.close()
16. f.close()

144  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
The above code is a Python program that reads a list of odd integers from 
a file and checks whether each integer is a prime number using the Fermat 
primalityTest function. If the integer is prime, it writes the number to a file 
called output.txt. The primalityTest function checks if a given integer p is 
prime or not by iterating over all possible values of a (1 ≤ a ≤ p), and checking 
if the conditions for primality are satisfied, namely if gcd(a, p) = 1 and 
ap–1 ≡ 1 (mod p). The gcd function is used to compute the greatest common 
divisor of two integers. The input and output images of Fermat’s primality test 
can be seen in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively. 
5.  Related Analysis and Results

code using algorithms 1 and 2 in Section 4 respectively. Figure 6 and Fig. 7

after executing the code using Algorithm 1. Table 1 presents the results on

calculating the out-links of each node (i.e., home page of each web site as 
discussed in [9]). 
Time Complexity of the Website Out-links Program
The time complexity of this code depends on the size of the web page being 
fetched and the number of hyperlinks in it. The find_all() method has a 
time complexity of O(n) where ‘n’ is the number of elements searched for. 
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n), where ‘n’ is the 
number of hyperlinks in the webpage.

How Can We Enhance Data Security in Digital Twin-Enabled IoT Networks  147
Time Complexity of Fermat Primality Test
The ‘primalityTest’ function has a time complexity of O(p2) where p is the input 
parameter. In the worst case, the range of the for loop in the ‘primalityTest’ 
function is from 1 to p – 1, so the time complexity of the function is O(p2). 
The time complexity of the ‘gcd’ function is O(log(min(a, b) )) where a, b are 
the parameters. The code reads the input file, which takes O(n) time where n 
is the number of lines in the input file. For each line, it checks if the number 
is not 1 and performs a primality test on the number, which takes O(p2) time. 
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the main function is O(n * p2).
Hardware Requirements
The hardware configuration used to perform the experiment consists of an 
Intel® Core™ i5-8250U CPU clocked at 1.60 GHz with a boost frequency of 
up to 1.80 GHz. The processor is a quad-core processor. The hardware has 
8.00 GB of installed RAM and equipped with 64-bit operating system and an 
x64-based processor.
We extensively considered different web sites as a replacement of nodes 
as suggested in [9]. The experimental results as achieved with our code (refer 
to Fig. 5) is presented in following Table 1.
The results towards prime out-degree finding involving our code (refer to 
Fig. 8) for those data of Table 1 are presented in the following Table 2.
From Table 2, it is observed that a decision toward prime out-degrees 
may be achieved at ease with a time complexity of O(n * p2) and at a reduced 
searching space (50% reduced searching space [22]). To explain it further, a 
simple illustration is presented next.
Illustration 1.
From Table 2, we observed that for “https://www.airbnb.com” (serial 31 of 
Table 1) has an out-degree of 3 which is a prime outdegree at a time complexity 
O(n) (refer Algorithm 1). The ECAs-based state time diagram as discussed in 
[22] is once again presented in the following Fig. 9.
As < 204, 60, 204 > at several
fixed boundary scenarios
From Fig. 9, we observed that all odd and even states have been separated 
within a few cycles. As, except for number 2, every prime number is an odd 
number, we may only focus on the cycles involving odd numbers. Thus 
overall, 50% of the states of Fig. 9 are required to consider only finding a 
prime number. Additionally, the transition diagram of Fig. 9 is independent 
of the boundary value conditions. Thus, it ensures cost-effectiveness. For a

more detailed insight into cost-effectiveness, we request the readers to go 
through [22].
6.  Conclusions
A novel approach with ECAs is presented in this chapter towards enhanced 
data security and privacy in Digital Twin-enabled IoT networks. A combination 
of ECAs-based two approaches targeting PageRank validation and prime 
finding are incorporated in the presented approach to strengthen Blockchains 
by ensuring prime out-degree in regular digraphs for Blockchain nodes at 
a simple and cost-effective implementation. Thus, a cost-effective primality 
finding in PageRank ensures “…privacy preserving release of digraph data 
in environments where a dishonest analyst may have previous structural 
knowledge about the PageRank score…” [12]. Additionally, the proposed 
ECAs-based approach is found to be an energy-efficient model [18, 19, 22] 
which ensures its application suitability for energy and resource-constrained 
IoTs. Additionally, ECAs-based design supports inherent parallel computing 
and capability towards chip fabrication [9, 16] which might be beneficial in 
IoTs-based applications.
To conclude this paper, we would like to emphasise that the presented 
chapter is confined to presenting a theoretical basis towards enhanced 
Blockchains in an IoT-based model towards Digital Twins. We plan to carry 
out a detailed experimental implementation with supporting trials in near 
future toward actual use cases.

A Secure Sensor Based Soil 
Nutrient Management System for 
Better Decision Making in 
Smart Agriculture
Usha Sri Peddibhotla
1.  Introduction
All across the world, soil is a crucial component of agriculture. The health 
of the soil and the plants growing within is significantly influenced by soil 
microbes. The intricacy of preserving healthy soil is increased by the soil 
bacteria, elevation, slope, climate, and other elements. Maintaining the 
nutrients in the soil increases the health of the crops by ensuring the health 
of the soil. When soil continues to function as a vital living ecosystem that 
supports humans, animals, and plants, it is said to be healthy soil. The health 
of the soil is impacted by excessive fertiliser use and ongoing irrigation 
techniques on the same piece of land over time. As a result, the soil’s fertility 
began to decline due to the health issues caused by over-fertilisation and 
irrigation. As a result, managing soil nutrients is an important part of the 
agriculture. As a source of plant nutrients, commercial fertilisers, manure, 
and organic by-products are applied as a part of soil nutrient management to 
agricultural landscapes. It places an emphasis on the next two possibilities 
that is, improving soil health and supplying crops with the nutrients they need.

Soil Nutrient Management using BC  153
In light of the aforementioned possibilities, soil nutrient management can be 
carried out in one of two ways: 
	 I)	 Real-time monitoring of the soil’s variables
	II)	 Managing soil toxicity 
I.  Real-time Monitoring 
Smart agriculture is created as a result of the incorporation of sensing, actuating, 
and computing technology into conventional agriculture. Ploughing, sowing, 
irrigation, fertilizers/pesticides, crop harvesting, and live animals are some 
of the steps that make up the smart agriculture system [1]. Most traditional 
farming issues, such as drought response, crop optimization, environmental 
concerns, pest control, over/under irrigation, and so on, can be resolved by 
integrating IoT, Agbots, drones, remote sensing, and AI into the various stages 
of smart agriculture.
Before planting the seeds of the intended crops and plants, the soil must 
be thoroughly examined and prepared. In order to determine the soil’s nutrient 
status and in order to implement numerous key decisions at various stages 
of soil ploughing and crop management, soil analysis and examination are 
crucial.
Sensing Technologies for Real-Time Monitoring of Soil Health
Soil sensors can keep an eye on the health of the soil. Instruments called soil 
sensors are used to keep track of soil moisture levels. They can be divided 
into sensors that keep tabs on pH, salinity, nutrition, conductivity, moisture, 
and temperature. Soil Sensors refer to all of these several instrument types as 
a whole.
Soil sensors measure the following variables
	 •	 Soil moisture 
	 •	 Soil temperature
	 •	 Soil pH 
	 •	 Soil NPK 
	 •	 Soil Salinity 
	 •	 Soil toxicity 
Soil moisture: Photosynthesis may be negatively impacted by a low-moisture 
soil. Since soil pores, contain both water and air, they are constrained by 
prolonged water scarcity, crops may wither and die as a result. Lack of 
moisture prevents plant roots from breathing, which causes rotting, which 
under extreme circumstances might cause plant death.

154  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Soil moisture sensors can be used to keep track of soil moisture. By 
analysing the data, prompt decisions about irrigation requirements may be 
made, ensuring that the soil has the right amount of moisture for crop growth.
Soil pH: Each plant has a preferred soil pH level, and most plants have 
difficulty developing normally when the pH is either too high or too low. For 
the growth of crops and to lessen the occurrence of pests and diseases, it is 
advantageous to use a soil pH sensor to detect the acidity or alkalinity of the 
soil. Testing the pH of the soil is therefore crucial for agricultural purposes.
Soil NPK: Because it is the main component of proteins, nitrogen is essential 
for the growth of fruit, leaves, and stems. In order to give plants, the nutrients 
they need and to encourage plant growth, soil NPK sensors can identify 
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other elements in the soil.
Soil salinity: The quantity of salinity in the soil can either encourage or restrict 
plant growth at varying rates, depending on the type of soil and the species 
of plant. The salinity of the soil can be determined using soil conductivity 
sensors.
The measurements of the data can be captured via sensors and follow the 
procedure below for the transmission and analysis of the data. 
Data collection: Soil sensors often have a sensing component that monitors 
a particular aspect of the soil, such as its temperature, pH level, electric 
conductivity, or moisture content.
Signal conversion: The sensing element transforms the observed data into 
electric signals, which are often converted to digital representation by the 
sensor’s internal circuitry for simpler transmission and processing.
Signal Transmission: Using cable or wireless communication techniques, 
digital signals are sent to a computer or controller.
Data processing: The computer or controller analyses and processes the data 
after receiving the digital signals in order to extract relevant information, such 
as the pH value, soil moisture, and temperature.
Device Control: The controller can automatically control associated 
equipment, such as irrigation systems and weather stations, based on the 
results of the analysis, enabling automated management.
Let us understand the flow through which the sensors are connected and 
how the data is captured using sensors. 
Wireless sensors gather precise root zone data from below ground as 
shown in Fig. 1, where real growth occurs, and send the data to the monitoring 
service, which transforms the data into useful information for the farmers. 

Soil Nutrient Management using BC  155
With this information, the farmers can now address their significant challenges 
and improve crop productivity and quality while lowering operational costs 
and water consumption.
A lot of agricultural information needs to be gathered district-by-district 
in order to create agricultural policies. Given the geographical diversity of 
India, where data must be separated and safeguarded for each state, the present 
security measures are insufficient to prevent data breaches and improper 
handling. The answer to it will be covered in the next section. 
II.  Managing Soil Toxicity 
For agriculture to produce enough food to feed the globe, productive soils are 
required. The building of persistent poisonous substances, chemicals, salts, 
radioactive materials, and disease-causing organisms in soils, which have a 
negative impact on plant and animal health, is referred to as soil pollution. 
There are several ways by which soil can be poisoned, including seepage from 
a landfill, industrial release into the environment, release of contaminated 
water into the environment, and overuse of pesticides.
Industrial effluent discharge into neighbouring wetlands and farmland 
fields is the main contaminant affecting the ecosystem. The sort of gases or 
liquids emitted, the type of soil, and the vegetation of the land that is irrigated 
all affect how industrial effluents are applied. Polluted soil can change 
physically and chemically during irrigation, reducing the amount of nutrients 
available to both the crop and the soil [2]. Any layer of the soil can become 
polluted, including the surface and subsurface layers, which is then classified 
as agricultural soil pollution. Urban activities also contribute to soil pollution.
The subterranean channels can identify the levels of pollutants by using 
IOT sensors. The first stage in implementing a control measure is recognising 
the pollutant. The most common indicator for determining soil toxicity is 
Figure 1.  Basic soil nutrient management.

156  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
the overall concentration of hazardous metals [4]. Due to the discharge of 
numerous industrial effluents, chemicals like mercury and carbon compounds 
are ingested by the soil. To detect soil pollution, sensors such as biosensors 
and soil NPK sensors are utilised, and the results are recorded in a data logger. 
This information will be displayed in the user interface for the activities 
related to agribusiness [5]. 
The introduction of IOT in the field of agriculture brought some challenges 
with it in terms of large data captured through real-time monitoring such as 
the following.
2.  Security Issues
	 •	 IoAT devices security: There are estimated to be 40 billion connected 
IoT devices. The IoT devices are resistant to a variety of threats. 
However, the drive for inexpensive, basic hardware jeopardizes hardware 
security. The most frequent hardware security risks for IoT devices are 
hardware Trojan and side-channel attacks, which restrict the widespread 
use of IoT networks in crucial applications. Hardware Trojans use 
adversary-made modifications to the hardware that are hostile and can 
be used as a backdoor to take over the machine and launch attacks. 
These are extremely difficult to identify, and some techniques include 
using electronic microscopic scanning on de-metallized chips, examining 
power delays in the circuit, and looking at the PUF, which serves as an 
electronic device’s distinctive signature. Another prominent hardware 
security risk is side-channel attacks, which exploit side-channel signals 
to retrieve private information like cryptographic keys. These problems 
are more common in IoT networks, and several fixes have been suggested 
[6, 7].
	 •	 Data privacy and security: Strong encryption techniques and security 
measures are required to guarantee data privacy and security during data 
transfers. The IoAT sensor nodes’ constrained design and supporting 
protocols make it challenging to implement security measures using 
current technologies. Therefore, protecting user privacy and data is a 
major concern for smart agriculture. 
	 •	 Big Data challenge: The sensors, actuators, and other IoAT devices 
will capture a substantial amount of random data. The usual approaches 
to processing this data are insufficient. It reduces concerns about food 
security and enhances the effectiveness of the entire supply chain in 
intelligent agricultural systems, it presents innovative business models, 
real-time decision-making, and predictive analysis [8]. Big data platforms 
for milk supply chain security have been integrated using support vector 
machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Data collection at 

Soil Nutrient Management using BC  157
various sensor nodes is the first step, and various data analysis techniques, 
including both conventional and big data analysis, are the last.
	 •	 Scalability and reliability: Depending on the size of the agricultural 
farm, different types of field sensors are needed. These sensors generate a 
varied amount of data which stresses the need for scalability in agriculture 
technology [5, 6, 11]. Cost will be reduced when the devices are reliable 
so that the number of redundant devices to accommodate fault tolerance. 
	 •	 Integration of Blockchain and IoT: To address the above-mentioned 
security challenges, The use of blockchain in the IoAT looks to be 
quite pertinent. Data security and privacy are critical aspects of smart 
agriculture that must be addressed for autonomous processes to function 
well. The blockchain processes transactions in reverse chronological 
order and makes use of cryptographic safeguards to preserve data integrity 
and guard against adversary attacks like Denial-of-Service (DoS) and 
False Data Injection. Other problems with data, besides privacy, include 
ownership and monetization. In contrast to centralised applications 
where the data is monetized by a central authority, blockchain-based 
applications can assist farmers in managing the data access at granular 
levels and can help in monetizing the data on their own. In a typical IoT 
design, the edge layer’s data is processed and stored in the cloud layer 
in order to carry out automated operations. The fact that the latency and 
access times in such networks fluctuate depending on network availability 
and the volume of access requests being sent to the server at any given 
time is one of their major downsides. Because decision-making requires 
real-time operations, the blockchain can aid in the creation of an effective 
real-time data-sharing paradigm. Some secure blockchain approaches for 
safe data sharing are put forth in [18, 19, 20, 21].
The schematic representation of a technological model introduces a 
thorough approach which solves various security problems from different 
perspectives. This model guarantees better soil nutrient management in terms 
of monitoring the soil nutrients in real time and reducing soil toxicity by 
alerting the concerned authorities. 
The participants included in this model are as follows:
	 •	 Farmers who have agronomic knowledge and update the data to the 
higher levels from the sensors. 
	 •	 Farming community authorities who collect data, suggest and decide the 
necessary technologies that are relevant to the problems raised.
	 •	 Other actors include the factory owners around the agricultural land, and 
agricultural authorities which also contribute to the services designed in 
the model.

158  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Our planned architecture has the layered architecture in Fig. 2, in which 
the services and functionalities of the proposed model are combined.
In the physical layer or perception layer IoAT devices are installed, 
which enable technicians or farmers to interact by entering information and 
requests. The processing layer communicates with the higher layer (IoT), 
filters data, and carries out control operations.
In Edge Layer, To handle the various operations in the architecture, 
information will be received from the higher layer. The IoAT instalment can 
differ depending on each design depending on the industry, type of cultivation, 
or environmental considerations. It must provide the help necessary for the data 
to be communicated to the installed blockchain in any case. Data immutability 
which can be gathered through secure IoT communication protocols is the 
goal of the combined use of blockchain and IoT.
Figure 2.  Layer-wise IoT Blockchain platform.

Soil Nutrient Management using BC  159
The IoT solution installed in each facility is connected to a blockchain 
that is integrated into the service layer. This layer is in charge of managing 
different local and fog networks, communicating data from each facility, and 
sending and receiving data to and from various top-layer applications.
In the Application layer, applications are designed as per the scope of the 
usage such as desktop, mobile, and office networks, through the use of chain 
codes to interact with the blockchain which is the link of each application with 
the blockchain. 
During integration of IoT with Blockchain, the following are the key 
functionalities that the IoT must perform:
	 •	 Capturing the data from the sensors.
	 •	 Installation of actuators for the purpose of human or actuator control 
using the User interfaces. 
	 •	 Develop user-friendly mobile and web interfaces so that the events are 
recorded accurately. 
	 •	 Deploying the data networks both locally and enabling sharing via the 
cloud and connected to the blockchain.
	 •	 Providing proper documentation and operating manuals. 
Blockchain networks improve IoT facilities by enhancing their features. 
They offer unchangeable digital records, data veracity, and the capability to 
create algorithms that establish relationship models. These smart contracts 
are algorithms that offer a highly potent tool to produce the aforementioned 
advantages. In terms of IoT, the facility can modify the blockchain’s design 
in some way. Nevertheless, it must offer the next features in each installation:
	 •	 Without relying on outside parties, verification is possible with blockchain 
technology.
	 •	 A blockchain’s data structure is appendable only. Since the transactions 
recorded in each block are hashed in a way that cannot be changed or 
deleted, the data cannot be edited or destroyed.
After the process of verification, all transactions and data are attached to 
a block and transactions are stored in chronological sequence. As a result, the 
blockchain’s blocks are all time-stamped.
	 •	 It is dispersed throughout all of the blockchain’s active nodes.
	 •	 The transactions included in the blocks are spread across several computers 
involved in the chain. It is decentralised as a result. Additionally, it 
guarantees that any deleted data can be restored.

160  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
	 •	 It lessens the chance of fraud or double entry.
	 •	 Companies can establish conditions using smart contracts. Only when 
software algorithms are used to create the circumstances, are automatic 
transactions activated.
The coordination of the many players’ actions and, on the other hand, 
the fundamental building blocks that the blockchain creates in accordance 
with the aforementioned functionality. It provides an overview of how the 
planned IoT Blockchain platform operates and how each component works. 
For using services like device and user registration, The app’s client offers 
a platform through which users can propose transactions to the blockchain 
network. Registration with a certificate containing the private keys to sign the 
transaction is necessary before submitting it. A transaction is the act of reading 
or writing data from the blockchain network. Different devices and authorised 
users (farmers and technicians) can submit a transaction to register a new 
device or create a new task. The operation request is sent to the blockchain 
network by the IoT facility. It can also send the client’s request to the device 
and receive status updates or sensing data from the device. The identification 
of the device’s owner is validated, and transactions can be submitted directly 
from that person’s smartphone. The status or sensor data is subsequently added 
to the ledger and compared to the smart contract parameters. A notification 
will be generated if the values recorded exceed specific thresholds.
Apps and communication interfaces allow device users (IoT, farmers, and 
others) to manage physical equipment without having any prior knowledge 
of them. Smart contracts are used to host the ledger functionalities over the 
network and allow controlled access to the data (Fig. 3). We also define an 
access control policy in the proposed platform, which permits users to access 
Figure 3.  Workflow of a transaction.

Soil Nutrient Management using BC  161
a set number of approved contents or transactions. For instance, access to and 
control of the gadget are only allowed by the owner. Data storage methods 
are utilised to handle a huge amount of IoT data because Hyperledger is not 
designed for large transaction data payloads. A unique database (DB) is used 
in the system. To support huge file storage and reduce duplication throughout 
the whole blockchain filesystem, this DB is present on each peer. The 
blockchain must be configured, as well as the appropriate data transmission 
procedures, user apps, and database structures. The model and organisational 
rules between participants are included in the setup of the blockchain and 
depend on the installation type and predetermined requirements.
The first step in creating a Hyperledger network structure for one’s 
application is listing the organisations of the participants. A security domain 
and a unit of identity and credentials exist within an organisation. It governs 
one or more network peers and is reliant on a membership service provider 
to issue identities and certificates to peers and clients for smart contract 
access privileges. The ordering network, which serves as the foundation of 
a Hyperledger network, is usually assigned its own organisation network. 
The sample network will consist of the following organizations: Farming 
community network, soil agriculture authorities, Industry owners and a state 
agency. The farming community periodically monitors the soil condition 
and updates the values to soil agriculture authorities. The authorities receive 
the data in the form of sensory signals and signals are transmitted to the 
edge layer. 
To maximise security and expenses, various entities are combined into 
a single entity. In the capacity of a client, an entity receives permission from 
its organisations to submit transactions or read the ledger state. As a result, 
the blockchain network needs numerous peers, each of which represents a 
separate company. There is also an ordering service, one MSP for each of the 
four enterprises, and the peers on the network. A Hyperledger ordering node 
that accepts order transactions implements the ordering service. Hyperledger 
ensures the accuracy of every block that has been verified by a peer using 
deterministic consensus techniques.
An alert message is delivered to the industry authorities, the farming 
community, and the irrigation authorities via the user interface whenever a 
query is uploaded for the purpose of checking the threshold values. 
3.  Challenges & Future Scope of Research 
The basic data characterisation of the soil can be used to determine the soil 
parameters at each field, such as the presence of rock fragments, bulk density, 
moisture, water content, carbon, salt, pH, carbonates, phosphorus, clay, 
sand, and silt mineralogy. Even though the blockchain offers a wide range 

162  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
of potential uses in smart agriculture to improve data security and integrity, 
there are still issues that must be resolved before this technology is widely 
adopted in the agriculture sector. The blockchain’s consensus mechanism and 
cryptography components demand a lot of power and computing, in contrast 
to IoT technology, which is resource-constrained in terms of both power and 
computation. Research is being conducted to develop a variety of effective 
consensus methods that can be used in these contexts with limited resources, 
such as in smart agriculture. Another key issue that must be solved for 
widespread adoption is data. Large amounts of data like photos cannot be kept 
on the blockchain since each block’s size is predetermined and constrained. In 
order to ensure secure access and data integrity, many researchers are striving 
to store data off-chain while also storing transaction and access metadata 
alongside the data on-chain.
Conclusion
 The following findings from the analysis, design, and first experimental 
prototype work support the benefits of the applied blockchain:
	 •	 The approach enables producers and agricultural technicians to take part 
in service design. 
	 •	 It provides data flow security and can even be included in business models 
of enterprises.
	 •	 It provides utilities for the improvement of internal procedures.
	 •	 It allows cost savings by applying smart contracts adapted to the 
commercial relationships of the network participants. 
Because it allows integration with automated installations, implementation 
expenses are not large.
This paradigm adds fresh demands and problems to be resolved. Software 
technology needs to be carefully planned in order to be incorporated into 
businesses without creating additional issues. The user interfaces and action 
items need to be extremely intuitive and appropriate for the way technicians 
and farmers operate. The platform must cover the cost of updating and 
maintaining it. There is a learning curve that needs to be climbed as well. 
Through the design and creation of a model and experimental platform, which 
are illustrated through a proof of concept, this study addresses some of these 
requirements and experimentation demonstrates the model’s advantages.

1.  Introduction
With the new conceptual framework of technologies for information and 
communications, the most popular innovation is Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. 
The “Internet of Things (IoT)” is a phrase that resulted from the practice of 
linking embedded items and things to the Internet. The infrastructure of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) consists of sensing devices, storage, computation, and 
connectivity, which together form a global and dynamic network architecture. 
An array of linked smart devices, such as detectors/sensors, smart devices, 
wearable/portable gadgets, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and 
others, are capable of serving as data gathering and broadcasting points with 
the network. Researchers envision an era in which Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices will be deployed in great numbers all around us, and create tremendous 
volumes of data without the direct participation of humans [2]. Nevertheless, 
in the next years, the field of Internet of Things (IoT) will likely become more 
appealing to academics as a result of the creation of new application areas that 
have the potential to significantly enhance our level of life [3].
The IoT encompasses a diverse range of applications, ranging from 
leisure and athletic pursuits, such as intelligent activity trackers, to 
mission-critical infrastructure, including healthcare, mobile devices,

communication technologies, and smart cities. The development of sensor 
technologies, cloud networks, and access technology providers, among 
other factors, has been a significant driving force for the emergence of these 
applications. As a consequence of this, enormous amounts of data generated by 
the Internet of Things (IoT) that contain information gathered from real-world 
sensors have dramatically raised the requirement for storage and computing 
facilities within IoT ecosystems in order to provide information or services 
[4]. IoT systems have the potential to manage simultaneous requests when the 
devices are grouped together in groups of several hundred, thousands, or even 
millions. This capability is needed by a variety of applications that demand 
prompt replies [5].
In order to have successful deployments of IoT, diverse communication 
structures need to be merged together. This involves combining smart gateways 
so that IoT devices may be connected to the internet. In recent years, the focus 
of research efforts has shifted towards interlinking the network infrastructure 
of the Internet of Things with technologies such as edge computing, cloud 
computing, fog computing, machine learning, and other similar technologies 
that enhance the possibilities of the IoT [6, 7]. Thus, the administration of IoT 
networks has become an incredibly challenging problem, and this difficulty 
will become much more complex in networks beyond 5G, namely 6G, owing 
to the enormous expansion of connected devices. As a result of these issues, 
researchers have come up with innovative methods for managing the Internet 
of Things, such as for security, scalability, energy management [8], load 
balancing [9], and fault tolerance [10]. In this chapter, the software-defined 
approach for the IoT is a major technological advancement in the realm of 
network technologies. The SDN simplifies network management by utilising 
Open Flow (OF) to physically isolate the network control from the data 
forwarding components and conceptually centralising it on high-end servers. 
The SDN framework proposes a hierarchical structure that comprises three 
distinct planes, namely the application plane which encompasses Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs), the control plane which involves a controller, 
and the data forwarding plane. The SDN controller bears the responsibility 
of upholding the complete processing network state and programmable APIs 
enable the control plane to prioritise, classify, and deprioritise network traffic 
in a systematic manner.
The goal of software-defined networking (SDN) is to make the architecture 
of the network more flexible with intelligence so that it can dynamically adjust 
to changes in the network environment at run time [11, 12]. Because of the 
high level of changeability inherent in an Internet of Things network, such as 
limits on battery life, computing power, and storage capacity, the network is 
required to adapt to specific demands as shown in Fig. 1. In light of the fact 
that the SDN architecture makes the administration of IoT networks a great 

Software-defined Networking for IoT  167
deal simpler, a significant amount of research effort is being directed in this 
particular area. There have been a number of research conducted to study the 
various IoT reference architecture models that rely on SDN for both current 
and future IoT deployments.
The combination of IoT with SDN (SDN-IoT) makes decoupling the 
control plane from the data plane and allows devices to be connected via 
the Internet. SDN offers the ability to make the IoT network scalable and 
programmable while also providing possible answers for the highlighted 
problems associated with IoT management. This can be accomplished without 
disrupting the fundamental architecture of any current implementations. In 
this chapter, the section furnishes an overview of Resource Management and 
Allocation, SDN Enabled IoT Scenario, and securing the Communication 
using Blockchain Technology.

Characteristics in IoT
With developments in technology (such as internet services, cloud computing, 
and terms of implementing, amongst others) and the incorporation of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) into a wide diversification of fields, a great number 
of definitions describing the IoT concept have been published by a variety 
of organisations and researchers [13]. Despite the fact that there are many 
different ways in which it can be defined, there are a few characteristics that 
are shared by all Internet of Things (IoT) systems.
The domain of research and development has witnessed a growing 
emphasis on the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent times. The Internet of 
Things (IoT) refers to a system of interconnected physical objects, devices, 
and equipment that are capable of communicating with each other through 
the internet. The establishment of this connection facilitates the acquisition 
and exchange of information in a synchronous manner. The topic of ensuring 
security for IoT has become increasingly urgent due to its exponential growth. 
There are several obstacles to overcome in order to ensure the safety of the 
Internet of Things (IoT), including the difference between connected gadgets 
and communication protocols, the high number of possible entry points, and 
the constrained computing power and memory of many IoT devices [14]. The 
security of IoT systems must be addressed at every layer, beginning with the 
gadgets themselves and moving all the way up to the applications that make 
use of the data that the sensors gather. The Internet of Things is composed of 
embedded technologies, each of which has limited access to certain resources. 
The presence of variability in sensors, connections, software, operations, 
and/or information is the primary trait that distinguishes it from other types of 
cloud environments [15]. In addition to this, the Internet of Things system’s 
network connection is dynamic and made up of a vast number of devices, 
some of which are permanently linked while others connect and detach 
intermittently over the course of time. This is due to efforts to save energy or 
fluctuating circumstances on the network. 
The difficulties with flexibility and interoperability might be heterogeneity 
in an Internet of Things. Because of this, it is hard to administer the network 
and exercise control over the vast and varied collection of devices that are 
connected to it. These devices use a variety of communication protocols 
to share different kinds of information with one another. In addition, the 
IoT system must be capable of adding new client devices, services, and 
functionalities without degrading the quality of the already existing network 
services. 

Software-defined Networking for IoT  169
SDN-IoT (Software-defined Networking - Internet of Things) Approaches
IoT technology is currently experiencing significant changes due to the 
exponential increase in the quantity of various kinds of devices that possess 
the capability to connect the internet.
Protecting such complicated networks and the many ways in which they 
may be accessed is a significant challenge that might result in an increased 
risk [16]. The SDN paradigm offers an alluring option for controlling the 
Internet of Things services that have lately come into focus [16, 17]. It is 
able to keep track of traffic in an intelligent manner and make use of network 
resources that are not commonly used [18]. Separating the control plane, which 
makes decisions about how to handle traffic, from the data plane is one of 
the benefits of software-defined networking (SDN) (real traffic transmission 
processes to desire locations). The decoupling encourages the abstraction 
of lower-level network operations into higher-level facilities, which makes 
it much simpler to handle the chores associated with network management. 
The planned outcome of development is a noteworthy enhancement of the 
network’s capacity, thereby rendering it more amenable for systems to fortify 
themselves against a potential data breach involving the Internet of Things 
(IoT). It would minimise inefficiencies, allowing for efficient processing of 
information provided by IoT without placing significant stress on the network, 
most notably the Wi-Fi network [19].
The combination of IoT with SDN (SDN-IoT) [20] creates the process of 
obtaining information, processing information, making choices, and decisions 
into action. The implementation of SDN-IoT enables monitoring and the 
management of network assets, as well as access management that varies 
according to user, organisation, device, and implementation. As a result of the 
development of SDN-IoT, networks stand to profit from an increase in their 
power to govern other networks and focusing on demand may become more 
scalable with the help of SDN. 
Resource Management and Allocation 
Recent challenges associated with resource management and allocation in IoT 
systems, as well as new research into potential solutions to the issues, shows 
us that in IoT systems, almost every resource, including multiple servers, 
transmission systems, and wireless resources, must be shared since they 
are utilised by a large number of activities and requests. It is of the utmost 
importance that the process of sharing designs is both efficient and successful. 
The computational time complexity, high propagation delay, narrowing of 
coverage, allocation of resource constraints, low power efficiency, security 
issues, and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that can be caused by 

170  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
inefficient resource allocation are the most obvious issues that arise on 
resource management.
The Problems with resource management and allocation are crucial for 
resource-constrained systems like the conventional Internet of Things, the 
analytical Internet of Things, and machine-to-machine interaction (M2M). 
Researchers typically use artificial intelligence (AI), Virtual machine (VM), 
machine learning (ML), and optimisation approaches in recent studies 
for resource allocation in these systems. These approaches aim to create 
high-efficiency, low-latency frameworks that can serve a large number of 
users and enable full use of resources available. The difficulties that may be 
encountered while using IoT systems are addressed in a variety of research 
and efficient strategies for overcoming these difficulties are established. Here, 
the Offloading operations make it possible for resource-constrained Internet 
of Things devices to carry out a variety of sophisticated and time-consuming 
tasks. IoT devices have a limited battery life, thus in order to run complex 
application functions, they rely on cloud computing or edge computing. 
The difficulty of picking one edge server to be offloaded among numerous 
edge servers may be solved by allocating resources. The utilisation of fog 
computing or edge computing may both be used for computational offloading. 
The ability to do more sophisticated tasks is one of the benefits offered by 
cloud computing, among other advantages. 
The fact that it is centralised and removed from the IoT devices makes it 
susceptible to breaches in security and data quality, as well as possible delays 
in processing times. As a result, processing in real-time is necessary, and the 
structure must be dispersed in order to accommodate applications and reliable 
data storage. 
SDN-IoT Based Resource Allocation
It has also come to light that the SDN controller is already familiar with the 
current condition of the edge server’s resource use. The implementation of 
a regulation that dynamically updates the flow table in the SDN controller. 
This rule determines how resources will be distributed from a particular edge 
server based on the application needs of each class. The OpenFlow switch’s 
flow table is updated to include the newly produced rule from when it has 
been created. The topology effectively partitions the control area from the data 
segments, thereby enabling adaptable network management and enhancing 
the performance of time-sensitive applications. The Identification of resources 
and allocation of those resources are both critical steps for computing in the 
IoT. At the step known as resource verification, the SDN controller collects 
information on the edge server’s available resources. In order to achieve the 
effective execution of each application in resource allocation, it is necessary to 

Software-defined Networking for IoT  171
have a solid understanding of the capabilities involved in resource allocation, 
resource information, and resource consumption.
Fog-IoT Structure with SDN
For the purpose of supporting IoT networks and applications, the system that is 
being suggested integrates the SDN paradigm with the fog computing notion.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the system relies on three tiers of hardware devices 
and network components. The initial layer of devices, representing either the 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices or the sensor layer, consistently generates 
data that necessitates transmission throughout the network. The second layer 
is commonly referred to as the fog layer, which assumes the role of deploying 
fog nodes. The aforementioned nodes facilitate a channel for data offloading 
and offer the diverse benefits of fog computing for the Internet of Things 
(IoT) network. The remote cloud unit represents the uppermost layer of the 
cloud. The cloud infrastructure for the Internet of Things offers assistance for a 
range of services and protocols related to IoT. The integration and connection 
of the Internet of Things cloud with other networks can be assisted by the 
service provider.
System Structure
The system structure is comprised of a number of stages; the authentication 
of the IoT node is the first stage since it is required to be approved. In order 
to get authorisation, the IoT node interacts directly with the IoT cloud to carry 
out the authentication procedure and name the device that has to be approved.
The identification of the address is the next procedure. The cloud makes 
a call to the service provider in order to find out where the IoT is located. To 
achieve this objective, the service provider contacts the SDN Orchestrator, 
who invests money to identify the IoT. In addition to this, the SDN orchestrator 
makes an estimate of the routing table, which includes a variety of alternative 
routing pathways between the IoT node and cloud, and it finds all Open Flow 
(OF) switches that are devoted to this connection.
The system relies heavily on the idea of resource utilisation, and as a 
result, it makes full use of all of the resources that are at its disposal. As 
a consequence of this, the SDN controller enables selected OF switches to 
do part of the processing and computing functions for the IoT data that has 
been transmitted after the fog level. The estimation of switches by the SDN 
controller is predicated upon the evaluation of specific factors that inform the 
availability of resources. The criteria under consideration includes IoT traffic, 
transit traffic, traffic access type, time delay limits, processing capability for 
serving IoT data, and the current condition of OF switches in terms of traffic 
and resources.

Figure 2.  Fog-IoT Structure with SDN.

Software-defined Networking for IoT  173
The feasibility of activating the IoT data segment resources of OpenFlow 
(OF) switches is ascertained by the software-defined networking (SDN) 
controller, which optimises the preceding parameters and subsequently 
communicates the selection to the switches. The orchestration process 
involves the creation of a virtual machine on selected OpenFlow switches, 
which will serve as a platform for data processing. The subsequent stage 
involves the migration of the database, which will occur upon the transfer 
of the foundation for facilitating the IoT group to the OF switch by means of 
the service provider of the IoT Cloud. The network’s functionality remains 
uninterrupted, and OpenFlow switches persist in gathering and synchronising 
data emanating from Internet of Things (IoT) devices with cloud-based 
storage.
Intelligent Resource Allocation 
There have been a few studies conducted of integrating the technologies of 
SDN, Fog computing, and IoT. As a result, with unique perspectives on this 
problem which has been investigated by taking into account many things 
including architecture, virtualisation, requirements, and standards, to acquire 
a new accomplishment in the integration of SDN, IoT, and fog computing 
technique.
In [20], the authors focused on the infrastructure setup and execution of 
a 5G open networking solution, the methodology of SDN/NFV-based 5G and 
IoT, as well as how AI/ML interacts with and learns from 5G/IoT. This article 
reviewed a number of sectors that have been improved by using AI/ML/DL 
methodologies to function as a resource or in order to provide to other sectors.
In [21], a framework for the construction of the Internet of Things was 
presented. This framework utilises the edge computation layer in the fog 
nodes. The SDN is implemented inside the framework, complete with a 
centralised controller and OpenFlow distributed switches. The switches exhibit 
a restricted capability in terms of both storage and memory. The operation 
of the network is based on an algorithm for unloading data, also known as 
load distribution. This method delegated all processing and computational 
activities to specific OpenFlow switches, which make use of idle resources. 
The technique that has been outlined provides a number of benefits for the 
IoT, including the reduction of delay and the increase in resource efficiency. 
The suggested technique has been shown to attain a high level of efficiency 
in terms of delay and resource usage, as shown by the experimental results 
obtained in the testing environment during the evaluation of the method.
In [22], a two-level hierarchical control system, consisting of a master and 
a slave, was established to solve the problem of bottlenecks that can be caused 
by the current level of the single-control plane, which is located on the remote 

174  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
IoT gateways. This is due to the fact that the current level of the single-control 
plane is on the remote IoT gateways. To achieve optimal control performance, 
a slave controller placement strategy has also been proposed as an option. In 
the end, a number of different tests were carried out in order to evaluate how 
effective the suggested MATLAB approach was. The results of comparative 
analyses indicate that the proposed approach reduces the crucial latency of 
managing the Internet of Things (IoT) by approximately 30.56%.
In [23], an innovative software-defined application was proposed. 
This application makes it possible to build an application which facilitates 
the construction of a malleable and responsive framework for exchanging 
information within the context of 5G-IoT. The infrastructure is designed 
using the SoftAir 5G system and is intended to improve the efficacy of 
data transmissions. In order to accomplish this goal, SoftAir partitions a 
software-defined wireless architecture into a control plane and a data plane. 
This allows for a more efficient coordination between millimetre wavelength 
(mmWave) and remote radio heads (RRHs), which are required for Internet 
of Things access. Subsequently, a novel architectural framework comprising 
SD-GWs and SoftAir local IoT controllers was released in order to facilitate 
the efficient administration of diverse IoT applications and the heterogeneity 
of IoT systems.
In [24], the goal of fog computing is to supplement time-sensitive Internet 
of Things (IoT) applications that need to meet low-latency requirements by 
supplying resources to cloud data centres that are located at the network’s 
edge. In order for the IoT-Fog network to successfully carry out the requests 
made by its users, it is essential to shield its resources and scheduling 
services from any potential threats that may arise. The implementation 
of suitable scheduling algorithms is crucial for effectively addressing 
the requirements of user applications and maximising the utilisation of 
IoT-Fog resources. SDN switches and controllers are able to function as cloud 
gateways and fog gateways in IoT-Fog networks. On the other side, SDN 
switches and controllers are more prone to being attacked by a wide range 
of threats, which makes the SDN controller a bottleneck and makes it simple 
to regulate plane saturation. This approach provides safeguarding measures 
for scheduling services to mitigate potential threats such as distributed denial 
of service (DDoS) and port scanning. The S-FoS technique is utilised for 
the purpose of enhancing security and optimising performance. It involves 
the implementation of anomaly detection algorithms based on fuzzy logic to 
accurately identify the origin of attacks and subsequently prevent malicious 
requestors from accessing the system. The experimental findings indicate that 
S-FoS exhibits a potential enhancement of 31% and 18% in response time, 
and 9% and 4% in network utilisation, in comparison to the NSGA-II and 
MOPSO algorithms, respectively. The aforementioned enhancements could 

Software-defined Networking for IoT  175
be attained through the manipulation of attack rates, the type of IoT devices, 
and fog devices.
SDN Enabled IoT Scenario 
Figure 3 depicts the framework and methodology of the SDN-enabled 
IoT Scenario in fog networks. The Internet of Things (IoT) may employ a 
dynamic structure to enhance network security by leveraging user contextual 
information, thereby mitigating and addressing cybersecurity threats at 
the network edge. The security framework is furnished with response and 
monitoring tools, and it employs novel algorithms and approaches to analyse 
and correlate threats from diverse sources, thereby enhancing security 
measures.
	 •	 Users/Fog Nodes: The Users/Fog Nodes offer the more powerful compute 
and processing resources for IoT devices are provided by the node. In 
contrast, the fog node facilitates the proximity of the cloud to the object. 
Nodes in the fog and at the network’s edge may take the form of switches, 
gateways, computers, or I/O devices. These nodes are responsible for 
providing storage, computation, and connection services. In addition, 
switches and controllers for SDN networks may be included inside them.
	 •	 Encrypted Flow rules: If unauthorised individuals gain entry, the 
information retrieved from diverse Internet of Things gadgets may 
comprise confidential data and potentially result in consequential 
ramifications. To clarify, the architecture has the capability to alter the 
data and does not ensure data security for devices that possess identical 
source files and hash keys. Prior to organising the data into blocks, the 
system employs encryption techniques such as AES-256, AES-128, 
or RSA to safeguard the confidentiality of the data and to fortify the 
system’s protective capabilities. The encryption technique employed can 
be modified based on the protocols governing key exchange and device 
configurations. Stated differently, the efficacy of encryption may be 
restricted by unauthorised access.
	 •	 SDN Controller/IoT Controls: The functionality of these modules is 
attributed to the utilisation of resources and security enablers. Both 
the Internet of Things (IoT) networks and software-based networks 
are accompanied by run-time operations that are implemented in their 
respective systems. To effectively handle connectivity across the physical 
infrastructure and the underlying virtual layer, a collection of dispersed 
SDN controllers that can interact with network components based on 
SDN is necessary. A fog node is capable of executing the tasks of an 

176  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
SDN controller, in addition to performing network operations and 
implementing flow rules for a diverse range of fog nodes and users.
	 •	 SDN/NFV Management/Orchestrator: The virtualisation of Internet 
of Things access network devices is a task assigned to the network 
layer. The concept of software-defined networking (SDN) enables 
the administration, monitoring, and management of networks to be 
automated and dynamic. This is achieved by separating the control 
operations from the data forwarding process. This layer is comprised 
of the SDN controllers as well as the SDN switches (i.e., OVS (Open 
Virtual Switches), OFS (Open Flows Switches)). The software-defined 
network controller (SDN controller) has the flexibility to be centralised 
or distributed depending on the needs of the network. The Security 
Orchestrator is responsible for making the decision of which enablers 
should be successfully implemented, taking into account the prerequisites 
Figure 3.  Framework of SDN Enabled IoT scenario.

Software-defined Networking for IoT  177
for security, the resources that are already available in the infrastructure, 
and the optimisation criteria.
	 •	 Service Provider: The Security Provider/Enabler with Interpreter is 
utilised in the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and 
Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) to identify the IoT-specific 
enablers and provide the implementation of necessary capabilities.
	 •	 Application Layer: The component is the architectural element that 
generates the primary attention from the end user. The application layer, 
situated at the top of the protocol stack, is accountable for managing and 
manipulating the data and information obtained. The application layer 
depicts the various applications or services that are part of the Internet 
of Things, including but not limited to Industrial IoT, Smart Households, 
Smart Buildings, and Smart Healthcare.
3.  Security and Privacy of SDN-IoT
With the unique characteristics of SDN-IoT, it is possible to directly use any 
of the current technologies for ensuring secure communications. This section 
examines the diverse range of IoT security solutions and evaluates the efficacy 
in safeguarding a computing environment.
Topology Management
For the functioning of IoT nodes, one of the operations that is considered to 
be amongst the most vital and crucial is known as Topology management. The 
creation of a graph that illustrates an abstract picture of the network nodes and 
the communication linkages between them is the objective of the topology 
control process. The primary use for this abstract representation is in making 
routing choices with the objectives of minimising congestion, cutting down 
on load, minimising latency, and optimising energy consumption.
Flow Management
Even though focus primarily on flows from devices to servers, due to the fact 
that this is the most typical scenario for SDN-based communications. The 
potential IoT flow within software-defined IoT pertains to the transfer of data 
between IoT devices placed in distinct partitions. The IoT flow that could 
potentially exist in software-defined IoT is the data flow between IoT devices 
that are located in different partitions. Here, Inter-region communication is 
required in order to plan out this particular kind of Internet of Things flow. The 
controllers exhibit collaborative functionality by utilising the corresponding 
switches to redirect the flow initiated from one area to an alternative entry 
point situated in a distinct area. In contrast to the communication and 

178  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
controller resources available in the region partition’s path from the controller 
to receiver, the path from controller to receiver within the partition exhibits 
lower throughput and delay. The reason for this phenomenon is attributed to 
the high density of Internet of Things (IoT) devices within the partition, which 
leads to an increased requirement for communication resources and a more 
intensive processing load on the associated controller.
4. Security Attacks in Communication
Attacks Based on Node Availability
A rogue IoT node might appear as a legal one in order to share and gather the 
data that is created by other IoT devices for the aim of committing further 
acts of harmful activity. The rogue Internet of Things nodes have the ability 
to abuse the data of users or to give harmful data to surrounding nodes, which 
may disturb the behaviors of those nodes. The complexity of trust management 
across the many schemes in the IoT might make it difficult to find a solution to 
this challenge. On the other hand, a trust measurement-based strategy might 
be used to identify rogue nodes in IoT settings, which could provide some 
protection against potential security threats.
Attacks Based on Confidentiality
The IoT scenario incorporates a broad range of gadgets and sensor systems 
that are associated with a number of different SDN controllers. There is no 
reliable system in place that can determine when and how to place confidence 
in IoT devices. Given the absence of a trustworthiness evaluation, individuals 
utilising Internet of Things (IoT) services must evaluate whether it would be 
financially advantageous to abstain from certain IoT services. Establishing 
a trustworthy environment among the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a 
crucial element in ensuring secure settings and preserving the integrity of 
IoT services. As a result, creating an environment of trust among Internet 
of Things devices is one of the most important aspects of setting up safe 
settings in order to maintain the integrity of Internet of Things services. There 
have been various situations, such as social media platforms on the internet, 
in which trust models that are based on reputation have been effectively 
implemented. To create a trust model in the IoT that is based on reputation, 
they have to address how to maintain availability, and reliability, and how to 
avoid adverse malfunctions, how to correctly identify malicious behaviour, 
and how to automate assembling a security framework based on reputation in 
large-scale networks.

Software-defined Networking for IoT  179
Attacks Based on Authenticity
Authenticity is a fundamental need for ensuring the safety of Internet of Things 
devices. However, many of the devices that make up the IoT do not have 
the space or processing capacity to carry out the encryption processes that 
are necessary for security mechanisms. These devices with limited resources 
have the ability to outsource their complex calculations and storage needs 
to a fog device, which will then carry out the authentication procedure. The 
strategy ensures that all communications are kept private by using a public 
key together with multicast authentication. 
Attacks Based on Integrity 
The messages created by IoT devices are sent to the fog nodes that are logically 
the closest to them. With the Internet of Things devices, it poses a challenge to 
handle a vast amount of data. The data is first segmented into different pieces 
before being sent to a number of fog nodes for processing. At this stage, the 
contents of the data need to be evaluated without the data itself being exposed. 
It is essential that the data’s integrity be maintained whenever it is combined 
with previously transmitted and processed information. Encryption methods 
or masking techniques are able to encrypt or decrypt data on an Internet of 
Things device with devices that have limited resources. 
Attacks Based on Non-Repudiation
Data aggregation, Key management, and verified computing are a few of 
the additional security difficulties that must be overcome. Despite this, the 
distinct qualities of fog computing have the potential to make a contribution 
towards resolving concerns relating to the user’s privacy and data security 
in IoT contexts. The Internet of Things (IoT) systems are susceptible 
to a variety of attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and 
malware-based attacks, which are among the most frequently encountered 
types of attacks. Additionally, fog computing may serve as a constituent of 
the security mechanism that guarantees the immunity of IoT services against 
such attacks. In the event of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the extensive 
distribution of fog nodes may potentially aid in preserving the resilience of 
IoT services.
5.  Secure Communication using Blockchain Technology
The combination of fog computing and the IoT makes it possible to provide 
services at the network’s outermost layer, such as computation and storage, 
which reduces response latency and enhances the user experience. The 
dynamic properties in terms of time and location of the data that is detected 

180  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
by IoT devices define the deployment of fog nodes as a programming problem 
with an uncertain solution. The purpose of the optimisation effort is to reduce 
the amount of power that is sent, and blockchain technology [25] is given as a 
means of finding the best answer. In order to assess the algorithm, we execute 
a series of simulations, and the results demonstrate that it offers superior 
performance compared to the baseline approaches. 
The IoT’s growth has accelerated quickly in recent years, and security 
concerns have grown as a result. The insecure nature of the communication 
that takes place between different Internet of Things devices is one of 
the security issues that might develop on the nodes or communication 
channels/pathways.
6.  Conclusion
In this chapter, the design and execution of an IoT system have been carried 
out with the assistance of SDN technology so that the findings may be 
compared. The various communication methods and intelligent resource 
allocation algorithms for the IoT system are discussed here. In the meanwhile, 
the Internet of Things system that incorporates blockchain technology makes 
use of a decentralised blockchain network’s platform as a trusted central 
authority. In addition, the data that users want to store and retrieve from the 
blockchain network may be done with the use of intelligent contracts. It is 
possible that the IoT system does make use of blockchain technology, which 
has a higher level of security.

1.  Introduction
With the increasing reliance on cloud-based services and the widespread 
adoption of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), the threat landscape for 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks has become more complex and 
challenging. DDoS attacks can cause significant disruptions, leading to service 
unavailability, financial losses, and reputational damage for organisations 
[1–18]. Therefore, developing effective mechanisms for early detection and 
the prevention of DDoS attacks in the context of NFV is crucial. NFV provides 
a flexible and scalable infrastructure for deploying and managing network 
services by virtualising network functions. However, the virtualised nature of 
NFV introduces new vulnerabilities and attack vectors that DDoS attackers 
can exploit. Traditional DDoS detection and prevention techniques designed 
for physical networks may not be directly applicable in the NFV environment.

1.1  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV)
NFV is a concept of architectural framework; the main aim of NFV is to 
transform traditional networking hardware components into software-based 
applications. In conventional networks, network functions such as firewalls, 
routers, load balancers etc., are implemented on specialised hardware devices. 
This approach often leads to complex and inflexible networks, making 
introducing new services or scaling existing ones difficult. NFV addresses 
these challenges by leveraging the principles of virtualisation to create 
virtualised network functions (VNFs) [4].
1.1.1  Architecture of NFV
Only two levels of the architecture of NFV is mainly divided into four layers: 
Network Function Virtualisation Infrastructure (NFVI): This layer 
represents the underlying hardware resources, including servers, storage 
devices, and networking infrastructure, which form the foundation for 
hosting, managing and executing virtualised network functions (VNFs). 
NFVI includes hardware resources, a virtualisation layer or hypervisor, and 
virtual resources. Through the virtualisation (hypervisor) layer, hardware 
resources such as computation, storage, and networking provide processing, 
storage, and communication to VNFs. Computing, storage, and networking 
are abstracted from the hardware layer by the virtualisation layer and made 
available as virtual resources. Virtualised Network Function (VNF): These 
are represented as software instances running on the NFVI. VNFs can include 
network functions such as firewalls, routers, load balancers, or intrusion 
detection systems. For example, it can also be called DHCP server VNF when 
the DHCP server has been virtualised and Firewall VNF. When the router has 
been virtualised, it can be referred to as Router VNF; when a base station is 
virtualised, it is referred to as Base Station VNF [2].
Operation Support System/Business support system (OSS/BSS): OSS 
covers all aspects of network administration, fault management, configuration 
management, and service management. Among other things, BSS manages 
orders, products, and clients. Using standard interfaces, an operator’s decoupled 
BSS/OSS can be integrated with the NFV Management and Orchestration 
in the NFV architecture. The Management and Orchestration (MANO) 
Layer contains two components: Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM) 
component controls which manage the virtualised resources within the NFVI. 
It communicates with the NFV-I and provides interfaces for VNF managers 
to manage the virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage resources 
required for VNF deployments. VNF Manager (VNFM) is responsible for 
the lifecycle management of VNFs. It interacts with the NFVO and VIM to 

184  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
deploy, monitor, and scale VNF instances according to service requirements. 
It acts as the central orchestrator of the NFV architecture. The NFVO receives 
service requests and translates them into specific VNF deployments and 
configurations across the NFVI. It coordinates with the VIM, NFV-I, and 
others.
1.2  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack
Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber threat that mainly affects 
system availability. Multiple systems of attackers are used to flood a large 
amount of traffic to a targeted website or network, overwhelming it and causing 
it to be unusable to its users. In DDoS attacks, the attacker typically controls 
a network of compromised computers called a botnet. These compromised 
computers, often infected with malware, are used to send massive traffic to 
the target simultaneously. This flood of traffic consumes the target’s resources, 
such as bandwidth, processing power, or memory, causing it to slow down or 
sometimes crash.
DDoS botnets play an essential role in DDoS attacks. A botnet is a 
collection of hundreds or thousands of machines, often known as zombies 
or bots, that hackers have commandeered. The attackers will harvest these 
computers by identifying weak places they may infect with malware via 
phishing attacks, malware attacks, and other techniques for mass infection. 
The hijacked machines may be ordinary home or business PCs, DDoS devices, 
or even an army of hacked CCTV cameras (the Mirai botnet is notorious for 
constructing such an army), and their owners are probably oblivious of the 
situation because they continue to function normally in most other respects. 
DDoS assaults fall into one of three categories, which are primarily defined 
by the sort of traffic they direct at their targeted systems:
	1.	 Volume-based attacks: utilise a lot of fake traffic to overburden a server 
or website’s resources. Examples include TCP/UDP floods and ICMP 
floods. The size of this traffic is measured in bits per second (bps).
	2.	 Protocol or network-layer DDoS attacks: Sends many packets to your 
chosen infrastructure management tools and network infrastructures. PPS 
(packets per second) units measure the scale of these protocol attacks, 
including SYN floods and Smurf DDoS.
	3.	 Application-layer attacks: These attacks target specific applications or 
services on the target server. They aim to exhaust server resources by 
exploiting vulnerabilities in the application layer. Examples include HTTP 
floods and DNS amplification attacks. The units used for measuring are 
RPS (request per second).

Dynamic Threshold-based DDoS Detection and Prevention  185
Some of the essential methods applied in all DDoS attack types include:
	1.	 Spoofing [1]: The act of an attacker altering or concealing header data 
that should identify the source of an IP packet is known as “spoofing.” 
Because it cannot see the packet’s trustworthy source, the victim cannot 
prevent attacks from coming from it.
	2.	 Reflection: The attacker may use a false IP address to make it look like 
a packet came from the intended target while sending it to a third-party 
system that responds to the victim. As a result, it is far more challenging 
for the victim to identify the attacker in an attack.
	3.	 Amplification: It is possible to mislead some internet services into 
responding to packets with several or massive packets [4].
1.3  System Architecture
The system architecture involves several key components that work together 
to enable the virtualisation and management of network services. Here’s an 
overview of the entire system architecture. Infrastructure includes hardware 
resources such as servers, storage devices and network equipment; these 
resources provide the foundation for the whole system that runs virtually. The 
system then has a Hypervisor in which the clusters and the VMS are placed; 
these all are located in the virtualisation layer. In the management layer, the 
Figure 1.  Architecture of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) [15].

186  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
VIM, NFV orchestrator, and VNF Manager will be present, followed by 
the network layer Physical Network Infrastructure: The physical network 
infrastructure includes routers, switches, and other network devices that 
provide connectivity and transport for network traffic between the virtualised 
environment and external networks. 
Virtualised Network Infrastructure: This refers to the virtual networks and 
overlays created within the NFV environment. These virtual networks connect 
the VNFs and provide logical connectivity and isolation between different 
network functions and services. The topmost layer will be the service layer. 
Network services are the end-to-end services offered to users or customers, 
such as virtual private networks (VPNs), software-defined wide-area networks 
(SD-WAN), or network security services. These services comprise multiple 
VNFs orchestrated and managed by the NFV infrastructure. On the top of the 
service layer, various nodes are created where traffic is stored and analysed. 
These nodes play a significant role in detecting the attacks. 
Our key contributions to this chapter are the following:
	1.	 NFV is an architectural framework and concept that aims to virtualise and 
consolidate various networking tasks and functions that traditionally rely 
on dedicated hardware devices. 
	2.	 The papers have proposed a methodology for state-of-the-art research to 
mitigate DDoS in the NFV environment. However, in this chapter, we 
are the first to attempt to integrate NFV and OpenStack (An open-source 
software platform providing a cloud computing infrastructure) to detect 
and prevent DDoS attacks in the Digital Twin Environment.
	3.	 Research ideas until now focussed on employing multiple routers or 
creating a virtual server that acts as a filter to control traffic. However, 
this chapter addresses the attempts to control the traffic with only some 
additional variables to optimise resource utilisation and minimise the 
cost. We were the first to use a dynamic threshold-based algorithm to 
control network traffic.
Figure 2.  System architecture.

2.  Related Work
Many studies have focused on preventing DDoS attacks in environments 
like traditional networks, SDN, and NFV. Based on the type of Networks, 
the researchers have developed different kinds of models in multiple settings 
for detecting and preventing DDoS attacks. In light of this, researchers have 
become increasingly interested in virtual networks and virtual environments 
as part of this tremendous change from traditional networks to virtualisation. 
Girma et al. [4] provided a hybrid mitigation technique for virtual networks 
to identify DDoS assaults in cloud computing settings at the network and 
host levels. They used entropy and covariance matrices. Li, Wang [5] 
Defence architecture against DDoS assaults is called CODE, and it uses 
network virtualisation and software-defined networking to implement its 
functionalities to identify and stop attacks. In particular, the framework can 
ease the strain on nodes whose traffic exceeds the maximum their self-defence 
mechanisms allow. The framework also includes a technique for managing 
resources online that balances participants’ fairness and resource consumption 
efficiency across the board. Of course, this framework from the present still 
has certain underdeveloped areas. For example, it is designed for SYN flood 
attacks and does not consider broader DDoS attacks. Our proposed system 
can mitigate almost all types of traffic-related attacks, which deal mainly with 
the availability of the servers.
Yang [10] proposed a methodology called VFence that mitigates the 
DDoS attacks in the NFV. Using Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) 
technology, VFence protects against DDoS attacks by intercepting packets, 
confirming their legitimacy, and protecting the server; it employs network 
agents. This method can effectively thwart DDoS attacks by serving all legal 
requests, according to simulation data; here the Dispatcher plays a vital role in 
load balancing or sharing traffic to the free servers, but in the proposed system, 
there is no load balancing to the servers, monitoring the traffic and based 
on the analysis of the traffic sends alerts and sometimes ends up blocking 
the source node for a certain amount of time. The DDoS defence system, 
Figure 3.  OpenStack architecture within controller.

188  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
which includes attack detection and mitigation and might be implemented 
in the network domain, was developed by Fayaz [6] and demonstrated the 
elements and the purest process that a whole defence system should have; 
we intend to utilise it as one of the examples. To mitigate different DDoS 
attack combinations, one must dynamically detect them, design a responsive 
resource management algorithm that is 4–5 orders of magnitude faster than 
the state-of-the-art solvers at the time, deploy an industrial-grade SDN/NFV 
platform and experiment with 10 Gbps attack traffic. 
The 
responsiveness, 
resource 
utilisation 
effectiveness, 
and 
multi-functionality of the above functions need to be revised for this. 
However, it sets the standard route for all DDoS defence systems after this. 
In the few years after the release of Bohatei, many DDoS defence systems 
based on software-defined networking and network virtualisation have come 
out one after the other. Dynamically creating and destroying the agents for a 
scalable and flexible system based on the density of traffic was developed by 
Bahman Rashidi [13]. Reference has been taken from this unit for creating 
and destroying the nodes in the NFV environment dynamically based on the 
requests and traffic flow.
3.  Proposed Model
NFV is a technology that enables the virtualisation of network functions, 
allowing for deploying and managing network services on virtual machines or 
containers. However, the virtualised nature of NFV also makes it vulnerable 
to DDoS attacks, which can disrupt or disable network services. Preventing 
DDOS attacks on NFV requires a comprehensive defence strategy that includes 
techniques such as the filtering and diverting of traffic, alerts and alarms, and 
limiting the incoming traffic rate. The main aim is to stop malicious traffic 
before it enters the virtual server environment. Based on this, a model was 
proposed to protect the NFV environment from DDOS attacks. The proposed 
model will detect an attack in the early stages, send warnings to the source 
nodes, and then block the traffic for a particular time interval.
3.1  Proposed Algorithm Assumptions
Before algorithm initialisation, we assume a few parameters which may be 
used in the future. These parameters are:
	1.	 Global Threshold value
	2.	 Global Timer value
	3.	 Local Timer value

Dynamic Threshold-based DDoS Detection and Prevention  189
	4.	 The local Counter value (By default set to ‘0’) 
	5.	 Local Limit value
Step 1: In the initial stage, the server accepts any number of requests until the 
global threshold value is crossed. The global timer (in seconds) indicates how 
long the server will perform steps 2 and 3. Only when the number of requests 
on the server exceeds the global threshold value does the server start its global 
timer and move to the next step.
Step 2: In this step, the initial scanning of nodes will be done. The server 
will identify the total requests sent by individual nodes during the Global 
Threshold break. After scanning, the server will set a limit for each node 
to the initial assumed Local Limit value. The server will calculate a local 
threshold (number of requests) value to each node such that each threshold 
value = 90% of the original number of requests sent by the node at the end of 
step 1. The server will set a counter value for each node to the initial assumed 
Local Counter value to track the number of times the node has crossed its local 
threshold. The server will also set up a local timer for each node to initially 
assume a Local Timer value to indicate the amount of time (in seconds) the 
node will be banned if it ever crosses the limit.
Step 3: The server will perform a DDoS prevention algorithm (Judge and 
Police) on each node that crosses their local threshold. The result of the Judge 
and Police algorithm can be either:
	1.	 The server will detect a node sending too many requests (Or) 
	2.	 The server will slow down the number of requests sent from that node.
	
•	 In the 2nd case, we move on.
	
•	 In the 1st case, the server will increase its local counter value and reset 
the global timer. We then check if Local Counter crossed the Local 
Limit value; if yes, we orange list the node and warn neighbouring 
networks. After the limit is crossed, the server will stop accepting 
requests or, in other words, ban the node for its given time (the local 
timer variable). If the same node is orange listed for more than its Local 
Limit value, the server will stop accepting responses permanently. 
After the local timer reaches 0, it resets itself such that the value now 
will be twice as before. Also, the local timer will never reset to the 
original value. If the global timer reaches 0, then the server will reset 
the variables and move to step 1.

190  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
In Fig. 4, let’s consider a scenario where the VM which is acting as a 
server, can only receive 1,111 requests before going down. We set this server’s 
Global Threshold Value to 90% of the total number of requests it can receive
 • G_th = (1111/100) * 90 ≈ 1000 requests per second 
	 •	 Global Timer value: G_t = 200 seconds
	 •	 Local Timer Value: L_t = 60 seconds
	 •	 Local Counter value: L_c = 0
	 •	 Local Limit value: L_lim = 4
Step 1: Let’s consider that the other VM instances start sending requests to 
the VM se. The server accepts any number of requests per second until the 
Global threshold is reached. Once the number of requests crosses the Global 
threshold value, which in this case it does because of the DoS VM, the Global 
Timer starts.
Step 2: Until local threshold values are calculated, the server stops accepting 
responses. Let’s say the Dos VM is node A, the ordinary VM at the home 
network is node B and the ordinary VM at the neighbour network is Node C. 
Let’s say the number of requests sent by Node A: R_A = 750. The number of 
Figure 4.  A NFV network scenario that defends against DDoS attacks on the target using 
multiple agents.

Dynamic Threshold-based DDoS Detection and Prevention  191
requests sent by Node B: R_B = 100. The number of requests sent by Node 
C: R_C = 150
We calculate the local variables for each node that sent a request at the 
time when T_g is crossed:
	 •	 L_th_A: 0.9 * (R_A) = 0.9 * 750 = 675
	 •	 L_th_B: 0.9 * (R_B) = 0.9 * 100 = 90
	 •	 L_th_C: 0.9 * (R_C) = 0.9 * 150 = 135
Now the server again starts accepting responses and we move to step 3.
Step 3: Node A again sends a huge number of requests but now since we have 
the local threshold value for each node, we check if R_A > L_th_A. If yes, 
then we perform a judge and police algorithm. This tries to slow down the 
number of requests that are being sent, but fails as it is a DoS node so then we 
increase Local Counter, L_c by 1 and the Global Timer is reset to its initial 
value. We then check if the Local counter, L_lim < L_c. If yes, then the local 
timer starts, we stop accepting responses from Node A, orange list Node A 
and send a warning about Node A (it’s IP address) to neighbour networks. It 
should be noted that all of this is happening while the global timer is running 
and we stop accepting any response from Node A until the Local Timer sets 
to 0. Once the Local Timer is set to 0, it resets to twice the initial value. This 
Figure 5.  Detecting DDoS attack.

192  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
cycle will repeat until eventually Local Timer > Global Timer. At this point, 
the server will move again to step 1. If Node A gets orange listed more than 
the local limit value, we will stop accepting requests permanently. This is how 
we make a DoS node incapable of sending requests.
3.2  To Detect DDoS Attack
Traffic enters into the NFV environment and then its nodes where it is organised 
according to the sources. The threshold is calculated for requests per second 
after the current threshold crosses the global threshold value the detecting 
algorithm encounters. The algorithm first calculates the density of each node 
and sets up a local threshold value for each node. If a node crosses its local 
threshold value when sending a number of requests, then the police algorithm 
runs for that node and the counter is raised by 1. Now we have a limit variable 
declared local to each node which indicates the limit for the number of times 
the local threshold value is crossed. After each time a node crosses the local 
threshold, we check if (counter > limit). If yes, then we orange list that node. 
It gives a warning to the source that the traffic is more. Then after the node 
value crosses the limit it blocks the traffic for a certain amount of time and 
concludes it as the attack. Figure 6, shows the steps to detect a DDoS attack.
Figure 6.  Flowchart shows the operations of the proposed method to detect DDoS attacks using NFV.

in Digital Twin Environment
A flowchart is a visual representation of a process or algorithm using different 
symbols and connectors to depict the sequence of steps. It is commonly used 
in computer programming, software engineering, and process documentation 
to illustrate the flow of control or the logical structure of a program. 
Flowcharts consist of various shapes or symbols that represent different 
actions or decisions. Following the flowchart from the start symbol, one can 
understand the sequence of actions and decision points to reach the desired 
outcome. The flowchart uses arrows or lines to connect the symbols and show 
the flow of execution from one step to another. Arrows indicate the direction 
and sequence of the process or decision-making. Flowcharts are an effective 
way to visualise complex processes, identify potential bottlenecks or errors, 
and communicate the logic of a program or system.
4.1  Digital Twin Environment to Detect and Prevent DDoS
Case 1 - Attacker node in the same Network: 
The Attacker node/VM attacks our VM/node. The VM detects a DoS attack 
from this VM/node. Now the VM blocks the attacker node, and the VM sends 
the signal to the local router. The router sends a warning about this node to its 
directly connected neighbours.
Case 2 - Attacker node in a different network:
The VM detects a DoS attack from this VM/node, and the VM blocks the 
attacker node. The VM sends a signal to the local router about this node to 
its directly connected neighbours. Finally, the attacker network’s local router 
turns off the attacker node.

4.2  The 3-way TCP Handshake Procedure
The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake is a three-step process to 
establish a connection between two devices in a TCP/IP network. It is essential 
to the TCP protocol suite and ensures reliable and orderly communication 
between the sender and receiver. Let’s go through each step of the TCP 
handshake:
Step 1: SYN (Synchronise)
The initiating device, often called the client, sends a TCP packet with the SYN 
(synchronise) flag set to the receiving device, the server. The packet contains 
a randomly generated sequence number (ISN - Initial Sequence Number) to 
start the sequence numbering for data transmission. This step indicates the 
client’s request to establish a connection and synchronise sequence numbers 
with the server.
Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronise-Acknowledge)
Upon receiving the SYN packet, the server sends a TCP packet with the SYN 
and ACK (acknowledge) flags set. The server also generates its own ISN 
and acknowledges the client’s ISN by incrementing it by one. This packet 
confirms the receipt of the client’s request and indicates the server’s agreement 
to establish a connection.
Step 3: ACK (Acknowledge)
In the final step of the TCP handshake, the client sends an acknowledgement 
packet back to the server. The packet has the ACK flag set and acknowledges 
the server’s ISN by incrementing it by one. The connection is established now, 
and both devices are ready to exchange data [5]. After the TCP handshake is 
completed, data transmission can begin. The sequence numbers established 
during the handshake are used to ensure that packets are delivered in the 
Figure 8.  Network cluster diagram after the DDoS detection mechanism in DT.

Dynamic Threshold-based DDoS Detection and Prevention  195
correct order and to detect and recover from any packet loss or errors during 
transmission. When the communication is finished, a similar process called 
the TCP connection termination or teardown occurs to close the connection 
gracefully.
OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that provides 
software tools for building and managing public and private clouds. It allows 
users to control and allocate computing, storage, and networking resources 
through a centralised dashboard or API. OpenStack is highly flexible and 
scalable, making it suitable for building public, private, and hybrid cloud

environments. It promotes interoperability and avoids vendor lock-in by 
adhering to open standards and providing an ecosystem of compatible 
solutions. OpenStack is used by organisations of all sizes, including 
enterprises, service providers, research institutions, and government agencies, 
to create and manage their cloud infrastructure [9].
5.  Test Evaluation
This section primarily describes the evaluation of various testing scenarios 
of our proposed framework and discusses the obtained results. For testing 
purposes, the authors in this paper simulate the DDoS attack but do not suppose 
any attacks in the network organizations, especially in SDN environments.
5.1  Test Description
For our proposed framework, we analysed three test scenarios. The test 
scenarios of our proposed framework are mentioned in Table 2. We have 
observed that the attack should be mitigated to its source domains from the 
three test scenarios. The proposed framework is verified under three server 
domains. For practicality, mitigating the DOS attack in thousand nodes in 
an SDN environment should require a separate testbed and need a separate 
network simulator.

5.2  Discussion on Testing Scenarios’
In this subsection, we have presented a detailed discussion and practicality of 
our proposed framework. During the transmission of packets from the source 
to the destination within the network, the switch provides a timestamp and 
a number of packets transmitted in the network. Table 3 provides quality of 
service (QoS) metrics where there is no DDoS attack observed in three domain 
servers. Table 4 shows the three testing scenarios of DDoS attacks. The host IP 
address for DDoS attack mitigation is 10.1.60.43, and the destination machine 
is “DESKTOP-UQ61BU1”. The QoS metrics for the DDoS attack mitigation 
time were collected from the BurpSuite [19]. The remaining parameters, such 
as average round trip time (RTT) and percentage of packet loss retrieved from 
the ping command of host machines.

resource allocation mechanisms that can rapidly scale up or down the 
network capacity based on the current DDoS attack situation. This 
flexibility enables the mitigation of attacks by redirecting traffic, 
provisioning additional resources, or utilising specialised security 
functions.
	 •	 Collaborative Defense Mechanisms: In the future, DDoS in NFV 
environments may involve collaborative efforts between multiple network 
entities. Information sharing among network operators, service providers, 
and security platforms can enable the early detection and mitigation of 
attacks by leveraging collective intelligence and coordinated response 
strategies.
	 •	 SDN Integration: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and NFV often 
go hand in hand. Future research can focus on integrating SDN and 
NFV to enhance DDoS defense capabilities. SDN’s centralised control 
and programmability can facilitate the rapid deployment of security 
policies and enable real-time traffic redirection to mitigate attacks more 
effectively.
	 •	 Advanced Mitigation Techniques: In the future, NFV environments may 
adopt more advanced mitigation techniques to combat DDoS attacks. This 
could include the use of in-network scrubbing centers, traffic filtering and 
rate limiting, traffic diversion, or even leveraging cloud-based resources 
for scalable DDoS protection.

and rapid growth in recent years, transforming the way we interact with 
technology and revolutionising various industries [2]. IoT refers to the network 
of interconnected devices, sensors, and systems that can collect, exchange, 
and analyse data. From smart homes and wearable devices to industrial 
automation and smart cities, IoT has permeated numerous aspects of our lives.
This explosive growth of IoT brings with it significant implications for 
security and privacy [3]. As the number of interconnected devices continues 
to surge, the need to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data becomes 
paramount. IoT devices are vulnerable to various security threats, including 
unauthorised access, data breaches, and manipulation. Compromised devices 
can not only disrupt operations but also compromise the privacy of individuals 
and organisations [4].
The significance of security and privacy in the IoT context cannot be 
overstated. The potential consequences of security breaches range from 
financial losses to physical harm, making it imperative to address these 
challenges proactively. Furthermore, with IoT devices collecting vast amounts 
of personal data, protecting privacy becomes a critical concern. Individuals 
should have control over their personal information and be confident that it is 
not being exploited or misused.
The interconnected nature of IoT systems amplifies the complexity of 
security and privacy challenges. Traditional security approaches often fall 
short of providing adequate protection for IoT devices due to factors such 
as resource constraints, heterogeneity, and scalability issues [5]. Similarly, 
privacy concerns arise from the continuous data collection and aggregation, 
necessitating robust mechanisms to safeguard personal information.
Recognising these challenges, researchers, industry practitioners, and 
policymakers have turned to blockchain technology as a potential solution 
to enhance security and privacy in IoT systems. Blockchain, known for its 
decentralised and immutable nature, offers the potential to create a secure and 
trustworthy infrastructure for IoT. By leveraging cryptographic techniques, 
consensus algorithms, and smart contracts, blockchain can provide a secure 
data exchange, tamper-resistant storage, and fine-grained access control, 
bolstering the overall security and privacy of IoT systems.
2.  Security Challenges in IoT Systems
IoT systems’ interconnectedness and the wide variety of devices they use 
provide several security problems. It is essential to comprehend these issues 
in order to create security solutions that work [6]. 

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  203
Here are a few typical IoT system security issues:
Device Vulnerabilities: IoT devices often have limited computing power 
and resources, which can make them vulnerable to various attacks. Weak or 
default passwords, outdated firmware, and lack of secure communication 
protocols can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorised access or control 
over the devices.
Data Integrity and Authenticity: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of 
data transmitted and stored by IoT devices is essential. Data tampering or 
manipulation can lead to false information, compromised decision-making, 
and potentially dangerous actions. Verifying the source and integrity of data 
in a decentralised IoT environment can be challenging.
Network Security: IoT devices rely on network communication for data 
exchange, making network security a critical concern. Inadequate network 
security measures can expose IoT devices and their data to various threats, 
including eavesdropping, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and denial-of-service 
(DoS) attacks.
Lack of Standardisation: The lack of standardised security protocols and 
frameworks across IoT devices and platforms makes it difficult to establish 
consistent security practices. Incompatibilities and inconsistencies can lead to 
vulnerabilities and gaps in the security of interconnected devices.
Scalability and Complexity: IoT ecosystems can involve a vast number of 
devices with different functionalities and communication protocols. Managing 
and securing such a complex and dynamic environment poses significant 
scalability challenges, requiring robust security mechanisms that can handle 
the increasing number of devices and interactions.
Privacy Concerns: IoT devices often collect sensitive personal data, raising 
privacy concerns. Unauthorised access to this data can result in privacy 
breaches and identity theft. Additionally, the constant monitoring and tracking 
capabilities of IoT devices raise questions about individual privacy and 
consent.
Legacy System Integration: Many IoT implementations involve integrating 
new technologies with existing legacy systems. Legacy systems may lack 
proper security measures or be incompatible with modern security protocols, 
creating potential entry points for attackers.
Supply Chain Risks: The global supply chain for IoT devices involves 
multiple vendors and manufacturers, making it vulnerable to security risks. 

204  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Compromised devices introduced during the manufacturing process or supply 
chain can have built-in vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
In order to address these security issues, a multifaceted strategy that 
considers data encryption, network security, secure communication protocols, 
device security, and access control measures is necessary. To maintain the 
dependability and durability of IoT systems as the IoT environment changes, 
security must be prioritised at every level of design, development, deployment, 
and operation [7].
3.  Blockchain Technology for IoT Security
In order to improve security in IoT networks, blockchain technology has 
emerged as a possible alternative. It offers various advantages for protecting 
IoT devices and data by utilising the inherent properties of blockchain, such 
as decentralisation, immutability, and consensus procedures. 
The following are some crucial ways that blockchain technology might 
improve IoT security:
Decentralisation: Blockchain operates in a decentralised manner, eliminating 
the need for a central authority or trusted third party. This decentralised 
architecture enhances the security of IoT systems by removing single points 
of failure and reducing the risk of unauthorised access or control. Each 
participant in the blockchain network maintains a copy of the distributed 
ledger, ensuring transparency and integrity.
Immutability: Blockchain’s immutability ensures that once data is recorded 
on the blockchain, it becomes tamper-resistant. This property makes it highly 
suitable for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data generated by 
IoT devices. Any attempt to alter or tamper with the data recorded on the 
blockchain would require the consensus of a majority of network participants, 
making it extremely difficult for attackers to modify or manipulate data 
without detection.
Data Integrity and Auditability: The transparent nature of blockchain enables 
the verification and auditability of data transactions. Every transaction 
recorded on the blockchain is time-stamped, creating an immutable audit 
trail. This feature enhances data integrity, providing a robust mechanism for 
detecting any unauthorised changes to IoT device data.

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  205
Secure Communication and Identity Management: Blockchain technology 
can facilitate secure communication between IoT devices by establishing a 
decentralised and encrypted peer-to-peer network. Smart contracts deployed 
on the blockchain can enable secure device authentication, access control, and 
data sharing. This ensures that only authorised devices can participate in the 
network and access specific data, reducing the risk of unauthorised access or 
malicious activities [8].
Consensus Mechanisms: Blockchain networks rely on consensus mechanisms 
to validate and agree upon the state of the ledger. Consensus algorithms such 
as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) ensure the validity and 
consistency of data across the network. These mechanisms provide additional 
security by requiring network participants to solve cryptographic puzzles or 
stake their tokens, making it computationally expensive and economically 
unfeasible for attackers to manipulate the blockchain.
Tamper-Resistant Device Updates: Blockchain technology can facilitate 
secure and tamper-resistant firmware updates for IoT devices. By using 
blockchain, manufacturers can digitally sign firmware updates and record them 
on the blockchain. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the updates, 
mitigating the risk of unauthorised or malicious firmware modifications.
Trust and Transparency: The use of blockchain technology enhances trust 
and transparency in IoT systems. Participants in the blockchain network can 
have increased confidence in the integrity and security of the data exchanged, 
as they can independently verify and audit the transactions recorded on the 
blockchain.
Even though blockchain technology has several benefits for IoT security, 
it is crucial to carefully weigh the trade-offs. IoT installations may face 
difficulties due to issues with scalability, resource limitations, and the energy 
consumption of some blockchain implementations. To balance security 
and operational efficiency in IoT systems, it is crucial to choose the right 
blockchain designs, consensus methods, and optimisation approaches.
IoT systems may achieve better security, data integrity, and trustworthy 
interactions between devices by utilising blockchain technology. Additional 
research and development will enable the technology to reach its full potential 
for protecting the IoT environment, which is quickly developing.

4.  Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT
Privacy considerations play a crucial role in ensuring the responsible and 
ethical deployment of blockchain-based IoT (Internet of Things) systems. 
While blockchain technology offers advantages such as transparency and 
immutability, it also raises concerns about the confidentiality and privacy of 
sensitive data. 
Here are key privacy considerations in blockchain-based IoT:
Data Leakage: In IoT systems, devices generate and exchange vast amounts of 
data. Blockchain’s transparent nature poses challenges in protecting sensitive 
data from unauthorised access or exposure. Without appropriate measures, 
sensitive information such as personal identifiers, location data, and usage 
patterns could be exposed to unauthorised parties.
User Identification: Blockchain transactions are typically pseudonymous, 
using cryptographic addresses instead of real-world identities. However, it is 
crucial to recognise that de-anonymisation techniques can potentially link these 
addresses to real individuals. This raises concerns about user identification 
and the potential loss of privacy when linking IoT device activities to 
specific users.
Data Ownership and Consent: In blockchain-based IoT, data ownership 
and consent are critical aspects. IoT devices often collect data from various 
sources, including individuals. Ensuring that individuals have control over 
their data, understand how it is being used, and provide informed consent 
is crucial for maintaining privacy. Smart contracts and permissioned access 
mechanisms can be utilised to address these concerns.
Selective Disclosure: Not all data collected by IoT devices needs to be shared 
on the blockchain. Selective disclosure mechanisms can be employed to share 
only necessary and non-sensitive data while keeping sensitive information 
off-chain. This approach helps protect privacy by minimising the exposure of 
personal and confidential data.
Anonymity and Privacy Trade-offs: Balancing anonymity and privacy with 
transparency is a challenge in blockchain-based systems. While blockchain’s 
transparency enhances trust and auditability, it can compromise individual 
privacy. Striking the right balance between transparency and privacy is 
important, considering the specific use cases, regulatory requirements, and 
user expectations.
Regulatory Compliance: Compliance with privacy regulations, such 
as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), becomes crucial in 
blockchain-based IoT systems. Organiaations must ensure that their data 

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  207
handling practices align with the principles and requirements outlined 
by relevant privacy regulations to protect user rights and maintain legal 
compliance.
Secure Access Control: Strong access control mechanisms are vital 
for protecting privacy in blockchain-based IoT. Implementing granular 
permission models, where individuals have control over their data and can 
grant selective access to trusted entities, which helps prevent unauthorised 
access and preserves privacy.
Privacy by Design: Incorporating privacy considerations from the early stages 
of system design is essential. By following privacy-by-design principles, 
organisations can proactively identify and mitigate privacy risks, establish 
privacy policies, and ensure that privacy-enhancing techniques are integrated 
into the architecture and operation of blockchain-based IoT systems.
It is necessary to take a comprehensive strategy that integrates 
technological, legal, and ethical factors in order to address privacy issues in 
blockchain-based IoT systems. Building trust and ensuring the responsible use 
of IoT data inside blockchain ecosystems requires striking the proper balance 
between openness, data protection, user control, and regulatory compliance. 
To encourage privacy-preserving IoT deployments, businesses must view 
privacy as a core necessity and implement privacy-enhancing strategies and 
best practices.
5.  Security Mechanisms in Blockchain-based IoT
IoT (Internet of Things) systems built on blockchain use a variety of security 
measures to guarantee the reliability, confidentiality, and integrity of the 
network. To safeguard IoT devices, data, and interactions, these systems make 
use of the distinctive features of blockchain technology [9]. 
The following are some essential security measures frequently applied in 
blockchain-based IoT:
Encryption: Encryption is a fundamental security mechanism used to 
protect the confidentiality of data transmitted and stored within IoT systems. 
End-to-end encryption can be employed to secure communication channels 
between IoT devices, ensuring that only authorised recipients can access and 
decipher the data.
Digital Signatures: Digital signatures play a crucial role in verifying the 
authenticity and integrity of data in a blockchain-based IoT system. Utilising 
asymmetric cryptographic methods, digital signatures offer a way to confirm 
the sender’s identity and guarantee that the data was not altered during 
transmission.

208  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Secure Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that 
run on the blockchain. They define the rules and conditions for interactions 
between IoT devices. By ensuring the security and correctness of smart 
contracts through code reviews, vulnerability assessments, and secure 
coding practices, the potential for malicious actions or vulnerabilities can be 
minimised.
Access Control: In order to manage access to IoT devices and data inside 
a blockchain network and to govern permissions, access control techniques 
are essential. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) or Role-based access 
control (RBAC) can be employed to define and enforce fine-grained access 
policies, ensuring that only authorised entities can interact with specific 
devices or access certain data.
Consensus Algorithms: Consensus algorithms are essential for maintaining 
the blockchain’s integrity and security. They make it possible for network 
users to concur on the legitimacy of transactions and the sequence in which 
they are recorded on the blockchain. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake 
(PoS) consensus algorithms assist in stopping fraudulent behaviours like 
double-spending and blockchain hacking.
Immutable Ledger: The immutability of the blockchain ensures that once 
data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted without consensus from 
the network participants. This property makes the blockchain a secure and 
tamper-resistant ledger, reducing the risk of unauthorised modifications or 
data tampering within the IoT system.
Auditing and Monitoring: Continuous auditing and monitoring mechanisms 
are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents in 
blockchain-based IoT systems. Real-time monitoring of device activities, 
network traffic analysis, and anomaly detection techniques help identify 
suspicious behaviour and potential security breaches. Furthermore, audit 
trails recorded on the blockchain provide a transparent and verifiable history 
of transactions, aiding in forensic analysis and incident response.
Secure Identity Management: Secure identity management is critical in 
blockchain-based IoT to ensure that only authorised and authenticated devices 
participate in the network. Public key infrastructure (PKI) and decentralised 
identity solutions can be utilised to manage device identities, authenticate 
communication, and prevent unauthorised access to the network.
By incorporating these security measures, blockchain-based IoT 
systems may better protect the interactions, data, and devices, improving the 
network’s overall security posture. To achieve an ideal and successful security 

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  209
implementation, it is crucial to consider the unique requirements, limitations, 
and trade-offs of each mechanism in the context of the IoT ecosystem.
6.  Privacy-preserving Techniques in Blockchain-based IoT
While utilising the advantages of blockchain technology, privacy-preserving 
strategies in blockchain-based IoT (Internet of Things) systems seek to 
safeguard the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive data. These methods 
allow people to limit the disclosure of sensitive information to approved 
parties while giving them control over their personal information. 
The following are some frequently used techniques of IoT-based 
blockchain privacy-preserving techniques:
Pseudonymity: Blockchain networks typically use pseudonyms or 
cryptographic addresses instead of real-world identities. By utilising 
pseudonyms, the link between IoT device activities and specific individuals 
can be obfuscated, providing a certain level of privacy and anonymity.
Selective Disclosure: Selective disclosure mechanisms allow users to share 
specific pieces of data with authorised entities while keeping the rest of 
the information private. It ensures that only the necessary data is disclosed, 
preserving privacy and minimising exposure to sensitive information.
Encryption: Sensitive data which is kept on the blockchain or which is 
exchanged between IoT devices can be encrypted using encryption methods. 
Data is made secure and private by being encrypted using cryptographic 
techniques, which prevents access from unwanted parties.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) enable the 
validation of a statement without revealing any additional information. In the 
context of blockchain-based IoT, ZKPs can be used to prove the correctness 
or validity of certain data or actions without exposing the underlying sensitive 
information.
Homomorphic Encryption: With homomorphic encryption, calculations may 
be made on encrypted data without having to first decode it. By ensuring that 
sensitive data is encrypted during processing, this method adds another degree 
of privacy protection to IoT systems based on blockchain technology.
Privacy-focused 
Blockchain 
Frameworks: 
Specialised 
blockchain 
frameworks, such as privacy-focused or privacy-enhanced blockchains, offer 
additional privacy features tailored to IoT applications [10]. These frameworks 
may employ advanced privacy-preserving techniques, such as ring signatures, 
zero-knowledge proofs, or mix networks, to ensure privacy in the context 
of IoT.

210  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Off-Chain Data Storage: Not all data collected by IoT devices needs to be 
stored directly on the blockchain. Off-chain storage solutions can be utilised 
to store sensitive data separately, while only storing necessary metadata or 
cryptographic proofs on the blockchain. This approach helps protect privacy 
by minimising the exposure of sensitive information on the public blockchain.
Consent Management: Consent management mechanisms enable individuals 
to control the usage of their personal data within the blockchain-based IoT 
system. By providing explicit consent for data sharing and defining specific 
usage policies, individuals can maintain control over their data and ensure that 
it is used only for authorised purposes [11].
In IoT systems built on blockchain, the combination of various 
privacy-preserving methods offers a tiered approach to protecting sensitive 
data and privacy. To balance blockchain technology’s advantages for 
openness and privacy, though, is vital. To provide a privacy-respecting and 
reliable system, the implementation of suitable privacy methods should take 
into account user expectations, user expectations, and the unique context of 
the IoT application.
7.  Case Studies and Use Cases
Case studies and use cases demonstrate the practical implementation of 
blockchain-based IoT systems with enhanced security and privacy. They 
provide real-world examples of how organisations have leveraged blockchain 
technology to address the challenges and achieve the benefits of IoT while 
ensuring data integrity and privacy. 
Here are a few notable case studies and use cases:
Supply Chain Management: Blockchain-based IoT systems have been 
employed to enhance traceability and transparency in supply chain 
management. By integrating IoT devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, 
with blockchain technology, organisations can securely track and verify the 
movement of goods, monitor conditions like temperature and humidity, and 
ensure the authenticity of products throughout the supply chain. This use case 
has been particularly prominent in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
Energy Grid Management: Blockchain-based IoT systems have been utilised 
for decentralised energy grid management. By integrating IoT devices, such 
as smart meters and energy sensors, with blockchain, energy consumption 
data can be securely recorded and validated on the blockchain. This enables 
transparent and efficient energy trading, optimised grid management, and 

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  211
accurate billing, while maintaining the privacy of consumers’ energy usage 
information.
Healthcare Data Sharing: Blockchain-based IoT systems have been 
implemented to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving sharing of healthcare 
data. IoT devices, such as wearables and medical sensors, can collect patient 
data and are securely stored on the blockchain [12]. Healthcare providers and 
researchers can access the data with patient consent, ensuring privacy and 
data integrity while enabling collaborative research, personalised healthcare, 
and efficient data interoperability.
Smart Cities: Blockchain-based IoT systems have been applied to create 
smart city solutions. By integrating IoT devices like smart sensors, cameras, 
and infrastructure management systems with blockchain technology, cities 
can securely collect and share data related to traffic management, waste 
management, public safety, and environmental monitoring. This enables 
efficient resource allocation, real-time decision-making, and enhanced citizen 
participation while preserving data privacy and security.
Digital Identity Management: Blockchain-based IoT systems have been 
employed for decentralised and secure digital identity management [13]. By 
combining IoT devices with blockchain, individuals can have control over their 
digital identities and securely authenticate themselves in various applications. 
This use case eliminates the need for centralised identity providers, reduces 
the risk of identity theft, and ensures privacy and data integrity in identity 
management.
These case studies and use cases highlight the versatility and benefits 
of integrating blockchain technology with IoT systems. They demonstrate 
how blockchain increases security, data integrity, transparency, and privacy in 
various industries and domains [14]. 
To get the best outcomes, organisations must carefully assess the unique 
needs and context of their IoT deployments. Each implementation, after all, 
has its own concerns and obstacles.
8.  Future Directions and Challenges
8.1  Future Directions
Scalability: Enhancing scalability is one of the main future initiatives 
for blockchain-based IoT. Blockchain networks must be able to handle an 
increasing volume of transactions and data without jeopardising speed as 
the number of IoT devices increases [15]. To meet this difficulty, research 

212  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
and development efforts are concentrated on scaling solutions like sharding, 
sidechains, and off-chain processing.
Interoperability: Achieving interoperability between different blockchain 
platforms and IoT devices is crucial for seamless integration and widespread 
adoption. Future directions involve the development of standards and 
protocols that enable cross-platform communication and interoperability, 
allowing diverse IoT devices and blockchain networks to interact efficiently.
Privacy Enhancements: Future advancements aim to enhance privacy in 
blockchain-based IoT systems. This includes the development of more 
sophisticated privacy-preserving techniques, such as advanced zero-knowledge 
proofs, secure multiparty computation, and privacy-focused consensus 
algorithms. Innovations in privacy-enhancing cryptography and decentralised 
identity management systems will also contribute to strengthening privacy in 
the IoT ecosystem.
Integration with AI and Machine Learning: The integration of artificial 
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with blockchain-based IoT 
systems holds immense potential. AI and ML algorithms can leverage the vast 
amount of data collected by IoT devices to derive valuable insights, optimise 
decision-making, and enhance the efficiency of IoT operations. Blockchain 
can ensure the integrity and immutability of AI and ML models and provide 
transparent auditing of their outputs.
8.2  Challenges
Here are some challenges related to Blockchain-based IoT systems
Energy Efficiency: Blockchain-based IoT systems can consume significant 
amounts of energy due to the computational requirements of consensus 
mechanisms. Overcoming the energy efficiency challenge is essential to 
make blockchain-based IoT systems sustainable [16]. To decrease energy use 
and environmental effect, researchers are investigating innovative consensus 
methods including proof-of-stake (PoS) and energy-efficient consensus 
algorithms.
Governance and Regulation: The decentralised nature of blockchain-based 
IoT raises challenges related to governance and regulation. Determining legal 
frameworks, establishing standards, and addressing liability and accountability 
issues in decentralised environments are areas that require further attention. 
Collaboration between industry stakeholders, policymakers, and regulatory 
bodies is crucial to developing appropriate governance models and regulations 
that foster innovation while safeguarding privacy and security.

Security and Privacy Considerations in Blockchain-based IoT Systems  213
Security Considerations: While blockchain provides enhanced security for 
IoT systems, new security challenges may emerge as the technology evolves. 
The potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, consensus algorithms, and 
blockchain implementations must be continually addressed through robust 
security practices, code audits, and penetration testing. Staying vigilant 
against emerging threats, such as quantum computing, is also important.
User Experience and Adoption: Usability and user experience are critical for 
the widespread use of IoT technologies powered by blockchain. Simplifying 
user interfaces, integrating seamless authentication mechanisms, and educating 
end-users about the benefits and functionalities of blockchain-based IoT are 
necessary to foster acceptance and encourage adoption.
Addressing these future directions and challenges will require 
collaborative efforts from researchers, industry experts, policymakers, and 
technology providers [17]. Continued research and innovation, combined with 
practical implementations and regulatory support, will pave the way for the 
secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable integration of blockchain technology 
with IoT systems.
9.  Conclusion
The incorporation of blockchain technology with IoT systems offers 
significant opportunities to enhance security, privacy, and efficiency. 
The accelerated growth of the Internet of Things has brought forth unique 
challenges in security, such as device vulnerabilities, data integrity concerns, 
and network attacks [18]. Blockchain technology offers inherent features such 
as decentralisation, immutability, and consensus mechanisms that address 
these challenges and provide a foundation for secure IoT systems.
Furthermore, privacy considerations in the blockchain-based IoT systems 
are crucial to safeguard sensitive data and ensure individuals’ control over 
their personal information. Techniques such as pseudonymity, selective 
disclosure, encryption, and privacy-focused blockchain frameworks enable 
the preservation of privacy while maintaining transparency and data integrity.
Real-world use cases and case studies have demonstrated the practical 
implementation of blockchain-based IoT systems in various domains, including 
supply chain management, energy grid management, healthcare data sharing, 
smart cities, and digital identity management [19]. These examples showcase 
blockchain technology’s advantages for improving security, transparency, and 
privacy while enabling efficient and trusted interactions in IoT ecosystems.
Looking ahead, future directions for blockchain-based IoT systems 
include addressing scalability challenges, promoting interoperability, 
enhancing privacy techniques, and integrating AI and machine learning [20]. 

214  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
Overcoming challenges related to energy efficiency, governance, security 
considerations, and user experience will be crucial for the widespread adoption 
and success of blockchain-based IoT systems.
By combining the strengths of blockchain and IoT, we can build a more 
secure, resilient, and privacy-preserving infrastructure for the ever-expanding 
interconnected world. Continued research, collaboration, and innovation 
among researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers will drive 
the advancement of blockchain-based IoT systems and pave the way for a 
trustworthy and efficient IoT ecosystem.

1.  Introduction
The usage of communication tools in the healthcare system has brought 
unimaginable development in the problem areas related to detection 
and observation, which has potentially saved a number of people from 
life-threatening diseases such as cardiac failure, various types of cancer, 
and diabetes at their early stages, something which was previously deemed 
unachievable. Physicians have a critical role in the early diagnosis of Diabetes 
along with its management. 
Focusing primarily on diabetic foot ulcer management, primarily requires 
vital knowledge of the major risk factors, frequent routine evaluation, along 
with preventive maintenance since if the condition is mismanaged or ignored it 
may result in serious consequences. Among several others, the most common 
factors leading to ulcer formation include uncontrolled diabetes, diabetic 
neuropathy (degeneration of the nerves of extremities), and gait imbalances 
due to foot deformity. The use of advanced communication systems can 
help us detect foot ulcers which were caused by diabetes and differentiate 
them from ulcers formed for a heavily weighted body. Many user trials with 
prototypes are being conducted and being developed to gain perspectives on

diabetes management along its complications such as the foot ulcer based 
on the treatment requirements. The use of computer systems and various 
communication devices is a way to manage care along with detection and 
identification analysis of the data collected.
With the help of IoMT devices, which are a subset of IoT technology, 
medical equipment can now interact on their own across a network. IoMT 
networks are used to collect and send patient data to healthcare practitioners, 
often with little or no involvement from patients or their healthcare 
professionals.
Continuous infections are shown as chronic and require protracted 
therapy [1]. Patients with chronic illnesses typically stay at a clinic for a 
longer period of time for continuous monitoring. It’s natural to have certain 
chronic potential diseases [2]. Diabetes already carries a high risk due to the 
frequent infections it frequently results in. In order for a patient with diabetes 
to have a normal life, they need be checked. When the body can’t produce 
enough insulin or use it properly, the pancreas develops a permanent crack, 
which is what is known as diabetes [3, 4]. Numerous organs, including the 
eyes, nerves, and veins, can be harmed and rendered ineffective by high or 
low glucose levels; as a result, constant daily testing is crucial to prevent the 
loss of strength of the patient.
More constructions are anticipated to screen these people given the 
number of diabetic patients. The foundation of the diabetes monitoring system 
is regular blood glucose monitoring [7]. This suggests that both individuals 
and medical professionals can quickly check blood glucose levels at any time. 
Due to this, the 5G development, also referred to as the era of cutting-edge 
wearable associations, can achieve speedy communication, the expansion of 
major corporate boundaries, and hierarchical flexibility. Regardless, the focus 
of the current evaluation of this improvement is expanding the data provided 
[5, 6]. In this chapter, we develop a model that monitors and transmits data 
about diabetes patients to medical personnel and the patient’s mobile device. 
The 5G cell network association is used by the mobile phone to transmit 
the sensor’s data to the account station. In order to inform the patient, the 
information was obtained and further investigated.
2.  Wearable IoT
They are also referred to as on-body IoMT devices. They keep track of a 
person’s medical history and are connected to their body. Medical or 
consumer-grade wearable technology is available. Health information, such 
as a person’s heart rate and blood pressure, are recorded by on-body IoMT. 
Consumer-grade smart gadgets can be used to track wellness and health 
metrics without a doctor’s supervision.

3.  Prototype and Working
The proposed prototype is of a bilayer flexible foot insole consisting of micro 
flexible temperature sensors on the top layer and pressure sensors on the 
bottom layer to sense the temperature and pressure changes in the foot.
Monofilament sensors are used to access the nerve signals of the 
individual if they are diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. They 
contain of nylon filaments of varying thicknesses, when pressed against the 
foot the filament buckles a specific force indicating to perceive pressure, 
reduced sensation indicating nerve damage.
Continuous monitoring is the best available modality in healthcare as there 
is an almost negligible involvement of the individual to record the parameters 
of Pressure, Temperature, Nerve activity, Blood flow and the Glucose levels 
of the individual. 
The temperature and pressure of the individual are to be measured 
through the sensors embedded in sole, the parameters of nerve activity, 
including blood flow are to be detected by the ankle and the glucose level 
parameter can be taken from the Continuous Glucose measurement (CGM) 
system where the sensor with a subcutaneous needle is placed near the hand 
or abdomen to manage their diabetes [8]. The entire data collected by various 
sensors can be transmitted to an application using Bluetooth which is of low 
energy consumption. 
Predetermined threshold values for each of the taken parameters are set 
for the changes and when these parameters are reached above the pre-set 
threshold, an alert can be sent to individual or family members. The same 
data can be shared with health care professionals or their family physicians to 
remotely monitor the health of the individual or in the case of an emergency.
Figure 1 below represents a simple region where the occurrence of ulcer 
is first noticed in the case of diabetic foot.
Figure 1.  Depiction of a healthy foot and Ulcered foot.

Blockchain in Healthcare  219
One of the complications that accompanies diabetes is the presence of 
Diabetic Foot Ulcers. This is a chronic, non-healing, wound which affects 
the gait, posture, pressure and the temperature of the foot. It is caused due 
to a combination of factors like neuropathy (nerve damage), poor blood 
circulation, and diabetes.
The regions of the foot mentioned above get primarily affected for two 
reasons one is that it has a constant pressure of the weight of the patient 
having diabetes and the other is frequent disruptions in pressures of the foot 
on the ground where the skin comes in contact to the ground. With these 
circumstances, it is quite impossible to understand the major cause of wound 
occurrence. 
Proper inspection and the management of diabetes on a regular basis 
is the key to preventing ulcer formation, unfortunately, the observation is 
subjective, and it depends on the individual to check for any visual changes 
on the foot.
HSI Hyper Spectral Imaging is actually a non-invasive and painless 
technique for differentiating pathological tissues from healthy ones. This is a 
very extensive process for the diagnosis or detection of a diabetic foot ulcer 
since the current approach through biopsies are conventional methods and 
along with being invasive, causes permanent wounds on the foot apart from 
other complications. The proposed device’s integrated application receives 
the results from a metadata analysis [10] which measures several biomarkers 
by HSI (from all the sensors of the device) for estimating the health status of 
the individual by cross-comparing the values of the normal range which are 
already coded into the system. The goal of the analysis and cross-verification 
is for the identification and forecast of the disorders related to diabetes to 
some extent.
The sensors are ideally placed in six areas of the foot which are known to 
be prone to pressure, shear force and temperature changes. Clinically a 2.2°C of 
temperature rise over a point of the foot consistently over 48 hours has a great 
chance of developing into a diabetic ulcer, so as to prevent skin breakage, it is 
always advisable to offload the pressure on that area. The main limitation of 
thermal imaging is that is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions. In 
our case, we optimise an NIR (Near-Infrared) sensor to yield a discrimination 
analysis of the parameters of blood flow monitoring and tissue health detection 
of less than 100 mK differences and of spatial resolution of 10 pixels/com. 
Thermal maps and pressure maps can be constructed using these data 
points for every hour and can be stored for further analysis. The prototype 
includes an accelerometer to measure the distance precisely before the 
pressure or temperature has reached its peak. This metric is used to determine 
the distance to offload the pressure on a regular basis. The processing stage 
provides a very accurate analysis of the parameters.

220  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
The result of the analysis of the various parameters is combined into 
one result which will be presented in layman’s terms and will be sent to the 
individual through a transmitter to an application.
Figure 3 is the schematic connectivity of the whole circuitry and 
components interfacing. The circuit diagram provided below also represents 
the pin connectivity of the overall modules.
Table 1 is the comparison of skin temperatures in the feet and the Ankle 
Brachial Index obtained in non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Non DPN, 
n = 46) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN, n = 39) patients.
Figure 2.  Layout of sensor placement.
The proposed model is for a remedial system for foot ulcers where we 
use embedded technology to project UV rays which act as the antibacterial 
projection device. A vibrator is used to oscillate the foot skin to revive it. The 
Peltier device is used to heat and cool the wound to further rejuvenate the 
foot skin to sustain a faster recovery. The HC-05 Bluetooth device transmits 
the instructions which are decoded by the Android application installed on 
the phone. These instructions are decoded in the form of audio-visuals and 
provided to the users for a better understanding and usability. Each session 
is created for multiple sessions of heating, and cooling using Peltiers. The 
vibration of the skin part is done using vibrators and the antibacterial part

by UV rays. The overall operation is synchronised using the microcontroller. 
Tailor-made programming can be done which makes it way more efficient 
and flexible for further changes and scalability. The overall process deals with 
multiple stages such as image pre-processing, segmentation, feature/texture 
extraction, and image classification. The pre-processing is used to enhance 
the quality of the input image by removing the noise.
4.  Data Transfer in the IoMT Network
Healthcare businesses constantly struggle with security issues, whether it’s 
protecting patient information or the IoMT infrastructure itself. The current 
healthcare systems also take advantage of IoMT where industrial sensors and 
actuators are used as wearable devices to collect users’ physiological data, 
such as blood pressure, ECG, temperature and so on. In such a scenario, 
the data generated from industrial healthcare systems are often delivered 
or transmitted to a patient’s local gateway or edge devices to perform data 
processing and aggregation, and then forwarded to the cloud for long-term 
storage, and furthermore also used by healthcare providers for real-time 
diagnosis and analysis. However, in the present healthcare ecosystem, the 
devices and sensors continuously monitor, communicate, and exchange 
information over an insecure public channel.

222  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
The entire healthcare system is also subject to a number of security 
vulnerabilities because of the constant connectivity of devices, including 
data manipulation, denial of service, eavesdropping, impersonation, 
man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks. Data tampering can result in 
inaccurate diagnoses, potentially putting the patients under surveillance in 
life-threatening situations. This raises serious issues in the healthcare sector. 
The security of an IoMT network is enhanced by software that automatically 
checks resources and identifies risks on the network. When a new device tries 
to connect to the department’s IoMT network, this software can send an alarm. 
Such software works to prevent intruders and security threats from entering, 
damaging the network, and perhaps compromising the medical facility.
The systematic architecture of the proposed Blockchain framework is 
made up of 3 layers: 
	1)	 Industrial Healthcare system 
	2)	 Edge-Blockchain layer; and 
	3)	 Cloud-Blockchain layer.
	1)	 Industrial Healthcare system layer: Important patient health data is 
continuously gathered at this layer using a variety of IoT-based healthcare 
tracking systems and implantable medical devices (such as temperature 
sensors, glucose monitors, and heart rate devices). These devices are 
referred to as lightweight nodes since they can only store and analyse a 
small percentage of the data on the blockchain due to their low resources 
and computational power (LNs).
	2)	 Edge-Blockchain Layer: This layer is known as a full node and is made 
up of powerful nodes such as data analysis servers, industrial computers, 
edge computing servers, and so on (FN). The peer-to-peer network is 
constructed using edge devices geo-distributed amongst primary and 
urban health centres. Each patient is assigned an edge service node, 
which communicates with the cloud for long-term backup and storage 
and gathers, processes, and raises alerts in emergency scenarios.
	3)	 Cloud-Blockchain Layer: The third tier is the cloud-blockchain layer, 
which consists of several cloud suppliers and data centres (DCs). These 
DCs are in charge of offering services to customers (such as computation, 
processing, and so on).
5.  Integration of IoMT and Blockchain 
Blockchain is the mechanism where the data is encrypted and restricts users 
from unauthorised access to encrypted data and is available with a key for 
authentic users to access the data for the authoritative users. This is one of the 

Blockchain in Healthcare  223
primary usages for the security of the patient’s confidential health information 
which is one of the intricate parts of the Health care system throughout the 
world [10, 11]. When compared to the Blockchain, the IoMT systems have 
various parameters and a variety of architectural structures. The main challenge 
in integrating the blockchain with IoMT systems is that each sensor’s data is 
collected and saved differently, making it difficult to modify and digitalise the 
data after it has been collected. This modified data will then need to be sent 
to the blockchain for encrypted analysis and representation as per a person’s 
basic understanding through a BLE to an app.
There are basically three types of communication in this suggested 
framework: communication from medical devices to IPFS cluster nodes, 
communication from IPFS cluster nodes to smart contracts, and communication 
from smart contracts to the blockchain network.
Medical-device-to-IPFS Cluster Node Communication
In the paradigm, this communication is in charge of achieving two distinct 
goals. The registration of patients and their medical equipment is the primary 
goal. Prior to communication in the primary IoMT blockchain network, the 
second goal is to authenticate the medical devices.
IPFS Cluster Node-to-Smart Contract Communication
In order to ensure privacy in the IoMT blockchain network, this communication 
is in charge of synchronising the authentication and authorisation of the data 
from medical devices and their mapping.
Smart Contracts-to-Blockchain Network Communication
After successful authentication and permission, this communication is in 
charge of distributing the information into the blockchain network to enable 
secure data transmission between various agents (in this case patients and their 
doctors) in the IoMT blockchain network. The IoMT blockchain network’s 
privacy is guaranteed by this communication.
6.  Security and Privacy in IoMT via Blockchain
The security and confidentiality of the IoMT devices proceeds by the 
following tasks:
IoMT Wearable Device Verification
The IPFS cluster node closest to each IoMT device that supports smart 
contracts is used to register and authenticate the device as belonging to 

224  Blockchain and Digital Twin Enabled IoT Networks: Privacy and Security Perspectives
a particular patient in the IoMT blockchain network. The medical devices 
initially register with an IPFS cluster node that supports smart contracts. Once 
the identity of the medical equipment has been protected in an IPFS cluster 
node transaction, it is sent to the IoMT blockchain network to form a block. 
All additional peers in the IoMT blockchain healthcare network receive the 
blocks at this point for further access. Any devices attempting to communicate 
with the system must first authenticate and then send their security credentials 
to the IPFS cluster with smart contracts enabled.
Security of IoMT Devices
In the IoMT blockchain healthcare system, the suggested framework simplifies 
access control security for medical devices. According to this framework, 
only devices that are successfully authenticated and registered using IPFS 
cluster nodes that support smart contracts can join the IoMT network. The 
IoMT network does not accept connections from medical devices that are not 
listed on the IPFS cluster node since they are unable to authenticate them. As 
a result, the chance of malicious medical equipment interacting with the IoMT 
network is lessened.
7.  Generation of Keys for IoMT Devices and Patients
The suggested methodology generates private and public keys for medical 
devices using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) 
[10, 11]. The algorithm is chosen after comparing the several encryption 
techniques provided by The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm is more secure 
and requires fewer resources than the ECDSA technique (RSA). The Bitcoin 
framework has successfully employed the same algorithm [12].
Functionality of IoMT Devices
This subsection briefly explains the working of the proposed framework which 
is graphically illustrated in Fig. 4. The suggested model consists of two primary 
stages: the initialisation level, which is in charge of registering patients and 
their medical devices, and the second level, which is in charge of authenticating 
patients’ medical devices. The patient initialisation level makes it easier for 
new patients to register in the IoMT healthcare system and ensures that each 
patient may be identified specifically. The next step is to register a patient’s 
medical device with the IoMT healthcare system after they have enrolled as 
a new patient. During the device registration process, smart medical devices 
must register with the IoMT healthcare network. These medical devices are 
registered against the corresponding (previously registered) patients in order 
to join the IoMT network. The registration of the medical device is followed

by the patient’s authentication, during which the IPFS cluster node with smart 
contracts enabled verifies the medical equipment. A certificate for the medical 
device’s IPFS cluster node authentication is provided at the registration level. 
The medical equipment will be examined using their authenticity certificate 
at this stage. The medical gadget can join the IoMT healthcare system if 
all authentication requirements are met. This level ensures that the IoMT 
healthcare system can only be accessed by authorised medical devices.
8.  Conclusion
The major goal of this chapter is to create a smart sole that will allow pressure 
readings from various foot pressure points to be systematically analysed and 
cross-checked against a database of predetermined parameter values. This 
may result in the analysis’s findings being based on clinical information 
gathered through the smart sole. Multiple pressure sensors are incorporated 
into the sole as part of the design technique in order to track the pressure 
applied by both feet continually. The clinical data of parameters exerted on the 
foot through the mobile app is interfaced with the visualisation of prediction 
analysis and imported into the web app. To address the security and privacy 
of the patient data in an IoMT network, the framework is divided into two 
levels such as the Initialisation level and the Authentication level. The patient 
and their IoMT devices are registered at the initialisation level into the IPFS 
cluster node that supports smart contracts, and their patient identification 
and device identity are entered into the blockchain network. The patient ID, 
device ID, and device public address are mapped at the authentication level 
and shared with the IoMT blockchain network. Additionally, a distributed 
off-chain data storage layer that satisfies the requirements of secure storage

management is provided by the IPFS cluster node. The patients’ individual 
device information is submitted as a transaction to the blockchain network 
following successful registration and authentication in order to maintain 
anonymity in the IoMT network. Our future plan includes extending this work 
in the real-time application for the IoMT healthcare system by adding a larger 
number of peers and their IoMT devices.
