Membrane filtration processes

Introduction
1	 Introduction
The goal of membrane filtration processes is to separate molecules or particles from a solution by a 
membrane, while limiting its fouling in order to obtain a stable permeate flux during at least 20 hours. 
Two types of filtration processes are possible, tangential filtration and dead end filtration. 
1.1	
Principles and main parameters of filtration
1.1.1	
Principle of tangential filtration
The fluid circulates along the membrane from a tank under the action of a pump. Only a part of the 
fluid, the permeate crosses membrane pores under a pressure difference (transmembrane pressure ptm) 
while the remaining fluid (retentate) is recycled in the tank or discarded. The membrane pores will retain 
macromolecules or particles of larger size, while microsolutes (molecules or particles smaller than pores 
diameters) will remain in permeate.
1.1.2	
Principle of dead end filtration
In this case, the fluid must cross a membrane perpendicular to the flow and retentate concentration 
increases rapidly. Dead end filtration is mostly used with diluted fluids and membrane fouling occurs 
faster than in tangential filtration.
1.1.3	
Main parameters of filtration
The filtrate flow rate QF is the flow crossing the membrane, expressed in m3/s or in lit/hour (l/h). The 
permeate flux J is equal to QF/S, permeate flow per unit area of membrane, generally expressed in l/hm2. 
The mean transmembrane pressure (ptm) is given by
Ptm = (pa+pr)/2 -pF,
(1)
where pa is feed pressure, pr retentate pressure at membrane exit and pF the filtrate pressure. The sieving 
coefficient S of membrane is given by
S = CF/Cr,
(2)
where CF is the permeate concentration and Cr that of retentate. The rejection rate is R= 1-S; it is complete 
if S=0 or R=1. For a membrane with uniform pores, there is no rejection (R=0) for solutes with diameter 
smaller than pores diameter and R will be equal to 1 for solutes with larger diameters than pores. In 
fact, since pores are not uniform, it frequently happens that solutes will only pass through larger pores 
and their rejection will be partial, with R<1.

Introduction
Membranes are characterized by their hydraulic permeability Lp= J /ptm where J is the pure water flux. 
Permeability units are m/(Pa s) or l/(hm2 bar). This permeability depends upon diameter and pores 
density as well as membrane thickness. Membrane resistance Rm (m-1) is given by Rm = (µ Lp)-1 and, 
unlike hydraulic permeability, depends upon fluid viscosity.
1.2	
Classification of membranes processes
A. Filtration processes using transmembrane pressure (ptm)
1.2.1	
Microfiltration (MF).
These membranes are characterized by their mean pores diameter (dp) ranging from 0.05 mm to 5 mm. 
The ptm varies from 0.1 to 3 bar as membrane resistance is relatively small. The membrane stops particles, 
but not molecules, so there is no osmotic pressure. It is possible to use MF in dead end filtration for 
low concentration fluids.
Applications: wine and fruits juice clarification, cell separation, membrane bioreactors. There are many 
applications in food industry and agronomy, biotechnology and mechanical industry.
Manufacturers: France: Orelis, Exekia,Tami.; Germany: Sartorius, Aaflow. USA: Pall, Millipore
1.2.2	
Ultrafiltration (UF)
These membranes have smaller pores than microfiltration membranes: 2 nm <dp <50 nm where 1nm = 
10-9m. They are characterized by their cut-off which is the smallest molar mass of molecules rejected 
by the membrane which ranges between 2000 and 106 Dalton (Da). The mean transmembrane pressure 
higher than in microfiltration varies between 1 and 8 bar, as pores are smaller, and osmotic pressure 
which decreases effective ptm, is higher.
With proper cut-off, UF membranes can reject macromolecules, proteins, and colloids in addition 
to particles.
Applications: proteins concentration for cheese fabrication, electrophoretic paints recovery in automotive 
industry.
Osmotic pressure is moderate, as molar concentration is not high, Permeate fluxes are high.

Introduction
1.2.3	
Nanofiltration (NF)
Mean pores diameters of these membranes range from 0.5 nm to 2 nm, and their ptm between 5 and 25 
bar because of higher osmotic pressure and membrane resistance. Membranes can reject mean molecules 
of molar mass <2000 Da. It is an intermediate process between reverse osmosis (RO) and ultrafiltration. 
Applications: waste water treatment, extraction of small molecules, fractionation.
It is a more recent process as suitable membranes have appeared recently. Permeate fluxes are higher 
than in RO, but rejection rates are smaller.
1.2.4	
Reverse osmosis (RO)	 	
dp <0.5 nm	
ptm: 10–100 bar
These membranes are dense, without pores and reject molecules of molecular mass <300 Da, for example, 
salt, sugar, etc…
Applications: sea water desalination, pure water preparation, treatment of effluents and lactoserum.
Osmotic pressure:. Osmotic pressure Dp is given by
Dp=CRT	
where C= molar concentration, R=8.31 (SI units), T= absolute temperature
Dp increases with molar concentration, which is the case for small molecules. For example, salt water 
with 30 g/L of salt has a concentration of 500 mole/m3 and Dp=12.5 bar. If pure water at pressure p1 is 
separated from salt water at pressure p2 by a semi permeable membrane, and if p1 = p2, pure water tends 
to dilute salt water to adjust these concentrations. There will be no transfer if p2= p1 +Dp. Reverse osmosis 
corresponds to the case where p2> p1 +Dp and there will be a salt water transfer towards pure water. In 
microfiltration, osmotic pressure is negligible, as C is of the order of 1 mole/m3. In ultrafiltration, C will 
be of the order of 10 mole/m3 and Dp varies from 0.1 to 1 bar. In nanofiltration, C is around 100 mole/
m3 and Dp varies from 3 to 10 bar. In reverse osmosis, Dp varies from 10 to 40 bar. High transmembrane 
pressures are necessary to obtain important permeate flux in NF and RO. More generally, permeate fluxes 
decrease with decreasing pore size when changing from microfiltration to reverse osmosis. Solutes cross 
the membrane by solution-diffusion. Manufacturers of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are often the 
same as those of ultrafiltration.

Introduction
1.2.5	
Dialysis
Solute transfer through the membrane is carried out by diffusion and is proportional to concentration 
difference between both sides of the membrane. Thin ultrafiltration membranes are used to limit the 
resistance to diffusion. Mass flux is given by Js=k (Cs-CD) where k is the mass transfer coefficient, Cs is 
the solution concentration and CD is the concentration of dialysate, which circulates at counter-current 
in order to maximize transfers.
Main application: Hemodialysis (artificial kidney), delivered 3 times a week to about 2 millions of 
patients worldwide, with a production of 108m2 of membranes per year. The membrane eliminates 
water corresponding to the urine not produced by the patient. This process will be described in details 
in section 5.3.1.
Manufacturers: USA: Baxter, Extracorporeal. France: Hospal. Sueden: Gambro. Italy: Sorin. Germany: 
Fresenius. Japan: Toray, Nipro, Kuraray.
1.2.6	
Electrodialysis
Electrodialysis membranes are electrically charged and alternatively anionic (+) repelling anions (-) and 
cationic (-) repelling cations (+) with an electrical field perpendicular to membranes and supplied by 
two electrodes. Modules are of plane filter type with rectangular parallel membranes. Ion migration takes 
place in even compartments and pure water is collected in odd compartments Membranes are made 
of hydrophobic ion exchange resins with fixed charges (PO3
2-, COO-, NR3
+, PR3
+) separated by a grid.
Alternative: bipolar membranes (with positive and negative sides) permitting to separate positive and 
negative ions and acid and base.
Applications: desalination of brackish waters, demineralization and denitrification of drinking water and 
food products (cheese, lactoserum), metal salts recovery from rinsing water. Waste water treatment, amino 
acid separation, production of lactic acid by bipolar membrane, extraction of organic ions produced 
by fermentation.
Manufacturers: Eurodia (Tokuyama), Corning EIVS.

Pervaporation
In this process, permeate is vaporized under vacuum and recovered by condensation on a cold plate.
Applications: fractionation of volatile fluids (water-alcohol), desalcoholisation of wines and beer, 
dehydration of organic solutions. Concentration of ethanol by hydrophilic membrane (PVA). Extractions 
of organic compounds in permeate with silicon organophilic membranes.
Advantage: this process requires less energy than distillation and is more selective for volatile compounds.

Turbulent flow (Re >2600)
A transition regime between laminar and turbulent flows occurs when 2200<Re<2600. When the Reynolds 
rud/m number exceeds 2600, the flow becomes turbulent and the pressure drop Dp is proportional to a 
friction coefficient f depending upon Re and wall roughness and is given by the Moody diagram
For a plane channel of height h	 	
Dp = 1/2 f (L/h) v2 
(10)
For a cylindrical channel	
	
Dp = 1/2 f (L/d) v2 
(11)
where v is the mean velocity across the section. The velocity profile is no longer parabolic, but flat in 
the channel center, its variation occurs in boundary layers near the walls, which increases the shear rate 
near the wall for the same flow rate as in laminar.

2.3.2	
Solution containing macromolecules or particles suspensions
A layer of rejected molecules or particles deposits on the membrane and creates an additional resistance 
Rc which increases with time.
Rejected molecules create an osmotic pressure Dp which must be deducted from ptm.
J= (ptm- Dp)/ [m(R+Rc)]
(15)
Remarks: 1. Rc increases also with ptm and the flux J is no longer linear with ptm
2. If the temperature T increases, m decays and J rises.
2.3.3	
Concentration polarization
Definition: this phenomenon is due to the formation of macromolecules layer which occurs in UF, NF, 
and RO and limits permeate flux at high ptm. It can form in less than 1 min on the membrane. This layer 
may disappear if ptm is reduced

boundary layer thickness δ.

Fluid Mechanics
Consequences: This layer disappears if the ptm is cancelled. If the solute is completely rejected by the 
membrane, the condition of flux equality on each side of the membrane gives
JC=-D (dC/dx) where D is the solute diffusion coefficient
(16)
By integrating (16) from x=0 where C=Cw (membrane concentration) to x= δ where C=Ca, concentration 
at the surface of polarization layer, one obtains for the flux a plateau Jmax independent of ptm such that
Jmax = (D/δ) ln (Cw/Ca)		
in case of total rejection
(17)
where D/δ is the mass transfer coefficient. The macromolecule concentration Cw at membrane depends 
of the type of molecule. For instance, for albumin, Cw =300 g/L.
In case of partial rejection, permeate concentration is CF =SCw ≠0,
(18)
where S is the sieving coefficient, ratio of concentrations on each side of the membrane. In this case Eq. 
16 becomes
JC = -D (dC/dx) + S Cw

Assumption. In the boundary layer of thickness d, C =C(y) and the solute flux towards membrane is equal

Example of concentration polarization in milk ultrafiltration
Skim milk was ultrafiltered with a VSEP dynamic filtration module equipped with a vibrating membrane 
of 50 kDa cut-off at a TMP of 400 kPa. The permeate flux decays linearly in Fig. 5 with the logarithm 
of the volume reduction ratio (VRR= V0/V) according to (.21), where V0 is the initial volume and V the 
current one. The maximum VRR was determined by extrapolation at J=0 to be 8.66. The maximum VRR 
for a tubular module with the same membrane was only 5.6 and its permeate flux was lower.

Apparent rejection rate R’
The only concentrations easily accessible are those at the module inlet (Ce) or those of permeate (CF) 
and retentate outlet. It is then practical to define apparent rejection rates R’ and sieving coefficients S’ 
based on concentrations Ce and CF
R’= (Ce- CF)/ Ce

Calculation of mass transfer coefficient k
This coefficient permit to calculate permeate fluxes in various situations, using the Sherwood number 
Sh=kdh/D, where dh is the hydraulic diameter = 4S/P, S is the cross section area, P the perimeter. Another 
parameter, the Graetz number is G=vdh
2/ (LD) where L is the membrane length and D the diffusion 
coefficient d. For a circular tube of diameter d, the section will be S= pd2/4, the perimeter P= pd, and 
dh = d, as expected.
For a plane filter, S=bh, P=2(b + h), where b=width, h=thickness <<b,	
 dh=2bh / (b +h) ≈2h
In the case of laminar regime, with a Reynolds number <2200, corresponding to hollow fibers or plane 
filters, Blatt et al [1] have shown that, in concentration polarization regime, a relation between Sherwood 
and Graetz numbers exists

b)	 In the case of a plane filter of width b and n compartments of thickness h, the relation 
becomes if G>330:

The permeate flow rate for a plane filter with n compartments, and S=2nbL becomes
QF=2.2(SD/h)2/3 Q1/3ln (Cw/Ca)
(33)
Remarks: For both geometries, J rises if gw increases and L decreases. The permeate flux is proportional 
to Q1/3 and S2/3, and decreases along the membrane as the flow rate Q. In order to use these equations, 
one must know the diffusion coefficient D which is generally available for usual molecules.
In the case of turbulent regime, which occurs in tubular membranes, the empirical correlation of Chilton-
Colburn gives
Sh= 0.04Re3/4 Sc1/3

little from d. Eqs. 35 and 36 are only approximate and it is preferable to find empirical relations from

kt /k =0.00593 Re0, 57(L/d)0.33=2.8
(38)
for Re =2000 and L/d=200, which means that the laminar-turbulent transition augments the flux. It is 
then worthwhile to introduce turbulence promoters (obstacles inside the membranes) which increase

Various types of membranes and modules
3	 Various types of membranes 
and modules
3.1	
Organic membranes (cellulosic and polymeric)
These membranes are available as plane films and are used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration. Hollow 
fibers with internal diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm, are used in microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration 
and reverse osmosis.
Examples: cellulose acetate, polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, polypropylene, cellulose acetate, 
teflon, polyethersulfone (PES).
Membranes characteristics: they are thin, with thickness from 10 mm (symmetrical membranes) to 200 
mm (asymmetric or composites), available in the entire range of pores size from microfiltration to reverse 
osmosis. Asymmetric membranes contain a macroporous sublayer supporting the thin membrane.
Advantages: Their cost is moderate, from 30 €/m2 for spiral modules for reverse osmosis to 800 €/m2 for 
small plane cartridges for microfiltration. They are available in all configurations, tubular, hollow fibers, 
plane, and offer a large choice of cut-off and pores diameters.
Drawbacks: They do not allow steam sterilization, except for PVDF membrane. Their maximum pressure 
is low, 7–8 bars and their mean lifetime is 1 to 2 years.
Examples of ultrafiltration membranes
Pictures of Nadir® membranes PES 10, 50, 150 kDa and Ultran® PES 300 and 500 kDa are presented in 
Fig. 6.

Various types of membranes and modules
3.2	
Mineral membranes
Most of them are made in ceramic, but they also exist in zirconium oxide, carbon, or porous glass. Their 
thickness ranges from 2 to 3 mm, and they are mainly available in tubular and multichannel types.
Advantages: They are strong and can sustain extreme pH, chemical products, high temperatures and 
pressures and their lifetime exceeds 3 years. They also have high permeabilities. Membrane cleaning can 
be made in situ by retrofiltration. They can be steam sterilized.
Drawbacks: Their price is generally high and their dead volume is important except for small TAMI flat 
cartridges. Some membranes are available in nanofiltration.
Main manufacturers: TAMI Co (Nyons, France) commercializes tubular and multichannel ceramic 
membranes from 10 to 43 mm of outer diameter. Some have single circular channels, but most membranes 
are multichannel of various cross sections to maximize membrane area and increase permeate flux for a 
given module diameter. Membralox Society (in Tarbes France, but purchased by US Filter) manufactures 
ceramic modules with hexagonal section containing 19 circular channels.
3.3	
Various types of modules
3.3.1	
Plane modules
Manufacturers: France; Orelis. USA: Millipore.UK: Dorr Olliver. Germany: Sartorius. DDS, DK.
Principle: they contain parallel compartments each composed of two parallel membranes supported by 
plates with grooves separated by gaskets.
Advantages: they are easy to take apart to facilitate cleaning and membranes exchange and have small 
dead volumes. The thickness of liquid veins is adjusted by gaskets. Plastic plates can be reused.
Drawbacks: they are difficult to clean without been taken apart, and not available with mineral membranes.
3.3.2	
Plane cartridges
Manufacturers: USA: Millipore. France: Orelis, TAMI.
Principle: they are small plane filters consisting in several compartments assembled by glue, several 
cartridges are inserted inside a box. The presence of holes in plates permits fluid circulation.
Advantages: their dead volume is very small, they are compact, with adjustable area, and operate with 
small feed flows.

Various types of membranes and modules
Drawbacks: they are costly, difficult to clean, because of glued membranes. They are mostly used in 
laboratories and in pharmaceutical industry. TAMI cartridges are the only ones with ceramic membranes. 
3.3.3	
Spiral wound modules with organic membranes
Manufacturers: US: Millipore, Koch, Osmonics.
Principle: these modules are frequently used in industry, as they offer large membrane areas, and 
consist of a membrane, a grid and a plastic foil rolled around a tube which evacuates the permeate. 
These components are placed inside a rigid cylinder to sustain large pressures. They are much used in 
ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis for treatment of effluents and desalination of salt water. 
Advantages: their cost is small (30$/m2 for desalination of salt water) and their surface/volume ratio is high.
Drawbacks: they are subject to fouling, their performances are difficult to control, and their cleaning 
is difficult.
3.3.4	
Tubular modules
They are available with organic or mineral membranes (multi-channels), with inner diameters from 
2.5 mm to 30 mm.
Manufacturers: USA: Koch, PCI (organic), Millipore . France: TAMI (ceramic), Orelis, SCT. Germany: 
Schumacher, Aaflow, Wesfalia Separator.
Advantages: They are well suited to highly charged or very viscous liquids and are easy to clean.

Nomenclature
VR = Retentate dead volume, V= fluid volume in tank
Va = feed dead volume
Ca, CF, CR = feed, filtrate, retentate concentrations increase with time
Advantages: This bench permits to concentrate solutions to high ratios, due to recirculation.
Drawback: the recirculation into the tank requires a pump with high flow rate which must be volumetric 
to keep flow rate independent from ptm.

Diafiltration in single batch
The goal of diafiltration is to eliminate microsolutes without concentrating the rejected solute in retentate. 
The tank receives a water flow rate Qd =QF.. Thus, fluid volume in circuit remains constant and rejected 
solute concentration does not change.

Modelisation of membrane circuits

Modelisation of diafiltration
dV/dt =Qd-QF=0	
hence V=V0
(56)
Mass conservation on tank gives
V0dCa/dt=-QFCF=-QF (1-R’) Ca
(57)
If QF=const, and VF is permeate volume, integration of (57) over time gives
Ca=C0 exp[-QF(1-R’)t/V0] = C0exp[-VF/V0]
(58)
With partial rejection (R’<1), Ca decays exponentially while, if R ’=1, Ca=Ca0 and the retentate does not 
concentrate.
Example: if R ’=1, VF=V0, Ca/C0=0.36, 64% of microsolute has been eliminated. To eliminate 99% requires 
a filtration volume VF = 4.6 V0, according to (58).
Optimisation of a diafiltration
If the rejected solute is concentrated before diafiltration, this reduces the initial volume V0, but also the 
flux given by J=kln (Cw/C). It can be shown that diafiltration will be shorter if the fluid is concentrated 
until the optimal concentration Copt=Cw/2.73.

Batch with recirculation loop
Fig. 11. Bench with filtration module in recirculation loop
Advantage: by recirculating the retentate through the filter in the loop with a 2nd pump, fluid velocity 
v is increased along the membrane. The loop pump does not need to be volumetric as it only needs to 
overcome the pressure loss along the membrane. The feed pump, which supplies the loop pressure, will 
have a smaller flow rate than the loop pump, which saves energy. Loop concentration will be higher 
than the tank one and the rejection rate will be decreased.
Drawback: two pumps are necessary and concentration is higher in filter than in tank.

Continuous operation with loops in series and parallel modules
Fig. 12. Continuous process with recirculation loops
The system, presented in Fig.12, is fed continuously by a pump. Recirculation takes place in a series of 
loops. The VRR will not vary with time, but with the number of loops. Several steps are necessary to 
reach a high VRR, which requires a large membrane area and the system will be more complex.
Advantage: A feed tank is not necessary, and this circuit will consume less energy than a batch system 
with a tank. This process is used in plants with a large production.
Drawback: Membrane area is higher than in previous systems.

Experimental tests on pilots
Precautions
It is necessary to use a pilot with a complete instrumentation and pressure transducers before and after 
the filter. Pumps must be volumetric.
It is preferable to use the same filter type (tubular membrane, hollow fibers or plane module) as in the 
final system, in order to get a permeate flux representative of the industrial module.
Tests procedure
One can start with tests at constant concentration with full recycling of permeate and retentate on the 
tank. The pressure rise progressively during starting conditions and the flux J(t) and the pressure drops 
at constant ptm are measured for various fluid velocities. Then fluxes are measured at various ptm in 
stabilized conditions. Different membranes must be tested for screening. Concentration tests are carried 
out without permeate recycling at optimal ptm. The maximum VRR is given by
VRRmax= V0/Vdead
(72)
where V0 is the initial fluid volume and Vdead the dead volume of pipes.
4.7	
Membranes cleaning
A periodic cleaning is generally necessary to eliminate fouling layers and pores plugging in order to 
retain membranes performances. Membranes used in the food industry must be cleaned every day. This 
cleaning must be followed by rinsing with soft water demineralized by ion exchanger resins to eliminate 
traces of cleaning products. More generally, cleaning agents must eliminate organic compounds, micro-
organisms and dissolve mineral salts.

They include mineral salts (calcium carbonate, sulfates), hydroxides, biological films and organic matters 
(proteins, pectins) which constitute the main cause of fouling in, biological and food applications.

Membrane filtration processes

Modelisation of membrane circuits
Cleaning efficiency can be evaluated by measuring the hydraulic permeability of membranes with 
pure water after each cleaning. This permits to calculate the membrane resistance Rm defined by (12). 
Fouling resistance Rc defined by (13) can then be calculated from permeate flux of filtered solution. This 
resistance can be divided into an irreversible part Rir which remains after cleaning, and a reversible one 
Rr removed by cleaning. But the absence of chemical contamination by cleaning products and by living 
micro-organisms must be verified.
Fouling mechanisms
Membrane fouling reduces permeate flux with time, fast at first, as the reduction is due to the formation 
of a concentration polarization layer. Later, the reduction becomes slow and irreversible. Surface fouling 
is due to rejected particles forming a cake, deep fouling occurs by adsorption of particles or solutes 
which shrinks pores diameters.
Variation of permeate flux with time is measured at constant concentration, various circulation speeds of 
the fluid and different pressure rises. Internal fouling of pores can be evaluated by electronic microscopy. 
Biologic fouling caused by microorganisms is a major challenge in many processes. Its control requires an 
analysis of the biofilm deposited on the membrane, that can be made with confocal laser microscopy and 
image analysis. Biofilms can form during treatment of effluents containing inorganics salts with limited 
solubility, colloids and macromolecular organic compounds by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. These 
biofilms accelerate permeate flux decline.
Enzymatic cleaning
This cleaning permits to improve the efficiency of fouling removal when chemical treatments are 
not adapted. It consumes less energy than chemical treatments, but enzymatic detergents are more 
expensive and their action is slower. Enzymatic cleaning is frequently associated with alkaline and acid 
treatments. Most used enzymes are modified proteases (alcalase, durazyme, esperase, savinase) with 
pH from 7 to 11. This cleaning efficiently decreases the hydraulic resistance, but its disinfection may be 
insufficient as tension-active agents fixed on membrane may consume a good part of des disinfectants and 
chemical agents. Liquid enzymatic detergents actually seem to be the best, as their activity is conserved 
during storage.

Cross flow filtration against the concurrence
Microfiltration is frequently used for clarification of fluids in the food industry and as pretreatment before 
ultrafiltration or nanofiltration. Competitive processes are centrifugation, adsorption on kieselguhr, dead 
end filtration and decantation.
Ultrafiltration is well suited for concentration and fractionation of various components. Its competitors 
are distillation and evaporation.
Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are used for waste water treatment by elimination of small molecules 
such as ions and lactose in dairy industry and for desalination of salt water by reverse osmosis. Their 
main competitor is chromatography.

Applications of membrane processes
Advantages of membranes relatively to traditional processes
Membrane processes are continuous, and are easily automatized. They can operate during long periods 
without regeneration (24 hr in food industry). They offer better quality products, especially concerning 
water obtained from effluents. They permit the recovery of various constituents in permeate and retentate.

Applications to dairy industry
World dairy industry is one of major membrane consumers for lactoserum treatment and proteins 
valorization. Three membranes generations have been or are still utilized.

Cellulose acetate is no longer present because of its limitations in PH from 3 to 8 and in 
temperature with a maximum of 50°C.

Polysulfone manufactured by Amicon, Romicon and Techsep can support PH from 1 to 12, 
and a 75°C temperature, but does not resist well to chlorine disinfectantss.

A. Microfiltration
5.2.1	
Milk debacterisation by membrane (cold pasteurization)
The goal is to retain bacterias by the membrane while transmitting all proteins. A problem is that casein 
micelles are retained even with 0.8 µm pores and form a cake which rejects proteins. An alternative is 
the Bactocatch process of Alfa Laval using mineral membranes of 1.4 to 0.8 µm pores and a high fluid 
velocity of 8 m /s. To avoid a high inlet ptm, the permeate is recycled by a pump in the same direction 
as the retentate, that permits to keep a uniform ptm of 0.4 bar. This process is efficient, but energy cost 
is high.
5.2.2	
Casein extraction for cheese products
Casein micelles are retained in retentate, while soluble proteins cross the membrane into permeate. The 
process starts with a 1st microfiltration in order to concentrate the retentate three times with microfiltration 
membranes of 0.1 to 0.2 mm pores, followed by diafiltration until a VRR of 5. The purified micelles 
suspension is then dried and called native phospho-caseinate.
5.2.3	
Selective proteins separation
Casein is separated from soluble proteins aLa and bLg in order to make cheeses from UHT milk. It is 
concentrated until VRR =3. It is also possible to prepare milk with a reduced soluble proteins /casein 
ratio, after retaining micellar caseins by microfiltration. This ratio is reduced by a diafiltration diluting 
soluble proteins in permeate.

B. Ultrafiltration:
5.2.4	
Milk proteins standardisation
In order to compensate seasonal variations of milk proteins concentration which can perturb cheese 
fabrication in plants, a part of production is concentrated to a VRR of 2 to 4 and is mixed to the initial 
milk according to the needs to obtain the selected proteins concentration (from 35 to 45 g/L). This 
standardization permits to increase cheese proteins content and consequently to reduce the coagulant 
enzyme quantity, while insuring a stronger gel. Brewing and casting will be easier.
5.2.5	
Cheese Fabrication
The draining of traditional process is replaced by an ultrafiltration of proteins with a 10–15 kDa 
cut-off membrane. This process, called MMV from the initials of its inventors (Maubois et al) has 
been implemented and patented at INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Research) of Rennes. The 
ultrafiltration eliminates the major part of water, mineral salts and lactose, but retains all soluble proteins 
representing 20% of total proteins and caseins. The product is more homogeneous and reduces losses 
of nitric matters at 4% against 23%by draining. Rennet and ferments are introduced into the retentate 
together with the necessary cream quantity. Temperature is set at 60°C because of the high viscosity. The 
draining produces a proteins loss of 25% in lactoserum which is a polluting product. With ultrafiltration, 
100kg of milk contains 19 kg of proteins and 81 kg of lactoserum, against respectively 15 and 85 kg 
by draining. Rennet is added after ultrafiltration, permitting to save a part of it. The MMV process is 
utilized to make feta and soft cheese, camembert, brie, etc… The choice is between making cheese at 
low temperature <10°, to protect it from bacterial developments, but create prohibitive pressure losses 
because of the high viscosity at high concentrations, or to work at 50°C to diminish pressure losses with 
a risk of bacteria proliferation.
The best solution is to work at low temperature until a concentration ratio of about 3, and to reach the 
desired final concentration by heating the retentate at 50°C. This process is applied to the fabrication 
of Swiss cheese and feta, pressed cheese, such as saint Paulin and gruyere cheese. It permits to save 
15% of milk. For fresh cheeses which contain 82 % of water, the concentration ratio is limited to 2 and 
since the viscosity is moderate, one can operate at low temperature. For camembert and goat cheeses 
the temperature is limited to 4°C until the dry matter, essentially nitric proteins reach 10%, then the 
temperature is raised to 50°C until a concentration of 20% in nitric matters. Losses of nitric matters are 
only 5% with ultrafiltration against 17 to 23% with the traditional process.

Applications of membrane processes
Drawbacks
The augmentation of ions concentration (Ca, Mg, and Potassium) mixed with caseins in the same 
proportion as proteins may modify the cheese taste, which becomes more acid. To avoid this acidity, 
one can add salt at the end of ultrafiltration or diafiltrate the cheese for the saint Paulin and start a lactic 
maturation for fresh cheeses. It is also possible to ultrafilter a milk acidified by lactic ferments which will 
fix Ca et Mg ions on soluble micelles, and will permit their elimination in permeate..
Fabrication of fresh cheeses
This process begins by concentrating milk by ultrafiltration before its acidification and coagulation by 
rennet. To avoid an excessive acidity, the milk is heated during 20 s at 80°C, which reduces the acid taste.
Fabrication of soft cheeses
For camembert, milk is concentrated 5 times until a dry matter content of about 35%. Milk is slightly 
acidified until a pH of 6.4 and the retentate is diluted par diafiltration to adjust ionic balance. 90% of 
feta is prepared by the MMV process. Milk is also concentrated 5 times before being directly coagulated 
during cheese packing and this process is very much developed, especially in Denmark.
The MMV process cannot be applied to hard cheeses (gruyere), as it does not permit to obtain a high 
enough concentration for their fabrication.

Thermal treatment of milk at the farm
Normally, once milk has been collected from animals, it is kept at 4°C at the farm. Then, before 
distribution, it is heated at every four days at 72°C in order to destroy germs. It is not necessary to 
transport water and lactoserum, as only 20% of collected milk is consumed as milk or cheese. To avoid 
energy losses by heating, cooling, or transportation, milk can be ultrafiltered at the farm in order to 
add proteins and fat mass to retentate which represents only 20% of milk produced by the cows, while 
lactose and mineral salts that constitute the permeate are consumed in the farm by animals. This system 
is commercialized by Alpha Laval.
5.2.7	
Fractionation of lactoserum by draining
The lactoserum is a by-product of cheese fabrication, and a pollutant because of its high content in 
organic compounds exposed to aerobic fermentation. Its composition for cheese obtained by draining 
is the following: lactose: 47 g/l, proteins: 8 g/l, mineral salts: 7 g/l, fat mass: 1.5 g/l.
Production of one kg of cheese generates from 5 to 10 kg of lactoserum. Its evaporation gives a dry 
product containing 12 to 14% of proteins, which is not enough to be commercialized.
To reduce COD (chemical oxygen demand, responsible of pollution) and to augment proteins content, 
80% of proteins are recovered by ultrafiltration at 10 kDa, and permeate containing lactose is then 
treated by reverse osmosis. The retentate contains concentrated lactose, while the permeate, with a small 
quantity of organic pollutants can then be recycled in the plant. This process has been generalized since 
1965. Proteins can be concentrated 20 times and the final product containing 80% of proteins, as well 
as lactose, are valorized in children food. Concentrated lactose is also used in food industry.
C. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis
5.2.8	
Water treatment in processes from dairy industry.
This process is close to that of preceding section, but the ultrafiltration step is not necessary and is replaced 
by a nanofiltration, since milk is diluted in these effluents. Recovered proteins and lactose are valorized 
outside the food sector. To discharge effluents in rivers, a COD of less than 125 mgO2/l is necessary. For 
recycling them in a plant, the COD must be reduced to less than 50 mgO2/l and a final step of reverse 
osmosis is necessary. These processes are presently being developed.
5.2.9	
Yogurts fabrication
This fabrication starts with a nanofiltration replacing reverse osmosis or vacuum evaporation, as energy 
consumption during concentration is higher to that of nanofiltration. Yogurts prepared by nanofiltration 
are fat-free with a small acidity and their organoleptic qualities are better than those of yogurts made 
by reverse osmosis or vacuum evaporation.

Wines production
Musts concentration
Concentration of grapes musts by reverse osmosis improves their quality by eliminating part of contained 
water by reaching a dry matter concentration of 45° Brix with very good sugar content, higher than 
99.5%. Dupont de Nemours Co manufactures a filtration module operating at a pressure of 120 bar to 
exceed 45° Brix (1° Brix = 1 g of sucrose in 100 g of solution). Wines prepared from these musts are 
richer in phenol compounds and more suitable for aging. Ultrafiltration may also be used for treating 
musts in place of centrifugation and for reducing SO2 content. Microfiltration, with pores from 0.2 to 
0.6 µm, clarifies musts by eliminating residues from fermentation, yeasts and lactic bacterias and permits 
their sterilization. Microfiltration may also replace a pasteurization of musts with few germs or stop a 
microbial development.
Wine clarification
After fermentation and the first removal of yeast wastes, microfiltration can replace filtration steps on 
membranes and kieselguhr. Pollution by kieselguhr can be avoided, which saves time. Dead end filtration 
on a 0.2 µm pores cartridge is also used to sterilize the wine before bottling. Microfiltration increases the 
treatment efficiency of tartaric stabilization by cooling, due to colloids retention and avoids precipitation 
of potassium hydrogen tartrate. This treatment may also be made by electro- dialysis, which is used for 
treating rinsing water from tanks. It eliminates color matters and 70% of COD in permeate and recovers 
tartric acid and anthocyanes in retentate to valorize them.
Reverse osmosis permits to remove alcohol from wines after concentration, and replacing the permeate 
by the same water volume, which reduces the ethanol percentage. A preliminary step of ultrafiltration 
augments permeates fluxes of reverse osmosis.
Membrane filtration is mainly used for white and young wines. Trucks carrying filtration modules visit 
small producers who can filtrate their wines without having to purchase equipment.

Beer Microfiltration
Beer is traditionally filtered on kieselguhr or on press type filters. Cross flow microfiltration permits to 
avoid using kieselguhr and its pollution and to combine, in a single operation, beer clarification and 
sterilization by replacing pasteurization with an automated microfiltration. The two most interesting 
applications of microfiltration are presently the filtration of vintage beer and the recovery of left over 
beer in tanks that represents between 1.5 and 3% of produced volume, by concentrating it to 23% of 
dry weight. Microfiltration is carried out with tubular ceramic membranes of 0.4 to 0.8 µm pores and 
channel diameters of 4 to 6 mm, as yeast suspensions are quite viscous. Recovered beer is added to 
the main production. Membrane filtration of vintage beer is not competitive by itself, but it can be, if 
combined with tank bottom recovery.
It is, however, possible that the quality of microfiltered beer be worse in case of strong fouling due to loss 
of some molecular or colloïdal solutes such as polypeptids and polyphenols contributing to organoleptic 
characteristics of beer. Permeate fluxes vary from 10 to 50 lh-1m-2, but with membrane pores larger than 
0.8 µm, beer would be cloudy. Fouling is principally due to internal pores blocking and only retrofiltration 
with transmembrane pressure reversal (backshock) during 0.1s at intervals of 1 to 5 s is efficient.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Clarification of fruits juice (Apple, ananas)
Microfiltration can replace decantation to stabilize juices and avoid fermentation. It is especially 
interesting for apple juice, which requires a good clarity and may be also used for cider clarification, 
but the technology is more complex. To augment flux, apple juices are treated with pectinase and filtered 
at 50°C. Pores sizes from 1 to 0.2 µm give good results, but it is also possible to use ultrafiltration with 
a cut-off larger than 50 kDa. To reduce transportation costs, apple juices may be concentrated to 25° 
Brix by reverse osmosis at 50°C.
Cider contains yeasts and fermentation residues, ethanol and CO2 and must be treated by microfiltration. 
Permeate fluxes reach 70–110 lh-1m-2 on mineral membranes of 0.2 µm pores.
5.3.4	
Other applications
Sugar refining
Ultrafiltration is used to decolorize sugar cane or beets syrups by eliminating polysaccharides and colloids. 
Syrup fabrication is rather complex and starts with cane crushing or cutting beets in small pieces. The 
next steps are liming by limestone milk, a first carbonation by CO2, and a decantation with elimination 
of muds. A 2nd carbonation is carried out producing a cloudy juice, which is clarified by ultrafiltration at 
15° Brix. After evaporation, the syrup reaches 70° Brix. One can also filtrate membrane juices obtained 
by hydrolysis of starch.
Concentration and clarification of gelatin.
Gelatin is a colloidal protein substance obtained by acqueous extraction at high temperature from animal 
skins and bones. Its clarification is made by microfiltration in case of high COD and liquid gelatin can 
be concentrated until 20% of proteins by ultrafiltration.
Recovery of vegetal proteins (ultrafiltration of soya juice).
Ultrafiltration at high temperature of soya juice (tonyu) permits to concentrate dry matter while 
eliminating trypsic inhibitors and unwanted soluble sugars. Ultrafiltered tonyu is mellower, more viscous 
and gelatinizes at high concentration. Curdled of soya (tofu) may be concentrated by ultrafiltration on 
mineral membranes.
Pectins concentration by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis
Pectins are used as additives in fabrication of jellies, jams, desserts and children food. They stabilize 
and thicken also dressings for salads and ice creams. They permit to elaborate some medicaments and 
cosmetics due to their colloidal properties. Pectins also reduce cholesterol. They are extracted mainly 
from apple and lemon waste by alcoholic precipitation and evaporation.

Applications of membrane processes
The membrane process begins by an extraction from a tank containing water and acid, pectins are then 
pressed before ultrafiltration. The retentate supplies liquid pectins at a concentration of 60g /l while 
permeate is recycled on the tank. This permeate can also be recycled into a reverse osmosis module to 
recover valorizable products, while permeate of pure water is returned to the extraction tank.
The advantages of membrane processes are a better purification of sugar and mineral salts, by elimination 
in permeate of microsolutes, a partial bleaching of the product by elimination of colored compounds in 
permeate and a diminution of consumed power relatively to evaporation. High temperature treatments 
are also avoided.

Medical and biotechnological applications

Treatment of renal insufficiency by artificial kidney (Hemodialyzers)
Hemodialysis (blood dialysis) is used in case of chronic insufficiency (glomerules sickness) or renal 
arteries injuries when 90% of nephrons do not function. It consists in circulating patient’s blood at a 
flow rate between 200 and 300 ml/min in a hemodialyzer containing an ultrafiltration membrane which 
eliminates urea and uremic toxins of blood by diffusion into the dialysate, an ionic fluid circulating on the 
other side of the membrane. A schematic of dialysis equipment is presented in Fig.13. Blood is collected 
by a needle in an arm artery by a roller pump and circulates in the dialyzer before being reinjected in 
a vein. The circuit also includes an arterial pressure transducer, an heparin injector to avoid formation 
of blood clots and a photoelectric detector of bubbles in blood.

Applications of membrane processes
The dialysate eliminates toxins and excess water, but retains plasma ions as they have the same 
concentration as in dialysate, preventing their diffusion. It circulates in opposite direction to blood at a flow 
rate of 500 ml/min in order to maximize transfers and is not normally recycled. This treatment requires 
3 dialysis sessions of 4h per week, together with dietetic restrictions to limit water and potassium intake. 
They are in France more than 30000 dialyzed patients and about 2 millions in the world. Hemodialyzers, 
which were initially plane filters are now mostly made of hollow fibers. These fibers are either cellulosic, 
cuprophan, or polymeric, (polysulfone, poly acrylonitrile, PMMA) more hemocompatible and with 
higher permeability than cuprophan.
Toxins removal is measured by the clearance K in ml/min which is the ratio mass flow rate crossing 
the membrane, QBiCBi –QB0CB0, divided by the toxin concentration at the hemodialyzer inlet CBi, giving
K= (QBiCBi –QB0CB0)/ CBi
(73)
where QBi et QBO = QBi –QF are respectively inlet and outlet blood flow rates and CBi , CBO the corresponding 
toxin concentrations. If ultrafiltration is small or zero, the clearance K is calculated as function of blood 
and dialysate flow rates, membrane area S and filtration resistance RT of the hemodialyzer by
K= (eα -1)/(eα – QB/QD)
(74)
where α = (S/ RT)(QB

Membrane filtration processes

Applications of membrane processes
This clearance does not depend upon toxin concentration in blood and patient condition. However, for 
a dialysate solute present in the hemodialyzer such as sodium ion Na+, the clearance is replaced by the 
dialysance D, defined by
D = (QBiCBi –QB0CB0)/ (CBi- CDi),
(76)
where CDi is solute concentration at inlet of dialysate compartment of hemodialyzer.
Hemofiltration
This treatment consists in purifying blood only by convection using ultrafiltration without dialysate. 
The filtration rate QF must be of the order of 120 ml/min, which requires a blood flow rate through the 
needle of at least 300 ml/min. Mass balance on the hemodialyzer will be
QBiCBi –QB0CB0= QF CF
(77)
And clearance becomes
K = CF CBi / CBi =Tr QF
(78)
where Tr = CF/ CBi is the transmittance. This transmittance is equal to 1 for small solutes and decays 
towards zero when the solute molar mass becomes close to membrane cut-off.
The advantage of this process is its simplicity and the fact that clearance of various toxins decreases more 
slowly with molar mass than in dialysis where transfer is diffusive. This transfer is more physiologic 
and gives a better hemodynamic stability. It necessitates, however, polymeric membranes with high 
permeability and an accurate control of ultrafiltration. Sterile dialysate must be injected into the blood 
returning to patient to replace a part of permeate, which can reach 28 l, exceeding the water volume 
that will be withdrawn and varies from 1 to 4 l. This sterile dialysate is expensive.
Hemodiafiltration
Hemodiafiltration is used more frequently than hemofiltration. It combines hemodialysis and a strong 
ultrafiltration, with 12 to 15 l of ultrafiltered volume. This process gives the best clearance as it combines 
an efficient diffusion of urea and a good convection for middle molecules, toxins of high molar mass. Its 
clearance is more difficult to calculate as blood and dialysate flow rates vary along the membrane. An 
empirical equation, also valid in conventional hemodialysis with a small UF is [3]
KHDF = KD + 0.46 QF
(79)
15% of renal patients in France are treated by hemodiafiltration.

Preparation of human albumin in transfusion centers
This process necessitates three steps after collecting human plasma in a bag. Ethanol is added to 
precipitate immunoglobulins. Then, alcohol is eliminated by diafiltration of supernatant albumin. The 
last step is a concentration of retentate proteins by ultrafiltration at 10kDa until albumin concentration 
reaches 210 g/L, which is required for an injection. The process temperature is less than 10° C to avoid 
denaturing proteins.
5.4.3	
Plasma collection from donors
Treatment of auto-immune diseases consists in replacing pathologic plasma by a healthy one. Donor’s 
blood is withdrawn by a needle connected to a peristaltic pump and circulates in a filter to separate 
plasma, collected in a bag, from permeate, while platelets and red cells in retentate are returned to the 
donor. These filters were made initially of hollow fibers type with pores diameters from 0.2 to 0.5 µm, 
but, in 1985, Hemascience Co (Ca, USA) introduced a dynamic filtration module with a cylindrical 
polycarbonate membrane of 58 cm2 area and 1.34 cm radius, rotating inside a concentric cylinder at 3600 
rpm/min. This single use filter, represented in Fig. 14, permitted to collect 600 to 700 ml of plasma in 
30 min, more rapidly than a hollow fibers filter of 300 cm2, because of its high shear rate due to Taylor 
vortices generated by rotation (Fig. 15).

The small internal volume of this rotating filter limits the residence time of blood inside, reducing 
hemolysis risks for red cells and damages to platelets. This Plasmacell filter, commercialized later by 
Baxter Co and now by the German Company Fresenius Kabi with a nylon membrane, is very successful 
for plasma donation as it is automatized.

Preparation of bioethanol by membrane
European production of bioethanol from fermentation of sweet compounds has been mutiplied by two 
from 2005 to 2006 with 1.6 millions of liters produced and this trend will continue if the project of mixing 
10% of bioethanol to gasoline will take place. The necessary water must be treated by nanofiltration 
and reverse osmosis, while the biomass will be clarified by microfiltration and ultrafiltration before its 
fermentation. Ultrafiltration is used for concentrating the product before its treatment in an anaerobic 
digester. Effluents resulting from this fabrication may be treated by membrane bioreactors.
A new type de bioethanol is produced from vegetal biomass issued from straw, trees and herbs in order 
not to use beets and other products consumed by man. In this case, biomass is purified by a microfiltration 
ad an ultrafiltration so as to limit risks of contamination of the fermentor. Nanofiltration and reverse 
osmosis permit to pour concentrate the product before anaerobic digestion.
Production of pure apyrogenic water for dialysis centers and pharmaceutical industry
This process combines microfiltration + reverse osmosis with a final microfiltration, before utilization.
Cell culture on membrane permitting oxygen supply
An example is the macro-encapsulation of Langerhans islets inside hollow fibers for a bioartificial pancreas 
or of hepatocytes for hepatic support.
5.4.5	
Biological treatment of effluents by membrane bioreactors (MBR)
The principle of this treatment is to intensify bacterias proliferation in effluents by air injection and to 
use them to degrade pollutants. The MBR consists in a tank receiving water and containing biomass, or 
activated sludge, which is recirculated on the tank after crossing membrane modules of ultrafiltration 
or microfiltration. The retentate returns to the tank and excess sludge is discarded while permeate is 
recovered as rinsing water. MBR replace decantation ponds of the conventional process for separating 
biomass from effluent by gravity. Anaerobic processes are used to eliminate carbonic pollutants from 
concentrated dairy effluents. This process includes a 1st step of hydrolysis in which proteins and fats are 
hydrolyzed into amino-acids, fatty acids and small molecules. The 2nd step is a methanization converting 
metabolites in methane and CO2.

Applications of membrane processes
Advantages:
Biomass concentration in the MBR is about 20g/L instead of 3g/l in a reservoir, which increases effluent 
purification and reduces sludge production. Effluent is less polluted. Concentrations can reach 300 g/l 
for yeast and more than 120 g/l for bacterias. The replacement of decantation ponds by MBR saves a lot 
of space. This process is used in new buildings in Japan and spreads rapidly in industry.
Drawbacks
The cost of filtration plant (investment and electricity) is higher and technology is more complex. In 
France, Biarritz is one of the few large cities using MBR for water and waste cleaning.
Systems types and manufacturers
Degremont MBRs are equipped with mineral membranes and Orelis MBR with organic membranes. 
Initially the filter was in a loop outside the MBR. But Japanese companies, and Veolia Environment, 
have proposed to immerse U-shaped hollow fibers inside the MBR to avoid recirculation and reduce 
energy consumption. Permeate fluxes were smaller because of dead-end filtration, but compressed air 
could be used to clean membranes.
5.4.6	
Treatment of specific effluents
Paper industry
This industry produces 100 m3 of effluents per ton of paper pulp. Ultrafiltration is used to recover and 
concentrate before recycling lignite and colour compounds. Mineral membranes permit to work at 120°C. 
The effluent is purified by nanofiltration. These processes are frequently used in Scandinavia.
Textile industry
Filtration permits to recover gluing agents of threads, non biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol, colour agents 
and indigo.
Oil removal from cutting fluids
During parts machining, the tool is lubricated by spraying oil to cool the part and evacuate the chips, 
then the part is rinsed by spraying water. This water contains less than 1% of emulsified oil forming 
droplets of 0.1 to 1µm diameter. Resulting pollutant emulsions can be separated by chemical methods or 
by microfiltration or ultrafiltration at 70°C. The membrane retains oil drops. Water from ultrafiltration 
permeate is recycled and oil from retentate, representing 5 to 10% of initial effluent volume, can be 
reused as cutting oil or be concentrated to more than 50% and incinerated

Applications of membrane processes
Waste water treatment from nuclear plants
The radioactivity of water from cooling circuits is due to iron hydroxide in saline medium. This water 
is concentrated by ultrafiltration or microfiltration to obtain recyclable water and a small volume of 
radioactive sludge, which will be vitrified.
Electrophoretic paints recovery
The part to be painted, for instance an automobile door, is immersed into a paint tank with pigments 
electrically charged. These pigments are projected on the door by an electric field created in the tank 
which produces a uniform paint layer. This process creates three problems:
--
the presence of external ions issued from the part may perturb ionic balance by keeping the 
paint as colloïdal suspension and make the paint inadequate.
--
a large quantity of deionized water is necessary to rinse the metal part and get rid of excess paint.
--
the paint must be separated from rinsing water to recover pigments and to avoid pollution.
To this effect, an ultrafilter must be inserted in the recirculation circuit of paint on the tank. Paint particles 
and pigments are rejected by the membrane while external ions are removed in permeate. Paint contained 
in rinsing water is returned to the tank and permeate is recycled as rinsing water which reduces water 
consumption. Membranes are in cellulose acetate or in polyacrylonitril. Paint consumption is greatly 
reduced and this process is much used in the car industry.

Process optimization by a technico-economic method
The goal of this method is to minimize by an optimal choice of fluid velocity v, the total cost per par m3 
of permeate (investment, operating and energy costs, and maintenance).
Method
Permeate flux data are obtained from experimental tests on pilots as
J=C1vm, 	
(80) 	
	
and the pressure drop by 	
Dp=C2vn
(81)
Economic data
The investment cost I of circuit +membranes is given by the ratio of price to utilization duration and 
maintenance M, will be assumed to be a fraction of I, for example: M=0.2 I.
Costs proportional to pumps power (consumed energy) are separated. For example, the power of loop 
pump PB with flow rate QB will be augmented by 20% to take into account power of feed pump and 
cooling circuit, to give.
PB =QB DpB with QB =Sv, where S= section area between parallel membranes
(82)
The cost per m3 of permeate Cp, if h is the pumps efficiency, Cj the cost of electric joule, S the membrane 
area, is given by
Cp=PBPj/(hQF) =C3vn+m-1 with C3=C2 S/(C1S h)
(83)
(83) shows that Cp increases when v rises.
Costs proportional to membrane area S, are amortization A and maintenance M. This cost per m3 of 
permeate IA is equal to
IA = (A+M)/QF = C4v-m
(84)
If v increases, IA decreases. There is an optimal speed v minimizing I =IA + Ip that can be found from a 
graph or by calculating the value of v giving dI/dv=0.
This calculation is described in Fig. 15 which displays variations of amortization and operating costs as 
function of fluid speed along membranes.

High shear rate dynamic filtration
6	 High shear rate 
dynamic filtration
Dynamic filtration is a relatively recent process which necessitates special filtration modules, able to 
generate shear rates at membrane much higher than in crossflow filtration. A review of these systems 
can be found has been made by the author [4].
6.1	
Principle of dynamic filtration
The axial fluid velocity is replaced by the rotation of a disk relatively to the membrane (rotating disk 
modules) or by the rotation of the membrane around an axis or by fluid inertia in modules with vibrating 
membranes such as the VSEP of New logic, CA USA.
Advantages:
In classical cross flow filtration, the high axial fluid velocity produces a large pressure loss along the module 
and a high inlet ptm, while the high shear rates independent from the flow rate of dynamic filtration 
eliminates the fouling layer on membrane, and reduces concentration polarization in ultrafiltration and 
nanofiltration. The main advantages are
--
A smaller feed flow rate, producing a smaller ptm, which is ideal for extracting macromolecules.
--
Permeate flux larger than in crossflow filtration for microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration 
and reverse osmosis.
--
An excellent transmission of solutes in microfiltration and a higher rejection of micro-solutes 
by the membrane in ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, since diffusive transfer 
is reduced by the diminution of concentration polarization.
--
The possibility to operate at very high concentrations, even in reverse osmosis.
These modules offer the choice to increase permeate fluxes by 3 to 5 times with slightly higher energy 
consumption or to produce fluxes equivalents to those of crossflow filtration by reducing the rotation 
speed of disks or membranes. In this case, the reduction of consumed energy per m3 of permeate can 
reach 60%.
Drawbacks:
Dynamic filtration modules are more complex and expensive per m2 of membrane. The cost of their 
maintenance is also generally higher than for crossflow filtration modules.

Industrial systems of dynamic filtration
6.2.1	
Modules with rotating cylindrical membrane
These systems consist in a cylindrical membrane rotating inside a concentric cylindrical housing like 
the Plasmacell of Fig 14 and take advantage of Taylor vortices which develop in the gap like in Fig. 15 
and increase the shear rate by comparison with a Couette flow between two parallel plates with one 
moving relatively to the other. These vortices are created above a specific rotation speed such that the 
Taylor Nb Ta given by
Ta = (w R1/2e3/2)/n 
(85)
exceeds 42, where w is the membrane angular velocity in radian/s, R is the membrane radius, e the radial 
gap between membrane and outer cylinder and n the kinematic viscosity.
GI Taylor [5] has also proposed the following equation for the shear rate γ at membrane
γ= 0.23 Ta1/2 ωR/e =0.23 ω3/2R5/4e-1/4 ν-1/2
(86)
which is valid for 60<Ta< 3000, and covers laminar and turbulent regimes.
Holeschowsky and Cooney [6] have used a Membrex module with a rotating cylindrical membrane to 
ultrafilter bovine albumin at a ptm of 800 kPa and have proposed for Sherwood number Sh
Sh = km e/D =0.93Ta0.5Sc1/3
(87)
where km is the mass transfer coefficient and D is the diffusivity.
The first industrial modules of this type were the Biodruckfilter of Sulzer AG, (Winterthur, Switzerland) 
and the Benchmark Rotary Biofiltration of Membrex (Garfield, NJ, USA) with membranes area of the 
order of 2 m2. It is in fact possible to mount a 2nd membrane fixed inside the concentric housing which 
would supply the same permeate flux as the other membrane. But these modules have a large volume/
membrane area ratio which is a drawback. The main application of this concept is still the Plasmacell 
used for plasma donation described in section 5.4.3. It can be noted that the permeate rotates with the 
membrane, which produces a counter-pressure decreasing the ptm.

Systems with disks rotating on a single shaft
These systems are composed of separate compartments, each containing a metal disk rotating between 
two fixed circular membranes. A membranes change requires taking apart the module. One of first 
systems was the Pall DMF (USA) with 5 m2 of organic membranes, but it is no longer sold. Bokela 
Co (Germany) commercializes the Dyno filter, along the same principle, with 1 to 12 m2 of organic or 
inorganic membranes of 0.14 to 0.85 m of diameter, represented in Fig.17. Maximum pressure is 6 bar, 
and permits ultrafiltration.

Another system produced by Metso Paper Co at Raisio (Finland) may include from 2 to 140 m2 of 
organic membranes with diameters up to 1 m (Fig. 18). Disks are replaced by rotors with a peripheral 
velocity reaching 14 m/s with a 132 kW motor. Modules of 84 m2 and 75 kW or 15 m2 and 30 kW 
with membrane diameters of 0.55m are also available. These modules are frequently used in paper mill 
industry and for pigments recovery.
Fig 18: Optifilter CR module with rotating disks
Bouzerar et al [7] have proposed, from Navier Stokes theory, equations for local membrane shear rate 
as function of radius r. In laminar regime, this shear rate is given by
gl = 0.77 (ke ω) 1.5 r ν-0.5
(88)
where ke is the coefficient of fluid stirring by the disk equal to 0.42 for a flat disk and which can reach 
more than 0.82 for a disk equipped with radial vanes. In turbulent regime, they found, by using Blasius 
friction coefficient, the local shear rate gt (r)
gt = 0.0296 (keω) 1.8 r1.6 ν-0.8
(89)
The averaged shear rate on a disk of radius R becomes, by integrating (89) on the disk area
gtm = 0.0164 (keω)1.8 R1.6 ν-0.8 = 0.55 gmax
(90)
where gmax is the maximum shear rate at r=R, at membrane periphery.

The Spintek, produced in United States, use circular membranes rotating between fixed plates (Fig. 19) 
whose area may reach 2.3 m2 and is available with organic or ceramic membranes. These modules, with 
separate compartments, have limited membrane area unlike modules described in section 6.2.2.
Fig. 19. Spintek module with organic or ceramic membranes of 2.3m2 total area 
Their membrane shear rate is, however, higher than for fixed membranes and is given by,
in laminar regime	
	
gdl = 1.81 (keω)1.5 r ν-0.5,
(91)
 and in turbulent regime	
gdt = 0.057 (keω)1.8 r1.6 ν-0.8
(92)
Since permeate rotates with the membrane, it produces a counter pressure which reduces ptm like for 
cylindrical membrane modules.
6.2.3	
Systems with membrane disks rotating around parallel axes
These systems consist in a housing in which ceramic membranes rotate around one or several shafts. 
Replacing membranes is then easier than in preceding modules and they can receive large membrane 
areas. The MSD (multishaft disks) from Westfalia Separator (Aalen, Germany), is available with ceramic 
membrane disks of 31 cm diameter mounted on 8 shafts for 20 to 80 m2 of membranes area as shown 
in Fig. 20. The partial membranes overlap augments their shear rate and the permeate flux. Another 
system, the RotoStream, from Canzler (Germany) is available with ceramic membrane disks membranes 
with areas up to 154 m2 and Hitachi (Japan) commercializes filtration modules with up to 100 m2 of 
membranes area. These two modules have parallel shafts located in one plane and not on a cylinder as 
the MSD, which reduces membranes overlap.

where d is the inter-shaft distance. This speed was 7.4 m/s at 1037 rpm and 13.7 m/s at 1930 rpm, which 
is 50% higher than the peripheral membrane speed.
The SSDF module of KMPT (Germany) can receive up to 15m2 of ceramic membranes on two shafts but 
is also available with 25 m2 of composite membranes for microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration, 
The Novoflow (Oberndorf, Germany), sells two single shaft modules with ceramic membranes of UF 
and MF, the CRD with 15.2 cm diameter membranes of 5 m2 area and the SSDF with membranes 31.2 
cm diameter membranes of 15 m2 area. The module SSDF can also receive composite membranes of 55 
cm diameter for MF, and NF with an area of 25 m2.

Systems with vibrating membranes
The most popular system is the VSEP (Vibratory shear-enhanced processing) introduced by New Logic 
Research (Ca, US) in 1992 [9] which consists in a stack of circular organic membranes separated by 
gaskets and permeate collectors vibrating azimuthally around a vertical axis at a frequency of about 60.3 
Hz and an amplitude of 2.5 to 3 cm. The membrane shear rate is created by the fluid inertia, out of phase 
relatively to membranes. Fig. 21a represents a laboratory pilot equipped with a single membrane and 
Fig. 21b shows details of membrane and its gaskets and support in the housing. Oscillations frequency is 
close to the resonant frequency, which minimizes the power necessary to create these oscillations, which 
is only 9 kW for a total membrane area of 150 m2. Laboratory pilots have 30 cm diameter membranes, 
while those of industrial modules are 60 cm in diameter. Fig. 22 displays fluid circulation inside a VSEP 
with several compartments and Fig. 23 shows industrial modules with 150 m2 of membrane area.

These systems can sustain pressures of 40 bar, permitting nanofiltration and reverse osmosis in addition 
to microfiltration and ultrafiltration. The membrane shear rate is determined by oscillations frequency 
and varies sinusoidally with time according to the following equation [10]

VSEP modules are relatively frequent in USA, Canada and in Eastern countries (Japan, Malaysia, and 
China). They are less used in Europe, perhaps because of the presence of German dynamic filtration 
modules. It is also possible to vibrate longitudinally vertical hollow fibers cartridges close at the bottom 
at a frequency of 30 Hz amplitude of 0.4 to 2.4 mm. (Fig. 25, Beier et al [11]). But these systems are not 
yet commercialized as their shear rates are smaller than those of VSEP.

Summary
7	 Summary
The various processes of membrane filtration (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse 
osmosis, electrodialysis and pervaporation) used in industry have been presented in the 1est chapter. A 
review of basic fluid mechanics has been given in the 2nd chapter in order to supply equations describing 
the flow inside filtration modules and their circuits. Methods for calculating permeate fluxes in laminar 
and turbulent regimes were also given. Chapter 3 describes various types of membranes and modules 
together with their advantages and drawbacks. Chapter 4 presents a modelisation of flows in filtration 
circuits including recirculation loops with modules in series and in parallel, which are frequent in industry. 
This modelisation permits to calculate variations of permeate and retentate concentrations with time.
Chapter 5 presents the main applications of these processes, especially those of food and dairy industries 
and a technico-economic method permitting, from filtration experimental and economic data, to 
calculate the power consumed and the process cost and to determine the optimal fluid velocity inside the 
membranes leading to a minimum cost per m3 of permeate. Chapter 6 describes the principle of dynamic 
filtration, a recent process, creating very high shear rates by using rotating disks, and rotating or vibrating 
membranes. These modules produce permeate fluxes much higher than in cross flow with smaller 
feed flow rates, since the shear rate is independent of feed flow rates. They also permit excellent solute 
transmissions in microfiltration and a higher rejection of microsolutes in ultrafiltration, nanofiltration 
and reverse osmosis, since the diffusive transfer is reduced by a diminution of concentration polarization.

Exercice 2. Diafiltration process with variable volume
A solute of total mass Mp and concentration Cp (t) is concentrated by diafiltration with a membrane 
module operating in single batch (voir Fig 10), while eliminating another solute of concentration Ca (t) 
which is not rejected. Initial concentrations are Cp0 et Ca0 and final ones are Cpf et Caf. Permeate flux is 
given in l/hm2 by
Jv= (B1 + B2 Cp +B3 Ca)-1 when concentrations are expressed in g/l
1.	 Calculate the duration t1 of concentration phase (without adding water) to concentrate the 
solute Cp until its final concentration Cpf. Deduce the normalized duration T1 for treating 1 kg 
of solute with 1 m2 of membrane. Assume B’1 = B1 +B3 Ca0
2.	 Calculate the normalized duration T2
 of diafiltration phase at constant volume which brings 
Ca to its final value Caf, if concentration is finished when Cp = Cpf. Assume B’2 = B1 + B2 Cpf
3.	 The goal is to combine these 2 operations in a single phase by adding a water flow rate QD 
related to permeate flow rate QF by QD=QF (1 -1/α) where α is constant. Determine, with mass 
conservation equations, a relation between Ca and Cp, initial concentrations and α. Find the 
value of α permitting to reach the final state. Calculate the normalized duration T3 of this 
single phase process.

permeate, if the Kwh price is 0.07 €.
2.	 Membranes cost is 4300€/m2 and they are amortized over 3 years. The price of de filtration 
unit (without membranes) is 1400 €per m2 of membrane, amortized over 8 years with 7000

The goal is to concentrate, by a factor of 8 in volume, milk proteins using a continuous process with 
2 loops (see Figure.below). Inlet proteins concentration is Ca, their sieving coefficient S’, based upon 
retentate concentration (to simplifiy its calculation) is S’ = CFi/CRi = 0.1 for both loops (i =1,2). The feed 
flow rate is Qa = 3 m3/h.

2)	 From mass balances of each loop, calculate proteins concentration ratio of each loop, CR1/
Ca, CR2/CR1 and the total concentration ratio CR2/Ca, and deduce the final recovery factor in 
retentate r = CR2 QR2/CaQa.
3)	 It is assumed that permeate fluxes of each loop (i = 1, 2) are given by Ji = kLn(Cw/CRi) where 
k = 25 l/hm2 and Cw = 10 Ca are the same for each loop. Calculate membrane areas A1 and A2 
of each loop.
4)	 Because of internal pores fouling, the permeate flow rate decayed to 1.44 m3/h in the 1st loop 
and to 0.61 m3/h for the 2nd. Calculate the new retentate flow rates, the total VRR, the total 
concentration ratio C’R2/Ca, and the new recovery factor r’ in retentate.
5)	 Find the feed flow rate Q’a necessary to obtain the initial VRR of 8, with filtration flow rates of

where J0 is the initial flux and A the membrane area. Roots of a 2nd degree equation
ax2 + bx +c =0 are x= (-b ±√(b2-4ac))/2a.
Exercice 7. Cascade filtration
A solution contains two solutes a and b at concentrations Ca0 and Cb0. The goal is to eliminate solute a 
with higher molecular weight while recovering and concentrating solute b. The filtration system is given 
in the figure below. The solution is divided in 2 tanks 1 and 2 containing respectively initial volumes V10 
et V20 The 1st filter retains solute a in tank 1 with a rejection rate R’a given by CFa =Ca(1-R’a) and transmits 
completely solute b. Tank 2 is fed by permeate of filter 1. The 2nd filter, completely rejects both solutes, 
and is used to concentrate solute b. All flow rates, including QF1 et QF2, are constants.
1)	 1st circuit. Write volume and mass balance equations on this circuit (Tank 1+filter 1). Calculate 
variations of V1(t) and Ca(t) with time. Find solute b concentration in permeate flow rate 
QF1. Integral of dx/(A+Bx) = (1/B)ln(A+Bx) +C.
2)	 Concentration stops when tank 1 and circuit volume reaches a value Vm. Calculate the 
circuit VRR, the process duration and the final concentration ratio of solute a (Caf1/Ca0). 
Numerical application: V10 =900 L, Vm =30 L, QF1= 120 L/m, R’
a =0.95.
3)	 2nd circuit. Solute b is in tank 2 and filter 2 which operates simultaneously with the 1st circuit 
(same filtration duration). At t=0 this circuit is filled with a volume V20 =20 L containing solutes 
at their initial concentrations Ca0 and Cb0. Calculate the final volume in tank 2 V2f if QF2 = 0.8 
QF1 together with final concentration ratios Caf2/Ca0 et Cbf/Cb0 in this tank, for data of question 2.
4)	 Using volume and mass balance equations on circuit 2, find a differential equation for Cb which 
would permit to find the variation Cb(t).
