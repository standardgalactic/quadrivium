1. Basic Definitions
1.1. Deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A is a nonempty set G together with a law of composition (a, b) →a ∗b :
G × G →G satisfying the following axioms:
(a) (associative law) for all a, b, c ∈G,
(a ∗b) ∗c = a ∗(b ∗c);
(b) (existence of an identity element) there exists an element e ∈G such that a ∗e = a =
e ∗a for all a ∈G;
(c) (existence of inverses) for each a ∈G, there exists an a′ ∈G such that
a ∗a′ = e = a′ ∗a.
If (a) and (b) hold, but not necessarily (c), then G is called a semigroup. (Some authors
don’t require a semigroup to contain an identity element.)
We usually write a ∗b and e as ab and 1, or as a + b and 0.
Two groups G and G′ are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one correspondence a ↔a′,
G ↔G′, such that (ab)′ = a′b′ for all a, b ∈G.
Remark 1.2. In the following, a, b, . . . are elements of a group G.
(a) If aa = a, then a = e (multiply by a′). Thus e is the unique element of G with the
property that ee = e.
(b) If ba = e and ac = e, then
b = be = b(ac) = (ba)c = ec = c.
Hence the element a′ in (1.1c) is uniquely determined by a. We call it the inverse of a, and
denote it a−1 (or the negative of a, and denote it −a).
(c) Note that (1.1a) allows us to write a1a2a3 without bothering to insert parentheses.
The same is true for any ﬁnite sequence of elements of G. For deﬁniteness, deﬁne
a1a2 · · · an = (· · · ((a1a2)a3)a4 · · · ).
Then an induction argument shows that the value is the same, no matter how the parentheses
are inserted. (See Dummit p20.) Thus, for any ﬁnite ordered set S of elements in G, 
a∈S a
is deﬁned. For the empty set S, we set it equal to 1.
(d) The inverse of a1a2 · · · an is a−1
n a−1
n−1 · · · a−1
1 .
(e) Axiom (1.1c) implies that cancellation holds in groups:
ab = ac =⇒b = c,
ba = ca =⇒b = c
(multiply on left or right by a−1). Conversely, if G is ﬁnite, then the cancellation laws imply
Axiom (c): the map x →ax : G →G is injective, and hence (by counting) bijective; in
particular, 1 is in the image, and so a has a right inverse; similarly, it has a left inverse, and
we noted in (b) above that the two inverses must then be equal.
The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. A ﬁnite group whose order
is a power of a prime p is called a p-group.1
1Throughout the course, p will always be a prime number.

The usual rules hold:
aman = am+n,
(am)n = amn.
(1.1)
It follows from (1.1) that the set
{n ∈Z | an = 1}
is an ideal in Z. Therefore, this set equals (m) for some m ≥0. If m = 0, then a is said to
have inﬁnite order, and an ̸= 1 unless n = 0. Otherwise, a is said to have ﬁnite order m,
and m is the smallest positive integer such that am = 1. In this case, an = 1 ⇐⇒m|n;
moreover a−1 = am−1.
Example 1.3. (a) For each m = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , ∞there is a cyclic group of order m, Cm.
When m < ∞, then there is an element a ∈G such that
G = {1, a, . . . , am−1},
and G can be thought of as the group of rotations of a regular polygon with n-sides. If
m = ∞, then there is an element a ∈G such that
G = {am | m ∈Z}.
In both cases Cm ≈Z/mZ, and a is called a generator of Cm.
(b) Probably the most important groups are matrix groups.
For example, let R be a
commutative ring2. If X is an n × n matrix with coeﬃcients in R whose determinant is
a unit in R, then the cofactor formula for the inverse of a matrix (Dummit p365) shows
that X−1 also has coeﬃcients3 in R. In more detail, if X′ is the transpose of the matrix of
cofactors of X, then X · X′ = det X · I, and so (det X)−1X′ is the inverse of X. It follows
that the set GLn(R) of such matrices is a group. For example GLn(Z) is the group of all
n × n matrices with integer coeﬃcients and determinant ±1.
(c) If G and H are groups, then we can construct a new group G × H, called the product
of G and H. As a set, it is the Cartesian product of G and H, and multiplication is deﬁned
by:
(g, h)(g′, h′) = (gg′, hh′).
(d) A group is commutative (or abelian) if
ab = ba,
all a, b ∈G.
Recall from Math 593 the following classiﬁcation of ﬁnite abelian groups. Every ﬁnite abelian
group is a product of cyclic groups. If gcd(m, n) = 1, then Cm × Cn contains an element of
order mn, and so Cm × Cn ≈Cmn, and isomorphisms of this type give the only ambiguities
in the decomposition of a group into a product of cyclic groups.
From this one ﬁnds that every ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to exactly one group of
the following form:
Cn1 × · · · × Cnr,
n1|n2, . . . , nr−1|nr.
2This means, in particular, that R has an identity element 1. Homomorphisms of rings are required to
take 1 to 1.
3This also follows from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

GROUP THEORY

The order of this group is n1 · · · nr.
Alternatively, every abelian group of ﬁnite order m is a product of p-groups, where p
ranges over the primes dividing m,
G ≈

p|m
Gp.
For each partition
n = n1 + · · · + ns,
ni ≥1,
of n, there is a group  Cpni of order pn, and every group of order pn is isomorphic to exactly
one group of this form.
(e) Permutation groups. Let S be a set and let G the set Sym(S) of bijections α : S →S.
Then G becomes a group with the composition law αβ = α◦β. For example, the permutation
group on n letters is Sn = Sym({1, ..., n}), which has order n!. The symbol
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2 5 7 4 3 1 6

denotes the permutation sending 1 →2, 2 →5, 3 →7, etc..
1.2. Subgroups.
Proposition 1.4. Let G be a group and let S be a nonempty subset of G such that
(a) a, b ∈S =⇒ab ∈S.
(b) a ∈S =⇒a−1 ∈S.
Then the law of composition on G makes S into a group.
Proof. Condition (a) implies that the law of composition on G does deﬁne a law of compo-
sition S × S →S on S. By assumption S contains at least one element a, its inverse a−1,
and the product e = aa−1. Finally (b) shows that inverses exist in S.
A subset S as in the proposition is called a subgroup of G.
If S is ﬁnite, then condition (a) implies (b): for any a ∈S, the map x →ax : S →S is
injective, and hence (by counting) bijective; in particular, 1 is in the image, and this implies
that a−1 ∈S. The example N ⊂Z (additive groups) shows that (a) does not imply (b) when
G is inﬁnite.
Proposition 1.5. An intersection of subgroups of G is a subgroup of G.
Proof. It is nonempty because it contains 1, and conditions (a) and (b) of the deﬁnition are
obvious.
Remark 1.6. It is generally true that an intersection of sub-algebraic-objects is a subobject.
For example, an intersection of subrings is a subring, an intersection of submodules is a
submodule, and so on.
Proposition 1.7. For any subset X of a group G, there is a smallest subgroup of G con-
taining X. It consists of all ﬁnite products (allowing repetitions) of elements of X and their
inverses.
Proof. The intersection S of all subgroups of G containing X is again a subgroup containing
X, and it is evidently the smallest such group. Clearly S contains with X, all ﬁnite products
of elements of X and their inverses. But the set of such products satisﬁes (a) and (b) of
(1.4) and hence is a subgroup containing X. It therefore equals S.

We write <X > for the subgroup S in the proposition, and call it the subgroup generated
by X. For example, < ∅>= {1}. If every element of G has ﬁnite order, for example, if G is
ﬁnite, then the set of all ﬁnite products of elements of X is already a group (recall that if
am = 1, then a−1 = am−1) and so equals < X >.
We say that X generates G if G =< X >, i.e., if every element of G can be written as a
ﬁnite product of elements from X and their inverses.
A group is cyclic if it is generated by one element, i.e., if G =< a >. If a has ﬁnite order
m, then
G = {1, a, a2, ..., am−1} ≈Z/mZ,
ai ↔i
mod m.
If a has inﬁnite order, then
G = {. . . , a−i, . . . , a−1, 1, a, . . . , ai, . . .} ≈Z,
ai ↔i.
Note that the order of an element a of a group is the order of the subgroup < a > it generates.
1.3. Groups of order < 16.
Example 1.8. (a) Dihedral group, Dn. This is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon
with n-sides. Let σ be the rotation through 2π/n, and let τ be a rotation about an axis of
symmetry. Then
σn = 1;
τ 2 = 1;
τστ −1 = σ−1
(or τσ = σn−1τ).
The group has order 2n; in fact
Dn = {1, σ, ..., σn−1, τ, ..., σn−1τ}.
(b) Quaternion group Q : Let a =
	
0
√−1
√−1
0

, b =
	
0
1
−1
0

. Then
a4 = 1,
a2 = b2,
bab−1 = a−1.
The subgroup of GL2(C) generated by a and b is
Q = {1, a, a2, a3, b, ab, a2b, a3b}.
The group Q can also be described as the subset {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} of the quaternion algebra.
(c) Recall that Sn is the permutation group on {1, 2, ..., n}. The alternating group is the
subgroup of even permutations (see later). It has order n!
2 .
Every group of order < 16 is isomorphic to exactly one on the following list:
1: C1.
2: C2.
3: C3.
4: C4,
C2 × C2 (Viergruppe; Klein 4-group).
5: C5.
6: C6,
S3 = D3. (S3 is the ﬁrst noncommutative group.)

16: (14 groups)
General rules: For each prime p, there is only one group (up to isomorphism), namely Cp,
and only two groups of order p2, namely, Cp × Cp and Cp2. (We’ll prove this later.) Roughly
speaking, the more high powers of primes divide n, the more groups of order n you expect.
In fact, if f(n) is the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order n, then
f(n) ≤n( 2
27+o(1))µ2
as µ →∞
where pµ is the highest prime power dividing n and o(1) →0 as µ →∞(see Pyber, Ann.
of Math., 137 (1993) 203–220).
1.4. Multiplication tables.
A ﬁnite group can be described by its multiplication table:
1
a
b
c
. . .
1
1
a
b
c
. . .
a
a
a2
ab
ac
. . .
b
b
ba
b2
bc
. . .
c
c
ca
cb
c2
. . .
...
...
...
...
...
Note that, because we have the cancellation laws in groups, each row (and each column) is
a permutation of the elements of the group. Multiplication tables give us an algorithm for
classifying all groups of a given ﬁnite order, namely, list all possible multiplication tables and
check the axioms, but it is not practical! There are n3 possible multiplication tables for a
group of order n, and so this quickly becomes unmanageable. Also checking the associativity
law from a multiplication table is very time consuming. Note how few groups there are! Of
123 possible multiplication tables for groups of order 12, only 5 actually give groups.
1.5. Homomorphisms.
Deﬁnition 1.9. A homomorphism from a group G to a second G′ is a map α : G →G′
such that α(ab) = α(a)α(b) for all a, b.
Note that an isomorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism.
Remark 1.10. Let α be a homomorphism. By induction, α(am) = α(a)m, m ≥1. Moreover
α(1) = α(1 × 1) = α(1)α(1), and so α(1) = 1 (see Remark (1.2a). Finally
aa−1 = 1 = a−1a =⇒α(a)α(a−1) = 1 = α(a)α(a)−1.
From this it follows that
α(am) = α(a)m
all m ∈Z.
We saw above that each row of the multiplication table of a group is a permutation of
the elements of the group. As Cayley pointed out, this allows one to realize the group as a
group of permutations.

Theorem 1.11 (Cayley’s theorem). There is a canonical injective homomorphism
α : G %→Sym(G).
Proof. For a ∈G, deﬁne aL : G →G to be the map x →ax (left multiplication by a). For
x ∈G,
(aL ◦bL)(x) = aL(bL(x)) = aL(bx) = abx = (ab)L(x),
and so (ab)L = aL ◦bL. In particular,
aL ◦(a−1)L = id = (a−1)L ◦aL
and so aL is a bijection, i.e., aL ∈Sym(G). We have shown that a →aL is a homomorphism,
and it is injective because of the cancellation law.
Corollary 1.12. A ﬁnite group of order n can be identiﬁed with a subgroup of Sn.
Proof. Number the elements of the group a1, . . . , an.
Unfortunately, when G has large order n, Sn is too large to be manageable. We shall see
presently that G can often be embedded in a permutation group of much smaller order than
n!.
1.6. Cosets.
Let H be a subgroup of G. A left coset of H in G is a set of the form aH =df {ah | h ∈H},
some ﬁxed a ∈G; a right coset is a set of the form Ha = {ha | h ∈H}, some ﬁxed a ∈G.
Example 1.13. Let G = R2, regarded as a group under addition, and let H be a subspace
(line through the origin). Then the cosets (left or right) of H are the lines parallel to H.
It is not diﬃcult to see that the condition “a and b are in the same left coset” is an
equivalence relation on G, and so the left cosets form a partition of G, but we need a more
precise result.
Proposition 1.14. (a) If C is a left coset of H, and a ∈C, then C = aH.
(b) Two left cosets are either disjoint or equal.
(c) aH = bH if and only if a−1b ∈H.
(d) Any two left cosets have the same number of elements.
Proof. (a) Because C is a left coset, C = bH some b ∈G. Because a ∈C, a = bh for some
h ∈H. Now b = ah−1 ∈aH, and for any other element c of C, c = bh′ = ah−1h′ ∈aH.
Conversely, if c ∈aH, then c = ah′ = bhh′ ∈bH.
(b) If C and C′ are not disjoint, then there is an element a ∈C ∩C′, and C = aH and
C′ = aH.
(c) We have aH = bH ⇐⇒b ∈aH ⇐⇒b = ah, for some h ∈H, i.e., ⇐⇒a−1b ∈H.
(d) The map (ba−1)L : ah →bh is a bijection aH →bH.
The index (G : H) of H in G is deﬁned to be the number of left cosets of H in G. In
particular, (G : 1) is the order of G. The lemma shows that G is a disjoint union of the
left cosets of H, and that each has the same number of elements. When G is ﬁnite, we can
conclude:

Theorem 1.15 (Lagrange). If G is ﬁnite, then (G : 1) = (G : H)(H : 1). In particular,
the order of H divides the order of G.
Corollary 1.16. If G has order m, then the order of every element g in G divides m.
Proof. Apply Lagrange’s theorem to H =< g >, recalling that (H : 1) = order(g).
Example 1.17. If G has order p, a prime, then every element of G has order 1 or p. But
only e has order 1, and so G is generated by any element g ̸= e. In particular, G is cyclic,
G ≈Cp. Hence, up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 1,000,000,007; in fact
there are only two groups of order 1,000,000,014,000,000,049.
Remark 1.18. (a) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of left cosets and
the set of right cosets, viz, aH ↔Ha−1. Hence (G : H) is also the number of right cosets of
H in G. But, in general, a left coset will not be a right coset (see below).
(b) Lagrange’s theorem has a partial converse: if a prime p divides m = (G : 1), then
G has an element of order p; if pn divides m, then G has a subgroup of order pn (Sylow
theorem). But note that C2 × C2 has order 4, but has no element of order 4, and A4 has
order 12, but it has no subgroup of order 6.
More generally, we have the following result (for G ﬁnite).
Proposition 1.19. If G ⊃H ⊃K with H and K subgroups of G, then
(G : K) = (G : H)(H : K).
Proof. Write G =  giH (disjoint union), and H =  hjK (disjoint union). On multiplying
the second equality by gi, we ﬁnd that giH =

j gihjK (disjoint union), and so G =
 gihjK
(disjoint union).
1.7. Normal subgroups.
If S and T are two subsets of G, then we write ST = {st | s ∈S,
t ∈T}.
A subgroup N of G is normal, written N ◁G, if gNg−1 = N for all g ∈G. An intersection
of normal subgroups of a group is normal.
Remark 1.20. To show N normal, it suﬃces to check that gNg−1 ⊂N for all g : for
gNg−1 ⊂N =⇒g−1gNg−1g ⊂g−1Ng (multiply left and right with g−1 and g)
Hence N ⊂g−1Ng for all g. On rewriting this with g−1 for g, we ﬁnd that N ⊂gNg−1 for
all g.
The next example shows however that there can exist an N and a g such that gNg−1 ⊂N,
gNg−1 ̸= N (famous exercise in Herstein).
Example 1.21. Let G = GL2(Q), and let H = {( 1 n
0 1 ) | n ∈Z}. Then H is a subgroup of
G; in fact it is isomorphic to Z. Let g = ( 5 0
0 1 ). Then
g

Hence gHg−1 ⊂H, but ̸= H.
Proposition 1.22. A subgroup N of G is normal if and only if each left coset of N in G is
also a right coset, in which case, gN = Ng for all g ∈G.

8
J.S. MILNE
Proof. =⇒: Multiply the equality gNg−1 = N on the right by g.
⇐= : If gN is a right coset, then it must be the right coset Ng—see (1.14a). Hence
gN = Ng, and so gNg−1 = N. This holds for all g.
Remark 1.23. In other words, in order for N to be normal, we must have that for all g ∈G
and n ∈N, there exists an n′ ∈N such that gn = n′g (equivalently, for all g ∈G and
n ∈N, there exists an n′ such that ng = gn′.) Thus, an element of G can be moved past an
element of N at the cost of replacing the element of N by a diﬀerent element.
Example 1.24. (a) Every subgroup of index two is normal. Indeed, let g ∈G, g /∈H. Then
G = H ∪gH (disjoint union). Hence gH is the complement of H in G. The same argument
shows that Hg is the complement of H in G. Hence gH = Hg.
(b) Consider the dihedral group Dn = {1, σ, . . . , σn−1, τ, . . . , σn−1τ}.
Then Cn =
{1, σ, . . . , σn−1} has index 2, and hence is normal, but for n ≥3 the subgroup {1, τ} is
not normal because στσ−1 = τσn−2 /∈{1, τ}.
(c) Every subgroup of a commutative group is normal (obviously), but the converse is
false: the quaternion group Q is not commutative, but every subgroup is normal.
A group G is said to be simple if it has no normal subgroups other than G and {1}. The
Sylow theorems (see later) show that such a group will have lots of subgroups (unless it is a
cyclic group of prime order)—they just won’t be normal.
Proposition 1.25. If H and N are subgroups of G and N (or H) is normal, then
HN =df {hn | h ∈H,
n ∈N}
is a subgroup of G. If H is also normal, then HN is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof. It is nonempty, and
(hn)(h′n′) 1.23
= hh′n′′n′ ∈HN,
and so it is closed under multiplication. Since
(hn)−1 = n−1h−1 1.23
= h−1n′ ∈HN
it is also closed under the formation of inverses.
1.8. Quotients.
The kernel of a homomorphism α : G →G′ is
Ker(α) = {g ∈G| α(g) = 1}.
Proposition 1.26. The kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.
Proof. If a ∈Ker(α), so that α(a) = 1, and g ∈G, then
α(gag−1) = α(g)α(a)α(g)−1 = α(g)α(g)−1 = 1.
Hence gag−1 ∈Ker α.
Proposition 1.27. Every normal subgroup occurs as the kernel of a homomorphism. More
precisely, if N is a normal subgroup of G, then there is a natural group structure on the set
of cosets of N in G (this is if and only if).

Proof. Write the cosets as left cosets, and deﬁne (aN)(bN) = (ab)N. We have to check (a)
that this is well-deﬁned, and (b) that it gives a group structure on the set of cosets. It will
then be obvious that the map g →gN is a homomorphism with kernel N.
Check (a). Suppose aN = a′N and bN = b′N; we have to show that abN = a′b′N. But
we are given that a = a′n and b = b′n′ with n, n′ ∈N. Hence ab = a′nb′n′. Because of (1.23)
there exists an n′′ ∈N such that nb′ = b′n′′. Hence ab = a′b′n′′n′ ∈a′b′N. Therefore abN
and a′b′N have a common element, and so must be equal.
The rest of the proof is straightforward: the set is nonempty; the associative law holds;
the coset N is an identity element; a−1N is an inverse of aN. (See Dummit p81.)
When N is a normal subgroup, we write G/N for the set of left (= right) cosets of N in
G, regarded as a group. It is called the quotient of G by N. The map a →aN : G →G/N
is a surjective homomorphism with kernel N. It has the following universal property: for
any homomorphism α : G →G′ such that α(N) = 1, there exists a unique homomorphism
G/N →G′ such that the following diagram commutes:

group of order m.

R (because it is a one-dimensional vector space over R).

2. Free Groups and Presentations
It is frequently useful to describe a group by giving a set of generators for the group and
a set of relations for the generators from which every other relation in the group can be
deduced. For example, Dn can be described as the group with generators σ, τ and relations
σn = 1,
τ 2 = 1,
τστσ = 1.
In this section, we make precise what this means. First we need to deﬁne the free group
on a set X of generators—this is a group generated by X and with no relations except for
those implied by the group axioms. Because inverses cause problems, we ﬁrst do this for
semigroups.
2.1. Free semigroups.
Recall that (for us) a semigroup is a set G with an associative law of composition having an
identity element 1. Let X = {a, b, c, . . .} be a (possibly inﬁnite) set of symbols. A word is
a ﬁnite sequence of symbols in which repetition is allowed. For example,
aa,
aabac,
b
are distinct words. Two words can be multiplied by juxtaposition, for example,
aaaa ∗aabac = aaaaaabac.
This deﬁnes on the set W of all words an associative law of composition. The empty sequence
is allowed, and we denote it by 1. (In the unfortunate case that the symbol 1 is already an
element of X, we denote it by a diﬀerent symbol.) Then 1 serves as an identity element. Write
SX for the set of words together with this law of composition. Then SX is a semigroup,
called the free semigroup on X.
When we identify an element a of X with the word a, X becomes a subset of SX and
generates it (i.e., no proper subsemigroup of SX containing X). Moreover, the map X →SX
has the following universal property: for any map (of sets) X →S from X to a semigroup
S, there exists a unique homomorphism4 SX →S making the following diagram commute:
X
→
SX
↘
↓
S.
In fact, the unique extension of α : X →S takes the values:
α(1) = 1S,
α(dba · · · ) = α(d)α(b)α(a) · · · .
2.2. Free groups.
We want to construct a group FX containing X and having the same universal property
as SX with “semigroup” replaced by “group”. Deﬁne X′ to be the set consisting of the
symbols in X and also one additional symbol, denoted a−1, for each a ∈X; thus
X′ = {a, a−1, b, b−1, . . .}.
4A homomorphism α : S →S′ of semigroups is a map such that α(ab) = α(a)α(b) for all a, b ∈S and
α(1) = 1, i.e., α preserves all ﬁnite products.

GROUP THEORY
11
Let W ′ be the set of words using symbols from X′.
This becomes a semigroup under
juxtaposition, but it is not a group because we can’t cancel out the obvious terms in words
of the following form:
· · · xx−1 · · · or · · · x−1x · · ·
A word is said to be reduced if it contains no pairs of the form xx−1 or x−1x. Starting with
a word w, we can perform a ﬁnite sequence of cancellations to arrive at a reduced word
(possibly empty), which will be called the reduced form of w. There may be many diﬀerent
ways of performing the cancellations, for example,
cabb−1a−1c−1ca →caa−1c−1ca →cc−1ca →ca
cabb−1a−1c−1ca →cabb−1a−1a →cabb−1 →ca.
Note that the middle a−1 is cancelled with diﬀerent a’s, and that diﬀerent terms survive in
the two cases. Nevertheless we ended up with the same answer, and the next result says
that this always happens.
Proposition 2.1. There is only one reduced form of a word.
Proof. We use induction on the length of the word w. If w is reduced, there is nothing
to prove. Otherwise a pair of the form xx−1 or x−1x occurs—assume the ﬁrst, since the
same argument works in both cases.
If we can show that every reduced form of w can
be obtained by ﬁrst cancelling xx−1, then the proposition will follow from the induction
hypothesis applied to the (shorter) word obtained by cancelling xx−1.
Observe that the reduced form w0 obtained by a sequence of cancellations in which xx−1
is cancelled at some point is uniquely determined, because the result will not be aﬀected if
xx−1 is cancelled ﬁrst.
Now consider a reduced form w0 obtained by a sequence in which no cancellation cancels
xx−1 directly. Since xx−1 does not remain in w0, at least one of x or x−1 must be cancelled
at some point. If the pair itself is not cancelled, then the ﬁrst cancellation involving the pair
must look like
· · · ̸ x−1̸ xx−1 · · · or · · · x ̸ x−1 ̸ x · · ·
where our original pair is underlined. But the word obtained after this cancellation is the
same as if our original pair were cancelled, and so we may cancel the original pair instead.
Thus we are back in the case proved above.
We say two words w, w′ are equivalent, denoted w ∼w′, if they have the same reduced
form. This is an equivalence relation (obviously).
Proposition 2.2. Products of equivalent words are equivalent, i.e.,
w ∼w′,
v ∼v′ =⇒wv ∼w′v′.
Proof. Let w0 and v0 be the reduced forms of w and of v. To obtain the reduced form of
wv, we can ﬁrst cancel as much as possible in w and v separately, to obtain w0v0 and then
continue cancelling. Thus the reduced form of wv is the reduced form of w0v0. A similar
statement holds for w′v′, but (by assumption) the reduced forms of w and v equal the reduced
forms of w′ and v′, and so we obtain the same result in the two cases.

12
J.S. MILNE
Let FX be the set of equivalence classes of words. The proposition shows that the law of
composition on W ′ induces a law of composition on FX, which obviously makes it into a
semigroup. It also has inverses, because
ab · · · gh · h−1g−1 · · · b−1a−1 ∼1.
Thus FX is a group, called the free group on X.
To review: the elements of FX are
represented by words in X′; two words represent the same element of FX if and only if they
have the same reduced forms; multiplication is deﬁned by juxtaposition; the empty word (or
aa−1 ...) represents 1; inverses are obtained in the obvious way.
When we identify a ∈X with the equivalence class of the (reduced) word a, then X
becomes identiﬁed with a subset of FX—clearly it generates X. The next proposition is
a precise expression of the fact that there are no relations among the elements of X when
regarded as elements of FX except those imposed by the group axioms.
Proposition 2.3. For any map (of sets) X →G from X to a group G, there exists a unique
homomorphism FX →G making the following diagram commute:
X
→
FX
↘
↓
G.
Proof. Consider a map α : X →G. We extend it to a map of sets X′ →G by setting
α(a−1) = α(a)−1. Because G is, in particular, a semigroup, α extends to a homomorphism
of semigroups SX′ →G.
This map will send equivalent words to the same element of
G, and so will factor through FX =df S(X)/∼. The resulting map FX →G is a group
homomorphism. It is unique because we know it on a set of generators for FX.
Remark 2.4. The universal property of the map ι : X →FX characterizes it: if ι′ : X →F ′
is a second map with the same property, then there is a unique isomorphism α : F →F ′
such that α(ιx) = ι′x for all x ∈X.
Corollary 2.5. Every group is the quotient of a free group.
Proof. Choose a set X of generators for G (e.g, X = G), and let F be the free group
generated by X. Then the inclusion X %→G extends to a homomorphism F →G, and the
image, being a subgroup containing X, must be G.
The free group on the set X = {a} is simply the inﬁnite cyclic group C∞generated by a,
but the free group on a set consisting of two elements is already very complicated. I now
discuss, without proof, some important results on free groups.
Theorem 2.6 (Nielsen-Schreier). 5 Subgroups of free groups are free.
The best proof uses topology, and in particular covering spaces—see Serre, Trees, Springer,
1980, or Rotman, Theorem 12.24.
5Nielsen (1921) proved this for ﬁnitely generated subgroups, and in fact gave an algorithm for deciding
whether a word lies in the subgroup; Schreier (1927) proved the general case.

GROUP THEORY
13
Two free groups FX and FY are isomorphic if and only if X and Y have the same number
of elements6. Thus we can deﬁne the rank of a free group G to be the number of elements in
(i.e., cardinality of) a free generating set, i.e., subset X ⊂G such that the homomorphism
FX →G given by (2.3) is an isomorphism. Let H be a ﬁnitely generated subgroup of a free
group F. Then there is an algorithm for constructing from any ﬁnite set of generators for H
a free ﬁnite set of generators. If F has rank n and (F : H) = i < ∞, then H is free of rank
ni −i + 1.
In particular, H may have rank greater than that of F. For proofs, see Rotman, Chapter
12, and Hall, The Theory of Groups, Chapter 7.
2.3. Generators and relations.
As we noted in §1.7, an intersection of normal subgroups is again a normal subgroup. There-
fore, just as for subgroups, we can deﬁne the normal subgroup generated by the a set S in
a group G to be the intersection of the normal subgroups containing S. Its description in
terms of S is a little complicated. Call a subset S of a group G normal if gSg−1 ⊂S for all
g ∈G. Then it is easy to show:
(a) if S is normal, then the subgroup <S> generated7 by it is normal;
(b) for S ⊂G, 
g∈G gSg−1 is normal, and it is the smallest normal set containing S.
From these observations, it follows that:
Lemma 2.7. The normal subgroup generated by S ⊂G is <
g∈G gSg−1>.
Consider a set X and a set R of words made up of symbols in X′.
Each element of
R represents an element of the free group FX, and the quotient G of FX by the normal
subgroup generated by R is said to have X as generators and R as relations. One also says
that (X, R) is a presentation for G, G =<X|R >, and that R is a set of deﬁning relations
for G.
Example 2.8. (a) The dihedral group Dn has generators σ, τ and deﬁning relations
σn, τ 2, τστσ. (See below for a proof.)
(b) The generalized quaternion group Qn, n ≥3, has generators a, b and relations8 a2n−1 =
1, a2n−2 = b2, bab−1 = a−1. For n = 3 this is the group Q of (1.8b). In general, it has order
2n (for more on it, see Ex. 8).
(c) Two elements a and b in a group commute if and only if their commutator [a, b] =df
aba−1b−1 is 1. The free abelian group on generators a1, . . . , an has generators a1, a2, . . . , an
and relations
[ai, aj],
i ̸= j.
(d) The fundamental group of the open disk with one point removed is the free group on
σ, a loop around the point. (See Math 591.)
(e) The fundamental group of the sphere with r points removed has generators σ1, ..., σr
(σi is a loop around the ith point) and a single relation
σ1 · · · σr = 1.
6By which I mean that there is a bijection from one to the other.
7Use that conjugation by g, x →gxg−1, is a homomorphism G →G.
8Strictly speaking, I should say the relations a2n−1, a2n−2b−2, bab−1a.

u1, v1, ..., ug, vg and a single relation

See Massey, Algebraic Topology:An Introduction, which contains a good account of the in-
terplay between group theory and topology. For example, for many types of spaces, there is
an algorithm for obtaining a presentation for the fundamental group.
Proposition 2.9. Let G be the group deﬁned by the presentation {X, R}. For any map (of
sets) X →H from X to a group H each element of R to 1 (in an obvious sense), there
exists a unique homomorphism G →H making the following diagram commute:
X
→
G
↘
↓
H.
Proof. Let α be a map X →H. From the universal property of free groups (2.3), we know
that α extends to a homomorphism FX →H, which we again denote α. By assumption
R ⊂Ker(α), and therefore the normal subgroup N generated by R is contained in Ker(α).
Hence (see p9), α factors through FX/N = G. The uniqueness follows from the fact that
we know the map on a set of generators for X.
Example 2.10. Let G =<a, b|an, b2, baba>. We prove that G is isomorphic to Dn. Because
the elements σ, τ ∈Dn satisfy these relations, the map {a, b} →Dn,
a →σ,
b →τ
extends uniquely to a homomorphism G →Dn. This homomorphism is surjective because
σ and τ generate Dn. The relations an = 1,
b2 = 1,
ba = an−1b ensure that each element
of G is represented by one of the following elements, 1, . . . , an−1, b, ab, . . . , an−1b, and so
(G : 1) ≤2n = (Dn : 1). Therefore the homomorphism is bijective (and these symbols
represent distinct elements of G).
2.4. Finitely presented groups.
A group is said to be ﬁnitely presented if it admits a presentation (X, R) with both X and
R ﬁnite.
Example 2.11. Consider a ﬁnite group G. Let X = G, and let R be the set of words
{abc−1 | ab = c in G}.
I claim that (X, R) is a presentation of G, and so G is ﬁnitely presented.
Let G′ =<
X|R>. The map FX →G, a →a, sends the elements of R to 1, and therefore deﬁnes a
homomophism G′ →G, which is obviously surjective. But note that every element of G′ is
represented by an element of X, and so the map is an bijective.
Although it is easy to deﬁne a group by a ﬁnite presentation, calculating the properties
of the group can be very diﬃcult—note that we are deﬁning the group, which may be quite
small, as the quotient of a huge free group by a huge subgroup. I list some negative results.

GROUP THEORY
15
The word problem. Let G be the group deﬁned by a ﬁnite presentation (X, R). The word
problem for G asks whether there is an algorithm (decision procedure) for deciding whether
a word on X′ represents 1 in G. Unfortunately, the answer is negative: Novikov and Boone
showed that there exist ﬁnitely presented groups G for which there is no such algorithm. Of
course, there do exist other groups for which there is an algorithm.
The same ideas lead to the following result: there does not exist an algorithm that will
determine for an arbitary ﬁnite presentation whether or not the corresponding group is
trivial, ﬁnite, abelian, solvable, nilpotent, simple, torsion, torsion-free, free, or has a solvable
word problem.
See Rotman, Chapter 13, for proofs of these statements.
The Burnside problem. A group is said to have exponent m if gm = 1 for all g ∈G. It is easy
to write down examples of inﬁnite groups generated by a ﬁnite number of elements of ﬁnite
order (see Exercise 2), but does there exist an inﬁnite ﬁnitely-generated group with a ﬁnite
exponent? (Burnside problem). In 1970, Adjan, Novikov, and Britton showed the answer is
yes: there do exist inﬁnite ﬁnitely-generated groups of ﬁnite exponent.
Todd-Coxeter algorithm. There are some quite innocuous looking ﬁnite presentations that are
known to deﬁne quite small groups, but for which this is very diﬃcult to prove. The standard
approach to these questions is to use the Todd-Coxeter algorithm (M. Artin, Algebra, p223).
In the remainder of this course, including the exercises, we’ll develop various methods for
recognizing groups from their presentations.

3. Isomorphism Theorems; Extensions.
3.1. Theorems concerning homomorphisms.
The next three theorems (or special cases of them) are often called the ﬁrst, second, and
third isomorphism theorems respectively.
Factorization of homomorphisms. Recall that, for a homomorphism α : G →G′, the kernel
of α is {g ∈G | α(g) = 1} and the image of α is α(G) = {α(g) | g ∈G}.
Theorem 3.1 (fundamental theorem of group homomorphisms). For
any
homo-
morphism α : G →G′ of groups, the kernel N of α is a normal subgroup of G, the image I
of α is a subgroup of G′, and α factors in a natural way into the composite of a surjection,
an isomorphism, and an injection:
G
α→
G′
↓onto
↑inj.
G/N
≈→
I
Proof. We have already seen (1.26) that the kernel is a normal subgroup of G. If b = α(a)
and b′ = α(a′), then bb′ = α(aa′) and b−1 = α(a−1), and so I =df α(G) is a subgroup of G′.
For n ∈N, α(gn) = α(g)α(n) = α(g), and so α is constant on each left coset gN of N in G.
It therefore deﬁnes a map
¯α : G/N →I,
¯α(gN) = α(g),
which is obviously a homomorphism, and, in fact, obviously an isomorphism.
The isomorphism theorem.
Theorem 3.2 (Isomorphism Theorem). Let H be a subgroup of G and N a normal sub-
group of G. Then HN is a subgroup of G, H ∩N is a normal subgroup of H, and the
map
h(H ∩N) →hN : H/H ∩N →HN/N
is an isomorphism.
Proof. We have already shown (1.25) that HN is a subgroup. Consider the map
H →G/N,
h →hN.
This is a homomorphism, and its kernel is H ∩N, which is therefore normal in H. According
to Theorem 3.1, it induces an isomorphism H/H ∩N →I where I is its image. But I is the
set of cosets of the form hN, i.e., I = HN/N.
The correspondence theorem. The next theorem shows that if ¯G is a quotient group of G,
then the lattice of subgroups in ¯G captures the structure of the lattice of subgroups of G
lying over the kernel of G →¯G. [[Picture.]]
Theorem 3.3 (Correspondence Theorem). Let π : G ↠¯G be a surjective homomor-
phism, and let N = Ker(α). Then there is a one-to-one correspondence
{subgroups of G containing N}
1:1
↔{subgroups of ¯G}

GROUP THEORY
17
under which H ⊂G corresponds to ¯H = α(H) and ¯H ⊂¯G corresponds to H = α−1( ¯H).
Moreover, if H ↔¯H, then
(a) ¯H ⊂¯H′ ⇐⇒H ⊂H′, in which case ( ¯H′ : ¯H) = (H′ : H);
(b) ¯H is normal in ¯G if and only if H is normal in G, in which case, α induces an
isomorphism
G/H →¯G/ ¯H.
Proof. For any subgroup ¯H of ¯G, α−1( ¯H) is a subgroup of G containing N, and for any
subgroup H of G, α(H) is a subgroup of ¯G. One veriﬁes easily that α−1α(H) = H if and
only if H ⊃N, and that αα−1( ¯H) = ¯H. Therefore, the two operations give the required
bijection. The remaining statements are easily veriﬁed.
Corollary 3.4. Let N be a normal subgroup of G; then there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the subgroups of G containing N and the subgroups of G/N, H ↔H/N. Moreover
H is normal in G if and only if H/N is normal in G/N, in which case the homomorphism
g →gN : G →G/N induces an isomorphism
G/H
≈
−→(G/N)/(H/N).
Proof. Special case of the theorem in which π is taken to be g →gN : G →G/N.
3.2. Products. The next two propositions give criteria for a group to be a product of two
subgroups.
Proposition 3.5. Consider subgroups H1 and H2 of a group G. The map (h1, h2) →h1h2 :
H1 × H2 →G is an isomorphism of groups if and only if
(a) G = H1H2,
(b) H1 ∩H2 = {1}, and
(c) every element of H1 commutes with every element of H2.
Proof. The conditions are obviously necessary (if g ∈H1∩H2, then (g, g−1) →1). Conversely,
(c) implies that the map (h1, h2) →h1h2 is a homomorphism, and (b) implies that it is
injective:
h1h2 = 1 =⇒h1 = h−1
2
∈H1 ∩H2 = {1}.
Finally, (a) implies that it is surjective.
Proposition 3.6. Consider subgroups H1 and H2 of a group G. The map (h1, h2) →h1h2 :
H1 × H2 →G is an isomorphism of groups if and only if
(a) H1H2 = G,
(b) H1 ∩H2 = {1}, and
(c) H1 and H2 are both normal in G.

18
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Again, the conditions are obviously necessary. In order to show that they are suﬃ-
cient, we check that they imply the conditions of the previous proposition. For this we only
have to show that each element h1 of H1 commutes with each element h2 of H2. But the
commutator [h1, h2] = h1h2h−1
1 h−1
2
= (h1h2h−1
1 ) · h−1
2
is in H2 because H2 is normal, and
it’s in H1 because H1 is normal, and so (b) implies that it is 1. But [h1, h2] = 1 implies
h1h2 = h2h1.
Proposition 3.7. Consider subgroups H1, H2, . . . , Hk of a group G. The map
(h1, h2, . . . , hk) →h1h2 · · · hk : H1 × H2 × · · · × Hk →G
is an isomorphism of groups if (and only if)
(a) each of H1, H2, . . . , Hk is normal in G,
(b) for each j, Hj ∩(H1 · · · Hj−1Hj · · · Hk) = {1}, and
(c) G = H1H2 · · · Hk.
Proof. For k = 2, this is becomes the preceding proposition. We proceed by induction. This
allows us to assume that
(h1, h2, . . . , hk−1) →h1h2 · · · hk−1 : H1 × H2 × · · · × Hk−1 →H1H2 · · · Hk−1
is an isomorphism. An induction argument using (1.25) shows that H1 · · · Hk−1 is normal in
G, and so the pair H1 · · · Hk−1, Hk satisﬁes the hypotheses of (3.6). Hence
(h, hk) →hhk : (H1 · · · Hk−1) × Hk →G
is an isomorphism. These isomorphisms can be combined to give the required isomorphism:
H1 × · · · × Hk−1 × Hk
(h1,... ,hk)→(h1···hk−1,hk)
−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→H1 · · · Hk−1 × Hk
(h,hk)→hhk
−−−−−−→G.
Remark 3.8. When
(h1, h2, ..., hk) →h1h2 · · · hk : H1 × H2 × · · · × Hk →G
is an isomorphism we say that G is the direct product of its subgroups Hi. In more down-
to-earth terms, this means: each element g of G can be written uniquely in the form g =
h1h2 · · · hk, hi ∈Hi; if g = h1h2 · · · hk and g′ = h′
1h′
2 · · · h′
k, then
gg′ = (h1h′
1)(h2h′
2) · · · (hkh′
k).
3.3. Automorphisms of groups.
Let G be a group.
An isomorphism G →G is called an automorphism of G.
The set
Aut(G) of such automorphisms becomes a group under composition: the composite of two
automorphisms is again an automorphism; composition of maps is always associative; the
identity map g →g is an identity element; an automorphism is a bijection, and therefore
has an inverse, which is again an automorphism.
For g ∈G, the map ig “conjugation by g”,
x →gxg−1 : G →G
is an automorphism: it is a homomorphism because
g(xy)g−1 = (gxg−1)(gyg−1),
i.e.,
ig(xy) = ig(x)ig(y),

GROUP THEORY
19
and it is bijective because conjugation by g−1 is an inverse. An automorphism of this form
is called an inner automorphism, and the remaining automorphisms are said to be outer.
Note that
(gh)x(gh)−1 = g(hxh−1)g−1, i.e., igh(x) = ig ◦ih(x),
and so the map g →ig : G →Aut(G) is a homomorphism. Its image is written Inn(G). Its
kernel is the centre of G,
Z(G) =df {g ∈G | gx = xg all x ∈G},
and so we obtain from (3.1) an isomorphism G/Z(G) →Inn(G). In fact, Inn(G) is a normal
subgroup of Aut(G): for g ∈G and α ∈Aut(G),
(α ◦ig ◦α−1)(x) = α(g · α−1(x) · g−1) = α(g) · x · α(g)−1,
and so αigα−1 = iα(g).
A group G is said to be complete if the map g →ig : G →Aut(G) is an isomorphism.
Note that this equivalent to the condition:
(a) the centre Z(G) of G is trivial, and
(b) every automorphism of G is inner.
Example 3.9. (a) For n ̸= 2, 6, Sn is complete.
The group S2 is commutative, hence
Z(S2) ̸= 1, and for S6, Aut(S6)/ Inn(S6) ≈C2. See Rotman 7.4, 7.8.
(b) Let9 G = Fn
p. The automorphisms of G as an abelian group are just the automorphisms
of G as a vector space over Fp; thus Aut(G) = GLn(Fp). Because G is commutative, all
automorphisms of G are outer (apart from the identity automorphism).
(c) As a particular case of (b), we see that
Aut(C2 × C2) = GL2(F2) ≈S3.
Hence the nonisomorphic groups C2 × C2 and S3 have isomorphic automorphism groups.
(d) Let G be a cyclic group of order n, say G =<g0>. An automorphism α of G must
send g0 to another generator of G. But gm
0 has order
n
gcd(m,n), and so the generators of G
are the elements gm
0 with gcd(m, n) = 1. Thus α(g0) = gm
0 for some m relatively prime to n,
and in fact the map α →m deﬁnes an isomorphism
Aut(Cn) →(Z/nZ)×
where
(Z/nZ)× = {units in the ring Z/nZ} = {m + nZ | gcd(m, n) = 1}.
This isomorphism is independent of the choice of a generator g0 for G; in fact, if α(g0) = gm
0 ,
then for any other element g = gi
0 of G,
α(g) = α(gi
0) = α(g0)i = gmi
0
= (gi
0)m = gm.
(e) Since the centre of the quaternion group Q is <a2>, we have that
Inn(Q) = Q/ <a2>≈C2 × C2.
In fact, Aut(Q) ≈S4. See Exercises.
(f) If G is a simple nonabelian group, then Aut(G) is complete. See Rotman 7.9.
9We use the standard (Bourbaki) notations: N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, Z = ring of integers, R = ﬁeld of real
numbers, C = ﬁeld of complex numbers, Fp = Z/pZ = ﬁeld of p-elements, p prime.

If n =

1 · · · prs
s is the factorization of n into powers of distinct primes, then the Chinese Remainder

which induces an isomorphism

Hence we need only consider the case n = pr, p prime.
Suppose ﬁrst that p is odd. The set {0, 1, . . . , pr −1} is a complete set of representatives
for Z/prZ, and 1
p of these elements is divisible by p. Hence (Z/prZ)× has order pr −pr
p =
pr−1(p−1). Because p−1 and pr are relatively prime, we know from Math 593 that (Z/prZ)×
is isomorphic to the product of a group A of order p −1 and a group B of order pr−1. The
map
(Z/prZ)× ↠(Z/pZ)× = F×
p ,
induces an isomorphism A →F×
p , and F×
p , being a ﬁnite subgroup of the multiplicative group
of a ﬁeld, is cyclic (see the second part of the course). Thus (Z/prZ)× ⊃A =<ζ> for some
element ζ of order p −1. Using the binomial theorem, one ﬁnds that 1 + p has order pr−1 in
(Z/prZ)×, and therefore generates B. Thus (Z/prZ)× is cyclic, with generator ζ(1 + p), and
every element can be written uniquely in the form
ζi(1 + p)j,
0 ≤i < p −1,
0 ≤j < pr−1.
On the other hand,
(Z/8Z)× = {¯1, ¯3, ¯5, ¯7} =<¯3, ¯5>≈C2 × C2
is not cyclic. The situation can be summarized by:

Deﬁnition 3.11. A subgroup H of a group G is called a characteristic subgroup if α(H) = H
for all automorphisms α of G.
As for normal subgroups, it suﬃces to check that α(H) ⊂H for all α ∈Aut(G).
Contrast: a subgroup H of G is normal if it is stable under all inner automorphisms of G;
it is characteristic if it stable under all automorphisms.
Remark 3.12. (a) Consider groups G ▷H. An inner automorphism restricts to an auto-
morphism of H, which may be an outer automorphism of H. Thus a normal subgroup of
H need not be a normal subgroup of G. However, a characteristic subgroup of H will be
a normal subgroup of G. Also a characteristic subgroup of a characteristic subgroup is a
characteristic subgroup.
(b) The centre Z(G) of G is a characteristic subgroup, because
zg = gz all g ∈G =⇒α(z)α(g) = α(g)α(z) all g ∈G,
and as g runs over G, α(g) also runs over G. In general, expect subgroups with a general
group-theoretic deﬁnition to be characteristic.

GROUP THEORY
21
(c) If H is the only subgroup of G of order m, then it must be characteristic, because
α(H) is again a subgroup of G of order m.
(d) Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, but such a subgroup need not be
characteristic. For example, a subspace of dimension 1 in G = F2
p will not be stable under
GL2(Fp) and hence is not a characteristic subgroup.
3.4. Semidirect products. Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Each element g of G deﬁnes
an automorphism of N, n →gng−1, and so we have a homomorphism
θ : G →Aut(N).
If there exists a subgroup Q of G such that the map G →G/N maps Q isomorphically onto
G/N, then I claim that we can reconstruct G from the triple (N, Q, θ|Q). Indeed, for any
g ∈G, there exist unique elements n ∈N, q ∈Q, such that g = nq (q is the element of Q
representing g in G/N, and n = gq−1), and so we have a one-to-one correspondence (of sets)
G
1−1
↔N × H.
If g = nq and g′ = n′q′, then
gg′ = nqn′q′ = n(qn′q−1)qq′ = n · θ(q)(n′) · qq′.
Deﬁnition 3.13. A group G is said to be a semidirect product of the subgroups N and Q,
written N ⋊Q, if N is normal and G →G/N induces an isomorphism Q ≈→G/N. Equivalent
condition: N and Q are subgroups of G such that
(i) N ◁G; (ii) NQ = G; (iii) N ∩Q = {1}.
Note that Q need not be a normal subgroup of G.
Example 3.14. (a) In Dn, let Cn =<σ> and C2 =<τ>; then
Dn =<σ> ⋊<τ>= Cn ⋊C2.
(b) The alternating subgroup An is a normal subgroup of Sn (because it has index 2), and
Q = {(12)} ≈→Sn/An. Therefore Sn = An ⋊C2.
(c) The quaternion group is not a semidirect product. (See the exercises.)
(d) A cyclic group of order p2, p prime, is not a semidirect product.
We have seen that, from a semidirect product G = N ⋊Q, we obtain a triple
(N, Q, θ : Q →Aut(N)).
We now prove that all triples (N, Q, θ) consisting of two groups N and Q and a homomor-
phism θ : Q →Aut(N) arise from semidirect products. As a set, let G = N × Q, and
deﬁne
(n, q)(n′, q′) = (n · θ(q)(n′), qq′).
Proposition 3.15. The above composition law makes G into a group, in fact, the semidirect
product of N and Q.

22
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Write qn for θ(q)(n). First note that
((n, q), (n′, q′))(n′′, q′′) = (n · qn′ · qq′n′′, qq′q′′) = (n, q)((n′, q′)(n′′, q′′))
and so the product is associative. Clearly
(1, 1)(n, q) = (n, q) = (n, q)(1, 1)
and so (1, 1) is an identity element. Next
(n, q)(q−1n, q−1) = (1, 1) = (q−1n, q−1)(n, q),
and so (q−1n, q−1) is an inverse for (n, q). Thus G is a group, and it easy to check that it
satisﬁes the conditions (i,ii,iii) of (3.13).
Write G = N ⋊θ Q for the above group.
Example 3.16. (a) Let θ be the (unique) nontrivial homomorphism C4 →C2 = Aut(C3),
namely, that which sends a generator of C4 to the map x →x2. Then G =df C3 ⋊θ C4 is a
noncommutative group of order 12, not isomorphic to A4. If we denote the generators of C3
and C4 by a and b, then a and b generate G, and have the deﬁning relations
a3 = 1,
b4 = 1,
bab−1 = a2.
(b) Let N and Q be any two groups, and let θ be the trivial homomorphism Q →N, i.e.,
θ(q) = 1 for all q ∈Q. Then
N ⋊θ Q = N × Q
(direct product).
(c) Both S3 and C6 are semidirect products of C3 by C2—they correspond to the two
homomorphisms C2 →C2 = Aut(C3).
(d) Let N =<a, b> be the product of two cyclic groups of order p with generators a =
1
0

and b =
0
1

, and let Q be cyclic of order p with generator c. Deﬁne
θ : Q →Aut N,
ci →

.
The group G =df N ⋊θ Q is a group of order p3, with generators a, b, c and deﬁning relations
ap = bp = cp = 1,
ab = cac−1,
[b, a] = 1 = [b, c].
Because b ̸= a, the group is noncommutative. When p is odd, all elements except 1 have
order p. When p = 2, G = D4. Note that this shows that a group can have quite diﬀerent
representations as a semidirect product:
D4 = C4 ⋊C2 = (C2 × C2) ⋊C2.
(e) Let N =<a> be cyclic of order p2, and let Q =<b> be cyclic of order p, where p is
an odd prime. Then Aut N ≈Cp−1 × Cp, and the generator of Cp is α where α(a) = a1+p
(hence α2(a) = a1+2p, . . . ). Deﬁne Q →Aut N by b →α. The group G =df N ⋊θ Q has
generators a, b and deﬁning relations
ap2 = 1,
bp = 1,
bab−1 = a1+p.
It is a nonabelian group of order p3, and possesses an element of order p2.

GROUP THEORY
23
For any odd prime p, the groups constructed in (d) and (e) are the only nonabelian groups
of order p3. (See later.)
(f) Let α be an automorphism of a group N. We can realize N as a normal subgroup of
a group G in such a way that α becomes an inner automorphism α = ig|N, g ∈G, in the
bigger group. To see this, let θ : C∞→Aut(N) be the homomorphism sending a generator
a of C∞to α ∈Aut(N), and let G = N ⋊θ C∞. Then the element g = (1, a) of G has the
property that g(n, 1)g−1 = (α(n), 1) for all n ∈N.
3.5. Extensions of groups.
A sequence of groups and homomorphisms
1 →N
ι→G
π→Q →1
is exact if ι is injective, π is surjective, and Ker(π) = Im(ι). Thus ι(N) is a normal subgroup
of G (isomorphic by ι to N) and G/ι(N)
≈→Q. We often identify N with the subgroup ι(N)
of G and Q with the quotient G/N.
An exact sequence as above is also referred to as an extension of Q by N. An extension is
central if ι(N) ⊂Z(G). For example,
1 →N →N ⋊θ Q →Q →1
is an extension of N by Q, which is central if (and only if) θ is the trivial homomorphism.
Two extensions of Q by N are isomorphic if there is a commutative diagram

An extension
1 →N
ι→G
π→Q →1
is said to be split if it isomorphic to a semidirect product. Equivalent conditions:
(a) there exists a subgroup Q′ ⊂G such that π induces an isomorphism Q′ →Q; or
(b) there exists a homomorphism s : Q →G such that π ◦s = id .
As we have seen (3.14c,d), in general an extension will not split. We list two criteria for
this to happen.
Proposition 3.17 (Schur-Zassenhaus lemma). An extension of ﬁnite groups of rela-
tively prime order is split.
Proof. Rotman 7.24.
Proposition 3.18. Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. If N is complete, then G is
the direct product of N with the centralizer
CG(N) =df {g ∈G | gn = ng all n ∈N}
of N in G.
Proof. Let Q = CG(N).
Observe ﬁrst that, for any g ∈G, n →gng−1 : N →N is
an automorphism of N, and (because N is complete), it must be the inner automorphism
deﬁned by an element γ = γ(g) of N; thus
gng−1 = γnγ−1
all n ∈N.

24
J.S. MILNE
This equation shows that γ−1g ∈Q, and hence g = γ(γ−1g) ∈NQ. Since g was arbitrary,
we have shown that G = NQ. Next note that any element of N ∩Q is in the centre of N,
which (by the completeness assumption) is trivial; hence N ∩Q = 1. Finally, for any element
g = nq ∈G,
gQg−1 = n(qQq−1)n−1 = nQn−1 = Q
(recall that every element of N commutes with every element of Q). Therefore Q is normal
in G, and we have proved that N and Q satisfy the conditions of Proposition 3.6 and so
N × Q ≈→G.
An extension gives rise to a homomorphism θ′ : G →Aut(N), namely, θ′(g)(n) = gng−1.
Let q ∈G map to q in Q; then the image of θ′(q) in Aut(N)/ Inn(N) depends on q; therefore
we get a homomorphism θ : Q →Out(N) =df Aut(N)/ Inn(N). This map θ depends only on
the isomorphism class of the extension, and we write Ext1(G, N)θ for the set of isomorphism
classes of extensions with a given θ. These sets have been extensively studied.
3.6. The H¨older program.
Recall that a group G is simple if it contains no normal subgroup except 1 and G. In other
words, a group is simple if it can’t be realized as an extension of smaller groups. Every ﬁnite
group can be obtained by taking repeated extensions of simple groups. Thus the simple
ﬁnite groups can be regarded as the basic building blocks for all ﬁnite groups.
The problem of classifying all simple groups falls into two parts:
A. Classify all ﬁnite simple groups;
B. Classify all extensions of ﬁnite groups.
Part A has been solved: there is a complete list of ﬁnite simple groups. They are the cyclic
groups of prime order, the alternating groups An for n ≥5 (see the next section), certain
inﬁnite families of matrix groups, and the 26 “sporadic groups”. As an example of a matrix
group, consider
SLn(Fq) =df {m × m matrices A with entries in Fq such that det A = 1}.
Here q = pn, p prime, and Fq is “the” ﬁeld with q elements (see the second part of the
course). This group is not simple, because the scalar matrices



ζ 0 ··· 0
0 ζ
0
...
0 0 ··· ζ


, ζm = 1, are in
the centre. But they are the only matrices in centre, and for q and m suﬃciently large (e.g.,
q > 3 when m = 2), the groups
PSLm(Fq) =df SLn(Fq)/{centre}
are simple.
There are many results on Part B, and at least one expert has told me he considers it
solved, but I’m sceptical.

4. Groups Acting on Sets
4.1. General deﬁnitions and results.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let X be a set and let G be a group. A left action of G on X is a mapping
(g, x) →gx : G × X →X such that
(a) 1x = x, for all x ∈X;
(b) (g1g2)x = g1(g2x), all g1, g2 ∈G, x ∈X.
The axioms imply that, for each g ∈G, left translation by g,
gL : X →X,
x →gx,
has (g−1)L as an inverse, and therefore gL is a bijection, i.e., gL ∈Sym(X). Axiom (b) now
says that
g →gL : G →Sym(X)
is a homomorphism.
Thus, from a left action of G on X, we obtain a homomorphism
G →Sym(G), and conversely, such a homomorphism deﬁnes an action of G on X.
Example 4.2. (a) The symmetric group Sn acts on {1, 2, ..., n}. Every subgroup H of Sn
acts on {1, 2, . . . , n}.
(b) Every subgroup H of a group G acts on G by left translation,
H × G →G,
(h, x) →hx.
(c) Let H be a subgroup of G. If C is a left coset of H in G, then so also is gC for any
g ∈G. In this way, we get an action of G on the set of left cosets:
G × G/H →G/H,
(g, C) →gC.
(e) Every group G acts on itself by conjugation:
G × G →G,
(g, x) →gx =df gxg−1.
For any normal subgroup N, G acts on N and G/N by conjugation.
(f) For any group G, Aut(G) acts on G.
A right action X × G →G is deﬁned similarly. To turn a right action into a left action,
set g ∗x = xg−1. For example, there is a natural right action of G on the set of right
cosets of a subgroup H in G, namely, (C, g) →Cg, which can be turned into a left action
(g, C) →Cg−1.
A morphism of G-sets (better G-map; G-equivariant map) is a map ϕ : X →Y such that
ϕ(gx) = gϕ(x),
all g ∈G,
x ∈X.
An isomorphism of G-sets is a bijective G-map; its inverse is then also a G-map.

26
J.S. MILNE
Orbits. Let G act on X. A subset S ⊂X is said to be stable under the action of G if
g ∈G,
x ∈S =⇒gx ∈S.
The action of G on X then induces an action of G on S.
Write x ∼G y if y = gx, some g ∈G. This relation is reﬂexive because x = 1x, symmetric
because
y = gx =⇒x = g−1y
(multiply by g−1 on the left and use the axioms), and transitive because
y = gx,
z = g′y =⇒z = g′(gx) = (g′g)x.
It is therefore an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called G-orbits. Thus the
G-orbits partition X. Write G\X for the set of orbits.
By deﬁnition, the G-orbit containing x0 is
Gx0 =df {gx0 | g ∈G}.
It is the smallest G-stable subset of X containing x0.
Example 4.3. (a) Suppose G acts on X, and let α ∈G be an element of order n. Then the
orbits of H =df<α> ∈Sn are the sets of the form
{x0, αx0, . . . , αn−1x0}.
(These elements need not be distinct, and so the set may contain fewer than n elements.)
(b) The orbits for a subgroup H of G acting on G by left multiplication are the right
cosets of H in G. We write H\G for the set of right cosets. Similarly, the orbits for H acting
by right multiplication are the left cosets, and we write G/H for the set of left cosets. Note
that the group law on G will not induce a group law on G/H unless H is normal.
(c) For a group G acting on itself by conjugation, the orbits are called conjugacy classes:
for x ∈G, the conjugacy class of x is the set {gxg−1 | g ∈G} of conjugates of x. The
conjugacy class of x0 consists only of x0 if and only if x0 is in the centre of G. In linear
algebra the conjugacy classes in G = GLn(k) are called similarity classes, and the theory of
(rational) Jordan canonical forms provides a set of representatives for the conjugacy classes:
two matrices are similar (conjugate) if and only if they have essentially the same Jordan
canonical form. (See Math 593.)
Note that the stable subsets of X are precisely the sets that can be written as a union of
orbits. For example, a subgroup H of G is normal if and only if it is a union of conjugacy
classes.
The group G is said to act transitively on X if there is only one orbit, i.e., for any two
elements x and y of X, there exists a g ∈G such that gx = y.
For example, Sn acts transitively on {1, 2, ...n}. For any subgroup H of a group G, G
acts transitively on G/H. But G (almost) never acts transitively on G (or G/N or N) by
conjugation.
The group G acts doubly transitive on X if for any two pairs (x, x′), (y, y′) of elements
of X, there exists a g ∈G such that gx = y, gx′ = y′. Similarly deﬁne k-fold transitivity,
k ≥3.

GROUP THEORY

Stabilizers. The stabilizer (or isotropy group) of an element x ∈X is
Stab(x) = {g ∈G|gx = x}.
It is a subgroup, but it need not be a normal subgroup. In fact:
Lemma 4.4. If y = gx, then Stab(y) = g · Stab(x) · g−1.
Proof. Certainly, if g′x = x, then
(gg′g−1)y = gg′x = gx = y.
Hence Stab(y) ⊃g · Stab(x) · g−1. Conversely, if g′y = y, then
(g−1g′g)x = g−1g′(y) = g−1y = x,
and so g−1g′g ∈Stab(x), i.e., g′ ∈g · Stab(x) · g−1.
Clearly

Stab(x) = Ker(G →Sym(X)),
which is a normal subgroup of G. If  Stab(x) = {1}, i.e., G %→Sym(X), then G is said to
act eﬀectively. It acts freely if Stab(x) = 1 for all x ∈X, i.e., if gx = x =⇒g = 1.
Example 4.5. (a) Let G act on G by conjugation. Then
Stab(x) = {g ∈G | gx = xg}.
This group is called the centralizer CG(x) of x in G. It consists of all elements of G that
commute with, i.e., centralize, x. The intersection

CG(x) = {g ∈G | gx = xg
∀x ∈G}
is a normal subgroup of G, called the centre of G. It consists of the elements of G that
commute with every element of G.
(b) Let G act on G/H by left multiplication. Then Stab(H) = H, and the stablizer of gH
is gHg−1.
Similarly, for a subset S of X, we deﬁne the stabilizer of S to be
Stab(S) = {g ∈G | gS ⊂S}.
The same argument as before shows that
Stab(gS) = g · Stab(S) · g−1.
Example 4.6. Let G act on G by conjugation, and let H be a subgroup of G. The stabilizer
of H is called the normalizer NG(H) of H in G:
NG(H) = {g ∈G | gHg−1 ⊂H}.
Clearly NG(H) is the largest subgroup of G containing H as a normal subgroup.

Transitive actions.
Proposition 4.7. Suppose G acts transitively on X, and let x0 ∈X; then
gH →gx0 : G/ Stab(x0) →X
is an isomorphism of G-sets.
Proof. It is well-deﬁned because if h, h′ ∈Stab(x0), then ghx0 = gx0 = gh′x0 for any g ∈G.
It is injective because
gx0 = g′x0 =⇒g−1g′x0 = x0 =⇒g, g′ lie in the same left coset of Stab(x0).
It is surjective because G acts transitively. Finally, it is obviously G-equivariant.
The isomorphism is not canonical: it depends on the choice of x0 ∈X. Thus to give a
transitive action of G on a set X is not the same as to give a subgroup of G.
Corollary 4.8. Let G act on X, and let O = Gx0 be the orbit containing x0. Then the
number of elements in O,
#O = (G : Stab(x0)).
Proof. The action of G on O is transitive, and so g →gx0 deﬁnes a bijection G/ Stab(x0) →
Gx0.
This equation is frequently useful for computing #O.
Proposition 4.9. If G acts transitively on X, then, for any x0 ∈X,
Ker(G →Sym(X))
is the largest normal subgroup contained in Stab(x0).
Proof. For any x0 ∈X, we know that Ker(G →Sym(X)) is

x∈X
Stab(x) =

g∈G
Stab(gx0) =

g · Stab(x0) · g−1.
Hence this is a consequence of the following lemma.
Lemma 4.10. For any subgroup H of a group G, 
g∈G gHg−1 is the largest normal subgroup
contained in H.
Proof. First note that N0 =df

g∈G gHg−1, being an intersection of subgroups, is itself a
subgroup. It is normal because
g1N0g−1
1
=

g∈G
(g1g)N0(g1g)−1 = N0
—for the second equality, we used that, as g runs over the elements of G, so also does g1g.
Thus N0 is a normal subgroup of G contained in 1H1−1 = H. If N is a second such group,
then
N = gNg−1 ⊂gHg−1
for all g ∈G, and so
N ⊂

gHg−1 = N0.

ment).
Theorem 4.13 (Cauchy). If the prime p divides (G : 1), then G contains an element of
order p.
Proof. We use induction on (G : 1). If for some y not in the centre of G, p does not divide
(G : CG(y)), then p|CG(y) and we can apply induction to ﬁnd an element of order p in CG(y).
Thus we may suppose that p divides all of the terms (G : CG(y)) in the class equation (second
form), and so also divides Z(G). But Z(G) is commutative, and it follows from the structure
theory of such groups (for example) that Z(G) will contain an element of order p.
p-groups.
Theorem 4.14. A ﬁnite p-group ̸= 1 has centre ̸= {1}.
Proof. By assumption, (G : 1) is a power of p, and it follows that (G : CG(y)) is power of
p (̸= p0) for all y in the above sum. Since every other term in the sum is divisible by p, so
also is (Z(G) : 1).
Corollary 4.15. A group of order pm has normal subgroups of order pn for all n ≤m.
Proof. We use induction on m. The centre of G contains an element g of order p, and so
N =<g> is a normal subgroup of G of order p. Now the induction hypothesis allows us
to assume the result for G/N, and the correspondence theorem (3.3) then gives it to us for
G.
Proposition 4.16. A group of order p2 is commutative, and hence is isomorphic to Cp ×Cp
or Cp2.
Proof. We know that the centre Z is nontrivial, and that G/Z therefore has order 1 or p. In
either case it is cyclic, and the next result implies that G is commutative.

Lemma 4.17. Suppose G contains a subgroup H in its centre (hence H is normal) such
that G/H is cyclic. Then G is commutative.
Proof. Let a ∈G be such that aH generates G/H, so that G/H = {(aH)i | i ∈Z}. Since
(aH)i = aiH, we see that every element of G can be written g = aih with h ∈H, i ∈Z.
Now
aih · ai′h′
= aiai′hh′
because H ⊂Z(G)
= ai′aih′h
= ai′h′ · aih.
Remark 4.18. The above proof shows that if H ⊂Z(G) and G contains a set of represen-
tatives for G/H whose elements commute, then G is commutative.
It is now not diﬃcult to show that any noncommutative group of order p3 is isomorphic
to one of the groups constructed in (3.16d,e) (see exercises). Thus, up to isomorphism, there
are exactly two noncommutative groups of order p3.
Action on the left cosets. The action of G on the set of left cosets G/H of H in G is a very
useful tool in the study of groups. We illustrate this with some examples.
Let X = G/H. Recall that, for any g ∈G,
Stab(gH) = g Stab(H)g−1 = gHg−1
and the kernel of
G →Sym(X)
is the largest normal subgroup 
g∈G gHg−1 of G contained in H.
Remark 4.19. (a) Let H be a subgroup of G not containing a normal subgroup of G other
than 1. Then G →Sym(G/H) will be injective, and we will have realized G as a subgroup
of a symmetric group of order much smaller than (G : 1)!. For example, if G is simple, then
the Sylow theorems imply that G has many proper subgroups H ̸= 1 (unless G is cyclic),
but (by deﬁnition) it has no such normal subgroup.
(b) If (G : 1) does not divide (G : H)!, then
G →Sym(G/H)
can’t be injective (Lagrange’s theorem), and we can conclude that H contains a normal
subgroup ̸= 1 of G. For example, if G has order 99, then it will have a subgroup of order 11
(Cauchy’s theorem), and the subgroup must be normal. In fact, G = N × Q.
Example 4.20. Let G be a group of order 6.
According to Cauchy’s theorem, G must
contain an element σ of order 3 and an element τ of order 2. Moreover N =df<σ> must be
normal because 6 ̸ |2! (or simply because it has index 2). Let H =<τ> .
Either (a) H is normal in G, or (b) H is not normal in G. In the ﬁrst case, στσ−1 = τ,
i.e., στ = τσ, and so (4.17) shows that G is commutative, G ≈C2 × C3. In the second
case, G →Sym(G/H) is injective, hence surjective, and so G ≈S3. We have succeeded in
classifying the groups of order 6.

GROUP THEORY

4.2. Permutation groups.
Consider Sym(X) where X has n elements. Since (up to isomorphism) a symmetry group
Sym(X) depends only on the number of elements in X, we may take X = {1, 2, . . . , n}, and
so work with10 Sn. Consider a permutation
α =
	
1
2
3
. . .
n
α(1)
α(2)
α(3)
. . .
α(n)

.
Then α is said to be even or odd according as the number of pairs (i, j) with i < j and
α(i) > α(j) is even or odd. The signature, sign(α), of α is +1 or −1 according as α is even
or odd. [Picture.]
For any polynomial F(X1, ..., Xn) and permutation α of {1, . . . , n}, deﬁne
(αF)(X1, ..., Xn) = F(Xα(1), ..., Xα(n)),
i.e., αF is obtained from F by replacing each Xi with Xα(i). Note that
(αβF)(X1, ..., Xn) = F(Xαβ(1), . . . ) = F(Xα(β(1)), . . .) = (α(βF))(X1, ..., Xn).
Let G(X1, ..., Xn) =

i<j(Xj −Xi). Then
(αG)(X1, ..., Xn) =

i<j
(Xα(j) −Xα(i)).
Hence αG = sign(α) · G. By deﬁnition αβG = sign(αβ)G, and
αβG = α(βG) = α(sign(β)G) = sign β(αG) = sign(α) sign(β)G.
Hence sign(αβ) = sign α sign β, and we have shown that “sign” is a homomorphism Sn →
{±1}. Its kernel is a normal subgroup of Sn of order n!
2 , called the alternating group An.
A cycle is a permutation of the following form
i1 →i2 →i3 →· · · →ir →i1,
remaining i’s ﬁxed.
We denote it by (i1i2...ir), and call r its length—note that r is also its order. A cycle of
length 2 is called a transposition. A cycle (i) of length 1 is the identity map. The support of
the cycle (i1 . . . ir) is the set {i1, . . . , ir}, and cycles are said to be disjoint if their supports
are disjoint. Note that disjoint cycles commute. If
α = (i1...ir)(j1...js) · · · (l1...lu)
(disjoint cycles),
then
αm = (i1...ir)m(j1...js)m · · · (l1...lu)m
(disjoint cycles),
and it follows that α has order lcm(r, s, ..., u).
Proposition 4.21. Every permutation can be written (essentially uniquely) as a product of
disjoint cycles.
10We of course, deﬁne multiplication in Sn to be composition; other authors (e.g., M. Artin) unaccountably
write things backwards.

32
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Let α ∈Sn, and let O ⊂{1, 2, . . . , n} be an orbit for < α >.
For any i ∈O,
O = {i, α(i), . . . , αr−1(i)}.
Therefore α and the cycle (i α(i) . . . αr−1(i)) have the same
action on any element of O. Let
{1, 2, . . . , n} =
m

j=1
Oj
be a the decomposition of {1, . . . , n} into a disjoint union of orbits for <α>, and let γj be
the cycle associated with Oj. Then
α = γ1 · · · γm
is a decomposition of α into a product of disjoint cycles. For the uniqueness, note that a
decomposition α = γ1 · · · γm into a product of disjoint cycles must correspond to a decompo-
sition of {1, ..., n} into orbits (ignoring cycles of length 1 and orbits with only one element).
We can drop cycles of length one, change the order of the cycles, and change how we write
each cycle, but that’s all because the orbits are intrinsically attached to α.
For example,

= (15)(276349)(8)
It has order lcm(2, 5) = 10.
Corollary 4.22. A permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; the number
of transpositions is even or odd according as α is even or odd.
Proof. The cycle
(i1i2...ir) = (i1i2) · · · (ir−2ir−1)(ir−1ir),
and so the ﬁrst statement follows from the proposition. Because sign is a homomorphism,
and the signature of a transposition is −1, sign(α) = (−1)#transpositions.
Note that the formula in the proof shows that the signature of a cycle of length r is
(−1)r−1, i.e., an r-cycle is even or odd according as r is odd or even.
It is possible to deﬁne a permutation to be even or odd according as it is a product of an
even or odd number of transpositions, but then one has to go through an argument as above
to show that this is a well-deﬁned notion.
The corollary says that Sn is generated by transpositions. For An there is the following
result.
Corollary 4.23. The alternating group An is generated by cycles of length three.
Proof. Any α ∈An is the product of an even number of transpositions, α = t1t′
1 · · · tmt′
m,
but the product of two transpositions can always be written as a product of 3-cycles:
(ij)(kl) =


(ij)(jl) = (ijl)
case j = k,
(ij)(jk)(jk)(kl) = (ijk)(jkl)
case i, j, k, l distinct,

case (ij) = (kl).

GROUP THEORY
33
Recall that two elements a and b of a group G are said to be conjugate a ∼b if there
exists an element g ∈G such that b = gag−1, and that conjugacy is an equivalence relation.
For any group G, it is useful to determine the conjugacy classes in G.
Example 4.24. In Sn, the conjugate of a cycle is given by:
g(i1 . . . ik)g−1 = (g(i1) . . . g(ik)).
Hence g(i1 . . .ir)(j1 . . .js) . . . (l1 . . . lu)g−1 = (g(i1) . . . g(ir))(g(j1) . . . g(js)) . . . (g(l1)...g(lu))
(even if the cycles are not disjoint). In other words, to obtain gαg−1, replace each element
in a cycle of α be its image under g.
We shall now determine the conjugacy classes in Sn. By a partition of n, we mean a
sequence of integers n1, . . . , nk such that 1 ≤ni ≤ni+1 ≤n (all i) and
n1 + n2 + · · · + nk = n.
Thus there are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . partitions of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . respectively (and
1, 121, 505 partitions of 61). Note that a partition
{1, 2, ..., n} = O1 ∪... ∪Ok
(disjoint union)
of {1, 2, . . . , n} determines a partition of n,
n = n1 + n2 + ... + nk,
ni = #(Oi).
Since the orbits of an element α of Sn form a partition of {1, . . . , n}, we can attach to each
such α a partition of n. For example, if
α = (i1 . . . in1) · · · (l1 . . .lnk),
(disjoint cycles)
1 < ni ≤ni+1,
then the partition of n attached to α is
1, 1, . . . , 1, n1, . . . , nk
(n −

ni ones).
Proposition 4.25. Two elements α and β of Sn are conjugate if and only if they deﬁne the
same partitions of n.
Proof.
⇐= : Since α and β deﬁne the same partitions of n, their decompositions into
products of disjoint cycles have the same type:
α = (i1 . . .ir)(j1 . . . js) . . . (l1 . . .lu),
β = (i′
1 . . . i′
r)(j′
1 . . .j′
s) . . . (l′
1 . . . l′
u).
If we deﬁne g to be
	
i1
· · ·
ir
j1
· · ·
js
· · ·
l1
· · ·
lu
i′
1
· · ·
i′
r
j′
1
· · ·
j′
s
· · ·
l′
1
· · ·
l′
u

then
gαg−1 = β.
=⇒: It follows from the calculation in (4.24) that conjugating an element preserves the
type of its disjoint cycle decomposition.
Example 4.26. (ijk) = (1234...
ijk4...)(123)(1234...
ijk4... )−1.

J.S. MILNE
Remark 4.27. For 1 < k ≤n, there are n(n−1)···(n−k+1)
k
distinct k-cycles in Sn. The 1
k is
needed so that we don’t count
(i1i2 . . .ik) = (iki1 . . .ik−1) = . . .
k times. Similarly, it is possible to compute the number of elements in any conjugacy class in
Sn, but a little care is needed when the partition of n has several terms equal. For example,
the number of permutations in S4 of type (ab)(cd) is
1
2
4 × 3
2
× 2 × 1
2

= 3.
The
1
2 is needed so that we don’t count (ab)(cd) = (cd)(ab) twice. For S4 we have the
following table:
Partition
Element
No. in Conj. Class
Parity
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1
1
even
1 + 1 + 2
(ab)
6
odd
1 + 3
(abc)
8
even
2 + 2
(ab)(cd)
3
even
4
(abcd)
6
odd
Note that A4 contains exactly 3 elements of order 2, namely those of type 2 + 2, and that
together with 1 they form a subgroup V . This group is a union of conjugacy classes, and is
therefore a normal subgroup of S4.
Theorem 4.28 (Galois). The group An is simple if n ≥5
Remark 4.29. For n = 2, An is trivial, and for n = 3, An is cyclic of order 3, and hence
simple; for n = 4 it is nonabelian and nonsimple (it contains the normal (even characteristic)
subgroup V —see above).
Lemma 4.30. Let N be a normal subgroup of An (n ≥5); if N contains a cycle of length
three, then it contains all cycles of length three, and so equals An.
Proof. Let γ be the cycle of length three in N, and let α be a second cycle of length three
in An. We know that α = gγg−1 for some g ∈Sn. If g ∈An, then this shows that α is also
in N. If not, because n ≥5, there exists a transposition t ∈Sn disjoint from α, and then
α = tαt−1 = tgγg−1t−1,
tg ∈An,
and so again α ∈N.
The next lemma completes the proof of the Theorem.
Lemma 4.31. Every normal subgroup N of An, n ≥5, N ̸= 1, contains a cycle of length 3.
Proof. Let α ∈N, α ̸= 1. If α is not a 3-cycle, we shall construct another element α′ ∈N,
α′ ̸= 1, which ﬁxes more elements of {1, 2, . . . , n} than does α. If α′ is not a 3-cycle, then
we can apply the same construction. After a ﬁnite number of steps, we arrive at a 3-cycle.
Suppose α is not a 3-cycle. When we express it as a product of disjoint cycles, either it
contains a cycle of length ≥3 or else it is a product of transpositions, say
(i) α = (i1i2i3...) · · · or
(ii) α = (i1i2)(i3i4) · · · .

GROUP THEORY
35
In the ﬁrst case, α moves two numbers, say i4, i5, other than i1, i2, i3, because α ̸= (i1 . . .i4).
Let γ = (i3i4i5). Then α1 =df γαγ−1 = (i1i2i4 . . .) · · · ∈N, and is distinct from α (because it
acts diﬀerently on i2). Thus α′ =df α1α−1 ̸= 1, but α′ = γαγ−1α−1 ﬁxes i2 and all elements
other than i1, ..., i5 ﬁxed by α—it therefore ﬁxes more elements than α.
In the second case, form γ, α1, α2 as before with i4 as in (ii) and i5 any element distinct
from i1, i2, i3, i4. Then α1 = (i1i2)(i4i5) · · · is distinct from α because it acts diﬀerently on
i4. Thus α′ = α1α−1 ̸= 1, but α′ ﬁxes i1 and i2, and all elements ̸= i1, ..., i5 not ﬁxed by
α—it therefore ﬁxes at least one more element than α.
Corollary 4.32. For n ≥5, the only normal subgroups of Sn are 1, An, and Sn.
Proof. If N is normal in Sn, then N ∩An is normal in An. Therefore either N ∩An = An or
N ∩An = {1}. In the ﬁrst case, N ⊃An, which has index 2 in Sn, and so N = An or Sn. In
the second case, the map x →xAn : N →Sn/An is injective, and so N has order 1 or 2, but
it can’t have order 2 because no conjugacy class in Sn (other than {1}) consists of a single
element.
Remark 4.33. A group G is said to be solvable if there exist subgroups
G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃G2 ⊃G3 ⊃· · · ⊃Gr = {1}
such that each Gi is normal in Gi−1 and the quotient Gi−1/Gi is abelian. Thus An (also Sn)
is not solvable if n ≥5.
Let f(X) ∈Q[X] be of degree n. In the second part of the course, we shall attach to
f a subgroup of the group of permutations of the roots of f, Gf ⊂Sn, and we shall show
that the roots of f can be obtained from the coeﬃcients of f by extracting radicals if and
only if Gf is solvable. We shall see, that there exist (lots of) polynomials of all degrees with
Gf = Sn.
4.3. The Todd-Coxeter algorithm.
Let G be a group described by a ﬁnite presentation, and let H be a subgroup described
by a generating set. Then the Todd-Coxeter algorithm 11 is a strategy for writing down
the set of left cosets of H in G together with the action of G on the set. I illustrate it
with an example (see M. Artin, Algebra, 6.9 for more details, but note that he composes
permutations backwards).
Let G =<a, b, c|a3, b2, c2, cba> and let H be the subgroup generated by c (strictly speaking,
H is the subgroup generated by the element of G represented by the reduced word c). The
operation of G on the set of cosets is described by the action of the generators, which must
satisfy the following rules:
(i) Each generator (a, b, c in our example) acts as a permutation.
(ii) The relations (a3, b2, c2, cba in our example) act trivially.
(iii) The generators of H (c in our example) ﬁx the coset 1H.
(iv) The operation on the cosets is transitive.
11To solve a problem, an algorithm must always terminate in a ﬁnite time with the correct answer to
the problem.
The Todd-Coxeter algorithm does not solve the problem of determining whether a ﬁnite
presentation deﬁnes a ﬁnite group (in fact, there is no such algorithm). It does, however, solve the problem
of determining the order of a ﬁnite group from a ﬁnite presentation of the group (use the algorithm with H
the trivial subgroup 1.)

36
J.S. MILNE
The strategy is to introduce cosets, denoted 1, 2, . . . with 1 = 1H, as necessary.
Rule (iii) tells us simply that c1 = c. We now apply the ﬁrst two rules. Since we don’t
what a1 is, let’s denote it 2: a1 = 2. Similarly, let a2 = 3. Now a3 = a31, which according
to (ii) must be 1. Thus, we have introduce three (potential) cosets 1,2,3, permuted by a as
follows:
1
a→2
a→3
a→1.
What is b1? We don’t know, and so it is prudent to introduce another coset 4 = b1. Now
b4 = 1, and so we have
1
b→4
b→1.
We still have the relation cba. We know a1 = 2, but we don’t know what b2 is, and so set
b2 = 5. By (iii) c1 = 1, and by (ii) applied to cba we have c5 = 1. Therefore, according to
(i) we must have 5 = 1; we drop 5, and so now b2 = 1. Since b4 = 1 we must have 4 = 2,
and so we can drop 4 also. What we know can be summarized by the table:
a

We ﬁnd that we have three cosets on which a, b, c act as
a = (123)
b = (12)
c = (23).
More precisely, we have written down a map G →S3 that is consistent with the above rules.
A theorem (Artin, ibid.) now says that this does in fact describe the action of G on G/H.
Since the three elements (123), (12), and (23) generate S3, this shows that the action of G
on G/H induces an isomorphism G →S3, and that H is a subgroup of order 2.
In (Artin, ibid.) it is explained how to make this procedure into an algorithm which, when
it succeeds in producing a consistent table, will in fact produce the correct table.
This algorithm is implemented in Maple, except that it computes the action the right
cosets. Here is a transcript: >with(group); [loads the group theory package.]
>G:=grelgroup({a,b,c},{[a,a,a],[b,b],[c,c],[a,b,c]}); [defines G to have
generators a,b,c and relations aaa, bb, cc, abc]

>permrep(H);
permgroup(3, a=[[1,2,3],b=[1,2],c=[2,3]])
[computes the action of G on the set of right cosets of H in G].

GROUP THEORY

4.4. Primitive actions.
Let G be a group acting on a set X, and let π be a partition of X. We say that π is stabilized
by G if
A ∈π =⇒gA ∈π for each A ∈π.
Example 4.34. (a) The subgroup G
=< (1234) > of S4 stabilizes the partition
{{1, 3}, {2, 4}} of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
(b) Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4} be identiﬁed with the set of vertices of the square on which D4
acts in the usual way, namely, σ = (1234), τ = (2, 4). Then D4 stabilizes the partition
{{1, 3}, {2, 4}}.
(c) Let X be the set of partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4} into two sets, each with two elements.
Then S4 acts on X, and Ker(S4 →Sym(X)) = V . See (4.27).
The group G always stabilizes the trivial partitions of X, namely, the set of all one-
element subsets of X, and {X}. If it stabilizes only those partitions, we say that the action
is primitive. A subgroup of Sym(X) is said to be primitive if it acts primitively on X. For
example, a subgroup of Sn is primitive if it acts primitively on {1, 2, . . . , n}. In particular,
Sn is primitive, but D4, regarded as a subgroup of S4 in the obvious way, is not primitive.
Example 4.35. A doubly transitive action is primitive: if it stabilized {{x, x′, ...}, {y, ...}...}
then there would be no element sending (x, x′) to (x, y).
Remark 4.36. The G-orbits form a partition of X that is stabilized by G. If the action is
primitive, then the partition of orbits must be one of the trivial ones. Hence
primitive =⇒action transitive or trivial (gx = x all g, x).
For the remainder of this section, G is a ﬁnite group acting transitively on a set X with
at least two elements.
Proposition 4.37. The group G acts imprimitively if and only if there is an
A ⊂X,
A ̸= X,
#A ≥2,
such that, for each g ∈G, gA = A or gA ∩A = ∅.
Proof. =⇒: The partition π stablized by G contains such an A.
⇐= : Suppose we have such an A. We can form a partition {A, g1A, g2A, ..., B} where
B = X − gA = ∅(because G acts transitively). It is stabilized by G.
A subset A of X such that, for each g ∈G, gA = A or gA ∩A = ∅is called block.
Proposition 4.38. Let A be a block in X with #A ≥2, A ̸= X. For any x ∈A,
Stab(x) ⫋Stab(A) ⫋G.
Proof. We have Stab(A) ⊃Stab(x) because
gx = x =⇒gA ∩A ̸= ∅=⇒gA = A.
Let y ∈A, y ̸= x. Because G acts transitively on X, there is a g ∈G such that gx = y.
Then g ∈Stab(A), but g /∈Stab(x).
Let y /∈A. There is a g ∈G such that gx = y, and then g /∈Stab(A).

38
J.S. MILNE
Theorem 4.39. Under the above assumptions, G acts primitively on X ⇐⇒Stab(x) is a
maximal subgroup of G for one (hence all) x ∈X.
Proof. If G does not act primitively on X, then (see 4.37) there is a block A ⫋X with at
least two elements, and so (4.38) shows that Stab(x) will not be maximal for any x ∈A.
Conversely, if there exists an x in X and a group H such that
Stab(x) ⫋H ⫋G
then I claim that A = Hx is a block ̸= X with at least two elements.
Because G acts transitively on X, G/ Stab(x)
≈→X, and so H ̸= Stab(x) =⇒Hx ̸= {x}.
Hence the condition on H implies {x} ⫋A ⫋X.
If g ∈H, then gA = A. If g /∈H, then gA is disjoint from A: for suppose ghx = h′x; then
h′−1gh ∈Stab(x) ⊂H, say h′−1gh = h′′, and g = h′h′′h−1 ∈H.

5. The Sylow Theorems; Applications
In this section, all groups are ﬁnite. If pr is the highest power of the prime p dividing
(G : 1), then a subgroup of G of order pr is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G. The Sylow
theorems state that there exist Sylow p-subgroups for all primes p dividing (G : 1), that all
Sylow p-subgroups for a ﬁxed p are conjugate, and that every p-subgroup of G is contained in
such a subgroup; moreover, the theorems restrict the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups
in G.
5.1. The Sylow theorems.
In the proofs, we frequently use that if O is an orbit for a group H acting on a set X, and
x0 ∈O, then the map H →X, g →hx0 induces a bijection
H/ Stab(x0) →O;
see (4.7). Therefore
(H : Stab(x0)) = #O.
In particular, if H is a p-group, then #O is a power of p: either O consists of a single element,
or #O is divisible by p. Since X is a disjoint union of the orbits, we can conclude:
Lemma 5.1. Let H be a p-group acting on a ﬁnite set X, and let XH be the set of points
ﬁxed by H; then #X ≡#XH (mod p).
When the lemma is applied to a p-group H acting on itself by conjugation, we ﬁnd that
(Z(H) : 1) ≡(H : 1)
mod p
because the orbits in this case are the conjugacy classes, and the conjugacy class of h consists
only of h if and only if h is in the centre of H.
Theorem 5.2 (Sylow I). Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let p be prime. If pr|(G : 1), then G
has a subgroup of order pr.
Proof. According to (4.15), it suﬃces to prove this with pr the highest power of p dividing
(G : 1), and so from now on we assume that (G : 1) = prm with m not divisible by p. Let
X = {subsets of G with pr elements},
with the action of G deﬁned by
G × X →X,
(g, A) →gA =df {ga | a ∈A}.
Let A ∈X, and let
H = Stab(A) =df {g ∈G | gA ⊂A}.
For any a0 ∈A, h →ha0 : H →A is injective, and so (H : 1) ≤#A = pr. Consider
(G : H) = (G : H)(H : 1).
We know pr|(G : H), (H : 1) ≤pr, and (G : H) = #O where O is the orbit of A. If we
can ﬁnd an A such that p doesn’t divide #O, then we can conclude that (for such an A),
H = Stab A has order pr.
The number of elements in X is
#X =
	
prm
pr

= (prm)(prm −1) · · · (prm −i) · · · (prm −pr + 1)
pr(pr −1) · · · (pr −i) · · · (pr −pr + 1)
.

J.S. MILNE
Note that, because i < pr, the power of p dividing prm −i is the power of p dividing i. The
same is true of pr −i. Therefore the corresponding terms on top and bottom are divisible
by the same powers of p, and so p does not divide #X. Because the orbits form a partition
of X,
#X =

#Oi,
Oi the distinct orbits,
at least one of the #Oi is not divisible by p.
Remark 5.3. The proof can be modiﬁed to show directly that for each power pr of p dividing
(G : 1), there is a subgroup H of G of order pr. One again writes (G : 1) = prm and considers
the set X of all subsets of order pr. In this case, #X is divisible by the highest power pr0 of
p dividing m, but not by pr0+1, and it follows that there is an A ∈X the number of elements
in whose orbit is not divisible by pr0+1. For such an A, the same counting argument shows
that Stab(A) has pr elements.
We obtain another proof of Cauchy’s theorem.
Corollary 5.4 (Cauchy). If a prime p divides (G : 1), then G has an element of order p.
Proof. We have to show that a p-group H ̸= 1 contains an element of order p. But any
element g ̸= 1 of such an H is of order pm for some m ≥1, and gpm−1 will have order p.
Example 5.5. Let Fp = Z/pZ, the ﬁeld with p elements, and let G = GLn(Fp). Then the
order of G is
(pn −1)(pn −p)(pn −p2) · · · (pn −pn−1).
Therefore the power of p dividing (G : 1) is p1+2+···+(n−1). Consider the matrices of the form


They form a subgroup H of order pn−1pn−2 · · · p, which is therefore a Sylow p-subgroup G.
Corollary 5.6. Any group of order 2p, p an odd prime, is cyclic or dihedral.
Proof. From the last corollary, we know that such a G contains elements τ and σ of orders 2
and p respectively. Let H =<σ>. Then H is of index 2, and so is normal. Obviously τ /∈H,
and so G = H ∪Hτ :
G = {1, σ, . . . , σp−1, τ, στ, . . . , σp−1τ}.
As H is normal, τστ −1 = σi, some i. Because τ 2 = 1, σ = τ 2στ −2 = τ(τστ −1)τ −1 = σi2,
and so i2 ≡1 mod p. The only elements of Fp with square 1 are ±1, and so i ≡1 or -1 mod
p. In the ﬁrst case, the group is commutative (any group generated by a set of commuting
elements is obviously commutative); in the second τστ −1 = σ−1 and we have the dihedral
group.
Theorem 5.7 (Sylow II). Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let (G : 1) = prm with m not
divisible by p.
(a) Any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.
(b) Let sp be the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G; then sp|m, and sp ≡1 mod p.
(c) Any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup.

GROUP THEORY

Let H be a subgroup of G. Recall (p27) that the normalizer of H in G is
NG(H) = {g ∈G | gHg−1 = H},
and that the number of conjugates of H in G is (G : NG(H)). For a Sylow p-subgroup P,
the number of conjugates of P is
(G : NG(P)) =
(G : 1)
(NG(P) : 1) =
(G : 1)
(NG(P) : P) · (P : 1) =
m
(NG(P) : P).
Thus (a) of the theorem implies that sp = (G : NG(P)), which, we have just seen, divides
m. In order to prove the rest of the theorem, we need the following key lemma.
Lemma 5.8. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and let H be a p-subgroup. If H normalizes
P, i.e., if H ⊂NG(P), then H ⊂P. Therefore no Sylow p-subgroup of G other than P
normalizes P.
Proof. Because H and P are subgroups of NG(P) with P normal in NG(P), HP is a subgroup,
and H/H ∩P ≈HP/P (see 3.2). Therefore (HP : P) is a power of p (here is where we use
that H is a p-group), but
(HP : 1) = (HP : P)(P : 1),
and (P : 1) is the largest power of p dividing (G : 1), hence also the largest power of p
dividing (HP : 1). Thus (HP : P) = p0 = 1, and H ⊂P.
Proof. (of Sylow II). This time we let X = {Sylow p-subgroups}, and we let G act on X by
conjugation. Let O be one of the G-orbits: we have to show O is all of X.
Let P ∈O, and consider the action by conjugation of P on O. This single G-orbit may
break up into several P-orbits, one of which will be {P}. In fact this is the only one-point
orbit because {Q} is a P-orbit if and only if P normalizes Q, but we know from Lemma 5.8
that then Q = P. Hence the number of elements in every P-orbit other than {P} is divisible
by p, and we have that #O ≡1 mod p.
Suppose there is a P /∈O. We again let P act on O, but this time the argument shows
that there are no one-point orbits, and so the number of elements in every P-orbit is divisible
by p. This implies that #O is divisible by p, which contradicts what we proved in the last
paragraph. There can be no such P, and so O is all of X—we have proved (a).
Since sp is now the number of elements in O, we have also shown that sp ≡1 (mod p),
and so it remains to prove (c).
Let H be a p-subgroup of G, and let H act on the set X of Sylow p-subgroups by conju-
gation. Because #X = sp is not divisible by p, XH must be nonempty (Lemma 5.1), i.e.,
at least one H-orbit consists of a single Sylow p-subgroup. But then H normalizes P and
Lemma 5.8 implies that H ⊂P.
Corollary 5.9. A Sylow p-subgroup is normal ⇐⇒it is the only Sylow p-subgroup.
Proof. In fact (without using the Sylow theorems), we know (3.12c) that if P is the only
Sylow p-subgroup, then P is characteristic. The converse follows from (a) of Sylow II.
Corollary 5.10. Suppose that a group G has only one Sylow p-subgroup for each p|(G : 1).
Then G is a product of its Sylow p-subgroups.

42
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Let P1, . . . , Pr be the Sylow subgroups of G. Because they are normal, P1P2 is a
normal subgroup of G. Moreover P1 ∩P2 = 1, and so (3.6) implies (a, b) →ab : P1 × P2 →
P1P2 is an isomorphism (cf.
Exercise 15).
In particular, P1P2 has order pn1
1 pn2
2
where
pni
i
= (Pi : 1). Now P1P2 ∩P3 = 1, and so P1 × P2 × P3 ≈P1P2P3. Continue in this
manner.
Example 5.11. There is a geometric description of the Sylow subgroups of G = GLn(Fp).
Let V = Fn
p, regarded as a vector space of dimension n over Fp. A full ﬂag F in V is a
sequence of subspaces
V = Vn ⊃Vn−1 ⊃· · · ⊃Vi ⊃· · · ⊃V1 ⊃{0}
with dim Vi = i. Given such a ﬂag F0, let P(F0) be the set of linear maps α : V →V such
that
(a) α(Vi) ⊂Vi for all i, and
(b) the endomorphism of Vi/Vi−1 induced by α is the identity map.
I claim that P(F0) is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Indeed, we can construct a basis {e1, . . . , en}
for V such {e1} is basis for V1, {e1, e2} is a basis for V2, etc.. Relative to this basis, the
matrices of the elements of P(F0) are exactly the elements of the group P of (5.5).
Let α ∈GLn(F). Then αF0 =df {αVn, αVn−1, . . . } is again a full ﬂag, and P(αF0) =
αP(F0)α−1. From (a) of Sylow II, we see that the Sylow p-subgroups of G are precisely the
groups of the form P(F) for some full ﬂag F.
5.2. Classiﬁcation.
We apply what we have learnt to obtain information about groups of various orders.
Example 5.12 (Groups of order 99). Let G have order 99. The Sylow theorems imply
that G has at least one subgroup H of order 11, and in fact s11
 99
11 and s11 ≡1 mod 11. It
follows that s11 = 1, and H is normal. Similarly, s9|11 and s9 ≡1 mod 3, and so the Sylow
3-subgroup is also normal. Hence G is isomorphic to the product of its Sylow subgroups,
and so is commutative.
Here is an alternative proof. Verify as before that the Sylow 11-subgroup N of G is normal.
The Sylow 3-subgroup Q maps bijectively onto G/N, and so G = N ⋊Q. It remains to
determine the action by conjugation of Q on N. But Aut(N) is cyclic of order 10 (see 3.9,
3.10), and so the only homomorphism Q →Aut(N) is the trivial one (the homomorphism
that maps everything to 1). It follows that G is commutative.
Example 5.13 (Groups of order pq, p, q primes, p < q). Let G be such a group, and
let P and Q be Sylow p and q subgroups. Then (G : Q) = p, which is the smallest prime
dividing (G : 1), and so (see Exercise 22) Q is normal. Because P maps bijectively onto
G/Q, we have that
G = Q ⋊P,
and it remains to determine the action of P on Q by conjugation.
The group Aut(Q) is cyclic of order q −1, and so, unless p|q −1, G = Q × P.
If p|q −1, then Aut(Q) (being cyclic) has a unique subgroup P ′ of order p. In fact P ′
consists of the maps
x →xi,
{i ∈Fq | ip = 1}.

GROUP THEORY
43
Let a and b be generators for P and Q respectively, and suppose that the action of a on Q
by conjugation is x →xi0, i0 ̸= 1 (in Fq). Then G has generators a, b and relations ap, bq,
aba−1 = bi0. Choosing a diﬀerent i0 amounts to choosing a diﬀerent generator a for P, and
so gives an isomorphic group G.
In summary: if p ∤q −1, then the only group of order pq is the cyclic group Cpq; if p|q −1,
then there is also a nonabelian group given by the above generators and relations.
The semidirect product N ⋊θQ is determined by the triple (N, Q, θ : Q →Aut(N)). It will
be useful to have criteria for when two triples (N, Q, θ) and (N, Q, θ′) determine isomorphic
groups.
Lemma 5.14. If θ and θ′ are conjugate, i.e., there exists an α ∈Aut(N) such that θ′ =
α ◦θ(q) ◦α−1 for all q ∈Q, then
N ⋊θ Q ≈N ⋊θ′ Q.
Proof. Consider the map
γ : N ⋊θ Q →N ⋊θ′ Q,
(n, q) →(α(n), q).
Then
γ(n, q) · γ(n′, q′) = (α(n), q) · (α(n′), q′) = (α(n) · (α ◦θ(q) ◦α−1)(α(n′)), qq′),
and
γ((n, q) · (n′, q′)) = γ(n · θ(q)(n′), qq′) = (α(n) · (α ◦θ)(q)(n′), qq′).
Therefore γ is a homomorphism, with inverse (n, q) →(α−1(n), q), and so is an isomor-
phism.
Lemma 5.15. If θ = θ′ ◦α with α ∈Aut(Q), then
N ⋊θ Q ≈N ⋊θ′ Q.
Proof. The map (n, q) →(n, α(q)) is an isomorphism N ⋊θ Q →N ⋊θ′ Q.
Lemma 5.16. If Q is cyclic and the subgroup θ(Q) of Aut(N) is conjugate to θ′(Q), then
N ⋊θ Q ≈N ⋊θ′ Q.
Proof. Let a generate Q. Then there exists an i and an α ∈Aut(N) such that
θ′(ai) = α · θ(a) · α−1.
The map (n, q) →(α(n), qi) is an isomorphism N ⋊θ Q →N ⋊θ′ Q.
Example 5.17 (Groups of order 30). Let G be a group of order 30. Then
s3
=
1, 4, 7, 10, . . . and divides 10;
s5
=
1, 6, 11, . . . and divides 6.
Hence s3 = 1 or 10, and s5 = 1 or 6. In fact, at least one is 1, for otherwise there would
be 20 elements of order 2 and 24 elements of order 5, which is impossible. Therefore, a
Sylow 3-subgroup P or a Sylow 5-subgroup Q is normal, and so H = PQ is a subgroup of
G. Because 3 doesn’t divide 5 −1 = 4, (5.13) shows that H is commutative, H ≈C3 × C5.
Hence
G = (C3 × C5) ⋊θ C2,

44
J.S. MILNE
and it remains to determine the possible homomorphisms θ : C2 →Aut(C3 × C5). But such
a homomorphism θ is determined by the image of the nonidentity element of C2, which must
be an element of order 2. Let a, b, c generate C3, C5, C2. Then
Aut(C3 × C5) = Aut(C3) × Aut(C5),
and the only nontrivial elements of Aut C3 and Aut C5 are a →a−1 and b →b−1. Thus there
are exactly 4 homomorphisms θ, and θ(c) is one of the following elements:

a →a
b →b

a →a
b →b−1

a →a−1
b →b

a →a−1
b →b−1 .
The groups corresponding to these homomorphisms have centres of order 30, 3 (generated
by a), 5 (generated by b), and 1 respectively, and hence are nonisomorphic. We have shown
that (up to isomorphism) there are exactly 4 groups of order 30. For example, the third on
our list has generators a, b, c and relations
a3,
b5,
c2,
ab = ba,
cac−1 = a−1,
cbc−1 = b.
Example 5.18 (Groups of order 12). Let G be a group of order 12, and let P be its
Sylow 3-subgroup. If P is not normal, then the map (4.2c)
ϕ : G →Sym(G/P) ≈S4
is injective, and its image is a subgroup of S4 of order 12. From Sylow II we see that G
has exactly 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and hence it has exactly 8 elements of order 3. But all
elements of S4 of order 3 are in A4 (see 4.27), and so ϕ(G) intersects A4 in a subgroup with
at least 8 elements. By Lagrange’s theorem ϕ(G) = A4, and so G ≈A4.
Thus, assume P is normal. Then G = P ⋊Q where Q is the Sylow 4-subgroup. If Q
is cyclic of order 4, then there is a unique nontrivial map Q(= C4) →Aut(P)(= C2), and
hence we obtain a single noncommutative group C3 ⋊C4. If Q = C2 ×C2, there are exactly 3
nontrivial homomorphism θ : Q →Aut(P), but the three groups resulting are all isomorphic
to S3 × C2 with C2 = Ker θ. (The homomorphisms diﬀer by an automorphism of Q, and so
we can also apply Lemma 5.15.)
In total, there are 3 noncommutative groups of order 12 and 2 commutative groups
Example 5.19 (Groups of order p3). Let G be a group of order p3, with p an odd prime,
and assume G is not commutative. We know from (4.15) that G has a normal subgroup N
of order p2.
If every element of G has order p (except 1), then N ≈Cp × Cp and there is a subgroup
Q of G of order p such that Q ∩N = {1}. Hence
G = N ⋊θ Q
for some homomorphism θ : Q →N. The Sylow p-subgroups of N have order p (special case
of 5.5), and so we can apply Lemma 5.16 to see that there we obtain only one nonabelian
group in this case.
Suppose G has elements of order p2, and let N be the subgroup generated by such an
element a. Because (G : N) = p is the smallest (in fact only) prime dividing (G : 1), N is
normal in G. The problem is to show that G contains an element of order p not in N.
We know Z(G) ̸= 1, and (see 4.17) that G/Z(G) is not cyclic. Therefore (Z(G) : 1) = p
and G/Z(G) ≈Cp×Cp. In particular, we see that for all x ∈G, xp ∈Z(G). Because G/Z(G)

GROUP THEORY

is commutative, the commutator [x, y] ∈Z(G) for all x, y ∈G, and an easy induction
argument shows that
(xy)n = xnyn[y, x]
n(n−1)
2
,
n ≥1.
Therefore (xy)p = xpyp, and so x →xp : G →G is a homomorphism. Its image is contained
in Z(G), and so its kernel has order at least p2. Since N contains only p−1 elements of order
p, we see that there exists an element b outside N. Hence G =<a> ⋊<b>≈Cp2 ⋊Cp, and it
remains to observe (5.16) that the nontrivial homomorphisms Cp →Aut(Cp2) ≈Cp × Cp−1
give isomorphic groups.
Thus, up to isomorphism, the only noncommutative groups of order p3 are those con-
structed in (3.16e).
Example 5.20 (Groups of order 2mpn, p odd). Let G be a group of order 2mpn, 1 ≤
m ≤3, p an odd prime, 1 ≤n. We shall show that G is not simple. Let P be a Sylow
p-subgroup and let N = NG(P), so that sp = (G : N).
From Sylow II, we know that sp|2m, sp = 1, p + 1, . . . . If sp = 1, P is normal. If not, there
are two cases to consider:
(i) sp = 4 and p = 3, or
(ii) sp = 8 and p = 7.
In the ﬁrst case, the action by conjugation of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups12 deﬁnes a
homomorphism G →S4, which, if G is simple, must be injective. Therefore (G : 1)|4!, and
so n = 1; we have (G : 1) = 2m3. Now the Sylow 2-subgroup has index 3, and we have a
homomorphism G →S3. Its kernel is a nontrivial normal subgroup of G.
In the second case, the same argument shows that (G : 1)|8!, and so n = 1 again. Thus
(G : 1) = 56 and s7 = 8. Therefore G has 48 elements of order 7, and so there can be only
one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must therefore be normal.
Note that groups of order pqr, p, q primes, p < q are not simple, because Exercise 22 shows
that the Sylow q-subgroup is normal. An examination of cases now reveals that A5 is the
smallest noncyclic simple group.
Example 5.21. Let G be a simple group of order 60. We shall show that G is isomorphic
to A5.
Note that, because G is simple, s2 = 3, 5, or 15. If P is a Sylow 2-subgroup and N =
NG(P), then s2 = (G : N).
The case s2 = 3 is impossible, because the kernel of G →Sym(G/N) would be a nontrivial
subgroup of G.
In the case s2 = 5, we get an inclusion G %→Sym(G/N) = S5, which realizes G as a
subgroup of index 2 in S5, but we saw in (4.32) that An is the only subgroup of index 2 in
S5.
In the case s2 = 15, a counting argument (using that s5 = 6) shows that there exist two
Sylow 2-subgroups P and Q intersecting in a group of order 2. The normalizer N of P ∩Q
contains P and Q, and so has order 12, 20, or 60. In the ﬁrst case, the above argument show
that G ≈A5, and the remaining cases contradict the simplicity of G.
12Equivalently, the usual map G →Sym(G/N).

6. Normal Series; Solvable and Nilpotent Groups
6.1. Normal Series.
Let G be a group.
A normal series (better subnormal series) in G is a ﬁnite chain of
subgroups
G = G0 ▷G1 ▷· · · ▷Gi ▷Gi+1 ▷· · · ▷Gn = {1}.
Thus Gi+1 is normal in Gi, but not necessarily in G.
The series is said to be without
repetitions if Gi ̸= Gi+1. Then n is called the length of the series. The quotient groups
Gi/Gi+1 are called the quotient (or factor) groups of the series.
A normal series is said to be a composition series if it has no repetitions and can’t be
reﬁned, i.e., if Gi+1 is a maximal proper subgroup in Gi for each i. Thus a normal series is
a composition series ⇐⇒each quotient group is simple and ̸= 1. Obviously, every ﬁnite
group has a composition series (usually many): choose G1 to be a maximal proper normal
subgroup of G; then choose G2 to be a maximal proper normal subgroup of G1, etc.. An
inﬁnite group may or may not have a ﬁnite composition series.
Note that from a normal series
G = Gn ▷Gn−1 ▷· · · ▷Gi+1 ▷Gi ▷· · · ▷G1 ⊃{1}
we obtain a sequence of exact sequences
1 →G1 →G2 →G2/G1 →1
1 →G2 →G3 →G3/G2 →1
· · ·
1 →Gn−1 →Gn →Gn/Gn−1 →1.
Thus G is built up out of the quotients G1, G2/G1, . . . , Gn/Gn−1 by forming successive
extensions. In particular, since every ﬁnite group has a composition series, it can be regarded
as being built up out of simple groups. The Jordan-H¨older theorem says that these simple
groups are (essentially) independent of the composition series.
Note that if G has a normal series G = G0 ▷G1 ▷G2 ▷· · · , then
(G : 1) =

(Gi−1 : Gi) =

(Gi−1/Gi : 1).
Example 6.1. (a) The symmetric group S3 has a composition series
S3 ▷A3 ▷1
with quotients C2, C3.
(b) The symmetric group S4 has a composition series
S4 ▷A4 ▷V ▷<(13)(24)>▷1,
where V ≈C2 × C2 consists of all elements of order 2 in A4 (see 4.27). The quotients are
C2, C3, C2, C2.
(c) Any full ﬂag in Fn
p, p a prime, is a composition series. Its length is n, and its quotients
are Cp, Cp, . . . , Cp.

(e) Suppose G is a product of simple groups, G = H1×· · ·×Hr. Then G has a composition
series
G ▷H2 × · · · × Hr ▷H3 × · · · × Hr ▷· · ·
of length r and with quotients H1, H2, . . . , Hr.
Note that for any permutation π of
{1, 2, . . . r}, there is another composition series with quotients Hπ(1), Hπ(2), . . . , Hπ(r).
(f) We saw in (4.32) that for n ≥5, the only normal subgroups of Sn are Sn, An, {1}, and
in (4.28) that An is simple. Hence Sn ▷An ▷{1} is the only composition series for Sn.
As we have seen, a ﬁnite group may have many composition series. The Jordan-H¨older
theorem says that they all have the same length, and the same quotients (up to order and
isomorphism). More precisely:
Theorem 6.2 (Jordan-H¨older). If
G = G0 ▷G1 ▷· · · ▷Gs = {1}
G = H0 ▷H1 ▷· · · ▷Ht = {1}
are two composition series for G, then s = t and there is a permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , s}
such that Gi/Gi+1 ≈Hπ(i)/Hπ(i+1). 13
Proof. We use induction on the order of G.
Case I: H1 = G1. In this case, we have two composition series for G1, to which we can
apply the induction hypothesis.
Case II: H1 ̸= G1. Because each of G1 and H1 is normal in G, G1H1 is a normal subgroup
of G, and it properly contains both G1 and H1. But they are maximal normal subgroups of
G, and so G1H1 = G. Therefore
G/G1 = G1H1/G1 ≈H1/G1 ∩H1
(see 3.2).
Similarly G/H1 ≈G1/G1 ∩H1. Hence K2 =df G1 ∩H1 is a maximal normal subgroup in

On applying the induction hypothesis to G1 and H1 and their composition series in the
diagram, we ﬁnd that
Quotients(G ▷G1 ▷G2 ▷· · · )
∼
{G/G1, G1/G2, G2/G3, . . . }
∼
{G/G1, G1/K2, K2/K3, . . . }

∼
{G/H1, H1/H2, H2/H3, . . .}
∼
Quotients(G ▷H1 ▷H2 ▷· · · ).
In passing from the second to the third line, we used the isomorphisms G/G1 ≈H1/K2 and
G/H1 ≈G1/K2.
Note that the theorem applied to a cyclic group Cm implies that the factorization of an
integer into a product of primes is unique.
Remark 6.3. There are inﬁnite groups having ﬁnite composition series (there are inﬁnite
simple groups). For such a group, let d(G) be the minimum length of a composition series.
Then the Jordan-H¨older theorem extends to show that all composition series have length
d(G) and have isomorphic quotient groups. The same proof works: use induction on d(G)
instead of (G : 1).
The quotients of a composition series are also called composition factors. (Some authors
call a quotient group G/N a “factor” group of G; I prefer to reserve this term for a subgroup
H of G such that G = H × H′.)
6.2. Solvable groups.
A group is solvable if it has a normal series whose quotient groups are all commutative. Such
a series is called a solvable series. Alternatively, we can say that a group is solvable if it can
be obtained by forming successive extensions of abelian groups. Since a commutative group
is simple if and only if it is cyclic of prime order, we see that G is solvable if and only if for
one (hence every) composition series the quotients are all cyclic groups of prime order.
Any commutative group is solvable, as is any dihedral group. The results in Section 5
show that every group of order < 60 is solvable. By contrast, a noncommutative simple
group, e.g., An for n ≥5, will not be solvable.
There is the following result:
Theorem 6.4 (Feit-Thompson 1963). Every ﬁnite group of odd order is solvable.
Proof. The proof occupies a whole issue of the Paciﬁc J. Math., and hence is omitted.
This theorem played a very important role in the development of group theory, because it
shows that every noncommutative ﬁnite simple group contains an element of order 2. It was
a starting point in the program that eventually led to the classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite simple
groups.

some ﬁeld k. Then G1 is a normal subgroup of G, and G/G1 ≈k× ×k×, G1 ≈(k, +). Hence
G is solvable.

GROUP THEORY

Proposition 6.6. (a) Every subgroup and every quotient group of a solvable group is solv-
able.
(b) An extension of solvable groups is solvable.
Proof. (a) Let G ▷G1 ▷· · · ▷Gn be a solvable series for G, and let H be a subgroup of G.
The homomorphism
x →xGi+1 : H ∩Gi →Gi/Gi+1
has kernel (H ∩Gi) ∩Gi+1 = H ∩Gi+1. Therefore H ∩Gi+1 is a normal subgroup of H ∩Gi
and the quotient H ∩Gi/H ∩Gi+1 injects into Gi/Gi+1, and so is commutative. We have
shown that
H ▷H ∩G1 ▷· · · ▷H ∩Gn
is a solvable series for H.
Let ¯G be a quotient group of G, and let ¯Gi be the image of Gi in ¯G. Then
¯G ▷¯G1 ▷· · · ▷¯Gn = {1}
is a solvable series for ¯G.
(b) Let N be a normal subgroup of G, and let ¯G = G/N. We have to show that if N and
¯G are solvable, then so also is G. Let
¯G ▷¯G1 ▷· · · ▷¯Gn = {1}
N ▷N1 ▷· · · ▷Nm = {1}
be a solvable series for ¯G and N, and let Gi be the inverse image of ¯Gi in G. Then Gi/Gi+1 ≈
¯Gi/ ¯Gi+1 (see 3.4), and so the
G ▷G1 ▷· · · ▷Gn(= N) ▷N1 ▷· · · ▷Nm
is a solvable series for G.
Corollary 6.7. A ﬁnite p-group is solvable.
Proof. We use induction on the order the group G. According to (4.14), the centre Z(G)
of G is nontrivial, and so the induction hypothesis shows that G/Z(G) is solvable. Because
Z(G) is solvable, Proposition 6.6b shows that G is solvable.
Let G be a group. Recall that the commutator of x, y ∈G is
[x, y] = xyx−1y−1 = xy(yx)−1
Thus [x, y] = 1 ⇐⇒xy = yx, and G is commutative ⇐⇒all commutators are 1.
Example 6.8. For any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V over a ﬁeld k and any full ﬂag
F = {Vn, Vn−1, . . .} in V , the group
B(F) = {α ∈Aut(V ) | α(Vi) ⊂Vi all i}
is solvable. When k = Fp, this can be proved by noting that B(F)/P(F) is commutative,
and that P(F) is a p-group and is therefore solvable. The general case is left as an exercise.

J.S. MILNE
For any homomorphism ϕ : G →H
ϕ[x, y] = ϕ(xyx−1y−1) = [ϕ(x), ϕ(y)]
i.e., ϕ maps the commutator of x, y to the commutator of ϕ(x), ϕ(y). In particular, we see
that if H is commutative, then ϕ maps all commutators in G to 1.
The group G′ generated by the commutators in G is called the commutator or ﬁrst derived
subgroup of G.
Proposition 6.9. The commutator subgroup G′ is a characteristic subgroup of G; it is the
smallest normal subgroup of G such that G/G′ is commutative.
Proof. An automorphism α of G maps the generating set for G′ into G′, and hence maps G′
into G′. Since this is true for all automorphisms of G, G′ is characteristic.
Write g →¯g for the map g →gG′ : G →G/G′; then [g, h] →[¯g, ¯h]; but [g, h] →1 and so
[¯g, ¯h] = 1 for all ¯g, ¯h ∈G/G′. Hence G/G′ is commutative.
If N is normal and G/N is commutative, then [g, h] →1 in G/N, and so [g, h] ∈N. Since
these elements generate G′, N ⊃G′.
For n ≥5, An is the smallest normal subgroup of Sn giving a commutative quotient.
Hence (Sn)′ = An.
The second derived subgroup of G is (G′)′; the third is G(3) = (G′′)′; and so on. Each
derived group is a characteristic subgroup of G. Hence we obtain a normal series
G ⊃G′ ⊃G(2) ⊃· · · ,
which is called the derived series. For example, if n ≥5, then the derived series of Sn is
Sn ⊃An ⊃An ⊃An ⊃· · · .
Proposition 6.10. A group G is solvable if and only if its kth derived subgroup G(k) = 1
for some k.
Proof. If G(k) = 1, then the derived series is a solvable series for G. Conversely, let
G = G0 ▷G1 ▷G2 ▷· · · ▷Gs = {0}
be a solvable series for G. Because G/G1 is commutative, G1 ⊃G′. Now G′G2 is a subgroup
of G1, and from
G′/G′ ∩G2
≈→G′G2/G2 ⊂G1/G2
we see that
G1/G2 commutate
=⇒G′/G′ ∩G2 commutative
=⇒G′′ ⊂G′ ∩G2 ⊂G2.
On continuing in the fashion, we ﬁnd that G(i) ⊂Gi for all i, and hence G(s) = 1.
Thus, a solvable group G has a canonical solvable series, namely the derived series, in
which all the groups are normal in G. The derived series is the shortest solvable series for
G. Its length is called the solvable length of G.

GROUP THEORY

6.3. Nilpotent groups.
Let G be a group. Recall that we write Z(G) for the centre of G. Let Z2(G) ⊃Z(G) be the
subgroup of G corresponding to Z(G/Z(G)). Thus
g ∈Z2(G) ⇐⇒[g, x] ∈Z(G) for all x ∈G.
Continuing in this fashion, we get a sequence of subgroups (ascending central series)
{1} ⊂Z(G) ⊂Z2(G) ⊂· · ·
where g ∈Zi(G) ⇐⇒[g, x] ∈Zi−1(G) for all x ∈G. If Zm(G) = G for some m, then G
is said to be nilpotent, and the smallest such m is called the (nilpotency) class of G. For
example, all ﬁnite p-groups are nilpotent.
For example, only the group {1} has nilpotency class 0, and only the abelian groups have
class 1. A group G is of class 2 if and only if G/Z(G) is commutative—such a group is said
to be metabelian.
Example 6.11. (a) Nilpotent =⇒solvable, but not conversely. For example, for a ﬁeld k,
let
G =


.
Then Z(G) = {aI | a ̸= 0}, and the centre of G/Z(G) is trivial. Therefore G/Z(G) is not
nilpotent, but it is solvable.
(b) The group G =

G/Z(G) is commutative.
(c) Any nonabelian group G of order p3 is metabelian. In fact, G′ = Z(G), which has
order p (see 5.21).
(d) The quaternion and dihedral groups of order 8, Q and D4, are nilpotent of class 2.
More generally, D2n is nilpotent of class n—this can be proved by induction, using that
Z(D2n) has order 2, and D2n/Z(D2n) ≈D2n−1. If n is not a power of 2, then Dn is not
nilpotent (use Theorem 6.17).
Proposition 6.12. (a) A subgroup of a nilpotent group is nilpotent.
(b) A quotient of a nilpotent group is nilpotent.
Proof. (a) Let H be a subgroup of a nilpotent group G. Clearly, Z(H) ⊃Z(G)∩H. Assume
(inductively) that Zi(H) ⊃Zi(G) ∩H; then Zi+1(H) ⊃Zi+1(G) ∩H, because (for h ∈H)
h ∈Zi+1(G) =⇒[h, x] ∈Zi(G) all x ∈G =⇒[h, x] ∈Zi(H) all x ∈H.
(b) Straightforward.
Remark 6.13. It is worth noting that if H is a subgroup of G, then Z(H) may be bigger
than Z(G). For example
H =

Proposition 6.14. A group G is nilpotent of class ≤m ⇐⇒[...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm+1] = 1
for all g1, ..., gm+1 ∈G.
Proof. Recall, g ∈Zi(G) ⇐⇒[g, x] ∈Zi−1(G) for all x ∈G.
Assume G is nilpotent of class ≤m; then
G = Zm(G)
=⇒
[g1, g2] ∈Zm−1(G) all g1, g2 ∈G
=⇒
[[g1, g2], g3] ∈Zm−2(G) all g1, g2, g3 ∈G
· · · · · ·
=⇒
[· · · [[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm] ∈Z(G) all g1, . . . , gm ∈G
=⇒
[· · · [[g1, g2], g3], . . . , gm+1] = 1 all g1, . . . , gm ∈G.
For the converse, let g1 ∈G. Then
[...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm], gm+1] = 1 for all g1, g2, ..., gm+1 ∈G
=⇒
[...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm] ∈Z(G), for all g1, ..., gm ∈G
=⇒
[...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm−1] ∈Z1(G), for all g1, ..., gm−1 ∈G
=⇒
g1 ∈Zm(G) all g1 ∈G.
It is not true that an extension of nilpotent groups is nilpotent, i.e.,
N and G/N nilpotent ⇏G nilpotent.
For example, the subgroup N of the group G in (6.11) is commutative and G/N is commu-
tative, but G is not nilpotent. However, the implication holds when N is contained in the
centre of G
Corollary 6.15. Consider N ⊂Z(G); G/N nilpotent of class m =⇒G nilpotent of class
≤m + 1.
Proof. Write π for the map G →G/N. Then
π([...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm], gm+1]) = [...[[πg1, πg2], πg3], ..., πgm], πgm+1] = 1
all g1, ..., gm+1 ∈G. Hence [...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm], gm+1] ∈N ⊂Z(G), and so
[...[[g1, g2], g3], ..., gm+1], gm+2] = 1 all g1, ..., gm+2 ∈G.
Corollary 6.16. A ﬁnite p-group is nilpotent.
Proof. We use induction on the order of G. Then G/Z(G) nilpotent =⇒G nilpotent.
Theorem 6.17. A ﬁnite group is nilpotent if and only if it is equal to a product of its Sylow
subgroups.
Proof. A product of nilpotent groups is (obviously) nilpotent, and so the necessity follows
from the preceding corollary. Now assume that G is nilpotent. According to (5.10) it suﬃces
to prove that all Sylow subgroups are normal. Let P be such a subgroup of G, and let
N = NG(P). The ﬁrst lemma below shows that NG(N) = N, and the second then implies
that N = G, i.e., that P is normal in G.

GROUP THEORY
53
Lemma 6.18. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of a ﬁnite group G, and let N = NG(P). For
any subgroup H with NG(P) ⊂H ⊂G, we have NG(H) = H.
Proof. Let g ∈NG(H), so that gHg−1 = H. Then H ⊃gPg−1 = P ′, which is a Sylow
p-subgroup of H. By Sylow II, hP ′h−1 = P for some h ∈H, and so hgPg−1h−1 ⊂P. Hence
hg ∈N ⊂H, and g ∈H.
Lemma 6.19. Let H be proper subgroup of a ﬁnite nilpotent group G; then H ̸= NG(H).
Proof. The statement is obviously true for commutative groups, and so we can assume G
to be noncommutative.
We use induction on the order of G.
Because G is nilpotent,
Z(G) ̸= 1. Certainly the elements of Z(G) normalize H, and so if Z(G) ⊈H, we have
H ⫋Z(G) · H ⊂NG(H). Thus we may suppose Z(G) ⊂H. Then the normalizer of H in
G corresponds under (3.3) to the normalizer of H/Z(G) in G/Z(G), and we can apply the
induction hypothesis.
Remark 6.20. For a ﬁnite abelian group G we recover the fact that G is a product of its
p-primary subgroups.
The next result is beloved of QR examiners.
Proposition 6.21 (Frattini’s Argument). Let H be a normal subgroup of a ﬁnite group
G, and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Then G = H · NG(P).
Proof. Let g ∈G. Then gPg−1 ⊂gHg−1 = H, and both gPg−1 and P are Sylow p-subgroups
of H. According to Sylow II, there is an h ∈H such that gPg−1 = hPh−1, and it follows
that h−1g ∈NG(P) and so g ∈H · NG(P).
Theorem 6.22. A ﬁnite group is nilpotent if and only if every maximal subgroup is normal.
Proof. We saw in Lemma 6.19 that for any proper subgroup H of a nilpotent group G,
H ⫋NG(H). Hence, H maximal =⇒NG(H) = G, i.e., H is normal in G.
Conversely, suppose every maximal subgroup of G is normal. We shall verify the criterion
of Theorem 6.17. Thus, let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Suppose P is not normal in G,
and let H be a maximal subgroup of G containing NG(P). By hypothesis H is normal, and
so Frattini’s argument shows that G = H · NG(P) = H, which contradicts the deﬁnition of
H.
6.4. Groups with operators.
Recall that the set Aut(G) of automorphisms of a group G is again a group. If G is given
together with a homomorphism ϕ : A →Aut(G), then G is said to have A as a group of
operators. The pair (G, ϕ) is also called an A-group.
Write αx for ϕ(α)x. Then
(a) (αβ)x = α(βx);
(b) α(xy) = αx · αy;
(c) 1x = x.
Conversely, a map (α, x) →αx : A × G →G satisfying (a), (b), (c) arises from a homomor-
phism A →Aut(G)—conditions (a) and (c) show that x →αx is inverse to x →(α−1)x, and
so x →αx is a bijection G →G. Condition (b) then shows that it is an automorphism of
G. Finally, (a) shows that the map ϕ(α) = (x →αx) is a homomorphism A →Aut(G).

J.S. MILNE
Let G be a group with operators A. A subgroup H of G is admissible or an A-invariant
subgroup if x ∈H
=⇒
αx ∈H, all α ∈A.
An intersection of admissible groups is
admissible. If H is admissible, so also are NG(H) and CG(H).
An A-homomorphism (or admissible homomorphism) of A-groups is a homomorphism
ϕ : G →G′ such that ϕ(αg) = αϕ(g) for all α ∈A, g ∈G.
Example 6.23. (a) A group G can be regarded as a group with {1} as group of operators.
In this case all subgroups and homomorphisms are admissible, and we see that the theory
of groups with operators includes the theory of groups without operators.
(b) Consider G with G acting by conjugation, i.e., consider G together with g →ig : G →
Aut(G). In this case, the admissible subgroups are the normal subgroups.
(c) Consider G with A = Aut(G) as group of operators.
In this case, the admissible
subgroups are the characteristic subgroups.
Almost everything we have proved in this course for groups also holds for groups with
operators. In particular, the isomorphism theorems 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 hold for groups with
operators. In each case, the proof is the same as before except that admissibility must be
checked.
Theorem 6.24. (a) For any admissible homomorphism ϕ : G →G′ of A-groups, N =
Ker(ϕ) is an admissible normal subgroup of G, ϕ(G) is an admissible subgroup of G′, and
ϕ factors in a natural way into the composite of an admissible surjection, an admissible
isomorphism, and an admissible injection:
G ↠G/N
≈→ϕ(G) %→G′.
Theorem 6.25. Let G be a group with operators A, and let H and N be admissible subgroups
with N normal. Then H ∩N is normal admissible subgroup of H, HN is an admissible
subgroup of G, and h(H ∩N) →hH is an admissible isomorphism H/H ∩N →HN/N.
Theorem 6.26. Let ϕ : G →¯G be a surjective admissible homomorphism of A-groups.
Then under the one-to-one correspondence H ↔¯H between the set of subgroups of G con-
taining Ker(ϕ) and the set of subgroups of ¯G, admissible subgroups correspond to admissible
subgroups.
Let ϕ : A →Aut(G) be a group with A operating. An admissible normal series is a
sequence of admissible subgroups of G
G ⊃G1 ⊃G2 ⊃· · · ⊃Gr
with each Gi normal in Gi−1. Deﬁne similarly an admissible composition series. The quo-
tients of an admissible normal series are A-groups, and the quotients of an admissible com-
position series are simple A-groups, i.e., they have no normal admissible subgroups apart
from the obvious two.
The Jordan-H¨older theorem continues to hold for A-groups. In this case the isomorphisms
between the corresponding quotients of two composition series are admissible. The proof is
the same as that of the original theorem, because it uses only the isomorphism theorems,
which we have noted also hold for A-groups.

GROUP THEORY
55
Example 6.27. (a) Consider G with G acting by conjugation. In this case an admissible
normal series is a sequence of subgroups
G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃G2 ⊃· · · ⊃Gs = {1},
with each Gi normal in G. (This is what should be called a normal series.) The action of
G on Gi by conjugation passes to the quotient, to give an action of G on Gi/Gi+1. The
quotients of two admissible normal series are isomorphic as G-groups.
(b) Consider G with A = Aut(G) as operator group. In this case, an admisible normal
series is a sequence
G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃G2 ⊃· · · ⊃Gs = {1}
with each Gi a characteristic subgroup of G.
6.5. Krull-Schmidt theorem. A group G is indecomposable if G ̸= 1 and G is not iso-
morphic to a product of two nontrivial subgroups, i.e., if
G ≈H × H′ =⇒H = 1 or H′ = 1.
Example 6.28. (a) A simple group is indecomposable, but an indecomposable group need
not be simple: it may have a normal subgroup. For example, S3 is indecomposable but has
C3 as a normal subgroup.
(b) A ﬁnite abelian group is indecomposable if and only if it is cyclic of prime-power order.
Of course, this is obvious from the classiﬁcation, but it is not diﬃcult to prove it directly.
Let G be cyclic of order pn, and suppose that G ≈H×H′. Then H and H′ must be p-groups,
and they can’t both be killed by pm, m < n. It follows that one must be cyclic of order
pn, and that the other is trivial. Conversely, suppose that G is abelian and indecomposable.
Since every ﬁnite abelian group is (obviously) a product of p-groups with p running over the
primes, we can assume G itself is a p-group. If g is an element of G of highest order, one
shows that <g> is a direct factor of G: G ≈<g> ×H (see Rotman 4.5, 4.6, or Math 593).
(c) Every ﬁnite group can be written as a product of indecomposable groups (obviously).
Recall that when G1, G2, . . . , Gr are subgroups of G such that the map
(g1, g2, ..., gr) →g1g2 · · · gr : G1 × G2 × · · · × Gr →G
is an isomorphism, then we write G = G1 × G2 × · · · × Gr.
Theorem 6.29 (Krull-Schmidt). Let
G = G1 × · · · × Gs
and
G = H1 × · · · × Ht
be two decompositions of G into products of indecomposable subgroups. Then s = t, and
there is a re-indexing such that Gi ≈Hi. Moreover, given r, we can arrange the numbering
so that
G = G1 × · · · × Gr × Hr+1 × · · · × Ht.
Example 6.30. Let G = Fp × Fp, and think of it as a two-dimensional vector space over
Fp. Let
G1 =<(1, 0)>,
G2 =<(0, 1)>;
H1 =<(1, 1)>,
H2 =<(1, −1)> .
Then G = G1 × G2, G = H1 × H2, G = G1 × H2.

Consider G with G acting by conjugation.
Then an admissible subgroup is a normal
subgroup, and a G-endomorphism α : G →G is an endomorphism such that α(gxg−1) =
gα(x)g−1 all g, x ∈G.
Such an endomorphism is called a normal endomorphism.
A
composite of normal endomorphisms is normal; the image of an admissible (i.e., normal)
subgroup under a normal endomorphism is admissible (i.e., normal).
[[The rest of the notes are unreliable.]]
Let α be an endomorphism of a group G; then we have a descending sequence of subgroups
G ⊃α(G) ⊃α2(G) ⊃· · · .
If G is ﬁnite it must become stationary. The endomorphism α is said to be nilpotent if
αk(G) = 1 for some k. Note that if G is ﬁnite and G = α(G), then α is an automorphism.
Lemma 6.31 (Fitting). Let G be a ﬁnite group and α a normal endomorphism. Choose k
so that αk(G) = αk+1(G) = · · · , and let G1 = Ker(αk) and G2 = αk(G). Then G = G1 ×G2;
moreover, α|G1 is nilpotent, and α|G2 is an automorphism.
Proof. The ﬁnal part of the statement is obvious from the above remarks. Therefore g ∈
G1 ∩G2 =⇒g = 1 (else αk(g) is never 1, and equals 1). Let g ∈G. Then αk(g) ∈G2 =
αk+1G = · · · , and so αk(g) = α2k(x) for some x ∈G. Note that αk(g · αk(x−1)) = 1, and
so g · αk(x−1) ∈G1 : we conclude g = (g · αk(g−1)) · αk(g) ∈G1G2. Finally G1 and G2 are
normal by the above remark, and now (3.6) implies that G = G1 × G2.
Lemma 6.32. A normal endomorphism of an indecomposable ﬁnite group is either an au-
tomorphism or is nilpotent.
Proof. In the preceding lemma, either G = G1 or G2.
For endomorphisms α and β of a group G, deﬁne α + β by
(α + β)(x) = α(x)β(x).
Note: α + β need not be an endomorphism.
Lemma 6.33. If α and β are normal nilpotent endomorphisms of a ﬁnite indecomposable
group, and α + β is an endomorphism, then α + β is a normal nilpotent endomorphism.
Proof. It is obvious that α + β is normal. If it is an automorphism, then there exists a γ
such that (α + β) ◦γ = id. Set α′ = αγ and β′ = βγ. Then α′ + β′ = id, i.e.,
α′(x−1)β′(x−1) = x−1 =⇒β′(x)α′(x) = x = α′(x)β′(x) =⇒α′β′ = β′α′.
Hence α′ + β′ = β′ + α′. Therefore the subring of End(G) generated by α′ and β′ is commu-
tative. Because α and β are nilpotent, so also are α′ and β′. Hence
(α′ + β′)m = α′m +

Proof. of Krull-Schmidt. Suppose G = G1 × G2 × · · · × Gs and G = H1 × H2 × · · · × Ht.
Write

H1 × H2 × · · · × Ht.
Consider π1ι′
1π′
1ι1 + π1ι′
2π′
2ι1 + · · · = idG1. Not all terms in the sum are nilpotent, and so,
after possibly renumbering the groups, we may suppose that the ﬁrst is an automorphism,
say α = π1ι′
1π′
1ι1 = γ−1. Thus (omitting subscripts)
(G1
γ→G1
ι→G
π′→H1
ι′→G
π→G1) = idG1 .
Consider
(H1
ι′→G
π→G1
γ→G1
ι→G π′→H1) = θ.
Check θ◦θ = θ (use above factorization of idG1), and so θ = id or 0. The second is impossible,
because θ occurs in idG1 ◦idG1. Therefore, θ = idH1. Hence π1ι′
1 and π′
1ι1 are isomorphisms.
On the other hand, π′
1(H2 × · · · ) = 1, but π′
1ι1 =? is injective on G1. We conclude that
G1 ∩(H2 × ... × Ht) = 1. Hence G1(H2 × · · · ) ≈G1 × (H2 × · · · ), and by counting, we see
that G = G1 × H2 × · · · .
Repeat the argument.
Remark 6.34. (a) The Krull-Schmidt theorem holds also for an inﬁnite group provided it
satisﬁes both chain conditions on subgroups, i.e., ascending and descending sequences of
subgroups of G become stationary. (See Rotman 6.33.)
(b) The Krull-Schmidt theorem also holds for groups with operators. For example, let
Aut(G) operate on G; then the subgroups in the statement of the theorem will all be char-
acteristic.
(c) When applied to a ﬁnite abelian group, the theorem shows that the groups Cmi in
a decomposition G = Cm1 × ... × Cmr are uniquely determined up to isomorphism (and
ordering).
