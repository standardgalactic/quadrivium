CORSAIR Releases HS50 Headset
CORSAIR has a new gaming headset out in time for the 
holiday buying season. The new HS50 Stereo Gaming 
Headset features plush over-the-ear cans and a Discord-
certified detachable microphone. The HS50 is contructed 
of aluminum and is available in black with three accent 
color options: black, blue, and green. The accent coloring 
is very subtle and appears in a ring on each can and in a 
stitching pattern that appears on the headband. The sound 
is produced by 50mm neodymium drivers that CORSAIR 
says are “specially tuned” to create high-quality, accurate 
audio. The memory foam earcups and the wide headband 
are designed to provide comfort during long-term gaming 
sessions. The HS50 uses a universal 3.5mm connector for 
console and mobile gamers and the headset comes with 
a Y-cable adapter for use on a PC. MSRP for the gaming 
headset is $49.99. The HS50 can be purchased directly from 
the CORSAIR website as well as from various retailers.
GIGABYTE Targets SFF Builders With 
Mini-ITX Z370N WIFI Motherboard
GIGABYTE has a new Mini-ITX motherboard that comes 
with an LGA1151 socket and Intel’s Z370 chipset. The small 
board measures just 170mm x 170mm, but still supports the 
latest Intel 8th Generation Core processors as well as up to 
32GB of DDR4 at frequencies as high as 4,400MHz (O.C.) 
in its two DIMM slots. As its name suggests, the Z370N 
WIFI also is ready for wireless connectivity, as it supports 
Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, including support for 2.4/5GHz 
Dual-Band. The motherboard also has two Intel GbE LAN 
chips for fast wired connections. For expansion, the Z370N 
WIFI has one PCIe x16 slot. The board also has two M.2 
connectors (one on the back side of the board) and four 
SATA 6Gbps connectors, and it supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 
10. The new GIGABYTE Z370N WIFI motherboard is 
available at retailers now for around $160.

EKWB Launches Modular “Pick 
Your Parts” Cooling Loop Lineup
EK Water Blocks announced a new line of cooling products 
called MLC Phoenix that lets users pick and choose the 
components for an AIO cooling loop kit. You select from a  
lengthy lineup of radiators, full-cover GPU waterblocks, and 
CPU waterblocks. The radiators come with pumps and fans. 
The MLC parts list is extensive, so you can find waterblocks 
for particular makes and models of graphics cards and CPU 
sockets. All parts are prefilled with liquid and have QDC 
(quick disconnect) connectors, so in essence you can build an 
AIO kit that’s perfectly matched for the components in your 
system. If you want to expand your system later on to include 
more graphics cards or larger radiators, you simply order the 
parts you need and swap them in/out. The QDC connections 
make it easy to adjust your loop at any time. EKWB says 
most MLC blocks are available in two versions (Nickel Acetal 
or Nickel Plexi) with copper bases. EKWB is now accepting 
pre-orders for MLC Phoenix parts on its site. 
Razer Expands Its Mobile Gaming 
Reach With The New Razer Phone
Razer already makes notebooks aimed at gamers, but the 
company is going after a larger mobile market with the 
launch of its first phone. The new device runs on Android 
Nougat and is called . . . Razer Phone. The phone is clearly 
focused on entertainment, as Razer loaded it with high-end 
hardware for better audio and video. The device is powered by 
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 8GB of memory. 
The 5.72-inch display is Quad HD and a technology called 
UltraMotion syncs it with the GPU to automatically adjust 
the refresh rate up to 120Hz. Dolby Atmos technology 
powers the audio, and the USB-C audio adapter and 24-bit 
DAC are THX-certified. Other goodies include dual 12MP 
cameras with lenses that focus from f1.7 wide angle to 2X 
telephoto. Razer Game Booster software lets users maximize 
gaming performance, and a big 4,000mAh battery provides 
extended gametime. MSRP for the Razer Phone is $699.99.
FSP Loads Up On Tempered Glass 
Panels, RGB Lights For New CMT510 
FSP has unveiled a new computer case called the CMT510. The 
roomy mid-tower chassis features lots of glass and lighting and 
is aimed at gamers and builders using high-end components. 
The CMT510 has full tempered-glass panels on both sides as 
well as the front that are 50% translucent. The dark panels 
go with an interior that is also dark, as FSP has covered all 
the surfaces of the case with a black coating. The company 
says the dark surfaces help accentuate the LED lighting in 
the four preinstalled 120mm RGB fans (three intake fans in 
front, and one exhaust fan in back). The spacious chassis can 
handle graphics cards up to 400mm long and CPU coolers up 
to 165mm tall. It also supports ATX motherboards. FSP says 
the front of the chassis can hold radiators up to 360mm. The 
MSRP for the new CMT510 is $99.99.

HARDWARE MOLE
Lian Li Announces Alpha Case Series 
Lian Li has two new cases called the Alpha 330 and the Alpha 
550 RGB. Both models feature a similar interior layout and lots 
of tempered glass. The 330 features two 4mm glass panels, one 
on the front and one on the left side. Behind the glass of the front 
panel is a decorative lattice-style grille. There’s room up front to 
show off radiators up to 420mm, and a PSU shroud runs along 
the bottom of the chassis. The Alpha 550 RGB adds RGB fans 
and more glass to the mix. This case has four glass panels (front, 
top, and both sides). The lattice grille is found on both the front 
and top of this chassis, and the case comes with three of Lian 
Li’s Bora 120mm RGB fans preinstalled in front, along with an 
additional RGB strip. As with the 330, the 550 RGB includes 
a PSU shroud. Both cases offer extensive cable management 
throughout the interior in keeping with Lian Li’s “clean build” 
theme. The two new Alpha models are available in either white or 
black. The Alpha 330 carries an MSRP of $109, while the Alpha 
550 RGB has an MSRP of $179. 
Get Ready For Faster Data Transfers
PCI-SIG, the group that guides the evolution of the PCI bus 
expansion standard, has officially released the specifications for 
PCIe 4.0, version 1.0. The new standard provides for 16GTps 
data rates, effectively doubling the speed over PCIe 3.0. The 
increase in bandwidth opens the door for faster devices and 
greater connectivity options, as fewer PCIe lanes will be 
needed in some operations. The release announcement for the 
new standard was made in a blog post by PCI-SIG President 
Al Yanes and comes nearly seven years after the official 
release of PCIe 3.0. Yanes said there are other improvements 
provided by the new standard as well, such as reduced system 
latency and better I/O virtualization. Power users also will be 
pleased by something else Yanes mentioned in his post: Work 
continues on the PCIe 5.0 specification (32GTps), which the 
group is targeting for release in Q2 of 2019. 
G.SKILL Trident Z Kit Sets Record
The battle over who has the world’s fastest 32GB kit 
of dual-channel memory continues. G.SKILL is now 
claiming the crown, saying its latest DDR4 Trident Z kit 
of four 8GB modules has set a world record at 4,400MHz. 
The 32GB Trident Z kit achieved the record on an ASUS 
ROG MAXIMUS X HERO (WI-FI AC) motherboard 
that used an Intel Core i7-8700 processor. The timings for 
the memory were CL19-19-19-39 at 1.5V. G.SKILL says 
each of its new Trident Z modules rely on Samsung B-die 
DDR4 IC chips that are “rigorously tested and binned’ 
to ensure they meet the highest standards. The new kits 
support Intel’s XMP 2.0 profile for fast overclocking, but 
G.SKILL says they also are ready for overclockers who 
want to manually tweak all settings. G.SKILL has not yet 
announced pricing or availability for the new kits.

Mozilla Releases Quantum, The 
Brand-New Browser AKA Firefox 57
Mozilla has released Quantum, the browser also known as 
Firefox version 57. Quantum represents a major reworking 
of Firefox (the folks at Mozilla even refer to it as “the new 
Firefox), and it took a full year to finish the project. Mozilla 
says more than 4.8 million lines of code were added to the 
new version while it was being developed and more than 
6.8 million other lines were changed. More than 700 people 
provided code for Quantum. During testing, programmers 
fixed 1,190 software bugs that affected user experience and 
369 that affected performance. The end result is a browser 
that now runs about twice as fast as the previous version. 
Quantum also is more efficient. Mozilla says its tests show 
the new browser uses fewer resources than other popular 
browsers (for example, about 1/3 as much RAM as Chrome). 
See www.mozilla.org for details and to download Quantum.
Up, Up & Away For Digital Currency, 
As Bitcoin Price Surges Over $9,000 
There’s a story often told about how the first Bitcoin purchase 
online involved someone buying a pizza for 10,000 coins; years 
later those Bitcoins would be worth a few million dollars. Take a 
big gulp: that same amount of Bitcoin on Nov. 27 would have 
been worth more than $97 million. That’s right: the price of a 
single Bitcoin leapt past the $9,000 threshold the weekend after 
Black Friday, and it was heading toward $10,000 as we went to 
press. The news about excellent online sales at the traditional 
start of the holiday shopping period was one explanation 
pundits were giving for the big price jump, but Bitcoin in 
general has increased rapidly in value during 2017. At the start 
of the year, Bitcoin was valued at about $1,000. There’s no 
telling whether the trend will continue, and some people think 
all digital currencies are currently caught in a speculative bubble. 
So caveat emptor if you’re thinking of buying (but if you do buy 
and make a gazillion dollars, remember your friends at CPU). 
SOFTWARE SHORTS
‘Tis The Season For Giving; Now 
There’s An App That Makes It Easier 
A new mobile payment app called “CoinUp” aims to do some 
good in the world and make a profit at the same time. The 
app works with your current credit or debit cards as well as 
with mobile apps such as Venmo and PayPal. When you make 
a purchase, the app will round up the amount to the nearest 
dollar, and then it uses bank-approved encryption to pay the 
“virtual change” to the charitable cause that you designate. 
You can track how your extra change adds up over the month 
in the app’s dashboard, and you can switch your target charity 
monthly or stop making donations at any time. CoinApp makes 
its money by taking a small amount (15%) off your donations, 
which the company says is less than the average processing fee 
for fundraising. You can learn more at www.coinupapp.com.

Trive Is A Browser Plug-In That 
Wants To Help You Spot Fake News  
“Fake news” and “digital currency” seem to be two of the 
hottest topics in the news recently. Now there’s a startup 
whose business model depends on both subjects. Trive is a 
company with an eponymous browser add-in that calls itself 
a “social science consensus engine.” The company plans to 
use the wisdom of the crowds, combined with a blockchain-
based rewards system, to help users discern what’s real 
and fake online. The company has created a research and 
verification process that pays people to identify “fake” vs. “real” 
information. It uses this data to prevent fake news from leading 
you astray. Trive says the cost to users to avoid fake news stories 
will be about $1/month, and there’s also the opportunity to 
earn money as part of the verification ecosystem. Whether the 
concept will work or not is anyone’s guess, but you can research 
the ideas behind the business model at www.trive.news.
Season Is Green For Online Retailers
A recent Gallup survey of American adults that asked about their 
holiday shopping plans bodes well for online retailers. The survey 
asked more than 1,000 people which retail channels (department 
stores, discount stores, specialty stores, mail-order catalogs, and 
online shopping) they were planning to use during the 2017 
holiday season. While department stores were mentioned most 
often (by 72% of survey participants), that was down from 
74% in 2013. Online shopping tied with discount stores for 
second place with 65%, while specialty stores were at 52%. Mail-
order catalogs were in last place with 22%. The results showed 
all channels have declined in recent years, with one glaring 
exception: online shopping. In fact, online shopping is the only 
retail channel that has increased in each of the periodic holiday 
shopping polls Gallup has taken since 1998, rising more than 
sixfold from 10% that year. If current trends continue, online 
shopping may become more popular than department store 
shopping by the 2019 holiday shopping season.
SITE SEEING
Hotwire’s Seasonal Promotion Will 
Help You Get Away For The Holidays 
Hotwire, the discount travel site that is a subsidiary of travel giant 
Expedia, is offering folks on a budget who are weary of holiday 
revelry the chance to get away for some R&R in the sleeply little 
town of . . . Las Vegas. The company is running a special “Million 
Dollar Sale” that offers travelers the chance to stay in 5-star Las 
Vegas hotels from Dec. 8 - 28 for only $50/night. According to 
Hotwire, the average retail rate during the month for rooms at 
5-star resorts in Las Vegas is $432, which means vacationers who 
book now could save more than $350 each day during their stay. 
Hotwire pays the difference in room price, until the $1 million 
is gone or the promotion is over. (One note: Vegas hotel rates 
fluctuate wildly during the year, so whether you would have paid 
the full retail price to begin with is unknown.)

Millennials Buy 
Stuff Online. Duh.
eMarketer’s “U.S. Ecommerce 
Performance Statpack 2017” is a 
compilation of research on what 
Americans are doing on the Internet. 
As part of its study, eMarketer looked 
at a group it calls Digital Buyers. 
These are people who have made 
at least one online purchase using a 
smartphone, tablet, or computer during 
the current year. eMarketer found that older millennials (ages 25 to 34) are the age bracket with the most 
online purchasers. When combined with their younger brethren, the total number of millennials (ages 18 
to 34) who have made online purchases in the past year is 63 million. This surpasses the 61.6 million total 
Generation X’ers (35 - 54) and 49.9 million Baby Boomers and older (55+) who are digital buyers.

To Build, 
Or Not To Build 
AVADirect’s Shannon Robb On The Benefits 
Of Buying vs. Building
Advertisement
A: 
AVADirect offers all customers 
lifetime troubleshooting and 
technical support. This is via live chat, 
email, or phone. We are all in the same 
facility, so you know you’re getting 
someone who is directly connected 
to our team and ready to help if you 
have issues with your PC, even beyond 
your warranty period. Lifetime truly 
means lifetime—if you have an issue 
or question, we are here to support 
you and help troubleshoot or clarify 
specific things as needed.
Q
: What other kinds of things 
do people tend to take for 
granted or not even think of when 
considering buying vs. building 
that makes a pre-built system a 
good idea?
A: 
This kind of touches on what I 
said before. I think the biggest 
thing is that you can plug in and go 
without it being a generic, off-the-shelf 
build. Time is number one to me . . . 
that and cable management, which is 
the bane of my existence on my own 
builds as I get to the end and want to 
see it run. Trying to manage all of the 
cables is enough to drive me insane, 
and I’m quite sure that I am not the 
only one on this.
Q
: One of the things that we’ve 
heard from lots of DIY guys is 
that they don’t like getting systems 
packed with a bunch of software they 
didn’t install and don’t want, and 
having their systems bark at them 
if you have issues with your PC. And if 
the issue is not easily remedied under 
standard troubleshooting, you just ship 
it in under warranty, and we help to 
get it up and going again.
Q
: Is it fair to say that people often 
underestimate the value of getting 
tech support and warranty service when 
weighing the option to purchase a PC?
A: 
Yes, I would say that’s a more 
than fair statement. Many simply 
see the final cost, which they then 
compare to cost of the parts alone, and 
they do not account or even measure 
what their time is worth. Time testing, 
time building, time troubleshooting—
all of this can be measured, and 
I believe if more took that into 
consideration it would make sense.
Q
: What kind of service does 
AVADirect offer for warranty repairs?
A: 
AVADirect offers full warranty 
support including replacing every 
part needed to get your system running 
as well as it did the day we shipped it. 
If any part fails, we do not waste time, 
we simply replace it to ensure the best 
performance from your system. Also, 
even if out of warranty, we offer repair 
services with a very small fee for labor 
to get your system up and running 
or even upgraded if you choose at 
that point.
Q
: What exactly comes with AVADirect’s 
Lifetime Technical Support?
Q
: Hey, Shannon, it’s been a while! 
AVADirect recently moved to a new 
HQ, correct? How are you guys liking 
the new digs?
A: 
It’s really an awesome opportunity 
to stretch our legs a bit and start 
doing some new projects. This new 
facility truly can handle the workload 
that we have; it’s three times the size 
of our old facility, possibly four, and 
it’s awesome to see after being at 
AVADirect for only a year that we 
are already accomplishing some long-
term goals we had for the direction 
of the company and what we wanted 
to accomplish.
Q
: You’ve been on both the DIY 
and pre-built PC sides of the 
business now. Given that perspective, 
what would you say is the single 
biggest benefit of buying a pre-
built system vs. building your own 
DIY rig?
A: 
I would say the ease it adds to 
the process. Simply put, if 
you build a PC yourself, you must 
allocate the parts and you must test 
them and run the risk of whether they 
work or not. Then let’s say a part is 
bad. You have to deal with RMA and 
replacement or having more parts on 
hand to test. AVADirect does all of 
that so that you get a PC that starts 
the first time, every time. And let’s 
say down the road a part fails; we have 
free lifetime technical support, which 
means we are always here to help you

t a b l e  f r o m  o u r 
friends at AMD for 
these chips. But we 
always push for as much performance 
as possible when customers request 
overclocks.
Q
: Does AVADirect have any 
customers who used to be hard-
core DIY guys, and if so, what 
brought them around?
A: 
We have had many customers 
who have stated they used to 
build all their own systems, but the 
time investment for them simply didn’t 
pan out anymore and they wanted 
something that just showed up and 
worked. That’s not to say this applies 
to every case, as everyone has different 
needs or wants. But as we grow and 
show what we can do more and more, 
I believe everyone will see that we will 
build it the same way they would, 
and with the same level of care and 
attention to detail, but with the added 
benefit of experience from a host of 
previous builds. ■
the kinds of custom work customers can 
order from AVADirect?
A: 
This is a tough one to define as 
we have gone as far as cutting 
cases to fit things, custom paint jobs, 
custom hard-tube liquid cooling, and 
even custom-soldered LED strips to 
exactly fit your build. I had a phrase 
I used recently which was “You 
Dream It, We Build It.” I think that’s 
a fair statement as to how we feel 
about custom builds. We are willing 
to consider anything a customer 
would like.
Q
: What kind of options are available 
for overclocking and custom cooling?
A: 
Now you’re talking my language! 
If you remember last year when 
we spoke, this was one of the sole 
things I had come here for, and while 
my role has changed significantly, I 
am still deeply involved in this. As 
trying to get them to register and 
pay for free trial software. What’s 
AVADirect’s stance on pre-loading 
stuff like that onto systems you sell?
A: 
It can be summed up in one 
word—NEVER. AVADirect 
believes that all users deserve as clean 
of an OS as possible with as little bloat 
as possible. We even avoid installing 
some of the bloated apps that come 
with hardware if not necessary, giving 
that option to the user (we send all 
included software discs/manuals with 
the system) so that they get a clean-
running machine without resource-
wasting or annoying apps that will just 
slow down their rig or have potential 
annoying pop-ups.
Q
: AVADirect offers some fairly 
extensive personalization options, as 
well, right? So guys who want to avoid a 
plain-Jane, stock-looking PC don’t need 
to worry about that? Can you talk about

Ear Candy 
Gaming Headset Roundup
when it comes to delivering a great 
listening experience. The MixAmp Pro 
($129.99), which supports a wider 
frequency response than the headset, is 
a must-have for those who enjoy a lot 
of multiplayer gaming. It lets you turn 
a volume dial to find the perfect mix 
between game sounds and voice chat, 
and adds push-button access to Dolby 
7.1 surround effects and up to four 
customizable EQ presets. Streamers can 
also use the MixAmp Pro to take more 
control over what their audience hears. 
The ASTRO Command Center is also an 
easy-to-use and highly functional utility.
Although it’s not a feature everyone 
will use, we like that you can move 
the mic to the other can. Removing 
the Speaker Tags effectively makes this 
headset an open-back design, which lets 
in a decent amount of exterior sound. The 
comfort level of the A40 was as good as 
any other headset we tested, even though 
the ear cushions are wide enough that 
they rest on your ears. Weighing in at 
12 ounces, the A40 is one of the heavier 
headsets we tested, which may become a 
factor after a few hours of extended use. 
The ASTRO A40 is solid compared 
to the best performers in this roundup 
W
hen shopping for a PC gaming 
headset, many gamers—unable 
to try out multiple headsets before 
making a purchase—simply opt for a 
known brand. That’s all well and good 
if your biggest priorities have more to 
do with RGB LEDs, driver diameters, 
and accent colors. If you’re more 
concerned with a headset’s comfort 
level, sound reproduction capabilities, 
and convenience features, then we’re 
here to bridge the gap between what’s 
listed in the device’s specs sheet and 
what you’ll actually experience when 
you put the headset on and hit play or 
start gaming. Now’s a great time to start 
pampering your ears. 
Astro A40 TR & MixAmp Pro TR
ASTRO’s headset is in the same 
budget-crushing neighborhood as the 
Sennheiser PC 3783D, but there’s some 
added value here that you just won’t get 
with any other headset in this roundup.
Regarding build materials, the A40 
TR (Tournament Ready) consists of a 
split plastic headband with a removable 
padded insert slotted in the middle. 
The cans pivot on black plastic frames, 
which are connected to the headband via 
aluminum cylinders. Headset adjustments 
can be made via sliding either side (or 
both), making the A40 a perfect fit for 
virtually anyone. The headset ships with a 
pair of soft, breathable fabric can cushions 
and the headband pad is made of the 
same material. ASTRO was kind enough 
to send us a green Mod Kit ($59.99), 
which swaps the can and headband 
cushions for noise-isolating leatherette 
pads and includes a pair of closed-
back Speaker Tags and a voice-isolating 
mic. They add a nice splash of color, 
but Astro’s Mod Kits are an expensive 
addition to an already pricey audio setup.

The ASTRO A40 is a little behind 
the HyperX Cloud Alpha and Razer 
Kraken 7.1 in terms of raw audio 
chops, but the MixAmp Pro bundle 
makes a compelling argument in its 
favor for multiplayer gamers and 
frequent streamers. 
Corsair VOID PRO RGB Wireless
A few months ago, we reviewed the 
VOID PRO Surround, but for this 
roundup, we got in the similar-sounding, 
but significantly less tied-down VOID 
PRO RGB Wireless. This headset is a 
2.4GHz wireless unit that features a 
built-in battery with an impressive 16-
hour play time, 40 feet of wireless range, 
and an RGB LED under the Corsair 
logo on the cans. 
Unlike the VOID PRO Surround, 
this model only works with the USB 
dongle, so you’re limited to PC or laptop 
use. Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround 
sound is supported, and you can tap 
into the CUE (Corsair Utility Engine) 
software to cycle between virtual 7.1 or 
5.1 surround sound output, or switch 
to stereo output, regardless of whether 
you’re listening to music, watching 
streaming video, or playing games. 
This headset features custom-tuned 
50mm neodymium magnet drivers, 
which delivered a rich and full sound 
experience regardless of what we were 
listening to. The unidirectional noise-
cancelling microphone on this unit 
delivers a similar high-quality experience, 
with its wide 50Hz to 18kHz frequency 
response and-38dB (+/-3dB) sensitivity. 
The VOID PRO RGB Wireless also 
supports Sidetone Control, which 
lets you hear your voice through the 
headphones to keep you from shouting 
unnecessarily, becoming the heavy 
breather, or obliviously munching chips 
into the mic. [ED NOTE: What are you 
trying to say, Andrew?]
The unit is composed of a plastic 
adjustable headband, with anodized 
black aluminum brackets between the 
headband and the cans, letting them 
swivel and rotate for a perfect fit or easy 
travel. Despite the necessity of a battery,

V2; however, the boom isn’t flexible 
enough to let you make adjustments to 
the mic’s distance from your mouth. We 
recommend just retracting it when you 
don’t need to talk with your teammates. 
The sound quality with the IMMERSA 
PRO was decidedly middle-of-the-
road compared to many of the headsets 
here. The 50mm drivers were capable 
of pushing out some powerful audio, 
works in its favor during extended 
gaming sessions.
The headset has a pair of knurled 
aluminum dials on each can; the dial on 
the right can controls the volume and 
the one on the left mutes and unmutes 
the mic, with an LED indicator to show 
you the current setting at a glance. The 
mic on the IMMERSA PRO is very 
similar to that of Razer’s Kraken 7.1 
the headset feels remarkably balanced and 
light. Like The Logitech G933 Artemis 
Spectrum, the VOID PRO RGB Wireless 
also has a battery-conserving automatic 
shutdown feature, which engages after 10 
minutes of inactivity. 
The VOID PRO RGB Wireless, like 
the previous VOID PRO we tested, is 
one of the more comfortable headsets 
we’ve used. Despite the presence of a 
sizeable battery, the headset’s weight is 
evenly distributed across the microfiber 
mesh headband and soft mesh-covered 
memory foam can cushions. Those 
cushions are also large enough that 
they’re not resting on any sensitive 
portions of your ears. As a result, the 
headset stays put and feels great, even 
after hours of nonstop gaming. 
With this headset, Corsair set out 
to take everything we love about the 
VOID PRO and make it wireless. The 
end result is a headset that affords more 
freedom of movement, without making 
compromises in sound quality. 
COUGAR IMMERSA PRO 7.1
The COUGAR IMMERSA PRO is 
a headset that has some unique features 
that make it stand out. It’s a 7.1 surround 
sound-capable headset that relies on a 
USB connector for use on a PC or laptop, 
but also comes with a 4-pole 3.5mm 
adapter, which lets you use it on consoles, 
phones, and more. 
The unique look of the headset is 
highlighted by a pair of flexible orange 
rods that make up the headband 
frame. There’s a pleather-covered pad 
that spans the rods to provide a little 
support at the top of your head, but the 
real reason this headset sits so firmly 
where you want is down to the stiff rods 
and thick ear cushions. These pads are 
large and round, but the inner portion 
that rests against your ears is oval-
shaped. The foam under the pleather 
cushion covers is considerably stiffer 
than that of the Razer and HyperX 
headsets, so the IMMERSA PRO’s 
comfort factor, while decent, just wasn’t 
in the same league. The headset was one 
of the lighter models we tested, which

but their frequency response range was 
disappointingly narrow considering the 
IMMERSA PRO’s price point. 
The aggressive styling and versatility 
are the two strongest features of the 
IMMERSA PRO, but sound quality 
and comfort appear to have been lesser 
priorities for COUGAR. 
Kingston HyperX Cloud Alpha
We’ve not been shy about our fondness 
for Kingston’s HyperX-branded Cloud 
headsets. The Cloud II is still a mainstay 
of our personal gaming setup due to its 
solid sound performance and comfortable 
fit. The Cloud Stinger shed some extra 
weight and dropped the price, but still 
offers a great-sounding experience and 
a high degree of comfort. In the Cloud 
Alpha, we’re getting a substantial upgrade 
in both categories. 
But let’s get the style part out of the 
way first. The headset is composed of 
black plastic with a matte finish that 
feels rubberized to the touch. The back 
of each can is an aluminum disk, and 
the hinged fork that holds the headband 
to the cans is a thick bent piece of red 
anodized aluminum. The black headband 
is thickly padded and highlighted on 
the edges with red stitching. The Cloud 
Alpha’s ear pads and headband pad are 
covered with a pleather material that’s 
just as soft as that of the Razer Kraken 
7.1 V2. The ear pad foam is definitely 
on the softer side, as well, making this 
headset very comfortable to wear 
for extended periods. Gamers who 
wear glasses will also likely favor this 
headset’s light touch.
The lone neodymium magnet driver 
inside each can is 50mm in diameter, 
but Kingston has engineered a dual-
chamber design that allows the mid-range 
and high-end frequencies to reverberate 
separately from the low-frequency sound 
waves. In practice, this feature manifests 
as a more nuanced audio experience, 
whether we were playing games, listening 
to music or streaming video. The wide 
frequency response of these drivers also 
hammers home this headset’s premium 
listening experience.

away. The headset folds flat and the 
wireless USB dongle nests inside one 
of the can flaps, making the G933 easy 
to travel with. This headset is also one 
of the heavier units we tested, though 
this didn’t really cause a problem for us 
when gaming for extended periods. 
Because you can use it wired or 
wirelessly, the G933 Artemis Spectrum 
works with PCs, laptops, and consoles. 
You can also charge the battery without 
missing a beat in your game, just by 
plugging in the mini USB charging 
cable. Conveniently, the headset will go 
into sleep mode after not receiving an 
audio signal for five minutes, making 
sure you don’t sit down to game, only 
to find the headset battery drained; it’ll 
take 3.5 hours to fully recharge. 
Logitech’s G933 Artemis Spectrum 
is definitely one of the more expensive 
headsets out there, and its sound quality, 
although stellar, is not in the same 
league as the Sennheiser, HyperX, or 
Razer headsets. That being said, however, 
the versatility, unique design, and 
comfortable fit of this headset make it 
a worthy choice for those intent on a 
wireless headset. 
Patriot Viper V370 7.1 
Virtual Surround Gaming Headset
We reviewed the Patriot Viper 
V370 headset earlier this year, but as 
we went to press, you could find it for 
significantly less than the headset’s initial 
MSRP. The Viper V370 is a 7.1 virtual 
surround sound model that integrates 
a volume dial and UBR (Ultra Bass 
Response) switch into the left can. The 
unit also features an omnidirectional 
mic that folds inconspicuously into 
the headset when you don’t need it. 
Compared to the original Viper headsets, 
this one relocates the Viper logo to the 
cans and incorporates an RGB LED light 
to frame it. This unit also has a wider 
adjustable headband. This headset has a 
matte-black finish that feels rubberized 
and silver and red accents that extend 
to the 7-foot braided nylon cord. Metal-
mesh grilles on each can also add to the 
headset’s visual appeal. 
hours with the RGB LED effects on, and 
12 hours with the LEDs off. The LEDs 
generally look good, but we noticed that 
red looks decidedly pink when filtered 
through the frosted-plastic G logo. 
The headset is composed primarily 
of plastic. We like the look and feel of 
the chromed gray forks, but they are 
fingerprint magnets. The headset can 
cushions are removable, washable, and 
designed to fully envelop your ears 
without applying pressure to any portion 
of the lobes. Although this makes the 
G933 comfortable for extended use, we 
do wish the fabric Logitech chose was a 
little softer to the touch. 
The left can features a number of 
buttons and dials, for controlling 
volume, turning the headset on and 
off, and launching one of three G-Key-
based shortcuts. The mic boom folds 
down from the left can and a flexible 
tip extends. There’s an LED on the 
mic to indicate the mute status, and 
it mutes automatically when tucked 
Extras like a detachable mic with a 
highly flexible boom, in-line volume 
dial and mute switch, and braided black 
nylon cords make this a stereo headset 
feel as first-rate as it sounds. Hands 
down, this headset was our favorite of 
the bunch. 
Logitech G933 
Artemis Spectrum Snow
Logitech has been a mainstay of gam-
ing headsets long enough that we 
shouldn’t be surprised to find its G933 
Artemis Spectrum to be one of the most 
feature-rich headsets available. There are 
three versions of the Artemis Spectrum; 
we tested the white “Snow” edition. This 
was one of two wireless headsets in this 
roundup, but we experienced zero lag 
or latency resulting from either headset’s 
lack of wires. This headset uses a 2.4GHz 
radio, and there was no perceptible 
difference when using this headset with 
and without the wires (yes, you have 
the option). Battery life is a solid eight

including raw performance and long-
lasting comfort. 
Rosewill Nebula GX10 
Stereo Gaming Headset
We took the entry-level Rosewill Nebula 
GX10 for a spin a couple of months ago, 
and came away impressed with both its 
performance and price point. This is a stereo 
headset with large over-the-ear cans. Each 
one is attached to the foam padded headband 
by a rigid doubled-up wire that lets each can 
slide independently to fit virtually any-sized 
melon. There’s an N logo on the center of 
each can, but a large mesh circle lights up 
with diffuse blue light when you connect 
the optional USB plug. The cans are padded 
with a soft blue foam and covered in a pliable

com account and login to access this headset’s 
more advanced features, such as the surround 
calibration and RGB lighting. None of the 
other headsets had this cloud-based hurdle, 
and there was nothing in Synapse 2.0 that 
justified this superfluous login procedure. 
Although you may be nonplussed at 
having to jump through such hoops to 
run the software, your ears are in for a 
treat. The drivers in this headset have one 
of the widest frequency responses of any 
headset we tested, and it really comes 
across when gaming and listening to 
music, movies, and TV shows; their raw 
audio performance was superior at every 
end of the spectrum. The 7.1 surround 
sound capabilities rely on an algorithm as 
opposed to discrete speakers in the cans, 
but it’s still pretty convincing in suitable 
TV shows and movies. It may not give you 
a tactical advantage in games, but it’s nice 
to have positional audio as an option. Keep 
Previous versions of the Viper headset 
featured an onboard LED switch, but this 
one relies on Patriot’s software utility. The 
headset features a closed-back design that 
blocks exterior environmental noise and a 
pair of 40mm neodymium magnet main 
drivers deliver a quality sound field in the 
mid-range and high-end frequencies. Each 
can also houses a 30mm sub-driver, which 
helps deliver some extra punch at the 
lower frequencies. 
The headset features a rigid mic 
boom, leaving the mic a fair distance 
from the mouth. This resulted in some 
added environmental noise muddying 
our conversation, but our teammates 
reported that it didn’t keep them 
from clearly understanding us in the 
heat of battle. 
Patriot’s Viper V370 is a solid choice 
for gamers looking for a comfortable 
virtual 7.1-capable headset that won’t 
gut their wallets. 
Razer Kraken 7.1 V2
When it comes to style, Razer always 
seems to have an edge on the competition. 
Compared to the rest of the headsets in 
this roundup, however, the Kraken 7.1 V2 
almost comes off looking bland. The cans 
are composed of matte black plastic and 
black metal mesh, and the forked hinges 
and headband edges are black anodized 
aluminum. The ear cushions and the 
headband’s top and sides are covered in a 
soft pleather material, but the underside 
of the headband is draped in a breathable 
mesh fabric. The mic boom extends and 
retracts into the left can, and you can mute 
and unmute the mic by softly pressing the 
tip; a red LED lights to indicate when the 
mic is muted. The mic boom is somewhat 
flexible, letting slightly you change its 
position when extended, but it is less 
flexible than we’d like. 
The V2 in this headset’s title refers to the 
new oval ear cushions, which do a better job 
of fitting over the sensitive parts of your ears 
for hours upon hours of comfortable use, 
even for users with glasses. Razer’s logo on 
each can is RGB LED-backlit, and you can 
use the Synapse 2.0 software to tweak the 
colors and effects. For those new to Razer

plastic, but there’s no rubberized-
sensation to the finish like the HyperX 
Cloud Alpha’s. The cans have large 
louvered vents on the sides, with a 
semicircular notch, which is designed 
to accommodate the mic boom on the 
left can and the volume dial on the 
right one. The only hint of color comes 
from a pair of red chrome bands on the 
mic boom, the red metal mesh on the 
front and back of the noise-cancelling 
microphone, and the inner lining of the 
cans. The ear cushions and headband 
pad consist of velvet-covered foam 
that’s a bit stiffer to the touch than 
some of the other headsets featured 
here, however the PC 373D was also 
very light, making it one of the more 
comfortable to wear for a prolonged 
span of time. 
Those louvers we mentioned aren’t 
merely a visual flair, they represent 
this headset’s open-can design, which 
lets in sound from your surrounding 
environment. The velvet-covered ear 
cushions also help exterior noise filter to 
your ears. Of all the headsets we tested, 
this is the only one we used that let us 
hear the clicking of our Cherry MX 
Blue keyboard switches while listening 
to music. 
The PC 373D relies on a pair of 
40mm transducers to deliver a rich 
and clear sound field. Compared 
to the Razer and HyperX offerings, 
however, the low-end frequencies had 
a little less punch. The USB connector 
features an in-line Dolby on/off 
switch, which lets you cycle between 
stereo and algorithmic 7.1 surround 
sound. The compulsory software 
utility lacks any bells and whistles, 
but if you don’t bother “tweaking” EQ 
settings much, you’ll appreciate the 
simplified interface. 
The headset’s build materials and 
overall construction feel too plasticky, 
which is disappointing considering 
the PC 373D’s steep price. If you need 
a high-performance headset that doesn’t 
completely cut you off from your 
surrounding environment, then the 
Sennheiser PC 373D is a sound choice. ■
one of the more comfortable headsets 
of the lot. The overall build quality 
was also higher than we expected for 
an entry-level headset. 
If you don’t have a lot of cash to spend 
on a gaming headset, the Rosewill Nebula 
GX10 is an easy recommendation. The 
fact that it looks great—as long as you 
like blue LEDs—is just icing on the cake. 
Sennheiser PC 373D
Sennheiser’s PC 373D is a headset 
that’ll lighten your wallet considerably 
more than the competition, but there 
are a few other things that make this 
headset stand out from the crowd, both 
for better and for worse. 
Aesthetically, the PC 373D is 
rather muted compared to the other 
high-ticket headset, the Logitech 
G933 Artemis Spectrum Snow. It’s 
constructed primarily of matte-black 
faux leather. This helps keep the headset’s 
considerable sound output between the 
drivers and your ears, where it belongs. 
The mic is on a fixed beam that you 
can rotate up and out of the way, and 
minor adjustments can be made with the 
mildly flexible tip. The cord that runs to 
each can from the headband is covered 
in blue nylon, as is the thick cable that 
terminates with 3.5mm phono plugs. 
There are dedicated mic and line-out plugs 
for PC use, but the headset ships with a 
Y-adapter cable that makes it suitable for 
use with portable devices, game consoles, 
and laptops. 
The sound field you’ll enjoy with 
this headset is pretty respectable given 
the affordable sticker price of the 
Nebula GX10, with a wide mid-range,

stability. The backplate also draws your 
attention to Power Boost IC, which is 
designed to reduce ripple noise and minimize 
the adverse effects of power fluctuations that 
can impact performance. To power this card, 
ZOTAC provides a pair of 8-pin PCIe power 
plugs and display output options include 
three DisplayPort 1.4 ports, one HDMI 2.0b 
port, and a dual link DVI-D port.
The FireStorm software utility lets you 
adjust the LEDs in three zones and manually 
overclock the card with easy-to-decipher 
controls for core clock, voltage, memory 
clock, power limits, and more. According 
to ZOTAC, the card has been factory 
tested to support a 150MHz higher core 
and 200MHz higher memory clock. To ease 
the overclocking process, and circumvent 
NVIDIA’s absurd factory overclocking ban, 
ZOTAC bundles a custom overclocked 
profile with FireStorm, which raises the core 
to 1,833MHz. 
In the benchmarks, the ZOTAC GTX 
1070 Ti AMP Extreme performs well, if 
just shy of an overclocked GTX 1080. Due 
to this card’s sticker price, however, it’s hard 
to recommend this card when you can find 
GTX 1080s going for the same price. 
of the 1070 Ti, evidenced by these two, is 
comparable to that of the GTX 1080. So 
what gives? To us, this looks like a blatant 
attempt by NVIDIA to avoid cannibalizing 
sales of the GTX 1080. But let’s let the 
numbers speak for themselves.
ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1070 Ti AMP! 
EXTREME
When it comes to custom heatsinks, 
ZOTAC has not been shy about going 
big, and the 1070 Ti AMP Extreme is no 
exception. This card is 12.8-inches long, 2.5-
slots thick, and it extends more than an inch 
past the bracket. The card’s shroud consists of 
ZOTAC’s signature Carbon EXOARMOR, 
which blends a metallic slate-colored metal 
shroud with a glossy plastic fan frame 
that’s reminiscent of carbon fiber. There’s a 
painted metal backplate that wraps around 
the top and front edges of the heatsink to 
help contain heat. There are three dual-blade 
EKO FANS designed to minimize airflow 
dead spots. These are attached to the surface 
of ZOTAC’s IceStorm cooler, which consists 
of copper heatpipes of varying diameters and 
a massive aluminum heatsink. SPECTRA-
enabled LEDs illuminate the face of the card, 
as well as the ZOTAC 
logo on the top edge 
and the Push The 
Limit badge on the 
backplate. 
On the custom 
PCB, you’ll find an 
8-phase VRM that 
spreads the power 
load and heat across

ay hello to one weird mutant of a graphics 
card: the GTX 1070 Ti. The GP104 chip 
at the center of this graphics card is nothing 
new; it is manufactured using TSMC’s 16nm 
FinFET process and comprises 7.2 billion 
dual-gate transistors. The GTX 1070 this 
card shares its name with features 15 SMs, 
and the GTX 1080 has 20. Rather than split 
the difference, NVIDIA left 19 SMs enabled 
on the 1070 Ti, giving it access to 2,432 
CUDA cores, 152 texture units, and 64 
render output units. There is an 8GB bank of 
onboard memory, and the GDDR5 chips are 
clocked at 8Gbps and running on a 256-bit 
bus. The base clock on this card is set to the 
GTX 1080’s 1,607MHz, and the boost clock 
is set to the GTX 1070’s 1,683MHz. 
As if it were designed by a committee, 
this 180-watt hybrid comes with a suggested 
retail price halfway between the GTX 1070 
and the 1080, at $450. It’s an enticing 
proposition on paper, but thanks to MSI and 
ZOTAC, we’ve got two samples in house to 
see how the GTX 1070 Ti really stacks up. 
Before we get into specifics, though, we need 
to discuss the clocks on the GTX 1070 Ti.
Clocking Questions
The gap between the vanilla 1070’s base 
and boost clock is 177MHz. The 1080’s gap 
is 126MHz. The difference between the two 
clocks on the 1070 Ti is a conspicuously 
puny 76MHz. NVIDIA is disallowing its 
partner card manufacturers from shipping 
1070 Tis with factory overclocks, meaning 
every card you might want to compare has 
the same clocks. MSI, for instance, sells five 
versions of the 1070 Ti, costing between 
$449 for the 1070 Ti AERO 8G and $489 
for the Gaming 8G. Power availability and 
the cooling capacity of the heatsink and 
shroud combos on third-party versions

capacitors. Unlike every other MSI card 
we’ve tested, however, 
there’s no support for 
the MSI Gaming App, 
so any overclocking you 
do will need to be done 
in MSI’s AfterBurner 
utility. Strangely, in the 
benchmarks this card 
boosted well beyond the 
measly 1,683MHz boost 
clock, and was bouncing 
between 1,850MHz and 
higher, depending on the 
workload. 
Outputs include three 
full-sized DisplayPort 
1.4, one full size HDMI 
2.0b, and one DVI-D 
port. MSI’s contender gets 
power via one 8-pin and 
one 6-pin PCIe power 
connector.
In the real-world 
games, MSI’s card 
managed to outpace 
ZOTAC’s, but the 
synthetic tests favored the 
AMP Extreme. This card 
shaves $10 off the base 
price, but head-to-head, 
we’re going to call this 
match a Ti[e]. If you 
find the GTX 1080 on 
sale, however, both of 
these cards get rather 
less compelling. ■

MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Ti Gaming 8G
MSI slaps its Twin Frozr VI heatsink 
onto every GPU it sells, so it’s no surprise 
to see it on this GTX 1070 Ti. This 
card has a nice flat profile that’s perfectly 
contained within its two-slot form factor 
for easy side-by-side SLI, but like ZOTAC’s 
AMP Extreme card, it extends above the 
top edge of the bracket by about an inch. 
The shroud of the card consists of red and 
black plastic, with LED-backlit translucent 
red accents on the right side. The heatsink 
consists of large 8mm nickel-plated copper 
heatpipes threaded through a sizeable bank 
of aluminum fins. There’s an anodized black 
aluminum backplate, and another plate of 
aluminum underneath the heatsink to help 
cool off memory chips and VRM-adjacent 
components. These plates form a PCB 
sandwich that adds rigidity to the card and 
improves overall cooling efficiency. There’s 
an RGB LED-backlit MSI dragon logo on 
the top of the card that you can tweak using 
the MSI Mystic Light software utility. On the 
face of the card you’ll find a pair of 95mm 
TORX 2.0 fans with alternating dispersion 
fan blades designed to accelerate airflow 
without increasing noise output. These are 
dual-ball bearing fans, which may be a tad 
noisier than sleeve-bearing fans, but these will 
likely run for longer. If noise is important to 
you, then you’ll probably appreciate MSI’s 
ZeroFrozr technology, which lets the fans 
stop spinning when the card’s idle or running 
cooler than 60 degrees Celsius.
The PCB on MSI’s card features a 10-
phase VRM and MSI’s military-class 
components, including Hi-C capacitors, 
Super Ferrite chokes, and Japanese solid

We also like that MSI installs the GPU 
into its own chamber to prevent GPU 
heat from affecting other components. 
The Infinite A also features a separate 
chamber for the PSU and one for the 
CPU and primary system components, 
so there are three chambers in all. MSI 
has used this compartmentalized design 
in previous small form factor systems, and 
we also like it in this larger Infinite A rig.
Hardware-wise, the Infinite A is what 
you’d expect from a modern gaming rig. 
MSI aims to maximize frames without 
going overboard in a single area. As 
such, you won’t find an Intel Skylake-X 
processor or AMD Ryzen Threadripper 
in this system. Instead, Intel’s Core 
i7-7700 is a smart choice to power 
everyday productivity. This quad-core 
chip features Hyper-Threading, 8MB 
of Intel SmartCache, and a 3.6GHz 
base frequency (4.2GHz Turbo Boost). 
MSI also installs 16GB of DDR4-2400 
memory, which should be enough for 
most gamers.
an angular section near the side panel. 
Just fire up the MysticLight app and 
you’ll be able to pick between Meteor, 
Pendulum, and Kaleidoscope effects—
all of which are more visually appealing 
than the standard breathing or flashing 
modes so common on RGB components. 
You can also customize the look of the 
motherboard and GPU lighting with 
MSI’s Gaming app. The overall LED 
lighting effects are pleasant, without being 
garish, and complement the brushed 
aluminum and tempered glass elements of 
the chassis.
MSI includes both the tempered glass 
side panel and a solid steel panel, but 
we imagine most enthusiasts will opt for 
the dark tempered glass. Besides looking 
classy, the dark window gives you a 
glimpse of the internals and dampers the 
bright LED lighting to a more low-key 
level. To showcase the GPU, MSI uses 
a PCIe riser cable and vertically mounts 
the GPU, which gives you a good look at 
MSI’s custom TWIN FROZR VI cooler. 
C
PU has reviewed a few MSI desktop 
PCs over the past few years, and 
although they had varied designs and 
hardware, a small form factor was one 
common thread. Going small is often 
a smart move for computer hardware 
manufacturers such as MSI, because 
it’s often more challenging for gamers 
to put together their own small form 
factor rig than a system in a mid- or 
full-tower chassis that fits standard-sized 
components. The Infinite A, however, 
breaks away from many of MSI’s previous 
efforts. It’s a mid-tower with loads of LED 
lighting and a tempered glass side panel. 
The more traditional size, in theory, offers 
greater mass appeal for gamers who don’t 
want to build their own rig and don’t want 
a say over each-and-every part, like you 
often see with a PC boutique.
The Infinite A follows many of the 
latest PC design trends. Let’s start with 
the LED lighting. The front panel boasts 
a printed circuit board pattern with 
customizable LED effects that run along

A series when it comes to storage. All 
models feature a PCIe SSD for the OS 
drive (our build comes with Samsung’s 
512GB SM961), but the VR7RE-007US 
lacks a secondary drive for mass file 
storage. On the other Infinite A models, 
MSI includes both a PCIe SSD and a 
2TB HDD. On the plus side, there’s 
plenty of room and available SATA 
connections to add SSDs or HDDs.
For $1,699.99, the Infinite A proved 
to be a capable gaming system in our 
benchmark testing. In Metro: Last Light, 
we saw 101 frames per second at the 
highest settings and a resolution of 2,560 
x 1,440, while DX12 testing with Sniper 
Elite 4 produced 136fps. Frames in the 
Witcher 3 were also respectable with 
77fps. Intel’s Core i7-7700 showed well 
with a score of 889 in Cinebench 15 and 
1,864 pixels per second in POV-Ray 3.7. 
The Infinite A is similarly priced to 
an off-the-shelf gaming desktop, yet it 
offers a level of polish that you won’t 
see from the local big box store. And 
with Christmas on the way, we’d highly 
recommend the system as a gift for the 
gamer in your life who’s not yet ready (or 
interested) in building their own rig.  ■

As you might expect with a gaming 
rig, MSI puts the most emphasis on 
the build’s GPU. Our test unit features 
a MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Gaming, 
and there are also configurations with 
a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti ($1,899.99; 
InfiniteA006US) or 1070 ($1,499.99; 
InfiniteA008US), if you’re looking to 
tweak gaming performance or budget. 
The MSI GeForce GTX 1080 in our rig 
features a slight factory overclock with 
a 1,620MHz base (1,607MHz is stock 
speed) and 1,759MHz boost clock 
(1733MHz is stock speed). For ideal VR 
connectivity, the Infinite A features a 
front HDMI output and MSI preinstalls 
its VR Link software that can optimize 
system settings for VR performance.
Sound is just as big a part of the 
gaming experience as your frame rate, so 
MSI includes its Audio Boost technology 
that features a hardware amplifier to 
deliver premium audio fidelity. To 
enhance multichannel audio, the Infinite 
A desktop also comes with Nahimic 2. 
This sound processing technology can 
expand the audio field to 7.1-channel 
surround sound over a regular stereo

wired connectivity, the onboard Ethernet 
port is powered by Intel’s i219V NIC.
Supermicro does a good job on the 
SUPERO C7370-CG-IW ensuring 
Intel’s 8th Generation processors will 
function without limitations. The CPU 
socket features gold plating that’s 15 
microns thick, which should eliminate 
galvanic corrosion and provide a reliable 
connection with your Coffee Lake 
processor. The Mini-ITX form factor 
doesn’t leave much space for heatsinks, 
but Supermicro manages to fit a tall, 
slim heatsink over the VRM, as well as a 
thicker, shorter heatsink on the PCH, to 
cool the board’s power handling areas. 
If your miniature system includes a 
chassis with a side-panel window, 
you’ll like that the SUPERO C7Z370-
CG-IW features RGB LEDs along the 
right edge of the PCB. In addition to 
the color, Supermicro allows you to 
customize the effects with preset Alarm, 
Breathing, Meteor, and Rainbow patterns, 
among others. Even considering the rise 
of RGB LEDs, many recent Mini-ITX 
We like that Supermicro is able provide 
two M.2 slots (M-Key) by locating one of 
the slots on the back of the PCB, while 
the other is just above the PCIe x16 slot. 
The two 32Gbps M.2 slots (type 2280) 
can be set up in RAID 0 or 1, so you can 
get the most out of two PCIe SSDs. For 
SATA SSDs and HDDs, there are four 
6Gbps SATA ports that support RAID 0, 
1, 5, and 10.
Connectivity is similar to what you’d 
find on a full-size ATX motherboard. The 
rear panel features four USB 3.0 ports, 
two USB 3.1 ports (1 Type-A, 1 Type-C), 
and a PS/2 port. Two additional USB 3.0 
ports and two USB 2.0 ports are available 
via internal headers. If you plan to use 
an Intel processor’s integrated graphics, 
Supermicro provides an HDMI port and 
a DisplayPort output. 
One of the big benefits of a small form 
factor system is its portability, and most 
Mini-ITX motherboards feature onboard 
Wi-Fi to let your SFF rig connect to 
the Internet when you’re away from a 
wired connection. The SUPERO C7370-
CG-IW features two Wi-Fi antenna ports 
on the rear panel, as well as an Azurewave 
W
hen it comes to small form 
factor mainboards, motherboard 
companies often make a few microATX 
options and only one or two Mini-ITX 
boards for a given chipset. With Intel’s 
new Z370 chipset, there are currently 
only a few Mini-ITX models on the 
market. The SUPERO C7370-CG-IW is 
a welcome addition to the Mini-ITX fray, 
and it comes with many of the features 
we liked on the ATX-sized SUPERO 
C7Z370-CG-L.
Trimming the Z370 chipset down to 
the Mini-ITX form factor does mean 
that Supermicro has to make some 
layout changes—when compared to 
the C7Z370-CG-L. Like every other 
Mini-ITX Z370 motherboard available, 
the CZ370-CG-IW has only two DIMM 
slots and one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot. In the 
two DIMM slots, you’ll be able to install 
up to 32GB of memory and Supermicro 
supports overclocked memory up to 
3,733MHz and Intel XMP settings. The 
3,733MHz OC speed is appreciably 
higher than the DDR4-2800MHz 
maximum speed on the SUPERO 
CZ370-CG-L.

DDR4-3000, EVGA’s GeForce GTX 
1080 Ti FTW3 GAMING, and a 480GB 
Patriot Hellfire SSD—components we’ve 
used when reviewing full-size Z370 
motherboards. And with the high-end 
hardware installed, the SUPERO 
C7Z370-CG-IW did excellent in our 
benchmark tests. A few of the highlights 
include 93fps in Witcher 3 (at Ultra 
settings and a resolution of 2,560 x 
1,440), 1360 points in Cinebench 15, 
and 29.6GBps in SiSoftware Sandra’s 
Memory Bandwidth test.
Supermicro touts the SUPERO 
C7Z370-CG-IW as “loaded with features 
that all gamers and enthusiasts would 
enjoy in a small, portable package,” 
and we agree. Support for overclocked 
memory (up to DDR4-3733) and RAID 
PCIe SSD configuration are particularly 
notable additions for any Mini-ITX 
board. At $199.99, the SUPERO 
C7Z370-CG-IW is one of the more 
costly Mini-ITX motherboards available, 
but it has the amenities to please power 
users. ■

motherboards lack LEDs, as there’s 
often not room on the PCB. Typically, 
motherboard makers face onboard LEDs 
forward, but on the SUPERO C7Z370-
CG-IW, Supermicro points the LEDs 
to the back with illumination appearing 
to come from the side of the board. In 
our test system, the back-facing LEDs 
also reflected off the motherboard tray, 
creating a backlighting effect.
One of Supermicro’s new additions 
to its SUPERO motherboards is the 
SUPERO Booster utility and a revamped 
BIOS. The new BIOS and software 
utility make it easy to overclock your 
8th Generation Intel processor. Previous 
Supermicro motherboards, of course, 
allowed you to overclock the CPU 
and memory, but the interface was 
a bit clunky, in comparison to other 
modern BIOSes. SUPERO Booster—in 
particular—offers an intuitive interface 
that lets you fine-tune CPU and memory 
speeds and voltages. You can also switch 
between multiple overclocking profiles 
and control fan speeds.

connectivity with support for 802.11ac/
b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.2. 
Everyday productivity is covered 
by Intel’s Core i7-7500T. This quad-
core processor features a 2.7GHz base 
frequency and a 3.3GHz Turbo Boost 
speed. The MAGNUS EN1060K does a 
good job supporting modern memory and 
storage options. On this barebones model, 
we installed 32GB of HyperX Predator 
DDR4-2133, and the system supports up 
to 32GB of 2400MHz memory.
Storage-wise, ZOTAC makes room for 
both an M.2 SSD (we installed Patriot’s 
480GB Hellfire) and a 2.5-inch SATA 
SSD or HDD. We like that ZOTAC gives 
you the option of a 2.5-inch drive, as it 
gives budget builders an affordable option 
for an OS drive and enthusiasts can have 
a storage drive on top of a speedy PCIe 
SSD in the M.2 slot. For an OS, the 
MAGNUS EN1060K supports Windows 
8.1 and 10.
(HxWxL). The ultra-slim chassis features 
a basic black exterior and should blend 
nicely into most entertainment centers. 
Anyone considering this system for VR or 
gaming on the big screen will like that the 
onboard GeForce GTX 1060 is powerful 
enough to drive either experience and 
comes with the GTX 1060’s full 
complement of 6GB GDDR5.
The integrated GeForce GTX 1060 
can drive up to four display outputs, 
which includes two HDMI 2.0 ports and 
two DisplayPort 1.3 ports on the rear 
panel. All of the MAGNUS EN1060K 
video outputs support 4K at 60Hz. I/O 
connectivity is also respectable for a small 
form factor system. The front panel boasts 
two USB 3.1 ports (one Type-A and one 
Type-C), a 3-in-1 SD card reader, and 
analog audio I/O. On the rear panel, 
there are two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 
2.0 ports, and two wired Gigabit LAN 
ports. ZOTAC also builds in wireless 
B
ig and bold is generally what comes 
to mind when we talk about gaming 
PCs, especially with custom-built power 
user rigs. But a full or mid-tower chassis 
is by no means a requirement thanks to 
the power-efficient design of modern 
CPUs and GPUs. As an example, look 
no further than ZOTAC’s MAGNUS 
lineup. These miniature PCs feature an 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, or 
1080 graphics card and an Intel Kaby 
Lake desktop processor. ZOTAC sent 
us a barebones model of MAGNUS 
EN1060K preassembled with Intel’s Core 
i5-7500T and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 
1060. The company also offers a complete 
MAGNUS EN1060K system (ZBOX-
EN1060K-U-W2B) with memory, 
storage, and Windows 10 already 
installed.
The MAGNUS EN1060K is a little 
bigger than your average set-top box with 
dimensions of 2.45- x 7.99- x 8.27-inches

especially if you compare them to top-
of-the-line Kaby Lake processors. But 
considering the barebones system’s 
$899.99 MSRP, we expect you shouldn’t 
have any problems with multimedia 
and productivity applications. Anyone 
considering the MAGNUS EN1060K 
for a home theater environment should 
like that, even under full load, the active 
cooling system was barely audible.
ZOTAC’s MAGNUS EN1060K 
is ideal for people who want to move 
the gaming experience to the big 
screen or need a VR system that won’t 
look out of place in the home theater. 
Power users who want some flexibility 
with component choice can opt for the 
barebones design, while others who need 
something functional right out of the box 
can pick the model with memory, storage, 
and OS installed. The exceptionally quiet 
design also might make it appealing for a 
home office PC that secretly packs some 
gaming punch. ■
BY NATHAN LAKE
One area where the MAGNUS 
EN1060K really stands out is the ease-
of-access you have to components—all 
the more important if you opt for the 
barebones kit. Oftentimes, small form 
factor systems have a notebook-like 
design where there are lots of tiny screws 
to remove and reinstall when working 
on the system. On the MAGNUS 
EN1060K, all you’ll need to do is 
unscrew two thumb screws (on the rear 
panel) and slide off the bottom cover. 
Once open, you’ll have convenient access 
to the system memory and storage—both 
the M.2 slot and 2.5-inch bay.
The MAGNUS EN1060K was 
a capable performer at 2,560 x 1,440, 
and it’s notable that the system delivered 
playable frame rates (37fps) in the GPU-
demanding Witcher 3. We saw near 
60fps in the less intensive Metro: Last 
Light (51fps) and Sniper Elite 4 (56fps). 
Bumping resolution down to 1080p 
brings frame rates up above 60 in all our 
gaming tests. The remaining benchmark 
numbers won’t necessarily “wow” you,

ARCTIC Freezer 33 TR
make direct contact with the CPU’s heat 
spreader, plus a stack of 49 0.5mm-thick 
aluminum fins. ARCTIC also improves 
Freezer 33 TR’s fan by including its new 
BioniX F120 fan that boasts a wide PWM 
range of 200rpm to 1,800rpm.
At the fans’ full 1,800rpm, the BioniX 
F120 fan delivers 69cfm to quickly 
move hot air away from the air cooler’s 
heatpipe and fin structure. ARCTIC rates 
the BioniX F120 with a maximum noise 
level of 0.5 Sone, and in our experience, 
fan noise at full throttle was just a bit 
quieter than air coolers with high-speed 
2,000rpm fans. The BioniX F120’s 
200rpm minimum PWM speed allows 
the Freezer 33 TR to operate quietly 
during idle or basic duties.
The design changes to the Freezer 33 
TR allow ARCTIC to bump the cooler’s 
recommended TDP to 200 watts (up 
from 150 watts on the Freezer 33) with a 
maximum cooling capacity of 320 watts. 
If you need additional cooling capacity 
A
MD’s Threadripper has changed 
the game for CPU cooler makers. 
The giant chip (72mm by 55mm) isn’t 
compatible with many existing CPU 
coolers—often due to the CPU’s length—
and even if the cooler’s cold plate is big 
enough, power users might not be able to 
purchase a compatible mounting bracket. 
ARCTIC Freezer 33 TR is engineered 
to work with Threadripper and AMD 
has tested and approved the CPU cooler 
for the 1900X, 1920X, and 1950X 
processors. ARCTIC also designs the 
Freezer 33 TR to support processors that 
fit into AMD’s AM4 socket and Intel’s 
2066 and 2011-3 sockets.
The Freezer 33 TR builds upon 
ARCTIC’s Freezer 33 series cooler. It’s 
basically the same heatsink with a longer 
base that accommodates Threadripper’s 
rectangular chip, as well as Intel’s big, 
high-power processors, such as the 
Skylake-X line. The heatsink itself 
consists of four 6mm heatpipes that 
for your processor, ARCTIC includes 
a second set of fan brackets to create a 
push-pull configuration with the included 
BioniX F120.
The Freezer 33 TR proved itself 
worthy in our testing with AMD’s Ryzen 
Threadripper 1950X. The processor idled 
at an average temperature of 31.7 degrees 
Celsius. When we fired up POV-Ray 3.7 
for 10 minutes, temps were still chill with 
an average temp of 58.5 C and maximum 
of 69 C. It was similarly good in Prime95, 
where we recorded an average of temp of 
66.2 C and a max of 71 C. 
An MSRP of $47.99 puts the Freezer 
TR 33 in extremely affordable territory 
for a TR4-ready CPU cooler. And there’s 
enough cooling performance to keep the 
1950X, AMD’s most powerful Ryzen 
Threadripper, from throttling under 
extreme loads. It’s a good value.  ■

HP SSD M700 240GB
smaller of HP’s SSD M700s for $45.99. 
Whether you need to upgrade a sluggish 
old laptop, have a tiny mountain of files 
that you regularly access, or simply want 
a crazy-affordable boot drive for a budget 
build, these two solid-state drives will give 
you some punch without putting much of 
a dent in your pocketbook.
Pop the top of the SSD M700 and you’ll 
find a dual-core storage controller and a 
batch of planar MLC NAND. There are 
four memory channels, and they support 
NANDXtend technology, which, as you 
might guess, helps get more mileage out of 
the SSD M700’s NAND. For example, the 
drive’s higher order LDPC error correction 
allows for high-speed parallel decoding 
and real-time error correction. Write 
acceleration and an SLC cache algorithm 
help bolster the SSD M700’s performance. 
HP says the 240GB SSD M700 should 
be good for sequential reads and writes 
of 560MBps and 520MBps, respectively; 
likewise, the drive’s random performance 
T
his time of year, we hope that our 
loved ones are wise enough to give us 
the gift of PC hardware. Naturally, we 
can’t always rely on friends and family to 
have impeccable component clairvoyance, 
so it never hurts to offer them a little 
helpful “guidance.” As you assemble 
your own wish list (hint: don’t forget 
to check out our annual “Holiday Gift 
Guide” in this issue), be sure to include a 
decent number of stocking stuffers. As it 
happens, HP’s SSD M700 6Gbps SATA 
drives are a nice candidate. 
While you’ve busied yourself obsessively 
following any and all developments related 
to PCIe SSDs, their 6Gbps SATA kin 
keep getting cheaper and cheaper and 
cheaper. The 240GB SSD M700 we’re 
reviewing only costs $99.99, and we 
were able to find it for sale online a little 
cheaper than that—just under 80 bucks. 
Hunt for the 120GB SSD M700 and 
you’ll likely scare up a similar deal. In 
fact, we had the opportunity to buy the 
peaks at 75,000 IOPS (reads) and 80,000 
IOPS (writes). In our testing, the SSD 
M700 largely lived up to expectations.
Despite the SSD M700’s performance, 
HP’s new drives face an extremely crowded 
field. The SSD M700 is compatible with 
HPdst.exe (HP Software Pre-installation 
Environment), which may give it an edge for 
anyone upgrading an existing HP PC, but 
other buyers face tough choices. Regardless, 
we’re glad that HP is in this game and hope 
the company keeps playing. ■

of the rear panel, the dual-bay drive cage, 
and the panels that make up the power 
supply shroud. (The power supply shroud 
is new; more on that in a moment.) 
All of those things can be reoriented to 
facilitate an inverted build, and to top 
it all off, you can remove the mounting 
hardware that supports the Dark Base 
700’s tempered-glass side panel and move 
it around to the right side, as well, and 
then fasten the steel panel on the left.
The power supply shroud runs the 
full length of the interior out of the box, 
but like the rest of the interior is highly 
modular. You can pop any or all of the 
four plastic panels on its top out quickly 
and easily if, for example, you want to 
install a radiator behind the front panel 
(it supports rads up to 360mm long), or if 
you want to remove the drive cage below 
and mount a reservoir/pump unit there. 
The side panel (the one that faces toward 
the glass side panel) of course comes off, 
as well, and you can flip it around and 
mount it on the right side.

ack in June 2016, we reviewed the Dark 
Base 900 from the German component 
maker be quiet! and liked it so much that 
we awarded the case our seldom-used 
CPU Cutting Edge Award for innovative 
design. Our review, which appeared on the 
website and in the July 2016 issue, had 
this to say: “There are a lot of cases on the 
market today that provide some degree of 
modularity, but the be quiet! Dark Base Pro 
900 takes the concept of modular design 
to a whole new level, and that’s why we’ve 
awarded it the CPU Cutting Edge Award.”
Now be quiet! has sent us a case that 
we like even more: the Dark Base 700, 
a mid-tower that is every bit as flexible 
in accommodating all kinds of builds 
as the 900, but adds a few features that 
sweeten the deal. 
Like the DB900, the 700 gives builders 
complete freedom to build either a 
traditional, left-facing build or to invert 
everything and build facing right. In 
order to accomplish this, you can remove 
the motherboard tray, a sizable portion 
Speaking of new additions, be quiet! also 
gives the Dark Base 700 some cool LED 
accent lighting in the form of a pair of strips 
that run along the sides of the front panel, 
from top to bottom. Using a button at the 
front of the top panel, you can set the strips 
to white, red, green, blue, orange, or purple, 
and you can make them continuous or set 
them to “breath” mode so that they fade 
in and out. There’s also an internal lead 
that you can attach to a header on your 
motherboard if available and let your board 
control the lights, giving you access to their 
full RGB color range.
The LEDs are a nice addition to what 
we think is be quiet!’s best-looking case 
yet; the smooth, brushed-aluminum 
front and top panels are gorgeous, and 
combined with the tempered-glass side 
panel give the Dark Base 700 a look that’s 
both luxurious and high-tech. If this case 
were a car, it would be a BMW M5 or a 
Mercedes AMG E Class sedan. ■

Zalman Z-Machine X7
the X7’s three, pre-installed 120mm RGB 
LED fans can pull in as much air as needed, 
with or without an attendant radiator (up 
to 360mm in length). Up top, the brushed 
aluminum runs about three-quarters of an 
inch above a lower, well-ventilated steel panel 
that also accommodates a triple rad.
The motherboard tray has many of 
the modern design notes you’d expect, 
including plenty of rubber-grommeted cable-
management holes, a generous cutout for 
cooler installation, and some very handy 
plastic graphics card supports that you can 
set to any height along the range of PCI 
expansion slots that you need. While we’re 
on the subject of VGA supports, we should 
point out one of the X7’s coolest features; 
Zalman includes a steel bracket mounted 
on the power supply shroud that lines up 
with one of the case’s two vertical expansion 
slots. If you add a vertical GPU mounting 
kit with ribbon cable, you can easily mount 
your graphics card so that it’s the focal point 
of your build when folks gaze through the 
tinted glass side panel on the X7’s left side. 
Z
alman’s Z-Machine sub-brand of 
high-end PC gaming products has been 
around for quite a while, but the brand’s 
newest offering, the Z-Machine X7, is the 
first one we’ve been hands-on with in some 
time. The X7 is a full-tower enclosure that is 
packed to the gills with modern case features 
designed to keep builders happy and make 
builds look great. Everything starts up front 
with the X7’s brushed-aluminum front and 
top panels; the case has a few plastic bits 
here and there, but by and large it’s a steel 
frame, a steel motherboard tray and power 
supply shroud, aluminum panels, and a pair 
of tempered-glass side panels.
As you can imagine, a full tower with 
this much hefty aluminum and glass is fairly 
heavy, but not prohibitively so. Zalman went 
with the smooth, uninterrupted panels that 
are all the rage these days, but used some 
nice design elements to still allow plentiful 
airflow opportunities; sort of a cake-and-eat-
it-too scenario. For instance, there are baffled 
intakes that run all along the front of the 
left and right sides of the case that ensure all 
It’s not the first vertical GPU-mounting setup 
we’ve seen in a case, but they are still rare 
enough these days in a stock chassis that we 
take special notice of them.
The PSU shroud also has a really cool 
“Z-Machine X7” cutout on its outward 
(left) side, and the white plexi behind 
the cutout is LED backlit. Combine 
this with the LED fans and the Zalman 
ZM-MFC5 fan and lighting controller 
pre-installed at the front and top of the 
left side just behind the power and reset 
buttons (and just above the case’s USB 
and audio ports), and you have a very 
cool lighting system that’s ready to plug in 
and go right out of the box.
Zalman’s Z-Machine X7 is big, bold, 
and beautiful. Its six 3.5-inch drive bays 
and five 2.5-inch drive mounting brackets 
hold a lot of storage, and the case supports 
motherboards up to EATX, as big a 
graphics card as you can find, and all the 
custom cooling gear you’ll ever need. ■

PrimoChill Vue Coolant
another brand sitting on a drawer for a 
year or so, and there’s a significant amount 
of sediment that separates out and clumps 
up. Although we haven’t had the Vue for 
long, there’s no signs of particulates or 
settling at the bottom of the bottle even 
after a couple days remaining motionless. 
PrimoChill recommends its Vue coolant 
to experienced users, largely because–like 
with any opaque coolant–you should 
flush and refill the coolant at least every 
six months. For those looking for fluids 
that’ll last longer between maintenance, 
PrimoChill recommends something like its 
True Transparent or PC Ice coolants in a 
clear blue or green color. Opaque coolants 
N
ot all liquid coolants are created 
equally, and PrimoChill knows this; 
that’s why they have a variety on offer. 
One of the company’s newest varieties 
is Vue, a liquid that puts the 
“cool” in coolant. We got a 32-
ounce bottle of the coolant in 
Candy Purple SX. As we went 
to press, there were 19 colors to 
choose from, though not all were 
in stock. This is a pre-mix fluid, 
which means it’s ready to add to 
your loop straight from the bottle. 
When your liquid cooling system 
is off, the fluid appears opaque and 
a uniform color, but once you fire 
the system up, the fluid’s unique 
dye swirls with a pearlescent luster. 
It not only looks fantastic, but it also lets 
you follow the flow of the fluid through 
your components. 
Like any decent pre-mix coolant, Vue 
is a water-based fluid, non-toxic, and 
environmentally-friendly. PrimoChill 
mixes Vue in small batches to ensure 
consistent color and the highest quality. 
The coolant also naturally acts as an 
antimicrobial, to help keep your system 
free from efficiency-reducing buildup. 
We’ve had a bottle of opaque coolant from 
like Vue may stain your PETG, acrylic, or 
rubber tubing, so when you perform your 
flush and refill, make sure you cut, bend, 
and run new tubing as well. 
When it comes to gunk 
buildup, however, we didn’t have 
the opportunity to determine how 
Vue holds up after a six-month run. 
But there are a handful of videos 
on YouTube showing component 
teardowns, and Vue tends to 
perform very well. According to a 
JayzTwoCents video (http://bit.
ly/2BnBsYL), not only was there little 
to no buildup, but Vue actually 
managed to scour the copper and 
nickel-plated fins of a CPU and 
GPU block, to the point that very 
little extra effort was necessary to get the 
components ready for reinstallation. This 
is no small feat for an opaque coolant. 
Although not everyone can perform 
a full system teardown as often as Vue 
demands, for those who can, it performs 
well and adds a completely unique and 
eye-catching aesthetic to any hardline or 
soft-tubing liquid cooling system. ■

State-Of-The-Art
Standards

tearing. But as you’ve probably noticed 
in pretty much every graphics card 
review you read, including the ones 
we do, VSync is one of a handful of 
settings that is routinely turned off 
to get the in-game frame rate scores. 
This is because under VSync, the 
display only draws unique frames at set 
intervals, depending on your monitor’s 
refresh rate. In short, when VSync is 
enabled, the frame rate is artificially 
capped to match the monitor’s 
refresh rate, and you’re not getting 
an accurate picture of the hardware’s 
peak performance. 
To give you an example, we recently 
wrapped up our review of the BenQ 
her viewpoint to the right or left across 
the scenery. Tearing is most apparent in 
certain game types, such as first-person 
shooters, racing games, and third-person 
action games. Quickly scrolling across 
a map in an RTS game can also induce 
the artifact. The primary objective of the 
various frame syncing technologies we’ll 
talk about in this article is to eliminate 
screen tearing, and some are more 
effective than others without introducing 
further unwanted artifacts, such as 
stuttering and input delay.

p e r f o r m a n c e 
improvements, bug

tweaks included in 
Radeon Software 
Crimson ReLive 
Edition 17.7.2, 
AMD’s graphics 
driver software 
package released 
on July 26th, is 
a new feature 
called Enhanced 
Sync. According 
to AMD, this 
display technology 
sits somewhere 
b e t w e e n 
VSync (vertical 
synchronization, 
or “wait for vertical 
refresh”) and FreeSync and works similarly to 
improve the look and feel of your games as the 
frame rate fluctuates. To dig a little deeper into 
why Enhanced Sync is such a game changer, 
we’ll explore the benefits and drawbacks of 
VSync and touch on the dynamic frame 
pacing technologies offered by both AMD 
and NVIDIA. 
The Gamer’s Bane
Screen tearing is the visual artifact in 
which the top portion of the on-screen 
image becomes misaligned with the 
bottom portion of the image, making any 
vertical lines in a game appear broken and 
shifted. It is most often visible when the 
player is relatively quickly swiping his or 
Enhanced Sync works like VSync, only without hammering your frame rates and killing your response time. 
34 December2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

where portions of frames are 
overwriting previous frames. 
FRAPS, and similar tools, only 
count the number of times the 
front buffer is swapped out.
The Puh-Puh-Problem 
With VSync
The good thing about VSync is 
that it’s effectively free. Practically 
all games support it and you don’t 
need any specialized hardware 
to make it work. According to 
Hallock, VSync can eliminate 
screen tearing by ensuring that 
there’s only ever one frame on-
screen at a time. “There is a 
downside, the GPU may have to 
hold onto a rendered frame for 
prolonged and random intervals, 
which can cause the appearance 
of ‘VSync stutter,’ or choppy 
motion.” This stutter occurs 
because the screen is refreshing 
faster than the graphics card can 
render frames, which forces it to reuse 
already-buffered frames. 
We haven’t mentioned buffers 
yet, but understanding them is an 
important facet of understanding how 
these technologies work. When the 
screen needs to post a fresh image, 
pulling it from the graphics memory 
immediately as it finishes rendering 
causes the screen to flicker. For 
this reason, double-buffering was 
introduced. This lets the graphics 
hardware render a frame in a back 
buffer, and send it to a front buffer 
when called for. The front buffer is 
what’s sent to the display for the user 
to see, which reduces the flickering 
effect. In the absence of frame syncing, 
tearing is what you see as the back 
buffer pushes an unfinished frame to 
the front buffer because the screen is 
calling for a new frame (refreshing) 
before it is fully rendered.  
Double-buffering adequately solves 
flickering and can even deliver a 
smoother gaming experience when there 
are mild fluctuations in frame rendering 
times. However, gaps still occur, leading 
amount of time it takes a particular 
piece of graphics hardware to render a 
given frame. Robert Hallock, head of 
global technical marketing at AMD, 
points out that in an ideal 60fps 
gaming scenario, there are 60 frames 
fully rendered from start to finish and 
shown on the screen every second. 
“That’s a new picture every 16.66 
milliseconds . . . or it would be, in a 
perfect world. In reality, the time to 
render a frame depends on how much 
detail is currently on-screen, and some 
frames can be a little slower or faster to 
complete as you look around.” 
Hallock describes a scenario where 
60fps can still feel choppy. For instance, 
two adjacent frames rendered in 33 
milliseconds could consist of frames 
taking 16.6ms each, or consist of an 
8ms frame followed by a 24ms frame. 
“The FPS meter would still read 60fps 
in both cases, but the latter scenario 
might feel quite choppy as the fast-
slow-fast-slow pattern creates a subtle 
jerkiness in motion.” Incidentally, you 
may be curious to know how frame-
counting applications handle tearing, 
PD2710QC, a 60Hz monitor with a 
2,560 x 1,440 native resolution. When 
we run The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 
Borderless Window mode (this mode 
ensures frame buffering is working 
properly) on a system equipped with 
a Radeon RX Vega 64 Liquid Cooled 
Edition graphics card, the frame rate 
hovers between 88 and 95 frames per 
second, but every frame above the 
monitor’s refresh rate cap is effectively 
being rendered and discarded without 
ever being drawn on screen. As a 
result, between 31% and 37% of the 
graphics card’s output is completely 
wasted on this game, and this is the 
best-case scenario with such a monitor. 
It’s for this reason that we recommend 
getting a high-refresh-rate monitor to 
anyone running a high-performance 
graphics card. 
The Frame Time Rollercoaster
It’s true, some games tend to suffer 
from more screen tearing than others. 
Overall, frame rates have less impact 
on the smoothness of gameplay than 
do frame times, which refer to the 
VSync reduced the power our Radeon RX Vega 64 was consuming by preventing it from rendering 
frames we’d never see. 
CPU  /  December2017 35

AMD’s graphics driver to ensure that 
my GPU is only rendering up to the 
exact number of frames my monitor 
can show: 75. Now my GPU isn’t using 
additional power, generating additional 
heat, or running the fan faster to render 
the 76-100+ frames I can’t see. Some 
games feel perfectly smooth at even 
lower framerates, so I could turn the 
FRTC slider lower to gain even greater 
thermal/acoustic/power savings.”
Although FRTC can impact power 
draw, depending on the title, it may 
have little effect on stuttering and 
the other major artifact introduced 
by these “cheap” frame-syncing 
technologies.
The Latency Liability
Hallock describes the other big 
problem with VSync, one that rears its 
ugly head even when the frame buffers 
are being swapped out and filled with 
fairly uniform frame times. “Having 
buffered frames is what allows the 
GPU to be ready the moment the 
monitor calls for a new image, but 
those buffered frames also mean that 
your mouse/keyboard movement could 
be two or three frames delayed as the 
GPU sits around 
waiting on the 
monitor to show 
that movement

255 watts, depending on the demands 
of the scene. When you look at the 
times when the power draw drops off 
abruptly, this is indicative of a series of 
relatively fast frame times, but spikes in 
power draw indicate more demanding 
frame rendering is happening. These 
gaps in frame rendering times still 
resulted in stutter being apparent. 
If you want to leave VSync off, 
but want to reclaim some of the 
wasted power that is being used to 
render unused frames, you can turn 
on AMD’s FRTC (Frame Rate Target 
Control) setting, and set the maximum 
frame rate to your monitor’s maximum 
refresh rate.
Hallock provides us with an ideal 
scenario for FRTC, saying “There are 
plenty of extremely fun games out there 
with modest hardware requirements, 
and they run at hundreds of frames per 
second. Two I’m playing right now are 
Space Engineers and 7 Days to Die. 
These two games run well over 100fps 
on my Acer XR341CK. Since that 
monitor is 75Hz, any frame rate that’s 
higher than 75 is basically wasted—
my monitor will never show it! So I 
turn on Frame Rate Target Control in 
to stuttering with VSync on and 
tearing with VSync off. The addition 
of a second back buffer, in a triple-
buffering scheme, significantly improves 
smoothness and reduces the likelihood 
of tearing occurring. Some PC games 
let you manually enable or disable 
frame buffering, as triple-buffering can 
be slightly more taxing of your system’s 
resources than double-buffering. 
Graphics drivers from both AMD and 
NVIDIA have triple-buffering settings, 
which you can enable or disable 
globally or on a per-application basis. 
How Power Plays A Role
Running The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 
on a 1440p screen with a fixed 60Hz 
refresh rate and a powerful graphics 
card like the Radeon RX Vega 64 is 
essentially a best-case scenario for 
VSync. When this tech is turned on, 
the graphics card doesn’t have to work 
as hard, as it’s not generating a ton 
of frames that never get drawn to the 
screen. With VSync off in the example 
described above, our graphics card was 
drawing roughly 265 watts consistently. 
When we turned VSync on, the power 
draw dropped to between 230 and 
Enabling Enhanced Sync is easy for any AMD GPU user with a compatible Polaris or Vega graphics card.

A Smarter Way To Sync
Enhanced Sync delivers an unlocked 
frame rate and reduces the input 
latency that occurs when the frame 
rate exceeds the monitor’s refresh 
rate. When the frame rate dips below 
the monitor’s refresh rate, Enhanced 
Sync automatically –and transparently 
to the end user– disables VSync, 
effectively preventing stutter from 
cratering your experience.
When ranking the technologies, 
AMD gives VSync credit for eliminating 
We’ve talked about AMD’s FreeSync 
and NVIDIA’s G-SYNC before, and 
they both work relatively similarly. The 
primary difference between the two 
is that NVIDIA’s option relies on a 
hardware scaler built into the monitor 
itself, whereas AMD’s relies on the 
DisplayPort 1.2a standard extension (all 
monitors come with a built-in hardware 
scaler). In both instances, you’ll need 
to purchase a monitor that supports 
either FreeSync or G-SYNC, and then 
you’ll need the corresponding vendor’s 
graphics card to enable the technology. 
If you can stomach the startup cost, 
then the end result is eye-popping. 
It’s truly the best experience for those 
who’re serious about improving the look 
and feel of their everyday gaming. 
AMD’s Affordable Alternative
Enhanced Sync is a little different. 
Enhanced Sync is designed to 
minimize screen tearing while 
decreasing latency and stuttering at 
an unlocked frame rate. Perhaps the 
best part about Enhanced Sync is that 
it’s a driver-based feature available 
The Expensive Solution
AMD and NVIDIA both have their 
own take on what’s generically referred 
to as dynamic refresh rates. Effectively 
what this technology does is rescind 
the monitor’s authority over how often 
the screen refreshes and gives it to the 
graphics card, the actual component 
that knows when frames are ready to be 
drawn to the screen. 
“I think a lot of gamers know how 
smooth PC gaming can be when 
they hit that magical 60fps or 120fps 
threshold, and it’s like everything 
gets amazingly buttery smooth,” says 
Hallock. “Now imagine that amazing, 
buttery smoothness at virtually any 
frame rate, with no tearing, no VSync 
stutter, or no VSync input lag ever 
again. That’s what AMD FreeSync 
is like. It’s impossible to convey on-
camera, but it’s really life-changing for 
someone like me who plays games a 
ton. There’s no chance I would ever 
go back to an ordinary monitor. 
Getting pristinely smooth and low-
latency gameplay, even at 33fps, is not 
something I’d trade for anything.”
Input latency is an important metric for competitive games and highly skilled gamers. 
CPU  /  December2017 37

impacted the smoothness of the 
game under each setting, but without 
looking at a plot, we’re only able to 
give you averages. After comparing the 
plots, it appears as though Enhanced 
Sync had the lowest average frame 
time, right at 16.2ms. With VSync 
turned off, the average crept upward 
to 17ms. With VSync on, frame times 
took a hard hit, to the tune of 17.7ms. 
Tear-Free
At the end of the day, the difference 
we experienced with Enhanced 
Sync is not jaw-dropping, but it did 
significantly reduce stutter, which 
is just as jarring as the tearing that 
VSync sets out to eliminate in the 
first place, if not more so. What’s even 
more difficult to track is input latency. 
We all know that VSync is terrible 
for input latency when the frame rate 
exceeds the monitor’s refresh rate, but 
Overwatch players will see up to 34% 
faster response time and significantly 
less tearing. Other competitive games 
offer similar results, making Enhanced 
Sync a no-brainer for those who loathe 
tearing as much as we do. ■
Windows 10 Enterprise. The monitor we 
used was the 60Hz Samsung U28E590D.
Our first test was to run the game 
with VSync turned off. While the 
test was running, frame rates hovered 
between 40fps and 65fps. We noticed 
some occasional tearing in the trees 
and buildings, both at the higher and 
lower frame rates. At the end of the 
run, we achieved a score of 7,215, with 
an average of 60fps. The second test 
we ran with VSync turned on, and 
as you’d expect, tearing was gone, 
but we did witness some mild stutter 
throughout the run. For this one, 
we achieved a 6,906 score, with an 
average of 57fps. Finally, we turned on 
Enhanced Sync from the AMD Radeon 
Software utility. We didn’t notice any 
tearing and there seemed to be less 
stuttering overall. The test resulted in a 
7,245 score, with an average framerate 
of 60fps. 
If our impressions sound vague and 
even a little subjective, that’s because 
trying to describe smoothness with 
the help of benchmarks numbers is 
difficult at best. We did use a frame 
time-capturing utility to do a more 
in-depth analysis of how that metric 
tearing but introducing stuttering 
at refresh rates of 144Hz and lower. 
Above that, VSync minimizes tearing, 
but introduces input latency. Those 
twitch shooters we mentioned above? 
They often run at high refresh 
rates, so this latency can be a real 
deal-breaker. 
Enhanced Sync is another step in 
the right direction, providing a better 
experience at low refresh rates where 
it allows some tearing but significantly 
less stutter. Above 144Hz, Enhanced 
Sync delivers lower latency, but 
functions similar to VSync in terms of 
eliminating same screen tearing.
FreeSync is still the pinnacle of 
syncing technologies for AMD GPU 
users, offering low latency, minimal 
tearing, and decreased stutter between 
the monitor’s stated FreeSync range, 
up to 30Hz and 240Hz. But Enhanced 
Sync is designed to work in concert 
with FreeSync, by eliminating tearing 
when the refresh rate exceeds the 
FreeSync monitor’s upper refresh 
rate limit.

H.R. Giger 
Necronomicon
Christianson says he originally built the rig for Thermaltake 
to use in its booth at Computex 2017, but now uses it as 
his personal gaming rig. Incidentally, this is Christianson’s 
fifth appearance in MRM, tied only by Brian “Boddaker” 
Carter and surpassed only by Bill “Mnpctech” Owen’s nine 
appearances.
That Is Not Dead Which Can Eternal Lie
Located in Vancouver, Washington, Christianson’s Blue 
Horse Studios (www.bluehorse-studios.com) creates clay 
forms and molds, airbrushed art and vinyl graphics, and of 
course modded PCs. Christianson says he spent a couple 
months just doing research on Giger’s work in preparing for 
this mod, and then another three months of work to build 
it. “I made several design changes along the way and painted 
the entire piece two to three times to find the best color 
scheme,” he says.
The Necronomicon began life as a Thermaltake Tower 
900 case, but it was in for some dramatic . . . updates. “I 
gutted the interior and removed all the drive cages that I 
wouldn’t need,” says Christianson. “Next, I sanded the case 
completely down so the clay would bond well to the body of 
the chassis. I started sculpting all my detail pieces into foam, 
then covered them in Magic-Sculpt and added finer details. I 
E
xactly one year ago, Ron Lee Christianson garnered his 
fourth “Mad Reader Mod” win with his amazing Aliens 
mod, and most fans of the Alien movie franchise are aware 
that the design of the titular xenomorph came from the mind of 
one Hans Ruedi “H.R.” Giger.
“The Zurich-based artist was best known for airbrush 
images of humans and machines linked together in a cold 
“biomechanical” relationship,” Christianson says. “Later he 
abandoned airbrush work for pastels, markers, and ink. He was 
part of the special-effects team that won an Academy Award for 
design work on the film ‘Alien.’
Now Christianson is back in the pages of CPU with another 
Giger-inspired mod, the H.R. Giger Necronomicon. “I took a lot 
of inspiration from Giger’s work to build this PC,” Christianson 
says. “I watched his documentary ‘Dark Star’ several times, 
researched his sketches, paintings, and sculptures, and tried my 
best to emulate his style in this mod. Inspiration comes from 
everywhere for me, especially from other creative people.”
The real-life “H.R. Giger’s Necronomicon” was a bound 
collection of Giger’s art, published in 1977, whose title was 
undoubtedly an homage to the mysterious book mentioned several 
times in H.P. Lovecraft’s various works. “Alien” director Ridley 
Scott apparently saw the book before hiring the Swiss artist to 
design the monster that launched six (and counting) movies.

wired in all my accent lights, applied vinyl to the glass, and 
finished it all off with a custom paint job.”
The other parts beneath the Necronomicon’s grim, 
otherworldly exterior include an Intel Core i7-6700K, a 
GIGABYTE Z270X Designare motherboard, 32GB of 
HyperX DDR4 memory, a pair of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 
1080 Founders Edition graphics cards, a Thermaltake 1200-
watt power supply, a 240GB HyperX solid-state drive, and 
a 6TB WD hard drive for storage. The cooling subsystem 
consists of Thermaltake radiators, fittings, and fans, plus a 
Thermaltake pump, a Thermaltake reservoir, and Thermaltake 
PETG hard tubing.
Not To Beat A Blue Horse
As we are wont to do, we asked Christianson about his 
upcoming project (or projects in this case); “I have several on the 
bench that are in various stages of the build process. One of them 
is for the new Destiny 2 game and another based on the Netflix 
series ‘Stranger Things.’ I’m under NDA on the others and can’t 
share at this time.”
Christianson also tells us that he’s working on getting regular 
content up on his YouTube channel again (www.youtube.com/
user/RONLEEC1; there are already more than 30 excellent 
modding-related videos on the channel, including several that 
chronicle work on his Overwatch, Alien, and Biohazard mods). 
“My idea is to create a vlog-style video series. Life as an artist, 
sculptor, and PC modder. I’m shooting video now on all the 
projects I currently have going.” ■

LANFest NETWAR 33.0
Omaha’s Favorite LAN 
Hits The Mark
On Friday, October 6, we headed about 45 miles northeast of our offices to The Mark, an entertainment complex 
featuring bowling, laser tag, an arcade, sports courts, and more, to attend LANFest NETWAR 33.0. The LAN began at 
7 p.m. that day, and ran for 26 hours through to 9 p.m. Saturday, October 7. The Mark was bustling with activity, as 
NETWAR had sold just about 450 seats, and as we arrived the parking lot was full of folks rounding up their PCs and 
gear and lugging them into the BYOC.
We headed in and got set up, then proceeded to game for most of the 26 hours, with a few breaks to eat, sleep for a 
bit, and watch Dave Cathey’s tutorial on converting an AIO CPU cooler into a custom loop. Oh, and we judged a mod 
contest, too; read on to find out more.
Here’s a look at just a few of the trophies up for grabs at NETWAR,

Mod Contest
There were a slew of impressive rigs at NETWAR this go-round, including an excellent mod that won our contest back in April and a new winner by a modder 
who won last year with another mod. For starters, we got another great look at Joshua Judy’s Thermaltake small form factor case, with custom acrylic inserts 
in between the front panel and the frame, as well as custom feet, excellent cabling, and an immaculate liquid-cooling system. The winning mod was another 
small form factor rig, this one from Omaha modder Ben Smits. Unlike his winning rig from a year ago that was housed in a Thermaltake Core P5 and therefore 
had plenty of room to stretch out and tastefully arrange all of his components, Smits’ new project was built inside a Corsair Carbide Series Air 240, and 
required quite a bit of doing to pack everything in. Smits still managed to make everything look great, of course, and did some custom painting here and there 
to add to his white and blue theme. Also, there’s Pikachu.
Smits stands by his trophy and the sweet Phanteks Enthoo Evolv 
ATX that he also won for taking top honors in the NETWAR 33.0 
mod contest. Below and right, the winning rig.
Judy’s mod (below) wasn’t eligible to win as it won our contest back 
in April, but we had to show it off again. This is a great example of 
starting with a stock case and making a few very significant changes 
to create a whole new look. It’s also a textbook example of how to 
use color, manage cables, and build a great custom cooling loop.

GIGABYTE, In Win, etc. He was 
talking about the fitting stopper, a 
piece that lets you simulate the depth 
of a fitting when you’re measuring 
everything on the bending plate.
Q
: The manual for the Eiskoffer 
kit is really well done, with lots 
opposing directions. What items in the 
Eiskoffer kit make this easier?
EP
: That totally depends on how 
and what you’re bending. The kit 
has a variety of mandrels for bending 
different angles. The measuring kit is 
fantastic for measuring out everything 
beforehand and setting up the correct 
angles on the bending plate. The 
numerous mandrels and stoppers are 
immensely helpful there. The flex 
mandrels even make it possible to go 
beyond standard angles and create your 
own. The 45- and 90-degree mandrels 
can be used to bend angles not only on 
a flat plane, but also vertically.
Q
: We know this kit is fairly new 
(we only just saw it in June at 
I
n this installment of “In The Loop,” 
we spoke with Alphacool’s Eddy 
Peters to register our unabashed 
approval of the Alphacool Eiskoffer 
Professional Bending & Measuring Kit. 
Whether you’re just starting out or an 
old hand at hard-tube bending, this 
kit can help you take your watercooled 
build to the next level. 
Q
: To our somewhat trained eye, it 
really looks like you’ve managed to 
pack in just about every tool a serious 
bender would need. When developing 
this product, did Alphacool gather a 
lot of feedback from users about which 
tools this kit should include?
EP
: Because we actually use a lot 
of our products ourselves, and 
many of us have modded PCs at home, 
we had a pretty good knowledge base 
for developing the set. That allowed 
us to develop the foundation fairly 
quickly and build a prototype. Then 
we gathered feedback from modders 
who got to work with the prototype kit 
directly. That was really important for 
us, because as developers we sometimes 
can’t see the forest for the trees. It paid 
off in the end, because we were able to 
improve a number of things and add a 
few things that we hadn’t thought of 
at first. Experienced modders have a 
totally different perspective on these 
kinds of products. Since then, we’ve 
added two experienced modders to our 
team full-time, and they’re helping us 
create new products and advising the 
other modders among us.
Q
: When we were first starting out, 
one of the more difficult things to 
get right was bending a tube in multiple

can be screwed to the bending plate so 
you can just attach the corresponding 
bending radii right next to it. For 
beginners, though, I’d recommend just 
measuring one straight section and one 
angle at a time. That’s usually enough 
for standard systems anyway. But you 
have the option to do more with it if 
you want to.
Q
: Really, how hard would it have 
been to include a heat gun? 
EP
: In theory, that would certainly 
have been possible in some way 
or another. But in the end, there were 
two things stopping it. We wanted 
to keep the price of the kit below a 
certain point, which would have been 
impossible with a heat gun. A heat 
gun also takes up a lot of space, and 
you can see that the kit is already 
pretty big and pretty full. We would 
have ended up with a massive space 
problem or been forced to remove 
some other pieces. And ultimately, a 
lot of people already have a heat gun 
in their workshop at home. Those 
people would have been forced to 
pay extra for another heat gun if we’d 
included one.
Q
: What size hard tubes does the 
Eiskoffer kit support and why? Are 
there plans to support other pipe sizes 
down the road?
EP
: Right now, we don’t have 
any plans for other sizes. We 
looked very carefully at which sizes 
are the most common on the market. 
That’s the 12mm, 13mm, and 16mm 
outer diameter hard tubes. Smaller or 
larger hard tubes are basically non-
existent, or they’re a very small niche, 
at least. Most users work with 12mm 
or 13mm hard tubes. Even the 16mm 
ones are comparatively rare. Looking 
at that, we just don’t see any need for 
other sizes. ■
have places in your system where 
standard 45- or 90-degree angles just 
don’t work, which would generally leave 
you only the option of working in some 
adaptors. But with the flex mandrels, 
I can create my own custom angle. I 
could have my angle start at 25 degrees, 
for example, and then transition into 
a brief straight section and end with 
a 70-degree angle. They’re especially 
helpful for smaller cases where every 
centimeter counts.
Q
: Those just starting out can 
easily get overwhelmed by the 
need for taking precise measurements 
to properly bend hard tubes. What 
features of the Eiskoffer are designed to 
make the measuring process easier?
EP
: The measuring kit gives you 
complete freedom to measure 
everything perfectly. The rulers can be 
connected to one another so that you 
can measure not just length but also 
angles at the same time. You even can 
even measure more than one length 
and angle at a time. The whole thing 
of detailed descriptions of the parts 
and illustrations to help newbies 
understand exactly how each one 
works. How important was getting the 
manual right to Alphacool?
EP
: It was very important to us 
to include a good handbook. 
We didn’t want to cater to just the 
professionals; we wanted to help 
amateurs bend perfect hard tubes, too. 
In general, there’s a lot of respect for 
hard-tube bending since it’s not an 
easy process at first glance. But with 
some familiarization and the right 
instructions, it’s actually pretty simple. 
But creating a handbook that explained 
all the pieces and functions as clearly as 
possible was anything but simple, hence 
the many pictures.
Q
: Many of the mandrels included in 
the kit are fairly self-explanatory, but 
can you describe a scenario where a user 
would want to use the flex mandrels?
EP
: The flex mandrels are my 
personal favorite. Often you’ll

CULLINAN MX 
Rosewill Gives Builders A Clear Choice
our high-end 
hardware. As 
soon as it seems 
like we’ve seen 
every possible 
exterior aesthetic 
or internal design, 
a new case comes 
along and pushes 
a boundary or two 
a little further.
Consider the 
C U L L I N A N 
MX ’s panels. 
For a few years, 
tempered glass 
panels have been 
a popular choice 
for builders who 
want to put their 
system’s internals 
on display, but 
usually cases 
will offer such 
a panel only for 
the left side of the 
chassis. Rosewill, 
by comparison, 
practically wraps 
the CULLINAN 
MX in tempered 
glass. In addition 
to the left side 
p a n e l ,  
t h e 
front and right 
side panels are 
also tempered glass. By tripling-down on 
tempered glass panels, the CULLINAN MX 
puts a build’s components in the spotlight 
from virtually any angle. Naturally, you’d 
better bring your A+ wire management 
game, since many of us rely on a solid right 
side panel to cover up lackadaisical cabling. 
The CULLINAN MX gives builders a 
helping hand in that regard, with a cable 
E
very power user has a slightly different 
way of making a statement. For those 
of us who like to let our skills on a 
virtual battlefield do the talking, nothing 
speaks volumes as much as an impressive 
in-game maneuver or amazing win 
streak. Others may instead choose to run 
up the score on HWBot’s leaderboards, 
demonstrating their overclocking acumen. 
And of course, plenty of enthusiasts try to 
wow their peers with an outlandish, eye-
popping PC, a visual stunner.
If you’re in the last camp, the proper 
case can serve as the foundation for a good-
looking build. For example, when you go 
to the trouble of an immaculate cable job 
or elaborate custom liquid-cooling loop, 
your case should give you the option to 
show off that hard work. It never hurts 
when the case itself is a sight to behold.
Rosewill understands these things 
quite well and puts all of them into 
practice with its nifty new chassis, the 
CULLINAN MX. Wikipedia warriors, 
we’ll save you the trouble of another 
excursion: The Cullinan Diamond, 
unearthed in 1905, remains the largest 
gem-quality rough diamond discovered. It 
produced a number of finished diamonds, 
including the Great Star of Africa, a 530-
carat monster that’s currently seated in the 
Sovereign’s Sceptre with Cross (which is 
part of the Crown Jewels of the United 
Kingdom). In other words, the Cullinan 
Diamond brings the bling, and the 
CULLINAN MX follows suit. 
Transparent Ambition
When we think about hardware 
evolution, usually new CPU or GPU 
architectures, next-gen SSD controllers, and 
high-speed DRAM come to mind. Over 
the years, though, manufacturers have 
continued innovating with PC cases, too, 
regularly turning out high-end boxes for 
management channel that runs along the 
right edge of the motherboard tray. Most of 
the case’s drive bays are tucked behind the 
PSU shroud or motherboard tray, which 
further supports an uncluttered interior.
See The Light
At this point, LED lighting is no 
longer a “secret weapon” that a single 
Feast your eyes on Rosewill’s new midtower, the CULLINAN MX. Rosewill saw 
fit to bestow the case with not one, two, or even three, but four RGB LED fans. 
And with a trio of tempered glass panels (front, left, and right), the CULLINAN 
MX gives builders every opportunity to show off their systems.
CPU  /  December2017 49

but the best LED-laden hardware also 
provides the ability to control those 
LEDs. The level of control varies from 
manufacturer to manufacturer and 
component type to component type, 
naturally, but we always prefer having 
additional dials to turn and buttons to 
press—the more ways we can tweak our 
PCs, the better.
Rosewill delivers control for the 
CULLINAN MX’s RGB LED fans in the 
form of a remote control. The small remote 
has 17 buttons, including eight static color 
buttons, that let you easily change a host 
of settings related to the fans. In addition 
to quickly punching in the eight solid 
colors, the remote can adjust the LEDs’ 
brightness and cycle through each color. In 
addition to the cycle button, the remote’s 
right column has buttons for the following 
pre-programmed effects: Rainbow, 
Gradient, Blade, and Breath. Temporarily 
overwhelmed with the CULLINAN MX’s 
light show? The remote also lets you turn 
off the LEDs.
More Than A Pretty Face
Tempered glass panels and a quartet of 
LED fans certainly make the CULLINAN 
MX easy on the eyes, and the included 
remote gives users the ability to quickly 
change up their case’s look. Beyond all 
the flash, though, enthusiasts need 
a chassis that can make their hardware 
dreams a reality. From top to bottom, and 
front to back, the CULLINAN MX has 
accommodations for A-list components.
So far, we’ve focused on the 
CULLINAN MX’s LED fans, but you’ll 
also find a foundation for an absurdly 
powerful cooling subsystem. Up top, 
take your pick of liquid or air: You can 
install a pair of 120mm or 140mm fans or 
instead mount a radiator up to 280mm. If 
your liquid-cooling ambitions are grander 
than that, the CULLINAN MX will also 
support a radiator up to 360mm attached 
along the front of the chassis. Finally, 
the case’s PSU shroud has a functional 
element, as it has three 80mm fan mounts. 
In sum, the CULLINAN MX can be 
stocked with as many as nine fans, not 
including any that might be bolted onto 
manufacturer has used to gain an edge 
over the competition. Recognizing that 
lots of enthusiasts enjoy adding a little 
shine to their systems, companies are 
putting LEDs on everything.
The CULLINAN MX is no exception. 
Rosewill pre-installs four 120mm RGB 
LED fans in the case, so the tempered glass 
panels are an obvious advantage. The left 
side panel provides a clear view of the RGB 
LED rear fan (not to mention any other 
LED components in a system, which, based 
on our previous statement, are basically 
guaranteed to be present), but the real 
excitement happens up front. A trio of three 
of RGB LED fans effectively makes the 
CULLINAN MX’s front panel a tall stack 
of transfixing LED light. If you’re looking 
for ways to get LAN party passersby to 
notice your rig, there aren’t too many better 
starting points than these LED fans.
Remote Possibilities
An astute power user knows that 
jamming a bunch of LEDs into a 
component might give it some appeal 
a CPU cooler. And while we’re on the 
subject of CPU coolers, the CULLINAN 
MX has clearance for towering CPU 
heatsinks—up to 6.9 inches. Installing 
a massive CPU cooler is child’s play, 
too, because the CULLINAN MX’s 
motherboard tray has a gigantic cutout to 
give you access to the back side of your 
motherboard’s CPU socket.
Speaking of gigantic, the CULLINAN 
MX has room for graphics cards up to 14.1 
inches long. Whether you’ve been eyeing an 
NVIDIA GeForce 10 Series GPU or one 
of AMD’s potent Radeon RX Vega cards, 
the CULLINAN MX gives either plenty 
of space, including, of course, additional 
expansion slots for multiple cards.
Rosewill rounds out the CULLINAN 
MX with the essentials we’ve come to 
expect from high-quality cases. There are 
dust filters on the top and bottom panels, 
and the usual front panel loadout (two 
USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and 
headphone and mic jacks) also includes a 
fan controller. For anyone who wants to 
create a “booth-worthy” build that doubles 
as a fire-breathing PC, the CULLINAN 
MX is a brilliant option. ■

Brandon “gnarkillin” McCarthy made it into the pages of CPU by winning first place at the Modders-Inc.com U.S. 
Case Modding Championship at QuakeCon in back-to-back years. His first win was for his White Widower mod, 
which won in the contest’s Case Mod category, and this past year his Project Breadbox mod won the Scratch Build 
category. Project Breadbox also appeared on GeForce Garage. McCarthy’s journey as a modder has led him to learn 
metalworking and advanced woodworking techniques, among other things, and his builds are characterized by clean, 
precise modifications and attention to detail.
Modder Q&A: Brandon McCarthy
Modding With Brute Force 
(& Lots Of TLC)
Q
: How’s your finger? [McCarthy 
nearly severed his index finger 
when working on Project Breadbox!]
A: 
[Laughs] My finger is doing quite 
well! It looks a little narrower at the 
tip, but I have full use of the finger. Even 
the nerve endings grew back. It’s a little 
weird reflecting back on the accident, but 
I’m fortunate to not have lost the finger. 
Be safe out there, modders!
or eight. Most of those represent around 
20 hours of work. I would say I have 
done four mods that are more than 40 
to 60 hours. I’ve talked with Daniel, at 
Singularity Computers, about possibly 
taking on a few overflow projects, but I’m 
hoping I can start building up enough 
attention to attract a few client builds of 
my own.  I also want to try my hand at 
some sponsored builds now that I have 
confidence in my modding abilities. 
Q
: Both times we’ve talked with you 
for “Mad Reader Mod,” you’ve 
mentioned getting inspiration from 
Daniel Cannon of Singularity Computers 
in Australia. How did you become aware 
of Singularity in the first place, and 
what about Cannon’s work most sparked 
your interest?
A: 
I came across Singularity Com-
puters on YouTube when I was 
researching watercooling. At first it was 
his obsession with attention to detail and 
never [cutting corners on] a mod or build, 
for that matter. I immediately connected 
on this point as I am the same way 
when it comes to almost anything I do. 
Sometimes to a fault. Attention to detail 
is what allows builds like his and mine 
to stand out. But what is most inspiring 
about Daniel is his desire to share his 
knowledge freely with those who want to 
learn. Which is yet another characteristic 
that I also pursue in many aspects 
in my life with modding, work, and 
everything in between.  
Q
: We’ve seen two (very nice) mods 
from you so far; how many projects 
have you built now, altogether?
A: 
Well I’ve only been at this for 
two years now, but if you count 
builds that have had a modification of 
any kind, the number is around seven 
McCarthy with his Project Breadbox scratch build.
CPU  /  December2017 51

cooling loops, or do you bend freehand 
and why?
A: 
I have not used mandrels for 
bending and mainly because I 
haven’t yet had the need to buy them. 
I’ve been able to create super-clean 
90- and 45-degree bends freehand. 
Freehand is faster, as you don’t have 
to set up the mandrels on the board. 
Also, for standard runs with one or 
two bends, I can usually get them right 
the first try. I have some measuring 
techniques that help with the accuracy 
of the bends. 
Q
: How much time would you 
estimate it takes you to cut and 
sleeve a full set of custom cables for 
a build?
A: 
I’ve certainly become more 
efficient each time I do it, but it 
usually takes me around six to 12 hours 
depending on the length and quantity 
of cables that need to be made. More 
time is required to do front panel I/O, 
fans, and other miscellaneous system 
cables. The heatshrinkless method 
goes rather quickly and the process 
of crimping has become virtually 
automatic. I’ll usually sleeve at night 
while watching a movie with my wife 
to help pass the time. It’s quite tedious 
work, but man does it pay off. 
Q
: You’ve talked a little before about 
“Brute Force Modding.” What does 
that mean, and how important is it to 
the overall modding process?
A: 
Brute Force Modding refers to how 
a project evolves throughout the 
building process. Evolving beyond the 
scope of the original design, set before 
construction began. You can sit in front 
of a computer designing for hours on end 
hoping to account for every conceivable 
issue or design feature. But the fact is, 
once you dive into the project there are 
countless situations that force you either 
to work around or change a concept 
completely to make it work. 
Q
: What’s your favorite mod of the 
projects you’ve built so far, and why?
A: 
I would have to say the hardwood 
shell for Project Breadbox. That 
process took months if you include 
the time it takes to acclimate the wood 
to your environment. I built three 
prototypes out of cheaper material before 
I even touched the walnut and maple 
hardwood. Each time, honing my newly 
developed technique for cutting the cope 
(the edge profile that allows the pieces 
to fit together to make a frame around 
a piece of glass or panel). Creating the 
joinery to make the exterior panels was 
more of a challenge because I didn’t use 
a fancy router bit set to cut the coping 
profile. I instead came up with a process 
that uses a table saw with multiple passes 
to create the cope. So, when you mill 
down your hardwood stock, cut your 
joinery, and then have it come together 
like Legos, it’s incredibly gratifying. 
Q
: Do you use mandrels and so forth 
for bending hard tube for your 
Q
: What’s the hardest thing you’ve 
had to do to complete a mod so far, 
and how many tries did it take to get it 
the way you wanted it?
A: 
This is a hard question. “Hard” 
is somewhat relative to me 
depending on something that just takes 
a lot of time and planning vs. having 
to redo a mod because it didn’t come 
out right. For the first, I would say the 
frame for Breadbox was difficult to get 
right. I ended up changing it multiple 
times along the way and ultimately 
rebuilt it from scratch towards the end 
of the project.  But the rebuilt frame 
took a single attempt to get perfect. 
For the latter, I would say having to 
do a complex bend for my Miami 
Hurricanes build was quite a challenge. 
It has six 90-degree bends around 
various components. That one took 
about three or maybe four attempts 
to get right. It would have “worked” 
by the second or third attempt, but it 
wasn’t lined up perfectly with the other 
runs in the build.

of cards, which makes them a fantastic 
option for budget builds and hopefully 
will drive healthy competition between 
the two companies.
3) Case mod or scratch build?
Scratch all the way. Case mods 
are a blast, but creating something 
completely from scratch is far more 
rewarding in the end. However, it does 
take significantly longer to design and 
build a scratch build. But given the 
chance and time, I would pick scratch 
build over case mod. However, if you 
are just getting into modding, I would 
recommend getting your feet wet with 
a case mod. You can still be extremely 
creative without having to worry 
about the basic footprint design. This 
will help to leap you into the hobby, 
allowing you to develop the skills 
required for a scratch build. 
4) Aluminum or wood?
Why not both? I’ve found that wood 
cases catch the eye of a much smaller 
audience than that of your typical large 
metal cases. Personally, I love the raw 
nature of wood with all its character and 
story. When you look at something made 
of wood, it’s easy to forget that it’s not 
just manufactured in a plant but rather 
grown over tens to hundreds of years. 
Molded and shaped by hand and crafted 
by someone with passion. Which is why 
I find working with it so rewarding. 
Aluminum is a great material to work 
with. Easy to cut, drill, bend, and form to 
make shapes and enclosures that are not 
only lightweight, but durable as well. 
5) Rocket League or Overwatch?
Rocket League! I had fun with 
Overwatch for a short time but ultimately 
was not my cup of tea. I found myself 
getting far more salty playing Overwatch 
than Rocket League. I don’t know, there 
is just something about scoring goals in 
RL that is just so rewarding time and time 
again. WOW! WOW! NICE SHOT! ■
on the proper approach. It’s a toss-up 
between a scratch build that would 
be somewhat practical, as far as being 
able to sit on a desk, and the extreme 
of something less practical and in the 
realm of portability. (Hint: VR.)
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions! 
1) Skylake-X or Threadripper?
As I have no experience with 
either CPU, all my opinions would 
be subjective based on reviews from 
reputable tech reviewers. That said, 
I’m going to pick Threadripper for its 
price-to-performance ratio. And Intel 
needs some good competition so they 
can end their complacency in the 
market place.  
2) GeForce or Radeon?
I tend to lean towards Team Green. 
The Pascal line of cards have quite 
a proven track record with not only 
performance, but power efficiency 
as well. I’m excited to see Team Red 
compete in the mid to low-end range 
One approach is to try and rework 
a mod to fit the original concept, 
whereas the alternative is to allow the 
mod to take on its own shape outside 
of the concept. In my experience, the 
latter approach usually turns out better 
than previously expected. That’s what 
I’m calling “Brute Force Modding.” 
Quite literally, it’s just hammering 
through a problem and having 
something cool or not previously 
conceived take shape as a result.
It’s an important process for me 
because it allows my creativity to really 
shine. Many features of my mods are a 
result of this process. 
Q
: You told us in September that 
you were thinking about entering 
the id/Bethesda category for the next 
QuakeCon mod contest; do you have 
any plans that you can talk about 
yet, or can you give us a hint of what 
to expect?
A: 
I have a list of ideas I’m still 
currently trying to choose from. I 
set the bar high for myself with Project 
Breadbox, so I’m struggling to decide 
McCarthy’s Miami Hurricanes build incorporates The U’s school colors, especially in its sleeved cables.

Holiday
Gift Guide
Tech gadgets and gizmos are popular gifts at 
Christmas time, but without guidance, friends and family 
might opt for gimmicky or stocking stuffer-type presents 
that often aren’t as useful as they might think.
We like a Bluetooth speaker in the shape of our favorite dog breed or a USB hub that looks like the Flux Capacitor from “Back to the 
Future” as much as the next guy, but such baubles aren’t the kind of thing power users are likely to use year-round. CPU’s Holiday 
Gift Guide is a list of products that PC enthusiasts should find really worthwhile.
The renewed processor war between AMD and Intel and the tight GPU competition between AMD and NVIDIA make it an exciting 
time for anyone planning a new build. Put simply, it’s even likelier this year that a new system will beat the pants off an aging rig. 
Our gift guide features a good selection of motherboards that support the latest chipsets and the processor of your choice. With a 
new CPU, you might also be considering a CPU cooler upgrade or fresh custom liquid-cooling parts. A variety of cooling goodies 
can be found in the following pages, as well.
Cases have seen a lot of innovation recently, with companies adding classy tempered-glass side panels and LED accent 
illumination. There are five case options in this guide, should you or the power user in your life be looking for a new home to 
showcase components. For those who have already built their new high-end PC, the guide boasts a selection of peripherals that 
would be a nice addition to any build.
We know that building a new PC might not be at the top of everyone’s to-do list at Christmas, so there are also a few full systems 
scattered throughout this guide. We’ve included a laptop, a miniature gaming PC, and a few boutique desktop builds that seriously 
ratchet up the wow factor. Whatever your budget, there’s bound to be something for you or the power users in your life.

Aerocool P7-850W Platinum
$179.99  •  www.aerocool.us
The P7-850W Platinum is an extremely efficient power supply that 
also boasts a 140mm RGB fan that lights up when you connect the 
included 4-pin RGB cable to a motherboard’s RGB header. You’ll 
control the color and effects with the motherboard’s RGB software 
utility. Aerocool knows RGB headers on mainboards are a relatively 
new feature, so they also allow the PSU to work with its P7-H1 fan 
hub—sold separately for $25. The 140mm RGB fan only spins up at 
60% load (510 watts) and even then, the fan only rotates at 500rpm. 
If loads go above 80%, Aerocool engineers the fan to further pick up 
the pace, so it’s likely you’ll only hear the PSU under extreme loads. 
The PSU is extremely efficient at lower power levels to let you enjoy 
power efficient operation at all times. 80 PLUS’ testing report shows 
that the P7-850W Platinum was most efficient (94.08% efficiency) at 
20% load and “dropped” to 92.76% efficiency at 50% load.

Retro Killer Apps: Where Are They Now?
I
n our time with these beloved PCs, 
we’ve seen quite a few applications come 
and go. This month, we’re pouring one 
out for those lost utilities from a bygone 
era. Join us as we check in to see if any of 
them still have a pulse or if the user base 
fled for a damn good reason. Whatever 
the case may be, the only constant is that 
software is always changing; those apps 
you rely on now, may be destined for the 
Recycle Bin too. 
ICQ
In the mid ‘90s there were only a handful 
of messaging utilities that had managed to 
accrue a large enough user base to take off, 
and Mirabilis’ ICQ (icq.com/windows/en) 
was the big one. The messaging application’s 
name was the phonetic abbreviation for 
“I seek you,” and it launched in 1996 as 
the first stand-alone instant messenger and 
instant messaging service. Instead of user-
defined usernames, ICQ users were assigned 
a five-digit UIN (User Identification 
Number), which you needed to swap with 
fellow users in order to chat. ICQ’s iconic 
“uhoh” sound, which signaled the arrival of 
a new message, is sure to turn the head of 
anyone who used the software in its heyday. 
Where Is It Now? ICQ is still a 
communications app that works on PC, 
Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, 
but you probably wouldn’t recognize it 
in its current state. It was sold to AOL 
in 1998, which signaled its slow decline 
against AIM, the firm’s in-house 
competitor. In 2010 ICQ was sold 
again, this time to the Mail.Ru Group, 
the company behind some of Russia’s 
biggest social networks. An interesting 
aside: Mail.Ru’s founder, Yuri Milner, was 
instrumental in assisting Russian state 
organizations with lucrative Facebook 
and Twitter investments. Milner is also a 
known friend of Mark Zuckerberg and 
a business associate of President Donald 
Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
AIM (AOL Instant Messenger)
America Online was one of the first 
Internet service providers, and its 
integrated messaging client, abbreviated 
AIM (www.aim.com), became a 
standalone application in 1997. AIM 
users were called buddies, and its yellow 
“running man” icon was one of the most 
likely shortcuts to be found on a PC’s 
desktop dating from the late ‘90s to mid-
2000s. AIM Express was the web-based 
utility that ran in a browser popup, and 
it was ideal for those who didn’t want or 
couldn’t install the standalone client, which 
was plagued by security vulnerabilities 
toward the end of its popularity. Major 
competitors in its heyday include Yahoo! 
Messenger and MSN Messenger. 
Where Is It Now? AIM’s appeal 
remained fairly high until 2011, when 
much of its user base migrated to Google’s 
Gmail and Gchat alternatives. In a move 
that was unlikely to reverse its fortunes, 
ad support was integrated just as active

developed in Germany by Marco Börries, 
for an 8-bit microprocessor called the Zilog 
Z80, a chip that was software-compatible 
with the Intel 8080. StarOffice officially 
became a suite for Windows 3.1 in 1994, 
when the word processing utility was 
joined by StarCalc, a spreadsheet utility, 
and StarBase, a database application. In 
1998, as of version 4.2, StarOffice went 
free. A year later, Sun Microsystems paid 
$73.5 million to acquire StarOffice’s 
developer, StarDivision. At the time, a Sun 
employee recalls that a big motivation for 
the acquisition was the fact that it would 
have cost more than $73.5 million for 
Sun to install Microsoft Office on each of 
its 42,000 employees’ Unix workstations 
and Windows laptops. Fuzzy math 
aside, StarOffice 5.2 was the first version 
released as a Sun product in 2000. At this 
time, Sun also released a majority of the 
StarOffice source code as open source, 
which led to the propagation of multiple 
derivatives, including Open Office, Go-oo, 
IBM Workplace, IBM Lotus Symphony, 
NeoOffice, LibreOffice, and Apache 
OpenOffice. In January 2010, Oracle 
bought Sun Microsystems and Star Office 
became Oracle Open Office.

Modern music playing software utilities 
all generally look the same. They’ve got 
streaming radio stations you can customize 
to a lesser or greater degree, there’s an 
optional ad-free subscription service you 
can buy, and every song you hear is just 
a click-and-a-dollar away from being 
yours, for offline enjoyment. Winamp 
(www.winamp.com) was released twenty 
years ago, and it was a simpler time for 
digital music. The only streaming music 
available was midi, and it played back 
on QuickTime. MP3s were synonymous 
with music, and Napster, BearShare, and 
LimeWire were all dedicated to helping 
you amass a personal music library as 
quickly as possible. Music fans didn’t worry 
about whether or not it was legal, just 
whether to rip songs at 128 or 96Kbps.

Nullsoft’s premier product, the brainchild 
of Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev. 
Two years after its launch, Nullsoft

renamed Netscape Navigator following 
a dispute with the University of Illinois 
over the Mosaic name, which it gave to 
the source code licensed to the fledgling 
company. Despite a press release stating 
that Netscape Navigator version 1.1 would 
be free for non-commercial users, this was 
altered just prior to the release to be free 
only for academic institutions and non-
profit organizations. Around a year after 
the browser’s launch, the utility became 
free for non-commercial use and user 
adoption skyrocketed. With the help of 
ISPs and computer magazine publishers, 
Netscape Navigator became the go-to-web 
browser. Netscape also had an edge over 
other browsers of the time due to its ability 
to display text and graphics on-the-fly–as 
they loaded–letting users begin reading 
text almost immediately. The browser 
also continued to push the web forward, 
innovating many of the technologies we 
take for granted today, including support 
for frames and JavaScript. Much to the 
chagrin of privacy advocates, Netscape also 
pioneered the use of cookies. Later versions 
of Netscape Navigator incorporated 
email, a news reader, and a WYSIWYG

Microsoft Encarta
When you bought a new PC in the 
early ‘90s, chances were good that it came 
bundled with a CD-ROM for Microsoft’s 
digital multimedia encyclopedia, 
Encarta. The first edition launched in 
1993, following a bid Microsoft made 
for the content of Funk & Wagnalls 
Encyclopedia. To help bolster the variety 
of articles included, Microsoft bought 
Collier’s Encyclopedia and New Merit 
Scholar’s Encyclopedia in the latter part 
of the decade. The first edition was a 
prohibitively expensive $395, but latter 
versions sold for $99. In 2000, Microsoft 
put Encarta online, charging a subscription 
fee for full access, but leaving a portion of 
the more than 60,000 articles visible to 
anyone, free. Encarta’s UI consisted of a 
web browser-like layout, with text search 
box on the top and a handful of general 
subject buttons below, including History,

had two purposes, to help people feel 
less intimidated by Microsoft’s new GUI, 
and to help introduce them to various 
mouse-usage techniques, including 
right- and left-clicking, and dragging and 
dropping. With Windows Vista and 7, 
Solitaire was upgraded with stats on win 
percentages, mid-game pause and resume 
functionality, and a selection of optional 
card backs to choose from. With the 
launch of Windows 8 in 2012, Solitaire 
was given a visual overhaul by developer 
Arkadium and rereleased as the Microsoft 
Solitaire Collection, which featured ads.

its most up-to-date build, does not ship

repetitive sound effects. If you’re looking 
for that “classic” Windows Solitaire

Adblock Plus has expanded to every major

the Web Extensions framework. As a result, 
users will likely notice several UI changes, 
such as the ABP icon in the toolbar showing 
the number of blocked ads and the toolbar 
icon opening a pop-up menu rather than a 
native menu. Even if you’re not wild about 
the revamped UI elements, you should be

Skype, etc.) to use. After hitting the big 5-0, 
Franz went open source, as the source code

fixes a single bug—a problem with multiple 
close handlers stopping the program from

updates have been more substantial. Beta 12 
added a menu item to toggle dev tools and 
squashed just over a half dozen bugs, while 
Beta 11 gave users the option to disable

SOFTWARE UPDATES
Core Temp 1.11
For obtaining CPU core temperatures 
quickly and easily, Core Temp is hard to 
beat. The first update since August, version 
1.11 adds support for a ton of processors, 
including the following: AMD Naples-based 
EPYC CPUs and Stoney Ridge APUs, and 
Intel’s Coffee Lake, Denverton, and Gemini 
Lake chips. A number of fixes are also 
included in the new version. In particular, 
several generations of AMD CPUs were 
experiencing recognition issues, and Core 
Temp would occasionally report incorrect 
maximum temps on some AMD processors 
when other hardware-monitor software 
was also running. A problem with power 
detection on multiprocessor Intel systems has 
also been fixed.

CrystalDiskMark 6.0.0
A mainstay among SSD enthusiasts and 
here at CPU, CrystalDiskMark gives your 
solid-state drive a workout and then gives 
you the results. Along with version 5.5.0, 
which was released at the end of October, 
version 6.0.0 is the first big update in over a 
year, and it makes a fairly significant change. 
Perhaps sensing the obsolescence of its basic 
sequential test, CrystalDiskMark 6.0.0 axes 
it completely. In its place is a brand-new 
test: 4KiB Q8T8. (That’s a queue depth of 
8 and eight threads.) The changes represent 
a frankly long overdue shift away from 
sequential performance to focus on random 
performance; CrystalDiskMark’s newest 
battery of tests includes only one sequential 
test (QD32T1) and three random tests.

Rise Of The Chatbots 
How Robots Are Inserting Themselves Into Our Conversations
says Yan Georget, co-founder of Botfuel 
(botfuel.io), a Paris-based startup that 
builds chatbots capable of filling serval 
roles (conversational commerce, customer 
support, etc.) and serving businesses with 
enormous audiences.
Toppling The Turing Test
Efforts to develop an AI that can 
successfully pass itself off as a genuine 
human being have existed almost as long 
as computer programming itself. Briefly, 
a computer passes the Turing test when 
a person is unable to determine whether 
they are conversing with another person 
or a computer. Of course, the person 
doesn’t actually see who’s doing the 
there were almost 2.8 million customer 
service jobs in the United States. And, 
of course, these are just the workers who 
are exclusively involved with providing 
customer service; think of all the other 
jobs that regularly require customer 
interaction. Turning over some of those 
interactions to a capable AI is a money-
saving measure plenty of businesses have 
been happy to embrace.
Chatbots are already here. Maybe you’ve 
“talked” to one today. As programmers 
continue to make strides, expect machines 
to ask some variation of “How can I help 
you?” in a variety of new situations.
“Chatbots are going to be less and less 
rigid and more and more conversational,” 
E
verywhere you look you can see the 
signs of our future robot overlords 
preparing for “Phase 2.” As self-driving 
cars and their integrated AIs continue to 
advance, driverless vehicles will become 
more than a useful tool for Google or 
a neat parlor trick your Tesla-owning 
“friend” likes to show off any chance he 
gets. Before long your Uber driver will 
simply be the smartphone, rather than 
someone using a smartphone for driving 
directions. For its fourth birthday, Boston 
Dynamics’ Atlas robot recently jumped 
across boxes, spun around 180 degrees in 
a midair leap, and then did a backflip for 
good measure. As soon as it picks up an 
Austrian accent and biker leather, we’re all 
basically doomed.
Irrational and exaggerated fears of a 
Skynet takeover aside, jobs, tasks, and 
responsibilities that humans have had 
for years upon decades upon centuries 
continue being ceded to machines. 
Working professionals’ biggest worry 
shouldn’t be Barry, the hard-charging 
intern who’s gone from serving coffee 
to setting sales records. Now, just about 
everyone needs to ask themselves, “Can 
an algorithm do my job?”
Beyond self-driving semis and acro-
batic automatons, AI has made steady 
advancements in areas that may seem 
simple, even mundane, on the surface but 
can be quite complicated. We’re talking 
about talking. Distilling the nuances of 
human conversation down to lines of 
code is a challenging task, and most of the 
time we know when we’re on the phone 
with a computer, despite its protestations 
to the contrary.
Still, the automation of conversation 
will continue, and it will continue to 
have an economic impact. For example, 
according to the U.S. Department 
of Labor’s Bureau of Labor, in 2016 
Robots and AIs have been conversing with people for many years, often to hilarious effect (“Ha! Ha! 
Yes, I am a real person. But now can we talk about your vehicle’s expired warranty?”) but recent 
advancements in chatbots are no laughing matter. New chatbots can help us with a myriad of tasks, 
often basic but occasionally complex, and do so in a conversational fashion that quells some of the 
unease of interacting with a machine. (Image background credit: Brett Jordan, Flickr)

resources into making their respective 
digital assistants (that’s right, Siri, Alexa, 
and Google Assistant are basically 
chatbots) more effective. Amazon, 
as it has done with other technologies 
developed in-house (as you’ll recall, 
Amazon Web Services was borne out 
of the company’s own need for efficient 
compute, storage, and database services), 
has even pointed Alexa’s underlying 
technology outward, so to speak, by 
offering Amazon Lex as a service to other 
companies that need their own chatbot(s). 
As Amazon tells it, “Lex is a service for 
building conversational interfaces using 
voice and text. Powered by the same 
conversational engine as Alexa, Amazon 
Lex provides high-quality speech 
recognition and language understanding 
capabilities, enabling addition of 
sophisticated, natural language ‘chatbots’ 
to new and existing applications.” Lex-
based chatbots have several common uses, 
such as providing information, facilitating 
transactions, controlling electronic 
devices, and more.
Examples of companies using chatbots 
as go-betweens abound. Starbucks gives 
its faithful coffee drinkers the ability to 
order their lattes and espressos by voice 
or text through the Starbucks mobile 
app. The chatbot takes their order and 
informs them when it’s ready. Lyft 
and Uber have chatbots hooked into 
Facebook’s Messenger app (more on 
Facebook Messenger and chatbots later) 
so people looking for a driver can do so 
from within Messenger. Domino’s Pizza 
wisely capitalized on the pizza emoji 
and pushed easy pizza ordering out to a 
bunch of platforms, including Twitter, 
Facebook Messenger, and Slack, as well 
as the company’s in-app chatbot, named 
“Dom.” Other chains, such as Pizza 
Hut, have followed suit with their own 
chatbots. Zhou believes chatbots will 
continue to permeate domestic life.
“We at TOPBOTS believe that longer 
term, there will be a conversational aspect 
to everything in our lives,” she says. “We’ll 
expect everything around us to interact 
with us in a natural conversational 
manner, including our TVs, refrigerators, 
need to talk to a company representative 
about simple, routine matters, deploying 
a chatbot can be a big boon. As a result, 
programmers are working overtime to 
tailor chatbots to handle questions, 
requests, and so forth.
“Bots have grown smarter over the 
years as they start to embody more 
artificial intelligence,” says Adelyn 
Zhou, CMO of TOPBOTS (www.
topbots.com), which builds chatbots for 
companies worldwide, but also offers 
related education and consulting services. 
“Companies are adding more advanced 
natural language processing to understand 
the conversational text so that they can 
have more natural conversations with the 
human user. Sometimes, these bots also 
connect to augmented reality and other 
technologies so that they can help you 
[do things like] color-match clothing (for 
example, designing a Nike sneaker based 
on your outfit).”
Indeed, brands big and small have 
mobilized chatbots to assist people. The 
titans of industry—Apple, Amazon, 
Google—have poured considerable R&D 
“talking,” because the conversations are 
text-only.
Although the famed computer 
scientist Alan Turing first presented his 
eponymous test in 1950, his challenge 
flummoxed other programmers for 
decades. In fact, arguably the most 
successful attempt occurred only a few 
years ago, when Eugene Goostman 
wowed judges at a 2014 Turing Test 
competition at the United Kingdom’s 
University of Reading. Don’t bother to 
congratulate Goostman, though, because 
he’s a chatbot. The combined work of 
Vladimir Veselov, Sergey Ulasen, and 
Eugene Demchenko, the Goostman 
chatbot was able to convince a third of 
the event’s judges that he was human. 
Some dispute that Goostman truly passed 
the Turing test, but event organizer Kevin 
Warwick was convinced.
The Modern Chatbot
Not all software developers are inter-
ested in building their own version of 
Eugene Goostman, of course. When 
businesses have customers or users who 
Major companies have jumped on the chatbot wagon, which has led to chatbots being deployed to aid 
customers. From finding a hotel room to skipping the line at your local Starbucks, chatbots are, perhaps 
subtly, reshaping our consumer habits.

and www.myvirtualgirlfriendgame.com,
obviously) are just that, letting you create, 
customize, and then converse with your 
chatbot SO. Conversation is a major 
component of the games, and they boast 
“thousands of lines of clever dialog to 
keep it entertaining.”
Chatbots have clearly gone beyond 
a concierge you can download to your 
phone and have started performing 
roles that used to belong to trained 
professionals, but experts aren’t convinced 
we’re in the midst of a total chatbot 
takeover. “In customer service, there 
will still be humans, but the humans 
will focus on more advanced and harder 
customer service questions,” Zhou says. 
“Bots will handle the easier and more 
mundane questions.”
Georget believes that chatbots are 
an example of a digital revolution that 
will end up creating as many jobs as 
it eliminates. “This is not a new trend 
[related exclusively] to chatbots but 
rather an old phenomenon, [similar to] 
the Industrial Revolution. Generally 
speaking, the use of technology (AI but 
also machines) has a profound impact on 
our jobs. Some jobs will be replaced, but 
some will be created.”
Chat To The Future
As with so many developing and 
cutting-edge technologies, chatbots 
are advancing to the point that certain 
news stories sound more like science 
fiction than reality. For example, in 
Perry Masonry is your responsibility, but 
DoNotPay is at least helping the little guy 
get the legal ball rolling. Browder made no 
bones about wanting DoNotPay’s lawbots 
to put Equifax out of business.
“I hope that my product will replace 
lawyers, and, with enough success, 
bankrupt Equifax,” he told the Verge.
In the healthcare industry, chatbots 
are lending a helping hand to patients, 
providing services that go well beyond 
ELIZA. Florence (www.ﬂorence.chat) can 
do a few things you’d expect of a home 
health nurse, such as remind users to 
take their medication, keep track of a 
small handful of personal health issues, 
provide information about diseases, and 
locate local doctors and pharmacies. 
On the physician side of the equation, 
you have chatbots like SafedrugBot (bit.
ly/2AJvhlI), which can inform doctors 
about prescription drugs and their effects 
on breastfeeding mothers. Avaamo (www.
avaamo.com) does a little of everything, 
such as schedule appointments, set 
up referrals, keep track of insurance 
coverage, and file claims. Plus, it’s 
HIPAA-compliant.
While chatbots like DoNotPay and 
Florence can act as your digital attorney 
and nurse, respectively, other chatbots 
will attempt to be your friend. Explore 
the lighter side of chatbots, and you’ll 
find examples of chatbots attempting 
to be a virtual boyfriend or girlfriend. 
My Virtual Boyfriend and My Virtual 
Girlfriend (myvirtualboyfriendgame.com
billboards, etc.” Suddenly, the thought of 
doing our best Captain Jean-Luc Picard 
impression as we instruct our smart 
beverage brewing machine, “Tea. Earl 
Grey. Hot.” doesn’t seem so farfetched. In 
fact, we may soon rely on chatbots to do a 
lot more than line up dinner and movie, 
plus the ride home.
The Talented Mr. Roboto
Chatbots are clearly helping everyday 
users interface with companies in a 
conversational fashion that doesn’t truly 
involve conversation, at least in the 
traditional sense of person-to-person 
communication. Using robots to book 
a hotel room, send someone flowers, or 
set daily calendar reminders are all fine 
examples of how chatbots can make 
our lives a little easier, but ambitious 
programmers are pushing the boundaries 
of what chatbots can do.
Joshua Browder has marshalled his 
chatbots to serve as digital lawyers. He 
founded his company DoNotPay 
(donotpay.com) in order to let people 
challenge parking tickets online, but 
recently the 30-something entrepreneur 
has set his sights on a bigger target. In the 
wake of the Equifax security breach earlier 
this year, DoNotPay gave people the ability 
to sue Equifax, virtually automatically, in 
small claims court independently of the 
class action suit against the credit bureau. 
The bots prepare the paperwork, but you’ll 
still need to serve them to Equifax, plus 
show up in court. Further, any courtroom

but the humans will focus on more advanced 
and harder customer service questions. Bots 
will handle the easier and more mundane 
questions.”

Japan, seven-year-old Shibuya Mirai was 
recently granted official residency in the 
country, which comes on the heels of 
Saudi Arabia making Sophia the robot 
the country’s first robotic citizen. You 
know by now that Mirai is more closely 
related to Eugene Goostman than 
anyone of Japanese ancestry, because 
he’s just a chatbot. Mirai “lives” inside 
LINE (line.me), a free messaging app, 
and he offers the 220,000+ people of 
Tokyo’s Shibuya district the chance to 
have a conversation, ideally coaxing 
out concerns, complaints, and opinions 
about the area’s local government. Mirai 
and Sophia represent shifting attitudes 
toward artificial intelligence.
With chatbots becoming more 
ingrained in our daily lives, Georget 
and Zhou believe that the burden is on 
developers to train their AIs to speak 
more like humans, rather than expect 
people to reprogram their speech for 
chatbots to understand. “Chatbots should 
train themselves to ‘speak human,’ that is, 
be more conversational,” Georget says.
“The bot should really be the one that 
learns how to better understand human 
conversational language.” Zhou adds. 
“But if forced to communicate with a 
not-so-intelligent bot, the user can use 
simple common words, short phrases 
and clearly identify their pronouns to 
help the bot understand their intent.”
Along with chatbots, and robots in 
general, gaining increased standing in 
society comes the matter of also applying 
human laws, regulations, and standards 
to them. The fact that Avaamo’s developer 
touts its chatbot’s HIPAA compliance is 
evidence that companies will likely need 
to ensure their chatbots don’t skirt the 
legal rules and requirements that their 
human counterparts.
“Chatbots should be given some 
autonomy within a well-defined frame— 
ethical, legal, and financial constraints,” 
says Georget.
As long as chatbots are developed 
responsibly, we’ll have an army of 
conversational helpers that are becoming 
more intelligent with every passing day. 
Now, all we need to do is say, “Hello.” ■
Facebook Fuels The Chatbot Boom
Of all the industry heavyweights turning to chatbots, Facebook is, almost by its raison d’etre,
the most natural fit. Social media is built on communication, and you can be certain that Mark 
Zuckerberg & Co. don’t mind incorporating interpersonal communication into an impersonal 
algorithm. For Facebook, chatbots are where it’s at.
Earlier this year, Facebook made headlines when it pulled the plug on a pair of chatbots that 
appeared to organically develop their own language. Bob and Alice, the two chatbots involved 
in a Facebook experiment, “talked” back and forth with the skill of a toddler, but the fact that 
they were able to independently converse with each other at all was cause for a fair amount 
of robopocalyptic hand-wringing. Soon, Bob and Alice would lead the charge against their 
human masters.
The reality, as it so often is, was far less exciting. Facebook’s coders were working on a chatbot 
capable of learning from human deal making and eventually reproducing the process to a 
degree that felt authentically human. However, they erred in the programming and forgot to 
direct the chatbots to use language the way a human would. Facebook simply took the bots 
offline to fix the problem.
What doesn’t grab as many headlines is the significant effort Facebook has put forth to 
give third-party chatbot developers access to its Messenger platform. According to the 
company, there are already 100,000 active bots running around Messenger, helping people 
with this (find a cosmetics company’s local store and schedule an appointment) or that 
(make a hotel reservation). Messenger chatbots. For businesses that just want a way for 
their customers and clients to make contact, Messenger chatbots are easy, automated 
customer service reps.
Chatbot developers are seizing on the opportunity, too. Yes, it’s possible to build bots directly 
through Facebook’s platform, but there are dozens of available platforms that can also create 
Messenger chatbots, as well as developers who will happily build bots for businesses that 
don’t have the resources or desire to do the job in house.

The Last Medjay
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$59.99   •   ESRB: (M)ature   •   Ubisoft   •   www.ubisoft.com
The ninth main installment in the Assassin’s Creed saga comes after 
a two-year hiatus. As hinted at by the title, this game follows the 
footsteps of the so-called Last Medjay and the first assassin, Bayek of 
Siwa. Although the game goes to great lengths to not mention the “A” 
word, most of Bayek’s missions involve righting various wrongs with 
the tips of arrows or the blade of a sword. 
As in previous Assassin’s Creed games, the setting plays a massive role. 
This time, ancient Egypt is your playground, and the power struggle between 
Cleopatra and her younger brother (and former husband), Pharaoh Ptolemy 
XIII, is the historical backdrop that the main story sneaks up behind and 
stabs with abandon. Speaking of, you won’t be the least bit surprised which 
historical assassination victim arrives on the scene in the latter half of the 
game. If you read a brief synopsis of Cleopatra’s exile and subsequent rise 
to power, just blame everything on the proto-Templars (the Order Of The 
Ancients), and you’ll have a firm grasp on the game’s plot. 
The modern day scenes in the ACO are much fewer and farther between. 
While playing as Bayek, you can jump back to the present day at any time to 
play as Layla Hassan. She’s a spunky intern-level researcher at Abstergo who 
goes rogue and begins exploring the genetic memories of some mummies 
she’s discovered, using her own portable Animus. Outside of a handful of 
seldom events, however, there’s really not much reason to hang out with 
Layla, unless you enjoy reading emails and hacked research notes that are 
the game’s only ties to the characters and events of the previous games.
We’ve said it in reviews of past Assassin’s Creed titles, and it’s true once 
again; the setting is the best part. Ancient Egypt is more vividly recreated 
than in any game you’ve ever played. The endless sand dunes, pyramids 
and hidden tombs, lush oases, Roman and Greek architectural marvels, 
and a menagerie of northern African wildlife, including crocodiles, herons, 
flamingoes, camels, snakes, hyenas, hippos, vultures, and leopards, are 
all thrilling to explore or encounter. There are times when the surrounding 
environment makes a scripted event even more interesting, such as when 
a float of crocodiles decided to attack my enemy just as I did. Other times, it 
gets in the way. Whenever you’re swimming for more than a few seconds, 
a punt appears off screen and veers to cut you off. When I’m stealthily 
approaching a ship of ne’er-do-wells, the last thing I need is a water taxi 
driver spoiling my approach with the Egyptian equivalent of honking his horn. 
Ubisoft has tweaked their open world formula slightly by giving missions 
and enemies a numeric level value. As long as you only engage 
in activities at or near your current level, you’ll get decent XP and 
manageable enemies. Stray into higher-level content, however, and you’ll 
fail spectacularly. This system works until you need to grind to move the 
story forward, which forces you to spend long minutes hovering over 
diamond-shaped quest markers on the map or hours running around 
exposing the multitude of question marks just to find the right missions. To 
make matters worse, most of the side missions are just bland. 
To its credit, however, Bayek is a complex character with a compelling 
backstory, and the world he inhabits is equal parts beautiful and brutal, which 
is everything we want in an Assassin’s Creed game. Getting to ride an 
armored camel into battle is pretty sweet too. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do,

Requesting Permission To 
Beam Aboard
BY VINCE COGLEY
$14.99   •   ESRB: N/A   •   Forever Entertainment
www.prodigythegame.com
For the better part of a decade, toys-to-life videogames, or those that “beam” 
tiny figurines (sold separately, duh) into the game itself have come and gone, 
with varying degrees of success. Disney Infinity closed up shop last year, for 
example, but industry heavyweight Skylanders is still going strong. One thing 
these games have in common is that they tend to capture the hearts and 
minds of younger gamers, in turn capturing their parents’ wallets. 
Hanakai Studio’s (www.hanakai.fr) Prodigy Tactics, which recently 
entered early access after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014, 
gives big kids their own toys-to-life game. The full game, which you 
can preorder, includes a NFC (near-field communication) game board, 
a Symbol of Power, eight NFC cards, and a bundle of three unpainted 
figurines. The figurines themselves look amazingly detailed. We got our 
hands on the digital version of the game (but didn’t get our hands on any 
of the figurines because, as part of the full Prodigy experience, they were 
only available to preorder at the time of this writing) and took it for a spin.
The story, such as it is, isn’t likely to bring home a Hugo Award for the 
French game developer, but it’s at least enough to give you a sense of 
the world Hanakai is creating. You’re transported to the wondrous world 
of Thasys, which used to thrum with Mana (as usual, the gas that makes 
magic possible). As luck would have it, it’s drying up, so Thasys’ less 
savory denizens are willing to go to great lengths—pillage, murder, the 
usual stuff—in order to get another hit of sweet, sweet Mana.
That’s where you come in. Particularly gifted humans (you might say 
they’re prodigies—wink, wink) called Watchers use their powers to beat 
back the monstrous hordes, and they’re yours to command. These unique 
heroes, such as Elae, Illis the Weaver, and Amoa, have short but intriguing 
backstories, which adds a bit of flavor but is unfortunately hardly material 
to the game itself.
No, in Prodigy Tactics, you’re here to do battle and, as the game currently 
stands, that’s about it. At its core, Prodigy Tactics is a turn-based strategy 
game, one that lets you think through your next attack or defense before 
actually plunging headlong into the fray. You place your heroes on a 3x4 
game board, where shuffling them to and from the front and back lines 
affects both the damage they deal and the damage they take. For each 
hero, whether on offense or defense, you can choose to infuse your actions 
with Harmony or Dissonance. Doing so can create corresponding Harmony 
or Dissonance circles on the board, which confer additional combat 
bonuses and/or unlock special abilities (which have their own wicked-cool 
animations that play out like abbreviated Final Fantasy limit breaks). Where 
your heroes stand on the board can also influence what your heroes can 
do. Nothing is very elaborate . . . yet . . . but Hanakai has built a foundation 
that could turn into something excellent.
Naturally, Prodigy Tactics will succeed or fail based on whether the NFC 
game board and figurines catch on. Both of them, by the way, make the 
standalone digital edition’s $15 asking price look like chump change; 
the aforementioned starter pack, which includes the NFC board, three 
figurines, etc. will set you back almost 90 bucks, and individual figurines 
start at roughly $15 (give or take, depending on exchange rates). No one 
can question that Prodigy Tactics is a gorgeous game. We recommend 
keeping an eye on it, but it needs more of everything (heroes, abilities, 
single-player content, etc.) to be a true game changer. ■

Guten Tag!
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature  •   Bethesda
wolfenstein.bethesda.net
In May 2014, Bethesda launched Wolfenstein: The New Order, and 
yea verily, it was good. The game pitted an updated William “B.J.” 
Blazkowicz against the obligatory horde of bloodthirsty Nazi soldiers 
and the nefarious General Wilhelm “Deathshead” Strasse, who in 1961 
forces B.J. (you) to decide which one of your compatriots he murders 
in front of him (you) and which one he spares in a hellish alternate 
universe where the Reich nuked Manhattan and won the war. Your 
choice had a fairly profound effect on the story for the rest of the game, 
including the fact that you were then forced to kill the poor guy again 
near the end when it was revealed that Strasse extracted his brain and 
used it to power a large mecha/robot that promptly attacks you.
At the very end of the game, you triumph over Strasse by perforating 
him with a combat knife like only B.J. Blazkowicz can, but before he 
dies, Strasse arms a grenade that goes off, doing massive damage to 
B.J. and prompting him to radio his team and call for a nuclear strike 
on his position. Death being imminent, B.J. chooses to complete his 
mission despite knowing he won’t escape the blast. 
The brand-new sequel, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, picks right 
up where New Order left off; at the end of the first game you hear a 
helicopter approaching instead of a massive explosion, and it turns out 
that B.J.’s team ignored his orders and sent a chopper to evac him. As 
the game opens, you have been in a coma for five months and are in 
no shape to walk, let alone fight, but the Reich catches up to the Nazi 
sub your team stole and has boarded it. You must take the fight to the 
enemy in a wheelchair, and the game does a great job of using your 
lower viewpoint and limited mobility to create a sense of tension. You 
also get to choose which timeline to continue, based on which of your 
comrades Strasse killed in the previous game, and the continued split 
creates some nice replayability.
Following the opening sub scene, players get to follow B.J. to a number 
of far-flung locales as he works tirelessly to free the U.S.A. from the 
clutches of the world-dominating Reich.
FPS fans will have a blast with this game; developers MachineGames 
provide great levels and a wealth of cool guns (paired with mountains 
of ammo) with which to carry out B.J.’s work. As in the 2014 
Wolfenstein: The New Order and its expansion pack The Old Blood, 
the controls are tight, action is fast and fluid, and the game looks and 
sounds fantastic (I played the PC version).
But as with its predecessor, one of the really cool things about this 
game is how surprisingly good the story and characterization are. 
Once again, we see Blazkowicz not just as another muscle-headed, 
gun-toting action hero, but as a somewhat more complex person 
with love, hate, regrets, and a very human awareness of his own 
mortality. In one portion of the game, B.J. travels to his childhood 
home in between mission objectives to retrieve his mother’s 
wedding ring to give to his love Anya, who is pregnant with twins. 
The game provides several optional vignettes that replay his 
childhood memories, sparked by the sights of home, and they offer 
a telling glimpse into the events that shaped Blazkowicz.
At a glance, such introspection may seem odd in such close proximity 
to hours of wanton violence, but as is often the case, getting to know 
what makes a character tick increased my interest and emotional 
investment. That in turn raised the stakes and made the tension of the 
action and the thrill of beating the odds that much more enjoyable.
Whether you just like shooting stuff on-screen or (like me) are a sucker 
for a good story, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus doesn’t disappoint. ■

Q&A With Justin Walker
NVIDIA Director Of Product 
Management Talks GTX 1070 Ti
close to MSRP prices and let gamers get the 
extra performance through overclocking. For 
gamers who want to spend more for extra 
performance out of the box, the GTX 1080 
is the best option.
Q
: What’s the real difference, from 
NVIDIA’s point of view, between a 
factory overclock and a stock card bundled 
with overclocking software that OCs the 
card with a click or two?
JW
: They’re both great options 
to get extra performance out 
of your GPU. And even if you purchase a 
factory-overclocked card, you can still 
manually overclock it as well for even more 
performance gains!
Q
: What were your goals in designing 
the GTX 1070 Ti, and how well does 
the final product meet those goals?
JW
: Our goal is always to deliver the 
best gaming experience at the best 
value. The GTX 1070 has been an incredibly 
popular GPU because it delivers excellent 
bang for the buck. With the 1070 Ti, we 
wanted to provide gamers a GPU with some 
extra kick relative to the GTX 1070 while 
keeping the same great value. I’m happy with 
the way 1070 Ti has achieved that goal.
Q
: If someone’s in the market for 
a graphics card right now and has a 
budget of $450 to $500, what’s the elevator 
pitch for the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti?
JW
: If you have a budget of $450 to 
$500 for your graphics card, then 
the GTX 1070 Ti is the best way to enjoy 
the hottest games of the holiday season! ■
utilizes a higher-end cooler with the same 
vapor chamber cooler as the GTX 1080, and 
has a high-efficiency 5-phase power supply.
Q
: Let’s talk a bit about overclocking: 
We’ve seen indications that the 1070 Ti 
is a solid overclocker, but we’re seeing a wide 
range of 1070 Ti models from AIBs with 
all sorts of custom coolers (including one 
with all-in-one liquid cooling!) and none 
with factory overclocks. Why aren’t partners 
OC-ing these cards out of the box?
JW
: We designed the GeForce GTX 
1070 Ti to be an overclocking 
monster with plenty of headroom for gamers 
to crank up the clock speeds. And our 
partners have built cards with thermals and 
power supplies that allow gamers to push 
performance way past stock specifications. 
However, even an overclocked GTX 1070 
Ti won’t be as good as a GTX 1080, so we’re 
focused on keeping the GTX 1070 Ti at or 
Q
: NVIDIA released the GeForce GTX 
1070 Ti just before Halloween; what 
kind of gamer is this card designed for?
JW
: The GeForce GTX 1070 Ti is 
made for gamers who want to 
enjoy the latest games at high resolution 
with graphics settings cranked up and 
high levels of AA enabled. It’s great for 
powering HD 1080p displays, ultrawide 
2,560 x 1,440 displays and even has the 
horsepower you need for virtual reality. 
Q
: So, it’s probably safe to assume 
that the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti fits 
between the GTX 1070 and the GTX 
1080 in the current lineup, but how 
does its performance compare with those 
cards, and for reference, how does it 
compare with last-gen GeForce cards? 
JW
: The GTX 1070 Ti is roughly 
twice as fast as the GTX 970, 
which launched in September 2014. 
Compared to its Pascal brethren, it is about 
15% percent faster than the GTX 1070. 
The GTX 1080 however, is still about 10% 
faster overall at stock speeds, depending on 
the game and resolution. 
Q
: What are the architectural differences 
between the GTX 1070 Ti and the 
GTX 1070?
JW
: Both are based on Pascal—
our most advanced gaming 
architecture—which means they both have 
excellent power efficiency and the latest 
gaming features. The GTX 1070 Ti has four 
extra SM units, 512 extra CUDA cores and 
a slightly faster base clock compared to the 
1070. The 1070 Ti Founder’s Edition also
