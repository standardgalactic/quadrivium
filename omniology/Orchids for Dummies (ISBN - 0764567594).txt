About the Authors
Steven A. Frowine first started growing orchids under lights when
he was in high school. Since then, his love and sometimes obses-
sion for orchids has continued to grow. He has tended orchids pro-
fessionally as a horticulturist, when he worked in Hawaii at the
National Tropical Botanical Garden and at Missouri Botanical
Garden, where he was Chairman of Indoor Horticulture and man-
aged one of the largest orchid collections in the United States —
over 10,000 plants. Steve’s greatest pleasure from orchids, though,
has been growing them in his own home under lights and in win-
dowsills, which he has done now for over 40 years.
Steve has a B.S. and M.S. in horticulture from Ohio State University
and Cornell, respectively. He has had a long and rich career working
as a professional horticulturist for premier botanical gardens in the
United States and as an executive at top horticultural businesses
including W. Atlee Burpee Company, White Flower Farm, and
International Gardening Products. Steve is sought out as a lecturer
and has delivered hundreds of lectures throughout the country. His
presentations are noted for his excellent photography, his knowl-
edge of the subject, and his sense of humor. He has appeared on
various national TV shows and writes extensively, authoring many
articles for horticultural trade and consumer magazines. His
second book, Fragrant Orchids, will be released in the fall of 2005.
Steve is now president of his own horticultural consulting firm,
where he works with various horticultural companies on marketing
and public-relations issues.
The National Gardening Association (NGA), founded in 1972, is a
national not-for-profit leader in plant-based education. Its mission is
to promote home, school, and community gardening as a means to
renew and sustain the essential connection between people, plants,
and the environment. For more information on the National
Gardening Association, visit its Web site at www.garden.org.


Dedication
To my mother, Janet, and my late father, Samuel, who encouraged
me to pursue in my life and work what I loved and believed in.
To my loving wife, Sascha, who shares my passions and tolerates
my obsessions.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Many thanks are extended to Glen Decker, who served as the tech-
nical editor for this book. It is comforting to have someone with
Glen’s extensive experience and knowledge pore over my manu-
script and lend his constructive, helpful criticism, as well as make
sure the information presented rings true. To my Project Editor,
Elizabeth Kuball, who greatly helped to mold and shape this book
to be the best it could be, and to Tracy Boggier, my Acquisitions
Editor, who helped me pitch this book to the folks at Wiley, more
thanks.
I am also appreciative to the National Gardening Association, which
does admirable good works, and specifically to Larry Sommers and
Charlie Nardozzi, of this organization, for giving me the opportunity
to produce this book.
The American Orchid Society, The Orchid Digest, and the
International Phalaenopsis Society deserve a round of applause for
the world-class publications they produce and the information they
disseminate to the legends of new and veteran orchid lovers. I have
made frequent use of all of them for many years.
The orchid community of amateur and professional growers and
orchid societies, who inform members and put on orchid shows,
get accolades for their dedication and efforts. Many have been
immensely helpful to me.
Lastly, I want to thank my wife, Sascha, for her patience in putting
up with me pounding away at the keyboard for seemingly countless
days, evenings, and weekends, and to my dogs, Ginger and Zoe,
who always provided pleasant company and never complained
(unless I didn’t feed them on time!).

Introduction
B
elieve it or not, orchids — the most glamorous and spectacular
flowering plants in the world, nature’s true masterpieces — are
easy to grow! You just need to give them what they need. And their
requirements are not difficult to meet — adequate light, humidity,
water, and ventilation. Sure, there are other nuances, like fertilizing,
repotting, insect and disease control, but none of these are daunt-
ing. I’ve been growing and blooming orchids in my home for almost
40 years — mostly not in a greenhouse, but under lights or on the
windowsill.
Helping you achieve success with these glorious plants is my
pleasurable mission. If you follow the steps I lay out in this book,
you will grow orchids that thrive. Everything in this book comes
from many years of my own trials and errors — not from theories
about what should happen or what orchids might need. Sure, I’m a
professional horticulturist, but probably more importantly, I’m a
hands-on, sometimes fanatical, home orchid grower. I don’t share
with you anything in this book that I haven’t tried myself or am
sure that works.
Years ago, the methods of orchid culture were well-guarded secrets,
hoarded by commercial growers and private estate gardeners.
That’s not the case here. This is a tell-all book where all secrets
are revealed. So you can now enter this wonderful world of orchids
without fear, knowing that you’re armed with the information you
need to be successful and enjoy one of the most rewarding and fas-
cinating, lifelong hobbies that you’ll ever experience — growing
orchids.
About This Book
This book gives you all you need to know to grow, appreciate,
and bloom orchids in your home — in a concise, easy-to-read
manner. This family of plants is so humongous that you may be
overwhelmed by the prospect of choosing and growing one of your
own, so I show you only the groups of orchids that are the easier
ones to grow. I also make a point of adding lots of illustrations and
photos (most of which were taken by me) to show you what I’m
talking about.

I want you to feel comfortable with these dazzling plants and get to
know them on a personal basis. Then you’ll be eager to discover all
their mysteries by slowing down your busy life to savor orchids’
inimitable flowers, inhale their sensuous perfumes, and observe
the unique construction of their roots and leaves.
Conventions Used in This Book
Orchid names are in Latin, which is a challenge for most people
(except your high school Latin teacher) to pronounce and remem-
ber. Don’t worry about it. Just get into these names gradually.
Take some solace in knowing everyone else is struggling with
them, too!
With such a complex group of plants come names and jargon to
match. This aspect of orchid growing is what scares most people
off. Don’t let this happen to you! They’re just names and words
that scientists have assigned to plants because they had to call
them something. Think of orchid names as another language that
you can figure out as you go along — with my help. In this book, I
make the jargon as simple as possible and explain each term in a
way that is easy to understand.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I’ve assumed a few things about you and
your experience with orchids. At least one of the following applies
to you:
 You’ve seen orchid plants in bloom for sale in the garden sec-
tion of your local home-improvement store or garden center
and you’ve always wanted to give them a try.
 You purchased your first orchid and are wondering, “Now
what?!”
 You saw orchids at a flower show and you wonder if you can
grow these exquisite flowers in your home.
 You’ve had some orchids for a few years, but they don’t seem
to be doing well and you can’t get them to bloom again.
 You’ve grown some other houseplants successfully and are
now ready to move up to orchids.

chapters.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids 
into Your Life
In this part, I show you how orchids are different from other plants,
what makes them so appealing, and where they’re found in nature.
You get tips on how to select the right orchid for you, which tools
you need to grow them, and how you can fully enjoy their beauty
in your home.
Chapter 1 tells you what makes an orchid an orchid, where they
grow, where they’re found, and how they’re named. Chapter 2 helps
you select the orchid that’s just right for you and tells you how to
give it basic care for its first days in your home. Chapter 3 gives
you a rundown of the tools you’ll need to be an amateur orchid
grower. Chapter 4 helps you get the most out of displaying your
orchid’s beauty in your home.
Part II: The Basics of
Orchid Parenthood
This is the nitty-gritty on the basics of orchid care.
Chapter 5 gives you the information you need to provide your
orchids with the growing environment that they need to thrive.
Chapter 6 addresses the important topics of watering and fertiliz-
ing. Chapter 7 eliminates your fears of repotting by giving you
the detailed information you need. Chapter 8 guides you through
various methods of multiplying the orchids you have. Chapter 9
shows you simple and safe ways to keep your orchids healthy.
Part III: The Best Orchids 
for Rookies
Here I introduce you to the most popular and easiest orchid to
grow. I’ve included plenty of pictures so you can see what they
actually look like.
Introduction

Chapter 10 deals with the easiest of all the orchids, the moth
orchids. I also introduce you to some of its recommended rela-
tives. Chapter 11 covers the colorful and favorite cattleyas and
their relatives. Chapter 12 covers slipper orchids. These are
among the easiest to grow with handsome foliage. They have one
of the largest groups of ardent admirers. Chapter 13 is about the
oncidium group, which is rapidly rising in its popularity because
it’s easy to grow and because it produces many fantastically pat-
terned flowers. Chapter 14 tells you about more orchid gems that
are not quite as common but are worth the search to find.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without a Part of Tens. This
is where you can turn when you’re short on time but still want a lot
of useful information.
Chapter 15 helps you select the easiest orchids to start with.
Chapter 16 tells you the ten most common ways orchids are killed
and how to prevent these plights. Chapter 17 gives you answers to
the ten most common questions asked about orchids and their cul-
ture. Chapter 18 informs you about the ten most common reasons
that orchids don’t bloom.
Appendix
You may be fortunate enough to be close to an orchid grower or
supplier, but if you aren’t, don’t despair — I list some excellent
mail-order providers in this appendix. Some have paper catalogs
and others offer their plants online.
Although more home centers and garden centers are carrying
orchid supplies, you may have trouble finding some of these 
materials. For this reason, I include some resources that are
dependable.
Orchid societies offer valuable services, from providing places
to meet, talk about, and display orchids, to producing excellent
publications and sources for information. In the appendix, I also
list contacts for the key organizations. They’ll lead you, if you’re so
inclined, to others.

G
rowing orchids could change your life — forever! It
has for me and many people. No other plant family
offers the number and diversity of breathtaking and intrigu-
ing ﬂowers that orchids do. When you discover that you
can actually grow these exotic plants in your home and that
they aren’t expensive, your resistance will be lowered and
your chances of catching the extremely contagious but
wonderful obsession or addiction called the “Orchid Bug”
are high.
In England and the rest of Europe in Victorian times, these
fabulous plants used to be only for the eyes of royalty or
well-heeled aristocrats because of the one-time astronomi-
cal prices that they commanded at ﬂower auctions. They
were grown in elaborate and costly glasshouses, usually
by a staff of professional growers.
How times have changed! Orchids have entered the main-
stream. They’re now the second most popular pot plant in
the world and are gaining quickly on the leader (poinset-
tia)! Because of new techniques and modern growing
methods, award-quality orchids are available to everyone
at prices lower than ever before. You can buy an orchid
plant in full bloom for less than you would pay for a bou-
quet of ﬂowers from the ﬂorist.
In addition to the orchids of today being less expensive,
they’re also much easier to grow. Most of them have been
bred to be compact and easy to grow and ﬂower in win-
dowsills and under artiﬁcial lights. Some bloom more than
once a year and others are fragrant. And with thousands
of hybrids and new ones being produced all the time,
there is an orchid that will strike anyone’s and everyone’s
fancy.
Join me in this part as I introduce you to this marvelous
plant family. I show you what makes an orchid an orchid,
why you just have to give these exceptional plants a try,
and help you make decisions about which orchids are best
for you and your growing space. This is going to be a fun
journey, so let’s begin!

 Getting to know orchids
 Deciding whether orchids are right for you
 Knowing what to do for your orchids each month of the year
You’re about to enter the wonderful world of orchids. You’re in
store for an exciting adventure! This is the largest plant family
on our planet with an estimated 30,000 wild types (species) and
many more man-made varieties. No other plants can compete with
orchids for their power to seduce and bedazzle the most jaded plant
lover with their fantastically beautiful flower colors, shapes, and
textures, and heady and sensuous perfumes.
Understanding What Makes 
an Orchid an Orchid
You can easily tell when a rose is rose, but orchids are quite a bit
more complex and varied when it comes to their flower shapes and
the construction of their leaves, stems, and roots. In Part III, I give
you lots of information on flower, leaf, and stem construction of
specific orchids. In this chapter, I talk generalities.
Certainly the flamboyant colors of modern orchid hybrids are a
standout and are the primary reason these plants are so treasured.
But there are so many different types of orchid flowers, so the ques-
tion is, “Which one is typical?” There is really no correct answer to
this question. Many people think of the cattleya-type orchids (see
Chapter 11), while others may picture moth orchids (see Chapter 10).
To get a better idea how orchid flowers are constructed, take a
look at a typical cattleya flower and compare it to a more ordinary

flower, a tulip (see Figure 1-1). Table 1-1 shows some of the major
differences between these two flowers.
So what makes an orchid an orchid? The column. This fused sexual
structure located in the middle of the flower is what separates the
orchid from all other plants.

Knowing Where Orchids 
Come From
About 80 percent of orchids are from the tropics in both the New
World (Central and South America) and the Old World (Asia and
Malaysia). A smattering can be found in North America and
Europe.
The ones that grow in your home, though, are all of tropical or
semitropical origin. They mostly hail from areas of high rainfall and
humidity and enjoy tropical to above-freezing temperatures during
the winter.
Orchids are divided into two major categories based on where
they grow. Those that are commonly found clinging to branches
of trees are called epiphytes; those that thrive growing on or in the
ground are called semiterrestrials and terrestrials.
So how can you tell the difference between the two? Many of the
terrestrial roots are hairy, like those found in the slipper orchid
(see Figure 1-2). Epiphytes have thick roots (called aerial roots
because they’re frequently suspended in the air), which are cov-
ered with a silvery material called velamen, which can absorb
moisture from the air like a sponge (see Figure 1-3).
Figure 1-2: Terrestrial and semiterrestrial orchids, like most slipper orchids, 
frequently have hairy roots.

Seeing Why You Should 
Grow Orchids
Growing and studying orchids will provide you the ultimate horti-
cultural experience and pleasure. Here are some key reasons to
start growing orchids now:
 Growing orchids is fun! That’s the most important motive.
 Orchids are easy to grow. See Chapter 5 for tips on how to be
successful.
 You can start with beginner orchids that any newcomer can
be wildly successful with. See Chapter 15 for some plants to
start you off.
 Orchids cost less than they ever have, and you can easily
select just the right one for you. See Chapter 2 to make this
process a snap.
 No group of flowering plants comes close to the delicious
perfumes that orchids emit. Pay attention to the Fragrance
icon used throughout this book to find the most-fragrant
orchids.
 Orchids are available from “box” stores, specialty growers,
orchid shows, garden centers, botanical gardens, orchid
societies, and mail-order suppliers. See the appendix for a
list of suppliers.

 Because of the huge diversity of orchids, you’ll never tire of
them. You’ll always find new ones to try and enjoy. Check out
the chapters in Part III for some of the many possibilities.
 You’ll meet new friends who are as fanatical about these
plants as you are. See the appendix for lists of orchid soci-
eties to join. Their magazines are a marvelous source for
information and gorgeous pictures. These are some of the
best-quality plant magazines in the world.
 Orchids don’t require an expensive greenhouse to grow.
They’ll be happy with a windowsill or artificial lights. See
Chapter 5 for the skinny on how to grow these orchids to 
perfection in your home.
 They’ll beautify your home and life. See Chapter 4 for some
tips on how to enjoy them to the fullest in your home.
 Orchids can live forever, so as they grow you can divide
and multiply them to share with your friends or to trade for
other orchids. See Chapter 8 for more tips on dividing and
multiplying your orchids.
Deciding Which Orchids 
to Bring into Your Home
Choosing an orchid is an exciting, but sometimes confusing, deci-
sion! So many types of orchids, so little space. In this book, I make
this process easy for you:
 Check out Chapter 2 to walk through some of the steps to
take in deciding what orchid will fit in with your home envi-
ronment and suggestions of where you can scope out and 
purchase them.
 Consider starting your orchid collection with moth orchids.
They’re the most foolproof of all. See Chapter 10 for details
about these.
 Next check out slipper orchids, another easy group. See
Chapter 12.
 Then, if you want to try others, look over Chapter 15 for some
of the easiest orchids to grow.
 When you’re ready to expand or you want more choices,
check out all the other orchids in Part III.
Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Orchids 13

Getting to Know Your 
Orchids by Name
Probably one of the most intimidating hurdles that the beginning
orchid grower faces is the complex names given to orchids. When
you realize what an immense group of plants this is, you’ll soon
come to realize why most orchids are referred to by their Latin
name rather than a common name. Actually, very few orchids even
have a common name. In this book, I always use the Latin name,
because that’s the universally accepted name, and I add a common
name when there is one.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life

Why do I care that an orchid 
was awarded?
Awarded orchids are the crème de la crème of the orchid world. They’ve been
deemed this distinction by trained, discriminating orchid judges. The American
Orchid Society, a nonprofit educational organization that is dedicated to the study
of orchids has established the judging criteria. Similar organizations serve the same
function in other parts of the world.
At each accredited orchid show, a covey of judges carefully examines orchids that are
exceptional. They use Internet connections to check all existing records of the orchids
being judged. They look for ones of the same grex or similar parentage to see what
has been awarded in the past to serve as a benchmark of excellence. These records
will reveal which of their parents have been awarded, what size and number of flow-
ers were on the awarded plants, and so on. These criteria are then used to decide
if these specimens are indeed superior to others of this type and whether they’re
worthy of awards. The three award categories used by the American Orchid Society
that you’re most likely to encounter are (from highest to lowest):
 First Class Certificate (FCC): This is the coveted highest award that only a hand-
ful of orchids (10 or 15!) receive every year.
 Award of Merit (AM): Usually a few hundred orchids win this distinction every year.
 Highly Commended Certificate (HCC): Another few hundred orchids are given
this level of award.
Very few orchids make it through this gauntlet. Because of modern cloning techniques
(see Chapter 2), you can now obtain these prize winners for your own collection at
very reasonable prices. Some types of orchids, like the slippers, are not yet able to
be cloned, so in that case, picking out those hybrids with awarded parents is a good
idea. Remember: It takes the same amount of space to grow a high-quality orchid
as it does a poor one, so why not grow the best?

If you struggled through high school Latin classes as I did, you may
have thought (and hoped) that this language died with the Romans.
Alas, it is alive and well in the natural-science world, and it’s the
standard language used to name flora and fauna. You’ll start to make
friends with Latin as its use become more familiar and comfortable
to you.
Taking the name a little at a time makes it easier to digest. In the
following sections, I show you the names, one word at a time, of a
species orchid and then a hybrid.
Species orchid names
Plants that are sold as they were created by nature, not hybridized
by man, are referred to as species orchids. They have two names: the
genus name, which comes first and is capitalized, and the species
name, which comes second and is lowercase. Both names are in
Latin, so they’re italicized (which is just the way foreign languages
are usually treated).
You may see a third part to the name, the botanical variety, after
the species name. This is a name given to an orchid that varies
somewhat — it could be a larger flower or one with slightly differ-
ent coloration — from the standard species. It will be preceded by
the letters “var.” and will be in lowercase and in Latin.
The genus name is much like your last name and the species name
is like your first name. In other words, orchid naming is backward
to the way you say your own name. If my name were written as an
orchid’s is, I would be Frowine steven.
Here’s an example of the name of a species orchid: Cattleya walkeri-
ana var. semialba. Table 1-2 explains the orchid’s name.

Botanical 
var. semialba
Sometimes, a third name appears for a 
variety
species orchid. This is called a botanical
variety and means this form of this species
has something special about it (for example,
flower shape or color) that separates it from
the more common form of the species. This
name is in lowercase, italicized, and in Latin.
Hybrid orchid names
Oh, it would be so simple if naming stopped here, but man got
mixed up in all this and started developing hybrids. Hybrids result
from crossing two species (taking the pollen from one orchid to use
it to “mate” with another). A marvelous thing happens when two
different species of orchids are crossed or mated to each other.
Their progeny is usually stronger, easier to grow, and frequently
produces larger flowers than either of its parents — which is why
hybrids are so desirable and popular.
Here’s an example of a hybrid orchid name: Brassocattleya Cynthia
‘Pink Lady’ HCC/AOS. (See the color section for a photograph of
this orchid.) Table 1-3 breaks down the name and explains its vari-
ous parts.

Genus
Brassocattleya
This genus combines two different genera —
Brassavola and Cattleya — to result in the
man-made name of Brassocattleya. The
name is capitalized, in Latin, italicized, and
frequently abbreviated Bc.
Species
None
This is a hybrid that has several different
species in its parentage, so no single one is
listed. When an orchid hybrid comes from
just one species, the species name will also
be listed, lowercase, in italics, and in Latin.
Grex
Cynthia
All the resulting progeny from this cross are
given a name that’s known as a grex. Think of
this as you and all your siblings having a label.
The grex is always written in a language other
than Latin, is capitalized, and is not in italics.

are frequently several or more cultivars in a
grex. Think of the cultivar as one of your par-

but the cultivar is you in particular.

designations.)
Orchid hybridizing can produce plants with quite complex names,
especially in some of the very large groups like the cattleyas (see
Chapter 11) and the oncidiums (see Chapter 13). In these chapters,
I deal with their names in more detail.
You don’t have to be an expert in orchid names in order to enjoy
and grow orchids. You’ll catch onto many other name nuances
after you’re drawn further into the orchid web. For now, don’t
worry about them much — they’re only names!

genera names that you’re likely to run into, along with their abbre-
viations and pronunciations. Tear out the Cheat Sheet and take it
with you when you go shopping for orchids.
Growing Orchids Easy 
As One, Two, Three
To be successful in growing orchids, just follow these suggestions:
 Know the environment you have to offer your orchids and
match this with the orchids that fit. See Chapter 5 for more
information on your growing environment.
 If necessary, modify your growing area to help your orchids
perform to their best. Check out Chapter 5 for information on
how to do this.
Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Orchids 17

For the most common questions and problems, check out Part IV.
Beyond choosing the right orchid for your environment, you have
to pay attention to the time of the year to know what your orchid
needs. In the following sections, I give you a rundown of the year,
month by month. Note: You can’t be too exact with the timing of
this care schedule, because the United States is a vast country
with climates from the cold north country to semitropics.
January
This is a period of cold, short days and low light, so orchids don’t
grow much in such times. Fortunately, many moth orchids, slipper
orchids, and some other cattleyas and their relatives will be budding
up getting ready to show off their splendiferous blooms very soon.
 For orchids such as some of the dendrobiums, cattleya species,
and deciduous orchids, like the catasetums, this is a time of
rest, so you’ll want to reduce your watering.
 Keep the humidity high with good air movement.
 If you are using well water, warm it up to room temperature
before using it on your orchid plants. Ice-cold water can cause
forming buds to drop and may stunt new growth.
 Don’t put your orchids too close to the windowpanes or the
leaves could be damaged by the cold.
 Apply very little fertilizer. The orchids won’t need it.
February
This is another dark month, but the days will be getting longer and
brighter, which should cause an increase in growth.
 Toward the end of this month, increased light may mean you
have to be careful with your orchids that require less light,
like the slippers and moth orchids, so they don’t get burned.
 More of your orchids will be showing buds and some, espe-
cially some of the moth orchids and some of the oncidiums,
should be blooming.
 Don’t overcrowd your plants — make sure they receive as
much light as possible.
 Provide good air circulation to prevent disease problems.
 Stake your cymbidiums, which should be spiking now.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
18

 Don’t forget to keep your miltonias and miltoniopsis damp.
 If you’re growing under lights, take note of when you last
changed your bulbs. Fluorescent lamps can lose up to 40 per-
cent of their light output after several months of use. Because
new growth is starting on orchids, this is a good time to change
the lamps so the plants will receive the most light possible.
 Apply very little fertilizer during this month.
March
Finally, signs of spring with longer and brighter days.
 Be careful that the increased light doesn’t heat up too much in
your greenhouse or windowsill. Apply shading if necessary.
 The increased light and warmth of this month will mean an
acceleration of growth. Sprouting new roots should be more
evident.
 This is the beginning of the show for many orchids. Many catt-
leyas, moth orchids, slipper orchids, and oncidiums will be
starting to bloom.
 As the days get brighter and warmer, you can resume your
regular fertilizing schedule.
 This month and next are prime times to check out orchid
shows in your area.
April
In April, many orchids will be in glorious flower.
 You’ll probably have to increase the frequency of your water-
ing because of the new plant growth.
 As soon as you see new roots emerging in cattleyas, this is
the time to repot. Do it before the roots grow a few inches 
(5 cm) long.
 Many other orchids showing new growth can also be repotted
at this time.
 Be on the lookout for bugs. The warmer temperatures cause
them to hatch out.
 Dormant orchids should be showing new growth now so you
can resume your regular watering schedule.
Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Orchids 19

 If you didn’t apply shading on your greenhouse last month, it
may be needed now.
 A gauze curtain may be needed to soften the light for orchids
growing in a south window.
 Check out orchid shows in your area.
May
Growth will continue at full speed this month. This is another
prime month for orchid flowering.
 More frequent watering and fertilizing will be called for.
 If you’re in a northern climate, move some plants to a shaded,
protected spot outdoors by the end of this month, but be
careful not to do this too quickly. Orchids that prefer it warm,
like moth orchids, don’t appreciate being too chilled at night,
not below around 65°F (18°C).
 Increase your ventilation to remove excess hot air and pre-
vent fungal disease spotting on the flowers.
 This is usually an opportune time to repot most of your slip-
per orchids because they should be in active growth now.
Also, repot moth orchids and their vandaceous relatives.
Attend to this right after they’ve flowered.
 Continue your fertilizing program to strengthen new growth.
June, July, and August
Temperatures are starting to heat up now. Some orchids, like a few
of the summer blooming hybrid cattleyas, oncidiums, and slipper
orchids, will be in flower.
 Be sure your windowsill or greenhouse doesn’t get too hot.
Consider moving the orchids you have in the south window to
the east window, where they’ll have reduced light and heat.
 For orchids growing under lights, make sure your growing area
gets plenty of ventilation, because it could be getting very warm
now under the lights. If you have trouble keeping the tempera-
tures low enough, consider summering your orchids outside
in a shaded and protected spot. They’ll enjoy the vacation.
 This is also a prime time for insect problems. If it gets hot and
dry, be on the lookout for mites. If it’s wet, slugs and snails will
be a plague. Aphids and scale can show up anytime. If you need
to spray, do it in the morning when it is cool and be sure the
orchids are well watered before you spray.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
20

 The orchids should now be responding to your earlier repot-
ting efforts with new root growth.
 Repot miltonias. Remember: They like to be pot-bound, so
don’t put them in too large of a pot.
September
Cool evenings and shorter days are signs of the change of season.
Many of the hybrid vandas will be at their blooming peak this
month. Buds will be showing up for the fall-blooming cattleyas,
oncidiums, dendrobiums, angraecums, and moth orchids and 
slipper orchids.
 If you’re in a cold climate, this is the month to bring indoors
any plants that have been summering outside. Before doing
this, check them closely for pests. If spraying is called for,
doing so is much easier while the plants are outdoors.
 These cooler nights are very beneficial for setting flower buds
and spikes.
 Start cutting back on the frequency of watering deciduous
orchids like catasetums (which will have yellowing foliage at
this time of year).
 This is the time to remove shade on the greenhouse in most
parts of the country.
 Move orchids that require a lot of light from the east window
back to the southern exposure.
October
Some cattleya species and their relatives and hybrids will be in
bloom now. So will some moth orchid species and hybrids and
oncidiums.
 As days continue to shorten and the angle of light gets lower
in the sky, position the orchids in your windowsill and green-
house so that they capture the most light.
 For greenhouses and windowsills, be sure your glass or glaz-
ing surface is clean. This can make a real difference in light
transmission.
 Growth will start to slow on many orchids from lower 
temperatures and light, so reduce watering and fertilizing
accordingly.
 Get ready for winter. Insulate your greenhouse. Get a standby
emergency propane heater.
Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Orchids 21

November and December
Flowering spikes will be showing up on some moth orchids, slip-
pers, and oncidiums. Some of the nobile-type dendrobiums will be
starting to show buds. Low light, short days, and cold temperatures
bring most orchid growth to a stop or at least a crawl. You’ll see
more growth on plants grown under lights than in a greenhouse or
on a windowsill because of the additional light that can be provided.
 For cold parts of the country, November is the last month to
safely purchase mail-order plants before it gets so cold that
there will be a higher risk chance for freeze damage in transit.
This a great time to visit orchid nurseries to pick out holiday
presents for your orchid growing friends (or yourself!).
 Put orchids that require more light, like vandas, in a bright
window, close to the lights, or high in the greenhouse to
expose them to as much light as possible.
 Water in the early part of the day to ensure that there is no
standing moisture on the leaves. In cold, damp weather, espe-
cially, such moisture can cause disease outbreaks.

Choosing the Right 
Orchid for You
In This Chapter
 Finding orchids for sale
 Deciding which orchid to buy
 Picking out a healthy orchid
 Caring for your new arrival
O
ne of the main reasons some people fail with orchids is that
they simply choose the wrong ones. Considering that there are
thousands of different kinds of orchids, it’s easy to see how people
may not know which one to buy. To be successful, you need to
choose a dependable supplier, healthy plants, and the type of orchid
that fits your growing area. In this chapter, I walk you through the
important questions to ask yourself and your supplier so you end
up with the orchid that will be just right in your growing spot.
Figuring Out Where to Shop
Finding orchid suppliers used to be difficult, unless you were lucky
enough to live in a very warm area, like Southern California or
Florida. Nowadays, because orchids have skyrocketed in popular-
ity, you can find them for sale in myriad places. In the following
sections, I fill you in on your supplier options.
Specialist orchid growers or suppliers
An orchid specialist is always my first choice when I’m buying
orchids. Reputable suppliers in this category have been selling
orchids for many years, before it was the chic thing to do. Almost
all of them are orchid fanatics whose hobby grew totally out of
control — so they were forced to either stop buying more orchids

or start up a business. They know everything about their plants —
where they came from, their attributes, and how to grow them.
They almost always have the largest selection and cater to both the
beginner and sophisticated, experienced growers. They love to help
other people discover the pleasure of growing orchids and are full
of helpful information.
The only disadvantage of specialist growers or suppliers is that you
may not have one near where you live. Of course, that doesn’t have
to be a deterrent. It just means you’ll need to do some planning and
search out these growers so you can take your own orchid-buying
safari!
Turn to the appendix for a short list of some of my favorite special-
ist orchid growers and suppliers.
Your local garden center
Having a local orchid source is very convenient both for buying
the plants and for information on growing. Today, garden centers
offer more unusual and more interesting plants than ever before —
and orchids are among these. The types of orchids they offer varies
greatly from one garden center to the next.
Look for a garden center that specializes in tropical plants and
houseplants. Unless the garden center is noted for its orchid offer-
ings, the selection will probably be limited. Search out the types
mentioned in this book, especially the moth and slipper orchids.
Orchid shows
At orchid shows, you’ll find dazzling displays of a broad range of
gorgeous orchids. Be prepared to be wowed! Vendors of orchids
are a regular feature of orchid shows, so they’re a great place to
shop. To find an orchid show in your area, check out the various
orchid magazines or search their Web sites (see the appendix).
Online orchid suppliers
You can buy a fine selection of orchids without ever leaving your
home. Most orchid suppliers now have Web sites, and some of the
sites are very detailed and informative.
To get started, check out the Orchid Marketplace at http://orchid
web.org/marketplace.html and Orchid Mall at www.orchidmall.
com. Each of these sites provides many links to various orchid-
grower Web sites. If you already know what types of orchids you
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
24

want, you can use a search engine (such as Yahoo! or Google) to
search for them by type or name.
If you use the Latin name when searching for plants on the Web,
not the common name, you’ll get many more hits. In other words,
instead of searching for “moth orchids,” search using its Latin name,
Phalaenopsis. Check out www.chebucto.ns.ca/recreation/
orchidcongress/engname.html for lists of the Latin names with
their English common names.
Home centers and discount stores
Because orchids have had such a meteoric rise in popularity, home
centers and discount stores now frequently stock a limited selec-
tion of them. The good news: They usually carry the orchids that
are easy to grow. The bad news: Getting information at these stores
is difficult. But if you’re shopping for your first, inexpensive orchid,
and if you don’t have easy access to a garden center or orchid
grower, these are good places to start.
When shopping for plants at home centers and discount stores, find
out what day of the week their weekly shipments come in. That’s
the day you want to be there to get the best quality and selection.
Considering Your Environment
When you go to shop for orchids, you can very easily get carried
away! The excitement of the moment can completely win over
rational plant selection. Few beginning orchid growers take the
time to consider their environment before they buy. Unfortunately,
if you do this, you may end up bringing home a gorgeous orchid
that’s completely wrong for you.
If possible, always choose an orchid that comes close to fitting
your growing area. Even though in Part II of this book I give you
pointers on how to modify your growing area to make it more suit-
able for orchid growth, you can only modify your environment so
much. For instance, an orchid that is commonly found growing in
full sun in Hawaii probably won’t take well to a windowsill during
the winter in low-light areas like New England. And an orchid from
the cloud forest that is drenched with almost constant rainfall and
very high humidity probably won’t be happy and bloom in the hot
dry air of Arizona.
In the following sections, I help you assess your environment so
you can be confident that you’ll pick out a stunning orchid that is
right for you and that will thrive where you live.
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Orchid for You 25

Taking temperature readings
Before you bring home an orchid, you need to consider the aver-
age daytime and nighttime temperatures in summer and winter
where you live.
To determine high and low temperatures indoors get a maximum/
minimum thermometer that records this information and place it
in your growing area (see Chapter 3).
For an idea of what your minimum temperatures are outdoors where
you live, check out the USDA hardiness map at www.usna.usda.
gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html. If you’re a weather nut like I am,
you can use a recording weather station that reads the maximum
and minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and
barometric pressure every hour and stores this information so it
can be charted. Mine has remote sensors and a wireless connec-
tion to my computer.
A broad selection of temperature and weather recording instruments
are available from the orchid-supplies dealers listed in the appendix.
When you’ve determined the average summer and winter tempera-
tures in your area, turn to Table 2-1, which lists some of the most
common types of orchids by temperature requirements. Notice
that some orchids are adaptable enough to fit into more than one
temperature range.
When orchid publications refer to temperature preferences, they
always mean the evening temperature. The daytime temperature is
usually about 15°F (9.5°C) higher than the evening temperature.

Measuring your light intensity
Just as important as temperature is the amount of light your orchid
will get. Orchids that thrive in high light need several hours of direct
sunlight (preferably in the morning to early afternoon), while those
that thrive in lower light will perform with less direct and more dif-
fused light in a windowsill or under lights. See Chapter 5 for more
details.
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Orchid for You 27

Will you be growing the plants under artificial lights? Most light
setups consist of multiple florescent lamps and can provide ade-
quate illumination for medium- to lower-light orchids. High-intensity-
discharge lamps are capable of much more light output but can be
expensive to operate and generate quite a bit of heat. For more
details, see Chapter 5.
How bright is your light? Figure 2-1 illustrates a simple yet effective
and reasonably accurate method for determining the intensity of
your light.
Figure 2-1: The shadow test is a simple and reasonably accurate way to 
measure light intensity.
After you determine your light levels, turn to the following sections,
which list orchids by the amount of light they need. Remember to
keep in mind temperature (see the preceding section).
Bright light
The following orchids require a bright greenhouse, a very bright
south-facing window, or very-high-output (VHO) fluorescent lamps
(which require specialized ballasts to operate) or metal halide lamps:
 Angraecum
 Some varieties of Cymbidium
 Some varieties of Dendrobium
 Vanda
Medium light
The following orchids need a shaded greenhouse, an east-facing
window, or a four-tube 40-watt florescent light fixture:
Bright light
Medium light
Low light
1 ft. (30 cm.)

 All orchid seedlings

Other questions to ask yourself
In addition to considering temperature and light, you want to ask
yourself the following questions:
 Does the growing area have moist (humid) air, or is the air
very dry? If it is already humid (50 percent or greater), it’s
perfect. If not, your orchids will be happier with moister air.
See Chapter 5.
 How much space do you have to grow orchids? If you have
plenty of head room, you can grow some of the taller orchids,
like cane dendrobiums and full-size cattleyas. If space is at
a premium, search out very compact or miniature growers.
Part III gives you plenty of choices for plants of all sizes.
 When do you want your orchids to bloom? Spring, summer,
fall, or winter? In the evening or during the day? Armed with
this information, you can pick those orchids that will be in
bloom in the season and time of day of your choice.
 Do you have air circulation in the growing area? Most homes
have adequate air circulation, but if your orchids are going to
be located in the basement or some other spot where the air is
stagnant, you’ll want to consider a fan of some type to provide
them with fresh air. See the ventilation section in Chapter 5 for
more information.
When you’re armed with this information, you’ll be better pre-
pared to choose an orchid that will thrive.
Knowing What to Look 
for in an Orchid
After you consider your environment, you’re ready to go shopping.
You have an idea of which types of orchids will work best where
you’ll be growing them, and now you just need to look at a few
things such as the plant’s health and age. I fill you in on these fac-
tors in the following sections.
Choosing a healthy plant
Picking out a healthy orchid plant is essential. Even in the best of
circumstances, the orchid that you bring home will have to adapt
to changes in its environment. A strong, robust plant has a much
better chance of surviving this ordeal than a weak plant does.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
30

Here’s a checklist of things to look for when you select an orchid:
 Look carefully at the leaves. They should be stiff, not shriv-
eled or dehydrated. They should also have a healthy green
color. Brown or black spots on leaves could mean disease,
or they could be harmless; if you find spots, ask the grower
about them.
 Look for any signs of insects. Most insects hang out on the
new young growth, on the flower buds of the plant, or on the
undersides of the leaves. Also check under the pot for snails
or slugs.
 Examine the exposed roots on top of the potting material.
The roots should be firm and light colored, not black, soft,
and mushy.
 Watch out for plants infested with oxalis (which looks like
clover). Oxalis is a pesky weed that is difficult to get rid of
after it’s established. It will not directly harm the orchids, but
it can harbor insects and is a cosmetic distraction.
Make sure the plants are labeled. Labels will be important to you
later if you want to look up information on growing your particular
type of orchid.
Be sure to ask the grower about the temperature, light, and humid-
ity requirements of the orchid you’re considering. Check out its
ultimate size. Then match this information with what you know
about your orchid growing area.
Deciding between a blooming 
plant and a young plant
When you buy a mature, blooming plant, you get to see exactly
what the flower of this orchid is like. Because many orchid flowers
can last quite a while, you’ll be able to enjoy this orchid for weeks
after you bring it home. The biggest disadvantage of blooming
plants is that they’re usually the most expensive, because they’re
in the highest demand.
Younger plants — ones that are months or even years away from
blooming — are much less expensive than their mature counter-
parts. The joy in choosing these plants is anticipating when they’ll
bloom and what they may look like.
If you’re a beginner, I recommend that you buy mature plants with
buds or flowers. Waiting for immature plants to bloom is something
you may enjoy after you have a small collection of the mature ones.
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Orchid for You 31

Choosing seed-grown orchids 
or orchid clones
Very few orchids sold today have been collected from the wild.
Instead, they’ve been grown from seed. The flower color, flower
size, and growth habits of these seed-grown plants vary. Seed-
grown plants are generally very reasonably priced.
Cloned orchids, also referred to as meristemmed or mericloned
orchids, are orchids that have been multiplied from single cells,
usually from a plant of very high quality, in a flask, which is a type
of laboratory bottle. The result is that they’re all identical.
The advantage of purchasing a cloned orchid is that you can
depend on the orchid that you buy being exactly like its parent,
which is frequently an award winner. In general, these clones are a
bit more expensive than the others, but they’re usually worth it.
Caring for Your New Orchid
Adding new orchids to your plant collection is exciting, but this is
also a time for caution. Even though you may have been very care-
ful in the selection process, your orchid still may be harboring
insect eggs that may hatch, or it may have a disease problem that
you didn’t notice before.
So, to be on the safe side, keep your new plant isolated from all
your other plants for at least two to three weeks — enough time to
see if any insects appear or a disease shows up. If you need to treat
your new plant, doing so will be easier when it’s separated from
your other plants.
To identify pests and their safest treatment, see Chapter 9.

Having the Right 
Tools on Hand
In This Chapter
 Knowing which tools you need
 Taking your toolkit to the next level
E
very hobby has its tools. And just as you need the right saws
and sanders if you’re building a cabinet, you need the right
tools for growing orchids. The amount of tools you need will depend
on how serious you are about orchids and haw many of them you
have to care for. In this chapter, I fill you in on the tools I use.
Cutting and Pruning Tools
You’ll probably use your cutting and pruning tools more than any
others. Orchids always have a leaf that needs to be trimmed or a
dead or diseased stem that needs to be cut off. These tools are
also used in the repotting process (see Chapter 7). Figure 3-1
shows the kinds of tools covered in the following sections.
Pruners
You’ll need different types of pruning tools, depending on the
thickness of the plant part you’re removing.
Hand pruners
You’ll use hand pruners to cut thick creeping stems. There are
basically two types of hand pruners. An anvil type of hand pruner
has a flat cutting blade and can mash the stem tissue (which isn’t
what you want). I much prefer the other type of hand pruner — the
bypass type, which has a curved blade (refer to Figure 3-1). It makes
cleaner and closer cuts.

Scissors
All scissors are not created equal. I prefer those that are designed
for bonsai or flower arranging (like the scissors shown in Figure 3-1).
They’re extremely sharp and have large, comfortable vinyl hand
grips. Some are made of high-carbon steel that hold an edge for a
long time. Others are constructed of stainless steel and offer the
advantage of not rusting. The smaller scissors are really handy for
finesse work, like removing spent flower spikes as close as possi-
ble to the foliage and trimming delicate leaves. The heavier ones
are ideal for cutting thick stems.
Figure 3-1: Cutting tools — from left to right: thin knife, 
two pairs of scissors, bypass hand pruners, single-edge 
razor blade, and folding pruning saw.
Knives and blades
Knives and blades can come in very handy, but choosing the right
type is important. In the following sections, I guide you through the
types available.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
34

Knives
Knives are used most often to circle the inside of the pot to remove
the plant when its roots are packed into its container, especially
with clay pots. (You can usually cut plastic pots with sharp scissors
along the length of the pot to remove the plant.) A very-thin-bladed
knife, like the type used for filleting fish (refer to Figure 3-1), is very
handy because it’s easier to maneuver in tight spaces.
Razor blades
To be on the safe side, always use the single-edge type of razor
blade (refer to Figure 3-1). They’re perfect for making very precise
cuts when trimming edges of leaves or cutting apart divisions of
plants. Another great feature of these is that they’re so inexpensive
that you can throw them away after you’re done. Disposing of used
razor blades also prevents spreading disease to other plants and
saves you the hassle of sterilizing them.
Hand pruning saw
Using a hand pruning saw is bringing out the big gun. This tool is
most useful to cut very thick creeping stems when dividing plants.
You can also use them to score the roots when they’re very tightly
packed together or to cut away a very thick plastic pot when
you’re transplanting or repotting an orchid.
You can find various different types of these saws, but the ones
that are compact and folding are most handy. I find a small bladed
and fine-toothed type often used for cutting bamboo especially
useful (refer to Figure 3-1).
Potting Tools and Supplies
The tools and supplies in this section make the potting process
easier. For specific potting techniques and guidelines, check out
Chapter 7.
Potting tools
Potting is a combination of force and finesse. These tools make
the process easier and more effective.
Hammers
Regular steel-clawed hammers can be useful for breaking clay pots
containing overgrown plants that can’t be removed any other way.
But for most purposes, a rubber mallet (see Figure 3-2) comes in
more handy. It’s used frequently to pound in stakes or clamps that
hold newly transplanted or divided orchids in their pots.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Tools on Hand 35

Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
36
Dibbles and planting sticks
Getting the potting material to settle in around the roots of the
orchids is important because large air spaces can cause the orchid
roots to dry out or not form properly. Dibbles (refer to Figure 3-2)
and planting sticks are used to push the potting material into these
air spaces.
Torches for sterilizing tools
Dirty cutting and potting tools can spread diseases. Preventing dis-
ease by sterilizing any tools that come in direct contact with orchid
root and leaf tissue is always a good idea. You can use chemical
solutions to do this (for instance, a 1:10 ratio of household bleach
to water), but chemicals are very corrosive and some are toxic.
A very simple way to sterilize metal tools is to flame them with a
propane or butane torch (see Figure 3-3). Both are available in
small handheld sizes.
Potting supplies
The orchid tag that comes with the orchid or the one you make
yourself contains very important information that you want to pro-
tect. Knowing the correct name of the orchid is crucial information
when you’re looking up cultural information. Also, many times the
tag includes the orchid’s parents’ names, which can also provide
helpful cultural clues. If you want to enter your orchid in a show, it
may be disqualified without proper labeling.
Figure 3-2: Potting tools — clockwise from top-left: rubber mallet, dibble, 
potting clamps, labels, marking pens.

Figure 3-3: This compact, lightweight, 
self-striking butane torch is a breeze to use.
So the important message is: Keep a legible label in the pots of all
your orchids. Maintaining a separate list of your orchids is also a
good idea. To make it easier, assign numbers to each of your plants
and place this number on the label. This serves as a safety net in
case the label is damaged or lost.
Labels
Many types of labels are available, in all different sizes and colors.
Which size or color you choose is a personal choice — the mate-
rial they’re made of is a more important consideration. Table 3-1
lists some pros and cons of each kind of label.

Clips and stakes
Numerous types of stakes and clamps are used to hold the orchid in
its pot when it has been transplanted and its roots are inadequate,
by themselves, to anchor the plant. Figure 3-2 shows some samples
of metal stakes. Bamboo stakes are also available.
Watering Accessories
Mastering the art of watering is one of the critical keys to success
in orchid culture (see Chapter 6). These accessories deliver water,
and in some cases fertilizer, gently and effectively.
Water breakers
Water breakers are attached to the end of a hose to diffuse the
water and prevent it from washing out the orchid potting material
(see Figure 3-4). They deliver a large volume of water, but in a very
gentle way — and they work really well.
You can find water breakers that deliver different volumes and
water patterns such as mist, fine shower, jet, or flood. Some water-
ing heads can be dialed to whichever of these forms you want —
very handy.
You’re usually better off choosing the water breaker that delivers
the finest steam of water possible. This will be most useful for the
broadest range of watering applications.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Tools on Hand 39

Figure 3-4: A common type of water breaker.
Water-flow regulators
Water-flow regulators are attached to the hose before the water
breaker to regulate the volume of water. The simplest ones are
manual on/off valves. I find the thumb or squeeze valves are easi-
est to use more precisely and determine the volume of water you
want to deliver to your orchids (see Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5: Thumb valves make watering easier.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
40

Hoses
Buy the best-quality hose you can find. The better ones will not
kink and will last much longer.
If hoses tend to get in the way, consider the newer “coil” hoses.
They take up much less space and can be attached to a sink spigot.
Again, buy the best grade you can find — the cheaper ones tend to
kink very easily.
Watering cans
Many of the sprinkling or watering cans on the market are close to
worthless for using on orchids. They deliver too much water too fast
and are awkward to use in tight indoor spaces. The best type to use,
for most situations, is one that holds 1⁄2 to 1 gallon (2 to 4 liters), has
a long spout (so you can reach orchids in the back row), and has a
removable water breaker (sometimes called a rose) on the end of
its spout that delivers a very fine stream of water (see Figure 3-6).
The watering can may be made of metal or plastic, but the water
breaker should be made of metal, preferably a nonrusting one, like
copper.
Figure 3-6: The most useful watering can is one with a long spout.
Sprayers and misters
You can use sprayers and misters for misting the orchids to tem-
porarily increase the humidity, to clean the leaves, or for applying
pesticides. If you’re going to use any chemicals in them, the plastic
sprayers are less prone to being affected by these corrosive mate-
rials so they’re a better choice than metal ones.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Tools on Hand 41

One type of hand sprayer that I’ve found particularly effective for
applying insecticides is a teat sprayer because its spray head
points up instead of straight forward like standard sprayers. These
are actually used to wash off cow udders (hence, the name), so
they’re sold at farm-supply stores. But for orchid growers, they
serve admirably to apply these chemicals to the undersides of
leaves, where the bugs usually hang out (see Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-7: A teat sprayer has a nozzle that points up so you can reach under 
the leaves.
Fertilizer injectors
Commercial growers use a device called a fertilizer injector that
“injects” into the water a small amount of water-soluble fertilizer
each time the plant is watered. In this way, the orchids are con-
stantly fed a very diluted amount of fertilizer instead of larger
amounts every two weeks or so, as is frequently done. These units
tend to be on the expensive side and may be a luxury item, unless
you have quite a large number of orchids to fertilize.
A much cheaper way around this is to use a simple siphon mixer.
Several brands are on the market, but they all work basically the
same. You attach the siphon mixer to the spigot before the hose. A
flexible hollow rubber tube is inserted into a concentrated solution
of fertilizer. When the spigot is turned, a suction action created by
the water flowing through the hose draws this concentrate through
the tubing so it flows into the water in the hose and is diluted while
it’s being applied to the orchid plants.

Chapter 3: Having the Right Tools on Hand 43
To get the most benefit from a siphon mixer, here are a few tips:
 Use a completely soluble fertilizer so it won’t plug up
the unit.
 Use a water breaker that functions with a low volume of
water. The water flow coming out the end of the hose will be
significantly reduced when the siphon mixer is attached.
 Be sure the unit you have also has a backflow preventer.
That way, when you turn off the water breaker, but not the
spigot, the back pressure won’t cause the concentrated fertil-
izer solution to flush back into your house water or back into
your fertilizer concentrate.
 To be on the safe side, use the siphon mixer only for apply-
ing fertilizers, not pesticides.
 Be careful to dilute the fertilizer to the correct concentration.
These usually inject the fertilizer on a 1:16 fertilizer-to-water
ratio, but always read the directions that come with the unit.
Deionization and reverse 
osmosis units
Deionization and reverse osmosis units are used to purify your
well or tap water to reduce or eliminate concentrations of salts
that can be harmful to some particularly sensitive orchids. The
units aren’t cheap and can be cumbersome and bothersome to
use. So, before you consider getting one, make sure you need it.
Here are some things to consider before you buy:
 If your orchids and other houseplants have been growing,
then don’t worry about using a deionization or reverse osmo-
sis unit. Most households can get by with the water they have.
 If you’ve had water problems or just want to be on the safe
side, check with your public water provider to see what the
average total dissolved solids (TDS) is in your water. If you
have your own well, you’ll need to have a test done at a pri-
vate water lab.
• If you have 60 parts per million (ppm) or less of TDS and
less than 5 ppm of sodium, you’re home free. Your water
is of good quality for orchids.
• If your water tests at 60 to 120 ppm and you have up to
10 ppm of sodium, all except the most sensitive orchids
should be okay, but you’re on the edge with water quality.

• If you have readings higher than 120 ppm for TDS or
10 ppm of sodium, you may have more orchid-growing
success if you use better-quality water. To do this, you
could collect rainwater (you can buy special rain barrels
for this purpose that hook up to your downspout), or
consider buying a reverse osmosis or deionization unit.
If you’re on the higher end of the TDS level, be particularly
careful not to overfertilize.
Humidifiers, Heaters, and
Ventilation Equipment
Your home environment is designed to make you, not necessarily
your plants, comfortable. Fortunately, many of your living require-
ments are the same as the living requirements for most of the
orchids in this book. In some cases, though, you’ll need to modify
your orchids’ growing space to better suit them.
Humidifiers
The importance of providing sufficient humidity for better health
for both you and your orchids is detailed in Chapter 5. To humidify
an entire room, there are at least three possible approaches, cov-
ered in the following sections.
Evaporative-pad humidifiers
With these units, fans blow across a moisture-laden pad that sits in a
reservoir of water. Evaporative-pad humidifiers are my first choice
for home humidification because
 They’re reasonably priced and readily available.
 They don’t spray the room with droplets of water that can
carry mineral deposits and bacteria.
 They circulate air at the same time.
 They only increase the humidity to about 50 to 60 percent
(most have an adjustable humidistat, which measures humidity).
This is a level that is beneficial to plants, but not sufficient to
cause moisture damage to the house.
 They require no plumbing and very little maintenance — just
change the moisture pads one or two times a season.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
44

Cool-mist humidifiers
Cool-mist humidifiers can be effective for small areas, but with con-
stant use, they can cause deposits of minerals on leaves and be a
bacteria carrier.
Greenhouse-type foggers or humidifiers
If you have a greenhouse or a very large growing area that really
needs a lot of humidity, a greenhouse-type fogger or humidifier is
for you. These units can be pricey. They’re plumbed into a constant
water supply that is controlled by a float (much like a toilet bowl).
The humidity level can be regulated by a separately purchased
humidistat.
Ventilation
Adequate air circulation is very important in orchid culture.
Fortunately, many convenient and inexpensive pieces of equip-
ment do this job admirably. Here are some of the best choices:
 Ceiling fans: These are readily available and do a super job
of moving large volumes of air in a figure-8 pattern at a low
velocity. Most of them have reversible motors, so they can
either be set to pull the cooler air from the floor (usually
the summer setting) or push hot air down from the ceiling
(usually the winter setting).
 Oscillating and standard fans: You can find these in all blade
sizes, and most have variable speeds. All will do the job, but
you’re better off getting one with a larger blade size and run-
ning it at low speed. This will move more air but not at as high
a velocity, so the plants won’t become dehydrated by a strong
air current. Also, for oscillating types, splurge on a better-grade
model that has metal or heavy-duty gears; otherwise, they’ll
strip in short order, and you’ll then have a stationary fan.
 Muffin fans: These are very small, handy fans (3 to 6 inches/
8 to 15 cm) that are used to cool electronic equipment like
computers. They’re great for bringing a gentle, quiet breeze
to a small corner of your growing area. You can find them at
electronic or computer-supply stores or in catalogs.
For more information on the importance of ventilation and air
movement, see Chapter 5.
Chapter 3: Having the Right Tools on Hand 45

Heating
If you’re like most people, you’ll rely on your home heating system
to provide most of the heat for your orchids. You can supplement
that with small electric heaters or water-resistant heating mats
commonly used to start seeds. If you’re growing under lights, you
can enclose your growing area in plastic film to help retain heat
produced by the lights and ballasts.
Thermometers and hygrometers
I have to admit, and my wife will quickly concur, that I’m a nut about
temperature and humidity monitoring. I’ve got remote sensors all
over my home that tell me maximum and minimum temperature and
humidity levels each day. As I explain in Chapter 5, temperature
differentials are important to know about if you’re interested in get-
ting your orchids to bloom. Thanks to modern digital thermometers
and hygrometers that are simple to use and not expensive, you can
keep track of temperature and humidity with little effort.

T
he main purpose for growing orchids is to enjoy their
unmatched beauty in your home. In this chapter, I walk you
through tips that will make your experiences with orchids more
successful and pleasurable.
Caring for Orchids in 
Their New Home
Bringing an orchid plant into its new home can be traumatic for
both the plant and you! You have to get to know each other. Most
orchids you buy will have come from a very high-light, high-humidity
environment of a commercial greenhouse. You bring them into
your home environment, which is usually less bright with lower
humidity, so the plant has to make some adjustments. Doing this
with the least amount of distress is your goal, and in this section,
I help you get there.
In Chapter 5, I give you the details of routine orchid care, but here I
want to give you some tips that will make the short-term transition
easier for both of you.

If the plant is in bloom
Here are some tips that will make the flowers on your new orchid
last longer:
 Place the plant somewhere in your house that’s bright, but
where it won’t get direct sunlight, except possibly in the
morning. Too much harsh sunlight can bleach out the flowers.
 Keep the plant on the cool side — not above about 75°F
(about 24°C). Flowers stay fresher longer this way.
 Be sure to keep the plant well watered. Even though the
orchid plant stops growing much when it’s in bloom, the
leaves and flowers still need water.
 Don’t let any bees or flies in the room where your orchids
are blooming. If the bees or flies pollinate them, the flowers
will collapse afterward.
 Don’t put the plant close to ripe fruit. Fruit gives off ethylene
gas, which can cause flowers to collapse prematurely.
 Keep your orchid plants away from strong fumes like paint
thinners or other pollutants. These can cause the blossoms
to fade.
 Don’t spray the flowers with water or place the blooming
plant in a room that is highly humid with no air movement.
This can cause spotting on the flowers from fungal diseases.
If the plant is not in bloom
Before you add your new, not-yet-blooming orchid to your collec-
tion, follow these tips:
 Look under the leaves and at the younger growth to make
sure there are no bugs.
 To be on the safe side, isolate this new plant from your col-
lection for at least three weeks. This will allow time for hidden
insect eggs to hatch out.
 As a further precaution, spray the plant thoroughly with an
insecticidal soap. Use a paper towel to wipe off the excess
spray. This will not only kill any soft-bodied insects but will
also clean the leaves.
 Consider repotting the orchid into your own potting mix.
That way you’ll be assured that the potting mix is fresh and
you’ll know its watering requirements.

Staking and Grooming Your
Blooming Orchids
Orchids deserve to look their best when they’re putting on their
show. Proper staking and grooming can make a big difference in
how orchid flowers appear.
Figuring out how to stake
Flowers and spikes of orchids can be heavy and, if they aren’t
staked properly, they’ll open at an awkward and disconcerting
angle. This can be a distraction, because the most interesting and
alluring perspective to view orchids is usually the head-on view.
Staking techniques vary somewhat with the type of orchid. The
two major types are the spray orchids, like phalaenopsis and
oncidiums, or those with single flowers or just a few on one spike,
like cattleyas and most paphiopedilums.
For spray-type orchids
Be sure to start this process before these orchids are actually in
flower. This will ensure that the flowers are oriented correctly
when they open. Here are the steps I recommend:
1. As soon as the flower spike is about 12 inches (30 cm)
long, insert a vertical bamboo stake (you can get a green
one, so it blends in better) close to where the spike origi-
nates at the base of the plant (see Figure 4-1).
2. As you insert the stake, twist it to work it around roots to
minimize damage to them.
3. Attach the first tie on the lower part of the spike close to
the first node (the bump in the flower stem).
Use twist-ties or Velcro, not sharp string or wire, which
could damage the stem.
4. Attach another tie a few inches higher on the flower spike.
5. Put additional ties every few inches as the flower spike
grows.
6. Place the last tie a few inches below where the first
flower buds are forming.
This allows the spike to form a natural arch with the first
flower open at the highest point and the others gracefully
following suit right below that one.
Chapter 4: How I Love Thy Orchid: Enjoying the Orchid’s Beauty 49

Figure 4-1: Staking flower spikes of spray-type orchids like 
phalaenopsis or oncidiums.
Flower spikes always grow in the direction of the strongest light.
After the flower spike reaches about 12 inches (30 cm) tall and the
buds are starting to form, never change the plant’s orientation to
the light source. If you do, the spike will try to reorient itself and
you’ll end up with a twisted, distorted spike with flowers opening
in all directions.
When the flowers are fully open, they’ll stay that way, so you can
then move the plant anywhere you want.
For single- or few-flowered orchids
Staking these orchids is simpler. When the bud or buds start to
swell on the flower spike, insert a vertical bamboo stake close to
where the spike originates at the base of the plant.

Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
50

Be sure to do this before the flower has opened so that the bud will
orient itself to gravity. If the flower spike is at an angle, the flower
will adjust itself to open perpendicular to the angle the flower stem
is pointing. If you tie the spike up after it has opened, it will keep
its original orientation and will look awkward.
In the last few years, orchid growers have discovered one of the
best ways to attach upright flowering stems to bamboo or wood
stakes: spring-operated baby hair clips! They’re available in all
colors, are inexpensive, and frequently are formed in whimsical
shapes of butterflies or dragonflies, which fit well with the orchid
look. Plus, they work well!
Helping your orchids 
look their best
After growing the plants for months on the windowsill, under
lights, or in a greenhouse, they can look a little rough around the
edges. The leaves are probably dusty and/or blemished with chem-
ical deposits, older leaves may be wilted or dead, and some of the
tips of the leaves may be brown.
When the plants are in flower and you want to show them off to
their best in your home or get them ready to exhibit in an orchid
show, here are a few suggestions to keep in mind:
 Clean their leaves. A simple way to polish the leaves is with
milk. Dampen a paper towel with milk and rub off the blem-
ishes. This will give a very attractive sheen that is harmless to
the plant.
 Carefully remove any dead or severely damaged leaves.
 If you’re planning to bring your orchid to a show, be sure
that you tape to the pot the name of your orchid plus your
own name so that you don’t lose the plant. Also, make a list
of what plants you’ve entered so you have a record.
 Trim off the brown tips of leaves with very sharp scissors.
The sharper they are, the cleaner the cut and the less leaf-
tissue damage will result. When trimming, follow the natural
shape of the leaf, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Chapter 4: How I Love Thy Orchid: Enjoying the Orchid’s Beauty 51

Figure 4-2: Trim off brown tips of leaves following the natural curvature 
of the leaf.
Displaying orchid plants 
in your home
When you’re showing off your prized blooming plants in your
home, here a few tips to keep in mind:
 Be sure to protect your furniture by placing the orchid
plant pots on waterproof pads, like cork platters.
 If you place your plants on saucers, be sure they’re water-
proof. Terra cotta platters are porous and moisture will seep
through and can cause serious damage to unprotected wood
furniture.
 Place felt or rubber protectors under cachepots, platters, or
saucers so your furniture won’t be scratched.
 Place the blooming plants where they get bright light but
not hot, late-afternoon light, so the flowers will last longer.
 If the growing pot is encrusted or ugly, insert it into a larger
ornamental pot or basket. Choose simple green, white, or
neutral colors that don’t compete with the orchid flowers.
 Place a layer of sheet moss or Spanish moss on the surface
of the pot. This is a nice touch for covering up the sometimes
unattractive potting material.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
52

 Display the orchid on a pedestal or higher elevation so you
can view it at eye level (see Figure 4-3). Few orchids are as
attractive when they’re viewed from above.
 Think about how you will light your orchids to display them
best. Many people are only able to view their orchids during the
work week in the evening, so artificial lighting plays an impor-
tant part in viewing them. Track lights work great. Use halogen
or other bulbs that produce white light or as close to sunlight
as possible so the orchid flowers will be rendered accurately.
Regular incandescent light produces a yellow/red light that
will make reds glow but that really dulls blues and greens.
 Group orchids with other tropical foliage plants. These pro-
vide an attractive backdrop for the orchid flowers.
Figure 4-3: Placing plants on pedestals 
and inserting their growing pot inside 
a more ornamental one draws attention 
to the best attributes of the orchids — 
their flowers.
Arranging orchid flowers
Nothing is more elegant than orchids in a flower arrangement.
They’ve always represented the pinnacle of good taste and sophisti-
cation. The key to using them for such purposes is to keep it simple
and not to let the elegance of the orchids get overwhelmed by too
many other elements.
Chapter 4: How I Love Thy Orchid: Enjoying the Orchid’s Beauty 53

Understanding the three basic flower-design elements
When it comes to flower arranging, flowers and greens comes in
three basic shapes — line, mass, and filler. All of these play a key
part in the construction of an attractive flower arrangement:
 Line flowers are tall and are used to give your arrangement
height and width. Various branched orchids with buds (for
example, oncidiums and cymbidiums) are used to create this
effect.
 Mass flowers give your bouquet weight or mass and are gen-
erally round or full-faced. They’re usually the focal point of
color and interest in a bouquet. Examples are cattleyas and
their relatives, as well as paphiopedilums and angraecums.
 Filler flowers have stems with many little flowers and usually
have fine textured foliage. Examples are miniature oncidiums.
Here are some tips on how to make simple, yet elegant, 
arrangements:
 Line flowers, by themselves, can make a striking arrangement
in a tall, cylindrical vase. Select a vase or container that is in
proportion to the flowers. The vase should be about one-half
to one-third the size of the total arrangement. For instance, 
3-foot-tall spikes of cymbidiums or oncidiums need a vase 
12 to 18 inches tall.
 You can arrange mass flowers by themselves in a low, wide
vase or container (see Figure 4-4).
 A small arrangement of filler flowers by themselves can add
a light, elegant touch to any room. Many of these filler flowers
are well suited for drying.
Part I: Welcoming Orchids into Your Life 
54
A super-simple homemade orchid 
flower preservative
Here’s an easy recipe for making your cut orchids last longer. Combine one 12-ounce
can of a lemon-flavored soda drink (like Sprite or 7-Up), an equal quantity of water, and
1 teaspoon of household bleach. The sugar in the soft drink serves as food for the
flower, the citric acid lowers the pH (increases the acidity), and the bleach kills the
bacteria in the water that can plug up the water-conducting network in the flower stem.

 Some flowers can be used as more than one element. For
example, phalaenopsis sprays, especially the multifloral types,
can be used as line elements, while large single flowers can be
used as mass flowers.
Figure 4-4: This miniature arrangement 
contains only three small cattleya flowers 
for the mass and three pointed leaves for 
the line element.
Supporting the orchid flower stems
Having some method of supporting the stems of orchids in an
arrangement, so you can arrange them to face the direction you
prefer, is usually a good idea. Here are several methods and materi-
als you can use:
 For a clear vase, add marbles or rocks.
 Crossing the top opening of the vase in a tic-tac-toe pattern
of florist’s tape works well.
 Frogs (pincushions on which the orchid stems are impaled)
work well in shallower containers.
 Florist foam is most popular with professional arrangers
because it’s easy to use, effective, and retains water well so
that the flowers last. It’s usually used in low containers.
Don’t cut the orchid flowers until they’re fully open. Otherwise,
they may never have their proper shape or complete color.
Chapter 4: How I Love Thy Orchid: Enjoying the Orchid’s Beauty 55

Making your orchid arrangement last longer
To make your cut flowers last longer, follow these suggestions:
 For cymbidiums, wait about ten days to two weeks after
they’ve flowered before cutting; for cattleyas, wait several
days. Cut the orchids only when they’ve fully opened.
 Before you put the orchids into a vase, their stems should
be recut at an angle under water. To keep them fresh, recut
them every several days.
 Condition the orchids first, before arranging them. Place
their stems in warm (180°F/82°C), fresh water and let them sit
somewhere cool (around 50°F/10°C) overnight.
 Make sure all leaves that will be submerged under water in
the vase are removed.
 To use orchids’ short stems (like cattleyas) in taller arrange-
ments, insert the flower stem into orchid tubes (water-
holding test tubes, available at your local florist) and then
tape the tubes to a wood stake for more height.
 Add a commercial or homemade solution of floral preserva-
tive (see the nearby sidebar) to the warm water containing
the flowers. Change this water and solution every three to
four days.
 Place the arrangement out of the direct rays of sunlight and
in a cool room.
 Double the life of your orchid flowers by placing the
arrangement in the refrigerator at night or when you’re
away from home.

rowing orchids is easy, but as with anything, you
need to know the right things to do or not to do.
In this part, I tell you what environments orchids prefer
and give you all you need to know to make your home the
perfect growing space for these tropical beauties. You’ll
ﬁnd information on light, humidity, temperature, and ven-
tilation requirements. I cover proper watering in detail, a
big problem for many beginners. I also demystify the
process of purchasing and using fertilizers on orchids.
Dividing and repotting orchids is a daunting task for many
new growers. In this part, I give you detailed drawings
showing you step-by-step methods and techniques to use
for various types of orchids, so you can do this job with
no fear.
One great aspect of orchids is that they get bigger and
better every year. When this happens, you have the
opportunity to multiply your orchids and share them with
friends or use them for trading for other desired varieties.
I’ll show you, in detail, various ways to do this.
Healthy orchids are happy orchids. Fortunately, orchids
are not a buggy lot, but they sometimes do succumb to
various diseases and insects. I show you the safe and
effective way to keep these unwanted organisms in check.
After reading Part II, you’ll be ready to grow orchids as the
pros do.

 Getting the temperature right
O
rchids are not difficult to grow. But, like all plants, they have
certain needs that have to be met so they can perform their
best. In this chapter, I detail orchids’ most fundamental require-
ments and the simplest, most effective ways to provide them, based
on my 40 years of experience growing orchids on my windowsills,
under lights, and in a greenhouse.
If you put a little effort into modifying your growing environment to
help your orchids feel at home, it’ll pay off in healthy plants that
provide plenty of flowers.
Let There Be Light!
Light is essential for all green plants, including orchids. Light,
water, and carbon dioxide are the raw materials plants use to pro-
duce their food. Providing enough light is the most challenging
requirement for indoor gardeners in areas of the country like the
Northeast and the Midwest, who experience short days and low
light during the winter. Fortunately, plenty of species and hybrids
of orchids don’t require super-high light intensities and so are
more suited to these climates.
If you’re blessed with naturally high light — like the kind found in
Hawaii, California, and Florida — you can grow both the high- and

the low-light-intensity orchids. You just have to use greenhouse
shading or light-reducing draperies to satisfy those orchids requir-
ing modest amounts of light.
The ins and outs of light
Orchids are traditionally categorized by their light requirements —
high, medium, and low. Turn to Chapter 2 for a simple way to
determine the intensity of your light source, called the shadow
test. Most orchids are in the medium light category. You can easily
grow orchids in the low to medium light categories under artificial
lights or on bright windowsills. From a practical point of view, the
orchids with high light requirements are most successfully grown
in bright greenhouses.
Greenhouses: Your high light source
Greenhouses, like the one shown in Figure 5-1, are the most effi-
cient collectors of natural light.
The amount of light penetrating the greenhouse is determined by
the glazing material used, its geographic location, how it’s sited on
the land, and whether it’s shaded by surrounding trees or a com-
mercial shading compound or fabric.
The greenhouse option is the most expensive, but you don’t have
to own one to grow most of the orchids in this book.
Figure 5-1: High-quality greenhouse setups provide shading and 
efficient use of space to accommodate as many orchids as possible.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
60

Windowsills: Not all windowsills are created equal
Windowsills are the most readily available and cost-effective source
of light. The amount of light windowsill growing can provide is pri-
marily determined by
 The size of the windows.
 Whether there is an overhanging roof: This can make a dif-
ference in how much light will actually reach the plants (see
Figure 5-2).
 How far back the windows are recessed: Bay or bow win-
dows expose the plants to more light than other types of win-
dows (see Figure 5-3).
 The direction the windows face: Whether the windows face
north, south, east, or west makes a big difference in the
amount and quality of light the orchids will receive:
• South-facing window: This is the brightest window,
so it offers the most possibilities. It’s an ideal location
for those orchids that demand the strongest light.
You can place most of the other less-light-demanding
orchids a few feet back from the window, or you can
diffuse the light from the window with a sheer curtain.
Note: This exposure can get hot, especially during the
summer.
Figure 5-2: The extent of the roof overhang will make a difference in the amount
of light the orchids will receive.
Morning and afternoon
Midday
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 61

• East-facing window: This window offers morning sun-
light, which is bright but not too hot. During the spring,
summer, and fall, this is usually an ideal exposure for
most orchids in this book, except those that require
extremely high light (like vandas). During the short, dark
days of winter, many of these same orchids usually
prefer a south-facing window.
• West-facing window: This window receives as much
light as the east window but, because it gets afternoon
light, it’s much hotter — so this isn’t as desirable a loca-
tion as the east-facing window. If you need to use a west-
facing window, make sure your orchids don’t dry out too
much because of this increased heat.
• North-facing window: A north-facing window simply
doesn’t provide enough light to sustain the healthy
growth of orchids. Use it for low-light plants like ferns.
 How far the plants are placed from the windows.
 The age and condition of the glass: Tinted and reflective
glass can dramatically reduce light intensity, so it’s usually
not recommended. No matter what kind of glass you have,
keep your windows clean, especially during the winter when
the light intensity is low, so your orchids will receive as much
light as possible.
 The time of the year: During the winter, the sun is lower in the
sky and the day length is shorter. The opposite is true during
the summer. As a result, a south-facing window may be fine for
certain orchids during the winter, but you may have to move
the orchids to an east-facing window during the summer.
Listening to your orchids
Different types of orchids have varying light requirements because
they naturally grow in a wide range of habitats. Some thrive in full
sun on exposed rocks, while others are at home in dense jungle
shade.
The leaves of the plant give you some clue as to their light require-
ments (see Figure 5-4). Those with very tough, thick, stout, and
sometimes narrow leaves frequently are adapted to very high
light intensity. When the leaves are softer, more succulent,
and wider, this is usually a clue that they’re from a lower-light
environment.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
62

Figure 5-3: Bay windows increase the size of the growing 
area and the amount of light the plant receives, because 
light can penetrate from multiple angles.
Figure 5-4: The type of leaf indicates an orchid’s light requirements.
Your orchids will tell you by their growth habits and leaf color if
they’re getting adequate, too little, or too much light. When
orchids are getting enough light, you’ll notice the following:
 The mature leaves are usually a medium to light green.
 The new leaves are the same size or larger and the same
shape as the mature ones.
Very Bright Light
Leaves gradually become
broader and softer
Lower Light
Larger soft green
leaf
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 63

 The foliage is stiff and compact, not floppy.
 The plants are flowering at approximately the same time they
did the year before.
One of the most frequent results of inadequate light is soft, dark
green foliage with no flowering. Another symptom of inadequate
light is stretching, where the distance between the new leaves on
the stem of orchids like paphiopedilum, phalaenopsis, or vandas is
greater than with the older, mature leaves. On other types of
orchids, the new leaves tend to be longer and thinner.
When orchids get too much light, their leaves turn a yellow-green
color or take on a reddish cast and may appear stunted. In extreme
cases, the leaves show circular or oval sunburn spots (see Figure
5-5). The sunburn is actually caused by the leaf overheating.
Although, in itself, this leaf damage may not cause extreme harm
to the plant if the damage is isolated to a small area, it does make
the plant unsightly.
If the sunburn occurs at the growing point, it can kill that leaf or
the entire plant. Higher light intensities than are usually recom-
mended are possible with some orchids if you increase the ventila-
tion to lower these elevated leaf temperatures. Some orchid
cut-flower growers like to push their orchids with the highest light
intensity they can take without burning to yield the maximum
amount of blooms. However, for most hobby growers, I don’t rec-
ommend this.

No natural light? No problem!
Artificial light sources make it possible for everyone without green-
houses or bright windowsills to enjoy growing orchids in their
homes. Although the limitations of what can be grown under these
light sources are only restricted by equipment and electricity
costs, it’s a very practical method of growing for low- to medium-
light orchids.
Wading through the many lighting options available today can be
a daunting task, especially for beginners. In this section, I help
you out.
Fluorescent lights
Fluorescent systems are still the most accessible and economical
lighting systems to buy. Three-tiered light carts, like the one shown
in Figure 5-6, are highly versatile and practical. Most of them are
about 2 feet wide by 4 feet long, so their three shelves provide 24
square feet of growing area. If you grow compact orchids, this will
be enough space to have at least one or more orchids in bloom
year-round. If you collect miniatures, it will provide a growing
space adequate for an entire collection. The convenience of such a
cart can’t be beat. You can place it in a heated garage, in a base-
ment, or in a spare bedroom.
When the orchids start to produce their tall orchid spikes, there
usually isn’t enough head room under most fixed-height light units
to accommodate this growing spike. At that point, you can move
the orchids to a windowsill or use a light fixture that can be raised
as the flower spikes develop, like the one shown in Figure 5-7.
Which bulbs or lamps you should burn in your fixtures is a highly
debated topic. Years ago, the only real choice was cool white
and warm white tubes. Some people still feel that a 50/50 mix of
these tubes is the best option, because they’re bright and very
inexpensive.
Over 40 years ago, Sylvania started manufacturing Gro-Lux tubes —
designed to provide light that more closely reflected the spectrum
of light that plants used in photosynthesis, the process that plants
use to produce their own food. This started a new race to produce
the “best” plant bulb. The evolution of lamps has gone from the
Gro-Lux to wide-spectrum bulbs and now to full-spectrum bulbs.
The light cast by the full-spectrum lamp is supposed to most
closely resemble natural sunlight. Viewed under these lamps,
colors of the flowers are rendered more accurately.
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 65

Figure 5-6: Four-tube, rather than 
two-tube, units are highly recommended 
for low- to medium-light orchids.
Figure 5-7: An adjustable light 
fixture like this one is very handy 
for accommodating developing 
flower spikes.
I’ve grown orchids well under all these types of lamps. If you want
to have the flowers appear most naturally colored under the lights
and don’t mind paying a premium for the lamps, the full-spectrum
types are the best choice. The most economical pick — and still
satisfactory — is the 50/50 ratio of warm-white to cool-white
lamps. A compromise would be a blend of half warm-white and
cool-white tubes and half wide- or full-spectrum lamps.

High-intensity-discharge lights
Newer to the artificial-light choices are high-intensity-discharge
lights. These are very efficient in their production of light and are
especially useful where you want to grow orchids requiring higher
light intensities than fluorescent lamps can provide and/or where
you want a greater working distance between the lights and plants
(see Figure 5-8).
High-intensity-discharge lights do have the disadvantage of pro-
ducing quite a bit of heat, so make sure not to get the plants too
close to the bulbs.

The two most frequently used lamps for these systems are metal
halide (MH) and high-pressure sodium (HPS). HPS is more energy-
efficient than MH, but the light it emits is orange-yellow and dis-
torts the color of the flowers and foliage. MH produces blue light
that is more pleasing to the eye. Some manufacturers now produce
lamps that combine the advantages of both.
Another newer option is the high-intensity compact fluorescent
light. The fixtures for these look much like high-intensity-discharge
(HID) units. They don’t produce quite as much light as HID, but
they have the advantage of producing little heat — so there is
much less likelihood of orchids being burned.
If you’re a beginner light gardener, I recommend starting with 
fluorescent-light setups. I find them to be most practical. Later,
if you have the need, you can give the high-intensity-discharge
lamps a try.
Humidity: Orchids’ Favorite
Condition
Humidity is something you can’t see, but you can feel it on a
muggy summer day or in a steamy greenhouse. The vast majority
of orchids are from the tropics, where high rainfall and humidity
prevail. When orchids get enough humidity, they grow lushly and
their leaves have a healthy shine.
Insufficient humidity can stunt an orchid’s growth and, in severe
cases, it can cause brown tips on leaves. It can also contribute to
buds falling off (known as bud blast), leaves wrinkling, and drying
of the sheaths (the tubelike structures that surround the develop-
ing flower buds), which can result in twisted or malformed flowers.
During the winter, homes, especially those in cold climates with
forced-air heating systems, usually have a relative humidity of
about 15 percent. Because this is the average humidity found in
most desert areas, you have to do something to raise the humidity
to at least 50 percent — a level that will make orchids happy.
For greenhouses, this process is a relatively simple matter. You can
either regularly hose down the walkways or hook up foggers and
commercial humidifiers to a humidistat so that the entire opera-
tion is automatic.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
68

If you’re growing your orchids in your home, you’ll need a different
approach. High humidity levels that would be no problem in a
greenhouse will peel the paint, plaster, and wallpaper off the walls
of your house. Assuming that’s not the look you’re going for, you
can take several steps to get to the desirable humidity range with-
out causing damage to your house.
If you can, put your orchids in a naturally damp area, like the
basement.
Wherever you put your orchids, use a room humidifier. I find the
best type of humidifier is an evaporative-pad humidifier (in which
fans blow across a moisture-laden pad that sits in a reservoir of
water). An evaporative-pad humidifier is usually better than a mist
humidifier, because, unlike a mist humidifier, it doesn’t leave your
orchids with a white film (from the minerals in the water being
deposited on the leaves).
To further increase the humidity level, you can try growing the
plants on top of a waterproof tray filled with pebbles. Add water to
the tray so that the level is just below the surface of the pebbles,
then put the plants on top of this bed of damp gravel. The problem
that I find with this system is that the pots, especially the heavy
clay ones, frequently sink into the pebbles, resulting in the media
in the pots getting soggy and, after repeated waterings, the pebbles
becoming clogged with algae and being a repository for insects
and various disease organisms.
The approach that I think works much better is to add sections of
egg-crate louvers (sold in home-supply stores for diffusing fluores-
cent lights) to the trays (see Figure 5-9). You can cut this material
with a hacksaw to whatever size you need. It’s rigid so it will support
the plants above the water, and the water is more exposed to air, so
more humidity results. The grating is simple to clean — just remove
and spray it with warm water. To prevent algae or disease buildup,
you can add a disinfectant like Physan to the water in the trays.
Misting is another way to increase humidity. This works okay, but
in order for it to be effective, you need to do it several times a day,
because the water usually evaporates very quickly. A problem with
misting is that, if your water source is mineral-laden, your orchid’s
leaves may become encrusted in white — not only is this unsightly,
but it keeps light from penetrating to the leaves. A benefit to mist-
ing is that it can clean the dust from the leaves.
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 69

is a simple way to increase humidity, and it’s easy to keep clean.

Blasted bud blast!
Nothing is more disheartening than having the buds of your orchids shrivel up right
before they open! This is referred to as bud blast and is caused when the orchid
undergoes different types of stress. Here are some of the specific causes of this
exasperating event:
 Low humidity
 Hot air from furnaces or cool, dry air form air-conditioners directly blowing on
the orchid plant
 Over- or underwatering
 Poor root development
 Temperatures that are too high or too low
 Water standing in the buds or bud sheaths
 Dramatic change in the orchids’ environment, like bringing the plants from out-
side to inside
 Natural-gas leaks in the house
 Ethylene gas from ripened fruit
 Light that’s too bright on the developing flower buds
 Pollution, such as smog

Fresh Air, Please!
In most tropical lands where orchids reside, they luxuriate in inces-
sant, but gentle, trade winds. Air movement in a growing environ-
ment ensures a more uniform air temperature and dramatically
reduces disease problems by preventing the leaves from staying
wet too long. It also evenly distributes the gas (carbon dioxide)
that is produced by the plants in the dark and used by the plants
to produce their food during the daylight hours.
You don’t want to create gale-force winds in your growing area, but
you do want to produce enough airflow to cause the leaves of the
orchids to very lightly sway in the breeze. I’ve found that two of
the most effective methods for providing such an airflow in both a
hobby greenhouse and an indoor growing area are ceiling fans and
oscillating fans.
Ceiling fans
Ceiling fans move a huge volume of air at a low velocity in a circular
pattern, so they effectively prevent severe temperature differences,
are inexpensive to operate (they use about the same electricity as a
100-watt bulb), are quiet, have variable speeds, and are easy to
install. They stand up well to moist conditions, especially if you buy
the outdoor types. Another nice feature is that you can adjust the
air-circulation pattern on most of them so that they can either push
warm air down (the recommended winter setting) or pull cool air
up (usually the best summer setting), as shown in Figure 5-10.
Oscillating fans
Oscillating fans are also a good choice, because they effectively
cover large areas with a constantly changing airflow pattern with-
out excessively drying off the plants.
Figure 5-10: Ceiling fans can be set either to push warm air down (best for
winter) or pull cool air up (best for summer).
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 71

If you decide to go with oscillating fans, splurge for the better-
grade ones. Fans that are very inexpensive have plastic gears that
strip easily, so the oscillating feature won’t last long.
Muffin fans
You may have small hot or cold spots in your greenhouse, win-
dowsill, or light cart where just a touch of airflow is needed. This is
where small muffin fans, frequently sold for cooling computers
(available at electronics or computer-supply stores), are perfect for
the job. They’re efficient, quiet, and very inexpensive to operate.
Some Like It Hot, Some Like
It Cold: Orchid Temperature
Requirements
Orchids are frequently placed by professional orchid growers
into three different categories based on their night temperature
preferences:
 Cool: 45°F to 55°F (7.2°C to 12.8°C)
 Intermediate: 55°F to 60°F (12.8°C to 15.6°C)
 Warm: 65°F (18.3°C) or higher
The assumption is that the daytime temperature will be at least
15°F (9.5°C) warmer than these night temperatures.
These numbers are guidelines, not absolutes. Most orchids are quite
adaptable and tolerant of varying temperatures, short of freezing.
But for optimum growth, these temperature ranges are good targets.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
72
Get rid of the laggards!
You may find that a few of your orchids just don’t appreciate the home you’ve given
them. Maybe they don’t get enough light or your home is too cool. Whatever the
reason, if you’ve done your best to provide the right conditions and the orchid still
doesn’t grow well and bloom, it’s time to get tough and get rid of it! Give it to a friend
with different growing conditions. There are too many orchids out there that are
easy to grow to be wasting your time and valuable and limited growing space on a
poor performer.

Too-low temperatures
If orchids are exposed to cooler than the recommended ranges,
their growth will be slowed down and, in extreme cases, buds may
fall off before they open (known as bud blast). Also, cooler temper-
atures can reduce the plant’s disease resistance.
Too-high temperatures
If it gets too hot, orchids will show their displeasure by slowing or
stopping their growth, having their flower buds wilt before they
open, having their leaves and stems shrivel, and in extreme cases,
by dying. A short bout of higher-than-desired temperatures won’t
be that harmful as long as the humidity stays high.
One critically important factor with orchids is that they need at least
15°F higher daytime temperatures than they get in the evening. If
they don’t get this temperature difference, the orchids won’t grow
vigorously and, probably most importantly, they won’t set flower
buds. Not meeting this temperature requirement is one of the most
common reasons that homegrown orchids don’t bloom.
Giving Your Orchids
a Summer Vacation
Some orchid growers continue growing their plants indoors under
lights, on windowsills, or in their greenhouses throughout the
summer. The challenge during this time is to reduce the light inten-
sity and control the high heat, both of which can be damaging.
For these reasons, summering the orchids outdoors is an attractive
option. For the light gardener, this means a welcome relief from high
electric bills; and for the greenhouse and windowsill grower, it pro-
vides an opportunity to clean up the growing area. Also, most
orchids aren’t in bloom during the summer, so they aren’t at their
best visually and they respond very favorably to a summer vacation
outdoors.
Besides providing an opportunity to clean up your indoor growing
area, having a space outdoors allows you to apply pest controls, if
necessary, without smelling up your house. The natural tempera-
ture differential between day and night, especially in the early fall,
is very effective in setting flower buds for the upcoming late-fall
and winter blooming.
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 73

A shade house
I summer my orchids in a shade house made of preconstructed
lath (slates of crisscrossed wood), nailed or screwed to pressure-
treated upright wood supports. Figures 5-11 and 5-12 show what
my shade house looks like.
Shading (usually about 50 to 60 percent or more depending on the
location of the shade house and the types of orchids grown) is nec-
essary and is provided by lath or shading fabrics. I also installed in
this shade house a watering system made up of multiple small
sprayers or misters controlled by a timer that has a manual over-
ride. I grow the plants on stepped wire frame benches that ensure
even lighting and easy watering.
Figure 5-11: My shade house is an 8-foot (2.4-m) square simply constructed
using wood lath and 4-x-4-inch (10-x-10-cm) pressure-treated wood posts.
I cover the roof of the shade house with 6 mil (0.006-mm-thick)
heavy-duty clear plastic, which is stretched over a peaked wooden
frame. I used to leave the roof of the lath house open to receive
natural rainfall, but I found that it sometimes rained when I didn’t
want it to (at night, when it was too cool, or when it was already
wet). I find the covered roof gives me the control to water when my
plants need it.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
74

Figure 5-12: Inside the shade house, plants are arranged on stepped-wire
benches to allow easy watering and good air and water drainage.
A portable greenhouse
I’ve also summered orchids in a portable greenhouse on the deck
(see Figure 5-13). If you use such a structure, be sure to put it in a
place that receives shade during the heat of the day, or use a com-
mercial shading fabric to cut down the light intensity. Also, be
mindful of the daytime temperatures inside such a structure.
These units require good systems of ventilation; otherwise, tem-
peratures inside them can skyrocket in sunny periods.
Chapter 5: Providing the Right Growing Environment 75
Keeping things in balance: 
The yin and the yang of orchid growing
When it comes to your orchids’ growing conditions, it’s a matter of keeping every-
thing in balance. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 If the air temperature is cool, the orchids need less water and light.
 If the humidity is high, the orchids need more air circulation.
 If the light is very bright and/or the temperature is high, the humidity needs to
be high.
 When orchids are not actively growing, reduce or stop fertilizing.
 If the temperatures are high, the light and humidity need to also be high and the
orchids will require more-frequent watering.

Figure 5-13: An outdoor portable greenhouse can be an ideal place to put your
orchids in the summer.
Some orchids enjoy hanging out
Orchids that have higher light requirements, like vandas and asco-
cendas, grow wonderfully dangling from pot hangers clipped to the
pot (see Figure 5-14) and then hung from a pole or other support.
Just make sure the light intensity of this growing area matches the
needs of the orchids.
Figure 5-14: You can easily summer your orchids outdoors by using pot clamps to
hang them from a freestanding support or a suspended rod against the garage.

robably more orchids are killed by improper watering, usually
by overwatering, than by any other cultural practice. Discover-
ing how to properly water orchids is one of the more challenging
aspects of growing orchids. In this chapter, I explain some simple
but very effective methods that will turn you into a watering pro.
In addition to mastering the art of watering, the fertilizing game
can be very confusing — so many different types and formulations!
In this chapter, I show you how to wade through the maze of fertil-
izer terms to get to the important information — you’ll be able to
choose the fertilizer that will give you healthy orchids with the
best blooming.
Water Water Everywhere:
Understanding the Art
of Watering Orchids
When I give talks about orchids, one of the first questions asked by
those in the audience is, “How often should I water my orchids?” I
really wish this question had an easy answer, but it doesn’t. So
many variables are involved in watering. In the following sections, I
cover some of the factors that affect how often you should water.

The type of pot
You can grow orchids in clay or plastic pots. The potting material
dries off much more slowly in plastic pots than it does in clay pots.
With plastic, the potting material dries out from the top down, so
even though the potting material may be dry on top, it may be
damp 1 inch below the surface. With clay pots, the potting material
dries out more uniformly (clay pots are porous, so they “breathe”
and allow water to evaporate through the walls of the pot).
The bottom line: If you’re using a plastic pot, you’ll want to water
less often than if you’re using a clay pot.
Either type of pot will grow orchids, they merely have different
watering requirements. For orchids that do best when they’re
always slightly damp (like miltonias, slippers, and moth orchids),
I prefer to use plastic pots. For those that need to dry out more
between waterings (like cattleyas and most of the dendrobiums),
I recommend clay pots.
In Part III, I provide an overview of numerous orchids to choose
from that are available throughout the United States.
The type of potting material
Potting materials vary dramatically in terms of the amount of
water they retain. For instance, sphagnum moss, a highly water-
absorbent plant that is harvested from bogs to be used as a pot-
ting material, usually stays wet much longer than bark, which isn’t
as water-retentive.
If you’re using a potting material that absorbs a lot of water, you’ll
want to water less often than if you use a potting material that
doesn’t absorb the water. To determine whether the potting mate-
rial is absorbent, soak some of it in water for a few hours. Then
remove the material and squeeze it. If it’s absorbent, it will release
this water, under pressure, like a sponge.
The age of the potting material
Fresh potting material requires much more frequent watering for
the first few weeks, until it gets properly wetted. As it gets older, it
retains water longer.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
78

Whether the orchid is pot-bound
An overgrown orchid (sometimes referred to as an orchid that is
pot-bound) will dry off much more quickly than one that has plenty
of space in the pot. When pot space is limited, there is less potting
material to hold onto the water, so the overgrown plant quickly
uses it up.
In general, most orchids need to be repotted every one to two years.
In Chapter 7, I give you the complete scoop on repotting orchids.
The growing environment
Are you growing your orchids in high humidity or low? Orchids
and potting materials in low humidity dry off more quickly,
because the drier air quickly absorbs the moisture from both the
plant and the potting material.
The temperature
Warmer temperatures increase water evaporation because warmer
air absorbs more moisture and because the plants are growing
more quickly in warmer temperatures and require more water. If
you’re growing orchids in a cooler temperature, you won’t need to
water as often.
The amount of ventilation
The more ventilation your orchids get — especially if air is vented
to the outside, or if the air is hot and dry, as is found in most cen-
trally heated homes — the quicker the water in the potting mate-
rial evaporates. Gentle air movement is ideal. It will keep the air
fresh without excessively drying out the plants or potting material.
Whether the orchids are growing
or dormant
When species of certain orchids (like some of the dendrobiums
and catasetums) are going through their winter rest period, they
need and should only be given very little water. But when they
start active growth in the spring and summer, they require copious
amounts of water.
Chapter 6: Watering and Fertilizing Orchids 79

In Part III, I give you information about rest requirements for spe-
cific orchids.
The type of orchid
Some orchids, like cattleyas, like to dry out between waterings;
others, like paphiopedilums, phalaenopsis, and miltonias, prefer to
always be damp. This difference has a lot to do with where the par-
ticular type of orchid grows naturally. If the orchid naturally grows
in an area where it doesn’t get natural rainfall on a regular basis, it
won’t need watering as often as orchids that grow in areas of fre-
quent rainfall.
See Part III for specific watering needs for each type of orchid.
Proven Watering Techniques
When you’ve considered the factors such as potting material, envi-
ronment, and type of orchid (see the preceding section), you need
to make the decision as to when and how much to water.
I find the pot-weighting method of determining when to water is
one of the easiest. In this method, you’re relying on feel instead of
precise weights. Here’s what you do:
1. Thoroughly water the orchid in its pot.
2. “Weigh” the pot by picking it up.
Now you know how heavy it is when it’s saturated with
water.
3. Wait a day or so and “weigh” it again by picking it up.
You’ll feel the difference in the weight as the potting mate-
rial becomes drier.
4. Repeat Step 3 each day until you judge, by looking at the
surface and sticking your finger into the top 1 inch (2.5
cm) or so of the potting material to see if it’s damp, that
it’s time to water.
Keep in mind whether this type of orchid prefers to be on
the damp or dry side.
5. Note what this dry “weight” is.
Now the orchid is ready to be watered thoroughly.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
80

This entire process may sound tedious, but you’ll be amazed at
how quickly you catch on. And when you do, you’ll always know
the right time to water. Just lift the pot, note its weight, and you’ll
have your answer.
If you’re still not quite sure about watering, keep the following
watering tips in mind:
 Grow orchids of the same type, media, pot type, and size in
the same area. This strategy will make watering them easier,
because they’ll have very similar moisture requirements.
 Water with warm water. Very cold water can cause root and
bud shock, which sets back the plant and slows down its
growth.
 Always use a water breaker (a water diffuser that you
attach to the front of your hose to soften the flow of water).
For only a few orchids, a sprinkling can with a long spout with
a rose (a water diffuser placed on the end of the water-can
spout) that has many small holes works well. These devices
allow thorough watering without washing out the potting
material.
A huge selection of watering wands is available. I really like
the ones with multiple settings on the head that allow you to
drench or mist without changing attachments. Regulating the
flow of water is much easier with wands equipped with finger
triggers than it is with those that have an on-and-off valve.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on tools and supplies.)
 Never let the water breaker or end of the hose touch the
ground or floor. This commandment was given to me by my
first horticulture professor, Dr. D. C. Kiplinger, who preached
that floors and soil are where the diseases and insects hang out,
and a hose can be an all-too-effective way of spreading them.
 When you water, water thoroughly. The water should pour
out from the bottom of the pot. This method of watering
ensures that the potting material is saturated and flushes out
any excessive fertilizer salts.
 Never let the pots of orchids sit in water for over a few
hours. If the orchid pots have saucers, make sure to keep
them free of water. Excess standing water will prematurely rot
the media and roots and will be a source of accumulating fer-
tilizer salts and pathogens (disease-causing organisms, like
bacteria, fungi, or viruses).
 Water the orchids early in the day or afternoon. That way,
the foliage will have plenty of time to dry off before nightfall.
Wet foliage in the evening is an invitation for disease.
Chapter 6: Watering and Fertilizing Orchids 81

Over- or Underwatering:
Roots Tell the Story
Over- and underwatering show many of the same symptoms
because the effect of both practices is the same — damaged or
destroyed root systems, which result in the orchid becoming dehy-
drated. The signs of dehydration include
 Pleated leaves on orchids like miltonias (see Figure 6-1)
 Excessively shriveled pseudobulbs (thickened, swollen stems)
of some orchids, like cattleyas
 Droopy, soft, and puckered leaves on cattleyas
 Yellow and wilted bottom leaves on phalaenopsis
 Bud blast (in which the buds fall off instead of opening) on all
orchids
Figure 6-1: The pleated or puckered 
leaf of this miltonia orchid is a sign 
that the orchid is dehydrated.
Figuring out whether watering
is the problem
In order to better evaluate whether over- or underwatering has
caused these symptoms, remove the orchid from its pot. Many
beginner growers are reluctant to do this, but if you’re careful,
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
82

removing the orchid from its pot won’t disturb most orchids to any
degree and it’s an absolutely necessary procedure to see what’s
going on with the root system.
To determine if you’ve under- or overwatered your orchid, follow
these steps:
1. Turn the orchid plant, in its pot, upside-down.
2. Gently rap a hard object (like the handle of a gardening
tool) against the pot to loosen the potting material.
Cup your hand over the surface of the pot to hold the loos-
ened potting material as it falls out. Doing this over a work-
bench or a table covered with clean newspaper to hold the
potting material is a nice, neat approach.
3. If the potting material doesn’t loosen easily, use a thin
knife to circle the inside of the pot to loosen the potting
material from the wall of the pot.
In some situations, the potting material may be so packed
into the pot that it won’t come out easily.
4. When the orchid is removed from the pot, check out the
potting material.
Is it soggy? Does it have a bad (rotting) smell? Are the roots
dark and mushy? These are all signs of overwatering.
If the roots are dry and shriveled, not stiff and plump, and
have no or few growing root tips, the orchid probably
hasn’t gotten enough water. The potting material may be
too coarse, making poor contact with the roots; otherwise,
you simply haven’t watered the orchid frequently enough.
5. If the roots look okay or only slightly damaged, pot up
the orchid again in fresh potting material.
See Chapter 7 for more details on potting orchids.
6. If you find that the roots are badly damaged, read the fol-
lowing section for more information.
Mission: Orchid rescue 
and resuscitation
The approach you take to remedy root damage depends on how
dire the situation is.
Chapter 6: Watering and Fertilizing Orchids 83

If the orchid still has some healthy, firm roots, cut off all the soft,
mushy roots with a sterile tool, like a single-edged razor, and repot
the orchid in new potting material. Go light on the watering for a
few weeks to encourage new root development. Using a spray
bottle, mist the orchids a few times a day to prevent the leaves
from drying out.
If the roots are almost all gone, emergency measures are called for
and recovery is not definite. This is what I recommend:
1. Cut off all the dead or damaged roots.
2. Drench the roots with a liquid rooting hormone like Dip
’n Grow.
3. Let this liquid hormone dry on the roots for about an
hour, then repot the orchid in fresh potting material that
has been predampened.
4. Don’t water for a day.
5. Water once, and then put the potted orchid in an enclosed
terrarium (like a high-top propagator, a clear plastic box
with vents at the top and a tray below to hold potting
material) or an empty aquarium, with damp sphagnum
moss or pebbles on the bottom to add humidity.
6. Close the top of the terrarium and put it in a location
with diffused light.
In a greenhouse, this would be a shady spot with no direct
sunlight. Under florescent lights, put the terrarium at the
ends of the tubes where there is less illumination. If the ter-
rarium is in the cool part of the greenhouse or growing
area, put the entire terrarium on water-resistant soil or
seedling heating mats, available at most garden centers.
Get one that has a built-in thermostat set for about 70°F
(21°C) to provide bottom heat to stimulate rooting.
7. If you’re concerned about disease, spray the orchid
leaves with a disinfectant solution.
A good disinfectant is Physan, a commonly used hospital
disinfectant available from mail-order orchid-supply com-
panies or at garden centers.
In this environment of 100 percent humidity, the leaves won’t dehy-
drate, so there will be no stress on the orchid while it reroots itself.
Water the potting material only when it gets dry, keep the gravel or
moss in the bottom of the terrarium damp, and leave the orchid
enclosed until new root growth is very apparent. This may take a
few months.

This method has no guarantees, but following this procedure has
saved orchids for me that were in the “hopeless” category.
Figure 6-2 shows my orchid rescue, the place where I put orchids
that have suffered a loss of roots. It’s like a miniature greenhouse
with high humidity, which encourages the orchids to form new
roots.

Fertilizers: Not Magic Potions
Many people place much too much faith in fertilizers. They think
fertilizer is some type of elixir that will save the day. Actually, if the
orchid is in poor health, fertilizers are rarely the answer.
In fact, if the roots are damaged (a frequent problem), applying fer-
tilizers will make the problem worse. If roots aren’t functioning
well, they can’t absorb the fertilizer, and if the fertilizer isn’t used
by the orchid, it can accumulate in the orchid potting material.
This buildup of fertilizer salts can further dehydrate and damage
the remaining roots.
Fertilizers are most useful as a boost to help an already healthy
orchid grow better.
Many people mistakenly think of fertilizer as food — which it isn’t.
Plants produce their own food from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and
water. That’s the miracle called photosynthesis. By fertilizing, you’re
Chapter 6: Watering and Fertilizing Orchids 85

merely providing minerals that your orchids can use to make pho-
tosynthesis more efficient.
The number and types of fertilizers on the market can make your
head spin! You’ll hear a lot of mumbo-jumbo about why one fertil-
izer is better than another. Fortunately, the choice is not nearly as
complicated as some manufacturers seem to make it.
What to look for in orchid fertilizers
From my experience and after listening to other veteran orchid
growers, I’ve come to some conclusions about fertilizers. The fol-
lowing suggestions apply to most orchid-growing situations:
 Look at the label and choose a fertilizer that has the words
nitrate nitrogen or ammoniacal nitrogen, not urea.
Although all forms can be used by plants, recent research
shows that the nitrate and ammoniacal forms, not urea, are
most beneficial to orchids. These chemical terms may sound
like Greek to you, but it’s not really important for you to know
any more than to look for these types of nitrogen in your fer-
tilizer. It will be spelled out on the label.
 Look for a fertilizer with 20 percent or less nitrogen (this is
listed on the label). High amounts of nitrogen, much more
than 20 percent, are not necessary to grow the best orchids
no matter what media they are grown in. Too much of any
nutrient cannot be used by the orchid plant and, as a result,
merely ends up as a pollutant.
 Don’t worry about the amount of phosphorus in the fertil-
izer. It was earlier thought that a high-phosphorus fertilizer
was necessary for better orchid bloom. This has now been
found not to be the case.
 In most cases, a fertilizer with supplementary calcium (up to
15 percent) and magnesium (up to 8 percent) is a real plus.
 For most water sources, adding trace elements (chemicals
in very small amounts), including sodium, manganese,
copper, zinc, boron, iron, and molybdenum, has been found
to be beneficial to orchid growth. Don’t worry about the
exact amounts; just check the fertilizer container or label to
see if they appear in small amounts.
Any fertilizer that meets these requirements will do. To find out if
your chosen fertilizer does, carefully look at the fertilizer con-
tainer. By law, the manufacturer is required to list what chemicals
are included in the fertilizer. Figure 6-3 is an example of a label so
you can see what to look for.

Interpreting the Orchid Fertilizer Label
Fertilizer designed for a water source containing few nutrients.
First number (12) is nitrogen (12 lbs. per 100 lbs. of fertilizer); Second number (6) is
 Phosphorous (6 lbs.); Third number is Potassium. These are referred to as the
 "primary" or "macro" nutrients.
Trace elements or micro elements. Nutrients that are important but in very small amounts.
The chemical form of the nitrogen component. It is most desirable that this be mostly in the
 nitrate form, not urea.

Unless you know that  your water has an adequate supply of magnesium and calcium, look
 for a fertilizer that contains them. Both these nutrients have been found to be very
 important for strong orchid growth.

Chapter 6: Watering and Fertilizing Orchids 87

Do not use water that has passed through water-softening units on
your orchids. Such water may contain high amounts of sodium that
can be harmful to orchids.
Types of fertilizers and 
how to use them
Fertilizers come in many forms — granule (which looks like small
pieces of gravel), slow-release, and water soluble being the most
commonly available. Table 6-1 lists the pros and cons of each of
these types.
Most granule fertilizers are best suited for agricultural or lawn
application. Slow-release fertilizers are chemicals that have been
encapsulated in a shell that slowly releases nutrients. Although
some orchid growers use this type, I’ve found, especially with
some of the very porous potting materials that are frequently used
with orchids, that the fertilizer can wash out and not be effective.
Also, some orchid roots are very sensitive to fertilizer salts, so
these fertilizer capsules can damage or “burn” their roots.
This leaves the most common form of fertilizer used with orchids —
the water-soluble type. Water-soluble fertilizers are packaged as a
concentrated liquid or in dry forms.
Here are some of the advantages of these types of fertilizers:
 They’re readily available in a wide range of formulations.
 Because they’re soluble in water, they’re easily and quickly
absorbed by roots and even leaves of orchids.
 They’re very simple to use. You just dissolve them in water
and apply them with a sprayer or sprinkling can. If the orchids
are mounted on slabs or in baskets, you can dunk them in the
fertilizer solution.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
88
Fertilizer burn
When too much fertilizer has been applied, if it has been applied when the media is dry,
or if the roots of the particular orchid are hypersensitive to the salts in fertilizer, the roots
can become dehydrated by these moisture-robbing salts, resulting in fertilizer burn.
This damage shows up as brown or black root tips and/or leaf tips. It looks as though
the root tips or leaves have been burned (thus, the name). To prevent it, don’t apply
more fertilizer than is recommended and fertilize only when the potting material is damp.

The disadvantages of water-soluble fertilizers include the following:
 The nutrients don’t last long in the potting material, so the
fertilizer needs to be applied once every two to three weeks
(or constantly if you’re using a very low dosage).
 These fertilizers, in their original containers, are very con-
centrated and can damage the orchids if you don’t dilute
them correctly.
The application rate or dosage of all fertilizers depends on the con-
centrations that are used. The safest procedure is to always check
the fertilizer container for their recommended application rates.
Never apply more than recommended or plant damage can result.

Here are some pointers to help you know when it’s time to fertilize
your orchid:
 Fertilizing frequently at a more dilute rate is better than
fertilizing less often at a higher concentration. Some orchid
growers, including me, find that feeding their orchids every
time they water with a diluted amount of fertilizer works
great. It’s the most natural way (as opposed to the feast-or-
famine routine of fertilizing at a higher concentration every
two or three weeks).
 Never apply more fertilizer than is recommended by the
manufacturer. When in doubt apply less, not more, fertilizer.
Remember that fertilizers are a form of salt and salts were
some of the earliest weed killers, so they’ll damage orchids at
high concentrations.
 Drench the potting material, several times in a row, every
few weeks or so with fresh water that contains no nutrients
to wash out any excess fertilizer salts. This process is called
leaching.
 Look at the orchid’s leaves and flowers. Very dark green
leaves that are succulent and floppy can be a sign of overfer-
tilizing. If orchids are overfertilized, they also produce poor-
quality flowers.
 When the orchids are actively growing, fertilize them. When
they aren’t, don’t.
 If the orchids are diseased and in poor condition, stop
fertilizing.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
90
Fertilizer deposits on pots
As water evaporates from the potting material in the pots, it leaves behind any solid
minerals or salts that were dissolved in the water, including fertilizer salts. These
salts can accumulate on the edges of the pots. When this salt crusting is noticed,
remove it with a damp cloth. If you don’t, these deposits can burn the leaves of the
orchids when they touch it.
Because clay pots are porous, they tend to accumulate more salt deposits on the
edges than plastic pots do. One way to prevent this is to dip the tops of the clay pots
into about 1⁄2 inch of melted paraffin (wax used to make candles) before potting your
orchids in them.

f you’re just starting out with orchids, the process of choosing
containers and potting materials and then repotting orchids can
be daunting. Orchids do have special requirements, unlike most
other houseplants. But have no fear — in this chapter, I walk you
through all the steps so you have the information you need. When
you repot a few orchids, you’ll realize that this is a very fun and
rewarding part of orchid growing.
Choosing Potting Materials
Just as you wouldn’t be happy in any old place with four walls and
a roof, your orchids won’t be happy in any kind of potting material.
In this section, I give you the inside scoop on what goes into pot-
ting material and which material is best for your orchid. I also give
you some not-so-top-secret recipes for potting material so you can
make your own — and I let you know what to do if you’d rather not.

Knowing your potting 
material options
When I used the words potting material in the heading for this section,
it wasn’t just a fancy way of saying dirt. It’s because most orchids
have roots that need more air space than soil can provide. Orchids
also need potting material that drains rapidly and at the same time
retains moisture. Because orchids usually go at least a year, and
many times longer, between repotting, they also need materials
that are slow to decompose. (So if you were thinking of just throw-
ing a little dirt in a pot and calling it a day, you’ll want to think again.)
No single potting material works best for every orchid or orchid
grower. In Table 7-1, I list of some of the most common potting
materials used, along with some of their pros and cons.

Figuring out which potting 
materials are best
If you read the preceding section and you’re thinking, “How the
heck am I supposed to choose a potting material when none of
them are perfect?” don’t worry. The individual potting materials
are rarely used by themselves — they’re usually formulated into
mixtures, so the final product will retain water, drain well, and last
a reasonable amount of time. Every orchid grower has his own
Chapter 7: The ABCs of Potting Materials, Containers, and Repotting 93

favorite potting formulations — kind of like every grandmother has
her favorite apple-pie recipe.
The combination of potting materials that will work best for your
orchid depends on various factors. Answer the following questions
to get an idea of what you need:
 How often do you water? If you tend to be heavy-handed with
the sprinkling can or hose, use materials that drain well and
decompose slowly.
 What type of an orchid are you growing? Some orchids that
naturally grow on or in the ground, called terrestrials, usually
prefer to be kept slightly damp all the time, while those that
live in trees, called epiphytes, or grow on rocks, called litho-
phytes, want to dry off thoroughly between waterings. When
you look at catalog listings or search for information on the
Web about your particular orchid, look for these terms to see
what growing conditions suit them best, or ask the grower
you’re buying from.
 How mature are the plants? Large plants usually do best in
coarser potting materials and smaller plants do better in finer
potting materials. (See the following sections for potting mixes
of varying degrees of coarseness.)
 How big are the roots of the plants? In general, smaller roots
grow better in finer, more water-retentive materials, while
larger roots perform best in coarser materials.
Psst! Getting your hands on 
some not-so-secret recipes
Although some orchid specialists have complicated formulations
for each type of orchid they grow, I’ve simplified this process to
two basic mixes that suit most orchids. The mixes are based on the
texture or particle size of the mix, which is connected to the size of
the orchid roots and their need for water retention. (If this sounds
complicated, just read on — I let you know which mix works best
for which orchids.)
Recommending specific potting mixes or formulations is a risky
thing to do because there are so many opinions as to what works
best. In truth, many different mixes will work. The most important
thing is to match your watering habits to the potting material you
use. If you are a heavy and frequent waterer (as most people are),
use a more porous, well draining mix (like the ones I recommend in
the following sections). If you tend to water less frequently, use
potting mixes that contain higher percentages of some of the more
water-retentive materials listed in Table 7-1.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
94

These formulations work well for me, but you may find some other
mix works better for your situation.
Keep your watering habits in mind. If your orchids tend to dry out
too often, use plastic pots rather than clay and use the fine mix. If
you tend to be a heavy waterer, use clay pots with the coarse mix.
Fine mix
4 parts fine-grade fir bark or fine-grade coco husk chips or
redwood bark
1 part fine charcoal
1 part horticultural-grade perlite or small-grade Aliflor
This mix works well for smaller plants of all types of orchids, slip-
per orchids, most oncidiums, miltonias, and any other orchids
with small roots that like to stay on the damp side.
Medium mix
4 parts medium-grade fir bark or medium-grade coco husk
chunks
1 part medium charcoal
1 part horticultural-grade perlite or medium-grade Aliflor
This is your middle-of-the-road mix. If you aren’t sure which mix to
use, try this one. This mix is also good for cattleyas, phalaenopsis,
and most mature orchids.
If mixing your own is not your thing
If you’d rather just buy your mix ready-made, potting mixes are
readily available from most places that sell orchids, including
home-improvement stores. The mixes that they sell are very simi-
lar to the ones I outline in the preceding section. Most contain fir
bark, perlite, charcoal, and sometimes some peat moss and are
suitable for most orchids.
Getting your potting material 
ready to use
Whatever potting material or mix you choose — whether you mix
it yourself or buy it ready-made — it must be wetted before you
use it. Otherwise, it will never hold moisture properly and will
always dry out. Here’s how you do it:
Chapter 7: The ABCs of Potting Materials, Containers, and Repotting 95

1. Pour the amount of potting material you intend to use
into a bucket that has about twice the volume of the mix.
2. Fill the bucket with hot water.
Hot water penetrates the material better than cold water.
3. Let it soak overnight.
4. The next day, pour out the mix into a colander or strainer.
5. Rinse the mix thoroughly to wash out the dust that was in
the mix.
Now the mix is ready to use.
Giving Your Orchids a Home:
Potting Containers
Many different containers are on the market — some are more orna-
mental, while others have functional differences (see Figure 7-1).
The most common container is the basic pot — plastic or clay.
The big differences between standard garden pots and those used for
orchids are the number and size of drainage holes in the container.
Orchid pots have larger holes and more of them, both in the bottom
and sides of the pot, to ensure better drainage. Some are shallow and
shorter than standard garden pots, with a larger base — especially
useful for top-heavy orchids.
Figure 7-1: You can find many different types of containers for growing orchids.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
96

You can also plant orchids in wooden baskets, usually constructed
of teak or some other rot-resistant wood (see Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2: When potting in a basket, line the basket with sheet moss, 
then add standard potting mix.
Repotting Orchids without Fear
Most beginning orchid growers are afraid to repot their orchids.
Despite their reputation, orchids are tough. After all, they were
first brought over from the tropics to Europe in the holds of ships
and, miraculously, many of them made it alive!
In this section, I give you all the information you need to repot
your orchids with confidence.
Chapter 7: The ABCs of Potting Materials, Containers, and Repotting 97
Mounting orchids
Many orchids that are found naturally growing in trees can be mounted, instead of
placed in pots. Mounting gives them perfect drainage, simulates their natural habi-
tat, and can be an easy way to maintain them.
To mount your orchid, follow these steps (and refer to the nearby figure):
1. Place the plant on a small handful of moistened, squeeze-dried sphagnum moss.
2. Spread the roots around the sphagnum moss.
3. Place the orchid on the mount so its center points down.
Don’t position the orchid with the growing point up. If you do, it will collect water
in the center of the plant, which can lead to disease that causes the center and
growing point of the plant to rot (and can lead to death).
(continued)

Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
98
4. After the orchid is centered properly, wrap either stainless-steel wire or clear
fishing line (monofilament) around the top and bottom of the moss to hold it in
place.
In several months, after the new roots have taken hold, you can remove the
wire or line.
5. The finished mounted orchid is ready to hang in a bright place in a home green-
house or near a window.
Because these mounts drain so rapidly, they need to be watered frequently, some-
times more than once a day during the hot summer months.

Knowing when you should repot
Your orchid will tell you when it’s the right time to repot. No, the
plant won’t speak to you (if it does, be afraid — be very, very afraid).
Here are the situations in which you’ll want to repot your orchid:
 When the orchid roots are overflowing the pot
 When the plant itself is going over the edge of the pot
 When the potting material is getting soggy and drains poorly
The ideal time to repot most orchids is when the plant starts new
growth, usually right after it flowers. With certain orchids like the
cattleyas, you’ll see a swelling at the base of the plant, which is the
beginning of the new lead or shoot that will form the next stem,
leaf, and flowers (see Figure 7-3). This is when orchids are putting
out new roots.
Figure 7-3: Cattleyas should be repotted after flowering when the 
new roots are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, the new lead growth is just 
appearing, and the growth of the plant has reached the edge of the pot.
New growth
New roots
Chapter 7: The ABCs of Potting Materials, Containers, and Repotting 99

If you don’t repot your orchid at this new-growth stage, the new
roots and growths are easily exposed to breakage and the new roots
won’t have any potting material to grow into and, therefore, will be
more likely to dry out. If the orchid plant becomes too overgrown,
you’ll have trouble transplanting it later without damaging it.
Orchid potting — step by step
Now that you know this is the right time to repot your orchid, here
are the simple steps to follow (see Figure 7-4):
1. Remove the orchid from the pot.
You may need to use a knife to circle the inside of the pot
and loosen the roots.
2. Remove the old, loose, rotted potting material and any
soft, damaged, or dead roots.
3. If the roots are healthy, firm, and filling the pot, put the
orchid in a pot just one size larger than the one you
removed it from, placing the older growth toward the
back so the new lead or growth has plenty of room.
If the roots are rotted and in poor condition, repot the
plant in a container of the same or one size smaller than
it was removed from.
If you place a poorly rooted plant in too large of a container,
the growing material will stay too damp, which will result
in more of the roots rotting.
Some orchid growers like to add a coarse material like
broken clay pots or Styrofoam in the bottom of the pots to
improve drainage. You don’t have to do this if you’re using
shallow, azalea-type pots.
4. Place the plant in the pot so it’s at the same depth as it
was originally.
The new shoot should be level with the pot rim.
5. Press the fresh potting material into the pot and around
the orchid roots with your thumbs and forefingers.
The orchid should be secure in the pot so it doesn’t
wiggle — otherwise, the new roots won’t form properly.
6. Place a wooden or bamboo stake in the center of the
pot, and tie up the new and old leads with soft string or
twist ties.

Figure 7-4: Potting your orchid.
Monopodial orchids are those with one growing point that always
grows vertically, not sideways (such as phalaenopsis, angraecums,
and vandas), as shown in Figure 7-5. The potting process for these
orchids is very similar to the cattleya process (outlined in the pre-
ceding steps), except that the orchid should be placed in the center
of the container, rather that toward the back.

ecause orchids are slower growing than most other plants,
the process of multiplying them takes more time. To rear an
orchid from seed to bloom can take as long as five to seven years!
The other methods I show you in this chapter are much quicker, but
they’re still not as speedy as reproducing common garden plants.
Multiplying your orchids is worth the effort, however, because
orchids are valuable plants that will keep growing forever.
Dividing Your Orchids
Dividing orchids is the surest and swiftest way to increase your
orchids. This method only works with sympodial-type orchids
(ones that grow sideways across the top of the pot like cattleya,
shown in Figure 8-1). Just about all the orchids in this book —
except for those in Chapter 10 — are sympodials.

For the cattleya types, you want to have divisions of at least three
or four growths (called pseudobulbs). For other types, you can
divide them with fewer growths, but for best results, the larger
the divisions the better.
You may want to divide your orchid because
 The plant has grown too big to handle.
 You want to share or trade a piece of the orchid you have
with another plant lover.
 The rhizomes (creeping stems of the orchid) are growing
over each other in a tangled mess.
When cutting the orchid plant, use a very sharp knife or pruners
that have been sterilized to prevent disease spread. After you’ve
divided the plant, turn to Chapter 7 for information on potting it.
Figure 8-1: When dividing a cattleya, try to have at least three, if not four, 
front growths.

Do not divide your orchids when they’re too small or when they
don’t have enough growths. The largest divisions with the most
pseudobulbs will grow quickest to blooming plants. You’ll always
get the best blooming from your orchids when they have multiple
divisions or growths.
Dividing a large orchid with many growths can be confusing. Make
a drawing of the plant growth pattern on a sheet of paper, and
mark where you’ll make your cuts before you start doing it, as
shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2: Making a drawing showing how a large 
orchid will be divided helps simplify the process.
Giving Babies a New Home
The Hawaiian name for baby is keiki. Interestingly, the orchid
crowd adopted this name to refer to a baby plant, especially one
that sprouts on the stem of a mature orchid.
Chapter 8: Let Your Orchids Propagate: Multiplying Your Orchids 105

Some plants, like the phalaenopsis, sometimes produce babies on
the flower stem (see Figure 8-3). When this happens, leave these
young plants on the flower stem until they’ve developed several
roots a few inches long. Then you can cut the young plant from the
flower stem and pot it following the guidelines in Chapter 7.
Figure 8-3: An orchid “baby,” or keiki, being removed from the mother plant and
then potted.
When an orchid grows very tall and has extending roots from its
stem, you can create more plants by cutting out the top several
inches of the orchid stem that contains the roots and potting it
(this is known as topping an orchid). The bottom half of the plant
will then usually form baby plants that will sprout along the stem.
These babies can eventually be cut off and planted. Figure 8-4 illus-
trates the three steps of topping an orchid:
1. Remove the top portion of the stem, allowing ample roots.
2. Pot the portion you’ve just removed.
3. Leave the mother plant in its original container and wait
for the baby plants to sprout from its stem.

Producing New Plants 
from Cuttings
Some orchids have canes, or long stems, that you can cut up into
pieces called cuttings. Here’s how this works (see Figure 8-5):
1. Cut off one of the long stems or canes with sharp, clean
pruners.
2. With a sharp, sterile knife, cut sections of the cane so that
each section contains at least two nodes (the regions of
the stems where the leaves used to be attached).
Nodes are marked by circular scars around the stems.

3. Lay the cut stems or canes horizontally, half-buried, on
a bed of damp sand or sphagnum moss in a shallow 
container.
4. Cover the container with glass or plastic wrap to hold in
the moisture.
5. Place the container in a warm (70–75°F/21–24°C) area
where it will get diffused but not direct sunlight.
About 6 inches under a two-tube fluorescent fixture would
be ideal. In a few months, small plants will sprout. They can
then be potted as outlined in Chapter 7.
Figure 8-5: Producing more orchids from stem or cane cuttings.
Growing Orchids from Back Bulbs
After some types of orchids, like cymbidiums and oncidiums,
bloom, their older stems, called backbulbs, eventually lose their
leaves and become lifeless looking. If you leave them in the pot,
they probably won’t ever produce new growth. If, however, you
remove them from the main plant and handle them in a special
manner, they can produce new young plants.
Here are the steps to follow (see Figure 8-6):

1. Cut off from the mother plant the older back bulbs that
no longer have leaves.
2. Put a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of damp sphagnum moss in a
plastic bag.
3. Place several of the backbulbs with their bottoms about
one-fourth buried in sphagnum moss in the plastic bag
and seal it.
Put this bag in a warm (70–75°F/21–24°C) spot that receives
bright diffused light, not direct sunlight. In about two
months, you should start to see some new growth.
4. When the leaves are a few inches long, place the young
plants as a group in a shallow container in diffused light.
Let them grow for several months. Then transplant them
into their own pots.

Growing orchids from seeds: 
Leave it to the pros
Raising orchids from seeds is not a simple task. In fact, it’s quite complicated — and
it wasn’t until the 1920s that the professionals figured it out. The biggest problem is
that the orchid seeds are naked, which means they don’t have their own food source
like most other plants. As a result, to successfully grow them, you have to provide
them with a nutrient solution along with a special fungus that makes this food avail-
able to them.
All this is done in laboratory flasks. The seed is incredibly small — one seed can
weight as little as 35 millionths of an ounce! They’re so small that a seed pod a few
inches across can hold over 100,000 seeds.
Growing orchids from seeds is not something recommended for beginners. Leave
raising orchids from seeds to the experts.
If you’re really interested in growing orchids from seeds, you can try a compromise:
Get small plants that have already grown for a year or more in shallow containers
outside of a lab environment (see the figure). This is a fun and inexpensive way to
have some extra orchids to trade or give to friends. If you’re new to this, start with
fast-growing types like phalaenopsis. If you’re lucky, you’ll see blooms in a few years.

A
lthough orchids are relatively pest-free plants, if you have
them long enough, you’ll eventually have to deal with an 
invasion of some bug or disease. Fortunately, there aren’t many
pests to contend with and they aren’t that difficult to identify. In
this chapter, I stress the safest and most effective ways to control
these problems.
Always start with the least toxic solution. If you are careful and
inspect your orchids on a regular basis and detect the problems
before they progress too far, you will rarely have to resort to more
poisonous materials. The more poisonous materials should be
your last line of defense.

Preventing Problems 
Before They Start
Most insect and disease problems can be prevented by good plant
sanitation. Here are some steps to take to prevent pest problems
from getting out of hand:
 Always sterilize your cutting tools. See the nearby sidebar,
“How to sterilize your tools,” for more information.
 Make a practice of regularly inspecting the tips of new
growth and the undersides of the leaves. This is where most
bugs hang out.
 Provide the best growing conditions possible. When orchids
are under stress, they’re more susceptible to disease and insect
infestations.
 When repotting, always use new or cleaned and sterilized
pots.
 Buy plants that are clean and healthy. Beware of the 
“bargain” or leftover plants; many have serious problems.
Unless they’re in excellent condition, stay away from them.
 Don’t allow weeds to infest your pots of orchids. They can
harbor insects.
 Keep the floor or ground in your growing area free of
weeds, dead leaves, and dead flowers.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
112
How to sterilize your tools
These are the two methods that I use for sterilization:
 Chemical sterilization: Dilute household bleach — one part bleach to nine parts
water. Soak your tools in them for a few minutes before you use them. Most
chemicals that are used to sterilize tools, like bleach, are highly corrosive, so
after you’ve sterilized these tools, be sure to thoroughly rinse them with clean
water or their metal will quickly rust.
 Heat sterilization: This is a very fast and clean way to sterilize tools. You can
use a compact propane torch for this, but I’ve found the most convenient way
is to use a small butane hand torch (see Chapter 3) like the ones sold to make
the crust of crème brûlée. With these torches, you merely flame the tool on the
cutting edges until they get red. Let the tool cool, and it’s ready to use.

Always isolate new orchids from your other plants for four to six
weeks. During this time, scrutinize them for any signs of insects.
Besting the Bugs
The most important aspect of pest control is vigilance. Frequently,
people say, “I don’t know where these bugs came from! All of a
sudden my orchid was infested with them!” Well, I’m here to tell
you that this isn’t the way it happens. Even though most insects do
reproduce faster than rabbits, infestations don’t happen overnight.
Things can get out of hand quickly, though, if you don’t make a
point of closely inspecting your orchids regularly. Keep on the
lookout, because if you can detect the pests when they’re in small
numbers, getting rid of them will be much easier.
Many of the pests described in this chapter, like mites and thrips, are
very tiny, so they’re difficult to see with the naked eye. Buy yourself
a 10x hand lens at a camera shop. It’ll make the task much easier.
Identifying common orchid pests
When you first notice pests, you need to promptly and properly
identify them so you can be sure to apply the most effective con-
trol. In the following sections, I describe the common orchid pests.
Later in the chapter, I tell you what to do if your orchid has them.
In many cases, especially if there are many pests present, you’ll have
to apply control measures repeatedly, every seven to ten days, at
least three times. This is because these creatures have laid eggs that
are resistant to the control measure and hatch later. By repeating
the control several times, you’ll kill these next generations of pests
after they emerge from their eggs.
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Orchids Pest- and Disease-Free 113
Orchid euthanasia
Sometimes the best solution is to dispose of a sickly orchid. If you’ve tried the preven-
tative and curative measures outlined in this chapter and still the orchid doesn’t
seem to be recovering, getting rid of it is the best solution. When a plant becomes
too weakened by infection or a bad infestation of insects, it isn’t likely to recover —
and while you’re hoping this will happen, the infested plant can spread its problem
to your other healthy orchids. So bite the bullet and bury it in your trash can!

Aphids
These are probably the most ubiquitous insect pests of them all.
They come in all colors — including green, red, pink, black, and
yellow — and they’re usually found on the new, succulent growth
including the flower buds (see Figure 9-1). They feed with syringe-
like mouth parts and are particularly damaging to buds by causing
them to be deformed when they open. Aphids are also very effective
carriers of disease, especially viruses.
Figure 9-1: Aphids are usually found in clusters on flower 
buds and young shoots and leaves.
If you see clear sticky droplets anywhere on you plant, look out for
aphids. This material, euphemistically called honey dew, is actually
aphid waste. This sticky substance can also be excreted by any
other piercing/sucking insect, such as scale.
Mealybugs
The name of this creature pretty much describes what this insect
looks like — mealy or cottony masses (see Figure 9-2). It’s found in
similar areas as aphids — the growing tips, buds, and flower stems.
One type is also found on the roots. This is a bothersome pest that
usually needs multiple insecticide treatments to get rid of it.
Thrips
Thrips can be very destructive, especially to flower buds, maturing
flowers, and young leaves. They are miniscule buggers that look
something like long gnats and are very difficult to see with the
naked eye. Their damage is easier to detect — it shows up as light
streaks on the flowers or stippling on the leaves. The flower buds
are also usually deformed.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
114

Figure 9-2: Mealybugs look like white cottony masses.
Scale
This is another creature that comes in various forms, but most have
a shell that serves as a type of armor for the soft insect body that
is protected by it (see Figure 9-3). This shell must be penetrated by
a chemical or by rubbing it off before you can kill the insect. They’re
frequently found on the undersides of the leaves near the middle
vein of the leaf or on the edges of the leaf. They also commonly hang
out on the flower stems. This is a very difficult insect to totally
eradicate, but with persistence, it can effectively be controlled.
Figure 9-3: Scale is a very common pest on orchids.

Spider mites
These are not insects but are spiders (see Figure 9-4). They’re
often found when growing conditions are hot and dry. They can be
green or red, but in any color they’re very difficult to see because
they’re so small. In extreme infestations, you’ll see fine webbing on
the leaves. Before the infestation gets this bad, the foliage will take
on a stippling effect, which is a result of their feeding.
Figure 9-4: Spider mites are very small, hard-
to-see pests that can be very destructive.
Slugs and snails
Snails and slugs (see Figure 9-5) head most people’s list as being
one of the most revolting of all orchid pests. They can do extensive
damage to young orchid roots and stems and developing and matur-
ing flowers. They usually come out at night, so if you suspect them,
take a flashlight in the evening to search for these culprits. Also,
look on the bottom of the flower pots — this is another favorite
hiding place. They love cool, damp spots. If they travel across dry
surfaces, they’ll leave a telltale slime trail.
Roaches
Another very unpopular beast, cockroaches also feed at night and
enjoy munching on flowers and flower buds.
Mice
More than once, to my great consternation, upon inspecting my
plants in the morning, I discovered that a creature had nibbled off
the flower buds of some of my prized beauties right before they
opened! Oh, how frustrating! Luckily, mice can be easy controlled.

Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
116

Figure 9-5: Snails and slugs eat holes in flowers and leaves at night.
Bees and other pollinating insects
These are not really harmful creatures — they don’t cause any phys-
ical damage to orchids, but if they land on the flowers and pollinate
them, the flowers will very soon collapse. So if you want your flowers
to last the longest, keep pollinating insects out of your growing area.
Finding safe pest-control measures
Many of the chemical controls for insects and diseases can damage
the plants to which they’re applied if they’re misused. To be on the
safe side, always read the pesticide label to see if orchids are listed
as a plant that this chemical should not be used with. And when
applying the pesticide, never use more than the dosage recom-
mended and apply it in the cool of the early morning. Also make
sure that the potting material is damp — a moisture-stressed orchid
is much more easily damaged by pesticides.
The pest-control methods in Table 9-1 are listed in their approximate
order of safety and are readily available. Always start off with the
first line of defense. Some of the least toxic solutions must be
applied more frequently, because they kill on contact and aren’t
residual (they don’t stick around after they’re applied). Most don’t
smell bad — an important feature for homegrown plants. Some, like
Orange Guard, also serve as pest repellents (which means they’ll
kill the pests currently there and also repel future pests).

Chapter 9: Keeping Your Orchids Pest- and Disease-Free 119

If you want more technical information on orchid pests and their
controls, I highly recommend the booklet published by the American
Orchid Society called Orchid Pest and Diseases. It can be purchased
online at the American Orchid Society’s Orchid Emporium/
Bookstore (http://user889628.wx10.registeredsite.com/
miva/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=OE&Product_
Code=SO103&Category_Code=AH).
Don’t spray aerosol insect controls, such as those designed for
killing ants, roaches, and wasps, on your orchid plants. These are
intended to be used to kill insects outdoors and in the kitchen, but
if sprayed directly on your orchid plants, they can cause serious
damage.
All horticultural oils are not the same. Do not use dormant oils.
Use the ones called superior oils. They’re much thinner and more
refined and are meant to be used when the plants are actively
growing. One common brand name is SunSpray Ultra-Fine.
Is There a Fungus Among Us?
Orchids are tough plants, and if you grow them in the correct cul-
tural conditions and take the preventative measures mentioned in
this chapter, they’ll rarely suffer from fatal diseases. Still, being
aware of what can happen when things go wrong is a good idea.
Diseases are somewhat trickier than bugs to deal with because you
really can’t see them. You just see the damage they leave behind —
such as rotten plant centers or spots on the leaves.
The damage that most fungal and bacterial diseases leave behind are
circular or oblong spots on the foliage or flowers (see Figure 9-6).
Sometimes they also cause the center growing point, called the
crown, to turn black or rot and may lead to the death of the plant.
When this happens, the crown has been killed by the organism and
the pattern of spots or rots is a symptom of the disease and is one
of the ways that a disease is identified. Fortunately, most of the
controls that I mention in this chapter are effective against a broad
range of disease problems, so an exact disease diagnosis is seldom
necessary to remedy the problem.
Viruses are dreaded by orchid growers because there is no practi-
cal cure for them. The most obvious symptom of a virus infection
is streaking or color breaks in the flower.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
120

Figure 9-6: Leaf spots like these are 
usually caused by fungal organisms.
Detecting these symptoms is nearly impossible — in my 40 years
of growing orchids, I’ve rarely been able to accurately identify a
virus on my orchids. Of course, that doesn’t mean my orchids
didn’t have some viruses that I didn’t detect, but viruses aren’t
common, especially if you buy high-quality plants and follow the
prevention methods outlined here.
Refer to the “Preventing Problems Before They Start” section, ear-
lier in this chapter. This information pertains as much to diseases
as it does to pest damage.
Here are a few other pointers that relate specifically to disease:
 Water your orchids during the day when the moisture will
evaporate from the leaves before nightfall. Cool, damp leaves
and water left in the crowns of the plants in the evening are an
invitation to disease.
 Make sure your orchids have enough airflow. This reduces
the time moisture stays on the leaves and removes stagnant air.
 Remove diseased leaves with a sharp sterile knife or scis-
sors. (See the sidebar, “When surgery is required,” later in
this chapter.)
 Sterilize your cutting tools each time you use them on
another plant.
 When you find a disease problem, treat it right away.
Procrastinating could cost your orchid its life.
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Orchids Pest- and Disease-Free 121

Here are the steps that I recommend:
1. If the plant is badly diseased, discard it.
You probably won’t be able to save it, and it could infect
your other healthy plants.
2. If you find dark brown spots that look like disease and
they are close to the end of the leaf, remove this section
of the leaf.
See the sidebar “When surgery is required.”
3. As a general sanitation practice, after you’ve performed
surgery or if your orchid has a disease spot that cannot be
removed surgically, spray the leaves with a mild fungicide/
bactericide and hope for the best.
Physan 20, Phyton 27, Natriphene, or RD-20 are all mild
fungicides/bactericides that work for this purpose.
4. Reevaluate the area you’re growing the orchid in to be
sure it’s getting enough air circulation and you’re doing all
you can to follow the recommended disease-prevention
measures.
All chemical pesticides are poisons that have some toxicity to
humans. Read the precautions on the pesticide label and follow
them carefully. Wear rubber gloves (the disposable ones work
great) when mixing and spraying these materials.
Part II: The Basics of Orchid Parenthood 
122
When surgery is required
Performing surgery to cut out the infection is the simplest and most effective method
of stopping the spread of disease. A single-edge razor blade is ideal for the job
because it’s extremely sharp and sterile and can be disposed of after the operation.
The sharpness is important so that as little as possible of the healthy tissue is dam-
aged in the process.
Remove all the damaged or diseased leaf by cutting the leaf off about 1⁄2 inch to 1
inch into healthy leaf tissue that shows no signs of the disease. Be careful not to cut
into the diseased tissue and then into healthy tissue, or you’ll spread the disease.
Some people dress the edge of the cut with a simple fungicidal material like sulfur
or cinnamon, but this usually isn’t necessary.

T
his type of orchid is the most popular grown today. In fact,
according to the American Orchid Society, moth orchids
account for 75 percent of all orchids sold!
Moth orchids (phalaenopsis) offer everything that most orchid
growers admire and are the fastest and easiest to grow. They
bloom for a long period of time — from many weeks to months.
The flowers are classy and borne on elegant arched sprays. And
moth orchids come in a broad range of colors. Their foliage is
beautiful glossy green or marbled, they have very modest light
requirements, and they grow well in temperatures commonly
found in the home.

Moth orchids are definitely the orchids to start with, and after
you experience the great satisfaction that they provide, you may
decide to stay with them. The standard pink, white, and striped
ones commonly sold in the box stores and at flower shops are the
essence of style, but in addition to these beauties, there are many
new and exciting colors, color patterns, and growth habits that
even increase their desirability. Although most phalaenopsis are
not fragrant, some are.
In this chapter, I tell you all about moth orchids and their relatives.
Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: 
The Beauty of Moth Orchids
Moth orchids are beautiful plants, and in this section, I fill you in
on exactly what to expect from yours.
Leaves
All the moth orchids have handsome foliage. Many of them have
dark-green, leathery, glossy leaves, while others exhibit exquisitely
marbled dark-green and gray-green leaves, so even when these
plants aren’t in bloom, they remain quite attractive (see Figure 10-1).

patterned leaf of Phalaenopsis stuartiana.

Flower shapes
The various types of moth orchids have very similar shapes,
though many of the newer varieties have a very rounded look.
Figure 10-2 shows you the names of the parts of the moth orchid
flowers. Because moth orchids epitomize style, they’re frequently
used in flower arrangements and in simple, yet chic, corsages.
Figure 10-2: The parts of a moth orchid (phalaenopsis) flower.
Flower colors
White, pink, and candy-striped are the “standard” moth orchids
that are most commonly found at flower shops and box stores as
both potted plants and cut flowers for wedding bouquets (see
Figure 10-3, Figure 10-4, and the color insert). These colors of moth
orchids seem to have reached the pinnacle of perfection in flower
size and shape and, because of modern reproduction and growing
methods, they’re highly affordable. In fact, in Europe and certain
large urban centers in the United States, they’re commonly pur-
chased as an expendable blooming potted plant that is discarded
after its many weeks of bloom.

I don’t recommend any specific varieties within this group because
there are so many. These types of phalaenopsis have been perfected
to such a degree that just about all of them available these days
would be ones you would be happy to give a home.
Due to the fine efforts of orchid hybridizers in the United States, Asia,
and other parts of the world, we now have moth orchids with a huge
variety of flower colors — from harlequins with random spotting

patterns backed with yellow or white petals (see Figure 10-5) to dark
purple, and rich pink with white lips (see Figure 10-6), clear yellows,
greens, and burgundy reds,. About the only color that isn’t yet found
in phalaenopsis is blue, and breeders are working diligently to add
this color to the palate.
To intensify the markings on these orchids, try growing them in a
little drier, cooler, and brighter location than usual when they’re
starting to flower.

Encore! Encore! A second show
One of the great features about moth orchids is their ability to produce a second-
ary flower spike that branches off the main one (as shown in the nearby figure). This
will make your flower show go on for months!
To make this happen, after the flowers have stopped blooming on the flower spike,
feel along this bare spike and notice the bumps along this stem. These knobby struc-
tures are called nodes. At the base of these nodes are resting flower buds. Your
mission is to wake up one of these buds so it will produce another flower spike.
Notice where the first flower opened on the stem, and go to the next node down,
toward the base of the plant. This is where you cut off the spent flower spike. After
you do this, in most cases, this will stimulate the production of a secondary flower
spike at this node.
Remember: Don’t bloom your moth orchids to death! Sometimes moth orchids don’t
know what’s good for them. They just keep blooming to the point of exhausting all
their energy. If the orchid is a robust plant, this continual bloom is okay. But if the
leaves are puckered and the plant looks worn out, or if the plant is very young and
not very established, you’re better off cutting off the flower spike and enjoying it in
a flower arrangement. This will give the plant rest and an opportunity to put its
energy into producing new roots and leaves so it will be strong enough to produce
even more flowers on its next flowering.

Scents
Few beginning orchid lovers realize that some phalaenopsis,
including the one shown in Figure 10-7, are blessed with a wonder-
ful perfume. Certain moth orchids from the wild naturally have this
characteristic and, when they’re used as parents, they sometimes
pass this quality on to their offspring. In this section, I give you
lists of some specific varieties to look for.
When you’re buying other moth orchids, check to see if any of
them have these plants listed as their parents; this will increase
their chances of being fragrant.
Figure 10-7: One of the most popular of the fragrant moth orchids is
Phalaenopsis Orchid World ‘Bonnie Vasquez’ AM/AOS.
Here are some of the sweet-smelling phalaenopsis hybrids that I
have grown and enjoyed:
 Phalaenopsis Ambo Buddha ‘SW’: This is another contribu-
tion to the moth-orchid world from Taiwanese breeders. The
colors on the 21⁄2-inch (6-cm) flowers are dazzling. (See the color
insert for a full-color photo.)
 Phalaenopsis Caribbean Sunset ‘Sweet Fragrance’: A delight-
ful miniature with 2-inch (5-cm) rose-red flowers that has a
rose fragrance. The leaves reach about 6 inches (15 cm) long.
 Phalaenopsis Dottie Woodson: Varnished, blood-red sweet-
smelling 2-inch (5-cm) flowers are produced on multiple
spikes borne above handsome, medium-glossy, green foliage.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 131

 Phalaenopsis Ember ‘Blumen Insel’ AM/AOS: 21⁄2-inch (6-cm)
glossy, waxy, solid, dark red flowers borne on thick florescence.
This flower frequently blooms more than once a year.
 Phalaenopsis Kilby Cassviola ‘Sweet Fragrance’: Gets its
spicy fragrance from one of its parents, Phalaenopsis violacea.
It’s another compact grower with glistening white flowers
about 21⁄2 inches (6 cm) across, with light-brown barring on the
lower part of the flower.
 Phalaenopsis Orchid World ‘Bonnie Vasquez’ AM/AOS:
There are many different forms of this classic variety (refer
to Figure 10-7). Most have leathery, thick, long-lasting, glossy
yellow flowers brightly marked with red or maroon spots or
stripes.
 Phalaenopsis Perfection Is ‘Chen’ FCC/AOS: One of my per-
sonal favorites because its flat, 21⁄2-inch (6-cm) waxy, yellow
flowers are brilliantly decorated with burgundy red spots and
have a clove or carnation scent.
Here are some other hybrids noted for their fragrance:
 Phalaenopsis Sweet Memory
 Phalaenopsis George Vasquez ‘Eureka’ FCC/AOS
 Phalaenopsis Luedde-violacea ‘Anna Red’ HCC/AOS
 Phalaenopsis Peach State
 Phalaenopsis Penang Girl
 Phalaenopsis Princess Kaiulani
 Phalaenopsis Rare Vintage
 Phalaenopsis Tabasco Tex
 Phalaenopsis Valentinii
 Phalaenopsis Wes Addison
 Phalaenopsis Zuma Aussie Delight ‘Zuma Canyon’ AM/AOS
Some of the phalaenopsis species (those in the form naturally found
in the wild) are fragrant and also are used in breeding to pass this
characteristic to new varieties. These species are a little bit harder
to find and grow but are worth the effort:
 Phalaenopsis amboinensis: Musky fragrance.
 Phalaenopsis bastianii: Very fragrant.
 Phalaenopsis bellina: A very fragrant scent of lily-of-the-
valley and freesia. A compact grower whose flowers are borne
sequentially (see Figure 10-8).
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
132

 Phalaenopsis fasciata: Light rosy-floral scent.
 Phalaenopsis gigantea: Huge leaves — they can be more
than 2 feet (60 cm) long! The flowers are about 2 inches
(5 cm) and smell like orange peels.
 Phalaenopsis hieroglyphica: White flowers with red patterns
that look like hieroglyphics with a fragrance similar to a rose.
 Phalaenopsis lueddemanniana: Yellow to white flowers
with dark mahogany spots that emit a light sweet fragrance.
 Phalaenopsis mannii: A Nepalese native that displays 1- to
2-inch (2.5- to 5-cm) narrow yellow flowers with dark-brown
barring with a purple and white lip. Its flowers can last up
to three months and have the light scent of oranges (see
Figure 10-9).
 Phalaenopsis odesta: A summer bloomer from Borneo that
has a creamy white flower with purple freckles smelling like
honeysuckle or lilacs.
 Phalaenopsis schilleriana: An orchid with 3- to 31⁄2-inch 
(8- to 9-cm) pink, lightly rose-scented flowers that can number
into the hundreds on a mature plant. The dark-green foliage is
handsomely marked in silver.
 Phalaenopsis tetraspis: Small, glossy white flowers with a
strong sweet scent that are lightly marked in purple.
 Phalaenopsis violacea: A compact plant that is very fragrant,
smelling like spice and cinnamon. The glossy green leaves are
another attractive feature.
Figure 10-8: Phalaenopsis bellina
has a lily-of-the-valley fragrance 
that permeates any room it’s in.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 133

Figure 10-9: Phalaenopsis mannii is quite variable in its flower color.
When it comes to moth orchid flower fragrance:
 Usually these orchids are fragrant during the day.
 On occasion, their scent will only last for a few hours
each day.
 Sometimes the flowers have to be open for a few days before
they emit a scent.
 Their perfume will be strongest on still, hot, sunny days.
Size
Some of the glorious moth orchids you see in the stores make an
impressive show with their 24- to 36-inch (60- to 90-cm) arcing flower
spikes, but these plants may not fit in the more limited growing
space you can provide. Luckily, there are diminutive moth orchids
that thrive in smaller places. In fact, there is now an entire group
referred to as multiflorals or sweetheart types that have many flow-
ers up to 2 inches (3 cm) across on very compact growing plants.
I’ve grown several of these and find them to be pure pleasure.
If space is at a premium, look for these specific plants or see if
these miniatures have been used as parents in the plants that
you’re considering:
 Phalaenopsis equestris: A dwarf species that is often used
as one of the parents for breeding dwarf growth habits.
 Phalaenopsis Sogo Twinkle (see Figure 10-10): Sogo is the
name of a well-known orchid nursery in Taiwan that produces
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
134

some excellent phalaenopsis including many that are small
growers.
 Doritaenopsis Purple Gem: This dwarf variety most com-
monly comes in shades of pink and purple, but there are also
white forms. It frequently blooms more than once a year.
 Phalaenopsis Carmela’s Pixie: Produced by Carmella
Orchids, a nursery in Hawaii that has long been a grower and
breeder of fine moth orchids including this diminutive one.
 Phalaenopsis Cassandra: Displays a 21⁄2-inch (6-cm) clear
white flower with a yellow flush and light-brown barring on
the lower, outermost parts of the flower and throat. Some
forms are fragrant.
 Phalaenopsis Be Tris: This mini has been around quite a
while. It’s still offered and is commonly used as a parent to
pass its small plant size on to its offspring.
 Phalaenopsis Mini Mark ‘Holm’ (see Figure 10-11): This plant
is so charming. It has light floral-scented white flowers that are
speckled in orange with an orange-red lip and that are a little
over 1 inch (2.5 cm) across.
Figure 10-10: Phalaenopsis Sogo Twinkle is a 
compact gem that produces many charming flowers 
on a very small plant with short flower spikes.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 135

Figure 10-11: Phalaenopsis Mini Mark ‘Holm’ is a delightful miniature 
phalaenopsis that everyone has space for.
Answering the call of the wild
Earlier in this chapter, I mentioned a number of phalaenopsis
species that are fragrant. Here are some others that are not as
commonly grown because many people prefer the newer varieties
with larger, rounder flowers, but interest in species is increasing
as people are starting to better appreciate their simple, less com-
plicated look.
Here are some species that are worth considering:
 Phalaenopsis amabilis: This native of Indonesia is the
parent of most of today’s white hybrids. The white flower
with a yellow lip can last for months. It is not as round as the
newer hybrids, but it has its own grace.
 Phalaenopsis buissoniania: Unlike most of the other pha-
laenopsis species, this one bears its medium pink flowers on
an upright, up to 3-foot (1-m) tall stem, rather than an arched
flower stem.
 Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi: The flower stem on this species
is flat and produces yellow, glossy flowers that are barred in
maroon. Its flowers are borne sequentially, so don’t cut off
the flower spike, because new flowers will continue to arise
from it.

 Phalaenopsis mariae: The flower of this orchid is marked
with bright spots of brown and red (see Figure 10-12). It will
frequently have multiple, short flower spikes in the spring and
summer.
 Phalaenopsis schilleriana: A parent of many of the pink
hybrids sold today. Like Phalaenopsis stuartiana, a mature
plant produces a flurry of flowers and its leaves are beauti-
fully marbled.
 Phalaenopsis stuartiana (see Figure 10-13): A mature
plant of this variety can have up to 100 white flowers on
a branched spike. The foliage (refer to Figure 10-1) is beauti-
fully patterned.
Figure 10-12: Phalaenopsis mariae sports a colorful pattern of brown 
and red spots on its glossy white flower.
Don’t buy wild-collected plants. They deplete the natural popula-
tion of these plants from their natives lands from which they have
sometimes been illegally removed. Wild-collected plants take quite
a while to become established, and their leaves are tattered from
their jungle experience. Species phalaenopsis that have been 
nursery-grown from seed are generally more vigorous and will
adjust better to a home environment. So, only buy from a grower
or supplier who assures you that his orchids are seed-grown, not
wild-collected.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 137

Figure 10-13: Phalaenopsis stuartiana makes quite a show with its flurry 
of white flowers backed with stunning foliage.
Oh, Give Me a Home . . . : 
Cultural Requirements
Moth orchids do well in medium to low light, similar to other
houseplants like African violets. They also thrive in moderate
humidity of 50 percent or so and average daytime temperatures
of 70°F to 80°F (21°C to 26°C) during the day and about 65°F (18°C)
at night.
Moth orchids are particularly susceptible to a disease commonly
called crown rot, which is usually the result of water pooling in the
small pocket formed at the new, young growth of the orchid. To
prevent this disease, make sure this growing point stays dry
overnight. If you need to, use a cotton swab to remove this extra
moisture.
Relatives of Moth Orchids
Moth orchids have various relatives that are also easy growers and
good choices for beginners. These orchids have similar cultural
requirements to moth orchids, unless otherwise noted, and come
in different flower shapes and colors and many are fragrant.

Africa’s gift to orchid lovers: 
The Angraecoids
Africa and its neighboring islands have always harbored mystery
and intrigue with their fantastic fauna and flora. The orchids of this
part of the world hold this same allure. Many of these orchids have
waxy-white, star-shaped, heavenly scented flowers on plants with
dark-green leathery leaves. Some are humongous and would only
fit in a greenhouse with plenty of room, while others are of a man-
ageable size or even miniature. In general, they require more light
than phalaenopsis but have the same preference for warm, humid
growing areas.
All angraecoids can be a bit touchy about repotting, so grow them
in a fresh, long-lasting mix or mount them, so you don’t have to
repot them often.
A few of the big fellows
If you have plenty of space, here are a few spectacular orchids that
are worth your consideration:
 Angraecum sequipedale: Commonly called the Star of
Bethlehem or the King of Angraecums, this Madagascan
native is a spectacular orchid with 41⁄2-inch (11-cm) waxy
white blossoms blessed with the heady fragrance of jasmine
(see Figure 10-14). Because this plant prefers very strong light
and ultimately grows up to 3 feet (1 meter) tall and wide, it
requires a large sunroom or a greenhouse.
 Angraecum Longiscott: Quite a showy angraecum hybrid,
the plant grows 36 inches (90 cm) high and 12 inches (30 cm)
wide. It produces 3-inch (7.5-cm) waxy, white lipped flowers
with greenish sepals with 8- to 10-inch (20- to 25-cm) spurs
that are borne on up to 24-inch (60-cm) arching spikes. It has
a jasmine scent and is a reliable bloomer.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 139
A moth with a 12-inch tongue!
Angraecum sequipedale was made famous by Charles Darwin who postulated that
there must be a night-flying moth with a 12-inch tongue to be able to harvest the
nectar from the flower of this orchid and in the process pollinate it. Darwin’s scien-
tific colleagues thought this belief to be preposterous. Thirty-five years after his
death, he was proven right when a hawk moth, the pollinator for this orchid, with a
12-inch (30-cm) tongue, was found!

Figure 10-14: Angraecum sequipedale
has a waxy, fragrant flower that can 
last for months.
These might be more your size
Not everyone has the growing room necessary to accommodate the
burly plants described earlier, so these smaller cousins may be a
better choice for most. They have the same waxy, white, long-lasting
flowers with delightful fragrances, but on much smaller plants.
 Angraecum compactum: As the second Latin name suggests,
this is a more manageable sized plant that is about 10 inches
(25 cm) wide and 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) high. It is a
slow grower, but easy to grow, and it dependably produces 
3-inch (7.5 cm), waxy-white, citrus-scented flowers after it’s
established.
 Angraecum leonis: This species is very popular because
of its handsome green compact habit, about 6 to 10 inches
(15 to 25 cm) high and wide with a relatively large 11⁄2-inch 
(4-cm) waxy white flower (see Figure 10-15).
Some smaller Angraecum relatives
Here are some charmers that are nice additions to your collection,
all very fragrant:
 Aerangis citrata: This is an easy choice, an adaptable plant
that thrives in lower light conditions and is a very compact
grower. It blooms several times a year and has a light lemon
fragrance (see Figure 10-16).
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
140

 Aerangis fastuosa: Another gem with compact glossy green
foliage with up to six flowers, with the fragrance of tuberose,
in bloom at once.
 Angranthes Grandalena: This is one of my favorites because
as this plant matures, it produces multiple growths with recur-
ring, almost constant blooming. It produces 3-inch (7.5-cm),
green-white spurred, jasmine-scented flowers borne singly that
show off against its very compact, glossy, dark-green leaves.
Figure 10-15: Angraecum leonis
is a smaller grower that will fit 
anyone’s growing space.
Figure 10-16: Aerangis citrata displays 
up to 30 flowers in arching sprays.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 141

Vandas and some of their 
close cousins
Anyone who has been to Hawaii is familiar with the orchids that
are used in the welcoming leis; most often, they’re vandas. Sadly,
the varieties used for these flowery necklaces are ones only suit-
able for growing in Hawaii and other very bright areas. Fortunately,
there are others in this group that are less demanding but still can
be quite a challenge for many home growers because of their higher
light requirements. If you live in warmer, higher light areas of the
country, like Hawaii, Florida, or parts of California, these plants are
more doable.
Large strap-leaved vandas are simply gorgeous and are found in a
wide range of colors including heavenly blues (see Figure 10-17),
cotton-candy pinks, sunny yellows, and hot oranges. The flowers
can be quite huge, 5 to 6 inches (12.5 to 15 cm) across on some
hybrids.
Although they don’t require as bright light as some of the other
vandas, they still present quite a challenge to home growers in the
northern part of the United States who experience heavy cloud
cover and short, dark days in the winter. To grow them in these
areas, you need to have an exceptionally sunny southern window
or a hobby greenhouse. I’ve grown and bloomed some of them
under high-intensity lights, but you don’t want to know what my
electric bill was!
Figure 10-17: This strap-leaved variety, Vanda Kasem’s Delight, shows 
the typical large round flowers of today’s superb quality varieties.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
142

Ascocendas are the result of breeding the larger vandas with a
much smaller growing group of plants called ascocentrums. Their
flowers may not be quite as giant as the 6-inch (15 cm) flowered
strap-leaved vandas, but they can still be showstoppers and their
smaller stature makes them much easier to manage. Grow them in
a sunny window or close to florescent lights. Search out those that
have the smaller sized growth habit.
Ascocendas come in a wide range of colors with many different
varieties. Here are a few of the classics:
 Ascocenda Yip Sum Wah: The most famous of all ascocen-
das. It is most commonly found in bright oranges or reds,
sometimes in purples, but it’s also available in shades of
yellow. It’s noted for its prolific blooming and relatively 
compact habit.
 Ascocenda Peggy Foo: Another fine performer with clear,
glossy red flowers on a compact plant (see the color insert
for a full-color photo).
 Ascocenda Medasand: Still used in breeding to produce 
superior plants. Plants like Ascocenda Medasand are 
frequently grown in teak baskets like the one shown in 
Figure 10-18, because they afford the excellent drainage
that ascocendas and vandas love. They can also be grown
in pots as long as there are plenty of holes in the bottom of
the containers.
Figure 10-18: Ascocenda Medasand in a teak basket.
Chapter 10: Moth Orchids and Their Relatives 143

Here is an assortment of different vanda-type orchids that I 
recommend:
 Aerides odorata: Bears clove-scented white flowers with
purple spots on a pendulous flower spike. Leaves are about
10 inches (25 cm) long, but the stem grows quite tall, so this
plant would be suitable in a bright window, but not under lights.
 Neofinetia falcata: This dwarf plant, 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to
10 cm) high with waxy white flowers about 1 inch (2.5cm)
wide is easy to bloom on a bright windowsill or under lights.
It’s frequently used as a parent to impart its compact growth
habit and vanilla fragrance to its offspring (see Figure 10-19).
Commonly called the Japanese Wind Orchid, this was once the
exclusive property of the Royal Family of Japan. Commoners
were forbidden to have it in their possession. Its cultivation
dates many centuries back to the Edo period in Japan. It was
first described in 1784.
 Neostylis Lou Sneary: This has been a very successful variety
that has a compact habit (inherited from one of its parents,
Neofinetia falcata). It comes in various color forms — white,
pink, and blue. All produce a flurry of 1-inch (2.5-cm) fragrant
flowers and make super plants for growing on the windowsill
or under lights.
 Ascofinetia Cherry Blossom: Another compact beauty with
lightly fragrant rose-lavender flowers that is the result of
breeding an ascocentrum with our Japanese friend, neofinetia.
 Renanthera monachica: Many of the renantheras are huge
plants that can get several feet tall and so are a bit of a chal-
lenge to handle in the house. This is a dazzling dwarf form
that takes years to get up to 1 foot (30 cm). Its flowers are the
colors of a bright yellow-orange flame (see Figure 10-20).
 Rhynchostylis gigantea: When you smell the intoxicating
citrus fragrance of this orchid, commonly called foxtail orchid
because of the shape of its pendulous cluster of flowers, you
will be hooked. This can eventually become a quite large
orchid, but it will take many years to get there. This one 
performs great in a sunny window. There are several color
forms including the most common white with purple spots,
all white, and solid burgundy red, at times referred to as the
Sagarik Strain (see Figure 10-21).
 Rhynchostylis retusa: This looks very similar to the preceding
plant and its flower color range is similar. The flowers tend to
be smaller but there are usually more of them on longer flower
spikes.
 Rhynchostylis coelestis: Unlike the other two rhynchostylis,
this one has upright flower spikes and the most common
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
144

form has blue and white flowers. Other color forms are pink
and white.
 Sedirea japonica: Another gift from Asia that not many
Western orchidists are familiar with. After I witnessed this
orchid being judged for its lemon fragrance at the New York
International Orchid Show, I made a beeline for the vendor
who was selling this charmer. I found myself behind a long
line of mostly Asian folks ahead of me who fully appreciated
this orchid’s merits. It’s like a dwarf phalaenopsis in its
growth habit, with about 6-inch (15-cm) leaves and has the
same cultural requirements.
Figure 10-19: Neofinetia falcata — commonly 
called the Japanese Wind Orchid.

colored orchid.

Cattleyas and Their Relatives
In This Chapter
 Understanding how cattleyas and laelias made it from nature to your home
 Growing cattleyas’ wild relatives
 Looking at the man-made cattleya orchids
 Discovering small-growing cattleyas, the minicatts
W
hen people picture what a typical orchid looks like, the cat-
tleya flower is usually what comes to mind. Years ago, the
ultimate gift to give your mother or grandmother on Mother’s Day
was a cattleya orchid corsage. Back then, these were usually fra-
grant flowers in various shades of lavender.
Until the skyrocketing popularity of the phalaenopsis took off sev-
eral years ago, the cattleyas were the undisputed kings of orchids.
They’re still highly popular, because they offer huge and frequently
fragrant flowers, in a complete spectrum of colors and flower
shapes, on plants varying in size from a few inches (5 cm) to a few
feet (60 cm) tall. To see how the glorious flowers of cattleyas are
constructed, see Figure 11-1.
In this chapter, I introduce you to a few of the many orchids in this
illustrious group that are readily available and easy to grow. You’ll
see why they epitomize the beauty and fragrance that only orchids
can offer.
Cattleyas grow best in moderate humidity and medium to bright
light, with good air circulation, and in intermediate temperatures.
For general cultural information, see Chapter 7.

(1 = Sepals; 2 = Petals; 3 = Lip; 4 = Column; 5 = Bud; 6 = Sheath).
From the Jungles to Your Home
In the 1800s, plant collectors and explorers risked their lives and
lived in steamy tropical outposts to bring these South American
orchids to the plant lovers of Europe. Today, all the best forms are
readily available and none have been collected from the wild.
Instead, the best cattleyas are raised from seed in laboratory
flasks, which is not only good news from a conservation stand-
point (they aren’t resulting in destroyed natural habitats from field
collecting) but also because these plants are generally stronger
and more vigorous than those collected from the wild and adapt
better to home-growing situations.

Some selected cattleya species
Some of the cattleya species are a little more of a challenge to grow
than the hybrids, so if you want to go right to the easier plants,
skip this section and move on to “The Queens of the Ball: Cattleya
Hybrids,” later in this chapter.
However, if you prefer the simple, classic flower that the species
offers, here are some to try that are usually readily available:
 Cattleya amethystoglossa: You’ll need a tall, very bright
window to accommodate this orchid, because it can reach
3 feet (1 meter) in height. Its 21⁄2-inch (7-cm) light pink flowers
speckled with purple and highlighted with a purple lip are in
clusters of up to a dozen and appear in the spring.
 Cattleya aurantiaca: A longtime favorite with dark green
shiny leaves on a compact 12-inch (30-cm) plant, this orchid is
loaded with clusters of orange to red, 11⁄2- to 2-inch (4- to 5-cm)
flowers.
 Cattleya bicolor: Clusters of 3-inch (7.5-cm) coppery to 
pinkish-brown, waxy, spicy-scented flowers with contrasting
bright-pink lips that appear in the spring make this species
a standout. The plant grows to about 20 to 36 inches (50 to
85 cm) tall. Repot this orchid only when new roots are start-
ing to develop.
 Cattleya guttata: This orchid is very similar in most respects
to Cattleya amethystoglossa, except that it blooms in the
summer and fall.
 Cattleya harrisoniana (see Figure 11-2): Pink to deep rose,
floral-scented flowers are displayed on this summer or fall
bloomer. This plant is best repotted in the spring.
 Cattleya intermedia: A medium-size grower that reaches
about 15 inches (40 cm) high with leaves about 6 inches
(15 cm) long, this orchid produces sizable, 6-inch (15-cm)
sweet floral-scented flowers that are a light pink with a con-
trasting dark purple lip.
 Cattleya leuddemanniana: Up to five 41⁄2- to 5-inch (10- to 
13-cm) richly purple flowers veined in yellow adorn this floral-
scented, spring-blooming plant.
 Cattleya maxima (see Figure 11-3): Loaded with 5-inch 
(12.5-cm) lavender-pink, baby-powder-scented flowers that
display lips with dark purple veins and yellow throats, this
fall- to early-winter-blooming orchid is Peru’s national flower.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 149

Figure 11-2: Cattleya harrisoniana has been a longtime favorite cattleya species.
Some tall-growing cattleyas can be very top-heavy, especially when
they’re in full bloom. Potting them in squat, azalea-type clay pots
that have wider bases and/or putting 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of clean
gravel in the bottom of the pots helps prevent the plants from top-
pling over.
Figure 11-3: Peru is proud to have the Cattleya 
maxima as its national flower.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
150

Some selected laelia species
Laelias look very much like cattleyas. In fact, few amateurs are able
to tell them apart. One difference: Laelias usually have somewhat
of a smaller lip than cattleyas. Laelias are native to the same areas
as their close cousins, cattleyas, and have very similar cultural
requirements.
Following is a sampling of some of the easier and more beautiful
laelias that are worthy of space in your orchid collection:
 Laelia anceps (see Figure 11-4): This orchid is a toughie
that’s hardy to 20°F (–6.6°C) and is a favorite for growing out-
doors in mild parts of California and the southeastern United
States. It comes in various color forms but most commonly has
clusters of two to six 21⁄2- to 3-inch (6- to 8-cm) light lavender
flowers with darker purple lips and throats. The flower spike
can reach up to 3 feet (1 meter), so be sure to give it plenty of
headroom when it sends up its flower spikes.
 Laelia perrinii: A native of Brazil, this species is not yet com-
monly found, but it’s sure to increase in popularity because it’s
a robust grower, reaching about 14 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm)
in height. It sports lightly spice-scented, fine-quality, lavender
flowers measuring up to 6 inches (15 cm) across, with lips that
are trumpet-shaped and edged with deep violet with white in
the throat. Blue and white color forms are also available.
 Laelia pumila: A compact grower that only reaches a height
of 8 inches (20 cm), this species is frequently grown mounted on
a slab of tree fern or cork. It has a short flower spike with one
to two lightly floral-scented flowers that average 3 to 4 inches
(8 to 10 cm) across. The entire flower is lavender-colored,
sometimes with a darker lip. It comes in other color forms,
including a blue one.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 151
The real truth about flower color
Orchid flower color descriptions in catalogs sometimes reflect more what the breeder
or seller of orchids would prefer the flower color to be than what it actually is. When
the flower color is described as “yellow,” “pink,” “white,” or “orange,” it’s usually
close to this. When the color descriptions drift toward solid blues and clear reds, this
is where wishful thinking sometimes takes over. Most “blues” are actually bluish
shades of purple or lavender, and most “reds” are actually dark-oranges.

 Laelia purpurata: This orchid is frequently referred to as the
“Queen of Laelias,” because it has the largest and showiest
flowers of its genus. This is a glorious plant with flowers that
vary quite a bit from plant to plant but generally are about
6 inches (15 cm) across, white, frequently with violet-blue lips
(there are various lip colors), and a spicy or anise scent. It
needs to be grown on the cooler and drier side during the
winter months to bloom best in the spring to summer.
Figure 11-4: Laelia anceps bears its flowers on tall, 
elegant spikes.
Other cattleya relatives
A slew of other orchid species are closely related to cattleyas and
laelias. In the following sections, I tip you off to some good perform-
ers from this group.
Brassavolas
You’ll find several excellent brassavola species, but the one that
leads the pack because of its popularity and ease of growing (with
the same cultural requirements as cattleyas) is Brassavola nodosa
(shown in Figure 11-5), commonly called “Lady of the Night,” because
of its enchanting and permeating evening fragrance. One to six of
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
152

its spidery greenish white flowers, from 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm)
across, are borne on a 6-inch (15-cm) flower stem. It’s a clump-
forming orchid that gives its best show when it isn’t divided.
Figure 11-5: Brassavola nodosa is often recommended as a beginner’s 
orchid because of its ease of culture.
Other brassavolas worth considering are
 Brassavola cordata: Has up to 20 lime green, 2-inch (5-cm)
blooms with heart-shaped lips. Usually blooms twice a year.
 Brassavola cucullata: Has spidery, exotic white to green
flowers that are sometimes tinged with yellow or burgundy.
Blooms in the summer to fall.
 Brassavola flagellaris: Relatively unknown but easy to grow.
Its flower is similar in shape and color to the others in this
group, but it’s blessed with a wonderful hot-chocolate fragrance.
 Brassavola martiana: Its flower is white with a fringed lip
and green-yellow points.
 Brassavola perrinii: This species has one of the largest flow-
ers of the brassavolas. It usually blooms in the summer but can
be variable.
Broughtonia
Broughtonia sanguinea (shown in Figure 11-6) is a small grower, 
3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) high, with clusters of 1-inch (2.5-cm) 
reddish-purple, pink, magenta to crimson flowers, usually veined
in dark purple on an 8- to 16-inch (20- to 40-cm) stem. This orchid
blooms in the summer and likes a very bright spot. Water and fer-
tilize it regularly during its peak growth in the summertime.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 153

Figure 11-6: Broughtonia sanguinea is a charmer native to Cuba and Jamaica.
Encyclias
This group contains some of the easiest of all orchids to grow and
bloom. Many of them are also fragrant.
 Encyclia adenocaula: Most encyclias are shades of green
and white with some purple markings. This Mexican beauty is
different, with rosy-pink to magenta, star-shaped flowers that
are borne on long branched sprays.
 Encyclia cochleata (see Figure 11-7): Commonly called the
“cockleshell” or “clamshell” orchid because its upside-down
flower lip looks like one, this unique-looking orchid is very
easy to grow and often blooms several times a year. The lip
is streaked with purple, while the rest of the spidery shaped
flower is lime green.
 Encyclia cordigera: Not only is this species considered to be
one of the handsomest in the encyclia group, it also fills the
air with the fragrance of vanilla. It displays clusters of deep
maroon flowers with bright pink lips. The plant is modest in
size and grows 12 to 15 inches (30 to 37 cm) tall. See the color
photographs in the center of this book for an example.
 Encyclia fragrans: The flower of this very-easy-to-grow orchid
is a 2-inch (5-cm) subtle green with purple stripes in the lip.
This orchid is so well-liked because it’s so easy to grow and
bloom and because it emits a heavy gardenia fragrance.
 Encyclia radiata (see Figure 11-8): The subtle creamy white,
cockleshell-type flowers with purple stripes in the lip, borne in
clusters, are not what make this orchid so popular — though
they could be. Instead, its ease of growing and blooming and
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
154

wonderful fragrance — which has been variously described as
smelling spicy-floral or like coconut cream pie, lilac, cinnamon,
and hyacinth — are what keep people coming back to this
orchid.
 Encyclia tampense: A Florida native that is hardy as far north
as the central part of the state, this encyclia has green flowers
overlaid with brown with white lips marked with purple
blotches. It emits a sweet scent when it flowers in the summer.
Figure 11-7: Encyclia cochleata is 
recommended as an ideal beginner’s 
orchid because it’s so easy to grow and 
blooms on an almost constant basis.
Figure 11-8: The claim to fame of the Encyclia 
radiata is its sweet-scented flowers.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 155

Epidendrum
This group is filled with very brightly colored members and some
have a very strong resemblance to encyclias.
 Epidendrum ciliare (see Figure 11-9): The 3- to 6-inch (7.5-
to 15-cm) lime-green petals of this orchid are set off by its
exquisite white fringed lip. The plant reaches about 16 inches
(40 cm) tall and is said to have the fragrance of grapefruit.
 Epidendrum difforme: This orchid has glossy green flowers
about 11⁄4 inches (3 cm) on short spikes with a medicinal scent.
 Epidendrum cinnabarinum: Bright-orange 11⁄2-inch (4-cm) flow-
ers with fringed yellow lips are the main feature of this colorful
epidendrum. The flowers are borne in succession, so the plant
can be in bloom for months during the summer. This orchid can
grow quite tall, up to 4 feet (120 cm), and is often grown in
large, mass plantings in semitropical to tropical climates.
 Epidendrum stamfordianum: A large, well-grown plant of
this type of orchid is something to see. It’s loaded with spikes
of hundreds of fragrant, 2-inch (5-cm) yellow flowers painted
in burgundy with white and yellow lips. It usually blooms in
late winter to early spring.
Figure 11-9: Epidendrum ciliare has a spidery 
green flower with a delicate white fringed lip.

156

Sophronitis
The sophronitis genus primarily consists of dwarf-growing plants
with oversized red and orange cattleya-shaped flowers that shimmer
in the sunlight. If you see any of them at a greenhouse for sale — for
example, Sophronitis grandiflora (orange-red, shown in Figure 11-10),
Sophronitis coccinea (scarlet), or Sophronitis cernua (orange) —
you’ll surely want to buy one.
Figure 11-10: Sophronitis grandiflora is a charming plant, but it can be 
quite a challenge to grow and bloom. A better choice may be a hybrid 
that uses one of the sophronitis species as a parent.
But don’t! At least not until you have several years of orchid grow-
ing under your belt. These diminutive darlings can be very tricky
to grow and bloom. You’re much better off purchasing a hybrid
that has used one of these species as a parent (see “Hot reds and
oranges” and “Minicatts,” later in this chapter). These hybrids are
more vigorous, easier to flower, and much less demanding.
The Queens of the Ball: 
Cattleya Hybrids
A modern, standard-size cattleya hybrid in full bloom is a sight to
behold! Thanks to the skill of orchid hybridizers and the breeding
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 157

willingness of cattleyas and their relatives to participate in this
process, the results have been flowers in a breathtaking array of
colors and heady fragrances.
Because cattleya breeding has progressed to such a high state of
perfection, it’s actually difficult to pick out a bad one. In the follow-
ing sections, I show you a few of the many outstanding hybrids,
arranged by approximate color group.
Pristine whites
White cattleyas are almost as classic as the lavender ones. The
modern hybrids have full, round, and fragrant flowers. Here are
two old classics that are still popular:
 Brassocattleya Mount Hood: This orchid is a pristine white
with a golden-yellow lip and the heady fragrance of vanilla.
 Cattleya Bow Bells: This is another old-timer that you’ll find
in the background of many of today’s hybrids. It has fine form
and its frilly lip is marked on the inside with a touch of yellow.
Purples, pinks, lavenders, and blues
Purple hybrids have been around a long time. You can’t go wrong
in buying any in this color group — they’re all very good to excel-
lent. The blue shades in cattleyas are newer. Most of the purples
are fragrant. Here are just a few possibilities:
 Brassocattleya Blue Grotto: This orchid is referred to as a
blue, but it’s more like a violet purple.
 Brassocattleya Norman’s Bay ‘Low’s’ FCC/AOS: Although first
introduced in England in 1946, this is still a standard bearer
today of purple cattleya breeding and is still used as a parent.
 Brassocattleya Pamela Hetherington ‘Coronation’ FCC/AOS:
Named for a family member of the illustrious cattleya breeder,
Ernest Hetherington, this is a 6-inch (15-cm) lavender-pink
flower with a pink ruffled lip and orange-yellow throat. Its
flower is a superb shape and is strongly fragrant.
 Cattleya Irene Holguin: This is a lavender orchid with excel-
lent shape and color.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
158

 Laeliocattleya Bonanza Queen: A classic 6-inch (15-cm)
lavender with gold veins in the throat.
 Iwanagaara Appleblossom: This hybrid has a complicated
history. It’s the result of using various different genera for par-
ents, four to be exact — brassavola, cattleya, diacrium, and
laelia. The result is a hybrid with elegant sprays of sweet-
smelling, 31⁄2-inch (9-cm) light-pink flowers with darker pink
markings and gold in the throat. A Hawaiian family, Iwanaga,
was the first to create a hybrid using these genera, so this is
how this new genus got its name.
Hot reds and oranges
Most of the red hybrids are compact growers because a frequent
parent in these is one of the sophronitis, which are both red and
very dwarf. Here are some to look for — either as plants you’ll
grow, or in the parentage of the plants you’re considering:
 Sophrolaeliocattleya Jewel Box ‘Scheherazade’ AM/AOS
(see Figure 11-11): An older hybrid that is still popular today
because of its manageable size, clear red flowers, and easy
culture.
 Sophrolaeliocattleya Jewel Box ‘Dark Waters’: Another
popular one that is a very dark red clone.
 Brassolaeliocattleya Oconee: A large-flowered orchid, with
fragrant, red-purple flowers with a dark red lip.
 Brassolaeliocattleya Edisto: Large purple-red, with up to five
flowers per stem. This is a fall bloomer.
 Brassolaeliocattleya Owen Holmes ‘Mendenhall’ AM/AOS:
Considered one of the best of all reds, it’s frequently used as
a parent to pass its superior coloring to its offspring. A good
choice.
 Sophrolaeliocattleya Hazel Boyd: Another winner with vari-
ous bright-orange tones and excellent plant vigor.
 Cattleya Chocolate Drop ‘Kodama’ AM/AOS: This one has
clusters of glossy burgundy flowers with yellow on the column
and the fragrance of lily-of-the-valley.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 159

Figure 11-11: Sophrolaeliocattleya Jewel Box ‘Scheherazade’ AM/AOS 
still remains a favorite.
Sunny yellows
Fine yellows have been a more recent development. Today’s
hybrids range from gold to butter yellow. Some are sold yellow,
while others have darker colored red or purple splotched lips.
A few names you can look for include the following:
 Brassocattleya Goldenzelle ‘Lemon Chiffon’ (see Figure
11-12): A fine example of how far yellow flowers in cattleya
hybrids have come, this one sports 6-inch (15-cm) lemon-
yellow flowers with a splash of deep red on the lip. This is a
winter bloomer.
 Brassocattleya Formosan Gold: Its dark-red ruffled lip pro-
vides a dramatic contrast with its golden-yellow petals and
sepals that have a spread of about 41⁄2 inches (11 cm) across.
See the color photographs in the center of the book for a look
at this orchid.
 Brassocattleya Malworth ‘Orchidglade’ FCC/AOS: Highly
awarded and one of the best known yellows.
 Laeliocattleya Lorraine Shirae: A bright yellow with a con-
trasting red lip.
 Potinara Twentyfour Carat: A large, handsome, clear 
gold-yellow.
 Potinara Haw Yuan Gold: The Taiwan orchid breeders have
been making notable contributions to the cattleya group, and
this award-winner with its 6-inch (15-cm) bicolor bloom —
yellow petals and darker yellow lip — is one of them.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
160

Figure 11-12: Brassocattleya Goldenzelle ‘Lemon Chiffon’ AM/AOS 
is a gorgeous soft lemon-yellow that demonstrates well the advances 
in breeding. This one is a frequent winner at orchid shows.
Cool greens
There is something refreshing about lime-green flowers. They have
their own following of orchid lovers. Some of their flowers have
very fringed lips, usually inherited from the species Rhyncholaelia
digbyana (formerly know as Brassavola digbyana). This unique
species is also noted for its strong fragrance. Some of the greens
have clear-colored flowers, while others are blotched in purple.
Here are some choices to consider:
 Brassocattleya Greenwich: This cross was made in the late
1960s but still shows up in today’s offerings. The flower is
about 4 inches across with purple markings on its fringed lip.
 Brassocattleya Ports of Paradise ‘Emerald Isle’ HCC/AOS:
One of the most awarded of the greens, this orchid offers large
lime-green flowers, a strong fragrance, and a ruffled lip.
 Brassocattleya Rio’s Green Magic (see Figure 11-13): This
hybrid shows, with its deeply fringed lip, the influence of the
species Rhyncholaelia digbyana. It has large, 5-inch (13-cm)
flowers.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 161

Figure 11-13: Brassocattleya Rio’s Green Magic offers unique beauty 
and a sensuous fragrance.
Bring out the clowns: Splash 
petals and flares
This group is commonly called “clowns” because of the sense of
gaiety their wild color combinations impart. They’re marked with
two or more splashes or flares of contrasting colors, and the
results can be quite dramatic.
 Cattleya intermedia var. aquinii: This is the orchid that
really started it all. It was the first one that displayed flares
of color in the petals and lip, so it was used extensively in
hybridizing to pass this quality on to its offspring. In this case,
the coloring was purple flares on white petals and the lip. This
variety is sometimes offered for sale these days but is more
frequently found in the parentage of many of the newer splash
petals and flares.
 Brassocattleya Momilani Rainbow: A real showstopper with
6-inch (15-cm) flowers and light lavender-pink sepals, dark pink
petals, and lips with bright splashes of lemon yellow on them.
 Laeliocattleya Colorama ‘The Clown’: Another old classic that
has proven invaluable as a parent for future splash-petaled
varieties, this orchid has white petals and purple flares with a
larger flower than Cattleya intermedia var. aquinii.
 Laeliocattleya Gaiety Flambeau: A more modern hybrid that
has large clusters of white flowers with purple flares.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
162

 Laeliocattleya Mari’s Song ‘CTM 217’: This is one of the best
and most popular tricolored, splash-petaled varieties. It has a
yellow and white flower with magenta flares and lip with pink
sepals and a yellow throat. What a grand color combo! On top
of that, it’s very fragrant.
 Potinara Barana Beauty ‘Burana’ HCC/AOS (see Figure
11-14): A compact grower that reaches about 12 inches
(30 cm) tall, its 31⁄2-inch (9-cm) citrus-scented flowers are a
yellow-green with red flares. Frequently blooms twice a year.
Figure 11-14: Potinara Barana Beauty ‘Burana’ HCC/AOS offers clusters of
citrus-scented green flowers with red flares.
Fashionable art shades
This is a catchall category that includes cattleya-type hybrids
that combine a range of pastel colors. Here are a few of the many
nice ones:
 Brassolaeliocattleya George King: A salmon-peachy, fra-
grant, 6-inch (15-cm) flower with crystalline texture and the
fact that this one often blooms more than once a year make
this a popular selection.
 Brassolaeliocattleya Harlequin ‘Act II’: Another flower with
a mixed palette of colors including peach, yellow, and purple
flares. A sumptuous beauty. See the color photographs in the
center of this book for an example.
 Brassolaeliocattleya Hawaiian Avalanche (see Figure 11-15):
This orchid shows off a delightful display of tropical color with
the 6-inch (15-cm) apricot-pink flowers with a golden-orange
fringed lip and purple streak down the center of the lip.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 163

Figure 11-15: Brassolaeliocattleya Hawaiian Avalanche provides a riot of color.
In this close-up of the lip, you can get an idea of the play of color and patterns.
For standard cattleyas, purchasing clones is usually your best bet.
(See Chapter 2 for more information on clones or meristems.)
They’re very reasonably priced, you’ll know exactly what they’ll
look like, and their flowers will usually be superior to the standard
hybrids.
Minicatts
There is a revolution going on now in cattleya breeding! Small is
in — at least in plant size. Although there is no denying that full-
size cattleyas in bloom are impressive, unfortunately they also take
up a lot of growing space. And for windowsill and under-light grow-
ers, where every square inch counts, this creates a problem. This
is where minicatts (short for miniature cattleyas) come in.
They have no special cultural requirements that differ from the
standard, full-size plants: Because they’re commonly planted in
small clay pots, they tend to dry up more quickly than the larger
plants in bigger pots, so you need to keep a sharper eye on your
watering to make sure they don’t get too dry.
The key players
These are the species with miniature to small growth habits that
have been the principal contributors to this breeding effort. Each
of these species is popular in its own right, but each has also been
even more important for contributing its desirable characteristics
to future orchid generations:
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
164

 Brassavola nodosa: For more information on this orchid,
refer to the “Brassavolas” section earlier in this chapter. This
popular species added its small size, spidery flower shape,
and evening fragrance to the minicatt gene pool.
 Cattleya aclandiae: A little dazzler with 3- to 4-inch (7- to 
13-cm) yellowish-green to brown flowers covered with purple
spots and accentuated with a magenta lip, this is not an easy
species to grow. Stick to its hybrids to get the visual effects of
the species without its demanding cultural requirements.
 Cattleya luteola (see Figure 11-16): This is a darling plant
that only reaches 5 to 7 inches (12 to 17.5 cm) tall, making it
perfect for small spaces. Its fresh, floral-scented, 2-inch (5-cm),
pale yellow flowers with a darker lip are borne in sprays of
two to five in the spring.
 Cattleya walkeriana: This diminutive orchid has a lot going for
it. It has a miniature stature, making it ideal for growing under
lights or on a windowsill. Its rose-purple flowers of heavy sub-
stance have a fine shape and an exquisite vanilla and sweet
floral fragrance that is strongest in the morning. It’s also found
in an alba (white) that tends to have the best flower form.
 Laelia briegeri: This is a miniature bright-yellow species that
isn’t easy to grow by itself but has been valuable for its color
and dwarf growing habit that it imparts to its hybrids.
 Laelia pumila: This is another important contributor for it
compact growth habit, flower form, and color.
 Sophronitis coccinea: The shimmering red color and minia-
ture plant habit made this plant an important link. Refer to
Figure 11-12 to see a species, Sophronitis grandiflora, that
looks very much like this one.
Figure 11-16: Cattleya luteola is a cutie with a fresh floral scent that is 
strongest in the morning.
Chapter 11: Cattleyas and Their Relatives 165

Some of their prized children
Here are some of the many hybrids produced by the parents in the
preceding section:
 Brassocattleya Binosa (see Figure 11-17): Combines a strik-
ing color combination, 3-inch (5-cm) bright-green flower with
a white flared lip, dusted with purple speckles, with a sweet
spicy evening perfume inherited from one of its parents,
Brassavola nodosa.
 Brassocattleya Cynthia: An offspring of Cattleya walkeriana,
this variety is very compact, has 4-inch (20-cm) full, round-
pink fragrant flowers with yellow in the throat. It frequently
blooms twice a year.
 Cattleya Brabantiae: One of the first hybrids to be made, in the
1800s, this one has Cattleya aclandiae as one of its parents. Its
21⁄2-inch (6-cm), thick, waxy, pink, fragrant flowers are spotted
with maroon and serve as a backdrop for a stunning white lip
and column edged in purple. It only grows to 6 to 8 inches
(15 to 20 cm) tall and is still popular today.
 Cattleya Peckhaviensis (see Figure 11-18): This orchid shows
off purple spotted flowers with a bright-pink lip much like one
of its parents, Cattleya aclandiae.
 Laeliocattleya Angel Love (see Figure 11-19): An easy-to-grow
fragrant orchid that has perfectly formed, 4-inch (10-cm),
lavender-pink flowers with a frilled lip and yellow in the throat.
 Laeliocattleya Love Knot: Another Cattleya walkeriana child
that is a very small grower, with large 4-inch (10-cm), deep-
red-purple flowers with a darker lip. This one is also fragrant
and blooms twice a year.
 Laeliocattleya Mini Purple: An offspring of Laelia pumila and
Cattleya walkeriana, this is one of the best known and avail-
able of the minicatts. It has lavender flowers with a darker
purple lip and is fragrant.
 Sophrocattleya Beaufort: A classic that has as a parent
Cattleya luteola, this orchid is found in various shades of
orange and red. It continues to be used extensively as a
parent to produce new miniature hybrids.
 Sophrocattleya Crystelle Smith: Frequently winning ribbons
at shows because of its fine form and delicious color combina-
tions that can vary from pastel pink to apricot shades with lips
of solid yellow or marked with red.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
166

 Sophrolaelia Psyche: Another old-timer, this is a miniature
with petite flaming orange-red flowers passed on from its
sophronitis parent. Fortunately, it’s easy to grow.
 Sophrolaeliocattleya Jewel Box: See “Hot reds and
oranges,” earlier in this chapter.
 Sophrolaeliocattleya Mahalo Jack: I’ve enjoyed growing this
orchid. It has a solid red flower on a dwarf plant. Most are fra-
grant and bloom a few times a year.
Figure 11-17: Brassocattleya Binosa ‘Kirk’ AMAOS combines a sweet 
scent with a striking color combination.

Slipper Orchids
In This Chapter
 Seeing the advantages to growing lady’s slippers
 Helping your lady’s slipper to feel at home
 Choosing the right lady’s slipper for you
L
ady’s slippers are some of the easiest orchids to grow and
among the most rewarding orchids you’ll find, making them a
great orchid for beginners. They present a wide range of strikingly
colored, frequently glossy flowers in myriad shapes. Some have
petals that are elegantly twisted, while others are marked with
hairs and warts. All slipper orchids are noted for very-long-lasting
blooms — the flowers usually last six to eight weeks. Many slipper
orchids have gorgeous marbled foliage, which makes them stun-
ningly beautiful, even when they aren’t in bloom. Collectors of slip-
per orchids tend to be a fanatic lot — and it’s easy to see why.
The official name of this group is Paphiopedilum ‘Asian Lady’s
Slipper,’ but you’ll probably hear them referred to as lady’s slip-
pers or just plain slipper orchids — though they’re anything but
plain. These orchids got their common name because of their
pouchlike lip, or labellum, which resembles a lady’s slipper (see
Figure 12-1).
In this chapter, I introduce you to the world of lady’s slipper
orchids — giving you some slipper-specific growing tips, some sug-
gestions of varieties to buy, and some tips on which hybrids are
your best bet.

Figure 12-1: The parts of a lady’s slipper orchid.
Slipping into a Lady’s Slipper
Lady’s slippers are wonderful flowers for beginning orchid grow-
ers. In this section, I fill you in on why you should consider grow-
ing one, what kind of environment to give a lady’s slipper after you
bring it home, and how best to encourage your lady’s slipper to
bloom.
Seeing what lady’s slippers 
have to offer
Lady’s slippers are extremely popular among orchid growers —
professional and amateur alike — because
 They display a great diversity of flower forms.
 Many are easy to grow.
 Many have beautiful foliage.
 Most have very-long-lasting flowers, usually lasting many
weeks.

Giving your lady’s slipper 
a good home
Although lady’s slipper orchids are found in cold climates in North
America, the ones that are most commonly grown indoors are the
ones from the old-world tropics, like Southeast Asia. Almost all
lady’s slippers grow well in average home temperatures — 65°F to
75°F (18°C to 24°C) during the day, and 55°F to 60°F (13°C to 18°C)
during the evening — and have modest humidity requirements.
Some of the lady’s slippers are among the least demanding orchids
when it comes to light, so they’re very adaptable to growing on
windowsills or under lights. (For more general orchid-growing
details, check out Chapter 5.)
Getting lady’s slippers to bloom
Slipper orchids are some of the easiest of all orchids to grow and
bloom. That said, you can’t force these plants to flower if they’re
not mature or if it isn’t their normal time of year to bloom. If your
slipper orchid hasn’t bloomed in over a year, and it needs a little
nudging, try this three-step method:
1. Grow your lady’s slipper in a little brighter spot (see
Chapter 5 for more details about orchid light needs).
If you don’t see the flower buds forming in six to eight
weeks, keep it in this same location and move to Step 2.
2. Drop the temperature at night about 20°F (12°C) cooler
than the daytime temperature.
If you don’t see buds forming in six to eight weeks, move it
back to its regular growing temperature and then move to
Step 3.
3. Let your lady’s slipper get a little drier than usual for six
to eight weeks.
Straight from Nature: Bumps,
Warts, Hairs, and All
Lady’s slipper species, which is what the plants are called as they
come from the wild, display an exotic array of nature’s work. In the
following sections, I give you a sampling of some of the easier-to-
grow of the more than 60 commonly found lady’s slipper species.
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 171

Paphiopedilum bellatulum
Paphiopedilum bellatulum is not the easiest of all lady’s slippers,
but it isn’t difficult if you just keep in mind that these plants prefer
to be a little cooler and drier than the other lady’s slippers.
This orchid is commonly called the “egg-in-a-nest orchid,” because
that’s what its white pouch looks like as it’s surrounded by its
rounded-white with burgundy-spotted petals. The thick leaves of
this dwarf grower (only a few inches high) are beautifully pat-
terned (see Figure 12-2).
Figure 12-2: Paphiopedilum bellatulum is a compact-growing horticultural gem.
Paphiopedilum callosum
Paphiopedilum callosum was the first lady’s slipper orchid that 
I grew, over 30 years ago. I had imported it from Thailand, and
seeing it bloom for the first time was a thrill! It continued to per-
form on a regular basis.
This orchid is one of the simplest to grow and one of the most
dependable to bloom. It comes in various flower shapes and color
combinations of burgundy and green (see Figure 12-3). Its strong
constitution and attractiveness make it very popular as a parent 
in hybridizing. This species is quick to multiply, so it’ll give you a
large plant in a relatively short time.

172

Figure 12-3: Paphiopedilum callosum is as dependable a bloomer as 
you can find.
Paphiopedilum delenatii
Paphiopedilum delenatii is a delicate-looking, prized beauty. I 
used to find this orchid a bit on the temperamental side when it
came to growing. Fortunately, the newer forms on the market today
have more vigor and aren’t finicky as they once were. Mine blooms
dependably each spring, bearing one or two elegant light pink petal
flowers with a darker pink pouch (see Figure 12-4). Unlike most
lady’s slippers that are scentless, this one possesses a subtle and
delightful citrus fragrance.
Paphiopedilum dianthum
Paphiopedilum dianthum is a Chinese species that is relatively easy
to grow, needing just a modest amount of light — mine blooms
consistently every year. This orchid puts on a floral display for
many weeks. Its flowers have twisted green petals and a burgundy-
brown pouch, topped with a white dorsal. The 12- to 16-inch (30- to
40-cm) leaves of this slipper orchid are glossy green with a leath-
ery texture (see Figure 12-5).
Paphiopedilum fairrieanum
The upswept petals and prominently marked dorsal of the
Paphiopedilum fairrieanum present an exotic display (see 
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 173

Figure 12-6). This is another slipper orchid that is undemanding
and can be quickly grown into a nice-sized plant. The most
common form of this species has petals striped in greens and pur-
ples, but there are other color combinations that are yellow, dark
red, and green —some have longer and narrower petals than the
standard type. The albino form — green and white — is especially
enchanting.
Figure 12-4: Paphiopedilum delenatii displays special elegance.

of light to grow and flower well.

A conservation success story
The history of the discovery and collection of orchids is littered with dismaying
accounts of man’s destruction of habitats resulting from the careless and greedy col-
lection of these plants from their native lands. Encouragingly, this isn’t always the case.
Paphiopedilum delenatii was first discovered in Vietnam in 1913 by a French officer.
From the plants collected and exported at that time, only a few survived. One of them
was grown by the famous French orchid nursery of Marcel Lecoufle, who success-
fully produced seeds from it. Shortly after, no more of the plants of this species were
able to be found in the wild. For generations, all the plants of Paphiopedilum delenatii
that were known were those resulting from these seedlings form Marcel Lecoufle!
Now this is a commonly grown and admired species.

Keeping the plant on the cooler, dryer side for six weeks during the
winter will encourage it to put on its spring flower show.
Paphiopedilum glaucophyllum
Paphiopedilum glaucophyllum rewards you with a very long bloom-
ing period — its flowers open one at a time, so the plant can be in
bloom for months. It has attractive blue-green foliage. Its fuzzy
petals — green dorsal edged in white — and rosy pink pouch make
quite a nice presentation (see Figure 12-7).
Figure 12-7: Paphiopedilum glaucophyllum is easy to grow and will 
reward you with months of bloom.

An orchid with a history of intrigue
For over 50 years during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the source of this treasured
orchid, Paphiopedilum fairrieanum, remained a mystery. The only plant that was
known had shown up in a shipment of unknown origin. In 1904, the famous orchid
purveyor in England, Frederick Sander, offered a reward of £1,000 for anyone lead-
ing to the rediscovery of this orchid. This bounty was enough to bring results as new
plants were discovered and exported from Bhutan and sold in the English orchid
auctions for princely sums. Now this same horticultural gem is commonly available
for indoor gardeners worldwide to enjoy at a very modest price.

Paphiopedilum hirsutissimum
Paphiopedilum hirsutissimum is another distinctive Asian beauty. It
has long, lance-shaped, light-green foliage with purple-and-green-
marked flowers with wavy edges (see Figure 12-8). It’s a vigorous
grower but can sometimes be a reluctant bloomer.
Some growers have found if they drop the night temperature to
40°F to 45°F (4°C to 7°C) for several weeks in early winter, this may
trigger flowering.
Figure 12-8: Paphiopedilum hirsutissimum grows in cooler spots than 
many of the other slipper orchids.
Paphiopedilum spicerianum
Definitely one of my favorites, Paphiopedilum spicerianum puts on
a dramatic display. Its shining white dorsal marked with a purple
vertical strip up its center, surrounded by the shades of green and
brown on its petals and pouch, make it a showstopper. Its white
dorsal is so special that this slipper has been used frequently as a
parent in breeding to impart this beautiful feature to its progeny.
Turn to the color photographs in the center of this book for an
example of Paphiopedilum spicerianum.
Paphiopedilum sukhakulii
Some commercial growers lament that Paphiopedilum sukhakulii
grows so quickly that they can’t keep up with it. This is a “problem”
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 177

that most amateur orchid growers would love to have! Paphiopedilum
sukhakulii is a compact grower with prominently and attractively
marked foliage. Figure 12-9 illustrates my plant in a 4-inch (8-cm) pot.
Its flowers offer a green-and-white-striped dorsal, wide-horizontal
petals that are green with mahogany spots and sprinkled with
warts and hairs, all set off with a dark maroon pouch. This species
quickly forms a good-sized plant with many leads, and it frequently
blooms more than once a year. See the color photographs in the
center of this book for another example.
Figure 12-9: Paphiopedilum 
sukhakulii is a compact-growing, 
undemanding, high-performing 
slipper orchid.
Paphiopedilum venustum
Described in the early 1800s, Paphiopedilum venustum was the first
of the lady’s slippers to be cultivated. Its handsome foliage makes
it a standout even before its flowers, with distinctly veined lips and
brightly colored petals, put on their show (see Figure 12-10).
Paphiopedilum venustum is found in many different color forms.
Letting the plants get a little drier in the winter than you would in
the summer increases their likelihood of flowering.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
178

Figure 12-10: Paphiopedilum 
venustum is easily identified by its 
prominently veined lip or pouch.
One Step Removed from Nature:
Primary Hybrids
Primary hybrids are the results of crossing (mating) two different
species, like the ones mentioned in the preceding sections, to create
a new plant. In doing this, exciting new forms of orchids are created.
The crossing process started in the 1800s and is continuing at full
speed today. As new species are being discovered or better forms of
the same species are showing up, the orchid breeder gets more new
genetic material to play with. The results of some of these efforts are
quite impressive.
The goals of breeding vary within the group, but the main purpose
is to
 Expand the color range.
 Vary the flower shapes.
 Make the flowers larger.
 Create a new “look.”
 Make the plants more compact.
 Make the plants more vigorous and easier to bloom.
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 179

In the following sections, I introduce you to just a handful of some of
the many great successes. It’s fun to look at the parents and guess
what the offspring will look like. There are plenty of surprises!
Some superior primary hybrids
These primary hybrids do their parents proud! Each of the follow-
ing hybrids carries the good looks from its parents, but also adds
its own new beauty and, in most cases, is more vigorous and easier
to grow than either of the parents:
 Paphiopedilum Angela: From the photo of this variety
(see Figure 12-11), can you take a guess what one of its par-
ents is? Do you see the exotic touch from one of its parents,
Paphiopedilum fairrieanum (refer to Figure 12-6)? Its other
parent is a darling white species that can be a bit difficult
to grow well, Paphiopedilum niveum. When these two are
mated, the offspring — Paphiopedilum Angela — is a delight-
ful compact-growing plant, easier to grow like Paphiopedilum
fairrieanum, but with the delicate white coloring from
Paphiopedilum niveum.
 Paphiopedilum Armeni White: Another good choice, this
hybrid has very-dark-green patterned foliage and a large, soft-
white flower.
 Paphiopedilum Delophylum: This is an enchanting orchid
with soft pink flowers, borne sequentially, on compact plants
with attractively marked foliage.
Figure 12-11: Paphiopedilum
Angela has a charming flower 
on a compact plant.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
180

 Paphiopedilum Fumi’s Delight: This is another case where
two fetching but sometimes-tricky-to-grow species, when mated
or crossed, yield a more vigorous offspring than either of the
parents. One parent has a bright yellow flower (Paphiopedilum
armeniacum); the other (Paphiopedilum micranthum) has a pink
bloom. The offspring of these parents have flowers varying in
color from creamy yellow to light pink (see Figure 12-12).
 Paphiopedilum Ho Chi Minh: This is a new hybrid that is
highly sought after. One of its parents is Paphiopedilum vietna-
mense, a gorgeous dark pink slipper recently discovered, and
the other is Paphiopedilum delenatii, an elegant soft pink flow-
ered slipper (refer to Figure 12-4). This should be a winning
match.
 Paphiopedilum Gloria Naugle: This orchid is the result 
of crossing the largest-flowered and king of the slippers,
Paphiopedilum rothschildianum, with Paphiopedilum micran-
thum. This hybrid inherits the bold stripes from Paphiopedilum
rothschildianum and the hot pink from its other parent. The
results are quite striking (see Figure 12-13).
 Paphiopedilum Magic Lantern: One of the most popular
newer primaries, Magic Lantern, is a dependable grower and
bloomer and its dark pink to red-pink flowers always elicit
oohs and ahs.
Figure 12-12: Paphiopedilum
Fumi’s Delight is a popular 
primary hybrid.
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 181

Figure 12-13: Paphiopedilum Gloria Naugle presents an arresting picture.
 Paphiopedilum Makulii: Although not literately a primary,
this orchid is very close to it. This hybrid takes the dramatic
petal markings from Paphiopedilum sukhakulii (refer to Figure
12-9) and combines them with the darker flower colorations 
of its Maudiae hybrid cousins (see the section “Marvelous
Maudiaes,” later in this chapter). This lady’s slipper is a snap
to grow.
 Paphiopedilum Saint Swithin: Another hybrid — with one of
its parents being the huge Paphiopedilum rothschildianum —
this orchid is combined with another impressive bloomer,
Paphiopedilum philippinense, which has a smaller growth
habit and a history of being easier to flower. The result is
striped flowers with dangling twisted petals — nothing less
than extraordinary (see Figure 12-14). This is a larger lady’s
slipper than some of the others, but it’s well worth the grow-
ing space! This one does require more light that the other 
slippers mentioned earlier. Grow in the same medium to
bright light you provide cattleyas and it will be happy.
 Paphiopedilum Transvaal: This is a classic beauty first bred
in 1901 and still popular today. It takes its stateliness from
Paphiopedilum rothschildianum but reduces its size and adds
ease of blooming from its other parent, Paphiopedilum cham-
berlainianum. This is another orchid that likes it bright, like
Saint Swithin.
 Paphiopedilum Vanda M. Pearman: One of the most popular
of all primary hybrids, Vanda M. Pearman has large light pink
flowers dusted with dark burgundy spots, all shown off against
thick, leathery, gorgeously marbled foliage (see Figure 12-15).
This is a must-have lady’s slipper.

Swithin puts on a spectacular show!
Figure 12-15: Paphiopedilum Vanda M. Pearman is admired for its 
elegant flower and attractive foliage.
Marvelous Maudiaes
What a fabulous group of lady’s slippers these are. The word
Maudiae is the name given to one of the first hybrids made, in
1901, between Paphiopedilum callosum (see the color photographs
in the center of this book for an example) and Paphiopedilum
lawrenceanum. Paphiopedilum Maudiae and its offspring are noted
for their exceptional vigor, ease of blooming (sometimes more

than once a year), undemanding growing requirements, gorgeous
foliage, and striking, gloriously colored flowers. They are found in
three major color groups or combinations, covered in the following
sections.
Green-and-whites
Green-and-white Maudiaes are occasionally referred to as albinos
because they lack the more commonly found red pigment. There is
a simple timeless elegance to these flowers. They’re highly revered
in Europe as cut flowers.
Some super clones exist within this group like Paphiopedilum
Claire de Lune ‘Edgard van Belle’ AM/AOS (see Figure 12-16). Its
regal name fits its aristocratic look. It’s huge impressive flower
stands proudly above dark green handsome foliage. I received a
division of this plant from a now deceased dear friend, Frances
Nelson. It’s a treasured memory of him, and I’ve shared divisions 
of it with special friends. It’s a vigorous grower that still wins rib-
bons for me at orchid shows.
Another famous clone is Paphiopedilum Maudiae ‘The Queen’
AM/AOS. If you’re fortunate to find these clones at a price you can
live with, snatch them up. If they’re too pricey for you at this point,
try any of the standard green-and-white Maudiaes. None of them
will disappoint you.
Figure 12-16: Paphiopedilum
Claire de Lune ‘Edgard van 
Belle’ AM/AOS is a prize for 
anyone’s orchid collection.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
184

Coloratums
This group is typified by a large dorsal and petals displaying
streaks of purple in the flowers. The flower shape of this type looks
very similar to the green-and-white Maudiae but has much more
red and burgundy markings (see Figure 12-17). Many times the
dorsal is larger and rounder.
Figure 12-17: A coloratum type. Notice the wide dorsal and the streaks 
of darker color throughout the flower.
Vinicolors
The flowers of this type look like they’ve been varnished. They’re a
rich dark red or purple and have many admirers. This is probably
the most sought after form of the Maudiae types. Their solid bur-
gundy to mahogany blossoms shine (see Figure 12-18).
There are many good vinicolor varieties out there — too many to
list. If you’re lucky enough to actually see them in bloom, you can
choose the ones that you like best. Unfortunately, because they’re
popular and are quickly snatched up, you may be forced to pick
out blooming-size plants or ones in bud so you aren’t sure what
they’ll look like when they bloom.
Here are two ways to increase your odds for buying the best:
 Check out their parents. Several orchid parents have a good
reputation for producing high-quality offspring. Here are some
to look for:
• Black Cherry
• Blood Clot (Ugh! What a name!)
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 185

• Eric Meng
• Laser
• Macabre
• Raisin Pie
• Red Fusion
• Red Glory
• Ruby Peacock
 Look at the color of the leaves, flower stem, and bud. The
darker the purple in the newest leaves, the undersides of the
leaves, the flower stem, and the buds, the greater the likeli-
hood that the flower will also carry this dark pigment.
Figure 12-18: A vinicolor 
showing solid dark coloration 
over the entire flower.
Huge and round: Modern 
hybrid lady’s slippers
These lady’s slippers are sometimes called “bulldogs” or “toads.”
To tell you the truth, I don’t know how they got branded with such
odd nicknames! They look nothing like these two creatures to me.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
186

Another moniker for them is complex hybrids, and this makes
sense, because their parentage is very convoluted, many times
consisting of 20 or more parents.
All the orchids in this group have plain green foliage and most of
their flowers are huge and round (see Figure 12-19). They’re basi-
cally categorized by their flower colors: spotted, green, white,
yellow, red, pink, and shades of these colors. A spotted one of mine
that has been a delight is Paphiopedilum Langley Pride ‘Burlingame’
HCC/AOS (see the color photographs in the center of this book for
an illustration).
Figure 12-19: A modern complex hybrid showing its full, round flower.
The whites have been particularly elusive in this quest for perfec-
tion. An older hybrid, Paphiopedilum F.C. Puddle (see Figure 12-20),
doesn’t match many of today’s hybrids in terms of size and shape
but is still in many collections today because it’s a charming
dependable grower and bloomer.
A different kind of slipper orchid
All the slipper orchids that I cover up to this point in this chapter
are tropical ones found in the old-world tropics, mostly various
parts of Asia. Another type of lady’s slipper has been known about
since the 1800s but is now witnessing a strong new interest by
orchid lovers. This group is called phragmipediums or simply
“phrags.”
Chapter 12: Slipper Orchids 187

Phragmipediums call their home Central and South America. Many
grow in the mountains, and number more than 30 species. They
have a similar growth habit to some of the paphiopedilums and
have the same requirements for humidity and temperatures.
Figure 12-20: Paphiopedilum F.C. Puddle is an older white hybrid still 
appreciated today.
Culturally, they have some differences. In general, they like it
wetter than paphiopedilums. In fact, they’re commonly grown in
platters of fresh water. This practice is unheard of with most other
orchids! Also, they prefer more light — similar to cattleyas. These
used to be expensive plants, but their prices have come down
thanks, in part, to Hawaiian growers who have perfected their cul-
ture so they can now be grown to selling-size plants in record-
breaking time.
Most of the flowers are twisted and dangling, are borne sequen-
tially, and are found in shades and stripes of green and maroon.
However, there are some key exceptions. Phragmipedium besseae is
bright red-orange to yellow, Phragmipedium xerophyticum is white
with a touch of pink, and Phragmipedium schlimii (see Figure 12-21
for a hybrid of this species) is a shade of pink as is Phragmipedium
fischeri. But the absolute star of the show is a recently discovered
marvel, Phragmipedium kovachii, with immense 7- to 8-inch (17.5-
to 20-cm) magenta flowers. (See the nearby sidebar for more on
this special plant.)
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
188

Although there has always been interest in the phragmipedium
species, it is the hybrids that everyone its talking about. These
newer hybrids are more vigorous and easy growing then most of
the species and are becoming available in a broad range of colors.
Many new ones are on the horizon but here are a few to look out
for:
 Phragmipedium Andean Fire has attractive dark red 31⁄2-inch
flowers on tall flowering stems.
 Phragmipedium Cardinale is a classic hybrid that reliably
produces many pink flowers.
 Phragmipedium Hanne Popow has delightful small pink flow-
ers and is an old favorite that is still offered and is frequently
used as a parent to produce newer hybrids.
 Phragmipedium Jason Fischer has eye-popping brilliant,
broad, flat red flowers.
 Phragmipedium Les Dirouilles displays huge, spectacular
green, chestnut, and burgundy flowers with long, twisted
petals.
 Phragmipedium Sorcerer’s Apprentice has broad foliage
with very large and dramatic flowers with twisted petals in
shades of green, brown, and burgundy.
Figure 12-21: Phragmipedium ‘Wilcox’ AM/AOS is a lovely hybrid with 
a delicate beauty.

New Phrag creates a scandal!
Phragmipedium kovachii was “discovered” in 2002 at a roadside vendor in northeast
Peru by an American orchid enthusiast, J. Michael Kovach. He immediately recog-
nized it as being exceptional and probably new to the orchid world. Kovach pur-
chased this rare orchid and pirated it back to the United States, illegally, with grand
visions of his name entering the annals of orchid history by having this “holy grail
of orchids” named after him.
He rushed it to the orchid experts at Selby Botanical Garden, one of the world’s
leaders in orchid research, to get it identified, documented, and officially described
in Latin so it could be published in a botanical journal, thereby assuring that the
orchid would be his namesake.
Now the fly in the ointment — the feds. They got word of Kovach’s “discovery” and
orchids hit the fan. Kovach was indicted, and they threatened to fine Selby Botanical
Gardens $100,000 (it was plea-bargained to $5,000 and three years’ probation). Selby
botanists, administrators, and board members’ heads rolled.
Even though it was part of the plea bargain that the name of this orchid be reverted
to an earlier proposed name, Phragmipedium peruviana, most orchid people think
it will most likely never happen.
And the scandal goes on. In the spring of 2004 at a Miami orchid show, a vendor
and orchid grower from Peru, along with another orchid vendor and grower from
Texas, were arrested for selling and smuggling endangered orchids including plants
of Phragmipedium kovachii.
So, as you can see, orchid mania is alive and well today.

T
his group of orchids is referred to as “dancing ladies” because
the lips of many of them are flared like a flounced dancing
gown, and the tops of the flowers, with a little imagination, look
like the arms and head of a person.
Oncidiums are a joyful bunch of orchids that frequently display a
flurry of flowers in the sunny yellow to orange and brown color
range, although there are some in shades of pink, red, and green.
They’ve been popular since they were first introduced into
England from South America in the late 1700s.
Taking a Closer Look at the Ladies
Hundreds of oncidiums are in existence, but just a handful are
grown with regularity today. In general, they can be grown in the
same conditions as cattleyas (see Chapter 5 for more details).
Oncidiums from the wild
Many oncidiums from the wild are used in producing hybrids (see
the following section, “Hybrid oncidiums”). Here are a few species,
among the many that are worth looking for:

 Oncidium amplicatum (see Figure 13-1): When this orchid is
in full bloom in the summer, it displays a shower of 1-inch
(2.5-cm) brilliant yellow flowers on sprays up to 4 feet (120
cm) long. The pseudobulbs are short and circular and are
sometimes referred to as being turtle-shaped.
 Oncidium cheirophorum: This dwarf-growing oncidium 
(it matures to about 3 inches [7.5 cm]) has 1⁄2-inch (1.25-cm)
bright yellow citrus-scented flowers on an arching spray.
 Oncidium crispum: A quite attractive oncidium with 3-inch
(8-cm) rust red flowers and lips with yellow and orange mark-
ings on the lips. The flowers are borne on a long spray and its
leaves get to be about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) long. Its
flowers have a musty scent.
 Oncidium lanceanum: Referred to as a “mule-leaf” orchid
because its stiff leathery foliage takes on this shape, it has
flat, long-lasting 2- to 21⁄2-inch (6-cm) flowers of contrasting
brown and yellow with a purple and white lip. The plant grows
about a foot (30 cm) tall and has a strong honey scent when
the plant is in the sunlight.
 Oncidium longipes (see Figure 13-2): A dwarf-growing
species from Brazil that blooms in the fall. Its cinnamon
scented flowers are 3⁄4 to 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) across with dark
yellow to reddish brown sepals and petals and bright yellow
lips. It frequently blooms twice a year.

shower of flowers.

192

Figure 13-2: Oncidium longipes
is a small-growing plant that is 
perfect for the windowsill.
 Oncidium maculatum: This is a handsome species with 3-inch
(8-cm) honey-scented yellow flowers prominently marked with
mahogany spots on an arched 20-inch (50-cm) flower spike. It
blooms best if it’s grown on the dry side during the winter.
 Oncidium onustum (see Figure 13-3): Clear yellow flowers
about 11⁄4 inches (3 cm) wide cover this miniature plant when
it’s in bloom in the fall. It likes very bright light and should be
grown on the dry side, especially right after flowering.
Figure 13-3: Oncidium onustum 
is a miniature grower with lemon 
yellow flowers.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 193

 Oncidium ornithorhynchum: This is one of my favorites! 
It’s a miniature, easy-to-grow, and easy-to-flower orchid and
rewards you with scads of 3⁄4-inch (1.5-cm) flowers with pink to
lavender blooms that have a fresh vanilla fragrance. The plant
only grows 8 to 10 inches (20 to 22.5 cm), so it’s perfect for a
windowsill or under lights. It frequently blooms a few times a
year.
 Oncidium splendidum: This oncidium is splendid, indeed.
From Guatemala and Honduras, this stately upright flower
spike is 3 feet (1 meter) or more and is covered with 2- to 3-
inch (5- to 7.5-cm) flowers that feature a broad bright yellow
lip. Give this species a bright spot with plenty of growing
room and let it dry off during the winter.
Hybrid oncidiums
As is the case with the other orchids mentioned in this book, there
are many hybrids of oncidiums. The orchid breeders have
extended the color range and ease of blooming with these hybrids:
 Oncidium Sharry Baby (see Figure 13-4): This is one of the
most popular orchids in the world! This particular variety out-
sells all the other orchids. Why? The number-one reason is that
it has a very strong fragrance of chocolate or vanilla. It also
blooms more than once a year, often around Christmastime. A
mature plant has hundreds of 1⁄2-inch (1.5-cm) yellow-overlaid-
with-burgundy flowers with a flared white lip with purple mark-
ings. It’s a bone-tough plant that will grow when others wimp
out. My neighbor has one that I gave her and, with very little
TLC, it performs dependably every year. This variety is avail-
able in many different color forms. As long as you have space
for this one (it can grow over 30 inches [75 cm] tall), you can’t
go wrong buying one.
 Oncidium Twinkles: This is another star performer but with a
quite different stature from Sharry Baby. It’s parents, Oncidium
cheirophorum and Oncidium ornithrhynchum, both mentioned
earlier in this chapter, are fragrant and dwarf. The resultant
crossing is a hybrid that is even better than its parents —
more vigorous and free flowering. This one is highly recom-
mended for beginners. It’s available in various color forms.
 Oncidium Tsiku Marguerite: A very vigorous but small-growing
(about 6 inches [15 cm] tall) hybrid that is sweet-scented. It pro-
duces densely branched sprays of 3⁄4-inch (2-cm) cream to pink
flowers. Another great beginner’s orchid.

194

 Oncidium Nathakhum: This is a larger-growing oncidium with
foliage up to about 12 inches (30 cm) long. It shows much influ-
ence from one of it parents, Oncidium lanceanum, with its
mule-ear foliage and its flat, honey-scented, long-lasting flow-
ers of contrasting brown and yellow with a yellow lip.
Figure 13-4: Oncidium Sharry Baby is a fast and easy growing and 
blooming Oncidium hybrid with the fragrance of chocolate.
Miniature oncidiums or tolumnia
Until fairly recently, the miniature plants that look very much like
oncidiums were called equitant (or variegata). Plant taxonomists
(people who name plants) are now in a huddle to decide whether
or not these plants should be assigned to the genus tolumnia
rather than oncidium.
Whatever name you want to call them, they’re darling little plants
that are easy to grow. They have triangular thick leaves and are
grown best in a sunny spot with good air movement. They’re often
mounted on wood or cork (see Chapter 7) but can also be grown 
in pots. Because they’re small plants in small containers (see
Figure 13-5), you must keep an eye on them so they don’t dry 
out too severely.
Many of these orchids bloom a few times a year and will flower
more than once on the same flower spike, so don’t cut off the
flower spike until it withers.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 195

So many hybrids are available within this group that choosing one
over another is difficult. Just look in the orchid suppliers’ catalogs,
on their Web sites, or in their greenhouses in the miniature orchid
or miniature oncidium or tolumnia section. They’re all easy grow-
ers and prolific bloomers (see Figure 13-6).
Figure 13-5: Equitant oncidiums require little space to grow and bloom. 
This one is in a 3-inch pot.
Figure 13-6: Even though the equitants are small plants, they have quite 
a bit of flower power, as this pink and red hybrid proves.

Pansy Orchids: Miltonias 
and Miltoniopsis
To see these orchids in bloom is to want them. True to their name,
many of these orchids do have pansylike faces, but they actually
outdo the other garden plants with their colors and flower pat-
terns. For some reason, these orchids haven’t gotten their due
attention for many years. They had a reputation for being difficult
to grow. Most of the newer selections and hybrids are more vigor-
ous, easy, and worth your effort to try.
It used to be that all the orchids in this group were called milto-
nias, but now most go by miltoniopsis. For more details on this
name game, see the nearby sidebar.
These orchids have a flower structure similar to oncidiums. 
Figure 13-7 shows the miltonia flower structure.
Here are some guidelines that will help you have more success
with these beauties:
 Miltonias like it a little warmer than miltoniopsis. Miltonias
like it up to about 84°F (29°C) during the day and around 55°F
(12.8°C) during the evening. Miltoniopsis like it about 5°F to
10°F cooler for day and night temperatures.
 Keep their roots damp but not wet. Their fine root systems
can easily be damaged by drying out. The catch-22 is that
they can also be very susceptible to rotting if kept too wet.
Use a fine-textured, well-drained potting material that also
retains moisture.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 197
One person’s weed is another’s treasure
Goodale Moir is a well-known name in the annals of orchid breeding. He dared to
love a group of oncidiums called equitants or variegata oncidiums. At the time, in the
1950s, many of his less-enlightened orchid-breeding friends derided these minia-
tures from the Caribbean as “weeds.” This didn’t stop Goodale from pursuing his
dream of breeding and developing these lovelies into small orchids of all colors and
shades. While I was working at a botanical garden in Hawaii, in the 1970s, I was
fortunate enough to meet him and his lovely wife, May, as his work was starting to
be appreciated. Sadly, today, Goodale is no longer with us, but he left behind his
proud legacy of these miniature horticultural gems.

Figure 13-7: Miltonia flower structure:
1 = Sepals; 2 = Petals; 3 = Lip; 4 = Column.
 If the leaves pucker in an accordion pattern, this is a sign
the plant is not getting enough moisture.
 Keep these plants in small pots. This is an easy way to pre-
vent overwatering.
 If the leaves are light green and standing upright, they’re
getting just the right amount of light. If they’re floppy and
dark green, they’re getting too little light. If they have a red-
dish cast, they’re getting too much light.
 Provide ample air circulation. Otherwise, their thin leaves
will get leaf spots from fungal disease.
Miltonias
Here are a few miltonias that are particularly striking and easy to
grow:
 Miltonia flavescens: The light yellow color of the flower sets
this species off from the other miltonias. Its flowers are about
3 inches (7.5 cm) across and have a white lip with red spots.
 Miltonia regnellii: This is one of the most adaptable so it’s
one of the easiest of the miltonias to grow and bloom. For
each erect stem, it has up to six white flowers that are about
21⁄2 to 3 inches (6 to 7.5 cm) across with a purple-blue lip. It
blooms in the summer to fall and has an orangelike fragrance.

 Miltonia spectabilis: One of the most popular and commonly
offered miltonia species, it displays 4-inch-wide (10-cm-wide)
flowers that are white tinged with pink. The lip is rose-pink
with a purple column. This orchid grows to about 10 inches
(25 cm) high and its flowers have a rosy fragrance. Another
botanical variety, Miltonia spectabilis var. moreliana, has flow-
ers of the same size but its sepals and petals are dark plum
red with a contrasting large, bright rose-pink lip with darker
veins. It is quite a looker!
 Miltonia Goodale Moir: A classic variety that is a namesake
of a famous orchid breeder who lived in Hawaii, this miltonia
hybrid likes warmer growing conditions and bears striking
flowers with yellow petals spotted in burgundy and white lips
brushed with a purple pink. Miltonia Goodale Moir is still fre-
quently used as a parent to produce other warmth-loving mil-
tonia hybrids.
 Miltonia Anne Warne: This is another time-proven, warmth-
loving hybrid with gorgeous dark purple flowers with stunning
purple-pink lips.
Miltoniopsis
Some have said that that miltoniopsis can be more difficult to grow
than miltonias, but it really matters which ones you get. Some
species like it cooler and others tolerate warmer conditions. The
hybrids seem to be very forgiving and easy. Many hybrids have
spectacular markings, like the newer one shown in Figure 13-8.
Figure 13-8: A white miltoniopsis 
hybrid with striking purple markings.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 199

Here are some others that should be on your list:
 Miltoniopsis phalaenopsis: This species is the one primarily
responsible for the “waterfall” patterns in the lips of today’s
hybrids. It likes warm summers and cool winters and does
best if it’s kept on the dry side during the winter. Its flower,
which has the perfume of lily of the valley, is 13⁄4 inches (4 cm)
and white pansy-shaped with a purple waterfall pattern on the
lip. The plant reaches about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) high.
 Miltoniopsis roezlii: A cool to warm grower, this is another
one of the easier-to-grow miltoniopsis. It has 21⁄2-inch-wide (6.5-
cm-wide) white rose-scented flowers with dark-purple spots on
each of the petals and a white lip with bright yellow and orange
markings. The plant reaches about 9 inches (22 cm) tall.
 Miltoniopsis santanaei (see Figure 13-9): This is a very
rewarding plant that is easy to grow and flower, which it often
does more than once a year. Its flower is 2 inches (5 cm) wide,
pristine white, flat, pansy-shaped with a bright yellow flare on
the top of the lip. It’s a compact-growing orchid — only 6 to 8
inches (15 to 20 cm) tall. It has a very sweet rose scent and is
used frequently in breeding for this fragrant quality and its
ease of culture.
 Miltoniopsis Bert Field: Pure velvety red, this hybrid’s flow-
ers are about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. They’re perfectly
formed and some have waterfall patterns. It’s a classic variety
that is still found and is used often as a parent.
 Miltoniopsis Celle ‘Wasserfall’ (see Figure 13-10): There are
many new hybrid miltonias, but this was one of the first to
show such a spectacular “waterfall” pattern in the lip. Its red
velvet sepals and petals and yellow column complete a gor-
geous picture. The flowers have a rosy floral scent.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
200
You say miltonia; I say miltoniopsis
The technical difference between these two is that all those orchids called milto-
nias have two, light green leaves per pseudobulb and “ears” on the column, in the
center part of the flower. Miltoniopsis have one blue-green leaf per pseudobulb.
Unless you’re a taxonomist, the flowers look the same.
From a cultural point of view, miltonias are considered by some to be somewhat
easier to grow because they’re from Brazil, where it’s warmer, while most of the
miltoniopsis are from the cooler climes of Peru, Columbia, and Costa Rica so they
can be more temperamental.

Figure 13-9: Miltoniopsis santanaei is a compact, easy-to-grow 
species well suited to growing on a windowsill or under lights.
Figure 13-10: Miltoniopsis Celle ‘Wasserfall’ is definitely a showstopper.
 Miltoniopsis Hajime Ono: Named after the noted Hawaiian
miltoniopsis breeder, Hajime Ono, it has a magnificent 31⁄2-inch-
wide (9-cm-wide) dark-red velvety flower with a lip fantasti-
cally marked with a waterfall pattern. See the color section of
photographs for an example.
 Miltoniopsis Hamburg: This is another famous cross that set
the standard for quite a while for being one of the best of the
solid reds. It has a light rosy fragrance.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 201

Other Members of the Club: 
The Oncidium Alliance
Many other orchids are related to oncidiums, and they’re com-
monly referred to as being part of the Oncidium Alliance. In the 
following sections, I list some of the more prominent ones.
Orchid spiders: Brassias
Large flowers with long, leggy petals and sepals typify this group 
of orchids. Although some of the species and hybrids of brassias
are popular, they are more commonly used as parents with other
oncidium relatives to pass on their elegant flower shapes (see
“Mixing It Up,” later in this chapter). Here are a few standouts of
the 15 or so species of brassias:
 Brassia longissima (see Figure 13-11): This orchid features
large spidery flowers about 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 cm) from
top to bottom that open greenish and turn orange over sev-
eral days. The flowers are spotted maroon and have a sweet,
candy scent. This is a tall grower that maxes out at about 30
inches (75 cm) tall.
 Brassia maculata: A commonly grown species, this orchid
also follows the similar flower shape and color pattern of the
other two species described in this list. It blooms in the
summer and puts on a show of fragrant flowers for several
weeks.
 Brassia verrucosa: Another spider-type flower that reaches
about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) across, this orchid is pale
green and is spotted in darker green or brown with a white lip
spotted with darker warts. This species is an easy one to
grow. It has a musky scent.
Butterfly orchids: Psychopsis
This orchid used to be called an oncidium and then was reclassi-
fied to this genus. It doesn’t take much imagination to see how this
orchid got its common name, butterfly orchid, because the flower
looks very much like this regal insect.
Psychopsis papilio (shown in Figure 13-12) is the most popular
species in the genus and is an easy one to grow, requiring the same
cultural conditions as oncidiums. Psychopsis papilio has reddish
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
202

leathery leaves with darker spots; its flowers have thin, dark bur-
gundy, upright sepals that look like antennae; the petals are barred
dark red on yellow; and the lip is yellow with solid or spotted bur-
gundy red edging. Another species, Psychopsis krameriana, is very
similar.
Figure 13-11: Brassia longissima is a fine selection of this species.
The flowers are borne in succession, so don’t cut off the flower
spike until it shrivels.
Figure 13-12: Psychopsis papilio has a butterfly look.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 203

Sigmatostalix
Sigmatostalix radicans (shown in Figure 13-13) is a dainty and
charming miniature orchid, reaching about 6 inches (15 cm). It has
grasslike foliage and small 3⁄4-inch (1 cm) white flowers with green-
ish sepals and petals with a brown column and white lip. Its flow-
ers have a sweet honey fragrance.
Figure 13-13: Sigmatostalix radicans is a miniature orchid with a 
honey scent.
Trichopilia
Two orchids within the trichopilia genus are commonly grown:
 Trichopilia suavis: A native of Central and South America,
this orchid has oblong pseudobulbs with leaves that can grow
up to 16 inches (40 cm) long. It’s frequently grown in a basket

Not for beginners
The Oncidium Alliance has other genera — including baptisonia, cochlioda, com-
parettia, odontoglossum, rodriguezia, and trichocentrum — but many are not noted
for being easy to grow. Some are from cooler climates and require very high humid-
ity. They have, however, played important roles as genetic building blocks to pro-
duce hybrids with all the other oncidium group. See the “Mixing It Up” section for
more details.

because the two to five fragrant flowers, white spotted with
red, are borne on a pendulous flower spike. The lips of the
flowers are tubular and have pink and orange spots.
 Trichopilia fragrans: This orchid is very similar to the pre-
ceding one and blooms in the spring to summer.
Mixing It Up
Now things really get interesting! Imagine taking all the orchids
that I introduce in this chapter from the Oncidium Alliance, and
many more that I haven’t even mentioned, and mating or breeding
them with each other. This is just what has been done by skillful
orchid breeders in the United States — and the results have been
astounding!
Knowing where to begin is difficult, because there are so many dif-
ferent ones. By the late 1990s, almost 10,000 of these hybrids had
been registered and breeding efforts have continued at full tilt, so
today there are many more.
In general, these are orchids with wild color combinations and large
flower counts that are durable, vigorous plants. These new hybrids
are starting to compete with phalaenopsis for the public’s favor.
These hybrids have a scrambled parentage. To help you sort
through it all, Table 13-1 is a list of some of the most common and
popular intergeneric genera (ones that have parents from more
than one genus) along with the genera that were used to actually
produce these new intergeneric genera. The abbreviations for the
genera are also given, because this will usually be what you’ll find
written on the orchid label.

Orchid breeders hybridizing these related orchids are working to
impart the following qualities to their plants:
 More-compact growth and flowering habit
 Ease of flowering
 More tolerance for a wide range of growing temperatures
 Lower light requirements
 Blooming multiple times per year
 Bright, colorful patterns in the flowers
When you visit your orchid grower, check out orchid supplier Web
sites, or go to orchid shows, you’ll see that today’s hybrids in this
group are moving closer and closer to meeting these breeding
objectives.
Because this group is so huge, I’ve tried to hit on some of the most
popular in this group. This is only the tip of the iceberg:
 Beallara Marfitch ‘Howard’s Dream’ (see Figure 13-14): This
orchid has dazzling, large, deep burgundy flowers on upright
flower spikes with white markings and a dash of yellow on the
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies

lip. These are always the plants people stop to admire at the
orchid shows.
 Beallara Tacoma Glacier: This is found in various forms but
most have very large frilly flowers with red markings.
 Brassidium Fly Away ‘Miami’ HCC/AOS (see Figure 13-15):
These bright yellow flowers are borne in huge numbers and
look like they are taking off in flight.
Figure 13-14: Beallara Marfitch 
‘Howard’s Dream’ is always the center 
of attention when it’s in bloom.
Figure 13-15: The flowers of 
Brassidium Fly Away ‘Miami’ 
HCC/AOS have masses of 
flowers on long flower spikes.
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 207

 Burrageara Stefan Isler: This orchid has upright stems with
many brilliant red flowers with a lighter color lip. It is free
flowering and will bloom more than once a year when the
plant is mature.
 Colmanara Wildcat (see Figure 13-16): There are many dif-
ferent selections of this orchid, but they are all very bright
yellow, waxy flowers about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across with very
distinct yellow or maroon markings, and a lip that is usually
very dark red and marked with yellow. It’s quite a standout.
Figure 13-16: Colmanara Wildcat has dramatic feline markings on a 
waxy long-lasting flower.
 Degarnoara Winter Wonderland ‘White Fantasy’ (see Figure
13-17): Many selections of this orchid are available, but they
look very similar. They have large white flowers and lip with
sepals that extend slightly backward. The lip and petal are
lightly spotted in red. The flower is said to have the fragrance
of bananas. An established plant will bloom a few times a year
 Milpasia Milt’s Choice ‘Helen of Troy’: Long-lasting yellow
with rose to maroon stripes on the petals with a large white
lip are the features of this orchid. It grows about 10 to 12
inches (25 to 30 cm) tall and has a rosy fragrance.
 Miltassia hybrids: Most of this group are usually strongly
marked and brightly colored. See the color section for an
example.
 Miltonidium Bartley Schwartz (see Figure 13-18): Several dif-
ferent forms of this are available, but most have upright spikes
of many red to purple flowers with white lips marked in red.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
208

Figure 13-17: Degarnoara Winter Wonderland 
‘White Fantasy’ has a unique blend of lip shape 
similar to miltonia, longer petals like brassia, 
and wider flowers like odontoglossum.
 Miltonidium Issaku Nagata ‘Volcano Queen’ HCC/AOS: An
easy orchid with many 11⁄2-inch (4-cm) flowers on tall multi-
branched spikes. The petals and sepals are yellow overlaid
with mahogany. The flared lip is white at the bottom and red
and purple at the top. The foliage can grow 18 to 24 inches 
(45 to 60 cm) tall and the flowers have a light floral fragrance.
 Odontioda Margarete Holm ‘Alpine’: A gorgeous full-bodied
white flower with clear burgundy markings. See the color sec-
tion of photographs for an example.
 Odontioda Vespa ‘Charm’ (see Figure 13-19): This is a capti-
vating, very compact orchid that only grows 6 to 8 inches 
(15 to 20 cm) tall. It displays 21⁄2-inch (6.5-cm) white, citrus-
scented flowers that are decorated with distinct purple and
red markings on the petals and sepals with yellow on the
throat. I love this one!
Chapter 13: Dancing Ladies: Oncidiums and Their Relatives 209

Figure 13-18: Miltonidium
Bartley Schwartz comes in 
many forms, but all have many 
red to purple flowers on an 
upright flower spike.
Figure 13-19: Odontioda Vespa ‘Charm’ is a favorite because of its 
compact habit and colorful flower markings.
 Odontobrassia Fangtastic Bob Henley: Seventy-five percent
of this hybrid’s lineage is from brassias, so it has characteris-
tically spidery yellow flowers that are 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13
cm) across with maroon markings and yellow lips on arching
flower spikes.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
210

 Odontocidium Crowborough: This hybrid is another one of the
earlier crosses that is still available today and is used plenty as
a parent for newer hybrids. It has 3-inch (7.5-cm), bright yellow,
thick-textured flowers with distinct mahogany markings.
 Odontocidium Tiger Crow ‘Golden Girls’ HCC/AOS: An off-
spring of famous parents, Odontocidium Tiger Hambuhren and
Odontocidium Crowborough, it shows off 21⁄2-inch (6.5-cm)
golden-yellow flowers with maroon spots and a bright yellow
lip. The plant grows about 18 inches (45 cm) tall and the flow-
ers have a light floral scent. See the color section of photo-
graphs for an example.
 Vuylstekeara Cambria ‘Plush’ FCC/AOS (see Figure 13-20):
This is a classic variety and was one of the first of these inter-
generics to hit the market in a big way. Its many flowers are a
clear dark red, tipped in white with a red-and-white edge lip.
This variety has stood the test of time.
Figure 13-20: Vuylstekeara
Cambria ‘Plush’ FCC/AOS has 
proven itself to be a winner.
 Vuylstekeara Yokara ‘Perfection’: This is a dazzler! Its light
burgundy flowers sparkle with bright white patterns through-
out. A yellow highlight appears on the lip. See the color sec-
tion for an example.
 Wilsonara Tiger Brew: A free flowering and branching plant
that has flowers with sepals and petals that are light yellow
and spotted with burgundy and a lip that is lemon yellow with
reddish spots. The edges of the petals and sepals are touched
in red and fringed.

In This Chapter
 Discovering one of the biggest of all groups of orchids: Dendrobiums
 Finding orchids that are as weird as they get: Bulbophyllums
 Considering some other orchids
I
n the previous chapters, I present you with some of the largest
orchid groups that are most suitable for home orchid growing.
But, as you can imagine, with tens of thousands of different orchids
out there, some additional ones in other groups are also prime can-
didates. In this chapter, I give you a glimpse at some of them.
A Huge and Interesting 
Lot: Dendrobiums
Dendrobiums and their close relatives number more than a thou-
sand. They call their homes the old-world tropics, which include
New Guinea and the exotic land down under, Australia. Some of
these orchids have exacting cultural requirements that are a chal-
lenge to provide. The ones I show you here are the easier ones 
that have basically the same cultural requirements as cattleyas —
medium to high light, modest humidity, and intermediate tempera-
tures. Many of the dendrobiums naturally undergo a drier winter
than summer, so they appreciate the same treatment from you.
Some are evergreen (keeping their foliage year-round), while others
are deciduous (dropping their leaves in the fall) as they enter a rest
for the winter, then put out their new growth in the spring.
The most popular dendrobiums
Here is a small selection of some of the easiest and most readily
found dendrobiums that are not very demanding. As you become
familiar with this huge group of plants, you’ll surely find others
you’d like to try out.

Dendrobium phalaenopsis
Although the more proper name for this orchid is Dendrobium bigib-
bum, it rarely goes by this in the trade. I list this one first because 
it is by far the most popular and commonly found dendrobium.
Luckily, it is also one of the least expensive and easiest to grow.
Hybrids of this type are found in an impressive array of color com-
binations and are usually about 11⁄2 to 3 inches (3 to 7 cm) across
and look much like phalaenopsis flowers (thus, the species name of
phalaenopsis). Figure 14-1 shows an example of a Dendrobium pha-
laenopsis. The most common flower colors are white, shades of
pink, and purple, but some of the newer offerings have contrasting
sepals, petals, and lips in a whole range of pastels.
Figure 14-1: The Dendrobium phalaenopsis flower looks much like a 
phalaenopsis orchid (see Chapter 10).
Dendrobium phalaenopsis, which are evergreens, differ dramati-
cally in their growth habits — some are very compact, about 6
inches (15 cm) tall while others can reach 3 feet (1 meter) or more
in height (see Figure 14-2).
Like most dendrobiums, the Dendrobium phalaenopsis prefers to be
pot-bound, so it’s content to stay in a small container. It requires a
modest drying-off period during the winter and early spring to pro-
mote flowering. You can resume regular watering when new growth
appears in the spring until after flowering.
Dendrobium phalaenopsis hybrids, sometimes referred to as “cane”
Dendrobiums because of their upright stems, can vary tremen-
dously in their growth habits from dwarfs to giants. Figure 14-2
shows one of the larger forms.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
214

Figure 14-2: A larger Dendrobium 
phalaenopsis hybrid.
Dendrobium nobile
Another one of the most popular dendrobiums, the Dendrobium
nobile (shown in Figure 14-3) has been hybridized extensively so
that today’s varieties come in a carnival of bright colors.
The Dendrobium nobile is deciduous, so when winter approaches,
keep it on the dry side. Only water it enough to keep its pseudo-
bulbs from shriveling. Let the evening temperatures get down
around 50°F to 55°F (10°C to 13°C).
Figure 14-3: Dendrobium nobile var. virginale is a white form of this 
popular dendrobium.
Chapter 14: Significant Others 215

Some people have described the fragrance of these orchids as
being like honey or musk during the day and mown hay at night.
Dendrobium kingianum
This dendrobium is wonderfully tough — it can withstand tempera-
tures down to 35°F (1.6°C) — and easy to grow, and it’s just start-
ing to get its due. This Australian native was once considered a
“weed” among some orchid growers, because it is such a rapid
grower. Now it’s getting new respect as more people are becoming
aware of how easy and forgiving it is to grow and bloom and as
many new flower color forms are appearing.
The usual flower is small, up to about 1 to 11⁄2 inches (2.5 to 4 cm),
in shades of pink, borne in 8-inch (20-cm) sprays of about a dozen
flowers (see Figure 14-4). The newer selections include dark
purple, purple-blue, white, striped, and a whole range of combina-
tions of these. This orchid varies considerable in its growth habit
from a few inches (5 cm) to almost 16 inches (50 cm) tall.
This orchid has a range of fragrances from hyacinth to lilac to
honey.
Dendrobium kingianum requires a dry, cool winter to bloom
dependably. It’s an evergreen orchid that has attractive compact,
thick, dark green foliage. It readily forms keikis (baby plants); refer
to Chapter 8 to see how to handle them.
Figure 14-4: Dendrobium kingianum has small crystalline flowers that 
are found in various shades of purple and pink.

Some other Dendrobiums 
worth considering
After you’ve cut your teeth on the easier dendrobiums mentioned
in the previous section, try some of these:
 Dendrobium aggregatum: This orchid and its cousin,
Dendrobium jenkensii (shown in Figure 14-5) are dwarf plants
that produce showers of 1-inch (2.5-cm) golden yellow, honey-
scented flowers with broad, almost heart-shaped lips. The
flowers appear in groups of two or three for Dendrobium
jenkensii, more for Dendrobium aggregatum, in the spring. The
pseudobulbs are small, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). These
plants are frequently grown on slabs and are best not trans-
planted or divided often. They make their most spectacular
display when they become large-sized plants.
 Dendrobium bellatulum: This is another miniature plant
only reaching about 4 inches (10 cm) tall with one to three 
11⁄2-inch (4-cm) white flowers with orange and red markings in
the lip. The flowers have a fresh lemon fragrance.
 Dendrobium chrysotoxum: This orchid has butter-yellow,
pineapple- or mango-scented, 1-inch (2.5-cm) flowers with
fringed lips and a darker orange throat that are displayed on 
a 12-inch (30-cm) flower spike (see Figure 14-6). The plant is
evergreen and a compact grower.
Figure 14-5: Dendrobium jenkensii is a miniature grower that blooms 
best if it’s transplanted very infrequently.
Chapter 14: Significant Others 217

Figure 14-6: Dendrobium chrysotoxum produces sprays of golden 
flowers with the scent of tropical fruit.
 Dendrobium loddigesii: This is a compact grower that
reaches about 6 inches (15 cm) tall. It’s covered in the spring
with 2-inch (5-cm) light-pink flowers with light-yellow lips 
that last about three weeks. It has a rambling habit, so it’s
most suited for mounting on a slab (see Chapter 7 for more
information).
 Dendrobium scabrilingue: This miniature, growing only 
3 to 5 inches (8 to 15 cm) high, has been in bloom for me for
months! Its starry white 1-inch (2.5-cm) flowers have a touch
of light yellow in the center with a pleasant sweet fragrance
that reminds me of the white paste we used to use in elemen-
tary school for our art projects.
 Dendrobium lawesii: This is a screamer from the jungles of
New Guinea with 1-inch (2.5-cm) bright red-orange, waxy flow-
ers, tipped in yellow that are borne on leafless stems. It’s found
in several color forms and its floral brilliance and sweet scent
make it in high demand. It needs a drier rest period during the
winter. See the color photographs in the center of this book for
an example.
Thousands of dendrobium hybrids exist, but many of them are
best suited for a very cool greenhouse. In the following list, I focus
on a few that are particularly easy and are a reasonable size to
handle:
 Dendrobium André Millar (frequently misspelled “Miller”):
Exotic green 11⁄2-inch (4-cm) flowers, with lips prominently
veined in dark maroon, make this orchid a standout (see
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
218

Figure 14-7). It apparently comes in two forms: one very com-
pact, about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) tall, and the other
about twice or more this height. So if plant size is important
to you, be sure to ask which form you’re buying.
Figure 14-7: Dendrobium André Millar has flowers that have an almost 
alien look.
 Dendrobium Iki: A great miniature that rarely grows higher
than 7 inches (20 cm), this orchid has attractive dark green,
glossy, evergreen foliage and charming 1-inch (2.5-cm) creamy
white flowers with red and orange in the lip. It has the sweet
fragrance of licorice.
 Dendrobium Jesmond Gem: This dendrobium is merely repre-
sentative of the many new hybrids that are coming into the
United States from Australia. They’re usually tough plants that
can survive temperatures approaching freezing and, in fact, will
usually bloom best if given a very cold period in the neighbor-
hood of 40°F to 49°F (4°C to 8°C). If you have a very cool bright
spot, be on the lookout for these fine hybrids. Jesmond Gem
has pristine white, 2-inch (5-cm) sweet-smelling flowers with
purple specks on the lips and yellow stripes down the center of
the lips. It grows about 18 inches (45 cm) tall.
Weird and Wonderful Relatives:
Bulbophyllum
One of the many great aspects of the orchid world is that, with
their seemingly countless species and hybrids, there is an orchid
Chapter 14: Significant Others 219

out there that meets absolutely anyone’s fancy! For those who
pursue the bizarre, otherworldly, and sometimes malodorous, bul-
bophyllums fill the bill perfectly. You have to see (or smell) these
oddities to believe that they could exist. Many are carrion flowers,
ones that smell like rotting meat; this is to attract their primary
pollinators, various types of flies. Here are a few of the outstanding
ones that are not particularly difficult to grow:
 Bulbophyllum beccarii: Contrary to the other orchids in this
book, this one is very difficult to grow, but I simply had to let
you know about it because it is the “grande stinko” of the
orchid world. This orchid is described as smelling like “100
dead elephants rotting in the sun.” This is not one you want 
to have in your living room! It’s considered to be one of the
most spectacular bulbophyllums, if you can stand the stench.
Its leaves grow up to 2 feet (60 cm), so it’s usually grown
mounted, and it has small brown flowers with a purple blush.
 Bulbophyllum echinolabium: Displaying a dramatic flower
that can be 1 foot (30 cm) or more long, this bulbophyllum 
has a dark-cream flower with mahogany stripes. It’s a compact
grower of about 6 to 8 inches (10 to 15 cm) tall (see Figure 14-8).
 Bulbophyllum odoratissimum: A miniature bulbophyllum
that grows to about 3 inches (8 cm), this orchid has petite
flowers of a dozen or more. The flowers are yellow with a red-
dish brown lip and actually smell pleasant.
 Bulbophyllum lobbii: A jasmine-scented species, this orchid
is referred to as the “Queen of Bulbophyllums.” The 3- to 4-
inch (7.5- to 10-cm) yellow flowers with purple mottling are
borne singly. The leaves are spatula-shaped and about 12
inches (30 cm) long.
 Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis: This is another stinker. It has
huge leaves up to 4 to 6 feet (120 to 180 cm) long, shaped like
those of phalaenopsis (thus, the species name). Its flowers are
dark red with yellow protuberances. This huge plant is really
only happy in a greenhouse. See the “Being stinky has its
rewards” sidebar for more information.
 Bulbophyllum rothschildianum: One of the most spectacu-
lar of the bulbophyllums, this orchid has five or six flowers in a
cluster. Each flower is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and 7 inches
(17.5 cm) long. The flowers have yellow bases covered with
dark red and darker maroon lips. The plants grow about 12
inches (30 cm) high (see Figure 14-9).

Orchid Miscellanea: All the Rest
Having to give the rest of these fascinating orchids such little cov-
erage is a shame, but with so many orchids and so little space. . . .
In the following sections, I give very brief introductions to some
example plants in other genera that deserve your attention.
Catasetum
Looking closely at the shape of its showy flowers, you can see how
the catasetum got tagged with its common name: Monkey Goblet.
Many hybrids of this orchid are available, and they’re relatively
easy to grow.
Catasetums are deciduous orchids, which means they like to be
watered and fertilized copiously when they’re in active growth,
and then kept on the dry side during the winter — stop watering
for four to six weeks — until they start new growth in the spring.
Catasetum Orchidglade was the first commercial catasetum hybrid.
This selection has up to 15 2-inch (5-cm) creamy white, thick, waxy
flowers that are covered with red freckles. It has a spicy fragrance
and, like other catasetums, is usually grown in a basket. It prefers
rapid drainage; the flowers are borne on pendulous sprays at the
bottom of the plant (see Figure 14-10).
Cochleanthes
This is a beguiling genus of orchids that is starting to get more
exposure. Cochleanthes have very attractive glossy green foliage,
usually bloom more than once a year, are easy to grow (preferring
the same growing conditions as phalaenopsis), and have exotic
flowers.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
222
Being stinky has its rewards
At the highly prestigious 2004 New York International Orchid Show, a gigantic
mounted specimen of Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis shared the top honor with one
other orchid to be Co-Grand Champion and also received a Certificate of Cultural
Excellence from The American Orchid Society. This plant was said to be valued at
thousands of dollars!

Figure 14-10: Catasetum Orchidglade has 
pendulous flowers and pleated foliage typical 
of catasetums.
Cochleanthes amazonica has white, 2-inch (5-cm), rose- or candy-
scented flowers with vivid dark purple veins on the impressive
flared lip. A hybrid of this species, called Amazing, has very simi-
lar, but somewhat larger flowers (see the color photographs in the
center of this book for an example). The plant grows about 8
inches tall.
Be sure to keep the potting material damp or the leaves will
become pleated.
Cochleanthes discolor is another fine species that has 2-inch (5-cm)
cream-colored flowers with a mauve cupped lip. It grows about 8
inches (20 cm) tall and has a cedar or candy fragrance.
Cochleanthes Moliere is a hybrid of Cochleanthes amazonica and
Cochleanthes discolor. It is a marriage with a spectacular result: 2-
inch (5-cm) flowers with white petals tipped with pink, and a huge,
contrasting, dramatic purple lip.
Chapter 14: Significant Others 223

Coelogyne
A genus of about 100 species found in Asia, coelogyne orchids are
usually fragrant. Most of them do best in medium to high light in
intermediate temperatures; some from mountainous areas like it
cooler. Most of them grow and look best when they’re permitted 
to grow to a large size, not divided.
Coelogyne cristata is one of the popular species of this group. It dis-
plays white, banana-scented flowers that are about 3 inches (8 cm)
wide with a white lip with yellow markings.
Because of its rambling habit, Coelogyne cristata is best grown into
a large plant in a basket or mounted (see Figure 14-11). Coelogyne
intermedia has white fruity-scented flowers with a yellow throat and
grows to about 8 inches (20 cm) tall. Coelogyne intermedia should
be kept on the damp side, or the foliage will become pleated.
Figure 14-11: Coelogyne cristata makes a beautiful sight as a large, 
well-grown plant.
Cymbidiums
Cymbidiums are popular as corsage orchids because they last 
for such a long time, even after they’ve been cut from the plant.
Thanks to modern orchid breeding, these orchids are now avail-
able in a vast array of colors — some with markings on the lips,
others with totally clear flowers and lips. The ones that most
people are familiar with are the “standard” cymbidiums.
Part III: The Best Orchids for Rookies 
224

A full-size plant in complete flower is a jaw dropper. However, these
plants can get 2 to 4 feet (60 to 120 cm) or more tall and wide —
they’re serious space hogs. Also, some of the standard varieties
require very cool and bright conditions for them to perform at their
best.
The most common complaint of amateur cymbidium growers is
that the plants grow fine, but they don’t flower. If this sounds famil-
iar, you’re probably giving your cymbidium too little light or not
giving it the cool evening temperature of 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C)
that it needs in order to trigger the formation of flower buds.
Newer, more-compact plants with a warmer temperature tolerance
are appearing all the time, so life for the hobbyist cymbidium lover
is getting easier. These smaller plants are referred to as “miniature,”
but be aware that this is a relative term. “Miniature” cymbidiums
still reach about 2 feet (60 cm) tall but can be managed in a 6- to 8-
inch (15- to 20-cm) pot.
Standard cymbidium hybrids are very popular as outside orchids
in mild areas like Southern California. They’re grown successfully
in many places as long as they have enough light, cool evenings,
and space. The newer ones, such as Cymbidium Solana Rose
(shown in Figure 14-12), have very full, round flowers.
Figure 14-12: Cymbidium Solana Rose is a soft pink standard variety 
that exemplifies the new hybrid cymbidiums with large round flowers 
in pastel shades.
Cymbidium Golden Elf is a 21⁄2-inch (6-cm) clear bright-yellow-flowered
miniature variety with four to six flowers per spike. Its size is more
manageable for most home growers. This one can bloom several
Chapter 14: Significant Others 225

times a year and is more tolerant of warmth. The lightly rose-scented
flowers last for about two weeks.
Lycaste
A deciduous plant, lycaste orchids have pleated foliage and trian-
gular flowers. Many of them have a tantalizing fragrance. They like
good air circulation, cool evenings of 45°F to 55°F (7°C to 13°C),
and frequent and heavy waterings during the summer growing
season. They should be kept on the dry side during the winter.
Lycaste Aquilea ‘Détente’ FCC/AOS is a prize-winner with a 4-inch
(10-cm) peachy colored flower that has a sweet floral fragrance.
Lycaste aromatia has sunny lemon yellow, cinnamon-scented, 21⁄2-
inch (6-cm) flowers borne in groups of up to 30 or 40 on a compact
plant — all of which makes this easy-to-grow species very popular.
If Lycaste aromatia is grown in bright light, the flowers have a more
intense color.
Zygopetalum
Oh, what a heavenly fragrance these have! When only one flowering
zygopetalum plant is in a room, it smells like a bed of hyacinths. Most
of the zygopetalums have similar color markings — usually, green
petals barred in dark maroon or brown with a very broad and promi-
nent white lip with dark purple or pink (see Figure 14-13). They’re
easy to grow and perform well on an eastern or southern windowsill.

H
ere I target four of the most burning issues amateur
orchidists frequently ask me: What are the easiest
orchids to grow? What is the most common ways orchids
are killed? What are the most frequently asked questions
about orchids and their culture? Why don’t my orchids
bloom? In this part, I give you some straightforward
answers to these sometimes perplexing questions and
issues so your orchid growing will be smooth sailing.
I remember my father buying me my ﬁrst orchid plant
when we were on a family vacation in Florida. How excit-
ing that moment was for me! It was rare in those days, 40
years ago, to ﬁnd a place that sold orchid plants and sup-
plies, unless you traveled to Florida or California. Most of
the northern growers produced orchids for cut ﬂowers,
not as pot plants. With the relatively recent strong surge
of interest in orchids as houseplants, the situation is now
much different.
If you live in even a medium-size city in the United States,
you’ll have access to at least a modest selection of orchids
and their supplies at your local garden center or home-
improvement center. Still, for a more complete offering of
more unusual or desirable varieties, you may want to take a
trip to an orchid grower or buy from mail order suppliers.
In the appendix, I give you a list of dependable and rep-
utable companies that offer plants and growing supplies.
I also give you contacts that you can make in order to join
a national orchid society or to ﬁnd your local chapter.
Rubbing shoulders with other folks who share your pas-
sion for orchids is great fun.

Orchids to Grow

 Finding the orchid that’s right for you
 Choosing an orchid that grows well where you live
T
hroughout this book, I let you know about orchids that are not
temperamental or especially demanding, but the orchids in
this chapter are some of the most satisfying to grow because of
their high performance and low maintenance.
For more specific cultural information on these orchids and others,
see the chapters in Part III.
Twinkle Moth Orchid
(Phalaenopsis Twinkle)
There are so many excellent moth orchids around, that finding a
“bad” one would be a challenge. In recent years, the breeders of
moth orchids have reached a high level of perfection with these
flowers, which means that the ones you buy at the discount center
for $20 to $30 would have been prize winners several years ago.
The Twinkle moth orchid is not the typical large white, pink, or
striped variety. It represents a somewhat newer direction for moth
orchids — the multifloral type that has many smaller flowers, up to
about 2 inches (5 cm) in size, on a very compact plant. The larger
moth orchids are gorgeous and elegant but take up quite a bit of
room, so if you’re looking for something more compact, check out
this multifloral type.

You don’t need to get this specific variety of moth orchid. Just find
one that’s listed as a multifloral type (also sometimes referred to
as “sweetheart” phalaenopsis).
Lady of the Night (Brassavola
nodosa)
This native of Mexico got its common name from its glorious
freesia evening scent. It grows best in strong light with warm tem-
peratures and will reward you with single or clusters of white spi-
dery flowers up to 6 inches (15 cm) across, which can appear a few
times a year.
Lady of the Night is a very compact-growing orchid, with tubular
leaves. It’s usually not more than a foot tall and grows in clumps. 
It will perform best if it isn’t divided and is allowed to grow into 
a nice large plant.
Maudiae Lady’s Slipper Orchid
(Paphiopedilum Maudiae)
Most Asian lady’s slipper orchids, as a group, are among the easiest
of orchids to grow, but this type stands out as especially undemand-
ing. The flowers are exotic and either have dramatic burgundy mark-
ings or are elegantly colored in green and white (see the color
section of photographs for an example).
Even when this plant is not in flower, its foliage is stunning with its
marbled pattern against a dark green base. These orchids do well
in modest light and normal room temperatures. They only grow
about 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) tall, so they fit easily on any
windowsill or under lights. To see these plants really shine, let
them get larger and develop multiple growths, which won’t take
long because they’re so robust.
Cockleshell Orchid (Epidendrum
cochleatum)
This is one of the most resilient of orchids — it seems to keep
blooming despite less-than-ideal conditions. One of the orchids
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
230

naturally found in Florida, this Cockleshell orchid has fascinating
flowers that appear to look upside-down. The “cockleshell” part of
the flower is striped with purple veins against a light green back-
ground, and the rest of the flower consists of segments that are
narrow, green, and somewhat spidery looking. After this orchid 
is established, it will bloom multiple times in a row, so it can have
flowers for six months or longer. It grows well under lights or on 
a bright windowsill.
Sharry Baby Oncidium (Oncidium
‘Sharry Baby’)
This is thought to be the single most popular orchid in the world!
And it’s not difficult to see why. It has a great deal to offer any
orchid lover.
Sharry Baby blooms dependably — usually around Christmastime —
and when it does, you’re treated to a flurry of many 1⁄2-inch (1.5-cm)
flowers that are yellow overlaid with burgundy covering a spike of
up to 30 inches (75 cm). What a show!
And the piece de resistance is that the flowers have the delicious
fragrance of chocolate and vanilla!
Because this orchid can get tall, place it near a sunny window that
has some headroom. Many different color forms of this wildly pop-
ular orchid are available.
Bird-Beak Orchid (Oncidium
ornithorhynchum)
Everyone has room for this Mexican beauty. Its dainty 1-inch (2.5-
cm) lavender-pink flowers with bright yellow centers and white
lips are borne in profusion (up to 100 on a mature plant), on thin
pendulous sprays.
Because this plant only grows 6 to 8 inches tall (15 to 20 cm), it can
fit on any windowsill or under lights. It will sometimes bloom more
than once a year — usually in the spring, occasionally in the fall —
and has a scent that reminds me of a fresh morning’s air.
Chapter 15: The Ten (or So) Easiest Orchids to Grow 231

Mari’s Song (Laeliocattleya
‘Mari’s Song’)
This variety belongs to a category of plants called minicatts (minia-
ture cattleyas). They all take up much less space than the standard
sized cattleya and many of them bloom more than once a year. This
particular variety of minicatt is popular because it’s easy to grow,
compact, has gaily tricolored, 41⁄2-inch (11-cm) flowers, and is very
fragrant.
Fan-Shape Orchid (Cochleanthes
amazonica)
I love this orchid. It has handsome glossy green foliage. Mine fre-
quently blooms twice or more a year with 2-inch (5-cm) snow-
white flowers that are veined in dark purple and smell like sweet
candy. Other cochleanthes, like Cochleanthes discolor, and hybrids
Cochleanthes ‘Moliere’ and Cochleanthes ‘Amazing’ are also good
choices. All of them have similar cultural requirements as moth
orchids and are just as undemanding.
Pansy Orchid (Miltoniopsis 
santanei)
Pansy orchids have a reputation for being a bit finicky. Although
this may be true for some of the ones from cooler climates, I have
found this species to be a wonderful exception. It’s from a warmer
climate so adapts very well to home culture. It has a relatively
small stature, usually growing only 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) tall
and sports flat, 2-inch (5-cm), white, pansy-shaped flowers with a
flare of bright yellow on the top of the lip. It has a delightful rose
fragrance.
To keep this orchid happy, grow it in moderate light and keep its
potting material damp.

The Ten Most Common Ways
Orchids Are Killed
In This Chapter
 Knowing you’re not alone if your orchid bites the bullet
 Helping your orchids live a long life
S
ooner or later, everyone loses a few orchids to the Grim
Reaper, but some causes of death take more orchid lives than
they should. Being on the lookout to prevent these problems will
save many of your orchids.
Overwatering
Overwatering is the big killer of orchids. Some people just can’t
help themselves. Watering is so much fun and you feel like you’re
doing something to help your orchids when you’re watering them.
When orchids die from overwatering, it isn’t really the result of 
too much water. It’s actually caused by too little air. There’s just 
so much open space in any potting material, and water naturally
displaces air, so if you apply it too often, there’s no room for air.
And your orchid needs air for healthy root growth. If it doesn’t 
get enough air, the roots rot and die.
See Chapter 6 for tips on how to properly water your orchids and
an emergency treatment to try if any of your overwatered orchids
start going downhill.
Underwatering
Ironically, just as overwatering is a big killer, so is underwatering.
In this case, the lack of water leads to root damage by dehydration

(see Chapter 6 for more details). Because orchid potting material
drains much more rapidly and tends to hold less moisture than
materials commonly used for other plants, some people tend to
underwater. Also, remember that the fresh potting material dries
out much more quickly than older potting material does.
Be sure to premoisten the orchid potting material before you use
it. This will make it more water-retentive. Check out Chapter 7 for
orchid potting tips and information.
Too Much Light or Heat
Light and heat are related to one another. Frequently, excessive
light leads to high temperatures. When the orchids receive too
much light, the heat starts to build up inside the leaf. Think of the
orchid leaf’s skin being like a plastic bag with very small holes in it.
Inside of this plastic bag is the interior of the leaf. When excessive
heat gets trapped inside the leaf, it literally cooks and destroys the
leaf plant tissue. Large black circular dead spots form, or in
extreme cases, the entire orchid collapses. After this damage is
done, you can’t do anything about it.
When the orchid is in full illumination, feel the leaf surface with
your hand. If it’s hot to the touch, move the orchid to where it gets
less light. See Chapter 5 for more information on light and tempera-
ture requirements for orchids.
Leaving Orchid Foliage 
Wet Overnight
Leaving orchid foliage wet overnight is asking for trouble in the
form of leaf spots and crown rot disease. (The crown is the growing
point of the orchid.) Water your orchids in the morning or early
afternoon, so the leaves have plenty of time to dry before nightfall.
If you can catch these diseases early, you may be able to save 
the orchid. But after the disease (which shows up as soft, mushy
tissue, that eventually turns black) gets to the growing point of 
the plant, it’s good-bye for your orchid.
For more information on orchid diseases and their control, see
Chapter 9.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
234

Too Much Fertilizer
Fertilizers are salts, and salts, in concentrated form, are types of
herbicides (plant poisons). Applying too much fertilizer will dehy-
drate the orchid roots. Signs of too much fertilizer are black root
tips or black or brown leaf tips. So, when you fertilize, be careful
not to apply more than the recommended dosage, and only use a
fertilizer when the plant is actively growing and when the growing
media is damp.
For more information on fertilizing orchids, see Chapter 6.
Improper Use of Pesticides
When pesticides are used properly, they’re safe for both you and
your plants. However, if they’re applied at too high of a concentra-
tion or applied when the plants are dry or the air temperature is
too high, severe damage to the orchid plant can result.
Also, many pesticides are dissolved and mixed in with a type of oil,
which in and of itself can cause leaf damage, especially if the mate-
rial is applied in bright, hot sunlight.
So use care with these materials and always read the label before
applying the chemical. See Chapter 9 to see which pesticides are
safest and most effective to use.
Insects
Catching insect problems in the early stages is very important. If
you realize that your orchid is completely covered with an insect
like scale or mealybugs, getting rid of all of them is very difficult.
Sometimes trashing this plant for the sake of others in your collec-
tion is the best approach; you don’t want to expose your other
plants to these critters. For more information on common orchid
pests and their control, check out Chapter 9.
Purchase of Sick Plants
Some orchid growers are Florence Nightingale types who feel it’s
their mission to save an orchid that looks sick. So they buy it, usu-
ally at a great discount. In most cases, these orchid lovers don’t
get a “deal” at all.
Chapter 16: The Ten Most Common Ways Orchids Are Killed 235

I highly recommend you resist the temptation to buy an unhealthy
orchid and try to nurse it back to health. If an orchid is in poor
condition and the leaves are wilting or shriveled, it’s usually on 
an unstoppable death spiral and the likelihood of your bringing 
it back to robustness is slim to none.
Poor Water Quality
In certain parts of the country, notably in the West, some local
water has a high salt content, which can be very damaging to
orchids. It can cause the same problems as overfertilizing (see
“Too Much Fertilizer,” earlier in this chapter).
If you have any doubts about the quality of your water, have a water
test done by a company that tests water for drinking quality. Also,
don’t use water that has been treated with a water softener on your
orchids. It usually contains a high amount of salt.
For more information on water quality, see Chapter 6.
Inadequate Ventilation
Orchids don’t appreciate stale air. When air isn’t circulated, fungi
and bacterial diseases flourish. Moving air also evaporates mois-
ture on leaves (moisture on leaves is another cause for disease
problems). So make your orchid happy and invest in an overhead
ceiling fan or oscillating fan to keep the air gently moving. It will
make a great difference in the health of your orchids. For more on
ventilation, see Chapter 5.

T
his entire book covers everything you need to know about
orchids, but in this chapter, I answer some of the most
common questions that beginning orchid growers have.
Are Orchids Difficult to Grow?
Orchids aren’t difficult to grow — they just have particular require-
ments that are somewhat different from many other houseplants
you may be familiar with. Thanks to modern orchid breeding, many
of the orchids that are available for beginning orchid lovers are vig-
orous growers that are adaptable to a wide range of growing situa-
tions, and that bloom easily and frequently.
Selecting the right orchid for your conditions is one of the keys to
success. See Chapter 2 to help you choose which one will do well
for you.
Why Should I Grow Orchids?
Many expert and amateur gardeners consider orchids to be the
most beautiful and exotic members of the plant family. Orchids are
a huge group of plants with diverse cultural requirements. This

means that, no matter where you live, you can find a group of
orchids that will suit your growing area. Also, because the flower
forms, fragrances, and colors are so diverse, you can find an
orchid to satisfy your taste.
Growing orchids is more than merely cultivating plants. You’ll be
joining a fraternity of avid (if not fanatical) orchid people who share
your interests. Soon you may become a member of an orchid soci-
ety (see the appendix), and you may visit various orchid growers
and attend orchid shows. You’ll form new friendships with others
who share your passion. It’s said that, after you’re bitten by the
orchid bug, there is no known cure. But what a wonderful affliction!
Do I Need a Greenhouse 
to Grow Orchids?
Absolutely not! Years ago, orchids were reserved for wealthy people
who could afford elaborate greenhouses with an attending staff of
professional horticulturists. Although a few of these places are still
around today, most people now grow orchids on windowsills and
under florescent lights. I’ve grown most of my orchids that way and
have been pleased to produce plants and flowers that look as good
as those grown in a greenhouse. So, don’t despair: If you have a
sunny window or a place to set up some lights, you, too, can grow
these beauties.
Are Orchids Expensive?
They don’t need to be. Sure, if you’re bound and determined, you
can spend thousands of dollars on mature, awarded plants. But
today you can buy blooming-size, fine-quality, healthy beginner
orchids ranging in price from $20 to $30. This is less than the price
of a flower arrangement from the florist, and an orchid’s flowers
will usually last much longer. After the orchid is finished flowering,
you still have a plant ready to bloom with even more flowers every
year. They’re really quite the floral bargain.
How Long and How Often 
Will Orchids Bloom?
This varies, depending on the type of orchid. A few orchids only
bloom a couple of days, but most will have flowers that last 
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
238

anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. Some with the
longest lasting flowers are the slipper and moth orchids. Many
orchids bloom once a year, while others can bloom two or three
times a year.
What Makes an Orchid an Orchid?
When many people see orchids, they can’t imagine what so many
diverse plants have in common that makes them all orchids. They
look so different! You have to closely examine the flower for the
answers. If you study the inner part of the flower, you’ll see a club-
like structure that houses the male and female flower parts (sta-
mens and pistils) called the column. All orchids have this unique
structure. Most also have a large and conspicuous center petal
called a lip.
For more information about how orchid plants and their flowers
are distinctive, see Chapter 1.
Are Orchids Fragrant?
Not all orchids are fragrant, but many are. A wonderful aspect of
orchid fragrance is their range of scents. Some smell like other
flowers (carnations, jasmine, gardenia, rose), while others have 
the scents of spices and foods (vanilla, citrus, cloves, chocolate,
coconut, licorice, honey, cinnamon, grapes).
Some orchids even reek! These are orchids that are pollinated by
flies and other insects attracted to carrion (rotted meat).
Fortunately, very few orchids fall in this category and they’re easy
to pick out when selecting orchids from a grower’s greenhouse.
See the Cheat Sheet in the front of the book for a list of some won-
derfully fragrant orchids. And watch for the Fragrance icon through-
out this book to find orchids that have distinctive scents.
Where Can I See the Best
Collections of Orchids?
Many public gardens display a sampling of these plants because
they put on such a show. For outstanding exhibits of orchids,

Many commercial growers also have fine displays of orchids at
their greenhouses. Regional orchid shows are held yearly in almost
every major city in the United States; they’re great places to see
orchids.
Are Any Orchids Hardy?
Most orchids (and all the ones described in this book) are from
tropical or semitropical areas and are intended to be grown as
indoor houseplants in most of the United States. In warmer states,
like parts of California, Texas, and Florida, some of these orchids
can be grown outdoors with winter protection.
There are, however, other native orchids that can only grow well in
very northern climates. The various lady’s slipper orchids are the
ones most admired in this group. In fact, one of these, the Spotted
Lady’s Slipper, is only found in the Yukon and Alaska!
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
240

Are Orchids Parasites?
Orchids are not parasites. Some people, who have seen orchids
growing in the wild in the tropics, have noticed that many of them
are attached to the limbs and trunks of trees, so they make the
conclusion that, like mistletoe, orchids are parasites. Parasites, by
definition, get their food at the expense of their host plants. This is
not the case with orchids. They’re merely using the trees or shrubs
as places to grow. Orchids are often found in the crotches of the
limbs where water and nutrients from roosting birds naturally
accumulate. Orchids have roots that can absorb these nutrients,
and the high perches in the trees afford them plenty of moist air
circulation, natural rainfall, and exposure to sunlight.

Chapter 18
The Ten Most Common
Reasons Why Orchids 
Don’t Bloom
In This Chapter
 Knowing how to keep your orchids blooming
 Giving your orchids what they need
N
othing is more frustrating than having your orchid plants
look good and healthy but still not bloom. This is a common
problem that can be easily remedied, and in this chapter, I show
you how.
Not Enough Difference between
Day and Night Temperatures
The most common reason that orchids don’t bloom indoors is that
the environment doesn’t have enough of a change in temperature
between day and night. In orchids’ natural habitats, evening tem-
peratures are at least 10°F to 15°F lower than the daytime tempera-
tures. This temperature difference triggers the orchids to start
developing flowers. In many home environments, the temperature
doesn’t vary much between day and night.
Get yourself a maximum-minimum thermometer (see Chapter 3)
and place it in your growing room. This thermometer will tell you 
if you need to move the plant somewhere cooler in the evening,
like closer to the window.
If you summer your orchids outdoors during the summer (see
Chapter 5), you’ll easily be able to provide this temperature 

difference. The temperature in my orchid summering area out-
doors drops in the evening at least 15°F and sometimes 20°F or
more during late summer and early fall.
Too Moist during the Winter
Several orchids, like some of the dendrobiums, require a very dry
period, up to several weeks, during the winter, when very little
water should be given to the plants. This mimics their native habi-
tat, in which their winters are dry. This dry period triggers flower
buds to form. Then when watering or natural rainfall begins in the
spring, the buds are ready to swell and produce flowers.
Too Little Light
If the leaves of your orchids are very dark green, the new growth is
longer or “stretched” compared to the older growth, and the leaves
on the stems are farther and farther apart, these are signs that
your orchid is not receiving enough light. Orchids will survive in
this lower light, but they won’t bloom. They need more energy
from light in order to produce flowers.
If your orchid is displaying these symptoms, gradually increase its
exposure to light by placing it in a brighter window or moving it
closer to florescent lights. See Chapter 5 for more information on
orchid light requirements and how to meet your orchid’s needs.
Excessively High or 
Low Temperatures
Excessively high or low temperatures can either prevent buds 
from forming or can cause the buds that are starting to develop to
shrivel and fall off. Unfortunately, flower buds are very vulnerable
to any forms of environmental stress, and they react to this stress
by falling, shrinking, and drying up before they open.
When orchids are shipped in cold weather, the low temperatures
that they experience in transit can cause them to drop their buds.
When you buy orchids during the winter that have been shipped to
the store, wait until they’ve been in the store for a day or so to see
if the buds have been affected by their trip.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
244

Not Using a Fertilizer or Using 
One with Too Much Nitrogen
Most orchids have relatively low nutrient needs, but, because
they’re usually grown in bark mixes that have few nutrients, some
type of fertilizer is usually necessary to provide their basic 
requirements.
Applying fertilizers with too much nitrogen can also cause poor 
or no blooming. High-nitrogen fertilizers can stimulate lush leaf
growth at the expense of flowers. See Chapter 6 for more-specific
orchid fertilizing guidelines.
Immature Plants
If you purchase an orchid that hasn’t bloomed, it may not yet have
reached its mature size. The amount of time it takes for an orchid
to mature varies a great deal depending on the type of orchid. For
instance, moth orchids are very fast to mature, while some of the
others may take years. Plants that have not yet bloomed are usu-
ally sold as seedlings (which can take several years to reach matu-
rity), as NFS (near flowering size, which usually bloom within a
year), or as FS (flowering size, which means they’ve reached
mature size and will usually bloom within several months).
Too Low Humidity
If the air is too dry when the buds are forming, they’ll sometimes
dry up before they open. To prevent this from happening to your
orchids, keep the humidly in your growing area at 60 percent or
greater.
See Chapter 5 for tips on how to easily raise the humidity around
your orchids.
Disease, Insects, or Mice
Orchid buds that are ravaged by insect pests or attacked by dis-
eases will either shrivel in place or, when they open, be deformed.
Follow the disease and insect prevention and control methods out-
lined in Chapter 9.
Chapter 18: The Ten Most Common Reasons Orchids Don’t Bloom 245

Some chemical pesticide sprays that you may use on insects and
disease can cause damage to the flower buds, so be careful to
spray-test a few buds at first before you apply the material to the
entire plant. If possible, wash the bugs off with warm water instead
of applying chemical sprays to the buds.
Mice also have the annoying habit of waiting until the flower buds
are plump and just ready to open before they decide to make a
meal of them. If your flower buds just disappear one night, suspect
mice as the likely culprits.
Not Enough Water
When flower buds are starting to swell, their cells are filling up
with water like a balloon. If sufficient water is not available to the
developing buds when all this is happening, they won’t fully
develop and instead will shrivel and never recover.
Cold water can also have the effect of causing the buds to drop off
before the flowers open. To prevent this, use water that is room
temperature or slightly warmer.
Recently Transplanted and Divided
When an orchid is transplanted, roots are frequently damaged,
which causes stress to the plant by reducing the roots’ ability to
effectively supply water to the buds.
Interestingly, after the flower is fully formed and open, transplant-
ing and or dividing rarely does much harm. In fact, some people
routinely transplant their orchids when they’re in flower, although
I think you’re better off waiting until right after they flower to
transplant them. For more information on transplanting and divid-
ing, see Chapter 7.

than Orchids and Orchid Digest, but if you just can’t get enough
information about orchids, this is another one to add to your list.
To subscribe to The Orchid Review, go to the RHS Web site and
click on Publications, then follow the Orchid Review link, or e-mail
