Preface
Designing of integrated circuits (ICs) requires expertise in different areas includ-
ing device physics, transistor-level design and logic-level design. An attempt has
been made to cover all these topics reinforced with physical and intuitive explan-
ations and necessary simulation analysis for better understanding of the theory.
The goal of this book is to emphasize the basic physical principles and physics of
transistors and behavior of circuits that can be used to explain and confront the chal-
lenging low power issues in digital and analog very-large-scale integration (VLSI)
design in a comprehensive manner with a focus on predominant complementary
metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology.
An attempt has also been made to adopt a hierarchical design methodology for di-
gital and analog energy-reduced low power VLSI design by analyzing theory and key
concepts in an organized manner to provide the reader an insightful, practical guide.
This book does not try to recommend speciﬁc software tools. In contrast, the main
objective of this book is to demonstrate a proper path to the reader to face the chal-
lenges of low power VLSI design through a maze of names, concepts, methodologies,
software tools and usage.
The purpose of this book is to present and explain in a coherent manner all the
know-how of low power digital and analog VLSI design. For each chapter/topic, the
book discusses several basic approaches and elaborates on the more fundamental
ones. A list of complete references/bibliography has been included at the end of each
chapter to provide extensive coverage of the topics by providing a list of many of the
classic books/papers dealing with the ﬁndings which are considered landmarks in
the VLSI industry. An attempt has been made to include all recent papers on emerging
topics which are appropriate for the targeted readers of this text.
In the following, a series of capsule description of the seven chapters in the book
has been introduced.
Chapter 1: Introduction to Low Power Issues in VLSI. This chapter presents an
overview of the low voltage, low power digital and analog ICs and their applications,
and also the context of the book and its motivations.
Chapter 2: Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET. Chapter 2 focuses
on the fundamental aspects of short channel effects which is considered as a fun-
damental roadblock to the future downscaled devices and is of immediate relevance
to the practical low power IC design. Advanced semiconductor IC fabrication tech-
nologies have increased the ability of shrinking or scaling of the devices with an
intention to make them smaller, faster, less power-consuming and reliable. The ag-
gressive scaling of the CMOS technology in the deep submicrometer regime gives rise
to the detrimental short channel effects. Thus, Chapter 2 gives a brief introduction to
the short channel effects and their preventions

Preface
Chapter 3: Advanced Energy-reduced CMOS Inverter Design. This chapter is
concerned with the theory of inverters, known as the basic building block of the di-
gital ICs, to set a solid foundation to understand the rest of this book by discussing
basic operation and other advanced issues in both super-threshold and subthreshold
regions of operation.
Chapter 4: Advanced Combinational Circuit Design. The topic on this chapter
focuses on the design principles of combinational digital logic circuits with an ob-
jective to make them fast, small and reliable. After providing a preliminary review of
the basic concepts of combinational digital logic design using different approaches,
a number of design examples are demonstrated, followed by ultralow power imple-
mentation of combinational circuits.
Chapter 5: Advanced Energy-reduced Sequential Circuit Design. The object-
ive of this chapter is to deal with advanced sequential circuit design techniques for
clocked logic structures that are fast, reliable, energy-efﬁcient and race-free. The
chapter also discusses the energy-efﬁcient implementation of sequential circuits with
introduction to adiabatic logic.
Chapter 6: Introduction to Memory Design. This chapter considers the techno-
logical issues necessary to comprehend the design and operation of low power, high
speed MOS-based memory systems. The evolution of memory design over the years
has been described brieﬂy. This chapter shows the way to design various types of
ROMs and RAMs. The features and architectures of latest memories available in the
market are also presented.
Chapter 7: Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design. The purpose of this chapter
is to present the design techniques of low power analog ICs and the fundamental
issues associated with the design of analog/mixed-signal system-on-chip design.

1 Introduction to Low Power Issues in VLSI
1.1 Introduction to VLSI
This chapter gives a brief description of low power digital and analog very-large-scale
integration (VLSI) design. It is also treated as a review of basic principles rather than
an in-depth treatment of individual advanced topics.
Over the last two decades, “wireless communication” is considered as one of the
major successes of engineering, not only due to its huge technological growth, but
also due to its societal and economic impact. The evolution of wireless communication
is directly linked to power consumption of the devices. The gap between small-sized
battery capacity and power requirement has become a critical factor to be considered
for most hand-held portable wireless devices. Thus, energy efﬁciency and low power
design has become one of the most important topics in integrated circuit (IC) design.
The chief design goal of today’s ICs can be listed as higher speed, higher accuracy
and reliability and low power drain. In the design of high performance analog/digital
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, energy efﬁciency plays a
crucial role. It has become highly difﬁcult to maintain energy efﬁciency in medium-to-
high accuracy circuits with highly scaled CMOS deep-submicron technologies. One of
the important purposes of this book is to emphasize some of the important challenges
faced by the circuit designers working with aggressively scaled devices and reviews
of the state-of-the-art device/circuit-level techniques that can be employed to mitigate
those challenges.
The CMOS digital ICs play a very important role in technology for modern inform-
ation age. Because of their intrinsic features in low power consumption, large noise
margins and ease of design, CMOS ICs have been widely used to develop random ac-
cess memory (RAM) chips, microprocessor chips, digital signal processor chips and
application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. The popular use of CMOS circuits
continues to grow with the increasing demands for low power, low noise integrated
electronic systems in the development of portable computers, portable phones and
multimedia agents.
As more and more complex functions are required in various data processing
and telecommunication devices, the need to integrate these functions in a small
package is also increasing (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors,
http://public.itrs.net, 2009). The level of integration is measured in terms of number
of logic gates in chip. So the number of logic gates is also increasing. These advances
in device manufacturing technology allow steady reduction of minimum feature size
as well as channel length and power consumption per function. This also increases
the speed of the device.
As process technology scales beyond 100 nm feature sizes, for functional and
high-yielding silicon, the traditional design approach needs to be modiﬁed to cope

1 Introduction to Low Power Issues in VLSI
with interconnect processing difﬁculties and other newly exacerbated physical effects.
The scaling of gate oxide in the nano-CMOS regime results in a signiﬁcant increase in
gate direct tunneling current [1]. The effect of gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) is felt
in designs, such as DRAM and low power SRAM, where the gate voltage is driven neg-
ative with respect to the source. If these effects are not taken care of, the result will be
a nonfunctional SRAM, DRAM or any other circuit that uses this technique to reduce
subthreshold leakage [2].
The level of integration as measured by the number of logic gates in monolithic
chip is increasing over the past three decades, mainly due to the rapid progress in
process technology and interconnects technology.
– Multifunctional chips (1962) contain 2–4 logic blocks per chip.
– MSI (medium-scale integration) (1967) chips contain 20–200 logic blocks per chip.
– LSI (large-scale integration) chips contain 200–2,000 logic blocks per chip.
– VLSI (very-large-scale integration) chips contain 2,000–20,000 logic blocks per
chip.
– ULSI (ultralarge-scale integration) chips contain >20,000 logic blocks per chip.
As the technology scales down with its pace determined by famous Moore’s law, the
supply voltage needs to be scaled down along with the transistor dimensions. This is
primarily due to the fact that decreasing supply voltage helps to avoid possible break-
down of MOS transistors with ultrathin gate oxides. In an inverter cell, considered as
the simplest logic gate, estimated power consumption can be expressed as
P = CL ⋅V2
DD ⋅f
(1.1)
where CL designates the load capacitor to be driven, VDD is the supply voltage and f is
the frequency of operation.
Therefore, if speed has to be increased, simultaneous reduction of power con-
sumption is also necessary. Supply voltage reduction can be employed as an efﬁcient
tool to achieve it. In general, to provide sufﬁcient lifetime to the digital circuitry and
to keep power consumption at an acceptable level, downscaling is accompanied by
supply voltage reduction [3–5]. It is worth mentioning that this evolution is true for
digital domain, not the analog domain.
1.2 Low Power IC Design beyond Sub-20 nm Technology
Sub-20 nm process technology promises boost in performance, capacity breakthrough
and signiﬁcant power reduction. However, they possess several challenges to the
IC design and manufacturing, requiring changes ranging from custom cell design
to system-on-chip (SoC) integration. The cost of sub-20 nm is not cheap. How-
ever, despite their cost, with its power, performance and area gains (PPA), sub-20
nm process technology promises a new generation of smaller, faster and cheaper

product in areas such as mobile computing, smartphones, servers, entertainment and
wireless equipment. Although the projected improvements of sub-20 nm technolo-
gies are compelling, the challenges and requirements are also extremely large. The
challenges and requirements for adaptation of sub-20 nm technology are shown in
Figure 1.1.
1.3 Issues Related to Silicon Manufacturability and Variation
Dual pattering lithography techniques are required to pattern correctly some of the
metal pitches below 80 nm, which requires extra masks and two-color layout decom-
position techniques. This has an impact on every phase of IC design methodology, i.e.
from standard cell development to placement, routing, extraction and physical veri-
ﬁcation. Requirement of correct-by-construction methodology needs to be employed
where every tool should be “double-pattering aware” [6].
Moreover, the requirement of approximately more than 400 new design rules
(some of which are very aggressive) further complicates the design process. It is ex-
pected that below 20 nm, variability will be everywhere (i.e. from channel length to
channel doping). Reduction in metal pitches may cause increase in coupling between
wires causing signal integrity problems. For analog circuit design, parasitics and mis-
match are going to create major problems. Due to layout-dependent effects (LDE), it is
expected to become difﬁcult to model a single transistor or a cell in isolation as they
are placed in close proximity in the layout structure, thus changing the behavior of
the device.

1.4 Issues Related to Design Productivity
Sub-20 nm technology node looks awesome if the design is shipped in time in order
to make the chips out of the door in time. Therefore, an accelerated and integrated
end-to-end design ﬂow is required in contrast to sequential point-tool approach. This
clearly suggests the requirement of an automation tool – to achieve design cycles
savings as shown in Figure 1.2.
Moreover, a ﬂexible modeling methodology with different levels of abstraction
may cause signiﬁcant reduction in development time for large designs.
1.5 Limitation Faced by CMOS
As metal–oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistors (MOSFETs) reach nanometer di-
mensions, power consumption becomes a major bottleneck for further scaling. The
continued reduction of the MOSFET size is leading to an increased leakage current due
to short channel effects (SCEs), such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), and
the power supply voltage cannot be reduced any further because of the subthreshold
slope being limited to 60 mV/decade at room temperature [7]. In this view, the explora-
tion of alternative devices, which possibly outperform the MOSFET at these nanometer
dimensions, is required.
In 1974, R. Dennard published an article [2], which has become very famous in
the semiconductor device community, about how to scale a MOSFET while keeping
the electric ﬁelds inside the device unchanged. He recommended that all device di-
mensions be scaled by 1/*; while the doping of the source and drain regions should
increase by a factor of *, applied voltages should also be scaled by 1/*. These rules
have been roughly followed ever since, until rather recently.

Figure 1.3: Dennard’s original ﬁgures illustrating the principles of constant electric ﬁeld scaling.
Figure 1.3 shows Dennard’s scaling rules [2]. These scaling rules worked well for 1.4 ,m
node in the past. However, it no longer works for todays transistor with sizes in the
deca-nanometer range. While the supply voltage VDD decreased to about 20% of its
original value, the threshold voltage VTh only went down to approximately half of its
starting value. That threshold voltage decrease did not happen as a natural result of
Dennard scaling. It had to come about in other ways, such as changing the doping
of the channel region under the gate. Since the electric ﬁelds inside a MOSFET stay
nearly constant when the scaling rules are followed correctly, the threshold voltage
stays nearly constant as well, unless other changes are made.
The most important consequence of VDD reducing during device scaling while
VTh reduces signiﬁcantly less is that the gate overdrive goes down. When gate over-
drive decreases, on-current decreases, which negatively affects device performance,
the IOn/IOff ratio and dynamic speed (CgVDD/IOn). There are two possible solutions to
this problem of needing a high gate overdrive: either VDD can stay higher than it should
with constant ﬁeld scaling, or VTh can be scaled down more aggressively.
1.6 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
Due to the signiﬁcant resources and investments required to develop the next gen-
eration of CMOS technologies, it has been necessary to identify clear goals and put
collective efforts toward developing new equipment and technologies. The semicon-
ductor roadmap represents a consensus among industry leaders and gives projected
needs based on past trends. The International Technology Roadmap for Semicon-
ductors (ITRS) [6] is the standard accepted roadmap. The gate insulator needs to be
aggressively scaled down to improve the drive current and to suppress short channel

effects. Currently, in the 130 nm technology node with a 70 nm physical gate length,
the physical thickness of the gate oxide is only 15 1A, which are approximately 6
atomic layers thick. To continue the past trends in CMOS scaling, a sub-10 1A effective
oxide thickness will soon be required, which is about 4 atomic layers thick. Beyond
that point, SiO2 may lose its properties as an insulator and we may need a different
material system, as will be discussed later. Figure 1.4 shows the supply voltage scaling
scenario. Lower supply voltages are required due to power dissipation and reliabil-
ity reasons. The roadmap distinguishes two different applications: high performance
and low power circuits. High performance applications include mainstream micro-
processors, and low power applications include mobile chips, where the duration of
the battery power is more important than performance. On the other hand Figure 1.5

shows the trend of on-chip clock speed variation along various technologies scaling
advancement.
In summary, scaling improves cost, speed and power per function with every new
technology generation. Table 1.1 shows that scaling is expected to continue.
Formerly followed scaling trends follow that 1/* = 0.7 in every 2 or 3 years which is
not true for VDD. In order to maintain acceptable levels of gate overdrive, VDD scaling
has slowed down drastically. When the supply voltage decreases along with device
dimensions, the power density IOn × VDD/A (on-current times supply voltage divided
by surface area) remains constant, which means that the energy needed to drive the
chip and the heat produced by the chip remain constant. This assumes that when
devices scale down, we don’t see chip size decreasing, but rather, more complexity
and functionality are added with each generation, and chip size remains more or less
constant.
When VDD doesn’t scale down, power density increases instead. For each MOSFET,
the dynamic and static power consumption can be expressed as
PDynamic = fCLVDD
(1.2)
where f is the frequency and CL is the total switched capacitive load, and
PStatic = ILeakVDD
(1.3)
where ILeak is the sum of the leakage currents in the device when the MOSFET is in the
off state.
If VDD does not decrease, and yet device dimensions decrease, and more devices
are added to a chip such that chip size is not signiﬁcantly reduced, then it can be
expected that power consumption will rise considerably.

1 Introduction to Low Power Issues in VLSI
1.7 Different Groups of MOSFETs
Moving a design from an old technology to a newer one, with smaller design rules,
has always been, up to now, an interesting way to lower the power consumption and
to obtain higher speed. Indeed, the overall parasitic capacitances (i.e. gates and in-
terconnects) are decreased, the available active current per device is higher, and,
consequently, the same performance can be achieved with a lower supply voltage.
Moving to a new technology generation, however, induces a scale down of the power
supply voltage (VDD), the threshold voltage (VTh) and the gate oxide thickness (tOx).
Beginning with the 0.18 ,m technologies, it appeared that building a transistor with a
good active current (IOn) and a low leakage current (IOff) was becoming more difﬁcult.
The following four main causes of limitations are discussed:
(1)
Voltage limits and subthreshold leakage
(2)
Tunneling currents
(3)
Statistical dispersions
(4)
Poly depletion and quantum effects
Therefore, two families of transistors were introduced: high speed transistors and low
leakage transistors. The threshold voltages of the two families are tuned differently,
using a different channel doping. When moving to more advanced technologies, those
two families are not sufﬁcient anymore, regarding technological constraints. The ITRS
introduces three main groups of transistors:
(1)
High performance (HP)
(2)
Low operating power (LOP)
(3)
Low standby power (LSTP)
At this stage, the channel doping not only is different, but also has the gate oxide
thickness.
The HP technology uses the shortest gate lengths in order to achieve the higher
drive current. A higher leakage current is also allowed in the technology. For the LOP
technology, the main target is to reduce the operating power of the circuit. Compared
to the HP technology, the LOP one uses a longer physical gate length, a thicker gate
oxide in order to achieve a leakage current hundreds of times lower, for a given node.
The main purpose of LSTP technology is to achieve transistors with a very low leakage
current (roughly ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than the HP technology). To satisfy
this criterion, gate length and gate oxide scaling are relaxed, compared to both HP
and LOP technologies. In addition, threshold voltage values must be signiﬁcantly in-
creased to lower the leakage current. As discussed in the following sections, many key
issues, a few of which are listed below, have no ready-made available solution today:
– How to shrink the gate length and achieve good performances
– How to shrink the gate oxide thickness and match the leakage current targets
– How to reduce the supply voltage, while keeping operational circuits and low
leakage current

Figure 1.6: Three different types of MOSFETs introduced by ITRS roadmap.
1.8 Three MOS Types
A new kind of MOS device has been introduced in deep submicron technologies, start-
ing with the 0.18 ,m CMOS process generation. The new MOS, called “low leakage”
or “High-VTh” MOS device, is available as well as the normal one, called “high-speed
MOS”.
For I/Os operating at high voltage, speciﬁc MOS devices called “High voltage
MOS” are used. We cannot use high speed or low leakage devices as their oxide is
too small. A 2.5 V voltage would damage the gate oxide of a high speed MOS in 0.12
,m technology. The high voltage MOS is built using a thick oxide, two to three times
thicker than the low voltage MOS, to handle high voltages as required by the I/O
interfaces.
The following new kinds of MOS are introduced in deep submicron technology
(0.18 ,m) (shown in Figure 1.6):
– High speed: for critical path in term of speed
– Low leakage: for embedded application (less consumption)
– High voltage: for I/O which need higher voltage (oxide thicker than the other MOS)
1.9 Low Leakage MOSFET
The main drawback of the “Low leakage” MOS device is a 30% reduction of the ion
current, leading to a slower switching. High speed MOS devices should be used in the
case of fast operation linked to critical nodes, while low leakage MOS should be placed
whenever possible, for all nodes where a maximum switching speed is not required.
There are two main reasons to keep a low voltage supply for the core of IC. The
ﬁrst one is low power consumption, which is of key importance for ICs used in cellular

or any portable devices. Low supply strongly reduces power consumption by reducing
the amplitude of signals, thus reducing the charge and discharge of each elementary
node of the circuit. The second reason for low internal supply is the oxide breakdown.
Increased switching performances have been achieved by a continuous reduction of
the gate oxide thickness. In 0.12 ,m technology, the MOS device has an ultrathin gate
oxide, around 0.003 ,m, that is 3 nm or 30 1A. The main objective is to reduce sig-
niﬁcantly the IOff current which is the small current that ﬂows between drain and
source with a gate voltage 0 (supposed to be no current in ﬁrst-order approximation).
In Figure 1.7, the low leakage MOS device (right side) has an IOff current reduced by a
factor 100, thanks to a higher threshold voltage (0.45 V rather than 0.35 V).
1.10 Importance of Subthreshold Slope
While we care a lot about the “ON” behavior of MOS devices, it is equally important to
know their “OFF” characteristics. One important question arises is, what is the current
when VGS < VTh?
To answer this question we care about subthreshold behavior of MOSFET be-
cause it affects the operation of the dynamic circuits and it has become a signiﬁcant
contributor to power dissipation in high performance microprocessors (∼30%).
Speed ∝(VDD – VTh) (speed is proportional to (VDD – VTh))
As the device dimensions are shrunk below 50 nm, the behavior of the device
below the threshold or in the subthreshold regime becomes critical. The analysis up
to now has assumed that the device turns on abruptly at a gate voltage above the
threshold or that no current ﬂows at the gate voltages below VTh.
As shown in Figure 1.8, this assumption does not account for the current that ﬂows
through the channel in the region below strong inversion or in the weak inversion
regime which is deﬁned as the region where the surface band bending IS is in the
range

Subthreshold current is the drain-source current when the gate-source voltage is
below the MOSFET threshold voltage. The threshold voltage distinguishes the con-
duction from nonconduction states of an MOS transistor with the basic assumption of
the MOS capacitor analysis that no inversion layer charge exists below the threshold
voltage. This leads to zero current below threshold. The transition from the conduct-
ing to the nonconducting state is not sharp, but continuous. This means that when
the gate-source voltage increases, the charge in the channel is not created abruptly
but appears gradually with VGS. There are a range of gate voltages lower than VTh for
which there are carriers in the inversion layer that contribute to the drain current.
The number of carriers that constitute the channel varies exponentially with the gate
voltage. The actual subthreshold current is not zero but reduces exponentially below
the threshold voltage. The subthreshold behavior is critical for dynamic circuits since
one needs to ensure that no charge leaks through the transistors biased below the
threshold.
An ideal I–V characteristic predicts zero drain current when VGS < VTh. Exper-
imentally ID is not equal to 0 when VGS < VTh. The drain current that exists for
VGS < VTh is known as the subthreshold current.
When the surface is in weak inversion (–IF > IS > 0, VGS < VTh), a conducting
channel starts to form and a low level of current ﬂows between the source and the
drain as shown in Figure 1.9.
Due to that
– ID leakage increases,
– static power increases and
– circuit instability increases.

The subthreshold current is due to weak inversion in the channel, which leads to a
diffusion current from the source to the drain. Fermi level is closer to the conduction
band than the valance band. So, the semiconductor surface behaves like a lightly
doped n-type material; small conduction between S and D through this weakly inver-
ted channel compares the barriers. In subthreshold regime, current is an exponential
function of VGS. For strong inversion, we lose these exponential relationships. For a
very small gate voltage, subthreshold current is reduced to the leakage current of the
source/drain junction which determines the off-state leakage current and causes the
standby power dissipation in MOSFET.
It also tells the importance of having high quality source/drain junction so if VTh
is too low, the MOSFET cannot be turned off fully even at VG = 0 V, causing some
subthreshold leakage current.
The circuit designer must include the subthreshold current to ensure that the
MOSFET is biased sufﬁciently below the threshold voltage in the “OFF” state. Oth-
erwise signiﬁcant power dissipation will arise as millions of MOSFETs is used
in IC.
The analog circuit based on the subthreshold operation of the devices having an
additional advantage of getting higher the gain due to the exponential behavior of the
drain current gives rise to the higher trans-conductance factor (gm/Id).
We want no current when the transistor is in the off state, i.e. when the gate
voltage is below the threshold voltage. If VTh is large so that |VGS| < |VTh|, then the
number of carriers into the channel approaches zero. However, a large VTh increases
the time required to switch between the on and the off conducting states, resulting
in slow digital device operations. Thus we cannot make VDD arbitrarily small because
speed of the device is proportional to VDD–VTh.

Smaller transistors require the lower operating voltages to restrict the internal elec-
tric ﬁeld within reasonable limits. This in turn requires the decrease of the threshold
voltage to maintain the operating speed of the device. This increases off-state leak-
age current. The tendency today used is to maintain circuit performance at the cost of
power increase. Modern devices show a considerable current leakage even at VGS = 0
V as shown in Figure 1.10.
1.11 Why Is Subthreshold Current Exponential in Nature?
In a MOSFET, a parasitic Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is provided where we have
an n-p-n sandwich with mobile minority carriers in the P region as shown in Fig-
ure 1.11. The base potential of this parasitic BJT is controlled through a capacitive
divider and not directly controlled by an electrode.
We know that for a BJT
IC ≅IS ⋅e(qVBE/KT).
In our case we have
ID ≅I0 ⋅eq(VGS–VTh)/nKT,
where n is given by the capacitive divider given as n = COx+CD

where CD is the depletion
layer capacitance.

The value of I0 depends on the process. For a particular technology ID = 0.3 ,A/,m
which means a 1-,m-wide device will have ID = 0.3 ,A when VGS = VTh.
Therefore, the subthreshold current increases exponentially with surface poten-
tial. On a log plot such as Figure 1.9 the subthreshold current appears as a straight
line. The inverse of the slope of that line is called “inverse subthreshold slope”, “sub-
threshold swing” or, more simply, “subthreshold slope”. It is expressed in millivolts
per decade, which means “How many millivolts should the gate voltage be increased
to increase the drain current by a factor 10?”. The lower the value of the subthreshold
slope, S, the more efﬁcient and rapid the switching of the device from the off state to
the on state.
This is an important parameter that allows quick estimation of subthreshold
current in the so-called subthreshold slope factor S.
It tells us how much change in the gate control voltage (BVGS) gives a ten times
(10×) change in current. By deﬁnition the subthreshold slope is given by

n = 1 gives S = 60 mV/decade (ideal BJT); n = 1.3 gives S = 80 mV/decade at
room temperature. S becomes about 100 mV/decade at high temperature because kT/q
increases with temperature.
For example, consider VTh = 500 mV, I0 = 0.3 ,A/,m and S = 100 mV/decade. It
indicates that current at VGS = 0 is ﬁve decades lower, i.e. 3 pA/,m.
Now consider VTh = 100 mV, ID = 0.3 ,A/,m and S = 100 mV/decade. It indicates
that current at VGS = 0 is 5 decades lower, i.e. 30 nA/,m.
Suppose we have 10 million transistors of width 10 ,m resulting in a subthreshold
current
ISubthreshold = 3 A,
which produces huge power dissipation. This is why we cannot make VTh arbitrarily
small.
1.12 Subthreshold Leakage and Voltage Limits
The subthreshold current of a transistor is typically described by the following
equation:
IOff ≈a
1
LEff exp
q (VG – VTh)
kT

,
where a is a constant, LEff is the effective gate length, VG is the gate voltage, VTh is the
threshold voltage and kT/q is the thermal voltage.
In a typical scaling scenario, the electric ﬁelds are kept constant in the device by
shrinking all the voltages and dimensions by the same factor. All doping levels are
increased by the same scaling factor. As IOff increases exponentially when VTh de-
creases, however, static power consumption sets a lower limit to the scaling down of
threshold voltages of the transistors. As the dynamic performance is directly related
to the VDD/VTh ratio, the power supply voltage also does not scale down easily. Con-
sequently, in the ITRS roadmap scenario, supply voltages do not shrink as rapidly as
device dimensions. This results in a higher electric ﬁeld in the device that has to be
handled at the device level. Another consequence is the lower beneﬁt granted to the
dynamic power consumption which is proportional to VDD2.
Thus it is getting impossible to have simultaneously good active and leakage
currents that several sets of transistors are required in advanced technologies.

1 Introduction to Low Power Issues in VLSI
1.13 Importance of Subthreshold Slope in Low Power Operation
Threshold voltage reduction increases the transistor leakage since a signiﬁcant sub-
threshold current occurs during the off state of the transistor. This current has impact
at the circuit level, since it is a ﬁxed current contributing from all the devices in the off
state. A subthreshold current of 10 nA at VGS = 0 is insigniﬁcant for a single device, but
in a 100 million transistor IC the impact on the overall power consumption is signiﬁc-
ant. Some technologies have MOSFETs with two different VTh’s to solve the problem.
The high speed devices with lower VTh contribute signiﬁcant higher leakage and are
used in critical path where speed is important. Circuits where speed is not important
are designed with higher VTh transistors, reducing the overall power leakage.
Nowadays, there is a renewed interest in exploring devices that use tunneling for
their on-current. In particular, there is a focus on devices which act as ﬁeld-effect tran-
sistors (FETs), where a change of gate voltage turns the current on and off, but which
use band-to-band tunneling in their on state, as well as in the transition between the
off and on states. These devices have the potential for extremely low off current and
present the possibility to lower the subthreshold swing beyond the 60 mV/decade
limit of conventional MOSFETs. Therefore, they seem well adapted to be candidates
for an ultimately scaled quasi-ideal switch. One such reported device is the tunnel
FET (TFET) that incorporates a delta-layer of Si-Ge at the edge of the p+ region, in
order to reduce the barrier width and, thereby, improve the subthreshold swing and
on-current. Another is the carbon nano-tube TFET, which uses two independently
controlled gates to change the energy bands in the channel.
1.14 Ultralow Voltage Operation
Power consumption is a critical issue in modern-day IC design. Ideal technology
scaling reduces energy in the third order as shown in eq. (1.6):
Delay = 1
f = CsVDD
IDsat
∝
VDD
(VDD – VTh)1.3 ; Power ∝fVDD2; Energy ∝CsVDD2.
(1.6)
However, it is important to remember that saving energy by scaling supply voltage has
not proven to be useful since (a) in modern-day IC’s switching energy is no longer the
chief contributor of total energy consumption due to large increase of subthreshold
and gate leakage component and (b) supply voltage scales in a slow linear manner.
As supply voltage scales, quadratic to exponential savings in switching, sub-
threshold and gate leakage energy is theoretically expected. However, it is important
to remember that supply voltage scaling affects the performance of the circuit as
shown in eq. (1.6). Therefore, supply voltage is lowered to a certain value where circuit
can ﬁnish their work within a stipulated deadline – a technique known as dynamic

scaling. This lower limit of the supply voltage usually lies well above the threshold
voltage [8, 9].
However, in an ultralow voltage operation, supply voltage is further scaled down
to threshold voltage to maximize the energy efﬁciency as CMOS gates can fulﬁll their
functionality at these voltages [10]. Recently, many researchers have demonstrated
successful operation of CMOS ICs with several hundreds of millivolt by achieving
several orders of energy efﬁciency [11–13].
A peak energy-efﬁcient point is required to be deﬁned for ultralow power oper-
ation. Zhai et al. [14] and Calhoun and Chandrakasan [15] have shown that energy
efﬁciency diminishes if supply voltage is scaled to a very low value. This can be
primarily attributed to the fact that higher leakage energy is consumed by increas-
ingly slow circuits, which offsets savings achieved in switching energy. As a result,
total energy consumption starts to increase after a minimum is reached, referred to as
VMin, and corresponds to a minimum energy of EMin as shown in Figure 1.12.
1.15 Low Power Analog Circuit Design
Low power analog circuit design is a complex task involving multiple trade-offs
between power consumption, speed, linearity, transistor dimension, etc. For ad-
vanced deep submicron devices, increasing SCEs further complicates the design
process. With aggressive downscaling of MOS devices, as SCEs becomes more prom-
inent, the quest for accurate device models intensiﬁes. In digital domain, the most
powerful commercial circuit simulators rely on sophisticated compact models for ana-
lysis and design of digital circuits. However, in analog domain, due to the lack of
available compact model, even the most experienced analog designer still relies on
the hand calculation, prior to the simulation. However, for bulk MOSFETs, BSIM6 and
other device compact models are available for designing low power analog circuitry.

The design of CMOS analog circuits like OP-AMPs takes advantage of working in the
subthreshold or weak inversion region to compromise bandwidth, size and gain. For
instance when a transistor operates in saturation region, it consumes more power to
meet the speciﬁcation. Therefore, the region of operation is another important design
aspect.
There are several advantages of subthreshold region of operation, which can be
listed as follows:
(1)
Possibilities of achieving higher gain [16–19]
(2)
Guaranteed low power consumption
(3)
Reduced distortion and improvement in linearity than saturation region [17]
(4)
Increased output resistance
However, the major difﬁculty with subthreshold region of operation is the reduction
in the circuit bandwidth and resulting limited frequency of operation. However, it
is worth mentioning that by optimizing the device structure to reduce intrinsic gate
capacitances (CGs and CGd) frequency of operation can be increased.
1.16 Fundamental Consequence of Lowering Supply Voltage
From the views of plain physics, power consumption in analog circuits is proportional
to the signal integrity (signal-to-noise ratio). In simple words, in an analog circuit,
high power is invested to result in higher performance. It is important to remember
that for a given power budget, performance degrades as supply scales down. In Fig-
ure 1.13 the power consumption of a unity-gain buffer is plotted against supply voltage
for different technology nodes. Figure 1.13 indicates that minimum power consump-
tion increases with decreasing supply voltage for performance to be remain constant,
although it is worth mentioning that at a constant supply voltage, migration to new
technology node lowers the power consumption.

1.17 Analog MOS Transistor Performance Parameters
19
As CMOS transistors are scaled down in the nanometer range, various issues known as
SCEs are causing degradation of transistor performance. These effects need to be mit-
igated in order to continue the historical cadence of downscaling. Proper circuit-level
design with new circuit techniques was reviewed to provide leverage for improving
energy efﬁciency of future downscaled analog circuits.
The drain-to-source saturation voltage and threshold voltage do not scale in
the same manner as the supply voltage. As a result, analog designers face difﬁ-
culties due to available limited voltage headroom. Some high performance analog
circuits normally working under high voltage lost their performance validity in low
voltage operation. Low voltage operation has also laid down several limitations on
the sampled-data circuits such as switched-capacitor operation.
1.17 Analog MOS Transistor Performance Parameters
(i)
Cutoff frequency is considered as one of the most important MOS device per-
formance parameters, which is given by
ft =
gm
20 (CGs + CDs),
(1.7)
where gm represents transconductance and CGs and CDs represent gate-to-source
and drain-to-source capacitances, respectively.
This is one of the few parameters that improves with scaling. The maximum
cutoff frequency is given by [20]
ft,Max =
vSat
20 LEff
.
(1.8)
The maximum cutoff frequency is limited by saturation velocity of the channel
carriers and effective distance between the source and the drain terminal.
However, it is worth mentioning that transistors generally operate much
below than ft,Max, due to the presence of parasitic capacitances.
(ii)
Transconductance Generation Factor (TGF) is considered as the ﬁgure of merit
to measure the efﬁciency to translate current into transconductance. A lower
TGF indicates reduced input device ability and higher power dissipation [21].
It characterizes the device current efﬁciency and to obtain a certain value of
conductance is given by
TGF = gm/Id.
(1.9)
(iii)
Transistor intrinsic gain is given by
Av = gm

where gDs is the channel conductance. This is one factor that degrades with scal-
ing and is considered as a design challenge for future analog circuit design with
downscaled CMOS technology.
(iv)
The product of gm/ID and fT represents a trade-off between power and band-
width and is utilized in moderate to high speed designs. The intrinsic gain
(gm/gDs) is a valuable ﬁgure of merit for operational transconductance ampliﬁer.
To comprise these aspects of analog/RF circuit design, a unique ﬁgure of merit,
the gain transconductance frequency product, is proposed and given by [22]
GTFP =

(1.11)
(v)
Nonlinearity of a CMOS analog circuit depends on the nonlinearity of the device
drain current. Linearity is an essential requirement in all RF system in order
to ensure minimal intermodulation and higher order harmonics at the output of
RF front-end stages [23]. Traditional method of achieving linearity involves com-
plex circuit design methods [24] and/or requires operation of the device in the
velocity saturation regime [25], which implies high supply voltages and large
power consumption – a scenario that is not ideal for portable and low power
applications. For a MOSFET, transconductance and output conductance are ma-
jor causes of nonlinearity. Linearity is directly proportional to transconductance
and is inversely proportional to the second derivative of the transconductance
[23] which indicates that devices with constant transconductance versus gate-
voltage curves, and small variations over a speciﬁc voltage range, are more
linear. In the following analysis of linearity for MOSFET, gm1, gm2 and gm3 are
given by
gm1 = ∂IDs
∂VGS
, gm2 = ∂2IDs
∂VGS2 , gm3 = ∂3IDs
∂VGS3 .
(1.12)
VIP2 and VIP3 represent the extrapolated gate-voltage amplitudes at which the
second- and third-order harmonics, respectively, become equal to the fundamental
tone in the device drain current (ID). These are the suitable FOMs, which can properly
determine the distortion characteristics from DC parameters; to achieve high linearity
and low distortion operations, these should be as high as possible. VIP2 and VIP3 rep-
resent the extrapolated gate-voltage amplitudes at which the second- and third-order
harmonics, respectively, become equal to the fundamental tone in the device drain
current (ID) and are given by [26, 27]

minimization of distortion and is given by [22]

1 dB compression point is considered as a reliable measure of linearity evaluation at
the onset of distortion and is given by [27, 28]
1 dB compression point = 0.22
 gm1
gm3
.
(1.17)
The 1 dB compression point indicates the power level that causes the gain to drop by 1
dB from its small signal value. This parameter is important for an ampliﬁer circuit as it
gives an idea about the maximum input power that the circuit can handle by providing
a ﬁxed amount of gain.
Summary
Physical dimensions of MOSFET devices are being continuously scaled down over
the past four decades. This rapid cadence of MOSFET downscaling is accelerating
introduction of new technologies to extend MOS scaling beyond the 100 nm node.
This acceleration simultaneously requires an intense study of SCEs and their remedies
in order to improve the performance and to sustain the historical cadence of mini-
aturization. The emphasis of this dissertation is on incorporating the recent advances
in unconventional MOS device structures to determine the minimum acceptable
channel length and to circumvent SCEs, considered as the most daunting roadblock
for sub-100 nm MOSFET scaling. This chapter provides the incentive and guide for
further research and experimental exploration of the unique features of MOSFET
scaling beyond 100 nm and demonstrates a new way of engineering deep submicron
MOSFETs with the focus on uncovering the potential of novel unconventional MOS-
FET structures in the context of design of digital logic or RF/analog ICs. This provides
an incentive for circuit simulation involving unconventional device structures for
next-generation ULSI circuits.

2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
2.1 MOSFET Scaling
Scaling is the process of reducing the device dimensions while keeping the elec-
trical characteristics constant [1]. The main problem with miniaturization is the direct
dependence of electrical characteristics on physical parameters. As a result many
nonideal effects hinder the performance characteristics of devices. In case of constant
ﬁeld scaling, the depletion region, internal ﬁelds, currents, capacitances and all di-
mensions are scaled by a factor k. The main drawback of this scaling scheme is that
it is often not possible to scale parameters in the required proportions. Constant ﬁeld
scaling is only approximated and not followed exactly.
In the constant electric ﬁeld scaling, the source voltages are decreased by a scale
factor k. Constant voltage scaling is a more practical application of the more ideal
method of constant electric ﬁeld scaling [2–5]. An important drawback of this tech-
nique is tehat by not scaling the supply voltage, higher ﬁelds are created in the device.
As a result, mobility degradation, hot carrier effects and other reliability problems
gain prominence.
A third technique is constant electrostatic scaling in which device dimensions are
reduced by the same factor k, but potentials are reduced by a different factor + = k0.5
[5]. In Ref. [6], off-current scaling is more complex in practice than the other tech-
niques. In this case the doping proﬁle characteristics are changed as in Refs [4–6]. All
scaling methods replicate long channel behavior in a short channel device. No scaling
technique provides an exact solution, and designing a device requires many iterations
and experience on the part of the designer. The best technique may be the combining
of one of the ﬁrst three methods with one or more of the latter two.
2.2 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
ITRS stands for International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Semicon-
ductor industry has been improving by reduced dimensions, leading to more transist-
ors per chip and faster functioning [7]. These scaling trends are enabled and preceded
by various research and development programs. National Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors was started by Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). In 1998
Europe, Japan, Korea and Taiwan joined with SIA and modiﬁed it to ITRS.
Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the United States of America are the ﬁve
main semiconductor chip manufacturing industries in the world. The top manufac-
turing organizations that sponsor ITRS are the European Semiconductor Industry
Association (ESIA), the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries As-
sociation (JEITA), the Korean Semiconductor Industry Association (KSIA), the Taiwan

Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA) and the United States Semiconductor
Industry Association (USSIA).
So ITRS is a set of documents that are produced by the group of semiconductor in-
dustry experts mentioned above. The documents cover factory integration, assembly
and packaging, system drivers design, modeling and simulation, microelectromech-
anical systems (MEMS), emerging research devices and so on.
2.3 Gate Oxide Scaling
Reduction of device dimensions is called scaling [8, 9]. There are two types of scal-
ing: constant ﬁeld scaling and constant voltage scaling. In case of the latter, the
terminal voltages are kept constant but the device dimensions are reduced. So the gate
lengths, oxide thickness, width of the device and so on are reduced by same amount in
case of constant voltage scaling. As the oxide thickness is reduced, the drain current
increases. Also hot carrier effect is reduced as a result.
2.4 Gate Leakage Current
As the oxide thickness is decreased, the leakage current through gate oxide increases
as in Figure 2.1. This causes increase in power dissipation. The cell phones require
lower current for longer battery lifetime. DRAM can be used for lower oxide leakage
current. However for DRAM, the oxide thickness cannot be below 3 nm, and below 0.1
nm scaling is difﬁcult.

26
2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
2.5 Mobility
When the oxide thickness is decreased, the vertical electric ﬁeld due to gate bias in-
creases and carriers are pulled toward the oxide–silicon interface. The mobility of
carriers reduces as a result of increased surface scattering. The scattering reduces the
carrier transport efﬁciency.
2.6 High-k Gate Dielectrics
As the SiO2 thickness is reduced with scaling, the gate tunneling current increases
and the undesirable hot carrier effect increases. To reduce the gate leakage current
high-k gate dielectrics are replacing the SiO2 layer [10]. As the dielectric constant of
high-k materials is high, in order to keep same gate capacitance, the thickness of the
material needs to be increased (Figure 2.2). So the leakage current decreases using
high-k materials.
2.7 Key Guidelines for Selecting an Alternative Gate Dielectric
The choice of high-k material to replace SiO2 as gate dielectric is based on the
following key factors:
(1)
Leakage current through the material
(2)
Reliability of the material
(3)
Quality of Si/material interface
(4)
Thermodynamic stability with respect to silicon
(5)
Material compatibility
2.8 Materials
The research is on for a suitable high-k material to replace SiO2 as gate dielectric. It is
seen that both HfO2 and ZrO2 are stable with silicon substrate and hence they replace

TiO2 and Ta2O5 as the dielectric material [11, 12]. Recently amorphous dielectric re-
places the polycrystalline form based on the uniformity argument. However, for the
amorphous dielectric, HfAlO2 replaces HfO2 since HfO2 crystallizes at relatively lower
temperature.
2.9 Gate Tunneling Current
As the oxide thickness is reduced due to scaling of MOSFET, the current tunneling
through the oxide increases as a result of increased vertical electric ﬁeld for a constant
gate bias [13, 14]. The gate current in Figure 2.3 increases exponentially with decrease
of oxide thickness. The gate tunneling current is very important for designing VLSI
circuits.
2.10 Gate Length Scaling
Reduction of device dimension is very important for increasing the number of tran-
sistors within a particular chip area. In case of gate length scaling, parameters related
to gate length are changed. If k be the scaling factor (Figure 2.4) such that k < 1, for the
gate length scaling, length of gate reduces from Lg to kLg after scaling. Also the gate
width Z reduces to kZ.
2.11 Introduction to Short Channel Effect in MOSFET
A MOSFET device is called short when the length of the channel is of the same order
as the depletion layer width at the source and the drain ends respectively. The various
short channel effects are as follows:

2.11.1 Reduction of Effective Threshold Voltage
The threshold voltage stands for the minimum value of the gate-to-source voltage
for creating the inversion layer in the channel region under the gate. As the chan-
nel length is decreased with scaling, the number of electrons from the n+ source and
drain regions accumulating under the gate increases and hence the effective threshold
voltage reduces with scaling [15]. This effect can be explained by a charge sharing
mechanism as in Figure 2.5. Due to this mechanism it is easier for the gate to deplete
the channel of mobile charges. The charge sharing effect is more important as the
channel length is decreased.
2.11.2 Drain-induced Barrier Lowering
It is seen that with reduction of channel length, the threshold voltage reduces with
scaling. Also as the drain-to-source voltage increases, the off-state current increases
as in Figure 2.6. This effect is called DIBL [16].

are the threshold voltages in the linear and the saturated operations, respectively.
2.11.3 Mobility Degradation and Surface Scattering
Mobility of a carrier is deﬁned as the average drift velocity of the carrier per electric
ﬁeld.
Let the drift velocity = Vd and electric ﬁeld = E.
So the mobility u = Vd/E
The reduction of mobility of a MOSFET is due to the following two electric
ﬁelds:
(a)
Vertical electric ﬁeld
(b)
Horizontal electric ﬁeld
2.11.3.1 Vertical Electric Field Mobility Degradation
When a positive gate voltage is applied to an n-channel MOSFET, a vertical electric
ﬁeld is created as in Figure 2.8. Due to a positive drain-to-source voltage, electrons
move from the source to the drain end. Due to the vertical electric ﬁeld, electrons are
attracted toward the oxide–semiconductor interface which is rough. As a result car-
riers lose mobility. The electrons moving from the source to the drain end undergo
surface scattering as a result of which mobility is degraded to a large extent. The
smaller the channel, the more is the surface scattering and lower is the mobility.
2.11.3.2 Horizontal Electric Field Mobility Degradation
The drain voltage induced electric ﬁeld Ey plays a signiﬁcant role in mobility degrad-
ation when compared to the gate voltage induced electric ﬁeld, as a result of velocity
saturation [17–20].
Carrier velocity v! Ey
So v = ,sEy where ,s = Mobility of surface electrons (Figure 2.9). When VDS is small,
velocity saturation of carriers takes place for short channel MOSFETs. Horizontal
mobility degradation takes place with horizontal electric ﬁeld.

1/LEffecrti = the drain bias mobility reduction parameter and often denoted as m1. The
electric ﬁeld ECrit is shown in Figure 2.9. For a large transistor, m1 < 1 and uH = u0.

32
2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
2.11.4 Surface Scattering
As the channel length is reduced in case of constant voltage scaling, the horizontal
and vertical components of the electric ﬁeld increase and hence the surface scattering
effect increases. This causes reduced value of mobility of electrons in the inversion
layer.
2.11.5 Hot Carrier Effect
Hot carrier stands for high energy electrons or holes that are accelerated due to the
high horizontal and vertical electric ﬁelds due to the gate and drain bias [17–20]. In
case of constant voltage scaling, as the channel length is reduced, the oxide thickness
also decreases, keeping the terminal voltages constant. So the vertical electric ﬁeld
increases due to scaling (Figure 2.10). The electrons are attracted toward the oxide–
silicon interface. Some of these high energy electrons overcome the oxide-silicon
potential barrier and get trapped in the oxide. These electrons are called hot electrons
and they degrade the performance of oxide (Figures 2.11 and 2.12).
2.11.6 Punch-through Effect
As the channel length is decreased with scaling, the depletion layers under the source
and drain overlap to form a single depletion layer. This causes a very large current to
ﬂow from the source to the drain with increasing drain bias (Figure 2.13).
2.11.7 Velocity Saturation Effect
As the dimension of MOSFET is reduced, the channel length and the oxide thickness
decrease. As a result, the horizontal and vertical electric ﬁelds increase. The drift
velocity of electrons being proportional to the electric ﬁeld should increase. However,

2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
with increase of electric ﬁelds the mobility degradation increases as in Refs [13, 15].
Due to this opposite effect, the velocity of electrons saturates at a high value.
The saturation drain current is given by

0
q ⋅n(x)dx = W ⋅vd(Sat) ⋅|QI|.
So
IDs(Sat) = W ⋅vd(Sat) ⋅COx ⋅VDsat.
2.11.8 Increase in Off-state Leakage Current
For long channel device, as distance between the source and the drain is very high,
positive VDS voltage is not able to attract carriers from the source under subthreshold
condition. But for short channel MOSFET, positive drain-to-source voltage attracts
more carriers from the source; so “OFF” state leakage current increases.
Due to the reduction of the threshold voltage for short channel MOSFET, the tran-
sistor leakage increases since a signiﬁcant subthreshold current occurs during the off
state of the transistor (Figure 2.14). This current has impact at the circuit level, since
it is a ﬁxed current contributing from all the devices in the off state. A subthreshold
current of 10 nA at VGS = 0 is negligibly small for a single device, but in a 100 million
transistor IC the impact on the overall power consumption is huge.
2.12 Motivation for Present Research
In short channel devices, some problems (commonly called short channel effects)
affect the performance of the devices. When the length of the channel decreases, the

fraction of charge in the channel region decreases. With increase of the drain bias, the
reverse biased space charge region at the drain end extends further into the channel
and the gate has less charge control. In case of a short channel MOSFET, the n+ source
and the drain regions induce an appreciable amount of the depletion charge. For a
short channel device, the channel charge is shared by the gate, substrate, source and
drain, called charge sharing. As a result, the source and drain depletion regions come
very close to one another.
For a long channel MOSFET the threshold voltage expression thus overestimates
the depletion charge supported by the gate voltage. So the gate voltage required to
offset the depletion charge will be less. Hence the estimated threshold voltage value
of long channel MOSFET will be greater than the actual value for a short channel
device [21]. As the depletion depth increases, the surface potential increases, making
the channel more attractive for electrons. So the device conduction current increases.
This effect causes reduction of the threshold voltage VTh as the drain current is a
function of (VGS-VTh) where VGS is the applied gate bias.
As the gate-oxide thickness is reduced, the oxide breakdown and the oxide reliab-
ility become a matter of concern. Many oxides having higher permittivity called high-k
dielectrics have been considered as alternate oxides to replace silicon dioxide as gate
dielectric. Avalanche breakdown is an undesirable short channel effect which occurs
due to the high velocity of electrons in the presence of a large longitudinal electric
ﬁeld, generating electron–hole pairs by impact ionization and subsequent ionization.
When the device length is reduced, the drain region moves closer to the source, and its
electric ﬁeld affects the whole channel. This effect is termed as drain-induced barrier
lowering or DIBL, since the drain lowers the potential barrier for the ﬂow of carriers
from the source end. The threshold voltage gets lowered as a result of this. Punch-
through occurs when the source and the drain depletion regions merge into a single
depletion region.
Velocity saturation occurs due to the mobility reduction and is important in the
submicron devices. The performance of short channel MOSFET is also affected by
the velocity saturation, leading to lowering of the transconductance in the saturation
mode. To sustain the continued density and performance increases, much of the at-
tention has turned to the modiﬁed device structures and to new materials – among
them high permittivity (“high-k”) gate dielectrics such as hafnium oxide (HfO2) to
replace SiO2.
2.12.1 Lightly Doped Drain Structure
It is a kind of graded structure commonly used as source/drain in submicron devices.
In this case, a lightly doped n-region (n-) is ﬁrst created by low energy P or As implant-
ation and then the oxide spacers are formed at the polysilicon gate sidewall. The oxide
spacers serve as a mask for the standard n+ As implant. The n+ implants diffuse under
the spacers to the edges of the gate.

36
2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
In an LDD structure, the channel side is doped less heavily to reduce the lateral
ﬁeld for the consideration of hot carrier effect. The channel extension has shallower
junction depth to reduce the detrimental short channel effects. With the introduc-
tion of an n-region between the drain and the channel, the peak channel electric
ﬁeld is not only shifted toward the drain end but is also decreased to about 80% of
the value for a conventional device. Due to the reduction and shift of the peak elec-
tric ﬁeld inside the drain region, carrier injection into the oxide is reduced resulting
in a more reliable device. This structure results in a higher breakdown voltage and
lower substrate current. It is to be noted that the overlap capacitance is also reduced,
resulting in a lower gate capacitance and higher speed. The raised source/drain struc-
ture is an advanced design where a heavily doped epitaxial layer is grown over the
source/drain regions. The purpose is to minimize junction depth to control the short
channel effects.
2.12.2 Channel Engineering Technique
The pocket doping (symmetrical and asymmetrical) at the two ends of a MOSFET can
suppress the short channel effects [22–25]. The structure of single halo MOSFET is
shown in Figure 2.15.
Some papers are already published focusing on the subthreshold behavior of
pocket implanted MOSFET [26–29]. In Ref. [6], models for the subthreshold and
the super-threshold currents in sub-100 nm pocket n-MOSFETs for low voltage
applications are calculated based on the diffusion current transport equation. The
double halo (DH) and the dual material gate (DMG) devices suppress the short channel
effects quite efﬁciently [30, 31]. In case of the DH an extra pocket region at the drain
end is added (Figure 2.16) along with that at the source end as in the case of single halo
(LAC) devices. Both the pockets are symmetrical [32, 33]. Most signiﬁcant advantage is
that the heavy doping at the drain end restricts the drain ﬁeld from penetration into

the source region. Due to heavy pocket doping it can absorb more electric ﬁeld lines
from the drain region, as a result of which the short channel effects are reduced.
The DIBL effect can be reduced by increasing the substrate doping concentration
at the edges of the source and the drain junctions, which are called halos. With de-
crease of channel length for halo devices, the average channel doping concentration
increases [34]. So the threshold voltage increases when the gate length is reduced,
called the “reverse short-channel effect”. When the gate length is reduced, the short
channel effect becomes dominant and the threshold voltage falls off [35]. This can be
reversed by locally increasing the channel doping next to the drain or drain/source
junctions. Experiments are carried out with halo structures over the last decade. It is
seen that VTh of all devices decreases as VDS increases, but the amount of VTh drop as
a result of DIBL effect is very low in the pocket-implanted devices. This phenomenon
is very important for a short channel device, in which the short channel behavior is
unacceptable without lateral channel engineering [36–38].
2.12.3 Gate Engineering Technique
A DMG MOSFET is one in which the gate material is made of two different metals with
different work functions. A step potential proﬁle is formed in the channel and the
electron drift velocity is increased as a result. However, the various short channel ef-
fects are reduced considerably [39] in this case as the control of gate voltage increases
compared to the drain one [26, 27, 40, 41].
2.12.4 Single Halo Dual Material Gate MOSFET
In this case a small region with very high positive doping concentration is considered
at the source end along with the gate material, made of two different metals with

different work functions (Figure 2.17). The work function corresponding to the ﬁrst
metal is greater than that corresponding to the second. So although the small pos-
itively doped pocket leads to reduced drain current, the DMG structure increases it.
The net result is that the drain current is increased in case of single halo dual material
gate (SHDMG) MOSFET. However, the control of gate voltage is increased and the short
channel effects are reduced using this structure [40–42]. It is seen that such structures
work well for channel lengths up to 40 nm.
2.12.5 Double Halo Dual Material Gate MOSFET
In case of DH MOSFET, two small heavy pocket doping regions are considered at the
two ends. These regions absorb a large number of electrons, and hence, the drain
current is signiﬁcantly reduced considering two halo regions. However, in case of
Double Halo Dual Material Gate (DHDMG) MOSFET, the gate material is consisted of
two different metals with different work functions [42]. This creates a step proﬁle in
the channel and the drain current is increased as compared to DH case (Figure 2.18).
In subthreshold regime, such a structure is very effective in suppressing short channel
effects.
2.12.6 Double Gate MOSFET
In this case there is a very thin Si layer for a channel, with two gates electrically con-
nected, one on each side of the channel. Short channel effects are greatly suppressed
in such a structure since the two gates very effectively terminate the drain electric ﬁeld
lines, preventing the effect of the drain potential from being felt at the source end.

The variation of the threshold voltage with the drain potential and the gate length of a
double gate MOSFET is much less than that of a conventional single gate structure of
the same channel length [43–46].
The double gate MOSFET structure as given in Figure 2.19 shows a second gate
electrode at the opposite side of the thin silicon body. It has two channels at the top
and the bottom of the device and is reported to be relatively free of short channel
effects.
Due to the two gates in Figure 2.20, the gate control of the channel increases. How-
ever, the double gate MOSFET structure is yet to be used in the manufacture of IC due
to its signiﬁcant fabrication problems. Simulations have been carried out for a 30 nm
channel length double gate nMOSFET in Refs [43–46]. Very fast switching times of the
order of 1–2 ps are observed in existing research works.

2.12.7 Dual Material Double Gate MOSFET
In this case gate engineering is applied to a double gate MOSFET [47] as in Figure 2.21.
The gate material is made of two metals with different work functions. The work func-
tion of the ﬁrst metal is higher than that of the second. So a step potential proﬁle is

formed and the electrons have to overcome it for reaching the drain. The two gates
effectively terminate the electric ﬁeld lines from the drain as a result of the drain bias.
So the effect of drain bias on the electrons at the source end is greatly reduced. The
short channel effects are greatly suppressed as a result [48, 49].
2.12.8 Triple Material Double Gate MOSFET
In this case the gate material is made of three metals with different work functions
[50–53]. The work function of the ﬁrst metal near the source end is highest while that
near the drain end is least. The work function of the metal in between is intermediate
between the high value and the low one as in Figure 2.22. Two step potential proﬁles
are created as a result. This structure is expected to provide further improvement in the
performance over double gate and the DMDG MOSFET structures due to the two steps
present in the surface potential proﬁle. It is seen that the triple-material double gate
(TMDG) MOSFET with a large ratio of L1:L2:L3 can provide better suppression of SCEs.
Therefore, it is concluded that a TMDG structure outperforms other gate-engineered
SOI MOSFET device structures in suppressing the undesirable short channel effects.
2.12.9 FinFET
The FinFET consists of a channel formed in a vertical silicon ﬁn controlled by a self-
aligned double gate as shown in Figure 2.23. When the ﬁns are viewed from the top,
they are made thin enough such that the two gates control the entire fully depleted
channel. The FinFET is similar to the conventional planar MOSFET in the layout and

the fabrication. It provides a range of channel lengths, CMOS compatibility and large
packing density compared to other double gate structures. n-channel FinFETs show
good short channel performance down to a gate length of 17 nm. These results indicate
that the FinFET is a promising device structure for future CMOS technology [54, 55].
Advantage of FinFET is that the fabrication in this case is a less complex process
than double gate MOSFET and is very compatible with the current techniques.

2.12 Motivation for Present Research

2.12.10 Triple Gate MOSFET
Such structures have three effective gates. Intel ﬁrst introduced them to increase tran-
sistor switching performance and decrease leakage power dissipation. They showed
that using triple gate transistors increases the operating speed by 37% and reduces
the power dissipation by 50% of the earlier values of transistor.
Such structures are basically FinFETs with active top gate. A single gate controls
two vertical sections and one horizontal in the channel. The gate dielectric must be
equally thin on the three sides of the body. The magnitude of the current can be
changed by altering the ﬁn width.
Such a triple gate structure allows thrice the surface area for electrons to travel.
The additional gate control increases the amount of current ﬂow during the on state
and reduce the current to as close to zero as possible during the off state. So the overall
transient response of the device improves. The reduced leakage current for such types
of devices leads to reduction of overall power consumption.
2.12.11 Gate-all-around MOSFET
The Gate-all-around (GAA) structure in Ref. [56] is similar to the vertical surround-
ing gate (SRG) MOSFET. They are thin, fully depleted SOI MOSFETs consisting of two
gates. These devices possess several advantages like low leakage current, minimum
threshold voltage shift and better characteristics when compared with bulk and SOI
MOSFETs.
The gate control over the channel increases for such devices and the overall
device performance improves. In such devices the gate oxide and the gate are wrapped
around the channel. First a silicon rod is patterned on the buried oxide layer for fab-
ricating GAA. Then the undercut is formed underneath the rod by wet etching using
HF. Then the polysilicon gate wraps the silicon channel. Finally, the gate is patterned
and the S/D regions are using ion implantation.
These devices show increased transconductance due to volume inversion. The
threshold voltage variation with temperature is least, allowing the device to operate
at higher temperatures. The leakage current is far less compared to other MOSFETs
resulting in excellent output swing. Such devices are quite immune against radi-
ation effect. In terms of the packing density, the GAA MOSFET is less efﬁcient when
compared with SRG or VRG (vertical surrounding gate) MOSFETs.
2.12.12 Surrounding Gate MOSFET
As semiconductor devices are scaled down to the sub-0.1 ,m regime, gate oxide
tunneling and several lithographic issues become paramount in further scaling.
SRG MOSFETs fabricated on SOI substrates have shown promise in overcoming the

short channel effects [57, 58]. The physical structure of SRG MOSFETs is shown in
Figure 2.24.
Electrical lines of force from drain end are totally absorbed by the SRG structure.
So drain control is totally eliminated and such structures provide best control over the
channel from all around.
Figure 2.25 (1, () represents the cylindrical coordinate. The threshold voltage of a
SRG MOSFET is governed by the oxide thickness (tOx) and the radius of the cylinder
(R). A MOSFET will have larger threshold voltage for a thinner oxide or smaller radius.
To obtain a desired threshold voltage we have to choose the right material for the gate
[57, 58].
2.12.13 Silicon Nanowires
An alternative to planar MOSFET structure that is being explored is the surrounding
gate nanowire MOSFET. The SRG nanowire transistor gives better performance than
single gate device. A detailed study of SCEs for SRG nanaowire MOSFETs using device
modeling is highly essential to obtain a deeper understanding of various physical

2.14 Silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs
45
effects. It is also important to consider quantum effects in SRG MOSFET models as the
quantum conﬁnement effects start to become signiﬁcant when silicon ﬁlm thickness
is smaller than 10 nm [59–62].
It is very important to accurately predict the RF performance of SRG nanowires
with downscaling.
2.13 Fringing-induced Barrier Lowering
Increased gate leakage is one major limiting factor on aggressive scaling of gate
dielectric for deep-submicron CMOS technology [63–65]. Search has been on for a
suitable high-k dielectric, which can replace the silicon dioxide. However, this gives
rise to signiﬁcant fringing capacitances, consisting of gate-dielectric fringing capa-
citance between gate electrode bottom and the source/drain surface and the gate
electrode fringing capacitance between the gate electrode edge and the source/drain
surface. Both these effects affect the electrical characteristics and degrade the short
channel performance of MOSFET as they increase the fringing ﬁeld from the gate
to the source/drain regions. Recently, conformal mapping transformation was em-
ployed to model the fringing parasitic capacitance [63–65]. The fringing-induced
barrier lowering (FIBL) is demonstrated through the effect of charges induced by the
fringing capacitances. The results show that the fringing capacitances increase with
the k-value of the gate dielectric or thickness of the gate electrode. The fringing ca-
pacitances can also impact the threshold voltage of the device. The effect of fringing
capacitances increases as the device is continuously scaled down. So these ﬁelds need
to be incorporated in the analytical models in order to get a perfect estimation of the
characteristic parameters like surface potential, threshold voltage and drain current
of the deep submicron devices.
2.14 Silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs
In this case a thin layer of silicon is fabricated on top of an insulator. The thin layer
of silicon is separated from the p-type substrate by a thick layer of buried SiO2 [66].
The thickness of the silicon ﬁlm typically ranges between 50 and 200 nm, while the
buried oxide thickness is 80–400 nm. For thin ﬁlm silicon, the depletion region under
the gate extends through the buried oxide and the device is called “fully depleted”.
Otherwise the transistor is said to be “partially depleted”.
The advantages of SOI MOSFETs over the conventional ones are as follows:
(1)
SOI circuits consist of single-device islands dielectrically isolated from each
other and from the underlying substrate. The lateral isolation offers more com-
pact design and the simpliﬁed technology than in the bulk silicon.
(2)
The current in SOI MOSFETs is higher than that of bulk devices.
(3)
The advantages of the SOI substrate include the improved MOSFET scaling due
to its thin body.

46
2 Scaling and Short Channel Effects in MOSFET
(4)
The buried oxide layer serves as good isolation to reduce capacitance to the
substrate, giving rise to higher speed.
(5)
Device isolation is much easier, simply by removing the surrounding “thin ﬁlm”.
This can signiﬁcantly improve the circuit density.
(6)
The limited extension of drain and source regions allows SOI devices to be less
affected by short channel effects, originated from “charge sharing” between gate
and junctions.
The disadvantages of SOI are higher wafer cost, the kink effect and worse heat
conduction because of the oxide layer.
2.15 Nonconventional Double Gate MOSFETs
VLSI technology focuses on miniaturization of device dimensions in order to in-
corporate large number of devices on a single chip. With further development and
enhancement of this technology, the need for shrinking device dimensions will sub-
stantially increase. However, this shrinking of device dimensions leads to undesirable
short channel effects like hot electron effect, DIBL and so on. To solve these effects
and to facilitate the production of very large-scale integrated circuits, engineering
techniques like channel engineering and gate engineering are used. In channel engin-
eering technique halo implants like single halo and DH are induced in the MOSFETs
that help negate the adverse short channel effects. It helps achieve better control
over threshold voltage. Further gate engineering techniques are used to amalgamate
two different metals M1 and M2 with work functions >1 and >2, laterally in a gate to
reduce DIBL.
The combination of these techniques can be further utilized to lower hot electron
effects. And ﬁnally, the use of double gates helps to achieve better control over the
potential barrier between the source and drain terminals. Previous research work have
included the 2-D modeling of subthreshold surface potential for short channel single
gate dual material double halo (SGDMDH) MOSFETs and double gate dual material
double halo (DGDMDH) MOSFET by solving pseudo 2D Poisson’s equation.
However, the focus has been on modeling and design of double gate single mater-
ial double halo (DGSMDH) MOSFET, double gate dual material single halo (DGDMSH)
MOSFET and double gate single material single halo (DGSMSH) MOSFET based on
the study and previous research work done on DGDMDH MOSFET. In recent work the
pseudo 2-D Poisson’s equation for DGDMDH MOSFET has been modiﬁed to suit the
model description for the DGSMDH, DGDMSH and DGSMSH MOSFETs. The compar-
ative study and analysis of these models on surface potential versus channel length
can go a long way in determining which model serves the best to reduce the short
channel effects for high density integration in the VLSI industry. Moreover, vari-
ation of parameters like VDS (drain-to-source voltage), Na (acceptor concentration)

2.15 Nonconventional Double Gate MOSFETs

and work function have been carried out and plots have been simulated to simplify
and efﬁciently focus on the characteristics that need to be taken care of before device
designing. The effect of using multiple gates, multiple gate materials and multiple
halo implants and their efﬁciency in reducing the undesirable short channel effect is
the major theme of our analysis.
DGSMDH MOSFET
Here we discuss and compare the models and calculate the surface potentials for four
devices namely double halo double material double gate (DHDMDG) MOSFET, double
halo single material double gate (DHSMDG) MOSFET, single halo double material
double gate (SHDMDG) MOSFET and single halo single material double gate (SHS-
MDG) MOSFET. This discussion with their varied changes will help to compare and
analyze the potential and other features of the respective devices (Figure 2.26).

Let us consider an elementary rectangular Gaussian surface. The rectangular box of
length Bx, at a given x, covers the entire depletion region width yd and w is the gate
width as shown in Figure 2.28. We use a pseudo 2D analysis because the analytical
solution of 2D Poisson’s equation, though accurate, is highly complicated. Since the
device has two gates, the vertical electric ﬁeld components Ey1 on the top or front side
and Ey2 on the bottom or back side are both non-zero. So we can obtain Ey1 and Ey2
from the potential balance equations as follows:
VGbf = VFbf + 8s + 8Ox
for the front side and
(2.1)
VGbb = VFbb + 8s + 8Ox
for the back side.
(2.2)
We deﬁne surface potential Js as the potential drop from the surface to the bulk out-
side the depletion region, JOx as potential drop across oxide layer, VGbf as the front
gate bias voltage, VGbb as back gate bias voltage, VFbf and VFbb are the ﬂat band
voltages under front and back gates, respectively.
The ﬂux lines terminating on the interface change per unit area Q0 will not
contribute the same since it is modeled as effective interface charge which resides on
the oxide side of the interface. Thus only ﬂux lines terminating on Qc will contribute
the same and for an oxide thickness of tOx, the corresponding vertical ﬁeld can be
obtained as
Ey1 = VGbf – VFbf – 8s

In weak inversion, the inversion layer charge can be ignored. For a substrate dop-
ing of Na, the total depletion charge due to the ionized acceptor atoms within the

For short DHSMDG MOSFET, there is nonuniformity in yd due to the two junctions,
metal and the two halo regions [68–71]. The depletion layer depth around the source
and the drain junctions is a complex function of substrate doping, drain and source
bias voltages and junction depth. The surface potential depends on depletion layer
thickness, which is not constant. So yd(x) is modeled ﬁrst for predicting the surface
potential accurately [68, 69, 71]. If the channel length is not too small and a reasonable
amount of voltage is applied to the source or drain, yd(x) varies with x (Figure 2.29).

The channel is divided into ﬁve different regions.
The boundary values of the potential are as follows:
At x1 = 0, position of channel length voltage,
V1 = VBi + VSb.
(2.24)
At x7 = 0, position of channel length voltage,
V7 = VBi + VDb,

VBi = Eg

Surface potential can be easily calculated by substituting the values of V2, V3, V4, V5
and V6.
Comparative study and various MATLAB7.0.1 simulations have been presented
below to focus on the improvement over the previously existing models and choose
the best out of the newly designed ones. Varying device parameters and biasing con-
ditions have been used for these models to portray the surface potential proﬁles and
make the comparative analysis easier.
The plot in Figure 2.30 compares the surface potential for DHDMDG, SHDMDG,
SMDGDH and SHSMDG MOSFETs [71]. The value of Na is 4 × 1017, VGS is 0 V and the
length of the device L is taken as 30 × 10–7. The plots show that the surface potential
decreases from SMDHDG to SHSMDG to DMDHDG to SHDMDG.
The plot in Figure 2.31 shows the variation of VDS for values 0.5 V, 1 V and 1.5 V
for DGDMDH MOSFET. The value of Na is 4 × 1017, VGS is 0 V and the length of the
device L is taken as 30 × 10–7. With this variation, the surface potential decreases from
VDS = 1.5 V to VDS = 1.0 V to VDS = 0.5 V.
The plot in Figure 2.32 shows the variation of VDS for values 0.5 V, 1 V and 1.5 V
for DGSMDH MOSFET. The value of Na is 4 × 1017, VGS is 0 V and the length of the
device L is taken as 30 × 10–7. With this variation, the surface potential decreases
from VDS = 1.5 V to VDS = 1.0 V to VDS = 0.5 V.

The plot in Figure 2.33 shows the variation of VDS for values 0.5 V, 1 V and 1.5 V for
DGDMSH MOSFET. The value of Na is 4 × 1017, VGS is 0 V and the length of the device
L is taken as 30 × 10–7. With this variation, the surface potential decreases from VDS =
1.5 V to VDS = 1.0 V to VDS= 0.5 V.
The plot in Figure 2.34 shows the variation of Na for values 2 × 1015, 4 × 10e17
and 9 × 10e18 for DGDMDH MOSFET. The value of VGS is 0 V, and the length of the
device L is taken as 30 × 10–7. With this variation, the surface potential decreases
from Na = 9 × 10e18 to Na = 4 × 10e17 to 2 × 10e15.
In this work the main focus has been on modeling the surface potential of vari-
ous short channel MOSFETs. The characteristics are affected by the depletion layer
formation near the source and the drain regions. The analytical modeling has been
done by solving the pseudo-2D Poisson’s equation and applying Gauss’s law to the
same, and thereby solving it. The same procedure has been applied for various struc-
tures of double gate MOSFETs like Double Gate Dual Material Double Halo (DGDMDH),
DGSMDH, DGDMSH and DGSMSH MOSFETs.
2.16 Tunnel Field-effect Transistor
The tunnel ﬁeld-effect transistor (TFET) has structure almost similar to that of MOS-
FET. However, the switching mechanism of this transistor is different from that of
conventional MOSFET, making this device candidate for low power electronics. In this

case, the basic principle is that of quantum tunneling through a potential barrier, un-
like in case of conventional MOSFET, where thermionic emission over the potential
barrier is the driving force behind electron transmission. As a result, subthreshold
swing of TFETs goes below 60 mV/dec at room temperature [72–74]. Joerg Appen-
zeller in 2004 reported that a TFET with channel made of carbon nanotube can give
subthreshold swing as low as 40 mV per decade. It is also observed that use of low
power TFETs can lead to considerable saving of power when compared to conventional
MOSFETs. The basic structure of TFET is shown below:
It is seen from Figure 2.35 that the source and drain regions are oppositely doped
[75–78]. The gate terminal controls the ﬂow of electrons. The higher the on-current,
the more is the speed of transistor. The lowering of threshold voltage is very important
for constant ﬁeld scaling. For constant voltage scaling, the supply voltage cannot be
scaled down with lowering of device dimensions. This leads to reduction of processor
speed with scaling. However, TFET with a slope far below 63 mV/dec permits scaling
of device dimensions with increase in processor frequency. In TFETs with increase in
voltage, accumulation of electron occurs in the intrinsic region of the device. When
the valence band of the p-region and the conduction band of the intrinsic region get
aligned due to the band tunneling effect in TFET, electrons ﬂow from the valence band
of p-region to the conduction band, leading to ﬂow of current in the device. When
the gate voltage is reduced, the two bands become misaligned and current cannot

ﬂow through the device. Recently double gate TFET structures have been proposed by
researchers to overcome the limitations of lateral TFET structures like requirement of
very sharp doping proﬁle, large gate leakage, etc.
2.17 IMOS Device
The conventional MOSFETs suffer from the limitation of achieving low subthreshold
slope. This is due to the inherent property of the conventional MOS devices that
the transport phenomenon is based on the diffusion process. The need of achieving
steeper SS for the high switching applications become imminent, unlike in case of the
conventional devices. In this device [79, 80] the carrier transport phenomena is im-
pact ionization based. IMOS can achieve SS as low as 5 mV/decade and IOn/IOff of 107.
Due to impact-ionization-based avalanche breakdown, the device can easily switch
from on state to off state. The off-state leakage current also decreases and this leads to
improvement in suppression of the SCEs.
Till now, different versions of the device like depletion-IMOS, IMOS transistor with
lower breakdown voltage and higher impact ionization area, and so on have been re-
ported in various literatures [81, 82]. The device is basically a gated PIN diode. In this
case, the depletion region extends up to the i region; therefore, the electric ﬁeld along
the horizontal direction will be lower. Therefore the avalanche multiplication process
will dominate and desirable SS characteristics can be obtained.
2.18 Summary
It is seen that for continuing the scaling of MOSFET as per the ITRS, conventional
device structures cannot be used due to the short channel effects. This chapter deals
with the challenges of device scaling. The halo and DMG structures can suppress short

66

channel effects in the 70 nm gate length regime. It is also seen that the combination
of halo and DMG can suppress SCEs effectively up to a gate length of around 40 nm.
However, when the device is scaled down further the nonconventional structures like
double gate, GAA, FinFET, SRG and so on can be used. It is found that the introduc-
tion of the DMG structure in a fully depleted SOI double gate MOSFET leads to reduced
SCEs due to a step function in the channel potential proﬁle, thereby improving device
performance and enhancing device scalability some steps further. Among all gate-
engineered structures, TM-DG MOSFET structure outperforms other gate-engineered
structure due to its enhanced gate transport efﬁciency resulting from the two steps
present in the surface potential proﬁle. It is seen that the SRG transistor exhibited im-
proved performance than traditional single gate devices. Therefore, it is envisioned as
a future replacement of silicon planar MOSFETs in digital circuits and is a potential
candidate for providing long-term solutions to continue scaling CMOS beyond the 100
nm technology node. On the other hand, the double gate MOS transistor with the triple
material gate technology with its higher carrier transport efﬁciency and SRG MOSFET
with its best electrostatic gate control over the channel shows improved analog/RF
performance parameters compared to that of the conventional MOSFET architecture
and thus may be suitable to realize the low cost and high performance analog/RF
mixed signal SoC applications in the sub-100 nm regime.

3 Advanced Energy-reduced CMOS Inverter Design
3.1 Introduction
In digital integrated circuit (IC), inverters, which can complement the logic level of
input signal, are the fundamental logic gate doing Boolean operation also. Ideally as
inverter has inﬁnite input resistance and zero output resistance, it can be used for ana-
log ampliﬁcation also if we set the operating point in transition region. In this chapter
we will concentrate on the basic digital operation of complementary metal oxide semi-
conductor (CMOS) inverter circuit and the different issues like power dissipation,
delay, noise margin, area etc., in super-threshold region and then in subthreshold
region [1–10].
3.1.1 Transfer Characteristics of Inverter
In this section ﬁrst we analyze the ideal inverter and then the practical CMOS inverter
circuit in detail in the next section.
In Figure 3.1, input and output waveform and voltage transfer characteristics of
ideal inverter circuit are given. When we apply logic “0” (equivalent to zero volt) or
logic “1” (equivalent to supply voltage VDD volt) to an inverter, we will obtain the re-
verse logic in output node. It can be observed from the transfer characteristics of ideal
inverter, if any input voltage, lying in the range of 0 to VDD/2 volt, i.e. low logic; we get
VDD volt or high logic at output node. Similarly, VDD/2 to VDD volt range is considered
as logic high level, which, when applied to the ideal inverter, produces 0 or logic “0”
level at output. In case of ideal operation as delay is absent during switching, voltage
transfer characteristics will rise vertically straight at VDD/2, which shows inﬁnite gain
in transition region. This property is efﬁcacious for analog ampliﬁcation if we drive
the inverter circuit in transition region. Ideal inverter is capable of restoring the logic

In practical operation, switching threshold voltage shifts from ideal position,
i.e. VDD/2, as given in Figure 3.2. Due to nonzero noise margin, transition region be-
comes less stepper or gain becomes ﬁnite. The characteristics parameters of VTC,
given in Figure 3.3, can be deﬁned as follows:
–
VOh: High o/p voltage
–
VOl: Low o/p voltage
–
VM: Switching threshold voltage
–
VIh: Minimum input voltage for logic “1” range
–
VIl: Maximum input voltage for logic “0” range

In case of ideal inverter circuit, the above-mentioned transfer characteristic paramet-
ers will have the following values:
VOh = VDD and VOl = 0,
(3.1)
VIh = VIl = VDD/2,
(3.2)
NMH = NML = VDD/2.
(3.3)
So NM becomes zero in case of ideal inverter circuit. NMH and NML also become less
than VDD/2, and noise margin becomes nonzero, as given in Figure 3.2. Also switching
threshold voltage deviates from the ideal value, i.e. VDD/2; by BV amount, where BV is
small voltage drop.
3.1.2 Static CMOS Inverter in Super-threshold Regime
3.1.2.1 Structure and Operation
In 1963, Frank Wanlass at Fairchild described CMOS logic gate to us, but it was widely
accepted after two decades of invention. CMOS [3–10] is considered as the most power-
ful transistor topology for minimum speed, cost per function and power dissipation
per function. CMOS structure consists of pMOS and nMOS transistors, which are also
complement to each other from the structural or operational point of view. In CMOS
logic gate structure has two complementary network: pull-up network (PUN) and pull-
down network (PDN), as given in Figure 3.4(a). Here we consider that logic “1” and
logic “0” as supply voltage and ground. When we apply the low logic inputs (≈0), PUN
turns on and PDN remains off. Under this situation, VDD or logic “1” passes through
the PUN to output load, and we obtain logic “1” as output. This situation is given in
Figure 3.4(b). So PUN raises or pulls up the output voltage level to logic “1” under on
condition. Similarly for high inputs (≈supply voltage) PDN turns on and PUN turns
off. Then PDN passes the logic “0” from ground to output node. This situation is given
in Figure 3.4(c). So PDN lowers or pulls down the output voltage level from logic “1”
to logic “0” under on condition. As PUN and PDN are used to pass logic “1” and logic
“0”, respectively, we use pMOS and nMOS transistor, respectively, to construct them.
In a CMOS inverter single pMOS and nMOS transistors replace the PUN and PDN,
as shown in Figure 3.5. pMOS (MP) and nMOS (MN) connect the output node with the
supply voltage and ground, respectively. Hence VDD and ground are taken as logic “1”
and logic “0”, respectively. The gate terminals of MP and MN are common, considered
as the input of inverter, where we apply the input. Similarly the drain terminals of
MP and MN are common, considered as the output, from where we measure the out-
put. These charging and discharging operations are given in Figure 3.4 (b) and 3.4(c),
respectively. The output and input waveforms of a CMOS inverter circuit are given

in Figure 3.6. Hence under 1 volt supply voltage, we are almost getting full swing in
output node, so VOh = 1 volt and VOl = 0 volt.
When we apply low input (VI = 0), MP is turned on and MN is turned off. The
output node is charged up and the node voltage rises to supply voltage (logic “1”)
level through the pMOS transistor completely. As MN is turned off, output remains at
logic “1” state. Similarly, when we apply high input (VI = VDD) volt, input MN is turned
on and MP is turned off. So the output node is discharged through the MN transistor
completely, produces logic “0” output. When MP is on, MN will be off. To understand

To turn on nMOS or pMOS, the conditions are VGS,n ≥VTn or VSG,p ≥|VTp|, respectively.
When input switches from high to low, pMOS and nMOS transistors are turned off and
on, respectively. Similarly the nMOS turns on and the pMOS turns off as the input
level goes high. Rn and Rp, the turn on resistance of pMOS and nMOS transistor, can
be expressed as

respectively; IDx is the drain current of X (X = pMOS/nMOS). Drain currents of X
(X = pMOS/nMOS) transistor in a complete cycle is given in Figure 3.8 using CADENCE
simulation, considering 1 volt supply voltage. pMOS and nMOS currents have almost
same magnitude but they are opposite in direction. Peak amplitude of the drain cur-
rent, for pMOS or nMOS, is approximately 48 ,A for 1 volt supply voltage in 22 nm
technology.
3.1.2.2 Noise Margin Calculation
The VTC of the CMOS inverter [11–16] can be divided into ﬁve different regions
according to Figure 3.7. The regions are as follows:
–
Region 1: 0 ≤VIn < VTn
–
Region 2: VTn ≤VIn ≤VIl
–
Region 3: VIl < VIn < VIh

Region 4: VIh ≤VIn < VDD –

Region 5: VDD –
VTp
 ≤VIn ≤VDD
Depending on the input conditions, the operating regions of the pMOS and nMOS
transistors in these ﬁve regions are given in Table 3.1.
Region 1 In region 1, due to cutoff mode of nMOS, IDp = IDn = 0. Hence the output
voltage is equivalent to supply voltage (VDD) as the voltage drop across the pull-up
path is negligibly small. So VOh = VDD.
Region 2 When input voltage crosses the threshold of nMOS (VTn), current ﬂow starts
through the resistive path of PUN or PDN. Here pMOS remains in linear region but
nMOS enters in the saturation. Due to nonzero current ﬂow through the pull-up or
pull-down path, voltage drop increases across the path; resultantly, output voltage
decreases from maximum value. As IDp = IDn, we get the following:

Region 3 In region 3, pMOS and nMOS transistors both operate in saturation region.
Output voltage drops rapidly as current reaches its maximum point in this transition
region, providing very high gain. If we set the operating point in region 3, very high
ampliﬁcation or gain can be obtained. So inverter can be used as an analog ampliﬁer if
we set the operating point in the transition region. Equating the drain current of both
transistors, we get

3.1 Introduction

So width of pMOS transistor is widened to match the resistance of nMOS by 3
to 3.5 times, or the effective resistances of PUN and PDN are matched completely,
which provides symmetric propagation delays. It can be said clearly that as r varies,
switching threshold voltage of the inverter also shifts. Wider pMOS shifts the switch-
ing threshold upward (more than VDD/2), whereas if we increase the strength of the
nMOS, switching threshold voltage moves closer to GND. For inverter circuit, layout
and VTC using CADENCE SPICE spectra are shown in Figures 3.9 and 3.10. Layout
of inverter circuit is useful to estimate the parasitic capacitances as well as intrinsic
capacitances accurately.
Region 4 Here pMOS operates in saturation region but nMOS enters in linear region.
We get the following equations after equating the drain currents:

Region 5 When the input voltage crosses (VDD-|VTp|) point, pMOS transistor is turned
off, whereas the nMOS remains in previous active region and drags small amount of
current from supply voltage. As input is set to high logic, pull-down path becomes act-
ive, setting the output node at ground potential. Output node discharges completely
through the nMOS transistor. So VOl = 0. The sizing parameter plays the most im-
portant role in the operation of CMOS inverter. By setting r = 1, we almost get the
ideal operation as VTh becomes VDD/2. From eqs. (3.11) and (3.18), the noise margin
of the CMOS inverter can be derived easily. In case of symmetrical inverter NMH and
NML, both are almost equal to (3VDD + 2VTh)/8, as VIh and VIl can be approximated as
(5VDD – 2VTh)/8 and (3VDD + 2VTh)/8, respectively.
However, noise margin [13–17] also depends on this sizing parameter strictly.
If r increases NML increases and NMH decreases. Similarly, if r decreases, then
NMH increases and NML decreases. Variation of transfer characteristics curve under

different value of r is given in Figure 3.11. Here r(2) is nominal, i.e. ( W
L )p = ( W
L )n. But
we choose r(1) and r(3), where the relations between the aspect ratios are ( W
L )p > ( W
L )n
and ( W
L )p < ( W
L )n, respectively. Changing the aspect ratio from the nominal value can
shift the transition region.
3.1.2.3 Delay of CMOS Inverter
Propagation delay [18–28] of the CMOS inverter is mainly due to the charging and
discharging of the load capacitor. Estimation of load capacitance [19, 21] is most im-
portant in delay calculation, as delay depends on load directly. So here we ﬁrst ﬁnd
out the effective load capacitance of an inverter and then will discuss the propagation
delay in depth.
Figure 3.12 details the component of capacitive load. The components are CGd,p
(gate to drain capacitance of pMOS), CGd,n (gate to drain capacitance of nMOS), CBd,p
(body to drain capacitance of pMOS) CBd,n (body to drain capacitance of pMOS), CW
(wiring capacitance) and CG (and interconnect input capacitance of the next stage)
mainly. Here CGd,p or CGd,n are mainly overlap capacitances of pMOS or nMOS, respect-
ively. Body to drain capacitances which is nonlinear in nature is due to reverse-biased
pn-junction. Due to interconnects, different length and width of connecting wires
also wiring capacitance grows and will be a component of output load capacitance.
Gate capacitance of next stage is also taken into account to consider the number of
fan-out gates. Above-mentioned effects can be combined to get the net output load
capacitance as

TPhl or high-to-low propagation delay can be deﬁned by the time gap between the
50% transition of the rising input voltage and the falling output voltage. Similarly
TPlh or low-to-high propagation delay is the time gap between the 50% transition of
the falling input voltage and the rising output voltage. These propagation delays are
given in Figure 3.13. Average propagation delay is the average of these TPhl and TPlh.

3.1 Introduction
83
SPICE simulation can be done to measure the delay accurately. If we want to ﬁnd out
the analytical expression of propagation delay, we need to integrate the discharging
current going through the output node capacitance. To make the solution of differ-
ential equation little bit easier, we estimate the ﬁrst-order delay ﬁrst. When output
node discharges to zero potential, nMOS lies in linear region. Assuming the turn-on
resistance of pull-up path and the output load as RN and CL, respectively, low-to-high
propagation delay can be calculated as
TPlh = (ln 2)RNCL.

Average propagation delay will be the average of TPhl and TPlh. From eqs. (3.28) and
(3.30), it can be said that the propagation delay depends on load capacitance, sup-
ply voltage and the aspect ratios of the transistors mainly. Normalized delay under
different supply voltage is given in Figure 3.15. It can be said from Figure 3.15 that to
enhance the performances we need to increase the supply voltage to reduce the delay.
Then other issues like oxide breakdowns, hot electron effects, power dissipations, etc.,

will start to deteriorate the performance of the circuit. So we need to choose some op-
timum supply voltage for which the product of delay and power dissipation becomes
minimum. This will be discussed in the next section in depth. From eqs. (3.28) and

(3.32)
Effect of the aspect ratios of pMOS and nMOS in CMOS inverter can be explained using
the CADENCE simulation, as given in Figure 3.16. Larger transconductance parameter
and aspect ratio of the MOSFETs increases the performances. Low-to-high propagation
delay can be reduced by widening the pMOS transistor or increasing the charging cur-
rent, but it may cause larger parasitic capacitance. Indeed larger width of the device
increases the gate capacitances and increases fan-out, which can deteriorate the per-
formances. So we need to reduce the load to achieve minimum delay [21, 22, 25, 29, 30]
by proper sizing of the transistors [21, 26]. Choosing proper layout, we can reduce the
effect of parasitic capacitances and resistances, which in turn reduces the load ca-
pacitances. Reduction of the load capacitance can enhance the performances of the
inverter.
Here we discuss the effect of load capacitances on the circuit delay in detail. From
eq. (3.20), we can represent the load capacitance (CL) as a summation of internal ca-
pacitances (CIn) and external capacitance (CEx) along with the extra load. Internal
capacitances are basically due to the internal capacitances of MOSFET which are CGd,p,
CGd,n, CBd,p and CBd,n; whereas the external capacitances are due to wiring and para-
sitic capacitances mainly. Under the assumption of symmetric delay (equal rise and
fall time) and equal pull-up and pull-down current, ﬁrst-order delay expression can

(3.35)
Hence TInt,Delay (= [1/2ln 2]RS CInt) is the intrinsic or unloaded (under-zero load) time
delay of the inverter circuit, depending on the layout, process technology, etc. If we
further assume that two identical CMOS inverters are connected in cascade and pMOS
devices are made n times larger than nMOS, we get the following expression for the
output load capacitance of the ﬁrst stage:
CL ≈CGd,p + CGd,n + CBd,p + CBd,n + CG,p + CG,n + CW.
(3.36)
Hence neglecting extra load and the drain to body capacitances of the transistors,
i.e. CBd,p and CBd,n, we get
CL ≈(1 + n)(CGd,n + CG,n) + CW.
(3.37)
Putting the value of CL, we can rewrite eq. (3.25) as

Now here we are going to ﬁnd the relationship between the input gate capacitance CG
and the output capacitance (CL + CEx) to explain the loading effect. The inverter chain
is given in Figure 3.17. Here CG,i represents the gate capacitance of the (i + 1) stage. To

Here fEff is the effective fan-out of a single inverter. In case of an N number of inverter’s

So each stage has same effective fan-out and same delay also. Total fan-out (FEff)

3.1.2.4 Power Dissipation in CMOS Inverter
Power dissipation is a pivotal challenge in digital IC design. Though static CMOS logic
structure dissipates almost zero power, yet in case of CMOS digital ICs having high per-
formance and high packing density, power dissipation increases. The disadvantages
of adding extra heat sinks is that it requires more silicon area, cost and weight [31–38].
Therefore proper analysis of power dissipation becomes essential for the efﬁcacy of
high performance VLSI circuits.
The main sources of power dissipation in a static inverter are mainly dynamic
power dissipation (PDyn), static power dissipation (PStat) and ﬁnally short circuit power
dissipation (PS).
Dynamic Power dissipation
Dynamic or switching power dissipation is due to the charging and discharging of the
output node, as given in Figure 3.5. In static CMOS when we charge a node having
capacitance CL, ET (=CLVDD2) energy is extracted from the supply source. Out of the
total energy (ET), EC (=1/2CLVDD2) is stored across the capacitor and remaining 1/2CLVDD2
energy is dissipated across the pull-up path. During the discharging phase, the charge,
stored in capacitor, ﬂows through the pull-down path to the ground, causing some
energy dissipation across pull-down path. ET and EC can be determined on the basis
of the following steps:
ET =

.
(3.52)
In short for every switching of output node CLV2
DDJ of energy dissipates. In order
to compute the dynamic power dissipations more accurately we need to introduce
switching activity parameter (!). If input signal changes rapidly, switching of output
node also becomes frequent and hence dissipation [35]. Overall network topology and
the implemented function also inﬂuence the switching activity or the dynamic power
dissipation. Assuming that the inverter circuit is switched on and off ! time in 1 s, the

90
3 Advanced Energy-reduced CMOS Inverter Design
expression of dynamic power dissipation will be
PDyn = !CLV2
DDfOp.
(3.53)
Here ! is the switching activity parameter. Some conclusions can be made in case of
dynamic power dissipations. They are as follows:
–
Dynamic power dissipation increases proportionately with the square of supply
voltage. So if we decrease the supply voltage by two times, dynamic power will
be reduced by four times. The drawback is reduction of supply voltage increases
the delay or deteriorates the performances. Also as we cannot reduce the supply
voltage below VTn + |VTp| in static inverter, so aggressive scaling of supply voltage
is not possible.
–
In high performance designs, drain diffusion areas are kept as small as possible to
reduce the parasitic capacitances which in turn reduce the effect of loading.
–
Switching activity in CMOS digital ICs can be reduced by algorithmic optimization
(based on characteristics and statistics of the data transmission), architecture op-
timization (balancing of delay path, ordering of input signals, etc.), logic topology
and circuit optimization.
Short circuit Power Dissipation
When input switches from higher logic to lower or vice versa, both the transistors
operate in saturation region, conduct for short time span and create a short circuit
path between supply voltage and ground. Due to this direct current ﬂow, short cir-
cuit power dissipation (PS) [39–41] occurs, as shown in Figure 3.18. If we assume a
zero rise or fall time then this short circuit power dissipation will be negligibly small.
In realistic situations we have to consider some ﬁnite rise and fall time for every
input pulse.
According to Figure 3.18, during ﬁnite rise (TRise) and fall (TFall) time, short circuit
current of maximum value IPeak is ﬂowing through the transistors. Hence transistor
sizing, capacitive load and transition time of the input signal inﬂuence this short cir-
cuit current. Short circuit current is also a strong function of the ratio between input
and output slopes. Then the total power dissipation due to this event in a full cycle
can be estimated roughly by the following expressions:
PS = VDD(IPeakTRise
2
+ IPeakTFall
2
)fOp;
= VDDIPeak(TRise + TFall
2
)fOp.
(3.54)
It has been observed that this short circuit power dissipation dominates for shorter
channel length.

Static Power Dissipation
With downscaling of CMOS device architecture leakage current increases alarmingly
and static power dissipation contributes [42–44] a signiﬁcant portion of power. The
leakage current components are given in Figure 3.19.
Main leakage components in static CMOS inverter are the following:
–
Subthreshold leakage; when transistor is turned off, i.e. VGS < VTh
–
Gate leakage through the ultra-thin oxide layers [44–46]
–
Leakage current due to reverse-biased drain- and source-substrate junction

Considering ILeak accounts all the above-mentioned components, we get the static
power dissipation as follows:
PStat = VDDILeak.
(3.55)
Ignoring BTBT effect, we get
ILeak = WISe
VTh
' .
(3.56)
Here, W and VTh are the transistor width and threshold voltage of the transistor, re-
spectively; IS is the leakage current at VTh = 0, ' is the subthreshold slope factor. So
the static energy dissipation becomes
.ES = VDDILeakTOP
= WISe
VTh
' VDDTOp.
(3.57)
TOP is the circuit time. So the total power dissipation in a CMOS inverter becomes
PTotal = PDyn + PStat + PS
= !CLV2
DDfOp + VDDIPeak(TRise + TFall
2
)fOp + ILeakVDDfOp.
(3.58)
Total power dissipation of CMOS inverter circuit for 1 volt supply voltage in a complete
cycle and for different supply voltages is given in Figures 3.20 and 3.21, respectively.
Though for higher gate length switching energy dissipation dominates, yet in sub-90
nm technology static power dissipation starts to dominate over dynamic power due to
aggressive scaling.
Here we are introducing a new metric, EDP (energy delay product), which is ba-
sically the product of total energy dissipation and gate delay. Using the EDP model,
given in this section, one can ﬁnd the optimal conditions.
Total energy dissipation in a CMOS inverter is given in eq. (3.58). Here we want to
introduce a new parameter circuit time (TOp), which can be written as TOp = LD 4. Here
LD and 4 are the logic depth and the gate delay of inverter. LD represents the number
of inverter in a ring oscillator. Hence we assume that the operating frequency of ring
oscillator is same as the maximum operating frequency of the chip. Gate delay [47] can
be represented as
4 = K

(VDD – VTh)! .

3.1.3 Introduction to Subthreshold Logic
To fulﬁll the demand of ultralow power dissipation in portable application, design
of subthreshold CMOS ICs becomes attractive. The pivotal advantages of operating
devices in the subthreshold region compared to super-threshold (VDD > VTh) counter-
part are reduced power due to low supply voltage (VDD) and small gate capacitance.
Reduction of supply voltage decreases the power dissipation signiﬁcantly by operat-
ing the circuit at a lower supply voltage. In subthreshold region, low gate capacitance
produces more switching power reduction. Since the subthreshold leakage current
is very small in magnitude and decreases at higher frequency range, these circuits
cannot perform at very high frequencies. So this subthreshold logic family [49–54] is
suitable for the application where ultralow power is pivotal issue instead of speed or
performances [50, 52].
Subthreshold ICs depend on temperature and process parameters variations. The
main effects of temperature ﬂuctuation are the following:
–
Due to temperature increment saturation of velocity degrades.
–
Rising die temperature increases the gate overdrive voltage and the drain current.
–
Drain current also increases due to the decrease in carrier mobility, as a result of
an increase in die temperature.
Extra care should be taken on PVT analysis of subthreshold circuit family [49–51, 54],
as circuits become less robust at ultralow voltages. In the next section we will discuss
the inverter in subthreshold region. With that we also discuss the different issues like
power dissipation, speed, noise margin, etc., in detail to provide a complete idea of
these ultralow voltage logic operations [55, 56].
3.1.3.1 Subthreshold Inverter Circuit and Operation
In subthreshold voltage, the drain current of an n-channel MOSFET can be given
by [50]
ISub = ISe
(VGS – VTh)
nnuT
⎛
⎜⎝1 – e
–VDS
uT
⎞
⎟⎠.
(3.62)
Hence we have assumed body and drain terminals of MOSFET transistors are tied up,
i.e. VBS = 0; VGS and VDS are the gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages, respect-
ively; VTh is the threshold voltage of nMOS transistor; uT (= KT
q ) is the thermal voltage;
n is the process dependent parameter and can be termed as slope factor; IS is the
speciﬁc current which can be given by
IS = 2nn,COxu2

(3.63)

3.1 Introduction

Here , is mobility, W/L is the aspect ratio of nMOS and COx is the oxide capacit-
ances per unit gate area. Considering DIBL and body effects, threshold voltage can
be represented as
VTh = VTh0 – +VDS + #VBS,
(3.64)
where + and # are the DIBL and body effect parameter. In 45 nm technology, for NMSO
(pMOS) the value of + and # are 0.12 (0.06) and 0.20 (0.16), respectively. By substituting
the value of VTh, eq. (1) can be expressed as
ISub = 2nn,COxu2

can be termed as the strength of the nMOS.
!n depends on the aspect ratio of the transistor, operating temperature and also the
COx.
In subthreshold regime transistors cannot be considered as “ON” or “OFF” as
VGS < VTh. On the basis of high and low drain-to-source voltage we can draw the equi-
valent model of a MOSFET in subthreshold regime. In case of a two-terminal device, if
the i/p and o/p are almost at same potential, the device can be said to be in conduct-
ing mode, whereas if the i/p and o/p potential differs largely, the device can be said to
be in nonconducting mode.
Hence, when VDS ≫KT
q (approximately VDS ≫4 KT
q ) then the MOSFET device can
be considered to be in nonconducting mode. So subthreshold drain current becomes
ISub = !ne

(3.66)
So the MOSFET will behave as voltage-controlled current source. Similarly for low
drain-to-source voltage, or VDS ≪KT
q then the MOSFET device can be considered to

96

be in conducting mode. Then subthreshold drain current can be expressed as
ISub = !ne
VGS + +VDS
nnuT
⎛
⎜⎝1 – e

⎟⎠.
(3.67)
By Taylor series expansion and neglecting the higher orders we can rewrite the
equation as
ISub = !ne

So
RDs = uT

(3.68)
In short, nMOS transistor will behave as a resistor under low VDS. The equivalent
model of MOSFET in subthreshold regime under low and high drain-to-source voltages
is given in Figure 3.22. Table 3.2 gives the extracted parameter for 45 nm technology ﬁle
with 120 nm/80 nm aspect ratio.
The inverter circuit structure in subthreshold regime as shown in Figure 3.23 (a)
is similar to the super-threshold circuit structure. Here MP and MN are the pMOS and
nMOS transistor in which body is connected with the source terminal. For low and
high input signal the equivalent model of inverter is also given in Figure 3.21 (b) and

Here L(x) is the “Lambert function of x” given by x = L(x)eL(x). So output high voltage

Similarly for high input MP and MN can be approximated as resistor and current
source, having value RP and IN, respectively. Now the output node will be discharged

possible. So output node voltage will be little bit higher than the ground potential.

3.1.3.2 Analysis of Logic Threshold and Noise Margin
Transfer characteristic of CMOS inverter in subthreshold regime is given in Figure 3.28.
The logic threshold VTh of an inverter can be found by equating the current of the

This logic threshold voltage depends on supply voltage, ratios of transistor strength
( !p
!n ) and temperature mainly. Hence obtained logic threshold voltage is greater than
VDD/2, if the pull-up transistor is stronger than the nMOS transistor. Similarly logic
threshold voltage falls below VDD/2 if nMOS is made stronger than the pMOS. Variation
of logic threshold voltage under different supply voltage is given in eq. (3.27). Fig. 3.29
and Fig. 3.30 denotes the variation of voltage swing and logic threshold voltage for
different supply voltage in subthreshold inverter. For example, with 160 mV supply
voltage, the theoretical VLth occurs in the range of 85 to 95 mV in 22 nm technology.
The noise margin characteristic [52, 59] for a CMOS inverter circuit has been dis-
cussed in the previous section. Hence VOh, VOl, VIh and VIl are output high voltage,
output low voltage, input high voltage and input low voltage, respectively, and have
usual meaning.

3.1.3.3 Power Dissipation in Subthreshold Inverter
Before discussing power dissipation of CMOS inverter, let us take a view of the oper-
ation of the circuit in subthreshold regime. For low input, pMOS transistor conducts
and a current ﬂows from the supply voltage to charge up the output load capacitor.
As the nMOS transistor remains in nonconducting mode for low input, a leakage cur-
rent ﬂows through it, causing leakage power dissipation across it. For high input, the
nMOS transistor starts to conduct and output load capacitor discharges through the
conducting path of nMOS. As pMOS transistors remain in nonconducting mode due
to high input, some leakage current also ﬂows through the supply voltage. In short,
the total energy (ETot) of the inverter in subthreshold region is divided into dynamic
energy (EDyn) and leakage energy (ELeak). Total energy can be written as
ETot = EDyn + ELeak.
(3.84)
Here dynamic energy can be modeled as
EDyn = .NSCLV2
DD,
(3.85)
where . = Switching activity parameter;
–
NS = Number of switched nodes to perform the operation;
–
CL = Output load capacitor and
–
VDD = DC supply voltage.
Switching power dissipation depends on supply voltages mainly. Reduction of supply
voltage can downscale the dynamic power dissipation signiﬁcantly. For simplicity, in
case of an inverter we can set the switching activity parameter to 1/2.
Leakage energy dissipation occurs due to the subthreshold leakage current
(ISub–Leak) and gate tunneling current (IGate) mainly. With gate tunneling current
through the insulating layer underneath the gate also increases due to the direct
tunneling of electrons and holes. The leakage energy (ELeak) can be expressed as
ELeak = VDDILeakT = TVDD!ne

(3.86)
Leakage energy decreases exponentially when increasing because of shorter delay,
provided that the devices operate in subthreshold regime. Leakage energy is directly
proportional to WminCL10

. So CL, WMin or subthreshold slope play pivotal role to

determine the leakage energy. For example, by downscaling W (width of the MOSFET),
we can reduce the leakage energy signiﬁcantly under 250 mV supply voltage.
Power dissipation of a CMOS inverter under 250 mV of a full cycle is given in
Figure 3.33. For an input stream the power dissipation of same inverter is given in
Figure 3.34.
To calculate minimum energy [51, 53, 57–64], it can be assumed that sizing of
transistors, supply voltage, etc., can be reduced to a moderate value. Conventionally,
the pMOS transistor is sized properly so that it can pull the output node up to a great
extent.
In this section we observe two important things. First, dynamic power increases
quadratically with the increase of supply voltage and second, leakage power reduces
exponentially with the increase of supply voltage. So there should be some optimum
value of the supply voltage for which energy dissipation will be minimum. Selection of
optimum supply voltage or minimum energy point is the most important design issue

in the subthreshold regime. In general, optimum VDD depends on load capacitance,
minimum width of the transistor, subthreshold slope and circuit parameter like the
switching activity too.
3.1.3.4 Propagation Delay of Subthreshold Inverter
In this section we will estimate the propagation delay in terms of TPhl and TPlh of
an inverter in subthreshold regime [49–52, 57, 58]. The average propagation delay
4P((4Phl + 4Plh)/2) of the inverter characterizes the average time required for the in-
put signal to propagate through the inverter. Circuit delay of the inverter is related
to the gate delay CLVDD/I, where VDD and I are the supply voltage and on-current,
respectively. CL is the output load capacitance. To simplify the analysis, we assume
that the input voltage has zero rise time. Recalling the drain current of an nMOS in
subthreshold regime, we get
ISub = 2nn,COxu2

(3.87)
Hence in 0 →1 step input transition, the inverter can be simpliﬁed through the equi-
valent circuit depicted in Figure 3.35. Assuming the resistance of the discharging path
be RN and CL as output load capacitances we can ﬁnd ﬁrst-order delay expression for
this RC equivalent circuit. Hence during discharging event output node voltage can be
expressed as
VOut(t) = VDD exp(–t/4),
(3.88)
where 4 is the time constant of the equivalent RC circuit. Again, according to the deﬁn-
ition of gate propagation delay VOut(t = 4Phl) = VDD/2. Therefore, the above equation
reduces to
4Phl = ln 2 4,

Hence gate-to-source voltage can be treated as constant parameter and equivalent to

3.1.3.4.2 Slow Ramp Input
We assume the input and the output vary in the same time interval. Under this
assumption, during the discharging of the output capacitance, nMOS current now
depends on VDS and VGS. The delay expression can be expressed as
IDn(t, VOut) = CL

Figure 3.36 represents the delay of inverter circuits for different supply voltage. From
Figure 3.36, it is evident that as VDD increases delay decreases signiﬁcantly like the
super-threshold circuit behavior. Effect of load capacitances on the delay in inverter is
also shown in Figure 3.37.

4 Advanced Combinational Circuit Design
Introduction
A static logic gate is one that has a well-deﬁned output once the inputs are stabilized
and the switching transients have decayed away. In other words, in a static gate, we
are not considering the transient response; we have to consider steady-state response.
If the inputs are well deﬁned, the outputs of a static logic are also well deﬁned for all
times. In a static logic circuit output node has a low resistance path to VDD or ground.
The output voltage is not changing with time. Periodic signals or clocks are not re-
quired for refreshing the voltage of the nodes, although it may be present for other
purposes [1].
4.1 Static CMOS Logic Gate Design
In a CMOS logic gate, there will be logic array of pull-down transistors and logic
array of pull-up transistors. The pull-up and pull-down networks (PUN and PDN)
are operated by input voltages in a complementary fashion. When PDN conducts
for an input combination, the output node establishes a low resistance path with
ground (PDN transistors are ON, and PUN transistors are OFF), resulting in logic
“0” output. When PUN conducts, the output node establishes a low resistance path
with VDD (PUN transistors are ON, PDN transistors are OFF), resulting a logic “1”
output.
Thus PDN conduction results in logic “0” output and PUN conduction results in
logic “1” output.
There is never a path through “ON” transistors from the “1” to the “0” supplies for
any combination of inputs which is the basis for the low static power dissipation in
CMOS logic.
The pull-down array consists of nMOS transistors as nMOS is good for passing lo-
gic “0” (without signal degradation) (refer pass transistor in earlier chapter). Similarly
pMOS is used for pull-up array as pMOS is good for passing logic “1”.
4.2 Complementary Properties of CMOS Logic
– Under static condition, PUN and PDN never turn on simultaneously. This is one
complementary action property of CMOS logic.
– PDN comprises nMOSFETs, whereas PUN comprises pMOSFETs. This is another
complementary property of CMOS logic.

4.2 Complementary Properties of CMOS Logic
113
– That PUN and PDN are dual of each other (series connection of pMOS transist-
ors in PDN is equal to parallel connection of pMOS transistors in PUN) is another
complementary property.
– AND function is implemented by the series connection of nMOSFETs and the par-
allel connection of pMOSFETs; in contrast OR function is implemented by the
parallel connection of nMOSFETs and the series connection of pMOSFETs.
4.2.1 CMOS NAND Gate
To construct a CMOS circuit that provides this function we will use two complement-
ary pairs, one for each of the inputs A and B and create the nMOS and pMOS arrays
according to the needed outputs as shown in Fig. 4.1–4.2. First, note that there is only a
single case where the output is a 0. This occurs when both inputs are at logic 1 values.
Translating this observation into voltages then says that the output voltage VOut = 0
V if and only if both of the two input voltages are high, i.e. A = VDD = B. Since the
nMOSFETs connect the output node to ground, this requires that the two nMOSFETs
be connected in the series. If either input voltage is low, then VOut = VDD, indicating
that the output node must be connected to the power supply. To accommodate these
cases, we will wire the two pMOSFETs in parallel. Combining the requirements for the
MOSFETs results in the circuit as shown in Figure 4.3.
4.2.2 CMOS NOR Gate
The NOR gate operation can be explained as follows: when either one or both in-
puts are high i.e. when the nMOS network creates a conducting path between the

output node and ground, the pMOS network is cut off. On the other hand if both in-
put voltages are low, i.e. the nMOS network is cut off, the pMOS network creates a
conducting path between the output node and power supply voltage VDD. Thus the
dual or complementary circuit structure allows that, for any given input combination,
the output is connected to VDD or to ground via a low resistance path. Fig. 4.4–4.6
provides some example CMOS logic gates/circuits.

4.2.4 XOR or Nonequivalence Gate Using CMOS Logic
The reason why XOR gate is known as nonequivalence checker is because when the
inputs A and B are not equivalent or different then the output is high as indicated
from the truth table as shown in Figure 4.7. To realize XOR gate in CMOS we have to
realize the function f = A ⊕B = AB+AB as CMOS logic always generates inverted logic.
4.2.5 XOR–XNOR or Equivalence Gate Using CMOS Logic
Note that full CMOS implementation of XOR function requires 12 transistors including
four additional transistors required to obtain inverse of A and B as shown in Fig. 4.8.

4.2.6 And-Or-Invert and Or-And-Invert Gates
There are two main important categories of complex CMOS gate. They are And-Or-
Invert (AOI) and Or-And-Invert (OAI) gates [2]. The AOI gates enable sum-of-products
(SOP) realization consisting of parallel braches of the series of connected nMOS pull-
down transistors. The OAI enables products-of-sums (POS) realization consisting of
series of braches of parallel-connected nMOS pull-down transistors. In both cases,
PUN will be dual of the PDN as shown in Fig. 4.10–4.12.

4.2.7 Full Adder Circuits Using CMOS Logic
sum_out = A ⊕B ⊕C = ABC + A¯B¯C + ¯A¯BC + ¯AB¯C
carry_out = AB + BC + CA
To implement full adder, carry_out signal is used to generate sum output instead of
realizing sum and carry separately. This implementation will reduce the circuit com-
plexity and also save the chip area as shown in Fig. 4.13–4.15. Table 4.1 shows the truth
table of the full adder. In a similar manner, a 4-bit ripple carry adder chain consisting
of 4 full adders can also be constructed as shown in Fig. 4.16.

Thus sum_out or output sum can be written as
sum_out = (A + B + C)(carry_out) + ABC
(A + B + C)(AB + BC + CA) + ABC = (A + B + C)(AB.BC.CA) + ABC
= (A + B + C)[(A + B)(B + C)(C + A)] + ABC
= (A + B + C)[(A.B + A.C + B.B + B.C)(C + A)] + ABC
= (A + B + C)[A.B.C + A.C.C + B.B.C + B.C.C + A.B.A
+ A.C.A + B.B.A + B.C.A] + ABC
= (A + B + C)(A.B.C + A.C + B.C + A.B) + ABC
= ABC + A¯B¯C + ¯A¯BC + ¯AB¯C.
Thus sum_out is same as before.
Thus in general to implement full adder, we can write
Carry_out = Cn+1 = an.bn + cn (an + bn)
Sum_out = Sn = an1Abn1Acn = an.bn.cn + (an + bn + cn) .Cn+1.

pull-down structure requires n number of nMOS transistors [3]. This requires large area
for the implementation of complex CMOS logic within a high density deigned IC [4].
Pseudo-nMOS logic design is one way to reduce the transistor count and also area
requirement than CMOS logic design. In pseudo-nMOS logic design, n+1 number of
transistors are required for implementing n input logic gate. Out of this n+1 transistors,
one is pMOS transistor functioning as pull-up device and n number of nMOS transistor
wired for implementation of PDN, which is same as CMOS logic design, which was dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter. The primary advantage to this type of circuit is simpliﬁed
interconnect wiring due to the absence of a pMOS logic array.

4.3 Pseudo-nMOS Gates
123
Instead of using n number of pMOS transistor, only one pMOS transistor is used
in this logic design. The purpose of the PUN in complementary CMOS is to provide
a conditional path between VDD and the output when the PDN is turned off. In ra-
tioed logic, the entire PUN is replaced with a single always-ON unconditional load
device that pulls up the output for a high output. Instead of a combination of active
PDN and PUN, such a gate consists of an nMOS PDN that realizes the logic func-
tion, and a simple load device. The gate of the pMOS transistor is grounded. Thus
the pMOS transistor remains always-ON, reminding the always-ON depletion mode
inveter.
4.3.1 Why the Name Is Pseudo-nMOS?
The depletion type always-ON nMOS device used as pull-up device in depletion load
inverter is replaced by always-ON pMOS device in pseudo-nMOS technology. This is
the reason it is known as pseudo-nMOS technology as it reminds of the older nMOS
technology. Historically, nMOS preceded CMOS as the dominant technology, but it is
now obsolete. Pseudo-nMOS logic is a CMOS technique where the circuits resemble
the older nMOS-only networks.
4.3.2 Ratioed Logic
Pseudo-nMOS logic gates are known as ratioed logic because the transfer func-
tion depends on the ratio of the strength of the pull-down transistor to the pull-up
device. This type of logic gates exhibit static power dissipation in certain states
(when the output is low), which is a major disadvantage of this type of techno-
logy. Therefore, ratioed circuits have limited use in certain limited circumstances
where they offer critical beneﬁts such as smaller area/low transistor count per logic
gate [5].
When the output voltage is lower than VDD then the pMOS device conducts a
steady-state current. Thus under steady-state condition logic gate exhibits power.
As it is a ratioed logic, the value of the VOl and the noise margin are also determ-
ined by the ratio of the strength of pMOS load transistor to the pull-down or driver
transistors.
The value of VOl and noise margin depends upon the driver-to-load ratio

4.3.3 Operation of Pseudo-nMOS Inverter
From Figure 4.18 the pMOS voltages of the inverter are
VSdp = VDD – VOut and VSG = VDD.
The value of the source gate voltage indicates that the pMOS is always biased into
the active region and cannot be turned off; however, the actual value of the current is
controlled by the nMOS driver transistor.
When input voltage is less than threshold voltage of nMOS device, i.e. VIn < VTn,
the nMOS transistor is OFF and VOh = VDD as pMOS connects the output node to power
supply VDD. If one increases VIn, nMOS turns ON and starts conducting to pull down
the output voltage. By setting VIn = VOh we can calculate the output low voltage VOl
circuit. Let us assume that VOl is small, so that nMOS is non-saturated; if VOl < |VTp|
also holds, then pMOS will be saturated. Equating the currents through the transistors
gives

Figure 4.18 shows the general shape of the voltage transfer curve for this inverter
circuit.
First, it is not possible to achieve a value of VOl = 0 V since the square root term
can never equal (VDD – VTn). Second, the value of VOl depends upon the driver-to-load
ratio
"n
"p
.
A small VOl requires a large driver-to-load ratio. Mathematically, this can be seen by
noting that increasing the driver-to-load ratio moves the square root term closer to
(VDD – VTn). This corresponds to the physical viewpoint that we must make the nMOS
more conductive to pull it closer to ground voltage. Finally, note that if input is at
logic high, both transistors are ON and conducting, establishing a DC current path
between supply and ground; this implies that static DC power dissipation occurs when
the input is at a stable logic high level.
4.4 Pass-transistor Logic
This is a popular alternative to widely accepted CMOS logic design style where the
main intension is to reduce the number of transistors. In the pass transistor logic the
primary inputs drive gate terminals as well as the drain and/or source terminals. In
contrast to the conventional CMOS logic design where primary inputs drive the gate
terminals only [6].
The essential requirement in the design of the pass transistor logic is to ensure
that every circuit node has at all times a low resistance path to ground or VDD.
Figure 4.19 shows an AND gate realized by pass transistor logic using only nMOS
transistors. If the input B is high, the input A is copied to the output Y, and if B is
low, then bottom pass transistor turns on and passes logic “0” at the output. Initially
at ﬁrst glance the bottom switch looks redundant. But the bottom pass transistor is
essential to ensure the low resistance path for the output node under the circumstance
when B is low. If this pass transistor is omitted then output will be connected to high
impedance when B is low.
This AND gate requires only 4 transistors (2 pass transistors, another 2 required to
invert B), in contrast to CMOS logic AND gate which requires 6 transistors. In general
we can conclude, pass transistor logic offers advantage of saving in transistor count
as shown in Fig. 4.20.

4.5 Complementary Pass Transistor Logic
127
But pass transistor suffers from limited output swing, in contrast to full rail to rail
output swing in case of CMOS logic. We know that an nMOS device is effective at
passing a 0 but is poor at pulling a node to VDD. When the pass transistor pulls a
node high, the output only charges up to VDD – VTn. The situation will get worsen if
the transistor suffers from substrate bias effect. It will increase the threshold voltage.
Considering substrate bias effect, threshold voltage can be written as VTn(VBS). Now
as VTn(VBS) > VTn, output swing limit is more for a pass transistor experiencing body
effect.
4.5 Complementary Pass Transistor Logic
For high performance design, a differential pass transistor logic family called com-
plementary pass transistor (CPL) is commonly used [6]. The main features of CPL are
listed below:
– The basic idea is to accept true and complementary inputs and produce the true
and complementary outputs.
– CPL circuit essentially consists of complementary inputs, nMOS pass transistor
logic network to generate complementary outputs and CMOS inverters to restore
output signals from pass transistors suffering with limited output swing.

4 Advanced Combinational Circuit Design
– Complementary data inputs and outputs are available as these circuits are mem-
bers of differential family. Although generating the differential signals requires
extra circuitry, the differential style has the advantage that some complex gates
such as XORs and adders can be realized efﬁciently with a small number of
transistors.
– Furthermore, the availability of both polarities of every signal eliminates the need
for extra inverters, as is often the case in static CMOS or pseudo-nMOS.
– CPL belongs to the class of static gates, because the output-deﬁning nodes are al-
ways connected to either VDD or GND through a low resistance path. This is helpful
for the noise suppression.
The CPL realization always does not offer advantage of reduced transistor count as
evident from Figure 4.21, where NAND/NOR gates require more transistor than their
conventional CMOS counterpart, whereas XOR/XNOR functions (6 transistors) have a
reduced complexity than their CMOS realizations (8 transistors).
4.6 Signal Restoring Pass Transistor Logic Design
Pass transistor logic and CPL suffer from static power dissipation and reduced noise
margins, since the high input to the signal-restoring inverter only charges up to
VDD – VTn.
Level restorer circuit can be used to solve this problem as shown in Figure 4.22.
The gate of the pMOS device is connected to the output of the inverter, its drain
connected to the input of the inverter and the source to VDD. Assume node X is at 0 V
(out is at VDD, Mr is off, B = VDD and A = 0). Now if input A makes a transition from
0 →VDD, pass transistor Mp charges node X to VDD – VTn. This is, however, enough to
switch the output of the inverter low, turning on the feedback device Mr and pulling
node X all the way to VDD. This eliminates any static power dissipation in the inverter.

4.7 Sizing of Transistor in CMOS Design Style

In summary, this circuit has the advantage that all voltage levels are either at GND or
VDD, and no static power is consumed.
The circuit should be carefully designed and must be ratioed to function properly.
Consider node X make a transition from high to low. The pass transistor network at-
tempts to pull-down node X while the level restorer pulls now X to VDD. Therefore, the
pull-down device must be stronger than the pull-up device in order to switch node X
and the output.
Another solution to solve the limited output signal swing problem is to use
multiple threshold devices as noted below.
Using zero threshold devices for the nMOS pass transistors eliminates most of
the threshold drop and passes a signal close to VDD. All devices other than the pass
transistors (i.e. the inverters) are implemented using standard high threshold devices.
Notice that even if the devices threshold was implanted to be exactly equal to zero, the
body effect of the device prevents a swing to VDD.
The problems are extra processing required to obtain ion implanted nMOS tran-
sistors. The zero threshold nMOS devices are prone to subthreshold conduction, which
can generate some sneak path, through which signiﬁcant energy leakage can occur [7].
4.7 Sizing of Transistor in CMOS Design Style
The sizing of the transistors in the CMOS design style is determined after designing
the logic gate. Let us denote (W/L)n = n and (W/L)p = p for an inverter. For a CMOS
inverter with symmetric VTC p =

,n
,p

n [8].
For any logic gate, the W/L ratios for the MOS devices are chosen in such a way
that the current driving capability of the gate in both directions (charging and dischar-
ging output capacitance through PUN and PDN) is equal to that of the basic inverter.
For example, the W/L ratios for all the transistors in the PDN should be assigned a
value so that the PDN should be able to provide a capacitor discharge current that at
least is equal to that of an nMOS transistor with W/L = n, and the PUN should be
able to provide a charging current that at least is equal to that of pMOS transistor with
W/L = p. This will make sure that the worst-case gate delay will be equal to that of the
basic inverter.
Worst-case means when we have to make decision about device size, we should
consider the input combinations that result in the lowest output current and then
choose sizes that will make this current equal to that of the basic inverter.
In CMOS logic gates the PUN and PDN consist of parallel- or series-connected
MOSFETs. Thus we will ﬁrst ﬁnd the equivalent W/L ratio for parallel or series-
connected MOSFETs.
We know that for a MOSFET larger W/L means more current driving capability
and thus less on resistance. Thus we can conclude that the resistance (rDs) is inversely

130
4 Advanced Combinational Circuit Design
proportional to (W/L) ratio. Thus if a number of MOSFETs are connected in series hav-
ing ratios (W/L)1, (W/L)2,..., the equivalent series resistance can be obtained by adding
the on resistances as

Two identical MOS with W/L = 2 result in an equivalent W/L of 4 when connected in
parallel and of 1 when connected in series as shown in Figure 4.23. It means that when
transistors are connected in series, their current driving capability increases and it
decreases when connected in series.
Now after determining the equivalent W/L for series and parallel-connected
MOSFETs, let us consider 4 input NOR gates as shown in Figure 4.24. The worst-case
or lowest current for PDN is obtained when only one of the nMOS transistors is con-
ducting. We therefore select the W/L of each nMOS transistor that is equal to n, which
is the W/L ratio of nMOS transistor in a CMOS inverter. For the PUN the only case and
indeed the worst case is when all inputs are low and four series transistors are con-
ducing. Since the W/L ratio of equivalent pMOS transistor will be 1/4th of each pMOS
device, we therefore select the W/L ratio of each pMOS transistor to be four times that
of pMOS transistor in a basic CMOS inverter, which is equal to 4p.

NOR gates are preferred over NAND gates in pseudo-nMOS logic design. NOR gates are
implemented by connecting nMOS transistor in parallel, which can be designed with
minimum size nMOS transistor, requiring smaller area.
4.8 Introduction to Logical Effort
4.8.1 Deﬁnitions of Logical Effort
Deﬁnition 1: The logical effort of a logic gate is deﬁned as the number of times worse
it is at delivering output current than would be an inverter with identical input
capacitance.
All logic gates including inverters deliver output currents. If all of them have identical
input capacitance, then some of them will deliver more current while some of them
will deliver less current. A CMOS inverter consists of a PUN and PDN with only one
transistor. Thus to maintain same input capacitance, transistors will be maximum
wider and thus will produce highest output current. A logic gate must have more
transistors than an inverter, and so to maintain equal input capacitance, its transist-
ors must be narrower (less width) on average and thus less able to conduct current
than those of an inverter with identical input capacitance. Now in PDN or in PUN,

4.8 Introduction to Logical Effort
133
the transistors may be connected in series or in parallel. If series topology is used,
the logic gate cannot deliver output current same as the inverter with identical input
capacitance. If parallel topology is used, we will consider only the worst case where
only one of the transistors connected in parallel is conducting and will deliver less
current than an inverter with identical input capacitance.
In general logic gate will deliver less current than an inverter irrespective of it
being in series or in parallel. Logical effort is a measure of how much worse current it
is than the inverter.
Deﬁnition 2: The logical effort of a logic gate is deﬁned as the ratio of its input
capacitance to that of an inverter that delivers equal output current.
This alternative deﬁnition is useful for computing the logical effort of a particular to-
pology. To compute logical effort of a logic gate, adjust transistor sizes to obtain output
current same as inverter and then compare input capacitance of each input signal.
The ratio of this input capacitance to that of the standard inverter is the logical effort
of that input to the logic gate.
Logical effort values for a few CMOS logic gates are shown in Table 4.2. Logical
effort is deﬁned so that an inverter has a logical effort of one. These unitless form
means that all delays are measured relative to the delay of a simple inverter.
The logical effort of a logic gate tells how much worse it is at producing output
current than is an inverter, given that each of its inputs may contain only the same
input capacitance as the inverter [9]. Reduced output current means slower operation,
and thus the logical effort number for a logic gate tells how much more slowly it will
drive a load than an inverter would. Equivalently, logical effort is how much more
input capacitance a gate presents to deliver the same output current as an inverter.
Assume the (W/L) ratio of a pMOS pull-up transistor is twice than (W/L) ratio of
an nMOS pull-down transistor in an static CMOS inverter.
p =

i.e. p = 2n as mobility of electron is twice the mobility of holes.
If n = (W/L)n is selected as 1 then p = (W/L)p is equal to 2.

(W/L) of inverter’s pull-up pMOS to pull-down nMOS is equal to 2.

The logical effort of inverter is equal to 1. In the inverter the input “a” faces a gate
capacitance of 2 due to pMOS and 1 due to nMOS; total equals (2 + 1) = 3.
There are two pMOS transistors in a 2 input NAND gate which are in parallel;
thus in worst case any one of them will conduct. To make the (W/L)equivalent of the
pMOS of the NAND gate same as the (W/L) of the pMOS of the inverter we must choose
p = (W/L)p = 2.
There are two nMOS transistors in a 2 input NAND gate which are in series; thus
in worst case and only one case indeed, both of them will conduct. To make the
(W/L)equivalent of the nMOS of the NAND gate same as the (W/L) of the nMOS of the
inverter that equals 1, we must choose n = (W/L)n = 2. As we know


.
Now any input “a” or “b” in the NAND gate faces an input capacitance of 2 due to
pMOS and another 2 due to nMOS; total equals to 2 + 2 = 4. The input of the inverter
faces an input capacitance that equals 3. Thus the logical effort is 4/3. Similarly from
Figure 4.27(c) one can calculate the logical effort of 2 input NOR gate that equals 5/3.
As 4/3 is closer to 5/3, a NAND gate’s delay characteristic is closer to the character-
istic of an inverter than a 2 input NOR gate. Thus NAND gate is preferred to NOR gate
for implementation of CMOS logic.

4.9 Delay Estimation by Logical Effort
135
It is interesting but not surprising to note from Table 4.2 that more complex logic func-
tions have larger logical effort. Moreover, the logical effort of most logic gates grows
with the number of inputs to the gate. Larger or more complex logic gates will thus
exhibit greater delay. Logical effort makes the comparison and choice easy among
different logical structures. Designs that minimize the number of stages of logic will
require more inputs for each logic gate and thus have larger logical effort. Designs with
fewer inputs and thus less logical effort per stage may require more stages of logic.
4.9 Delay Estimation by Logical Effort
The delay in an MOS circuit can be estimated by an easy method known as logical
effort. This method also speciﬁes the number of logic stages and optimized transistor
sizes. This method is suitable for comparison of delay among various logic structures
and optimization of logic design [8, 9].
We ﬁrst deﬁne that total delay suffered by a logic gate consists of two parts: a ﬁxed
part known as parasitic delay, and a part proportional to the load on the gate’s output
called the effort delay. The parasitic delay of a logic gate is ﬁxed, independent of the
size of the logic gate and of the load capacitance it drives.
d = p + f
d denotes total delay, p denotes parasitic delay and f denotes effort delay.
The effort delay depends on the load and also on the properties of the logic gate.
To incorporate the ﬁrst factor, electrical effort denoted as h is introduced, which char-
acterizes the load. On the other hand logical effort denoted as g is introduced to
capture the properties of the logic gate. The effort delay of the logic gate is the product
of these two factors given by
f = g ∗h
The logical effort g reﬂects the logic gate’s topology and its ability to produce output
current. The logical effort represents the fact that, for a given load, complex gates have
to work harder than an inverter to produce a similar response. In other words, the
logical effort of a logic gate tells how much worse it is at producing output current than
an inverter, given that each of its inputs may contain only the same input capacitance
as the inverter. Equivalently, logical effort is how much more input capacitance a gate
presents to deliver the same output current as an inverter. Logical effort is a useful
parameter, because it depends only on circuit topology.
The electrical effort h describes how the electrical environment of the logic gate
affects performance and how the size of the transistors in the gate determines its load
driving capability. The electrical effort is deﬁned by

136
4 Advanced Combinational Circuit Design
h = COut/CIn,
where COut is the capacitance that loads the logic gate and CIn is the capacitance
presented by the logic gate at one of its input terminals. Electrical effort is also called
fan-out by many CMOS designers. The load driven by a logic gate is generally capacit-
ive (COut) in nature and such load will slow down the circuit. The input capacitance
of the circuit is a measure of the size of its transistors. The input capacitance term
appears in the denominator of equation h = COut/CIn because bigger transistors in a
logic gate will drive a given load faster. Electrical effort is usually expressed as a ratio
of transistor widths rather than actual capacitances. We know that the capacitance of
a transistor gate is proportional to its area; if we assume that all transistors have the
same minimum length, then the capacitance of a transistor gate is proportional to its
width. Because most logic gates drive other logic gates, we can express both CIn, and
COut in terms of transistor widths.
Combining equations above, we obtain the basic equation that models the delay
through a single logic gate.
d = gh + p.
4.10 Introduction to Transmission Gate
The most widely used solution to deal with the voltage-drop problem is the use of
transmission gates [11–13].
When an nMOS or pMOS transistor is used as a pass transistor, it acts as an imper-
fect switch, causing logic degradation. If pMOS and nMOS are connected in parallel,
a switch is obtained where both logic 0 and logic 1 are passed without degradation
and in an acceptable fashion. This switch is called transmission gate (TG) as shown in
Figure 4.28. It acts as an excellent switch, providing bidirectional current ﬂow, and it
exhibits an on resistance that remains almost constant for wide range of input voltage.
These characteristics make TG not only an excellent switch in digital application
but also excellent choice as analog switch.
Figure 4.28 (a–e) below shows ﬁve alternate symbols or representations of
CMOS TG. nMOS transistor passes logic “0” and pMOS transistor passes logic “1” in
a CMOS TG provided appropriate control signals are applied. So the output is always
strongly driven and the levels are never degraded. This is called a fully restored logic
gate and simpliﬁes circuit design considerably. A CMOS TG requires both the control
input and its complement to work properly. Thus CMOS TG is categorized in doubled
rail logic.
TG consists of one nMOS and one pMOS in parallel. The gate voltages applied to
these two transistors are also complementary signals. As such CMOS TG operates as a
bidirectional switch between the node A and B controlled by signal C.

Figure 4.28: Five (a–e) different representations of the CMOS transmission gate (TG) (f) TG acting as
an open gate or closed gate depending upon applied control signal (g) both high and low signals are
passed through TG without degradation.
If the control signal C is logic high, i.e. equal to VDD, then both transistors are turned
on and provide a low resistance path between the nodes A and B. If, on the other hand,
the control signal C is low, then both transistors will be off, and the path between the
nodes A and B will be an open circuit. This condition is also called the high impedance
state.
TG can be used as a basic building block to represent a class of logic famil-
ies called CMOS transmission gate or pass gate logic. Pass transistor logic utilizes
MOSFETs in series path from the input to the output to pass or block the signal
transmission as discussed earlier. In pass transistor logic a single MOSFET is used
as the switch. CMOS TG can be used to implement the switches, giving alternat-
ive name, transmission gate logic. The terms (pass transistor logic or transmission
gate logic) can be interchanged without considering the actual implementation of
the switches. In this section we will investigate how TG ﬁnds its application to
be used in logic circuit design, sometimes resulting in compact circuit structures
which may need smaller number of transistors than their standard CMOS counter-
parts.
We will examine here a simple switch circuit using TGs as their basic building
blocks. The transmission gate is a fundamental and ubiquitous component in MOS
logic. It is used as a multiplexing element, a logic structure, a latch element, and an
analog switch.

4.10.1 Use of CMOS TG as Switch
Figure 4.29 shows a TG with input connected to an ideal step input signal at t = 0.
Assume initial output voltage across the output capacitor is zero. The output node is
connected to subsequent logic stages, which represent capacitive loads. The substrate
terminal of nMOS is connected to ground and substrate terminal of pMOS is connected
to VDD. The control signals are applied in such a way that both the transistors will
conduct.
4.10.1.1 Logic “1” Transfer
For an nMOS,
VDSn = VIn – VOut(t) = VDD – VOut(t)
VGSn = VDD – VOut(t).
Assume the output voltage VOut(t) is zero. Therefore VDSn > VGSn – VTn. Thus ini-
tially nMOS is operating at saturation. The nMOS transistor will be turned off when
VGSn < VTn, i.e. VDD – VOut(t) < VTn or in other words VOut(t) > VDD – VTn. Thus the
output voltage cannot exceed VDD – VTn. As long as VOut(t) is less than VDD – VTn the
nMOS is operating in saturation mode. Once the VOut(t) equals VDD – VTn, the nMOS is
turned off.
Thus nMOS in the TG for rising input always works in saturation mode. The nMOS
in saturation mode conducts a charging current IDsn which is given as
IDsn = ,nCOx
2
W
L (VGS – VTn)2
IDsn = ,nCOx

L (VDD – VOut – VTn)2 .
This diminishing current through nMOS reduces to zero when VOut(t) = VDD–VTn.
The voltage at the source terminal of the nMOS equals VOut(t), which is not equal
to zero. The substrate of the nMOS is connected to ground. Thus there is a voltage

threshold voltage VTn will be determined by the body effect and is given by
VTn = Vt0 + #

.
For pMOS,
VDSp = VOut(t) – VDD
VSdp = VDD – VOut(t)
VGSp = –VDD.
The condition for pMOS transistor to work in the saturation is VDSp ≤VGSp – VTp.
Substituting values, we obtain
VOut(t) – VDD ≤–VDD – VTp.
Thus as long as VOut(t) ≤|VTp| the pMOS transistor works in saturation region, when
VOut(t) crosses |VTp| or when VOut(t) > |VTp| the pMOS operates in linear region. pMOS
transistor remains always on for a logic “1” transfer, regardless of the output voltage
level VOut(t).
Thus pMOS transistor operates initially at the saturation with VSG = VDD with a
current passing through it.

Initially VOut(t) = 0. However, VOut(t) increases with time, which decreases VSdp or
VDSp increases. As long as VDSp ≤VGSp – VTp or VOut(t) ≤|VTp| the pMOS works in
saturation and then it changes mode from saturation to linear after VOut(t) crosses
|VTp|. After this occurs

until VOut(t) reaches VDD.
The substrate and the source terminal of the pMOS are connected to VDD. Thus
there is no body effect in the pMOS for logic “1” transfer.
Initially the total charging current equals to the sum of IDsn and IDsp. The pMOS
will enter into the linear region when VOut(t) = |VTp| and will continue to conduct until
capacitor COut is fully charged and VOut(t) = VOh = VDD. Thus pMOS will provide the
gate with a good “1”. The MOSFET regions of operation are summarized by the plot in
Figure 4.30.

If VIn goes low at t = 0, the nMOS and pMOS interchange roles as compared to logic

Since the nMOS allows for a complete discharge of COut pMOS will go into cutoff when
VOut(t) falls below |VTp| and IDp = 0.
Thus pMOS will move into cutoff mode when VOut(t) falls below |VTp|, where |VTp|

The output capacitor COut is discharging. nMOS changes mode from saturation to

The remaining discharge continues until VOut(t) = VOl = 0 V, a strong “0”. The opera-

Thus TG provides no logic degradation – superior performance than single nMOS
switches. The price paid is increased size, area and complexity.
4.10.2 2:1 Multiplexer Using TG
Figure 4.33 shows a two-input MUX circuit consisting of two TGs with its truth table
shown in Table 4.3. If the control input s is logic high, then the bottom TG will conduct
and output will be equal to B. If the control signal is low, the bottom TG will turn off
and the top TG will connect the output to input A.

We know that complementary CMOS gates are always inverting in nature. When in-
puts are logic “1”, nMOSFETs turn on , leading to a “0” at the output. To make a
non-inverting buffer we might be tempted to place the pMOS in place of the nMOS
and nMOS in place of the pMOS. It will be a non-inverting gate as shown in Figure 4.41
but both the pMOS and nMOS produce degraded output. Thus this type of design is

the input A, just as in an ordinary buffer. When the enable input is “0”, Y is left ﬂoating
(a “Z” value) or high impedance state. The truth table and structure of tristate buffer
is shown in Table 4.6 and Fig. 4.42 respectively.
Figure 4.43 shows a TG which has the same truth table as tristate buffer. It requires
only two transistors but unfortunately it is a member of non-restoring logic family. If
the input is a noisy or otherwise degraded signal, the output will receive the same
noise. After several stages of non-restoring logic, a signal can become too degraded to
recognize.

Figure 4.44 (a) shows a tristate inverter with logic restoring capability as the out-
put is always connected to VDD or ground. For some particular input combinations
the output is ﬂoating, i.e. connected to neither VDD nor ground, which is known
as high impedance state. For example, when EN is “0” (Figure 4.44 (b)), both en-
able transistors are off, leaving the output ﬂoating. When EN is “1” (Figure 4.44 (c)),
both enable transistors are on. They are conceptually removed from the cir-
cuit, leaving a simple inverter. Figure 4.44 (d) shows symbols for the tristate in-
verter. A tristate buffer can be built as a tristate inverter, following an ordinary
inverter.

4.13 Implementation of Combinational Circuit Using DTMOS
Logic for Ultralow Power Application
Subthreshold logic circuits are efﬁcacious for ultralow power system design. In sub-
threshold logic circuits, as the supply voltage is scaled down below the threshold
voltage of the MOSFET, gate overdrive voltage decreases, which also decreases the cir-
cuit speed. SO subthreshold logic circuits are advantageous where the low power has
utmost importance instead of the speed of operation. Hence we cannot scale down the
threshold voltage aggressively as the minimum value of the threshold voltage is ﬁxed.
Hence, device engineering becomes effective for the design of low power circuits. Dy-
namic threshold voltage MOSFET (DTMOS) is a class of subthreshold circuits which
offer very less power dissipation [15]. Threshold voltage of nMOS can be written as
VTh = 26B + VFb + #
26B
 – VBS

. Hence >B is the inversion layer potential, VFb is
the Fermi band voltage and # is the body effect parameter. Now, in DTMOS circuit gate
and the body are tied up together. So in DTMOS (N-type) when the gate potential is
low then the threshold voltage becomes VTh = 26B + VFb + #
26B


, i.e. maximum.
Higher threshold voltage limits the leakage currents and also reduces the power dis-
sipations due to the leakage currents at zero biasing. Also, when the gate potentials
set to high, then the threshold voltage will be VTh = 26B + VFb + #
26B
 – VDD

i.e. minimum. Low threshold voltage results higher drive current than the normal con-
dition for lower supply voltage. Threshold voltage variation can modify the inversion
charge and also the carrier mobility. Reduction in threshold voltage increases the ef-
fective gate capacitance and the mobility of the carriers. So higher drive currents can
be obtained.
From the designing point of view there is no basic differece with the conven-
tional design, except that in DTMOS circuits gate and the body terminal will be
tied up together. Hence the NAND and NOR structure is given for the analysis of
the DTMOS logic. In DTMOS NAND gate, when A = B = 0, then the PUN will be on
and the PDN will be off. So the output node potential will be raised up to the VDD.
Similarly, when A = B = 1, PUN will be turned off but the PDN will be turned on
to pass the logic zero to the output node. Hence the operation is very much sim-
ilar with the conventional operation. However, one should remember that due to
the dynamic variation of the threshold voltage, leakage currrent and the leakage
power dissipation will be very less compared to the conventional subthreshold logic
operation.
The structure of DTMOS NAND and NOR structures is shown in Fig. 4.45. The out-
put waveform of the NAND and the NOR gates using DTMOS structures is shown in Fig.
4.46 and 4.47, which is detailed in this section. It has been observed that completely
full swings are obtained during the operations. Because of full swing, comparatively
larger loads can also be driven by the DTMOS circuits. Hence pulse width of 100 ,s
is chosen during the operation. So the frequency is 10 KHz. If we increase the fre-
quency, then the logic degradation will be observed, as in high frequency regime, and

the output load capacitor will not be able to charge or discharge completely. In other
words, low operating currents will not be able to drive the capacitive load. DTMOS
circuits are preferable in low frequency regime for better logic swing [16].
For the further design and the analysis of the DTMOS cicrcuits, two more examples
are given here. In Figure 4.48, the implemented function is Y = A + B (C + D). Also it
can be observed from the ﬁgure that same principles have been used during the im-
plementation of the function. In PDN, the nMOS having gate inputs of C and D are
connected in parallel. This is connected in series with the nMOS having gate input B.
Whole combination will be in parallel with the nMOS having gate input A. Pull-up
network will be complementary to the PDN. It must be noted that in case of every
MOSFET, the gate and body terminals are tied up to make the DTMOS structure. In the

ment the full adder circuit, which is the basic building block of the multiplier. Hence
Fig. 4.49 shows the output waveform of the Y = A + B (C + D) and the XOR gate is given
for the ease of understanding the operations.
A full adder circuit in CADENCE SPICE Spectra and its output waveform in KHz
regime of frequency are given for better understanding of the circuit. The transistor
level schematic, test-bench setup and output waveform of the subthreshold DTMOS
full adder circuit is shown in Fig. 4.50–4.52 respectively.
Parallel adders can add the binary strings of different length or of similar length
in parallel. The schematic of a 4-bit parallel adder is given in Figure 3.8 for the ease
of understanding. N bit parallel adder consists of N number of full adder block which
has been discussed in the previous section. Hence we set N = 4. Similar length, i.e. 4
bits of augend and addend, has been chosen. Hence i-th position of augend bit will
be added with the i-th position of the addend bit. Produced sum will be the output of

DTMOS full adder. The input ports are given at the top left side. The output ports are
given at the top from the right end, i.e. S0, S1, S2 and S3. Vertically rightmost four ports
are A0, A1, A2 and A3; next set of four ports are B0, B1, B2 and B3; next ports are CIn and
VDD and the bottommost port is the ground node. Hence VDD and ground node have
been introduced separately for the ease of layout.
Hence the supply voltage is chosen as 400 mV in TSMC 180 nm technology node.
The threshold voltage is almost 600 mV. So the circuit is operating in the subthreshold
mode. The frequency is varied from 5 to 500 KHz. To check the workability of the 4-bit
adder, high frequency regime has been selected. At low frequency the power dissipa-
tion of the circuit is less and the performance is also satisfactory. Hence a simple chart
regarding the power dissipation of the 4-bit parallel adder is given to show the ad-
vantage of the DTMOS in terms of the ultralow power dissipations. The frequency and
corresponding power dissipation are tabulated in Table 4.7 and plotted in Fig. 4.56.
If we would like to design more complex circuit then multiplier would be the
best structure to check the workability of the DTMOS circuits in case of complex gate
design. Hence the basic 2 × 2 multiplier circuit has been given as a basic building
block of the higher order multiplier. The implementation of the 2 × 2 multiplier has
been done by taking full adder block and AND gates. The AND gates and the full ad-
ders used in the 2 × 2 multiplier are also of DTMOS type, i.e. gate and body are tied up
in case of nMOS and pMOS.
4.14 ECLR Structure
Efﬁcient charge recovery adiabatic logic (ECRL) is one of the most simple approaches
to implement low power VLSI circuits in superthreshold regime [17]. ECRL uses
the cascode voltage swing logic (CVSL) network [18] having the differential inputs
to produce complementary output. ECRL gates can be designed and implemented
using single sinuosoidal, triangular or trapezoidal power clock. Inverter structure

ECRL NAND/AND and NOR/OR gates are given in Figure 4.61 and the output wave-
form of ECRL NAND/AND gate in Fig. 4.62 and ECRL NOR/OR gate in 4.63. The truth
table of ECRL NAND/AND qate and NOR/OR gate is shown in Table 4.9 and 4.10 re-
spectively. Hence in both gates, CVSL structure is used to design the pull-down part.
I(t) is the supply clock which ramps up and down in between 0 and the VDD. When
the supply clock ramps up from 0 to VDD, the phase can be turned as charging phase
whereas when the supply clock ramps down from the VDD to 0, the phase is termed
as discharging phase. In ECRL gates, when the inputs are applied, any one of the two
pull-down paths turns on or off. So any one of the two output nodes remains at ground
potential and the other node follows the supply clock very closely to produce a supply
clock like voltage waveform.
Hence in ECRL NAND left-sided PDN is basically the PDN of static CMOS NAND
gate and the right-sided one is the complementary structure of the left one. The op-
eration of the ECRL NAND/AND gate can be explained in terms of a speciﬁc input
combination, i.e. A = 1 and B = 0, assuming the supply clock ramps up from 0 to VDD.
Under this input combination, M3 and M4 will be on and off. So NAND output node
will be in ﬂoating condition for some time interval. Whereas M6 will be on and will pull
down the AND node to ground potential. Resultantly, the M1 or pMOS will be turned
of as the logic “0” will be applied to gate of M1. So NAND node will be charged up
by following the supply clock very closely during the charging phase. During dischar-
ging phase, AND node will remain at ground potential as there will be no changes in
the input combinations. NAND node will also follow the supply clock closely just like
the charging phase, and the stored charge in the NAND node will be sent back to the
supply. Thus very less amount of energy will be dissipated during the total charging
and discharging phase. Simpliﬁed truth table for the ECRL is given below for better
understanding of the operations.
Similarly ECRL NOR/OR gate can be implemented by using the CVSL network.
Hence pull-down and complementary PDN will be used to implement the NOR/OR
structure. Operation of the NOR/OR gate can also be explained using some input

combination, i.e. A = 1 and B = 0, assuming the supply clock ramps up from 0 to
VDD. Under this input combination, M3 and M4 will be off and on, repectively. So OR
output node will be in ﬂoating condition for some time interval. Whereas, M5 will be
on because of higher logic input at the gate and will pull down the NOR output node
to ground potential. Resultantly, the M1 or pMOS will be turned of as the logic “0” will
be applied to the gate of M1. So OR output node will be charged up by following the
supply clock very closely during the charging phase. During discharging phase, NOR

node will remain at ground potential as there will be no changes in the input combin-
ations. OR node will also follow the supply clock closely just like the charging phase,
and the stored charge in the OR node will be sent back to the supply. Thus very less
amount of energy will be dissipated during the total charging and discharging phases.
During the discharging phase, when the supply clock voltage approaches |VTp|
(threshold voltage of the pMOS), the pMOS transistor gets disconnected. So complete
recovery of the charges is not possible. Hence instead of logic “0”, we will get few
millivolts due to the stored charges. The associated energy loss due to the incomplete
recovery of the charges is approximately CL|VTp|2. During the charging process, in the
begining pMOS transistors will be in ﬂoating mode and charges leak away which can-
not be retreived. This type of loss can be termed as nonadiabatic loss. Fig. 4.64 shows
the output waveform of the ECRL XOR/XNOR gate considering sinusoidal source.
However, inspite of this nonadiabatic loss, ECRL is very much advantageous re-
garding the power dissipation. For example, it has been observed that the 16-bit ECRL
carry look ahead adder consumes less than 50% of energy compared to the CMOS
structure. Few combinational structures using ECRL have also been discussed here
for the ease of understanding.
2 to 1 MUX and 4 to 1 multiplexers are given in Figures 4.65. and 4.66 and its truth
table is shown in Table 4.11. Respectively. In 2 to 1 MUX, the output expression is
Y = AS + BS.
When S = 0, A will be selected and when S = 1, B will be selected. Hence the pull-up
structure consists of the cross-coupled pMOS transistors. In case of PDN, we are using
complementary nMOS tree, which basically consists of CVSL network. In Figure 4.65,
when S = 0 and A = 1, out node is pulled down at ground potential, which also turns
on the right-sided pMOS to charge up the outb node in the charging phase. During

discharging phase, as the input condition remains same, stored charge in outb node
will be sent back to the supply clock by the following the same path. So a full swing
is observed at outb node, very similar to the supply clock. Similarly, when S = 0 and
A = 0, outb node will be pulled down to the ground potential which also turns on the
left pMOS transistor. Resultantly, out node will be charged up and later discharged by

following the supply clock very closely. So it can be mentioned that the 2 to 1 MUX
output will be obtained at outb node, and out node will produce the complementary
logic.
Figure 4.66 shows the design of 4 to 1 MUX. The four inputs A, B, C and D will be
selected by the select lines S1 and S2. The relationship is given below:
Y = AS1S2 + BS1S2 + CS1S2 + DS1S2
When S1 and S2 are set to logic 0, and A = 1, then the out node will be connected
with ground node through the left-sided nMOS network (left most path out of the four
paths). Ground potential of out node will turn on the pMOS transistor and the outb
node will be charged up by following the supply clock through the turned-on pMOS.
Also during the discharging phase, almost total stored charge of the outb node will be
sent back to the supply clock through the same pMOS path and out node remains at
the ground potential. Hence, in outb node we obtain the 4 to 1 MUX output, and out
node produces the complementary logic output.
As we know that the adder is the basic building block of arithmetic blocks, a
simple adder structure in ECRL logic is given in Figure 4.67. The adder consists of sum
and carry structures. In both the structures, DCVS network is used to design the com-
plementary logic paths. Hence the DCVS network for the sum/sumb implementation
has been modiﬁed a bit to reduce the transistor count. This will also reduce the silicon
area of the adder. This would be much more advantageous when we would design
the multiplier circuits. Sum and sumb represent the complementary output nodes. To
obtain a stable output waveform one can connect the load capacitors in the output
nodes. Here one-stage full adder adiabatic logic system is implemented which will be
used as a basic block in next designs.

Figure 4.68: Output waveform of the ECRL full adder with a trapezoidal clock source.
Hence, >(t) is the clock supply source, here is a trapezoidal waveform. If we reduce
the operating frequency of the ECRL, single sinusoidal clock source can be used as a
supply clock. In that case buffer circuits are required after regular intervals to reduce
the logic degradation in inner stage. 100 MHz clock frequency is used with a 2 V amp-
litude. 50 fF output loads have been set at the output nodes to obtain more stable
output waveforms.
The output waveform is given in Figure 4.68. Output voltage will be measured at
the T/2 time instant where T is the width of the clock pulse. So the distorted shape
at the beginning or the end of the clock can be ignored. However, proper transistor
sizing can minimize the distortion up to some extent. Here, as high frequency regime
has chosen, the output nodes could not discharge properly. In case of low frequency
operations, the output waveforms become better and also signiﬁcant advantage can
be observed in case of power savings.
However, the power dissipation of ECRL full adder for different frequencies is
given in Table 4.12. It can be observed that with frequency, the power dissipation of
the ECRL full adder increases signiﬁcantly. Power dissipation for different load, keep-
ing the frequency constant at 10 MHz, is given in Table 4.13. As the load increases, the
energy dissipation will also increase as the energy dissipation is directly proportional
to the square of the capacitive load. So the rate of change of energy or the power also
increases.

4-2 compressor is also important logic structure for the implementation of the tree
multiplier. A 4-2 compressor has four inputs and two outputs. The governing equation
of the 4-2 compressor is given by
I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 + CIn = Sum + 2(Carry + COut).
The structure is given in Figure 4.69. Hence the inputs are I1, I2, I3 and I4 and two
outputs are sum and carry. Also, carry-in (CIn) and a carry-out (COut) have been set.
The input CIn is the output from the previous lower signiﬁcant compressor. The COut
is the output to the compressor in the next signiﬁcant stage. Here, one point has to
be remembered that COut should be independent of the input CIn as it can accelerate
the carry, save summation of the partial products. Two different structures are given
to implement the 4-2 compressor. As 4-2 compressor has higher capacitive load at the
output, it consumes much more energy. Full adder-based implementation has sim-
pler architecture compared to Figure 4.70(b). However, Figure 4.70(b) is an optimized
one as the length of the critical path is smaller. So it provides much faster operation
compared to the full adder-based implementation.
The output waveform of the 4-2 compressor is given in Figure 4.70. Hence
sinusoidal clock source is used to show the workability of the ECRL logic block.

1.8 Volt peak-to-peak voltage is chosen with 50 MHz frequency. Single sinusoidal
clock can be generated using LC circuits and minimal power consumption can be
enjoyed. Also single clock source can minimize the power dissipation and the silicon
area, as it simpliﬁes the distribution and the management of the clocks. Hence power
dissipation is tabulated taking the load ﬁxed at 50 fF.
For each bit in a binary sequence to be added, the carry look ahead logic will
determine whether that bit pair will generate a carry or propagate a carry and is shown
in Fig. 4.71. This allows the circuit to “pre-process” the two numbers being added to

determine the carry ahead of time. Then, when the actual addition is performed, there
is no delay from waiting for the ripple carry effect (or time it takes for the carry from
the ﬁrst full adder to be passed down to the last full adder).

C1 = G1 + P1G0 + P1P0CIn

(4.3)
The carry look ahead 4-bit adder can also be used in a higher-level circuit by hav-
ing each CLA logic circuit produce a propagate and generate signal to a higher level
CLA logic circuit. The group propagate (PG) and group generate (GG) for a 4-bit
CLA are
PG = P0 ⋅P1 ⋅P2 ⋅P3
GG = G3 + G2 ⋅P3 + G1 ⋅P3 ⋅P2 + G0 ⋅P3 ⋅P2 ⋅P1
(4.4)
Using 4-bit CLAs together we can design 8-bit CLA. The schematic of adiabatic 8-bit
carry look ahead adder is shown in Figure 4.72. We know the path from the input to
the output signal that is likely to take the longest time, which is designated as “crit-
ical path”. In Figure 4.72 circles and arrows highlight the fast carry computation tree.
As opposed to ripple carry adder, the critical path in the CLA travels in vertical dir-
ection rather than a horizontal one as shown in Figure 4.72. Therefore the delay of
CLA is not directly proportional to the size of the adder N, but to the number of levels
used. This log dependency makes CLA one of the theoretically fastest structures for
addition.

The schematic was simulated in cadence analog design environment [19]. All the in-
puts were buffered and the load capacitors were placed at the output nodes of each
block. The simulation environment is given below.

– VDD: 1.8 V
– Load: 10 fF
– Clock: 10 MHz
The ﬁnal simulation waveform of 16-bit CLA is given below. All the output nodes
are loaded by 25 fF capacitors to get more stable waveform. A counting sequence {A} =
{A32, A31, . . . , A2, A1} = {000 ⋅⋅⋅000, 000 ⋅⋅⋅001, 000 ⋅⋅⋅010, . . . , 111 ⋅⋅⋅111}
and {B} = {B32, B31, . . . , B2, B1} = {000 ⋅⋅⋅000, 000 ⋅⋅⋅000, . . . , 000 ⋅⋅⋅.000}
with Cin = 0 is assigned as the test patterns in case of CLA. The output results are
{Z} = {S32, S31, . . . , S2, S1} = {000 ⋅⋅⋅001, 000 ⋅⋅⋅010, 000 ⋅⋅⋅011, . . . , 100 ⋅⋅⋅000}.
Hence Z1 = 101010101 . . . , Z2 = 01100110011 . . . , Z3 = 0001111000011110000 . . . , and
so on. Waveforms of some output nodes in a 8-bit carry look ahead adder are shown
in Figure 4.73.
The ﬁnal layout was veriﬁed by running layout versus schematic (LVS) from As-
sura [20]. The log ﬁle is provided. However, the hardware-assisted emulation was
not done due to technical limitations. The performance of the implementation was
tested with the aim of determining the efﬁciency with which the system completes
its tasks. Here we have provided the graphical output from the ﬁnal simulation.
The design methodology called design for manufacturability (DFM) includes a set of
techniques to modify the design of integrated circuits (ICs) in order to make them more
manufacturable, i.e. to improve their functional yield, parametric yield, or reliability.
Detailed characterization of a statistically signiﬁcant number of ICs is required before
the project can be released to full production. This ensures that there are no inexplic-
able yield losses and the product will have a stable life once it is in full production.
Preproduction characterization is generally conducted on automated test equipment

(ATE), usually concurrently with the development of the production test. The methods
and the critical aspects of the preproduction characterization are documented by our
engineers during the electrical design phase and we provide the level of support ne-
cessary to the test engineers for test development. For manufacturability, the design
must be modiﬁed, where possible, to make it as easy and efﬁcient as possible to pro-
duce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly
layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry. Since
errors are expensive, time-consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is
the rule, making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly and checking that
the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully. The initial prototypes come from
a matrix run to represent the expected variations of the IC manufacturing process.
Then the design data is turned into photomasks in mask data preparation (MDP).

170
4 Advanced Combinational Circuit Design
Mask data preparation is the step that translates an intended set of polygons on an
IC layout into a form that can be physically written by the photomask writer. Usu-
ally this involves fracturing complex polygons into simpler shapes, often rectangles
and trapezoids that can be written by the mask writing hardware. Typically a design
is delivered to MDP in GDSII or OASIS format, and later fracturing is written out
in a proprietary format speciﬁc to the mask writer. Next wafer fabrication, die test
and packaging are done. Post-silicon validation and debug is the last step in the
development of a semiconductor IC. During the pre-silicon process, engineers test
devices in a virtual environment with sophisticated simulation, emulation and formal
veriﬁcation tools. In contrast, post-silicon validation tests occur on actual devices
running at speed in commercial, real-world system boards using logic analyzer and
assertion-based tools.
Table 4.14 shows the power dissipation for varying bit length for different types
of multiplier circuits. The performance of multipliers is crucial for multimedia ap-
plications such as 3-D graphics and signal processing systems, which depend on
the execution of large numbers of multiplications. Hence a Vedic Multiplier, based
on UrdhvaTiryakbhyam Sutra (UTS) of Vedic Arithmetic, a promising approach due
to less computational time, has also been given [21]. The multiplier is based on
UTS of ancient Vedic Mathematics. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the
advantages of concurrent generation and addition of partial products in Vedic Mul-
tiplier. It can be classiﬁed as a serial-parallel multiplier, which serves as a good
trade-off between the time-consuming serial multipliers and area-consuming parallel
multipliers.
UrdhvaTiryakbhyam Sutra: UrdhvaTiryakbhyam Sutra is a general multiplication
formula applicable to all cases of multiplication. It literally means “Vertically and
Crosswise”. Let us explain UTS with an example. The numbers to be multiplied are
written on two consecutive sides of the square as shown in Figure 4.74. The square
is divided into rows and columns where each row/column corresponds to one of the
digits of either a multiplier or a multiplicand. These small boxes are partitioned into
two halves by the crosswise lines. Block diagram of the Vedic Multiplier is given in Fig-
ure 4.74. The schematics are given in Figures 4.75–4.77. The output waveform is shown
in Fig. 4.78.

Schematic Editor that helped us complete this project smoothly.
– “Snap to Diamond” is an excellent feature that saves time and effort in large
schematics.
– Multiple labels/pins addition by writing their names separated by space is a very
handy feature. “Bus Expansion” also saves a lot of time when dealing with bus
routing.
– User conﬁgurable rule is another great feature that helps ﬁnding bugs in early

The creation of the mask layout is one of the most important steps in the full-custom
design ﬂow, because physical layout design is very tightly linked to overall circuit
performance (area, speed and power dissipation). We have taken utmost care to design
the layout in the smallest area possible while maintaining symmetry in the design. We
have then eliminated all Design Rule Check (DRC) errors so that the design does not vi-
olate any of the layout design rules of the fabrication process, in order to ensure a high
probability of defect-free fabrication. Then, using LVS comparison, we have veriﬁed
that the layout actually implements the required functionality. After that, post-layout
simulation can be performed taking into account the geometry of the circuit to include
the parasitic effects from the layout view.

5 Advanced Energy-reduced Sequential Circuit
Design
5.1 Introduction to Sequential Circuit
Combinational circuits, as we have seen in the last chapter, cannot store any state
information. They have the property that the output of a logic block is only a func-
tion of the current input values [1–3]. Thus, the output levels at any given time point
are directly determined as Boolean functions of the input variables applied at that
time. They are also known as non-regenerative circuits, since there is no feedback re-
lationship between the output and the input. But virtually all useful systems require
storage of state information, leading to another class of circuits called sequential lo-
gic circuits. In these circuits, the output depends not only upon the current values of
the inputs but also upon preceding input values [4–6]. In other words, a sequential
circuit remembers some of the past history of the system – it has memory. A sequen-
tial circuit consisting of a combinational circuit and a memory block in the feedback
loop is shown in Figure 5.1. The regenerative behavior resulting in memory function of
sequential circuits is due to a feedback connection between the output and the input.
Figure 5.2 shows the block diagram of a ﬁnite state machine (FSM), which is a
sequential circuit having the capability of holding the system state. The outputs of
the FSM are a function of the current inputs and the current state. The next state is
determined based on the current state and the current inputs and is fed to the inputs
of registers [7, 8]. On the rising edge of the clock, the next state bits are copied to
the outputs of the registers (after some propagation delay), and a new cycle begins.
The register then ignores changes in the input signals until the next rising edge. The
register can be either positive or negative edge triggered.
5.2 Basics of Regenerative Circuits
The logic circuits in general can be classiﬁed into two types: (a) non-regenerative
(combinational) and (b) regenerative (sequential) circuits as shown in Figure 5.3. Re-
generative operation or memory function based on positive feedback falls under the
class of elements called multivibrator circuits.
The basic regenerative circuits can be classiﬁed into three groups: (a) bistable;
(b) monostable; and (c) astable.
Bistable circuits have two stable states or operational modes as the name suggests.
These stable states can be attained under certain input and output combinations. In
contrast, the monostable circuits have only one stable operating point (state). Even
if the circuit experiences an external perturbation, the output eventually returns to
the single stable state after a certain time period. Finally, in astable circuits (ring

to a stable state. The bistable element is its most popular and important representat-
ive circuit. All basic latch and ﬂip-ﬂop circuits, registers and memory elements used
in digital systems fall into this category.

5.2 Basics of Regenerative Circuits
179
In this section, we will discuss about the basic behavior and application of
bistable circuits. Static memories use positive feedback to create a bistable circuit–
a circuit having two stable states that represent 0 and 1.
The basic bistable element to be examined in this section consists of two identical
cross-coupled inverter circuits, as shown in Figure 5.4(a). Here, the output voltage of
inverter no. 1 is equal to the input voltage of inverter no. 2, i.e. Vo1 = Vi2 and Vo2 = Vi1.
In order to investigate the static input–output behavior of both inverters, we must
plot the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of both the inverters as shown in Fig-
ure 5.4(b) separately. Consequently, we can also plot the VTC of inverter no. 2 using
the same axis pair of inverter no. 1, as shown in Figure 5.4(c), resulting in butterﬂy
plots [9–11].
It can be seen that the two VTCs intersect at three points. The resulting cir-
cuit has only three possible operation points (A, B and C), as demonstrated on the
combined VTC.
Simple reasoning can help us to make the conjecture that two of these operating
points are stable. Under the condition that the gain of the inverter in the transient re-
gion is larger than 1, only A and B are stable operation points, and C is a metastable

operation point. If the circuit is initially operating at one of these two stable points,
it will preserve this state unless it is forced externally to change its operating point.
Note that the gain of each inverter circuit, i.e. the slope of the respective voltage trans-
fer curves, is smaller than unity at the two stable operating points. Thus, in order to
change the state by moving the operating point from one stable point to the other,
a sufﬁciently large external voltage perturbation must be applied so that the voltage
gain of the inverter loop becomes larger than unity.
The circuit has two stable operating points; hence, the name is bistable. Let us as-
sume that the cross-coupled inverter 1 is biased at point C. Noise may cause deviation
from this bias point and is ampliﬁed and regenerated around the circuit loop [12–14].
As a result, the gain around the loop is larger than 1. A small deviation is applied to
Vi1 (biased in C). This deviation is ampliﬁed by the gain of the inverter. The enlarged
divergence is applied to the second inverter and ampliﬁed once more. The bias point
moves away from C until one of the operation points A or B is reached. In conclusion,
C is an unstable operation point. Every deviation (even the smallest one) causes the
operation point to run away from its original bias. The chance is indeed very small
that the cross-coupled inverter pair is biased at C and stays there. Operation points
with this property are termed metastable.
Figure 5.4(d) demonstrates qualitatively that the potential energy is minimum at
two stable operating points, where the voltage gains are less than “1”. In contrast, the
energy is maximum at the metastable point, where the voltage gains of the inverters
are maximum.
Thus, the circuit has two stable operating points corresponding to the two en-
ergy minima, and one unstable operating point corresponding to the potential energy
maximum.
In summary, a bistable circuit has two stable states. In the absence of any trigger-
ing, the circuit remains in a single state (assuming that the power supply remains
applied to the circuit), and hence remembers a value. A trigger pulse must be ap-
plied to change the state of the circuit. Another common name for a bistable circuit
is ﬂip-ﬂop (sometimes an edge-triggered register is also referred to as a ﬂip-ﬂop).
Figure 5.4 below shows two back-to-back connected inverters. Assuming ini-
tially the inverters are in unstable operating point. Therefore, all four transistors are
working in saturation region resulting in a maximum loop gain. A small voltage per-
turbation will cause signiﬁcant changes in the operating modes of the transistors.
Thus, the output voltage of the two inverters will settle in either VOh or in VOl, re-
spectively, as shown in 5.5. The direction in which each output voltage diverges is
determined by the initial perturbation polarity.
In brief, every sequential logic circuit has two stable stages that are comple-
mentary to each other. In the absence of triggering, circuit will remain in the stable
stage. In the presence of triggering, circuit may switch or ﬂip into another stable
stage. These bistable circuits can also be termed as ﬂip-ﬂop. Flip-ﬂop is the main
block of sequential architectures. Here, design and analysis of low power ﬂip-ﬂop

will be discussed in depth for the implementation of ultra-low power sequential logic
architecture.
5.3 Basic SR Flip-ﬂop/Latch
As we have learnt from the previous section that a bistable circuit consists of two cross-
coupled inverters, the circuit can preserve its state (acting as a memory) as long as
power supply is present. However, it is not possible in a two-inverter circuit to change
the state. To do so, we must add simple switches to the bistable element, i.e. extra
circuitry must be added to enable control of the memory states. Figure 5.6(a) shows
a simple SR latch with two triggering inputs S (set) and R (reset). SR latch is also
called an SR ﬂip-ﬂop, since two stable states can be switched back and forth. This
circuit is similar to the cross-coupled inverter pair with NOR gates replacing the in-
verters. The second input of the NOR gates is connected to the trigger inputs (S and R),
which make it possible to force the outputs Q and Q to a given state. If a positive
(or 1) pulse is applied to the S input, the Q output is forced into the 1 state (with
Q going to 0). Vice versa, a 1 pulse on R resets the ﬂip-ﬂop and the Q output goes
to 0. It can easily be seen that when both input signals are equal to logic “0”, the SR
latch will operate exactly like the simple cross-coupled bistable element examined
earlier, i.e. it will preserve (hold) either one of its two stable operating points (states)
as determined by the previous inputs. Finally, consider the case in which both of the
inputs S and R are equal to logic “1”. In this case, both output nodes will be forced
to logic “0”, which conﬂict with the complementarity’s of Q and Q, i.e. this input
combination does not correspond to the deﬁnition of ﬂip-ﬂop that Q and Q must be
complementary.

NOR-based SR latch; and (f) voltages for set operation.
Therefore, this input combination is not permitted during normal operation and is
considered to be a not-allowed or forbidden condition. The symbol of SR latch is
shown in Figure 5.6(b). The truth table of SR latch is shown in Figure 5.6(c).
The operational modes of the transistor in NOR-based SR latch can be found.
When S = “1” = VOh and R = “0” = VOl, both M1 and M2 are ON; at the same time,
M3 and M4 become OFF. As a result, the voltage on Q is equal to VOh = “1” and output
voltage on Q equals to “0” = VOl. In contrast when R = “1” = VOh and S = “0” = VOl, the
situation will be reversed (M1 and M2 turned OFF and M3 and M4 turned ON).
When both S and R = “0” = VOl, there are two possibilities. Depending on the
previous state of the SR latch, either M2 or M3 will be ON, while both of the trigger
transistors M1 and M4 are OFF. This will generate a logic low level of VOl = 0 at one of
the output nodes, while the complementary output node is at VOh.

5.3.1 NAND Gate-based Negative Logic SR Latch
Figure 5.7(a) shows a NAND gate-based SR latch. Here two input NAND gates are cross-
coupled with one input with the other input terminal connected to external trigger
inputs S and R. To preserve a state one must apply an input combination of “1” to
both S and R. If S = “0” and R = “1” the output Q attains a voltage equals VOl. Thus,
we can observe that to set the ﬂip-ﬂop we must have S = “0” and R = “1”. Similarly, to
reset the ﬂip-ﬂop S = “1” and R = “0” must be applied [15, 16]. The conclusion is that
the NAND-based SR latch responds to active low input signals, as opposed to the NOR-
based SR latch, which responds to active high inputs. For S = R = “0”, both the output
wants to attain a logic high, which is a forbidden condition. The truth table, gate-level
schematic and symbol are shown in Figure 5.7(b) and 5.7(c) and 5.7(d), respectively.
The small circles at the S and R input terminals indicate that the circuit responds to
active low input signals.
5.3.2 Clocked SR Latch
The SR ﬂip-ﬂops discussed so far are asynchronous and do not require a clock signal.
Most systems operate in a synchronous fashion with transition events referenced to a
clock. In a clocked latch, the outputs will respond to the input levels only during the
active period of a clock pulse. For simple reference, the clock pulse will be assumed
to be a periodic square waveform, which is applied simultaneously to all clocked logic
gates in the system.
The gate-level diagram of a clocked SR latch is shown in Figure 5.8(a). One can
observe that when the clock signal is equal to “0”, the output of the AND gate is equal

to “0”; thus, the input signals have no inﬂuence to the circuit output. As long as the
output of the AND gates is “0”, the SR latch holds its current state without getting in-
ﬂuenced by the current S and R inputs. When the clock becomes high equal to “1”,
then the S and R values are permitted to reach the SR latch and may change the state
of the latch. Notice that S = R = “1” remains still a not-allowed input combination in
clocked SR latch. When S = R = 1 and clock is high, then both the outputs try to go
to level “0”. When the clock pulse becomes “0”, the state of the latch cannot be pre-
dicted. The output can be in either state caused by slight difference in delay between
the output signals.
Figure 5.8(b) shows a sample waveform of clocked SR latch. It is evident from the
waveform that the latch is strictly level sensitive during active edge of the clock pulse.
Any change in the input when the clock is high is reﬂected in the output. Even a nar-
row spike or glitch in the input during active period of click causes changes in the
output.
Figure 5.8(c) shows a neither clocked NOR-based SR latch using two simple AOI
gates, resulting in a smaller transistor count.
The gate-level diagram of a NAND gate-based clocked SR latch is shown in Fig-
ure 5.9(a). Notice that the inputs S, R and clock are all active low signals, i.e. when the
clock is high (“1”) the input signals cannot change the state of the latch. The inputs
will inﬂuence the outputs only when the clock is active, i.e. clock = “0”.
A different realization of clocked NAND-based SR latch is shown in Figure 5.9(b).
Notice here that the clock, S and R are all active high signals, i.e. latch is set when
S = “1”, R = “0” and clock = “1” and latch is reset when S = “0”, R = “1” and clock = “1”.
The latch preserves its state as long as the clock signal is inactive, i.e. clock = “0”.

5.4 Clocked JK Latch
The SR latch and gated SR latch both are having problems with not-allowed/forbidden
input combinations. The state of the latch is indeterminate when both are active at the
same time. This problem can be solved by drawing a feedback line from the output to
the input, resulting in a circuit called JK latch. It was named after Jack Kilby, who ﬁrst
produced a digital IC (JK ﬂip-ﬂop).
Figure 5.10(a) shows the clocked NAND gate-based JK latch gate-level schematic
diagram. Figure 5.10(b) shows the symbol of JK latch. Figure 5.10(c) shows all NAND
implementation of JK latch circuit. Figure 5.10(d) shows the truth table of JK latch.
A JK latch is also sometimes known as JK ﬂip-ﬂop.
When the clock is active, to set the latch we must apply J = “1” and K = “0”. To reset
the latch we must apply J = “0” and K = “1”. When J = “0” and K = “0”, the latch holds
its current state. When the clock is inactive the latch preserves its state. Therefore,
J and K resemble the set and reset inputs of SR latch. Now if both J = K = “1” during
active clock period, the latch switches its state due to feedback. JK latch does not have
a not-allowed input combination like in SR latch circuits.
Still there is problem in a JK latch. When J = K = “1” in active phase of clock,
the output oscillates (toggles) due to feedback until the clock becomes inactive or any

of the input signal becomes “0”. To get rid of this problem, the clock width must be
smaller than input-to-output propagation delay of the latch. In that case, the clock will
switch its state before the output level has an opportunity to switch again. However, it
is difﬁcult to impose this restriction in a real situation.
5.4.1 Toggle Switch
If the time period of the clock signal is less than the input-to-output propagation delay,
and if J = K = “1”, then for every clock ticking, the output will change (toggle) its state.
The resulting switch is known as toggle switch and is shown in Figure 5.11.
5.5 Master–slave Flip-ﬂop
The master–slave JK Flip-Flop removes the timing problem associated with ordinary
clocked ﬂip-ﬂops. There are two cascaded stages of latches working with opposite
phase of clock. The ﬁrst stage is called master, which is activated with the high time

period of the clock. The second stage is called the slave, which is activated with the
low time phase of the clock. When clock is high, the master is active, allowing the in-
puts J and K to pass through the latch. The output of the ﬁrst stage is set according to
the inputs given in high period of the clock. At the same time, the slave stage is deactiv-
ated, holding the previous value. When the clock pulse goes to zero, the master latch
becomes inactive and the second-stage latch called the “slave” becomes active. The
output levels of the ﬂip-ﬂop circuit are determined during this second phase, based
on the master-stage outputs set in the previous phase.
The whole latch is never transparent. During the ﬁrst phase of the clock, the ﬁrst
phase is transparent, while during second phase of the clock, the second stage is
transparent. Therefore, change in input never reﬂected directly to output in the same
phase of clock. The two stages are effectively decoupled from each other by the op-
posite phase of clock. When J = K = “1”, the circuits allow toggling, but uncontrolled
oscillations are eliminated as two stages are not coupled and they are not transparent
at any given time. Figure 5.12 shows a NOR gate-based master–slave JK ﬂip-ﬂop.
Still master–slave JK latch has one problem. When the clock pulse is high, any
narrow spike or glitch in J or K may set or reset the master latch, which may cause
unwanted state transitions, which again may get propagated to the slave stage in the
next phase of the clock. This problem is known as ones catching. This problem can be
eliminated by edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop discussed in the next section.
5.6 D Latch
The ﬂip-ﬂops designed using CMOS logic are straightforward, but they consume a
large number of transistors. In this section, we will investigate some structures that
require less number of transistors than conventional sequential circuit structures. Let
us ﬁrst consider the simple D latch circuit shown in Figure 5.13. This circuit is obtained
by modifying the NOR gate-based SR latch. The circuit shows a single input D is con-
nected to S input and its inverted version is connected to R input. When the clock is
active, the output follows the input with a propagation delay. When the clock signal
goes to zero, the output will simply preserve its state. Thus, the CLK input acts as an
enable signal, which allows data to be accepted into the D latch. D latch ﬁnds its use
in digital application for temporary storage and delay element.

5.6.1 Positive and Negative Latch
A latch is a level-sensitive circuit. A D latch passes the input D to the Q output when
the clock is high. This latch is said to be in transparent mode. When the clock is low,
the input data sampled on the falling edge of the clock is held stable at the output
for the entire phase, and the latch is in hold mode. The inputs must be stable for a
short period around the falling edge of the clock to meet setup and hold requirements.
A latch operating under the above conditions is a positive latch. Similarly, a negative
latch passes the D input to the Q output when the clock signal is low.
The signal waveforms for a positive latch and negative latch are shown in
Figure 5.14.
5.6.2 Multiplexer-based Latch
There are many ways to build latches, out of which one common technique uses trans-
mission gate multiplexers. Multiplexer-based latches can provide similar functionality
to the static SR latch, but has the important added advantage that the sizing of devices
affects only performance and does not affect the functionality. Figure 5.15 shows the

negative and positive latches based on multiplexers. For a negative latch, when clock
is low, it selects the input 0, and input D is connected to output Q. When the clock is
high, it selects the input 1, and output Q is connected by feedback. Thus for low clock,
the latch is transparent and for high clock the latch is in hold state, providing a stable

output. Similarly in the positive latch, the D input is selected when clock is high, and
the output is held (using feedback) when clock is low.
The transmission gate implementation of a positive latch using multiplexer is
shown in Figure 5.16. When CLK is high, the input transmission gate is ON and the
latch is transparent – that is, the D input is copied to the Q output. When the clock is
low, the state of D latch in current state is preserved as input switch (TG) is OFF and
loop switch (TG) is ON. Unlike the SR FF, the feedback does not have to be overridden
to write the memory and hence sizing of transistors is not critical for realizing correct
functionality. The number of transistors that the clock touches is important. This par-
ticular latch implementation is not particularly efﬁcient as it presents a load of four
transistors to the CLK signal.
It is possible to implement the same latch with clock load of two transistors using
pass transistors as shown in Figure 5.17.
The advantage of this type of latch is reduced clock load and simplicity. But nMOS
pass transistors result in a degraded high voltage of VDD–VThn to the input of the ﬁrst
inverter. This impacts noise margins and switching performance especially for a low
VDD and high VThn. It also causes static power dissipation in ﬁrst inverter, since the
maximum input voltage to the inverter equals VDD–VThn, and the pMOS device of the
inverter is never turned off, resulting in a static current ﬂow.
5.7 Master–slave Edge-triggered Flip-ﬂops
The D latch shown in Figure 5.17 is not an edge-triggered storage element because the
output changes according to the input, i.e. the latch is transparent while the clock is
high. The transparency property makes the applications of this D latch unsuitable for
counters and some data storage implementations.
Edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops are built using primitive latches. They sample the in-
put only in the time of clock transition: 0→1 for positive and 1→0 for negative
edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops. Positive and negative latches are connected in cascade in
master–slave conﬁguration to form edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops. Positive latch followed
by a negative latch forms negative edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop, whereas negative latch
followed by a positive latch forms positive edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop.

5.7 Master–slave Edge-triggered Flip-ﬂops
191
Figure 5.18 shows a positive edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop implemented by cascading ﬁrst
negative and then positive latches in master–slave conﬁguration. A multiplexer-based
latch is used in this particular implementation, although any latch could be used.
The master stage is transparent, and the D input passes to master-stage output QM
when the clock is low. During this period, the slave stage is in the hold mode, keeping
its previous value using feedback. On the rising edge of the clock, the master–slave
stops sampling the input, and the slave stage starts sampling. During the high phase
of the clock, the slave stage samples the output of the master stage (QM), while the
master stage remains in a hold mode. Since QM is constant during the high phase of
the clock, the output Q makes only one transition per cycle (Figure 5.19). The value of
Q is the value of D right before the rising edge of the clock, achieving the positive edge-
triggered effect. A negative edge-triggered register can be easily obtained by cascading
positive latch ﬁrst and then negative latch.
The transmission gate realization of the positive edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop is shown
in Figure 5.20. When the clock is low, T1 is ON and T2 is OFF in the master stage, so that
input D is sampled into QM. Also during this phase, T3 is OFF and T4 is ON in the slave
stage to complete the feedback loop of the cross-coupled inverters (I5 and I6) to hold
the state of the slave latch. When the clock goes high, the master stage stops sampling
the input and goes into a hold mode. T1 is OFF and T2 is ON, and the cross-coupled

ﬂip-ﬂop by virtue of the fact that it samples the input at the falling edge of the clock
pulse.
5.8 Timing Parameters for Sequential Circuits
There are three important timing parameters for a sequential circuit like ﬂip-ﬂop or
register.

5.8 Timing Parameters for Sequential Circuits
193
The setup time (tSu) is the time that the data inputs (D input) must be valid before
the clock transition. (For a positive edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop that is “0” to “1”, trans-
ition 0→.) The hold time (tHold) is the time the data input must remain valid after the
clock edge. Assuming that the setup and hold times are met, the data at the D input is
copied to the Q output after a worst-case propagation delay (with reference to the clock
edge) denoted by tc–q. In other words, D input must be stable before (setup time, tSetup)
and after the negative clock transition to allow time for the input and loop switch
(TG) to OFF and ON. Once the loop switch is closed and input switch is open, the out-
put is preserved. The constraint of setup and hold time must be fulﬁlled; otherwise,
metastability problem can cause chaotic behavior leading to an indeterminate (un-
predictable) state after transitional period. This situation is illustrated in Figure 5.22,
where the input D switches from “0” to “1” immediately before the clock transition oc-
curs (setup time violation). As a result, the master stage fails to latch the correct value,
and the slave stage produces an erroneous output. The timing should be properly
synchronized to avoid this kind of problem.
Assume that worst-case propagation delay of the logic circuit is denoted as tPlogic,
and minimum delay or contamination delay is denoted as tCd.
The minimum clock period T, required for proper operation of the sequential
circuit, is given by
T ≥tc–q + tPlogic + tSu
The hold time of the register imposes an extra constraint for proper operation:

where tCdregister is the minimum propagation delay (or contamination delay) of the
register.
Figure 5.23 shows the various timing constraints of D-type ﬂip-ﬂop.
5.8.1 Timing of Multiplexer-based Master–slave Flip-ﬂop
Assume that the propagation delay of each inverter is tPd_inv, and the propagation
delay of the transmission gate is tPg_tx. Also assume that the contamination delay is 0
and the inverter delay to derive CLK from CLK has a delay equal to 0. The setup time is
the time before the rising edge of the clock that the input data D must become valid.
Another way to ask the question is how long before the rising edge does the D input
have to be stable such that QM samples the value reliably. For the transmission gate
multiplexer-based register, the input D has to propagate through I1, T1, I3 and I2 before
the rising edge of the clock. This is to ensure that the node voltages on both termin-
als of the transmission gate T2 are at the same value. Otherwise, it is possible for the
cross-coupled pair I2 and I3 to settle to an incorrect value. The setup time is therefore
equal to 3 × tPd_inv + tPd_tx.
The propagation delay is the time for the value of QM to propagate to the output Q.
Note that since we included the delay of I2 in the setup time, the output of I4 is valid
before the rising edge of clock. Therefore, the delay tc-q is simply the delay through T3
and I6 (tc-q = tPd_tx + tPd_inv).
The hold time represents the time that the input must be held stable after the
rising edge of the clock. In this case, the transmission gate T1 turns off when clock
goes high and therefore any changes in the D input after clock going high are not seen
by the output. Therefore, the hold time is 0.
To obtain the setup time of the register using SPICE, we progressively skew the
input with respect to the clock edge until the circuit fails. In a similar fashion, the

hold time can be simulated. The D input edge is once again skewed relative to the
clock signal till the circuit stops functioning.
The drawback of the transmission gate register is the high capacitive load presen-
ted to the clock signal. Each register has a clock load of eight transistors. Figure 5.24
shows the approach to reduce the clock load by eliminating the feedback transmission
gate by directly cross-coupling the inverters.
The penalty for the reduced clock load is increased design complexity. The trans-
mission gate (T1) and its source driver must overpower the feedback inverter (I2) to
switch the state of the cross-coupled inverter.
5.8.2 The Sizing Requirements for the Transmission Gates
The input to inverter I1 must be brought below its switching threshold in order to
make a transition. Another problem with this scheme is the reverse conduction– that
is, the second stage can affect the state of the ﬁrst latch. When the slave stage is
on (Figure 5.25), it is possible for the combination of T2 and I4 to inﬂuence the data
stored in I1–I2 latch. As long as I4 is a weak device, this is fortunately not a major
problem.

5.9 Clock Skews due to Nonideal Clock Signal
For a master–slave ﬂip-ﬂop we need CLK and CLK signal. So far we have assumed
that CLK is a perfect inversion of CLK. The delay generated by the inverter is zero.
But this is not a good assumption. Also the variations can exist in the wires used to
route the two clock signals, or the load capacitances can vary based on data stored in
the connecting latches. This effect is known as clock skew, where two opposite phase
clock signals overlap as shown in the ﬁgure below. Clock skew/overlap causes failures
in master–slave ﬂip-ﬂop as illustrated below.
If both CLK and CLK become high for a short period of time due to clock skew, both
the master stage and slave stage sampling pass transistors become ON. Thus, there is
a direct path between input D and output Q. As a result, data at the output can change
with positive edge of the clock, which is undesirable for a negative edge-triggered ﬂip-
ﬂop. This is known as a race condition in which the value of the output Q is a function
of whether the input D arrives at node X before or after the falling edge of CLK. If node
X is sampled in the metastable state, the output will switch to a value determined
by noise in the system. Due to the clock overlap between CLK and CLK, node A can
be driven by both D and B, resulting in an undeﬁned state in a master–slave ﬂip-ﬂop
shown in Figure 5.26.
This problem of clock skew can be solved by using nonoverlapping clocks as
shown in Figure 5.27 and by keeping the nonoverlap time tNonoverlap between the clocks
large enough such that no overlap occurs even in the presence of clock-routing delays.
During the nonoverlap time, the ﬂip-ﬂop is in the high-impedance state – the feedback
loop is open, the loop gain is zero and the input is disconnected. Leakage will destroy
the state if this condition holds for too long a time. Hence, the name pseudo-static: the
register employs a combination of static and dynamic storage approaches depending
upon the state of the clock.

5.10.1 SR Latch and Flip-ﬂop
SR latch is one of the simplest latch circuits having two triggering inputs “S” and “R”
for set or reset operation of the outputs. These inputs can set or reset the output nodes
externally. Hence, the SR latch circuit has two complementary stable outputs, Q and
Qb. When Q = 250 mV, the latch is “set” and when the Q = 0, the latch is reset. SR latch
can be formed by cross-coupling two NAND or NOR gates. Hence, ﬁrst NOR-based SR
latch shown in Figure 5.28 is discussed.
In case of NOR-based latch, when both the inputs S and R are set to 0, the out-
put nodes hold the previous state. Simply it behaves like a bistable Boolean logics
as both the elements. It is known as hold operation. When S = 250 mV and R = 0,
the output Q is forced to 250 mV, and the latch is set. When S = 0 and R = 250 mV,
the output Q is forced to 0, and the latch is reset. If we apply R = S = 250 mV, both the

outputs are forced to 0. This operation simply violates the Boolean logic as both the
complementary outputs cannot remain in one stable state. So this input combination
is not allowed for NOR-based SR latch circuit, also termed as forbidden state. The truth
table of the SR latch is given as follows:

When S = VDD and R = 0, M1 and M4 will be ON and OFF, respectively, Qb node will be
set because of M1 and Q node will be charged up through the series pMOS paths. As a
result, M2 turns ON and M3 remains OFF. So “250 mV” and “0” are obtained at Qb and
Q nodes, respectively. The latch is said to be in reset mode. Reverse operations will
occur if we reverse the input combinations. When we set both the inputs to “250 mV”,
both the M1 mV and M4 will be turned ON and both Q and Qb will be forced to be at
zero. This operation is not allowed as during the operation, Boolean principles will be
violated. Assuming both the inputs are set to “0”, and if Q and Qb are initially set to
“0” and “250 mV”, because of inputs M1 and M4 will remain OFF. However, because
of the Q and Qb nodes, M2 and M3 will be turned OFF and ON, respectively. So Q and
Qb remain in the previous state.
In case of NAND-based latch, when both the inputs S and R are set to 0, both
the outputs are forced to 250 mV. This operation simply violates the Boolean logic
as both the complementary outputs cannot remain in one stable state. So this input
combination is not allowed for NAND-based SR latch circuit, also termed as forbidden
state. If we apply R = S = 250 mV, then the output nodes hold the previous state. Simply
it behaves like a bistable element. It is known as hold operation. When S = 250 mV and
R = 0, the output Q is forced to 0, the latch is reset. When S = 0 and R = 250 mV, the

Implementation of NAND-based SR latch circuit using the transistor is also given in
Figure 5.29. The operation will be very much similar to the NOR-based circuit. The
basic difference between the NAND- and NOR-based circuits lies in response to the
inputs. NAND-based latch responds to the active low input signal, whereas the NOR-
based latch circuit responds to the active high input signals.
Until now we have discussed the latch circuit, which is asynchronous in nature. In
case of latch circuit, clock is not required as it is asynchronous in nature, whereas ﬂip-
ﬂop circuits are driven by the clock input for the synchronization purpose. So ﬂip-ﬂop
circuits are not transparent like the latch circuits. Flip-ﬂop circuits can be made idle by
setting clock to logic “0” or “250 mV”. When the ﬂip-ﬂop becomes idle, then unwanted
transitions in the inputs do not affect the circuit as the disturbance cannot switch the
output swing. So, in noisy environment, ﬂip-ﬂop circuits are much more efﬁcacious
compared to the latch circuits. However, introduction to clocking scheme, distribution
and management of the clock tree add more power in case of larger blocks. However,
it is acceptable as the ﬂip-ﬂops behave more accurately in noisy environment. Hence,
clocked SR latch circuit or SR ﬂip-ﬂop is discussed in detail. SR ﬂip-ﬂop is driven by
a clock and synchronous in nature. Hence, if CLK = 0, M1 and M6 both will be turned
OFF. Triggering inputs, like S and R, can turn ON or OFF the M2 and M5 but it does not
affect the circuit operations. Depending on the output nodes M3 and M4 will be turned
ON or OFF, i.e. previous states will hold. When CLK = 0, input transitions would not
ﬂip the output nodes and simply previous stages will hold. When CLK = 250 mV, M1
and M6 will turn ON. The triggering inputs can set or reset the SR ﬂip-ﬂops. When
CLK = 250 mV and S = 250 mV, R = 0, then Qb node will be set to zero, which forces the
Q node to be at logic “1”, i.e. the ﬂip-ﬂop will be set. When both the inputs are zero and
CLK = 250 mV, the ﬂip-ﬂop holds the previous states. The problem arises when both
the inputs are set to 250 mV and CLK = 250 mV, Q and Qb nodes will be forced to zero.
These input combinations cannot be allowed and can be considered as the forbidden
stage in the operation of ﬂip-ﬂop. AOI representation of clocked SR ﬂip-ﬂop is given in
Figure 5.30 and its timing diagram is shown in Figure 5.31. In an alternative approach,
a NOR-based SR ﬂip-ﬂop is shown in Figure 5.32.

5.10.2 JK Latch and JK Flip-ﬂop
The main problem associated with the SR ﬂip-ﬂop is the forbidden state. In case of
NOR-based SR latch, if we set S = R = 250 mV or in case of NAND-based SR latch if
S = R = 0, then the outputs will be forced to either 0 or 1 state, which are basically
not allowed during the operations of the SR latch or in any bistable circuit element.
This problem can be solved using a feedback path from the outputs to the inputs.
Conversion of SR latch into JK latch or JK ﬂip-ﬂop is given in Figure 5.33. Hence, also
implementation of JK ﬂip-ﬂop using the NAND gates that respond to the active high
inputs is shown in Figure 5.34. The forbidden stage of the SR ﬂip-ﬂop becomes the
toggling mode in the JK ﬂip-ﬂop.
In all NAND-based JK ﬂip-ﬂops when we set CLK = 0, the outputs will preserve the
previous state. When the clock is set to 250 mV, the JK ﬂip-ﬂop can be set, reset or can
perform in toggle mode of operation depending on the triggering inputs. Hence, the
operation of JK ﬂip-ﬂop when the clock is set to 250 mV is discussed in brief. When
J = 250 mV and K = 0, the JK ﬂip-ﬂop is set, i.e. Q is set to 250 mV. When J = 0 and

K = 250 mV, the JK ﬂip-ﬂop is reset, i.e. Q is set to 0. When both the inputs are set
to 0, the outputs hold the previous state, i.e. hold operations will be performed by the
ﬂip-ﬂop. If both the inputs are set to logic “1”, then the outputs switch in between “0”
and “250 mV” or oscillate due to the feedback path. This toggling operation will be
continued until the clock phase becomes inactive or one input goes to “0” to set or
reset the ﬂip-ﬂop. This operation is termed as toggling. So, in JK ﬂip-ﬂop there is not
any forbidden state like the SR ﬂip-ﬂop. Truth table of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop is given below to
analyze the operation of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop. In the truth table, the relationship between J,
K and S, R is also given for the ease of understanding.

Hence, also the AOI-based implementation of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop is given for in-depth ana-
lysis of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop. AOI implementation of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop needs comparatively
less number of transistors, so the silicon area is reduced in this case. In addition, less
transistor count consumes less power without sacriﬁcing the noise immunity and the
voltage swing. The basic operations of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop will be same, which we have
mentioned earlier. Hence, when CLK = 250 mV and J = K = 250 mV, the circuit will
toggle between “0” and “250 mV”. Therefore, we can use a JK ﬂip-ﬂop as a toggle
switch. The problem is the toggling operation will be continued until one input goes
low or the clock becomes inactive. This undesirable timing problem in the JK ﬂip-ﬂop
can be eliminated by setting comparatively smaller width of the clock pulse compared
with the input-to-output propagation delay of the circuit. Also to avoid the timing
problem, clock signal will be low before the output level switches. Then the toggling
will be done once in one clock pulse for J = K = 250 mV as shown in Figure 5.35.
5.10.3 D Flip-ﬂop
In case of static circuit, the output nodes produce the true logic as long as the supply
voltage is ON. The main disadvantages of the static latches and the ﬂip-ﬂops are their

higher complexity and power dissipation, and less performance. Dynamic latches
are much more efﬁcient in terms of performance and power dissipation. Moreover,
dynamic latches require less silicon area compared to the static counterpart. How-
ever, in larger sequential architectures, many times we need to store the data on a
temporary basis. Hence, dynamic logic circuits are also advantageous over the static
logic counterparts. In dynamic circuits, the stored charge across the output capacitors
represents the logic swing. Presence of signiﬁcant amount of charge can be treated as
logic “1”, whereas the absence of charges can be treated as logic “0”. As there is always
some provision of the charge leakage through the capacitors, the stored charge can be
kept signiﬁcantly for a certain amount of time, in the order of milliseconds. Moreover,
in dynamic circuits, periodic refreshing (charging or discharging) of the output node
capacitance is required to obtain the true logic for long time.
Figures 5.36 and 5.37 show two alternative implementation of D ﬂip-ﬂop, whereas
Figure 5.38 shows four types of implementation of D ﬂip-ﬂop for low power applica-
tions. Hence, a positive edge-triggered dynamic D ﬂip-ﬂop architecture is also detailed
for the ease of understanding. Master consists of gate T1 and the next inverter, whereas

the slave consists of gate T2 and the next inverter. When master is ON, the slave
will be OFF and vice versa. The operation of the master–slave D ﬂip-ﬂop can be ex-
plained as follows: When CLK = 0, T1 will be ON and the C1 node capacitance will
be charged or discharged by following the voltage swing of input signal D. So the
output can be obtained at node 1 and the complemented Q can be obtained from
the output of the next inverter stage. As CLK = 0, so master will be ON and the
slave will be OFF, and the output will not be able to propagate through the slave
stage. Now when CLK = 250 mV, master becomes inactive and the slave turns ON.
Hence T1 turns OFF and T2 turns ON to pass the output of node 1 to node 2. Inver-
ted version of node 1 will be stored in node 2. So the ﬁnal output will be obtained
from the output of the next inverter stage. This architecture needs only eight transist-
ors that signiﬁcantly reduce the power dissipations and increase the performances
(Figure 5.38).
5.11 Adiabatic Flip-ﬂop
The structures of the adiabatic ﬂip-ﬂops are given in Figure 5.39. D, T and JK ﬂip-
ﬂops are used to show the workability of the adiabatic logic styles for ultra-low power
application. Also the pre-settable ﬂip-ﬂops are shown in Figure 5.40, which are very
much efﬁcacious for ultra-low power application.
Figure 5.41 depicts the output waveforms of adiabatic D ﬂip-ﬂop. Transistor-level
representations of the above-mentioned ECRL gates have been discussed in earlier
sections. These ﬂip-ﬂops can be used further for the implementation of the larger
sequential blocks for low power applications.

6 Introduction to Memory Design
Introduction
In the last few decades, miniaturization and their corresponding reliability issues have
been emerged as a major research topic. In this frame, low cost memory chips with low
power consumption are of paramount interest and are indispensible components of
modern life. The memory remains the driving force in the thrust for higher transistor
counts per chip and faster operation. It spearheads development and sets the pace for
VLSI in general. The aim of this chapter is to provide a broad overview of the principles
and technology of memory systems.
6.1 Types of Semiconductor Memory
Based on the type of data storage and data access, semiconductor memories can
broadly be classiﬁed into two categories, RAMs and ROMs, as shown in Figure 6.1.
As the name implies, the RAM allows entry and extraction at random. In a RAM,
the accession of any cell is random in nature with almost equal accession time, in con-
trast to sequential access memories (magnetic tapes, cassettes, etc.) where memory
accession is purely on sequential basis; i.e. data is randomly accessible, which mean
that if any address is given, read and write operation can be performed using the
following memory functions:
ReadData = Memory[ Address ];
Memory[ Address ] = WriteData;
This implies, data is written into a desired location, overwriting the information it
contains. In a RAM, data extraction (readout) procedure needs to be nondestructive;
i.e. the data at the location being read is retained. A RAM is volatile; it means that all
its information is lost when the power is removed or fails, unless battery backup is
used to maintain power. In contrast, the ROM is a ﬁxed content store and information
is extracted nondestructively. Unlike RAM it is nonvolatile.
In general, RAMs can be clustered broadly into two groups such as dynamic
RAMs (DRAM) and static RAMs (SRAM). Until the evolution and adaptation of dynamic
circuit techniques the RAMs were static.
Storage capacity increased dramatically with the adaptation of dynamic logic
design techniques in the late 1960s. All dynamic logic relies on temporary charge
storage across a nodal capacitor. Static devices need more power but can hold the
information for an indeﬁnite period of time (as long as power is supplied). The dy-
namic devices use low power, but need periodic refreshment of the stored charge, to
compensate the charges lost due to leakage. The charge tends to leak away with time

even when the transistor driving the node is off (subthreshold conduction). In DRAM
technology, the leakage demands a refresh operation at ﬁxed intervals of time (few
microseconds with current technology). Because of the one-transistor cell, DRAMs ex-
ceed the storage capacity of SRAMs for identical die size; their cost per bit (of storage)
is consequently much less. DRAMs maintain the highest RAM storage, but the SRAM
is unquestionably faster. As a result, SRAMs must not however be discounted. Their
(SRAMs) superior speed combined with the absence of overhead circuits and refresh
management ensures their continued existence [1].
The term ROM on its own stands for a mask (mask-programmed) ROM. Mask
ROMs are suited to equipment manufactured on a large scale and being operated
with ﬁxed programs already burnt (programmed) in computers. Equipment with
smaller volumes of production and operated with software undergoing development
and changes are satisﬁed far more economically with user-programmable (ﬁeld-
adjustable) PROMs (programmable ROMs). Photolithographic techniques with photo
masks are used to write the data at some stage of the fabrication process in a
masked ROM and data is written electrically after the chip is fabricated in PROM.
The various categories of such ROMs are shown in Table 6.1. User-programmable
PROMs are more popular than mask-programmable ROMs, because of their high
consumption and requirement by large number of customers. The various categor-
ies of PROMs are also shown in Table 6.1. It is not possible to modify or rewrite
the data once that is programmed in a ROM having fuse technology. In contrast,
it is possible to rewrite the data electrically in an EPROM or E2PROM. However, it
is worth mentioning that the number of the rewrite to be performed is constrained
to 104–105. In EPROMs, ultraviolet rays that can penetrate through the crystal glass
on the package are used to erase whole data in the chip simultaneously, while
high electrical voltage is used to erase data in 8-bit units in E2PROMs. A ﬂash
memory uses a very high electrical voltage to wipe out the data present inside a
block.

6.2 Memory Organization
Figure 6.2 depicts a generalized block diagram of a typical memory chip organiza-
tion. Semiconductor memories are universally organized as matrix or 2-D arrays of
1-bit storage cells. These arrays are delimited by address decoding logic and interface
circuitry connected to external signals. Each memory cell is connected with the other
cells present in the same row using a common connection (WordLine). Similarly they
are connected with the other cells in the same column using another common connec-
tion (BitLine). In this structure, there are 2N rows, same as the number of word lines,
and 2M columns, same as the number of bit lines. Thus, the array contains 2N ×2M cells
of memory.
The purpose of a row decoder is to select a particular row by enabling the row
address provided to all cells along the selected row. As a result, the contents of these
cells become available along the column lines. The column address is provided to se-
lect the particular column containing the desired data bit. Therefore, in order to access
(read/write) a speciﬁc individual cell for gaining access to the data bit stored in the
memory array, the word line and the bit line correspond to the memory array needs to
make active as per the addresses coming from the processor. There are some memory
organizations where n bits can be accessed simultaneously. For these memories, the
data from n columns are selected and routed to n data output pins simultaneously.
Normally, signal levels are different inside the memory chip (CMOS) and outside the
memory chip in board Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL). The purpose of the input and
output address buffer is to make the compatible [2].
The row and column decoders complete the tasks of row and column address se-
lection [3]. Once a particular row is selected by the row decoder, a data read or write
can be performed by selecting a single or multiple bits on particular row [4]. The
charge on one of the bit lines from each pair of bit lines on each column will dis-
charge through the enabled memory cell, representing the state of the active cells on
that column. The column decoder will enable columns and will connect the bit lines

6 Introduction to Memory Design
to the I/O lines, which are passed to the output buffer. Note that the memory cells are
small and can only sink current, not source it. The sense ampliﬁer has driving capab-
ility and is now enabled. As we explained earlier, the unbalanced bit lines will affect
the balanced sense ampliﬁer to make a transition just before the state of the bit lines
when it is enabled. Output buffers are required to force relatively large current load on
the board [5].
A write operation is performed by setting CE = 0 and R/W = 0. The input data will
be ampliﬁed by the superbuffers and applied to the I/O bit lines which will cause one-
bit line high and one-bit line low. The column decoder will select a particular column
connecting the bit lines to the I/O lines. The row decoder will select a particular row
followed by the information present in the hit lines to be written to the cell at the
intersection of the row and column.
The internal timing starts with the chip-enabled (CE) signal going low. The pre-
charge (in case of DRAM) is turned off immediately after this and is not turned on again
until the entire operation is done. The column and row decoders are then activated,
followed by the activation of the sense ampliﬁer. The sense ampliﬁer is deactivated
along with CE becoming low after the completion of the read/write process. This is
followed by disabling the decoder and then the precharge line comes on again [6].
6.3 Introduction to DRAM
In a computer system, the main memory typically consists of a high quantity of DRAM.
In VLSI circuit design, the quest for low power device design and implementation are
always in demand. The VLSI circuit efﬁciency utilizing either memory or processors
can achieve a signiﬁcant improvement using a combination of device scaling, along
with novel device structures and the usage of new material properties. For the last
few decades, memory chips have been demonstrated more than 1 million hikes in
its storage capacity [7]. One-transistor (1-T) dynamic RAM (DRAM) has initiated this
tremendous increase of capacity [8] to ﬁnd its use in almost every computing ma-
chines and other electronic gadgets and equipment [9]. One single capacitor and a
single transistor are required to construct A 1-T DRAM for storing one bit of inform-
ation, as compared to six transistors (6-T) to store one bit using SRAM technology.
Thus, DRAM technology provides high integration density and very high storage
capacity [10, 11]. The term dynamic is used to denote the leakage phenomenon in-
herent to DRAM that degrades the charge stored in the memory cell with time and
requires periodic refreshment necessary in order to retain the data stored in it, which
makes DRAM less power efﬁcient [12]. However, such power consumption can be
reduced and more speed can be achieved by reducing the leakage through the MOS-
FET [13, 14]. As scaling of conventional MOSFET beyond 100 nm is facing severe
roadblocks due to the various short channel effects (SCEs), various novel MOSFET
device structures have been considered experimentally and theoretically in recent
times. Among the several alternative technologies attempted for mitigating SCEs,

silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology presented itself as a major competitor for the
next-generation emerging CMOS technology due to its several inherent advantages
[15] like higher speed, large acceptable tolerance from radiation effects, reduced para-
sitic capacitance, reduced SCEs, better current deliverability, less leakage current and
manufacturing compatibility with the existing technology [16].
6.4 One-transistor DRAM Cell
The memory cell uses only one transistor, and a storage capacitor to store one bit
is shown in Figure 6.3. The basic requirement to construct a single unit of dynamic
random-access memory (DRAM) cell is an access transistor MA and a storage capacitor
CS. The word line signal and the bit line present in the input/output route are required
to govern the access to the capacitor via the access transistor MA. The simplicity of
the circuit makes it very attractive for high density storage. For proper operation of a
DRAM, the ﬁrst step is to validate the row address and the second step is to validate
the column address.
Step 1: To validate the row address: RAS (row address access clock) is respons-
ible for the internal validation of the row addresses arriving from the external address
pads. The row access requires a large time as rows exhibit a large time constant (due
to the connection of the several gates of memory cells).
Step 2: To validate the column address: In a similar manner, addresses present in
address pads are internally validated in a sense ampliﬁer by the CAS (column address
access clock). In contrast to row access, column accession is faster to move the data
sensed by the sense ampliﬁer to the peripheral output pin through the column decoder
and output buffer. The typical DRAM access timing (Step 1 and Step 2) is shown in
Figure 6.4.
As with any RAM, there are three feasible functions:
– Write – In order to store a data bit;
– Hold – In order to preserve the value of the data undamaged in the cell;
– Read – In order to pass on the value of the data to a peripheral circuit.

6.4.1 Write
Figure 6.5 exempliﬁes the write process. To turn on access transistor MA the word line
is activated high so that WL = “1”. Now to write a logic “1” also the bit line is charged
to the desired level (logic “1”) so that capacitor CS charges via MA. An input voltage
VIn = “0” causes the discharge of the capacitor, thus ensuring the storage of logic “0”.
6.4.2 Hold
Figure 6.6 exempliﬁes the hold operation to protect the charges stored in a DRAM ca-
pacitor. In order to achieve this, the access transistor is turned off by providing WL = 0.
As a result, the capacitor storage node becomes ideally isolated from other part of the

DRAM circuit. However, it is important to notice that, in practice, charges tend to leak
away from the capacitor storing logic “1”. Many experimental and theoretical works
have been devoted to increase the charge retention time. In order to store the data for a
longer duration, refreshing circuitry responsible for reading the data, then amplifying
it and ﬁnally rewriting the data is provided [17].
6.4.3 Read
To read the stored data in a DRAM cell, the ﬁrst step is to activate the WL. Then the
charge in Cs is put in the bit line and is detected by a specially designed sense amp-
liﬁer. The reading is destructive. During a read operation, the bit lines containing
the data are coupled with the input of a high-gain sense ampliﬁer that is designed
to provide ampliﬁcation of the voltage level. In a typical DRAM architecture shown in
Figure 6.7, the data bit line is coupled with the gates of MOSFET; as a result the bit lines
exhibit capacitive characteristics. Figure 6.8 exhibits this by the inclusion of a line ca-
pacitance CLine. In the course of a read operation, a small voltage change in the output
line appears due to the sharing of charges among the DRAM storage cell and the out-
put line capacitance. A comparator present within the sense ampliﬁer is responsible to
identify the change in voltage. It is worth mentioning that the same bit line is exploited
for reading and writing steps together, with the reverse current direction. To read, the
bit line is ﬁrst precharged to VDD/2, when the word line rises and the capacitor shares
its charges with bit line, causing a voltage change BV that can be sensed by a sense
ampliﬁer. It indicates that for a faithful operation, the DRAM capacitor must have a
large capacitance value. However, at the same time they must be physically very small
to achieve large integration density. Typically, the bit line is connected to a large num-
ber of DRAM cells and thus got a relatively large capacitance (CLine) value. Therefore

Notice that a large CS is an important requirement to provide a reasonable voltage
swing and also to retain the content of the cell for an arbitrary long time, i.e. to
increase their charge retention time.
Still DRAM manufacturers have made a major effort to develop the technology to
achieve a large capacitance cell with minimized silicon area. Different design solu-
tions are proposed to reduce the cell area in size, principally the dimension of the
DRAM capacitor responsible for storing charges. The most important technologies to
shrink the capacitor area without altering its value are (1) to utilize new capacitor
shapes to ﬁt into a minimum surface area but having larger effective capacitor area and
(2) to increase the dielectric constant of the trench oxide [20] using high-k dielectric.
The memory cell capacitance has been improved by using advanced cell structures
and a high permittivity (%) dielectric material such as Ta2O5.
6.5 Capacitor in DRAM
The two established structures for Cs are the trench and the stack capacitors. The
former is an adaptation of trench oxide isolation and is illustrated in its basic form
in Figure 6.9.
The polysilicon ﬁll-in is the storage node; the part of the substrate surrounding the
trench oxide is the capacitor plate. There are various structures for such capacitors.
The large sidewall area determines the capacitance and makes little demand on the

silicon estate. The major trench capacitor designs and their evolutions are shown in
Figure 6.10.
The fabrication process steps for the 1-T DRAM 32 nm MOS transistor device are
reported by Wang et al. [21] and are speciﬁed as the following:
– Shallow trench isolation (STI) formation on silicon substrate (etching and thermal
oxidation with initial deposition in two dimensions)
– Cylindrical trench formation followed by an oxide liner and a polysilicon ﬁll
– Implantations for threshold-voltage adjustment
– Gate oxide and polysilicon gate formation
– Halo implantation followed by low doped drain (LDD) implantation
– Sidewall spacer formation
– Highly doped drain (HDD) implantation
– Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 1000○C
– Contact formation
On the other hand, the stack capacitor, whose structure is shown in Figure 6.11, be-
neﬁts from the well-established technology of interconnects above the gate oxide.
The plates are separated by thin oxide and can rest on the various interconnect
layers. Trench and stack capacitors achieve similar capacitances for the same sil-
icon area. The trench capacitance is readily increased by deepening the depth of
the trench. For fabrication of this kind of structure, separate process steps are
required, resulting in increased cost. The limitations of the trench capacitor are leak-
age current between trenches. These interfere with the stored charges residing in
the substrate. This phenomenon becomes more serious for deep submicron device
structures.

6.6 Refresh Operation of DRAM
Memory units must be able to hold data so long as the power is applied to maintain
the data integrity. To overcome the charge leakage problem, DRAM employs a refresh
operation in every cycle where the data is periodically read from every cell, ampliﬁed
and rewritten as shown in Figure 6.12. Refresh circuitry is included in the overhead
logic that surrounds the cell array. The refresh cycle is designed to operate in the back-
ground and is transparent to the user. As mentioned earlier, the sense ampliﬁer has
dual roles: (1) it is responsible to send out the data to the output buffer for chosen
memory cells in read operation and (2) it is also responsible to rewrite the data known
for refreshing the memory cell. The burst or distributed refresh methods can be em-
ployed to accomplish this task as shown in Figure 6.13. A series of refresh clock cycles
are passed in a burst technique until the completion of the accession of all rows, unlike
a distributed refresh where periodic cycles are applied.

6.7 DRAM Types
DRAMs have branched into many categories in order to meet the power and speed
discrepancies. Figure 6.14 shows the current DRAM varieties.
6.7.1 FPM DRAMs
The addresses of a DRAM are multiplexed. A row address is supplied and then a
column address is supplied in order to access a DRAM data. If the data demand is
present in the same row address as the earlier applied row address, then simply chan-
ging the column address will permit the access to the recent data. In summary, with
ﬁrst page mode (FPM) DRAMs, the data stored on the same row can be accessed by
changing the column address in order to achieve a faster access time. All standard
DRAMs use this mode.

6.7.2 Extended Data Out DRAMs
The design of the output buffer of the FPM DRAMs is changed in extended data out
(EDO) technique to further reduce the access time by extending the valid data output
time. In this technique, the accession of the new data and latching of old data are
taking place simultaneously.
6.7.3 Burst EDO DRAMs
In this technique, a burst of n numbers of sequenced read and write cycles are applied
to the memory chip. A design change in the output latch is provided to accomplish the
“burst”. A counter having m bit, where m = log2(n) counting capability with a pipeline
stage, is provided. It offers higher bandwidth as higher latency is obtained from the
special pipeline stages. Moreover, burst EDO DRAM has the provision for an internal
address counter. It requires the supply of only initial address in a burst of n number to
complete the process.
6.7.4 ARAM
Due to fabrication process variability, some DRAMs are manufactured with some
failed storage cells and are not passing through the testing phase. They are not good
enough to be used as PC DRAMs. However, they are not thrown away but are used in
audio applications (such as telephone, etc.) with a cheaper price where tolerance for
error margin is less, known as Audio DRAM (ARAM).
6.7.5 Cache DRAM
In this technique, a DRAM and a six-transistor SRAM cache memory are integrated
together in the same chip. A buffer is used to complete the data transmission between
the SRAM and the DRAM. Usually it takes one complete clock cycle using the buffer
in order to ﬁnish the operation. Figure 6.15 shows the chip organization of a cache
DRAM.
6.7.6 Enhanced DRAM (EDRAM)
Enhanced DRAM (EDRAM) is a variant of cache DRAM, where read cycles take place
from the cache all the time. Every time the comparator senses a “hit”, it provides the
data within a short time. In contrast, on every occasion when a “miss” is sensed, the
whole cache is updated and the time taken to make the data available at the output is

higher. The major architectural difference between the cache DRAM and EDRAM is the
presence of a fast page mode DRAM instead of a separate SRAM. The sense ampliﬁers
located within the FPM DRAM act as a SRAM for reading and accessing data.
6.7.7 Synchronous DRAM
In synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) technology, the term synchronous refers to the syn-
chronization of read and write cycles harmonized with processor clock. The provision
of two separate banks offers each bank to have active rows simultaneously, leading
to a concurrent access/refresh and recharge operation. These DRAMs offer program-
mability through the use of a programmable mode register to include different burst
lengths, wrap sequence and CAS latency. In order to change the programmable
features, the mode registers need to be modiﬁed.
6.7.8 Double Data Read DRAMs
Double data read DRAMs (DDR DRAMs) offer twice effective bandwidth at a given
clock frequency by delivering the data for both the leading and falling edges of the
processor clock supplied.
6.7.9 Synchronous Graphic RAM
Synchronous graphic RAM (SGRAM) provides graphic-speciﬁc precise features, for
example, block write mode and masked write mode to target video applications.
6.7.10 Enhanced Synchronous DRAMs
Enhanced synchronous DRAM (ESDRAM) is a combination of SDRAM and cache
DRAM fabricated on the same chip.

6.7 DRAM Types
223
6.7.11 Video DRAMs
In video DRAM (VRAM) technology, to target video applications, which are inherently
serial, in contrast to inherent parallel nature of DRAMs, a parallel-to-serial shift re-
gister is provided. These DRAMs are also known as dual-port DRAMs because of the
provision for separate parallel and serial interface. VRAMs can be used as a DRAM or
as a serial access memory (SAM). The typical organization of VRAM is shown in Fig-
ure 6.16. The parallel-to-serial shift register is separated into two halves. One-half is
busy with reading the SAM, while the other half is responsible to load the data from
the memory array. Nevertheless, for a nonreal-time operations such as loading dur-
ing Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) retrace periods, VRAM is operated with a full register
operational mode.
6.7.12 Window DRAMs
Window DRAM (WRAM) is a dual-ported VRAM with additional features like EDO and
fast page mode access.
6.7.13 Pseudo-static RAMs
In pseudo-static RAM (PSRAM) technology, storage mechanism of DRAM technology
with additional circuitry makes it behave like a SRAM. However, it is worth mentioning
that the market of PSRAM has never grown strongly in spite of its presence for more
than two decades.
6.7.14 Rambus DRAMs
The DRAMs designed by Rambus Inc. provides very high speed chip-to-chip interface
due to a new DRAM architecture. In this architecture, an on-chip controller/processor
is incorporated with a Rambus channel to send out information at a towering rate.

Figure 6.17 shows the typical Rambus conﬁguration. Typical DRAM process and
manufacturing technology are followed in Rambus DRAMs (RDRAMs). They can
be divided into two parts: (a) DRAM core and (b) interface logic. The controller is
designed to act as the interface between the Rambus channel and the RDRAMs.
6.7.15 Multibank DRAM
In multibank DRAM (MDRAM) technology, the idea is to use multiple bank of DRAM
to reduce latency between the bursts. The next-generation DRAM is all multibank
DRAMs. In contrast to a conventional DRAM, in a MDRAM, full access is given to its
entire bank of memories, where each bank operates independently to offer a higher
degree of memory granularity compared to other DRAM architecture alternatives.
6.7.16 Ferroelectric DRAM
What makes ferroelectric DRAM (FRAM) different from previous DRAMs is the pres-
ence of ferroelectric material in the capacitor. A ceramic ﬁlm of PZT (made from lead
zirconium titanite) is used to construct the ﬁlm of the capacitor present in the DRAM
used to tender nonvolatility in order to retain data, when power is switched off. The
electrical schematic of a ferroelectric cell is shown in Figure 6.18.

One of the key challenges to achieve gigabit memories is the integration of very high
density storage capacitors characterized with a shorter access time. In order to achieve
this, several capacitor-less DRAMs have been proposed [22–25] in contrast to the con-
ventional DRAMs where a vertical trench capacitor with a transistor must be involved.
The ﬂoating body in SOI can be used as a storage capacitor [26] where the DRAM
consists of a single transistor and three signal lines as shown in Figure 6.19. In this
technique, the ﬂoating body is considered as the node in order to store the charge.
Usually, the charges present in the ﬂoating body are considered as troublemaker to
designers as it leads to shifting of thresholds introducing kink effect in the device char-
acteristics and hysteresis in the circuit operation. However, they can be considered as
an advantage since it can rule out the need of a separate storage capacitor, leading to
a very high density memory.
6.8.1 Operating Principle
6.8.1.1 Write
The operation required for write cycle is shown in Figure 6.20. By creating positive
charges using impact ionization method write “1” operation is accomplished after rais-
ing both word line (WL) and bit line (BL) to logic “1”. The positive charges created from
impact ionization method are trapped within the body when the WL is low. In contrast
in order to write “0”, a high voltage at gate and a low voltage at drain are applied to
remove holes from the body owing to the forward-biased body-to-drain p-n junction.
6.8.1.2 Read
The read operation is started by activating the WL ﬁrst. A small drain voltage is then
applied to keep the stored charges intact so that the transistor operates in linear re-
gime. As a result, the drain current appears through precharged BL on the sense
ampliﬁers. Now, sense ampliﬁers are activated to sense the current in comparison to a
reference current, and decision is made to output data.

6.8.2 Design Considerations of SOI DRAM
The charges stored in the SOI transistor’s body appear in the device characteristics
due to kink effects. This ﬂoating body effect is much more pronounced in partially
depleted (PD) SOI MOSFETs as compared to FD SOI MOSFETs. As the performance of
1-T SOI DRAM cell depends on the ability to store charges in its body, most DRAM cells
use PD SOI technology. However, Refs [22, 23] use FD SOI technology to realize ﬂoating
body DRAM cells use a negative voltage to the rear side (back gate) of the MOSFET to
accumulate charges on the back side of the wafer by creating a potential well to store
the holes injected into the body created by impact ionization method.
6.9 Introduction to SRAM
SRAM is used to store the data in a static fashion. The data remains stored as long as
power is available. SRAM ﬁnds its usage as embedded memory such as cache memor-
ies in the microprocessors or data buffers in various Digital Signal Processors (DSP)
chips.
The search for high speed, high density SRAMs is in demand in order to achieve
enhanced system performance of computing systems. SRAMs require more transistors
(usually 6) as compared to DRAMs. Hence, it is more expensive and requires more
space to fabricate. The signiﬁcant improvement in SRAM can be accomplished owing
to scaled device dimension aspects, by optimizing the cell layout [27] resulting in fast,
compact scalable SRAM.
Recently, SOI CMOS technology for SRAM and DRAM technologies has been used
for achieving substantial on-chip RAM in computing machines. It is consistent with
the trend of superseding of SOI technology over other technologies for emerging as
chief contender of future-generation CMOS technology. However, design issue in SOI
MOSFETs – ﬂoating body effects may upset the charge stored in a memory cell – needs
to addressed properly.

6.10 SRAM Cell and Its Operation
227
6.10 SRAM Cell and Its Operation
Conventional 6-transistor (6-T) SRAM cells are used in various electronic applications
in the industry as well as personal computing machines to store data. Since it is a
static memory, it does not require periodic refreshment of stored charges.
Figure 6.21 illustrates the schematic representation of a 6-T SRAM memory cell to
store one bit of information. Throughout the read and write operation, two nMOS ac-
cess transistors offer access to the SRAM cell. Two bit lines (BLA and BLB) are employed
to transfer the data during the read and write operations working in a differential man-
ner. In order to achieve a better noise margin, the data and its complement are applied
to BLA and BLB, respectively. The data is stored as two stable states, at storage nodes
VR and VL, denoted as “0” and “1”. SRAM works in mainly three modes:
(1)
Read operation cycle: In this cycle, the data stored in SRAM cell is read by pre-
charging both bit lines to logic “1” and then asserting a high on the WL to turn
on the access transistors. If the cell content is a logic “0”, the BLA will get dis-
charged through the right access transistor (AXR) and right pull-down transistor
(NR) to logic “0”, while BLB will remain precharged to transfer the voltages of the
storage nodes to the corresponding bit lines. In contrast, BLB will get discharged
and BLA will remain precharged, if the cell stores a logic “1”. To maintain the
read-ability the cell-drive transistors should be wider than the access transistors
in order to avoid the ﬂipping of data during read operation.
(2)
Write operation cycle: In this cycle, data (“0” or “1”) which is to be written is
applied to BLA and its complement is applied to BLB and then a logic high is as-
serted to WL. If the cell content is same as with the data to be written in it, then
no charging/discharging will take place. Otherwise if the cell contains a “0” then
discharge to “0” through AXR and simultaneous pull-up of VL to “1” through PL
will take place to write a “1”. To write a “0” together with the initial cell content of
“1”, discharge to “0” through AXL and simultaneous pull-up of VR to “1” through
PR will take place to write a “0”. For proper write operation, the input driver tran-
sistors should be stronger (wider) than the corresponding pull-up transistors so
that the data stored in the cross-coupled inverters could easily be overwritten.

Standby: In this mode, the cell remains in idle state. The word line remains off,
so the access transistor remains disconnected with bit lines, and hence cross-
coupled inverters continuously reinforce each other to hold the stored data.
6.11 SRAM Cell Failures
The various failure mechanisms for a SRAM can be grouped under four types:
(1)
Read Failure: The voltage at the node R increases and becomes greater than zero
(VR> 0), at some point in the read procedure cycle, as a result of the resistor di-
vider act among access transistor AXR and pull-down transistor NR. It causes the
pull-down transistor NL to turn on weakly. The node L discharges due to the sub-
threshold leakage through NL, which in turn results in increase of VR. As a result
of this cyclic positive feedback action, VR rises above the threshold position of
the inverter located at left side (PL–NL) and turns over (reverses) the information
stored of the cell [28].
(2)
Write Failure: Consider logic “0” is stored at node R and a new data that equals
to logic “1” has to be written next. Correspondingly, BLA and BLB are connected
to logic “1” and logic “0”, respectively. The node L would be discharged to lower
voltage (VL < 1) as a result of the resistor divider act among the pull-up transistor
PL and access transistor AXL. If it is not possible to reduce VL then the threshold
position of the inverter located at the right side (PR–NR) during the time VL is “1”,
and then a write failure occurs caused by the slow discharge of “1” due to the
weakness of the access transistors.
(3)
Access Time Failure: The time required to produce a voltage difference at the
bit lines, so that sense ampliﬁers can read the state of the cell, is known as the
access time. If discharging of bit lines is slow due to the weakness of pull-down
and access transistors, then the voltage difference on the bit lines will not be
sufﬁcient to produce a signiﬁcant voltage difference on the sense ampliﬁers to
make the proper decisions, causing an access time failure.
(4)
Hold Failure: In order to hold the data for a long time, the SRAM chip is placed
in standby mode aiming to reduce the leakage current by decreasing the power
supply. Nevertheless, the voltage level of the node storing logic “1” could possibly
get lowered than the threshold voltage level of the inverter located at the right
side (PR–NR) owing to large leakage of the pull-down nMOS transistor, causing
hold failure by ﬂipping of the cell state in standby mode.
6.12 Performance Metrics of SRAM
6.12.1 Static Noise Margin
It determines the stability of a SRAM cell in order to hold its data against the presence
of noise [29]. To calculate static noise margin (SNM) of a SRAM, the voltage transfer

characteristics (VTC) curves of two-cross-coupled inverter pairs present in the unit
SRAM cell are plotted ﬁrst. From that ﬁgure, a maximum square is drawn using the two
VTCs. Then, the length of that square determines the SNM. It is broadly classiﬁed into
two types: hold SNM and read SNM. Hold SNM is for an SRAM cell working in standby
mode (WL is disabled). However, read SNM is regarded as more crucial than hold SNM
due to the susceptibility of the SRAM cell although the read operation cycle when WL
is high. The reduction of SNM of the cell below the predeﬁned threshold SNM of the
cell causes the occurrence of a read failure. Other than the graphical method of ﬁnd-
ing the SNM by drawing the maximum possible square between the VTCs of inverter
characteristics, the approach given in [29] is quick and reliable. Figure 6.22 shows the
graphical representation of SNM in the two coordinate systems, which are rotated
by 45○. This method can be implemented in commercial SPICE systems to calculate
SNM.
6.12.2 Reliability Issues of 6-T SRAM
For the last few decades as a result of the development of microelectronics fab-
rication technology, the dimensions of MOS devices are shrinking. Therefore, reli-
ability becomes a serious concern, especially at nanoscale dimensions. One of the

6 Introduction to Memory Design
major rising reliability issues is the aging effects, causing degradation of the device
performance with time. NBTI (negative biased temperature instability) and PBTI (pos-
itive biased temperature instability) are the two most known aging effects that hinder
the future downscaling of devices. NBTI and PBTI result in the threshold voltage
degradation of pMOS and nMOS, respectively, owing to the presence of trapped
charges.
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that NBTI and PBTI are also dependent on tem-
perature and threshold voltage. It was observed that SRAM having low threshold
voltage working at high temperature suffers severe performance degradation. As a res-
ult of the degradation of the SRAM performance, number of faulty cells increases as
time progresses.
The researchers in industry and in academic institutes are continuously working
to provide effective solutions for these reliability problems. There are some solutions
such as replacement of SiO2 by high-k dielectrics presenting beneﬁts in terms of re-
duced gate-leakage current [30], providing relief to the reliability issues. However,
there are many other reliability issues that appear as an obstacle to future downscal-
ing of devices. NBTI results from interface-trapped charges from the broken Si-H bonds
at the interface [31] whereas PBTI results from oxide-trapped charges [32]. It is worth
mentioning that NBTI and PBTI are not dependent on supply voltage and temperature.
Instead, they depend on threshold voltage and other technological parameters of the
MOSFET. The different aspect of NBTI aging on SRAM reliability has been explored in
[33, 34] for different MOSFET technologies. The impact of aging (NBTI and PBTI) on
SRAM performance neglecting the variations in its threshold voltage and temperature
is also studied [35–37].
Other than these, process variability and temperature variability are also con-
sidered as crucial reliability concerns. Process variability mainly emerges from the
statistical variations in the length, width and doping of the channel, oxide thick-
ness, line-edge roughness and random dopant ﬂuctuations due to the imperfection
of manufacturing process. It results in variation in threshold voltage from chip to
chip (inter-die variation) and transistor to transistor (intra-die variation). As a res-
ult of this undesirable process variability, the transistors fabricated on the same
chip might not behave identically, resulting in an undesirable output. On the other
hand, the temperature might be different on different points within an IC or from
IC to IC, depending on the load and operating conditions resulting in temperature
variability.
6.13 Read-only Memory
A read-only memory (ROM) is essentially an AND plane of a Programmable Logic Array
(PLA). ROM cells use only one transistor per bit of storage. Storing binary informa-
tion at a particular address location can be achieved by the presence or absence of a

data path from the selected row (word line) to the selected column (bit line), which
is equivalent to the presence or absence of a device at that particular location. The
ROM memory contents are programmed by selectively placing transistors within the
memory array. Therefore, the contents of a ROM memory are ﬁxed as the part is man-
ufactured and cannot be changed at a later time. It produces an output of n “words”
or product terms each of m “variables” by an array of n × m nMOS switch matrices,
as shown in Figure 6.23. The m bit lines are precharged to logic high for the duration
of I1 and a word line is selected. During I2, the bit lines that have a ground path via
a transistor controlled by the selected word line will be discharged to 0 V, signifying
a 0 output. If a transistor is not present, a 1 output is produced. Read-only memor-
ies have been widely used to store microprograms, code conversion tables, tables of
mathematical functions and general combinational functions.
The structure of a CMOS ROM is shown in Figure 6.24. CMOS is usually chosen for
newer ROMs to reduce static power dissipation of the peripheral circuitry. It uses a pre-
charge principle as in nMOS, but a single phase clock is sufﬁcient (i.e. I1 is replaced
by I1, and I2 is replaced by I1, and the circuit will still work).
Since the pattern of transistors in the switch matrix determines the stored inform-
ation of the ROM, this pattern can be set during manufacture. Such a ROM is called a
mask-programmable ROM. There are also ﬁeld-programmable ROMs (PROMs), whose
switch matrix can be set by the user. There are also erasable and reprogrammable
ROMs (EPROMs), whose information can be erased by ultraviolet rays and repro-
grammed with new information. Another MOSFET programmable ROM structure is
shown in Figure 6.25 that contains data 0100,1111,1010,0001,1011,0111,1110,1001 in the
address location 0–7 consecutively.

6.14 EPROM
Many applications require semiconductor memory that is nonvolatile like ROM, yet
can be reprogrammed to correct unintentional errors in the contents of the memory
or to change program-based characteristics of a system. The memory should have the
nonvolatileness of ROM as well as the reprogram ability of RAM. As a solution to this,
the EPROM (erasable programmable ROM) was developed. An EPROM provides dense,
nonvolatile storage yet can be reprogrammed as necessary. The proﬁle of the MOSFET
for such a memory is developed by INTEL and was called FAMOS (ﬂoating gate ava-
lanche transistor) technology and is illustrated in Figure 6.26. The cell comprises of
two gates called ﬂoating (unconnected) gate and a control gate [38]. The oxide layer
located below the ﬂoating gate and the oxide layer present in between the two gates
possess identical thickness, which is equal to the thickness of the gate oxide (thin
oxide) in an ordinary MOSFET. The programming consists of the application of large
positive voltage (about 25 V) to control gate terminal and drain terminal followed by
the grounding of the source terminal. The high electric ﬁeld causes avalanche break-
down in the channel and produces an abundance of hot electrons, some of which have
sufﬁcient energy to penetrate the thin oxide and to be attracted to the ﬂoating gate by
its positive potential, surmounting the energy barrier located between the substrate
terminal and the gate tunneling oxide in order to do so [39]. The ﬂoating gate ac-
quires a negative charge which it retains on removal of the programming voltage with
the result that the transistor is nonconducting (due to charges present in the ﬂoating
gate, threshold voltage enhanced) even when the control gate is taken to VDD. If this
programming step is omitted, the transistor behaves like a standard MOSFET. This is
a one-transistor storage cell. The charge retention time is usually 10 years. The data
storage mechanism of a unit memory cell depends upon the presence/absence of the
charge in the ﬂoating gate terminal [40].

6 Introduction to Memory Design
Memory is erased by removing undesired charge from the ﬂoating gate in the follow-
ing manner. To wipe out the charges, the ﬂoating gate is exposed to intense light of
the proper wavelength for a period of time; enough energy is imparted to the stored
charge to remove it from the ﬂoating gate. A quartz window is incorporated into
the memory chip package for light entry; thus, all memory cells are exposed and
erased simultaneously. EPROMs normally present erase times in the range of 20 to
30 minutes.
6.15 Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory
(E2PROM)
UV erasure is slow and the next move in ﬁeld programming therefore is the E2PROM, in
which both the programming and erasure are electrical. The basic memory cell for an
E2PROM comprises of a memory transistor and transistor for selection, as depicted in
Figure 6.27. The vital difference between the structure of the FAMOS and the E2PROM
transistors is the extension of the ﬂoating gate over the drain with a protrusion which
gives a ultrathin tunnel oxide region of 5–10 nm The ﬂoating gate is charged and
discharged by Fowler –Nordheim (FN) tunneling [41] of cold electrons between the
drain and the gate. These electrons, unlike FAMOS, tunnel through the oxide, which
provided is thin enough, without surmounting the 3.2 eV barrier overcome by hot
electrons.
After the assertion of a positive voltage at the control gate and grounding the
drain the transistor is programmed. FN tunneling now invites electrons to the ﬂoat-
ing gate, putting the transistor in high (“1”) state with high threshold voltage or in
normal off state. The control gate is grounded and drain is connected to a high pos-
itive voltage to erase the transistor. Electrons tunnel from the ﬂoating gate terminal

to the drain terminal, leaving transistor in ‘0’ state with low threshold voltage or in
normal on condition. The control gate serves only for programming and erasure; it
has no function for readout.
The placement of EPROM and E2PROM cells within an array is shown in Fig-
ure 6.28. The critical step in the fabrication of E2PROM transistor cell is the formation
of the high quality tunnel oxide having an oxide thickness in the range of 5 to 10 nm.
The memory cell (transistor) can have two threshold voltages (two states) cor-
responding to the existence of charges (electrons) at the ﬂoating gate as shown in
Figure 6.29. When electrons are accumulated at the ﬂoating gate, the threshold voltage
of the memory cell raises, and as a result the memory cell is considered to be in a
“1” state as a convention. This is because the memory cell is not turned on with the
application of the read signal voltage (e.g. 5 V) to the control gate, and the bit line
precharge level (e.g. VDD) is maintained. It is possible to lower the threshold voltage of

the memory cell by taking away the electrons from the ﬂoating gate, resulting for the
memory cell to be considered as to be in a “0” state. In this case, with the application
of voltage, the cell transistor turns on with the simultaneous discharge of the bit line to
the ground. Floating gate cells can be arranged in mainly two architectures: NOR and
NAND. The NOR structure utilizes channel hot-electron (CHE) injection mechanism
[42] for write and Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanism for erase. The NAND
structures utilize Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanisms for both write and
erase operations. The reading speed accession is lower for NAND-based structures
due to their higher resistance of series connection. In contrast, lower program speed is
offered by NOR-based structures as each cell must be written individually or in bytes
due to high current involved in CHE process. As a result, writing a page or a block of
data requires large time (in the range of ms). The cell size is larger for NOR-based struc-
ture as each NOR cell has its own connection to bit lines (requires larger metal-layer
contacts and hence larger die area).
6.16 Flash Memory
It is formed by an array of several ﬂoating gate transistors. It has two gates: one is
known as control gate (CG) like ordinary MOSFETs, and the other one is a ﬂoating gate
surrounded by insulating oxide layer. An electrically isolated ﬂoating gate differen-
tiated ﬂoating gate MOSFETs and normal MOSFETs. Quantum mechanical tunneling
principle is used to transfer charges from the ﬂoating gate to the substrate through a
thin insulating tunneling barrier. As the ﬂoating gate is isolated owing to the insulat-
ing oxide coating, every charge placed on it is trapped and thus stores the information.
The two-transistor E2PROM cell is complemented by the single transistor cell for the
ﬂash E2PROM as shown in Figure 6.30. The split gate has a dual role. It functions like a
conventional gate over the channel region and controls the erasure of the ﬂoating gate.
The cell behaves like two transistors. Hot-electron injection is used for programming

and cold-electron tunneling for erase is employed in this memory to operate. The re-
duction from two transistors to one transistor per bit increases the storage capability
of ﬂash E2PROMs. The absence of a control gate makes this cell only suitable for ﬂash
erasure of the entire memory of large blocks thereof. Ten years’ data retention time
can be obtained if a tunneling oxide thickness larger than 8 nm is employed in the
chip [43].
Programming has been simpliﬁed by on-chip generation of the programming
voltage. Instead of requiring an external connection to a high positive voltage around
25 V, a circuit called a charge pump is provided to produce the essential programming
voltage from the standard 5 V supply. It is worth mentioning that even though the ﬂash
memory has turned out to be the choice of the majority of current nonvolatile memory,
it does exhibit some weaknesses: (1) slow operating speed as compared with volatile
memory and (2) the duration of typical programming timings in ,s and erase times
in ms.
Currently ﬂash memory is in demand for the reasons given subsequently:
(1)
It can offer the highest chip density. In contrast to ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM)
comprising of one transistor and one capacitor, MRAM has the need of one tran-
sistor and a magnetic tunnel junction [44]. Flash memory requires only one
transistor.
(2)
It can achieve the multi-bit per cell storage property [40]. Multi-bit storage ca-
pacity can be achieved with four dissimilar threshold voltage (VTh) conditions
attained in a ﬂash memory cell by controlling the amount of charge stored in
its ﬂoating gate. Two-bits/cell (with four VTh states) ﬂash memory cells have
already been commercialized. SONOS ﬂash memory offers multilayer integration
for increased memory density [45].
(3)
The fabrication process is compatible with regular commercial CMOS fabrication
process steps and hence can provide suitable solution for embedded memory
applications.
The main disadvantages related to conventional ﬂoating gate ﬂash memory are the
following:
(1)
Program/erase speed is lengthy.
(2)
It necessitates a high voltage to program/erase the stored data; operating voltage
needs to be reduced below 1 V.
(3)
Endurance is less (105 program/erase cycle).
(4)
Scaling of ﬂash memory technology is lagging after the CMOS logic device scaling
technology due to the suffering from excessive SCEs and high leakage current
resulting in higher power consumption.
(5)
High voltage transistor located on the peripherals of the ﬂash memory chip
occupies a large area and thus hinders further downscaling.
In summary sending a short (several ms), high voltage pulse to the row line while
grounding the drain causes hot-electron injection under high electric ﬁeld from the

the row line grounded causes tunneling of electrons from the ﬂoating gate terminal to
the drain terminal (erase), as shown in Fig. 6.31.
In brief, EPROM is programmed electrically, but it is possible to erase the data
stored in it by exposing it to UV light. On the other hand, both the data stored in
E2PROM and ﬂash can be wiped out electrically without being removed from the sys-
tem. Flash is erased in bulk, so ﬂash has become the most economical non-volatile
storage. For example, ﬂash cards are widely used in digital camera, mobile phone, etc.
6.17 Summary
The semiconductor memories exhibited an explosive growth of the ﬂash memory
market and its dominant position in market, motivated by the popularity of cellular
phones and other of electronic gadgets such as tablet, PC, digital camera, MP3 player
and so on.
Kahng and Sze in 1967 at Bell Labs [46] gave the picture of the ﬁrst model for ﬂash
memory. Later Wegener et al. in 1967 used Si3N4 to trap charges [47]. In 1990s, polysil-
icon was used to trap charges. In 1995, Tiwari et al. examined the property of the gate
having Si nano-crystals embedded on it and opened up a new horizon for research in
this topic [48]. One of the extensions to the ﬂoating gate and charge-trapping techno-
logies engrosses the use of nano-crystalline ﬂoating gates. Due to the discontinuous
nature of the charge storage layer, the material is impervious to isolated defect paths
in the primary tunnel oxide. Therefore, the tunnel oxide below the nano-crystal area
could be scaled down and thus it is possible to reduce the operating voltage. In 2003,

ﬁrst 4 MB memory using Si nano-crystal technology using 90 nm technology was pro-
duced. Later, 24 MB memory array was produced by FreescaleTM based on silicon
nano-crystals exhibiting excellent uniformity. Meanwhile, as the device dimensions
reduce below 90 nm, it has become cumbersome to embed ﬂoating gate-based ﬂash
memories in a cost-effective way. The chip requires a high voltage (9–12 V) to write
and erase the conventional ﬂoating gate memories. As a result of this high voltage,
reliability issues such as memory failure and loss of data have become another major
concern. Thus, nano-crystal memories are advanced class of next-generation memory
technology. They are scalable; i.e. it is possible to scale the tunneling oxide thickness
without having a serious impact on the data retention. The ultimate aim to scale nano-
crystal-based memories is to use a single electron to represent a bit known as single
electron transistor (SET) [49].

7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
7.1 Analog Low Power Design: Problems with Transistor Mismatch
The quest for high speed, low power and accurate design of analog integrated circuit
(IC) design has always been supported by never-ending dimension scaling of the tran-
sistors for the last few decades. It is well known that accuracy of high speed, low power
circuits depends on the amount of matching between the transistors. For example, in a
classical A/D or D/A converter, bit accuracy varies which depends on transistor match-
ing performance. Hence, in this section, impact of mismatch in analog IC design will
be discussed.
To model mismatch between two closely spaced identical transistors, random
variation of the difference in their threshold voltage VTh and current factor " is con-
sidered, with zero substrate bias. Considering a popular and widely accepted model
with normal distribution, zero mean with variance depending upon channel length L
and width W is given by [1]

The above equation is plotted as a function of input current in Figure 7.1 for overdrive
voltage 200 mV and 500 mV.
Figure 7.1 indicates that if high accuracy together with high speed (minimal length
of transistor) is critical, then large current values resulting in a high power drain is
necessary. For example, for achieving 1% current mismatch with 1 ,m gate length, a
biasing current of 500 ,A is required.
It is clear that in order to obtain higher accuracy, larger chip area (proportional
to W.L) is required. However, it will increase the capacitive loading at each node,
which affects the speed. Therefore, it may be concluded that analog circuit design is
a complex task involving multiple trade-offs between speed, power consumption and
accuracy with several degrees of freedom like drain current and transistor dimensions.
In deep-submicron technologies with sub-100 nm MOSFETs, the situation is getting
more complex in presence of short channel effects (SCEs).

7.2 Mixed-signal Design with Sub-100 nm Technology
A true system-on-chip (SoC) integration requires the inclusion of digital logic along
with mixed-signal (MS) processing that allows the IC to connect with the outside
world. In the world of communication for cost reduction, an SoC contains high fre-
quency Radio Frequency (RF) blocks, processing based on digital logic and high
performance analog blocks [3, 4]. Other than cost savings, SoC offers some added
advantages like reduced jitter and phase noise due to on-chip processing, and great
power savings can be achieved due to the removal of differential signaling (Low-
Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS), an interconnect standard) interfaces for high
performance ADCs, to name a few. However, the SoC design still relies on the metic-
ulous execution of time-consuming custom-design process. The popular digital logic
design techniques like design reuse, logic synthesis and soft macros are still not avail-
able in the design of MS modules. Until now, design of MS module is done by dropping
of hard macros into the SoC. In future, to deal with the power and reliability issues,
scaling of supply voltage is mandatory for tomorrow’s downscaled devices with re-
duced feature size, which is sufﬁcient to make the life of an analog MS designer
gradually more difﬁcult. It is worth mentioning that the reduction of power supply
voltage with feature size is expected to saturate due to the likely death of Moore’s
prediction in near future. However, in sub-100 nm space, the design of MS module
is further complicated by the issue of process variability. As a result, due to the deﬁ-
ciency of a standard design methodology, the increasing intricacies associated with
MS design unavoidably make the nonrecurring engineering cost to go sky-high, thus

244
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
making the design impractical. This is the reason why some researchers suggested dis-
carding the SoC concept for integration of analog and RF modules by using advanced
packaging techniques to throwing out some of the advantages obtained from SoC [5].
On the other hand, there are people who believe that by investigating in different ways
MS design will go hand in hand with continuously scaled digital world [6].
7.3 Challenges in MS Design in Sub-100 nm Space
In this section, the challenges and difﬁculties in sub-100 nm MS design are presented.
7.3.1 Lack of Convergence of Technology
The main motto of technology scaling is to make ICs cheaper, faster and smaller. In a
similar manner, cost reduction is considered as the predominant motivation behind
SoC development to integrate total solutions within a single chip [7]. Additionally,
along with reduced cost, SoC also offers better performance and reduction in power.
This plan does not hold well in the current scaling scenario. To understand
this in a better way, let us introduce the concept of optimal technology. To charac-
terize a technology, a set of parameters like minimum device feature size (channel
length), threshold voltage, supply voltage and the reliability-related voltage limits is
considered. The technology that is perfectly suitable for one component (like SRAM,
DRAM, analog, digital, RF, etc.) is considered as optimal technology. For an SoC, the
optimal technology must go well with all the different units that are integrated within
the chip. Normally, the technology that best ﬁts the majority component is chosen.
There is no price to be paid if the technology has enough headroom. For example, in
the past, when the supply voltage is adequately high, the technology that is used to
realize nearly all analog functions is also utilized to implement digital and memory
functions on the same die by paying almost zero or little price.
In recent years, it has been a common practice to consider power (energy) as im-
portant as the overall performance of the product. Therefore, power is considered as
the most inﬂuential factor to determine the downscaled process parameters [8]. Be-
cause of this, downscaling may not offer signiﬁcant improvements in performance
(normally in terms of speed) and/or power. One more crucial property of this type
of scaling is that the optimal technologies are diverging for different components of
the chip.
To exemplify this point, consider optimal supply voltage, one of the most
pertinent characteristics of scaling. As per constant ﬁeld scaling [9], the supply
voltage is to be scaled in proportion to the minimum device feature size. In gen-
eral, this was followed in the past, especially when supply voltage was adequately
high (Figure 7.2). However, for sub-100 nm technologies, International Technology
Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) [10] envisaged a deceleration in the supply

voltage scaling. This slowdown can be primarily ascribed to the lack of ability of
scaling of threshold voltage.
According to the ITRS, approximately 1 V supply is to be used by 45 nm technology
node devices. For a 1 V supply, it becomes extremely difﬁcult for the analog designers
to design analog circuits with high dynamic range. For low power digital operations
with supply voltage less than 1 V, analog functionality will be seriously affected.
Therefore, it is possible to conclude that while supply voltage scaling is proﬁtable for
digital voltage scaling, it becomes ineffective for analog component design.
Recent ITRS prediction is also reﬂecting this divergence in scaling, where differ-
ent scaling methodologies have been prescribed for almost every type of application
(Figure 7.3). Even the digital scaling domain has been divided into several types like
high performance (HP), low operating power (LOP) and low standby power (LSTP).
Moreover, in the MS scaling realm, several options like high bandwidth, high resolu-
tion, RF and MEMS categories have been identiﬁed. This divergence in technology has
serious ramiﬁcations in the SoC design due to the requirement of extra processing
steps with the requirement of complex technologies, which ultimately undermines
the cost-effectiveness of SoC as compared to the system-in-package (SiP) methodolo-
gies. For example, as the higher operating voltage is an essential requirement for I/O
blocks, they require thicker oxide thickness as compared to digital logic transistors
with thinner oxide thickness, thus necessitating extra processing steps.
7.3.2 Digital Scaling
Digital logic corresponds to the majority of the total integration within an SoC. Most
digital logic transistor uses minimum channel length and the latest technology node

available. Blocks identiﬁed as high activity and high performance are preferred to be
designed with low supply and low threshold transistors. Whereas, blocks identiﬁed as
low activity and low performance (applications in mobile phone) are preferred to be
designed with high threshold transistors. Therefore, it may be concluded that there ex-
ists an optimal supply and threshold voltage for each of the digital logic applications,
depending upon their activities.
7.3.3 Memory Scaling
Memory is an integral part of an SoC. It is of paramount interest to have high band-
width and low latency on-chip memory within an SoC. However, its scaling provides
a suite of challenges, which is dissimilar to digital scaling. Unlike conventional CMOS
process, DRAM requires use of processes like multiple polysilicon layers and formation
of deep trenches to fulﬁll its requirement of large storage capacitors. This exempliﬁes
the technology divergence from mainstream CMOS process and DRAM fabrication.
Therefore, to embed DRAM within an SoC, extra processing steps are mandatory.
It is worth mentioning that considering the cost-effectiveness, embedding DRAM
within an SoC has occasionally been made, whereas SiP or board-level integration
approaches have been given preference.
On the other hand, SRAM constitutes a large amount of SoC area. Future memory
scaling is being hindered mainly by the challenges like leakage, extra processing steps
[11] and process variations. Moreover, reduction in supply voltage used to address the
power consumption [12] affects the cell stability measured by static noise margin [13].

7.3.4 Analog Scaling
In contrast to debatable existence of optimal technologies in scaling of digital blocks,
there exist few optimal technologies in less standardized scaling of analog blocks.
One of them is unity-gate frequency also known as cut-off frequency fT of devices
(Figure 7.4). With scaling, fT increases but is degrading all other things related to
analog circuit design [14].
Therefore, a high speed analog block can make use of the high fT if it is possible
to manage the other difﬁculties that may come along. In contrast, scaling of supply
voltage with minimum channel-length device is not always going to provide improve-
ment in analog design. For example, a high dynamic-range Nyquist converter requires
higher supply voltage.
7.3.5 Degraded SNR
Reduction in supply voltage causes reduction in available voltage excursions, res-
ulting in degradation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, due to scaling the
transistor noise increases gradually. The thermal noise component of the drain current
and ﬂicker noise (1/f) component appearing in the 2nd term of (1) exhibits signiﬁcant
increase in short channel device [15].

Moreover, parameter # also exhibits a steady increase with channel-length scal-
ing. In order to increase the SNR in the sampled-data circuits suffering with kT/C

248
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
noise component, capacitor size needs to be increased, resulting in increased power
consumption [16].
7.3.6 Degradation in Intrinsic Gain
The intrinsic gain (gmRO) of a device is considered as the product of gm and RO, where
gm is the transconductance and RO denoted the output resistance. The intrinsic gain
decreases with scaling due to the increased drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) res-
ulting from reduced gate-electrostatic control, increased channel-length modulation
(CLM) and impact ionization dominated hot-carrier effects (HCEs). This degradation
causes serious limitations in designing analog circuits [17]. For example, if intrinsic
gain is small, then the requirement of precise charge manipulation by sampled-voltage
circuits like high precision data converters cannot be fulﬁlled. This is the reason why
a constant gmRO has been predicted by ITRS for future generation MS components
design.
7.3.7 Device Leakage
One of the most striking features of MOSFET technology is that it offers good switches
to provide precise manipulation/control over the stored charges. However, with scal-
ing, due to the increase in the gate and drain leakage current components, it is hard
to maintain the ﬁdelity of the charges stored in the node connected to the leaky
transistor [18].
7.3.8 Mismatch due to Reduced Matching
For low precision application, size reduction is possible as the matching between two
close transistors is proportional to device area, and it increases with reduction in oxide
thickness [19] as shown in Figure 7.5. More on this topic is discussed in Section 7.1 of
this chapter.
7.3.9 Availability of Models
Analog design requires a stable and mature device models. However, due to un-
availability of mature models in deep submicron devices, the analog circuit designer
experiences additional challenges.
7.3.10 Passives
Scaling technology, largely aiming at digital technologies, shows deﬁciency in high-Q,
high density linear capacitors as required in sampled-data circuits. The gate and

diffusion capacitances cannot be used because of their linearity and parasitic resist-
ances. Hence double poly or metal-insulator-metal (MiM) capacitor ﬁnds their usage
with a higher cost.
7.3.11 RF Scaling
CMOS has been the technology of choice for the mainstream digital logic and memory
ICs over the years. On the other hand, RF and analog IC technologies depend on
many different materials and device structures to provide the optimal solutions. In
the past, RF and analog ICs have been mainly developed using the bipolar and the
compound semiconductor technologies due to their better performance. In the recent
years, the advancement made in CMOS technology allowed the analog and the RF cir-
cuits to be built with the same digital CMOS technology for the analog and RF circuits
applications leading to the following threefold advantages:
(a)
Performance improvement
(b)
Cost advantage
(c)
Ease of integration
The deep submicron MOSFETs scaled for digital operations are also capable of op-
erating in the GHz regime because of their very high unit-gain frequencies in the
range of GHz and increase in NFMin [20]. Therefore, in addition to the high levels
of integration for digital circuit design offered by the advanced CMOS processes,
new opportunities for the RF circuit applications and new markets in the microwave
and millimeter wave region have been created as the high frequency capabilities
of the MOSFETs have reached well into the GHz range [21]. There is a signiﬁcant
difference in approach between the microwave designer and RF IC designer. A mi-
crowave designer would have concentrated more on metrics like GMax, stability, power
gain, circular plots in s-domain in order to ﬁnd the optimal transistor size, bias and

250
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
impedance matching network. However, in contrast, an analog Radio Frequency In-
tegrated Circuits (RFIC) designer concentrates more on voltage gain [22], without
studying impedance matching.
Previously GaAs was used mainly for microwave devices (s-parameter com-
munity) and Si was used for analog IC design (gmRO centric community). However,
today with scaling and advancement in fabrication process of III-V-based semicon-
ductors, this type of community division has been come under dispute [23].
7.3.12 Issues Related with Power Devices
Power devices require voltages around 3.6 to 5 V and therefore are not compatible
with deep submicron mainstream CMOS. Furthermore, large capacitor or inductor is
often required. To incorporate these power devices, SiP approach clearly gives more
advantage than SoC approach.
7.4 Basics of Switched-capacitor Circuits
This section of the book introduces switched-capacitor (SC) circuits. To start with,
the resistor emulation using SC has been introduced initially. Later, ﬁlter using SC is
shown. The basic components of an SC circuits is MOS switches and MOS capacitors.
A typical MOS switch can provide high off resistance and low on resistance and thus is
almost ideal to be used in SC circuits. A typical MOS switch can provide off resistance
in the range of GK and on resistance in the range of KK, depending upon their sizes.
If one increases the width of the MOSFET, then both these resistances will decrease.
However, it is worth mentioning that increasing the size of the MOS transistor also
increases the nonlinear voltage and size-dependent parasitic capacitances associated
with the MOS switch as shown in Figure 7.6 which may inﬂuence the transfer function
of the ﬁlter designed with SC circuits. In an SC circuit, the switch can be implemented
by an nMOS, pMOS or a parallel combination of both. A parallel combination of nMOS
and pMOS not only decreases the resistance but also improves the linearity.

Figure 7.7: (a) Nonoverlapping clock signals (b) simple nonoverlapping clock signal generator.
The switches present in the SC circuit require at least two nonoverlapping clock sig-
nals as shown in Figure 7.7 in order to transfer the charge as described below. It
is essential to ensure that the two clocks must not overlap at any instant so that
two switches should not be closed at the same time. Otherwise, charges may be
accidentally lost leading to a failure in SC circuit operation.
7.4.1 Resistor Emulation Using SC Network
The purpose of a resistor (R) is to transfer charge from one end (VIn) to the other end
(VOut). The average current that passes through the resistance is given by
iRms = VIn–VOut
R
.
(7.4)
Let us consider a simple parallel SC network with two nonoverlapping clocks applied
as shown in Figure 7.8.
During the 0 ≤t ≤T/2 when I1 is high and I2 is low, the switch located at the left
closes and the switch located at the right is open; thus capacitor C charges due to the
current ﬂowing from the input given by
iRms = 1

During T/2≤t ≤T when I1 is low and I2 is high, the switch located at the right
closes and the switch located at the left opens. Thus capacitor C discharges due to the
current ﬂowing from the capacitor to the output. Thus in one clock cycle T, overall
charge transfer takes place, and the average current is given by
iRms = (VIn – VOut) C

(7.9)
The advantages of this type of equivalent resistance in IC design are as follows:
(a)
It is possible to fabricate high value resistors consuming very little silicon area.
For example, a 1-MK resistor can be realized with a 10-pF capacitor switched at a
clock rate of 100 kHz.
(b)
Very accurate time constants can be realized because the time constant is pro-
portional to the ratio of capacitances and inversely proportional to the clock
frequency.
Table 7.2 shows some examples of SC network with their equivalent resistances and
the capacitor charges in each phase [24].

Now, the integrator does not require resistance to consume excessive silicon die area.
Moreover, the –3dB frequency now depends on the ratio of capacitances, not on the
RC product. Furthermore, the tolerance of a ratio is easier to control than the product
of two tolerances. However, several constraints are to be maintained during the design
of an SC ﬁlters:
(a)
Since an SC circuit is a sampled-data system, the clock frequency must be much
higher than the critical frequency set by the RC products in the circuit.

7.4 Basics of Switched-capacitor Circuits

(b)
SC equivalent cannot be used to close the negative feedback path in an OP-AMP
all by itself. It is due to the fact that in order to ensure stability, the negative
feedback path must be closed continuously. However, SC equivalents are sample
data construction equivalence of resistor, not continuous.
(c)
The bottom plate of the MOS capacitor needs to be grounded or connected to a
voltage source. The top and bottom plate of an MOS capacitor is associated with
nonlinear voltage-dependent parasitic capacitances with 5% and 20% of the ca-
pacitance value [25]. Therefore, to ensure that these nonlinear capacitances do
not affect the overall response of the system, they are connected to the AC signal
ground.

It is observed that H(z) depends on parasitic capacitance Cp1.
To overcome this limitations, i.e. in order to design an SC integrator insensitive
to parasitic capacitances, Martin et al. [27] developed a new structure as shown in
Figure 7.12. The effects of stray capacitance have been reduced greatly by dual-switch
conﬁgurations.
7.4.4 Low Power Switched-capacitor Circuit
The continuous downscaling of MOS transistors has introduced nanoscale (sub-100
nm) CMOS technologies. Consequently, the power supply voltage is also scaled down.
However, threshold voltage of MOS transistor is almost maintained at a constant
value. Due to this low supply voltage, the implementation of some well-known analog
design techniques like SC becomes problematic. In a typical GB modulator designed

with SC circuits, the switch driving problem becomes a major limitation with down-
scaled low power supply voltage. The low supply voltage does not provide enough
overdrive to turn on the transistor to act as a switch anymore.
A classic SC circuit employs a complementary switch. For the input voltage ranges
from VSs (0 V) to VTn (threshold voltage of nMOS transistor), the nMOS transistor
conducts. On the other hand, for input voltage VTp (threshold voltage of pMOS tran-
sistor) to VDD, the pMOS transistor conducts. Figure 7.13 shows the simulated switch
conductance versus input voltage characteristics for two different supply voltages
(5 V and 1.5 V).
For very low value of supply voltage ( VDD < VTn+|VTp|), the complementary switch
behavior is lost. Figure 7.13(b) indicates that for VDD = 1.5 V, there is a range of input
signal for which capacitor cannot sample the signal. Thus, the advantage of rail-to-
rail operation of the SC circuit is lost. However, a small value of input signal can be
sampled, if it lies within the range where at least one switch is conducting, with the
other switch remaining off, and thus can be excluded. It indicates that a single tran-
sistor SC circuit with a reduced power supply voltage imposes severe restriction on the
input signal swing.
It is known that the RC time constant of SC circuit depends on the on resistance of
the switch together with the sampling capacitor. After the sampling of the input signal
by the sampling capacitor, the settling of the sampling process totally depends on this
RC time constant. The on resistance of an nMOS transistor is given by [28]

where VS is the applied signal. The above expression indicates that downscaling of
device increases the on resistance, and thus resulting in higher settling time. On
the other hand, upscaling results in lower settling time. However, it is important
to remember that clock feedthrough and charge injection impose a limit on the im-
provement caused by upscaling. Due to this parasitic effect, a trade-off between clock
feedthrough and high speed is needed to be managed for design of high speed SC
circuits. The problem becomes more severe with the decrease in the supply voltage.
Therefore, it may be concluded that low voltage SC circuits generally result in low
speed of operation.
To overcome this problem, severe techniques can be employed as listed below:
(a)
To use transistor with low threshold voltage: The problem with this technique is
that a transistor with low threshold voltage results in a shift in the intersection of
the subthreshold slope (Log (ID) axis with VGS) with the vertical axis that causes
an increase in the subthershold leakage current. It indicates a higher switch-off
leakage current. This increase in the leakage current affects the integrator ca-
pacitor to leak away the stored charge. This signal-dependent leakage produces
harmonic distortion.
(b)
Another technique, using voltage multiplier to produce higher supply voltage on
chip to generate clock signal, is also used [29, 30]. Other than the clock signals,
the rest of the circuits like the operational transconductance ampliﬁers (OTAs)
and digital circuitry are designed to be operated with low supply voltages. For ex-
ample, in Ref. [29], the OTA is operated with 1.8 V supply, whereas this voltage is
multiplied to generate 3.4 V to drive the switches. It has the advantage of reduced
power dissipation as the OTA is powered with low supply voltage. However, the
main disadvantage of this technique is the area and power consumed by the
voltage multiplier. Moreover, in nanoscale MOS transistors with extremely scaled
power supplies, it is difﬁcult to produce higher supply voltage.
(c)
Switched OP-AMP technique allows the design of true low voltage SC technique
as reported in Refs [31, 32]. With the requirement of extra active elements, they
beneﬁt from large signal overdrive with reduced power supply voltage.
7.5 Current Source/Sink
A current sink and current source are two terminal components whose current at any
instant of time is independent of the voltage across their terminals. The current of a

current sink or source ﬂows from the positive node, through the sink or source to the
negative node. A current sink typically has the negative node at VSs and the current
source has the positive node at VDD.
Figure 7.14 shows the MOS implementation of a current sink and the I-V Character-
istics is shown in Fig. 7.15. The gate is taken to whatever voltage is necessary to create
the desired value of current.
When a MOSFET is used as a linear amplifying device or switching device, it must
be biased properly. The biasing can be done using a constant current source/sink.
An nMOS can act as current sink, where negative node is connected to VSs. A pMOS
can act as a current source, where positive node is connected to VDD. The gate is
taken to whatever voltage is necessary to create the desired value of current. Typic-
ally, a voltage divider using MOS resistor is used to create the bias voltage of the gate
(Figure 7.15).
Non-saturation region of a MOSFET is not a good choice for current source
application.
MOSFET can act as a current source/sink in the saturation region, where the
output current is constant subjected to no CLM (+ = 0). However, due to ﬁnite CLM, res-
ulting in ﬁnite output resistance, the drain-to-source current increases with increase
in drain-to-source voltage. However, for a better current source/sink, the current must
be constant over a wide output voltage range. Therefore, in order to obtain a better
MOS current sink/source we need to increase the output resistance.

For proper working of the current sink, the condition is

Again, the gate is taken to a constant potential as is the source. With the deﬁnition
of VOut and IOut of the source as shown in Figure 7.16, the large-signal IOut vs. VOut
characteristics are shown in Figure 7.17. This current source only works for VOut ≤VGg–
|VTh|.
The advantage of the current sink and source of Figures 7.14 and 7.16 is their simpli-
city. However, there are two areas in which their performance may need to be improved
for certain applications. One improvement is to increase the small signal output res-
istance resulting in a more constant current over the range of VOut values. The second
is to reduce the value of VMin.
The small signal output resistance can be increased using the principle illustrated
in Figure 7.18.

7.5.1 Technique to Increase Output Resistance
The principle uses the common-gate conﬁguration to multiply the source resistance
r by the approximate voltage gain of the common-gate conﬁguration with an inﬁnite
load resistance.
The exact small signal output resistance rout can be calculated from the small

We see that the small signal output resistance of the current sink is increased by the
factor of gm1rDs1. This principle of increasing output resistance in order to obtain a
constant current over a wide range of VOut is known as cascode current sink technique.
In a similar manner higher output resistance can be obtained by using cascode current
source.
7.6 Low Power Current Mirror
The current mirror is used to generate a replica of a given reference current. Electrical
function wise, it is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). Figure 7.22 (iii) shows
an ideal current mirror. However, it is worth mentioning that in a real circuit, current
mirror cannot perform the task of a CCCS exactly.
7.6.1 Use of Current Mirrors in IC
The biasing technique of transistors with discrete components is different from that of
transistors fabricated within an IC. It is due to the fact that it is expensive to fabricate
precise resistors within ICs and they occupy a large area within an IC. However, this
is not a problem for discrete components circuits. Therefore, common techniques like
voltage divider bias and self-bias using resistor and DC voltage sources are employed
or biasing analog circuits with discrete components. In contrast, DC current sources
are usually used for biasing transistors within an IC. These current sources within an
IC are typically designed using MOSFETs. This current source biasing allows the de-
signer to take advantage of matched devices, which are manufactured simultaneously
with the same device parameters (parameters from chip to chip will vary). Now the
question is, how should a MOSFET be biased to be used as a stable current source? A
simple resistor divider can be used as shown in Figure 7.22 (i). Assuming MOSFET in
saturation, the current expression is
IOut = 1
2,nCOx
W
L (VGS – VTh)2 .
(7.20)
neglecting CLM and other second-order effects. In this case, VTh may vary from wafer
to wafer due to process variability. Also ,n and VTh can vary due to temperature vari-
ation. This temperature and process dependence exists even if the gate voltage is not
a function of supply voltage. Thus we must seek other method of biasing the MOSFET
current source. Biasing in the analog IC design is based on the use of constant current
sources. The design of current sources in analog circuits is based on “copying” cur-
rents from a reference. Typically, a complex circuit with external adjustment is used
to generate a stable reference current, IRef, which is copied to many current sources in
the system. The process is known a current steering.

Figure 7.22(i) shows the use of a reference to generate various currents. Let us con-
sider for a MOSFET, ID= f(VGS), where f(.) denotes the functionality or dependency of
ID over VGS. Now, VGS = f–1(ID). That is, if a transistor is biased at IRef, it produces
VGS= f–1(IRef). Thus, if this voltage is applied to the gate and source of a 2nd transistor,
then the resulting current will be IOut = f f–1(IRef) = IRef. In another point of view, two
identical MOSFETs having equal gate-to-source voltage operating in saturation region

carry equal currents. This structure using two transistors to copy current from one por-
tion of the circuit to other is known as simple current mirror. Current mirror ﬁnds wide
applicability in analog circuits. The main advantage of this topology is the independ-
ence of temperature and process variation. The ratio of IRef and IOut can be controlled
by their relative size and aspect ratio (W/L ratio); thus any value of current can be
obtained for the design analog ICs.
Moreover, the current to be copied is not measured ideally as it would be necessary
to show a short circuit. Instead, to measure the reference current, a diode-connected
MOS transistor is normally used. We can design a number of circuits which accomplish
the current mirror function. The ones mostly used (and studied below) are
– simple current mirror,
– Wilson current mirror and
– cascode current mirror.
7.6.2 Simple Current Mirror
The implementation of the current mirror shown in Figure 7.23 is the simplest form of
the required function: it is composed of two transistors, of which one, M1, is diode con-
nected. M1 receives the reference current IRef and measures it by developing at its gate
the voltage VGS1; this voltage biases the gate of M2. We assume that both transistors
operate in the saturation region; therefore, the currents are

which enable us to express the output current IOut as a function of IRef, VOut and VDS2.
To simplify algebraic calculations, we assume the term +VDS1 = 0.
Thus, VGS1 is directly derived from the former equation, and after substitution in
the latter, gives
IOut = IRef

(7.23)
Apart from the term (1 + +VOut) the output current is a replica of IRef multiplied by the
aspect ratios, W/L of the transistors M2 and M1. The term (1++VOut) takes into account
the ﬁnite output resistance of M2 that, for small signal, is rOut =
1
+IOut .
Unfortunately, the value of output resistance which can be achieved with the
technologies and medium value currents used is not large enough for a number of
applications. Assuming + = 1/30V–1, rOut is as low as 300kK for IOut = 100,A. Thus,

as we will study shortly, other solutions must be used when output resistance is a key
design issue. However, for low voltage applications the simple scheme in Figure 7.23
may be preferred because of its excellent output dynamic range: the output node (the
drain of M2) can swing down to the saturation voltage of M2, whose value, for common
designs, is as low as a few hundred mV. More complex solutions allow us to increase
the output impedance but we normally have to pay for this beneﬁt with a reduced dy-
namic range. Both the simple current mirror and the other schemes that we are going
to study may deviate from ideal behavior. This is due to
– imperfect geometrical matching,
– technological parameter mismatch and
– parasitic resistances.
Let us again consider eqs (7.21) and (7.22). We assumed equal values of technological
parameters and properly ratioed geometrical dimensions of transistors to obtain eq.
(7.24). This is not attained in a real circuit and certain mismatches in the geometrical
dimension and the technological parameters will always exist. Any mismatches will
produce an error in the generated current.
If all the parameters in eqs (7.21) and (7.22) are statistically independent we obtain

Hence, current incorrectness derives from the quadratic superposing of relative geo-
metrical and technological mismatches. Inaccuracy in geometrical dimensions comes
from photolithographic processes and etching. To limit these, the layout should take
into account undercut and boundary-dependent effects. The simple current mirror is
superior to all the other architecture studied here when the output dynamic range is
the key target. Errors due to mobility and oxide thickness mainly come from unavoid-
able technology gradients along the surface of the chip. We can reduce this effect by
using an inter-digitized or a common centroid structures which minimize the distance
between the transistors.

7.6.3 Wilson Current Mirror
The relatively low value of the output resistance of the simple current mirror can be
improved with the Wilson scheme shown in Figure 7.24. The gate-to-source voltages of
M1 and M2 are equal, therefore ensuring similar operation to the circuit in Figure 7.23.
However, as we shall see, the addition of M3 and the established local feedback allows
us to increase the output resistance. The small signal equivalent circuit of the stage is
shown in Figure 7.25.
Resistance RL represents the external load seen from the reference current con-
nection. Analysis of the circuit provides

ror earns a high output resistance only if the reference current comes from a high
impedance source for which small signal resistance must be higher or comparable
to rDs1.

Transconductances gm2 and gm3 have same order of magnitude because M2 and M3
are carrying the same current. Therefore, the output resistance of the circuit is ap-
proximately determined by the output resistance of M3 (rDs3) ampliﬁed by the factor
rT gm1. It is large if rT is large and, in turn, if RL is sufﬁciently large. This condition is
naturally met when the reference current comes from a current source. The circuit in
Figure 7.23 suffers from a shortcoming. The drain-to-source voltages of M1 and M2 are
systematically different, in fact
VDS1 = VGS3 + VDS2.
This, because of the CLM effect (or the ﬁnite small signal output conductance), reveals
a systematic mismatch between reference current and output current.
Approximately, the reference current is larger than the generated one by the
amount VGS3/rDs1, remembering that 1/rDs1 = +1ID1 the current difference becomes
+1ID1VGS3.
7.6.4 Cascode Current Mirror
By increasing the output resistance, CLM can be avoided. In the current mirror
circuit, VDS may not be always equal, leading to imperfection in mirror action. An
alternative way to increase the output resistance is to use a cascode conﬁguration
since it is known that a cascode ampliﬁer offers higher output resistance. High output
impedance arises from the fact that if the output node voltage is changed by BV, the
resulting change at the source of the cascode device is much less, which is known as
shielding property. In the circuit of simple current mirror shown in Figure 7.23, VDS2
may not be equal to VGS2 = VGS1 = VDS1, because of the circuitry fed by M2. Therefore,
in order to suppress CLM and to make VDS equal, a 3rd transistor is connected in
cascode to M2 as shown in Figure 7.26. The voltage VBias is chosen such that VA = VB.
This ensures IOut = IRef.

Figure 7.27: Cascode current mirror circuit.
The voltage VBias is given by
VBias = VGS3 + VB.
For proper mirroring action, VB = VA. Therefore, VBias = VGs3 +VA. Therefore, it is clear
that VBias can be obtained by adding VA to gate-to-source voltage of M3. Now consider
the circuit shown in Figure 7.27 showing a possible scheme. Now,
VX = VGS4 + VX.
As node X is connected to the gate of M3
VGS4 + VA = VGS3 + VB.
Therefore, if we can ensure VGS3 = VGS4 by choosing (W/L)3
(W/L)4 = (W/L)2
(W/L)1 then it yields VA =
VB, which causes proper current mirror action by providing IRef = IOut. It can be shown
that this result is valid even if M4 and M3 suffer from substrate-bias effects. Minimum
voltage at P to keep M2 and M3 in saturation is equal to VP = 2VOv = 2(VGS – VTh).
The output stage consists of two transistors (M2 –M3) in the cascode arrangement.
Their biases result from two other transistors (M1 – M4) which are diode connected.
Again, as for the previously studied current mirrors, the VGS voltages of M1 and M2 are
set equal.
Therefore, a replica of the current in M1 is generated by M2. The output resistance
increases because of the cascode arrangement which can be explained by examining

270
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
the small signal analysis. However, the increased output resistance obtained from
cascode conﬁguration is traded off by a reduction of the output dynamic range. It con-
sumes substantial voltage in the headroom. To ensure M3 in saturation, the minimum
allowable output voltage at node P is equal to
VP = VDS3 ≥VGS3 – VTh,
≥VX – VTh,
≥(VGS4 + VGS1) – VTh,
≥(VGS4 – VTh) + (VGS1 – VTh) + VTh,
≥2VOv + VTh.
i.e. it is equal to two overdrive voltage plus one threshold voltage. Thus, compared to
the circuit shown in Figure 7.26, this circuit shown in Figure 7.27 wastes one threshold
voltage in the headroom and reduces the output swing.
7.6.5 Low Voltage Current Mirror
A current mirror is considered as one of the fundamental building blocks of analog
IC designing and is used to copy the current through one MOSFET by controlling the
current in other MOSFET of the circuit, keeping the output current independent of
loading in the circuit. The main task of a current mirror is to perform current ampliﬁc-
ation and to provide biasing in analog IC. The efﬁciency of current mirror has a direct
impact on the analog IC performance as current mirror is used in a large number of
IC building blocks like OTA, current conveyors, CFOAs (current feedback operational
ampliﬁers), ﬁlters etc. [33].
The relevant performance parameters of a current mirror for use in typical analog
IC are [34] the following:
(1)
Linearity in current transfer
(2)
Power consumption
(3)
Minimum supply voltage
(4)
Input and output resistances
An ideal current mirror has zero input resistance and inﬁnite output resistance. How-
ever, in practice, practical CM exhibits nonzero input and ﬁnite output resistance.
The aim of the designer is to achieve smallest input resistance and largest output
resistance so that error (BI = IIn – IOut) in the current transfer equals to IIn(RIn/ROut).
In ideal situation, the output current is independent of the voltage at the output
node. In practice, however, the minimum voltage at the output, which ensures the
device is operating at the saturation region, is called the output compliance voltage.
In summary, the desirable characteristics of a current mirror are the following:
(1)
Current transfer ratio must be adjusted by (W/L) ratio, not by temperature

7.6 Low Power Current Mirror
271
(2)
High output impedance (large ROut and small COut) in order to ensure the
independency of output current of output voltage
(3)
Low input resistance
(4)
Low input and output compliance voltage ensuring a higher voltage swing
Conventional current mirrors suffer with high input impedance and low output
impedance. This drawback has been studied by many researchers [35].
It was observed that the insertion of a voltage ampliﬁer between the drain and the
gate of the input transistor causes a lowering of input impedance of the current mir-
ror. Several possible implementation of the voltage ampliﬁer has also been reported.
However, the major drawback associated with this conﬁguration is the poor stability.
An improvement of performance can be obtained by replacing the voltage ampliﬁer
with differential ampliﬁer [36].
However, differential ampliﬁer suffers with the drawbacks of higher supply
voltage and associated higher power consumption. Later, it was claimed that the intro-
duction of an active input-regulated cascode (AIRC) in the differential ampliﬁer in the
input and output side of the current mirror causes a decrease in the input resistance
and an increase in the output resistance [37].
On the other hand, the current mirrors using ﬂipped voltage follower (FVF)
scheme suffer with transient and bandwidth performance degradation, circuit com-
plexity and a careful design of biasing network [38].
Alternatively current mirror based on bulk-driven, subthreshold and ﬂoating-gate
technology has also been proposed. The bulk-driven current mirrors suffer with higher
parasitic components and reduced swing. In contrast, the subthreshold current mir-
rors have the drawbacks of low transconductance resulting in poor bandwidth and
low matching accuracy [39–42].
In a conventional current mirror, the input compliance voltage and output com-
pliance voltage are given by

where VTh is the threshold voltage, IIn is the input current, ,n is the carrier mobil-
ity and COx is oxide capacitance. W and L refer to the width and length of the MOS
transistors.
The lower limit of VIn in eq. (7.27) is at least the value of the threshold voltage VTh.
If the input current IIn is small, it forces to act M1 in the subthreshold region where
VIn = VRef is sufﬁciently low (<100 mV).

prefer single transistor at the input port while keeping the cascode structure at the
output port as shown in Figure 7.28. Problem with this circuit is to provide suitable
biasing voltage Vb for charging the gate of M3. Recently, a current mirror with amp-
liﬁers for bias voltage has been proposed to improve the input and output resistance
performance as shown in Figure 7.29 [46].
7.7 Fundamentals of Current/Voltage Reference
An ideal current or voltage reference is independent of power supply and temperature.
The large signal current and voltage characteristics of an ideal current and voltage
reference are shown in Figure 7.30.
These characteristics are identical to those of the ideal current and voltage source.
The term “reference” is used when the current or voltage values have more precision
and stability than ordinarily found in a source.
A reference is typically dependent on the load connected to it. In the discussion
that follows, it will be assumed that an HP voltage reference can be used to implement
an HP current reference and vice versa.
A very crude voltage reference can be made from a voltage divider between the
power supplies as shown in Figures 7.31 and 7.32. Passive or active components can be
used as the divider element.
Figures 7.31 and 7.32 show an example of each. Unfortunately the value of VRef is
directly proportional to the power supply. Let us introduce the concept of sensitivity
S. The sensitivity of VRef to VDD can be expressed as

Equation (7.29) can be interpreted as follows: if the sensitivity is 1, then a 10% change
in VDD will result in a 10% change in VRef (which is undesirable for a voltage refer-
ence). A simple way of obtaining a better voltage reference is to use an active device
as shown in Figure 7.33.

Since I is normally greater than IS, the sensitivity of VRef of Figure 7.33 is less than

In order to adjust the value of VRef, Geometry dependent parameters can be varied. In
the BJT reference the geometry-dependent parameter is IS and for the MOS reference
it is W/L. The small signal output resistance of these references is a measure of how
dependent the reference will be on the load.
We have seen that since I is normally greater than IS, the sensitivity of VRef across
an active device is less than unity. If the voltage across the active device is used to cre-
ate a current and which in turn is used to give the original current through the device
then we obtain a voltage or current independent of VDD. This technique is named VTh
referenced source and is also called a bootstrap reference.
The circuit in Figure 7.37 is an example of this technique using MOS devices. Here
M3 and M4 are doing current mirroring. This causes the current I1 to be equal to I2.
Due to current I1 ﬂowing through M1 a voltage drop VGS1 is developed. Also due to
the current I2 ﬂowing through R a voltage drop I2R is developed. Since these two
voltages are connected with each other, an equilibrium point is established as shown
in Figure 7.38. Here I1 and I2 are plotted as a function of the voltage. The equilibrium
point Q is obtained by the intersection of these curves.
At equilibrium, I2R = VGS1. We know that the current I1 is given by
I1 = 1

So neither I1 nor I2 changes as a function of VDD. Therefore, the sensitivity of IQ to
VDD is zero which is the ideal one. By mirroring I2 = IQ through M5 or M6 a voltage
reference can be achieved using a resistor. However, there are two intersection points

7.7 Fundamentals of Current/Voltage Reference
279
in the I versus Vcurves in Figure 7.38: one at the origin and the other at Q. So there
are two equilibrium points and for the circuit to choose the correct point a start-up
circuit is required. Both I1 and I2 are zero at the origin of the I versus V characterist-
ics. But due to M7 which provides a current through M1 the circuit will move to the
equilibrium point Q. As the Q point is approached, due to the increase in the source
voltage of M7 the current through it decreases. At Q the current through M1 and M3 are
equal.
Alternately a circuit shown in Figure 7.39 uses VBE to reference the voltage or cur-
rent. This circuit also has two reference points and a start-up circuit is required to
choose the correct one.
Both the circuits in Figures 7.38 and 7.39 can be operated in the weak-threshold
inversion for developing a low power and supply voltage reference.
7.7.1 Another Way to Obtain Simple Bootstrap Voltage Reference Circuit with
Start-up Circuit
Our objective is to obtain a supply (VDD)-independent bootstrap voltage reference;
i.e. if the voltage across the active device is used to create a current and this current
is somehow used to provide the original current through the device, then a current
or voltage could be obtained that for all practical purposes becomes independent of
supply voltage VDD.
Let us consider the circuit shown in Figure 7.40.

Figure 7.40: Crude circuit for bootstrap voltage reference.
If we set the ratio of size of M4:M3 = 1:1 and M1:M2 = 1:1 the current through the
two paths becomes equal; i.e. the current I1 through M4 – M1 is equal to the current I2
through M2 – M3. Another important assumption to carry out is the voltage at node 2
is equal to the voltage at node 1; i.e. V2 = V1. To prove it, let us consider for example,
V1 is larger than V2. Now if V1 is higher than V2 then I1 will be less than I2. Therefore,
current through M1 is less than current through M2. Thus, higher current through M2
causes higher voltage drop across M2, which indicates that V2 is larger than V1. This
is a contradiction and is just opposite to our starting assumption. Therefore, V1 must
equal V2.
Therefore, in this circuit IRef is derived from IOut. Thus, IRef is bootstrapped to IOut
as M3– and M4 copy IOut, thereby deﬁning IRef. If CLM is neglected, since each diode-
connected device feeds from a current source, IOut and IRef are relatively independent
of VDD. Now in order to obtain IOut = KIRef for all general applications, we make some
changes in the circuit as shown in Figure 7.41.

Now, there is another question regarding the circuit: how does the circuit work when
we just switch on the power? If the currents through the two branches equal to zero,
then zero current will circulate through the loop. In the above expression of current,
there is no term of supply voltage VDD. Therefore, only switching on VDD does not have
any impact on the current ﬂowing through the circuit. Since initially before switch-
ing on the VDD, as the current is zero, after switching on VDD, zero current will ﬂow
through the circuit using current mirror action. Therefore, when we switch on VDD, we
need to introduce artiﬁcially some amount of current in the circuit. If we inject some
amount of initial current, the circuit itself balances itself. Therefore, some extra cir-
cuitry is required to inject some initial current, known as start-up circuit. Figure 7.42
shows the modiﬁed voltage reference with start-up circuit.

To describe its working, let us consider at the initial stage all the node voltages and
currents are zero. Now as the power is switched on, the current through M2 is zero or
very small. Therefore, current through M5 is also zero as M5 and M3 are mirror con-
nected. Therefore, the drop across RS is also small. Thus, the input to the ﬁrst digital
CMOS inverter is logic “0”, i.e. below the threshold voltage of the inverter. Then output
of the second inverter is logic “0”, which turns on M6, which is very much conductive.
As M6 is turned on, it introduces and injects current in the circuit from VDD through
M6 and M1. Because of mirror action, this current circulates through the loop. There-
fore, current through M2 and M3 increases. This causes increase in current through
M5, which causes an increase in the voltage drop across RS. As this built-up voltage
drop across RS crosses the threshold voltage of the inverter, the ﬁrst inverter identi-
ﬁes its input as a logic “1”. Then the logic “1” output of the second inverter causes
M6 to cease its conduction. Then the circuit balances itself. Therefore, introduction of
this start-up circuit causes introduction of some current through the circuit; later the
circuit stabilizes itself to its required IOut value.
7.8 Bandgap Voltage Reference
Analog IC incorporates voltage and current references. As mentioned earlier, the
objective of reference generation is to establish a DC voltage or current that is inde-
pendent of the supply, process and temperature variation. The bootstrapped reference
discussed in earlier section is not sensitive to supply variation; i.e. they are supply
independent. However, in addition to supply variability, process and temperature
variability may be critical as well. It is worth mentioning that reference voltage or
currents that exhibit little dependence on temperature prove critical in many ap-
plications. It is interesting to note that, since most process parameters vary with
temperature, if a reference is temperature-independent, then usually it is process
independent as well.
Now the question is how we can generate a quantity that remains constant with
temperature. We postulate that if two quantities having opposite temperature coef-
ﬁcients (TCs) are added with proper weighting, they result a zero TC. For example,
consider two voltages V1 and V2 with opposite TCs. Now, if we choose a1 and b1 in
such a way so that
a1
∂V1
∂T + b1
∂V2
∂T = 0, then we can obtain a reference voltage VRef = a1V1 + b1V2 with
zero TC. We should now identify two voltages having positive and negative TCs.
7.8.1 Positive TC Voltage
It was observed that the base-emitter voltage (VBE) difference between two bipolar
transistors is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). The circuit shown in
Figure 7.43 shows two identical transistors (with equal scale current IS1 = IS2) are

7.9 An Introduction to Analog Design Automation
IC manufacturing industry has shown a rapid advance in terms of complexity, func-
tionality and productivity. This has been possible only by the prevalent use of
computer-aided design (CAD) tools. All CAD tools are intended for use within a

well-deﬁned design ﬂow. The design ﬂow for digital IC design has become a well-
deﬁned standard. Such a standard design ﬂow does not exist in analog IC design
domain. Research on analog design automation (ADA) is very limited compared to
digital design automation (DA). There is no such well-deﬁned structured design meth-
odology. Researchers have concentrated mostly either on speciﬁc tool designed for
speciﬁc applications or on tools targeted toward speciﬁc aspects of a design like SPICE
which is a tool used for circuit-level simulation. The major reason behind this lack of
availability of ADA tool is the difﬁculty of the problem. In analog design the numbers
of parameters are large with a huge interactivity among them. Due to the lack of a
structured design methodology and automation tools, analog design remained more
of an art than a science.
A short time to market is essential to make proﬁt for an IC manufacturer. Due to
availability of modern computers and DA software, digital designers are able to design
multimillion transistor chips in less than a year, whereas a team of analog designers
may require a similar time to design an analog chip (or an analog section of a chip)
consisting of a few hundred transistors. The digital designers can update or change
their designs in a few weeks, whereas the analog designers may require a time sim-
ilar to the original design time. The situation described above is not continuing in
the same direction. There is strong demand generating for ADA tools. Recently, the IC
Design industry has been moving to SoC designs, where a single chip may contain
both analog and digital circuits. An SoC requires various design blocks from vari-
ous ﬁelds. A designer, or even a company, cannot be an expert on all these different
ﬁelds and may choose to use the designs of others. This brings us to the concept of
intellectual property (IP) reuse in IC design.
An ADA environment is applying IP reuse efﬁciently but in a different manner
from digital domain. This leads to a general design ﬂow methodology for ADA tools
with well-deﬁned inputs, outputs and duties. Analog blocks typically constitute only
a small fraction of the components on MS ICs and emerging SoC designs. But due to
the increasing levels of integration available in silicon technology and the growing
requirement for digital systems to communicate with the continuous valued external
world, there is a growing need for CAD tools that increase the design productivity and
improve the quality of analog ICs. This chapter describes the motivation and evolution
of these tools and outlines progress on the various design problems involved such
as simulation and modeling, symbolic analysis, synthesis and optimization, layout
generation, yield analysis and design centering.
In the coming section of the chapter, a brief survey on previous analog design ﬂow
is presented with related terminologies.
7.9.1 Survey of Previous Analog Design Flow
This survey [47–50] presents a complete and recent overview of recent advances in
the state of the art for CAD tools for analog and MS ICs. In recent years, complete

systems that previously occupied one or more boards have been integrated on a few
chips or even one single chip. Examples of such SoC are the single-chip TV or the
single-chip camera or new generations of integrated telecommunication systems that
include analog, digital and eventually radio frequency (RF) sections on one chip.
Normally the technology chosen is CMOS but BiCMOS can be used for RF and ana-
log circuits. Analog circuits are needed to make the interface between the real world
and electronic system, although other major parts are digital in nature. A typical SoC
looks like that shown in Figure 7.45. It contains memory, processor, logic and also some
analog interface to communicate with the external world.
There is a trend to replace analog circuit functions with digital computations (e.g.
digital signal processing in place of analog ﬁltering), but still there are some typ-
ical functions that will always remain analog. Analog circuits are indispensable in
all electronic applications that interface with the outside world as shown below:
– The input side of a system is a typical analog function: signals from a sensor, micro-
phone, antenna, etc., must be sensed or received and then ampliﬁed and ﬁltered
up to a level that allows digitization with sufﬁcient SNR ratio.
– The second typical analog function is on the output side of a system: the signal
is reconverted from digital to analog form and it has to be strengthened so that it
can drive the outside load (e.g. actuator, antenna, and loudspeaker) without too
much distortion. Typical analog circuits used here are drivers and buffers, ﬁlters,
oscillators and mixers (in case of up-conversion).
– The third type of blocks is the true MS circuits that interface the above analog
circuits with the DSP part of the system. Typical circuits used here are the sample-
and-hold circuits for signal sampling, analog-to-digital converters for amplitude
discretization, digital-to-analog converters for signal reconstruction, and phase-
locked loops and frequency synthesizers to generate a timing reference or perform
timing synchronization.
– In addition, the above circuits need stable absolute references for their operation,
which are generated by voltage and current reference circuits, crystal oscillat-
ors, etc.

7.9 An Introduction to Analog Design Automation
287
When both analog (possibly RF) and digital circuits are needed in a system, it be-
comes obvious to integrate them together to reduce cost and improve performance,
provided the technology allows us to do so. Therefore, with the advancement of VLSI
technology there is a need for higher level of integration. As a result of which the
market shares of mixed signal ICs increase. Recent developments in CMOS technology
(shrinkage to submicrometer region) have offered the possibility to combine good and
scalable digital performance with adequate analog performance on the same die.
The possibilities of higher levels of system integration offer analog MOS transistor
performance that approaches the performance of a bipolar transistor. This explains
why CMOS is the technology of choice today, and why other technologies like BiCMOS
are only used when more aggressive bipolar device characteristics (e.g. power, noise
or distortion) are really needed. The technology shift from bipolar to CMOS (or BiC-
MOS) has been apparent in most applications. Even ﬁelds like RF, where traditionally
GaAs and bipolar were the dominant technologies, now show a trend toward BiCMOS
(preferably with a SiGe option) and even plain CMOS for reasons of higher integration
and cost reduction. These higher levels of MS integration, however, also introduce a
whole new set of problems and design effects that need to be accounted for in the
design process.
With the increasing complexity the following factors are popping up:
(1)
More and more transistor-performing digital and analog operations must be
considered together with embedded software.
(2)
New signal processing algorithms must be developed to cater for the functional-
ity and performance requirement.
(3)
Due to the rapid evolution of process technologies, the expectation for changing
process technology parameters needs to be accounted for in the design cycle.
(4)
Most importantly, the time-to-market factor is very critical for Application Spe-
ciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs) because if one misses the initial market window
relative to the competition, prices and, therefore, proﬁt can be seriously affected.
All the above-mentioned effects of increased design complexity can be managed with
the help of CAD and veriﬁcation tools. What is needed to expedite the analog and MS
design process is a structured methodology and supporting CAD tools to manage the
entire design process and design complexity.
CAD tools are also needed to assist or automate many of the routine and repet-
itive design tasks, taking away the tedium of manually designing these sections and
providing the designer with more time to focus on the creative aspects of design.
Therefore, analog CAD and circuit DA are likely to play a key role in the design
process of the next generation of MS ICs and ASICs.
Analog CAD effort started with mixed-signal ASIC but in recent years it has moved
toward a complete SoC design.
The story of automation is different for analog and digital side. Due to the lack
of well-matured CAD tool in analog domain, the analog part design in an MS IC is a
bottleneck. There are not yet any robust commercial CAD tools to support or automate

288
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
analog circuit design apart from circuit simulators like SPICE and layout editing en-
vironments and their accompanying tools (layout veriﬁcation tools, extraction, layout
versus schematic (LVS), etc.). Analog design in general is perceived as less systematic
and more heuristic and knowledge-intensive in nature than digital design. That is why
till now, it was not possible to establish a higher level of abstraction which shields the
lower level process details from the higher level design. Analog design requires skill
obtained through years of experience.
The number of conﬂicting requirements, variety of schematics, dependability on
process or device sizes and non-idealities and parasitic effect in analog design explain
why digital design ﬂow cannot be adopted for ADA. Instead a separate speciﬁc analog
solutions need to be developed that are targeted at the analog design paradigm and
complexity.
Despite the lack of commercial analog CAD tools, analog CAD and DA over the
past 15 years has been a ﬁeld of profound academic and industrial research activity,
although with not quite as many researchers as in the digital world, resulting in a
slow but steady progress. Analog circuit and layout synthesis have recently shown
promising results at the research level, but commercial solutions are only starting to
appear in the marketplace.
The development of analog and MS hardware description languages like VHDL-
AMS and Verilog-AMS is intended to provide a unifying trend that will link the various
ADA tasks in a coherent framework that supports a more structured analog design
methodology from the design conceptualization stage to the manufacturing stage.
They also provide a link between the analog and the digital domains, as needed in
designing mixed analog–digital ICs and the SoC of the future.
7.9.2 Analog and Mixed-signal Design Process
A hierarchical design methodology consists of a top-down synthesis and a bottom-up
veriﬁcation at every level of the hierarchy. The various stages that are traversed in the
design process are as follows:
– Conceptual Design: In this stage the product is in conceptual stage and usu-
ally described by mathematical tools such as Matlab/Simulink after gathering the
speciﬁcations.
– System Design: After system concept, system design is carried out followed by
simulations and veriﬁcation. This stage contains little implementation details. The
whole system is portioned into software and hardware parts. Hardware parts are
described using behavioral model. This stage includes decisions about implement-
ation issues, such as package selection, choice of the target technology and general
test strategy.
– Architectural Design: The partitioning of the system into digital and analog blocks
is done in this stage. The various blocks are described by appropriate hardware
description language (e.g. VHDL and VHDL-AMS) using behavioral model.

7.9 An Introduction to Analog Design Automation
289
– Cell Design: The analog blocks with the given speciﬁcations, and in the selected
technology process, result in a fully sized device-level circuit schematic. The res-
ulting circuit design is then veriﬁed against the speciﬁcations using SPICE-type
circuit simulations. Selection of proper process technology and decision about
device sizing is required in this stage.
– Cell Layout: The circuit in the form of schematic is transformed into geometric
shapes (layout) in this stage. This stage involves area optimization to make the total
area small. After the generation of the layout, parasitics are extracted to view their
effects and to ensure functionality of the circuit even in the presence of parasitics.
– System Layout: System-level layout is generated by block place and route. In addi-
tion, power-grid routing is done in this stage. Test structures are inserted in this
stage. Detailed veriﬁcation or timing analysis is done in this stage. Finally, the
system is veriﬁed by co-simulating the hardware part with the embedded software.
– Fabrication and Testing: This is the processing stage where the masks are gen-
erated and the ICs fabricated. Testing is performed during and after fabrication in
order to reject defective devices.
The system design is then given as input to the architectural design phase, which is
the input to the cell design, cell layout and system layout phases. Each of these phases
has a feedback loop consisting of simulation and veriﬁcation as shown in Figure 7.46.
The top-down direction is called forward progress, whereas the bottom-up phase is
called backtracking and redesign.

7.9.3 Hierarchical Analog Design Methodology
The hierarchical design methodology is prevalent in many of the emerging analog CAD
systems.
As for example for the design of a phase-locked loop, the analog block is sub-
divided into smaller blocks (for example, loop ﬁlter or a comparator, etc.). The
subblocks are designed after the derived speciﬁcation from the original block or
the subblock can be further divided into smaller subblocks. This process ensures
that the top-level block fulﬁll its speciﬁcation. The decomposition goes on un-
til a level where a block ﬁnds its physical implementation (transistor level or by
standard cells).
This type of decomposition is a top-down process. It is followed by a bottom-up
layout implementation and design veriﬁcation process. IC manufacturing is ex-
pensive; therefore veriﬁcation is very important which ensures that the design is
meeting its speciﬁcation; otherwise redesign is done.
Each block in the top-down direction takes an architecture or topology from
the preceding block as well as performance constraints. Its output is a more de-
tailed circuit diagram (or ﬁnally layout) as well as new speciﬁcations for the next
block. Thus, each block in the forward direction does a speciﬁcation translation and
topology selection (Figure 7.47). Most experimental analog CAD systems today use
a performance-driven design strategy within such analog design hierarchy. This
strategy consists of the alternation of the following steps in between any two levels
and of the design hierarchy.
(1)
Top-down path
– Topology selection;
– Speciﬁcation translation (or circuit sizing);
– Design veriﬁcation.
(2)
Bottom-up path
– Layout generation;
– Detailed design veriﬁcation (after extraction).
Topology selection: Select the best topology that matches the system. For an analog-
to-digital converter, for instance, topology selection could be selecting between a
ﬂash, a successive approximation, etc.
Speciﬁcation translation: It is the step of mapping the speciﬁcations for the block
under design at a given level (e.g. a converter) into individual speciﬁcations for each
of the subblocks (e.g. a comparator) within the selected block topology, so that the
complete block meets its speciﬁcations, while possibly optimizing the design toward
some application-speciﬁc design objectives (e.g. minimal power consumption). The
downstream speciﬁcations are veriﬁed by simulations.
Layout generation: It is the step of generating the geometrical layout of the block
under design by assembling (place and route) the already generated layouts of the

composing subblocks. At the lowest level, these subblocks are individual devices or
selected device groupings, which themselves are generated by parameterized proced-
ural device layout generators. Also, power, ground and substrate connection routing
are part of the layout generation step. This step is followed by extraction and, again,
detailed veriﬁcation and simulation to check the impact of the layout parasitics on the
overall circuit performance.
The above methodology is called performance-driven or constraint-driven, as
the performance speciﬁcations are the driving input to each of the steps. Throughout
the design ﬂow, constraints need to be propagated down the hierarchy to make sure
that the top-level block in the end meets its target speciﬁcations. The advantage of
top-down design: it catches problems early in the design ﬂow and, therefore, has
a higher chance of ﬁrst-time success, while obtaining a better overall system
design.
In the above top-down/bottom-up design ﬂow, redesign or backtracking itera-
tions may therefore be needed at any point where a design step fails to meet its input
speciﬁcations. In that case, one or more of the previously executed steps will have to

292
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
be redone; for example, another circuit topology can be selected instead of the failing
one, or another partitioning of subblock speciﬁcations can be performed.
The following section identiﬁes the main tasks needed for above analog design
methodology.
7.9.4 Current Status for the Main Tasks in Analog Design Automation
A. Simulation
Simulation tools are provided to ensure cost-effective design correctness by means of
design veriﬁcation without actual fabrication of the device. Simulation is crucial and
it plays a major key role in design ﬂow. Analog ICs are typically impacted by many
higher order effects that can severely degrade the circuit performance once fabricated,
if the effects are not properly accounted for during the design process.
(1)
Circuit Simulation: Circuit simulation begins with SPICE. This simulator numer-
ically solves the system of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAE) that
characterize the circuit by using traditional techniques of numerical analysis. For
example, to compute the evolution of the circuit’s response in time, the time-
derivative operator is ﬁrst discretized by an implicit integration scheme such
as the backward-Euler or trapezoidal rule. At each time point, the resulting set
of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved iteratively via the Newton–Raphson
method, with the matrix solution required to update the approximate solution
computed using sparse matrix techniques.
Circuit simulation is a good design aid here, providing the capability of simulating
many of the higher order effects and verifying circuit performance prior to fabrica-
tion, provided the effects are modeled properly. Many variants and descendants of the
SPICE simulator are now marketed by a number of CAD vendors and many IC man-
ufacturers have in-house versions of the SPICE simulator that have been adapted to
their own proprietary processes and designs. A few examples of the many commercial
SPICE-class simulators are HSPICE (Synopsys), Spectre (Cadence Design Systems) and
Eldo (Mentor Graphics).
The inaccuracy of the models used in SPICE simulation is a matter of concern.
However, recent models such as BSIM3 v3, Philips model 9 or EKV look more prom-
ising for analog design by providing smooth and continuous transitions between
different operating regions. For RF applications, however, even these models are not
accurate enough, creating a need for accurate RF modeling.
With the explosion of MS designs, the need has also arisen for simulation tools
that allow not only simulation of analog or digital circuits separately, but also simu-
lation of truly mixed analog-digital designs. Therefore, so-called glued mixed-mode
simulators address the conversions of the signals between analog and digital signal
representations. Therefore, mixed-mode simulators were developed that glue together

an accurate SPICE-like analog simulator to an efﬁcient digital simulator. The general
scheme of these so-called glued MS simulators is shown in Figure 7.48. These simu-
lators partition the netlist into digital and analog parts that are each simulated by a
separate kernel that interfaces through a simulation “backplane”: an analog kernel
with adaptive time-step control, and a digital kernel with its event-driven mechanism.
As representative examples of modern MS simulators, we would mention the Advance
MS (Mentor Graphics) and AMS Designer tools (Cadence Design Systems).
B. Circuit Modeling
In recent years, the need has also arisen for higher levels of abstraction to describe
and simulate analog circuits, because of the following reasons:
(1)
In a top-down design methodology it will be possible to describe a design without
knowing the lower level actual implementation details.
(2)
At a higher level veriﬁcation can be done to check the practicality of the system.
For a commercial simulator to be useful in current industrial MS design practice, it
therefore has to be capable of simulating a system containing a mix of analog blocks
described at different levels and in different domains, in combination with digital
blocks. This requires a true MS multilevel, mixed-domain simulator.
To allow an easy exchange of these models across different simulators and differ-
ent users, the need arose for standardized analog hardware description languages
to describe these higher level models. For MS designs, the analog HDLs had to be com-
patible with the existing digital HDLs (such as VHDL and Verilog). Several parallel
analog or MS HDL language standardization efforts, therefore, have been initiated,
recently resulting in the standardized languages VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS. The
VHDL-AMS language targets the MS domain and is a superset of the digital VHDL lan-
guage. Recently, also, the standardization of an extension of VDHL-AMS toward RF
has been started.

294
7 Analog Low Power VLSI Circuit Design
In addition, high level models also form a key part of several analog circuit syn-
thesis and optimization systems, both at the circuit level as well as for the hierarchical
synthesis of more complex blocks.
Most of the basic techniques in both circuit and layout synthesis today rely on
powerful numerical optimization engines coupled to “evaluation engines” that qual-
ify the merit of some evolving analog circuit or layout candidate. This basic scheme of
optimization-based analog circuit sizing is shown in Figure 7.49. The most general but
also by far the slowest solution is to call the transistor-level simulator as evaluation en-
gine during each iteration of the optimization of a circuit. The Central Processing Unit
(CPU) time can be reduced signiﬁcantly by replacing the simulations by model eval-
uations. These models can be behavioral simulation models as described above, or
they can be what are termed performance models. Rather than modeling the input–
output behavior, performance models directly relate the achievable performances of a
circuit (e.g. gain, bandwidth or slew rate) to the design variables (e.g. device sizes and
biasing). In the synthesis procedure, calls to the transistor-level simulation are then
replaced by performance model evaluations, resulting in substantial speedups of the
overall synthesis, once the performance models have been created and calibrated. For
the synthesis of more complex analog blocks, a hierarchical approach is needed, in
which higher level models are indispensable to bridge between the different levels.
Table 7.4 gives an overview of the different analog hardware description levels.
The circuit level is the traditional level where a circuit is simulated as a network of
physical components. In a macromodel, an equivalent but computationally cheaper
circuit representation is used that has approximately the same behavior as the original
circuit. Equivalent sources combine the effect of several other elements that are elim-
inated from the netlist. The simulation speedup is roughly proportional to the number

This typically will be in the form of a set of differential algebraic equations or transfer
functions. At the behavioral level, conservation laws still have to be satisﬁed; at the
functional level this is no longer the case, and the simulated system turns into a kind
of signal-ﬂow diagram.
C. Dedicated Simulation Techniques
Techniques or tools have been developed for dedicated purposes. The important types
of circuits that are used in many signal processing and communication systems are the
switched circuits, like switched-capacitor and, more recently, switched-current cir-
cuits. Their switched nature, with the resulting switching transients, requires many
small numerical integration steps to be simulated within each clock phase if a stand-
ard SPICE simulator is used. This is exploited in several SC simulation tools like
SWITCAP, SWAP and TOSCA that analyzes SC-based converters.
Another important domain where more tools are needed is RF simulation, needed
for instance when developing circuits for wireless applications.
D. Analog Behavioral Model Generation Technique
One of the biggest problems today is the lack of systematic methods to create good ana-
log behavioral or performance models. Techniques used here can roughly be divided
into ﬁtting or regression approaches and constructive approaches.
Fitting or Regression Methods. In the ﬁtting or regression approaches, a parameter-
ized mathematical model is proposed or constructed by the model developer, and the
values of the parameters p are selected as to best approximate the known (simulated)
circuit behavior, as schematically depicted in Figure 7.50.
Symbolic Analysis of Analog Circuits. The second class of methods, the constructive
approaches, tries to generate or build a model from the underlying circuit descrip-
tion. One approach, for instance, uses symbolic analysis techniques to generate ﬁrst
the exact set of algebraic/differential equations describing the circuit, which are then

simpliﬁed within a given error bound of the exact response using both global and local
simpliﬁcations.
A symbolic simulator is a computer tool that takes as input an ordinary (SPICE
type) netlist and returns as output (simpliﬁed) analytic expressions for the requested
circuit network functions in terms of the symbolic representations of the frequency
variable and (some or all of) the circuit elements. They perform the same function that
designers traditionally do by hand analysis (even the simpliﬁcation). The difference is
that the analysis is now done by the computer, which is much faster, can handle more
complex circuits and does not make as many errors. An example of a complicated
BiCMOS OP-AMP is shown in eq. (7.40):

(7.40)
The symbolic expression gives a better insight into which small signal circuit para-
meters predominantly determine the gain in this OP-AMP and how the user has to
design the circuit to meet a certain gain constraint. Dedicated symbolic analysis tools
have been developed that use heuristic simpliﬁcation. Examples of such tools are
ISAAC, SYNAP and ASAP; they are successful for circuits containing only 10–15 tran-
sistors. In recent years, however, an algorithmic breakthrough in the ﬁeld of symbolic
circuit analysis has been realized. Tools like SYMBA and RAINIER highly reduce the
computation time and, therefore, enable the symbolic analysis of large analog circuits
of practical size (like the entire 741 OP-AMP).
E. Analog Circuit Synthesis and Optimization
Synthesis is a critical step since most analog designs require a custom-optimized
design, and the number of (often-conﬂicting) performance requirements to be taken
into account is large.
During synthesis, the block performance is speciﬁed and an appropriate topology
to implement this block has to be decided ﬁrst. This step is called topology selection.
Subsequently, values for the subblock parameters have to be determined so that the
ﬁnal block meets the speciﬁed performance constraints. This step is called speciﬁca-
tion translation at higher levels in the design hierarchy, in which case performance
speciﬁcations of subblocks have to be determined, or circuit sizing at the device level,

in which case the sizes and biasing of all devices have to be determined. Figure 7.51
illustrates this ﬂow for low level cells.
The circuit-level synthesis tool used in the ADA system can be optimization-based
where the desired performance parameters as well as the selected topology for each
block are supplied to the circuit-level synthesis tool. After optimization is carried out,
the tool gives a sized netlist for the block in SPICE format. Again, with inputs and out-
puts deﬁned as such, it can be used as a stand-alone tool for analog circuit designers.
The most important aspect of the synthesis tool is its optimization algorithm. It is
well known that the performance of simulated annealing (SA) is strongly dependent
on its parameters like cooling regime, initial conditions, etc. A wrong choice of these
parameters can result in the algorithm to be stuck at a local minimum. Unfortunately,
these parameters change from example to example and there is no way of predict-
ing them beforehand. Evolutionary strategies (ES) suffer much less from this problem.
They tend to converge to a region around the desired solution but may take a very long
time or may even fail to converge to the ﬁnal solution. An algorithm combines these
two is superior in performance to both.
F. Analog and Mixed-signal Layout Synthesis
The next important step in the analog design ﬂow after the circuit synthesis is the
generation of the layout. The ﬁeld of analog layout synthesis is more mature than cir-
cuit synthesis, in large part because it has been able to leverage ideas from the mature
ﬁeld of digital layout. Yet real commercial solutions are only beginning to appear in re-
cent years. The typical analog layout hierarchy comprises two fundamentally different
types of layout tasks.
Cell-level layout. The focus here is really device-level layout, placement, and routing
of individual active and passive devices. At this level, many of the low level matching,
symmetry, merging, reshaping and proximity management tactics for polygon-level
optimization are applied. The goal is to create cells that are suitably insulated not
only from ﬂuctuations in fabrication and operating environment, but from probable
coupling with neighboring pieces of layout.
System-level layout. The focus here is cell composition, arranging and interconnect-
ing the individual cells to complete an analog subsystem. At this level, isolation is
one major concern: from nearby noisy digital circuits coupled in via substrate, power
grid or package. The other concern is signal integrity. Some number of digital signals

from neighboring digital blocks needs to penetrate into any analog regions, and these
signals may be fundamentally incompatible with some sensitive analog signals.
Programmable layout. The focus here is applying ﬁeld-programmable gate array
(FPGA) ideas to analog designs (FPAA). The idea is to bypass completely the need
to do custom cells. Rather, a set of programmable active and passive elements is con-
nected with programmable wiring to achieve low performance analog functions. This
is a relatively recent implementation strategy, but we expect to see it grow.
G. Yield Estimation and Optimization
The manufacturing of ICs suffers from statistical ﬂuctuations inherent to the fabrica-
tion process itself. These ﬂuctuations can be local (e.g. lithographic spots) or global
(e.g. gate oxide gradients). These process-induced deformations result in deviations of
the actual performances of the fabricated ICs from the expected performances. Some
of these deformations result in the fabricated IC not having the expected functional-
ity. This is then called a structural failure. Others cause the fabricated IC to have,
despite the correct functionality, observed performances far from the targeted values.
This is then called a hard performance failure. Both failures are also termed cata-
strophic failures, caused by a catastrophic fault. Other process deformations result in
the observed performances deviating only slightly around the targeted values due to
the statistical tolerances (inter-die variations) and mismatches (intra-die variations)
of the device parameters. This is then called a parametric (or soft) performance
failure, caused by a parametric fault.
The ratio of the accepted total number of fabricated ICs is called the yield. If the
yield is signiﬁcantly less than 100%, this implies a ﬁnancial loss to the IC manufac-
turer. Therefore, it is important to already calculate and maximize the manufacturing
yield during the design stage. This is called design for manufacturability, which
implies techniques for yield estimation and yield optimization. A simple approach
often used in practice is worst-case analysis. Instead of doing a true statistical ana-
lysis, some worst-case combinations (e.g. slow p-type devices, fast n-type devices,
etc.) of the device parameters are used to calculate the “worst case” corners of the
performances.
The most straightforward statistical approach is to use Monte-Carlo simulations,
in which a large number of samples of the device parameters are generated according
to the given statistics.
H. Analog and Mixed-signal Testing and Design for Testability
The ﬁnal step in the IC production cycle is the testing of the IC. The objective of testing
is to verify whether the fabricated IC meets the speciﬁcations it was designed for or
not. The cost of testing is a considerable part of the ﬁnal cost of an IC, and the later in
the production cycle if a certain defect is detected, the more expensive is the ﬁnancial
loss. The effective cost of a product is therefore related to the quality of the applied
tests and the time necessary to generate and apply the tests. In MS designs, an addi-
tional complication is that, although analog circuits constitute only a small fraction

7.10 Field-programmable Analog Arrays
299
of the die area, they are responsible for the largest fraction of the overall test cost.
This is not only because they require more expensive MS test equipment, but also be-
cause they require longer test times than the digital circuitry and because there are no
structured test waveform generation tools or structured design for test methodologies.
7.10 Field-programmable Analog Arrays
Finally we mention one very recent analog layout style which is radically different
from those mentioned above. In the digital realm, FPGAs have revolutionized di-
gital prototyping and rapid time-to-market designs. Integrating programmable logic
elements and programmable interconnect, these allow rapid customization with no
fabrication steps. An obvious question is: can a similar technology be adapted for
analog and MS designs? The apparent answer is a qualiﬁed “yes”.
Early work directly mimicked the FPGA style of small primitive functions connect-
able by programmable interconnect. However, the loading that is already problematic
in digital designs proved even more deleterious here. Later designs moved up to higher
level building blocks (e.g. OP-AMPs, switches, capacitor arrays) and also focused new
energy on sensitive analog design of the programmable interconnect. FPAAs are just
beginning to be commercially available. They are currently so small however, that lay-
out is not really a problem. It will be interesting to see if these designs become larger
(e.g. larger digital blocks with smaller analog blocks), and if so, if automatic layout
becomes a requirement.
A ﬁeld-programmable analog array (FPAA) is an integrated device containing con-
ﬁgurable analog blocks (CAB) and interconnects between these blocks as shown in
Figure 7.52. Unlike their digital cousin, the FPGA, the devices tend to be more ap-
plication driven than general purpose as they may be current mode or voltage mode
devices. For voltage mode devices, each block usually contains an operational amp-
liﬁer in combination with programmable conﬁguration of passive components. The
blocks can, for example, act as summers or integrators.
FPAAs usually operate in one of two modes: continuous time and discrete time.
(a)
Discrete-time devices possess a system sample clock. In a SC design, all blocks
sample their input signals with a sample-and-hold circuit composed of a semi-
conductor switch and a capacitor. This feeds a programmable OP-AMP section,
which can be routed to a number of other blocks. This design requires more
complex semiconductor construction. An alternative, switched-current design,
offers simpler construction and does not require the input capacitor, but can
be less accurate and has lower fan out; it can drive only one following block.
Both discrete-time device types must compensate for switching noise, aliasing at
the system sample rate, and sample-rate limited bandwidth, during the design
phase.

Figure 7.52: FPAA structure.
(b)
Continuous-time devices work more like an array of transistors or OP-AMPs,
which can operate at their full bandwidth. The components are connected in
a particular arrangement through a conﬁgurable array of switches. During cir-
cuit design, the switch matrix’s parasitic inductance, capacitance and noise
contributions must be taken into account.
The FPAA structure consists of a two-dimensional array of CABs, which include di-
gitally conﬁgurable transconductors (differential transconductance ampliﬁers). The
arrangement in a hexagonal layout allows reconﬁgurable routing of analog signals
throughout the chip. Series and parallel connection as well as feedback of any order
is provided by the structure. Every CAB has six branches connecting to the respect-
ive neighbor CABs and one for self-feedback. The massive parallel connections of
both parasitic input capacitances as well as parasitic output capacitances at the in-
put nodes of each CAB sum up to capacitances in an order of magnitude such that
they are suitable as integrating capacitances for the ﬁlter up to unity-gain bandwidths
of 200 MHz.
It can be shown that a large number of different ﬁlter types with different orders
can be synthesized on the FPAA, for example, second-order low pass (blue), lossy
integrator (green) or fourth-order biquad Butterworth band pass (red). All the CAB
nodes are fed to outputs so that any combination of six inputs and seven outputs is
possible. The FPAA could be changed from six independent ﬁrst-order low pass paths
to only one path with a large number of transconductors while being embedded into
the application system. Thus, the circuit can instantaneously be adapted to a wide
range of varying needs in analog ﬁltering.

7.11 Summary
The last few years have seen signiﬁcant advances in both design methodology and
CAD tool support for analog, MS and RF designs. Despite this enormous progress in
research and commercial EDA offerings that today enable the efﬁcient design of ana-
log blocks for embedding in MS integrated systems (ASICs, SoCs), several problems
still remain to be solved.
In order to meet the economic constraints (time to market, cost, quality) of future
semiconductor products, analog design will have to be carried out in a much more
systematic and structured way, supported by methodologies and tools that ﬁt in the
overall system design ﬂow. Given the demand for MS ICs, we expect no reduction in
the interest in various layout tools to speed the design of these important circuits.
