INTRODUCTION
The focus of this textbook is to discuss both catalytic and non-catalytic chemical reactions 
that take place in a porous pellet. The target audience are advanced undergraduate or 
graduate students in the chemical engineering or in related areas. This textbook has been 
written to fulfill three major goals: 
1.	To introduce the mathematical models describing the chemical reactions 
accompanied by heat and mass transfer in the pellets.
2.	To explain the numerical or analytical methods for solving the model equations.
3.	To discuss the numerical results.
The features of this book can be summarized as follows: (a) model equations are fully derived, 
(b) all chapters and all figures are illustrated with computer programs and (c) programs 
are explained in the text. Computer programs are available to download on Bookboon’s 
companion website.
The programs are written in Python and implemented as IPython notebooks. SciPy, 
NumPy and Matplotlib libraries are used to numerically solve the model equations and 
to visualize simulated results. All of these tools are easy to use, well supported by a large 
online community, and available for free. The installation of IPython system is explained 
in Appendix A1 and the brief overview of python computer language is given in Appendix 
A2. Using the developed tools, readers will be able to solve problems that appear in their 
study or research in the future.
We begin this book by reviewing the mechanism of mass and heat transfer in a porous media. 
Then we derive the mass balance equation and solve it analytically for the first-order reaction 
in isothermal spherical pellet. The following chapter describes the second-order reaction in 
isothermal pellet and an orthogonal collocation method is introduced as a numerical method 
for solving model equations. Then we discuss the chemical reaction in the non-isothermal 
pellet. We derive the heat balance equation and show how to solve numerically the system 
of mass and heat balance equations using a finite-difference method. Next we discuss the 
enzymatic reaction taking place in the pellet. We close the book with the chapter describing 
the non-catalytic reaction in an agglomerate of submicron particles. In this example we take 
into account the change in the agglomerate porous structure with reaction progress. We use 
a method of lines to solve the unsteady-state mass and heat balances.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION ON CATALYTIC REACTION IN 
POROUS PELLETS
Before we can derive the differential equation describing the chemical reaction, mass and 
heat transfer in a porous pellet, we need to consider the general steps through which the 
reaction proceeds and discuss the mechanisms of mass and heat transfer in porous media.
Here, we assume that the catalyst pellets are manufactured by agglomeration of primary 
fine particles. The catalytic material is dispersed in the micropores of primary particles. 
The void spaces among particles form macropores bounded by the outer particle surfaces, 
as shown in Fig. 1.1. The heterogeneously catalyzed reaction $
%
o
 takes place on active 
sites in the micropores of primary particles. The reaction proceeds through the following 
sequential steps:
•	 Diffusion of the gaseous reactant A from the bulk phase to the external pellet 
surface through a boundary layer located at the external surface of the pellet.
•	 Diffusion of the reactant A in the macropore spaces to the outer surface of 
primary particles. Then, the reactant A diffuses in the micropore from the pore 
mouth to the point where adsorption and reaction take place.
•	 Adsorption of the reactant A on the active catalytic site.
•	 Surface reaction of the adsorbed species A to produce the product B adsorbed on 
active site.
•	 Desorption of the product B.
•	 Diffusion of B through the micropore and macropore porous spaces to the 
external pellet surface.
•	 Diffusion of the product B from the external pellet surface into the bulk gas 
phase through the boundary layer.

Introduction
Figure 1.1: Illustration of sequential steps in reaction process in porous catalyst pellet.
An overall rate of reaction can be limited by the intrinsic rate of surface catalytic reaction, 
rate of mass transfer of reactant or product inside the catalyst pellet, rate of mass transfer 
through the boundary layer outside the pellet or by any combination of these processes. 
At the low temperature and for slow reactions, the intrinsic rate of surface reaction is slow, 
resulting in the absence of the concentration gradient inside and outside catalyst pellet. 
If the intrinsic rate of surface reaction has similar magnitude or faster rate than the mass 
transfer rates, the concentration gradient will developed in the pellet or in the boundary 
layer around catalyst pellet.
To characterize the ratio of intrinsic reaction rate to the rate of mass transfer, we introduce 
a catalytic effectiveness factor K , which is defined as the ratio of observed rate of reaction 
to the rate of reaction at the surface concentration, 

$
& . It accounts for the extent of 
reduction in the overall reaction rate due to the lower concentration of reactant inside the 
catalyst pellet as compared to the surface concentration. If the effectiveness factor is close to 
one, the all internal surface of catalyst pellet are utilized and the reaction rate at the pellet 
center is the same as the rate at the outer surface. In the case when effectiveness factor is 
approaching zero, only the outer surface of catalyst pellet is used, and the intrapellet diffusion 
will reduce the overall reaction rate. This usually occurs for active catalyst or when using 
the large pellet of low porosity.

MECHANISM OF MASS TRANSFER IN POROUS MEDIA
Depending on the pellet pore size, different mechanisms of mass transfer can be observed, 
such as ordinary bulk diffusion, Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion (Froment et al. 
2011, p. 172). For very large pores, the bulk flow should be taken into account. When 
the pore diameter is much larger than the mean free path of the diffusing molecule, the 
molecules are transported by ordinary bulk diffusion. The Knudsen diffusion is responsible 
for the mass transfer when the molecule mean free path is larger than the pore diameter. 
The surface diffusion is a dominant mechanism of mass transfer in the microporous pellet 
with pore diameter close to the size of diffusing molecule.
We can estimate the diffusion coefficient for a binary gas system at given temperature T 
using the Chapman-Enskog formula (Bird et al. 2002, p. 526):

MECHANISM OF HEAT TRANSFER IN POROUS MEDIA
The effective thermal conductivity of a porous pellet depends in a complex manner on 
the geometry of porous space, and thermal conductivities of solid and fluid phases. The 
two limiting cases could be considered when the heat conduction in both phases occurs in 
parallel or in series. If the conduction in the solid and fluid phases takes place in parallel, the 
maximum value of effective conductivity could be achieved, because the effective conductivity 
is given as the weighted arithmetic mean of the phase conductivities:

where

If the conduction proceeds in such a way that all heat passes through the solid phase and 
then through the fluid phase in series, the minimum value of effective conductivity is 
obtained.

shape. We use Fick’s law to relate the diffusive flux of reactant A to the concentration 
gradient in the radial direction of the pellet under the assumption of dilute gas mixture:

We can perform a steady-state mass balance for species A over a spherical shell of thickness

COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND SIMULATION RESULTS
Notebook FirstOrder_Isothermal_Concentration.ipynb
The IPython notebook FirstOrder_Isothermal_Concentration.ipynb is a Python code to calculate 
the dimensionless reactant concentration profiles in the radial direction of isothermal spherical 
pellet for the first-order reaction. The reactant concentration is fixed at the external surface 
of the catalyst pellet.
◊◊Import packages.
We will use the Python library NumPy for vector manipulations and calculation of sinh 
function. To plot the results of numerical simulations, we will use the pyplot module from 
matplotlib library. The IPython.html module is called to display widgets for interactive 
input of Thiele moduli.

First-order Reaction in Isothermal Catalyst Pellet
Figure 2.4: The widget to plot the effectiveness factor for the first-order 
reaction with external mass transfer limitations in isothermal pellet.
Figure 2.5 illustrates the effect of Thiele modulus on the reactant concentration distribution 
in the radial direction of the isothermal pellet for the first-order reaction. These distributions 
were calculated by using the FirstOrder_Isothermal_Concentration_print.ipynb notebook. At 
low values of Thiele modulus, the reactant is nearly uniformly distributed within the pellet 
since the reactant consumption rate by reaction is slower than the delivery rate by diffusion. 
At high values of Thiele modulus, the reactant is depleted close to the pellet outer surface 
due to the high reaction rate. As a result, the reactant concentration distribution within 
the pellet is highly non-uniform.

First-order Reaction in Isothermal Catalyst Pellet
The effect of Thiele modulus on effectiveness factor is illustrated in Fig. 2.6. This figure was 
calculated and plotted by using the FirstOrder_Isothermal_Effectiveness_print.ipynb notebook. 
The effectiveness factor approaches unity at low values of Thiele modulus (

I  ) indicating 
the complete utilization of internal catalyst volume. However, the effectiveness factor decreases 
rapidly at high values of Thiele modulus. This is an indication on non-effective utilization 
of catalyst volume as the reaction is taking place only near the outer pellet surface.
Figure 2.6: Effectiveness factor for the first-order reaction in isothermal 
catalyst pellet.
The effect of external mass transfer resistance on the reactant concentration distribution in 
the pellet is shown in Fig. 2.7. We used the FirstOrder_Isothermal_ExternalMassTransfer_
Concentration_print.ipynb notebook to calculate and plot this figure. At high values of Biot 
number, the rate of mass transfer of reactant from the bulk phase to the external pellet 
surface is high, and the reactant concentration near the pellet surface is close to the bulk 
concentration. At low values of Biot number, the surface concentration is significantly lower 
than the bulk one. For example, the dimensionless reactant concentration is equal to 0.44 
at 

U   for 

P
%L  
 and 

I  . The reactant concentration profile is more uniform for low 
Biot number than that for high 
P
%L  due to the higher diffusion rate in the pellet.

The relationships between the effectiveness factor and Thiele modulus are shown in Fig. 2.8 
for various values of Biot number. This figure was calculated and plotted utilizing the 
FirstOrder_Isothermal_ExternalMassTransfer_Effectiveness_print.ipynb notebook. The limiting 
value of Thiele modulus corresponding to

with decreasing the Biot number to result in the narrow range of operation with full 
utilization of catalyst volume.

(3.6)
We use the orthogonal collocation method (Villadsen & Michelsen 1978) for the numerical 
solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equation, Eq. (3.6), with boundary conditions 
Eqs. (3.2)–(3.4). We select N+1 interpolation points in such a way that the first 1  points 
are the interior collocation points and the N+1 point is the boundary point at 


[
  . The 
interior points are chosen as roots of the Jacobi collocation polynomial 
 

D E  with 

D   
and 

E  
. The unknown variable c is expanded in a set of Jacobi polynomials in terms of 
even powers of U  as (Finlayson 1980):

function defined by Eq. (3.7) satisfy the boundary condition by Eq. (3.2). The spatial

M

of the concentration:

Here, the non-diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix are constant and only the diagonal 
entries depend on

◊◊Import packages. 
We will use the Python library NumPy for vector manipulations and matrix formation. 
The js_roots module from the scipy.special.orthogonal library is used to calculate the roots 
of Jacobi polynomial. The solve and norm modules from the SciPy library are utilized to 
solve the dense system of linear equations and to find the vector norm. To plot the results 
of numerical simulations, we will use the matplotlib library. The IPython.html module is 
called to display widgets for interactive input of Thiele modulus. The orthogonal_collocation 
library is used to calculate the collocation matrices and interpolate the solution.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

◊◊Import packages.
We will use the Python library NumPy for vector manipulations and formation of diagonal 
matrices. The sparse module from the library SciPy is called to generate a sparse matrix 
and convert it to various formats as well as to compute the norm of a vector. The spsolve 
module from the SciPy library is utilized to solve the sparse linear system. The exponential 
function is calculated using the exp function from the math module. To plot the results 
of numerical simulations we will use the matplotlib library. The IPython.html module is 
called to display widgets for interactive input of parameter values.

Table 1. Basic parameter values used for simulation
The reactant concentration and temperature profiles in the radial direction of agglomerate 
are shown in Fig. 4.3 for various values of Thiele modulus. These profiles were simulated 
using the FirstOrder_Nonisothermal_thiele.ipynb notebook. The reactant concentration and 
temperature are uniformly distributed in the pellet at low value of Thiele modulus due 
to the high diffusion rate of reactant as compared to the reaction rate. At high Thiele 
modulus, the reactant is consumed in a short distance from the outer pellet surface and its 
concentration drops to almost zero at the pellet surface. The pellet temperature increases 
with Thiele modulus and the temperature at the pellet center is 50% more than the bulk 
temperature at

The effect of energy generation function on the temperature radial profile in the pellet 
is shown in Fig. 4.4. The FirstOrder_Nonisothermal_beta.ipynb notebook was used for 
simulation and plotting this figure. At high value of E , the temperature at the pellet center 
becomes significantly higher than that at the surface due to the low rate of heat transfer 
by conduction in the pellet.

Figure 4.5 shows the concentration profiles in the pellet calculated for various values of 
Arrhenius number using the FirstOrder_Nonisotherma_gamma.ipynb notebook. At high 
value of J , even a small increase in temperature in the pellet as compared to the bulk 
temperature results in significant gain in the reaction rate because the rate constant increases 
exponentially with J  by Eq. (4.6).Thus, the concentration profile at 

J  
 is considerably 
steeper than that at 

J  .

first-order reaction in non-isothermal pellet.
The effect of Biot number for mass transfer on reactant distribution in the pellet is illustrated 
in Fig. 4.6. These profiles were calculated using the FirstOrder_Nonisothermal_Bim.ipynb 
notebook. The reactant is uniformly distributed in the pellet at the small value of 
P
%L  
because of the high diffusion rate in the pellet. However, the reactant concentration near 
the pellet surface is significantly lower than that in the bulk due to the low rate of external 
mass transfer from the bulk to the pellet surface.

Enzyme catalyzed reaction in isothermal pellet 
5.1	
DERIVATION OF MASS BALANCE EQUATION
We will consider an enzyme catalyzed reaction in a spherical pellet. The reaction proceeds 
through a fast reversible formation of an enzyme-substrate complex ES from an enzyme E 
and a substrate S, and a slow dissociation of the complex yielding a product P (Shuler & 
Kargi 2002):

COMPUTER PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND 
NUMERICAL RESULTS
Notebook Enzyme_Concentration.ipynb 
◊◊Import packages.
We will use the Python library NumPy for vector manipulations and formation of diagonal 
matrices. The sparse module from the library SciPy is called to generate a sparse matrix 
and convert it to various formats as well as to compute the vector norm. The spsolve 
module from the SciPy library is utilized to solve the sparse linear system and the trapz 
module to integrate function using the composite trapezoidal rule. To plot the results 
of numerical simulations, we will use the matplotlib library. The IPython.html module is 
called to display the widgets for interactive input of parameter values.

NON-CATALYTIC CHEMICAL REACTION IN 
AGGLOMERATE OF FINE PARTICLES
6.1	
DERIVATION OF MATHEMATICAL MODEL EQUATIONS
We will consider the chemical reaction in a porous agglomerate made of primary fine particles. 
The gaseous reactant diffuses from the bulk phase to the outer agglomerate surface and then from 
the surface to the agglomerate center. The reaction takes place on the surface of primary particles. 
The chemical vapor deposition (Golman & Shinohara 2000) and chemical vapor infiltration  
(Xu & Yan 2010) are examples of such reactions. The mechanism of these processes is quite 
complex. It is assumed that the reactant species react in the gas phase generating the gaseous 
precursors. Then, these precursors nucleate and grow to form the deposit on the surface of 
primary particles. The amount of deposit increases with the reaction time, resulting in a 
decrease of pore space among primary particles. Another example of non-catalytic reaction 
is the sulfation of lime, which is used to control the sulfur emissions in the fluidized bed 
combustion of coal (Jeong et al. 2015). At high temperatures, the limestone calcines to 
form lime that reacts with sulfur dioxide released by the coal. The solid reaction product, 
calcium sulfate, deposits in the porous CaO particles. As the molar volume of calcium 
sulfate is larger than that of calcium oxide, the pore space in the CaO particles is gradually 
filled with calcium sulfate. 
Therefore, we have to take into account both the temporal and spatial variations of effective 
transport properties in the radial direction of the agglomerate in deriving the mathematical 
model. These variations should be related to the changes in agglomerate structural properties, 
such as voidage and specific surface area, which in turn should be connected to the rate of 
the reaction front advancing on the surface of primary particles.
Here, we will derive the mathematical model for the chemical vapor deposition reaction in 
the agglomerate of fine particles. We assume that the gas-phase reaction is in steady-state 
at all times. We also neglect the temperature gradient in the agglomerate.
We first write the mass balance equation of i gaseous species in the spherical agglomerate as:

We will use the modified random overlapping grain model, previously developed by the 
author (Golman & Shinohara 1998), to describe the evolution of porous structure of the 
agglomerate as the reaction progresses. The agglomerate prior to reaction is represented as a 
population of randomly distributed grains of initially uniform size. As the reaction proceeds, 
the solid product deposits on the surfaces of the grains and the grains begin to grow.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE USING THE METHOD OF LINES
The mass balance equations for the agglomerate consist of a system of the second-order 
ODEs of the boundary value type for the radial distribution of gas precursor by Eq. (6.11) 
and the first-order ODE for the rate of growth of reaction interface on the primary particles 
due to the solid deposition by Eq. (6.12).
We will use the orthogonal collocation method for the solution of second-order differential 
Eq. (6.11) for the agglomerate. Using the transformation

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Notebook AgglomerateCVD.ipynb
◊◊Import packages.
We will use the Python library NumPy for vector manipulations, calculation of exponential 
function, taking roots, etc. The ode module from the library SciPy is called to solve the 
system of ordinary differential equations and the js_roots module is used to find the 
roots of orthogonal polynomials. The solve module from the SciPy library is utilized to 
solve the dense linear system and the InterpolatedUnivariateSpline module is applied to 
interpolate the solid concentration profile in the radial direction of the agglomerate. To 
calculate the collocation matrices, we use the module oc from the orthogonal_collocation 
library. To plot the results of numerical simulations, we will use the pyplot module from 
the matplotlib library. The IPython.html module is called to display widgets for interactive 
input of parameter values.

NON-CATALYTIC CHEMICAL REACTION IN 
AGGLOMERATE OF FINE PARTICLES
Figure 6.2 illustrates the evolution of gas reactant and solid deposit concentration 
profiles in the agglomerate with reaction time. These profiles were calculated using the 
AgglomerateCVD_time. ipynb notebook. As the reaction proceeds, the gaseous reactant gets 
more non-uniformly distributed in the radial direction of the agglomerate (Fig. 6.2 (a)). 
The preferable growth of solid deposit (Fig. 6.2 (b)) results in a significant decrease in its 
voidage (Fig. 6.3 (a)) near the outer agglomerate surface at 

U  . Thus, greater mass transfer 
limitations in the agglomerate prevent gaseous reactant to reach the area close to the center. 
The internal surface area available for reaction also decreases with reaction time, yielding 
a decline of reaction rate (Fig. 6.3 (b)). This should result in a more uniform distribution 
of solid product in the agglomerate. However, the local surface area at the radial position 
near the agglomerate center is significantly larger than that close to the agglomerate surface. 
The increasing diffusional resistance and non-uniformity of surface area distribution lead 
to the non-uniform solid distribution in the agglomerate with long reaction time in spite 
of decrease in reaction rate.

Figure 6.4: Effect of Thiele modulus on (a) gas reactant and (b) solid deposit concentration profiles in the 
agglomerate.
The influence of reaction temperature on the solid deposit profile shown in Fig. 6.5 was 
calculated using the AgglomerateCVD_temperature.ipynb notebook. Increasing the reaction 
temperature results in an enhancement of both reaction and diffusion rates. However, the 
reaction rate increases significantly with reaction temperature according to the Arrhenius 
dependence by Eq. (6.7), whereas the temperature dependence of diffusion rate is much 
weaker as the ordinary diffusion coefficient is proportional to 


 (Eq. (1.1)) and the 
Knudsen diffusivity to

 (Eq. (1.5)). As a result, the solid product deposited at 900oC 
is non-uniformly distributed in the agglomerate, but the product deposited at 700oC is 
almost uniformly distributed.

The concentration profiles of solid product in the agglomerates of various initial voidages are 
shown in Fig. 6.6. These profiles were calculated using the AgglomerateCVD_voidage.ipynb 
notebook. The solid product becomes uniformly distributed in the agglomerate of large initial 
voidage due to the low resistance to the transport of gaseous product in the agglomerate. 
The diffusion coefficient is the strong function of dimensionless voidage,

The effect of agglomerate size on the solid deposit profile is illustrated in Fig. 6.7. The

The effects of initial size of primary particles on the solid deposit profiles is shown in Fig. 6.8. 
These profiles were calculated using the AgglomerateCVD_ParticleSize.ipynb notebook. The 
agglomerates made of large size primary particles have the small initial surface area and pores 
of large sizes by Eq. (1.6). These will lead to the lower reaction rate and higher Knudsen 
diffusivity and, as a result, to the more uniform distribution of solid deposit.

SUMMARY
In the previous chapters we mainly discussed chemical reactions and the heat and mass 
transport processes in the catalyst pellet. The basic mathematical models and numerical or 
analytical methods to solve these model equations have been also introduced together with 
the computer programs used for simulating and plotting the concentration and temperature 
profiles in the pellets. We also covered the first- and second-order catalytic, enzyme catalyzed 
and non-catalytic reactions in the isothermal and non-isothermal pellets in this textbook. 
Readers are advised to refer to the books by Aris (1975) and Kafarow (1993) for further 
exploration of complex phenomena involving simultaneous coupled heat and mass transfer 
with chemical reaction in the pellet. The pellet models comprise an essential part of the 
overall reactor models, which will be discussed in the Part II of this book series.

Appendix A1. Installing IPython
APPENDIX A1. INSTALLING IPYTHON
There are many different ways of installing IPython (Péreza & Granger 2007). We recommend 
installing the Anaconda distribution by Continuum Analytics. This distribution contains a 
full Python set for scientific and engineering computation and data visualization including 
NumPy, Scipy (Jones et al. 2001) and Matplotlib (Hunter 2007). Anaconda is an open source 
platform and it can be installed using a free and easy to use installer. The installer is available at  
https://www.continuum.io/downloads. The notebooks described in this book were created 
using Python 3.4. You might also want to install a pandoc package available at http://pandoc.
org. This is a universal document converter and it is used by nbconvert tool (https://ipython.
org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbconvert.html) to convert IPython notebook to html, pdf, 
LATEX and other formats.
We can start Anaconda using a launcher for IPython Notebook (IPython (Py 3.4) Notebook) 
in the start menu on Windows computer. This launcher will open a local web server and 
we will interact with IPython using a web browser, as shown in Fig. A1.1.

We can create a new file or open an existing one, as illustrated in Fig. A1.2. The notebook 
files are located in the directory in which Anaconda was installed, i.e. c:/users/boris. We have 
created a folder named ‘book’ with subfolder ‘appendix’ in this directory and saved there a 
newly created notebook ‘Untitled    ’.

APPENDIX A2. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF 
PYTHON LANGUAGE
The Python syntax is briefly summarized below.
•	 Indentation is used to indicate the block of statements.
•	 The line break specifies the statement termination. Statements are usually one 
line long, but some statements could be located on the same line and separated 
by a semicolon.
•	 The comment starts from # symbol. 
•	 The arithmetic operator ** indicates power.
•	 Decision making.
The syntax of condition statement is as follows:
if <condition>:
<then statements>
else:
<else statements>
next statement
The following condition logical operator are defined: < less than, > greater than, <= less 
than or equal, >= greater than or equal, == equal to, != not equal to. 
•	 For loop.
For loop is used to repeat execution of a piece of code.
The syntax of loop statement is as follows:
for <variable> in range (start, stop, step):
<body of for loop>
In the example below, the start value is equal to 1, the stop value is 6 and the step is 2.

Appendix A2. Brief Overview of Python Language
If the start value is not defined, it is assumed to be zero. If the step value is not given it is 
presumed to be one. Therefore, the loop below will be executed 3 times starting from i = 0.
•	 The vector can be created using the numpy array functions. 
For example, a = np.zeros (n) is the statement to create a null vector a with n elements.
The following code creates the array a with 3 elements and prints it out.

Below we specify the two-dimensional array b of size  
u  and print out all array elements. 
We can use slicing to generate the desired view of the array. The following statements slice 
the second column and the first row of two-dimensional array defined above.

•	 Function
A function is a piece of code to perform a task. The function is defined with a keyword 
def followed by the function name and the list of arguments in parenthesis. The final 
statement is a return statement with the list of expressions in parenthesis. We can initialize 
the function calculation by calling it.
For further information on Python language, the reader is advised to consult numerous 
online recourses and books such as a comprehensive book by Langtangen (2012).
