Soft Link and Hard Links 
 
Example: 
Create two files: 
$ touch blah1    
$ touch blah2 
 
Enter some data into them: 
 
$ echo "Cat" > blah1 
$ echo "Dog" > blah2 
 
And as expected: 
 
$cat blah1; cat blah2 
Cat 
Dog 
 
Let's create hard and soft links: 
 
$ ln blah1 blah1-hard 
$ ln -s blah2 blah2-soft 
 
Let's see what just happened: 
 
$ ls -l 
 
blah1 
blah1-hard 
blah2 
blah2-soft -> blah2 
 
Changing the name of blah1 does not matter: 
 
$ mv blah1 blah1-new 
$ cat blah1-hard 
Cat 
 
blah1-hard points to the inode, the contents, of the file - that wasn't changed. 
 
$ mv blah2 blah2-new 
$ ls blah2-soft 
blah2-soft 
$ cat blah2-soft   

cat: blah2-soft: No such file or directory 
 
The contents of the file could not be found because the soft link points to the name, that was changed, 
and not to the contents. 
Similarly, If blah1 is deleted, blah1-hard still holds the contents; if blah2 is deleted, blah2-soft is just a link 
to a non-existing file.
