MARGARET 
A. BODEN, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man, New York: Basic Books, 
1977. xiii + 537 pp. $17.50. 
This is an introductory survey of the artificial intelligence (AI) research program, 
presupposing no technical knowledge of computers, psychology or philosophy, but 
leading the reader to a fairly advanced and sophisticated understanding of the goals, 
assumptions and results in the field to date. Boden's execution of this modest but 
far from trivial task has all the virtues appropriate to it. It is accurate, compendious, 
clear, unbiased, and very well organized. Moving back and forth between quite detailed 
analyses of program features and general surveys and characterizations, Boden provides 
an account of virtually every program, researcher, and issue to have been deemed 
important in this young field. From McCarthy's LISP and Newell, Simon and Shaw's 
GPS to Minsky, Colby, Schank, Winograd, Marr and a host of other very recent 
work, Boden explains the aspirations and methods and describes the performance 
strengths and weaknesses. All the questions that puzzle outsiders get at least introductory 
and often quite insightful discussion: what is the relation between languages like LISP 
and machine code, what is the procedural/declarative controversy, the analog/digital 
controversy, what is a push-down stack, heuristic program, compiler, interpreter, demon 
or garbage collector? 
Boden has taken extraordinary pains to make the book pedagogically effective. 
At its best, this effort yields fine results. For instance, Boden wisely begins by leading 
the reader step by step in great detail through a relatively simple but flashy program 
of Colby's. Only considerations of pedagogical strategy could justify focussing on 
this program, which is not important conceptually as psychology or computer science 
(and certainly not as philosophy), but the detail presented there is then put to very 
good use, and built upon, throughout the book, so that by Chapter 12 Boden has 
demythologized the field and can wield the jargon with the well justified expectation 
that her readers can not only get the gist of what she is saying, but know with some 
precision what the issues are and are not. Similarly, Boden introduces the work on 
natural language comprehension before turning to the work on vision, with the side 
benefit of being able to rely on distinctions-e.g., 
between syntax and semantics 
as AI people understand it-that 
otherwise would have at best a forced and confusing 
application to the problems encountered in the vision work. At its worst, Boden's 
pedagogy turns gimmicky and cute, and one gets the impression that not only has 
she set out to write a book that any bright twelve-year-old can understand (and probably 
succeeded) but forgotten that such twelve-year-olds will not be the book's primary 
audience. 
The book is deliberately simple, not only in exposition, but in aspiration. Boden 
does not attempt to provide a deep view of the field, but the deep views currently 
available are all controversial at best, and treacherous reading for the neophyte. The 
evenhandedness with which Boden discusses the various heroes and ogres of this 
remarkably cliquish field will enrage many knowing readers, who will be ready to 
dismiss any author who takes those charlatans X or Y or Z seriously, but on close 
reading Boden can be seen to meet out criticism judiciously, point to more weaknesses 
than the more strident critics have noticed, and give the various devils their due. 
She is not quite neutral about the importance of AI-she 
chose to write the book-but 
not a mere enthusiast either. Her discussion of Dreyfus' criticisms, for instance, while 
somewhat superficial, is calm, fair, and touches on all the essential points with clarity. 
In the concluding chapters on psychological, philosophical and social implications of 
the field, she not only dutifully catalogues and assesses the dangers and shortcomings 
that other critics have noted, but adds some valuable caveats of her own. A curious 
effect of her sympathetic portrayal of the field might well be that she ends up doing 
more to damage the reputation of AI than any of the critics-by 
so obviously doing

justice to it. One is struck in the end by how uninspiring many of the most heralded 
"results" are, and when one reflects on many of the lesser products Boden describes, 
one is apt to conclude that people in AI have a low threshold for being impressed. 
Boden is a philosopher, but there is very little explicit philosophical discussion, 
and few philosophical claims of any moment. The exposition is philosophically sound, 
however, in a way one seldom encounters in such books when they are written by 
non-philosophers. At times the philosophical reticence is tantalizing. Boden reveals-but 
does not discuss or analyze in depth-the 
vertigo of interpretation that seems always 
to accompany the juxtaposition of mentalistic and mechanistic descriptions of programs. 
That is, she is very good at portraying the essential blindness of programs, and while 
she gives the reader grounds for drawing the conclusion that this blindness is not 
only compatible with mentalistic interpretation but the sine qua non of an explanatory 
psychological theory (even a theory of sight-especially 
a theory of sight), she does 
not develop these ideas to the point where they confront one's residual suspicions. 
"They must be leaving something out" is the leitmotif of most skepticism towards 
AI, and she does not address it aggressively. 
A concluding, central claim of Boden's is that AI, far from "dehumanizing" psychology 
and threatening man's self-image, is a profound enemy of those tendencies in current 
thinking, and in this I concur. Nothing has more dramatically demonstrated the poverty 
of behaviorism and other relatively simple-minded mechanistic visions of psychology 
than the complexity of AI's clearly inadequate models. Psychology, if it is possible 
at all, will eventually show us that our minds are structures of staggering complexity 
but also elegance. AI may not lead us to that psychological theory, but no other 
approach currently holds out better hope. Daniel C. Dennett, Tufts University

S. KUHN. The Essential Tension Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 
1977. xxiii + 351 pp. $18.50. 
This book contains sixteen essays and a rather extensive preface. The essays are 
divided into two groups: historiographic and metahistorical studies. Of the sixteen 
essays, only two have not been previously published, and the book "is very nearly 
a version in the original English bf the German volume published under the supervision 
of" Lorenz Kruger (i). [Die Entstehung des Neuen: Studien zur Struktur der Wissen- 
schaftsgeschichte (Frankfurt, 1977).] 
The foremost and almost entire significance of this book is historical. Almost 
all of the essays have already been published, and the two unpublished essays, "The 
Relations between the History and Philosophy of Science" and "Objectivity, Value 
Judgment, and Theory Choice" were written in 1968 and 1973 respectively, albeit 
the former was revised in 1976. In addition, only the latter of these two unpublished 
essays is of current philosophical interest-even 
Kuhn admits that the former is mostly 
outdated. Although the overall value of the book would have been enhanced with 
the addition of several more unpublished and current essays, the fact that the work 
is almost entirely of historical interest does not make it unworthwhile. Kuhn, himself, 
warrants historical study; he, more than anyone else has been responsible for the 
general shift among contemporary philosophers of science in thinking that history 
of science is both relevant and central to their work in philosophy of science. 
The lengthy preface is Kuhn on Kuhn, and is one of the most interesting sections 
of the book. Some of the more important historical points raised by Kuhn about 
the development of his view of science are as follows: 
1. Kuhn actually came upon his view that scientific growth and change involves 
conceptual revolutions through reflecting upon the personal difficulties he faced in 
his initial encounter with the history of science. In 1947 when Kuhn was preparing 
a set of lectures on the origin of 17th century mechanics, he was having a difficult 
time understanding Aristotelean physics-at 
least in a manner such that Aristotle could 
justice to it. One is struck in the end by how uninspiring many of the most heralded 
"results" are, and when one reflects on many of the lesser products Boden describes, 
one is apt to conclude that people in AI have a low threshold for being impressed.
