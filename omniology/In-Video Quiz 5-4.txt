The Respiratory System â€“ 4 , Pulmonary function tests and alveolar ventilation
1. In which of the following ways does the pulmonary function test of a patient 
with an obstructive lung disease differ from a normal individual?
 
A. forced vital capacity decreases
 
B. forced vital capacity increases
 
C. forced expiratory volume in 1 second decreases
 
D. forced expiratory volume in 1 second increases
2. Which of the following breathing patterns will provide the greatest alveolar 
ventilation?
 
A. tidal volume: 600, frequency: 10, dead space: 150
 
B. tidal volume: 750, frequency: 10, dead space: 150
 
C. tidal volume: 600, frequency: 10, dead space:  300
 
D. tidal volume: 750, frequency: 10, dead space:  300
Correct Answer 1: C. forced expiratory volume in 1 second decreases
Correct Answer 2: B. tidal volume: 750, frequency: 10, dead space: 150
