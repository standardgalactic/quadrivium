Foreword
Two years ago, we launched Salesforce Lightning. It was (and if I’m being honest, still is) 
an audacious undertaking.
Our mission with Lightning was to completely reinvent Salesforce to provide a new 
modern user experience that set a new standard for customer relationship management 
(CRM) and build it all on a new, robust, and scalable enterprise application framework. 
We wanted to make Salesforce easier, more intuitive, and virtually limitless in its 
potential. And we wanted it to empower everyone in our community to be their best, 
including trailblazers, admins, customers, partners, and our employees.
Since launching Lightning, we’ve seen an outpouring of enthusiasm from  
our community, unlike anything I’ve ever seen in enterprise software. It’s been  
awe-­inspiring.
One of the best things about Lightning is that it helps us innovate faster. With each 
release, we’re expanding the scale and scope of Lightning and doing more than I ever 
thought possible.
Since launching it just two years ago, we’ve done the following:
•	
Redefined the modern selling cycle with Sales Cloud Lightning
•	
Reimagined the modern contact center with Service Cloud Lightning
•	
Streamlined navigation to make it easier to move between Salesforce 
apps
•	
Empowered admins and trailblazers with a no-code framework so 
they can easily customize the Salesforce user interface (UI) for their 
organizations
•	
Helped more than 100,000 customers deploy Lightning
•	
Sparked a new level of creativity and momentum in our ecosystem 
with more than 1,000 new Lightning-ready apps from partners 
such as DocuSign, Evernote, and FinancialForce that can be simply 
dragged and dropped into Salesforce

xiv
•	
Created entirely new products that previously weren’t possible, such 
as Salesforce Einstein, an artificial intelligence (AI) offering for CRM, 
and Lightning Bolt, which offers industry-specific portals for our 
Community Cloud
•	
Empowered countless salespeople, service agents, and marketing 
pros to sell, service, and market faster, smarter, and the way they want
Every day our community gives us feedback—sometimes positive, sometimes 
critical, but always constructive. And every day, our entire product team (me included) 
pores over that feedback, and it helps us get better and better. Lightning is what it 
is today because of you. So, thank you for all you do to help us make Salesforce and 
Lightning better and better with each release.
Lightning is the future of Salesforce. So, buckle up because we’re just getting started.

EVP of CRM apps, Salesforce

Introduction
“Do business faster.”
—Cloud Creations
Just like our company tagline, we believe you can “do business faster” with Salesforce 
Lightning. We wrote this book to provide training on the innovative Lightning

we understood the challenges that other organizations faced when it came to user 
acceptance of a new experience. We wanted to provide material that was easy to follow, 
with real-life examples, so administrators and users are set up for success.
Learn Salesforce Lightning is a step-by-step visual guide that offers immediate and 
valuable solutions to the new set of UI tools included in Lightning.
You’ll learn to do the following:
•	
Navigate the Salesforce Lightning Experience
•	
Migrate from Salesforce Classic to Lightning
•	
Make customizations
•	
Configure dynamic reports and dashboards
•	
Build logic to automate the system with Process Builder
•	
Manage your data and security
•	
And much more
This book is for Salesforce administrators, business users, developers, and IT 
members. Our goal is to prepare you to onboard one of the most innovative and fastest 
customer relationship management (CRMs) solutions on the market: Salesforce 
Lightning.

CHAPTER 1
Introducing Salesforce 
Lightning
Salesforce is currently the number-one customer relationship management (CRM) 
solution for business management. Delivering a robust platform and groundbreaking 
technology, Salesforce provides solutions for sales, service, and marketing departments. 
The Lightning Experience provides a new user interface that delivers a faster platform, 
dynamic capabilities, and enhanced aesthetics. Businesses have reported an increase in 
win rates, more collaboration, improved productivity, and faster reporting following the 
switch to Lightning (see Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1.  Salesforce Lightning Experience

2
Lightning Pages
The Lightning pages focus attention on what matters most. Important information is 
displayed “above the fold,” or positioned at the top half of the screen, so users can view 
key points quicker.
Additionally, layouts are consistent and easy to navigate. See the comparison of an 
account record in Classic (see Figure 1-2) versus the same record in Lightning (Figure 1-­3).
Figure 1-2.  Salesforce account record in Salesforce Classic
Figure 1-3.  Salesforce account record in the Lightning Experience
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

Migrate to Lightning Experience
Migrating to the Salesforce Lightning Experience is straightforward. The following steps 
describe how to access the Migration Assistant. The Migration Assistant will check your 
organization’s readiness for Lightning and walk you through a series of steps to enable 
Lightning for your organization. This is a great first step on your Lightning journey.
Note  These steps are not required but highly encouraged. Salesforce has spent 
considerable time thinking through potential migration pitfalls and has tried to 
address them within the Migration Assistant.
Migration Assistant
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In Classic, select Setup (see Figure 1-4).
Figure 1-4.  Setup area in Salesforce Classic
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

4
	 2.	 From the Setup menu, click the Get Started button (see Figure ­1-­5).
Figure 1-5.  Get Started button in Setup
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

5
	 3.	 From here, you have three available resources to learn more about the 
Lightning Experience. You can select from the options in Figure 1-6.
	 4.	 Click Next Step to get started.
Figure 1-6.  Learning resources for Salesforce Lightning
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

6
Check Readiness 
To get started, Salesforce will request access to your organization to analyze your current 
setup (Figure 1-7).
Figure 1-7.  Allowing access to Lightning Readiness
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

7
Once you click Allow, shown in Figure 1-7, you must select which Salesforce product 
you want to access (see Figure 1-8).
Figure 1-8.  Product selection to check for Lightning Readiness
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

8
Preview
You can preview how your organization works in the Lightning environment. This is a 
great feature to test any issues that may have been brought up in your readiness report. If 
you encounter any issues in this switch, you can make changes on the spot. To test this, 
navigate to the Preview tab and click Preview, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Select the appropriate Salesforce product and click Check Readiness. Salesforce 
will analyze your current setup and email a readiness report (see Figure 1-9). New 
organizations can skip this step.

As you can see in Figure 1-11, you are instantly switched to Lightning in Preview mode.

Optimize with Features
For the complete experience of Lightning, take a look at some of the new features made 
available. This includes a new feature for news, options to enable activities and notes, 
and more. Navigate to this tab, and click Optimize with Features to enable/disable the 
Lightning features found in Figure 1-12.
You can enable the following options:
•	
Click Set Up My Domain to create a URL that is reflective of your company’s 
brand. This will add a subdomain to your Salesforce organization URL. Use 
this feature to increase the login and authentication process.
•	
Click Set Up Shared Activities to allow users to relate multiple contacts 
to an individual activity.
•	
Enable News to display relevant news article about your accounts and their 
industries. This information is pulled by accounts listed in your organization.
Figure 1-12.  Lightning features to enable
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

11
•	
Enable Social Accounts, Contacts, and Leads to allow users to 
connect better with your accounts by syncing social media accounts.
•	
Enable Notes to utilize the enhanced version of notes that includes 
automatic saving in edit mode, an option to add images, and share features.
Set Up Users
You can control who has access to the Lightning Experience. You can choose to roll this 
out to groups of users, individual users, or all users.
Note  Standard profile users have access to Lightning by default, while custom 
profile users do not. Click Learn How to change these settings.
Navigate to the Set up Users tab shown in Figure 1-13 to fine-tune this experience 
and select which users make the switch.
Figure 1-13.  User setup
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

12
Follow these steps to switch users:
	 1.	 Click Switch Users.
	 2.	 Select appropriate users by clicking the + next to their name 
(Figure 1-14).
	 3.	 Click Save.
Figure 1-14.  Selecting users to migrate to Lightning
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

13
Rollout Approach 
Execute a rollout strategy that works best for your company. For larger organizations, it is 
recommended that you have a phased rollout approach. This approach is advantageous 
when migrating large organizations and complex setups. There are a few benefits to this 
approach, including the following:
•	
This approach allows you to conduct user acceptance testing. Use 
this to identify any challenges or issues with the new experience. You 
can collect feedback from your users and fine-tune changes before 
executing to the entire organization.
•	
Make progress on your implementation by breaking this up into 
pieces. This ensures that progress is being made while staying on top 
of new features and changes.
The suggested rollout approach starts with new users, a pilot group of users, and 
lastly all users.
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

14
Turn It On
Hurray! The final step! Once your organization is ready to make the move to Lightning, 
select the Turn It On tab shown in Figure 1-15. Switch the tab to Enabled to finish.
Note  With the right permissions, users have the option to toggle between Classic 
and the Lightning Experience. From the Classic interface, select your username 
and click Switch to Lightning Experience, as shown in Figure 1-16. From the 
Lightning Experience, click Switch to Classic, as shown in Figure 1-17.

Lightning Home Page
The Lightning Experience home page is enhanced with new features. The home 
page can be tailored to give your users everything they need to manage their day in 
one centralized place. Without any configuration, Salesforce displays the following 
components: Quarterly Performance, Assistant, News, Today’s Tasks, Today’s Events, 
Recent Records, and Top Deals. See Figures 1-18 and 1-19.
Figure 1-18.  Top half of the Lightning home page
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

17
Navigation Bar 
The navigation bar uses tabs to hold objects, as shown in Figure 1-20. In database terms, 
an object is a table. Objects hold groupings of information that may be related. This 
includes the records that live in them. Records are considered the rows that you find 
within a table. You will hear this terminology referenced throughout this book. For more 
information on objects, records, and fields, navigate to Chapter X.
In Lightning, each tab is actionable.
Figure 1-19.  Bottom half of the Lightning home page
Figure 1-20.  Navigation bar
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

18
In the navigation bar, objects are broken down into lists. These lists hold Salesforce 
records in relation to their object. One of the neat features of this is that records can be 
created directly from a tab. Each list can be used to see the object’s most recent items. 
This makes it easier for users to create new records on the fly.
Quarterly Performance 
The Quarterly Performance summary is a powerful reporting tool used to show sales 
users’ performance based on a pipeline (see Figure 1-21).
Closed records display the user’s closed opportunities.
Open (>70%) displays the sum of all records with a probability greater than 70 
percent.
If the user is part of a team, the team’s opportunity sums will be showcased on this 
report. Otherwise, the data represented will be the user’s owned opportunities.
Figure 1-21.  Quarterly Performance component located on the home page
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

19
Setting a Goal
To set a goal, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the pencil icon and enter an amount, as shown in Figure 1-22.
	 2.	 Click Save.
The chart automatically calculates and updates the chart. Click 
to refresh the 
data. Click 
to filter the data by week or day (Figure 1-23).
Now your sales users can start their day with a data visualization of their sales 
progress.
Figure 1-22.  Select the pencil icon to edit your quarterly goal
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

20
News 
This new feature is a great way to display news articles related to your accounts and 
their industries. Once enabled, as discussed in the “Enhanced Features” section, news 
information can be displayed on your home page. When news is accessed from the 
home page, information is displayed based on recently viewed records and tasks and 
events for those records. See Figure 1-23.
Figure 1-23.  News component found on the home page
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

21
Click See More News to navigate to the News tab, as shown in Figure 1-24.
This tab displays a list of news articles titled Industry News. Information populated 
here is related to your accounts and their industry.

Assistant 
Lightning Assistant is helpful in prioritizing an end user’s daily tasks. Tasks that are 
overdue are showcased first on the top right of the page (see Figure 1-25). The following 
overdue tasks are tasks that are due today.
Global Search 
The Salesforce global search bar appears at the top of every page. Use this area to search 
across any object in Salesforce. It’s best practice to search for a record before creating a 
new one to avoid duplicate data. Use wildcards and operators for greater search results.
Use an asterisk (*) to find records that match at the middle or end of your search, 
and use a question mark (?) to find records that match only one character at the 
middle or end of your search.
Figure 1-25.  Lightning Assistant
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

23
For example, a search for Ay* at the end will find and display results for a contact 
named Ayden. It will also find and display results for Andy Young (Figure 1-26).
Favorites List
The Favorites icon is a new tool in the Lightning platform. Favorites are customized 
shortcuts to records and items most frequently visited, such as favorite individual 
records, list views, dashboards, and more.

	 1.	 Click New User.
	 2.	 Fill in all the required fields marked in red. This includes Last 
Name, Alias, Email, Username, and Nickname (see Figure 1-37).
Note The email address must be in the form of a valid email address but can 
be used for multiple organizations. However, the username must be a unique 
username and in a correct email format.
For example, felicia@cloudcreations.com is a proper email format.
	 3.	 Assign the appropriate license in the User License field.
	 4.	 Assign a profile using the Profile field.
	 5.	 Select Marketing User to give the assigned user access to your 
organization’s marketing tools.
	 6.	 Select Offline User to give the assigned user offline access.

Figure 1-41.  Required fields for a new user
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

37
Deactivate a User
In Salesforce, you can’t delete a user, but you can deactivate a user to prevent them 
from logging in. Deactivating a user frees up a license that can be assigned to another 
user (see Figure 1-42). When you deactivate a user, the user is removed from all sharing 
privileges and groups.
Records owned by this user can still be transferred to an active account. These are 
the deactivation steps:
	 1.	 Navigate to the User section in Setup.
	 2.	 Select the name of the user that should be deactivated.
	 3.	 Click Edit from the user record page.
	 4.	 Deselect Active from the user profile.
	 5.	 Click Save.

Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

38
Lightning Pages
Lightning allows you to create custom pages to display and arrange key information for 
specific groups of users. You can increase adoption and user acceptance by building out 
clear and easy-to-use pages. By creating apps, you can minimize the type of information 
that is exposed to make the Salesforce organization easier to adopt. The App Builder is a 
new drag-and-drop tool to customize the interface without code (see Figure 1-43).
Follow these steps to make changes to the Lightning home page:
	 1.	 From the home page, click Edit Page (this feature can be found on 
most Lightning pages). See Figure 1-43.
Figure 1-43.  Edit Page in the Setup drop-down
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

39
	 2.	 Arrange which components you want accessible for your users to 
see. See Figure 1-44.
Figure 1-44.  Lightning App Builder
	 3.	 In the left panel, choose from the available Lightning components 
and drag and drop to the desired section on the home page. The 
right panel will request details specific to the component chosen.

40
Create a New Lightning App 
From Setup, search and select App Manager to open up the Lightning Experience App 
Manager. Click New Lightning App to create a new app (see Figure 1-45).
Figure 1-45.  Creating a new Lightning app
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

41
To create a new app, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Fill in the required fields (those marked with an asterisk).
The app name is what will appear in the navigation bar.
The developer name is the API name and must be unique across 
other apps in your organization.
	 2.	 For App Branding, upload an image such as a company logo to 
customize the page (see Figure 1-46).
Figure 1-46.  App details
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

42
	 3.	 Once you fill out the appropriate fields, click Next.

43
	 5.	 Click Next.
	 6.	 Click Add to add the utility bar (see Figure 1-48).
	 7.	 Select the items that should be displayed in the new app. The 
order of your selected items will display at the top of the page from 
left to right (see Figure 1-49).
Figure 1-48.  Steps to enable utility bar for an app
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

44
Note  It is best practice to create different apps for different groups of users. 
When creating these apps, it’s recommended that you display only the items that 
are relevant to those groups of users. It can be overwhelming and frustrating when 
there is too much unnecessary information for your users.
For example, a sales app should show only sales-related items. 
Leads, accounts, contacts, and opportunities are examples. 
For your service agents, they most likely do not need to see 
opportunities. Create an app for your service agents to see only 
service-related items such as contacts and cases.
Figure 1-49.  Adding tabs to new app
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

45
	 8.	 Click Next.
	 9.	 Select the profiles that should have access to this app (see 
Figure 1-50).

The storage usage is broken down and shows the percentage of utilization across 
the two. Information is also broken down by object, as shown in Figure 1-52. Use this 
breakdown to identify which records occupy the most space.
User Licenses
This section displays the total number of licenses available, the total used, and the 
remaining number of licenses available for each license type. This includes the standard 
Salesforce license, which is the most commonly purchased and assigned (see Figure 1-­53).
Figure 1-52.  Storage Usage breakdown
Figure 1-53.  User licenses
Chapter 1  Introducing Salesforce Lightning

48
Permission Set Licenses
Permission set licenses entitle users to access features and various tools that are not 
included in their user license. This can include a Service Cloud console user, a CRM user, 
Analytics Cloud accessibility, and more.
Feature Set Licenses
Feature set licenses include additional features on top of the standard user license. 
These can include Data.com, knowledge users, marketing users, and more.
Usage-Based Entitlements (BETA) Licenses
This feature is available for a limited amount of time for an organization. These tools can 
vary but are typically made available temporarily.

CHAPTER 2
Sales Cloud Lightning
The Sales Cloud gives sales and marketing professionals the ability to increase sales 
productivity and revenue at lightning speeds. You can see the complete customer 
journey from a prospective lead to an active customer by recording leads, accounts, 
contacts, opportunities, and campaigns. In Sales Cloud Lightning, leads are captured, 
nurtured, and seamlessly converted into active accounts or prospects. Sales leaders can 
then manage their sales pipeline with opportunity tracking to effectively close more 
deals (Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1.  New kanban feature on the Opportunities object in Sales Cloud

54
Lead Management
Across different business models, a lead in Salesforce can be an individual, organization, 
or entity. The Lead object can act as a holding bucket of all prospects stored in Salesforce. 
Leads come from a variety of sources. So, it’s a good idea to use the lead area to track 
important information about your leads, including contact information and notes.
Your leads may come from various entry points and may be a result of your 
marketing efforts. Use the Lead object to manage and nurture your leads as they are 
being worked through the qualification process. This can include leads that come from 
your web site via a Web to Lead, purchased lists, referrals, networking events, and others. 
Use this information to tell which channels your best leads come from.
For example, create a lead record for the prospect you met at your latest marketing 
event. Include important contact information about your lead, add notes, and create 
follow-up tasks to prevent leads from slipping through the cracks. Generate a report 
to see where most of your qualified leads come from. Use this information to put your 
marketing dollars in the most effective places.
Lead Conversion 
Once you qualify your lead as a firm prospect, you can convert your lead into an account, 
contact, and opportunity. When you convert a lead in Salesforce, standard lead fields 
populate the new account, contact, and opportunity records.
Business leads create a business account, business contact, and opportunity. 
Individual customers, when converted, create a persons account and opportunity.
Note  Not all business models use leads. However, lead tracking in Salesforce is 
a useful method for separating untouched leads from more promising prospects in 
the database. Identify your business process to determine the point of conversion.
Understand the Lead Page
In the Lightning Experience, the lead record contains important information about the 
lead including contact details, activity tracking, campaign history, chatter, and news.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

55
Sales leaders can work through their most qualified leads faster with the help of Lead 
Workspace toolbar. This toolbar makes it easy for reps to take their leads through the 
lead conversion process.
Figure 2-2 shows a lead record in the Lightning Experience. This page layout 
consolidates key information with a highlights panel, an activity section, and the Lead 
Workspace toolbar.
Figure 2-2.  A lead record page in the Lightning Experience
The highlights panel, shown in Figure 2-3, displays key information at the top of the 
page. By default, this includes lead salutation, first name, last name, title, company, all 
phone fields, and email. This feature makes it easier for your users to work through leads 
quickly.
Figure 2-3.  Highlights panel on a lead record
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

56
The interactive toolbar shown in Figure 2-4 is called the Lead Workspace. This area 
helps users follow a series of configurable steps in the conversion process, referred to as 
sales path. Encourage users to update the lead status as they work to qualify leads.
Figure 2-4.  Lead Workspace toolbar
Use the Activity tab, as shown in Figure 2-5, to log a call, create a new task or event, 
and send email. Create tasks to prevent your leads from slipping through the cracks. Any 
tasks that need to be completed will populate in the Next Steps area. Activities that have 
been completed are logged in the Past Activity section.
Figure 2-5.  Activity section on a lead record
Use the chatter feature on a lead record, shown in Figure 2-6, as a collaboration tool. 
Use this as your communication vehicle within Salesforce to collaborate with each other. 
Post updates, ask questions, and create polls.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

57
The Details tab shown in Figure 2-7 displays information related to the lead. This 
includes any standard and custom fields made visible to the user.
Figure 2-6.  Chatter tab on a lead record
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

58
Use the News tab shown in Figure 2-8 to find news articles related to your lead. You 
can also sync your organization with Twitter to see up-to-date Twitter feeds and related 
connections.
Figure 2-7.  Details tab on a lead record
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

59
To the far right of the page on a default lead layout, shown in Figure 2-9, you can 
identify potential duplicate records. If there are any duplicates found, that information 
will populate this section.

60
Note  The highlights panel can be rearranged to display the most important lead 
details at the top of the page. This makes it easy for end users to leverage key 
information.
Create a Lead
Follow these steps to learn how to create a new lead record from a list view:
	 1.	 Click the 
 button next to the Leads tab and click New Lead.
Alternatively, you can click New from a Lead List view to create a new 
lead (Figure 2-10).
Figure 2-10.  New button on a lead from a Lead list view
	 2.	 Type the first name of the lead on the edit page, as shown in 
Figure 2-11.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

61
	 3.	 Type the last name of the lead, which is required to save any lead 
record. Type the company name; this is the name of the business 
the lead is associated with.
Note  When converted, the first and last names will generate the contact’s first 
and last names. The company name is used to create an account record and maps 
to the Account Name field.
Last Name and Company Name are required lead fields. If data is not filled in these 
fields, the record will not be saved. It’s ideal to fill out more data on a lead record. 
You should consider adding any additional important information about your lead.
	 4.	 Click Save to save the record. Click Save and New to save the 
current record and be directed to create a new lead.
	 5.	 When a lead is created successfully, a success message will display 
at the top of the page, as shown in Figure 2-12.
Figure 2-11.  Edit page of a lead record. Fill in the appropriate lead details here.

and opportunity name
	 3.	 Fill in the appropriate details located on the Convert Lead edit 
page, as shown in Figure 2-15.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

64
	 4.	 Enter the converted status. Closed - Converted is the default 
conversion status.
Note  The lead status field captures a value that corresponds to a converted or 
unconverted status. Select the appropriate lead status. By default, Converted is the 
default status.
	 5.	 Assign the record owner. This can be assigned to any Salesforce 
user.
	 6.	 Type in the account name. You can search for an existing account 
or create a new one. If the account does not exist, click New 
Account to create a new account record directly. If the lead is an 
individual, leave the Account Name field blank.
	 7.	 To create an opportunity record while converting, type the name 
of the opportunity. Leave this field blank if an opportunity does 
not exist.
	 8.	 Click Convert and view the conversion confirmation page, as 
shown in Figure 2-16.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

65
Accounts and Contacts
An account in Salesforce can be an organization, company, or institution, while a contact 
can be an individual associated with a business.
For example, you may have an upcoming meeting with Michael Scott at Dunder 
Mifflin Paper Co. in regard to a potential opportunity about your product or services. 
Track information about Michael Scott and Dunder Mifflin Paper Co. in Salesforce. 
Create a new account and call it Dunder Mifflin Paper Co. Next, create a contact record 
for Michael Scott to relate the two.
Tip  It’s best practice to search for something before creating a new record to 
avoid duplication.
Figure 2-16.  Conversion confirmation page
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

66
Accounts
You can sort your accounts by type, status, or any other standard or custom field in 
Salesforce. Keep track of accounts that are active versus inactive, within a particular 
industry or territory, and much more.
From the Account list, you can identify key contacts, opportunities, cases, and 
related notes and attachments for an at-a-glance view.
Note  You can create roll-up summary fields at the account level to summarize 
specific metrics. For example, create a roll-up field to aggregate the total amount 
for all Closed Won opportunities. See the section “Field Types” in Chapter 1 for 
more information on roll-up fields.
Accounts and contacts have a master-detail relationship. This is a parent-­
child relationship in which the master object (Account) controls the detail object 
(Contact). See the section “Field Types” in Chapter 1 to learn more about master-detail 
relationships.
Create a New Account
Accounts can be created or imported directly into Salesforce, without having to be 
converted. Create an account record to track information at the account level, such as 
employee count, account number, web site, etc.
	 1.	 From the toolbar, click 
 next to the Account tab.
	 2.	 Click New Account.
	 3.	 Fill in all required fields marked with an asterisk, including the 
account name (Figure 2-17).
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

67
	 4.	 Click Save to save an account record. A success message will 
appear when properly saved, shown in Figure 2-18.
Figure 2-17.  Account record in edit mode
Figure 2-18.  Account success message
Contacts
Use the contact record to capture individual information, including email addresses, 
phone numbers, birth dates, and more. Use this information to boost client 
relationships. Create encrypted fields to store secure information at the contact level, for 
example, Social Security numbers and credit card information.
As mentioned earlier, accounts and contacts have a master-detail relationship. 
To create a relationship between the two, make sure to enter the account name when 
creating a contact.
Tip  Create the contact from the account record to quickly relate the two.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

68
Follow these steps to create a contact from an existing account:
	 1.	 From the account record, click the New Contact button shown in 
Figure 2-19.

Figure 2-20.  Edit page for a new contact
	 2.	 Type the first name on the edit page, as shown in Figure 2-20.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

69
	 3.	 Type the last name (this is required to save any contact record).
	 4.	 The account name is prefilled with the name of the account 
record you started in. Fill in any additional information about the 
contact.
	 5.	 Click Save to save the record and relate Michael Scott with Dunder 
Mifflin. Once properly saved, a success message will appear, as 
shown in Figure 2-21.

Figure 2-­22.
Figure 2-22.  An account with its related contacts. Click New to relate more 
contacts.
List Views
List views make it easier to sort Salesforce data within each object. Leverage list views 
to call on specific groupings of records. For example, create a list view to only see active 
accounts, hot leads, and opportunities in the negotiation stage, and so on. Records are 
automatically displayed in any list view when the criteria are met. Take action on these 
lists with Salesforce’s importing and mass updating capabilities.
Chapter 2  Sales Cloud Lightning

70
The new user interface (UI( in Lightning makes it easier to visualize data. Add charts 
to your views and use the new drag-and-drop feature to move records across different 
stages.
Create a List View
Follow these steps to create a new list view:
	 1.	 To create a list view, select the tab of the object desired. For 
example, select the Accounts tab to create an Account List view.

CHAPTER 3
Salesforce Service Cloud
Salesforce Service Cloud allows your customer service representatives and support 
representatives (users) to manage, track, and resolve customer inquiries and issues. 
The Service Cloud application uses the Case object to capture all the details needed 
to help them to resolve the inquiries and issues. Your users can manually create cases 
for requests via phone and in person or accept cases from multiple channels (e.g., 
web forms, email, real-time web chat, online communities, and social media outlets). 
You can allow your users to efficiently manage these channels by setting up case 
assignment rules. The Salesforce Service Cloud application also allows you to create 
case escalation rules when an issue needs to be escalated to management. Tracking the 
various customer inquiries your company brings in could even help you to establish new 
procedures. It also will help you to understand any weak points within your company. 
Figure 3-1 shows the internal communication that can take place in Service Cloud. In 
short, the application can help to resolve issues with customers faster.

104
Overview of Salesforce Case Management
Salesforce case management allows users to capture the necessary details of the Case 
object to manage and successfully resolve their case. Users can see important case details 
in 29 standard fields as well as create their own custom fields. They can keep track of the 
status of a case with a drop-down field with values such as New, Working, Escalated, and 
Closed. Users can also access all the necessary connected objects such as the account, 
contact detail, and product information. Giving users access to the account and contact 
details will allow them to get a full view of the customer submitting the case. They can 
assign the case to a High, Medium, or Low priority based on the case submission as well 
as set up their page layout to best fit their needs and the needs of the company.
Introduction to Standard Case Fields and Related 
Lists
Salesforce offers a number of standard fields via its Case object that are displayed in 
Figure 3-2. Before you decide to create a custom field, we recommend that you leverage 
an existing standard field instead. The majority of Salesforce standard fields have  
Figure 3-1.  Internal communication
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

105
back-­end automation applied to them. Because every business is different, you will most 
likely need custom fields, but why re-create the wheel if it’s not necessary?
Figure 3-2.  Case information fields
You will find the following fields in the Case Information section (as shown in 
Figure 3-2):
•	
Parent Case: Attach a case that currently exists and was the reason for 
the new case.
Note  If you use this function, it is essential to add the related list “Related Cases” 
to the case layout to get a full view of all the cases attached to a parent case.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

106
•	
Case Owner: Assign the user who is primarily responsible for 
managing the case.
•	
Case Number: This is an automatically generated number used to 
reference a case both internally and externally.
Tip  Use this case number to allow your users and customers to reference it 
when addressing the case. Apply it to automated emails.
•	
Status: Use this field to track the current status of a case. Utilize the 
existing values (New, Escalated, and Closed) or add your own.
•	
Contact Name: Attach the point of contact who submitted the case.
•	
Escalated: Use this check box to apply workflow rules (discussed 
later in the chapter) to automated escalations. Additionally, select 
this box and see the newly added red arrow next to the case number 
indicating that the case has been escalated. Utilize this field in reports 
and dashboards to keep an eye on your most important cases.
•	
Account Name: After attaching the contact, watch the account get 
autopopulated with the account details of the contact. If the case 
belongs to an account other than the attached contact, overwrite the 
field with the necessary account.
•	
Priority: Apply the necessary priority to the case using the standard 
values of High, Medium, or Low. Utilize this field in reports and 
dashboards to keep an eye on your most important cases.
•	
Type: Use this field to track the types of cases your teams are 
managing. Use this field to help determine what FAQs should be 
developed or updated.
•	
Case Reason: Use this field to track the reasons why a client contacted 
you. You can also use this field to help update FAQs, internal process, 
and so much more.
•	
Case Origin: Use this field to track where your cases are coming from, 
whether it be an online form, email, phone, or in person.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

107
•	
Date/Time Opened: This field is automatically populated with the 
date and time the case was created.
•	
Date/Time Closed: This field is automatically populated with the date 
and time the case was closed. Cases can be closed by changing the 
case status to a closed status or via many other ways (e.g., API, import 
update, automation rules, etc.).
Note  Salesforce reports come with an Age field that tracks the duration in days. 
However, this field is not a field that you can put on your case layout. You can 
create a formula field if you would like your users to see the duration a case has 
been (or was open for) on the case page layout.
•	
Closed When Created: Users are able to create a new case and close it 
right away. When this happens the checkbox is marked true for this 
field and can be used in reports.
Under Contact Information in Figure 3-3, you’ll find the following fields:
•	
Contact Phone, Contact Mobile, Contact Fax, and Contact Email: 
These fields pertain to the contact attached to the case. They are all 
formula fields that are used to map fields from one object to another. 
Since these are formula fields, they are locked fields that can’t be 
updated from the Case object. Instead, you’ll need to go to the 
contact record and update the information there.
Under Web Information in Figure 3-3, you’ll find the following fields:
•	
Web Email, Web Company, Web Name, and Web Phone: When the 
web-to-case function is configured (we’ll cover this later in the 
chapter), cases will be automatically created in Salesforce. These fields 
will be populated with the corresponding data from your web form.
Under Description Information in Figure 3-3, you’ll find the following fields:
•	
Subject: Use this field as the incoming subject line of an email when 
the email-to-case feature is configured or as a quick reference to what 
the case is about. Notice that this field’s data is replicated at the top 
the page layout as well.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

108
•	
Description: Use this field as the incoming body of an email when 
the email-to-case feature is configured or as a long description of the 
case.
•	
Internal Comments: Use this field to create case comments while you 
are on a call with a client.
•	
Created By: This field is found on every record in Salesforce. It 
captures who and at what date and time the case was created.
•	
Last Modified By: This field is also found on every record in 
Salesforce. It captures who and at what date and time the case was 
last updated or modified.
Tip  Don’t worry if these fields aren’t enough or don’t work for your company. The 
default positions of some of these fields are easily modified. Salesforce allows up 
to 500 custom fields on the Case object. You can create fields for text, dates and 
time, numbers, currency, percents, picklists, multiselect picklists, check boxes, 
emails, phones, and URLs.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

109
Next, we’ll discuss the standard related list found on the Case object.
Figure 3-4 shows the standard Case object related list. A related list is another object 
within your Salesforce organization that is connected to the current object you are 
viewing. The related list you’ll find on the Case object includes the following:
•	
Solutions: This related list houses articles created in another 
Salesforce object called Solutions. Solutions are used to house 
content that either can be used to help you user close a case faster or 
can be used to provide information to the case contact. This object 
works with another Salesforce product called Knowledge. Solutions 
and Knowledge are important products because they provide 
resources to your users that help them move a case forward.
Figure 3-3.  More case fields
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

•	
Open Activities: These records are outstanding or future tasks or 
events that your user created. Any task or event that hasn’t been 
completed will show up here.
•	
Activity History: These records are tasks, emails, call logs, and events 
that your user has completed.
•	
Case Comments: These records provide information pertaining to the 
case. Your user will add important case comments to this area.
•	
Attachments: These records reflect outside documents that pertain 
to the case. This could be current client contracts or screenshots 
provided by the client about an error they are experiencing.
•	
Case History: This content includes all the field-level changes made to 
the Case object. You can set field tracking and choose what fields are 
most important (we’ll cover this later in the book).
Note  Salesforce also offers other related lists. Although not on a standard page 
layout, these can be easily added to your page layout. One that is worth noting 
is Contact Roles, which allows you to add multiple contacts to one case record. 
Another is the related list called Emails, which is used when you have enabled 
the email-to-case function (explained later in this chapter). If set up in your email 
account properly, your users can stay in Salesforce and never have to bounce 
between the two (also covered later).
Tip  Salesforce allows you to relate objects to one another. Should your Case 
object need multiple records of another, you can create a junction object. For 
instance, if you would like to relate multiple products that are involved in one case, 
you can do so. Creating custom objects is simpler than you may think.

Creating a New Case Record
You can manually enter a case by first navigating to the Case object (see Figure 3-5) and 
then clicking the New button. Once a record has opened, you can begin filling in the 
case details by adding the contact name, account name, priority, case origin, type, and 
case reason (see Figure 3-6). Make sure to capture the client’s explanation or reasoning 
for reaching out in the Subject and Description fields (Figure 3-6). While you are adding 
these details, utilize the Internal Comments field if necessary. If you have created custom 
fields for your Case object, make sure to train your users on filling in these details as well.
Figure 3-5.  If you are not already on the Cases tab, use the down-facing arrow 
next to the object title to navigate to the Cases tab
The following steps are recommended to create a new case record (Figures 3-6  
and 3-7):
	 1.	 Type the contact name and click the magnifying glass next to the 
field to attach a contact to the case.
	 2.	 The account name will automatically be assigned to the account 
of the contact you attached in the contact field.
Tip  Accounts and contacts can be disabled as required fields.
	 3.	 Change the priority of the case by clicking in the field. Select the 
appropriate value from the provided values.
	 4.	 Select the case origin by clicking into the field and select the 
appropriate value. Notice the * next to this field. This means that it 
is required.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

113
	 5.	 Select the type and case reason by clicking into the field and 
selecting the appropriate value.
	 6.	 Fill out any custom fields appropriately if necessary at this time.
Figure 3-6.  Creating a case, steps 1 to 6
	 7.	 Type in the subject of the case.
	 8.	 Type in the description of the case.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

114
Figure 3-7.  Creating a case, steps 7 and 8
Note  The Subject and Description fields are used in the email-to-case functions.
	 9.	 Once complete, click Save.
Tip  Utilize the case Date/Time Opened and Date/Time Closed fields to generate 
reports about case duration. Also, the case type and reason fields can help define 
client and internal FAQs.
Collaborating with Your Team on a Case Record
Managing and efficiently closing cases can take more than one person being involved 
from your team. Users can utilize the case feed found in their case record to quickly 
communicate with others on your team. They can also direct a message to any Salesforce 
user who has access to the case record.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

115
Figure 3-8.  Case feed
To mention a comment to a user, you use the @ symbol followed by the user’s name 
and, once the name populates below the text area, click the hyperlinked name. You’ll also 
see that every action is tracked in the case feed for a complete view of the case and what 
happened throughout its duration. The feed filters on the left side of the case record help 
you to quickly navigate to case’s feed-related items. Feed details will display from the oldest 
at the bottom to the newest created at the top. This gives you a quick view of the latest 
conversations or work done on the case. Figure 3-8 shows the functions of the case feed.
To collaborate with your team, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Access the case feed by clicking the tab Feed.
	 2.	 Utilize the post area to communicate with your team on the case.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

116
	 3.	 Utilize the case feed to track all conversations throughout the case 
duration.
	 4.	 The case feed captures changes made to the case status.
	 5.	 The case feed also tracks activities such as the Log a Call activity 
and other general tasks (see Figure 3-9).

Case Automation
Salesforce offers the ability to automate functions such as automatically assigning a case 
to a queue or to a specific user. Salesforce also allows you to create rules to auto-respond 
to your clients related to a case based on specific criteria. You can also configure case 
escalation rules based on criteria that will automatically assign the case to an escalated 
case. Along with this case escalation, you can apply automated notifications to be sent 
when this criterion is met. You can also route cases from your email or from a web form. 
You are also able to adjust some support settings that allow you to further customize 
your case automation. Figure 3-10 shows a case queue.
Figure 3-10.  Case queue
Creating Case Queues
A case can be sent to a queue in many ways. You can automatically assign a case to a 
queue when it created or throughout the life of the case because a change to the case 
record can send it to a queue. You can think of a queue as a holding tank. This holding 
tank will allow you to give multiple users access to it and give them the option of 
accepting new cases. Instead of assigning a case to a specific owner, you can assign it to a 
queue using the case assignment rules. In Figures 3-11 through 3-14, you’ll learn how to 
create a queue in Salesforce. The steps are as follows:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Queue. Click Queues under Users.
	 3.	 Click the New button.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

118
	 4.	 Create a user-facing label for the queue and hit your Tab key. 
Salesforce will create the queue name.
	 5.	 Put an email address in the Queue Email field if you want to 
receive a notification that a new case was added to the queue.
	 6.	 Select the box Send Email to Members if you want the users 
assigned to that queue to receive an email when a new case 
arrives in the queue.
Figure 3-11.  Creating a case queue
Figure 3-12.  Naming your queue and setting notification options
	 7.	 Select the Case object and click the arrow to move it to the 
Selected Objects section.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

119
	 8.	 Using the search area, select in the drop-down whether you 
want to search for a specific user, public group, role, or role and 
subordinates.
Note  Selecting the option Roles and Subordinates gives access to the specific 
queue to a specific role and all that fall under the role. For instance, if your CEO sits 
at the top of your role hierarchy and you give the CEO access using this function, it 
gives all below the CEO role access as well.
	 9.	 Select the specific user, public group, role, or role and 
subordinates and use the right-facing arrow to move it into the 
Selected Members area.
	 10.	 Click Save.
Figure 3-13.  Selecting the object for your queue
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

120
Tip  Queues can be used for more than just cases. You can set up lead queues 
and set up lead assignment rules just like you can on cases.
Creating Case Assignment Rules
Now that you have created your first queue, it’s time to automatically assign cases to that 
queue or to a specific owner. You can create case assignment rules based on specific 
criteria in the case and related records to the case. For instance, you can create an 
assignment rule to automatically assign all cases that came in for a specific account or 
contact to a specific user. Or you can assign a case to a queue based on the case origin, 
case reason, case type, or any other field found in the case record. Some companies 
create queues for VIP or platinum clients and only allow their most experienced users to 
handle these cases. Figures 3-15 through 3-20 show you this process. The step-by-step 
process is as follows:
Figure 3-14.  Select the users, groups, roles, or roles that need to have access to this 
queue.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

121
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Case Assignment. Click Case 
Assignment under Service.
	 3.	 Click New to start the case assignment rule.
Figure 3-15.  Accessing case assignment rules
	 4.	 Name the rule and click Save. You can activate the rule now by 
checking the Active check box or hold off and activate it later.
	 5.	 Click Save.

	 6.	 Click the New button.
Note  In Figure 3-18 notice the Active box above Modified By. This is where you 
will activate the rule after you have completed it using the Active check box.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

123
	 7.	 If this is your first case rule assignment, type the number 1 into the 
Sort Order field. If you have configured many rules, the Sort Order 
field tells Salesforce which rules to run first. Once a rule runs 
and assigns the case, it will not run other rules on the same case. 
Assign the sorting to all your rules according to importance.
	 8.	 In step 2 you create the rule criteria. The rule criteria tells 
Salesforce that if the criteria you enter here is true, then it assigns 
the case to the specified location (steps 9 and 10).
a.	 To start this process, you’ll first need to click None in the field 
column. Here you will select the field that Salesforce should 
evaluate for the rule. This can be the case type, case reason, 
case origin, account, contact information, or any field criteria 
found in the case, account, or contact.
b.	 Choose the appropriate operator. For instance, if you want 
every case type that equals a specific value to be auto-assigned 
to specific users, you would choose the operator “equals” and 
select those values.
c.	 Choose or enter the appropriate value or outcome in which 
the case will auto-­assign.
d.	 You can also configure your filter logic by clicking Add Filter 
Logic. This allows you to change the logic from being “all” the 
field criteria (using “and”) to “or.” For example, you can say 
if the case type is Problem OR the case origin is Email. The 
standard setup would make that logic sentence be “If the case 
type is Problem AND the case origin is Email.”
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

124
	 9.	 Choose to assign the case to a specific user or to the queue you set 
up in the previous section.
	 10.	 Select an email template that you would like to autosend to the 
user or queue.
	 11.	 Click Save or click Save and New to set up another case 
assignment.
Figure 3-19.  Setting up the field criteria for the case assignment rule
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

125
Note  Step 4 provides a functionality that is not a Lightning component and would 
have to be set up in Classic.
Creating Case Auto-Response Rules
Case auto-response rules allow you automate communication with your client based on 
field-level change. For instance, if you want an email sent to your client when the status 
of the case changes from one value to another, you can do that. Any field-level change 
from a value to another can activate this email send or another automation. Figures 3-21 
through 3-26 will walk you through creating case auto-response rules.
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Case Auto-Response. Click Case 
Auto-Response Rules under Service.
	 3.	 Click New to start the Case Auto-Response rule.
Figure 3-20.  Assigning the specific user or queue and send them a 
notification

Note  In Figure 3-24, notice the Active check box above the Modified By field. 
This is where you can activate the rule after you have completed it using the Active 
check box.

128
	 8.	 If this is your first case auto-response rule, type the number 1 into 
the Sort Order field.
	 9.	 In step 2 you create the rule criteria. The rule criteria tells 
Salesforce that if the criteria you enter here is true on the case, 
then send the email (steps 9 and 10).
a.	 To start this process, you’ll first need to click None in the field 
column. Here you will select the field that Salesforce should 
evaluate for the rule. This can be the case type, case reason, 
case organ, account, contact information, or any field criteria 
found in the case, account, or contact.
b.	 Choose the appropriate operator. For instance, if you want 
every case type that equals a specific value to automate the 
email, you would choose the operator “equals” and select 
those values.
c.	 Choose or enter the appropriate value or outcome in which 
the case will auto send the email.
d.	 You can also configure your filter logic by clicking Add Filter 
Logic. This allows you to change the logic from being “all” the 
field criteria (using “and”) to “or.” For example, you can say 
if the case type is Problem OR the case origin is Email. The 
standard setup would make that logic sentence be “If the case 
type is Problem AND the case origin is Email.”
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

129
	 10.	 In step 3, you’ll need to provide the name of who the email is 
coming from.
	 11.	 Enter the sender’s email address in the Email Address field.
	 12.	 Provide a reply-to address should the client want to respond to the 
email.
Note  You can only use one of your user’s emails or an email that you set up as 
an organization-wide email.
	 13.	 Assign the email template that you want to be sent for this auto-
response rule.
	 14.	 Once steps 1 through 4 are complete, click Save.
Figure 3-25.  Creating the criteria for your case auto-response rule
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

130
Creating Case Escalation Rules
Case escalation rules allow you to create automation for when a case will get escalated 
and what actions will take place thereafter. Like the other rules that you have created 
in the previous section, you’ll be able to determine when the case gets escalated based 
on field-level criteria of the case. Once the field-level criteria are met, then you can set 
actions such as sending a notification email, reassigning the case to another user, and 
notifying that user. Figures 3-27 through 3-34 show the setup. The steps include the 
following:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Escalation Rules. Click Escalation 
Rules under Service.
	 3.	 Click New to start the escalation rule.

Figure 3-30.  Creating the criteria for your case escalation rule
Note  In Figure 3-30, notice the Active check box; this is where you will activate 
the rule after you have completed it using the Active check box.
	 8.	 If this is your first case escalation rule, type the number 1 into 
the Sort Order field. If you have configured many, the Sort Order 
field tells Salesforce which rule to run first. Once a rule runs and 
executes the action, it will not run other rules on the same case. 
Assign the sorting to all your rules according to importance.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

133
	 9.	 In step 2 you create the rule criteria. The rule criteria tells 
Salesforce that if the criteria you enter here is true on the case, 
then it will send the email (steps 9 and 10).
a.	 To start this process, you’ll first need to click None in the field 
column. Here you will select the field that Salesforce should 
evaluate for the rule. This can be the case type, case reason, 
case organ, account, contact information, or any field criteria 
found in the case, account, or contact.
b.	 Choose the appropriate operator. For instance, if you want 
every case type that equals a specific value to automate the 
email, you would choose the operator “equals” and select 
those values.
c.	 Choose or enter the appropriate value or outcome in which 
the case will autosend the email.
d.	 You can also configure your filter logic by clicking Add Filter 
Logic. This allows you to change the logic from being “all” the 
field criteria (using “and”) to “or.” For example, you can say 
if the case type is Problem OR the case origin is Email. The 
standard setup would make that logic sentence be “If the case 
type is Problem AND the case origin is Email.”
Figure 3-31.  Creating your rule criteria for the case escalation rule
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

134
	 10.	 In step 3 you can choose a business hour to set for this escalation.
Note  To choose business hours to set, you to need to have created this in 
Salesforce. In the Setup menu, search for business hours for more information. By 
default, the business hours are set for 24 hours 7 days a week.
	 11.	 In step 4 you select how escalation times will be determined.
a.	 You can select when the case is created, which will evaluate 
the criteria only once when the case is created.
b.	 You can select when the case is created and disable it after the 
case is first modified. This option will check your case’s criteria 
after the first time the case is modified (usually this is after a 
user has started to handle it).
c.	 You can select the last modification time of the case. This will 
check the criteria of the case every time a change is made to it. 
This will allow the escalation rule to be applied when the case 
is modified.
	 12.	 Click Save.
Figure 3-32.  Selecting the business hours and when the case escalation rule 
should run
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

135
	 13.	 Click the New button to start the creation of your actions.
Figure 3-33.  Creating your escalation rule action
	 14.	 For the Age Over field, you determine the number of hours that 
a case with matching criteria can be open before it escalates. You 
can change the drop-down to show single minutes or adjust it for 
30-minute increments.
	 15.	 Under “Choose one or more of the following actions,” you can do 
the following:
a.	 Choose to have the case reassigned to another user or a 
queue. In the field next to “Auto-reassign cases to,” choose 
an email template that will get sent to that user or the users 
belonging to that queue.
b.	 Choose who will get notified that a case has escalated and 
select the template that should notify the user. Usually, this is 
an individual in management.
c.	 If you are not choosing to reassign the case, you can at this 
time notify the current owner of the case that it has escalated.
d.	 In the Additional Emails field, choose in addition to the 
previous setting if anyone else should receive a notice of the 
case escalating.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

136
	 16.	 When you have completed your action, click the Save button.
Figure 3-34.  Setting up the actions on your case escalation rule
Tip  You can create one escalation rule with multiple actions, such as if you want 
a particular case to be escalated after two hours of meeting the rule criteria. Then 
if the case still isn’t closed four hours after that and you want to escalate it again, 
you could set this up. All you would need to do is create another action.
Setting Up Email-to-Case
Email-to-case is a function that allows you to automatically have a case created based on 
an email being sent to a specific email address. For instance, if you have a support group 
that manages tech questions about your products, you can publicize an email and allow 
clients to submit requests that will automatically be routed to Salesforce and create a 
case for you. Figures 3-35 through 3-42 will walk you through this setup.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

137
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Email-. Click Email-to-Case under 
Service.

139
	 7.	 Enter the email’s routing name. Usually, this is the name of the 
email.
	 8.	 Enter the actual routing email address.
	 9.	 You can choose to save an email’s header and set who you will 
accept them from. However, because these are usually images, it 
will take up 15KB of your organization’s storage. Most users do not 
enable this option.
	 10.	 Under Task Settings, you can create a task along with the case 
being created when it comes in.
	 11.	 Under Case Setting, set the priority of the case and the case origin.
	 12.	 Click Save or click Save & New to set up more email routing 
addresses.
Figure 3-37.  Creating a new routing address for the email-to-case setup
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

140
	 13.	 An email will be sent automatically to the routing address that 
you entered in step 8. If you don’t receive an email within a 
couple hours, make sure to check your spam or other firewall 
settings your company may have or click the Resend link shown in 
Figure 3-39.

141
	 14.	 The email you receive should look like the example in Figure 3-40. 
You’ll need to click the link within the email to verify that this is a 
working email address. After clicking the link, you’ll be taken to 
another Salesforce screen; click the Continue button, as shown in 
Figure 3-41.
Figure 3-40.  Email verification sent
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

142
Figure 3-41.  Click Continue, and you’ll be taken to the Salesforce login page
	 15.	 Lastly, you’ll need to apply some email forwarding rules on your 
email inbox to forward emails to the e-mail service address that 
Salesforce provides.
Creating the email forwarding rule is what utilizes the on-demand email-to-case 
functions supported by Salesforce. By forwarding all your emails to the email service 
address provided by Salesforce, you can give your users a one-stop application with 
Salesforce. When an email is sent into Salesforce, the client receives a reply with a 
unique case thread found in the body and the subject line of the email. This case thread 
allows an email that comes back into the same email account and per your forwarding 
rules gets sent into Salesforce to be attached to the existing case. This allows your users 
to stay in Salesforce while they address support case inquiries. Figure 3-42 shows a case 
thread.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

143
Note  The email-to-case function has some limitations. First, you can only receive 
attachments up to 10MB. Second, this option only allows up to 5,000 email 
messages a day. For workarounds, see the Setup area to have Salesforce deal with 
bounced messages. Finally, if the case thread is not included in an email, a new 
case will be created.
Tip  You would want to use the email-to-case option if your case inquiries are 
generally over 25MB. Also, the email-to-case setup will automatically identify 
contacts and replies to the case. The on-demand feature allows for a much more 
custom solution. It allows for custom field mapping, and its setup is fairly simple.
Setting Up Web-to-Case
The web-to-case function in Salesforce allows you to embed HTML code into your 
preexisting web site or web form. The majority of clients that have used this function 
embed the HTML code into a Contact Us form found on support-related web pages 
on their web sites. This function, like that of the email-to-case function, allows 
automatically generated cases to make it into Salesforce. Follow the steps shown in 
Figures 3-43 through 3-48.
Figure 3-42.  This case thread allows your client email to get attached to the 
appropriate case.
Chapter 3  Salesforce Service Cloud

144
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu by clicking the settings cog icon in the 
upper-right corner of the Salesforce window.
	 2.	 Using your search area, enter Web-to-case. Click Web-to-Case 
under Service.
	 3.	 The check box Enable Web-to-Case should be select, as shown in 
Figure 3-43.
	 4.	 Set the default Case Origin option to Web or any other option that 
describes where this case is coming from.
	 5.	 Attach a response template that you want your client to receive 
upon submitting their case.
	 6.	 Hide Record Information will hide the record information in the 
email that is sent.
Note  If you want to create an email template for this, go to Setup, search for 
Email Template, and under the Email section you’ll find Email Template.
	 7.	 Add an email signature if you choose to otherwise create it in the 
email template.
	 8.	 Click Save.

CHAPTER 4
Lightning Apps
The AppExchange marketplace comprises a suite of apps, Lightning components, and 
consulting resources. Salesforce customers can install add-on applications to their 
Salesforce organization. You can search across thousands of apps to find prebuilt 
solutions for business needs. The marketplace is also the place to search across 
thousands of registered Salesforce consultants (shown in Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1.  Blaze new trails with the AppExchange
Apps
Increase productivity by installing prebuilt packages, called apps, which provide 
custom solutions for every role and industry. Visit the AppExchange web site at http://
appexchange.salesforce.com. Here you can sort and filter in numerous ways including 
by popularity and rating.
To pick the right app, we recommend identifying your business challenges, budget, 
and time frame.

150
Discover the AppExchange Marketplace
You should take the time to explore the business app store in Salesforce, otherwise 
known as the AppExchange marketplace. There are more than 3,000 apps and 
components that can be used to extend the power of Salesforce. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 From the App Launcher, click Visit AppExchange, as shown in 
Figure 4-2. Or, from Setup, search for AppExchange marketplace in 
the Quick Find area.
Figure 4-2.  Visit the AppExchange from the App Launcher

Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

151
This marketplace contains apps and components for end users to install and download 
into their Salesforce organization. In addition, you have access to thousands of reviews about 
these apps, components, and consultants. It’s complete transparency at your fingertips.
On your home page, shown in Figure 4-4, apps can be searched and filtered by 
various categories. You’ll find a wide array of apps! They range from point solutions to 
full-blown integration and automation. There are free apps, and there are paid apps. The 
good news is that Salesforce makes it easy to find what you are looking for.
Figure 4-4.  The AppExchange home page
Choose an App
Choosing the right app can seem overwhelming with the number of solutions available. 
So, it’s important to have a strategy in this decision-making process.
	 1.	 Start by defining your business challenges. Identify your company 
goals and objectives. Once you’ve determined what they are, 
search and review a handful of solution options in the Salesforce 
marketplace.
	 2.	 Once you’ve narrowed down a handful of prospective solutions, 
evaluate the solutions and vendors. Consider the ease of use, 
support options, total cost, reviews, the ease of administration, 
and solution match. Use this information to help make a decision.
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

152
	 3.	 If available, request a demo or trial, or install the app into your 
sandbox for user testing and acceptance.
Price
One important factor is cost. There are apps in Salesforce that are free, but there are 
others that have a cost associated with them. While some apps display their total cost, 
others require you to contact them to find out the price. Some of these payment options 
can be monthly, annually, per user, or per organization.
Compatibility
Make sure to check the compatibility of the solution. You can find the compatibility 
information in the details section of the app under Requirements and Other System 
Requirements (shown in Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-5.  Requirements and Other System Requirements sections in the app 
details
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

153
App Home Page
The home page of an app provides an overview, details, reviews, and provider 
information (shown in Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-6.  Home page of an application
The page also contains this information:
•	
Highlights: The highlights bar located at the top of the application 
page, shown in Figure 4-7, displays key components of the app. This 
typically includes Lightning readiness, organization compatibility, 
and limitations.
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

154

Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

159
Install an App
Apps can be installed directly into your production or sandbox environment. Production 
environments are where your active users are using Salesforce with live data. The 
sandbox is your testing environment. These can be production or development 
environments used for testing applications. It is recommended that you install here first 
to see how it will interact with your existing setup.
An app can also be installed for a specific group of users or all users.
To install an app, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Do some research and select the app to be installed.
	 2.	 Click the Get It Now button, as shown in Figure 4-15.
Figure 4-14.  Provider tab

	 9.	 Click Done and you will be directed to the Installed Packages 
section once the app has completed installation (see Figure 4-19).
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

163
Installed Packages
Installed apps create a package of components and dependencies. This includes custom 
objects, Visualforce pages, and Apex classes and code. The installed app can come in the 
form of a managed or unmanaged package.
•	
A managed package contains restrictions to the components 
installed.
•	
An unmanaged package has more flexibility and allows development 
on top of any components installed.
To uninstall an app, navigate to the Installed Packages area in Setup and click 
Uninstall.
To find details on any installed apps, including all components and dependencies, 
click the name of the package, as shown in Figure 4-20. The details will appear, as shown 
in Figure 4-21.

164
Click View Components for the complete breakdown, by type, of everything 
installed, as shown in Figure 4-22.
Figure 4-22.  Viewing your package components
•	
Visualforce page: A Visualforce page is a custom-built page made up 
of Apex classes and code, used to create a custom look and feel.
•	
Apex class: An Apex class is part of a unique Salesforce programming 
language that gives developers and app builders the capability to 
create business logic.
•	
Custom object: This is used to store or build custom information. 
Custom objects can be used to link information to standard objects.
Lightning Component
Lightning components are reusable containers of prebuilt tools and elements. These 
components can be added to your pages to ramp up the productiveness of your end users. 
As mentioned earlier in the book, components can easily be dragged and dropped into 
your desired page. Salesforce makes this easy to do without a developer and without code. 
Discover these tools by searching through the marketplace, as shown in Figure 4-­23.
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

165
To download a component, follow the same steps used to download an app.
Find a Consultant
Consultants are registered and often certified Salesforce partners. They help make up the 
Salesforce ecosystem by providing custom Salesforce solutions and implementations. 
Consultants typically provide Salesforce training, implementation solutions, quick-start 
packages, data migration, and more.
Your Salesforce account executive will often recommend a Salesforce consulting 
partner. Typically a discovery or scoping call with a consultant follows, and a quote with 
timeframe, deliverables, and cost is provided.
Similar to app browsing, browse through a list of consultants and sort by the type of 
service, specialization, tier, territory, and more.
Figure 4-23.  Lightning Components search page
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

167
	 3.	 Find more details about this prospective consultant, including the 
number of projects completed, satisfactory ratings, geographic 
focus, and more on this page (shown in Figure 4-27). You can also 
find the consultant’s contact information here to contact them for 
services.
Figure 4-26.  Cloud Creations consultant detail page
Chapter 4  Lightning Apps

168
	 4.	 Contact the consultant and request a quote.
Tip  Consultants often employ a mix of project managers, business analysts, 
developers, and specialists. Hourly rates vary widely and typically include a 
scoping call to identify the right solution for your business. The more detail you can 
give your potential consultant, the more accurate the cost estimate will be.
Summary
The AppExchange marketplace consists of the Salesforce ecosystem of app partners 
and consultants. It is a growing market and is expected to make big changes in the near 
future. Visit the AppExchange marketplace to maximize your Salesforce setup.

CHAPTER 5
Lightning Reports and  
Dashboards
Salesforce reports and dashboards give you necessary insight into the data that you 
have collected in Salesforce. Every custom field and the majority of standard fields in 
any Salesforce object can be used in a Salesforce report. Salesforce dashboards help 
you to display this data in 11 different visual charts and tables. One report can be used 
in several dashboard components; however, a dashboard component can use only one 
report. A dashboard can display up to 20 dashboard components. Figure 5-1 shows the 
report that comes standard on your user’s home page in Lightning.
Figure 5-1.  The home screen of opportunity performance by quarter in Salesforce

170
Understanding Reports and Report Features
Reports allow you to see your data based on specific criteria that you define. Once you 
have defined your criteria, you can group your data, create a chart for easy viewing, filter 
your data further, and store the report for later use in report folders. In these next couple 
of sections, we’ll cover some of the functions available in the report builder that are 
necessary to understand, and then we’ll jump into building your report.
Report Types
Report types allow you to define what objects and fields are available to you when 
creating a report. You can create report types based on a relationship with an object 
to a related object. A good example of this type of relationship is accounts and their 
related opportunities. Your opportunities would be the primary object, and the account 
would be the related. Don’t worry, you don’t need to create report types to start using 
Salesforce reports because out of the box Salesforce has set up the standard objects for 
you. However, if you find a field missing on a report or you can’t find a custom object 
related to another, you’ll want to continue reading. Or if the standard-use report types 
don’t work for your business, you can customize your own!
Creating Report Types
The process to create report types is as follows:
	 1.	 Click the settings cog icon in the right corner of the browser, as 
shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2.  Navigating to the Setup menu
	 2.	 In the Quick Find box, search for report types (do not press Enter) 
and select the yellow highlighted phrase Report Types, as shown 
in Figure 5-3.
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

171
Tip  Salesforce offers help on most of its administrative processes. If you are 
seeing “What is a Custom Report Type?” instead, feel free to read this content too 
and then click Continue. You can also click “Don’t show me this page again” to 
disable this window in the future, as shown in Figure 5-4.
	 3.	 Click New Custom Report Type, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-3.  Accessing the report types
Figure 5-4.  Custom Report Types help page
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

172
	 4.	 Select the primary object from the drop-down field that your 
report should have, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-5.  Creating a new custom report type
Figure 5-6.  Creating a customer report type
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

173
	 5.	 Label your report type. This label will be displayed to your users 
when they are selecting the report type for the report builder. After 
you have finished your name, hit your Tab key, and Salesforce will 
automatically create the report type name.
	 6.	 Type a description for the report type. This will be visible to users 
who use this report type.
	 7.	 Select the category where this report type should be stored. 
For example, if the report type created was an opportunity and 
contact report, you should put it in the Opportunity folder. If the 
report type was a combination of multiple objects, you can choose 
to store it in one of those object’s folders.
	 8.	 Select what status this report type should be in. Selecting the In 
Development radio button will hide this report type for all users 
except administrators or those with delegated permissions. 
Selecting the Deployed status will make this report type visible 
to all users who have access to the report builder. You can always 
come back and select the Deployed option when you have 
finished and tested your report type.
	 9.	 Click Next.
	 10.	 Select “Click to relate another object,” as shown in Figure 5-7.
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

174
	 11.	 Click the Select Object drop-down to choose your related object 
for this report type, as shown in Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-7.  Relating another object for your custom report type
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

175
Note  If you are not seeing the object you want to relate to this object, it means 
that there is no connection between these objects. To create a connection, you’ll 
need to create a lookup field on the related object to the primary object. Before 
data will populate this report, that field on your records will have to be filled with a 
primary object record. Building custom objects and fields is simpler than you think. 
We don’t cover how to do that in this book, but Salesforce offers great “trailheads” 
on this topic. Go to https://trailhead.salesforce.com to find your 
trailhead and further your education.
	 12.	 In Figure 5-9, you’ll have two choices shown under A to B 
Relationships. The option “each ‘A’ record must have at least one related 
‘B’ record” will only show B records where at least one A is related to 
it. For example, all contacts that are related to accounts will show, but 
if you have a contact that has no relation to an account, it won’t show. 
The option “‘A” record may or may not have related to ‘B’ records” will 
show all B records whether or not they are related to your A record.
Figure 5-8.  Relating another object to your customer report type
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

176
	 13.	 Click “Click to relate another object” to select your next object.
	 14.	 Click the Select Object drop-down to choose your next related 
object for this report type.
	 15.	 Choose between the two radio buttons under A to B Relationships.
	 16.	 Repeat steps 13 through 15 to relate more objects for this report if 
necessary.
	 17.	 Click Save, as shown in Figure 5-10.
Figure 5-9.  Choose the type of relationship the two objects have for this report type.
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

177
Note  If you add new fields to your objects after creating a custom report type, 
you’ll have to add the new fields to the report type. You can do this by going to 
Setup, clicking your report type name, and clicking Edit Layout under “Fields 
Available for reports.” This is shown in Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-10.  Relating another object to your custom report type
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

178
Report Formats
Salesforce in Lightning Experience offers three report formats. Each format allows 
you to customize your report differently. Whether you are using Tabular format to 
generate a call list, Summary format to show data grouped horizontally, or Matrix 
format to summarize your data by both rows and columns, Salesforce has the proper 
format for you. You also have an additional report format, Joined reports, that you can 
use; however, you need to switch to Salesforce Classic to build and view these types of 
reports. Each report format has its strengths; let’s look into these a little further.  
Figure 5-­12 shows where you can make this adjustment between report formats.
Figure 5-11.  Adding new custom fields to your existing customer report types
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

179
Tabular Report Formats
The Tabular format reports are easily comparable to a flat file like a spreadsheet. This 
report format contains columns as the different data points and rows with your actual 
records. These reports are best used for creating a list of records like a call list or to list 
records with one grand total. This report format can’t be grouped, and you can’t display 
the information in a chart or use it in a dashboard component unless you use a row limit 
filter (see Figure 5-33). Most clients will use a Tabular report format to see a grand total 
of their sales with specific criteria set. For instance, if you want to run a quick report  
on all the sales your team generated for a quarter, you could use a tabular report.  
Figure 5-­13 shows what a call list tabular report would look like.
Figure 5-12.  Switching report formats
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

180
Summary Report Format
The Summary report format is the most widely used report format in Salesforce. This 
type of report format allows you to group and summarize your data for up to three 
levels. Within these groups, you can summarize on the column and obtain the subtotal 
for that particular grouping and at the end of your report the grand total. You can use 
formulas in this report to further define your report. You can use this type of report 
format to show how your sales users are stacked against each other by grouping on 
opportunity owner. You can also use this report to determine who in your company 
holds the highest record count by also grouping on users of that record. Or you can 
build a report to group the different type of contacts you have by title. This format 
can also be used and represented on a dashboard and in charts. When you leave 
your report ungrouped, it will display in a Tabular format. Figure 5-14 shows a report 
that clients would use to see how much new business is coming in versus how much 
business is coming from current clients. You can also see that it is grouped by the user 
to show how each user is stacking up against the other.
Figure 5-13.  Tabular report example
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

181
Matrix Report Format
The Matrix report format allows you to group your data by both columns and rows. This 
allows for a cross examination of your data. Just like the Summary report format, on the 
groups you create in the Matrix format you can see subtotals, record counts, and grand 
totals as well as see them by row or column, as shown in Figure 5-15. Use this type of 
report to show how well products perform over date ranges by grouping your columns 
by date and your rows by opportunity products. Or use this report to determine how 
well your users are performing over time. Use this report to compare your incoming 
case origin against your case reasons. This type of report can also be used in dashboard 
components as well as charts. Additionally, you can use formulas to further calculate 
your data. If your groupings or criteria display no results, this format report will be 
downgraded to Summary format.
Figure 5-14.  Summary report example
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

182
Report Filters
While in the report builder it will be necessary to understand the use of report filters 
that Salesforce has to offer. You can utilize up to five filter features to help customize 
your reports further. Filters allow you to get a closer look at your data and make it more 
specific for your reporting needs.
Standard Filters
Standard filters in the report builder of Salesforce will differ for some objects. Since 
the data you are collecting across accounts and contacts is different from that of 
opportunities or cases, you’ll see these standard report filters change based on the report 
type. Let’s take a look at each report type and their standard filters.
Figure 5-15.  Matrix report example
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

183
Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
Accounts, contacts, and leads all share similar standard report filters. Like most things 
to learn in Salesforce, if you understand the components of one object, those sometimes 
will translate into other objects. For the accounts, contacts, and leads, you’ll find they 
share similar attributes.
•	
All accounts: This report filter allows you to choose if you see all 
accounts regardless of the owner, only contacts you own, only the 
accounts you own, or your team’s accounts, as shown in Figure 5-16. 
If you have security set in place with role hierarchies or sharing rules, 
your users will only be able to see the accounts, contacts, and leads 
they are set up to see.
Figure 5-16.  Account filter for ownership of records
•	
All leads: This report filter for leads is similar; you have the option 
to see the leads you own, your team’s leads, and user-owned leads 
(compared to queue owned), queue-owned leads, and all leads, as 
shown in Figure 5-17.
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

184
•	
For the accounts, contacts, and leads, you can choose from any date field 
within that report type to filter from as well as use Salesforce smart dates. 
Smart dates allow you to choose dates that will update to the relative 
time every time you run your report. For instance, you can choose from 
the drop-down This Week or Current Calendar Year or use your own 
custom date range in the From and To fields, as shown in Figure 5-18.
Note If these smart dates don’t work for your report, see “Field Filters” for more ideas.
Figure 5-17.  Lead filter for the ownership of records
Figure 5-18.  Smart date filters
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

185
Opportunities’ Standard Filter Fields
Opportunities’ standard filter fields are unique to their report type, so let’s look at them.
•	
Similar to accounts, contacts, and leads, opportunities have a 
standard report filter that allows you to choose all opportunities 
regardless of who owns them, your team’s opportunities, and your 
opportunities, as shown in Figure 5-19. If you have security set in 
place with role hierarchies or sharing rules, your users will only be 
able to see the opportunities they are set up to see.
•	
The Opportunity Status filter allows you to see any opportunity 
whether it is closed, open or won, and all opportunities with any 
status, as shown in Figure 5-20.
Figure 5-19.  Opportunity ownership filter
Figure 5-20.  Opportunity status filter
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

186
•	
Opportunity Probability allows you to filter based on the Probability 
field (which is associated with this stage). You can choose options 
such as greater than 90 percent to get a better picture of what is in 
your pipeline that will most likely close, as shown in Figure 5-21.
•	
The opportunity Date Field filter works just like the one for accounts, 
contacts, and leads. You can choose from any date field within that 
report type to filter from as well as use Salesforce smart dates. Smart 
dates allow you to choose dates that will update to the relative time 
every time you run your report. For instance, you can choose from 
the drop-down This Week or Current Calendar Year or use your own 
custom date range in the From and To fields, as shown in Figure 5-22.
Figure 5-21.  Opportunity Probability filter
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

187
Case Filters
Case filters have some similarities to other objects standard filters and some that are 
unique to this report type.
•	
The Show filter on cases allows you to see all your cases, all cases 
regardless of who owns them, user-owned cases (opposed to queue 
owned), queue-owned cases, your case team’s cases, or role-based 
team’s cases, as shown in Figure 5-23. If you have security set in place 
with role hierarchies or sharing rules, your users will only be able to 
see the cases they are set up to see.
Figure 5-22.  Opportunity smart date filters
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

188
•	
The Units filter allows you to display the age of how long your case 
has been open in minutes, hours, or days, as shown in Figure 5-24.
•	
The case Date Field filter works just like the one for accounts, 
contacts, leads, and opportunities. You can choose from any date 
field within that report type to filter from as well use Salesforce smart 
dates, as shown in Figure 5-25. Smart dates allow you to choose 
dates that will update to the relative time every time you run your 
report. For instance, you can choose from the drop-down This Week 
or Current Calendar Year or use your own custom date range in the 
From and To fields.
Figure 5-23.  Case ownership filter
Figure 5-24.  Case units filter
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

189
Campaigns
Campaigns have only one option for standard filtering.
•	
The Show filter allows you to filter by a specific campaign and 
provides a lookup field to find it, as shown in Figure 5-26. It also 
allows you to see all of your active campaigns, campaigns you 
own, all active campaigns regardless of who owns them, and all 
campaigns.
Figure 5-25.  Case smart date filter

Field Filters
Field filters in the report builder allow you to drag and drop any field found within 
that report type and filter your data using operators and values. This field filtering will 
be important for you to understand because you’ll see this same feature used widely 
throughout Salesforce. You can find this in list views, workflow rules, process builders, 
and the Apex language. Some of the operators you’ll want to familiarize yourself with are 
as follows: equals, not equal to, less than, greater than, less or equal, greater or equal, 
contains, does not contain, and starts with. Here is also where you can customize smart 
dates further if the standard smart date filters don’t work for you. Drag and drop the date 
field of your choice into the filter field section, set the operator to “equals,” and use a 
phrase like Next N Days (replace “N” with your desired number) or Last N Months.
	 1.	 Take your field from the left-side Fields section and drag it to the 
filters section, as shown in Figure 5-27.
Figure 5-27.  Dragging and dropping a field onto the field filter section
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

191
	 2.	 Choose the operator appropriate for your filter, as shown in 
Figure 5-28.
	 3.	 If the field filter chosen is a picklist field, you can click the lookup 
icon. If the field is another data type, you can enter the value 
necessary.
	 4.	 For picklist fields only, you’ll check the values that your filter 
should include.
	 5.	 For picklist fields only, click Insert Selected to add these values to 
your filter, as shown in Figure 5-29.

Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

193
Note  Notice the Locked check box next to the OK button in Figure 5-30. This 
check box, if selected, allows you to lock the filter on your report so it can’t be 
changed unless the user has the permission to modify reports. Figure 5-31 shows 
how it is locked.
Filter Logic
After you have set up at least one field filter, filter logic will allow you to apply “and,” 
“or,” or “not” statements on how the fields are evaluated. You can create a complex 
statement of as many field filters that are necessary for your report. If you use filter 
logic, you do have to include all your field filters in the statement. You can use 
parentheses to group logic together to further define your report. The default filter 
logic places AND into the logic, meaning “1 AND 2 AND 3,” and so on. This tells the 
report to only include records that meet all three of the criteria that you’ve set up  
(or however many you’ve set up) into the report.
	 1.	 Click the Add button next to Filters and choose Filter Logic.
Figure 5-31.  Locked field filters
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

194
	 2.	 Create your statement. You’ll use the number next to the field 
filter to define what field filter needs to be placed with an “and” 
or “or” statement. The statements that you’ll use will look like “(1 
OR 2) AND 3 AND 4.” Another example would be “1 AND 2 AND 3 
AND 4 AND (5 OR 6 OR 7).”
	 3.	 Click OK to complete your filter logic, as shown in Figure 5-32.
Note  Every time you add a new field filter, you’ll want to adjust your filter logic and 
ensure it is correct.
Cross Filter
Cross filters in Salesforce allow you to apply conditions on objects related to the current 
object you are reporting from. You can use cross filters by applying “with” or “without” 
conditions on the related objects. After you use your cross filter, further define your field 
filter via that related cross filter. An example of this would be filtering all opportunities 
without follow-up activities. Or use the cross filter to set up filtering on opportunities 
without products to determine what opportunities still need to be completed. Another 
example of using cross filters would be to determine whether an account or contact has 
had any interaction with your sales team. You can set this up by creating an account or 
Figure 5-32.  Changing the filter logic
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

195
contact report and adding the cross filter logic of “without” activities. This will give you a 
list of all the accounts or contacts that need to be reached out to or checked in on. To set 
this up, create at least one field filter and follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Add button next to Filters and choose Cross Filter.
	 2.	 Select the primary object that you want to use to relate other 
objects to.
	 3.	 Define whether you want to see these related objects with the 
word “with” or choose “without.”
	 4.	 Select the related object you would like to see or not see.
	 5.	 Click the Add Related Object filter, select the operator along with 
the value, and click OK, as shown in Figure 5-33.
Row Limit
Row limit filters are used with Tabular reports and allow you to display your report in 
a table or chart on a dashboard if you limit the number of rows it returns and sort by a 
field. To create this, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Add button and choose Row Limit, as shown in  
Figure 5-34.
Figure 5-33.  Setting up a cross filter
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

196
	 2.	 Define the row limit.
	 3.	 Choose to sort by a particular field and whether it is ascending or 
descending and click OK.
Using the Report Builder
Creating reports in Salesforce allows you to analyze the data you and your user are 
collecting. Perhaps the best thing about being a newcomer to the reports in Salesforce 
is that you can’t break or ruin your data. All you are doing with reports is displaying 
the data you currently have in a more readable format, instead of in individual records. 
Don’t be afraid to jump right in and start clicking away!
Creating a Leads Report
You can use lead reports to see some or all key information about your leads. You can see 
how many leads you have, what lead source is working from your marketing team, the 
number of leads that are being handled by a user versus the ones that are in a queue, and 
so much more! One of the many business problems that can be resolved with generating 
lead reports is considering which lead source is working compared to ones that are not. 
You can build a report on converted leads and group the report by the lead source, as 
shown in Figure 5-35.
Figure 5-34.  Setting up the row limit

Creating Contacts and Accounts Report
You can create a contacts and accounts report to display all your contact details. Use this 
report for a call list, mail merges, viewing newly created contacts and accounts, or any 
other business needs. Business-to-business (B2B) organizations can benefit from the 
use of account reports if they want to determine the types of industries they work with. 
You can generate a report that shows you how many businesses you are engaging with in 
each industry. This would help you to determine where you should focus your marketing 
efforts. You can see what this report would look like in Figure 5-42.
To create a contacts and accounts report:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Reports tab and click Reports; once you see your 
report folders, click New Reports in the right corner.
	 2.	 In the Quick Find area, type Contact. Or, click Accounts, click 
Contacts & Accounts, and click Create, as shown in Figure 5-43.

Creating an Opportunity Report
You can create an opportunity report and opportunity with products report to display 
the sales your company has generated. Use these report types to display what is in 
the pipeline, what has dropped out of the pipeline, and all sales that your team has 
successfully won. Most businesses will generate opportunity reports to help project 
what efforts may be needed in the future. For instance, project management companies 
need to project how many projects they have now and how many projects may be 
closing or starting in the future. Being able to project this is necessary to the operations 
of the business. Project management companies need to be able to project how many 
project managers or internal support are going to be needed in the upcoming months. 
To project this, a project management company will look at all sales with a 90 percent or 
higher opportunity probability. Figure 5-47 shows what this report would look like.
Figure 5-47.  Opportunity report example

Creating Tabular, Summary, and Matrix Reports
Tabular reports are the default report selected when creating a new report. Once you 
have chosen your report type and are in the report builder, you can switch between all 
three report formats. If switching from the Summary or Matrix report format to Tabular, 
you’ll want to take the fields you grouped and move them to a column; otherwise, 
you’ll lose them and have to bring them back to the report once in Tabular format. 
When switching from a Matrix report to a Summary report, be aware that you may lose 
groupings here as well if you have set up four groupings on the Matrix report; Summary 
reports can handle only up to three groupings. Let’s look at creating Tabular, Summary, 
and Matrix reports.
	 1.	 Navigate to the Reports tab and click Reports; once you see your 
report folders, click New Reports in the right corner.
	 2.	 Choose the report type of your choice and click Create, as shown 
in Figure 5-53.
Figure 5-52.  Saving your report
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

209
	 3.	 In the Preview pane of the report builder, choose the drop-down 
that displays Tabular Format and switch to the report format of 
your choice, as shown in Figure 5-54.

Building a Tabular Report
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 To build a Tabular report, there is no need to change the format 
drop-down. Just begin dragging and dropping your fields as 
needed for your report. Once finished, click Save, name your 
report, and click Run to see your results, as shown in Figure 5-55.
	 2.	 You can also choose what field your Tabular report should sort 
by, by clicking that field. Notice that when you click the field, an 
arrow is added to that field facing up or down. This tells you if it 
is sorting this field in ascending or descending order, as shown 
in Figure 5-­56.
Figure 5-55.  Dragging and dropping fields into your report
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

211
Note  You can sort any report type like this.
Building a Summary Report
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Once you are in the report builder, change the format to the 
Summary format, as shown in Figure 5-57.
Figure 5-56.  Sorting by a field in your reports
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards

	 3.	 Once you have grouped your report with fields, you can further 
define how these fields are grouped for date data type fields. 
For instance, if you grouped by the Close Date field, you can 
change the grouping to group by Calendar Month, as shown in 
Figure 5-59.
	 4.	 Continue building your report by dragging and dropping fields 
into places of your choice. Save and name the report and run!

Building a Matrix Format Report
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Once you are in the report builder, change the Tabular Format 
drop-down to Matrix, as shown in Figure 5-60.
	 2.	 Notice for this report type you have two areas for grouping: at 
the columns level and at the row level. Drag and drop the field of 
your choice onto either of these grouping areas. You can add two 
groups on the column grouping level and on the row grouping 
level, as shown in Figure 5-61.

	 3.	 Continue building your report by dragging and dropping fields 
where you’d like. Save and name the report and run!
Summarizing Your Data
You can use the summarize feature on the number, currency, or percent field data types 
in the report builder. The summarize feature allows you to sum the data in a row, find 
the average of data in a row, find the minimum of the data in a row, or find the maximum 
of the data in a row. Use this feature in an opportunity report to find the average age of 
an opportunity or case. Or use this feature to simply give you the sum of your amount 
fields on opportunities. When you use this feature in a summary or matrix report, it will 
summarize on all grouping levels and give you the grand total.
	 1.	 Once in your report builder, click the down-facing arrow next to 
the field you want to summarize, as shown in Figure 5-62.
Figure 5-61.  Dragging and dropping the field into the grouping sections of the 
report

	 3.	 Don’t forget to save and run your report.
Adding Formulas to Reports
You can add formulas to your reports to calculate the currency, number, or percent fields 
from an object. The formula feature allows you to leverage your field formats, summarize 
field data, use basic operators, use complex functions, and use logic statements.
The operators for formulas include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
and exponentiation. The functions available include logical statements, mathematical 
statements, or summary statements.
	 1.	 In the left pane, drag Add Formula into the report and place it in a 
column position of your choice, as shown in Figure 5-64.
	 2.	 Name your formula.
	 3.	 Add a description.
	 4.	 Adjust the format or decimal place if necessary.
	 5.	 Choose what level to run this formula on.

Exporting Reports
You can export the data from any report you create in Salesforce to a spreadsheet. 
This allows you to take it into Excel for further analysis. Salesforce offers two types 
of exportable formats: the Excel format .xls and the comma-delimited .csv. XLS is 
compatible with Excel and most spreadsheet software. CSV is compatible with a wider 
range of software programs and comes with limited formatting.
	 1.	 Open your desired report; in the right corner click the down-
facing arrow next to the word Edit and select Export, as shown in 
Figure 5-67.

222
Creating Report Charts
You can create report charts for your reports in Salesforce. Report charts allow you to 
see your data in a graphical format for easy and quick review of your data. Reports and 
report charts have a one-to-one ratio: only one chart can be used in one report. Should 
you want to see several variations of your report, you can clone your report or, better 
yet, put them in a dashboard (shown in Figure 5-79). Report charts can be used only in 
Summary or Matrix format reports. You can create horizontal and vertical bar charts, 
stacked horizontal and vertical bar charts, line charts, donut charts, funnel chart, and 
scatter charts.
	 1.	 Go to your Reports tab and select the report of your choice, as 
shown in Figure 5-69.
	 2.	 Click the chart symbol next to the filter symbol, as shown in 
Figure 5-70.

	 4.	 Change the Display As section to reflect the type of report chart 
you would like to see, as shown in Figure 5-72.
	 5.	 Adjust the chart attributes within the chart editor; add a chart title, 
change the x-axis to another field, add items like a dimension or 
second axis, choose to show the values on the report chart or not, 
and choose if a legend should appear on the right or bottom of the 
chart, as shown in Figure 5-73.

Understanding Dashboards
Dashboards are visual representations of the reports you have already created. 
Dashboards can represent multiple dashboard components (individual charts and 
graphs). You can display one report in multiple dashboard components; you can’t 
display multiple reports into one dashboard component. For example, if you have one 
report that represents your sales by each user, you can display this one report in two 
dashboard components, such as a pie chart and bar chart. You can create horizontal and 
vertical bar charts, stacked horizontal and vertical bar charts, line charts, donut charts, 
funnel charts, metric charts, gauge charts, table charts, and scatter charts.
Creating a Dashboard, Adding Dashboard Components, 
and Modifying Your Dashboard
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click your Dashboards tab and click New Dashboard, as shown in 
Figure 5-75.
	 2.	 Name your dashboard.

Using Dynamic Dashboards
Dynamic dashboards allow each user to see the data that they have access to based on 
their security and sharing settings. This allows you to create one dashboard that every 
user can have access to. After you have created your dashboard, you can access the 
properties and make this modification or use the other two accesses for users. You can 
set a dashboard to be viewed as Me, which allows dashboard readers to see data in the 
dashboard according to your access to the data. You can select the option “A specified 
user,” which allows users to see data based on the selected user’s access. Lastly, you 
can use the “The logged in user,” which allows users to see data based on their access. 
Additionally, you can prevent users from changing how the dashboard is viewed by 
deselecting “Allow Dashboard views to change this (dynamic dashboard).” Businesses 
choose a dynamic dashboard over a nondynamic one when they are trying to prevent 
users from seeing data that they shouldn’t. For instance, a business may have many 
sales users. With these sales users, there are many territories. If you don’t want the 
salesperson responsible for California to see the sales data for New York, you could use 
Figure 5-81.  Saving your dashboard
Chapter 5  Lightning Reports and Dashboards 

231
the option “The logged in user.” (Granted, you must have set up your security to prevent 
this from happening, which is covered in Chapter 9.) If having the user’s data restricted 
is not an issue for your company, you can leave the settings as is. Let’s take a look at how 
you can modify this:
	 1.	 Click the settings cog icon in the right corner of the dashboard, as 
shown in Figure 5-­82.
	 2.	 Select what view you would like to set the dashboard as.
	 3.	 Select or deselect if the user should be able to change this.

	 4.	 Click Save, as shown in Figure 5-83.
Summary
One of the greatest benefits of having Salesforce as your client relationship management 
tool is the reports that can be generated from the data collected. Being able to calculate 
your return on investment (ROI) or how your sales team is doing will help you in 
the months and years of your business to come. The best thing about reports and 
dashboards is that you can’t mess your data up using them. Don’t be afraid to click 
around and play with them. You are only translating data; you can’t mess it up!

CHAPTER 6
Collaborating
Salesforce offers many collaboration tools. One valuable collaboration tool offered is called 
Chatter. This tool and its capabilities can be found on a significant number of standard 
objects and all custom objects in Salesforce. It allows your users to communicate with each 
other via internal messaging. You can even allow your users to share files such as Word 
and PowerPoint files with each other and your customers using content deliveries. Do 
you need to share your Salesforce records with another Salesforce organization? You can 
use Lightning Connect and sync data to the other Salesforce organization. You can enable 
topics, which allow your users to interact on specific topics with each other. We can’t forget 
about the Salesforce mobile app, Salesforce, that allows your users to be on-the-go for 
iPhone and Android users. Figure 6-1 shows the Chatter object.

Salesforce Chatter is an essential tool that can be used to help you collaborate internally 
with co-workers and externally with clients. You can use the Chatter feature post, which 
allows you to post messages to other users or post messages on a record itself about that 
record. Give your employees the ability to post a question that needs an answer to your 
management team. Or collect information from your employees via an anonymous poll. 
Chatter has a number of great built-in tools that can be used in various ways. Let’s look 
into some of these tools further.
Sidebar
The sidebar on the Chatter tab gives you quick access to Chatter features (Figure 6-­2). Use the 
What I Follow link to quickly see all Chatter posts corresponding to all the records that users 
follow in Salesforce (more on this feature in a bit). Use the To Me link to see any post that a 
user directed at you using the @ symbol or any post that was left on your profile from another 
user. Use Bookmarked to see any post you have bookmarked. The Company Highlights 
quick-access link uses Einstein’s artificial intelligence (AI) to bring you all the trending topics 
in your organization. The Streams quick-access link allows you to create quick-access links to 
records. Use this section to see all accounts, cases, contacts, and more that you follow. Recent 
Groups allows you to create and see the latest groups you have followed.

235
Following in Chatter
Following is a powerful tool available in Salesforce. You can follow anything from 
people to groups to records. Following allows you to see all the relevant content and 
interactions that have happened to the record you choose to follow. Following in Chatter 
is comparable to following someone on Twitter. Want to see everything your training 
instructor is posting on Salesforce? Go to their profile and click the + Follow button. If 
you have a stream set up for that object, you can choose to add this record to the stream 
or to just use What I Follow. If you are viewing your Chatter feed, hover over the name 
of another user and use the Follow button here. Find the Follow button at the top of any 
record, as shown in Figure 6-3. Following brings the content and posts into your Chatter 
feed and allows you to interact right from your feed.
Bookmarking a Post
You can bookmark a post just like you would bookmark a web site. If you want to 
save this post for later use and have it appear in your Bookmarked quick-access list in 
Chatter, all you’ll need to do is click the down-facing arrow to the right of the post and 
click Bookmark (Figure 6-4). Notice that a yellow triangle with a star appears next to the 
arrow. Remove the bookmark the same way except choose Remove Bookmark in the 
drop-down.
Figure 6-3.  Following in Chatter
Chapter 6  Collaborating

236
Creating a Stream
Streams allow you to create groupings of specific records that you may want to follow 
(Figure 6-5). Streams in Chatter are best used when you want to create a custom feed 
that groups records from various objects into one feed. For example, if you have a new 
marketing campaign and you want to create a feed that follows records affected by the 
marketing campaign, you can create a stream that shows you all the Chatter posts on 
these various objects. To create a new stream, click the plus sign found in your Chatter 
sidebar next to Streams. First, you will need to name the stream. Next, choose what 
objects and records you want to include in this stream by first choosing the object 
and then using the search bar to search a specific record. Streams allow you to see 
records from the following standard objects, plus all custom objects: Accounts, Cases, 
Contacts, Files, Groups, Leads, Opportunities, People, and Topics. If you are viewing a 
record and want to include the individual record to a stream, use the + Follow button 
and select the stream.

Chapter 6  Collaborating

237
Creating Groups
Chatter user groups in Salesforce provide a central location for users within that group to 
collaborate (Figure 6-6). Most organizations will create groups for their departments. You 
can make a group public, private, or unlisted. Public group feeds are seen by customers 
or Chatter-free users (more on this feature in a bit). Private groups are member-only 
groups and require a user to request to join and get approved prior to interacting with 
the group. Unlisted groups provide more privacy than private. Unlisted groups don’t 
allow users to request to join; it is by invitation only. Additionally, unlisted groups don’t 
show up in list views, feeds, profiles, or anywhere unless you are a member of that group 
or have the permission to modify unlisted groups (even users with Modify All Data can’t 
see these if they aren’t members). To create a group, click the plus sign next to Groups 
on the Chatter sidebar. Next, you’ll need to name the group. You can add a description 
for the group, add information about the group, choose who manages the group in the 
owner field, determine the access type (public, private, or unlisted), select if customers 
should be considered for joining the group, select Broadcast Only if you want the posts to 
only come from managers or owners of the group, and click the Save & Next button. On 
the next page, upload a group photo for your group.

Figure 6-7.  Navigating to Chatter
Chapter 6  Collaborating

239
Your Chatter feed contains all the items you follow, posts directed at you using the @ 
symbol, or posts that you have created. In your Chatter feed, you can control what you 
see by using the sidebar.
Creating Posts on Your Feed
To create a post, make sure you are on the Post tab of Chatter (Figure 6-8). You can start 
typing in the box provided and use any of the stylings it provides, such as the bolding, 
italicizing, underlying, strikethrough to your text, and bullet points or numbering. 
You can also add images, tag other groups or users, and attach files. Once your post is 
complete, click Share. Make a mistake on your post? Not a problem, use the downward-­
facing arrow (the same as the one used to bookmark) and click Edit or Delete.
After you have shared your post, watch other users like, comment, and share your 
post (Figure 6-9).

Creating a Post on a Record’s Feed
First, you’ll have to search for or find the record you want to write your post on. Next, 
you’ll click the word Chatter that appears on the right when you are on the Related tab 
of that record. Once you have clicked Chatter, you can start typing in the box provided 
and use any of the stylings it provides, such as the bolding, italicizing, underlying, 
strikethrough to your text, or bullet point or numbering. You can also add images, 
tag other groups or users, and attach files, as shown in Figure 6-10. Once your post is 
complete, click Share. You can also use the Poll and Questions options (covered later in 
the chapter).

Chapter 6  Collaborating

241
Creating Topics in Your Post
You can use hashtags just like on Twitter and Instagram to create trending topics in 
Salesforce. Just add the # symbol in front of any word (with no space) in comments or in 
posts. For example, use #learning (Figure 6-11).

242
Creating Chatter Polls
Create Chatter polls on your feed or on a group feed with up to ten possible choices, 
as shown in Figure 6-12. Watch the other Chatter users vote on their choice. Salesforce 
will count the votes and display the results. The user voting will not see who voted for 
what choice and will not see the results of the Chatter poll until they submit their vote. 
Keeping reading to learn how to create a Chatter poll.
To create a Chatter poll, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Chatter object or create a poll from within a record 
by navigating to the Chatter tab.

that other users may have the answer to, as shown in Figure 6-17. Make sure you are on 
the Question tab of your Chatter feed and post your question. Sit and wait for other users 
to answer your post. Once you have found the best answer, click the Select as Best link 
next to the Like link in the comment posted and watch it move to the top of your post 
under your question for other users to see.

Feed Tracking
Salesforce feed tracking with Chatter allows you to see changes made to records that 
are recorded in the Chatter feed. Enabling this option on an object allows a user to 
follow the changes made to that record in the Chatter feed. You can choose which 
object and what fields are tracked in the feed. You can track fields on the following 
objects: User, Group, custom and external standard objects, Account, Article Type, 
Asset, Campaign, Case, Contact, Contract, Dashboard, Event, Lead, Opportunity, 
Product, Report, Solution, and Task.
Note  Field-level security and sharing settings are used in the Chatter feed to 
determine what users can see in the feed as well.

Chatter Profiles
Salesforce Chatter profiles allow your users to customize their Salesforce profile that 
is seen by other Salesforce users and the Chatter-free users (usually customers). They 
can add a profile picture, write an About Me section, add contact information, and add 
a header photo. The profile is another way your users can see their Chatter feeds, what 
groups they are part of, what files they’ve uploaded in posts, who they are following, and 
who is following them. They can even add a new post and comment on existing ones 
from their profiles.
To access your profile, click your profile picture in the upper-right corner and click 
your name, as shown in Figure 6-33.
Other users can access your profile by clicking your hyperlinked name found on

Salesforce Mobile App for iPhone and Android Users
Salesforce, the mobile app for iPhone and Android users, is included in every Salesforce 
license and, for the most part, can be downloaded and used immediately, as shown in 
Figure 6-44. Users can download the app from the App Store or Google Play and start 
using it today! Salesforce can work out of the box because it uses metadata to see what 
you’ve built and configured in the desktop environment. However, with that said, not 
everything you may have customized will be easy to use on the mobile app. Some of 
the changes you may need to configure are “quick action” items such as creating a task, 
logging a call, and creating a new lead or contact. Or you may need to configure compact 
layouts, which allow your user to see the most important detail of a record instead of the 
whole-page layout of fields. Lastly, the mobile navigation allows you to place actions and 
objects in a user-friendly order. Making sure that the Salesforce app is configured and 
available for your users will help your users’ productivity. If you have users who are on 
the road or meeting with clients outside of the office, Salesforce app provides access to 
the records that they would be working with if they were in office or on the phone.  
Giving your users access to the mobile app will help them to capture necessary 
information when they are away from their desks. Also, if your user is out of the office 
and needs to find a client’s number quickly or an address, they can use the mobile app  
to do that.

Salesforce Workflow Rules vs. Process Builder
Salesforce has multiple solutions to automate your business process, including workflow 
rules and Process Builder.
Workflow rules are automated actions that take place when a record meets specified 
criteria and is saved. You can minimize the amount of manual data entry and processes 
by having a systematic process in place.
Process Builder is supported in Salesforce Lightning and does everything a workflow 
rule can do and more (with the exception of outbound messages). A Process Builder 
action can start when a record is changed or when invoked by another process. Both 
automation types support time-based actions.
If you have a simple single if/then statement, it is suggested that you use a workflow 
rule to automate your process. In other words, if you have criteria for automation 
that include simple logic, use a workflow rule. If there is a level of complexity to your 
automated requirement, Process Builder is best suited for this. Read the “Actions” 
section to learn more about what each action type does.
Table 7-1 identifies the differences between workflow rules and the Process Builder tool.

Process Builder: Action Types
Process Builder makes it easier to create automated actions because it is a visual 
designer, as shown in Figure 7-2.
The following are the actions that can be completed by a workflow rule or Process 
Builder:
•	
Call on an Apex class: Apex is a programming language used in 
Salesforce to develop complex processes. You can use Process 
Builder to call on an existing Apex class.
Figure 7-2.  Submit for Approval action type
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

282
•	
Create a Record: Use this action to create a new record from any 
standard or custom object. Field values can be set to build the record 
appropriately.
Tip  Required fields are still active when a record is created via a process. Make 
sure all required fields are given a value in the Set Field Values section in order to 
successfully create a record.
•	
Email Alerts: Select an existing email alert to automatically send an 
email to designated recipients.
•	
Flows: Choose this action to launch an existing visual workflow.
•	
Post to Chatter: Create a message and choose to update a user, 
Chatter group, or new Chatter post to the related record.
Note  Merge fields can be used to generate the Chatter post.
•	
Processes: Use this action type to trigger another process.
Note  Only active processes can be started.
•	
Quick action: Use this action type to start a quick action. Select 
“Global actions” to create a record or log a call. Select Object to 
define an action for the selected object.
•	
Submit for Approval: Choose to activate the default approval process 
or specific approval process for the given record, as shown in 
Figure 7-2. Control who the submitter is by selecting the appropriate 
value: Current User, User Field from a Record, or Specific User. 
Submission comments can be entered.
•	
Update records: Choose to update the existing record or a record 
related to the corresponding object (shown in Figure 7-3).
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

283
Time-Dependent Actions
When a record meets the criteria, the action can be executed immediately or on a 
specified schedule.
To control when the action is executed, add a time lapse to the process, as shown in 
Figure 7-4. Actions can be triggered to run before or after a specified date.
Figure 7-3.  Selecting a record to update in Process Builder
Figure 7-4.  Setting the time for a time-dependent action
Example
As an example, let’s create an automated action to send a “Happy Birthday” card to all 
active clients one day before birthdate. The Scheduled Actions option is available only 
when the first node of the process starts the process with “only when a record is created” 
or “when a record is created or edited” is selected and the Yes check box is selected in 
the criteria node in the Advanced section, as shown in Figure 7-5.
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

284
Creating a Process Using Process Builder
Follow the steps in this section to create an automated business process.
In this scenario, you will encounter a real-world business problem. Say sales users 
have to manually create a project record with the same details stored at the opportunity 
level. Rather than creating a new record and copying and pasting the details, it is 
beneficial for them to have the tool automatically create a new project record. At the 
same time, it’s beneficial to automatically pull the details stored in the opportunity 
record into the new project record.
Figure 7-5.  Setting the criteria for an action group
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

285
Note  In this use case, project records are records stored in a custom object titled 
Projects.
For all opportunities that are set to Closed Won, you want to create a new project 
record and update the Project field Next Step to say Schedule Project Kickoff.
Note  This is a use case you can use while managing projects in Salesforce. These 
steps can also be tweaked to create the new policy records most commonly used with 
insurance companies. Those in the financial services industry also use this concept to 
create new financial accounts records when an opportunity closes. These are just a few 
examples. The opportunities to use automation in Salesforce are endless!
Follow these steps to create this process:
	 1.	 From Setup, select Process Automation in the Platform Tools 
section, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6.  Process Automation in Setup
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

286
	 2.	 Next, select Process Builder to access the Process Builder  
home page.
All active and inactive processes are listed on this page, as shown 
in Figure 7-7, along with the description of the process, the related 
object, the process type, the last modified date, the status, and the 
actions.
	 3.	 Click the New button to start a new process.
	 4.	 Type the process name and press Tab to generate the API name, as 
shown in Figure 7-8.
Figure 7-7.  Process Builder home page and list of processes

Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

287
Note  It is not required but recommended to enter a description for each process. 
For organizations with numerous automation processes, it can be challenging to 
find the right process when there are no descriptions.
	 5.	 Determine when the process should start. Your options include 
when “A record changes” and when “It’s invoked by another process.”
Note  You can break down more complex processes into simpler processes. 
These processes can be reused and invoked by another process, as mentioned 
earlier.
With the current scenario, you will start the process when “A 
record changes.” Click Save, as shown in Figure 7-9.
	 6.	 When you first start your process, you must select the object it 
starts from. Select Add Object, as highlighted in Figure 7-10.
Figure 7-9.  Starting a process when a record changes
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

288
	 7.	 Choose the object that the process should be evaluated from, as 
shown in Figure 7-11. In this example, you will select Opportunity.
Figure 7-10.  Selecting an object in Process Builder

Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

289
	 8.	 Select when the process should start, as shown in Figure 7-11.
a.	 Select “only when a record is created” to only start the process 
for new records.
b.	 Select “when a record is created or edited” to start the process 
for new records and existing record that are edited upon 
saving.
	 9.	 You can click Yes, as shown in Figure 7-12, to evaluate the record 
multiple times (up to five times) in one execution.
	 10.	 Confirm your specification and click 
.
	 11.	 Select the Add Criteria node shown in Figure 7-13 to set the 
criteria for this process.
Figure 7-12.  Click Yes to allow the process to evaluate a record multiple times in a 
single transaction

290
	 12.	 Set the criteria that the record should meet in order for the actions 
to be executed.
In this example, you want to set the criteria for the process to start only when 
opportunity records have a stage marked as Closed Won.
Setting the Criteria
Follow these steps to set the criteria for a process:
	 1.	 Name your criteria, as shown in Figure 7-14.
Figure 7-13.  Adding a criteria node to a process
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

291
	 2.	 Find a field and choose the appropriate operator to set the criteria.
	 3.	 Select the criteria for executing the action (shown in Figure 7-15). 
You can choose to execute the actions only when the criteria are 
met, when a formula evaluates to be true, or with no criteria; just 
evaluate the action for that object. In this example, select “No 
Criteria–just execute the actions!” to execute the action for all 
opportunity records.
Figure 7-14.  Steps to setting the criteria
Chapter 7  Lightning Process Builder

292
	 4.	 Set the conditions. Use fields and operator values to set these 
conditions, as shown in Figure 7-16.
	 5.	 Once the criteria are all set, click Save.
	 6.	 Choose what the action should be once this criterion is met. Click 
Add Action, as shown in Figure 7-17.

	 8.	 In this scenario, you want to create a new project record. Click 
Create a Record.
	 9.	 Name the action and choose what type of record should be 
created, as shown in Figure 7-18.
	 10.	 Set the field values for the new record, as shown in Figure 7-19, In 
our example, we set all the field values that we want to carry over 
into the new project record.
Note  All required fields must be entered when choosing this action. If a required 
field value is not entered, the record will not be created.
	 11.	 Once you confirm that the criteria and actions are correct,  
click Save

Figure 7-20.
Note  Only one version of the process can be active at a time.
	 13.	 It is best practice to test the process. Create a test record to test this 
new automated process.
Summary
In this chapter, we reviewed the high-level details of what Process Builder can do. You 
can automate a lot more than you can with just workflow rules. It’s important to know 
that there are countless ways you can build automation into your existing setup. Use this 
chapter as a guide as to what the practical capabilities are with Process Builder.

CHAPTER 8
Data Management
Salesforce offers an array of data management tools. Lightning Salesforce offers a Data 
Import Wizard that allows you to update existing records or create new records (Figure 8-­1). 
The Data Import Wizard allows imports, updates, and inserts to be performed using comma-
separated value (CSV) files, Outlook CSV, ACT! CSV, and Gmail CSV. Salesforce not only 
supplies an importing tool but also provides tools to help you export your data into CSV files, 
mass transfer records from one owner to another based on the criteria of the record, and 
mass delete records based on the criteria of the record. Salesforce also provides data control 
tools that help you control the type of data your users are adding to the system. You can 
create duplication rules to prevent users from adding duplicate records. Data management 
is hugely important for organizations; in fact, your Salesforce organization is only as good as 
the data you collect with it. If the data is “dirty,” your reports will be too. Having accurate and 
useful data will allow you to properly analyze your information. This in turn will allow you to 
better the user and client experience.
Figure 8-1.  Importing can be easy!

296
Using the Data Import Wizard
The Data Import Wizard that Salesforce has provided allows you to import new records 
and update existing records. All you need is a CSV file with column headers that match 
your existing Salesforce fields and your data in the rows of the spreadsheet (Figure 8-2).
You can easily create a CSV file with an Excel spreadsheet. Once you save the file, 
you’ll see under the file name that you create a “save as” type. Select the drop-down and 
change it to “CSV (Comma delimited).” According to your Excel version, the verbiage 
may change. See Figure 8-3 for an example.
Figure 8-2.  CSV file ready for an import into the Salesforce organization
Chapter 8  Data Management

297
Preparing Your Data for an Import
To prepare your data for a contact and account import, you must make sure that in your 
CSV file there is a column for all the required fields you may have set up or the ones that 
come standard with Salesforce. You can determine what fields are required by editing a 
record and looking for the fields with a red line next to them. You can include any field as a 
column in this CSV file that is found on the object you are importing to. Another important 
preparation step is to ensure that the data being imported matches the data type of the 
field. It is important to prepare your data because if it is incorrect, it will give you an error 
and not import that record. To prevent spending hours on import, follow these tips:
•	
The date data type can be accepted only with this format: MM/DD/YYYY.
•	
The date and time data type can be accepted in the following format: 
MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss. There are other formats accepted as well.
Figure 8-3.  How to save an Excel file into a CSV file format
Chapter 8  Data Management

298
•	
The number and currency data type will take only numbers  
(no letters).
•	
The check box data type will accept TRUE and FALSE values  
(TRUE = selected, FALSE = deselected).
•	
The email data type fields require that an at (@) symbol be present 
and a dot (.) with an appropriate suffix be included (.com, .org, .gov, 
etc.). Salesforce doesn’t check for a specific suffix type, but if it sees 
no suffix after the dot, it will typically produce an error.
•	
Picklist data type fields must exactly match what is already included 
in the values for that picklist, or you can at the field level deselect the 
box “Restrict picklist to the values defined in the value set” so that 
any value will be included and imported.
•	
Multiselect picklist values must be separated by a semicolon  
(for example, blue; red; green).
•	
The URL data type field will need to include a dot with a suffix  
(.com, .org, .gov, etc.).
Note  In this import wizard, if the account name is the same as another in your 
CSV file, Salesforce will not create a duplicate. If the account name has one extra 
letter, Salesforce will see this as a new account and create a duplicate.
Additionally, if you label your column headers with the Salesforce field label, the 
Salesforce import wizard will automatically map your columns to the Salesforce 
fields (we’ll speak about this in step 9).
•	
Try to match all your column headers to the field names for your 
import. Most importing tools will “automap” your column headers to 
the appropriate fields.
Chapter 8  Data Management

299
Importing Accounts and Contacts with the Data Import 
Wizard
The Salesforce Data Import Wizard is a great, easy-to-use tool. It provides videos to help 
walk you through importing and has great a FAQ section. It even gives you a step-by-step 
process for setting up the import. It is important to keep your Salesforce data accurate 
and current. Whether you are importing accounts and contacts for the first time or 
adding new ones to the system, you’ll need to know how to do this for data integrity.
	 1.	 Prepare your data for import. Accounts in a standard Salesforce 
setup require the account name. Along with accounts, you can 
import contacts. Contacts in a standard Salesforce setup will 
require an account name and the last name. Because an account 
name is required for a contact, you can in your CSV file set the 
account and account details in one row and just use the account 
name for all the contacts related to that account for additional 
contacts. If you populate different account field details in the 
account fields to each contact, the last row of the import for that 
account will reflect in Salesforce. In Figure 8-4, Cloud Creations 
on row 5 would be the information seen in Salesforce after the 
import is performed.

	 2.	 Navigate to the Setup menu, as shown in Figure 8-5.
	 3.	 In the Quick Find box, type Data import (don’t hit the Enter key; 
the option will populate as you type). Click Data Import Wizard, as 
shown in Figure 8-6.
	 4.	 Click the green Launch Wizard! button, as shown in Figure 8-7.

Accounts and Contacts on the “Standard objects” tab, as shown in 
Figure 8-8.
	 6.	 Under the “What do you want to do?” question, click “add new 
records” and the following information will appear:
•	
Match contact by: This allows you to match your CSV data 
to an existing contact, if it already exists in Salesforce, by the 
full name of the contact, email, or any field you have created

and made a unique ID or external ID. This helps to prevent 
duplication when importing. You would want to choose which 
you think is the best match. Most commonly an email is used.
Note  The unique ID or external ID is an ID or a unique identifier that relates only 
to that record. When transitioning data from another CRM to Salesforce, your other 
CRM will contain its own unique ID. You should create a field and mark it as an 
external ID and import this field to your Salesforce instance. This will allow you 
to make updates to it in the future should you forget to include something in your 
original import. Or, for business use integrations to other systems, an external ID 
is essential to relate the two organizations together and make sure that you have 
only one record being updated. Salesforce creates its own unique ID for every 
record created as well; it is a 15- to 18-character alphanumeric ID. You can find 
this ID for your records in reports; just search for the field ID, as shown in  
Figure 8-­9, or find it in the URL of your browser, as shown in Figure 8-10.
Figure 8-9.  How you can search for the ID for your record in reports
Chapter 8  Data Management

303
	 7.	 Match Account by: This allows you to match your CSV data to an 
existing account, if it already exists in Salesforce, by the account 
name and site (a standard web site field on accounts) or any field 
you have created and made a unique ID or external ID, as shown 
in Figure 8-11.
Figure 8-10.  Where you can find your record ID in your browser URL

Chapter 8  Data Management

304
Note  You can make any of the following data type fields a unique ID or external 
ID by creating or editing the field and selecting the unique or external ID check box: 
auto-number, email, number, or text.
	 8.	 Salesforce allows for automated processes made with workflow 
rules or the Process Builder to be enabled or disabled. By 
checking the box, you are enabling them to be active during this 
import. This is important to consider if you have created actions 
that include email and tasks because this could bombard your 
clients or users. For example, you could have a workflow rule 
that can email a contact a welcome email every time a contact 
is created. If you keep this selected, all contacts imported will 
receive this email.
	 9.	 You can also assign all contacts imported to an existing campaign. 
If you select this option, you need to include a column in your 
import containing the campaign Salesforce ID.
	 10.	 Under the “Where is your data located?” question, you can drag 
and drop a CSV file into the “Drag CSV file here to upload” area, as 
shown in Figure 8-12. You can also click CSV, Outlook CSV, ACT! 
CSV, or Gmail CSV and then click Choose File. Locate the file on 
your machine and click Open.
Chapter 8  Data Management

305
	 11.	 Once these steps are complete, click the Next button at the 
bottom-right corner of your screen, as shown in Figure 8-13.
Figure 8-12.  Where is your data located?
Figure 8-13.  Click the Next button on the screen
	 12.	 In the Edit Mapping field, this is where you choose what column 
header is mapped to what Salesforce field on the accounts or 
contacts. If you set your column headers up correctly, you’ll 
see that Salesforce will match all your columns to the fields in 
Salesforce, as shown in Figure 8-14. In Figure 8-15, you’ll see that 
the headers didn’t match the names of the fields. Steps 13 and 14 
are additional steps to follow should you not match the headers of 
your columns to the field names they are mapping too.
Chapter 8  Data Management

307
	 13.	 If you see a triangle with an exclamation mark inside, this means 
that there is an error with your mapping, as shown in Figure 8-16. 
Hover over the icon to display the error message. In most cases, it 
is because you have mapped one column to multiple fields.
Note  If your import requires that two fields be updated with the same information, 
you’ll need to create two columns with the same data in each and map the columns 
to the respective fields. Importing tools can link to only one data point at a time.
	 14.	 If you see a field in bold red like Figure 8-15, this means the field 
still needs to be mapped. To map a field or change a field already 
mapped, click the Map or Change hyperlink. You can either type 
in the field name or use the scroll bar to find the field. Select the 
appropriate field and click Map, as shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-16.  Shows the little triangle symbol
Figure 8-17.  Mapping fields using the Data Import Wizard
Chapter 8  Data Management

308
Note  If you don’t create a record owner field in your import, the records created 
will automatically be assigned to the user performing the import. This could impact 
your organization if you have security set up that eliminates users from seeing 
data. For example, if you have a role hierarchy set up that puts you at the top of the 
hierarchy and you are the importing user, users below you may not be able to see 
the records you’ve imported. This ultimately means they can’t do their jobs.
	 15.	 Once you have reviewed that all the columns are mapped to 
the appropriate fields, click the Next button at the bottom-right 
corner, as shown in Figure 8-18.
	 16.	 The Review & Start Import screen summarizes what objects you’re 
importing to, what type of import it is (insert, update, upset), what 
CSV you are using for your import, how many fields are mapped, 
and how many are unmapped, as shown in Figure 8-19.

	 17.	 Once you have reviewed this information and feel that it is correct, 
click the Start Import button, as shown in Figure 8-20.
	 18.	 Click the OK button on the congratulations page to be taken to the 
bulk data load job request and status page, as shown in  
Figure 8-­21.
	 19.	 If the import is a large import (tens of thousands of rows), the 
job being processed can take up to several hours. If it is a small 
import, you may find that your job will be finished as soon as you 
click OK, as shown in Figure 8-22.

	 20.	 Salesforce will send you an email when your job is complete and 
will attach an error file to review any errors on your import. Some 
errors could include a data type not matching. Another could be 
that Salesforce is seeing a blank row, as shown in Figure 8-23.

Importing Leads
Ideally, you’ll find that you get to import new leads all the time! Whether you get new 
leads from a conference you attend or a purchased list, you’ll want to import them 
immediately to get your sales team working on them! The following steps will show you 
how to quickly make this happen:
	 1.	 Prepare your data for the import. Make sure that all the required 
fields are populated columns in your import. The standard 
Salesforce setup requires a last name, a company name, and a 
lead status.
	 2.	 Navigate to the Setup menu, as shown in Figure 8-24.

Chapter 8  Data Management

314
	 6.	 Under the “What do you want to do?” question, click “Add new 
records,” and the following information will appear:
•	
Match Lead by: This allows you to match your CSV data to an 
existing lead contact if it already exists in Salesforce by the full 
name of the lead, email, or any field you have created and made a 
unique ID or external ID. This helps to prevent duplication from 
being imported. You would want to choose which you think is the 
best match. Most commonly email is used.
•	
Assign New Leads to this Source: This allows you to select what 
lead source all the leads should be assigned to. If you have an 
import that is not a mixture of lead sources, you can use this 
function. For example, if you just attended a conference and you 
want to show that all these leads came from that conference, you 
would globally assign all the imported leads from this list to that 
lead source. If you have a mixture of sources where your leads 
came from, you’ll want to ignore this.
•	
Assign all leads using Assignment rules: This allows you to utilize 
a lead assignment rule you’ve created to auto-assign the owner. 
The drop-down should include all your options that you created 
in lead assignments. If all the leads you are importing need to be 
assigned to specific users, you can ignore this feature. However, if 
you purchased a list and these leads are up for anyone, you may 
want to let your auto-assignment rules handle who gets what.
•	
Assign leads to campaigns: This allows you to add all the imported 
leads to a campaign. You’ll just need to make sure to include a 
column in your spreadsheet with that campaign ID. If you want to 
have all the imported leads related to a campaign for an event or 
a campaign for an email blast, you can do this with this function.
	 7.	 Salesforce allows for automated process made with workflow rules 
or the Process Builder to be enabled to disabled. By checking the 
box, you are enabling them to be active during this import. This 
is important to consider if you have created actions that include 
email and tasks as this could bombard your clients or users.

315
	 8.	 Under the “Where is your data located?” question, you can drag 
and drop a CSV file into the “Drag CSV file here to upload” area, 
as shown in Figures 8-28 and 8-29. You can also click CSV, Outlook 
CSV, ACT! CSV, or Gmail CSV. Then click Choose File, locate the 
file on your machine, and click Open.

	 10.	 In the Edit Mapping field, this is where you choose what column 
header is mapped to what Salesforce field on the lead. If you 
set your column headers up correctly, you’ll see that Salesforce 
will match all your columns to the fields in Salesforce, as shown 
Chapter 8  Data Management

317
in Figure 8-31. In Figure 8-32, you’ll see that the headers didn’t 
match the names of the fields. Steps 11 and 12 are additional steps 
to follow if you did not match the headers of your columns to the 
field names they are mapping to.

	 11.	 If you see a field in bold red, this means that the field still needs to 
be mapped, as shown in Figure 8-33. To map a field or change a 
field already mapped, click the Map or Change hyperlink. You can 
either type in the field name or use the scroll bar to find the field. 
Select the appropriate field and click Map, as shown in Figure 8-­34.

319
Note  If you don’t create a record owner field and you don’t choose to use your 
lead assignment rules in the import, the records created will automatically be 
assigned to the user performing the import. This could impact your organization 
if you have security set up that eliminates users from seeing data. For example, if 
you have a role hierarchy set up that puts you at the top of the hierarchy and you 
are the importing user, users below you may not be able to see the records you’ve 
imported. This ultimately means they can’t do their jobs.
	 12.	 Once you have reviewed that all the columns are mapped to 
the appropriate fields, click the Next button at the bottom-right 
corner, as shown in Figure 8-35.
	 13.	 The Review & Start Import screen summarizes what objects you’re 
importing to, what type of import it is (insert, update, upsert), 
what CSV you are using for your import, how many fields are 
mapped, and how many are unmapped, as shown in Figure 8-36.

	 14.	 Once you have reviewed this information and feel that it is correct, 
click the Start Import button, as shown in Figure 8-37.
	 15.	 Click the OK button on the congratulations page to be taken to  
the bulk data load job request and status page, as shown in 
Figure 8-­38.
	 16.	 If the import is a large import (tens of thousands of rows), the 
job being processed can take up to several hours. If it is a small 
import, you may find that your job will be finished as soon as you 
clicked OK, as shown in Figure 8-39.

321
	 17.	 Salesforce will also send you an email when your job is complete 
and will attach an error file to review any errors on your import. 
Some errors could include data type not matching. Another could 
be that Salesforce is seeing a blank row, as shown in Figure 8-40.

Scheduling a Data Export
Salesforce is a cloud-based CRM and development platform that can be accessed 
anywhere you have an Internet connection. If there is a drop in your Internet service or 
you need to work offline for the time being, Salesforce allows you to export your data into 
a CSV file. Or, if you’re like us and you like to keep a backup of your data, you can do so. 
You can schedule an export to run monthly (free of charge for all Salesforce editions), 
weekly, or daily (which may have a charge depending on the Salesforce edition), and you 
can have it emailed you. Or you can perform one-time exports.
	 1.	 Navigate to the Setup menu, as shown in Figure 8-41.
Figure 8-40.  Email confirmation
Chapter 8  Data Management

323
	 2.	 In the Quick Find area, type Data Export (don’t hit the Enter key; 
the option will populate as you type). Click Data Export, as shown 
in Figure 8-42.
	 3.	 To schedule an export, click the Schedule Export button, or  
to create a one-time export, click Export Now, as shown in 
Figure 8-­43.
Figure 8-41.  Navigating to the Setup area
Figure 8-42.  Searching for Data Export
Chapter 8  Data Management

324
	 4.	 To schedule the export, choose what frequency the export should 
be delivered at. For a monthly export, you can choose what day 
of the month it should be delivered on, or the first, second, third, 
fourth, or last specific day of the week. You can also choose when 
the schedule starts, ends, and what time it should start, as shown 
in Figure 8-44.
Note  The start time doesn’t ensure that it will be delivered at that time. 
Depending on the amount of data you have, it can take up to several hours to 
complete.
	 5.	 You can choose to include images, documents, attachments, 
Salesforce files, and CRM content document versions with your 
export by selecting the boxes at the top of the page, as shown in 
Figure 8-45.
Figure 8-43.  Monthly export service options

325
	 6.	 You can also select specific objects to be exported only, or you can 
choose the option at the top-right corner to have all data included, 
as shown in Figure 8-46.
	 7.	 Once the export is all set, click the Save button.
	 8.	 If you have scheduled your export, you should see a yellow box 
with the time your next scheduled export should run, as shown in 
Figure 8-47. If the export is scheduled for now, there will be a note 
for who scheduled, what time, and in what format the information 
will be received in, as shown in Figure 8-48.

	 9.	 Once the export is ready, Salesforce will email you with a link to 
the data export in the Setup menu, as shown in Figure 8-49.
	 10.	 Here the download hyperlink will need to be clicked to download 
the file that will then need to be stored on a machine, as shown in 
Figure 8-50.

328
Duplicating Data Management
Another great feature in Salesforce is the ability to set up duplicate rules. Duplicate rules 
allow you to create criteria that will be checked against any new account, contact, or lead 
and prevent a user from creating a duplicate record. Salesforce comes out of the box with 
the following duplicate rules:
•	
Standard Account Duplicate Rule: Will verify if the new account being 
created matches any of the following combinations of account fields 
to an existing account:
a.	
Account Name and Billing Street
b.	 Account Name and City and State
c.	
Account name and Zip code
d.	 Account name and Phone
e.	
Account Website and Phone
f.	
Account Website and Billing Street
•	
Standard Contact Duplicate Rule: Will verify if the new contact being 
created matches any of the following combinations of contact fields 
to an existing contact:
a.	
First Name and Last Name and Title and Account Name
b.	 First Name and Last Name and Email
c.	
First Name and Last Name and Phone and Company Name
d.	 First Name and Last Name and Mailing Street and (City or Zip 
code or Phone)
e.	
First Name and Last Name and Mailing Street and Title
f.	
First Name and Last Name and Title and Email
g.	
First Name and Last Name and Phone
•	
Standard Lead Duplicate Rule: Will verify if the new lead being 
created matches any of the following combinations of lead fields to 
an existing lead:
Chapter 8  Data Management

329
a.	
First Name and Last Name and Title and Account Name
b.	 First Name and Last Name and Email
c.	
First Name and Last Name and Phone and Company Name
d.	 First Name and Last Name and Mailing Street and (City or Zip 
code or Phone)
e.	
First Name and Last Name and Mailing Street and Title
f.	
First Name and Last Name and Title and Email
g.	
First Name and Last Name and Phone
If the standard rules don’t work for your company, you can also create your own. For 
example, perhaps you have another combination of fields that would work better for account 
duplication rules. Maybe your business can match an account based on the account name 
and a custom field you are collecting. To create a new rule, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Go to your Setup menu and search for Duplicate Rules. Click 
Duplicate Rules, as shown in Figure 8-52.
Figure 8-52.  Selecting Duplicate Rules
Chapter 8  Data Management

330
	 2.	 From the New Rule drop-down, choose the object, in this example 
Account, as shown in Figure 8-53.
	 3.	 Name your duplicate rule.
	 4.	 Add a description.
	 5.	 Set the record-level security. This option only affects users who 
have sharing rules.
a.	 “Enforce sharing rules” means that if your users have limited 
visibility with accounts they don’t own, they won’t be able to 
see the other account that is matching to this newly created 
account.
b.	 “Bypass sharing rules” means that you are allowing the user 
to see the account they don’t own if the matching rule is 
activated.
	 6.	 In the Actions section, you can choose to allow the user to 
create or edit an account although the duplicate rule check was 
activated. The other option is Block, which will prevent the user 
from saving the record. You can also choose to alert them with 
a message from the alert box. The report option includes the 
duplicated account/contact/lead into a list view, as shown in 
Figure 8-54.
Figure 8-53.  New account rule
Chapter 8  Data Management

331
	 7.	 You can choose a preexisting matching rule you’ve created or 
you can pick from the drop-down Create New Matching Rule, as 
shown in Figure 8-55.
Figure 8-54.  Duplicate rule, steps 3 to 6
Figure 8-55.  Creating a new matching rule
Chapter 8  Data Management

332
	 8.	 Click Save Duplicate Rule, as shown in Figure 8-56.
	 9.	 Name your matching rule and hit the Tab key to have Salesforce 
create the unique name.
	 10.	 Add a description to your matching rule.
	 11.	 The matching criteria section is where you create the rule itself. 
From the column fields, choose the field that you’ll use as part of 
your matching rule. In this example, you have the account name. 
In Matching Method, you can have the option of Exact or for some 
fields Fuzzy. The method Fuzzy will strip the account name of Inc 
or Corporation and see if it can match two accounts without these 
in the name. The Fuzzy method changes per field; to see a full 
list of these methods, go to https://help.salesforce.com/ and 
search matching methods used with matching rules.
	 12.	 Select Match Blank Fields to allow your criteria to match the fields 
if they are blank. For example, if the account names are the same 
for the records and the custom field on both is blank and these 
were both checked, the criteria would match, and your user would 
be alerted. I suggest using exact values and also matching blank 
fields.
	 13.	 You can also choose if the filter logic should include all the 
previous fields with the word AND or if it should include some but 
not all with the word OR.
	 14.	 Click Save, as shown in Figure 8-57.
Figure 8-56.  Saving your duplicate rule
Chapter 8  Data Management

333
	 15.	 Make sure to activate your matching rule by clicking the Activate 
button, as shown in Figure 8-58.
Figure 8-57.  Creating the matching rule
Figure 8-58.  Activating your matching rule
Chapter 8  Data Management

334
	 16.	 Go back to the duplicate rules area (see step 1), click the name 
of the rule created, and activate the duplicate rule, as shown in 
Figure 8-59.
Mass Deleting Records
Salesforce offers a Mass Delete Records option for accounts, leads, activities, contacts, 
cases, solutions, products, and reports. This option is especially important because it 
allows you to clean up your database. If you allow or do not maintain your Salesforce 
CRM and leave records in it that mean nothing to you or your employees, you end 
up with “dirty data.” A CRM with dirty data is just about as useless as not having a 
CRM. Remember, your CRM is only as good as the data you have in it. Hence, Salesforce 
gives you a tool to mass delete. For example, say you just went to a conference and 
captured all new leads, so you went ahead and imported them. However, after reviewing 
your import, you realized it was the wrong list and an old one at that. You need to delete 
these! The next couple steps will help you clean your database:
	 1.	 Go to your Setup menu and search for Mass Delete Records.  
Click Mass Delete Records, as shown in Figure 8-60.
Figure 8-59.  Activating your duplicate rule
Chapter 8  Data Management

335
	 2.	 Click the option for the objects you want to delete the records 
from. In the previous example, it was Leads, as shown in  
Figure 8-­61.
	 3.	 Determine the criteria of the data that needs to be deleted. In this 
example, we know the created date was yesterday. Or perhaps the 
lead source was the specific conference. Almost any field on the 
object can be used as the criteria to find the records that need to 
be deleted.
Figure 8-60.  Finding Mass Delete Records
Figure 8-61.  Mass delete record choices
Chapter 8  Data Management

336
	 4.	 In the first column, select the field.
	 5.	 In the second column, choose the method.
	 6.	 In the third column, enter your value.
	 7.	 Click Search, as shown in Figure 8-62.
	 8.	 Select the records you want to delete or select the box at the top to 
select all the records.
	 9.	 Select the box Permanently Delete if you are sure you never want 
to retrieve these again.
Note  Deleted records go to your recycle bin and will autodelete after 15 days, or 
if your recycle bin is full, the oldest record will be deleted.
Figure 8-62.  Set up the criteria to find the records needing to be deleted
Chapter 8  Data Management

337
	 10.	 Click the Delete button when you are ready to delete the records, 
as shown in Figure 8-63.
Note  You can only mass delete 250 records at a time.
Mass Transferring Records
Salesforce offers a tool to help you transfer the ownership of accounts, leads, macros, 
or streaming channel records to another user. This allows you to transfer every record a 
user owns to another and can be based on the criteria of the record. This is an important 
tool if you have an employee who leaves your company or if one gets promoted! For 
example, if an employee is leaving your company and owns many accounts that now 
need to be managed by another employee, you can use this tool to transfer those 
accounts to new users.
	 1.	 Go to your Setup menu, search for Mass Transfer Records, and 
click the phrase, we shown in Figure 8-64.
Figure 8-63.  Mass deleting your records
Chapter 8  Data Management

338
	 2.	 In the example presented in the introduction of this section,  
you need to transfer accounts from one departing user to another 
user. To do this, click the Transfer Accounts link, as shown in 
Figure 8-­65.
	 3.	 Using the magnifying glass icon, search for the user you want to 
transfer the ownership of the records from.
	 4.	 Using the magnifying glass icon, search for the user you want to 
transfer the ownership of the records to.
Figure 8-64.  Searching for Mass Transfer Records in the Setup menu
Figure 8-65.  Transfer Account Records screen
Chapter 8  Data Management

339
	 5.	 It is a general rule that you shouldn’t transfer records that are 
closed or completed from one user to another. We recommend 
that you keep the history of your business this way. Therefore, 
in Figure 8-66, you’ll see we only select “Transfer open 
opportunities” and “Transfer open cases.”
	 6.	 If you want all records that one user owns transferred to the other, 
you can leave this section blank. Otherwise, if you want to transfer 
only specific records based on the criteria of the record, you’ll 
need to use this section. Notice that you can only use the logic 
AND. This means that every set of criteria you build here will have 
been on the record it is a search for. For example, if you set the 
Type field to Customer – Channel and Billing State to California, 
this will require that the record has both of these values for it to be 
available to transfer.
Figure 8-66.  Setting up the mass transfer of records
Chapter 8  Data Management

340
a.	
Find the field that you want to filter from. For example, if you 
use a Type field on the account and you only want to transfer 
specific types of accounts to the new user.
b.	
Use the appropriate method: equals, contains, less than, 
greater than, and so on. In this example, we only want 
specific types of accounts, so we use “equals.”
c.	
Enter the value that the criteria should be. In this example, it 
is the Type of accounts that equal Customer – Channel.
	 7.	 Once you have completed your criteria, click the Find button to 
find the records that match the criteria, as shown in Figure 8-66.
	 8.	 Use the check box found in the headers to select all the records to 
transfer or single select the users with the check box found next to 
the account name.
	 9.	 Once you have selected all the records, click the Transfer button, 
as shown in Figure 8-67.
Once complete, you should get the record count of the transferred records, as shown 
in Figure 8-68.

Summary
Salesforce offers so many tools right at your fingertips. With all the data tools presented, 
you shouldn’t have any issues with dirty data. If you let dirty data get out of control, it can 
become a burden to you and your users. With the proper tools at hand, you’ll never have 
a reason to let it get this way.

CHAPTER 9
Security Overview
Salesforce is committed to running the most secure cloud platform. Protecting data 
integrity and privacy is at the forefront of Salesforce’s business model. Salesforce 
approaches security with a multitiered architecture, which supports greater flexibility 
and protection. System administrators have complete control over the level of access 
delivered to end users. You can protect sensitive information and manage end user 
accessibility with profiles, permission sets, field-level security, sharing rules, and more. 
Visit the Salesforce Trust web site at http://trust.salesforce.com (Figure 9-1) for 
transparent access to security threats and advisories.
Figure 9-1.  Salesforce Trust web site

344
Salesforce Security Model
Controlling the level of access to your Salesforce organization is vital to ensuring 
client and data protection. While Salesforce is committed to the highest levels of data 
protection, your system administrator should configure the security settings to make the 
system as secure as possible. Design a security plan by considering what the primary 
risks to your data are and then learn about the Salesforce sharing architecture and its 
components to properly configure your security settings.
Fundamentals Data can be secured and layered at different levels in Salesforce. 
Access is secured in three ways: at the object level, at the field level, and at the record 
level. In database terms, an object is a table. Objects hold groupings of information 
that may be related. This includes the records that live in them. Records are the rows of 
information that are found within a table.
Accounts, contacts, and opportunities are just a few examples of standard Salesforce 
objects. Figure 9-2 shows a list view of account records in the account object. Cloud 
Creations HQ is an example of an account record in the Account object, as shown in 
Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2.  Identifying objects, records, and fields
Chapter 9  Security Overview

345
Each record stores key pieces of information. These are called fields. In database 
terms, fields are the columns found within a table. In Figure 9-2, Account Name, Account 
Site, and Phone are all examples of fields in an account record. Refer to Figure 9-2 to 
identify the difference between objects, records, and fields.
Profiles and Permission Sets
Profiles contain a collection of settings for determining what a user or group of users can 
see and do in Salesforce. A permission set contains the same collection of administrative 
settings but can be assigned to an individual user or groups of users as an extra layer of 
permission.
Note  Rather than create countless profiles to assign the appropriate settings and 
permissions for an individual user, it is best practice to assign a permission set.
Profiles
All users must be assigned a profile, and profiles can be assigned to multiple users. 
However, users can be assigned only one profile. Typically, profiles are assigned to users 
by their job function. This is usually because those with the same job description often 
require similar levels of access.
For example, you may have different security requirements for your marketing users, 
service agents, sales reps, and developers. It’s recommended that you create or modify 
profiles to meet their specific requirements.
Profile Home Page
We suggest familiarizing yourself with the different profile settings on the profile home 
page. This page is broken down into the following permissions and settings.
Console Settings
Click Edit to control the console settings for each profile (shown in Figure 9-3).
Chapter 9  Security Overview

346
Page Layouts
Page layouts can be configured for each profile. Click View Assignment next to each 
desired object to configure a different page layout for a profile (shown in Figure 9-4).
Field-Level Security
Once object-level access and record-level access are granted, you can control what 
fields are visible at the profile level. Navigate to the field level and click View next to the 
desired object to control the level of access that a profile should have to a field. Once you 
click View, you will see a list of all fields related to that object and the current field-level 
permissions. Click Edit to make changes to the appropriate field (shown in Figure 9-5).
Figure 9-3.  Console Settings
Figure 9-4.  You can control page layouts for each object at the profile level.
Chapter 9  Security Overview

347
Click Read Access to make a field visible. Select Edit Access to allow users to view 
and edit a field. Deselect Read Access and Edit Access to make a field hidden.
Let’s look at an example. Say Michael Scott Paper Co. uses Salesforce to track sales 
and accounting information. However, the CEO, Michael Scott, does not want sales 
representatives to see sensitive financial information such as credit card and Social 
Security numbers.
To solve this, create a profile for sales representatives and another profile for 
accounting. For each profile, click View Assignment next to the account and edit the field 
security. For the sales representatives profile, deselect Read Access and Edit Access in 
the Credit Card and Social Security fields. This will hide both fields from users assigned 
to the sales representative profile. Log in as a user assigned to the sales representative 
profile to test your work.
Figure 9-5.  Field-level security at the account level
Chapter 9  Security Overview

348
App and Tab Settings
Specify what apps are visible and set the default in the Custom App Settings section of 
the profile (shown in Figure 9-6).
Record Type Settings
Record types can be assigned at the profile level. For objects with record types, add the 
record type next to the appropriate object.
Figure 9-6.  Custom App Settings area in a profile
Chapter 9  Security Overview

349
Administrative and General User Permissions
Profiles have two types of permissions: Administrative and General, as shown in 
Figures 9-7 and 9-8. Familiarize yourself with the granular types of permissions so you 
can better administer a secure organization.
Figure 9-7.  Administrative Permissions section located in a profile
Chapter 9  Security Overview

350
Object-Level Security
Object-level security is stored at the profile level in the Object Permissions section. As 
a starting point, a user must have the appropriate level of access to an object to see the 
object and the records inside of it. You can control object-level security in profiles, as 
shown in Figure 9-3.
The following are different permission types used to set the level of access users have 
with each object:
•	
Read: Users can view records.
•	
Create: Users can create records.
•	
Edit: Users can read and edit records stored in this object.
•	
Delete: Users have permission to read, edit, and delete records.
•	
View All: Users can view all records stored within this object.
•	
Modify All: Users can modify all records stored within this object.
Figure 9-8.  General User Permissions section at the profile level
Chapter 9  Security Overview

351
Set the object-level security for standard and custom objects. Define whether a 
profile should have Read, Create, Edit, Delete, View All, or Modify All, as shown in 
Figure 9-9.
Password Policies, Login Hours, and IP Ranges
You can specify when passwords should expire, password requirements, session 
timeouts, and much more. You can also control the login hours and acceptable IP ranges 
for each profile.
Figure 9-9.  Setting object-level security
Chapter 9  Security Overview

352
Assigning a Profile
There are six different types of standard profiles:
•	
System Administrator: Assign this profile to a user who needs access 
to all functionality within license. This profile has access to view and 
modify all data.
•	
Standard User: This profile has core platform functionality. They can 
view, edit, and delete records they have access to.
•	
Solution Manager: This is the same functionality as a Standard User 
plus additional permissions to manage published solutions.
•	
Marketing User: This is the same functionality as a Standard User 
plus permission to import leads, manage campaigns, and manage 
communication templates.
•	
Contract Manager: This is the same functionality as a Standard User 
plus permission to manage and approve contracts.
•	
Read Only: This profile can only view records they have access to and 
run reports and export.
Create a Custom Profile
Create custom profiles to build a unique set of permissions for different groups of users. 
Follow these steps to create a custom profile:
	 1.	 Search for and select Profiles from the Setup menu (shown in 
Figure 9-10).
Chapter 9  Security Overview

353
	 2.	 To create a new profile, click New Profile, as shown in Figure 9-11.
	 3.	 To create a custom profile, you must clone one from an existing 
standard profile. Choose a standard profile to clone from and click 
Clone.
Figure 9-10.  Navigating to Profiles in Salesforce
Figure 9-11.  New Profile button on the Profiles home page
Chapter 9  Security Overview

354
	 4.	 Enter the name of the new profile and click Save, as shown in 
Figure 9-12.
To complete changes to what this profile has access to see and do, click Edit next to 
the profile name. Modify the appropriate permissions to your new profile, as shown in 
Figure 9-13.
Figure 9-12.  Naming your new custom profile
Chapter 9  Security Overview

355
Note  All users must have an assigned profile, and profiles can be assigned to 
multiple users. However, users can be assigned only one profile.
So, what do you do when you need to give additional permissions to an individual 
user?
For example, let’s say you want to extend the permission Create Reports to an 
individual user. Rather than creating a new profile or editing permissions on an existing 
profile, we suggest creating a permission set.
Figure 9-13.  Home page of a profile
Chapter 9  Security Overview

356
Permission Sets
Permission sets are a collection of permissions and settings that can be assigned to the 
users who need it.
Follow these steps to create a permission set:
	 1.	 Search Permission in Setup and click Permission Set.
	 2.	 Click the New button to create a new permission set, as shown in 
Figure 9-14.
	 3.	 Enter the name of your permission set in the Label field and 
provide a detailed description, as shown in Figure 9-15.
Figure 9-14.  Permission Sets home page
Chapter 9  Security Overview

357
	 4.	 Choose the type of user who will use this permission set.
Tip  It is best practice to give your permission set a description. This makes it 
easier to find when many permission sets exist.
Record-Level Security
Record-level security specifies what records a user has access to view and edit in each object.
Record Ownership
Each record in Salesforce must have an owner. This can be either a user or a queue. By 
default, the owner of a record has full access capabilities. This means they can view, edit, 
delete, transfer, and share the record.

Chapter 9  Security Overview

Organization-wide Defaults
By default, your Salesforce organization operates in a public sharing model. We refer to 
this as the organization-wide defaults (OWDs). This means that all users have access to 
see and edit all data on a per-object basis, provided they have the appropriate object-­
level security. To limit visibility for certain records, consider operating in a private 
sharing model for that object.
Private or Public?
When considering to go private or public on an object, consider this: are there any 
elements of your data that should be restricted to any particular user?
If the answer is yes, you should be operating in a private sharing model for that 
object.
As shown earlier in Figure 9-2, the organization-wide default has the highest level of 
restriction. This is the only security component that restricts access.
All other security components are designed to share access. Record access can 
be opened up to specific users or groups of users through roles, manual sharing, and 
sharing rules.
Change Sharing Settings
To modify your organization-wide defaults, navigate to Sharing Settings in Setup.
To control the sharing settings for external users, you must first enable external 
sharing. Select Sharing Settings in the Setup area’s Quick Find, and click Enable External 
Sharing.
From here, you can view the level of access both internally and externally by object, 
as shown in Figure 9-16.
Chapter 9  Security Overview

359
External users include community users, guest users, web site users, Chatter external 
users, and portal users. You can split the sharing settings for each object for internal and 
external users.
Select Edit to change the settings to any of these options:
•	
Private: All records in this object are private and can be visible only to 
the record owner, role, or sharing rule.
•	
Public Read Only: All records in this object are visible as read-only 
records.
•	
Public Read/Write Only: All records in this object are visible and can 
be modified by all users.
•	
Public Read/Write/Transfer: All records in this object are visible and 
can be modified and transferred by all users.
•	
Controlled by Parent: Users have the same level of access on the detail 
of a master-detail relationship.
Figure 9-16.  Default organization-wide settings
Chapter 9  Security Overview

360
Select Standard Report Visibility to enable visibility to data in reports that may not be 
accessible because of organization-wide defaults.
Select Manual User Record Sharing to allow users to manually share a record to 
additional users.
Select Manager Groups to allow users to share records with their manager groups, as 
shown in Figure 9-17.
Role Hierarchies
Once OWDs are in place to restrict data, you can use role hierarchies to open up visibility 
and share record access. Roles define the level of access a user or groups of users have 
from the top down. Record access rolls up through the hierarchy.
As an example, create a branch under Sales Managers called Sales Reps to give sales 
managers access to the sales reps beneath them, as shown in Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-17.  Additional security settings
Chapter 9  Security Overview

361
Note  When considering your role chart, keep in mind that role hierarchies aren’t 
necessarily the same as your executive organizational chart. Typically you create 
roles for every level in the hierarchy, not for every position.
If a role sits above someone else in the role hierarchy tree, that role is granted the 
same level of access to all records that fall beneath that branch. So if the access is read-­
only, that same level of record access is granted.

Chapter 9  Security Overview

362
Creating a New Role
Use roles to define how users view and share records. The correct role structure depends 
on your organization’s culture.
To create a role, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Search for Roles in the Quick Find box and click to navigate.
	 2.	 Select Set Up Roles.
	 3.	 Select Expand All to see Salesforce’s default setup.
	 4.	 Click Add Role under the appropriate branch to add a branch 
below (refer to Figure 9-­19).
Figure 9-19.  Tree branch view expanded
Chapter 9  Security Overview

363
	 5.	 Fill in the following details to successfully save a new role, as 
shown in Figure 9-20:
a.	
Label: This is the name used to title the role. Examples can 
include VP of Sales, Regional Managers, and so on. Press Tab 
to autopopulate the role name.
b.	
Role Name: This is the unique API name. This role reports to 
the name of the role above this role.
	 6.	 Assign users to specified roles.
By selecting to assign, you can search for unassigned users to connect them to a 
proper role. You can also navigate to a user’s profile and select Edit to assign a role.
Sharing Rules
You can use sharing rules to give roles, groups, or individual users access to data that 
they may be excluded from. Sharing rules can be used to override the existing security 
restrictions.
Figure 9-20.  Steps to creating a new role
Chapter 9  Security Overview

364
Public Groups
Groups can be created to simplify sharing and security. This can include a combination 
of individuals, users with specific roles, or members of other public groups.
Creating a Public Group
Before creating a sharing rule, you must create a public group. Follow these steps to 
create a public group:
	 1.	 Search for Public Groups in the Quick Find box.
	 2.	 Click New or set View to All to see a list of existing groups 
(Figure 9-21).
	 3.	 Fill in the following details, as shown in Figure 9-22.
•	
Enter the name of the public group in Label.
•	
Enter the unique API name in Group Name.
•	
To add members to a public group, move them from Available 
Members to Selected Members.
Figure 9-21.  Setting up public groups
Chapter 9  Security Overview

365
	 4.	 Click Save. Now you have a new public group with members.
Manual Sharing
Manual sharing can be used to provide individual access to records through a sharing 
button.

Chapter 9  Security Overview

366
There are four prerequisites needed to give access to another record. These 
prerequisites require the following:
•	
You are the record owner.
•	
You are in a role higher than the record owner.
•	
You have “full access” permission to the record.
•	
You are a system administrator.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how Salesforce approaches security in a multitiered 
architecture, which supports greater flexibility and protection. Be sure to visit
