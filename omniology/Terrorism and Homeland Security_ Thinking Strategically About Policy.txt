Dedication
This volume is dedicated to the late Fred A. Sondermann, professor at Colorado 
College (1953-78) and co-founder of the International Studies Association, whose 
summer seminars on national security in the 1970s inspired a generation of policy 
makers and academics—a commitment to policy-oriented scholarship reflected 
directly in the work of contributors to this volume.  Fred urged us to explore the 
international and domestic aspects of security that still challenge us in the twenty-
first century.

Foreword
More than a year before the fatal attacks on September 11, the National War College 
in Washington, D.C. and the University of Denver sponsored several workshops, 
lectures and seminars on the subject of terrorist threats to the United States. Par-
ticipants included civilian and military officials at the federal, state and local levels 
as well as academic specialists and policy analysts hosted by the Denver Council 
on Foreign Relations. Two interrelated issues received special attention: weapons of 
mass destruction/disruption (nuclear, radiological, biological, chemical and cyber-
netic) and the special threat posed by anti-western Islamic militants, most notably 
al-Qaeda. For those in attendance, the audacity of the attacks in Washington and 
New York City came as no surprise. While tactical details could not be predicted, 
a major strategic attack was clearly anticipated. 
Fearing the worst, the attendees outlined various dimensions and nuances of 
the terrorist threat after which they turned to the question of how to deal with it. 
This quickly led to an enumeration of several significant problems that needed to 
be urgently addressed, particularly the absence of an overarching strategy, the role 
of intelligence, the principal instruments for dealing with terrorism, international 
requirements, new laws and policies, root causes of violence and the special mat-
ter of military force. Vigorous ensuing discussions gave birth to the articulation 
of nine principles of counter-terrorism that were outlined and used at America’s 
preeminent institution for the study of national security strategy, The National 
War College. Most of the Washington-Denver Counter-terrorism Principles would 
emerge, albeit in a slow and piecemeal manner, after September 11. 
In abbreviated form, the Washington-Denver principles were:
	
1. Think strategically and holistically at the national level;
	
2. Know your enemy by recognizing the primacy and centrality of intelligence;
	
3. Place primary emphasis on law enforcement and the judicial system;
	
4. Assure coordination within and among intelligence and law enforcement 
agencies at all levels of government;
	
5. Emphasize international cooperation;
	
6. Avoid laws and policies that undermine basic political values and principles;

xiv  n  Foreword
	
7. Devise relevant and potentially effective social, economic and political poli-
cies and programs to address underlying causes of terrorism;
	
8. Define carefully the role of the military in deterring terrorism, compelling its 
termination and managing its effects; and
	
9. Craft the legislation and institutional reforms necessary for coping with ter-
rorism in the twenty-first century. For example, broaden the definition of 
cooperation (“jointness”) among military services to include all government 
agencies dealing with terrorism.
While these nine principles are now widely accepted, their implementation is an 
unfinished and at times muddled work. Accordingly, the publication of Terrorism 
and Homeland Security comes at a crucial moment in our history. The hourglass 
has run down on procrastination in the face of ever increasing threats. Readers of 
this volume will not only understand how we stand with respect to the principles 
and what remains to be done, but they will also benefit from the new ideas and 
insights presented by an impressive array of specialists.
As an added bonus, there is no one better suited to lead this undertaking than 
Professor Paul R. Viotti, an educator who has long been recognized for his excel-
lence in teaching and forward-looking thinking. The same creativity and leadership 
that he formerly brought to the task of defining the terrorist threat to the United 
States and the principles that should frame the response are called for more than 
ever. Thankfully, that call has been answered with this thoughtful work.

Preface
The American homeland is still not secure from terrorist attack, notwithstanding 
enormous sums already allocated to this purpose. What passes as strategy is often 
a list of objectives with vague references to marshalling national resources and sup-
port drawn from other countries. Strategy for homeland security is at best piece-
meal, tackling parts of the problem without linking these elements together into a 
more coherent whole. The resulting fragmentation of this vital national effort—the 
absence of a comprehensive, coherent strategy to deal with the terrorist threat to 
homeland security—leads to misdirection and waste of national resources.
It is to this absence of strategy to deal effectively with the terrorist threat that 
the chapters in this volume have been written. We do not pretend to present a fully 
developed homeland security strategy for dealing with terrorist threats. The aim 
here is modest. It is only to identify the domestic and external elements that need 
to be addressed in developing such a strategy. A comprehensive strategy specifies 
objectives, identifies human and material resources that need to be allocated to these 
purposes, links the “away game” well beyond U.S. shores to the domestic agenda 
of things that need to be done in the “home game,” and seeks allies and coalition 
partners in a multilateral quest to secure homelands from terrorist threats.
No strategy, however well developed and carefully implemented, can ever 
provide perfect security from any threat. At the same time, the perfect need not 
stand as an obstacle to the good. Strategy that effectively ties domestic and external 
resources to specified objectives can reduce substantially the level of threat that 
otherwise would be faced. It must also be dynamic—open to modifications as cir-
cumstances change.
Governments take steps to provide increased security by increasing intelligence 
and law-enforcement measures that tend to compromise individual privacy, due 
process, and other rights and liberties. A central objective in any homeland security 
strategy, then, is to sustain civil liberties and human rights so essential to life in 
democratic societies. Put another way, the difficult strategic challenge is to opti-
mize security subject to the constraint of minimizing infringement on rights and 
liberties.

xvi  n  Preface
In Part 1, seven of our authors address in five chapters the central problem of 
developing strategy for homeland security. Four other members of our team take up 
terrorist threats in two chapters in Part 2 on the strategic challenge of nuclear, bio-
logical, chemical, and radiological weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Finally, 
in Part 3, six contributors in five chapters on strategy go beyond WMD to the 
broader context of safeguarding society and its infrastructure not only from ter-
rorists, but also natural disasters. Finally, two of our coeditors step back from the 
project and draw some preliminary conclusions in this stage of what has become 
an ongoing project.
Indeed, the project began in January 2000 at a conference on homeland defense 
hosted at the National War College by Professor Bard O’Neill. Professors Joseph 
Szyliowicz and Paul Viotti brought this back to the center of the homeland where 
the Denver Council on Foreign Relations (DCFR) and the Institute on Globaliza-
tion and Security (IGLOS) at the University of Denver agreed to host a series of 
three workshops on homeland security beginning in the spring of 2000 and com-
pleted a year later. Well prior to 9/11, citizen participants in these workshops even 
anticipated that terrorists might use airplanes as a high-explosive device against 
buildings, an inference drawn from an earlier, failed effort to hijack an Air France 
plane in Paris and fly it into the Eiffel Tower. These workshops have continued 
since 9/11 to take up transportation, immigration, and other homeland security 
challenges.
The team of policy-oriented scholars who have contributed to this volume 
initially came together from the United States and Canada at an August 2004 
seminar in honor of the late Colorado College political science professor, Fred A. 
Sondermann, held at the University of Denver’s Graduate School of International 
Studies and cosponsored by IGLOS, DCFR, and the Army War College. A prin-
cipal finding in a consensus report identified the absence of an effective strategy to 
guide policy makers tasked with making and implementing decisions on homeland 
security, and resulted in an agreement to write the chapters in this volume. Our 
purpose is limited here to identifying the problem and elements that would be part 
of a comprehensive strategy in the hope of advancing not only the policy-related 
academic discourse, but also to assist in some way those we and our fellow citizens 
put in authority to make decisions so essential to securing the homeland.

Chapter 1
Toward a Comprehensive 
Strategy for Terrorism 
and Homeland Security
Paul R. Viotti
Setting the stage for the chapters that follow, the author 
laments the absence of a coherent strategy—one that 
would be both comprehensive and dynamic—to guide 
policy makers tasked with securing the homeland. A 
causal analysis of terrorism as a tactic—one form of 
political violence in a set of choices made by the lead-
ership and conducted by the organizational elements 
of various groups, movements, or insurgencies—brings 
us to root causes that lie in the grievances that motivate 
and sustain popular support for such actions. A com-
prehensive strategy, then, is necessarily broad in scope. 
Part of the strategic effort, of course, takes the familiar 
form of preventive and defensive measures—relying on 
intelligence for early warning and to assist law-enforce-
ment agents to arrest those planning attacks or oth-
erwise blunting their efforts; establishing detection 
devices and mechanisms in public places, in transit and 
at airports, seaports, and other transportation terminals; 
planning for damage limitation not only of transporta-

  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
tion, but also of telecommunications, energy, water and 
food supply networks, and other critical infrastructure; 
and organizing, training, and equipping first responders 
and others at federal, state, and local levels for effective 
consequence management.
Beyond these and other domestic measures—the 
“home game” designed to deal with the terrorist threat 
on the effects side, a comprehensive strategy also 
addresses the causal side, which typically shifts one’s 
strategic focus abroad to the “away game”—how griev-
ances (whether real or imagined, just or unjust) in a 
population lead to the formation of (and help sustain) 
groups, movements, or insurgencies. These entities 
typically have purposes or objectives with identifiable 
leadership, ideological, and organizational elements. 
Given this understanding, we face a set of strategic 
questions about what is to be done on the causal side: 
(1) What can or should be done about grievances? (2) Is 
there any value to be found in communicating with the 
leaderships of these entities either directly or through 
third parties? (3) Are there effective ways to counter 
the ideological appeals or material benefit they offer 
their followers? (4) How feasible is it—what capabilities 
exist—to attack these operatives or effectively disrupt 
their organizations and activities? (5) Before we act, can 
we make a realistic net assessment of whether mea-
sures under consideration likely will weaken or reduce 
the threat posed—the intended consequence—or, con-
versely, whether such measures likely will backfire or 
be counterproductive—strengthening these groups, 
movements, or insurgencies and thus undermining 
the antiterrorism effort? The answers to such ques-
tions likely will vary over time, which underscores why 
any effective homeland security strategy also must be 
dynamic—responsive to changes in circumstances.
Finally, in democratic societies, strategies for home-
land security try to minimize adverse impacts on civil 
liberties and other human rights that are challenged by 
domestic intelligence gathering and law-enforcement 
measures. More than just assuring physical security, a 
comprehensive homeland security strategy also seeks 
to secure the liberties and rights the people hold dear.

Comprehensive Strategy for Terrorism and Homeland Security  n  
Homeland security strategy—the focal point of the chapters in this volume—is in 
the broadest understanding a response to threats of all kinds, although the focus 
in the United States since 9/11 primarily has been on the real-and-present dangers 
of terrorist attacks. The authors in this volume are responding to what they see as 
strategic deficiencies in thinking about homeland security—the apparent absence 
of coherent strategy, not to mention one that is comprehensive, dynamic, and an 
effective guide policy makers can use for dealing with terrorist or other threats to the 
homeland. The central question contributors to this volume undertake is the strate-
gic quest—an exploration of factors central to the formulation and implementation 
of a comprehensive and dynamic homeland security strategy responsive to changes 
in threats posed to the United States. Terrorism as a form of political violence is the 
principal threat we consider in this volume, although we also take account of natu-
ral disasters that inform consideration of all hazards (or all consequences) regardless 
of whether the causes are human or due to natural phenomena.
At the federal level the domestic aspects of securing the United States are the 
primary domain of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and military 
and related intelligence “turf” is reserved for the Department of Defense (DoD), to 
include the Defense Intelligence and National Security Agencies (DIA and NSA) 
and the Army and Air National Guard when called into national service. We need 
not be confined here, however, by a bureaucratic definition of homeland security as 
if it were limited only to the domestic turf of the U.S. DHS, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA), the Coast Guard, and other DHS component agen-
cies. Nor need homeland defense as a term be reserved to the operations of the U.S. 
DoD at home and abroad. These bureaucratic definitions reflect an important divi-
sion of labor between two cabinet departments, but omit the roles played by other 
federal agencies or cabinet departments—for example, the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the departments of State 
and Treasury—not to mention an array of state and local police and emergency-
management agencies that include first responders.
Setting these bureaucratic understandings aside, in this volume we take a broad, 
strategic view of homeland security—a focus on the ways and means of securing the 
homeland from terrorism or other threats and natural disasters. The “home game” 
and the “away game” necessarily come together in any comprehensive strategy 
that includes both domestic and external courses of action. As a practical matter, 
then, the distinction between homeland security and homeland defense that serves 
bureaucratic purposes is less important analytically to the strategist. Although 
in common parlance the two terms often are used interchangeably, the former (a 
broader term) may be seen typically as encompassing the latter. In this regard, we 
adopt homeland security in its broadest meaning—providing safety from threats to 
the nation by taking steps toward this end both at home and abroad.
We define terror as the rational or purposive use of the “irrational”—fear or 
other intimidating effects on people—in an effort to accomplish political or other 
purposes.1 We are most concerned here with terrorism when it takes the form of 

  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
politically motivated violence that threatens the homeland. As such, terror may be 
produced by purposive use of violence, but populations may also be terrorized by 
other, nonviolent means. Soviet show-trial purges conducted in the 1930s under 
Stalin, for example, spread fear not only among communist party members, but 
also within the population as a whole. The “knock on the door” by the police 
and the arrests that followed (whether in the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany) sent 
strong messages designed to scare people into compliance with the expectations or 
mandates of party or regime—state terror in oppressive, but not necessarily violent, 
form.
Lest we run the risk that virtually all forms of political violence be regarded 
incorrectly as terrorism or the work of terrorists, we need to differentiate terror ana-
lytically from other forms of political violence—guerrilla warfare (typically hit-and-
run tactics), insurrection or popular uprising (as in the Palestinian Intifada) that 
usually becomes violent, sectarian, or intercommunal (as in tribal, clan, national, or 
ethnic) strife, civil war between competing parties for control of the state, and com-
bat between regular military units. Unless we limit the meaning of terror by dif-
ferentiating it from these other forms of violence, terror can be construed to mean 
virtually everything. If the term terror comes to mean so many things, in practice 
it means little or nothing. Our aim here, by contrast, is to preserve the analytical 
meaning of terror or terrorism. Indeed, if terror is a principal threat to the security 
of the homeland, then we need to be clear about what we are addressing.
Even as we limit the term terror as a tactic—one form of political violence dif-
ferentiated analytically from other forms, we do not see it as limited to use by or 
against civilians or nongovernmental groups, movements, or insurgencies.2 If the 
aim is to intimidate or cause fear in one’s adversary—governmental or nongovern-
mental—we are in the domain of terrorism whether perpetrated by or against the 
state. By defining the term this way, we depart from those who see terrorism as 
directed or limited only to civilian populations. When violence is directed toward 
military or other governmental personnel with the intent to cause fear or intimida-
tion, we may speak of it as terror.
Intent matters. People may suffer intimidation or be fearful, particularly when 
they find themselves in or near combat operations, but this does not in itself consti-
tute the use of terror. If nearby aerial or other bombardment rattles one’s windows, 
one may be terrorized even though the perpetrators of this violence were merely 
attacking legitimate military targets. Only if the use of violence is part of a plan or 
design to foment fear or create intimidating effects on a people may we refer to it 
as a terrorist tactic.
Indeed, one has to be careful not to confuse other forms of violence with ter-
rorism. Just because soldiers on both sides may experience the intimidating effects 
of the use of force in combat, this does not make combat a terrorist incident unless 
intimidation was the effect intended by one side or the other. Military actions are 
usually intended to destroy or substantially weaken an enemy’s war-making capa-

Comprehensive Strategy for Terrorism and Homeland Security  n  7
bility. Such actions become terrorist incidents only when the intent is to intimidate, 
cause fear, or terrorize an adversary.
We return, then, to our basic definition of terrorism—the rational or purpo-
sive use of the “irrational”—fear or other intimidating effects on a people—in an 
effort to accomplish political or other purposes. Although most terrorist acts are 
politically motivated, in some cases other nonpolitical causes may be served by 
this intentional use of fear. One can argue, for example, that the 1995 sarin gas 
attack by Aum Shinrikyo in the subway in Tokyo was politically motivated against 
the Japanese government, local police, or other government officials, but another 
nonpolitical motive may be found in the extreme religious beliefs of this cult that 
defined itself by the term supreme truth.
Although the precise motive or motives for the attack remain in dispute, the 
incident reminds us that the threat of terrorism is not confined to external sources, 
but may well be caused by domestic actors responding to grievances of one kind or 
another and intending to terrorize their victims. Indeed, in the same year as these 
sarin attacks in Japan, the United States experienced a massive domestic terrorist 
bombing attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Perpetrated by three 
American citizens directly involved in the conspiracy, the attacks killed 168 peo-
ple and injured more than 800 others. The conspirators allegedly were motivated 
by revenge for violent government actions taken in 1992 against a white separatist 
group at Ruby Ridge in northern Idaho in 1992 and in 1993 against the “Branch 
Davidian” religious cult near Waco, Texas. Apart from massive deaths, physical 
harm to survivors, and destruction of a building, it was the intent to terrorize gov-
ernment employees, their families, and the general population that constituted this 
as a domestic terrorist incident.
In developing strategy for homeland security in relation to terrorist threats, 
we certainly look for domestic remedies as in providing better intelligence and 
early warning of attacks, maintaining detection in transit and at airports and other 
transportation nodes or terminals, and developing and exercising plans for damage 
limitation and consequence management conducted by well equipped and trained 
first responders. We do not confine ourselves, however, to domestic remedies—the 
“home game.” We also look abroad to find effective ways of dealing with the source 
of terrorist threats, taking into account the grievances that lead to the formation 
of groups, movements, or insurgencies that adopt violent tactics to advance their 
causes—the “away game.” Thus, coping with terrorism at home and abroad is 
essential to securing and defending the homeland. An effective strategy for home-
land security, then, incorporates approaches to reducing the threat of terrorism by 
taking actions both domestically and externally.
We make no pretense here to present a fully developed homeland-security strat-
egy applicable to the United States or other countries. What the essays in this 
volume do collectively, however, is to identify the elements we see as essential to 
developing a comprehensive and dynamic strategy for homeland security. Although 
our primary focus in this volume is on the United States, we see these understand-

  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
ings of homeland-security strategy as also having application to the strategic dis-
course pursued in other countries. Finally, we place homeland security as a small 
but essential component within a broader context of national-security or grand 
strategies that are well beyond the scope of our more modest effort in this volume.
To construct a strategic blueprint for homeland security we need first to identify 
the causes for terrorist and other forms of political violence. Typically, these lie in 
the grievances a population may hold against the target toward which a terrorist 
group directs its violent actions. Put another way, the interests of those using politi-
cal violence matter if we are to understand why they resort to terrorism or some 
other form of political violence.
Identifying the groups, movements, or insurgencies drawn from this popula-
tion is the next step, specifying their links to each other and to the popular support 
each enjoys. Crucial to both strategists and policy makers is access to reliable intel-
ligence estimates—accurate data and realistic assessments of these movements or 
groups, their leaderships, ideologies, and organizational structures and processes. 
Understanding what strategy or strategies these groups, movements, or insurgen-
cies may be pursuing is essential to designing effective counterstrategies. One needs 
to specify the purposes or objectives these movements or groups are pursuing, the 
capabilities or means they possess, and the methods or tactics they apply to the 
objectives they seek to achieve.
Some entities may be relatively isolated, whereas others are more broadly based 
movements with sufficient popular support to be called insurgencies. Methods or 
tactics may include various forms of nonviolent political actions as well as one or 
more of the following: insurrections or popular uprisings that may become violent, 
calculated acts of violence intended to produce terror in target populations, irregu-
lar or guerrilla warfare tactics, civil war or, when a group, movement, or insurgency 
enjoys state support, violence may rise to the level of regular or interstate warfare.
Strategizing is not about a “war on terror” or any particular tactic or method. 
It is instead directed toward the groups, movements, or insurgencies responsible 
for violent actions, as well as the grievances in the populations on which their sup-
port rests. One can focus on reducing popular grievances causally related to those 
choosing violent activities. In some instances, communicating with the leadership 
or emissaries of these groups, movements, or insurgencies directly (or through third 
parties) may be part of an effective counterstrategy; in other instances the effort 
is to capture or remove the leaders or other violent actors in these movements or 
groups or to find ways to disrupt their organizations and activities. A most impor-
tant caveat, however, is the necessity of making a realistic net assessment of mea-
sures under consideration—whether they likely will weaken or reduce the threat 
posed (the intended consequence) or, conversely, whether such measures likely 
will backfire or be counterproductive—strengthening these groups, movements, 
or insurgencies and thus undermining the antiterrorism effort (an adverse albeit 
unintended consequence).

Comprehensive Strategy for Terrorism and Homeland Security  n  
Finally, effective counterstrategies employ intelligence and other detection mea-
sures for early warning or, if possible, prevention of violent actions—intelligence 
that assists law-enforcement agents arresting those planning attacks or otherwise 
blunting their efforts. Also essential is advance planning both to limit damage to 
transportation, telecommunications, energy, water and food supply networks, and 
other critical infrastructure and to manage consequences—employing well trained 
and equipped first responders and other officials at federal, state, and local levels. 
In democratic societies, strategies for homeland security try to minimize adverse 
impacts on civil liberties and other human rights that are challenged by domes-
tic intelligence gathering and law-enforcement measures. More than just assuring 
physical security, a comprehensive homeland security strategy also seeks to secure 
the liberties and rights the people hold dear.
Strategy and the Strategic Discourse
We start this strategic discourse with important definitions and distinctions. By 
strategy we mean the ways or modalities by which we link capabilities or means we 
have or can generate to the ends, purposes, or objectives we seek. In doing so we are 
best served when we have a causal understanding of what is at issue—the relations 
among the factors or variables we identify as central to the problem. Strategizing is 
a highly rational, analytic process, but one fraught with significant challenges.
Clausewitz understood fully the problem of uncertainty with which strategists 
and policymakers must grapple. Even the most developed strategies and strategic 
plans still encounter the obstacles or real-world friction when put into action.3 In 
combat one also encounters enormous uncertainties as circumstances change so 
rapidly that one may not be aware of essential details about what is happening—the 
fog of war.4 Testing strategies and the plans that one derives from them by conduct-
ing exercises is one remedy for uncovering errors and identifying what needs to be 
corrected. Maintaining strategic discourse as an open process that welcomes both 
logical and empirical critique of existing strategies and strategic plans is another 
way to reduce the likelihood of errors that can thwart the attainment of objectives 
or, in the case of homeland security, result in catastrophic consequences.
A careful reading of Clausewitz leads one to conclude how important humil-
ity is as a tempering factor in strategic discourse. The strategist needs always to be 
aware that there may be flaws in the causal analysis, not to mention data prob-
lems—seeking an accurate take on the relevant facts. The aim is at once not just to 
be comprehensive—including all relevant factors in the strategic analysis, but also 
parsimonious—excluding unnecessary or tangential factors that obscure the stra-
tegic view of how to apply means or capabilities to increase the likelihood of goal 
attainment. Given uncertainties in causal analysis, data problems, and the reality of 
changing circumstances, effective strategizing necessarily is a dynamic process—a 
willingness to make necessary changes in strategy even as events unfold. Although 

10  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
one may long for greater certainty, strategists (as with other theorists) deal effec-
tively with reality when informed by what James Rosenau calls a “high tolerance 
for ambiguity.”5
Uncertainties are also a part of the strategist’s continuous quest to match means 
to ends. Serious, perhaps devastating, consequences result when capabilities fall 
short of what we need to reach the objectives we have set. The obvious, but difficult 
(and often painful) remedy for mismatch between means and ends is to enhance the 
former, to trim or scale back the latter, or both to expand capabilities and to alter 
objectives until the two coincide. Failure to attend to strategic mismatch—trying 
to do more with less—more often than not is a prescription for defeat.
Indeed, the strategist has to be careful not to overestimate what a given (or 
enhanced) set of capabilities realistically can achieve. To pursue (or continue to 
pursue) a course of action when capabilities are known to be on the short side is 
effectively to gamble that somehow one has underestimated strategically what it 
takes to reach objectives. Strategists and the policy makers they inform ought not 
take such unnecessary risks. It is better not to undertake a course of action in the 
first place if one is either unable or unwilling to match or surpass the level of capa-
bilities required. This is certainly the case when one is considering the use of force. 
As Clausewitz counseled, one ought to be careful about taking the first step into 
war without considering where the (subsequent or) last steps are likely to lead.6
Terrorism and other Forms of Political Violence
Terrorist attacks are best understood as calculated events perpetrated most effec-
tively by adversaries who seek strategically to attain particular objectives by such 
means. Indeed, as noted above, terrorism is the rational use of the “irrational” or 
intimidating effects of nonviolent or violent actions—the latter including use of 
explosive devices, assassinations, or other destructive means for political or other 
purposes. Again, it is this intent to use violence or other means for their intimidat-
ing effects that makes a particular act a terrorist one. Both act and intent matter if 
we are correctly to apply the term terrorism. Terrorism is a tactic that can be used 
in conjunction with other forms of political violence, but it still stands as a separate 
category.
Effective strategizing on the ways and means for dealing with groups, move-
ments, or insurgencies that use terrorist or other forms of political violence requires 
analytical clarity. As discussed above, if we do not draw this analytical distinction 
all forms of violence suddenly become terrorist incidents. Put another way, we need 
not focus on the perpetrators of all forms of violence because doing so unnecessar-
ily complicates the formulation of an effective strategy for dealing with those who 
engage primarily in terrorist activities.
Calling such engagement a “war on terror” is an unfortunate misnomer. 
Whatever its value for public relations purposes, such terminology leads us away 

Comprehensive Strategy for Terrorism and Homeland Security  n  11
from focus on the groups, movements, or insurgencies that employ terrorist tac-
tics. Indeed, uncritical use of such terms may reflect the shallow depth of strategic 
thought underlying policies pursued. One does not wage war against a tactic; one 
wages war against those who use such tactics. Efforts are taken to undermine their 
domestic and external bases of support—populations as well as states or non-state 
actors. This is not a trivial distinction or legerdemain designed to score debating 
points. Effective strategizing for homeland security requires focus on the causes and 
producers of the terrorist effect, not just the effect itself.
Policy on homeland security should flow from strategy that is both compre-
hensive and dynamic. Without guidance from strategic thought, policy typically 
becomes little more than incrementalism without clear objectives—in effect react-
ing to current events instead of charting a logical, coherent course of action to 
achieve national goals. Muddling through without strategy or direction may come 
at great human and financial cost, whether engaging in war abroad or taking actions 
domestically to prevent or manage the consequences of political violence.
Intelligence, Law Enforcement, Civil 
Liberties, and Human Rights
Intelligence is a core part of the strategic design—knowing about the leadership, 
organization, and composition of followers, their popular support base, the sources 
of external support, and the ideologies, strategies, locations, and operations of the 
groups, movements, or insurgencies employing terrorist and other forms of politi-
cal violence. Early warning of terrorist events and other actions from signals intel-
ligence or human-source reporting can be decisive in successful prevention efforts. 
Collection of such intelligence from external sources is well established and gener-
ally accepted.
On the other hand, the expansion of domestic surveillance does pose a civil lib-
erties challenge, particularly to privacy rights. If not reduced, much less eliminated, 
such intrusions are managed when subject to effective legislative oversight; judicial 
review is another check as in the issuance of warrants that conform to specified 
criteria allowing law enforcement or domestic intelligence collection actions by 
government agencies. Executive authorities are prone to claim, however, that mech-
anisms for such management are problematic, particularly given the large flow of 
timely information deemed essential to providing the adequate warning they need 
to prevent incidents of political violence from occurring.
Shortly after the 9/11 attack, Congress broadened executive law-enforcement and 
domestic-surveillance authority by passage of the Patriot Act, an amended version 
of which subsequently has been renewed. Feeding the domestic civil liberties-home-
land security debate are such disclosures as entry by law-enforcement officials into 
private residences or offices without warrants (so-called “sneak-and-peak” inspec-

12  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
tions); requests for library, business, and other records; collection of data on financial 
transfers; and widespread use of signals intelligence—intercepting, monitoring, or 
tracking domestic communications without warrants or other statutory authority. 
Massive government collection of information—dubbed by some as “total infor-
mation awareness”—goes well beyond customary practice. For its part, Congress 
has been slow to curb expansive use of executive authority for homeland security 
purposes.
We are left with the question of where should we strike the classic balance 
between liberty (to include privacy) on the one hand and security through domes-
tic surveillance and law-enforcement intrusions on the other. Some pretend that 
there is no necessary conflict between liberty and provisions for security, but our 
experience tells us otherwise. Moreover, what assurances are there that law-enforce-
ment and intelligence mechanisms will afford equal treatment to all groups, not 
categorizing certain national, ethnic, or religious groups of citizens as inherently 
suspect?
Whatever may be the justification for legally sanctioned infringements on civil 
liberties in the short-term interest of providing security, there is no similar rationale 
for unequal treatment of people in society. Racial, ethnic, or religious “profiling” 
not only singles out individuals unfairly, but also tends to mislead, divert, and thus 
waste law-enforcement and intelligence-collection resources from targets toward 
which strategically they would better be directed.
Security (which can itself be considered a human right) is as vital in society as is 
protection of civil liberties and other human rights. The strategist necessarily incor-
porates these considerations as a constraining criterion in any society that places 
value not only on security, but also on other rights or liberties. Any strategy for 
homeland security thus takes these liberties and rights into explicit consideration, 
minimizing adverse impacts on any of them.
Figure 1.1 depicts in simplified form the classic political understanding that 
the more police and law enforcement (or intelligence gathering) for purposes 
of order or security, the less liberty citizens will enjoy in a particular society. 
The downward sloping line shown in the graph is the locus of points in which 
liberty and order or security are maximized in a given society. The inverse rela-
tion between the two variables is readily apparent. As one moves from point A 
to point B, one increases order or security by the quantity shown between points 
O1 and O2 on the x-axis, but decreases liberty by the quantity shown between 
points L1 and L2 on the y-axis. If law-enforcement and other security measures 
taken in a period of national peril effectively drive the liberty-order trade-off 
nominally from Point A to Point B, the strategic challenge is somehow to keep 
such infringements on liberty from becoming permanent intrusions. Moving 
back up the curve to Point A or above is the obvious objective for those who 
value civil liberties.

Causal Understandings Related to Formulating 
Homeland Security Strategy
Strategy on homeland security has tended in practice to focus on the last part of 
the causal chain—how to maximize warning so as to prevent or thwart a terrorist 
attack and, if an attack occurs, how to manage consequences and limit or mitigate 
damages to lives and property. These are obviously important parts of a compre-
hensive strategy, but strategy for homeland security ought to begin on the other 
end of the causal chain—addressing what causes or induces groups, movements, or 
insurgencies to form and then what leads them to foment terrorist acts. Identifying 
populations that support the groups, movements, or insurgencies prone to use ter-
rorism and other forms of political violence is where strategizing about homeland 
security should begin. Figure 1.2 depicts a causal understanding of the sources of 
Figure 1.1  Opportunity costs: trade-offs between liberty and order or secu-
rity. Note that both the slope and straightness of the line in this figure are only 
for illustrative purposes. A steeper slope would indicate a larger opportunity 
cost for liberty as each additional “unit” of order or security comes at a higher 
liberty price; a more gradual slope would indicate a lesser liberty price for 
increased order or security. The actual trade-off between liberty and order 
or security may be curvilinear. Moreover, the curve may also vary within a 
society if intelligence gathering and law-enforcement measures are not applied 
equally to people of all classes, ethnicities, or other identities. Finally, the line 
or curve is a statement of maximum liberty and order or security for a society 
at a given point in time; the society may well be operating at some point below 
the line—a suboptimal point in which both security and order are less than 
what they could be.

terrorism and other forms of political violence that can be used in the development 
of counterstrategy directed against those groups, movements, or insurgencies that 
threaten homeland security.
Societal Grievances as a Cause of Terrorism 
and Other Forms of Political Violence
One focal point is to attend to interests—the grievances, real or imagined, just or 
unjust that motivate the formation of these groups, movements, or insurgencies 
that employ political violence as a means to accomplish their goals. The strategist 
understands that violence is a political phenomenon typically grounded in social or 
societal grievances. As such, various forms of political violence are means intended 
to achieve objectives consistent with the interests of those employing such tactics. 
The remedy (or set of remedies) is to be found in a political approach to a political 
phenomenon of which military action is at most only a part.
Dealing with or accommodating grievances and thus undermining the popular 
support base of those employing political violence is, of course, a most difficult, 
often very frustrating task to undertake. Quite apart from “winning hearts and 
minds” in an aggrieved population—a rather high, perhaps impossible bar to reach, 
one can take strategically a more modest approach of doing what one realistically 
can accomplish—or at least avoiding measures that make matters worse.
An important part of any strategy intended to serve homeland security is work-
ing directly with (not dictating to) the political and other leaders in Afghanistan,

Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, or any society beset by political violence (or from which 
groups, movements, or insurgencies using political violence operate). Such efforts 
should be directed not just toward incumbents in national and local government 
offices, but also to the leaders of tribes, clans, and other relevant communities in a 
particular country. By contrast, arbitrary actions, prison abuses, draconian interro-
gation techniques, and torture of prisoners or detainees undermine moral authority 
and produce or accentuate grievances directed against the United States or any other 
country using such means.
The brutality associated with intracity warfare—the seemingly impossible task 
of sparing noncombatants even when one tries—is also a major grievance producer 
that tends to advantage one’s adversaries. By no means can military force in such 
circumstances be seen as a precise instrument that can be employed as if it were a 
scalpel in the hands of a surgeon. Indeed, military force is a rather blunt instru-
ment at best that if used, particularly against targets in urban areas, likely will pro-
duce collateral death and destruction that further aggrieves a population and thus 
strengthens one’s adversaries. Those who justify such tactics as shows of strength 
that local people allegedly will “respect” miss the larger, adverse implications of 
such policies.
By contrast, progress on the large issues can reduce popular support for those 
prone to use political violence. For example, gains in the prolonged peace process 
in Northern Ireland have met with some success in reducing political violence, as 
have efforts in the Basque region of northwest Spain. In these cases, diplomacy and 
more localized social efforts are an important part of conflict management, if not 
full resolution of conflict.
In the Middle East this strategic approach requires genuine and unrelenting 
work on the multiple dimensions of Arab (particularly Palestinian)-Israeli and Ira-
nian-Israeli conflicts, notwithstanding numerous setbacks and the enormous frus-
trations that can lead to abandonment of such efforts. Although diplomats have 
an instrumental purpose and role to play, enhanced U.S. and other foreign mili-
tary presence is a grievance that feeds popular support for groups, movements, and 
insurgencies prone to use political violence. Security conditions may require strong 
military presence of foreign forces (and some local governments may request it as 
essential to defending or maintaining their regimes), but any strategy needs to take 
full account of the downside risks associated with such deployments. In this regard, 
use of sufficiently manned and properly equipped multilateral forces under UN 
or other international organization auspices are generally more acceptable to local 
populations, thus tending to reduce to some degree the downside risks to the forces 
of particular countries.
Perhaps the most difficult cause of grievances to address is the impact of glo-
balization that challenges traditional societies and their leaders. Advances in trans-
portation and telecommunications technologies have enabled external intrusions 
on long-established traditions and practices. Beyond whatever benefits they may 
bring, outsiders are sometimes portrayed as exploiting labor and fouling the local 

16  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
environment. Most threatening of all to local leaders, of course, are the liberal-
izing or democratic ideas outsiders bring to the people in these countries, which 
are seen as legitimizing challenges to existing authorities. The ways and means of 
avoiding unnecessary intrusions are extraordinarily difficult to implement, particu-
larly given genuine external concerns with human rights. Making matters worse is 
when these intrusions are celebrated by outside countries as advancing democracy 
or liberal values, but are understood locally as poorly disguised attempts at external 
dominance.
Groups, Movements, or Insurgencies Using Political Violence
Another strategic focal point is on the groups, movements, or insurgencies that use 
one or more forms of political violence: (1) insurrections or uprisings that likely will 
become violent, (2) terror tactics (high explosives, assassinations, or other actions 
intended to intimidate people), (3) guerrilla (typically hit-and-run) tactics against 
government authorities or occupying forces, (4) intrastate or civil wars directed 
against these domestic authorities or occupying powers, and (5) interstate wars 
provoked when state-supported movements or insurgencies conduct actions against 
other states. We need to understand that groups, movements, or insurgencies likely 
are led by strategists in their own right (or leaders informed by strategists) who 
rationally choose to employ one or another of these tactics as part of their own 
strategies.
Empathetic analysis of an enemy and its strategy is essential if counterstrategies 
are to have any chance of being effective. In this regard, it is important to under-
score that empathetic is not sympathetic analysis. Putting oneself in the shoes of a 
rational adversary, particularly if one despises the ways and means of this adversary, 
is not easy to do. But how else are we to anticipate what such an adversary is likely 
to do? How are we to craft effective counterstrategies if we do not recognize the 
rationality and strategic orientation of adversaries bent on using terrorism or other 
forms of political violence?
One can, of course, target the leadership and participants in these groups, move-
ments, or insurgencies while seeking to avoid or minimize harm to the populations 
from which they are drawn. Indeed, grievances in a population are typically rein-
forced or enhanced when military or police actions are directed against or inadver-
tently hurt people who may be supportive of but are not direct participants in the 
groups, movements, or insurgencies responsible for taking violent actions. Unfor-
tunately, limiting countermeasures to leaders and direct participants is extraordi-
narily difficult, which raises serious strategic questions about the efficacy of such 
measures. One has to weigh very carefully the ways, means, and often unintended 
effects of military and police measures that exacerbate or multiply grievances or 
disaffection in a population upon which these groups, movements, or insurgencies 

Comprehensive Strategy for Terrorism and Homeland Security  n  17
so heavily depend. It can hardly be considered wise to pursue such tactics without 
discrimination when the net effect is to strengthen not weaken one’s opponent.
Circumstances or opportunities may arise for direct or indirect (through third 
parties), usually clandestine, communications if not with the high command, then 
perhaps with the leaders of at least some of the groups linked to the movements 
or insurgencies at issue. In the popular mind one does not deal with unsavory ele-
ments, but strategists and those who make or implement policy ought not be so 
constrained. If one is thinking and acting strategically, one does not rule out this 
option without careful consideration of both its merits and possible hazards. It 
may be possible, for example, to draw some groups away and thus weaken to some 
degree a network prone to engage in terrorist acts.
Finally, our strategic focus shifts to what can be done in advance not only to 
provide early warning that hopefully can foil a planned attack, but also to limit 
damages and manage consequences when attacks occur. Timely intelligence and 
detection mechanisms in transit and at airports, seaports, and other transportation 
nodes, as well as in telecommunications, energy, water and food supply networks, 
and other critical infrastructure are essential if we are to prevent violent acts from 
occurring. A dynamic, comprehensive strategy for dealing with the terrorist threat 
to homeland security thus takes account of both cause and effect at home and 
abroad and is open to modification as circumstances change.

Chapter 2
The Search for National 
and Homeland Security
An Integrated Grand Strategy
Robert H. Dorff
The United States lacks a reasonably clear and mean-
ingful grand strategy that would effectively integrate 
the requirements for both national and homeland secu-
rity. Moreover, the author also concludes that the abil-
ity to implement that strategy through the appropriate 
application of the proper elements of power has been 
seriously hampered. In developing his argument, Dorff 
defines strategy in terms of three core concepts–ends, 
ways, and means. In this regard his treatment of the 
elements of strategy complements and expands upon 
the discussion in Chapter 1. He focuses our attention 
on the strategic challenges faced by both the Clinton 
and Bush administrations, finding response-driven, ad 
hoc policies to counterterrorism and homeland secu-
rity, neither of which is integrated as part of a true grand 
strategy. In this regard, emphasis has been more on mil-
itary actions instead of a much-needed comprehensive 
strategic approach that incorporates all instruments of 
policy.

20  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The global security environment is a complex variety of potential threats emanating 
from an even wider array of actors. Confronting those threats and dealing effec-
tively with them comprise the core challenges for security policy and strategy. The 
profound transformation of the security environment that accompanied the end of 
the Cold War and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union called into ques-
tion many of the assumptions that guided U.S. national security policy and strat-
egy for more than half of the last century. And the tragic events of September 11, 
2001 placed the stark reality of that transformation squarely in front of us. Yet even 
for the casual observer of contemporary international security affairs, it is apparent 
that U.S. security policy and strategy have not fully adjusted to this fundamentally 
transformed environment in which security of the homeland has become an urgent, 
even greater national priority than before.
That is not to say that the United States has remained idle during more than 
a decade and a half since the end of the Cold War. From the decisions that led up 
to the Gulf War in 1990 to 1991 to the ongoing Balkan crises and the “war on 
terrorism” in Afghanistan and now in Iraq, there has been no paucity of responses 
to international security challenges. By almost any measure, the instruments of 
U.S. security policy and strategy, especially the military, are employed more today 
than at any time in post-World War II history. But the problem goes well beyond 
meeting wartime obligations, transforming the military, employing other instru-
ments of national power, or even increasing the defense budget. The real underly-
ing problem is, in fact, the absence of a reasonably clear and meaningful grand 
strategy for dealing with the contemporary security environment, one that would 
effectively integrate the requirements for both national and homeland security. And 
even when we have come close to having that overarching strategy, our ability as 
a country to implement that strategy through the appropriate application of the 
proper elements of power has been seriously hampered by some critical problems 
that we must address if we are to be successful in the future.
For the purposes of our analysis we can focus on the two most recent U.S. 
presidents—Bill Clinton and George W. Bush—and their attempts to address this 
overarching security challenge.1 Because each won re-election to a second term, 
these two presidents and their administrations span virtually all of the post-Gulf 
War I period (at the time of this writing). So we will limit this relatively brief 
assessment of U.S. national security strategy to these two presidents. We begin 
this chapter with an examination of the basic elements of strategy. We then turn 
to a general consideration of strategy formulation before addressing an assessment 
of how (and even whether) U.S. national security strategy has evolved from the 
time Bill Clinton first took office in January 1993 to roughly June 2007, nearing 
the final year of the George W. Bush presidency. Finally, we conclude with some 
observations about the necessity for generating an integrated grand strategy that 
addresses both national and homeland security, and some of the challenges we face 
in our efforts to do so.

The Search for National and Homeland Security  n  21
The Basic Elements of Strategy
In simple terms strategy is the calculated relationship among ends, ways, and 
means. Ends are the objectives or goals sought. Means are the resources available to 
pursue the objectives. And ways are the concepts or methods for how one organizes 
and applies the resources. Each of these components suggests a related question. 
What (ends) do we want to pursue? With what (means) will we pursue them? And 
how (in what ways) will we pursue them?	
In addition to these three core concepts—ends, ways, and means—we must 
also understand some essential principles of strategy. First, when it comes to strat-
egy, ends clearly matter. They matter because strategy is meaningful only in terms 
of the objectives sought. One does not simply “do” strategy; one decides on and 
pursues objectives strategically. One can evaluate the success or failure of a strategy 
only in terms of how it fared in the pursuit of those objectives. Second, selecting 
the proper objective is more important than selecting the proper way in which to 
use the means. This is much like the difference between efficiency and effective-
ness, with efficiency defined as “doing things right” and effectiveness defined as 
“doing the right things.” Whereas most of us would like to be both effective and 
efficient and whereas both are important to overall success, in the end effectiveness 
is more important. Why? Because spending our time very efficiently doing the 
wrong things will not lead to success. Doing the right things only half as efficiently 
will still get us further down the road toward the desired objective. But if you get 
the ends wrong, it is quite simply impossible to get the strategy right. If the ends are 
wrong, no amount of tinkering with the ways and means will fix the strategy.2
At the same time, however, simply getting the ends right does not in and of 
itself guarantee success. That is because another important principle of strategy is 
at work: the relationship between the ends sought and the means applied is critical. 
If one envisions the national means as consisting of the core elements of national 
power—military, political/diplomatic, economic, and informational—then the 
problem becomes one of matching the best tools (constructed from these elements 
of power) to apply toward the particular end. And in the complex world of grand 
strategy at the highest levels, this almost always implies that we need to find a 
complicated, integrated combination of multiple tools to apply in a synchronized 
and coordinated way. As we will observe shortly, the unnecessarily restricted appli-
cation of a single tool or set of tools (say, for example, using only the military 
element of power) or the misapplication of tools (again, for example, employing 
only military tools in an effort to address what is, say, fundamentally an economic 
objective), generally reflects an inability or unwillingness to address this need for 
complex yet integrated strategic approaches to complex problems. Moreover, this 
principle also illustrates the intrinsic importance of correctly identifying the nature 
of the problem one is addressing; one cannot possibly construct the proper ends, 
means, or ways in the face of an incorrect prior understanding of the problem. The 
core challenges in formulating an effective security strategy are to identify correctly 

22  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
where we need to go, what means we have to get there, and how best to use those 
means to get there as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Where is it we generally “want to go” in terms of national security policy? The 
answer lies in the concept of “interests.” Historically we have most often thought of 
these interests as “national interests.” Typically we express these broad interests as 
general goals or ambitions, such as protecting and promoting our way of life with 
our institutions and values intact. From these broad interests we can then derive 
a much more specific set of objectives. So, for example, promoting and sustaining 
economic prosperity as a general interest can lead to the derivative objective of 
maintaining access to oil, or protecting the flow of goods and services.
National security strategy or grand strategy is a country’s broadest approach 
to the pursuit of its national objectives in the international system. The essential 
point is that a country chooses objectives based on its interests and values and how 
they are affected, threatened, or challenged in the international system. The means 
to pursue those objectives fall into four broad categories, the “elements of national 
power.” Those elements, noted above, are political or diplomatic, informational, 
military, and economic.3 How a country generates, organizes, and applies those 
elements of national power together comprise the “ways” of its national security or 
grand strategy. An abbreviated example of U.S. strategy during the Cold War can 
help illustrate the key concepts in a more practical way.
The U.S. cold war grand strategy is most often referred to as “containment,” 
a name derived from the core objective, which was to contain communism (or 
prevent its spread). The cold war strategy of containment developed along the lines 
suggested by George Kennan in his “long telegram” from Moscow: “The main 
element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a 
long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tenden-
cies.”4 Kennan saw both offensive and defensive dimensions in the strategy. The 
defensive objective was to prevent any expansion of the political, economic, and 
military influence and physical presence of the Soviet Union. The offensive objec-
tive, generally overlooked in many discussions of containment, was the promotion 
of stable democracies and market economies; the idea was that healthy market 
democracies would prevent the spread of communist ideology and influence by 
denying the opportunity for it to spread.5 As the strategy evolved, and especially as 
one looks back on it, we can see the different elements of power as they were applied 
in an integrated, coordinated strategic effort: The political/diplomatic element in 
the form of the Truman Doctrine, the military in alliances such as NATO and the 
forward deployment of U.S. troops stationed abroad, the economic in the Marshall 
Plan, and the informational in efforts such as Voice of America and Radio Free 
Europe.
Over time, according to the views of some historians and analysts, the strategy 
of containment grew to rely ever more heavily on the military element.6 While 
this did not completely supplant the employment of other elements of power, 
U.S. resources did shift over time and by the 1980s this had resulted in a large 

The Search for National and Homeland Security  n  23
increase of those at the disposal of the Pentagon relative to those available for the 
State Department and USAID, for example. We highlight this shift here not to 
criticize the Pentagon, but to point out that by the time the cold war ended, and 
a new set of threats, challenges, and opportunities emerged as part of a trans-
forming strategic environment, the U.S. toolbox was in relative terms heavily 
filled with military instruments and much less so with instruments derived from 
the other three elements of power. Moreover, the resources reflected the way in 
which our national security policymaking structures were organized and how we 
thought about and constructed national security strategy.7 Having an organiza-
tional structure evolve over time in the cold war context, and developing certain 
“habits” for the kinds of means we preferred to employ in certain ways against 
known and somewhat “comfortable threats,” all left the United States in a very 
difficult position from which to see and grasp the changing security environ-
ment that was emerging. And perhaps arguably, that same historical vestige has 
hindered our efforts to come to grips strategically with the post-9/11 security 
environment.
There is considerably more one can say about strategy generally, but the discus-
sion of these basic elements should be sufficient for the arguments made here. The 
purpose is to provide an underlying foundation from which we can then assess 
the strategic context within which the search for national and homeland security 
takes place, and to offer some observations about the challenges to strategic success. 
Understanding these key concepts of strategy and strategy formulation is essential 
in order to place the specific challenges of national and homeland security in an 
appropriate strategic context. Only then can we approach the problem on a less ad 
hoc basis in an attempt to devise a more integrated and ultimately effective national 
strategy for homeland security. A final note in terms of the general principles of 
strategy is that, although strategy and strategic thinking do incorporate strong ele-
ments of rationality, strategy is anything but rigid and linear. Precisely because 
one is adapting to changing circumstances, as well as decisions and actions taken 
by other actors, some of whom may wish to do us great harm, sound strategy must 
always include and incorporate flexibility. Planning is an important component of 
strategy, but strategy should never be confused with “a plan” or a blueprint to be 
rigidly followed.
Post-Gulf War I: Tracing U.S. Grand Strategy
The 1991 National Security Strategy (NSS) was the last formal statement of U.S. 
national security policy and strategy produced by the Bush administration. Look-
ing back on the Clinton presidency and its approach to national security, it appears 
that its formally articulated strategy did not depart significantly from the core ele-
ments of the 1991 document. As I have argued elsewhere, however, that does not 
mean “that the two presidents pursued the same goals and objectives nor did so in 

24  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
the same ways.”8 Having very similar statements of security policy and strategy does 
not necessarily lead inevitably to similar behavior, in no small measure because the 
circumstances that presidents and their national security teams must respond to 
will be different. Those all-important circumstances necessarily can and almost 
always do lead to very different decisions and policy choices. The new and less 
traditional crises that confronted Clinton—notably in the Balkans and in Somalia 
initially—were very different from the much more traditional invasion of Kuwait 
by Saddam Hussein. And the means for addressing them, as well as the ways of 
applying those means—also reflected the transforming security environment. But 
the United States under Clinton adapted at best very slowly and perhaps very inef-
fectively at the strategic level. And the result tended to be a series of ad hoc crisis 
responses.9
Eight years later, and given the campaign rhetoric of the 2000 presidential elec-
tion, one would have logically expected a significant change in formally articulated 
U.S. security strategy. After all, candidate Bush argued strongly against “nation-
building” and for bringing the troops back home. National security advisor-to-be 
Condoleezza Rice wrote that a redefined set of vital national interests would drive 
U.S. national security policy and strategy, with a focus on priorities such as rebuild-
ing our military power, managing relations with China and Russia, and confronting 
rogue regimes.10 Yet once again, events and circumstances had a way of trumping 
campaign promises and strategic slogans. In this case, the Bush administration had 
produced no formal national security strategy statements prior to the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001. In fact, the administration produced a new Quadrennial Defense 
Review on September 30, 2001, prior to releasing a new national security strat-
egy, something that some analysts found more than a little disconcerting in that a 
defense strategy should be based on the national security objectives it is designed 
to support.11 By the time the Bush security team did produce formal statements of 
U.S. strategy they were heavily driven by the events and individual issues confront-
ing the country. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the release of the National 
Strategy for Homeland Security in July 2002, two months before the 2002 National 
Security Strategy (released in September). The 2002 NSS called for the preemptive 
use of military power against hostile states and terrorist groups seeking weapons of 
mass destruction (WMD), U.S. global military primacy, multilateralism when pos-
sible and unilateralism when necessary, and a commitment to spreading democracy 
and human rights around the world. All of these strategic pillars were very much in 
line with traditional U.S. strategic thought, though perhaps the formal statements 
dealing with preemption and primacy appeared to be departures in that they had 
previously remained largely unstated and arguably implicit. And the 2002 NSS was 
subsequently followed in February 2003 by individual national strategy documents 
on critical infrastructure protection and combating terrorism, joining homeland 
security in that category of separate, individual national strategies.
By mid-2007 the Bush administration was trying to hold together public and 
congressional support for the war in Iraq and the objective of promoting democracy 

The Search for National and Homeland Security  n  25
abroad. As much as his predecessor, President Bush’s approach to a series of crises 
was seemingly held together more by the “ad hockery” he had campaigned against 
than the consistent pursuit of clear strategic objectives through the systematic, inte-
grated application of all elements of power toward them. In the end, there is little 
argument disputing that the Bush and Clinton administrations have chosen very 
different approaches to the crises they faced. But the reliance on military force and 
the inability to organize and apply other elements of power effectively and in coor-
dination with that military power continue to characterize U.S. national security 
strategy. The main point is this: The formal statements of U.S. security policy and 
strategy, as evidenced in the annual NSS documents, have changed rather little 
in the past decade even in the face of enormous changes in the global security 
environment. One result of this has been an inability on the part of the United 
States to formulate consistent and effective responses to the kinds of threats and 
challenges it confronts. Moreover, the fits and starts that have characterized U.S. 
efforts to address homeland security requirements further highlight the challenges 
we face and the persistent problems we still encounter in adapting to a new strategic 
environment with a more comprehensive grand strategic approach. We turn now 
to a consideration of those challenges and problems, the central arguments of this 
chapter.
Homeland Security and National Security
Some have argued that the attacks of September 11, 2001 transformed the stra-
tegic landscape and ushered in a fundamentally new era in U.S. national security 
policy and strategy. Others, including this author, have taken a somewhat different 
perspective, arguing instead that the attacks reflected less of a transformation than 
a clarification of a strategic environment that had been transforming since even 
before the cold war ended and the Soviet Union dissolved.12 Regardless of the posi-
tion one takes on this general issue, the post-9/11 period did introduce a new term 
to the everyday security lexicon: homeland security. Given the peculiar historical 
experience of the United States—and especially its relative geopolitical isolation 
from the world—our national security strategy has rarely had to deal with direct 
threats to the homeland. Whereas other countries might not use a term such as 
homeland security because there would be no concept of national security without 
security of the homeland, U.S. national security culture developed in such a way 
that relatively little attention was paid to the vulnerability of the homeland. The 
single most important departure from this kind of thinking, of course, occurred 
during the height of the cold war as the United States was confronted by the threat 
of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). And even then, the strategic 
concept Americans developed—Mutual Assured Destruction or MAD—conceived 
of protecting the homeland by a kind of shared homeland vulnerability.

26  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
In any case, the attacks of September 11, 2001 ushered in an era of strategic 
thought in which the focus on protecting the homeland would come to occupy a 
prominent if not preeminent position in national security strategy. And counterter-
rorism became the lynchpin on which almost all of our national security strategy 
was based. Our focus shifted almost immediately to protecting the homeland from 
future terrorist attacks through a combination of external measures (fighting ter-
rorism abroad) and internal measures (taking steps to secure our borders and deny-
ing terrorists future opportunities to strike at home). Initially with the creation of 
a special office for Homeland Security, and then with the legislation that created 
a Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the president and Congress formal-
ized the new strategic focus and ensured that no discussion of national security 
strategy would exclude the homeland dimension. Because of the multidimensional 
nature of the concept, and its external and internal dimensions, the organizational 
approach that was chosen included combining some twenty-four already existing 
agencies into a single new department, DHS. While combining functions as diverse 
as border patrol and emergency management in a single mega-agency appeared at 
least questionable to some observers and analysts, a host of factors (some perhaps 
strategic and others more logically domestic and political) combined to push this 
so-called “strategic reform” through to completion. But for all of the time and 
effort given to this “single largest reform” of the U.S. national security organiza-
tional apparatus since the National Security Act of 1947, relatively little attention 
and debate were focused on the strategic-level logic of the reorganization. And in 
fact, some critics argued that the decision simply to combine the existing agencies 
reflected less a focus on strategic thought than a bureaucratic “fix” that protected 
the different agencies and their domestic constituencies. Some wondered aloud 
whether domestic politics had again trumped national security strategy.
Sadly, and perhaps ironically, it took an act of nature and not another con-
scious act of terrorists to bring this fundamental gap in strategic thought into focus. 
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in August 2005, little attention had 
been paid to how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would 
function in its new organizational home as a part of the DHS. In fact, what exer-
cising of the diverse emergency management capabilities that had been conducted 
prior to that disaster had been done largely in the context of responses to terrorist 
attacks modeled after those of September 11, 2001. Whether or not a DHS could 
effectively organize, plan, and execute the kind of complex strategic, operational, 
and tactical responses necessitated by such a natural disaster, including the com-
munication and coordination across the various levels of government from national 
to local, and the nearly mind-boggling number of different agencies, had received 
almost no serious attention. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, our national security 
strategy was focused almost exclusively on rooting out and eliminating terrorists at 
home and abroad, and only secondarily on consequence management at home. And 
sadly, the focus on natural disasters was seriously ignored, with the likely underly-
ing assumption being that we had dealt with such disasters before and there was 

The Search for National and Homeland Security  n  27
nothing in the national security reorganization to suggest that they would not be 
handled successfully in the same ways in the future. While there were a number 
of compounding factors that made Hurricane Katrina different from almost all of 
its predecessor natural disasters, post-Katrina studies and congressional hearings 
revealed the extent to which the national security reorganization and the new focus 
on homeland security created serious gaps in our overall strategic ability to orga-
nize, plan, and execute such complex contingency operations.13
Our purpose here is not to dwell on the disasters that ensued after Katrina made 
landfall on August 29, 2005, nor to place blame on any individuals or agencies. 
Plenty of that has occurred over the past two years. Instead, we wish to draw atten-
tion to the national security strategy implications of the Katrina experience and 
what it suggests about the place of homeland security in our new national security 
strategy thinking. There are several overall lessons that stem from our experiences 
with Katrina and our ongoing struggles against terrorism, and all of them bring 
us back to our earlier discussion of strategy. First, we must properly identify our 
general strategic objectives. Failing to do so will prevent us from translating those 
broad strategic ends into the kinds of operational objectives we must be able to 
achieve. Simply put, protecting the homeland is not solely a matter of addressing 
terrorism (whether at home or abroad). When we choose to combine the different 
kinds of threats (manmade and natural) and our possible responses to them in a 
single concept of homeland security, we must think more broadly at the strategic 
level about what this entails for our strategic ends. Second, just because certain 
capabilities exist that can be applied toward both kinds of threats (in this case 
consequence management for emergencies), it does not necessarily follow that they 
can be used in the same ways. Understanding what capabilities we need (the means) 
and how we can best employ them (the ways) is a function of tying those ways 
and means to the accomplishment of specific ends. The relation between the tools 
and how they are used to meet the objectives one wishes to accomplish is critical. 
Assuming a kind of universal or general application of tools to “generic” ends will 
more likely than not lead to strategic failure.
Third, nowhere is this issue of relating specific ends to specific ways and means 
more critical than in how we are organized to devise and implement strategy. Add-
ing homeland security to our national security strategy lexicon may in fact be the 
absolutely proper thing to do in confronting the twenty-first century strategic envi-
ronment. The attacks in 2001 suggest strongly that it was high time for the United 
States to do so. And the vulnerabilities and shortcomings those attacks revealed 
in areas such as cross-agency communication, interoperability, data-sharing, intel-
ligence gathering and sharing, and so on, speak volumes about the need to organize 
properly to conduct twenty-first century national security strategy. And yet the 
events that followed the “attack” by Hurricane Katrina suggest the initial reorgani-
zation was prompted by and reflected a near preoccupation with only one kind of 
homeland security threat—the premeditated actions of highly motivated individu-
als and groups to do harm. In the debates that ensued, and the organizational deci-

28  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
sions that grew out of them, the United States has tried once again to reorganize 
for conducting homeland security. But have we given all the careful strategic-level 
thought and attention to what the best organizational structure is for addressing 
not just the emergency management dimension of homeland security but its coun-
terterrorism dimension as well? Although much was learned at great cost from the 
Katrina experiences, one must wonder today whether elevating FEMA to a special 
role within DHS is not yet another case of “preparing to fight the last war.” If 
the next DHS challenge—and by that we mean the next national security chal-
lenge—is not a natural disaster but a terrorist-induced one, will the extra-organiza-
tional role now assigned to FEMA cause the United States to be overly prepared for 
another Katrina and under-prepared for the actual event we face? If we are not will-
ing to incorporate all of the dimensions of homeland security into national security 
strategic thought, including how we are organized, what capabilities we will need, 
and how we will employ them, then we would do well to reconsider the assumption 
that natural and manmade “threats” should be housed together.14
Conclusion
We began this chapter with the observations that the United States lacks “a rea-
sonably clear and meaningful grand strategy … that would effectively integrate 
the requirements for both national and homeland security,” and that the ability 
“to implement that strategy through the appropriate application of the proper ele-
ments of power has been seriously hampered.” Simply put, the problem is that as 
Americans responded to the attacks of September 11 and as the country reori-
ented the military element of power toward a “global war on terrorism,” the United 
States created its own concept of homeland security and devised a military strat-
egy of counterterrorism without simultaneously building them into a unifying 
and integrating grand strategy. Although published documents such as the various 
national strategies and the two National Security Strategies (2002 and 2006) spoke 
to “strategy,” none represented a genuine departure from prior national security 
policy statements, and none effectively rose to the level of a new national security 
or grand strategy for the twenty-first century. The concepts of homeland security 
and counterterrorism remained somewhat separate from a true grand strategy. As 
a consequence, counterterrorism efforts have tended to be rather one-dimensional, 
focusing very heavily on the use of military force, and homeland security efforts 
similarly one-dimensional, focusing heavily on the terrorist sources of the threats. 
In both cases this has led to strategic shortcomings, in the first case by limiting our 
efforts to integrate all of the elements of power in a more comprehensive approach 
to counterterrorism, and in the second case by initially downplaying the natural 
disaster dimension of homeland security. The strategic consequences of these short-
comings is that U.S. national security policy continues to display the kind of ad 

The Search for National and Homeland Security  n  29
hoc, crisis management that has characterized it since the early years following the 
end of the cold war.
Relative continuity in our strategic approach is the underlying theme that cuts 
across several administrations. This is also not surprising, given the enormous con-
straints that act on the processes and the players who articulate, shape, and ulti-
mately produce the documents and create the organizations responsible for that 
approach. The formal statements of U.S. security policy and strategy, as evidenced 
in the annual National Security Strategy documents, have changed rather little in 
the past decade and a half, even in the face of enormous changes in the global secu-
rity environment. And as a consequence the United States remains handicapped 
at the strategic level in formulating the overarching grand strategy to drive our 
decision making, and in our abilities to develop the appropriate means and apply 
them in the most effective ways to accomplish the large ends that are fundamental 
in grand strategy. It is not so much that we lack options, although there admittedly 
appear to be more bad options than good ones.15 It is more fundamentally a lack 
of strategy and an integrated application of all the elements of power that tend to 
limit U.S. ability to succeed.
As noted earlier, a grand strategy is not a perfectly rational and completely com-
prehensive “plan” for how a country will respond to every challenge and counter 
every threat. Given the nature of strategy, it must allow for significant flexibility 
and adaptation as one adjusts to the shifts in the strategic environment and the 
choices and actions made by other actors in that environment. Consequently, sim-
ply having a grand strategy does not remove the uncertainty and dynamism inher-
ent in any strategic engagement, particularly those involving cunning and ruthless 
enemies such as we face today. But the absence of grand strategic thinking as an 
organizing principle for helping shape the specific decisions we make and responses 
we choose almost always ensures the perpetuation of the kind of ad hoc actions 
referred to earlier. And this in turn leads not only to a greater risk of inconsistency 
and conflicting choices and actions, but also to the very dangerous potential misuse 
and waste of precious resources. Without a reasonably clear and consistent overall 
strategy, any country is likely to respond to the crises du jour and expend valuable 
resources in the wrong ways for the wrong ends, ultimately resulting in strategic 
failure.
The security environment we confront today is highly fluid, and it contains 
ambiguous threats and challenges, and a diverse set of actors that include traditional 
tyrannical regimes, failed and failing states, non-state terrorist and criminal actors, 
and even natural disasters, all with the potential for generating strategic-level con-
sequences for the United States and its citizens. The search for national security and 
homeland security, whether one considers these concepts separate and distinct or 
simply one part of a broader conception of national security, must be included in a 
twenty-first century integrated grand strategy. Anything less will cause the United 
States to bear unnecessary risk in potentially unidentified ways.

Chapter 3
Assured Vulnerability
Homeland Security and 
the Cold War Legacy 
of Defenselessness
David Goldfischer
The author focuses on how an offense-oriented stra-
tegic culture in the United States continues to impede 
development of strategy for homeland security. The 
period from 1812 until World War II and the Cold War 
in which the United States did not face substantial 
external threat to the homeland left an historical leg-
acy in which both domestic preparations and defense 
orientations remain underdeveloped. Even early Cold 
War efforts in the 1950s and 1960s on civil as well as 
antibomber and antimissile defenses foundered as the 
nation put its strategic focus in the 1970s and 1980s 
almost entirely on the offense—a condition the author 
describes as “mutual, assured vulnerability” vis-à-
vis the Soviet Union. In the post-Cold War (and now 
post-9/11) period, efforts to secure the homeland are 
still an uphill battle in the absence of a strategic cul-
ture with greater defense orientation to complement 

34  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
a deeply embedded emphasis on offense. Education 
of professionals in homeland security should thus go 
well beyond training in the mechanics of what is to be 
done to include strategic thinking that gives defense its 
proper place alongside offensive consideration.
The response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast on August 29, 
2005, made it clear that U.S. efforts post-9/11 to augment homeland security had 
floundered. As the crisis unfolded and during subsequent weeks and months, scorn 
was heaped on an assortment of individuals and government agencies. Some held 
the president and his homeland security director responsible, while others pointed 
to the seeming ineptitude of the head of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA). Still others insisted the governor of Louisiana or the mayor of 
New Orleans was primarily at fault for failures of planning, breakdowns in com-
munication, and a lack of resources or their misallocation. Assigning blame was 
driven largely by one’s preferred theory of federalism. Many pundits in Washington 
insisted that homeland security (or at least emergency preparedness and response) 
was basically a local affair, while others happily pointed their fingers at the federal 
government.
It was conceivable, of course, that Katrina would prove to be a threshold event, 
finally generating the sense of urgency necessary to launch a serious national effort 
at homeland security. That thought was expressed in the foreword of the official 
report on the lessons of Katrina submitted to President Bush, which stated: “We 
hope that this Report marks the beginning of a truly transformational state of 
preparedness throughout all levels of our Nation.”1 Unfortunately, that sentiment 
only faintly echoed the impassioned sense of national resolve experienced in the 
wake of 9/11. It was sobering to note that several years had already gone by without 
anything remotely approaching a transformation of national preparedness.2 If the 
shock of the destruction of the World Trade Center and the attack on the capital 
had failed to inspire a serious national commitment to homeland security, why 
should we have expected Katrina to provide the decisive “wake-up” call?
The central argument of this chapter is that an important reason for the U.S. 
failure to launch a “truly transformational” homeland security effort, despite 9/11 
and Hurricane Katrina, lies in the historical context that has shaped our views of 
national defense. In that sense, the overall weakness of the defensive side of the 
national response to 9/11 has more fundamental causes than any particular set of 
decisions made by individual policymakers of varying levels of competency. Only 
by coming to grips with the historical record that culminated in almost complete 
national defenselessness long before 9/11 can we both gain a realistic sense of the 
obstacles to progress in homeland security and understand how best to overcome 
them, thus being better prepared for future terrorist attacks. To contribute to that 
effort, this chapter examines the historical roots of U.S. vulnerability to attack, 

Assured Vulnerability  n  35
assesses our post-9/11 progress in overcoming that legacy, and briefly considers how 
that effort might be accelerated.
The Roots of Vulnerability
In the middle of the twentieth century, the United States experienced a profound 
shift in its strategic environment from the long-term absence of any need for home-
land defense—a period stretching from the War of 1812 until the 1940s, when 
attacks on Hawaii and threats to the Pacific Coast in World War II were followed 
by the onset of the Cold War and Soviet acquisition of nuclear weapons. The nuclear 
competition with the U.S.S.R. that followed made defense (in the traditional sense 
of physically protecting the American population in the event of an enemy attack) 
seemingly impossible. Faced with the quixotic nature of hopes to defend against 
the Russian nuclear arsenal, many policymakers took refuge in the belief that the 
threat of U.S. nuclear retaliation would reliably and permanently deter attack, 
making defense simply unnecessary.
New concerns about U.S. vulnerability arose in the post-Cold War (and pre-
9/11) period, resulting in increased support for developing defenses against missile 
attack—an important but narrow aspiration long dear to the political right. This 
preoccupation only underscored the complete absence of a coherent national strat-
egy for addressing the spectrum of plausible attacks on the U.S. homeland. Indeed, 
long-time observers of nuclear policy could recognize that the revival of support 
for missile defense preceding (and in a sense eclipsed by) 9/11, represented only 
the latest manifestation of an episodic debate that had waxed and waned since the 
1960s—a debate in which even supporters of missile defense produced very little 
serious analysis of what a meaningful effort at “homeland security” would entail.
In short, from the emergence of the first sustained threat against the United 
States in the early years of the Cold War until 2001, U.S. leaders never undertook 
significant measures to overcome the condition of “assured vulnerability,” whether 
by minimizing offensive threats through pursuing serious arms control and disar-
mament, progressively augmenting the spectrum of defensive capabilities, or com-
bining both of these approaches.
The outcome of a series of domestic power struggles among proponents of vari-
ous contending nuclear doctrines was twofold. First, the aim of the substantial 
buildup of strategic nuclear (and later of general-purpose or conventional) forces 
was to provide sufficient offensive power to destroy any enemy (indeed, as the offen-
sive buildup proceeded enough firepower was produced to destroy all human civili-
zation). Second, the focus on offense was marked by the absence of any meaningful 
effort to limit damage to the American population. Put another way, there was no 
development of a viable homeland security strategy, much less one accompanied by 
the necessary military or civil capabilities to achieve such a domestic defense. Mini-
mal efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to provide for bomber, missile, and civil defenses 

36  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
were subsequently downgraded or abandoned completely. Indeed, the national pre-
occupation with offense for more than a half century of the nuclear age left behind 
a legacy of institutions, doctrines, and beliefs that greatly impeded U.S. adjustment 
to the new defensive challenge posed by the attacks on 9/11.
Before evaluating the Cold War-era origins of this neglect of defense, it may be 
useful at least briefly to note what homeland security (or homeland defense) means. 
These terms have attracted a great deal of contentious discussion, especially regard-
ing the distinction between homeland security and homeland defense. It was not until 
after 9/11 that both terms entered mainstream policy discourse. “Defense” in this 
context refers primarily to the measures a state takes to protect what lies within 
its borders (i.e., its people along with the physical and institutional foundations of 
human sustenance and society as a whole). Capabilities are purely defensive to the 
extent they are useless until an enemy has launched an attack—that is, they have 
no capacity themselves to launch an attack against others.3
In the language of cold war strategy, defenses could be divided into “active” 
and “passive.” Active defenses comprise weapons systems that spring into action 
in order to shoot down the enemy’s offensive forces (e.g., bombers or missiles) as 
they approach their targets. Passive defenses are measures such as radar detection 
designed to give warning or, as with civil defense, to cope with the consequences of 
an attack. Civil defense—the pre-9/11 term that is a direct antecedent of the phrase 
“homeland security”—is directed toward the protection of people and society as a 
whole (as opposed to the defense of a country’s military forces).
The imposition of these terms homeland security and homeland defense and espe-
cially the difficult if not impossible effort to distinguish neatly between them have 
set back efforts to think clearly about requirements for defending society. We may 
well have been better off had we stuck with civil defense—the older (and more pre-
cise) term of art that captures our main concerns when we speak of securing the 
homeland.
Be that as it may, we use homeland security here to refer to the spectrum of 
purely defensive measures—both active and passive, though its main concern is 
with civil defense. After all, the issues of “defense” that have filled the media since 
9/11 have generally focused on preparedness and emergency response to disasters 
caused either by terrorists or by nature. Moreover, because they involve all levels 
of government as well as non-governmental organizations (often grassroots orga-
nizations staffed by volunteers), the robustness of these societal defenses is a good 
barometer of the depth and intensity of the national commitment to homeland 
security.4
The Cold War Neglect of Homeland Security
As noted above, the United States went from a long period in which homeland secu-
rity was unnecessary to a Cold War, nucleus arms competition in which defense 

Assured Vulnerability  n  37
seemed desperately necessary, but almost certainly hopeless, and possibly even dan-
gerous to attempt.5 Given this historical context, we turn now to a brief discussion 
on the evolution of thinking about homeland security during the cold war. 
In Britain, Germany, and Japan, the bombing of cities in World War II made 
civil defense a central activity. By contrast, in the United States it had become clear 
by late 1943 that there would be no attack on U.S. cities, and people were already 
talking about abolishing the wartime “Office of Civilian Defense.”6 Feeble efforts 
by the enemy (such as Japan’s release of 9,000 balloons carrying incendiary bombs 
into the winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean toward the U.S. west coast) were 
insufficient to inspire substantial civil defense preparations by the United States 
outside of immediate coastal areas.7
Why didn’t the United States choose to learn and apply the civil defense les-
sons adopted by its allies and enemies during World War II? One purpose of the 
post-war Strategic Bombing Survey, aside from evaluating the damage U.S. and 
British bombers had inflicted, was to assess the effectiveness of various civil defense 
measures in limiting that damage. An obvious lesson of World War II was that the 
era of strategic bombing had arrived, and it might have been equally obvious that 
future enemies of the United States would achieve the range to attack the American 
shoreline and within the interior of the country. In fact, the report of the Strategic 
Bombing Survey in 1945 called for a national civil defense program designed to 
make it impossible for any “single or small group of successful attacks” to “paralyze 
the national organism”—that is, it called for a serious long-term augmentation of 
what we now call homeland security.8
That report was the first of a long series of government-sponsored studies of 
homeland security requirements over the decades stretching ahead to 9/11—which 
would be either entirely ignored, or which would set in motion brief frenzies of 
ultimately useless activity. Far more typical of official policy in the aftermath of 
World War II was to ignore the implications of strategic bombing (let alone nuclear 
attack) for national preparedness. For example, according to the 1950 “Blue Book” 
on Civil Defense produced by the National Security Resources Board, “the basic 
operating responsibility for civil defense is the individual and his local govern-
ment.” Indeed, the family was cited as the “basis for organized self-protection.”9
But this was also the period of the Berlin blockade in 1948, the first Soviet 
nuclear test and the fall of China to communist forces both in 1949, and the invasion 
of South Korea by the communist north in 1950. If those events did not guarantee 
greater attention to homeland security, they at least ensured that defense policy 
would become a central issue for U.S. policymakers. Although President Truman 
made a gesture toward homeland security by introducing the Civil Defense Act, 
creating the Federal Civil Defense Administration, the real policy debate over what 
one day would be called “homeland security” (but was then called “continental 
defense”) occurred during the first year of the Eisenhower administration.10
For one side in that debate, the prospect of war against a nuclear adversary made 
it obvious that a major federal program combining active and passive defenses was 

38  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
critically needed. This was the message conveyed by such studies of civil defense as 
“Project Charles” and “Project East River.” The message received strongest endorse-
ment in the 1952 Report of the Panel of Consultants on Disarmament, chaired 
by the “father of the atom bomb,” J. Robert Oppenheimer, and also including 
future CIA Director Allen Dulles. (The Report’s secretary was the future influen-
tial National Security Council advisor, McGeorge Bundy.)
In the heated political environment of the early Cold War, however, the recom-
mendations of these studies were extremely controversial. The problem was most 
dramatically evident in the report of Oppenheimer’s disarmament panel. That 
report emphasized what in retrospect would seem two obvious points: first, that 
in the face of an adversary capable of a nuclear buildup the United States needed 
a “continental defense”; second, that in order for U.S. active and passive defense 
measures to have any prospect of ensuring the wartime survival and recovery of 
the American people, they would have to be accompanied by Soviet restraint in the 
development and deployment of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. 
Put another way, the success of “homeland security” would depend on arms control 
agreements with the Soviet Union, agreements in which both superpowers would 
greatly limit their offensive striking power.
That reasoning infuriated a political coalition in the United States for whom the 
exploitation of American offensive nuclear power was seen as the essential center-
piece of U.S. national security policy. These advocates of atomic airpower included 
fiscal conservatives (who saw the atom bomb as providing “more bang for the buck” 
than conventional forces), Cold War hawks (who wanted to maximize—and per-
haps carry out—the U.S. nuclear threat against the Communist world), and the Air 
Force, whose new Strategic Air Command (SAC) was promoting nuclear bombers 
as both necessary and sufficient for the victory of the United States over the Soviet 
Union.
From the vantage point of these groups, the homeland security advocates’ call 
for a “mutual foreswearing of strategic air warfare” was at best foolhardy, at worst 
evidence of a communist plot. Then classified Air Force documents revealed the 
fear of the Air Force leadership that if the American public knew the reality of the 
danger posed by the emerging Soviet nuclear threat, they would have heeded the 
advocates of homeland security. The result would be a “fortress America,” in which 
the public would demand that the United States pursue its own safety domesti-
cally rather than develop the offensive capability to obliterate the population of the 
Soviet Union.
The first period of serious advocacy of homeland security ended in 1953 when 
a group of airpower supporters accused Oppenheimer of being a Soviet spy and 
succeeded in having him banned as an advisor to the United States government. 
Their victory in the struggle for policy was confirmed in the January 1954 “massive 
retaliation” speech by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, which presented the 
doctrine that the United States would protect itself, Western Europe, and other 
allies chiefly through the threat of nuclear attacks.

Ironically, the very success of the airpower advocates in crushing supporters of 
continental defense now helped improve prospects for serious homeland security 
measures. Now that there was no fear that defensive preparations would be linked 
to offensive disarmament, the need for defenses as a component of war-fighting 
became apparent. After all, the credibility of launching a massive nuclear attack 
against an enemy capable of retaliation would require defensive measures to mini-
mize the impact of such retaliation.
Other events also conspired to make it impossible to continue a policy of nearly 
complete defenselessness. One was the 1954 Bikini Atoll Test by the United States 
of the new thermonuclear weapon (the “H-bomb”). As a result of that blast, 7,000 
square miles of the Pacific Ocean were covered with fallout sufficient to cause death 
or serious injury, making it impossible to continue assuring the American public 
that nothing more need be done to build up defenses to protect them. Given the 
fact that the Soviet Union also had the H-bomb and was on the verge of deploy-
ing its first generation of intercontinental-range bombers (which it did starting in 
1955), thinking began to shift from disparagement of the need for defense by politi-
cal and military leaders, to frantic calls for massive defensive deployments.11
In psychological terms, the succeeding thirty plus years (i.e., until the end of 
the Cold War) would witness wild swings between hysteria during superpower 
crises and relative complacency at other times. In terms of defensive measures, a 
massive anti-aircraft program was pursued in the mid-1950s only to be overtaken 
by the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957—an event that presaged the arrival of 
the ICBM—the intercontinental-range ballistic missile armed with a nuclear war-
head (against which there was literally no defense). While Sputnik demolished the 
hope that anti-aircraft defenses could protect the American population, it gave 
rise to a new lobby in support of ballistic missile defenses. That lobby persuaded 
three presidents (Johnson, Nixon, and especially Reagan) to commit themselves to 
nationwide deployments of antimissile systems. In the end, the outcome of those 
passionate debates over ballistic missile defense (the “ABM debates” of the late 
1960s and the “Star Wars” debate of the 1980s) were determined by the fact that 
no defensive weapons system actually existed (or could reliably be anticipated) that 
could cope with even a fraction of the thousands of nuclear bombs and warheads 
that the Soviets were capable of launching.
The advent of the missile age in ultimately defeating the claims of those who 
were maintaining that a combination of offense and defense could enable the United 
States to win a nuclear war enabled the proponents of an equally unpalatable doc-
trine—“mutual [or mutually] assured destruction”—to gain apparent control over 
nuclear policy. Given their absurd combination of calls for a U.S. capability for vic-
tory in a nuclear World War III and acknowledgment that “victory” would likely 
include the elimination of major American cities and the loss of tens of millions of 
lives, advocates of nuclear war-fighting ultimately were repudiated by the American 
public; their calls for extensive civil defense efforts as an integral part of a robust 
nuclear war-fighting strategy producing little more than black humor.

40  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The apparent futility of nuclear war-fighting enhanced receptivity in the 1970s 
to the argument that the superpowers should accept relations defined by nuclear 
parity based, as noted above, on bilateral capabilities for “mutual assured destruc-
tion” (a doctrine whose unfortunate acronym was “MAD”). From the perspec-
tive of MAD advocates, defense was completely unnecessary because the threat of 
unleashing a holocaust would reliably deter both superpowers from ever launching 
such an attack. Defenses were also seen from this strategic perspective as being 
supremely dangerous because if either power tried to protect its people with civil 
defense measures, active defenses, or both, such actions would provide evidence 
that could be interpreted by the other power as preparations for starting a nuclear 
war, perhaps leading that power to preempt. Advocacy of nuclear “war-fighting” 
doctrines—evidence of some combination of delusion and aggressive designs—was 
seen as destabilizing deterrence relations between the superpowers with potentially 
disastrous consequences.
Unfortunately, MAD proponents could also be accused of suffering from dan-
gerous illusions. Another way of characterizing mutual assured destruction, after 
all, was to note that it called for the “assured vulnerability” of both superpowers’ 
populations. As MAD critic Donald Brennan put it, the doctrine appeared to favor 
“dead Russians over live Americans.”12 MAD in fact had arguably fatal defects. 
In the context of the Cold War, it offered no hope if something went wrong with 
the system—for example, decisions taken by a crazy leader or regime, or a fatal 
miscalculation at the height of a crisis. It also provided a rationale for nuclear pro-
liferation because it claimed that huge nuclear arsenals could be safe and even 
necessary to preserve the peace between adversarial states. Also problematic was the 
fact that MAD was conceptually incompatible with defenses, even against attacks 
that were serious but short of apocalyptic. It would take 9/11 to reveal that such 
attacks (whether by non-nuclear means or with weapons of mass destruction) could 
become a chronic feature of life under conditions of globalization, and the events 
of that day represented the death knell for thinking premised on “mutual assured 
vulnerability.”
Throughout the Cold War, episodic increases in superpower tensions could be 
counted on to generate increased attention (however ephemeral) to civil defense. 
Whenever that occurred, the two contending approaches favored by advocates 
could be described, as did one official of the Federal Civil Defense Administra-
tion (FCDA) in the 1950s, as “duck and cover” versus “run like hell.”13 The for-
mer approach began in the Eisenhower years, exemplified by the now notorious 
FCDA film in which Bert the Turtle showed how schoolchildren could achieve 
safety against an atomic explosion by hiding under their desks. That was comple-
mented by the distribution of 22 million comic books and 50 million wallet cards, 
and other corresponding public relations efforts to convey that a nuclear attack was 
really not that big a deal so long as one was prepared to take effective defensive 
measures.

Assured Vulnerability  n  41
In 1956, the FCDA proposed a national blast and fallout shelter program to 
protect 315 target areas (asking roughly $300 billion in current dollars). That idea 
lapsed until 1961 when President Kennedy, in the middle of one of the crises over 
the fate of West Berlin, revived the call for a national shelter program. A brochure 
on the subject was mailed to every American family, and fallout shelter signs went 
up at entrances to sturdy looking public buildings throughout U.S. cities. For six 
months, debate raged over whether families (with government support) should 
build blast and fallout shelters. The debate ended in December 1961 when the 
president proposed in a nationwide address that the country concentrate more “on 
keeping enemy missiles away from our shores, and less on how to keep our neigh-
bors out of our shelters.”14
The “run like hell” approach began in earnest with the Interstate Highway Act 
of 1956, which created what was then called the “National Defense Highway Sys-
tem” (culminating in the 41,000 miles of the modern interstate highway system.) 
The central selling point of this plan, as Eisenhower put it, was that the country’s 
roads were “too small for the flood of traffic of an entire city’s people going one 
way,” so that they “would turn into traps of death and destruction during an aerial 
attack or national disaster.”15 These highways were obviously built for reasons that 
went beyond civil defense; they were a means of encouraging the national transition 
to a “car culture,” a transition that would provide a huge economic boost to a range 
of industries. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the construction of the interstates 
is one legacy of the Cold War that actually contributed to long-term civil defense 
efforts, facilitating evacuations, and making it feasible for industrial development 
to be more dispersed than otherwise.
The black humor potential of the “run like hell” approach was not fully revealed 
until the years of the Reagan presidency, the final round of the Cold War that 
began with the president’s calls for a U.S. capability to “prevail in a protracted 
nuclear war.” In 1982, the president asked FEMA (which had been created in 1979 
to centralize federal management of natural disasters) to plan for the relocation of 
150 million Americans from around 400 high-risk areas to about 2,000 host areas 
at least 50 miles away. New York, among other cities, refused to work with FEMA. 
In the hypothesized context of early warning of an all-out Soviet nuclear strike 
(i.e., involving more than 10,000 nuclear bombs and warheads), the thought of 
managing the evacuation of eight million New Yorkers, combined with the image 
of host communities calmly waiting to care for them, was simply too bizarre to be 
taken seriously. FEMA continued working on protecting critical infrastructure and 
responding to attacks, including terrorist attacks, but substantial funding for their 
effort ended in 1988, as the Cold War waned.16
When the Cold War ended, the initial victors in the longstanding “war-fighting 
versus MAD” debate were the supporters of MAD, who seemed truly convinced 
that the “assured vulnerability” doctrine could now result in permanent arms con-
trol agreements among the nuclear powers; however, the erosion of that doctrinal 
commitment long preceded 9/11. First, the Scud missile attacks by Saddam Hussein 

42  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
against Israel during Desert Storm in 1991, however ineffectual, reminded people 
that it was easy to imagine why one might want some combination of antimissile 
systems and civil defense. As the range of missiles held by smaller states increased, 
this concern became ever more salient. Equally important, the coup against Gor-
bachev, during which no one knew who had control of the nuclear “button” in the 
Soviet Union, followed by the Soviet breakup, seemed to suggest that certain levels 
of global instability made MAD a very risky proposition. In the months preceding 
9/11, the Bush administration had begun forcefully moving toward ending the 
1972 ABM Treaty, the U.S.-Soviet agreement that had precluded militarily signifi-
cant defenses against missiles. 9/11, aside from ending meaningful political support 
for MAD, ironically also showed that missile defense, at least for the near term, was 
hardly the most important component of a national homeland security policy.
To sum up the Cold War-era legacy, once the superpowers fell into the trap 
of focusing on building up their nuclear offenses, homeland security became an 
impossible dream. In a major cost study of U.S. nuclear weapons-related programs 
(from 1940 to 1996), the authors concluded that only about 16 percent of the nearly 
$6 trillion spent was on defensive measures (which included anti-aircraft, antisub-
marine, antimissile, and civil defense). Out of the roughly $940 billion spent on 
defending against the bomb, only $19 billion was spent on civil defense. In other 
words, civil defense received roughly 10 percent of the total spent on defensive mea-
sures against nuclear attack, and less than one-third of 1 percent of the total spent 
on nuclear war preparation.17 Over the same period, Switzerland, with one-fortieth 
of the U.S. population, spent more on civil defense than did the United States.18
In short, nearly one and a half centuries of not needing a defense was followed 
by a half-century in which—because of the nuclear arms race for which the United 
States bore significant responsibility—providing an effective defense rapidly became 
impossible. In large measure as a result of the doctrine of “mutual assured vulner-
ability” that arose in recognition of that impossibility, serious advocacy of what 
would become known as “homeland security” was seen as utopian or dangerously 
provocative (since it implied an effort to escape from the “balance of terror” and 
achieve victory). The combined result of decades of debate between the unrealistic 
doctrines of war-fighting and MAD was near paralysis in efforts to plan rationally 
for homeland security, both during the era preceding 9/11 and in its aftermath.
After 9/11: The Legacy of Neglect
After the first effort to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, a number of noted 
experts on national security offered guidelines for a major national effort at pre-
venting and responding to future attacks, as well as conveying that future terror-
ist incidents were not only inevitable but also likely to be on a far greater scale of 
destruction.19 For the reasons described in the preceding section, those warnings 
and policy prescriptions fell on deaf ears. Even though securing the homeland is 

Assured Vulnerability  n  43
essential in this new era characterized by globalization and radical Islamist terror-
ism, efforts to do so have been impeded by the absence of a supporting defense-ori-
ented culture among political elites, the military, or the general population. Had it 
existed, an agreed analytical framework for homeland security planning could have 
facilitated adjustment to radical change in the nature of the threat.
Thus, when 9/11 occurred, what followed was a long period of improvisation, 
much of which was understandably aimed at addressing the specific vulnerabilities 
revealed by the attack. The first authoritative effort at designing an overall approach, 
the July 2002 National Strategy for Homeland Security, provided a familiar set of 
categories (e.g., intelligence and early warning, border and transportation security, 
critical infrastructure, etc.) but no overarching vision that could give shape to a 
cohesive national strategy to guide rationally an efficient allocation of resources.
The chief institutional response to 9/11, of course, was the creation of the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which began operating in January 
2003. While it remains the task of future historians to judge the ultimate impact 
of DHS, the response to Katrina made the agency’s internal chaos—already well 
known to every informed observer—a matter of grave public concern.
That doesn’t mean that there was no evidence of progress or of hope for the 
future. The United States Northern Command, created in April 2002 and declared 
fully operational on the second anniversary of 9/11, progressed with a serious sense 
of mission to assess the role of the military in homeland defense, to coordinate 
with its Canadian, Mexican, and Caribbean partners, and to work on developing 
its support function for civil authorities in the event of large-scale disasters. As for 
DHS, even before Katrina, the replacement of Tom Ridge by Michael Chertoff in 
February 2005 resulted in a sharper analytical focus on a spectrum of issues facing 
the agency, as well as prioritization of missions and specific tasks.
Well aware of past problems in coping with homeland-security challenges, 
Chertoff noted the need to recognize that “lurching from either extreme forms of 
protection to total complacency … [is] not an appropriate way to build a strategy.”20 
As soon as he took office, he began repeating in speech after speech that the gen-
eral model to be applied would be one of risk management in which assessments 
of a combination of threat, vulnerability, and consequence would guide decision 
making on priorities. Although far too little is known about the nature of future 
threats to allow that model to become a formula offering specific guidance, a com-
monsensical approach to linking those factors nevertheless led Chertoff to identify 
some clear priorities (e.g., improving and deploying radiation sensors both at points 
of entry and within cities, developing command-level communications interoper-
ability within cities and regions, etc.).21
The greatest single contribution to framing the debate over homeland security 
was the July 2004 report of the 9/11 Commission. While future research will deepen 
review of the vulnerabilities that made 9/11 possible, and while there will be endless 
debate over its recommendations, the Commission succeeded brilliantly in provid-
ing an authoritative structure—within a single volume—for thinking through the 

44  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
challenges of homeland security, coupled with specific guidance that is remarkably 
thoughtful, especially given that it is the product of a bipartisan committee.
Finally, although the British could take credit for uncovering, in August 2006, 
the terrorist plot to blow up planes en route from the U.K. to the United States, 
that event did highlight what is generally an invisible, hard-to-measure dimension 
of homeland security success: the absence of attacks on the United States in the 
years immediately following 9/11. On the other hand, in retrospect, the eight years 
that passed between the first and final attacks on the World Trade Center show 
that even long lulls in violence within the United States cannot automatically be 
attributed to successful prevention.
Despite impressive progress, however, the gap between current capabilities and 
any reasonable standard of national preparedness remains vast. And it is more than 
the glaring problems in the response to (and recovery from) Katrina that indi-
cate that daunting problems remain. One indicator of deeper problems is the way 
resources have been geographically distributed, with allocations based largely on 
political power and standard pork-barrel politics rather than on any reasonable 
assessment of what constitutes high-risk targets. Another indicator has been the 
mind-boggling scale of local mismanagement of federal homeland-security money. 
A third, and perhaps the most revealing, has been the conflation of resentment 
directed against illegal Hispanic immigrants with homeland security. The involve-
ment of DHS in the political tug-of-war between anti-immigrant politics on the 
one hand and the alliance between a business community dependent on illegal 
labor along with liberal supporters of relatively open borders on the other, has 
shown that the national conception of homeland security itself remains vague and 
prone to politicization. (Whatever the merits of Mexican border fences and mass 
arrests of illegal immigrants, such a diversion of homeland-security resources away 
from efforts to stop terrorists arguably heightens the danger of future attacks.)
Indeed, it is the issue of borders that best illustrates the challenge of moving 
beyond the Cold War legacy of defenselessness. In one important sense, the advent 
of long-range airpower, and especially the addition of nuclear bombardment, for-
ever eradicated realistic hopes of reliably preventing attacks within one’s borders. 
If anything, the half-century of Cold War created a legacy in which the idea of a 
protected border was laughable. (During the debate in the 1980s over President 
Reagan’s call for a population defense against nuclear missiles, former Secretary 
of Defense Robert McNamara used to joke that even an effective missile defense 
system would be worthless since the Soviets could simply cross the border from 
Mexico with nuclear bombs hidden inside bales of marijuana.) Although the con-
sequences of a failure to guard our borders and other points of entry were made 
dramatically evident on 9/11, the optimal role of border security remains an open 
question, the answer to which can only be drawn from a strategic perspective on 
homeland security as a whole.
The origins of civil defense lay in the walled city, which from ancient times 
until the Middle Ages provided physical protection for its inhabitants. The shift 

Assured Vulnerability  n  45
in advantage from defense to offense, starting with the invention of gunpowder 
in the fourteenth century, meant that the walls of cities could no longer provide 
safety, and contributed to the consolidation of the larger political unit represented 
by the modern state.22 If 9/11 seems to call for some modern state-level resurrec-
tion of the walled city, it may well be the case that we have reached a stage, as a 
result of the forces of globalization, in which reliance on state borders may be 
becoming as anachronistic as the walls and moats around cities became in modern 
Europe. Although it is evident that defense has a critical role to play in the security 
of those who live within the United States (and within other threatened states), it 
is also true that decisions about allocating roles and resources between offense and 
defense and within the different components of the defensive mission can only 
be specified in terms of a strategic conception of the foundations of safety in the 
globalization era.
Unfortunately, notwithstanding the considerable merits of various improvised 
responses to 9/11, and however laudable have been some of the early steps toward 
thinking more rigorously, there is little evidence that we have overcome the cul-
tural and intellectual inertia of historical defenselessness. Multiple future attacks 
on a scale similar to 9/11 no doubt would alter this traditional lack of commitment 
to defense. Thus, Israeli defense experts, whose country has managed to preserve 
a semblance of normal life within the borders of a state under constant terrorist 
attack (nearly all of which are stopped), sometimes point out that the U.S. failure 
to transform homeland security is largely the result of not having been attacked 
enough to force an effective defensive response. Since we obviously wish to avoid 
that particular path toward wisdom, it is worth briefly considering what has to 
change. In concluding this chapter, I will describe four interlocking areas in which 
we can hope for and, perhaps in some cases, help prod progress. The first concerns 
political leadership, the second addresses the role of defense intellectuals, the third 
is the realm of cultural change within the community of homeland security profes-
sionals, and the last (though hardly the least) concerns the role of education.
The Unfinished Task of Inventing Homeland Security
After the failures surrounding Katrina, and as investigatory journalism documents 
how, in an evasion of responsibility of historic proportions, the Bush administra-
tion invaded Iraq in 2003 without even a rudimentary plan for how to occupy 
the country,23 it is apparent that President Bush and his administration were not 
up to the challenges—offensive and defensive—posed by 9/11. One dimension of 
that failure of leadership was the administration’s reflexive dependence on the U.S. 
tradition of relying on the offense to resolve its security challenges. Thus, President 
Bush often offered some version of his assertion that “we will engage enemies in 
these countries [Iraq and Afghanistan] abroad so we do not have to face them here 
at home.” Similarly, Vice President Cheney insisted that “wars are not won on 

46  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
the defensive. … [W]e have only one option—and that’s to take the fight to the 
enemy.”24
Although it is obviously true that offense is a crucial component of the current 
struggle, the national leadership failed to articulate the limitations (and possible 
dangers) of an offense-dominant war-fighting strategy. One dimension of the inad-
equacy of relying on the offense, as Stephen Flynn has pointed out, is that “there 
is no central front on which al Qaeda and its radical jihadist imitators can be 
cornered and destroyed.” That observation has two implications. First, it suggests 
why the ultimate defeat of the threat lies outside of the realm either of offense or of 
defense; that is, victory must ultimately address the reasons why violent religious 
extremists attract support.
Second, when combined with the extended reach and destructive potential of 
terrorism under conditions of globalization, it means that in contrast to past United 
States wars, offense simply cannot substitute for defense. There is thus no alternative 
to devoting substantial resources toward the development of meaningful defenses. 
Once those basic aspects of current reality are recognized, it is the inescapable 
responsibility of leadership to identify realistic standards of defensive preparedness 
deemed vital for national security, realistically to assess the costs, the time, and the 
reorientation of national priorities required to reach that level, and to undertake a 
patient, effective process of communication that aims to persuade (i.e., to inspire) 
the American public to make the necessary sacrifices and bear the costs.
The fact that a series of U.S. leaders failed that test during the Cold War, 
alternating empty, short-lived appeals to “duck and cover” with the obsessive con-
struction, decade after decade, of a nuclear arsenal large enough to exterminate 
all of humankind, has not made it easier for their successors in the post-9/11 era. 
Leadership will require thinking creatively about future requirements in a radi-
cally changed strategic environment, breaking free of a Cold War fixation almost 
exclusively on the offense that was foolhardy then and irrelevant now. The first U.S. 
president in the post-9/11 era and his administration failed to meet that challenge.
The Role of Defense Intellectuals
One outcome of the simultaneous advent of the nuclear age and a bipolar world 
was the emergence of the field of security studies. The leading lights among the 
first generation to come to grips with that transformed security environment (e.g., 
Bernard Brodie, George Kennan, Herman Kahn, Glenn Snyder, Thomas Schelling, 
Albert Wohlstetter, et al.) approached the challenge of their times with a level of 
strategic vision and analytical rigor that has, so far, not been matched by current 
thinkers. The issue here is not who was then right or wrong about different aspects 
of the problems confronting national and international security. The point is that, 
while there is no current shortage of experts who cogently address important ele-
ments of strategy and tactics in the struggle against Islamist extremism, security 

Assured Vulnerability  n  47
studies has yet to produce works that fundamentally engage and illuminate the new 
strategic environment.
If political leadership, as always, will be critical, sound policy will have to rest 
on a foundation of deeper inquiry into grand strategy than has so far emerged. 
Topics as diverse as border security, intelligence sharing, nation building, and inte-
gration of Muslim communities in the developed (and secular) West, will either 
be located within some common vision (or debate over persuasive claimants to an 
integrated vision), or policy will never achieve a sense of coherence and reasonably 
steady direction. Whatever the virtues of the notion of “containment,” it provided 
an answer to the questions of “security for what and whom?” and “security against 
what and whom?” In the age of globalization, those questions that touch on ulti-
mate questions of identity and legitimacy have to be re-asked and re-answered.
Developing Defense Orientations Within 
Homeland-Security Strategic Culture
In his 2004 Strategic Plan for homeland security, then DHS Secretary Tom Ridge 
offered the following as one of the three guiding principles of his department: “We 
will blend 22 previously disparate agencies, each with its employees, mission and 
culture into a single, unified Department whose mission is to secure the home-
land.” 25 Katrina of course made the lack of common organizational culture within 
the DHS painfully obvious, even as it simultaneously revealed a number of equally 
consequential divides: between the military and civilian authorities, between cities 
and states, and between states and the federal government. At these levels of inter-
action, cultural divides tend to be largely self-sustaining, despite noble and often 
capable efforts to enhance integration. Far-reaching and durable integration can 
only occur when something galvanizes the enormous number of bureaucratic and 
political fiefdoms that inhabit the realm of “homeland security.”
The external force can come in several forms that may be somewhat distinct or 
mutually reinforcing: (1) recognition of a common threat whose magnitude drives 
home the aphorism that “we must all hang together or we will all hang separately”; 
(2) leadership (exemplified in the modern era by Winston Churchill), whose inspi-
rational power makes it seem almost possible to explain heroic national commit-
ment to the common defense in terms of the vision of a single individual; and (3) 
grassroots activism, in which new organizations, ranging from intensely motivated 
groups to mass movements, challenge, reform, or replace regimes seen as unrep-
resentative, or paralyzed by division, or corrupt, or simply out of touch with the 
demands of the time.
Of those three categories of possibility, it is hard to glean much potential guid-
ance. After all, we all hope to avoid future terrorist attacks, however motivating 
they might be in overcoming frustrating problems of integration at the level of 

48  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
bureaucratic and electoral politics. And while we all would wish for the sort of 
future national leader who can offer the commanding vision and practical ideas to 
build a working consensus among the myriad semiautonomous entities that gov-
ern America, the election of such a leader is a matter of good fortune. Finally, it is 
also hard to imagine how a largely apathetic public (however roused momentarily 
either by bouts of panic or jokes about using duct tape to protect themselves) can 
ever inspire a movement that can result in real change when it comes to homeland 
security.
One way in which a relatively small number of interested individuals has tried 
to effect change is in the field of education. Education that incorporates the strate-
gic challenges described in this chapter can help to enhance homeland security in 
numerous ways. At the undergraduate and particularly at the graduate levels, it can 
raise awareness of the sorts of hurdles identified in the rapidly expanding homeland 
security literature (drawing as well from such related fields as international rela-
tions, human rights, religious studies, and economics). Students carry that educa-
tion into their professions, hopefully combined with practical training in the nuts 
and bolts dimensions of preparedness. They bring a broad perspective that resists 
the “stove pipes” or bureaucratic constraints they are certain to encounter within 
every agency at every level of government. In the ideal case, students educated 
in homeland security will emerge as leaders in different levels of government and 
begin to take practical actions that elevate the sense of common purpose.
One way that process can be expedited is for farsighted homeland security lead-
ers who are conscious of the absence of historical institutions, practices, and beliefs 
supportive of the common defense, to invest in homeland security education for 
themselves and their subordinates. Beyond that, they can also hire the new genera-
tion of aspiring homeland security professionals who are beginning to emerge from 
the best programs in the country.
There is now a short post-9/11 history of homeland security education. Within 
a year, programs began to pop up in diverse places, and the active interest of the 
first commander of Northern Command, General Ralph Eberhardt, made possible 
the founding (and funding) to build what is now called the Homeland Security/
Defense Education Consortium (HS/DEC). While this is not the place to tell the 
story of the struggle to educate the present and future community of homeland 
security professionals, it is worth noting that the tale is complete with both heroes 
(who have worked hard to develop the programs needed to impart a strategic per-
spective and the necessary skills) and villains (who have obstructed the endeavor 
by placing their own struggles for bureaucratic turf or personal control above the 
national interest). The single largest barrier to progress has been the self-perpetuat-
ing chaos of the Department of Homeland Security, which has tended neither to 
support education for its staff (beyond the training programs born in the disparate 
agencies that coexist just short of sectarian violence) nor to establish an organized 
program to identify and hire the potential future leaders emerging out of top home-
land security programs around the country. More than anything else, the failure of 

Assured Vulnerability  n  49
DHS to support homeland security education ensures that the acknowledgments 
we endlessly hear of the need for “vision” and “integration” in the speeches of DHS 
secretaries will remain empty rhetoric.
In the face of the enormity of the need to advance homeland security more 
rapidly, more intelligently, and more sustainably than it has progressed in the years 
since 9/11, support for education may seem an unduly modest (even uninterest-
ing) concept. Yet it is an indispensable albeit incremental source of change, and 
in a complex world of evolving, increasingly dangerous terrorist threats, it is vital. 
Thus, more educational endeavors need to be launched and institutionalized—
efforts designed to build and improve integrated networks in the United States 
and between allied states in the war on terror. Since we cannot afford to wait either 
for more attacks or more capable presidents and administrations, education is the 
most reliable foundation for the long-term project of reshaping national and orga-
nizational cultures so as finally to move homeland security—however saddening its 
necessity—from the margins to the mainstream of national life.

central to civil defense (e.g., shelters, evacuation, emergency assistance, fire-fighting, 
etc.) than to military programs such as anti-aircraft defenses, antimissile defenses, or

been any serious national preoccupation with attacks that could substantially disrupt 
the social and economic life of the country. (An argument could be made, though, 
that labor unrest in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century came close.) 
Though one could also argue that the Civil War made homeland security (for both 
sides) a critical concern, it makes more sense to set aside that time of two “home-
lands” from any assessment of U.S. attitudes toward defense.

Chapter 4
Terrorism and 
Deterrence by Denial
James M. Smith and Brent J. Talbot*
The authors break new, important strategic ground in 
their application of deterrence by denial of capability 
(the operational level), opportunity (the tactical level), 
and objectives sought by groups, movements, or insur-
gencies considering the use of terrorism as a tactic to 
advance their cause (the strategic level). The approach 
flows from a causal analysis of what leads to the use of 
terrorist tactics in the first place. Strategy implementa-
tion calls for pursuing both external or international 
actions—the “away game” as well as various domes-
tic measures—the “home game.” Success comes from 
efforts to marginalize the terrorist message and deter or 
preclude attainment of terrorist objectives, thus defeat-
ing strategically the group, movement, or insurgency 
threatening the U.S. homeland.
*	 The views expressed in this chapter are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the 
official policy or position of the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, or 
the U.S. Government.

54  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Conventional wisdom holds that terrorists and terrorism cannot be deterred: terror-
ists do not fear punishment or death, nor do they possess the territory and popu-
lation of a state, and they are therefore immune from psychological coercion via 
threat of retaliation. We argue, however, that deterrence—specifically psychological 
coercion through denial as opposed to traditional deterrence by punishment—can 
not only be applied to terrorism, but also can be utilized at the tactical, operational, 
and strategic levels for an overall coercive effect. In developing this application, the 
chapter presents terrorism as a dynamic process described by interrelated essential 
elements and communication flows. It then presents concepts of deterrence as these 
enter into this dynamic process and disrupt its elements and linkages, thus shaping 
coercive influences, removing terrorist options, and forcing decisions that alter ter-
rorist plans and actions.
At the base or tactical level the operative coercive mechanism for deterrence of 
an act of terrorism is denial of opportunity, which delinks the terrorist action cadre 
from its intended victim or victims. At the higher operational level—deterrence of 
a series of related terrorist actions or a campaign of terror—the mechanism is denial 
of capability, which disrupts organizational recruitment and maintenance, training, 
access to weapons and sanctuary, communications, finance, and other resources 
needed to undertake hostile actions. At the highest and most important or strategic 
level—deterrence of terrorism itself or defeat of the strategy—the mechanism is 
denial of objectives, or marginalization of the terrorist message from both its target 
population and its support base, leading to ultimate failure.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of how to implement a framework 
to create these effects, with specific attention to both international perception 
and influence, and domestic preparation and insulation. A wide range of efforts 
is required to create the synergistic deterrent effect within and across the tactical, 
operational, and strategic levels. Cognizant that terrorism is a form of strategic 
communication, implementation must be informed by the effort to use interna-
tional effects and influence to shape messages to and among the regional and global 
terrorist “core” audience and potential supporters, and domestic effects that shape 
both U.S. government and population reactions to terrorist threats and actions. 
Only this total, deliberate, and strategic approach can achieve a deterrent effect on 
this otherwise intractable adversary.
Terrorism as a Dynamic Process
The term “terrorism” is today used to describe a wide range of tactics, campaigns, 
and strategies of criminal and political violence. This chapter is specifically 
addressed to terrorism as deliberate violence undertaken for political objectives, 
with the attainment of these objectives resulting from psychological effects on tar-
gets beyond the direct victims of the violence. We look to second- and third-order 
psychological effects of political violence—an examination that goes well beyond 

Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial  n  55
the physical act, weapon, and victim to the larger motivation, preparation, and 
orchestration of terrorism and the terrorist, as well as to the instrumental creation 
of fear or terror as the primary lever seeking to cause changes in government policy 
and action, particularly in driving popular demands on that government for the 
changes sought. At the same time, the act sends messages to create, deepen, and 
reinforce support for the terror and the terrorist group among its core audience, 
and it seeks to engender sympathy and support among wider regional and global 
audiences to foster its cause and secure both general and tangible support. It is 
both political violence and psychological communication—sometimes called “pro-
paganda of the deed”—undertaken as asymmetrical warfare against an otherwise 
superior adversary.1
One way to conceptualize terrorism, and to design effective anticipatory and 
response efforts toward deterrence, is to depict it as a systematic process (a cause to 
action to effects chain, as depicted horizontally in Figure 4.1). The focal point for 
much of the terrorism analysis we see is the terrorist act—the terrorist committing 
a violent act employing some weapon against a selected victim. Although the ter-
rorist, the act, the weapon, and the victim constitute an important tactical level of 
analysis relevant to responders and to the overall effort to combat terrorism, it is 
insufficient either to understand fully or to respond effectively to the threat. The 
process model we develop here adds the operational and organizational underpin-
nings to the terrorist and his act, and it also includes the essential consequences and 
audiences terrorized or influenced by such acts.
The operational level of analysis—a focus on cause and organizational 
response—adds the foundation and structure of terror, from its underlying causes 
and roots of discontent through the organizing infrastructure of recruitment, train-
ing, support, communications, weapons procurement—all that goes into motivat-
ing, organizing, preparing, supporting, and sustaining a quasi-military structure 
and strategy. It also includes focus on the complex psychological and organizational 
transformation from discontent to violence, or the action link that brings all of 
those motives and capabilities to the act of terrorist violence.
Terrorism does not end with the act of violence; that is only the beginning. It 
is the fear generated in the minds of the target audiences—not the victim—that 
provides the lever through (and only through) which the terrorist organization can 
hope to attain its objectives. Terrorism is a tool used by the relatively weak to 
attack a strong adversary, an asymmetrical tool that bypasses adversary strengths 
and seeks out the soft and vulnerable underbelly of society as the focus of influence. 
It is this second-order psychological effect on the “target of terror” that is the key 
to influencing adversary decisions and policies. The terrorist act also is to reinforce 
and expand the group’s influence on and support from its core support base, its 
broader regional or cultural base, and even the global audience—all “targets of 
influence.”2

56  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial3
Viewing terrorism as an interactive process as briefly outlined above indicates 
points of attack for an effective strategic response. These components and the 
dynamics between them define the terrorist group; its critical characteristics; and 
its operational, tactical, and strategic dimensions. They also point to its relative 
strengths and weaknesses, indicating potential responses to counter effectively its 
key strengths and capitalize on its weaknesses. Terrorism can be blunted—its dam-
age prevented, deflected, or limited by tactical response policy elements. And it can 
be preempted or altered, even ultimately defeated, by strategic countermeasures 
that target and attack its operational and strategic bases or operational centers. 
This process context—its essential elements developed and related within an over-
arching strategic perspective—is at the center of both the terrorist threat and the 
strategic response to that threat. It provides not only a template for a comprehensive 
threat assessment, but also a framework for systematic response.
Tactical Level: Deterrence by Denial of Opportunity
The tactical level of deterrence aims at prevention of an act or acts of terrorism. 
It seeks to delink terrorism from its victim. This can be accomplished by denying 
either the victim access to the terrorist through protection and hardening or by 
denying the terrorist access to the victim or weapon through efforts to block entry 
and obstruct movement. Potential “victims” with high value and high symbolic vis-
ibility can be protected through physical means and protective measures. Making it 
difficult to reach or attack specific victims can cause terrorists to look elsewhere or 
to change (delay or defer) their decisions to act. Making it difficult to gain entry to 
the country, to travel with impunity within the vicinity of the priority victim, or to 
access weapons of choice or their essential components can also have this preventive 
effect.
Another key point here is that if short-term deterrence fails and an act of terror-
ism does occur, then the visible effectiveness of the response can have strong and 
larger-scale deterrent effects toward future acts and continued terrorism. An effec-
tive implementation of crisis and consequence management—strength of response, 
rescue, recovery, and clear leadership within those efforts—will limit the degree of 
“terror” in the local and national population, blunt the fear, and shorten the period 
of major psychological impact.
Accurate and timely attribution of the attack to the responsible party or parties 
and identification of weapons components employed by these terrorists will allow 
decisive retribution and a clear chain of movement toward effective prosecution of 
both perpetrators and their weapons suppliers. Rapid recovery followed by both 
symbolic and substantial reconstruction and reconstitution also will blunt much 
of the long-term effect. This limits the “terror” outcome and it helps with the stra-

tegic preparation of the population for a sustained campaign to combat terrorism, 
also limiting the likelihood of the terrorist obtaining any favorable effect through 
future attacks. Less than fully effective deterrence today does not signal total fail-
ure; today’s attack response can contribute significantly to tomorrow’s strengthened 
deterrent outcomes.
Operational Level: Deterrence by Denial of Capability
Actions that contribute to effective deterrence at the operational level address the 
organizational and operational process. In organizational terms, the United States 
can seek to affect the legitimacy and attractiveness of the organization’s cause, its 
ability to recruit members and supporters, and most significantly its process of 
socialization and mobilization toward violent action. These are often broadly based 
and long-term counterterrorism efforts.
Shorter-term actions include attempts to disrupt the operational process by 
removing access to sanctuary and open support, putting and keeping terrorist 
leadership underground and on the run. Terrorist action can be disrupted by 
denying access to weaponry—at least its worst forms—training grounds and 
resources, free movement and associated travel documents, secure communica-
tions, and finance.
With effective intelligence and international support, we can sometimes preempt 
terror preparations and attack. We can interdict these organizational and operational 
processes, and we can at least limit group capabilities and attack severity. In the end, 
we seek to isolate the terrorist from support bases and sources of sanctuary, and to 
limit the ability even to undertake acts of terrorism.
Strategic Level: Deterrence by Denial of Objectives
Strategic deterrence of terrorism is aimed at creating the clear perception in the 
mind of the terrorist leadership that their goals cannot be achieved by means of a 
terror campaign against the United States; their strategy cannot succeed, and any 
action on their part can only leave them exposed to all levels of audience as ineffec-
tive, irrelevant, and unworthy of attention or support. This level of deterrent action 
builds from the tactical and operational levels specifically to limit the psychological 
vulnerability and to build the psychological strength of the target—in this case the 
United States public and its government.
Preparing the American target to mute the effects of terrorism is, first, a func-
tion of education prior to attack. Fear of the misunderstood magnifies the impact 
of terrorism, and knowing something about the true weakness and understanding 
the morally bankrupt foundation of the terrorist cause can provide an effective 
damper on the generation of “terror.” Knowing what is going on across an attack 
through open and nonsensational information is essential to limiting fear. These 

Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial  n  59
effects, along with strong and visible tactical and operational efforts to prevent and 
respond to terror, will go far toward insulating the target from the full, desired 
terrorist reaction. Effective prevention, mitigation, and response combine to mar-
ginalize and mute the terrorist message. Since the terrorist is already an ineffective, 
marginal player on the global stage in all other dimensions of power and influence, 
such a negative impact on his strategic “message” dooms him to failure. Terrorism 
without “terror” cannot succeed as a political strategy, and failure ultimately will 
feed on itself, destroying the terrorist cause and effort.
All of these levels and components of terrorism and deterrence are graphically 
displayed in Figure 4.2. While that depiction only provides the framework for 
deterring terrorism, the following discussion of implementation gets at the broad, 
combined, and synergistic effects on the target audiences of terrorism and of the 
response; the international and domestic audiences, or targets of influence and tar-
gets of terror. It is ultimately here that success or failure for the United States or for 
the terrorist is written.
International Implementation—the “Away Game”
The implementation of the components of a comprehensive, synergistic strategy has 
to be centered on the international community since the most significant threats 
to the United States stem from transnational terrorism. This represents the “away 
game” within the overall effort, focusing on affecting the terrorists before they 
manifest their threats in the U.S. homeland, and specifically on the “targets of 
influence” that provide essential support, sanctuary, and sustenance to the terror-
ists and terrorism. This effort, besides the operational preemption and interdiction 
actions mentioned above, centers on creating operational and strategic effects to 
deny terrorist capabilities and attainment of the objectives of terror. The success 
of our strategy to combat terrorism depends significantly on the image and influ-
ence of the United States in the regional and cultural world from which this threat 
stems.
International implementation efforts must first identify the target population 
that provides the terrorists with recruits as well as a support base. Second, with the 
target population in mind, we must develop an influence strategy that marginalizes 
the terrorist message, which means we must initially define the core message at the 
strategic level, and then outline appropriate counters against it. This simply boils 
down to getting out the real truth. Finally, we must also offset the operational-level 
propaganda efforts of the terrorists that attempt to mask the rationale for U.S. 
military operations in their region of concern while at the same time distorting 
the truth behind their own involvement in terror attacks, which attempt to draw 
implausible parallels to “just causes.” Terrorists might even devise conspiracy theo-
ries designed to inspire doubt as to who are the real instigators of acts of terror. At 
the operational level we can also use the media to analyze the results of terrorist

attacks and point out to the targets of influence that often those attacks leave many 
innocents as victims—including members of the target of influence populations, 
which if properly publicized, could turn significant numbers of supporters against 
the attacks.
Identifying and Influencing the Target Population
The primary locus for U.S. strategy in combating terrorism today is found within 
the Muslim world. As the basis for the rest of this analysis, we will focus on the 
application of this process model to the Muslim world. Even though Muslims com-
prise over 1.3 billion members worldwide, Richard Clarke, former terrorist “czar” 
in the Clinton and early-Bush administrations, subdivides the Muslim population 
into three concentric circles. The outermost circle comprises all 1.3 billion Muslims 
worldwide—most being “absorbed in their daily lives with no inclination to terror 
or extremism.” By contrast, the innermost circle is made up of extremist Islamists, 
perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 radical “jihadists bent on the West’s destruction, and 
against whom hard power is the only viable response.” In the middle, however, are 
millions of Muslims either living in the West or Western-educated who, under the 
right circumstances, could be persuaded to support terrorism. According to Clarke, 
this is the group the United States “most urgently needs to cultivate.”4
From a strategic perspective, influencing this particular group is the best means 
of cutting support to the core radicals who are unable to sustain a global jihad on 
their own. The growth of extremist groups like al-Qaeda in terms of both recruit-
ment and popularity depends on developing supporters within this middle group. 
They are reliant on these supporters for political and economic support as well as 
safe-haven in states where they are persecuted by the governments, such as Saudi 
Arabia and Egypt.
Terrorism is not a randomly occurring process, so what could motivate this 
middle group to support acts of terror? Many scholars recognize that a perceived 
sense of deprivation provides a strong motive for violence. Pillar identifies two pre-
cursors relevant to the surfacing of terrorist groups and those sympathetic to their 
cause: (1) “political repression and an accompanying lack of self-determination” and 
(2) the poor “socioeconomic prospects of populations that are, or may become, the 
breeding stock for terrorists.”5 Related is Rapoport’s assessment describing modern 
terrorism as a “religiously inspired fourth wave” based upon “anti-globalization … 
tension between the have and have-not nations … the elite and underprivileged. … 
In an era where reforms occur at a pace much slower than is desired, terrorists … 
exploit the frustrations of the common people (especially in the Arab world).”6
Although conditions of poverty and political repression remain commonplace 
throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds, as indeed they have existed historically, it 
is particularly in regions or countries experiencing increased urbanization and the 
interconnectedness of globalization that populations become aware of their under-

62  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
privileged status, terror directed against outsiders or oppressors becoming a tool 
for mobilization. Education is a key difference between those in the middle group 
enabled politically and the outermost circle of the Muslim masses less prone to 
engage in political activities. Terrorist groups can exploit awareness brought about 
by education and subsequent attempts to engage in politics that are repressed by 
government. Islam becomes a tool for mobilization against the perceived injustices 
of the state. After all, Islam is a religion calling for an end to injustice, sharing of 
wealth to help the poor, and reverence for God above the state.
Given its access to education, this media-savvy middle group—the target 
population—can be influenced to turn its support away from the jihadists who, 
of course, are themselves increasingly prone to use the same media to advance 
their cause. Moreover, educational awareness is also prevalent among the Muslim 
diaspora—those who have migrated to countries outside of the Arab and Muslim 
worlds. In fact, the sense of relative deprivation is perhaps greater between immi-
grants and native populations, particularly in Europe and North America where 
Muslims are a minority unable to climb social ladders to the same degree of success. 
Indeed, the Club de Madrid summit on terrorism held in March 2005 claimed that 
80 percent of new recruits to the global jihadist movement are Muslim immigrants 
or refugees.7
If the extremist core is recruited primarily outside the Arab or Muslim states, 
then it follows that sympathizers are at least as likely to come from immigrant 
sources. Those outside the Middle East are also more likely to be educated and 
have surplus resources with which they might support terrorist causes. When one 
considers that the London, Madrid, and even 9/11 attackers were all Muslim immi-
grants—or in the more recent cases, those born to immigrants in the West—it 
follows that radicalism is just as likely to rear its head among Muslim immigrants 
as among those who remain in the Middle East. This also means that an influence 
campaign should not limit itself to the Middle East arena, but also focus on global 
media sources referenced by the Muslim diaspora, particularly Muslim sources 
emanating in Europe and North America.
In sum, an influence campaign against Islamic-inspired terrorism should focus 
on the middle group identified by Clarke. These educated Muslims, many of whom 
live outside the Middle East, are deprived politically and economically and are thus 
the most likely supporters of the global jihad inspired by al-Qaeda actions against 
the United States. Strategic and operational elements of the influence campaign are 
spelled out below.
Denial Strategy—Marginalizing the Terrorist Message
A corresponding effort must focus on development of a proper influence strategy 
to marginalize the terrorist message, which means we must first define the mes-
sage. In the case of al-Qaeda, its longer-term, overall goal apparently is to bring 

Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial  n  63
about a “new world order.” Its terror campaign is aimed at the United States and 
Israel because they make up what it labels the “far-away enemy.” This far-away 
enemy is distinct from the “near enemy”—the corrupt Arab and other Muslim 
state governments that prevent the implementation of sharia (God’s law) and whose 
existence prevents the unification of the umma (the Muslim community) under a 
single caliphate (understood to be a divinely inspired government). It is Western 
governments, particularly the United States, that protect corrupt Muslim govern-
ments from overthrow by their own populations.
Al-Qaeda also believes the United States is interested in dominating and subju-
gating the region (aided by its Zionist client state, Israel) because of its oil resources, 
and due to a religious divide—God-fearing Muslims versus Godless, materialis-
tic, Westerners—the United States blamed for initiating what Samuel Huntington 
refers to as a “clash of civilizations.” Thus, based upon fatwas (religious rulings) and 
other pronouncements issued in the past by al-Qaeda leaders such as Osama bin 
Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri,8 the far-away enemy must be driven from Muslim 
lands to save Islam from destruction; the jihadists are to effect the downfall of cor-
rupt governments, ushering in a return of the caliphate.
Countering this al-Qaeda appeal is complicated by the early error by President 
Bush, alluding to a “crusade” against terrorism that, consistent with Huntington’s 
clash-of-civilizations thesis, was interpreted in the Muslim world as the latest chap-
ter of anti-Muslim efforts—a direct, historical reminder of the European Christian 
campaign to recapture the Holy Land during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. 
This slip of the tongue—repeated frequently in Middle East media—set the context 
in many minds for an adverse interpretation of U.S. actions in the region. It was 
relatively easy for bin Laden and others to liken U.S. interventions in Afghanistan 
and Iraq to modern crusades aimed at destroying Islam in those regions.
An influence campaign at the strategic level should refute the al-Qaeda and 
other terrorist messages directly, attempting at the same time to make the Arab 
and Muslim worlds well aware of U.S. public and private assistance to Muslims 
worldwide. This counter-message should also highlight respect for religious prac-
tices of Muslims and others within the United States and underscore the freedoms 
and economic successes enjoyed by American Muslims. The generosity of both 
public and private American donors to charitable causes should be made known as 
a counter to the image of America as if it were a corrupt and Godless nation bent 
only on material gain.
Denial of Capability: Public Diplomacy and 
Disrupting Recruitment and Retention
Next we turn to a discussion of the means of disrupting terrorists at the operational 
level. At this level, terrorists fighting the global jihad have distorted the rationale 
for U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Jihadists paint an image of the United 

64  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
States bent on making war against Islam in order to control Muslim oil. But this 
can be countered by comparing U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War—to liberate 
Kuwait from Iraqi occupation and to defend another Muslim country, Saudi Ara-
bia. In fact, the United States neither took control of Kuwaiti oil, nor did the U.S. 
forces residing in Saudi Arabia stay in place but, rather, subsequently withdrew 
from Saudi soil. The message needs to underscore that the U.S. military is not in 
the Middle East to stay or to occupy territory.
A related operational-level concern is al-Qaeda’s attempts to justify each indi-
vidual attack with its overall rationale for global jihad. Osama bin Laden went to 
great lengths to legitimize the September 11 suicide hijackings as a logical extension 
of the Palestinian suicide bombings against Israel, which began in earnest after 
the failure of the Camp David peace talks during the summer of 2000. By 2001, 
images of Israeli repression and Palestinian funerals filled Middle Eastern airwaves, 
which in bin Laden’s view provided sufficient legitimacy on the Arab street for his 
massive suicide attack plan.
Still, a famous al-Jazeera television cleric condemned the hijackings by stating 
that “the anti-Israeli suicide attacks of the Palestinians could be justified as martyr-
dom … since they were part of a defensive jihad aimed at reclaiming Palestinian 
Islamic land that had been usurped by the Jews … [But, the] September 11 hijack-
ers [were] suicides rather than martyrs, because, contrary to Muslim teachings, 
they had unduly taken the lives Allah had given them …the difference … was that 
America is not a legitimate target of defensive jihad.”  9
Such condemnations against al-Qaeda’s operational justification for September 
11 and other attacks needs to be presented repeatedly to audiences to underscore 
how such terrorist actions are contrary to Islamic teachings, thus countering claims 
by al-Qaeda to the contrary.10 If a potential martyr doubts that his actions will lead 
him to paradise, then he is less likely to carry out his attack. But more importantly, 
doubts among potential terrorist supporters hurt recruitment and retention neces-
sary to sustain operations.
Still, CIA expert Michael Scheuer asserts that “U.S. public diplomacy cannot 
negate the impressions formed by real-time video from Palestine, Iraq, and Afghan-
istan that shows Muslims battling aggressive Western forces, thus validating in 
their minds bin Laden’s claim that the West intends to destroy Islam.”11 Scheuer 
believes that ultimately it is the radical Islamists who have the upper hand when 
it comes to control of the Arab media. Be that as it may, the Arab media are not 
really so monolithic. Western efforts to influence Middle East publics are an uphill 
contest, but an important one nonetheless.
Another factor often contributing to resistance against condemning known ter-
rorists is the widespread belief in conspiracy theories. Rumors after the September 
11 attacks, for example, initially blamed the Israeli Mossad (Secret Service) or in 
some instances even the CIA, for the attacks in New York and Washington, and 
some even went so far as to claim that e-mail was sent to all Jews working at the 
World Trade Center informing them to stay home on that tragic date. So why 

Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial  n  65
do people cling to conspiracy theories? Johnson reports that “while the idea of a 
Muslim hero standing up to the United States has appeal, many Muslims remain 
deeply disturbed by terrorist tactics.”12 They do not want to believe such acts could 
be carried out in the name of Islam, defiling the very religion the attacks were sup-
posed to defend. Publicizing admissions of responsibility for terrorist actions as 
well as counterarguments to the conspiracy theories that abound in this region of 
the world are essential if the West is to have any opportunity at all to counter the 
claims of terrorist groups.
Domestic Implementation—the “Home Game”
The international or “away game” is critical to the success of the comprehensive 
effort to deter and defeat terrorism; however, the domestic components of the strat-
egy or “home game” are also critical to achieving the overall synergy that defines 
success. Terrorism must be attacked before, during, and after it is carried out. The 
domestic effort is aimed directly at preparing and mitigating impacts on the “target 
of terror,” generating tactical and strategic effects to deny terrorists the opportunity 
to achieve their objectives. The domestic effort certainly revolves around the actions 
taken to harden victims against attack, to limit terrorist access to those victims, and 
to limit access to weapons of choice to carry out attacks. These actions contribute to 
effective prevention of terrorist attacks. The “home game” equally involves efforts 
to mitigate the effects of attacks that do take place. And the mitigation, response, 
and recovery actions during and after a terrorist attack that is not prevented all 
contribute to longer-term strategic deterrent effects against terrorism.
Educating and Preparing Domestic Publics
Uncertainty and a lack of understanding breed fear, magnify the already negative 
emotions generated by casualties and destruction of properties—both fueling and 
deepening the terror that flows from calculated acts of violence. On the other hand, 
education based on accurate information effectively delivered contributes to mental 
preparation and “hardening,” thus reducing to some degree adverse effects on the 
mass population. Education of this kind is needed well prior to any terrorist attack 
if such knowledge and understanding are to serve as a solid foundation for effective 
crisis communication and management.
Former Speaker of the House Thomas “Tip” O’Neill’s dictum on American 
politics (that “all politics are local”) also applies to the most fundamental level of 
domestic terrorism; all terrorism is local. The effects, the search for useful informa-
tion by the public in the face of crisis, and the fundamental propensity to experi-
ence greater or lesser degrees of fear—the depth and extent of “terror” generated 
by the incident—are all firmly rooted at the local level. In crises, one’s perceptions 

66  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
are reality, and local factors most significantly shape those perceptions of the most 
directly impacted “target” audience. Even those far removed from the immedi-
ate scene can be profoundly influenced by the role of the news media. In essence, 
“journalists are first responders”:13
This country isn’t ready to deal with a catastrophic terrorist attack, 
and government preparedness may not be the biggest problem. Indeed, 
one of the most critical parts of our infrastructure—the nation’s 
news media—doesn’t appear near the top of anyone’s list of concerns. 
They should be of utmost concern to those responsible for homeland 
security.14
We need clear, well-designed educational materials to address the technical and 
human dimensions of the threat, and we need a prepared noninflammatory chan-
nel of presentation for those materials in times of crisis. A comprehensive home-
land security strategy must capitalize on quality materials and experiences to target 
localized delivery of education and the information. It must involve establishing 
cooperative relations with local media outlets. This is not easy, as adversarial rela-
tions may exist between government and the media at various levels, but being able 
to harness the support of the media in extending information during these times of 
crisis is a critical variable in implementing a successful homeland security strategy.
The implementation of a comprehensive strategy to create deterrent effects 
requires measures at both international and domestic levels of implementation. 
These measures do require a strategic guiding hand to ensure comprehensive, com-
plementary implementation and synergistic deterrent effects. This coordination of 
the effort must remain a central area of emphasis at every level, including leader-
ships at the pinnacles of power and authority.
Concluding Comments
First, there is no one “magic bullet” that can be used to defeat terrorism. Terrorism 
aimed at the United States today is a complex, asymmetrical threat. And this threat 
demands an equally complex, asymmetrical, adaptive, and cumulative response 
package.
Second, each of the response actions and strategies is individually important. 
Each element of effective response advances the effort to blunt and defeat terror-
ism. As stated in the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism: “Ours is a strategy 
of direct and continuous action against terrorist groups, the cumulative effect of 
which will initially disrupt, over time degrade, and ultimately destroy the terrorist 
organizations.”15 We agree completely with that strategic response perspective.
Finally, even if all of the actions addressed are implemented immediately, ter-
rorist violence likely would still continue—at least in the short term. Over the 

Terrorism and Deterrence by Denial  n  67
longer term, however, the net effect can indeed be a deterrent effect, leading the 
terrorist leadership, core support base, and regional or ideological community to 
select other, less violent means of addressing their political, economic, and social 
grievances.

Chapter 5
The Importance 
of Multinational 
and Transnational 
Cooperation Strategies 
for Homeland Security
Veronica M. Kitchen and Gregory J. Moore1
 The authors underscore the importance of multilateral-
ism in the strategic effort to secure the American home-
land. The array of transnational networks and flows we 
find in globalization has altered the manner and speed 
with which states and peoples relate to one another. 
So too has globalization changed the way nations must 
organize and defend themselves, particularly in the 
face of an asymmetric threat from non-state actors. 
Because terrorists form networks, plan globally but 
act locally, exploit modern business and communica-
tions networks to inflict maximum damage, and launch 
cross-border attacks, this transnational threat requires 
a complex, transnational response. The authors con-
clude that strategic and creative thinking about theory 

70  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
and policy are urgently required. This will happen only 
when we recognize the importance of multinational and 
transnational cooperation and assure that it permeates 
all aspects of America’s homeland security strategy.
Much as the Second World War woke the United States from the isolationism of 
the interwar period, the 9/11 terrorist attacks woke the country from the idea that 
its territory was invulnerable. In the post-9/11 world, it is increasingly apparent 
that not only is the United States vulnerable to attack, but the nature of the threat 
is such that the United States can no longer defend itself without help from other 
countries, even in a task as fundamental as protecting U.S. soil. The threat from 
terrorism blurs the lines between foreign and domestic policy, rendering old notions 
of national security obsolete. We argue that the United States can only be secure 
from terrorist threats when it works with other states to take a multinational and 
transnational approach to homeland security. A globalized world makes such coop-
eration imperative and the United States’ homeland security strategy cannot merely 
be multinational. It must also be transnational, operating through networks at all 
levels of government and stretching to include allies of many stripes. We examine 
existing examples of U.S. cooperation on homeland security issues not only to show 
that this is already so to some degree, but also to highlight the pathologies of exist-
ing international cooperation to show where improvement is still necessary and 
possible.
The Bush administration’s 2002 National Strategy for Homeland Security out-
lined nine issue areas for international cooperation: creating smart borders, combat-
ing fraudulent travel documents, increasing the security of international shipping 
containers, intensifying international law enforcement operations, helping foreign 
nations fight terrorism, expanding the protection of transnational critical infra-
structure, amplifying international cooperation on the science and technology of 
homeland security, improving cooperation in response to attacks, and reviewing 
obligations to international treaties and law.2 These are homeland security issues 
in the sense that they contribute to the protection of Americans on U.S. soil, but 
undoubtedly cross boundaries in a way that territorial defense has rarely done in 
the past.
The blurred distinction between domestic and foreign policy responses to ter-
rorism leads us to prefer to discuss homeland security in this chapter in terms of 
what is commonly known as antiterrorism. We do so because of the distinction 
that is made between antiterrorism and counterterrorism, antiterrorism referring to 
defensive measures to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorism, whereas counterter-
rorism involves offensive measures toward reaching the same goal.
Thus, while we adopt a definition of homeland security as a coordinated effort 
to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, as well as to minimize dam-
age and to maximize recovery from attacks that do occur,3 for the purposes of this 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  71
chapter we define antiterrorism more precisely as the coordinated defensive effort 
to prevent attacks, minimize damage, and maximize recovery. Counterterrorism 
is not our primary focus here, and though we recognize that the line between 
counterterrorism and antiterrorism is more of an analytical and organizational con-
venience than an empirical fact, international cooperation on the counterterror 
aspects of homeland security has been extensively studied elsewhere,4 as has U.S. 
multinational cooperation on activities like targeting known terrorists in their safe 
areas and countries of origin.5 Our primary focus here is instead on the antiterror 
aspects of homeland security, for these have been understudied and homeland secu-
rity too often conceived of as strictly a domestic affair. This forward defense, or the 
“away game,” as the Pentagon calls it, influences homeland security in a number of 
ways. Preventing individuals and groups from adopting terrorism as a tactic in the 
first place is ultimately the most effective way of securing U.S. territory. Preventing 
terrorists and their weapons from getting close to the United States is also effective: 
every terrorist apprehended abroad is a terrorist that does not need to be appre-
hended on the home front. Thus, although counterterrorism and antiterrorism are 
intimately linked, a closer look at U.S. interests in multinational and transnational 
cooperation on the antiterror aspects of homeland security is revealing and long 
overdue.
Homeland Security and Globalization
Globalization has altered the manner and speed at which states and peoples relate 
to one another. So too has it changed the way nations must organize and defend 
themselves, particularly in the face of an asymmetric threat from nonstate actors, 
such as al-Qaeda, which use the forces of globalization against the nations and 
peoples who benefit from them. Relations along the spectrum from conflict to 
cooperation occur not just between central governments, or multinationally, but 
also transnationally, which is to say across borders at nonexecutive levels of govern-
ment, between subnational governments or government departments, and between 
private and nongovernmental actors.
International relations scholars have typically concentrated their attention on 
the foreign relations of central governments, as enacted by foreign ministries and 
militaries. It has become increasingly apparent that this focus is too narrow because 
most government ministries, the police, and the military have some level of involve-
ment beyond state borders. Furthermore, governments and entities below the cen-
tral government also have relations outside the state. This is particularly true in the 
realm of public safety and civil security, where local and state governments often 
hold more authority and responsibility than the federal government does. To this 
must be added public-private partnerships, international organizations such as the 
United Nations, partnerships between states and provinces across borders, interac-
tions between NGOs and international organizations, and many other relation-

72  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
ships. The result probably looks more like 3-D chess than international relations’ 
traditional levels of analysis. In a globalized world, traditional government-to-gov-
ernment cooperation is insufficient and only part of a larger picture.
These transnational networks and flows mean that securing U.S. territory and 
assets today is far different than it was in previous decades. Not only do the territo-
rial security interests of the United States exist in a virtual space that goes beyond 
its borders, but actors with intent to harm the United States may seek to use the 
same networks to achieve their goals. New technologies mean that accounting 
firms in Bangalore, India, can compete with those in Boston, Massachusetts, and 
that firms in Shenzhen, China, can supply U.S. computer makers with high-qual-
ity, low-cost parts through global supply chains and just-in-time delivery to firms 
in Toledo, Ohio. Globalization, however, has also increased the possibilities for 
asymmetric warfare.
Thomas Friedman traces contemporary globalization to several important devel-
opments he calls “flatteners.”6 In explaining globalization, or what he calls the “flat-
tening” of the world, Friedman notes that first, the end of the Cold War increased 
the number of people able to participate in the international capitalist economy. 
Second, globalization of business, with its focus on out-sourcing, in-sourcing, off-
shore production, global supply chains, and the horizontal diversification of firms, 
created a reliance on transnational infrastructure and networks. Third, the Internet 
reduced the conceptual space between people and between firms, enabling business 
transactions, the exchange of ideas, and collaboration on common projects like the 
Linux operating system or Wikipedia. Finally, the exponential growth of informa-
tion, as well as the digital, personal, and virtual technologies that allow people to 
access it, has amplified the other factors.7 This has enabled the United States to 
enjoy a large measure of prosperity, but it has also ensured a sense of vulnerability.
U.S. soil is less secure in an interconnected world. Like multinational corpora-
tions, international terrorist organizations form networks and franchises. Al-Qaeda 
forms alliances with locally operating groups with compatible aims. Just as global 
business has taken advantage of advances in technology and communications to 
create a globalized economy, al-Qaeda did the same to launch a globalized cam-
paign to achieve its political aims. Michael Mandelbaum nicely captures the prob-
lem posed by “enemies of the state” in a globalized world:
Think of Mao at the beginning of the Chinese communist revolution. 
The Chinese Communists had to hide in caves in northwest China, but 
they could move around in whatever territory they were able to control. 
Bin Laden, by contrast, can’t show his face, but he can reach every 
household in the world.8
Travel and communications of all sorts, including the Internet, satellite, cellular 
phones, and closed circuit technology, make it easier for terrorists to travel to and 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  73
work in their target countries, and easier as well to communicate with each other, 
and with media outlets, while doing so.9 These changes have also made the transfer 
of funds speedier, more convenient, and arguably easier to execute. To achieve their 
political goals, terrorists use, and sometimes seek to destroy, the same networks that 
enable globalization.
Reconceptualizing Defensive Homeland Security
Because terrorists form networks, plan globally but act locally, exploit modern busi-
ness and communications networks to inflict maximum damage, and launch cross-
border attacks, this transnational threat requires a complex, transnational response. 
The contemporary security environment looks as little like the Cold War’s mutually 
assured destruction (MAD) as MAD looked like the Battle of Waterloo. Re-imagin-
ing our security environment involves more than just acknowledging the existence 
of new actors like terrorist cells, firms, NGOs, and international organizations. 
Scholars towards the end of the Cold War advocated “broadening” and “deepen-
ing”10 the security agenda to encompass more than military threats by taking into 
account the possible consequences of biological, cyber, or environmental attacks, 
and to consider protecting individuals, cities, and/or industries. Re-imagining our 
security environment today requires more than just broadening and deepening; 
rather, it calls for a new conception of how different parts of the world and different 
actors are interconnected. International policy cooperation is often described as a 
regime: “implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision making proce-
dures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue area.”11 But regime 
theory assumes a unitary conception of actor-ness: governments tend to cooperate 
with other governments, or possibly with nongovernmental organizations.12
Anne-Marie Slaughter’s conception of transgovernmentalism illustrates the 
conceptual shift necessary to think strategically about cooperation in homeland 
security. We argue that for the United States, thinking strategically about home-
land security means that thinking about multinational and transnational coop-
eration must permeate each of the nine issue areas of the National Strategy for 
Homeland Security. Such thinking cannot be restricted to the Department of 
Homeland Security’s Office of International Affairs. Slaughter encourages us to 
think about a state as being made up of its component parts: agencies, judicial sys-
tems, legislatures, and bureaucracies. Each of these can make connections with its 
counterparts abroad, and together they may develop mechanisms for governance 
in their sectors. They may even delegate authority to a supranational organization. 
By Slaughter’s definition, a network is “a pattern of regular and purposive relations 
among like government units working across the borders that divide countries from 
one another and that demarcate the ‘domestic’ from the ‘international’ sphere.”13 
Together, these networks form the basis for a new kind of disaggregated global 
governance without global government:

74  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
… a disaggregated world order would be a world latticed by countless 
government networks. These would include horizontal networks and 
vertical networks; networks for collecting and sharing information of all 
kinds, for policy co-ordination, for enforcement cooperation, for tech-
nical assistance and training, perhaps ultimately for rule making. They 
would be bilateral, plurilateral, regional, or global. Taken together, they 
would provide the skeleton infrastructure for global governance.14
All of this is envisioned without challenging the basic sovereignty of nation-
states as we know them. While Slaughter focuses on the component units of cen-
tral governments, the idea can be expanded to include subnational governments, 
such as states, provinces, and municipalities, and sometimes even their component 
parts.15 Add to these the non-state actors discussed above, and it becomes clear that 
complexity is not just on the side of threats and vulnerabilities, but must be on the 
side of responses as well.
Not all of these multinational and transnational relations are equal. The United 
States has different kinds of cooperation with different kinds of allies. We envisage 
the U.S. domestic security environment as a series of concentric circles.16 First is the 
U.S. domestic environment: federal, state, and local governments, with cooperation 
between them in both the public and private sectors. The next layer out includes 
Canada and Mexico. Cooperation with these two states is by necessity more intense 
than with any other states. Some cities and towns straddle borders, and resources 
are shared.
If there is a terrorist attack in the United States, it may affect Canada and Mexico 
as well, and the converse is also true. The United States shares long borders with 
both countries, and relies on Mexican and Canadian officials to help prevent ter-
rorists from gaining access to the continent. There is a long tradition of coopera-
tion in North America, though particularly with Canada, even on security matters. 
NORAD monitored North American airspace through the Cold War, and con-
tinues to do so today. The three countries are also united in cooperation in the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Shortly after 9/11, the United 
States concluded Smart Border Action Plans with Canada and Mexico, specifically 
to address the problem of balancing trade and security.
In 2005 Canadian Prime Minister Martin, President Bush, and Mexican Presi-
dent Fox expanded on the Smart Border agreements to sign the Security and Pros-
perity Partnership, a program envisaging a more comprehensive North American 
security strategy, as well as cooperation on health, the environment, and prosper-
ity.17 Most cooperation among these three countries, however, is transgovernmental 
and informal. Officials in each government maintain close personal contact with 
their counterparts in Canada and Mexico. States and provinces have an extensive 
history of military and police cooperation.

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  75
The next level comprises the United States’ traditional allies, primarily the 
European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Japan. With this group of 
countries, long-established personal relationships grease the wheels of cooperation, 
but geographic noncontiguity means that cooperation on some homeland security 
issues is less intense than with Canada and Mexico. In Europe, the United States 
cooperates bilaterally with individual states, especially the United Kingdom,18 but 
also with the institutions of the European Union. Cooperation with this group of 
states is important because they are all democracies sharing democratic values and 
thus also a common need to balance civil liberties and democratic principles with 
security imperatives. The United States is also more likely to cooperate with these 
like-minded and wealthy states in sharing technology, equipment, and research.
The next concentric circle consists of polities such as Singapore19 and the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE).20 Though not liberal democracies, they have been important 
partners with the United States for years prior to the current campaign against ter-
rorism. Each has a significant history of close cooperation with the United States 
and plays an important role in current U.S. strategic operations, particularly in 
terms of naval operations and port access.
Next we have countries that are important allies of the United States in the 
campaign against extremist elements, but yet are not particularly close on other 
matters. Countries like Pakistan, Malaysia,21 the Philippines,22 and some of the for-
mer Soviet republics in Central Asia,23 among others, fall into this category, though 
some are certainly closer to the United States than others. Aside from allowing the 
United States to use facilities for troops, aircraft, or ships, cooperation in these 
countries might also entail intelligence sharing, military or police training, as well 
as assistance from the United States to these countries to develop their infrastruc-
ture so that terrorists and their weapons do not make it to the United States.
The United States also has agreements with other important partners in the 
campaign against terrorism who share important interests with the United States 
and cooperate with it in stopping terrorism, even though they are neither allies 
nor host to U.S. forces. For example, China and the United States cooperate on 
a number of antiterrorism measures, and in his January 2002 State of the Union 
Address, President Bush mentioned two other important partners: “In this moment 
of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries. America is working with 
Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to achieve peace and 
prosperity.”24 Cooperation with this group of states requires a delicate balance. The 
United States has important trade links with these countries, and attracts immi-
grants and refugees from them, thus reinforcing the need for cooperation on the 
antiterror aspects of homeland security. Relations with these countries are some-
times tense. They may even differ in their understandings of who constitutes terror-
ist groups. For instance, Chinese analysts regularly say that China is also a victim 
of terrorism, citing bombings committed by members of its Uighur population in 
Western China, some of whom would like to see an independent East Turkistan 
there.25 In this case, Chinese and American analysts agree that the East Turkistan 

76  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Independence Movement among the Uighurs has links to al-Qaeda.26 With states 
such as China, the United States is “sharing [counterterrorism] information to an 
unprecedented extent.”27 Yet cooperation with some countries necessarily raises 
questions of morality: how much cooperation is too much? Questions of the bal-
ance between security and morality, like that between liberty and security, occur at 
all levels of cooperation.
Finally, the outermost concentric circle is the rest of the world. Here, the United 
States must engage in public diplomacy, maintaining its image abroad and address-
ing root causes of terrorism.28 In the U.S. National Strategy for Combating Ter-
rorism,29 the Bush administration put forward four fundamental goals, sometimes 
called “the four Ds”: (1) defending U.S. citizens and interests at home and abroad; 
(2) defeating and destroying terrorist organizations; (3) denying sanctuary and sup-
port to terrorist organizations; and (4) diminishing the underlying causes of terror-
ism. Retired General Wayne Downing notes that the United States has had notable 
success at the first two, partial success with the third, but “little, if any progress 
in achieving the fourth goal. In fact, perhaps the opposite has occurred.”30 Rather 
than diminishing the underlying causes of terrorism, the United States now finds 
itself in a situation wherein Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the major international 
training ground for terrorists. A 2006 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) judged 
that al-Qaeda continued to pose the greatest single terrorist threat to the United 
States and its interests abroad, and that the Iraq conflict had become a “cause célè-
bre” for jihadists, inspiring new terrorists and terrorist leaders.31 Downing argues 
that the United States cannot win this “worldwide insurgency” unilaterally, or by 
using the U.S. military as the lead instrument in the long term, but must cooperate 
with other governments and win the war of ideas.32 The U.S. government is slowly 
acknowledging the importance of this task.33 Diminishing the causes of terrorism, 
as the president has suggested by including it in his National Strategy, is something 
the United States must improve upon, for otherwise the American homeland will 
not be secure, no matter how well the United States prepares domestically. Win-
ning this “war of ideas” is fundamentally an international task:
Overall, to incorporate the war of ideas fully into the global counterin-
surgency campaign, the Executive Branch must develop a coordinated 
strategic information strategy prioritizing education and media aimed 
specifically to discredit extremism, preferably using Arab media out-
lets, avoiding overt U.S. sponsorship as appropriate. The United States 
must also develop a sophisticated campaign unique to each country 
and region. Using domestic arguments has not only been unsuccessful 
overseas, in many cases it has further alienated and incensed foreigners, 
especially in third world countries.34

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  77
As was noted in the introductory chapter to this volume, a comprehensive strat-
egy for homeland security must begin at the beginning of the causal chain by 
addressing root causes. This task, like other aspects of a comprehensive homeland 
security strategy, must take into account the networks of international and transna-
tional links described above. Global counterterrorist campaigns must be combined 
with tactics that attempt to make extremist causes less appealing. The Pentagon 
has reportedly started to recognize this imperative in its most recent strategy.35 
Some argue that the Bush administration has made some headway in this regard 
as well by sending under-secretary of state for public diplomacy Karen Hughes 
to the Middle East and other parts of the Muslim world in 2005 to 2006 in an 
attempt to boost American relations with Middle Eastern countries;36 by initiating 
a USAID program whereby Americans train Muslim teachers in Pakistani madras-
sahs (Islamic schools) in science, math, civics, and health care; by creating and 
funding the Al Iraqiya network in Iraq, an organization showing programs such 
as “Terrorism in the Grip of Justice” (an attempt to depict for the Iraqi people the 
dark nature of those who commit terrorist acts);37 and by his efforts at finding a 
two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis in 2008.38
Multinational and Transnational 
Cooperation on Homeland Security
Across the aforementioned concentric circles we currently see cooperation in many 
realms. Here we outline some of the networks of international and transnational 
cooperation existing in the areas of justice, civil security and transportation, intel-
ligence sharing, terrorist financing, and finally, cooperation within the United 
Nations. The examples are not comprehensive, and they should not be taken as an 
indication that the United States is doing all it can to create an effective, interna-
tionally focused homeland policy. In fact, we will outline some of the pathologies 
of cooperation at the end of the chapter.
Judicial and Law Enforcement Cooperation
Cooperation in matters of justice and law enforcement is most intense in the inner-
most concentric circles. It typically takes place at a traditional, state-to-state level 
of diplomacy, often in the context of international law. But, as in other realms, 
developments in homeland security have prompted some new and interesting inter-
national cooperative initiatives involving actors not traditionally concerned with 
issues of foreign policy.
At the most operational level of cooperation, the United States and Canada have 
used Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) composed of immigration, 
law enforcement, and customs officials, often operating from shared facilities, to 

78  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
target cross-border crimes.39 There is a long tradition of this sort of law enforcement 
cooperation on border issues between Canada and the United States. Certainly, the 
renewed attention to border issues after 9/11 has highlighted its importance once 
again, and resulted in the extension of similar programs to Mexico.40
Another effect of the new networked approach to homeland security is that 
such law-enforcement cooperation is not restricted to border issues or contiguous 
territories. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has a counterterrorism 
bureau with liaison officers in major cities around the world, and its Special Intelli-
gence Division has sent NYPD investigators on fact-finding missions to places such 
as Afghanistan and Egypt. Other police departments return the favor: a special 
constable of the Toronto Police Department was dispatched to New York as well.41 
After the terrorist attacks on the London Underground system, NYPD liaison offi-
cers working in London and other cities worked with their home department to 
help shape New York’s antiterror response.42 Such initiatives require a foundation 
of trust and experience, and are thus most often undertaken with the United States’ 
closest allies.
More cooperation across levels occurs between the United States and vari-
ous regional organizations. An American national liaison officer is posted within 
Europol, the European Union Police Office. A December 2002 agreement between 
Europol and the United States to make Europol the first point of contact for 
exchanges of urgent information was the first cooperative agreement between an 
external EU partner and an institution of the European Union.43 Europol opened 
a liaison office in Washington in 2002, and the FBI sent a liaison to Brussels in 
2005.44 Of course, bilateral cooperation between the United States and individual 
European countries continues. The European Union’s permanent network of judi-
cial authorities, Eurojust, and the United States plan to conclude a formal agree-
ment to govern their interactions, while prosecutors from each side have met to 
share information on terrorist cases of mutual interest. Moreover, an initiative exists 
to train American and EU officials on one another’s judicial and law-enforcement 
systems, to better facilitate cooperation and develop strong working relationships.45 
The United States has also signed an “ASEAN-United States of America Joint Dec-
laration for Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism,” wherein the United 
States and countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian States will 
cooperate on matters of intelligence, information sharing on terrorist financing, 
counterterrorism, liaison relations between national law enforcement agencies, 
capacity building through joint training and education and joint operations, as 
well as providing assistance on matters of transportation and border and immigra-
tion control.46 Also, the United States has encouraged greater cooperation against 
terrorism with APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), joining with them in 
forming the Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTTF) in October 2002. In 2005, the 
CTTF developed the Counter-Terrorism Action Plans, which provide a checklist of 
steps taken by APEC economies to fulfill commitments made to the organization’s 
counterterrorism initiatives. APEC has also created the STAR program, Secure 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  79
Trade in the APEC Region, focusing on securing Asia-Pacific trade while protect-
ing regional transportation networks.47
With states in the outer concentric circles, the United States has shared best 
practices and training. There are cooperative programs within the DHS’s Customs 
and Border Protection section working mostly with Central and Eastern European 
and Central Asian countries to exchange personnel. The United States gets access 
to information on trends of what is crossing borders in these countries; and the 
quality of border observation and interdiction in these countries is improved by the 
training their officials receive in the United States. American officials can also learn 
about problems that are more prevalent in those parts of the world than they are 
in the United States, such as human trafficking. Such agreements are possible even 
with countries lacking a cooperative history with the United States, and may help 
set the foundation for yet more intensive antiterrorism cooperation.
Cooperation in Civil Security and Transportation
Civil security includes the protection of critical infrastructure, the networks and 
processes described above that support global trade, government, and civil society 
relations, and ensuring the secure movement of people.48 This is perhaps the realm 
with the most complicated networks of antiterrorism cooperation, encompassing 
local, national, international, and private partnerships.
The example of international cooperation in homeland security that comes most 
readily to mind is cooperation with Canada and Mexico across common borders. 
Indeed, the United States has extensive agreements to ensure the secure movement 
of people and goods across its borders while preserving trade, summarized in the 
Security and Prosperity Partnership discussed above. Among others, the FAST, 
or Free and Secure Trade, program emphasizes a risk-based rather than a transac-
tions-based approach to clearing goods across the border. Companies that regularly 
send freight across the border go through a special certification process that entitles 
them to use express lanes at the border, and there is an increasing focus on clear-
ing freight away from the border at joint facilities. NEXUS at the northern border 
and SENTRI at the southern border streamline processing and entry for frequent 
travelers.49
Thinking about civil security and transportation security in terms of ports of 
entry, or POEs, rather than in terms of border crossings, makes it clear how such 
cooperation extends to the outer concentric circles. Denying terrorists access to 
the United States and preventing dangerous materials from entering U.S. territory 
requires clearing goods as far from the border as possible. The Container Secu-
rity Initiative (CSI) is Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP’s) major initiative 
for securing goods by prescreening, using tamper-resistant containers, targeting 
containers that pose a risk, instead of inspecting every container, as well as using 
automated detection technology.50 The CSI currently operates in nearly forty ports 

80  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. U.S. customs officials are posted in 
ports abroad, while U.S. ports currently host customs officials from Canada, Japan, 
and even China.51 Across the world, passengers can be pre-inspected in at least 
twenty-five airports, effectively pushing the border out from the United States. 
More generally, however, the United States benefits from high global standards on 
passports and travel documents, and works with the International Civil Aviation 
Organization to achieve them.52
Civil security cooperation also manifests itself in public-private partnerships, 
such as the C-TPAT (Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism). Like FAST, 
it is concerned with expediting the passage of precleared goods, but it is more 
specifically focused on the security of the supply chain from start to finish. Such 
programs are advantageous to the government because they transfer some of the 
burden of extra security to private companies by providing incentives to increase 
security. C-TPAT’s emphasis is on self-policing rather than customs inspection. To 
the private company, they are advantageous because government certification of the 
supply chain is an added signal of quality, and because it allows them to ship their 
goods more efficiently. Importers agree to assess their supply chain security based 
on CBP guidelines, and to develop and implement a program to increase supply 
chain security. In return, CBP promises shorter border wait times and fewer inspec-
tions, and streamlined accounting procedures.53 In the private sector, multinational 
firms using globalized trade networks have an interest in developing their own 
strategies for “business recovery preparedness” in the event of a terrorist attack.54 
As more and more commerce occurs between parts of the same company located 
in different countries, is dependent on just-in-time delivery, or has supply chains 
stretching around the globe, such plans are by necessity international. When incen-
tives to improve security exist privately, or, as in the case of C-TPAT can be created, 
part of the burden of creating homeland security is removed from the government’s 
shoulders.
At the inner concentric circles, cooperation may be more transnational than 
international. It will take place between lower levels and branches of government, 
rather than from executive to executive. For cities that straddle the northern or 
southern borders of the United States, public safety and emergency preparedness 
cooperation may entail joint management of shared facilities, and first responders 
may be adept at working together. Border states and provinces often have memo-
randums of understanding, or MOUs, pledging assistance in case of an emergency, 
and have experience doing so in cases of floods, fires, and other natural disasters. 
Increasingly, state and local authorities are seeing the importance of training across 
international boundaries, because a great deal of infrastructure is shared across 
borders. For example, the Pacific Northwest Economic Region, comprising Alaska, 
Alberta, British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Yukon, 
launched a series of table-top exercises focused on “raising awareness of intercon-
nections among the region’s critical infrastructures and resulting vulnerabilities 
associated with largely physical attacks and disruptions.”55 The third exercise in the 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  81
series also focused on potential security problems associated with the Vancouver 
Olympics in 2010. One of the conclusions drawn from a previous exercise was that 
more study and training needed to be undertaken to understand U.S.-Canadian 
cross-border disaster response, and to incorporate the lessons learned into bilateral 
discussions on cooperative activities.56
Exercises and simulations in homeland security are now becoming as much a 
part of multinational security cooperation as joint military exercises have been. 
Some 15,000 local, state, tribal, federal, private, and international participants 
have engaged in full-scale simulations of a multisite, large-scale terrorist attack in 
the United States. In TOPOFF (i.e., top officials) now becoming a semiregular 
exercise, participants from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom 
worked through all levels of response from the local to the international, including 
private and media responses.57 A similar set of exercises, Ardent Sentry, involves 
Northcom, NORAD, the Canada Command, Public Safety and Emergency Pre-
paredness Canada, several federal and state or provincial agencies in the United 
States and Canada, and, at least in 2006, the governments of Arizona, Michigan, 
New Brunswick, and Ontario. Ardent Sentry is designed to test plans for military 
support to civilian authorities in times of crisis.58 As DHS has recognized, even 
chemical and biological attacks in Connecticut and New Jersey require an interna-
tional response, and DHS is practicing for it.59
In a period of increasing globalization cooperation need not be only among 
contiguous states. Cities everywhere in the world face similar problems and already 
come together to discuss common solutions. Cooperation among the world’s larg-
est cities may not always be directly focused on antiterrorism, but many of the 
solutions used to address problems such as sustainable urban development will have 
direct applications in homeland security.60 Imagine an urban space designed with 
antiterrorism in mind, built using lessons in earthquake-resistant building design 
from Tokyo, in safe transportation from Tel Aviv, in emergency response from 
London, in community policing from New York City, and in the integration of 
new immigrants from Toronto. The Secure City was on the agenda as one of the 
major topics of debate for the 2006 World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada, 
truly a network of the global and the local, of international security and human 
security.61
Civil and transportation security in a globalized world is about the security of 
networks. As these networks are international, crossing boundaries between states, 
levels of government, and the public and private sectors, securing them must be a 
multinational and transnational endeavor.
Intelligence Cooperation
Intelligence sharing is one of the most important aspects of homeland security. As 
stated earlier, if al-Qaeda and other transnational terrorist groups plan globally but 

82  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
act locally, it is imperative to have strong intelligence relations with other countries, 
both those who are close allies, and those who are allies only on matters of coun-
terterrorism. Martin Rudner estimates that there are about 100 countries that are a 
part of the intelligence coalition against militant Islamist terrorists, with relations 
of varying intensity.62
The most important set of intelligence relations for the United States is the 
UK-USA alliance. Comprising traditional allies, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, it is now about 60 years old. 
Through this alliance, virtually all signals intelligence, or SIGINT, is shared, along 
with its source, among the UK-USA countries at “Five Eyes” classification. Com-
munications intelligence, or COMINT, is also shared through the Echelon sys-
tem. The UK-USA alliance represents the closest possible intelligence cooperation 
sources, with each of the five members having virtually automatic access to each 
other’s interception facilities without the host nation necessarily knowing what the 
member is looking for.63 While being a member of a global alliance with this sort 
of technical capability probably has disproportionate benefit for its middle power 
members, there are distinct advantages for the United States as well. For instance, 
when the NSA’s computer system crashed for four days in 2000, SIGINT intercep-
tion continued uninterrupted and processing was directed to other parts of the 
Echelon system.64 Moreover, cooperation with these traditional allies affords the 
United States a second opinion on data from a country with a different perspective 
working toward the same goal. Perhaps more important, however, are the benefits 
the United States obtains from comparative advantages derived from functional or 
knowledge expertise, location, or sociocultural similarity. The United States and 
the United Kingdom, for example, work well together because the United States 
has unsurpassed technical capabilities, but the United Kingdom has maintained a 
stronger tradition in HUMINT.65
Intelligence relations at the outer concentric circle are less intense. Informa-
tion may be shared without a source, or a summary of the data or the analysis 
may be passed along. While the United States has strong intelligence relations with 
the European Union, using EUROPOL as a single point of contact,66 intelligence 
relations with partners at the outer concentric circles are more typically bilateral 
and concentrate on specific issues. The United States cooperates with countries 
such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Syria, and Pakistan on counterterrorism efforts, 
working together on joint investigations, interrogations, analysis, and threat assess-
ment.67 Such relations are useful because of the cultural and geographic affinity 
these countries have to the militant Islamist groups the United States is trying to 
penetrate. Such cooperation may reduce some of the pressure on the United States 
to rebuild its human intelligence capabilities, which former CIA director George 
Tenet believes may take years.68

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  83
Financial Cooperation
International financial cooperation is also vital to securing the U.S. homeland. The 
U.S. government has already passed domestic laws and signed international agree-
ments and regimes that facilitate financial cooperation on fighting international ter-
rorism. Its primary domestic move has been the September 2001 National Money 
Laundering Strategy, revised in 2002 and very comprehensive and international in 
its scope.69 One of the six major goals of the strategy is to strengthen international 
anti-money-laundering regimes. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has an 
Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence playing an important role here. An 
important recent example of the Department of the Treasury’s invoking such mea-
sures was the 2005 to 2007 U.S. sanctions against North Korean financial interests 
centered on Macau, China’s Banco Delta Asia, because of the bank’s reputed role 
in facilitating North Korean money-laundering and counterfeiting activity.70 The 
sanctions involved close cooperation with China and other nations, proved to be 
very effective, and were resolved in June 2007 as a part of the agreement reached 
between North Korea and the five other members of the Six Party Talks on North 
Korea’s nuclear programs.
The United States has also been engaged in international financial coopera-
tion, such as the G7’s and subsequently G8’s Financial Action Task Force. Since its 
inception in 1989 this group has played an instrumental role in coordinating the 
world’s policies on fighting and closing down terrorist money-making and money-
laundering operations.72 International financial organizations such as the Asian 
Development Bank, in cooperation with APEC, have established a Cooperation 
Fund for Regional Trade and Financial Security Initiative, designed to help facili-
tate counterterrorism-related capacity building in the Asia-Pacific, to fight money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and also to help improve seaport and air-
port security in the region as well. The UN, too, has an International Convention 
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism with similar aims, as well as the 
Security Council’s Sanctions Committee against Taliban and al-Qaeda operatives. 
All of these measures are vital for a secure U.S. homeland, and U.S. cooperation 
on such initiatives should be deepened and expanded with time, as politics and 
technologies permit and circumstances necessitate.
Homeland Defense Cooperation
What Americans today call homeland defense is the more traditional domain of 
territorial defense. Because the United States shares land borders with close allies, 
territorial defense usually falls into the hands of the Air Force and the Coast Guard. 
After 9/11, the United States reorganized its commands to include North America 
in Northern Command, an entity working closely with NORAD, or North Ameri-
can Aerospace Defense.

84  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Since the early Cold War, NORAD has monitored and protected North Ameri-
can skies. Integration through NORAD is so complete that, at any time, either an 
American or a Canadian could be in charge of North America’s aerospace defense 
at its headquarters outside Colorado Springs, Colorado. In fact, on September 11, 
2001, it was a Canadian, Lt. General Eric Findley, who was the commanding officer 
at NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain complex that day. The remarkable effectiveness 
of this partnership has led to proposals to extend it to land and sea cooperation; 
in 2002, a binational planning group was established to investigate extending 
NORAD.71 In 2006, when NORAD came up for renewal, it was extended per-
manently, subject to review every four years, or at the request of either country. A 
maritime warning mission was also added.72 This is a substantial revision of the pre-
mier North American security treaty, one that marks the importance of homeland 
defense in security cooperation.
The other significant domain for cooperation is the United States’ coastlines. In 
this domain, cooperation extends beyond the U.S. coastlines to all of the concen-
tric circles. The U.S. Coast Guard’s mandate for protecting the United States’ ter-
ritorial borders means enhancing transparency to detect, deter, and defeat threats 
away from American interests and enabling accurate and dynamic decision mak-
ing, as well as maintaining the freedom of navigation and the efficient flow of 
commerce.73 As with border security, the antiterror elements (as well as the counter-
terror elements) of homeland security in effect get pushed out from the coasts. One 
such “pushing out” initiative is in the Pacific, with the Regional Maritime Security 
Initiative, “a partnership of willing nations to enhance capabilities and leverage 
capacities through unity of effort to identify, monitor, and intercept transnational 
maritime threats consistent with existing international and domestic laws.”74 Secure 
waterways in the Asia-Pacific are essential to securing the flow of goods, but also 
securing the United States from the entry of WMD or other threats. Thus, even 
the most traditional realm of territorial defense is affected by the structural impera-
tives of globalization and terrorism, and requires multinational cooperation. In this 
realm as in others, however, cooperation with allies is not always smooth. In Octo-
ber 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard was forced to suspend live-ammunition drills after 
protests from the Canadian government, pending the renegotiation of the Rush-
Bagot Treaty, prohibiting the use of warships with cannons on the Great Lakes.75
Cooperation through the United Nations
The United Nations has taken terrorism seriously, within the limits placed upon it 
by the UN Charter and the member states, and it is in the interest of the United 
States to help the UN in its stand against terrorism, and work with the UN as much 
as possible in both counter- and antiterrorism. The UN has twelve universal instru-
ments or conventions related to terrorism, nine regional instruments, four declara-
tions, and since September 11, 2001, there have been twenty-one Security Council 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  85
Resolutions concerning terrorism and the suppression and prevention thereof.76 
Some of the more important UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions dealing 
with terrorism are as follows:
UNSC Resolution 1368, passed the day after the September 11, 2001, ter-
rorist attacks, which stressed that states have a right to self-defense under the 
UN Charter and urges all nations to work together to bring the perpetrators 
of the attacks to justice.
UNSC Resolution 1373 says all states should take strong antiterrorism mea-
sures, including ratifying all twelve antiterrorism conventions and taking 
specific measures against the financing of terrorism. It also established the 
Counter-Terrorism Committee.
UNSC Resolution 1526 supports the work of the UN sanctions regime 
against al-Qaeda.
In fact, UN Resolution 1368 was seen as giving the United States a green light 
to invade Afghanistan after diplomatic moves had failed, given the connection 
between al-Qaeda and September 11 on the one hand, and the Taliban’s known 
policy of harboring members of al-Qaeda on the other. Moreover, UNSC Reso-
lution 1441, the resolution the U.S. government cited as giving legitimacy to its 
invasion of Iraq in 2003, held that Iraq could face serious consequences if it did not 
cooperate with UN arms inspectors. The United States argued that it was carrying 
out enforcement actions under UNSC 1441.
The UN is also one means whereby nations coordinate and carry out the block-
ing of terrorism financing. The UN has established an International Convention 
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, requiring states to criminalize 
under domestic law the funding of terrorist activities and to search out, seize, and 
freeze funds slated for use for terrorist purposes. This includes the requirement to 
extradite or prosecute persons involved with the financing of terrorism and to coop-
erate with other entities in investigation and prosecution of such suspects. Lastly, 
states must require their financial institutions to take measures that stop funds from 
being used for terrorist activities. The Security Council’s Sanctions Committee also 
has such functions as they pertain to those identified as Taliban and al-Qaeda 
operatives. It is very difficult for the United States or any single nation to organize 
such a coordinated effort to cut off financing to extremist individuals and groups, 
but it is something the UN can do through its good offices and member states, and 
this has the effect of keeping the United States more secure in the long run.
There are a number of additional reasons why the United States should coop-
erate through the United Nations. First, even considering the right of any nation 
to self-defense, American action abroad will be considered more legitimate and is 
often more effective with the support and sanction of the United Nations. When 
the United States sought support from the UN for its invasion of Iraq in 2002 and 
2003, it was this legitimacy and support that U.S. policymakers sought. They did 
n
n
n

86  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
not ultimately achieve this objective, and this cost the United States in terms of 
international public opinion. Had they received the support of the Security Coun-
cil and its members, potential financial and military support might have been more 
forthcoming.
Second, the UN has an important “naming and shaming” function. If a coun-
try is condemned by the international community via a UN Security Council 
Resolution, the General Assembly, the Counter-Terrorism Committee, or any of 
a number of UN bodies, the weight of international opinion can be very heavy 
indeed. For years South Africa bore the brunt of UN criticism and it could be 
argued that the pressure did bear fruit, with the eventual success of sanctions and 
the end of apartheid. More recently, the United Nations came together in unity for 
two Security Council resolutions naming and shaming North Korea for its long 
range missile and nuclear weapons tests and development, as well as endorsing lim-
ited sanctions against North Korea. Diplomatic and military pressure on states that 
sponsor terrorism or proliferate WMD will be more effective, and more legitimate, 
coming from a group than from a single state, especially when that group includes 
the target state’s peers.
Third, the UN has established a Counter-Terrorism Committee, or CTC as a 
part of UN Security Council Resolution 1373, all of which requires UN member 
states to ensure that terrorist groups do not receive funds, haven, or support of any 
kind from member states. The CTC requires all UN member states to sign the 
twelve UN antiterror conventions and monitors their progress in this and other 
anti- and counterterror measures, including the requirement that states report reg-
ularly as to their progress. The UN also has a sanctions committee attached to the 
UN Security Council which keeps a running list of known Taliban and al-Qaeda 
operatives, and which requires countries to freeze assets of such persons if found in 
their countries, as well as apprehending them if possible. In terms of international 
accountability, the sanctions committee and the CTC can act in ways that the 
United States itself cannot, or at least cannot do legitimately in the eyes of other 
member states.
In addition, the UN has important information-sharing capabilities and serves 
as a forum to discuss terrorism and other matters. The UN is a convenient place 
for officials from various countries to meet and exchange information, particularly 
if the countries in question are not on good terms. For example, the United States 
does not have formal diplomatic relations with North Korea, but North Korea has a 
mission to the UN and so U.S. officials have taken advantage of this to meet quietly 
with North Korean officials from time to time in New York.77
Areas for Improvement
At first glance, the United States seems to have a remarkable record of international 
cooperation on homeland security. Indeed, the United States has initiated coopera-

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  87
tive endeavors either bilaterally, multinationally, transnationally, or in cooperation 
with private companies in many sectors. But in order to sustain an effective and effi-
cient antiterrorism strategy in cooperation with its partners to bolster the security of 
its homeland, the United States must ensure that there are incentives for other states 
to invest in common initiatives. Despite progress in some areas, five problems plague 
U.S. policies, ultimately making cooperation more difficult in the long run.
	
1.	Disguised unilateralism. Some policies couched as multilateral are, in fact, 
unilateral. For example, the Container Security Initiative is a U.S. policy that 
other countries must comply with in order to gain access to U.S. markets. 
Although such a measure may be good for U.S. security, and may spur inter-
national changes, allies and partners may resent being coerced into action. 
Thus, policies should be developed in consultation with allies and within 
multinational institutions, rather than implemented unilaterally, wherever 
feasible.
	
2.	Insufficient reciprocity. In a similar vein, the preponderance of U.S. power 
means that it can solicit cooperation from its allies without offering much in 
return. Again, however, the United States should use its power judiciously, 
especially with its strongest allies. The United States must offer incentives for 
cooperation that are perceived by its partners as being attractive and fair, or 
it will eventually become more difficult to reach beneficial agreements with 
them. For instance, although intelligence sharing within the UK-USA group 
is open and extensive, the United States does not always share sources with 
its other traditional European allies. This reduces the ability of European 
policymakers to make independent judgments about the data that is shared, 
and leads many Europeans to feel that the relations are one sided.
	
3.	Negative externalities. If one of the interests of the United States in its home-
land security is maintaining a moral stance consistent with its traditional 
values, the United States must pursue such a policy in its international agree-
ments. We discussed the moral dilemmas inherent in cooperation with states 
with questionable human rights records or different views of what counts as a 
terrorist group. These moral quandaries and negative externalities are present, 
however, even at the inner concentric circles. The revelation that the United 
States has used the practice of rendition, undoubtedly with at least the partial 
knowledge of its allies, to hold enemy combatants in secret prisons without 
adhering to the Geneva Conventions, led to outrage among the citizens of the 
countries involved, as well as in the United States. The broader issue of torture 
against detainees has become a political liability for the U.S. government, 
and an issue where counterterrorism policy may affect the ability to gain 
allies for homeland security policy. Despite an Executive Order of July, 2007 
prohibiting “cruel and unusual punishment” and torture against detainees, 
the treatment of what the government calls “unlawful enemy combatants” 
remains controversial because it continues to maintain that such enemy pris-

88  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
oners captured in the course of the war on terrorism are not covered by the 
Geneva Conventions. Such counterproductive policies damage the reputa-
tion of the United States abroad and make both counterterrorism and anti-
terrorism strategy more difficult. Besides being in the United States’ strategic 
interests, multinational and transnational cooperation on homeland security 
is also in the legal and moral interests of the United States. By deepening and 
expanding its cooperation with other nations for the security of U.S. territory, 
the United States will be in a better position to help further develop interna-
tional legal norms, as well as help generate compliance.78 Since the Second 
World War, the United States has been an important guarantor of the eco-
nomic and legal system that has evolved internationally. If the United States 
is seen as shirking its responsibilities, or worse, if its actions or words are seen 
as undermining this international economic and legal system, potential chaos 
could ensue if other nations decide they can do the same. Similarly, moral 
interests can also accrue strategic benefits when they bring about greater U.S. 
legitimacy in the eyes of others, greater trust by others in the United States 
and its policies, and ultimately higher levels of cooperation towards securing 
vital U.S. interests. Trust, legitimacy, deference, and cooperation are far more 
likely when an actor acts morally and is perceived by other actors to be doing 
so. When the United States does not act in accordance with its traditional 
domestic morals and values and the international treaties to which it is a sig-
natory, it could create an election year backlash for policymakers at home, or 
a backlash abroad, as was the case with the U.S. treatment of prisoners at the 
Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
	
4.	Insensitivity to allies’ values and/or interests. When seeking international coop-
eration, the United States must endeavor to be cognizant of and sensitive 
to the ways in which its allies’ interests and values may be different from its 
own. For example, data protection remains a controversial issue between the 
United States and its allies in the European Union, with airlines caught in 
the middle. The EU has stricter privacy laws than the United States does, 
and the EU and the United States have had some difficulty coming to agree-
ment on the sharing of passenger name records, namely the lists collected 
by airlines to allow security checks to be conducted in advance on travelers. 
After multiple delays, a final agreement reached in mid-2007 reduced the 
number of data points to be shared, but allows the United States to keep the 
data for a longer period of time. Similarly, Canadian trust in American good 
faith was damaged in the wake of the inquiry into the case of Maher Arar, 
a Canadian of Syrian origin who was deported to Syria and tortured for ten 
months, despite a lack of evidence that he was involved in terrorist activities. 
Canadians were outraged, and this was made worse when the U.S. ambas-
sador both refused to cooperate with the Canadian parliament’s commis-
sion of inquiry and declared that the United States had no regrets about the 
case.79 The U.S. government refused to review the case in the United States, 

Multinational and Transnational Cooperation Strategies   n  89
and Arar remained on terrorist watch lists. The idea of multilateralism usu-
ally emphasizes a somewhat thicker definition of multinational cooperation, 
emphasizing content, not simply form. Rather, multilateral cooperation is 
built around common principles developed independently of the interests of 
an individual party or the strategic demands of a specific event.80 While pur-
suing a multilateral strategy in antiterror homeland security measures may 
not always be possible or efficient for the United States, it should remain the 
ideal to strive for. Multilateralism remains the best way of promoting general-
ized, reciprocated cooperation with countries who share American values.
	
5.	Inefficient cooperation. The networked model of antiterrorism cooperation 
described may result in inefficient cooperation because of duplication, gaps 
in cooperation, or one actor not knowing what another is doing. For instance, 
intelligence cooperation and evidence sharing at the level of police depart-
ments could duplicate or undermine state-level cooperation. We have previ-
ously recommended implementing the principle of centralized control, and 
decentralized execution as a way of increasing the efficiency or effectiveness of 
domestic homeland security policy.81 The same principle can be applied inter-
nationally, by combining high-level political attention to a problem, enabling 
effective overall coordination, with bureaucratic and technical cooperation at 
lower levels of government.82 For example, while twin cities at the borders or 
police departments in cities around the world should be encouraged to under-
take independent cooperative measures, some degree of centralized coordina-
tion and guidance at the federal government level is desirable to ensure that 
duplication and dysfunctionality are avoided and synergies of cooperation are 
captured for the United States more generally.
Concluding Comments
A unilateral strategy for homeland security makes little more sense in ensuring 
security in a flat, globalized world today than autarky does in ensuring economic 
development. Because of globalization and the “flattening” of the world, an inter-
national focus must permeate all aspects of the strategy. Securing borders is impor-
tant but insufficient, and securing processes and networks is impossible without 
multinational and transnational cooperation.
If terrorism becomes nonviable and unattractive as a means toward political 
ends, the United States will be more secure, and it is for this reason that tradi-
tionally “outside-focused” U.S. foreign policy is so important to its traditionally 
“inside-focused” homeland security in the post-9/11 world. Although it certainly 
must use its hard power against forces that threaten it,83 Joseph Nye and others 
have argued persuasively that the United States has not used its soft power very 
effectively in the wake of 9/11.84 In fact, it has gone from a position of having an 
immense outpouring of sympathy in the days following 9/11 to a position wherein 

90  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
today many abhor U.S. policy, often because of ill will over the intervention in Iraq 
and the perception that, in Thucydidean fashion, the strong (Americans) do what 
they can and the weak (everyone else) accept what they must. Yet Americans have 
both the hard and soft power to do much to shape people’s perceptions in other 
directions.
The United States has been perceived by too much of the rest of the world as 
more of a bulldozer than a seed planter in terms of paving a way forward in its 
relations with other members of the international community and in its relations 
with the Muslim world in particular, while it seeks to deepen its sense of security 
in the U.S. homeland.85 The precedents Americans set for international law and 
norms in the present security environment will have very important implications 
for U.S. interests of all kinds in the future as it regards international law, norms, 
conventions, and treaties. The Chinese, the Russians, and others observe American 
actions and are quick to point out American inconsistencies in domestic security 
laws or in its policies toward Iraq, toward the WTO, and elsewhere. By cooperat-
ing with neighbors, allies, and partners on antiterrorism as well as counterterror-
ism, Americans must show the world once again that they are team players. We are 
convinced that in the process U.S. territory will become more secure.
A homeland security strategy for the United States seeks to prevent terrorist 
attacks, limit damage from them, and coordinate an effective response, where an 
effective response is the first step in preventing the next attack. This volume argues 
that homeland security must be planned strategically and that strategy must be 
comprehensive. To be comprehensive and effective, it must include multinational 
and transnational elements. U.S. interests make a transnational homeland security 
strategy a strategic preference, and globalization makes it a structural imperative. 
As we have shown, existing cooperation in the fields of justice and law enforcement, 
civil security, intelligence sharing, financial cooperation, homeland defense, and 
cooperation in the United Nations already defy traditional notions of what inter-
national cooperation in securing the U.S. homeland has looked like. Multinational 
and transnational cooperation on homeland security has been paid little attention 
by policymakers and scholars, and working out a solution for the extant and poten-
tial pathologies of such cooperation requires particular attention. Strategic and cre-
ative thinking about theory and policy are urgently required. This will happen only 
when we recognize the importance and utility of multinational and transnational 
cooperation and assure that such cooperation permeates all aspects of the United 
States’ homeland security strategy.

WMD Terrorism
New Threats, Revised 
Responses
Jeffrey A. Larsen and James J. Wirtz
The authors begin with a brief history of terrorism, 
the modern variants of which they describe as occur-
ring in four waves. Their principal concern, however, 
is potential access by terrorist groups to weapons of 
mass destruction, which they discuss in detail. Deny-
ing terrorists access to nuclear or other weapons-grade 
materials is the aim. Approaches under consideration 
include expanding the existing Nunn-Lugar coopera-
tive threat reduction programs with Russia; signing the 
Fissile Materials Cutoff Treaty, and developing a plan for 
ensuring that no new states develop fissile materials—
including Iran and North Korea; and eliminating surplus 
Cold War nuclear weaponry—encouraging Russia to do 
the same.
The worst potential WMD problem is nuclear terrorism, because it 
combines the unparalleled destructive power of nuclear weapons with

the apocalyptic motivations of terrorists against which deterrence, let 
alone dissuasion or diplomacy, is likely to be ineffective.
Ashton Carter1
By the end of the last century, the threat of mass casualty terrorism had begun 
to edge its way onto the agendas of defense and law-enforcement agencies. The 
arrival of the millennium, and the worldwide celebrations that would accompany 
it, had taken on sinister connotations for many officials. There was a concern that 
cults, disgruntled individuals, or terrorist organizations might view the dawn of a 
new century as a signal to take violent action to help prompt the coming of some 
long awaited utopia. The air was filled with apprehension as many officials believed 
that the multitudes gathered at various New Year’s celebrations might prove to be 
tempting targets for individuals or organizations bent on violence. The fact that 
enormous crowds of revelers could be wiped out by a weapon of mass destruction 
(WMD), a chemical, biological, nuclear, or radiological device, was not lost upon 
officials. When the millennium passed quietly, a collective sigh of relief could be 
heard in police and defense ministries around the world.
Evidence exists, however, that terrorists did intend to launch attacks to coincide 
with the millennium. In December 1999, police in Jordan rounded up an al-Qaeda 
terrorist cell that was about to strike. Seventy-one drums of “acids” were uncovered 
in their weapons cache. Closer to home, Ahmed Ressam, who has been linked to 
al-Qaeda, was arrested on December 19, 1999 while entering Port Angeles, Wash-
ington from Canada. Alert border patrol agents discovered high explosives hidden 
in the trunk of his car. Months later, intelligence analysts determined that Res-
sam had intended to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on New Year’s Day 
2000.2
The fact that these al-Qaeda operatives were thwarted and that they were pri-
marily armed with high explosives sharpened the debate about the likelihood of 
mass casualty terrorism, especially involving weapons of mass destruction. Some 
argued that terrorists would shy away from attacks that produced massive death, 
injury, and destruction. Agreeing with Brian Jenkins’s famous observation that ter-
rorists wanted people watching, not dead, they pointed out that it would be difficult 
to harness an attack that produced thousands of casualties to achieve some political 
objective.3 Such a heinous act would unite potential supporters, opponents, and 
fence sitters against the terrorists, dooming not only their organization, but also 
their political goals. They also noted that even though terrorists had come to pos-
sess WMDs, such weapons required demanding technical skills and operational 
savvy if they were to be used to produce large amounts of death and destruction. 
The Aum Shinrikyo cult, for example, possessed substantial economic and technical 
resources, yet it failed to use sarin to its optimal effect when it placed the chemical 
agent on Tokyo subway cars in March 1995.4 Although they injured 6,000 people 
in the attack, cult members only managed to kill eleven individuals—a death toll 

WMD Terrorism  n  103
that can easily be exceeded using conventional weapons. For example, more than 
fifty people died when al-Qaeda sympathizers, using high explosives, attacked the 
London Underground and bus system in July 2005.5 Skeptics agreed that mass 
casualty terrorism involving chemical, biological, nuclear, or radiological weapons 
was possible, but they asserted that the threat was greatly exaggerated.
By contrast, others focused on the consequences of a terrorist attack involving 
weapons of mass destruction and how such an attack might change the course of 
history. They agreed that terrorists generally did not resort to mass casualty terror-
ism, that it was difficult to use such an event to achieve political objectives, and 
that significant technical and operational hurdles made it difficult to obtain and 
employ chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological weapons. But they also noted 
that just because an activity had not yet occurred was not a compelling reason to 
believe that it would not occur in the future. In the minds of these Cassandras, the 
consequences were too significant not to take seriously the possibility that terrorists 
might employ WMD.
The September 11, 2001 al-Qaeda suicide attacks on the United States ended 
the debate about the likelihood of mass casualty terrorism. And the 2004 Madrid 
train bombings, the Bali tourist bombings in 2002 and 2005, the 2003 bombing of 
the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, the 2005 London Underground and Amman hotel 
bombings, and the George W. Bush administration’s revelations about foiled ter-
rorist plots continue to highlight al-Qaeda’s interest in launching terrorist attacks 
intended to produce as many casualties as possible.6 If they somehow managed 
to acquire them, would al-Qaeda operatives use chemical, biological, radiological, 
or nuclear weapons in a terrorist attack? Or does the threat of terrorism involving 
WMD represent a barrier that will not be crossed in the future? What interna-
tional actions can government officials take to prevent or deter the use of WMD 
by terrorists?
To address these questions, this chapter briefly describes the evolution of mod-
ern terrorism, exploring how the motivations and targets of terrorists have changed 
over time. The second section describes the characteristics of chemical, biological, 
nuclear, and radiological weapons, which are often referred to as WMD because 
of their potential to cause enormous numbers of casualties or horrendous physical 
destruction. The third section explores the problem of domestic WMD terrorism 
from an international perspective by placing the issue within the context of cur-
rent U.S. national security documents and policies, including the National Secu-
rity Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, and the Nuclear Posture 
Review.
This chapter offers a unique perspective on the WMD terrorist threat by explor-
ing the interaction between foreign and defense policy—counterproliferation, 
counterforce, preemptive and preventive war, arms control, supplier agreements, 
export controls, general nonproliferation policy, and new international surveillance 
agreements, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative—and the domestic threat 
of terrorism involving nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological weapons.

The Changing Threat of Modern Terrorism
Although various types of violence have permeated societies throughout history, 
most scholars link the emergence of modern terrorism, and modern warfare for that 
matter, to the French Revolution. The Revolution demonstrated that what aver-
age people thought and believed mattered, and that war was no longer simply the 
sport of kings, noblemen, or mercenaries. Indeed, this “first generation warfare,” 
a term popularized by Bill Lind and G. I. Wilson, saw many developments that 
remain the basis of today’s armies and contemporary combined arms operations: 
an increasingly professional officer corps, volunteers for military service, industrial 
production, and national zeal.7 It also saw the use of violence to manipulate elite 
and public opinion. The Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre and his 
followers, used the guillotine in a Reign of Terror (1793–1794) to gain control of 
the public bodies of the French Republic. When Robespierre forewarned several of 
his colleagues that they would soon lose their heads too, members of the Commit-
tee became concerned about their own safety and killed him first. But the Reign 
of Terror allowed 22 people to hold a nation of 27 million hostage, killing at least 
40,000 of their countrymen in the process. At its inception, terrorism emerged as 
the weapon of the weak, used to instill fear in the hearts of a public audience to 
achieve a political objective.8 It was violence directed as a matter of political strat-
egy against innocent persons.9
The First Wave
David Rapoport, one of the world’s foremost authorities on political violence, 
divides the evolution of modern terrorism into four waves that roughly correspond 
to broad generational change and to the major political issues of their day.10 The first 
wave of terrorism emerged near the end of the nineteenth century when rebel and 
revolutionary movements embraced sensational violence to attack local regimes. 
The Narodnaya Volya (People’s Will) movement in Russia, for instance, deliberately 
violated social and legal norms by targeting civilians in an effort to prompt a gov-
ernment overreaction, which in their view would provoke a revolutionary outburst. 
Soon various terrorist movements, following in the wake of economic, political, 
educational, and social advances in Russia and Central Europe, emerged in various 
countries. Terrorists armed with handguns or dynamite targeted elected officials 
or royal families to advance the cause of political reform, nationalism, or various 
ideological movements, such as communism and anarchy. This first wave ended 
with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, an act that precipi-
tated the outbreak of the First World War. Gavrilo Princip, the Serbian nationalist 
who pulled the trigger that day, set off a chain reaction that ultimately led to the 
deaths of millions of people. The death and destruction that swept Europe set sev-
eral countries back decades in terms of demographics or economic development, 

WMD Terrorism  n  105
illustrating an important fact about terrorism: its effects often are unforeseen and 
unintended. Nevertheless, the fact that spectacular acts of terrorism can unleash 
uncontrollable social, political, and military forces has seemed to encourage those 
who want to use mayhem to achieve their objectives.
The Second Wave
The second wave of terror, prompted by the forces of decolonization, emerged in 
the aftermath of World War II. Instead of targeting senior officials and govern-
ment luminaries, these nationalists targeted the instruments of colonial control, 
such as local officials, police, and military outposts, to confront colonists with the 
possibility that by occupying some distant land they would be forced to endure 
never-ending casualties. Terrorist cells were formed in cities and attacks were car-
ried out against prominent urban targets, although these attacks were not neces-
sarily directed at civilians. Second-wave terrorists sometimes provided warning of 
their attacks to minimize casualties, but mistakes occurred. For example, the Irgun 
bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in July 1946 knocked out the center 
of British mandatory rule in Palestine but also killed 91 people, a death toll that 
undermined Irgun’s credibility among friend and foe alike. The crest of the second 
wave, however, occurred in Southeast Asia. “People’s war,” a strategy whereby ter-
rorism is used to rid the countryside of a government’s presence, was put to good 
use by the North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong allies during the Vietnam War to 
drive the U.S.-supported regime in Saigon from power.11 The first stage of people’s 
war involved the use of violence against government officials and supporters to 
demonstrate to the local population that the colonial power was on the wrong side 
of history. By reducing the government presence in the countryside, the Viet Cong 
placed themselves in a position where they were able to communicate their own 
political program to the peasantry. In theory, the Vietnamese version of people’s 
war also ended in a burst of revolutionary terrorism, the so-called general offensive-
general uprising, a spontaneous revolt against the government.12 The second wave 
produced its own lesson: terrorism can be integrated into a complex political-mili-
tary strategy that over time might wear down and defeat even the strongest military 
power. Terrorism was not just the weapon of the weak, it was an effective weapon 
of the weak.
The Vietnamese success against the United States spurred other organizations 
to use terrorism as a political instrument, although few groups described themselves 
as terrorists because the term had taken on a pejorative connotation by the 1960s. 
Many of these organizations, such as the Weather Underground in the United 
States, the Italian Red Brigades, or the German Red Army Faction, saw themselves 
as the vanguard for socialist revolution, a view that was welcomed by Soviet officials 
who looked for every available opportunity to cause trouble for the West.

106  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The Third Wave
The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) came to exemplify third-wave terror-
ism that was inspired by the Viet Cong’s struggle against overwhelming odds. Left 
alone in its fight to regain lost lands following Israel’s defeat of the Arabs in the 
1967 Six Day War, the PLO’s operations had virtually all of the hallmarks of today’s 
Islamic fundamentalists who use terror to advance their cause. Because they lacked 
access to their own territory, the Palestinians had to create operating and training 
facilities in countries sympathetic to their plight. They also attacked targets outside 
the Middle East. Palestinian terrorists struck the Munich Olympics in 1972 and 
kidnapped OPEC ministers in Vienna in 1975. Because they primarily sought to 
draw attention to their cause, the PLO and other third-wave groups adopted hostage 
taking and airplane hijackings as preferred tactics. Third-wave terrorists, however, 
had to strike a delicate balance. Too little violence would fail to draw attention to 
their cause, while too much violence would cause a backlash of international out-
rage as people turned against the perpetrators of what appeared to be senseless acts 
of violence. Still, there was a gradual escalation in terms of death and destruction 
produced by terrorism. Tens of people died in the worst terrorist incidents in the 
1970s, while hundreds would die in the worst incidents in the 1980s and 1990s.13 
Observers also came to several conclusions about third-wave terrorism. These ter-
rorists appeared to be rational, in the sense they used violence in a calculated way 
to achieve political objectives. Additionally, terrorists seemed to stick with tried and 
true operations. Innovation was rare because terrorists often strove to minimize risks 
in what were inherently demanding operations.14
The Fourth Wave
The lessons drawn from the third wave became conventional wisdom as a new 
generation of fourth-wave terrorists emerged in the aftermath of the Soviet defeat 
in Afghanistan and the triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran at the end of the 
1970s. Although the Iranian Hostage Crisis demonstrated that Americans were 
vulnerable to this new type of Islamic terrorism, U.S. policymakers tried to harness 
the religious forces that motivated Islamic militants in the Cold War by supporting 
their battle against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda emerged from the rem-
nants of the mujaheddin forces, especially foreign volunteers, once allied with the 
United States. Returning from the brutal struggle in Afghanistan, these individuals 
found it impossible to reintegrate into what they believed were amoral and corrupt 
societies. Wandering around the Islamic world, they began to gravitate towards 
Osama bin Laden, a rich Saudi financier who had built a reputation as a logistics 
and construction expert during the war in Afghanistan. Bin Laden’s motivations 
and rhetoric have evolved over the course of a decade of terrorist activity, but his 
initial ire seems to have been directed towards what he believed was a hypocritical 

WMD Terrorism  n  107
Wahabi regime in Saudi Arabia and its strongest backer, the United States gov-
ernment. The U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, made 
necessary by the requirement to maintain sanctions against Baghdad following the 
first Gulf War, only fueled bin Laden’s animosity towards the Saudi royal family 
and the United States.
Al-Qaeda and other jihadists launched a war against the United States in the 
1990s. After the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, the Central Intel-
ligence Agency collected information on bin Laden. For its part, the U.S. military 
strengthened security at its facilities in the Persian Gulf region following the attacks 
on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. By 1998, bin Laden had held press confer-
ences calling for attacks against American interests and issued a fatwa justifying his 
actions. In August 1998, al-Qaeda attacked U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and 
Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. In 2000, after a failed attempt to attack the USS The 
Sullivans, bin Laden’s operatives launched a suicide attack against the USS Cole, 
inflicting fifty casualties on the crew and nearly sinking the vessel. Bin Laden was 
quite vocal about his ambitions, which were repeated in a riveting article published 
by Foreign Affairs.15
Since the French Revolution, terrorism has changed its stripes to reflect the 
outstanding political and social grievances of the day as seen from the viewpoint of 
the weak. Its targets have been political elites and royalty, government outposts, the 
international news media, and most recently, the citizens of opposing governments 
and societies. It seems to be shaped and encouraged by the example of previously 
triumphant movements, especially campaigns that ultimately proved successful 
against powerful states. Terrorism also had been distinctly secular and localized 
until third-wave movements incorporated Islamic fundamentalism into the mix, 
and the PLO was forced by circumstances to conduct international operations. 
Over the last several decades, terrorism has become increasingly lethal as transna-
tional organizations use international communication and transportation networks 
to wreak death and destruction across the globe.
WMD Terrorism
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center 
and Pentagon, analysts have devoted considerable effort to assessing al-Qaeda’s abil-
ity to use chemical, biological, nuclear, or radiological weapons. On the one hand, 
the international response to Islamic terrorism has hampered al-Qaeda’s ability to 
launch attacks, and networks and cells have been disrupted. Al-Qaeda operations 
in Iraq also resemble third-wave terrorist attacks in the sense that they are directed 
at the ability of the U.S.-supported regime in Baghdad to exercise control over the 
country and to establish democratic institutions. On the other hand, dispassionate 
assessments of the likelihood that al-Qaeda might launch a terrorist attack using 
WMD are not reassuring. Lewis Dunn, for instance, notes that al-Qaeda opera-

108  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
tives have attempted to acquire chemical and possibly nuclear weapons and that 
plots have been uncovered involving ricin, cyanide, and radiological weapons.16 
Nevertheless, Dunn also concludes that al-Qaeda has come to rely on explosives as 
its primary terrorist weapon and the use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weap-
ons would entail significant technological and operational challenges that would 
require innovation, a course of action that is extraordinarily risky from the terror-
ists’ perspective. He notes, however, that Western officials must act as if al-Qaeda 
will use WMD if they somehow manage to acquire them, but that policymak-
ers should not abandon efforts to deter al-Qaeda’s use of WMD. The effectiveness 
of deterrence, or related efforts to create self-deterrence in the minds of al-Qaeda 
leaders by highlighting how WMD use will hurt their cause, cannot be ruled out. 
Audrey Kurth Cronin has reached a similar conclusion that terrorists probably pre-
fer conventional weapons, but that WMD use cannot be ruled out because “terror-
ism seeks to shock.”17
Nonetheless, it is the assessment of most analysts, and the U.S. government, 
that WMD might become increasingly available to terrorists. As a result, the 
threats emanating from both state and nonstate actors could increase. Chemical 
and biological weapons are particularly easy to produce by skilled laboratory per-
sonnel with a minimum of necessary materials or advanced equipment. This is not 
a hypothetical threat: coalition forces in Afghanistan uncovered trace amounts of 
ricin and anthrax at several locations. Evidence captured along with Khalid Shaikh 
Mohammed in March 2003 also suggests that al-Qaeda was planning an ambitious 
effort to manufacture anthrax.18 The Japanese group Aum Shinrikyo released sarin 
gas on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 and attempted to aerosolize anthrax in a 
Tokyo neighborhood earlier that year. Attempts were undertaken to release cyanide 
in the London subways in 2002, and to use ricin in 2003, but British police foiled 
both plots. Other reports claim that Jordan stopped a plan by al-Qaeda to release a 
chemical agent in Amman in 2004. A person or group still at large conducted a ter-
ror campaign in the United States in 2001, placing powdered anthrax in envelopes 
and mailing it to key American figures. And the arrest of an al-Qaeda agent in the 
United States in 2002 broke up a plot to acquire and use a radiological dispersal 
device (RDD), commonly referred to as a “dirty bomb.”19 Terrorists are dabbling 
with WMD, although no group has yet employed them with maximum effect.
Nuclear Weapons
Nuclear weapons are extremely difficult to produce because their manufacture 
requires a large industrial infrastructure. Building a nuclear weapon might be 
within the realm of possibility, however, if a group was able to get its hands on 
fissile material such as highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium. The physics 
and engineering of nuclear weapons are well understood; the challenge lies in cre-
ating or obtaining the fissile material. By contrast, an RDD would be much easier 

WMD Terrorism  n  109
to build. An RDD is a conventional bomb wrapped in radioactive material; when 
detonated, radioactive material is spread by the blast. Unlike the HEU or pluto-
nium needed to make a nuclear weapon, low-level radioactive materials can be used 
in an RDD, and as Fred Wehling and Jeremy Tamsett note in their chapter, these 
materials are plentiful in modern societies because they have a myriad of industrial 
and medical uses in everyday life.
Most observers are not too concerned that terrorist networks will actually build 
a nuclear weapon. Instead, they worry that terrorists might find a way to procure 
a weapon through theft or purchase. Nuclear weapons may emerge on the black 
market, for instance, if they are stolen from the large remaining stocks of Rus-
sian nonstrategic nuclear weapons, or from the growing numbers of warheads in 
the Pakistani and Indian arsenals. Informal, entrepreneurial networks have already 
emerged in the realm of nuclear technology, materials, and know-how. In 2004, 
revelations that the Pakistani scientist A. Q. Khan probably provided information 
about gas-centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade uranium and nuclear bomb 
designs to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria, a revelation that shocked 
the nonproliferation community.20 Iran, a designated state sponsor of terrorism, is 
actively pursuing an indigenous nuclear weapons program. Many observers worry 
that the Iranian nuclear industry might become a clandestine source of fissile mate-
rial for terrorists.
Biological Weapons
Biological weapons include bacteria, toxins, and viruses. Modern genetic engineer-
ing has already been used by Soviet and Russian scientists to modify naturally 
occurring diseases by increasing their virulence, resistance to antibiotics, or per-
sistence on the battlefield and to improve their suitability as biological warfare 
agents.21 Over a dozen states already possess biological agents. Because they can 
be manufactured in even run-of-the-mill medical laboratories and would produce 
a great psychological and political impact, many observers believe that biological 
agents will eventually be used by terrorists. An effort to use biological weapons 
to inflict mass casualties, however, would have to overcome several technical and 
operational barriers. Outbreak of a deadly epidemic would probably hit hardest 
among populations lacking state-of-the-art public health programs and medical 
facilities; as a result, terrorists might actually inflict relatively few casualties among 
targeted populations while killing thousands among their own supporters. Dispers-
ing a biological agent so that it actually causes infection is not an easy task; an agent 
can be rendered harmless by household disinfectants or even sunlight. The fact that 
disease outbreaks are commonplace might reduce the psychological impact of a 
biological weapons attack, especially in parts of the world where reports of illness 
are unlikely to generate flashy international news coverage. A biological attack may 

110  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
not initially look any different than a flu outbreak, and as a result may not be of use 
to a terrorist group.
Chemical Weapons
Chemical weapons fall into several categories, depending on the manner in which 
they cause physical effects: choking, blister, blood, and nerve agents. In addition, 
there are reports of laboratories moving to develop so-called fourth-generation 
nerve agents with greater lethality and persistence. At least twenty-five states have 
chemical weapons or agents, and every advanced state has a large supply of toxic 
industrial chemicals that could be diverted to terrorist use. Terrorists also might 
sabotage chemical plants with deadly consequences. The 1984 industrial accident 
at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, for example, killed thousands of 
people exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC), which acted as a choking agent. At 
Bhopal, the MIC wafted as a poisonous cloud from the chemical plant, but chem-
ical weapons can be delivered from aircraft, commercially available sprayers, or 
even household containers. For example, Aum Shinrikyo simply punched holes in 
plastic bags full of sarin and left them in the Tokyo subway. Chemical weapons, 
however, are less likely to cause large numbers of casualties than nuclear weapons 
or biological agents because dangerous amounts of chemical agent actually have to 
come into contact with individuals to produce injury or death. Large quantities of 
chemical agent, dispersed in a measured way, also are required to be effective on the 
battlefield or in a terrorist attack, making this type of weapon hard to move, easy 
to spot and interdict, and relatively easy to defend against with proper protective 
clothing.
Chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological weapons would provide terror-
ists with different capabilities and pose different operational challenges. Simple 
chemical weapons are relatively easy to procure, for example, but relatively large 
quantities of agent, dispersed in the right quantity over the targeted area, are 
needed to produce mass casualties. By contrast, nuclear weapons pose fewer chal-
lenges in terms of use, but they are extremely difficult to manufacture or procure 
on the black market. Terrorists also have an operational code and history that leads 
them to prefer certain types of weapons over others. Aum Shinrikyo experimented 
with biological agents, but chemical weapons were incorporated as part of its belief 
structure. Al-Qaeda has attempted to launch attacks using lethal chemical or non-
contagious biological agents, but it has not yet used a radiological dispersal device 
or contagious biological agent, weapons it could probably acquire. Al-Qaeda has 
shown a preference for weapons that blow up in dramatic fashion, thereby garner-
ing the attention of the world media. This implies that bin Laden may be unwill-
ing to launch a chemical or biological attack. The jury is out on whether al-Qaeda 
would immediately use a nuclear weapon, should it get its hands on one, or save it

for some other future political purpose, such as blackmail, deterrence, or to shore 
up an Islamic Caliphate.22
U.S. Responses to the Threat from WMD Terrorism
U.S. foreign and defense policy has slowly responded to the threat posed by terror-
ism and the emerging possibility that terrorists might try to acquire and employ 
WMD. The old and new threats posed by terrorism and U.S. strategies in response 
to these threats are summarized in Figure 6.1.
America’s awareness of the need for greater capabilities to counter WMD threats 
was raised during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when U.S. military forces were not 
properly prepared to counter the Iraqi chemical, biological, or nuclear threat, a dan-
ger that turned out to be more significant than anticipated. As a result, the Clinton 
administration launched the counterproliferation initiative, a DoD-centered pro-
gram to identify and rectify known shortfalls in the nation’s ability to meet and 
defeat WMD threats around the globe. The Clinton administration was primarily 
concerned with meeting the WMD threat on some future battlefield, although the 
possibility that terrorists might attempt to acquire and use these weapons was also 
beginning to influence defense planners in the 1990s.
The Clinton administration focused on reducing and countering WMD threats 
by launching several types of programs that addressed different aspects of the pro-
liferation threat, something they hoped would have an impact on both state and 
nonstate actors. Nonproliferation and arms control were designed to prevent or 
roll back WMD programs. Cooperative threat reduction was an attempt to gain 
physical control, accounting, and security for the obsolete stockpile of Soviet Cold 
War weapons. Deterrence would deny the political-military aims of an adversary 
-

following WMD use against U.S. forces, allies, or interests. If deterrence failed, 
passive defenses would allow the United States to sustain operations in a WMD 
environment, and counterforce capabilities would attempt to destroy an adversary’s 
WMD before it could be used. National and theater missile defenses would defend 
U.S. and allied forces and populations from ballistic missiles that might be armed 
with WMD. The Clinton initiatives expanded the capability of the U.S. military to 
operate on a WMD battlefield, increased U.S. force protection capabilities against 
terrorists, and improved the ability of U.S. forces to retaliate following a chemical 
or biological attack.
In addition, in 1995 the Clinton administration released Presidential Decision 
Directive (PDD) 39, characterizing terrorism as a national security concern as well 
as a matter for law enforcement. It described four main program areas for deal-
ing with the threat of terrorism: reducing vulnerabilities, deterrence, response, and 
preventing terrorists from acquiring WMD.23 This change in perspective regarding 
terrorism was further codified in May 1998 with PDD 62 and the creation of a 
“Small Group” within the National Security Council whose mandate was to focus 
on the terrorism threat.24
Responses to Fourth-Wave Terrorism
The fourth wave of terrorism redirected efforts away from the battlefield and toward 
homeland security and the interdiction of potential terrorist supply networks. The 
Bush administration arrived in early 2001 with a mandate that led them to develop 
national security policies that reflected both continuity and change from the Clin-
ton administration’s programs. Continuity was found in its comprehensive strategy 
that mirrored the preceding administration’s policies. These included counterpro-
liferation efforts to deter and defend against a threat before it was unleashed, and 
the requirement to integrate counterproliferation in military transformation and 
homeland defense. It also included strengthened nonproliferation efforts, includ-
ing increased emphasis on coalition interdiction, such as the Proliferation Secu-
rity Initiative, rather than universal, formal initiatives outlawing the possession of 
or trade in contraband weapons or agents. Continuity was also evidenced by the 
administration’s decision to keep counterterrorism expertise within the National 
Security Council that President Clinton had set up with PDD 62. In the aftermath 
of the September 11 attacks, the administration also created the Department of 
Homeland Security, charged with focusing U.S. domestic efforts on preventing and 
coping with the consequences of a homeland WMD incident.
The shift in Bush administration policies reflected official beliefs that the threat 
had changed. WMD was now seen as a weapon of choice for an adversary, rather 
than a weapon of last resort. This meant that deterrence also had to change to 
reflect the new reality, and a new paradigm of preemptive measures and preventive 
war was required in order to block nuclear terrorism. These changes can best be 

WMD Terrorism  n  113
understood in three categories: the global war on terrorism, homeland security, and 
counterproliferation.25
The global war on terrorism, as enunciated by President George W. Bush in his 
January 2002 State of the Union address, is a U.S.-led effort to seek and destroy 
terrorist groups while simultaneously addressing the root causes of terrorism. It 
includes a much-increased effort to gather timely intelligence, disrupt terrorist 
operations, block financial flows to terrorists, deter states from supporting ter-
rorists, eliminate safe havens for terrorists, and destroy terrorist networks. In this 
way it blocks nuclear terrorism by eliminating the demand for WMD through the 
elimination of the groups themselves.
The new emphasis on homeland security is an attempt to use active and passive 
defenses to prevent and, if necessary, mitigate the consequences of a WMD attack 
on the United States. Its measures include cooperative international law enforce-
ment and intelligence sharing, domestic customs and border security, federal, state, 
and local law enforcement, the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, the Chemical 
and Biological Incident Response Force, incident management, and response and 
recovery. The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Northern Command 
share responsibility for various aspects of these programs.
The third major thrust for blocking terrorist WMD use is found in the more 
aggressive U.S. policies of counterproliferation and cooperative threat reduction. 
This includes such aspects as smuggling interdiction, finding stable jobs for former 
Soviet nuclear scientists, and when necessary, active nonproliferation through the 
use of offensive military force.
The area of emphasis by the Bush administration that raised the greatest pub-
lic and international concern is that of preemption and preventive war, although 
it is difficult to characterize the global war on terror as a preventive war because 
al-Qaeda and its allies clearly landed the opening blows.26 According to this pol-
icy, when diplomacy and deterrence fail, military action may be required to effect 
regime change in a country that poses an imminent WMD threat and cannot be 
deterred. This policy refers primarily to rogue state regimes, but there were obvious 
implications for terrorist groups, as well. America’s willingness to remove the Tal-
iban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq sent strong signals to the rest of 
the world that actors with WMD would not be tolerated. Libya, for example, may 
have heeded that message, giving up its WMD programs and opening its borders 
to international inspectors in December 2003.
Interdiction is another measure that has been emphasized by the Bush admin-
istration. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a U.S.-led effort to interdict 
the transfer of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and related 
materials to or from states of proliferation concern. An international body was 
created in September 2003 to enforce the PSI. Over 70 states now support PSI 
and its statement of interdiction principles, applying laws already on the books in 
cooperative and innovative ways. This group has since conducted several successful 
interceptions of WMD or precursor materials and delivery means on the high seas. 

114  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
PSI is not a traditional treaty; it is a partnership of like-minded countries acting 
proactively to enforce national and international laws and deter, disrupt, and pre-
vent state-sponsored WMD and missile proliferation and to interdict clandestine 
trade by entrepreneurs in materials and equipment related to WMD.
In addition to PSI’s efforts on the demand side, there are several multinational 
organizations that work to establish and enforce supply side controls on the prolif-
eration of nuclear, chemical, or missile technology, materials, and knowledge. These 
include the Wassenaar Arrangement (a 33-nation group providing export con-
trols on conventional munitions and dual-use goods and technologies), the IAEA 
Nuclear Supplier’s Group (an informal group of 39 states that seeks to control the 
export of nuclear-related materials and technologies), and the Australia Group (a 
32-nation group organized to monitor and control the trade in sensitive materials 
and technologies useful in the development of chemical and biological weapons). 
These groups do not necessarily work in concert, but they have overlapping mem-
berships, and serve as an effective corollary to the demand-side groups that deal 
directly with the proliferant states, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency 
and its nuclear safeguards programs and ad hoc United Nations committees, such 
as the UN Special Commission on Iraq.27 The United States has taken the lead in 
designating entities and persons engaging in proliferation activities and support, 
just as it has in tracking and identifying sources of terrorist financing. In June 2005 
President Bush signed an Executive Order authorizing the government to freeze 
assets involved in WMD proliferation.28
One of the largest international efforts to date has been the G-8 Global Partner-
ship Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. In 2002 
the United States and its global partners committed up to $20 billion ($10 billion 
from the United States, and $10 billion in matching funds from the other seven 
members) dedicated to responding to the WMD threat. In addition, there are a 
number of U.S.-initiated programs dealing not only with Russia and the former 
Soviet states, but other nations of concern around the world. Examples of these 
programs include the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to reduce and secure fis-
sile materials worldwide; the Second Line of Defense and Megaports programs to 
install radiation monitors at major seaports, airports, and border crossings; and 
“redirection” programs in Libya and Iraq to provide alternative employment for 
former weapons scientists and engineers.29
America’s counterforce capabilities have been significantly upgraded in recent 
years and tested on the battlefields of Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. At the same 
time, the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review called for changes to U.S. nuclear forces and 
policy to make those weapons more relevant to modern threats, thereby enhancing 
their deterrent capabilities. The new U.S. military strategy, highlighted in the 2001 
Quadrennial Defense Review and reiterated in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, 
emphasized a fourfold approach to dealing with threats to U.S. security: assurance, 
dissuasion, deterrence, and defeat. These concepts have been further enshrined in 
the 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States, the 2002 National Strat-

WMD Terrorism  n  115
egy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, the 2003 National Strategy to Com-
bat Terrorism, and the 2004 National Military Strategy.
The National Strategy to Combat WMD united for the first time all the ele-
ments of national power, including diplomacy, intelligence, law enforcement, and 
the military, into one document reflecting a coherent strategy. It emphasizes the 
three pillars of U.S. efforts to deal with adversaries armed with WMD: counter-
proliferation, nonproliferation, and consequence management. Building on those 
concepts, the national strategy identified four cross-cutting functions that will 
prove critical to combating WMD: improved intelligence collection and analy-
sis, research and development, bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and tailored 
strategies against hostile states and terrorists.30
Dealing with the Threat By Denying Access to Materials
Graham Allison, a leading expert on WMD proliferation, proposes a simple yet 
challenging solution to the problem of dealing with WMD terrorism. He focuses 
on the two types of WMD that have the greatest destructive capability: nuclear 
and biological weapons. Although in his mind a terrorist group cannot be deterred 
from using these weapons once they get them, he is equally convinced that prevent-
ing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon is simple: control the earth’s stockpiles 
of fissile material and terrorists will not be able to construct or acquire a nuclear 
weapon. Because these materials do not occur in nature, and have only been cre-
ated by a handful of states, all that is required is to develop a program to ensure 
that nuclear proliferation, and hence nuclear terrorism, is stopped at the source. 
As Senator John Kerry put it during the 2004 presidential election campaign, “No 
material. No bombs. No nuclear terrorism.”31
Allison’s three steps to achieve this objective are, first, to ensure that all govern-
ments securely lock up all their enriched uranium and plutonium so it cannot be 
seized, sold, or diverted to a terrorist. Second, all states must commit to a policy 
that precludes the production of any new fissile material. And third, states must be 
willing to destroy excess stocks of such materials whenever they can.32
The United States can make supporting these three goals a core objective of its 
national security strategy. This would include expanding the existing Nunn-Lugar 
cooperative threat reduction programs that already exist, with varying levels of 
success, with Russia; signing the Fissile Materials Cutoff Treaty and developing a 
plan for ensuring that no new states develop fissile materials—including Iran and 
North Korea; and eliminating surplus Cold War nuclear weaponry and encourag-
ing Russia to do the same.
As for a biological attack, Allison suggests that a rigorous public health response 
capability, coupled with advance stockpiling of key medications and selective 
immunizations, could minimize the chances of a biological attack becoming an 
epidemic.33

116  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Concluding Comments
Terrorism has evolved over time, reflecting the ideologies, organizational prefer-
ences, and technological sophistication of those who attempt to kill the innocent 
to achieve their political objectives. This evolution is not necessarily linear, but 
fourth-generation terrorists do seem unusually interested in generating mass casu-
alty events. Future attacks could thus involve WMD, with levels of casualties and 
destruction heretofore never seen within the United States. But it is not a foregone 
conclusion that terrorists will want to use these weapons; there are good reasons to 
believe that a WMD incident could prove highly counterproductive from their per-
spective. As terrorists have already discovered, technical and operational challenges 
also have to be overcome if WMD is to be used to its fullest effect.
The evolution of U.S. counterproliferation and counterterror policy reflects the 
changing threat posed by WMD. The Clinton administration, largely responding 
to the discovery that Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq possessed a significant chem-
ical weapons capability and advanced biological and nuclear weapons programs, 
focused on the proliferation of WMD to state actors and its potential use on the 
battlefield. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Cen-
ter and the Pentagon, the Bush administration redirected U.S. counterproliferation 
and nonproliferation programs to target clandestine traffic in WMD and to prevent 
these weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists. The threat of WMD ter-
rorism has been identified and the Bush administration’s response to this challenge 
to date appears pragmatic and reasonable. But in the aftermath of a future terrorist 
attack using WMD, their efforts will not look so reasonable, and people will justifi-
ably ask the damning question, “Why didn’t we do more to prevent this?”
A successful end to the global war on terror will require long-term international 
and national commitments. It will undoubtedly last a generation, during which 
time more attacks on the U.S. homeland may occur. Dealing with this potential 
threat therefore requires new ways of thinking, and new ways of coordinated inter-
action between national agencies and between states in the international system. As 
Wehling and Tamsett note in their chapter, prevention and response strategies also 
need to be better integrated to reduce the threat posed by nuclear and radiological 
weapons. Current policies are beginning to secure old stockpiles of WMD, but a 
long-term commitment will be needed to monitor clandestine terrorist networks 
to make sure that they cannot acquire or use chemical, biological, radiological, or 
nuclear weapons.

Chapter 7
Nuclear and 
Radioactive Threats to 
Homeland Security
Prevention and Response
Fred L. Wehling and Jeremy Tamsett
The authors focus on the nuclear and radiological 
threat posed by terrorist groups. After a review of the 
ways and means by which these groups could acquire 
and use such devastating weaponry, they consider how, 
among other factors, intelligence, port security, and the 
role of the Department of Homeland Security and other 
agencies fit into a strategic plan for dealing with this 
real-and-present threat. Given this analysis, they offer 
ten priorities for a national homeland security strategy. 
Wehling and Tamsett underscore that leadership at the 
political level as well as the formation of long-term col-
laborative relationships between working-level officials 
across institutional boundaries will be especially crucial 
for integrating prevention with response.

120  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The resemblance of the collapse of the World Trade Center to the mushroom cloud 
of a nuclear explosion buttressed the burgeoning perception1 that WMD could 
become a weapon of choice for terrorists. This new concern contributed to the 
creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS, along with 
other federal agencies, has spent billions of dollars to prevent and respond to the use 
of nuclear weapons or radioactive materials by terrorists, and nuclear and radiologi-
cal incidents figure prominently in the National Response Plan (NRP). Do these 
efforts represent an adequate response to the nature and magnitude of nuclear and 
radioactive threats? Is a comprehensive strategy in place, or are there gaps that 
must be addressed? Our answer to these questions is that, although preparations 
for responding to nuclear and radiological emergencies are well underway, current 
efforts at preventing these incidents have significant deficiencies. With regard to 
radiological attacks, which in general represent high-probability, low-consequence 
events, this situation may be tenable, though action is still required in some areas. 
However, further action to prevent low-probability, high-consequence nuclear 
events is urgently needed.
This chapter begins its analysis of the current state of strategies for countering 
nuclear and radioactive terrorism by briefly characterizing the nature and severity 
of nuclear and radiological threats. A review of strategy and capabilities for meeting 
these threats then highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches 
to the problem. We then use this review to recommend a “top 10” list of priorities 
for preventing and defending against nuclear and radioactive terror attacks. The 
potentially catastrophic consequences of a nuclear attack lead us to put urgently 
needed steps for preventing nuclear terrorism at the top of the list, but upgrading 
of capabilities to assess and mitigate radiological hazards should also receive high 
priority. The objective throughout is not to criticize current policies, leadership, or 
organizations, but to suggest how formulating a comprehensive strategy and imple-
menting a well-considered set of priorities can improve the U.S. national capacity 
for protection against the well-publicized but still misunderstood threats of nuclear 
and radiological attack.
Characterizing Nuclear and Radioactive Threats
Possible motivations for terrorist groups to attack with nuclear or radioactive weap-
ons, and potential pathways for acquiring and using these weapons, have been 
extensively described in open literature.2 Our objective here is to clearly delineate 
the similarities and differences between these threats in order to show that although 
approaches for responding to both may be very similar, effective strategies for pre-
vention must be radically different.
Terrorist attacks with nuclear weapons are the epitome of a low-probability, high 
consequence threat. While there is widespread agreement that the probability of a 
terrorist organization successfully acquiring and using a nuclear weapon to attack 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  121
U.S. territory is very low, the devastating impact of such an attack is the very defi-
nition of mass destruction. Al-Qaeda heads the list of terrorist organizations with 
motivations to use nuclear weapons not only because of its history of mass-casualty 
attacks and stated intentions to carry out more such strikes, but also because of 
reported attempts to purchase nuclear weapons from the former Soviet states and 
the capture of a diagram of a crude nuclear explosive from al-Qaeda affiliates in 
Afghanistan.3 The simplicity of the captured diagram betrayed a lack of technical 
capability at the time it was prepared, but also emphasizes that a fairly unsophisti-
cated improvised nuclear device (IND) constructed with highly enriched uranium 
(HEU) could produce a kiloton-range nuclear explosive yield.4
The explosive power of an IND could approach that of the nuclear weapons 
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and would have similarly destructive effects, 
including fatalities measured in the tens or hundreds of thousands if detonated in 
a densely populated area, and widespread radioactive contamination. An actual 
nuclear warhead would have even greater power to cause mass destruction.5 Nuclear 
terrorism would therefore appeal only to terrorists desirous of causing appalling loss 
of human life, unconcerned about indiscriminate civilian casualties, and untroubled 
by large-scale environmental damage.
Obtaining and detonating a military nuclear weapon, most of which are protected 
by security devices such as Permissive Action Links (PALs) and/or require specific saf-
ing, arming, fusing, and firing procedures (SAFF), would present formidable chal-
lenges to even the most capable, highly motivated, and generously funded terrorist 
groups. While very unlikely, this possibility cannot be completely ruled out because 
serious concerns exist about the security of some nuclear weapons in the arsenals of 
Russia (particularly tactical weapons), Pakistan, and other countries. The possibility 
for terrorists to build and explode an IND must be considered much greater. For a 
major terrorist organization, such as the larger members of the al-Qaeda network, 
the only significant barrier to the construction and use of an IND is the acquisition 
of enough fissile material such as highly enriched uranium or, possibly, plutonium. 
Unfortunately, in many places around the world, this barrier is not high enough. An 
estimated total of 600 tons of highly enriched uranium was either in use or in storage 
in Russia alone in 2004 (not counting the material inside nuclear weapons), only 26 
percent of which has been protected by comprehensive security upgrades installed 
through U.S.-Russian cooperative programs.6 The U.S. Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) reported in 2004 that 20 kg or more of HEU were used at 128 civilian 
research reactors in 40 countries,7 many of which have “no more security than a night 
watchman and a chain-link fence.”8 About 50 kg of HEU (enriched to 90% 235U or 
greater) would be sufficient for an IND.9 If a terrorist organization could somehow 
obtain enough fissile material, the level of resources and effort required to assemble an 
IND and detonate it in a U.S. city would be much less than what was needed to carry 
out the attacks of September 11, 2001.10 Preventing terrorists from gaining access to 
HEU and plutonium useable in nuclear explosives is thus the highest priority and 
most effective means for combating nuclear terrorism.

122  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
In sharp contrast to the instant massive destruction of a nuclear attack, terror-
ist attacks with radiological agents could occur on a small scale, and might have 
effects so subtle that they would not be detected for months or years after the 
incident. There are three basic modes for terrorist attack using radioactive material 
(substances emitting ionizing radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, 
and gamma rays).11 The simplest is the use of a radiation emission device (RED) 
to expose persons, or even a single individual, to ionizing radiation from a point 
source. An example would be the emplacement of a cobalt-60 pellet in a washroom 
in an office building. An individual entering the area for only a short time might 
be unlikely to receive a harmful dose of radiation, but people who frequent the area 
could, over time, receive harmful or even fatal doses.12 In this mode of attack, casu-
alties might not be noticed, or attributed to radiation exposure, until years after the 
incident, when they might appear as a mysterious cancer cluster. At this point, the 
terrorists could plausibly claim responsibility for the attack.
A second mode of radiological attack involves the use of a radiological dispersal 
device (RDD) or “dirty bomb.” RDDs use explosives to disperse a radiological 
agent over a wide area. Depending on the amount and type of radiological agent 
used, an RDD could contaminate a large area with radioactive material, cause 
casualties through external exposure or inhalation or ingestion of radioactive mate-
rial, and induce psychological casualties through fear and panic.13 Radioactive con-
tamination could also require evacuation and decontamination of the affected area, 
likely leading to both short- and long-term economic damage. While the biological 
effects of an RDD detonation could take days, weeks, or even years to appear, the 
psychological impact would be immediate. The third mode of radiological terror-
ism, an attack on a nuclear power plant or other facility to breach containment and 
release radioactive material, would have similar effects, with the additional impact 
of damage or closure of the facility and, potentially, the economic and psychologi-
cal shock of a major blackout.14
The wide range of modes and effects of radiological terrorism make these forms 
of attack potentially useful to a wide variety of groups and organizations. Terror-
ists could calibrate the physical and biological effects of an attack to suit their tac-
tical and political objectives by using more or less radioactive material or causing 
exposure over a wide or a carefully defined target. Although radioactive materials 
are widely used in medicine, industry, research, and many other applications, only 
a small fraction of the millions of radioactive sources in commercial use pose seri-
ous risks for use in radiological terrorism due to their portability, dispersability, 
and high levels of radioactivity. Nevertheless, these high-risk isotopes (including 
americium-241, californium-252, cesium-137, cobalt-60, iridium-192, plutonium-
238, and strontium-90) can be found in hospitals, laboratories, and industrial 
facilities in any major city, or could be smuggled into the United States with little 
difficulty.15 Moreover, an unknown number of “orphan sources” have dropped out 
of regulatory control, unaccounted for or disposed of improperly. The wide avail-
ability of radioactive materials and ease of using radiological agents in terrorist 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  123
attacks makes prevention of radiological attack extremely difficult. However, the 
ability of first responders and public health workers to detect radiological agents, 
recognize and treat injuries from radiation exposure, and decontaminate affected 
areas when provided with adequate training, equipment, and support allow devel-
opment of a menu of options for both short- and long-term responses to radiologi-
cal attack.16
Both prevention and response play important roles in meeting the threat of 
nuclear and radiological terrorism. However, the relative scarcity of the special 
materials and expertise needed to perpetrate a nuclear attack makes prevention the 
key to combating nuclear terrorism. Conversely, the wide availability and ease of 
use of radiological agents points to response as the cornerstone of the fight against 
radiological terrorism. While one prominent scholar17 has called nuclear terror-
ism “the ultimate preventable catastrophe,” radiological terrorism appears neither 
catastrophic nor preventable. As we will see, current U.S. strategy for homeland 
security does not always reflect these priorities.
Current National Prevention and Response Strategies
It has become increasingly evident in the post-September 11 environment that reli-
ance on deterrence alone to forestall threats to U.S. homeland security from non-
state actors is problematic at best. The formulation and implementation of robust 
antiterrorism measures, which are nonmilitary ways of countering or dissuading 
terrorism, play a key role in helping to prevent and respond to nuclear and radiolog-
ical terrorism. Examples of current antiterrorism measures include increased pro-
tection of global nuclear power facilities and efforts to secure radiological materials 
potentially available to terrorists. However, antiterrorism measures can also encom-
pass lesser known methods, such as increasing investments in advanced radiation 
detection systems, public education campaigns about the dangers posed by radia-
tion and, concurrently, effective public risk communication, as well as improved 
crisis and consequence management techniques.
An RDD or IND could be detonated in virtually any location, and among 
the likely targets are large population centers where the element of surprise would 
increase the lethality of such an attack. Coordination among local, state or regional, 
and national agencies responsible for disaster response is critical for treating casual-
ties, containing and controlling the area of destruction, and limiting the spread of 
radioactive contamination. For this reason, any homeland security strategy should 
be national, and not just federal, in nature.18 This means that the federal govern-
ment must empower states and local authorities to establish a sense of ownership 
as stakeholders in the formulation and implementation of policy as it relates to 
prevention, preparedness for, and response to a terrorist incident involving radioac-
tive weapons.

124  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Intelligence
The intelligence component of a national strategy to counter the threats posed by 
nuclear and radiological terrorism requires international cooperation. The timely 
exchange of important information, along with the occasional pooling of sensi-
tive resources, can be used to thwart or disrupt potential terrorist activity. Many 
formal and informal agreements are in place between various members of the U.S. 
intelligence community (IC) and the security services of foreign governments. For 
example, the intelligence services of several European countries, including France, 
Britain, and Germany, work closely with the U.S. IC to ensure that relevant data 
is disseminated and back channels of communication are open and functioning 
properly.
On the domestic front, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
of 2004 created not only the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), 
but also the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).19 The NCTC draws upon 
the analytical capabilities of the preexisting, multi-agency Terrorist Threat Integra-
tion Center (TTIC), and seeks to expand its ability to assimilate and disseminate 
information to decision makers in a timely manner.
Other agencies are also enhancing their intelligence-gathering capabilities. For 
example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) bolstered its counterterrorism 
efforts through the creation of an intelligence analysis unit in 2005. DHS cre-
ated the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) in 2005, with an operating 
budget for 2006 more than double the amount spent on nuclear and radiation 
detection and prevention in 2005.20 The DNDO had an operating budget of $500 
million dollars in FY2007, a $163.6 million increase in funding over FY2006.21 
The purpose of the DNDO is to coordinate and build intelligence-sharing linkages 
between local, state, and federal agencies to better coordinate efforts in prevent-
ing and responding to nuclear or radiological emergencies. DHS has also created 
an Office of Intelligence and Analysis headed by an assistant secretary of home-
land security and a chief intelligence officer who report directly to the secretary. 
This office is intended to be a clearing-house for intelligence collected by other 
government agencies related to homeland security. Once the office has analyzed 
the intelligence, it is tasked with disseminating that intelligence to local and state 
jurisdictions for further action. It remains to be seen, however, how sensitive infor-
mation will be shared effectively with individuals at the state level who lack security 
clearances.22
Port Security
Detection of nuclear materials before they are placed on ships at their point of origin 
is crucial to the implementation of a strategy to prevent nuclear terrorism. A bet-
ter tactic is to secure nuclear materials abroad and prevent shipments from leaving 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  125
their respective home ports with deadly cargo than it is to deal with them once 
they have reached U.S. shores. Programs like the Megaports Initiative, overseen 
by the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Container Security Initiative (CSI), 
administered by DHS, are both designed to improve the screening and inspec-
tion of cargo for nuclear and radioactive materials at foreign ports before entering 
the United States. These programs have resulted in improved information sharing 
between U.S. and foreign customs operations.
There are three obstacles that must be overcome if international cooperation is 
to be improved and the goal of installing radiation detection devices at the world’s 
largest twenty ports by 2010 is to become a reality.23 For example, while it currently 
takes only around five seconds to screen trucks carrying containers unloaded from 
ships at the Port of Los Angeles, if radioactive materials are detected, more time 
is needed for a more thorough inspection to identify the source and determine 
the legitimacy of its presence and intended use.24 Consequently, port authorities 
around the world are hesitant to sign agreements with DOE to place detectors at 
their ports because of concerns about a potential slowdown in commerce. Never-
theless, if containers are not scanned for dangerous cargo at their point of origin, it 
may be too late once the containers arrive in the United States. The problem is that 
containers are not individually scanned as they are unloaded off the ships; rather, 
the containers may sit at their destination in a U.S. port for hours or days before 
they are loaded onto the trucks and driven through the radiation portals. This sim-
ply ensures that a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb would not be able to leave the port, 
posing a serious problem if the intended target is the port itself.
The second challenge present in the detection of radiation is the ability of the 
personnel at the scene to know what types of materials at what levels pose a haz-
ard and, hence, warrant further investigation and possibly a threat. Finally, if the 
United States installs radiation detection monitors at all official border crossings 
and at all foreign and domestic commercial ports, it is possible that all this will do 
is deter terrorists from bringing radioactive materials through commercial ports or 
official border crossings, but will not prevent them from crossing into the United 
States through unmonitored access routes or from using smaller watercraft to arrive 
on U.S. shores at noncommercial ports.
DHS Role in Preparedness and Response
The secretary of homeland security has budgetary authority over homeland security 
appropriations. Under the rubric of “threat, vulnerability, and consequence,” DHS 
allocates fiduciary resources to local and state governments based on conclusions 
drawn in threat and risk assessments. Essentially, by linking threats with conse-
quences, DHS prioritizes where money and training should be used to enhance the 
effectiveness of implementing national preparedness priorities. These priorities are 

126  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
outlined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security, and have been further 
iterated in the December 2004 National Response Plan (NRP).25
The National Response Plan (NRP) was created in December 2004 by Home-
land Security Presidential Directive 8 (HSDP-8). It called for a single document to 
provide guidance for an all-hazards approach to disaster preparedness, response, 
and prevention.26 The NRP incorporates and supersedes five preexisting plans; the 
FRP, National Contingency Plan (NCP), Interagency Domestic Terrorism Con-
cept of Operations Plan (CONPLAN), and the Federal Radiological Emergency 
Response Plan (FRERP).27 The NRP places an emphasis on planning, preparedness, 
and response at the local and state levels through the application of the National 
Incident Management System (NIMS), created by Homeland Security Presidential 
Directive 5 in February 2003.28 The director of operations coordination is tasked 
with consolidating the efforts of the interagency process to conduct joint operations 
as well as coordinate and manage activities related to incident management.
The Office of Grants and Training (G&T) is the nexus of preparedness at DHS 
and is responsible for providing funding, training, and guidance to state and local 
authorities in the effort to help them prepare for, and respond to, terrorist incidents, 
including WMD disasters in accordance with the NRP.29 G&T, formerly the Office 
for Domestic Preparedness (ODP), is headed by an assistant secretary who reports 
to the DHS undersecretary for preparedness, Directorate for Preparedness.30 Under 
the auspices of HSPD-8, the Office of Grants & Training has awarded some $8.6 
billion since 9/11 under its mandate to help local and state governments respond 
to incidents “involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive 
(CBRNE) incidents.”31
Response to Nuclear and Radiological Incidents
Under the NRP, DHS is responsible for federal government coordination in the 
event of a radiological or nuclear incident.32 DHS responds primarily through 
Regional Assistance Committees (RAC) comprised of regional DHS/FEMA per-
sonnel and attended by representatives from state emergency offices. In addition, 
DHS has established a Federal Radiological Policy Coordinating Committee 
(FRPCC), providing a conduit for the development and coordination of policies 
and procedures related to planning, preparedness, and response to radiological 
attacks with state and local governments.33
Depending on the source of the nuclear material used in the incident, other 
federal agencies may have lead operational and jurisdictional responsibilities, but 
DHS would remain in all cases the principal federal coordinator. For example, if 
an RDD or IND incident involved materials or facilities owned or operated by the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the Department of Defense (DoD), 
the controlling agency would assume responsibility for responding to the incident. 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  127
In all other cases, the Department of Energy assumes primary responsibility with 
many sub-tier federal agencies operating under its authority.34
During the response phase, three teams assembled from federal and local 
resources are deployed to the scene of the incident. The Interagency Modeling 
and Atmospheric Assessment Center (IMAAC) is responsible for “production, 
coordination, and dissemination of consequence predictions for an airborne haz-
ardous material release.” An Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health 
(“Advisory Team”) provides advice on radiation protective measures. The Advisory 
Team is comprised primarily of personnel from the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). Lastly, a Federal Radiological Assessment and 
Monitoring Center (FRAMC) is set up near the scene to coordinate the efforts of 
IMAAC and the Advisory Team.35
At the appropriate time, determined on a case-by-case basis with state and local 
governments as well as DHS, the EPA will take over from DHS, or from whatever 
agency has lead authority depending on the circumstances as discussed previously to 
address clean-up issues. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is 
responsible for victim decontamination and long-term population monitoring after 
an event. This means that DHHS has responsibility to oversee the prescribing of 
medications needed in counter radiation, and administration of overall care of vic-
tims, including emergency personnel.36
Federal Guidance on Radiation
On January 3, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security released the “Applica-
tion of Protective Action Guides for Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDD) and 
Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) Incidents.”37 This document, prepared by DHS, 
DHHS, DOE, DOD, NRC, EPA, Department of Commerce, and the Depart-
ment of Labor, provides for a unified federal mechanism “to support decisions 
about actions that may need to be taken to protect the public when responding to 
or recovering from an RDD or IND incident.”38 Specifically, it applies the EPA’s 
1992 Protective Action Guide (PAG), written only to address nuclear accidents, and 
terrorist events involving radioactive materials.
The 2006 Guidance delineates three phases of response to an RDD or IND 
incident; the first phase directs emergency workers to “retrieve and care for victims, 
stabilize the scene, and public health protective actions (including sheltering-in-
place or evacuation).” The second phase focuses on recovery and a “return to some 
state of normal activities,” while the third phase is concerned with full recovery 
and cleanup.39
Prior to 2006, the 2003 Federal Guidance on Radiation contained the latest 
publicly available information on upper and lower boundaries of what were consid-
ered relatively safe and dangerous levels of radiation exposure following a nuclear 

128  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
or radiological incident.40 The 2003 Guidance, produced jointly by DHS, DHHS, 
and the Department of Veterans Affairs, was written primarily as a guide for first 
responders and health care professionals to know how to respond to victims in the 
aftermath of an RDD explosion.41
There are several differences between the 2006 and 2003 Guidance documents. 
For example, the 2003 Guide stated that there were no upper boundaries of safe 
radiation levels for occupational emergency workers that limit their response to 
life-threatening emergencies. The Guidance went on to say, however, that for all 
non-life-threatening circumstances, first responders could enter an area if dose rates 
were around 10 rem/hr or less and should leave the area, unless attempting to save 
lives, if that dose rate exceeded 100 rem/hr.42 The 2006 Guidance, on the other 
hand, because of the “broad range of potential impacts” from an RDD or IND, 
establishes no definitive “safe” boundaries for exposure. Emergency workers are 
advised, however, to limit their exposure to 5 rem/hr “or greater under exceptional 
circumstances.” Radiation parameters for public exposure, in part designed to help 
authorities decide whether to order those affected to evacuate or shelter in place, are 
exactly the same figure, between 1 and 5 rem/hr.
Drawbacks to the Current Guidance
Operational Guidelines that implement the 2006 PAG and establish boundaries for 
acceptable levels of radiation contamination/exposure for a range of seven groups of 
property types are still under development. The Operational Guidelines are being 
developed by the Consequence Management Subgroup (CMS) of the RDD/IND 
Preparedness Working Group and will be published for public review on a roll-out 
basis on the Department of Energy’s Web site.43
Survey of Public Resources for Nuclear and 
Radiological Terrorism Threats
The most widely known information source geared towards preparedness is Ready.
gov, a DHS-sponsored Web site. The primary purpose of this site is to fulfill DHS’s 
mandate to “educate the public, on a continuing basis, about how to be prepared in 
case of a national emergency.”44 While Ready.gov does have two sections dedicated 
to radiological threats, “Nuclear Blasts,” and “Radiation Threats,” no discussion 
exists about what radiation is or how it can affect the human body. The informa-
tion provided states in general that one should “try to limit exposure.”45 FEMA 
has produced a slightly more detailed, all-hazards preparedness guide titled, “Are 
you Ready?” This guide, like Ready.gov, has two sections that cover nuclear blasts 
and RDDs, but provides no information about types of radiation (alpha, beta, and 
gamma), how each one interacts with the body, and what levels are considered safe 
or dangerous.46

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  129
In addition to clear recommendations from the government on what to do in 
case of a nuclear or radiological attack, people need to be told why they need to take 
certain actions and what the likely outcomes or consequences will be if they do not 
follow these guidelines. For example, it would be helpful for the public to know 
that first responders will treat conventional medical traumas before radiation vic-
tims are attended to. The reason is that it may take up to an hour for those exposed 
to near-fatal doses of radiation to express symptoms of ARS, such as vomiting, and 
those exposed to lower doses of radiation may not show symptoms for hours, days, 
or even weeks later, if ever.47 If victims of an RDD or IND attack are not aware of 
this fact, it is likely that hundreds or thousands, or possibly tens of thousands in 
the case of a nuclear blast, will rush to area hospitals seeking treatment for radiation 
exposure when in all but the most severe cases, as long as people have been properly 
decontaminated and are safely removed from the vicinity of the incident, there is 
no justification for immediate radiation treatment.48 Most individuals exposed to 
low doses of radiation, if they suffer any health effects at all, will recover naturally 
over time.49
Misperceptions about the danger that radiation poses stem from conflicting 
views on the risks of radiation exposure. Lack of consensus among top govern-
ment officials and agencies breeds lack of trust, and may lead to frustration, anger, 
fear, and panic. Because clear and accurate communication of the risks of radia-
tion exposure will be crucial in the aftermath of an RDD or nuclear attack, this 
information must be agreed upon well before an attack and made widely available 
to the public. By supplying the public with suggestions to minimize their exposure 
to radiation50 without including even basic facts about radiation, the government is 
inadvertently confirming the public’s often exaggerated fears of radiation. The fear 
of radiation, exacerbated by lack of knowledge about how radiation works, is the 
main reason why people are likely to panic in the event of a radiological or nuclear 
catastrophe, increasing the costs and consequences of response, especially in terms 
of clean-up and medical treatment of victims.
Assessment: A Strong Effort, but Gaps Remain
The above review of current national programs for preventing and responding to 
nuclear and radiological terrorism has shown that DHS and other agencies are 
undertaking a massive effort intended to protect the U.S. public from nuclear and 
radiological threats. Many aspects of this effort are well-suited to the character of 
the threat, but further action is needed in some key areas, and redirection of energy 
is called for in others. For example, DHS has made a substantial effort to develop 
and implement a public education campaign about terrorism, but has fallen short of 
providing specific guidance or information about the effects of radiation. Domestic 
intelligence agencies have made significant inroads in creating new offices and for-
mulating new directives, but only time will tell if these efforts will prove valuable in 

130  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
improving the nation’s ability to prevent nuclear terrorism and respond effectively to 
a radiological attack.
Finally, although programs to reduce the amount of nuclear and radioactive 
material potentially accessible to terrorists are understood as important elements of 
terrorism prevention at the political level, the national strategy and response plan 
per se does not give them sufficient attention. An effective strategy for prevent-
ing nuclear and radiological terrorism must include all of these components and 
prioritize them according to strategic objectives rather than extraneous political 
considerations.
Priorities for a National Homeland Security Strategy
With this in mind, the final section of this article offers a “top ten” list of priorities, 
ranked from highest to lowest, for improving the national strategy for countering 
nuclear and radiological terrorism. Most of these recommendations, particularly 
those addressing the threat of nuclear terrorism, focus on prevention, but the list 
also includes areas for improving response to nuclear and radiological incidents. The 
list is not exhaustive, as many other components of national strategy could benefit 
from reexamination or revision, but is intended to point out where new initiatives, 
different approaches, and higher levels of effort are most urgently needed.51
	
1.	Expand and accelerate the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The announce-
ment of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism at the 2006 G8 
summit is further evidence of the high priority placed on preventing terror-
ism with nuclear materials.52 Nevertheless, the scope of international efforts 
toward this goal requires further expansion.53 The objective of the Global 
Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), announced by former U.S. Secretary of 
Energy Spencer Abraham in May 2004, is to identify, secure, remove, and 
facilitate the disposition of vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials and 
equipment on a worldwide basis.54 Through the GTRI, the United States 
plans to work more intensively with Russia, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), and other global partners to return all Soviet-origin fissile 
material to safer storage in Russia and to return U.S.-origin research reactor 
spent fuel to the United States within 10 years.55 GTRI partners also intend to 
convert all research reactors using HEU to operate on low-enriched uranium 
(LEU) fuel, focusing first on the most vulnerable facilities, and to identify 
and secure nuclear and radioactive materials not covered by other cooperative 
programs. DOE created an Office of Global Threat Reduction within the 
National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) in June 2004 to imple-
ment GTRI, and signed agreements with a number of countries and organi-
zations on specific efforts for removal and repatriation of nuclear material. 
In May 2004, Russia and the United States signed an agreement to provide 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  131
technical and financial assistance to remove fresh and spent fuel from reac-
tors in more than a dozen countries to safe storage in Russia. In August of the 
same year, Germany and the United States repatriated U.S.-origin nuclear fuel 
from three German reactors under the U.S. Foreign Reactor Spent Nuclear 
Fuel Acceptance Program. In future years, GTRI envisions plans involving 
over 90 countries to recover and dispose of unsecured nuclear and radioactive 
materials, facilitate disposition of civilian HEU, and convert civilian reactors 
from HEU to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.56
	
	
Ambitious as its goals are, it is not surprising that implementation of many 
elements of GTRI has encountered difficulties and delays. For example, most 
Russian reactors using HEU still lack plans to convert to LEU. Moreover, 
the GTRI, as currently planned, will not secure all HEU that could be used 
to make nuclear weapons or INDs. Over twelve tons of U.S.-obligated HEU 
fuel shipped overseas is not covered under GTRI. The plan also does not 
cover HEU in facilities outside of research reactors, such as reactors used to 
produce medical radioisotopes, or fuel supplied by countries other than the 
United States or Russia. The expansion of GTRI to include all civilian HEU, 
together with accelerated implementation of all elements of the initiative, 
should be the number one priority in U.S. strategy for preventing nuclear 
terrorism.
	
2.	Increase intelligence on proliferation networks. The emergence of networks for 
clandestine trade in nuclear technology, the most notorious one organized 
by Pakistani metallurgist and “father of the Pakistani Bomb” Abdul Qadeer 
Khan, has created a global black market for nuclear know-how.57 The Prolif-
eration Security Initiative (PSI) and other U.S.-led efforts to interdict smug-
gling of WMD materials can hinder the efforts of these twenty-first century 
merchants of death,58 but reorientation of U.S. and allied intelligence capa-
bilities to track nuclear and radioactive materials, and the individuals and 
firms that traffic in them, will be required to strengthen the vital second line 
of defense against nuclear terrorism.
	
3.	Train the public health workforce to respond to radiation hazards. The pub-
lic health workforce is a critical element in the national infrastructure for 
responding to radiological incidents. While firefighters or paramedics are the 
likely first responders to an RDD attack, discovery of an RED incident may 
initially arise in the course of an investigation into an unusual outbreak of 
symptoms associated with radiation exposure by public health workers. At the 
same time, public health officials will play a crucial role in communicating 
the risks associated with a radiation incident to the public rapidly, accurately, 
and credibly, thus reducing the number and severity of psychological casu-
alties from radiological terrorism. The DHHS, CDC, and many state and 
county public health agencies have recognized this need and have launched 
initiatives to train the public health workforce in identifying radiation haz-
ards, diagnosing effects of radiation on health, forensic epidemiology, and 

132  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
other skills involved in response to terrorism,59 but new ideas and additional 
resources for training an often-overtaxed public health workforce should be 
given high priority.
	
4. Strengthen port security. Screening maritime cargo entering the United States 
for WMD materials is a formidable challenge; over seven million cargo con-
tainers enter the United States each year. As of April 2006, Megaports Initia-
tive programs were operational at six ports worldwide, including Greece, the 
Netherlands, the Bahamas, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Spain, initiated at eight 
others, and agreements to begin work were under negotiation with an addi-
tional 20 countries.60 However, the DOE has not yet developed a comprehen-
sive strategic plan for the Initiative, and, as with many cooperative programs 
for nuclear security, political, economic, and operational considerations are 
limiting the scope and slowing the pace of work. Developing a strategic plan 
for the Megaports Initiative should be given high priority, and once the plan 
is in place, Megaports and CSI should receive additional resources to acceler-
ate the pace of security upgrades. Closer coordination with the Coast Guard 
and the Department of Transportation, as well as port security authorities 
overseas, will likely be required to achieve the Initiatives’ objectives.
	
	
In addition to bolstering domestic coordination and international coop-
eration, more needs to be done to reduce the amount of time needed to effec-
tively scan cargo for nuclear materials to ensure the smooth flow of commerce 
at foreign ports. Improving the quality of training for personnel tasked with 
monitoring the type of radiation detection equipment implemented by Mega-
ports Initiative and CSI is likely to contribute to a reduction in the number of 
reported false-positives and will increase the efficacy of the process. Finally, 
if nuclear materials happen to escape detection at their port of origin, then 
detection at sea becomes an important intermediate step that would carry 
the added benefit of allowing the United States to distinguish low-levels of 
radiation from background “noise” that can take a long period of time to 
detect. Container-based detectors may have the potential to detect danger-
ous materials before they enter U.S. ports, allowing authorities to stop ships 
before they are close enough to U.S. shores to pose a significant hazard.
	
5.	Increase the design basis threat for nuclear power plant security. Security is a 
major concern in the design of any nuclear facility and, in general, operators 
and regulators of nuclear power plants have been diligent in planning and 
implementing protective measures. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) and other agencies have reviewed and updated security plans since 
September 11, 2001 and, in particular, the NRC revised the design basis 
threat (DBT) used to develop security plans for nuclear plants.61 Neverthe-
less, concern exists that the DBT, understandably hidden from public con-
sumption, still does not correspond to the level of effort made by al-Qaeda in 
the September 11 attacks.62

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  133
	
	
Greater reliance on nuclear power, as proposed in the George W. Bush 
administration’s energy plan,63 is likely to present more targets for this form 
of nuclear terrorism and to increase the economic impact, both direct and 
indirect, from a successful attack on a nuclear facility. A greater role for 
nuclear energy could also increase the motivations of radical antinuclear 
groups to attempt strikes on nuclear power reactors. For all these reasons, it is 
vital that security plans for existing and future nuclear plants, as well as fuel 
fabrication, reprocessing, and waste disposal facilities, reflect the higher level 
of terrorist threat that must be assumed for the foreseeable future.
	
6.	Toughen regulations for disposal of radioactive sources and tighten enforcement. 
The U.S. government also acted to improve control over radioactive sources 
after September 11. In particular, the DOE requested and received additional 
funding for its Offsite Source Recovery (OSR) Project, and EPA launched the 
Orphan Source Initiative, the first U.S. domestic program to bring orphan 
sources back under regulatory control. By February 2003, the OSR had 
recovered over 5,000 greater-than-class-C radioactive sources, and planned 
to recover over 14,000 such sources by the end of FY2010, assuming adequate 
storage facilities could be provided.64 At the state level, the Conference of 
Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), comprising members of 
state radiation control agencies, initiated a National Orphan Radioactive 
Material Disposition Program, partially funded by the NRC, in October 
2001. Despite these efforts, it is estimated that a radioactive source is reported 
as orphaned every day. To put the issue in perspective, the potential threat 
posed by high-risk radiological sources probably exceeds that of low-level 
contamination by toxic chemicals, but does not receive nearly the same level 
of EPA effort or media attention. Although government regulators and indus-
trial users have made admirable efforts to recover orphaned sources, stricter 
oversight and increased penalties for loss or improper disposal of radioac-
tive sources are still needed, and Congress should provide full funding for 
OSR.65
	
7.	Ensure that standards for education include accurate information on radiation 
hazards. A number of studies place “inoculation” of the public against unrea-
sonable fear of radiation high on their list of priorities for combating nuclear 
terrorism. Public education and risk communication are widely considered 
important components of a response strategy after a nuclear or radiological 
incident and should be made a priority.66 The public will be counting on 
the authorities to tell them whether they need to evacuate, or whether it is 
safe to go outside and leave a shelter. But the aftermath of an RDD attack is 
probably the worst time to attempt public education about radiation hazards. 
Fear and panic are not conducive to learning, and a number of government 
agencies and NGOs presenting conflicting information will hardly create a 
supportive environment for education. To avoid this situation, accurate infor-
mation about radiation and its effects should be incorporated into science 

134  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
and health curricula in public and private schools. In addition to conveying 
information about what is known and what is disputed about nuclear energy 
and radiation, curricula should incorporate learning objectives that demys-
tify radiation and require students to use trustworthy sources and multiple 
perspectives to investigate issues surrounding radiation exposure, nuclear 
power, and related topics.67
	
	
According to the Center for Disease Control, people who live within ten 
miles of a nuclear power plant are provided with educational information on 
radiation, instructions for evacuation and sheltering, and about emergency 
warning systems in place.68 Similar evacuation routes and procedures as well 
as recommendations for sheltering in place need to be disseminated to people 
living in high-density areas that are considered probable targets for a nuclear 
or radiological attack.
	
8.	Bring the Amended Physical Protection Convention into Force. The Convention 
on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, signed by 45 states and the Euro-
pean Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), requires parties to meet 
standards of protection for peaceful nuclear material being shipped inter-
nationally. The original Convention did not set any standards for nuclear 
material used or stored within countries or for material used for military pur-
poses.69 In July 2005, amendments to the Convention were agreed to after a 
long and difficult process of negotiation. These amendments require all parties 
to protect civilian nuclear facilities and material, and provide for cooperation 
between states on recovering stolen material and mitigating consequences of 
radiological sabotage.70 Because physical protection of fissile material is the 
first line of defense against nuclear terrorism, the United States, together with 
the IAEA, should place a high priority on bringing the amended Convention 
into force.71 The G8 countries should also offer developing countries addi-
tional assistance in developing and implementing physical protection sys-
tems both through expansion of the IAEA’s International Physical Protection 
Advisory Services and through new international and bilateral initiatives.
	
9.	Standardize and reform regulations for remediation after radiological attack. As 
a 2004 study points out, DHS has yet to finalize guidance for protecting the 
public from radiation hazards in the event of an RDD attack or other radio-
logical terrorist incidents. Deciding on the appropriate standards to apply is 
not a trivial task, as one study found at least 26 different standards or guide-
lines setting numerical values for acceptable radiation dosage.72 As a result, 
federal, state, and local authorities have no clear basis on which to deter-
mine acceptable levels of radiation exposure in the aftermath of a radiologi-
cal attack. The interim version of the DHS guidance, with standards based 
on EPA PAG guidelines,73 has been criticized for weakening the standards 
for radiation exposure.74 Some authorities argue instead for the stricter EPA 
Superfund standard. This limits allowable radiation after cleanup to levels 
corresponding to a 1 in 10,000 increased lifetime risk of developing can-

cer, or about 15 mrem per year. In contrast, the NRC enforces an all-source 
standard of 25 mrem per year above background radiation and considers a 
1 in 1,000 increased lifetime cancer risk to be acceptable for the public. We 
should keep in mind that the average American receives about 360 mrem of 
background radiation annually. The difference may not appear very great, 
but the difficulty of decontamination increases substantially as the maximum 
allowable dosage decreases. In addition to raising the costs of decontamina-
tion after a major RDD incident by billions of dollars, the difference between 
a 25 mrem cleanup standard and a 15 mrem standard could make the differ-
ence between reoccupation and demolition of homes, workplaces, or public 
buildings.
	
	
It is vital to set standards for radiation cleanup before a major radiologi-
cal terrorist incident occurs. If DHS waits until after such an incident, or 
takes the approach that standards should be negotiated with state and local 
governments on a case-by-case basis, the noise of the legal and political battle 
that will ensue will be louder than the explosion of the RDD. DHS should 
not be criticized too harshly for proceeding deliberately in issuing national 
guidance, because the confusion of current standards, the inability to reach 
a scientific consensus on the effects, if any, of low doses of radiation, and the 
interests of multiple stakeholders greatly complicates the process. Neverthe-
less, further research seems unlikely to produce greater clarity. The time has 
come to fight the political battles, finalize the standards reflected in DHS 
interim guidance for post-attack radiation exposure, and embed these stan-
dards in legislation before the first dirty bomb goes off.
	 10.	Develop advanced technologies for radioactive decontamination. The discus-
sion of radiation protection standards emphasizes that decontamination, as 
the final stage of response to a nuclear or radioactive attack, will be criti-
cal for mitigating the economic, environmental, and psychological impact 
of these forms of terrorism. Fire department HAZMAT teams and other 
first responders have upgraded training and equipment for decontamination 
after chemical and biological attacks, and some of the same equipment and 
procedures can be used for decontamination of personnel and areas affected 
by radioactive fallout. However, some forms of radiological attack can leave 
persistent contamination that simply hosing down with water or a bleach 
solution will not remedy. For example, cesium-137 chloride bonds to con-
crete, making it extremely difficult to remove from urban areas.75 Because 
remediation plays such an important role in mitigating the long-term impact 
of a radiological incident, DHS-sponsored research at national laboratories 
and in the private sector should give higher priority to development of new 
equipment and procedures for radioactive decontamination.76
	
	
In addition, the government should be doing all that it can to promote 
radiation countermeasures, also known as radioprotectorants. An increased 
effort in this regard would serve several purposes. First, it would instill  

136  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
confidence in the public that the government was acting responsibly and pro-
actively. Second, if people were aware that radioprotectorants were available 
to them prior to and after an attack, it might alleviate the pressures of panic 
and decrease the number of those in close proximity of the disaster area to 
self-evacuate. Third, countermeasures could dissuade terrorists from attack-
ing if they knew that antidotes to the radiation released in a nuclear or radio-
logical attack would be widely available.
Conclusion: Integrating Prevention and Response
Implementing the top ten priorities outlined above would not fill all the gaps in 
U.S. strategy to combat nuclear and radiological terrorism, but it would seal the 
most urgent breaches and repair the most obvious holes. Over the longer term, pro-
tecting the U.S. public from nuclear and radiological attack will require a broader 
perspective on the problem that no single agency is well suited to provide. In many 
areas, the agency that must play the leading role in preventing these forms of ter-
rorism has little, if any, responsibility for responding in the event of an attack, 
and vice versa. Policies for protecting vulnerable nuclear material are formulated in 
Foggy Bottom, the Pentagon, and the Forrestal Building, but training the public 
health workforce to detect radiological events is coordinated in Atlanta. This is an 
understandable and unavoidable consequence of different competencies and juris-
dictional boundaries, but it highlights the need for interagency cooperation. Just as 
the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Treasury and the plethora of 
intelligence agencies have had to work together in order to advance the traditional 
national security interests of the United States, all of these departments plus Home-
land Security, Health and Human Services, Justice, and the EPA must coordinate 
their roles in the national homeland security strategy. Leadership at the political 
level will obviously be critical for this, but the formation of long-term collaborative 
relationships between working-level officials across institutional boundaries will be 
especially crucial for integrating prevention with response. It is unrealistic to expect 
that all these governmental entities will see eye-to-eye on a majority of important 
issues, but those on the front lines of prevention and those charged with emergency 
response and their managers must be prepared to make trade-offs when submitting 
budget requests.
The fact that implementing many priorities for homeland security requires 
international cooperation emphasizes that in preventing nuclear and radiological 
terrorism, the “national security borders” of the United States extend far beyond its 
territorial boundaries. This is evidenced most dramatically in the need to protect 
nuclear weapons in Russia and Pakistan and secure fissile material in over 130 
countries. Shoring up the first line of defense against nuclear terrorism will thus 
involve attentive leadership and financial investment, but if these activities are con-
ducted according to a well-thought-out strategic plan under reasonable oversight, 

Nuclear and Radioactive Threats to Homeland Security  n  137
these investments will pay big security dividends. At the same time, “inreach” 
to domestic NGOs can help build public confidence in both the preventive and 
responsive components of national strategy.
Ultimately, although the distinction between prevention and response is ana-
lytically useful and comfortably fits institutional boundaries, it is somewhat artifi-
cial. The involvement of first responders in formulating strategy will help improve 
prevention, and input from agencies responsible for prevention will help strengthen 
response. Strategic emphasis should be placed and resources concentrated on the 
most effective point to block the pathway from terrorists’ intentions to use nuclear 
or radioactive materials, to the use of those materials to cause human, economic, 
and environmental casualties. In fighting radiological terrorism, radioactive mate-
rials are widely available but limited in effect, so detection and decontamination 
will be most important. With nuclear terrorism, because fissile material is very rare 
but potentially devastating in sufficient quantity, an ounce of prevention will be 
worth kilotons of cure.

5,000 mrem or higher can cause observable biological effects and that higher doses 
significantly increase the risk of injury or death. There is little evidence of risk to 
health or safety from doses of 1,000 mrem or lower, but according to the Linear 
No-Threshold (LNT) model of radiation effects, any dose of ionizing radiation could 
pose some long-term risk of cancer or other illness. (The average American receives 
about 360 mrem of ionizing radiation each year from natural and man-made sources.)

to radiation (see note 11). In the context of a national disaster involving radiological 
weapons, people exposed to less than 100 rem will experience no signs of illness, but 
there will be a temporary decrease in white blood cells and platelets. Acute radiation 
syndrome (ARS) is likely to occur when a person is exposed to 100 rem or more, 
and those levels are not likely to be present in an RDD, according to the National 
Academies of Science and the Department of Homeland Security. Signs and symp-

Chapter 8
Comparative 
Risk Analysis
Biological Terrorism, 
Pandemics, and Other 
“Forgotten” Catastrophic 
Disaster Threats
Terrence M. O’Sullivan
The author thinks outside the box, taking a broad view 
of homeland security challenges, including, but not 
confined to, coping with terrorist threats. Although 
terrorism, including biological terrorism is a threat 
to the security of the homeland, so are natural disas-
ters—earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, and 
disease epidemics. O’Sullivan notes how lacking any 
broad-based system for risk assessment or critical infra-
structure prioritization, homeland security policy not 
unexpectedly defaulted to politically driven allocations, 
with less populous states receiving funds dispropor-
tionately large in comparison to either their demo-
graphics or the importance of their levels of disaster

risk. Given his holistic view that includes both natural 
and human-induced threats, the author raises serious 
questions about the institutional capacities and organi-
zational cultures within federal, state and local security 
agencies and infrastructures.
Both before and immediately after 9/11, “homeland security” almost exclusively 
reflected rising concerns about terrorism. But American public and governmen-
tal expectations of homeland security eventually broadened, impelled in part by a 
series of events that included some of the worst naturally occurring domestic and 
international disasters in generations. In 2004, the Great Sumatra Earthquake and 
accompanying tsunami, and the devastating Pakistan/Kashmir earthquake the fol-
lowing year, killed hundreds of thousands in Asia. These events coincided with a 
rising global awareness of the formidable global pandemic potential of the avian 
(H5N1) influenza virus, as outbreaks among birds and humans occurred across 
Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the European Union.
Of the many sobering nonterrorist events that occurred around that particu-
lar time, though, among the most tangible and traumatic for Americans was a 
back-to-back set of domestic disasters that centered on Hurricane Katrina and the 
subsequent flooding of New Orleans, and the psychologically and institutionally 
damaging Hurricane Rita. Both were widely televised natural disasters compounded 
by pre- and post-event human errors. Because of those mistakes, Hurricane Katrina 
was the most costly natural disaster in modern U.S. history, with consequences on a 
scale rivaled only by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And Hurricane Rita, which occurred 
only weeks later, was best characterized not by its relatively mild destruction, but 
by the fiasco of its chaotic mass evacuation, as fearful residents obeyed pleas to 
abandon the Galveston and Houston areas in Texas.
These events disturbed many Americans profoundly by vividly exposing U.S. 
failures in preparedness and response leadership and capability in the face of locally 
overwhelming natural calamities, and by logical extension highlighted similar 
shortcomings relevant to future terrorism preparation and response. Moreover, 
these revelations collectively helped muddy the homeland security waters by cata-
lyzing a nascent, though ambivalent, conceptual, operational, and political reexam-
ination of the U.S. government’s security priorities. At the heart of these changes 
in thinking was the realization that, as much as possible, policymaking required 
comparing all threats across the security spectrum, and rationing limited resources 
for the most important and cost-effective risk areas.
This chapter integrates a set of issues that are intimately connected to effective 
“homeland security” strategy and policy. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earth-
quakes, tsunamis, floods, and disease epidemics, as well as deliberate biological terror-
ism, are all threats that highlight the critical need for national, and global, policies based 
on comparative risk analysis. All of these cases have been, for various reasons, neglected 

Comparative Risk Analysis  n  149
or even “forgotten” dimensions of homeland security.1 But they help illustrate collec-
tively the critical need for comparatively weighing the relative threats, vulnerabilities 
and consequences associated with a broader spectrum of possible catastrophic disas-
ters, whether natural or man-made, that might befall civilian populations.
The first section provides a backdrop by briefly noting some of the conceptual, 
operational, and political debates that have surrounded “homeland security,” and 
the reasons that now motivate governmental emphasis on comparative risk analysis. 
Next, we address some of the elemental forces of nature that must be considered 
serious threats to domestic security in addition to terrorism. In the third section, 
we examine a unique category of disaster risk, catastrophic infectious disease out-
breaks (CIDOs), spanning both naturally occurring epidemic threats, such as severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the H5N1 “bird flu” pathogens, as well as 
bioterrorism (BT). Although BT is clearly under the domain of homeland security, 
it was not always treated as such.2 Finally, to analyze all significant catastrophic 
threats to a country holistically, rather than merely in isolation, is a challenging 
enterprise. U.S. efforts to reassess more systematically the potential risk of terrorism 
were begun even before Hurricane Katrina altered the national priorities equation, 
but U.S. domestic security strategies must be rationally formulated in a context of 
limited resources, an adaptive adversary—be it terrorists or nature—and the inter-
dependent domestic and global costs and benefits.
A Note About Comparative Risk Assessment
Risk has been a historically disputed term, but its essence is the desire to gauge the 
likelihood of something being a hazard, and to project the possible outcomes should 
they occur, so that the costs and benefits of mitigating, risk-reducing measures can 
be assessed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) adopted a definition 
that breaks risk down into three integrated components: threats, vulnerabilities, 
and consequences. This is not the only framework, but it is a useful standard for 
national, state, and local risk analysis of potential disasters. Broadly speaking, the 
threat includes the motivation, targets, and tactics of the terrorist, whose poten-
tial weapons would consist of a gun or a viral biological agent. The vulnerabilities 
would entail anything that might make the target or potential victims more or less 
susceptible to attack or harm, such as a bulletproof vest or a smallpox vaccination. 
Finally, the consequences could range from no injuries to many, no epidemic to a 
large one. Attempting to anticipate all three of these risk variables is important for 
coming back around full circle to assessing, comparatively and rationally, a variety 
of different potential threats and overall risks. This DHS risk framework will be 
used loosely below. For most catastrophic risk, prevention is usually the most cost-
effective strategy; but for most natural disasters, and some human-caused threats 
such as biological terrorism, prevention can be very difficult or impossible, thus 
making adequate preparation and response capability the most important policy 
strategy.

150  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Debates about Homeland Security 
Strategy in Theory and Practice
The concept of homeland security originally emerged most robustly in the 1990s 
as global terrorism concerns grew.3 Federal government officials began using the 
terms “homeland defense” and “homeland security” to refer to various concepts 
of securing U.S. territorial borders. In February 2001, in its Phase III report, the 
Hart-Rudman Commission4 recommended significant changes in U.S. government 
“homeland security” policies and activities. Among its recommendations was the 
establishment of a new agency, the National Homeland Security Agency, intended 
to integrate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Customs 
Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the Coast Guard. Although policy officials 
continue to distinguish between “homeland defense” and “homeland security,”5 
the former belonging bureaucratically to the Defense Department and the latter to 
the Department of Homeland Security, in the public mind the two have become 
conflated.
Creation of the Department of Homeland Security, originally the Office of 
Homeland Security, OHS, was a direct political and strategic policy response 
to the 9/11 and October 2001 anthrax letter attacks, and was the largest reor-
ganization of the federal government since the National Security Act of 1947. 
The national consensus seemed clear: securing the homeland specifically meant 
countering terrorism. Thus, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 chartered the 
DHS to first and foremost “prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; 
reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and minimize the 
damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within 
the United States.”6 Although DHS as formed contained structural elements nec-
essary for a broader mission beyond just terrorism, for years afterwards, federal 
resources previously aimed at naturally occurring disaster response were often 
redirected toward domestic terrorism priorities, the wars in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, and related military and law enforcement issues. In particular, FEMA, one 
of the 22 component agencies that the government haphazardly placed under the 
umbrella of DHS after 9/11, suffered from this neglect of naturally occurring 
disaster response.
The Muddled Homeland Security 
Mandate: FEMA the “Stepchild”
FEMA was a civilian, nonsecurity/nonlaw-enforcement entity chartered for natural 
disaster management and recovery, principally dealing with the effects of hurri-
canes. Though the original OHS mandate contained no specific mention of nonter-
rorist threats, by absorbing FEMA, DHS included at least an implied mandate for 
concern about naturally occurring, nonterrorist risks.7 Notably, most of the other 

Comparative Risk Analysis  n  151
various federal agencies and organizations that were subsumed within DHS origi-
nally encompassed neither explicit civil defense nor military functions, per se, nor 
even primarily law-enforcement missions, with the exceptions of the Coast Guard, 
the Border Patrol/Immigration, Customs Service and Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service (now together Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and the Secret 
Service.
The creation of DHS showed that conflicts between theory and practice, par-
ticularly in bureaucratic structure and execution, could have enormous security 
implications for prevention, preparation, response, and recovery from both poten-
tial terrorist and naturally occurring disasters. In February 2006, Congressional 
hearings held four months after Katrina and Rita, former FEMA director Michael 
Brown confirmed that the agency had experienced reduced status and neglect when 
it was put under the DHS umbrella.8 In the days before and immediately after 
Katrina, despite numerous explicit reports and warnings, both DHS and the White 
House were slow to make the hurricane and subsequent flooding a major national 
priority. More broadly, Brown asserted that neither had truly cared about nonter-
rorist threats, and had demoted natural disasters to being a “stepchild” of national 
security. He testified, “It is my belief [that if] we’ve confirmed that a terrorist has 
[sic] blown up the 17th Street Canal levee, then everybody would have jumped 
all over that and been trying to do everything they could.”9 Indeed, even admin-
istration supporters reluctantly concluded that Katrina fell through the cracks in 
part because the agency typically in charge had been swallowed up by a security 
enforcement/counterterrorism organization.
The Elusive Comparative Risk Analysis Approach
Even within the terrorism aspects of homeland security, comparative risk priori-
tization proved difficult, given a frustrating lack of precedents, minimal field or 
research data, and the political realities of the day. In the immediate years after 
9/11, U.S. government homeland security terrorism spending was rarely systematic 
or coherent. Complaints mounted about counterterrorism money misallocated on 
air-conditioned garbage trucks and other unnecessary schemes, about overlooked 
vulnerabilities in key areas such as port and border security or bioterrorism, or of 
complicated federal-state allocation formulas which valued petting zoos in rural 
areas on a par with New York City monuments.10 Moreover, as late as fiscal year 
2006, the Transportation Safety Administration, ostensibly responsible for all 
transportation security, was funded at a 10 to 1 ratio in favor of aviation.
Furthermore, lacking any broad-based system for risk assessment or critical 
infrastructure prioritization, homeland security policy also defaulted to politically 
driven population-based allocation, meaning that less populous states received 
funds disproportionately large in comparison to their demographics or the impor-
tance of their commercial activities. However, this began to change slowly, spurred 

152  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
by the realization that low-probability targets in less populous areas were receiving 
money at higher per-capita rates than high-probability cities such as New York, Los 
Angeles, and Washington, D.C.
Elemental Natural Disasters and Forces Majeures
The U.S. government’s preparations before and response to Hurricanes Katrina and 
Rita shocked a world unaccustomed to seeing the United States fail to react rela-
tively quickly and competently to a major domestic disaster. The following natural 
disaster threats begin to show why optimal domestic “homeland” security policy 
should comparatively weigh the potential risks from both nature and man.
Hurricanes
Hurricane Katrina was the biggest natural disaster in modern American history, 
projected to cost as much as $100 to 200 billion or more before its protracted 
aftermath was resolved. Yet it was the New Orleans canal levee floodwalls’ failure 
and flooding, and not Katrina itself, that contributed most to the overall economic 
losses and that caused most of the 1,300 or so hurricane-related deaths. A National 
Science Foundation report concluded that had the levee floodwalls been properly 
designed, and had they held as they were supposed to, a large part of Katrina’s con-
sequences would have been avoided.11 Similarly, subsequent investigations showed 
that despite the fact that local response was overwhelmed by the disaster, federal 
and state government response was slow, disorganized, and bureaucratically bogged 
down, adding considerably to the human suffering and chaos.12
Hurricane Rita occurred less than a month after Katrina. For a period of time 
after it had entered the Gulf of Mexico and was heading for the U.S. coast, Rita 
was among the most powerful (Category 5) hurricanes ever recorded. In the wake 
of Katrina, people feared an even greater calamity because of Rita’s brief strong 
storm rating. Fears were further magnified by historic memories in southern Texas 
of the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest in U.S. history, with between 6,000 
and 8,000 killed. Because of those fears, Rita triggered an enormous evacuation of 
Galveston, Houston, and neighboring areas in Texas. That evacuation went poorly, 
resulting in confusion, stranded motorists on jammed freeways, and accidental 
deaths. It further demonstrated a widespread lack of effective U.S. disaster plan-
ning and response.
Earthquakes
Seismologists often cannot pinpoint exact figures for energy release and damage, 
but any earthquake over a 5.5 on a logarithmic magnitude scale is generally consid-

Comparative Risk Analysis  n  153
ered significant. It is estimated that the largest earthquake ever recorded was a 9.5 
magnitude off the coast of Chile, in 1960.13 The deadliest earthquake ever recorded 
killed over 800,000 in Shansi Province, China, in 1556. And most recently, in 
December 2004, the 9.0 magnitude Great Sumatra Indonesia Earthquake, the 
fourth largest ever recorded, resulted in the infamous Indian Ocean tsunamis that 
killed up to 280,000 people from Thailand to Somalia. The following year, the 
7.6 Pakistan/Kashmir earthquake killed over 80,000 and left over one million 
homeless.
Most Americans think of California and its San Andreas Fault when they con-
sider U.S. catastrophic earthquake risk. To be sure, California has experienced 
damaging quakes, such as the 1987 5.9 Whittier Narrows, the 1994 7.1 magnitude 
Loma Prieta earthquake near San Francisco, and the 1994 6.7 Northridge earth-
quakes, the latter causing $40 billon in damage and 57 deaths.14 And certainly vari-
ous worst-case estimates put consequences to Los Angeles or San Francisco in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars—with potentially over 10,000 dead. Nevertheless, 
significant threats from major seismic events exist from active faults in other U.S. 
regions, such as Alaska, and the 700-mile-long Cascadia subduction zone, just off 
the Pacific Northwest coast. New York City sits on a network of faults thought to 
be capable of producing shaking equivalent to the 6.8 Kobe, Japan Earthquake.15
Tsunamis
Tsunamis are most frequently associated with earthquakes, but natural underwater 
landslides on the continental shelf, the collapse of dry landmasses such as volcanic 
islands, or ice shelves, into a body of water, or volcanic eruptions may all generate 
catastrophic events. A number of reports done after the calamitous December 2004 
Indian Ocean tsunami warned of substantial U.S. tsunami risk, particularly in the 
Pacific Basin states of Washington, Oregon, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. In the 
twentieth century, most destructive American tsunamis originated in Alaska and 
Pacific Basin sites thousands of miles away. The 1960 Chilean 9.5 earthquake pro-
duced 80-foot tsunami surges and killed almost 2,000 within 30 minutes. But the 
same tsunamis also reached Hawaii, 6,500 miles and 15 hours later, with 35-foot 
waves that killed 61 people and caused $24 million in damage. Due in part to that 
event, Hawaii is now the best tsunami-prepared U.S. state.
Perhaps the greatest American tsunami threat potential is from the Cascadia 
subduction zone, which 300 years ago generated quakes with tsunamis as big as 
the 2004 Sumatra/Indian Ocean event. Indeed, every 500 years on average, it is 
believed to be capable of earthquakes substantial enough to generate tsunami surges 
from as much as 30 to 100 feet, hitting the coast within half an hour or less.16 
Moreover, tsunamis could be devastating to the economy of the United States, 
capable of crippling key trade facilities, such as those at the ports of Los Angeles 
and Long Beach. Even a smaller tsunami could cost up to $60 billion.17

154  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Floods
The flood risk in New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta area was well established 
before Hurricane Katrina. Yet hurricanes continue to be a flooding threat until 
major, decades-long redesign and reconstruction of levees and floodwalls, as well as 
costly restoration of the deteriorating Delta itself, can be accomplished.
A less well known but similar threat from catastrophic levee breaches and flood-
ing exists in California’s critical San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta. Among its 
many critical functions, the delta supplies up to half of the drinking water supply for 
more than 20 million Southern Californians. Unfortunately, projections estimate 
that worst-case levee/dike breaches could rival the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, 
and devastate the California economy. One key report estimates a 60 percent chance 
of a catastrophic delta flood or levee-breaching earthquake by 2050. According to 
the state’s top water official, failure of the decrepit levee/dike system would flood 
islands, damage highways and oil pipelines, submerge thousands of homes, and push 
Pacific Ocean saltwater eastward, potentially disrupting state water deliveries for 
more than a year.18
For Better and Worse: Globalization, Infectious 
Diseases, and the Biological Century
The scourge of pathogenic organisms is age-old. During the twentieth century 
alone, for example, up to 500 million people died of smallpox before that dis-
ease was eradicated from the natural environment. Diseases such as cholera, yel-
low fever, plague, typhoid fever, and polio have vexed humanity at different times 
throughout history.
The rise of the postwar liberal economic system has led to tremendous pros-
perity in many parts of the world, particularly among the Western industrialized 
countries. This material comfort has fostered dramatic advances in medical sci-
ence, public health, standards of living, and life expectancy, through revolutions 
in immunization, antibiotics, and disease prevention methods. Such advances in 
health have led to most Western nations being relatively unworried about the effects 
of lethal infectious diseases.
The Bioterrorism-Bird Flu Nexus
The simplest reason for analyzing naturally occurring and bioterrorist-caused cata-
strophic infectious disease outbreaks (CIDOs) in tandem is that unlike other terrorist 
or nonterrorist threats, almost all prevention, preparation, protection, and conse-
quence mitigating response strategies overlap, no matter what the causality. This 
reasoning is based on the following suppositions:

Comparative Risk Analysis  n  155
	
1.	Naturally occurring disease pandemics have the potential to kill as many or 
even far more people than weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorism.
	
2.	Bioterrorist WMDs have the potential to kill as many or even more people 
than nuclear terrorism.
	
3.	Bioterrorism (BT) is very difficult to prevent, in part because bioweapons 
production, transportation, and dissemination is comparatively easy to 
conceal.
	
4.	Unlike other potential weapons of mass destruction, homeland security strat-
egies and resources needed to manage BT vulnerabilities and consequences 
are uniquely similar to those necessary for naturally occurring outbreaks.
	
5.	Strategies to deal with microbial threat, regardless of causality, are uniquely 
different from most other terrorist countermeasures and should favor improv-
ing nontraditional local and state vs. federal “critical infrastructures” capabili-
ties, such as public health, the overall health care system, emergency medical 
services, all of which would raise societal and global resiliency to both terror-
ism and naturally occurring catastrophes of all types.
	
6.	Together, both outbreak sources illustrate the unusual strategic, jurisdic-
tional, and conceptual problems inherent in such broadly cross-cutting sub-
ject areas.19
Globalization Externalities: Public Health Goods and “Bads”
For decades before anthrax, SARS, and avian influenza, warnings from the global 
public health expert community that globalization, population pressures, and 
neglect of public health infrastructure were rapidly increasing global microbial dis-
ease risks went largely unheeded.20 Only after the turn of the millennium, with 
the interdependent world anxious over first SARS and then avian influenza, did 
policymakers and the public finally begin to respond to these naturally occurring 
threats.
Pathogenic microbial threats, the first component of risk, are the equivalent 
of the terrorist and his weapon(s). Pathogens are being aided by the unintended 
side effects, what economists refer to as externalities, of increasing globalization. 
Specifically, rapidly expanding trade, travel, urbanization, antibiotic and other 
antimicrobial drug misuse and overuse, and even organized crime growth have 
created significant transnational vulnerabilities to catastrophic infectious disease 
outbreaks, whatever their cause. Meanwhile, growing bioterrorism threats are a sin-
ister externality of microbiological, pharmaceutical, and other scientific advances.21 
On the vulnerability and consequences side of the risk equation, both types of CIDO 
threats are also as high as they are because of continued neglect of public health, 
emergency medical systems, and the steady privatization of health care worldwide. 
From a disaster management standpoint, those “critical infrastructures” are just as 
important as electricity, fuel, food and water, and transportation systems, but they 

156  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
had not been viewed as such by most homeland security analysts until well into the 
first decade of the new century.
Although globalization has been a major catalyst for many of these related 
health and wealth advances, the world’s economic system has simultaneously gen-
erated an ironic, growing burden. For its continued robust growth, the modern, 
integrated trading system has come to depend on the economic participation of 
more of the world’s population than ever before. Overall global trade doubled 
during the 1990s.22 Vulnerability to CIDOs arises because of the very changes 
that globalization has made in trade in goods and services, international tourism 
and travel, and the opening and integration of borders. This has created a veri-
table “trade” in pathogenic organisms and their vectors, improved the ease and 
speed with which microorganisms can spread, and conveniently herded humanity 
into interconnected cities, vastly improving the potential for infectious disease 
transmission.
Naturally Occurring Disease Outbreaks 
and Civilian Biodefense
Three fundamental characteristics or trends in the current economic regime 
collectively raise the likelihood that future catastrophic infectious outbreak 
problems, the indirect public health goods costs of globalization, will grow in 
magnitude. These include cross-border trade and travel, competitive privatization, 
and integration.
First, the tremendous volume and penetration of trade in goods and informa-
tion services promote high levels of unintended “trade” in naturally occurring 
pathogens as well as deliberate, legal and illegal trade in the agents, equipment, 
technology, and expertise needed for bioterrorism. Second, private sector-oriented 
economic liberalization has privileged higher value-added private medical goods 
and services, and led to worldwide under-investment in and neglectful deteriora-
tion of important public health goods and infrastructure. The latter is necessary 
to mitigate the harsh disruption of human ecosystems that result in increasing 
infectious disease threats. Third, greater global economic integration has created a 
more favorable environment for catastrophic disease outbreaks to spread widely and 
quickly, by opening borders and promoting high volumes of rapid travel, economic 
migration, and urbanization. People are closer together and more quickly acces-
sible to microbes. Ultimately, the risks from pathogenic outbreaks rise because, in 
a world that is more interdependent every year, the health of one person, nation, 
or region cannot easily be isolated from the health of all. Below, two of the most 
notable CIDO outbreaks since the turn of the century are described; each was 
aided and abetted by globalization.

SARS
In March 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) issued the first of a series 
of rare global alerts about a novel viral outbreak that had alarmed the entire world 
with its suddenness, novelty, and mortality rates. Over 8,000 became ill, and over 
800 perished, a 10 percent case mortality rate, in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Vietnam, Canada, and more than a dozen other nations around the world. The 
pathogen, dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV), 
was a newly mutated strain, a cousin of a common cold microbe.23
China’s SARS outbreak exemplified the need for increased international public 
health regulation. Early on, Chinese cover ups and belligerent assertions of sov-
ereignty contributed to what might have become a global pandemic. The WHO 
was stymied during the crucial early stages of the outbreak by a lack of sanction 
ability, and forced to cajole and embarrass the Chinese regime into cooperating 
in the SARS investigation and control effort. Among the many other alarming 
characteristics of SARS was its ability to kill victims who had access to intensive 
emergency health care, leading public health experts at the time to wonder how 
much higher already impressive death rates would climb if SARS reached rural 
areas of China or other nations. For instance, the Canadian outbreak, centered in 
Toronto, compiled over a 10 percent mortality rate amidst some of the best medical 
care in the world.24
At its outset, some had even speculated that this could be the start of a deadly 
pandemic, akin to the notorious 1918 influenza. The broad WHO alert urged cur-
tailed travel in affected areas, and led to significant economic losses to these tour-
ism- and commerce-dependent regions, as well as heightened global public fears. 
Nevertheless, the WHO would later be applauded for its quick action. In the end, 
one model estimated short-term global losses from curtailed economic activity and 
trade, as well as within key economic sectors such as medical, travel, consumer 
confidence, and investment, at $80 billion. Actual medium- to long-term losses 
were clearly greater.25
Avian Influenza: The Inter-Pandemic Period, 
and Planning for the Inevitable
Influenza pandemics have occurred periodically throughout history, so much so 
that leading experts refer to times in between as “inter-pandemic period(s).” In 
1997, the first indicator that the current inter-pandemic period might soon come to 
a close occurred in Hong Kong with the first H5N1 strain outbreak, which killed 
six people and led to the well-publicized slaughter of over a million virus-carry-
ing chickens and fowl. As with the infamous 1918 influenza virus, this “avian” flu 
had apparently mutated from a benign form into one against which humans had 
little natural resistance. The Hong Kong outbreak had approximately a 33 percent 
mortality rate. As one observer stated: “While the outbreak highlighted the success 

158  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
of the [influenza] surveillance network, it also showed how dangerously mutable 
influenza viruses can be, and that, in their most deadly forms, they can be as deadly 
as any other disease known to man, more akin to Ebola than to the fevers and aches 
most people associate with flu.”26
Highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza fully emerged on the global radar 
around 2005.27 While initially killing less than 100 people, the “bird” flu had more 
than a 50 percent case fatality/mortality rate, and an uncertain potential of mutat-
ing or reassorting to create a deadly global pandemic.28 In October 2005, David 
Nabarro, World Health Organization (WHO) chief of avian influenza, declared 
that a human “bird flu” pandemic was inevitable, despite the fact that little or no 
human-to-human transmission had then occurred. Nabarro based his prediction 
on the observation that carried by migratory birds transmitting the virus to domes-
tic bird flocks, the avian (H5N1) flu was spreading to every part of the world. With 
each animal and human exposure, there was a rising risk of viral mutation, or of 
H5N1 exchanging genetic material within the cauldron of a person co-infected 
with “normal” human flu. In November 2005, the WHO issued a report projecting 
the global gross domestic product (GDP) to decline by 2 percent during a modest 
flu pandemic. This is commensurate with quarterly losses sustained by Hong Kong 
and Toronto during the SARS epidemic.
Even in an average season, 40,000 to 50,000 Americans die, and 114,000 are 
hospitalized, due to influenza annually. These figures are projected to increase 
steadily, in all Western nations, with expanding susceptible elderly populations. 
Periodically, however, Type-A influenza viruses undergo significant genetic change, 
or antigenic shift, allowing “sudden, pervasive infection in all age groups.”29 Esti-
mates on possible death and disruption from the next global influenza pandemic 
vary widely. The CDC estimates in the worst case a human-to-human transmissible 
H5N1 could cause 90,000 to 207,000 American deaths alone, almost a million 
hospitalizations, and potentially sicken a third of the U.S. population in a matter 
of months. The estimated economic impact might range from $70 to $170 bil-
lion dollars, not accounting for “disruptions to commerce and society.”30A 2006 
World Bank report asserted the economic losses in a worst case could exceed $550 
billion for the high-income nations alone, $1 trillion to $3 trillion overall. The 
Asian Development Bank projected economic damage of $280 billion in the East 
Asia region, assuming 20 percent of the region’s population falls ill. Other worst-
case estimates put U.S. deaths between 200,000 and 1.9 million, with 92 million 
illnesses, and 100 to 300 million deaths worldwide, possibly within a ten-week 
period. Even a moderately severe pandemic, more akin to the 1968 flu outbreak, 
if adjusted for population, could cost $180 billion, not even including business 
disruptions.31
With proper collective international action, globalization’s negative role in 
amplifying these rising pathogenic threats can be reduced, and its positive contri-
butions to global health continued and enhanced. However, in an era of global inte-
gration the threat from catastrophic infectious diseases will never be eliminated.

Bioweapons and Bioterrorism: The Dark 
Side of the Biotechnology Revolution
Only recently have most security analysts or even medical experts fully fathomed 
the idea that biological weapons have a rapidly, inexorably growing potential for 
casualties on a scale not imagined since the Cold War. Frequently referred to as 
“public health in reverse,” biological terrorism is a significant current and future 
threat to both Western and non-Western societies. Because of scientific advances, 
amidst proliferation of various possible terrorist weapons of mass destruction,32 bio-
weapons may ultimately hold the greatest risk of all for creating terror, disruption, 
disease, and death. But unlike nuclear or even chemical weapons threats, it is far 
more difficult to police these technologies and materials. The increasingly available 
equipment and processing techniques for modern medical research and pharma-
ceutical production overlap considerably with technology and equipment needed 
to produce and disseminate biological agents for ill-purpose.
As a broad potential WMD category, BT risk assessment is uniquely challeng-
ing: it is more a future threat than one with a discernable historic pattern, and 
possesses difficult, complex first-response and consequence management dynamics, 
especially in worst-case scenarios. Indeed, it is not easy to comparatively rank BT 
risk by the pathogen or germ, given the importance of technological variables in 
genetic engineering, processing, delivery and dispersal, and environmental (includ-
ing weather) conditions at the time of an attack. To some extent, these variables 
transcend the mere existence or availability of a historically deadly naturally occur-
ring bug. Is smallpox more dangerous than anthrax or tularemia? The answer must 
always be “it depends,” and on more than simple agent availability and traditional 
naturally occurring disease mortality rates.
Biological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction as well as cata-
strophic terrorism in general are, as Ashton Carter noted: “destined to be a center-
piece of the field of international security”—the newest “A-list” security challenges 
for the twenty-first century.33 Of these ascendant terrorist threats, biological 
terrorism has been the least understood within the security policy community. 
Among the reasons bioterrorism is misunderstood, and Western civilian biode-
fense preparation has been poor, is the unique nature of pathogenic agents and 
the disease outbreaks they can cause. Unlike virtually all other possible acts of ter-
rorism, bioterrorism events are public health disasters, first and foremost. They are 
criminal acts as well. Indeed, effective bioterrorism policy should have ultimately 
less in common with traditional security measures, or even nuclear and chemi-
cal terrorism response, than it does with traditional public health, epidemiology, 
and emergency disaster preparedness and response. Bioterrorism preparation and 
countermeasures resemble other counter-WMD methods, and all terrorism, for 
that matter, primarily in the realm of intelligence gathering and covert opera-
tions aimed at prevention and interdiction. But the latter are far more difficult for 
bioterrorism than for other weapons of mass destruction and, thus, bioterrorism 

160  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
countermeasures are far more likely to be cost effective at the levels of vulner-
ability and consequence management. Bioterrorism is a uniquely dangerous form 
of terror-causing havoc, due to its ability to inflict intense combinations of death, 
disease, and disruption.
How Dangerous Is Bioterrorism? The BT 
Technology Growth Curve
Prior to 9/11 and to the 2001 anthrax attacks, few American security or terrorism 
analysts fully understood or appreciated the growing potential of biological threats. 
But for vulnerable civilian populations, whatever the current risk may be, the threat 
from bioweapons is growing. Considerable debate exists concerning the current 
probability and potential of mass casualty bioterrorism, ranging from those who 
claim bioterrorism is the greatest threat to humanity, exceeding even nuclear ter-
rorism,34 and others claiming that the probabilities are very small and over-hyped. 
Still others are concerned that bioterrorism has shifted attention away from other 
terrorism risks and serious public health priorities. The controversy over homeland 
security policy in the wake of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina debacle, in which crit-
ics charged DHS and the White House with excessive concentration on terrorism 
over naturally occurring threats mirrors, to some extent, the aforementioned debate 
about bioterrorism’s purported importance.
One example that amply demonstrates some, though not all, of the potential for 
biological agents is Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria responsible for causing anthrax. 
Anthrax is believed to be a significant biological terrorism threat, particularly 
because it has already shown it has capabilities in two major historical incidents. 
The first was an inadvertent 1979 release of aerosolized anthrax spores at a military 
bioweapons facility in the Russian city of Sverdlovsk, an incident denied by the 
Soviets until after the Cold War’s end, that resulted in up to 100 cases of civilian 
anthrax infection, and roughly 68 confirmed deaths. In October and November of 
2001, the “anthrax letter” attacks targeted U.S. media and Congressional offices 
in Florida, Washington, D.C., and New York, among others. Around eleven cases 
of inhalation anthrax were confirmed, among whom five died. Decontamination 
and treatment alone cost tens of millions. The World Health Organization esti-
mated in 1970 that in the event of an aircraft release of only 50 kg (around 30 lb) 
of dry, weaponized anthrax over a major urban area of 5 million people, 250,000 
would be exposed and 100,000 might be expected to die. A well-known 1993 U.S. 
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) report projected anywhere 
from 130,000 to 3 million deaths in Washington, D.C. in the event of a 100-kg 
aerosolized anthrax release from a private plane flying at night, upwind and under 
proper wind conditions. It noted that such casualty numbers rivaled those of a 
hypothesized hydrogen bomb.

If properly produced—by growing, freeze-drying (lyophilization), milling to 
optimal 1- to 5-micron particles, and treating with an antistatic coating—anthrax 
is a potent bioweapon. Colorless, odorless, and properly weaponized, such anthrax 
spores would float freely on the wind, almost as a gas, and if inhaled by unsuspect-
ing victims, lodge deep in the lung’s alveoli.35 The first sign of infection, unless an 
attack was detected by bioagent detectors, would be patients entering emergency 
rooms with flu-like symptoms, starting around 36 to 48 hours after the attack. But 
the prognosis for symptomatic (those already ill) anthrax victims is very poor, even 
with antibiotic drug treatment and intensive medical support in modern hospi-
tals. The U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of key medicines and supplies is 
capable of flying prophylactic and treatment doses to any major city within twelve 
hours, but distribution to millions of residents in less than two days is extremely 
unlikely, and there is controversy about whether enough doses would be available 
on short notice for such a crash prophylaxis campaign.
Today, most knowledgeable analysts recognize that whatever the current level 
of threat from bioterrorism, the BT technology growth curve is steeper than any 
other known WMD threat. That is, regardless of how significant the current risk, 
future BT risk will eventually surpass other weapons with mass casualty potential 
(see Figure 8.1), largely because technological advances are making it easier to pro-
cess or weaponize an agent, but also to genetically engineer more deadly varieties, 
or even new combinations of pathogens. There has been much ongoing discussion 
about weapons of mass destruction since the attacks on 9/11. Nuclear, biological, 
and chemical weapons are those generally considered to be WMD, in contrast to 
conventional arms. WMD are unique among terrorist weapons in that they are by 
definition terrifying and indiscriminate in whom they target.36
In comparison, nuclear weapons technology and techniques are fairly well 
established, and while the proliferation and availability of fissile material, the larg-
est factor in nuclear terrorism, has the potential to change over time, it is unlikely 
to do so radically, given global efforts to keep it in check. The potential threat from 
chemical weapons is, for the moment, similarly on a flatter curve: major efforts are 
being made to destroy or secure Cold War-era military-grade chemical weapons. 
Even if such weapons were stolen, smuggled, and used, they would never be of 
much use for generating major mass casualties without massive quantities or highly 
technical dissemination methods. Finally, both nuclear and chemical weapons 
technology and materials are far easier to monitor through treaty provisions, export 
controls, and surveillance. Nuclear enrichment facilities are beyond the capability 
of any entity other than a nation-state. Furthermore, the technology, materials, and 
equipment for both nuclear and chemical weapons of any significance are all fairly 
specialized. In contrast, three major differences make biological weaponry stand 
out from other WMD:

162  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
	
1.	The production and processing techniques potentially used for bioweap-
ons are very similar and in many instances virtually identical to those used 
in the pharmaceutical, medical research, gene therapy, and biotechnology 
industries.
	
2.	Much of the equipment used in the aforementioned global industries for pro-
ducing beneficial biological products, drug and gene therapies, etc. can be 
used to mass produce and process biological agents for easier dissemination. 
Many of these technologies are widely available on the open market for phar-
maceutical drug production.
	
3.	Bioweapons are generally more easily concealed than other WMD.
Variables in Using BT Weapons
Whether successfully weaponized for maximal dispersal or spread by the cough or 
touch of an infectious victim, biological weapons provide considerable versatility 
for terrorists and unpredictability for potential targets. Biological weapons present 
a far more complex future terrorism risk than most. Broadly speaking, there are 
several variables that determine the likely success or failure of a biological attack: 
the specific biological agent, the environment in which it is disseminated, and the 
delivery and dissemination methods used. Any of these variables might render an 
attack ineffective; conversely, they might magnify its impact.
Although the sine qua non of any biological weapons attack is the disease-caus-
ing agent or pathogen, not all pathogen species or strains, nor the bioagents they 
are turned into, are equal. Among the CDC’s highest-priority pathogens37 deemed 
most likely to be used or most dangerous are bacterial agents, and the diseases 
they cause: B. anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis 
Figure 8.1  Comparing levels of bioterrorism (BT) risk/threat to nuclear and 
chemical terrorism, over time, given hypothetical technology trajectories.

(tularemia), and C. botulinum toxin (botulism). Threatening viruses include variola 
(smallpox) and numerous viral hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses (including Ebola, 
Marburg, Machupo, Junin, etc).
There are numerous inherent determinates of how effective the biological 
weapon agent might be, or the dynamics of the outbreak that might subsequently 
be caused. One is whether the pathogen and any strains or variations would be an 
effective disease-creating agent; most pathogenic microbes have multiple strains 
or variations. Next is the state and quality of how the agent has been processed, 
including whether it has been “weaponized” for easy dispersal in the air to the 
greatest number of people. As a rule, it is difficult to produce highly weaponized 
dry bioagent but easy to disperse such material, and easier to produce wet agent but 
difficult to aerosolize it for widespread dissemination. Environmental conditions 
are also critical to the success of a bioweapon attack: Aside from anthrax, sunlight 
can degrade the material, rain might literally dampen the impact, and high winds 
or those blowing in the wrong direction can prevent infection of those targeted. 
Alternatively, the interior of an enclosed building presents an ideal dissemination 
environment: cool, dry, with light, widely circulating air flow. Delivery and dissem-
ination methods are particularly important for wet biological agents, necessitating 
very precise equipment for massive aerosolization (though perhaps only a perfume 
atomizer for small scale). Contrary to popular fears, a crop-dusting aircraft would 
have to be modified to present a threat from wet agent. Lastly is the susceptibility 
of the targeted population: If some or all have natural or induced immunity to the 
pathogenic bioagent, or are protected by preventive antibiotics, the attack may be 
less effective or even fail outright, the psychological impact notwithstanding.38
Agricultural Bioterrorism
Biological terrorism may be defined generally as the deliberate use of pathogenic 
(disease-causing) organisms or their byproducts to cause, or threaten to cause, a 
disease outbreak that sickens, kills, intimidates or otherwise sows fear or anxiety 
among people. Nevertheless, bioterrorism agents might be only indirectly targeted 
toward humans, and thus might be used to harm animals, crops, or even inani-
mate objects (see Table 8.1). Although terrorist infection of food crops or animals 
would not necessarily imply human casualties, such an attack could wreak consid-
erable economic and psychological damage, disrupting food supply chains, causing  
massive, broadly disruptive quarantine areas. Just as a global avian flu pandemic could 
disrupt key supply chains, with rapid demand-driven price rises, so too could agricul-
tural bioterrorism. Many crop spores, such as the wheat fungus Puccinia, already a 
destructive commercial crop pathogen, can spread with the wind for over 100 miles. If 
a bioterrorist was to mass produce such funguses, and process them into easily aerosol-
izable form, they could be used to destroy millions of acres of crops in a furtive attack. 
Many other crop disease organisms might be produced and deployed in such ways.

The Comparative Dimensions of

The 2005 Gulf hurricanes, as well as the emergence of avian (H5N1) influenza, 
forced a reexamination among both the American public and policymakers of the 
operational definition and strategies behind homeland security. The question is not 
whether but how catastrophic natural disaster threats such as hurricanes, tsunamis, 
floods, earthquakes, and infectious diseases should be weighed against the risks 
of terrorism in the prevailing political, social, and fiscal environment. Homeland

security must now account for a “new” critical infrastructure, including areas such 
as public health, emergency medical services, and the greater health care system 
in the United States. In these areas, security overlaps with social welfare, but so it 
must be when civilian public goods are at issue.
The Brave New World of Katrina and 
Osama—But With Tradeoffs
Terrorism-related preparation, response, and consequence management will remain 
an indispensable part of securing the overall well-being of the United States, but 
many of the risks posed by nonterrorist threats are great and growing. Some of these 
may exceed terrorism in probability and potential consequences to Americans, as 
well as the increasingly vulnerable, interdependent global economic system. How-
ever one defines “homeland security,” the fact remains that in an era of growing 
risks to the nation and world from both man-made and natural threats, an inte-
grated policy response is necessary, and comparative risk analysis is a central tool 
for assessing the variety of security challenges faced by the nation and the world.
But where does that leave us, now that extreme weather, earthquakes, and 
other natural catastrophes might, at least on paper, constitute “homeland secu-
rity?” Should we assume that DHS has embraced this broader, though arguably ill-
defined, crisis-driven mandate from Congress, the White House, and the American 
people? And if so, are DHS, DHHS and other government entities up to the tasks 
presented by these newly broadened priorities, and can they integrate them into 
the current bureaucratic and governmental security apparatus without major struc-
tural, conceptual, and “cultural” changes?
Considerable barriers remain to such change. The 2005 Gulf hurricanes, with 
their chaotic, troubling implications for disaster preparation and response, and the 
emergence of pandemic influenza, fundamentally changed most Americans’ views 
of U.S. security priorities. Yet that does not mean these altered perspectives trans-
lated into significant changes in mission at DHS or other security-related federal 
agencies. Such institutions continued, as before those events, to illustrate the com-
parative weakness of nontraditional security constituencies compared to traditional 
ones, yet the American public believed that change would happen, and more would 
be done to address the disparity between terrorism and naturally occurring disaster 
countermeasures policy.
In U.S. homeland security strategy and policy, the natural disaster response 
function was and still is secondary, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Secu-
rity until recently still considered itself primarily a security and law-enforcement 
agency.39 Katrina was not unique, however, and potentially far greater globaliza-
tion-related threats will challenge the homeland security paradigm even more. The 
most significant catastrophic nonterrorist threat of all will likely be from microbial 
diseases, including the risk of pandemic influenza. But bureaucratically, there are 

166  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
impediments in the current response system for dealing with catastrophic infec-
tious disease outbreaks.40 Historically, at the political level, terrorism, law enforce-
ment, and traditional security interests have trumped natural threats. This is due to 
long-standing relative bureaucratic/political powerlessness of “low politics” civilian 
social welfare-oriented institutions associated with public health, emergency medi-
cine, and emergency disaster response. The optimal national homeland security 
strategy for addressing both naturally occurring and man-made (terrorist) cata-
strophic risk may be to separate FEMA from DHS, and elevate the former to cabi-
net status in order to let both entities do what they do best, and in order to locate 
governmental capability and policy planning for naturally occurring disasters in a 
place of importance and power within the government bureaucracy.

lethal and highly weaponized—at the right size to cause optimal lethality and treated 
to float freely and easily. Thus, with ideal indoor environmental conditions and an

used to infect dozens and contaminate a large area.

Homeland Security 
Strategy and 
Policy Choices
A Local Government 
Perspective
Greg Moser
Federalism—the division of powers and authority 
among federal, state, county, municipal, and other local 
levels—poses a significant challenge to the making and 
implementation of strategy for homeland security as on 
so many other issues. Getting government departments 
and agencies to work together well is by no means an 
easy task. Having held state and county positions in 
emergency preparedness, the author has first-hand 
experience locally with planning for both natural disas-
ters and man-made events. He is only too well aware of 
the difficulties among different government organiza-
tions and cultures at all levels in the making and imple-
mentation of strategy for securing the homeland.

172  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Long-established ways and means or approaches 
to 
disaster 
preparedness—focusing 
on 
hazards, 
vulnerabilities, and risks—have not been easy to trans-
fer to the domain of counterterrorism. For his part, the 
author favors an all-consequences focus regardless of 
cause as more cost-effective than dissipating limited 
human and material resources on preparations for par-
ticular hazards. Such an all-consequences approach is 
necessarily inclusive of all hazards, but relative empha-
sis is placed on potential outcomes—being prepared 
for all contingencies that can do harm or damage to 
communities or society as a whole.
Federal priorities typically are different from what 
most states and localities prefer to pursue. In this 
regard, the author takes the application of strategy to 
the tactical level of coordinating and directing the work 
of first responders who are so essential a part of the 
strategic effort to secure the homeland. Forging a com-
prehensive and dynamic strategy for homeland security 
depends on reconciling or accommodating alternative 
federal, as well as state and local government and pri-
vate sector perspectives in a nationwide approach to 
the problems at hand.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and catastrophic hurricanes and other 
weather events since provide several lessons that have yet to be integrated fully into 
a comprehensive strategy to make the nation safe from a growing range of hazards 
and disaster consequences. In the rush to adapt to the dangers of international 
terrorism, dramatic organizational and policy process changes were enacted often 
based more on the political need to take action than on a careful and critical analy-
sis of what actions were needed to enhance homeland security.
One result has been the erosion of the federal government’s ability to respond 
to natural disasters, as demonstrated most prominently by the hurricanes of 2005. 
These events have reminded us that natural disasters are also an important part of 
national security. As shown in Figure 9.1, the spectrum of hazards is growing, but 
we are failing to meet these strategic challenges. Prior to 9/11 the threat of terror-
ism was not fully appreciated by the American public, the country’s leaders, or the 
emergency-response community. In the years since 9/11 we have fallen short in the 
effort to integrate strategic planning to prevent, limit the damage from, and manage 
consequences of terrorism with parallel efforts to deal with the dangers of natural 

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  173
disasters and other, more traditional hazards that challenge officials particularly at 
state and local levels.
Constructing a framework that supports an integrated nationwide response is 
essential,1 whether the threat is from the growing number of potential catastrophic 
events or the emergence of dangerous diseases as in an influenza pandemic. Since 
prevention and mitigation or limitation of damages may not always succeed, effec-
tive response and recovery depend on building preparedness in every community 
nationwide.
Hazards are defined broadly here as anything that potentially endangers the 
community or society as a whole. Hazards fall into two broad categories: natural 
and man-made. Historically, natural hazards have been the primary threat to local 
communities. Dealing with these environmental hazards and lesser man-made haz-
ards, such as fires and violent crimes, continues to present the highest probability 
threats at the local level.
As society has developed, man-made hazards have become increasingly potent. 
These man-made hazards fall into two primary categories. First, technical-indus-
trial hazards are a by-product of an increasingly technological world. The second 
category of man-made hazards includes criminal activity, terrorism, and war. Even 
though the scale of a natural disaster may be much larger, the death and destruction 
due to a natural disaster impacts society differently than does death and destruc-
tion caused by a terrorist attack. Although the 2004 tsunamis killed an estimated 
240,000 and led to the initiation of an international effort to establish an Indian 
Ocean warning system,2 the attacks of 9/11 initiated a global asymmetric war that 
will cost trillions of dollars, may last for decades, and could escalate into a much 
broader global conflict. These are clearly very different issues but conceptualization,

strategic thinking, and policy-oriented discussions do not always make the neces-
sary distinctions between either the dangers of natural disaster and terrorism or the 
means by which we respond to these challenges or threats.
Vulnerabilities refer to what is potentially endangered by hazards, includ-
ing people in communities or society as a whole, critical infrastructure and key 
resources (CI/KR), the environment, and both public and non-governmental insti-
tutions. Although this category seems at first glance to be straightforward enough, 
CI/KR have proven in fact to be difficult to identify or specify easily. Each of the 
seventeen CI/KR sectors identified in national strategy documents3 presents unique 
challenges that demand significant, highly specialized expertise that is often lack-
ing in government and can be found only in the private sector. Vulnerabilities and 
the potential consequences associated with them have become fraught with both 
confusion and contention.
Finally, risk is defined as the relation between hazards and vulnerabilities. 
Reducing risk has long been the objective of homeland security efforts. The way in 
which we accomplish this objective, however, has been the source of much confu-
sion, competition, in-fighting, and conflict. This has had the effect of undermining 
what worked before 9/11, while not fully addressing post-9/11 concerns about ter-
rorism. Although both 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina provided examples of how risk 
may have increased, the federal emphasis since 9/11 has been to address terrorism4 
while leaving basic or core public safety preparedness in the traditional hands of 
local and state governments that often have little fiscal flexibility in an environment 
dominated by the practical priorities of day-to-day operations.
The bottom line on hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities is that all three are gradu-
ally increasing over time. This becomes particularly problematic when there is dis-
proportionate focus on a single category of hazards, as was the case prior to both 
9/11 and the hurricanes that came later. For their part, the thousands of local 
governments nationwide that are primarily responsible for funding, building, and 
sustaining the first-responder community rely on federal coordination to provide 
effective nationwide mobilization in response to large-scale disasters or catastrophic 
events. If the next generation of homeland-security efforts is to succeed, they must 
be guided by a comprehensive homeland security strategy that addresses each of 
these concerns
Consequences and Consequence Planning
Consequences have become a measure by which we set priorities in homeland secu-
rity. In practical terms, we seek to prevent or mitigate all hazards. When these 
efforts fail, as they often do, we are faced with addressing consequences. In prac-
tical terms, the following list of generic consequences provides a baseline set of 
objectives for response and recovery efforts. Dealing with these consequences falls 

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  175
first and foremost upon local first responders, governments, and communities. All 
disasters present some combination of most if not all of these consequences:
Dead, injured, displaced people
Dead, injured, displaced animals
Increased health and safety risks
Loss of human and intellectual capital
Endangered, damaged and destroyed property
Loss of essential services
Damaged or loss of critical infrastructure and key resources
Economic losses
Psychological trauma (to both the public and the responders)
Environmental damage
Cascading events or disasters
Litigation
Loss of confidence in public and private institutions
Although this short list of generic consequences can provide a focus for all-hazards 
response and recovery, it is also important to understand that not only does each 
hazard present a unique combination of consequences, but also that terrorism pres-
ents a set of unique consequences that must also be recognized and addressed.
In terms of domestic preparedness, significant media and congressional criticism 
of the traditional formulas used for federal preparedness grant distributions have 
driven the policy shift to consequence- or risk-based preparedness. This empirical 
approach has limitations that may not fully take into account those consequences 
that cannot be measured in simple terms of the numbers of dead, the value of prop-
erty losses, or the loss of critical infrastructure and services. Although this approach 
has its merits, it continues to reflect a mind-set that does not fully account for the 
psychological aspects of terrorist attacks and the consequences terrorism has on 
domestic and national security policies.
Under this policy of prioritizing CI/KR and homeland security efforts based 
on analysis of potential consequences, only major attack scenarios are seen as a 
national priority. This disproportionate focus has now been extended to measur-
ing local response-and-recovery preparedness for terrorist attacks using weapons of 
mass destruction, neglecting preparedness for much smaller and less exotic attacks, 
as well as the general preparedness needed for traditional hazards. In this regard, a 
single suicide bomber or attacks on the scale of the bombings in Madrid and Lon-
don would drive policy consequences far beyond the loss of life or actual damage 
to critical infrastructure.
The consequences of terrorist attacks have more in common with warfare than 
they do with any other disaster. As with warfare, the strategic decisions translate 
into tactical realities and consequences at the local level. The tactical consequences 
outlined above do not define the limits of the consequences of terrorism. Once the

bleeding stops and the fires are put out by local first responders, the longer-term 
systemic consequences of terrorism insert themselves into all levels of local, state, 
and national efforts.
The following is a short list of strategic terrorism-specific consequences that 
often have impacts disproportionate to the actual physical damage produced by 
these attacks:
A demand or expectation for apprehension, prosecution, and punishment
A demand or expectation of accountability from those entrusted with the 
security of fellow citizens, property, and way of life
An on-going sense of dread regarding possible future attacks
Increased policy and fiscal emphasis on intelligence, military, law-enforce-
ment and first-responder operations related to terrorism and weapons of mass 
destruction
Decreased policy emphasis on social, political, economic, and informational 
engagement of on-going or underlying issues exploited by domestic and inter-
national terrorist organizations
Challenges to traditional norms of civil liberties, due process and rule of law, 
constitutional conventions, and fiscally responsible government
Demand for structural and mission changes within intelligence, military, 
law-enforcement and first-responder agencies
De-emphasis on traditional intelligence, military, law-enforcement and first-
response missions
Loss of organizational or operational capabilities during reorganization 
efforts
Unfulfilled promises of justice and infallible prevention of future attacks
Policy frustration
Increased social stress that often manifests itself in hate crimes and other 
forms of racially motivated violence.
Terrorism thus has the unique capacity of having a strategic impact on all levels of 
response, government, and society.
Of note, both pre-9/11 planning guidance and current federal guidelines on 
response-and-recovery planning continue to be largely focused on hazard-based 
planning, not consequence-based planning. This is an important distinction that 
can detract from the objective of disaster and catastrophe response-and-recovery 
planning. By emphasizing hazards over consequences, we can spend an inordinate 
amount of time on the details of specific hazards and not enough time and effort on 
the core elements of consequences management needed for a solid, basic response-
and-recovery effort. Response-and-recovery planning is not about dealing with spe-
cific hazards; that opportunity has passed once the event has occurred. The goal of 
response-and-recovery planning is dealing with consequences. A solid all-hazards

or all-consequences basic plan, then, is the foundation of all effective response-and-
recovery planning efforts.
Indeed, the National Strategy for Homeland Security defines homeland security 
as “a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, 
reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recovery 
from attacks that do occur.” Despite subsequent acknowledgment of the need for an 
all-hazards approach, this definition still dominates the national strategy and the 
mind-set of national agencies to the detriment of a truly all-hazards or all-conse-
quences national strategy. The current “consequence and risk”-based planning (see 
Figure 9.2) advocated by a DHS driven by its terrorism-prevention mission and 
culture, has resulted in an all too narrow concept of the hazards and risks facing 
communities. Within the counter- or antiterrorism-dominated culture of DHS, 
risk and consequences have also become an argument to reduce the role of the 
federal government in funding state and local homeland security efforts by seeking 
to set priorities based on expected terrorist targeting of critical infrastructure and 
key resources. On the surface, this is an intuitive and logical argument; however, in 
practice it is too narrow and also fails to recognize that terrorist target selection is 
tied to motivations, resources, capabilities, and the strategic consequences or goals 
of both violent domestic and international extremist organizations.
Regarding the effort to use risk- or consequence-based planning, both the 9/11 
(and subsequent) commissions and the media have been highly critical of the dis-
tribution of homeland security grant funds. The traditional formula-based model 
for federal grant distribution guaranteed each state a minimum amount of grant 
funds;5 the remaining funds were distributed in proportion to population size and 
a competitive process of risk analysis. Even so, the result has been a frequently cited 
distribution of funds in which low-population states have received a disproportion-
Figure 9.2  Risk/Consequence Reduction

178  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
ate per capita allocation while cities and states with large populations have received 
a lower per capita share. Nevertheless, the vast majority of homeland security grants 
funds in fact go to the large population centers most commonly cited as the likely 
targets of terrorist attacks.6 It does not address the demographic realities of first-
responder communities or the need to build national response capacity and reserves 
to support a nationwide mobilization in response to catastrophic natural events as 
well as terrorist attacks.7
Unlike any other hazard, terrorism is a deliberate, criminal-attack process. The 
ways, means and ends of the perpetrators largely define and limit this process. It is 
also important to remember terrorism is often a “farm to market” process in which 
the attack preparations may take place in various locations that have no relation to 
the location of the target.
The attacks on 9/11 were planned and prepared in various communities all 
over the United States and the rest of the world. There was little New York City 
or Arlington, Virginia could have done to prevent an attack using a commercial 
aircraft. Although improved CI/KR protection would have potentially defeated or 
mitigated the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, it is doubtful 
Timothy McVeigh, the principal perpetrator, would have sought an alternate target. 
Again, we must remember terrorism is a phenomenon conducted through a global 
network resulting in a wide range of tactical and strategic consequences involv-
ing all levels of response, government and societal. Indeed, terrorism prevention 
and preparedness require a cooperative national effort, not a competitive scramble 
focused on a limited set of assumed targets. Prevention depends on a coordinated 
national and global effort to detect and target every element of the attack process, 
regardless of the size or location of the community in which the elements of this 
process are being developed.
Prevention, Mitigation, and Preparedness
The language of domestic protective efforts has evolved significantly as perceptions 
of the threat have shifted over the years. In the years leading up to the attacks of 
9/11, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had taken the lead in 
creating the framework of preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery that 
forms much of the basis of the present-day Department of Homeland Security. 
If FEMA can be faulted for any single failure, it was its institutional tendency to 
think of terrorism as “hazmat [or hazardous materials] with an attitude.”8 Although 
this cliché captures some aspects of the dangers presented by weapons of mass 
destruction, it minimizes many of the consequences that are unique to terrorism.
The mission and strategies of FEMA had evolved significantly since its creation 
in 1979.9 By 2001, it had evolved into an increasingly integrated national effort to 
lessen the impacts of natural disasters through mitigation and preparedness for the  
consequences of all hazards. The goal of prevention, mitigation, preparedness, 

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  179
response, and recovery is to reduce risk and minimize losses. One of the greatest 
accomplishments and assets of FEMA was the network of state and local relation-
ships it built through its regional offices and their involvement in mitigation, pre-
paredness, response, and recovery efforts. This network of partnerships is invaluable 
when it is in place and irreplaceably when it fails, as it did in the wake of Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita. The declining effectiveness of FEMA since 9/11 is in no small 
part due to the failure to distinguish and preserve its all-hazards mitigation, pre-
paredness, response-and-recovery mission from the very different primary mission 
of DHS to prevent terrorist attacks.
The methodologies of terrorism prevention are vastly different from the mitiga-
tion of natural hazards. Mitigation of natural hazards is primarily the responsibility 
of emergency management, planning, zoning, engineering, and property own-
ers. The prevention of terrorism is primarily the responsibility of intelligence, law 
enforcement, border and port security, immigration and customs, and other secu-
rity-related functions. Based on this primary mission, many of the various federal 
agencies with roles related to port and border security, immigration and customs 
were combined to form the bulk of the Department of Homeland Security.10
Having already noted FEMA’s pre-9/11 failure to address prevention of ter-
rorism, the post-9/11 efforts of the Department of Homeland Security must also 
be faulted for failing to address anything other than the tactical aspects of ter-
rorism prevention. Mitigating natural hazards requires very specific strategies and 
long-term local, state, federal, and private-sector commitments. The strategies of 
preventing a terrorist attack require a very different set of agencies, resources, and 
strategies. The lessons of 2001 and hurricane disasters since make clear that to 
sacrifice one set of capabilities for another is perhaps penny wise, but certainly a 
pound-foolish approach. We cannot afford to neglect a comprehensive strategy of 
preventing terrorist attacks, mitigating natural hazards, and creating a nationwide 
response network capable of rapidly implementing effective all-consequences man-
agement efforts in response to any scale disaster, including such broad-area catas-
trophes as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Capacity to perform this task will be dependent on the following factors:
A clear and focused mission statement that also specifies authorities to act
Leadership and accountability to maintain focus on the mission
Consistent and adequate funding for staffing, equipment, planning, training, 
preparedness, and operations
Staffing in the right numbers and skill sets to accomplish the mission
Equipment that is appropriate to the duties of the staff and the focus of the 
mission
Procedures to ensure the effective integration of mission, staffing, and 
equipment
Training and planning that tie all these requirements into a functional capa-
bility to act

Exercises and evaluation in support of continued development and program 
validation
Since 9/11, the United States has had what are reasonably assumed to be numer-
ous successes in preventing terrorist attacks. This is not true for the mitigation of 
natural hazards. Had the levees around New Orleans been sufficiently improved 
to prevent the flooding that occurred, the human, economic, and political conse-
quences of the hurricane would have been greatly reduced. Neither the probability 
of terrorist attacks prior to 9/11 nor the catastrophe that befell the Gulf Coast was 
unexpected. Indeed, the ambiguity prior to an event and the resistance to action 
it can create is at least as powerful as the clarity and the demand for action that 
emerges immediately after the event. Preparedness for mitigation by taking prepa-
ratory measures in advance has eroded dramatically in the post-9/11 world. It is yet 
to be seen if Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were sufficient to reinvigorate mitigation 
or damage limitation as a national priority.
Preparedness for response and recovery thus would seem to be a rather straight-
forward enterprise, but even this element of strategy has been the topic of a great 
deal of contention regarding the focus and responsibilities for such efforts. Fol-
lowing the 9/11 attacks the federal government initiated a dramatic expansion in 
funding to these local agencies—the overall aim of these efforts being to build a 
response-and-recovery capacity for terrorist attacks, particularly those using weap-
ons of mass destruction. This focus has also ignited a heated national debate about 
how funds for first-responder preparedness are distributed in response to basic stra-
tegic-planning questions: “For what are we preparing, who is responsible, what is 
the desired end-state, and how do we measure progress?”
An often-overlooked aspect of homeland security preparedness has been the 
dramatic shift in federal involvement in first-responder funding since 9/11. Histori-
cally, the bulk of funding for fire, police, and emergency medical services (EMS) 
was provided by the approximately 87,000 local governments11 and funded by local 
taxes. Preparedness of fire, police, EMS, public health and environment, public 
works, and volunteer service organizations was primarily the fiscal and legal respon-
sibility of the thousands of state, municipal, and special district authorities that 
make up local government. This largely self-regulated system produced a highly 
fragmented national first-response community that was oriented toward local risk 
factors and funded according to local priorities. In the years immediately before 
9/11, there was a growing recognition of the limitations this lack of standards in 
local response capacity had created. Although first responders continue to respond 
effectively to most routine emergencies and many traditional disaster events, effec-
tive response to large-scale disasters is dependent on the ability to mobilize nation-
wide mutual aid.

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  181
In principle this is a practical solution to meeting an historically rare need. In 
terms of preparedness for response to worst-case scenarios, this national network 
may not have sufficient staffing, equipment, procedures, or training. According to 
the National Fire Protection Association, in 2004 of some 1,100,750 fire fighters 
in the United States, 305,150 were career personnel and 795,600 were volunteers. 
Seventy-five percent of career fire fighters are in communities of 25,000 or more. 
Ninety-five percent of volunteers are in departments that protect populations of less 
than 25,000. More than fifty percent are in rural departments that protect popula-
tions of 2,500 or less.12
Law enforcement—another core first-responder function—is primarily staffed 
by paid personnel. There are currently approximately 800,000 sworn officers serving 
in over 35,000 agencies.13 This staffing structure is designed primarily for routine 
operations and limited disaster events. Local law enforcement does have a limited 
surge capability, but sustaining this capacity during prolonged disaster events is 
problematic. Although the national fire and law enforcement staffing structures are 
adequate for most traditional contingencies, there is strategic need to maximize the 
overall capacity of these important albeit limited human resources.
Beyond law enforcement, emergency medical services, emergency management, 
and various other services will almost certainly face similar constraints. The overall 
capacity of the hoped-for national network of first-responder mutual aid will be 
defined by human and material resources. The final safety net for the network of 
national response also depends, of course, on the National Guard, the Department 
of Defense and other federal agencies, both church-affiliated and secular service 
and volunteer organizations, private-sector firms, and individual citizens.
Financing and Staffing State and Local 
Homeland Security Efforts
Current staffing reflects predominantly local perceptions of risk, need, and fund-
ing priorities. A consequence of these traditional local government priorities is that 
almost seventy-five percent of fire fighters are volunteers and most of these are 
in small or rural departments. The bulk of fire-fighting personnel resources is in 
communities that are unlikely to be targeted by international terrorism and the 
consequences to CI/KR or the population would be minimal (although substan-
tial amounts of CI/KR are in low-population areas). An additional challenge is 
the difficulty volunteer organizations can experience in absorbing significant addi-
tional equipment, training, and technical skills. This absorption of resources often 
requires substantial investment in precious personnel hours. In the case of volun-
teers, this translates to additional time away from work or family.
Staffing clearly is the single greatest limiting factor in homeland-security plan-
ning. This factor dictates both the numbers available to support prevention, miti-

182  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
gation, response-and-recovery operations and the amount of training, equipment, 
and resources that can be absorbed to improve overall preparedness. Volunteers are 
and will continue to be a critical element of response capacity. But, until we assess 
the limitations imposed by this current staffing structure, we will have neither a 
clear picture of the national response capacity nor a defined benchmark to measure 
the amount of investment needed to maximize the effectiveness of these human 
resources.
The original federal HLS grants in 2003 of over $3.5 billion marked a ten-
fold increase in federal funding for first-responder equipment, planning, training, 
and exercises at the state and local levels. This level of federal investment in state 
and local first-responder preparedness gradually declined by about a half to some 
$1.7 billion in the FY2006 grant programs. The federal justification for the initial 
increase was twofold: (1) public demand for demonstrable investments to make the 
nation better prepared for terrorist attacks, particularly attacks by weapons of mass 
destruction, and (2) recognition that terrorism is a national security threat and 
therefore a funding responsibility of the federal government. The increase in federal 
funding for local first responders was politically expedient and it has significantly 
benefited these agencies across the nation. In the absence of a defined and sustain-
able “desired end-state,” however, it also has created the perception at the state and 
local levels of a federal fiscal responsibility that did not previously exist and may not 
be sustainable in the long term. Reduced federal funding for these programs is due 
to fiscal constraints in the federal budget and continued frustration with state and 
local management of funds provided. Increasingly these programs have become fis-
cal and political liabilities due to the lack or absence of (1) a well-defined, desired 
end-state; (2) attainable and sustainable standards; (3) clear, accepted measures of 
success; and (4) practical means by which any standards can be enforced. Clearly, 
the pendulum of federal funding has begun to swing back to a traditional, limited 
role in state and local first response funding.
The need for clear goals has been recognized in Homeland Security, Presiden-
tial Directive – 8 (HSPD-8). As a result of this directive, the National Preparedness 
Guideline, Universal Task List and Target Capabilities List have been established. 
These first-generation documents reflect an awareness of the need for clear national 
goals and standards and a commitment to providing them.
The tradition of locally funded fire, law enforcement, and emergency manage-
ment personnel is the result of more than two centuries of federalism and local 
government responsibility and control over these functions. Basic capacity of these 
agencies is almost entirely a function of local funding capabilities and priorities. 
They continue to provide heroic response to local emergencies and disaster events, 
but their ability to be integrated into a national response structure is limited by the 
lack of common equipment, communications, and procedures. Although Home-
land Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) 5 and 8 mandate compliance with 
unprecedented national standards in order to remain eligible for federal grant dol-
lars, these directives do not address the single greatest limiting factor of response-

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  183
and-recovery preparedness: staffing and basic funding and sustainment. These 
remain the responsibility of local government.
Increasingly the answer to the question of “who is responsible for funding first 
responders?” seems to be that it is a shared responsibility but one borne primarily 
by local government, which is responsible for staffing, benefits, and basic capa-
bilities. For its part, the federal government funds additional equipment, training, 
planning, and exercises needed to prepare these local resources for integration into 
national response-and-recovery efforts with emphasis on dealing with a wide range 
of exotic terrorist attacks using weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, this 
federal focus on hazards rather than consequences effectively detracts from the 
overall goal of national preparedness and national response.
The final result of federal policy statements and funding initiatives is an incon-
sistent message with mixed results. HSPD-5 and HSPD-814 require regional 
approaches, mutual aid, and standardization. The “consequence-based” decisions 
and priorities of DHS and Congress send the message that most communities will 
be increasingly noncompetitive for the shrinking homeland security grant pro-
grams. Although the principles for standardized National Incident Management 
Systems15 as described in the presidential directives are a valuable step toward an 
unprecedented level of national coordination of first responders, they are quickly 
becoming yet another in a long line of unfunded mandates that will limit dramati-
cally the potential of these efforts.
Underlying these trends is a growing pressure to reduce the federal burden in 
what has traditionally been a local government responsibility. At the core of this 
issue is not only who pays, but also how we define the desired end-state. Indeed, 
establishing this benchmark has been one of the most elusive goals of homeland 
security efforts. One possible approach to resolving this benchmark problem is to 
base future spending levels on the costs of day-to-day locally funded staffing quite 
apart from costs associated with the consequences of an anticipated event.
The use of personnel costs as the basic preparedness benchmark offers a de 
facto baseline upon which equipment, planning, and training goals can be defined. 
Rather than basing preparedness goals on an ever-expanding list of desired capa-
bilities, by tying preparedness goals to staffing we begin to base funding decisions 
on hard fiscal realities at the local level where first-responder staffing is based on 
locally assessed risk (and the degree of risk the community is willing to accept), 
local tax priorities, and capabilities. These factors are relatively stable, although it 
could be argued that they do not necessarily result in appropriate or correct local 
funding decisions.
Using the baseline of local first-responder staffing, we can define attainable end-
states for equipment, planning, training, and exercises. An additional benefit of this 
shift in policy focus would be to move away from a competitive grant process to a 
system that encourages building capacity throughout the nationwide responder com-
munity. Communities with large response forces would receive funding proportionate 
to their staffing while smaller communities would also benefit. By building capacity 

184  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
throughout the responder community, we make all communities safer and build a 
strategic national reserve that also can be mobilized during both regional and national 
disasters.
Organizing and Coordinating Federal, 
State, and Local Efforts
The competition between communities most likely to be targeted by terrorists 
and the broader need for national, all-hazards preparedness is further complicated 
by the competition of the various first-responder organizations, as well as dispute 
over the relative priority of various homeland security missions. Although the first-
responder communities are all committed to the common goal of protecting the 
public, they have very different missions, means, and cultures for doing so. The 
resulting competition among these organizations is similar to the rivalry among 
the military services.
As a federal bureaucracy, however, the Department of Defense has the statu-
tory and fiscal authority required to meld the various services and their cultures 
into a force capable of supporting operational commanders around the world. 
By contrast, no such structure or authority exists for the Department of Home-
land Security, much less for the first-responder communities. The task of building 
national preparedness among these diverse units is further complicated by the fact 
that unlike the military, first responders do not have a cycle of preparedness and 
deployment. The first-responder community is almost constantly engaged within 
its own “battle space.” These distinctions are noteworthy because of the significant 
amount of cross flow between the military and first-response communities and the 
tendency to attempt to apply military organizational concepts to disaster prepared-
ness response and recovery.
Although there are many concepts that can be effectively adapted from the 
military, the Incident Command System in Figure 9.3 being a case in point, we 
must be mindful of the organizational realities of the civilian first-response com-
munity. In addition to the challenges of unique mission cultures and the need to 
preserve mission integrity, another consequence of federalism is the organizational 
challenges of working with diverse peer-based networks in which coordination and 
control is more the practice than the command and control style one finds in mili-
tary settings. Clear lines of authority are critical, of course, in tactical situations 
involving public safety. It is equally important to understand the need for peer-
based networks, depicted in Figure 9.4, and unified command structures capable 
of coordinating efforts at the operational and strategic levels where there may not 
be a clear chain of command or single overriding authority.
The independence of diverse agencies and jurisdictions is a reality that must 
be accommodated in preparedness prevention, mitigation response-and-recovery 

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  185
efforts. Although the concepts of unified command and multiagency coordination 
have been well developed by the wildfire community over more than three decades, 
they have not been integrated effectively into multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional 
operations nationwide. The result is a significant conceptual and organizational 
gap in ability to coordinate large-scale response to disaster events impacting broad 
geographical areas. This is a reality that is often overlooked by decision makers at 
all levels of government. The concepts and solutions needed to address this problem 
exist, but institutionalizing them into disaster-event response remains a daunting 
challenge.
Another area of competition within homeland security is that between terror-
ism prevention and all-hazards preparedness. The 9/11 attacks were highlighted by

a failure at the national level to prevent terrorist attacks. Response to these attacks, 
however, was an overall success. Warnings of the dangers of major hurricanes were 
well known prior to their occurrence—warnings and available courses of action 
known at all levels of government and society. Whether due to a lack of political 
will or a casual acceptance of the risks involved, options to mitigate this danger 
were not acted upon beforehand.
Be that as it may, the experience of Hurricane Katrina offers very different lessons 
in the failure to respond and recover effectively. As catastrophic as the attacks on 
9/11 were, the area impacted was significantly smaller than the 90,000 square miles 
devastated by hurricanes in 2005. Although terrorist attacks and hurricanes are 
two very different hazards, they produced many of the same consequences, except 
for noticeable differences in policy and political fallout. 9/11 drove a surge in public 
support for the Bush administration, a dramatic restructuring of government, and 
a significant debate over the balance between civil liberties and security. By con-
trast, Katrina significantly damaged public confidence in the Bush administration, 
but has yet to produce significant policy changes. In this regard, the Department of 
Homeland Security remains dominated by its primary mission of terrorism preven-
tion and the cultures and disciplines primarily associated with that objective. Strik-
ing an appropriate balance between these antiterrorist and natural disaster missions 
will remain a difficult and ongoing challenge to the leadership of the Department 
of Homeland Security in relations with state and local authorities.
Concluding Comments
As is clear from the preceding discussion, one of the greatest challenges to dealing 
with consequences when disasters and catastrophic events occur continues to be the 
organizational gap that exists between local, state, and federal agencies. Although 
the national wildfire community has worked aggressively to address this issue over 
the past thirty years, many of the practices they have developed within the Inci-
dent Command System have not been effectively adopted by those outside the 
wildfire community. Local public safety is still a very complex jurisdictional issue 
for many communities. Although the National Incident Management System and 
Incident Command System provide guidelines for addressing this organizational 
gap, the demands of day-to-day operations will continue to hinder the ability to 
institutionalize these concepts nationwide. Historically, hurricanes, earthquakes, 
floods, and wildfires have been the only disasters that required the integration of 
hundreds of response agencies under a unified command structure. The wildfire 
community and FEMA have had the greatest experience and success with this 
concept. Implementation becomes more difficult in heavily populated areas where 
jurisdictional and organizational roles and responsibilities are more closely tied to 
local governments and the geographic area and constituencies upon which they are 
based. This legacy of federalism is a major stumbling block to the implementation 

Homeland Security Strategy and Policy Choices  n  187
of multiagency, multijurisdictional, and multidisciplinary response and recovery 
increasingly required in the wake of large disasters and catastrophic events. It also 
assumes that all future events will be geographically limited, thus allowing assis-
tance from unaffected communities. In the case of the pandemic flu, this may not 
be the case. 
A final stumbling block to creating an integrated homeland security structure is 
organizational culture. Mission drives the culture of an organization. Different mis-
sions attract different types of people. In the wake of 9/11 the overriding mission of 
the Department of Homeland Security has been the prevention of terrorist attacks. 
This is a critical mission that falls primarily to the disciplines of intelligence, law 
enforcement, the military, and immigration and customs officials. When DHS was 
created it sought to integrate the vastly different missions of terrorism prevention 
and all-hazards preparedness and consequence management.
The divergence of missions was further exacerbated by the disproportionate 
demographics of an organization in which the preparedness, response, and recovery 
element (FEMA) made up only 2,500 people—about one percent of the 220,000 
members of the organization. This issue is not unique to DHS, of course. The 
Department of Defense has struggled with a similar challenge to its efforts to create 
an interoperable military force capable of joint military operations.
The military has found ways to overcome these problems for the most part, 
but it has required sustained multigenerational leadership and commitment by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Congress and the military services to unifying doctrine on the 
use of force. By contrast, the bulk of operational field forces in homeland security 
are the thousands of independent response agencies in local communities across 
the nation. Although federal funding and direction increased dramatically after 
9/11, the bulk of funding, policy, and leadership remain the responsibility of local 
governments and state authorities.
Overcoming these issues and balancing the integration of these diverse mis-
sions and cultures are essential for the future success of these efforts to secure the 
homeland. We cannot afford to sacrifice one mission for the other. We must create 
a truly integrated culture of homeland security that minimizes the possibilities of 
repeating the failures that led to 9/11 and both preceded and followed Hurricane 
Katrina.
After all, terrorism is just one of the many risk factors with which we must 
contend as we seek to make communities safer and better prepared. From the early 
days of militia and fire brigades to civil defense, FEMA and now DHS, domestic 
security and preparedness has had to adapt to changes in both the risk environment 
and societal expectations. 9/11 drove us to make dramatic changes in all levels of 
preparedness, mitigation, prevention, response, and recovery. These policy deci-
sions have not always had the desired result and we will be living with the conse-
quences for many years to come. Many of the lessons and legacies of the past were 
lost or forgotten. 9/11 and now Katrina continue to drive the evolution of concepts 
of domestic preparedness. It is increasingly clear that the next generation must 

188  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
build on these legacies without being confined by them. We must seek to prevent 
terrorist attacks, mitigate natural disasters, and be prepared to deal with the con-
sequences of any disaster. Any and all communities must be able both to respond 
and to render mutual aid nationwide. The next generation of domestic preparedness 
must be based on a commitment to build a network that fully integrates the many 
agencies needed to make the homeland secure from all disasters.

Chapter 10
Democracy, Civil 
Society, and the 
Damage-Limitation 
Component of Strategy
Alexander C. Diener and Timothy W. Crawford
Going beyond prevention measures, the authors focus 
on the ways and means to limit damage to political insti-
tutions, critical infrastructure, and other targets of value 
in American society. Finding ways to sustain govern-
mental functioning is essential. With respect to critical 
infrastructure, particular attention needs to be given to 
aircraft, nuclear power plants, and chemical processing 
plants that can in effect be “weaponized” by terror-
ists—using them to attack (aircraft) or attacking them 
(nuclear or chemical plants) to wreak further damage 
on society. Establishing as much redundancy and sub-
stitutability as feasible in effect puts back-up assets in 
place should critical infrastructure be attacked. Inter-
governmental and private-sector cooperation is essen-
tial as we prepare strategically to limit damage and 
respond to all hazards. Finally, civil-defense education 
can empower the population to help themselves and 
thus limit damage if or when attacks occur.

192  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The threat of mass-casualty attacks by terrorists is unique in American history 
and has encouraged a concerted effort to address these dangers. U.S. policymakers 
urgently need to create a homeland security strategy that focuses on limiting the 
damage of terrorism, rather than merely seeking to prevent catastrophic terrorism. 
In doing so, we raise some fundamentally important issues concerning the role of 
democratic institutions, the political process, and civil society in the United States. 
The parochial nature of Congress in setting spending priorities for homeland secu-
rity does not always lead to damage-limitation measures desirable from a national 
standpoint. Measures to limit damage may impose dangerous distortions in the 
balances of power and responsibility among local, state, and federal authorities, 
and, at the federal level, between the executive and legislative branches, and within 
the legislative branch itself. Similarly, before and after attacks occur, damage limi-
tation and emergency-response measures may produce perverse shifts in relations 
between government and the diverse groups in civil society.
When constructing a homeland security strategy, it is readily apparent that 
any approach that ignores the domestic political context is doomed to fail. Indeed, 
remarkably little focus has been given in homeland security strategizing to the polit-
ical modalities of U.S. democracy and the impact on civic culture. The purpose of 
this chapter is to begin to explore a few important links between the larger contours 
of democratic government and state-civil society relations, and problems forming 
and implementing damage-limitation policies in homeland security strategy.
We begin with a discussion of the need to sustain a central role for the popular 
voice in government responses through active congressional involvement in the 
aftermath of a catastrophic attack on the capital. The United States was founded on 
principles of separation of power and checks and balances. Accordingly, the pres-
ervation of federalism in practice and the constructive tension among the execu-
tive, judicial, and legislative branches is an essential damage-limitation mission 
that must be central to any U.S. strategy on homeland security.1 Next, we explore 
the role of Congress in shaping homeland security strategy priorities and fund-
ing, especially in relation to the creation of effective damage-limitation capabilities. 
Finally, we discuss how damage-limitation capacities can be improved by doing 
more to integrate civil society with homeland security planning and preparations. 
In particular, we recommend greater commitment to civil-defense education and 
other programs aiming to capitalize on U.S. civic strengths that will have applica-
bility in an “all-hazards” context.
Making Democracy Survivable
A major terrorist attack may impose enormous costs not just by the immediate 
destruction of lives and property, but also by disabling normal governing institu-
tions and political processes, thus compromising the links between the governed 
and the government. These core links of the democratic process are threatened 

	
Democracy, Civil Society, and the Damage-Limitation Component  n  193
primarily when the public perception of the balance between safety and danger 
lurches toward the latter.2 The costs may be difficult to quantify, but any disrup-
tion of balanced democratic government is harmful. By such a multiplier effect, the 
less tangible political costs of a catastrophic attack on organs of government can 
be huge. Thus, adopting stronger measures to ensure the continuity of democratic 
government after an attack must rank as a top priority in formulating homeland 
security strategy. Unfortunately, perhaps because the stakes are less tangible and 
tend not to generate strong political demands, major progress is still lacking.
It is imperative to maintain the constructive tension among the three federal 
branches and the distribution of their overlapping responsibilities in the wake of 
a catastrophic attack or indeed a sequence of them.3 Well-established procedures 
for quickly reconstituting authority in the executive and judicial branches already 
exist. So there is less need to alter significantly the existing formulas for these 
branches.4 By contrast, in the wake of a broadly debilitating attack, mechanisms 
for preserving the continuity of Congress, which tends already to be a reactive 
institution during emergencies, are “the biggest hole in our Constitutional sys-
tem.”5 Although the Senate is better positioned to fill its ranks quickly through the 
process of gubernatorial appointment, it can be paralyzed by mass incapacitation of 
its members. The situation is especially dangerous for the House of Representatives, 
lacking any mechanism for quickly regenerating itself to sustain its representative 
function.6 Failing to address these vulnerabilities means that an adversary can tar-
get the House in particular, and essentially cast the U.S. government into a pattern 
of emergency war-time rule heavily dominated by the executive branch and its 
political appointees.7
Since the House is so broadly representative a national institution, it would 
provide an especially tempting target for terrorists. In addition, maintaining exist-
ing proportions of power among the branches is the best guarantee of civil liberties, 
for the gravest incursions on civil liberties will not arise from excessive zeal in 
the executive branch alone, but from the paralysis of counteracting congressional 
influence in the face of such zeal.8 This vulnerability can only truly be rectified by 
House legislative action, but so far the efforts at reform have been minimal at best. 
As congressional observer Norman Ornstein, a leading expert on continuity of gov-
ernment legislation, said the House’s 2004 effort boiled down to a poorly drafted, 
poorly constructed bill simply to expedite special elections in the event of the death 
of a large number of Members, with no constitutional plan to deal with the possi-
bility of widespread incapacitation,” also adding, “a blatantly unconstitutional and 
partisan rule to allow the Speaker to redefine the meaning of ‘quorum.’”9
The Senate blocked passage of the House bill, and the matter remains at a stand-
still. It is unlikely to be resolved without another attack to galvanize the necessary 
consensus and political will. In the interim the House has neither a legitimate sys-
tem in place to expedite elections after mass vacancies have been created nor a plan 
for continuing to do business in the event many members are incapacitated and 
before such vacancies can be filled.

194  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Ultimately, such fixes can only be produced and implemented through the 
existing political process. The problem of continuity of government poses a fun-
damental challenge for creating a damage-limitation strategy for democracy: the 
most important aspects defy abstract solutions. The unique permutations of popu-
lar government in the United States help to define the strategic problem as well as 
possible solutions. Consider, for example, the vulnerability to terrorist action cre-
ated by presidential election cycles and the dramatic thinning of policy ranks when 
government changes hands. The depth and breadth of these transitions are testa-
ment to the effectiveness of democratic institutions, but nevertheless they routinely 
create an environment in which the executive branch’s focus is often sidetracked, 
expertise on pressing issues drops, and the ability to react to developing challenges 
is blunted. However dangerous these vulnerabilities may be, they cannot be “fixed” 
within the existing political system for the essence of that system is the reliable 
promise of periodic government turnover.
Homeland Security Spending and Damage Limitation
As we have seen, protecting the institutions of government is an essential task in 
homeland security. Because of their openness, democratic societies have a daunt-
ing task defending against a determined foe bent on creating havoc in the country. 
How the United States is able to limit damage in the event of an attack is a function 
of how prepared it is for such an outcome. Mitigating damage means choices have 
to be made as to what most urgently needs protection. How and where the United 
States spends its precious capital is a critical determinant of whether its homeland 
security strategy as a whole will succeed or fail.
Two of the basic impediments to the formulation of strategy are analytical as well 
as political: how to judge and prioritize the most vulnerable of the many exposed 
flanks and how to measure progress in our efforts to better defend them?10 The 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created to overcome these problems 
by providing “the unifying core for the vast national network of organizations and 
institutions involved in efforts to secure” the country.11 More concretely, DHS is to 
be the coordinator of efforts to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, 
and to minimize damage and maximize recovery from attacks that do occur. If one 
includes the spending of other agencies involved in such efforts, expenditures on 
homeland security represents one of the largest and most rapid allocations of federal 
funding in the history of the United States.12 Strong criticisms have been leveled, 
however, at the methods and processes used to formulate and implement homeland 
security strategy.
In DHS’s initial efforts, the threat was treated as something more like a serial 
killer that had to be stopped than a virus requiring a re-evaluation of systemic 
vulnerabilities and resiliencies.13 Yet given the wide range of targets for such terror-
ism, resources must also be mobilized and allocated in ways that try to minimize 

	
Democracy, Civil Society, and the Damage-Limitation Component  n  195
the impact of such attacks when they occur,14 that is, in ways that are consistent 
with the logic of “hazards management” and a risk-assessment-based strategy.15 To 
that end, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 gives DHS the lead role in 
rationalizing the funding of homeland security priorities and establishing a set of 
minimum essential response capabilities for every U.S. community. A DHS-led 
risk assessment to support this objective is currently underway, and will ultimately 
produce a comprehensive threat-vulnerability matrix and federal terrorism pre-
paredness standards likely to be completed in 2008.16
Meanwhile, resources for damage limitation and other dimensions of homeland 
security will be allocated in ways that diverge markedly from nationwide risk-based 
priorities and instead reflect more parochial interests and disparate agendas.17 For-
mer Representative Christopher Cox illustrated the predicament by noting: “It is at 
the intersection of threat and vulnerability that our money should be directed [but] 
right now we are using seat-of-the-pants analysis” to determine the distribution 
of resources.18 But so long as strategic confusion and “seat of the pants” analysis 
predominate, parochial politics will drive resource allocations even more than they 
normally do.19 Hence, as former Senator Don Nickles noted: “Under the banner 
of homeland security,” Congress has created programs that have more or less been 
used as “revenue sharing” by cities and states.20 In other words, the analytical and 
political problems are partly related, for the absence of a strategic framework at 
the national level invites expenditures that “appear to be for a purpose other than 
security against an act of terrorism.”21
A risk-assessment approach to homeland security spending must entail a com-
mitment to thinking rigorously about how to determine the important priorities, 
because even sound general strategic concepts will not “spit-out” solutions to such 
matters. Such is the case for the underspecified concept of critical infrastructure 
(CI), essential to damage-limitation strategy. Because it lacks specificity, it has 
tended to reinforce rather than resolve the basic strategic problem, that is, what 
counts as “critical” is whatever someone deems to be worthy of extra protection. 
Indicative of this pattern is the fact that in the White House’s Homeland Secu-
rity Strategy the roster of critical infrastructure sectors was determined before the 
analytical framework for making such a determination had been developed. Thus, 
scarce resources appropriated to limit damage by protecting CI have been mis-
directed. For example, the relatively low level of funding for U.S. ports security 
included a disproportionate allocation of funds to small, inland ports and “projects 
that appeared to be more economic- than security-related.”22
Unfortunately, the term critical infrastructure has been attached to sectors that 
are not truly crucial. Indeed, the term critical infrastructure is increasingly associ-
ated with all federal and state spending priorities. In recent years some 40 percent 
or more of homeland security funding was spent in agencies other than the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. Four agencies—the departments of Defense, Health 
and Human Services, Justice, and Energy—share approximately 81 percent of this 
non-DHS-controlled homeland security money.23

196  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The haphazard pattern is even more pronounced in states’ petitions for home-
land security monies. Following the creation of the DHS in March 2003, each state 
government was asked to assess risk within its respective territory by identifying 
critical assets and people or groups that posed a threat. This process of “bottom-up” 
assessments will be in effect until the DHS’s national threat-vulnerability matrix is 
completed in 2008. Unfortunately, the stop-gap measure has invited “critical asset” 
inflation as state officials have tended to list even the remotest risks rather than 
being viewed as negligent. In addition, a number of garden variety “pork-barrel” 
projects exist.24 Examples from one homeland security budget include $200,000 
to project Alert, a school-based drug prevention program for middle grade youth; 
$3,000,000 to Child Labor Enforcement; $7,100,000 for forensic support and 
grants to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; $100,000 to 
the Child Pornography Tipline; and $2.5 billion for “highway security,” consisting 
of the building and improvement of roads. Although these projects may be worth-
while in their own right, one may call into question whether they are appropriate 
targets for homeland security funding.
Given finite resources for supporting efforts to limit damage by terrorist attacks, 
more discriminating choices are necessary, even if they are made by inherently 
political “muddling through” processes.25 Elected officials and local administra-
tors must be given a logical and defensible basis for saying to their constituents “we 
are not getting additional grants or as much as other areas and this is why.” One 
attempt to provide such a foundation is the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant 
Program, which sets forth criteria for determining risk, including: (1) population 
density (half the weight), presence of critical infrastructure (one-third the weight), 
and the presence of a credible threat (about one-sixth the weight).26 Similarly, 
HR3266, the “Faster Smarter Funding for First Responders Act of 2004,” outlined 
a plan to authorize the secretary of the DHS to change the criteria used in the dis-
tribution of funding to DHS’s major programs in order to base grants on potential 
damages, not population.27
The process of critical infrastructure assessment must be better insulated from 
pressures to use it for log-rolling measures and local pork projects. This is difficult 
to do because the formulation and implementation of homeland security strategy is 
exposed to a highly “pluralistic” political process that pushes up subnational con-
cerns and priorities. Of course, the political process cannot be bypassed altogether. 
But, it is incumbent on policymakers to be aware of the stakes involved in the 
process. What is urgently required is a sharpening of the concept of critical infra-
structure. We offer two ways: (1) the asset’s capacity for weaponization, and (2) the 
asset’s substitutability or redundancy.
Weaponization of civilian assets. For the purpose of focusing damage-limitation 
efforts, in specifying critical infrastructure we should identify elements of 
national infrastructure that can be used quickly to inflict catastrophic dam-
age if weaponized (e.g., aircraft, nuclear power plants, chemical processing 

	
Democracy, Civil Society, and the Damage-Limitation Component  n  197
facilities). Distinguishing between assets that are more or less weaponizable is 
essential since virtually anything can be made into a weapon if one tries hard 
enough. Clean water supplies, for example, might be considered part of criti-
cal infrastructure, but water is difficult to weaponize by contamination, and 
thus not conducive to inflicting sudden catastrophic destruction. By contrast, 
dams are obvious elements of critical infrastructure, for if they can be made 
to fail, the resulting floods can cause enormous damage.
Redundancy and substitutability. The utility of the critical infrastructure concept 
can be further honed by considering redundancy and substitutability. Redun-
dancy is associated with segments of national infrastructure that have many 
similar assets serving the same purpose, all of which can function at present 
or greater capacity even while others are impaired or cease functioning.28 
Substitutability is associated with segments of national infrastructure that 
serve needs that can be met by assets available in other segments. For exam-
ple, postal, courier, and light-shipping systems are obvious targets but not 
critical because the overall shipping network—including both government 
and private actors—using roads, waterways, and air, is resilient by virtue of its 
diversification. By contrast, the port of New Orleans is essentially unsubsti-
tutable, for it is the only possible facility for transferring goods coming down 
the Mississippi River to open-sea shipping.29 Moreover, strong profit-based 
incentives to invest in security exist in some sectors, such as courier shipping, 
thus generating redundancy by proliferating competing firms. So the quality 
of redundancy gives some leverage in determining which assets most needed 
federal dollars. There is less need to channel resources to defending elements 
of critical infrastructure where the private incentives to create redundancies 
are high.
Employing criteria of substitutability and redundancy will not be easy. It will 
require study to ensure adequate coverage of population and territory. Further, 
coordination across political and organizational jurisdictions, a particularly vex-
ing challenge to solve, is urgently needed. Finally, a concerted effort to educate the 
parties responsible for damage limitation and first response is necessary. It is to this 
latter consideration that we turn in the next section.
The Private Sector, Civil Society, 
and All-Hazards Response
Delving into the subject of critical infrastructure makes it clear that homeland 
security strategy requires intensive cooperation between the government and pri-
vate sector. When it comes to damage limitation in particular, careful attention 
must be paid to these collaborative relations as they operate both before and after 

198  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
a large-scale terrorist strike.30 Military assistance to civilian authorities in emer-
gency situations is critical, considering the National Guard, under state or federal 
control, is often involved in emergency response. Although there are constitutional 
guidelines governing civil-military relations and customs regarding liaisons with 
local authorities, no well-established mechanisms exist for relations with nongov-
ernmental groups. The most plausible starting point for building these bridges is 
to adapt military civil-affairs liaison roles, which have been well developed to sup-
port humanitarian relief operations abroad, to facilitate working with private-sector 
firms and civil society groups at home.
At the local level, certain private-sector firms may have a special responsibil-
ity because they make a given locale a bigger target and enhance the potential for 
secondary effects of attack (e.g., secondary explosions and chemical or biological 
contamination). Clearly, they will have a central role in recovery after an attack. 
Indeed, some industries have already become involved in this sort of planning. 
For example, Texas Instruments, Lockheed Martin, and oil and gas companies 
have their own emergency teams for responding to industrial disasters before, and 
in conjunction with, public emergency personnel.31 Since the 1984 Union Car-
bide disaster in Bhopal, India, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization 
Act (SARA Title III) has required industries with reportable quantities of lethal 
chemicals to file Tier II reports which notify fire departments, Local Emergency 
Planning Committees, and the state agency in charge of emergency protection of 
the types, locations, and amount of hazardous material being moved or housed. 
Railroad companies are required by law to complete a shipping manifest that iden-
tifies the type and amount of hazardous materials being transported. Along with 
many trucking companies, railroad companies may also have specialized response 
teams to clean up hazardous materials. The Aviation Family Disaster Assistance 
Act of 1996 requires airlines to plan and prepare for responsibilities following an 
air disaster. These include information dissemination, body identification, and psy-
chological counseling. Lastly, a long-standing mandate exists within the shipping 
industry to render assistance to seacraft in distress.32 These are important sinews for 
broader collaboration of government and private sector actors interested in limiting 
the damage of disasters resulting from terrorist attacks or otherwise.33
Beyond private industry, a vast network of civic groups, such as Kiwanis, 
Rotary, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFWs), and the Salvation Army, offer a largely 
untapped resource for promoting damage limitation in homeland security strategy. 
These groups can be thought of as ligaments in a decentralized national emergency-
response capability. As McEntire notes, however, if they are to be utilized in this 
way, norms of collaboration between layers of civil society and government need 
also to be created so that the interaction does not weaken the private impulse.34 
After all, what gives civil society groups vitality is their autonomy from governmen-
tal control. The trick is to channel this dynamism without stifling the internal drive 
and creativity of popular voluntarism.

	
Democracy, Civil Society, and the Damage-Limitation Component  n  199
One way to effect this sort of engagement is to encourage social groups to be the 
locus for civilian volunteer and civil-defense education programs. We will say more 
about this in the next section, but here we want to emphasize one of the main goals: 
to enable local authorities to call upon these civil society assets during the emer-
gency response to “all hazards,” both man-made and natural.35 As Mitchell observes, 
although the risks presented by terrorism are unique, the responses are not.36 And 
“one clear conclusion from the record,” notes Dennis Mileti et al., “is that our under-
standing of how to effectively communicate hazards to people transcends hazard 
type: people remain people regardless of the hazard type being investigated.”37 Thus, 
the “all-hazards” approach to damage limitation is a most compelling one.
A variety of organizations already serve as loose-fitting bridges between the 
public and private sectors, including the National Disaster Education Coalition, 
Project Impact, Disaster Recovery Business Alliance, Showcase Communities, and 
the Office of Private Sector Liaison. The latter should be expanded to include liai-
son with civil society actors as well.38 From the perspective of broadening the reach 
of damage limitation in homeland security strategy, civil society mobilization is 
obviously attractive because it may lighten the load on public authorities during 
complex and demanding emergencies. For example, providing shelter, sustenance, 
and emergency hygiene for displaced persons is an obvious role for some civil soci-
ety groups (e.g., the Red Cross, the Coast Guard auxiliary, civil-air patrol, ski-
patrol). But, equally important, involving these players directly may achieve a larger 
objective, namely the amelioration of a popular sense of helplessness before a crisis, 
and the spread of panic afterwards. It is in relation to this latter goal that we turn 
to the subject of revitalizing civil-defense education.
Reviving Civil-Defense Education
As noted at the outset, the costs of terrorism are many layered, and go well beyond 
the physical. Terrorism not only results in deaths and damage but undermines 
the psychology of confidence and trust that is necessary for the functioning of a 
healthy society.39 Perhaps more so in the United States than elsewhere, there is a 
deep reluctance to compromise the ethos of abundant security, by making robust 
protective measures routine features of daily life. Societies such as Israel and Russia 
have largely come to terms with the continual presence of terrorist threats. It is only 
since the 9/11 attacks that Americans have started to be aware of their own vulner-
abilities. Naturally their first impulse has been to demand more security from their 
government, but Americans also have a tradition of self-reliance that does not seek 
or expect all the answers from the political authorities. We believe this deep-seated 
strain must be emphasized in the larger conception of homeland security strategy, 
especially in relation to the problem of damage limitation. Indeed, in the long run, 
citizens will want and should have a larger role to play in homeland security.

200  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Recent studies present a compelling case for establishing a large-scale pub-
lic education program that seeks not only to inform people about hazards but 
to change their behavior.40 Widespread education can “prime” the public for a 
response to terrorism and other hazards by productively channeling volunteerism, 
suppressing the spread of panic, and assisting official first-response efforts. But the 
general proposition raises a key question: How should the federal government strike 
the balance between trying to catalyze civic involvement at the national level and 
passing that responsibility to state and local authorities who operate closest to the 
ground in communities? As Hurricane Katrina demonstrates, limiting the damage 
of a hazardous event obviously requires timely and significant federal commitment, 
and consequently, the coordination of multiple layers of authorities. However, the 
burden of controlling panic and organizing the initial response must always fall 
most heavily on local actors.
Typically, the real first responders are just citizens seeking to aid those in need.41 
In a pattern of “convergence,” five different types of people tend to congregate at 
the scene of a catastrophe: the returnees, the anxious, the helpers, the curious, 
and the exploiters.42 This is where the emphasis on all-hazards public education 
really gains traction. With effective federally supported public education, all but 
the exploiters may be helped to become positive forces in disaster response. In some 
cases, this may mean staying away from the disaster scene or at least out of the way, 
since researchers have noted that “spontaneous volunteers” can create additional 
problems for official first responders.43 Thus, the federal government’s most effec-
tive contributions may be to encourage and assist local authorities through civic 
education programs, as well as to marshal and integrate citizen volunteers who are 
not just willing but able to really contribute to the recovery process.
For damage limitation in the broadest sense to work, the natural forces of resil-
ience within communities need to be cultivated. But people must know that such 
forces can make a difference in an actual crisis. If they do not, then the costs of ter-
rorism will rise exponentially. Those who contend that robust civil-defense educa-
tion will do more to aggravate fears than allay them underestimate the willingness 
and desire of the public to learn to act responsibly in conditions of crisis. Infor-
mation that is credible and useful builds confidence, not fear. So it is essential to 
avoid superficial rules of thumb that aspire to little more than an easing of minds. 
Instead, people must be given the tools to act on their own behalf and in concert 
with others during emergencies in collectively beneficial ways.44
Imbuing citizens with the knowledge of how to respond properly in the event of an 
attack can be an empowering and relatively cheap measure with large positive ripple 
effects. Few could doubt the enormous value obtained from public education concern-
ing personal safety during earthquakes, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the Heimlich 
maneuver, and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.45 A central complaint of those seeking 
to volunteer after the events of 9/11 was that they felt they did not have the “right 
skills” to assist.46 Perhaps even more than in the aftermath of natural disasters, ter-
rorism evokes a desire to act with an “altruistic orientation.”47 Many people seek to 

	
Democracy, Civil Society, and the Damage-Limitation Component  n  201
channel their distress into efforts to help others. It is imperative to facilitate this psy-
chological impulse as it represents one of the basic ways that the most fundamental 
damage of terrorism, the escalation of fear and helplessness, can be mitigated.
In sum, by combining programs to mobilize civil society organizations sug-
gested above with this broader effort at civil-defense education, one can potentially 
improve the ability of Americans to act not only as “Good Samaritans” but “Smart 
Samaritans” in many emergency situations, thus directly yielding benefits to states 
and local first responders who must bear the brunt of crises.
Concluding Comments
Homeland security strategizing includes making trade-offs. Although the best way 
to limit the damage of terrorist attacks is to stop them from occurring in the first 
place, prevention is never perfect, and because it is not, much needs to be done to 
mitigate the impact of terrorist attacks that do occur. The fundamental problem of 
homeland security strategy is how best to spread resources between the twin goals 
of prevention and damage limitation, given the enormous constraints that arise 
from the government’s need to pursue many other goals at home and abroad. But 
while, for some purposes, the cost-benefit analysis may best be confined to con-
crete and quantifiable values, our strategic thinking about the political workings of 
representative government, a thick and vibrant civil society, and a citizen ethos of 
self-help not only create vulnerabilities and impose limits on what can be done for 
defense, but also bring about opportunities for damage limitation.
Physical dangers are matched by potential self-imposed threats to values of pro-
portionality in government. Some vulnerabilities, such as the danger to Congress of 
widespread incapacitation, or the misallocation of dollars for protection of critical 
infrastructure, are exacerbated by the realities of representative politics. Homeland 
security strategy cannot transcend these obstacles: they are part of the constraints 
in which strategy must operate. But the bigger picture also leads to a broader menu 
of options for limiting the damage of terrorist threats. While resources and respon-
sibilities may be apportioned to federal, state, and local actors for damage limita-
tion, the results can be enhanced by folding into the strategic calculus a role for 
private-sector and civil society groups at both the national and local levels. Indeed, 
even the role of private citizens should not be overlooked for an educated and pre-
pared public is the best defense against the spread of fear. In the final analysis, 
efforts to empower the public are as much a part of damage limitation as measures 
to blunt the physical effects of terrorist attacks.

Transportation as a 
Component of Homeland 
Security Strategy
Joseph S. Szyliowicz
The intermodal transportation system—road, rail, air, 
and sea—and terminals or nodes are an enormously 
complex network that is extraordinarily difficult to 
defend. The stakes are indeed high for the economy 
and society. Given this challenge, homeland security 
strategy necessarily turns to risk-management meth-
odologies. Also essential is a layered approach to strat-
egy, with back-up elements activated when security 
breaches occur. Beyond technological innovations, 
some of which can be circumvented by equally innova-
tive terrorists, is the need for homeland-security edu-
cation customized to the needs of private-sector and 
government employees in all transportation modes. 
The author underscores the importance of strategic 
thinking about transportation intermodally with atten-
tion also directed to the entire network of terminals 
or nodes that serve as linking pins for the system as a 
whole.

208  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
In the aftermath of the tragic events of 9/11, transportation security has emerged as 
a major focus in the effort to defend the United States against terrorist attacks. This 
episode demonstrated a breakdown in many areas of security, necessitating a period 
of profound change and adjustment to the new realities of the situation. As a result, 
the federal government, the states, and the private sector have created new struc-
tures, reorganized existing ones, and adopted new policies to safeguard the nation’s 
critical infrastructure—its food, water, and energy supplies, its defense industries, 
banking and financial sectors, and such facilities as nuclear power plants, chemical 
plants, and dams.1 In February 2003, the National Strategy for the Physical Protec-
tion of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets was published.2 However, concern 
with protecting such key assets dates back to the Clinton era when the Oklahoma 
bombing and the failed attempt to destroy the twin towers in New York led to the 
establishment of the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure and the 
publication of its report in 1997.3 In both reports, transportation was identified 
as one of the key infrastructures. The 1997 report noted: “The physical distribu-
tion infrastructure is critical to the national security, economic well-being, global 
competitiveness and quality of life in the U.S. … [It] provides this nation a distinct 
competitive advantage in the global economy.”4
In this chapter, I examine the vulnerabilities of the U.S. transportation sys-
tem. It forms a major element in our assessment of critical infrastructure. I start 
by addressing the importance of transportation to the country and economy as a 
whole. The bulk of the analysis is geared toward an understanding of the concept 
of modes of transportation. Simply put, I argue U.S. policymakers and analysts 
need to move toward conceiving the transportation system in intermodal, rather 
than strictly intramodal terms. Terrorists have grown increasingly sophisticated 
and possess a rich knowledge of the inner workings of advanced industrialized 
societies. They understand that where citizens and goods come together presents a 
rich target to kill vast numbers of people and produce havoc in the global economy, 
as well as to focus needed attention on their respective cause. So I examine the 
vulnerabilities in the air, water, rail, and road nodes or connection points where 
various modes come together. The final section outlines different dimensions of 
transportation security that must be considered, such as science and communica-
tions technologies, areas that must be incorporated into any long-term strategy of 
homeland security.
Transportation is an attractive target because of its role in the national and 
global economic systems. This sector accounts for over 10 percent of the U.S. GDP 
and about 20 percent of a household’s expenditures, and employs over fourteen 
million people.5 Such numbers belie, however, the true significance of transpor-
tation as it is linked to every sector of the economy. As the 2003 report noted: 
“Interdependencies exist between transportation and nearly every other sector of 
the economy. Consequently a threat to the transportation sector may impact other 
industries that rely on it.”6 In fact the world is characterized by supply chains that 
foster international trade and these are vulnerable to disruption. For example, if 

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  209
the freight system in the United States or another major economy were successfully 
attacked, exporting industries and importers alike would incur tremendous losses, 
as trade would be brought to a virtual standstill. In short, transportation facilities 
present tempting targets to any terrorist group seeking to wreak economic havoc in 
the United States, a goal specifically articulated by al-Qaeda.
Modes of Transportation
Terrorists are also attracted to transportation targets so as to be able to inflict mass 
casualties, as illustrated by the bombings of London’s underground and Madrid’s 
train stations. Moreover, they are fully aware that such facilities often have great 
symbolic importance, as exhibited by attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 
and 2001. Overall, transportation accounted for roughly 20 percent of all targets 
and 15 percent of all fatalities between 1968 and 2005.7
The London and Madrid attacks also demonstrated yet again that the transpor-
tation sector is a security risk because all of its vehicles—not just aircraft—can be 
turned into deadly weapons. Truck and car bombs have been notoriously effective, 
much as hijacked planes became deadly missiles on 9/11. So, transportation is a 
channel for terrorists to travel to their targets and as a way to ship their weapons. 
Thus, it is appropriate to consider all terrorism as involving transportation security 
in one way or another.
Unfortunately, transportation systems have certain characteristics that make 
them especially difficult to safeguard. They encompass several decidedly different 
modes, notably air, water, rail, and road. Each mode contains its own unique char-
acteristics and vulnerabilities. To put it another way, aviation and airport issues are 
very different from those confronting ocean traffic and seaports and rail or road 
passenger and cargo transportation systems.
Until 9/11 aviation was the only mode that received much attention concerning 
security. This mode continues to be the primary beneficiary of public spending on 
security, even though other modes have also been successfully attacked by terrorists. 
Indeed, any coherent effort to enhance transportation security requires an analysis of 
the ways each mode can be safeguarded from attack.
Furthermore, transportation systems have been undergoing dramatic change in 
recent decades that further complicate efforts to enhance security. Today they have 
become more reliant on telecommunications, to such a degree that every transpor-
tation mode is highly dependent upon a functioning cyber network. For example, 
the air traffic control system is critical to safe airline operations. Any disruptions of 
telecommunications networks will have profound consequences for global, regional, 
and national transportation systems, yet they are not yet secure.
Moreover, technological progress in transportation and telecommunications 
continues to aid globalization by reducing obstacles to international commerce 
and facilitating transnational interactions of all kinds. Thus, the problem of 

210  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
safeguarding transportation systems is further complicated because it is a global 
as well as a national issue. But world politics is largely characterized by the 
interactions of independent international states with varying degrees of power 
and influence. So, national and international security concerns require a strong 
measure of cooperation, often a challenging task when attempting to create a 
new regime.
An array of national, international, and transnational actors has dealt rather 
effectively with transportation security. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC), for example, has adopted various measures to enhance the transportation 
security of member states. These include the establishment of the Secure Trade 
in the APEC Region (STAR) initiative, by which member economies are to take 
action to screen people and cargo better, as well as to protect ships, planes, airports, 
and seaports. To achieve these goals, a Counter Terrorism Task Force has been 
established along with a Transportation Security Experts Group, with task groups 
for such areas as cyber, maritime, and aviation security.8 Although helpful, the 
full impact of these activities and those undertaken by the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
remains to be seen.
 Technological developments have also led to the increasing integration of the 
individual modes into a complex system that utilizes the strengths of each. The 
critical points in this intermodal system are the terminals or nodes that link dif-
ferent modes together. These are very attractive targets because of their economic 
and social significance. Traditional security challenges are multiplied by numerous 
new problems of coordination and integration, such as clearly defining the roles of 
the many different types of personnel working in these terminals and ensuring that 
they understand their proper roles in the security program and can manage them 
effectively. For example, the new emphasis on direct rail connections to airports 
means that security practices for the railway and aviation modes need to be harmo-
nized. Of course, ensuring that all rail passengers are subject to rigorous aviation 
screening standards is no simple matter. 9 Thus, intermodalism greatly complicates 
security calculations, particularly when we continue to think of security purely 
within one mode at a time.
Modal thinking is reinforced by the tendency of virtually all governmental 
agencies to function in a reactive mode by responding to particular threats, rather 
than taking a more holistic view of the situation. For example, the airline hijack-
ings and problem of bombs aboard airplanes that emerged in the late 1950s and 
1960s resulted in government-mandated, stepped-up security measures by the air-
lines and at airports. By contrast, little focus was given at the time to security mea-
sures in road, rail, or sea-going modes, a lack of preparedness that remains largely 
unchanged today.
Another complicating factor is that attacks against transportation systems can 
take many forms. The weapons available to terrorists have proliferated and each 
poses unique problems for transportation planners and managers. Explosives, origi-

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  211
nally in the form of suitcase bombs in planes, remain the most common. They 
range from common commercial products to powerful plastic explosives (PBX, 
RDX, and HMX) that are difficult for x-ray machines to detect and are available 
on the black market in Europe.10 Bombings accounted for 60 percent of all attacks, 
80 percent of all injuries, and 52 percent of all fatalities between 1968 and 2005.11 
Moreover, they appear to be an integral part of al-Qaeda’s strategy: in 2002 to 
2003, it launched twelve car bombs, one boat bomb, and two truck bombs, killing 
439 persons in 15 attacks conducted in ten countries. 12 Indeed, al-Qaeda and its 
affiliated groups continue to use these tactics.
Cyber attacks are also common, and can take many forms. A specific database 
of a transportation owner or operator can be attacked in order to gain information. 
An attacker can seek out a weakly defended pathway for access to a network. The 
purpose can be to shut down service or to introduce harmful instructions. Attacks 
can be launched against highway traffic, train control centers, and air traffic control 
systems, as well as port, power, and telecommunications systems. Although the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the lead agency for cyber security of 
critical infrastructure, it has been slow to develop threat and vulnerability assess-
ments or recovery plans.13 Recognizing the need for urgent action, DHS secretary 
Michael Chertoff has established a new office under an assistant secretary for cyber 
security and telecommunications to attend to this issue.14
Transit of nuclear and radiological materials also poses threats. If terrorists can 
acquire 50 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), in principle they can assemble 
a bomb; however, building such a bomb remains a difficult task even with these 
materials and the technical know how. More likely is a radiological attack using 
a “dirty bomb,” or other radiological dispersal device (RDD) that disseminates 
radioactive materials in intermodal facilities or is scattered in powdered form from 
a plane. Such materials are readily available since they are widely used in many 
civilian activities such as x-rays. RDDs are also relatively easy to build.
Chemical and biological weapons have already been used. Terrorists can easily 
acquire numerous agents that cause such diseases as plague, botulism, and small-
pox. A few grams of microbes can prove as deadly as attacks with anthrax have 
proven. Such an attack took place in Tokyo on March 20, 1995 when five members 
of a religious cult carrying bags of the deadly nerve agent sarin entered the subway 
during the morning rush hour, punctured the bags with umbrellas and fled. Fifteen 
different subway stations were affected as people left the train and subsequently col-
lapsed. At first, the cause was unknown so people continued to be infected as opera-
tors tried to clean up the puddles and the trains continued to operate, spreading 
the contamination. It took three hours for the cause to be identified. Fortunately 
the terrorists were not efficient; if they had been, the number of casualties would 
have been much higher. Even so, the toll was 12 dead and some 1,600 seriously 
injured.15

212  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Intermodal Passenger Systems
The Tokyo attack as well as the ones in London and in Madrid illustrate all too 
clearly that intermodal passenger systems and their terminals are attractive terrorist 
targets. Achieving security of these intermodal passenger systems is ultimately a 
fully unachievable goal given their extent, openness, accessibility, and complex-
ity. Compounding this problem is that greater security measures in the realm of 
aviation have contributed to terrorists focusing more of their efforts on railways, 
particularly since they are so difficult to secure and terrorists can escape more eas-
ily. The number of passengers who use light rail, subways, buses, inter-city rail, 
and commuter rail and flow through the system is so high that it is difficult to 
apply preventive screening measures. Every day, over ten million trips are taken 
on metro and commuter rail systems in the United States.16 An obvious conflict 
exists between securing such a system and the inconvenience such measures cause 
passengers.
Managing an attack is no simple matter. The Tokyo case highlighted the chal-
lenges that responders confront. These include:
	
1.	Structural issues—the Tokyo government was in charge, but had poor com-
munications with the military, which had the necessary equipment but was 
under the control of the prime minister.
	
2.	Poor and conflicting information reached the prime minister’s office.
	
3.	Diagnosis and reaction times were slow.
	
4.	Staff and managers were unprepared for this kind of attack.
	
5.	A lack of communication with the public led to panic, which was a major 
reason so many became ill.
	
6.	Emergency response preparation (medicines, hospitals, communications) 
were inadequate.17
These lessons learned are applicable at a general level to all attacks on passenger 
systems and have been widely disseminated, but not necessarily acted upon.
In the United States, various steps have been taken at both the national and 
local levels to improve transit security. At the national level, the Federal Transit 
Association has taken the following steps:
	
1.	Carried out a number of threat and vulnerability assessments of major transit 
systems
	
2.	Deployed technical assistance teams to help transit agencies develop and 
implement security programs
	
3.	Accelerated the deployment of technologies, especially a chemical detection 
system
	
4.	Promoted training and regional collaboration
	
5.	Developed a public awareness program
	
6.	Disseminated guidelines and action items to guide local agencies18

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  213
These urge transit agencies both to (1) establish a specific integrated security 
program that includes emergency-management plans that incorporate and update 
such measures on the basis of threat information and (2) incorporate design cri-
teria, for new facilities and systems an organized incident-management system 
with defined security responsibilities for all employees, including managers who 
are accountable for security within their separate domains. Security awareness is 
stressed for all employees, with ongoing training programs; new employees are to 
be checked and undergo security orientations. Public awareness is also emphasized 
and appropriate materials are to be distributed widely.19
The efficacy of such measures remains to be seen but public transit officials are 
worried about the limited resources that have been made available to harden pas-
senger systems and to improve security. During the first few years following 9/11, 
for example, the federal government allocated a mere $250 million to mass transit, 
compared to over $15 billion for aviation security.20
Railroads and highways are also part of the infrastructure of the surface pas-
senger transportation systems that require attention. Although difficult to protect, 
trains run along specific routes and can be controlled. If taken over by terrorists, 
for example, the train can be diverted from its original route. Though passenger 
and baggage screening of rail passengers is difficult to implement owing to the 
high costs, delays, and number of personnel required, the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration (TSA) initiated a pilot project involving a modified procedure 
designed to assess the impact on passenger flows of checking for explosives.21 The 
sheer size of highway systems with their miles of roads and thousands of bridges 
makes prevention virtually impossible for the system as a whole and extraordinarily 
difficult even for particular segments thought to be threatened. On the other hand, 
although bridges or tunnels can be destroyed relatively easily, the impact tends to 
be limited to the specific corridors struck.
Planning for the security of surface intermodal passenger systems requires a 
decision approach based on clearly defined goals and risk assessment methodologies 
that link actions to potential threats. It should include criteria to identify key assets 
and choke points, such as bridges and tunnels, intermodal nodes, highway inter-
changes, and border crossings that, if successfully attacked, could lead to major 
public health and safety problems or have serious economic consequences. Such 
planning should include the development of comprehensive risk, threat, and vulner-
ability assessments; guidelines and criteria for identifying choke points; standards 
for threat reduction at these points; plans to harden industry infrastructure; the use 
of biometrics and other relevant technology; response plans to handle incidents, 
including direction and control; and creation of national transportation security 
education and awareness programs for planners, managers, and operators.
Any attempt to increase the security of passenger or cargo systems must there-
fore begin with a plan that is based on threat perception analysis and incorporates 
all elements of the system from design and construction through operations and 
response. Thus, facilities should be designed and constructed with such security 

214  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
considerations as lights, visibility, and nonhazardous materials in mind. All relevant 
technologies should be deployed, such as closed-circuit video surveillance, alarms, 
detection, and screening technologies. Communications technologies are espe-
cially critical for responders, operators, and managers, who must be able to share 
information and decisions among themselves through multimode communication 
systems and procedures. Contingency planning by the key stakeholders, such as 
the transportation authority, ministries, health organizations, and first responders 
must be part of the plan, which should include measures to deal with various types 
of attacks, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The plan should also 
provide for a clear decision-making process for system shut down and evacuation, 
effective communications between stations and surface, operators and managers, 
and between various organizations, improved security awareness at all levels of the 
relevant organization, and guidelines for response and training programs, includ-
ing emergency drills and seminars. It should also deal with such issues as detec-
tion, alarm, and communications systems, as well as the availability of appropriate 
equipment such as vaccines. The goal should be to mitigate or limit casualties, dam-
age, and disruption because, given the vulnerability of both passenger and cargo 
systems, deterrence and prevention are unlikely to work 100 percent of the time. Of 
course, every effort should be made to maintain a high level of awareness through 
constant training of staff and personnel and the involvement of the public through 
signs and announcements,. Still, even a well-prepared system is not immune to 
attack, as the bombings of London’s underground clearly demonstrated.
A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that well-known 
risk-management principles had not been implemented. In its words:
Implementation of risk management principles and improved coordi-
nation could help enhance rail security. Using risk management prin-
ciples can help guide federal programs and responses to better prepare 
against terrorism and other threats and to better direct finite national 
resources to areas of highest priority. In addition, improved coordina-
tion among federal entities could help enhance security efforts across 
all modes, including passenger and freight rail systems. We reported 
in June 2003 that the roles and responsibilities of the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Transportation 
(DOT) in transportation security, including rail security, have yet to 
be clearly delineated, which creates the potential for duplicating or con-
flicting efforts as both entities work to enhance security.22
Congress has taken the initiative to improve this situation with calls for the 
development and implementation of a security plan as well as prioritizing and autho-
rizing vastly increased expenditures for rail security. 23 Of course, this is merely an 
attempt to diminish the gap between the lavish spending on the aviation passenger 
system compared to the relatively paltry amount dedicated to rail security.

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  215
In regard to the aviation system since 9/11 the United States has attempted to 
increase security through various measures, the most expensive and visible being 
the replacement of private-company screeners who tended to be poorly paid, badly 
trained, and inefficient compared to a larger, better-funded force of federal workers. 
The degree to which their activities enhance security remains debatable for, although 
the federal screeners have seized a huge number of potential weapons, testers have 
been able to take weapons past screeners in at least 15 airports. Further evidence 
that the screening process was in need of improvement came from a GAO report 
that criticized the TSA’s training efforts. These needed to be updated, required addi-
tional staff as well as better intranet and Internet connections, and internal controls 
including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Moreover, screening remained 
focused on passengers and baggage did not receive the attention that is required.24
Whether better training would significantly reduce the hassle factor that pres-
ently bedevils travelers is unclear, but sentiment appears to be growing that change 
is required, specifically that a passenger who has smuggled a pair of scissors on 
board does not represent a major threat. Measures such as the “registered traveler” 
that would facilitate the process may be desirable, although many object to the 
infringement on privacy involved in transferring the necessary personal informa-
tion to security authorities.
Be that as it may, former DHS secretary Tom Ridge, during whose tenure most 
of the existing practices and protocols were established, admitted: “I think we prob-
ably overreacted. … We need to move from looking for weapons to paying atten-
tion to people who are or could be terrorists.”25 A study by the RAND Corporation 
that evaluated the potential threats did not even list hijacking. Explosives were at 
the top of the list on a threat spectrum or scale ranging from 0 to 100:26
Insider plants bomb 100
Bomb in uninspected cargo 100
Large truck bomb 71
Luggage bomb 45
Curbside car bomb 33
Attack on terminal passenger areas 26
Attack on airplane runway areas 26
Shoulder fired missile 13
Attack on control tower or utility plant 12
Sniper attack 8
Mortar attack 3
Although missiles ranked relatively low, primarily because few attempts have 
succeeded in downing a plane, the potential threat that they pose led Congress to 
instruct the DHS to test a missile defense system that could cost as much as $10 
billion.27 This is another area where cooperation is essential, yet the airlines have 
always been reluctant for these cost reasons to make major investments in security. 

216  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
To deal with other threats, various measures have included background checks of 
airport workers and staff, restricted access to various airport areas, and the appoint-
ment of some 158 federal security directors who are responsible for all 429 major 
airports. Notwithstanding huge investments, significant deficiencies remain. A 
team of police experts, for example, concluded that:
[airport] security in the United States is best characterized as in its 
developmental stage. … First and foremost there is a glaring world-
wide deficiency in the intelligence gathering capabilities of both gov-
ernments and airport facilities. … The integration between TSA and 
law enforcement needs significant improvement. … Law enforcement 
needs a significant attitude change regarding its role in security and 
that it needs to be trained to a higher level of activity to be able to 
respond to an attack.28
Nor can one overlook the role of general aviation. It is quite simple to rent or 
steal a small, privately owned plane or even a large corporate jet. Safeguarding 
thousands of airports and large numbers of planes is a very costly proposition and, 
though some modest steps have been taken, access to these airports and their planes 
remains relatively open. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), a 
powerful lobby, argues that their planes are not a major threat, that they have taken 
effective voluntary actions, and that small airports are secure and planes not easily 
stolen;29 however, many other experts believe that the threat is real. In May 2005 a 
small single-engine plane accidentally intruded into forbidden air space over Wash-
ington, D.C., causing all three branches of the government to evacuate. Indeed, 
the GAO has urged the TSA to develop a risk-management approach to identify 
threats and vulnerabilities, and then apply risk communication principles.30
Freight Systems
In addition to its role in passenger transportation, aviation provides an important 
freight system function. Air cargo represents a potential threat not only to the 
freight carriers, but also to passenger planes that also carry large amounts of cargo. 
Freight passes through many transfer points in its journey from the shipper to a 
plane so that opportunities for tampering are quite extensive. Furthermore, cargo 
planes are just as powerful weapons as loaded passenger planes, but access to the 
cargo ramps is not monitored closely. Nor is all cargo checked. Some experts claim 
that the “trusted shipper” program ensures safety, but the high level of air cargo 
theft, drug smuggling, and other illegal activities indicates the degree to which the 
system is vulnerable. A terrorist attack aimed at blowing up several cargo planes 
simultaneously would have very damaging consequences for any economy and for 
global trade generally.

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  217
The security risks involving cargo have been recognized for some time and vari-
ous measures have been implemented in the past decade by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) and the air cargo companies; however, air freight continues 
to be accorded a lower priority than passengers. Measures such as work on explosive 
detection or cargo profiling are ongoing, but no effective, comprehensive cargo-
security plan has been developed thus far by the FAA or the TSA.
Such an approach is also relevant for other elements of the freight system. Rail-
roads carry tons of bulk commodities and thousands of containers. In addition, 
trucks and containers often carry hazardous materials. An appropriate decision 
system to handle and track such shipments is vital. Contingency plans should be 
developed that deal with such important questions as:
	
1.	When do you shut down the corridor or system?
	
2.	How quickly can traffic resume?
	
3.	Are alternative routes available?
	
4.	What, if anything, should be exempt from the shutdown?
	
5.	How will the containers be marked so that first responders are alerted to the 
specific nature of the cargo, without using a system that can easily be decoded 
by terrorists?
The most critical elements in the freight system are the intermodal nodes—the 
ports through which millions of containers flow each year. Like all other terminals, 
ports are attractive, vulnerable targets. Ports are accessible by both land and water, 
have large numbers of workers and visitors, are close to crowded metropolitan cen-
ters, cover large land areas that often contain petrochemical and other danger-
ous storage facilities, and are intermodal nodes that link shipping to rail and road 
nodes, thus providing ready access to other locations. In addition to such difficul-
ties as size, complexity, and diversity of port operations, other problems include the 
difficulties of achieving coordination by all the actors involved, developing a set of 
standards for the nation so that the level of security is the same for all ports and 
within ports as different facilities owned by different operators may have different 
security levels, funding provisions, as well as obstacles to sharing of intelligence and 
information between the port authority and other governmental agencies.
These vulnerabilities have been exploited by criminal elements for decades. 
Smuggling of drugs and other illicit goods is an active international industry. They 
are often hidden in containers that are part of regular cargoes. The number of con-
tainers that are handled in international commerce is immense, thus creating great 
security challenges. The imports number about nine million containers per year, 
any one of which could be used to introduce a nuclear device or dirty bomb into the 
United States. Checking each of these containers, or even a statistically significant 
percentage, is an impossible task because it would bring commerce to a standstill. 
Another issue is that ports also handle a considerable amount of hazardous cargo.
As early as 2002, Congress passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act 
(MTSA) that called for various initiatives to safeguard U.S. ships and ports. These 

218  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
included threat and security assessments of ports and vessels, national and area 
security plans, a National Maritime Security Advisory Committee and regional 
committees, vessel and facility security and response plans. Closely related is the 
Container Security Initiative (CSI). CSI, a U.S. Customs program, was launched 
in January 2002, and places U.S. Customs inspectors at major foreign ports from 
which most U.S.-bound containers originate so that high-risk containers can be 
prescreened. As many as 37 ports are participating in the program.31
Despite the importance and relevance of achieving such international coopera-
tion, however, the effectiveness of this effort remains in doubt. Moving the inspec-
tion overseas inevitably raises questions about the integrity, reliability, and honesty 
of the local officials who are responsible for checking suspected containers. Indeed, 
a GAO study found that 35 percent of the “potentially dangerous” containers were 
not screened in foreign ports due to diplomatic consideration and inadequate staff-
ing. Furthermore, the equipment at various ports varies and, in the absence of 
minimal standards, even a checked container may still pose a danger. In addition, 
no strategic plan with performance measures that would permit an evaluation of 
its effectiveness has yet been fully implemented, even though the GAO called for 
such action in a 2003 report and, a year later, pointed out that the program did not 
adequately incorporate risk management principles.32
Similarly, a “trusted shipper” program, whereby manufacturers, shippers, and 
carriers who meet certain security standards are eligible for fast-track cargo process-
ing by U.S. Customs, also contains vulnerabilities. Recognizing that the coopera-
tion of the private sector is essential to any attempt at achieving supply chain and 
border security, the trusted-shipper initiative is designed to promote such coopera-
tion. Firms that commit themselves to analyze their security practices and policies 
and to upgrade them throughout their supply chain to a specific standard benefit 
because their goods pass through borders faster as they will be subjected to fewer 
inspections. The GAO found, however, that the process that customs agents used to 
check that the security standards were in fact appropriate was severely flawed, that 
Customs “grants benefits before members undergo the validation process.… To 
date it has validated 11%. … Further, the validation process is not rigorous.” Nor 
has Customs determined how to manage validations in order to minimize risks, 
established any performance measures, or maintained adequate records.33
A number of ports have also received grants either to assess their vulnerabilities 
or to implement additional security measures, but this program too has not led to 
enhanced security. It has been bedeviled by conflicting goals and administrative 
procedures regarding priorities, funding criteria, and the like. As a result, the act-
ing inspector general of the DHS concluded that “the majority of projects have not 
been completed and the program has not yet achieved its intended results in the 
form of actual improvements to port security.”34
Finally, the concern with freight also led to the establishment of Operation 
Safe Commerce (OSC), a public-private partnership designed to bring together the 
largest ports and various federal agencies in an effort to develop new cargo manage-

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  219
ment systems that would safeguard international commerce from terrorist threats. 
Various pilot projects have been implemented to test existing security practices and 
technologies, the goal being to develop a secure and monitored system for freight 
shipments from their point of origin to their final destination. The effectiveness and 
impact of these activities is also problematic.
The overall conclusion to be drawn is that, although each of these projects has 
yielded some positive results, lack of clear guidance and unclear roles for port own-
ers and operators has delayed adequate implementation of appropriate solutions. 
The Coast Guard, the lead agency under the MTSA, is responsible for developing 
new regulations and conducting port and harbor security assessments. Though it 
has implemented a number of important measures in this and other areas, much 
remains to be done, and it is not obvious that it possesses the manpower or the 
expertise to carry out its new functions. Three areas are of particular concern. First, 
to increase security, the Coast Guard has been developing an Automatic Identi-
fication System (AIS) to track vessels, but lacks adequate resources. Second, the 
port security assessments are not based on a “defined management strategy, specific 
cost estimates, and a clear implementation schedule” so this vital activity is not as 
effective as is necessary. Third, the Coast Guard’s efforts to ensure that security 
measures are implemented appropriately are not adequate in such areas as staffing, 
training and managing inspectors, and carrying out inspections.35
Not surprisingly, port authorities and consultants argue that the funding prob-
lem continues to handicap efforts to achieve port security. The Maritime Security 
Act intended to improve port security but provided no funding mechanism and 
since its passage Congress has not yet allocated the funds the Coast Guard estimates 
will be required to safeguard the ports by 2012. Less than 10 percent of the ports’ 
requests were funded, the Bush administration maintaining that the private sector 
should assume most of these costs.36 Certainly, the program has suffered from seri-
ous management issues, including the fact that the limited available resources were 
not targeted sharply. Some 360 cities were initially eligible for port security grants. 
DHS Secretary Chertoff focused on the most critical, declaring that only 66 cities 
could apply under this program.
That ports remain vulnerable is generally accepted by all experts. Specific mea-
sures that can be taken include maintaining secure loading docks monitored by 
cameras; outfitting containers with electronic seals; installing sensors within con-
tainers to ensure that they are not opened illegally during transit; conducting back-
ground checks of truck drivers and others who access or work in the port, providing 
them with biometric identification cards; using electronic transponders and geopo-
sitional satellites (GPS) to track the movement of trucks and rail cars to and within 
the port; requiring advance notice of all movements to the port from the supply 
chain, that is, from product origin to delivery, as well as security and awareness 
training of all personnel. Lastly, detection of weapons of mass destruction deserves 
a high priority, with at least all major ports having radiation coverage.

220  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Yet, the most important problem is to ensure the security of the entire supply 
chain, but all the efforts cited above are essentially focused on preventing a terror-
ist attack aimed at the ports. This is a real and significant danger, especially since 
al-Qaeda has mounted some successful maritime operations and is believed to own 
over 20 vessels that it can utilize for smuggling nuclear and other weapons and as 
means of attack.37 A RAND study noted a lack of focus on the viability of the sup-
ply chain, the “fault tolerance or resilience of the system.” Accordingly, the authors 
suggest that there is a need to assess existing and proposed policies, apply a systems 
approach, evaluate the contribution of technological developments, and gain a bet-
ter understanding of how security considerations affect trade flows and corridors. 
Above all, the government should take the lead in promoting measures to enhance 
resiliency and focus research and development activities on the development of low-
cost, high-volume scanning devices.38
The Dimensions of Transportation Security
Certain basic lessons emerge from this consideration of transportation security that 
need to be emphasized. Transportation systems are complex interconnected sys-
tems. The more complex the system, the greater the vulnerability. One element 
contributing to this complexity is the large number of actors. Many key actors are 
in the private sector. Their cooperation is essential if appropriate levels of security 
are to be achieved but, historically, the airlines and other private sector firms have 
not been interested in funding the necessary security measures, apart perhaps from 
theft prevention. If this pattern is to change, incentives motivating the private sec-
tor to adopt different policies will have to be devised. The goal should be to create 
a situation in which the private sector achieves economies of scale while security is 
enhanced.
Collaboration across modes and organizations is necessary. The many and 
diverse organizations that are involved must cooperate in joint efforts to break 
down existing barriers and obstacles that prevent the integration of security mea-
sures. This has to take place at many levels and include such measures as informa-
tion sharing, training, and planning. These should be based on an evaluation of 
existing strengths and weaknesses in all relevant areas, including technology, iden-
tifying gaps and ways to fill them. Transportation-dependent organizations, such 
as shippers and tourism industries, should also be involved in the process. At the 
national level, issues of national policy and funding require attention. At the local 
level, issues of responses and mitigation need to be addressed.
The traditional approach to securing intermodal and other facilities is with 
a “guards, guns, and gates” strategy. Such a strategy is essentially a perimeter 
defense that, if breached, can lead to the destruction of the entire facility. This 
happened on 9/11 when the terrorists were able to smuggle their weapons onto the 
planes. What is required is a “layered” approach that is systematic and compre-

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  221
hensive because breaching a particular security feature means that other elements 
will provide backup.
When considering transportation security, it is necessary to consider all aspects 
of the system, specifically planning, design, implementation, and operation. The 
goal should be to incorporate security into each of these aspects to the greatest 
extent possible. At the core of such an approach is a decision process based on 
clearly defined goals. For example, what are the goals in the aviation sector? Is it to 
decrease the overall risk to passengers? If so, then more stringent measures should 
be enacted. Is it to enhance the well-being of the airlines? If so, should they not be 
expected to bear a share of the high costs? Is it to protect the national economy? 
If so, air cargo requires more attention. Is it to prevent the release of chemical or 
biological agents? If so, private planes merit greater focus. Is it to increase consumer 
confidence? If so, the least invasive procedures are probably desirable. Because 
some of these goals may well be contradictory, beyond difficulties in attempting 
to achieve them all, conflicting policies likely will be the outcome. The alternatives 
need to be thought through, priorities set, and allocations of cost determined in 
exchanges between government and the private sector.
Once goals and objectives are specified, risk assessment methodologies that 
relate actions to potential threats and costs can be utilized. These should be based 
on a realistic appraisal of the potential threat and include such basic factors as the 
terrorists’ training, skill levels, resources, attack methods and weapons, including 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, as well as more traditional ones.
This approach requires that consideration be given to an analysis of the range of 
possible actions, their costs and benefits, and impacts upon security at each of the 
three principal stages:
	
1.	Analysis and planning—develop a national transportation security assess-
ment that identifies the weakest links in the transportation system and its 
infrastructure, and prioritizes the value of these links to terrorists.
	
2.	Preparedness—develop a protection strategy.
	
3.	Response—develop a response strategy at all levels.
These activities must be supplemented by the development of a training and pre-
paredness program at all levels. Well-prepared first responders can mitigate impacts 
of terrorist acts so it is necessary to:
	
1.	Establish national standards with appropriate regional variations.
	
2.	Establish programs and funding for training key personnel.
	
3.	Work with professional associations and others to develop training 
programs.
Such programs should include system and modal security awareness for employ-
ees who should be trained to understand their roles and responsibilities, alerting 
them to recognize suspicious persons, activities, and devices, and to communi-
cate information to appropriate personnel. Management and supervisors should be 

222  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
trained to understand their roles and responsibilities and how to carry them out. 
Communicating with the public is also important. In particular, a specific plan 
should be developed to communicate threat alerts to the public through channels 
such as the media and cell phone networks.
Science and technology will inevitably comprise important elements in such 
a strategy. There is no doubt that technology can reduce vulnerabilities in many 
important ways. The United States is carrying out a large research and development 
effort to identify new methods of safeguarding telecommunications systems, of 
detecting biological, chemical, and nuclear agents, of checking baggage for explo-
sives, and of tracking and protecting containers. Ideally the new technologies will 
increase efficiency at the same time that they enhance security. Such technologies 
are obviously more likely to be accepted rapidly by the private sector.
Communications technologies are critical. Attacks have occurred against sev-
eral modes so intermodal communication and interorganizational communication 
is essential. Fast and coordinated information exchange must be the goal. This 
requires more than common radio frequencies for first responders, such as secure 
and standardized procedures. Other relevant technological areas include the use of 
biometrics to improve security at key points of access, the identification and deploy-
ment of container- and cargo-screening capabilities, identification and deployment 
of explosive detection technologies, and design processes that build security into 
basic system designs as much as possible.
To be effective, new technologies have to be integrated into existing systems 
through the following steps:
	
1.	Identify the modes, nodes, infrastructure, and stakeholders that are 
vulnerable
	
2.	Analyze the relationships among these elements
	
3.	Pay special attention to intermodal and transfer facilities
	
4.	Consider all the modes and their interactions when developing security poli-
cies and practices in terms of:
	
a. Existing capabilities and strengths that can be built upon
	
b. Funding priorities at all levels
	
c. Cross-modal interactions
	
5.	Incorporate security requirements when setting new standards
	
6.	Define best practices and assess their relevance for other areas
	
7.	Look for effective but simple and affordable technologies
Technology cannot deliver a “silver bullet” to safeguard transportation, despite 
its appeal and efforts to accelerate the development of new technologies, such as 
“sniffers” to detect bombs at a distance, computer programs to identify suspicious 
activities, and machines to screen large numbers of people quickly and accurately. 
All such technologies may hold promise but they only too frequently may be cir-
cumvented by equally innovative terrorists.

Transportation as a Component of Homeland Security Strategy  n  223
Technology ultimately depends on people. It is human beings who operate 
the technologies, who must interpret the results that technological tools provide. 
Since every aspect of transportation—its planning, design, operation, and main-
tenance—requires organizational and technological change, professionals with 
appropriate skills and perspectives will be required. Only recently have educational 
and security issues received any attention so that few transportation professionals 
in either the public or the private sector possess an appropriate understanding of 
the issues or the relevant skills required to function effectively in the new envi-
ronment. An appropriate level of security will be achieved when all levels of all 
transportation-related organizations assume ownership of security; however, this 
will take time and be dependent on improving the technical and conceptual skills 
of all members of the aviation sector, from truck drivers delivering cargo to clerical 
staff opening the mail and entering data to corporate-level executives and govern-
ment officials planning and implementing policy. Developing a coherent strategy to 
tackle such educational and training needs is an issue of great urgency.
Concluding Comments
It is no longer adequate to consider security in terms of individual modes. Inter-
modal linkages, or nodes, must be included and this growing connectivity has 
dramatically increased the vulnerability of transportation. It is obviously essential 
to think of security not in intramodal but in intermodal terms, a difficult challenge 
because commercial firms and government agencies are usually organized on the 
basis of modes.
Transportation professionals must, therefore, be sensitive to the security issues 
that this new transportation system creates. They must be prepared to develop 
plans and policies that are designed to prevent attacks, reduce the vulnerabilities of 
intermodal facilities, and prepare for response and recovery should a disaster occur. 
Intermodal professionals have a responsibility to pay attention to each of these 
dimensions in order to ensure that personal mobility and the movement of freight 
and goods continue as smoothly as possible, as failure to do so would seriously hin-
der national development and pose significant obstacles to future growth.
With a finite number of dollars and competing budgetary priorities, of course 
we simply cannot protect all of our assets all the time despite our best intentions. 
Thus, we will need to assess our vulnerabilities as well as the nature and extent of 
the threat. In the final analysis, a balanced risk assessment must be a critical ingre-
dient if we are to construct and implement an effective homeland security strategy. 
In this endeavor the public and private sectors will each have to play a major role. 
Working together at all levels in a cooperative fashion must be a hallmark of any 
successful strategy to address this major and growing homeland security problem.

Chapter 12
Redefining U.S. Energy 
Security in the Twenty-
First Century
Kevin King
The author examines energy infrastructure in relation 
to national and homeland security. Much like transpor-
tation, energy and other parts of national infrastructure 
are vulnerable to one form or another of terrorist attack. 
Beyond the extraordinarily difficult and expensive task 
of defending the energy infrastructure, which is also 
closely tied to and dependent on the transportation 
sector, King also addresses other vulnerabilities that 
pose significant challenges to national security. Con-
tinuing availability and access to a sufficient supply of 
fuels are central to economic security. At the same time, 
reliance on fossil fuels contributes to global warming, 
which is itself a national security challenge.
In these early years of the twenty-first century, the national focus on war and insta-
bility in the Middle East and climbing domestic energy prices is drawing attention 
to the nexus between energy and national security once again. During the 1970s 
and early 1980s, energy policy and national security were tightly linked, but the 

228  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
primacy of this relationship tended to wane in salience with the resolution of inter-
national petroleum supply crises and with petroleum prices that have facilitated 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member 
countries’ economic development on the whole. By the late 1990s, however, atten-
tion was redirected toward this relationship when oil industry insiders presaged 
world peak oil production and an impending oil shortage by 2010.1 Following these 
warnings were the 9/11 attacks in 2001, raising serious questions about U.S. criti-
cal vulnerabilities and possible terrorist targets, including the U.S. energy system. 
Further heightening concerns today are a multitude of problems that appear to have 
no easy solutions and affect world energy markets: surging oil demand in develop-
ing countries; political instability in Nigeria; soured U.S. relations with Venezuela; 
the U.S. military intervention in Iraq, the ongoing insurgency, and Iraq’s oil sector 
operating at suboptimal levels; the durability of al-Qaeda’s leadership and the dif-
fusion of affiliated terror groups; Saudi Arabia’s internal militant Islamic jihadist 
problem; the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process and associated conflicts; as 
well as Iran’s nuclear program, pledges to destroy Israel, and threats to use the oil 
weapon if provoked.
Even more daunting is a long-term set of challenges that confront the United 
States over the next thirty to forty years. The U.S. must attain its energy security in 
the face of decreasing domestic energy supply and increasing energy consumption, 
growing dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels, the exponentially rising costs 
of maintaining intervention policies in the Persian Gulf to ensure the free flow of 
oil, and precipitous and irreversible decline in world oil production predicted before 
2040.2 The urgency of this situation is underscored by the inescapable fact that 
the U.S. economy, the world’s largest at over $13 trillion,3 rests fundamentally on 
“an energy foundation,”4 and this foundation is built primarily out of hydrocarbon 
fuels.
Indeed, at the core of this energy base is the strategic commodity petroleum 
and its related products, all of which are demanded in greater quantities annually. 
This makes the expected twilight of the petroleum age a massive dilemma for the 
United States, at least as large as its present dependence on foreign oil imports. Not 
only is the United States growing more dependent on imported oil daily, this trend 
is not expected to reverse until and unless a technological breakthrough leads to 
an energy revolution, public policy provides the leadership and framework neces-
sary for meeting tomorrow’s energy needs through a variety of alternative energy 
solutions, or world peak oil collapses the present system altogether. Furthermore, as 
exploitable world petroleum resources shrink in the coming years concomitant with 
more global competition for these resources, it is hard to see how the United States 
will be less vulnerable to energy shocks absent a comprehensive energy security 
strategy to create a more resilient and diversified energy system.
Complicating this picture is the prospect of finding viable alternatives to fossil 
fuels that can be economically exploited within the coming decades to meet higher 
energy demands, a situation that will require tremendous innovation and farsighted 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  229
public policy. Energy solutions that come too late, or further contribute to severe 
environmental imbalances, or are insufficient to meet energy requirements would 
almost certainly have cascading economic, political, social, and ecological effects. 
Stability of the present hydrocarbon energy system is not simply desirable, it is 
presently vital to the functioning of U.S. society and integral to the prosperity of 
its economy. Yet how the United States eventually transitions to an alternative and 
more sustainable energy system will determine its success and security tomorrow.
In this chapter, I seek to explore this critical link between energy and national 
security, ubiquitously known as energy security. The goal is threefold. First, I 
develop a framework for understanding the nature of how energy security is broadly 
conceived. The energy position of the United States is explained in relation to its 
main energy sectors. Second, the critical infrastructure and key assets pertaining to 
energy production, transmission and transport, storage, and end use are outlined 
for major components of the energy system. Finally, this chapter discusses U.S. 
national energy strategy in light of current dilemmas and concludes with the issue 
of energy system transition.
Conceptualizing Energy Security
Since conceptions concern the elements that make energy systems secure, it is use-
ful to begin by clarifying what these terms mean. An energy system pertains to the 
integrated network of primary energy sources, fuel refinement and power genera-
tion processes, and infrastructure that distribute energy for residential, commer-
cial, industrial, military, and transportation end-use sectors.5 An energy system is 
like other systems, in that it has inputs, or supply chains of primary energy sources 
that are the raw materials, such as crude oil; throughputs, or chemical, electrical, 
nuclear, thermal, and other conversion processes; and outputs, or refined fuels, 
electricity, heat, pollution, and waste—in short, all of the intended and unintended 
effects from energy conversion and consumption; and throughout the system there 
is the complex web of infrastructure and human resources that manage the inputs, 
throughputs, and outputs within the context of corporate and government policies 
and legal constraints to transform and deliver energy to end users.
The task of defining energy security beyond the traditional scope of oil security 
is not easy, complicated by factors such as a relative conceptual nascency and lack 
of scholarly consensus. It has only been in the last decade that broader scholarly 
attention to the subject has emerged in real force, in contrast with the vast bulk of 
literature the oil crises generated in the 1970s and 1980s. As yet there is no univer-
sally accepted paradigm, but rather a variety of approaches that emphasize different 
issues and policies that are explored in this section.
Besides conceptual nascency and competing approaches, another factor com-
plicating defining energy security is its tainted legacy from its use by policymakers. 
Often public officials who speak of energy security never make an attempt to define 

230  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
it, but use it as the rationale for executive or legislative action. U.S. politicians of all 
political stripes have been particularly adept at using energy security as the pretext 
for enacting legislation that is purportedly promoting the greater good and protect-
ing America.6 This may be useful in rallying support for the passage of an energy 
bill, but it is hard to see how America’s energy system is more secure when such 
legislation tends to benefit special interests with powerful lobbies, and resource 
allocation is largely directed away from America’s renewable energy programs.7 As a 
result, some view energy security as “a woolly and much-abused notion,”8 deployed 
to justify resource nationalism, industry protectionism, and a virtual constellation 
of bad policy decisions.9 Thus, it becomes necessary to distinguish between the 
political uses of energy security versus its meaning in a rigorous academic context. 
It is this scholarly milieu that is the focus of this section.
In its simplest articulation, energy security is a population’s “secure access to 
adequate supplies of primary energy at affordable cost.”10 For example, Bielecki 
reiterates these central themes, defining energy security as “uninterrupted supply 
that fully meets the needs of the global economy,” while noting that “reasonable 
prices” is a problematic generalization depending on the dimensions of time and 
individual perception.11 Nevertheless, Bielecki decides that reasonable prices are 
“cost-based and determined by the market based on supply/demand balances.” Bar-
ton et al. similarly stress energy supply reliability and affordability, stating that 
energy security is the “condition in which a nation and all, or most, of its citizens 
and businesses have access to sufficient energy resources at reasonable prices for the 
foreseeable future free from serious risk of major disruption of service.”12 As far as 
definitions go, these first appear to be parsimonious. But upon reflection, they raise 
more questions than answers. For instance, why is importance attached to energy 
supply reliability but not energy system resiliency and resistance to critical failure? 
Are market preferences the central important aspects of secure energy systems, even 
beyond critical infrastructure protection and designing less vulnerable networks? 
One can also ask why energy security is confined to all or most of a nation’s citizens 
and businesses, and why energy security is apparently achieved when risk of major 
service disruption is presumed to be absent. One would assume in the age of mod-
ern terrorism that such risk would be omnipresent, especially given the prevalence 
of centralized generation networks and their well-known vulnerabilities. Moreover, 
should demand-side management be at least as important as supply-side manage-
ment? Likewise, environmental issues impacting domestic populations and the 
global commons are not mentioned in these definitions. Are we to infer, therefore, 
that they are of little importance in how we should approach the concept of energy 
security? Many simple definitions fall short for the reason that they ignore elements 
integral to the optimal functioning and robust protection of energy systems, as well 
as the recognition that new threats require adaptive change.
Though the simple definitions circumvent the issue of threats posed to energy 
systems by terrorists, the post-September 11 world requires that conceptual think-
ing take such threats into account. Terrorism is no longer something that occurs 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  231
in places distant temporally and psychologically, but a real and serious threat at 
home and abroad to critical infrastructure and global supply chains. Similarly, easy 
definitions also ignore central policy themes. Government policies impact the secu-
rity of energy systems by setting priorities and standards, regulating industries, 
providing parameters for negotiations and agreements, and allocating resources. In 
the twenty-first century, modern industrial countries must meet their rising energy 
needs while competing for scarce resources with rapidly developing states, and 
addressing international pressures for sustainable development, pollution abate-
ment, and cooperation on climate change. Thus, definitions that ignore critical 
realities, or are centered on one issue or almost entirely concerned with aspects of 
one fuel alone fail to help us understand energy security in its totality. For these 
reasons, conceptual understandings of energy security that articulate the core 
challenges, threats, and goals to securing energy systems are preferred to pithy 
definitions.
Before turning to more recent work, we need to examine a seminal Cold War 
study of the U.S. energy system, a path-breaking work originally conceived for 
the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency and later completed under the aegis of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency.13 This report remains a definitive analy-
sis of critical vulnerabilities, potential and real threats, and solutions that remain 
salient today. In fact, the authors recognized over twenty years ago that “energy 
is more than oil, and energy security is far more than ability to keep the oil com-
ing,” also adding that America’s energy system is “brittle—easily shattered by acci-
dent or malice.”14 The study aptly assessed vulnerabilities that still plague the U.S. 
energy system, notably its highly centralized and rigid networks, hazardous mate-
rials/fuels intensity, the lack of large-scale fuel substitutability, as well as complex 
system components designed for reliability but nevertheless prone to unpredictable 
interactions that can result in system-wide failures having potentially catastrophic 
consequences. In light of these vulnerabilities and human threats, the study con-
cluded that national energy insecurity requires designing resilience into the energy 
system.
After the Cold War, new research began to assess whether the United States 
was still vulnerable to the old threats, as well as assess emerging and future threats. 
Of particular note is a white paper the Pacific Northwest Laboratory prepared for 
the U.S. Department of Energy in the early 1990s that addressed future energy 
security concerns. The authors concluded that the “meaning of energy security for 
the United States in the post-Cold War era will be different than previously con-
ceived due to changes in politics, economics, technology and the environment on 
a global scale.”15 Important contributions from this white paper are its findings 
that energy crises are not usually precipitated by a single problem or event, but 
are the product of a confluence of complex interactions. Future energy crises may 
arise from any combination of the following: (1) unanticipated and rapid political 
changes that intersect in time to result in supply disruptions, such as those caused 
by regime change, civil unrest, numerous but separate regional conflicts, and/or 

232  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
terrorism, and perhaps even nuclear terrorism against high-value targets such as oil 
infrastructure; (2) restrictive environmental regulation decreasing energy produc-
tion due to rising concerns about human-caused environmental harm and “the 
need to include ecological considerations in plans for economic growth and indus-
trial development”; (3) transportation problems arising from accidents or shipping 
congestion at vital choke points, such as the Suez Canal or any of the main tanker 
routes funneling heavy traffic through narrow straits; and (4) destabilizing effects 
from rapid economic growth in the developing world, or devaluation of the dollar 
making energy imports unaffordable or perhaps even the loss of the dollar as the 
benchmark currency for foreign energy commodities.16 These are all either mani-
festly real or highly possible scenarios and each of the identified areas has public 
policy implications.
Another post-Cold War security context is provided in a 1996 Trilateral Com-
mission report by Martin et al.17 Maintaining security of oil supply and stable oil 
prices is necessarily part of their analysis given the present oil dependency of the 
Trilateral countries, but they also take a broader view that looks beyond oil and 
incorporates the environment. Their “three faces” of energy security are:18
	
1.	Limiting vulnerability to [energy supply] disruption given rising dependence 
on imported oil from an unstable Middle East
	
2.	Over time, the provision of adequate supply for rising demand at reasonable 
prices—in effect, the reasonably smooth functioning over time of the inter-
national energy system
	
3.	The energy-related environmental challenge. The international energy system 
needs to operate within the constraints of “sustainable development”—con-
straints which, however uncertain and long-term, have gained considerable 
salience in the energy policy debates in [Trilateral] countries.
In relation to limiting vulnerability, the authors warn against lowering inven-
tories in strategic petroleum stockpiles, the problem of absent stockpiles in rapidly 
developing states, and the necessity that the United States “continue to protect the 
Gulf region from possible aggressors.”19 At the same time, they urged Trilateral 
countries to find alternatives to Persian Gulf oil where possible, and to slow oil 
demand growth by adopting policies that stress increased energy efficiency and 
alternative energy technologies.20
Thus, Martin et al. acknowledged the strategic importance of maintaining oil 
security while dependence on petroleum is growing, but they also pivotally intro-
duced output environmental effects and sustainable development as part of a new 
energy security equation.21 In relation to the environment, they considered the 
three most significant negative externalities linked to conventional fossil fuel con-
sumption to be the threat of global climate change, such as global warming, the 
regional environmental challenge of acid rain, and urban air pollution. Of these, 
potential cumulative human contributions to global warming is the only real albeit 
controversial element, the scientific mainstream holding that natural variability 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  233
alone is insufficient to explain observed climatic phenomena.22 Moreover, cogent 
and forceful reasons exist for policymakers to address both the economic price tag 
of government action in attempts to mitigate climate change, as well as the costs 
to be paid as a result of inaction.23 Since the anthropogenic contributions to global 
warming have become clearer and pressures are mounting on governments to pro-
vide energy policy solutions to help alleviate correlated environmental effects,24 
emerging energy-security concepts now incorporate the expanded view of the Tri-
lateral Commission report.
A 1998 energy security working paper by the Nautilus Institute for Security and 
Sustainable Development was another forward-looking conceptual reorientation 
on the subject of energy security. The authors recognized the long-term challenge 
posed by international terrorism and diverged from the traditional approach to 
energy security, identified in the report as “the conventional view” centered upon 
the “problem of securing oil resources.”25 The report outlined a more comprehensive 
energy security construct that incorporated the challenges national energy policies 
confronted in the late 1990s and beyond:
	
1.	Integrating international environmental problems linked to energy con-
sumption (e.g., acid rain and global warming) into a new energy security 
concept.
	
2.	Assessing long-term risks associated with advanced technologies that tend to 
be miscalculated (e.g., nuclear power plant accidents and the failure of syn-
thetic fuel, fast breeder reactor, and solar thermal research and development 
programs).
	
3.	Utilizing the demand-side management (DSM) of energy consumption, 
difficult because it involves uncertainties related to consumer behavior and 
reacting to demand surges as well as negative demand growth.
	
4.	Investigating the sociocultural factors that impact policymaking, such as 
local opposition in the siting of important energy facilities, legal disputes 
and economic compensation to aggrieved parties, and the issue of promoting 
public confidence in energy policy decisions.
	
5.	Adapting to the post-Cold War changes in international relations and rise 
of potential regional military confrontations that exist in an environment of 
greater uncertainty, also characterized by the threat of nuclear terrorism and 
proliferation.
This rationale for an expanded view of energy security seems well justified years 
later, as these challenges persist.
Yergin’s evolving conceptions of energy security warrant mention here given his 
influence in policy formation circles. In the late 1980s, Yergin specified that the 
key role of energy security “is to assure adequate, reliable supplies of energy at rea-
sonable prices and in ways that do not jeopardize major national values and objec-
tives.”26 This definition omits much for the sake of brevity, and is problematic when 
one considers the disagreement that obtains in relation to defining national values 

234  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
and objectives. Yergin has since expanded his view of energy security to include ten 
key principles constituting energy security:27
	
1.	Diversification of fuel supply
	
2.	Recognition that only one oil market exists and it is international in scope
	
3.	A security margin (strategic reserves, spare capacity, etc.)
	
4.	Resisting temptations to interfere in markets (using price controls, allocation 
schemes, etc.)
	
5.	Building cooperative relations with energy exporting countries
	
6.	Maintaining cooperative relations with energy importing countries
	
7.	Designing and implementing a proactive security framework involving pro-
ducers and consumers that responds to threats and attacks on supply chains
	
8.	Better information flows from government and the private sector to the pub-
lic during tight market conditions and supply disruptions in order to alleviate 
panic-driven responses
	
9.	A healthy, technologically driven energy industry for continued exploration 
and production in environmentally sound ways that operates under reason-
able and predictable rules
	 10.	Commitment to research, development, and innovation across energy sys-
tems (hydrocarbon to alternative) and involving government, university, and 
private cooperation to achieve diversification, respond to environmental con-
siderations, and try to meet growing world energy needs
Though Yergin advocates cooperation between government and the private sec-
tor, he does not advocate a greater role for government in shaping public policy 
to change market steering currents. He prefers the view that markets are largely 
self-adjusting, stressing the lessons from the 1970s and earlier, when government 
policies damaged the market’s ability to allocate resources efficiently and exacer-
bated conditions for already stressed supply chains. Yergin has called for a widened 
energy security construct that is more global in outlook and requiring international 
cooperative efforts to stabilize and protect energy markets.28
It is important to note an increasingly persuasive challenge to the conventional 
wisdom maintaining that the unfettered free market will find expedient and mon-
etarily feasible technological solutions to the energy challenges that lie ahead. There 
are those who point out that the time horizon for these solutions is shrinking rap-
idly, depending on differing world peak oil predictions, with mean estimates sug-
gesting it will occur by 2040. With possibly only three decades in advance of the 
need to transition to a more diversified array of energy sources, if not an entirely 
new energy system, technological advancements must occur within a compressed 
time frame.
Yet technological solutions often require extensive periods of research and 
development before technology transfer occurs on a large scale. Recognizing this, 
Kenderdine and Moniz make the important observation: “Energy security is not 
easily achieved. As a ‘public good,’ it is a government responsibility.”29 In their 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  235
vision of energy security, market preferences do not inevitably lead to greater secu-
rity. Government has the imperative to facilitate technology development that is 
not taking place and cannot take place within the time horizon that is necessary 
without large public expenditures.
Kenderdine and Moniz note that the last thirty years of public energy research 
and development investment has a mixed track record of successes and failures, 
but most of it has accrued to public benefit by enhancing national security, fur-
thering knowledge, advancing technology development, and achieving significant 
cost savings.30 The coming decades require that the U.S. government reevaluate 
its approach to the energy sector and set “strategic energy objectives, revise those 
objectives where appropriate, and more closely align its energy R&D programs 
with its energy security objectives.”31
In sum, energy security conceptions are broadening to capture previously 
ignored complexities, and vary considerably in their assessment of the essential 
issues and public policy roles. Although the different approaches reviewed in this 
chapter by no means represent a new consensus, they nevertheless are an effort 
toward developing a more comprehensive energy security paradigm that is nec-
essary for redirecting national energy policies to work for better management of 
critical problems. Most simple definitions of energy security frame it within the 
context of maintaining reliable supplies of primary energy at affordable costs, but 
these definitions do little to delineate priorities in securing energy systems given a 
range of vulnerabilities, new threats, and remediation necessities. This is especially 
important as pertains to petroleum-dominated systems having global supply chains 
jeopardized by increasing competition for resources in tight markets, exacerbated 
by serious political instabilities in major producing countries and regions, and the 
specter of global terrorism. Indeed, the urgency to protect critical aspects of the 
global energy system has never been greater.
The U.S. Energy System: Vital Energy Sectors 
and Critical Infrastructure Protection
The United States ranks as the world’s largest energy consumer, producer, net 
importer, and single largest contributor of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emis-
sions,32 yet it only possesses approximately 4.6 percent of the world’s population. 
The country’s energy system is built upon three major energy sectors: petroleum, 
natural gas, and electricity. All of these sectors are dominated by fossil fuels that col-
lectively meet 86 percent of current energy demand, almost totally eclipsing alter-
natives.33 Thus, while renewable and alternative energy sources hold great promise 
for the future, this chapter necessarily confines its analysis to the sectors that are 
critical at this moment in time and that will be dominant for years to come.

236  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
Petroleum
Petroleum is the most important U.S. fuel and constitutes a strategic energy sec-
tor. Petroleum has become essential to modern industrialized societies because it is 
easily converted into a multitude of fuels and chemicals and is already in a liquid 
state, unlike coal or natural gas, and exceeds them in applications far beyond heat-
ing and power generation. Even high world nominal crude prices have done little to 
dampen oil demand. Indeed, the United States is more dependent on oil, devour-
ing roughly 25 percent of the world’s petroleum production.34 Petroleum accounts 
for 41 percent of America’s overall fuel consumption, the highest of any fuel, and 
comprises a staggering 98 percent of the nation’s transportation fuel needs.35 While 
about 90 percent of petroleum is converted into gasoline and other fuels, the rest 
is used as a feedstock in the manufacture of plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, 
foods, and other consumer products too numerous to mention here.36 It is hard 
to think of many contemporary goods that are not derived from or do not utilize 
petroleum or its related products, in whole or in part, at some point in their devel-
opment, transport, storage, or end use. One could say that petroleum is not merely 
a commodity or fuel source, but the basis for a way of life.
Its utility notwithstanding, the bottom line is that the United States is over-
whelmingly dependent on petroleum, but it is unable to produce all of the oil it 
needs. Of the approximately 21 million barrels (bbl) of oil a day the United States 
consumes, over 12 million are imported. As demand goes up and domestic pro-
duction continues to decline, the percentage of imported oil can only increase. 
The problem is fundamentally one of high domestic demand coupled with falling 
domestic supply. The United States has the eleventh largest recoverable oil depos-
its in the world, approaching 21.4 billion bbl of conventional proved reserves.37 
Production from these reserves is inadequate to meet daily demand. Even with 
new discoveries and reserves additions to older fields, the overall situation is one 
of net depletion. The maturity of U.S. oil fields is quite problematic, given that oil 
consumption is rising, on average, 1 to 2 percent annually, while domestic crude 
production has been falling at about the same rate. In fact, U.S. Energy Informa-
tion Administration (EIA) models indicate that petroleum demand will rise by 
approximately 1.4 percent annually through 2025, when Americans will consume 
almost 28 million bbl a day and 19 million of those will be imported. This means 
imports account for approximately 60 percent of consumption now, and through 
2025 this could trend toward 68 percent or higher unless high crude prices are 
sustained over time and lower import projections.38
Since the petroleum market is international in scope, U.S. demand should 
be contextualized within the rubric of overall world demand, both present and 
future projections. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), world 
oil demand in 2004 stood at 82.46 million bbl per day (30.1 billion bbl annu-
ally), an increase of 2.68 million bbl per day (978.2 million bbl annually) over the 
previous year.39 In fact, world demand was surprisingly high in 2004, and about 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  237
750,000 bbl a day higher than analysts previously had predicted.40 Although the 
world average demand growth was about 3.4 percent, the largest jump in demand 
occurred in China, with a significant increase of over 15.5 percent from the year 
before. Consuming 6.5 million bbl per day in 2004, China has surpassed Japan to 
become the world’s second largest consumer of petroleum. This increase accounted 
for approximately 40 percent of world oil demand growth in 2004.41 Although it 
is true that this strong demand growth was not sustained into 2005, IEA forecasts 
that China will increase its oil consumption by 5.3 percent in 2006.42 Moreover, 
China’s consumption is expected to double by 2025, but given its strong economic 
growth in recent years, this may be a conservative estimate. China, India, and 
other non-OECD countries are areas to watch for strong oil demand increases 
in the coming years, increases that will compete with rising OECD demand in a 
tight market supply situation. The EIA anticipates world oil demand to rise to 121 
million bbl per day by 2025, an increase requiring almost 40 million bbl per day 
of extra supply to be largely provided by OPEC’s 70 percent share of estimated 
remaining world oil reserves.43 This has led some to question whether the industri-
alized countries are taking seriously the need to secure future import supplies while 
the rapidly industrializing economies, particularly China, are busy conducting oil 
diplomacy in the Middle East, Asia, Canada, and South America, tying up future 
imports and perhaps sidelining OECD countries.44
Although the U.S. economy is built fundamentally on a petroleum foundation 
today, this may prove unsustainable in the coming decades as mounting resource 
competition drives prices higher. Real questions arise as to how much capital can 
flow out of the United States to sustain future oil import demands before there are 
serious economic consequences. In 2005 alone, nearly $252 billion were spent on 
petroleum and related products imports. Price volatility and the balance of pay-
ments issue, coupled with increasing resource scarcity, paint an uncertain picture. 
Taken together with serious oil-related environmental and geopolitical problems, 
these issues illustrate why lessening oil dependency is in the long-term interest of 
the United States and the entire industrialized world.
Natural Gas
The second major energy sector is natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels. Nat-
ural gas is strategically important because it currently provides 22 percent of total 
U.S. annual primary energy requirements and has over 175 million consumers in 
the residential, commercial, and industrial end-use sectors. Almost everyone in 
the United States benefits from natural gas in some way. This may be due to its 
use in heating and cooling buildings and homes, or the products created from its 
use as a chemical feedstock. Natural gas has also been in greater demand over the 
last decade for electric power generation, rising in recent years to approximately 
17 to 18 percent of total annual megawatt hours generated.45 Electricity capacity 
additions will overwhelmingly come from natural gas-fired plants until 2015, 

238  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
when more coal-fired plants start to come online.46 A very small percentage of 
vehicles have been modified to use natural gas as a transportation fuel, amount-
ing to less than 1 percent of overall consumption. Transportation fuels for exist-
ing vehicle fleets can be made from natural gas using gas-to-liquids technologies, 
and there are those who are calling for more investment in this area to offset 
petroleum dependence.
The United States has the sixth largest conventional natural gas reserves in the 
world, currently estimated to be 193 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and about 3 percent 
of world supply.47 Unconventional natural gas resources should also be included 
in this analysis, since they will constitute the largest domestic source of natural 
gas supplies in the future and expand the resource base possibly as high as 215 tcf 
by 2020, assuming high resource access and improved production technology.48 
Nevertheless, reserve replacements are not always exceeding what is annually pro-
duced, and the current trend for the United States is its outpacing of production 
with consumption. Furthermore, even with new discoveries, the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy assumes that new oil and natural gas discoveries 
will increasingly be smaller, assuming that the largest reserves have already been 
discovered due to extensive exploration in mature basins,49 and new fields and wells 
will peak earlier in their histories because newly discovered reserves will be depleted 
more quickly based on increasing consumption rates.50 In 2004, the United States 
consumed about 22 tcf but only produced 18.7 tcf, meaning the country is import-
ing about 15 percent of its natural gas requirements, mostly from Canada. The EIA 
forecasts domestic natural gas demand to climb to 30.7 tcf per year by 2025, repre-
senting a 26 percent increase from 2005.51 Such demand growth in light of insuf-
ficient domestic natural gas production trends will require more foreign imports. 
According to the EIA, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports are expected to rise 
from well under 5 percent in recent years to account for 20 percent of U.S. natural 
gas supply by 2025.52 The Middle East will play prominently in meeting future 
world LNG needs, possessing over 40 percent of estimated recoverable natural gas 
reserves.
On balance, natural gas offers the United States a mixed bag in relation to its 
energy security. Natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel. The United States 
has large supplies of natural gas, both conventional and unconventional, and thus 
possesses a more advantageous natural gas position than oil position. The main 
short- and mid-term natural gas issues will be restoring hurricane-damaged pro-
duction capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, and accessing the nation’s most remote 
deposits, as in the case of Alaska’s North Slope53 or Gulf of Mexico frontier regions. 
Long-term issues will be the problem of lessening vulnerability to import disrup-
tions, a problem since much of the world’s natural gas reserves are stranded or 
located in geopolitical hot spots.

Electricity
Electricity is the third major energy sector vital to national security. Electricity 
is unlike petroleum and natural gas, in that it is not a primary fuel but must be 
generated from primary energy sources. Like petroleum, electricity is a cornerstone 
of economic development and modern social organization and activity, allowing 
humans to control indoor climates, light millions of dwellings, and power a virtu-
ally endless list of devices and mechanical systems. The U.S. utility industry that 
provides electricity to all end-use sectors is vast. In 2004, more than 136 million 
U.S. consumers purchased over 3,548 million megawatt hours of electricity.54
The electricity sector is characterized by a high degree of interdependency, 
meaning that a power loss in one aspect of the system can result in a cascading 
series of failures elsewhere. Interdependency so defined is “the mutual functional 
reliance of essential services—on other networks, utilities, services, or auxiliary 
nonutility systems.”55 These interdependencies are physical, cyber, geographical, 
and institutional in nature. Cyber interdependencies are increasingly important, as 
banking and finance and e-commerce depend on network reliability and stability. 
Physical interdependencies mean that loss of fuel or power supply can cause cyber 
systems to crash, resulting in the loss of a whole range of dependent services. In 
such scenarios, it is possible that critical communications systems lose capacity or 
all functionality. Additionally, transportation services need electricity for power 
supply and traffic control systems, as in the case of subways, railroads, airports 
and air traffic, energy terminals and seaports, and motor vehicle traffic manage-
ment. Power loss means public and private services of all kinds may be drastically 
reduced or totally ceased, including emergency response, health care, and govern-
ment. Even if there are backup generators for these infrastructures, full services 
may not be restored to levels prior to the blackout and for the duration that may be 
needed—days, weeks, or even months. Loss of electricity is not just inconvenient, 
it can be life threatening. And it can also have costly economic repercussions. Take, 
for example, the worst power failure to ever afflict the United States and Canada, 
which occurred on August 14, 2003. This outage resulted in a loss of electricity to 
over 50 million people, lasted for days in the United States and weeks in Canada, 
and economic damage estimates suggest losses totaling $4 to $10 billion.56 The 
reasons for this blackout were not even clear initially, requiring months of investi-
gation to determine the exact causes and initiating sequences of events. This evolu-
tion of complex, interdependent infrastructures has led to system rigidity, meaning 
there are multitudes of opportunities for disruptions at the same time that there are 
lowering tolerances for disruptions. Centralized generation and control are vulner-
able, in the sense that “failure in one part of the network can spread unpredictably 
almost instantaneously, including to the centralized control elements.”57 This has 
led to the call for highly sophisticated self-healing energy infrastructure networks, 
such that they can identify, isolate, and repair problems closer to their origins and 
thereby optimize system operations through more resiliency.

240  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
The U.S. electricity sector is a network of three major grids, known as the East-
ern, Western, and Texas Interconnections58 or Interconnected Systems, also tied 
in to the Province of Quebec Interconnection. These four main grids comprise an 
interdependent system for the purpose of maximally linking power generation with 
consumer demand over geographically distant locations. The U.S. grid network is 
massive, possessing a generating capacity exceeding 960 gigawatts and valued at 
over $1 trillion in assets.59 Coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants are the most 
important electricity sources in the United States today, with less than 13 percent 
of generation attributed to conventional hydroelectric, renewables, and petroleum. 
Since natural gas has already been discussed as a fuel and energy sector, the remain-
ing focus will be centered on coal and nuclear power given their importance.
Coal
Coal is the world’s most abundant fossil fuel. It is especially plentiful in the United 
States, which has 25 percent of world estimated recoverable reserves, the highest 
of any country and leading many to call the United States the “Saudi Arabia of 
coal.”60 Coal currently provides 23 percent of U.S. total primary energy require-
ments. At present rates of consumption, approximately one billion short tons per 
year, the EIA projects that the United States has over 250 years of coal supplies left, 
far exceeding any of its other fossil fuel reserves. Coal is widely distributed geo-
graphically and relatively cheap to produce, historically providing a cost-effective 
fuel source for large electricity-generating power plants. In fact, coal-fired power 
plants account for approximately 92 percent of U.S. coal consumption and generate 
about half of U.S. electricity, or 1,979 million megawatt hours in 2004. Investment 
in coal-fired power plants slackened in the last decade, primarily owing to high 
capital costs associated with new construction and the fact that natural gas-fired 
plants had become increasingly attractive due to the cleaner nature of their emis-
sions. With the tightening of natural gas supplies in recent years and concomitant 
natural gas price volatility, however, an additional 72 coal-fired power plants are 
planned or under construction61 and most will begin generating electricity in the 
United States after 2015.62 Coal will inevitably be an integral component in meet-
ing tomorrow’s energy needs, and its share of electricity generation will rise through 
at least 2025.
Nuclear Power
U.S. nuclear electric power generation provided over 780 million megawatt hours 
of electricity in 2004 or about 20 percent of total electricity generation.63 The EIA 
projects that no new nuclear plants will be built before 2025, when most “nuclear 
units will be beyond their original license expiration dates.”64 The Three Mile Island 
and Chernobyl incidents highlighted the dangers associated with fission reactors 

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  241
and marred public perceptions of this energy source. The nuclear waste generated 
may also be a trade-off with the lack of greenhouse gas emissions, especially given 
the controversy surrounding siting nuclear waste storage facilities in this country. 
In the new domestic security context defined by the threat of global terrorism, 
expanding nuclear energy’s role in the domestic energy portfolio also raises serious 
national security questions, especially the threat of nuclear proliferation because 
fuel and waste must be transported into and out of facilities.65
Next-generation technologies, such as pebble bed modular reactors that are 
smaller and generate less waste, are touted as “designed for safety, proliferation 
resistance, and ease of operation.”66 Some propose a migration from the present 
petroleum economy to a blended nuclear-hydrogen economy in three or more 
decades, arguing that nuclear energy is the only energy source that would efficiently 
generate the needed amounts of hydrogen while protecting the environment.67 Yet 
public opposition to constructing new nuclear plants remains quite significant in 
the United States, thus nuclear energy’s role in electricity generation is expected 
to fall as more coal and natural gas-fired generation comes online in the next two 
decades.
Critical Infrastructure Protection
This chapter adopts the conventions used in The National Strategy for the Physical 
Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets for the sake of consistency and 
clarity. In particular, that report identified critical infrastructures as the “facilities, 
systems, and functions” comprised of “human assets and physical and cyber sys-
tems that work together in processes that are highly interdependent” and reliant on 
“key nodes” for their operation.68 Nodes can be thought of as hubs,69 or important 
junctions in energy pathways. Nodes are places where lines of connection, otherwise 
thought of as links,70 intersect to convert, divert, gather, store, and transfer power 
or fuels or fuel products through the system. An example of an energy system node 
would be a pumping station along a pipeline route, where the pipeline would be 
the link. Determining whether an infrastructure is critical in nature hinges upon 
whether its destruction results in a disruption “to the continuity of critical services 
at the national level,”71 thereby constituting a national security threat. In reality, 
there are uncertainties associated with determining the status of an infrastructure 
and thus the potential to exclude vital and vulnerable infrastructures.72 Beyond 
critical infrastructure, key assets are “individual targets whose attack—in worst-
case scenarios—could result in not only large-scale human casualties and property 
destruction, but also profound damage to our national prestige, morale, and confi-
dence,” such as pertains to nuclear power plants and dams.73
The United States has no shortage of energy infrastructure to contend for critical 
or key asset status. In fact, the system is so vast and so complex that it would be impos-

242  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
sible to protect all of it at every point in space and time. To put the scale of the problem 
into context, here are some key U.S. statistics and observations:74
More than 2,000,000 miles of pipelines transport oil, natural gas, conden-
sate, refined products, hydrogen, and other hazardous materials.
Major oil pipelines transport over two-thirds of the nation’s shipped oil volumes 
through 161,000 miles of pipe. Refined products pipelines span over 95,000 
miles. Additionally, there are 1,400,000 miles of natural gas pipelines that 
move almost all of the natural gas transported throughout the United States. 
Nearly half of the natural gas pipeline system traverses commercial and public 
infrastructure, such as airports, businesses, and highways.
Roughly 700,000 oil and natural gas wells are classed as active. Drilling 
activity has been on the rise in recent years, with nearly 41,000 new wells 
drilled in 2005 alone.
2,000 petroleum storage terminals and 17 LNG facilities are operated nation-
wide. Another 38 LNG terminals are either proposed or approved.
More than 17,000,000 bbl of oil are refined per day at 151 operable refineries. 
Forty-three percent of this total is processed by clusters of refineries located 
along the Gulf of Mexico between Alabama and Texas, with the majority 
concentrated in Louisiana and Texas.
There are 580 natural gas plants that treat more than 60 billion cubic feet 
daily. More than 50 percent of the total is treated by plants located in just two 
states: Louisiana and Texas.
Approximately 11,000 conventional coal, petroleum, natural gas, and dual-
fired electric power plants are operated by more than 3,000 independent util-
ities. Electricity is routed over approximately 181,000 miles of high-voltage 
transmission lines. There are millions of miles of distribution lines to homes 
and businesses.
Sixty-five percent of coal is shipped by railroad, at least for part of its journey. 
Varying regionally, some utilities have only one or two railroads that provide 
coal deliveries for their area.
There are 104 nuclear reactors in operation, and 36 more research and test 
reactors are located primarily at educational institutions.
Though infrastructures on this scale make system-wide protection daunting, 
what is at issue is the preservation of key services to populations, thereby making 
the identification of critical nodes more important than protecting every link. Auer-
swald et al. persuasively argue that “the policy goal should be to build capabilities 
for the prevention of attacks that interrupt such services and for effective response 
and rapid recovery when such attacks do occur.”75 Besides, it is not entirely clear 
that all possible threats and vulnerabilities to energy infrastructures can be identi-
fied and quantified.76 This shifts the focus to planning for worst-case scenarios and 
improving system security margins for the most critical nodes.

Protecting the energy system is complicated by bureaucratic confusion. The 
agencies and departments responsible for regulating the energy industry and 
coordinating critical infrastructure protection comprise a complex and entangl-
ing network. The list begins with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of Energy (DOE), the 
Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission (FERC), the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners 
(NARUC), the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), and the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but a host of other federal and state agen-
cies are also involved.
President George W. Bush’s National Energy Policy Development Group 
released a comprehensive report77 on U.S. energy policy in 2001, but it failed 
to address substantively this issue of bureaucratic overlap and confusion. San-
dia National Laboratories subsequently studied the problem in depth and 
determined:78
The energy infrastructure as a system has lost integrity. No individual 
organization has full responsibility for its maintenance and reliability. 
… With a market, rather than national, focus on energy, there is little 
interest in energy security. In the absence of actual dramatic attacks, it 
is difficult to persuade taxpayers that the public should pay for infra-
structure security improvements.
Because most of the energy infrastructure in the United States is privately 
owned, its protection has in fact been left primarily to the private sector. Therein 
resides a central problem, in that “energy industries have secured their assets and 
operations against ordinary threats such as theft, low-level vandalism, and com-
mercial espionage. To do so, relatively modest efforts were all that were required, 
and less-than-perfect prevention was acceptable.”79 The emergence of globally 
connected terror groups has changed the internal logic of this approach. Indeed, 
private industry’s preoccupation with increasing efficiencies by minimizing costs 
and eliminating uneconomic redundancies narrows security margins, and in effect 
increases the vulnerabilities.
Critical Vulnerabilities and Homeland 
Security Implications
Some of the most significant vulnerabilities have been assessed authoritatively by 
the National Research Council’s Committee on Science and Technology for Coun-
tering Terrorism, subsequently referred to here as the Committee.80 This body’s 

244  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
main assessments of the nation’s most crucial energy sectors are summarized briefly 
below.
The petroleum sector’s most vulnerable infrastructures are refineries and pipe-
line pumping stations. Their vulnerability to physical attack is well understood 
given that these are large and high-value fixed targets. The Committee noted that 
refinery densities along the Gulf Coast create vulnerability, especially since they 
serve as critical nodes in oil and refined products supply chains to the populous 
Northeast. Refineries and pipelines are also vulnerable to cyber attack, given that 
they rely heavily on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) computer 
systems for monitoring and control, typically in relation to geographically dispersed 
infrastructures.81 SCADA systems are especially vulnerable as they are moved from 
standalone mainframe systems to integration with a company’s main systems, vul-
nerable to intranet and possibly Internet subterfuge.82 Such integration can have its 
bureaucratic rationale, but nevertheless opens the door for cyber attacks.
The natural gas sector is more vulnerable than the petroleum sector because it 
lacks the same storage infrastructures and import capacities. Identified as potential 
targets vitally important to the U.S. energy system are key links, such as trans-
mission pipelines, and key nodes, such as pipeline interconnections, compressor 
stations, city gate stations, LNG terminals, and SCADA control systems. The 
Committee particularly stressed that “a well-planned and coordinated terrorist 
attack could take out the nation’s gas transmission systems and keep key pipelines 
out of service for an extended period of time,” resulting in “enormous personal and 
economic damage.”83
Finally, the electricity sector is vulnerable in relation to physical and cyber 
attacks, plus the additional threat posed by electromagnetic attack. The highly cen-
tralized nature of power generation in the United States, as opposed to distributed 
generation, means that large power plants, substations, and important transmission 
lines are obvious physical targets. Moreover, other critical nodes such as control 
centers present special protection challenges, because they are vulnerable to physi-
cal, cyber, and electromagnetic attack. SCADA is also employed in the electricity 
sector, and may well be the Achilles’ heel of the energy system. A worst-case sce-
nario would be simultaneous attacks on multiple nodes, perhaps bringing down an 
entire grid or multiple grids. An attack on one or more nuclear power plants is a 
variant on this theme. In fact, disabling multiple nuclear power plants could take 
significant amounts of electricity off the grid, not to mention result in great loss 
of life. In such a scenario, classifying nuclear power plants as key assets instead of 
critical infrastructure becomes meaningless.
The National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP) also made important 
assessments regarding strengthening the U.S. energy system. Although the NCEP 
made a host of recommendations to government and private-sector decision mak-
ers, NCEP analysis of three key issue areas bears upon the current topic of critical 
infrastructure protection. First, the NCEP recommends greater efficiency in siting 
energy infrastructure, often hampered by public opposition and lengthy bureau-

Redefining U.S. Energy Security in the Twenty-First Century  n  245
cratic impediments. Chronic siting problems can lead to protracted delays across 
every aspect of the energy system, but the most significant siting problems pertain 
to “high voltage electricity transmission lines … new LNG facilities, and high-level 
nuclear waste storage.”84 Second, the NCEP urges greater attention to protecting 
the most valuable infrastructure that is likely to be targeted by terrorists. NCEP 
policy recommendations include identifying cyber vulnerabilities in relation to 
control systems, examining surveillance options for monitoring energy infrastruc-
ture, threat simulation development and analysis to predict and prepare for various 
disruptions and possible attacks, and deployment of multisensor warning systems 
to move toward self-healing systems. Third, the NCEP report acknowledges the 
problem presented by lack of diversification in transportation fuels. Such reliance 
on one fuel source creates vulnerability, especially as regards tight refining capacity. 
Since there have been no new refineries built in the United States since the 1970s, 
there is a need to expand this capacity and also move toward diversifying transpor-
tation fuels and producing them domestically.
Summary Conclusions
From the standpoint of U.S. vital interests, energy security ranks among the most 
paramount. The tremendous instabilities in the Middle East and other oil produc-
ing regions, as well as the dangerous rise of globally connected terror groups that 
target energy infrastructure, represent new challenges. Given the U.S. fuel posi-
tions and current energy policies, protecting the most critical infrastructure nodes 
is an urgent problem. It will not be feasible to protect the entire energy system, 
especially when supply chains span the globe. Policy must also address stronger 
security margins, a real problem given the scale of U.S. infrastructure and vulner-
abilities in the petroleum, natural gas, and electricity sectors.
The fossil fuels appear to be the fuels that will supply the majority of U.S. 
primary energy requirements through at least 2025. U.S. coal resources are the 
largest in the world, but natural gas and petroleum estimated proved reserves are 
not able to supply demand. The United States is thus in a situation where its reli-
ance on foreign fuel imports will grow significantly over the next twenty years, 
and likely beyond until world oil midpoint depletion occurs. The problem is that 
world peak oil is estimated to occur by 2040, given EIA data and assumptions, 
though some analysts warn that this estimate is too optimistic. Even assuming 
the optimists are correct, U.S. policymakers may only have about three decades to 
have the research, development, phase-in, and wide deployment of the necessary 
next-generation alternative fuels in place. Some envision transition to a hydrogen 
economy, but generating enough hydrogen in an economic and environmentally 
sensitive way faces many hurdles and perhaps a fifty-year transition period.85 Thus, 
renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, will almost certainly be an impor-
tant part of the intermediate transition away from petroleum addiction, but more  

246  n  Terrorism and Homeland Security
funding needs to be directed toward this end. Current U.S. energy policy is one of 
primarily encouraging the growth of the fossil fuels industry and allowing markets 
and the private sector to largely steer the nation’s energy policy. Markets do not 
always flexibly reorient themselves to changing circumstances and necessities, and 
this may be compounded by the absence of clear market signals in relation to peak 
oil. Moreover, the private sector will be preoccupied with the tremendous challenge 
of exploiting remaining opportunities that coincide with the nation’s established 
hydrocarbon-dominated energy system. Visionary public policy is needed that 
understands the new energy exigencies of this century, and creates and implements 
strategic energy policy to integrate more alternative and renewable resources into 
the nation’s energy portfolio. Policymakers need to be thinking this way now, not 
thirty years down the road when it might be too late.
The United States is in a state of deepening energy insecurity. Stability in the 
vital regions that serve the international petroleum and natural gas markets will 
not be enough, even if this is possible to achieve. The U.S. energy system is almost 
certainly going to transition this century, whether imposed exogenously by events 
or purposively by leadership. Let us hope tomorrow’s policymakers understand this 
and develop the strategy necessary to protect the long-term interests of the United 
States.

tion by 2010 are Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrère. The world peak oil debate 
is hotly contested, and there is no consensus that world oil production will reach its 
peak by 2010. Campbell first fueled the fires of the current peak oil controversy when 
he published The Coming Oil Crisis (Essex: Multi-Science Publishing Company & 
Petroconsultants S.A., 1997). Campbell and Laherrère followed this with a short

bid to acquire the United States’ eighth largest oil company, Unocal. Amid fears 
widely spouted in the U.S. Congress that such a merger needed to be prevented as a 
matter of vital U.S. energy security, there are many reasons to believe that this argu-
ment has been very thinly presented. The Economist makes the logical case that as a 
result of “denying China access to energy assets through legitimate means, America 
might expose itself to bigger threats. Some think that China might now seek energy 
security more aggressively; for instance, by competing more directly for access to 
the oil and gas from Russia and Central Asia that the West so prizes.” For more see

Afterword
Terrorism and Securing 
the Homeland
Michael A. Opheim and Nicholas H. Bowen
“Fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper. You can make a hundred 
brilliant saves but the only shot that people remember is the one that 
gets past you.”
—Paul Wilkinson
In Lewis Carroll’s classic novel, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Alice becomes 
lost, only to happen upon a Cheshire Cat sitting on a tree branch. “Would you 
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” inquires Alice. “That depends 
a good deal on where you want to get to,” responds the Cat. “I don’t much care 
where,” replies Alice. “Then it doesn’t matter much where you go,” reasons the Cat. 
“So long as I get somewhere,” Alice added. “Oh, you’re sure to do that, if you only 
walk long enough,” the Cat said grinning.
Much like Alice, the United States still stands at a fork in the road years after 
the tragic events of 9/11. An absence of strategic thinking continues to permeate 
the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. Despite the rhetorical flourish of most 
politicians and decision makers, this dearth of profound strategic thinking at the 
highest levels of government has prevented the United States from exploring all of 
its options in the post-9/11 national security environment. There cannot be any 
doubt that countries do not effectively chart a direction if they have not agreed on 
a final destination. Gone are the early heydays of the Cold War when President 
Harry Truman was able to fashion bipartisan support for what became the long-
standing policy of containment. Rather, there exists today a situation in which the 
two major U.S. political parties are engaged in bitter partisan politics, unwilling 

254  n  Afterword
or unable to engage in a bold, imaginative strategic debate necessary for any future 
understanding of homeland security.
The contributors to this volume have called for a new strategic vision for dealing 
with terrorism—homeland security situated within a multinational context. The 
response thus far to the events of 9/11 still falls short. Efforts thus far do not serve 
adequately U.S. national interests, particularly in light of continued opposition to 
the United States, both at home and abroad not only from adversaries, but also 
from allies and other friendly countries.
A more systematic examination of the threat, the capabilities of the United 
States and its friends and allies, as well as a more thorough understanding of those 
active hostile forces against the United States would have been preferable. Robert 
Dorff is absolutely right to suggest that strategy can be neither rigid nor dogmatic. 
This is especially true today where unpredictability is the norm. Strategizing is a 
dynamic process. So, with a host of challenges and amorphous threats, the present 
environment defies easy characterization, further necessitating the need for sound 
analytical thought.
The contributors to this volume have underscored in Part 1 the importance 
of developing a comprehensive and dynamic strategy for securing the homeland. 
Strategy for homeland security begins with the causes—grievances or interests—
that motivate the formation of groups, movements, or insurgencies prone to use 
terror and other forms of political violence to serve their aims. Terrorism and weap-
ons of mass destruction are the focus of Part 2; the safeguarding of society and its 
infrastructure is addressed in Part 3.
But it is not just a matter of thinking strategically; it is about acting strategically 
as well. Although no attempt has been made here to impose a particular strategy or 
strategic view of homeland security, the book is a clarion call for policies driven by 
a greater strategic understanding of what is at issue and what is to be done. Devel-
oping such strategy is (to say the least) overdue. Assuring national security requires 
attention to the homeland and looking abroad to the sources of terrorism, as well 
as taking steps domestically to prevent, limit damage, and manage consequences 
of terrorist and other threats to the country. In pursuing this purpose, strategy 
needs to be understood as an ongoing, flexible process aiming to match appropriate 
means to the ends we pursue.
With an inward focus, some regard homeland security as consisting largely 
of domestic or internal efforts and policy initiatives that deal with protecting the 
country’s population and critical infrastructure—national, state, and local mea-
sures to prevent, limit damage, and manage consequences. Others have sought to 
secure the homeland primarily by taking an externally focused, macro-approach—
pursuing aggressively a “global war on terror” (or, as we prefer to call it, a campaign 
against groups, movements, and insurgencies using terror and other forms of politi-
cal violence to advance their aims). As Terrence O’Sullivan and Greg Moser make 
clear, however, focusing primarily on the dangers of international terrorism creates 
a policy imbalance that underemphasizes (and underfunds) domestic preparations 

Afterword  n  255
for a wide spectrum of hazards that continues to grow. What is needed, of course, 
is strategy that contains both of these internal and external elements.
As with many issues relating to government, progress has been greater in certain 
areas of the homeland-security effort than in others. Most of the core competen-
cies of homeland security are addressed by the contributors to this volume. Both 
Dorff and Viotti correctly observe that any proper assessment of homeland security 
must be made in a strategic context—a position with which all of our contributors 
would concur. Indeed, waging defense requires an overarching strategy along with 
practical, affordable tactics in pursuit of homeland-security objectives—a systematic 
understanding of ends, ways, and means. Ends are defined as the objectives or goals 
sought; means are categorized as the resources available to pursue the objectives; and 
ways are described as the concepts or methods for how one organizes and applies 
the resources.
Any examination of strategy is an admission that individuals have a discern-
ible role to play. As our coeditor has observed elsewhere: “Strategy is a voluntarist 
formulation by which states (i.e., their government officials) try to maximize their 
positions, achieving at least an adequate degree of security or defense capability in 
a potentially hostile world.”1 To be sure, political leaders exercising their will are 
often constrained by events in both the domestic and the external arenas. Never-
theless, our contributors would adhere to the notion that “formulation of a strategy 
amounts to an assertion that statesmen can make a difference.”2 We might also 
extend this to decision makers at the state and local levels who have a myriad num-
ber of responsibilities in ensuring domestic preparedness against a growing array of 
hazards and disaster consequences. Simply put, leadership matters.
Leadership is particularly vital in developing clear, unambiguous objectives, a 
crucial element since ends matter. Indeed, ends matter most3 and utilizing effec-
tive means to these ends helps to shape the strategic environment. Means must be 
practical and part of an overall organizational architecture designed to bring about 
the implementation of policy based on sound strategy. They involve diplomatic, 
economic, informational, and military courses of action.
An international focus must permeate all aspects of United States security strat-
egy. Securing borders is important but insufficient. Providing security for day-to-
day domestic processes and networks of communication and action is impossible 
without multinational and transnational cooperation, as explored by Veronica 
Kitchen and Gregory Moore. If the viability of terrorism can be undermined as a 
means toward political ends pursued by U.S. adversaries, the United States will be 
more secure. It is for this reason that what Paul Viotti calls a comprehensive and 
dynamic U.S. strategy for dealing with hostile groups, movements, or insurgencies 
in the post-9/11 world is so important to assuring American homeland security.
Hard decisions regarding ends, ways, and means have to be made, particularly 
since all countries are resource-constrained—none possessing an infinite quantity 
of needed resources.4 Developing strategy is all the more difficult given the frag-
mentation of political authority and the bureaucratic proliferation of competing 

256  n  Afterword
governmental actors that occur under federalism and a separation of powers. Some 
authors observe how catastrophic events in the United States since 9/11, such as 
Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters, continue to show the wholesale 
organizational failures of multiple levels of U.S., state and local government, and 
private-sector institutions. With 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina now in the past, the 
United States unfortunately has yet to come to grips fully with the theoretical and 
practical challenges posed by these monumental events.
When considering the import of these episodes on U.S. foreign and national 
security policy, it is critical to remember that the United States does not operate in a 
vacuum. Not only do U.S. actions have external, sometimes adverse, effects on oth-
ers, but also reactions from abroad can blow back with negative consequences for the 
United States. While domestic measures designed to safeguard people and critical 
infrastructure at home likely will not elicit much foreign opposition, counterterror-
ist actions taken abroad—the “away game” element of homeland security—impacts 
other populations within which target groups, movements, or insurgencies operate, 
often with adverse consequences. Indeed, effective implementation of a compre-
hensive strategy to secure the homeland is fraught with difficulties that require 
adept and flexible handling by policy makers sensitive to these complexities.
Daniel M. Gerstein notes that in this Information Age how strategy will be 
received internationally must be an important component for consideration. Thus, 
owing to the increasing influence of globalization, he includes the geo-strategic 
environment along with the more traditional ends, ways, and means. Gerstein 
emphasizes his point by observing:
Ends, ways, and means all apply to the country developing the strategy. 
The ends are the desired outcomes from the perspective of the country 
developing the strategy. The means are the resources and the ways are 
the processes or techniques that will be employed; but both of these 
are also “owned” by the country developing the strategy. So, where 
do we consider how the strategy will be received internationally? Or 
whether, in the case of conflict, the desired ends are even feasible for 
the country.5
While we can expect U.S. policymakers to continue to act in accordance with 
what they believe to be the best interests of the country, our authors see them as 
better served in most cases by seeking partners for multilateral actions rather than 
by acting unilaterally. It is an indicator of strength, not weakness, to be in a posi-
tion to assemble coalitions—an acknowledgment that it is usually better to work in 
concert with allies and other coalition partners.
Although our contributing authors agree that homeland security strategizing 
must focus on the deterrence (or dissuasion) and prevention of terrorist attacks, 
much needs to be done to mitigate the impact and manage the consequences of 

Afterword  n  257
terrorist attacks that do occur. Indeed, our contributors see the role of private citi-
zens as an essential part of preserving civil society—an educated public the best 
defense against the spread of fear. Efforts to empower the public are as much a part 
of damage limitation as measures to blunt the physical effects of terrorist attacks. 
It is indicative of the fact that little will change in a positive direction if elites and 
citizens alike remain too set in their outmoded ways of thinking.
In any war or military campaign, the operational and logistical elements of 
conducting war have traditionally received the greatest amount of attention. In 
the current struggle, however, we cannot allow ourselves to be locked into that 
mindset because the nature of the conflict is so fundamentally different. The cam-
paign against those using terror and other forms of political violence goes beyond 
the scope of any single battlefield. So, the instruments used to wage this particular 
campaign will differ from those applicable to other conflicts. We cannot be caught 
fighting the last war. While Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest talked 
about getting there the “firstest with the mostest,” it is perhaps this “forgotten” 
social dimension of warfare that perhaps emerges as one of the most important.6 
Undoubtedly, addressing grievances that give rise to terrorist actions must be a 
fundamental tenet of any successful security strategy.
As our coeditor stated in the Introduction, we make no pretense here about 
offering a grand strategy for homeland security in the twenty-first century. Our 
objective is more modest. Rather, we seek only to identify the variables or factors 
critical in formulating a comprehensive strategy for homeland security policy. So, 
what are these essential elements that can be distilled from the foregoing analysis?
	
1.	Strategic thinking must be dynamic. Clausewitz talked about incidents accu-
mulating in war that undercut in practice the effectiveness of efforts to 
achieve desired objectives. When implemented plans made in advance nec-
essarily confront friction—unforeseen obstacles that can mar or even blunt 
their effectiveness. It is this concept of friction that separates war gaming in 
concept from the real-world heat of battle. When possible, exercises or prac-
tice implementations of plans can help us identify errors, leading to revisions 
of particular plans and even the strategy of which they are a part. Of course, 
friction can never be eliminated entirely, not to mention the uncertainties 
captured by the Clausewitzian “fog of war.” There is no shame, then, in devi-
ating from the battle plan if the battle plan itself exhibits deficiencies, as it 
almost certainly will. So, a certain amount of flexibility must be built into the 
implementation process. Decision makers must not eschew open discourse 
as a more thorough airing of views has the virtue of mitigating the worst 
excesses of potentially devastating strategic miscalculation.
	
2.	To be truly comprehensive, the “home” and “away games” of security policy should 
be merged more closely together. Homeland security issues transcend boundar-
ies like never before. Veronica Kitchen and Gregory Moore note the distinc-
tion between antiterrorism policy made by the Department of Homeland 

258  n  Afterword
Security (DHS), the FBI, and the Justice Department, and counterterror-
ism, largely under the purview of the State Department, Defense Depart-
ment (DoD), and the CIA. DHS is also charged with the homeland security 
tasks of protecting the borders as well as the interior of the country, while 
DoD (especially its Northern Command) remains responsible for homeland 
defense. Increasingly, distinction among these realms seems at best artificial, 
if not dysfunctional. But, the difference is real to those officials who toil in 
their respective departments. This can be problematic if little discussion is 
taking place across these various agencies, especially if their greatest concern 
becomes in day-to-day practice the protection not so much of the homeland, 
but rather of their respective bureaucratic turfs. Moreover, homeland security 
in a multinational context must incorporate both the home and away games 
if it is to be truly effective over the long term. While changes have occurred 
in the aftermath of 9/11, it is still the case that the security architecture of 
the United States remains woefully inadequate organizationally for the chal-
lenges in the present and beyond.
	
3.	Education is a vital part of preserving civil society. In fact, education could be con-
sidered the cornerstone of any effective homeland security strategy. Many con-
tributors emphasized several different aspects of education. David Goldfischer 
makes the case that homeland security education can “build and improve inte-
grated networks within and between allied states.” With greater emphasis on 
education, the United States can perhaps change its culture to one that more 
fully embraces homeland security and defense. This is true particularly in the 
aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita which served as clarion calls to action. 
Smith and Talbot make the case that education can play an important role in 
marginalizing the message of the terrorist. Fred Wehling and Jeremy Tamsett 
argue that to be forewarned is to be forearmed. By educating the public as to 
the danger of radiation hazards before an attack, we are more likely to prevent 
mass confusion and chaos than if no information had been disseminated. Sci-
ence and health curricula can be established in both private and public schools. 
In this way, a sustained policy of education can mitigate the worst effects of an 
attack. For their part, Alexander Diener and Timothy Crawford cogently note 
the work of vibrant civic groups free from governmental control as being at the 
center of civil defense education programs. With civil defense comes a sense of 
civic responsibility. To the extent more citizens and organizations are involved 
with homeland security so much the better.
	
4.	We must not confuse strategizing about homeland security with a “War on Ter-
ror.” Such an approach misses the point that one cannot wage war against 
a tactic. Although perhaps an effective rhetorical device, such erroneous 
characterizations cause the focus of effort to be misplaced. Instead, what is 
required is a better understanding of the groups and insurgents responsible 
for engaging in such action. Larsen and Wirtz examine the goals and tech-
niques of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda along with a thorough analysis of 

Afterword  n  259
how terrorism has changed over time. Terrorists are not stupid. Rather, they 
are engaged in the rational use of the irrational. By understanding their goals 
and motivations, as well as working to the greatest extent possible to drain the 
swamp of grievances in which terrorists reside, great strides can potentially be 
made in a wide-ranging campaign against terrorism. At the same time, craft-
ing a strategy that focuses on the hard core, seemingly irreconcilable terrorist 
leadership and organization is equally necessary.
	
5.	Globalization is a double-edged sword. To the extent globalization is equated 
with Westernization (or even Americanization), the United States might be 
viewed negatively by those unable or unwilling to hop aboard the global-
ization train. Globalization is often looked upon as positive because it has 
brought about enormous tangible benefits to great numbers in the world in 
the economic as well as social domain. But, globalization is equally threaten-
ing to the life-style and customs of traditional societies. More than anything, 
figuring out how traditional values and modernity can coexist in the twenty-
first century will be a primary challenge for the international community. 
Joseph Szyliowicz discusses how technological progress in transportation and 
telecommunications has increased the level and scale of globalization. Simi-
larly, Kevin King observes how energy flows and related infrastructures have 
also become very global in scope. Put another way, what were once national 
issues are now worldwide in scope. Due to increasing integration of energy, 
transportation modes (air, rail, road, and sea), and telecommunications, these 
systems provide more tempting targets now compared to even just a few years 
ago. That someone with a backpack and some explosives can cause so much 
death and destruction to people and the infrastructure on which they depend 
makes clear how vulnerable we are. Lest we focus only on explosives, Terrence 
O’Sullivan also reminds us of the threat from catastrophic infectious disease 
outbreaks, including both the naturally occurring disease threats, such as 
SARS, as well as bioterrorism. In short, while many may be prone to extol the 
virtues of globalization, we need also to expose this adverse side of the global-
ization coin—that increasing interconnectedness increases vulnerability to 
terrorist or other forms of political violence both at home and abroad.
	
6.	Cooperation is the key. An important tactic in homeland security is the lead-
ership recognizing that all of us are in this together, which makes us all part 
of an effective response to the threats and challenges to civil society. Greg 
Moser emphasizes the relations between the federal, state, and local authori-
ties in dealing with preventing, mitigating, preparing for, and responding 
to an attack on U. S. critical infrastructure. Typically, we think of coopera-
tion between governments, but establishing and nurturing links beyond the 
intergovernmental are equally critical. Or, as Veronica Kitchen and Gregory 
Moore put it, cooperation must be both multinational and transnational, 
encompassing networks at all levels of government. Certainly more work 
can be accomplished to forge and sustain these external links important to 

260  n  Afterword
dealing with the gravity of the problem, especially in areas such as intel-
ligence, law enforcement, and judicial action, and protecting energy, trans-
portation, telecommunications, and other infrastructures and networks.
	
7.	Don’t lose sight of civil liberties. As Benjamin Franklin cogently noted, “They 
who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve nei-
ther liberty nor security.” So, how do we balance civil liberties with the need 
for social protection? The 9/11 episode demonstrates the need for discussion. 
The Patriot Act was passed quickly following the 9/11 attacks. Subsequently 
amended, statutory expansion of what many see as intrusive law-enforcement 
measures remain in place—not to mention those pursued without legal cer-
tification. In short, the appropriate balance between security measures taken 
by state authorities and the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties 
remains an unresolved, highly controversial set of issues.
Be that as it may, developing an effective strategy to secure the homeland 
requires a multifaceted approach on the part of the United States. Without a doubt, 
the military dimension is important when the nation is faced with an irreconcil-
able enemy that eschews any form of negotiation, but it is equally important in this 
long-term campaign for the United States to consider other, nonmilitary measures 
that address the social dimension of the problem abroad and at home.
More often than not, unilateral measures on the part of the United States play 
into the hands of adversaries, particularly those using terror or other forms of political 
violence. Because other countries also have felt the wrath of terrorist actions or expect 
they may do so in the future, there is common ground on which to cultivate allies and 
coalition partners—a foundation on which to build solidarity against the threat as 
well as being an important source of support.  We offer a quote commonly attributed 
to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “It is better to jaw jaw than to war 
war.” A multilateral approach facilitates greater cooperation when needed not only in 
the combat arena, but also in diplomatic actions, intelligence sharing, law enforce-
ment, military and police training, civic actions, and other collaborative pursuits.
The contributions of Carl von Clausewitz have been cited in numerous places 
throughout this work. But, perhaps it is to Sun Tzu that we may owe an even greater 
debt. In this age of asymmetric terrorist warfare, he reminded us that we need to 
know ourselves and our enemy, and that we will not succeed if we know neither. 
Ultimately, we need to avoid fighting the last war. Although the political tremors of 
the Cold War are largely over, the political earthquakes that have emerged in its wake 
are only beginning. Learning how to deal with challenges posed by nonstate actors 
using terror and other forms of political violence have thus far been a work in progress 
for the leading countries of the world. Alice may not have cared where she needed to 
go. The United States, however, cannot afford that luxury. It must examine the path 
itself and the direction it is taking if the journey in this twenty-first century is to be 
a positive one.

work; (2) strategists must learn while doing in order to avoid being trapped in a bad

that will be vital in guiding the development of any new security strategy. They are: 
(1) Foundations—because values and ideals form an important part of the U.S. char-
acter, any future strategy cannot ignore ideology; (2) Transparency—information 
technologies such as Radio Free Europe will multiply and lead to more accountability 
of leaders and individuals. However, we must be mindful that it will also have the 
effect of limiting flexibility of action; (3) Perspective—Besides looking at issues from 
a calculation of national interests, an effective strategy would be to look at the world 
from the perspective of others; (4) Legitimacy—Are the actions perceived to be for 
the greater good or perceived as self-interest. However, exceptions can be made, such 
as the U.S. operation in Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11; (5) Balance—Strike a 
balance between the elements of power internally and competing interests around the 
globe. The key is to ensure the United States avoids a short-term view of events against 
a foe adopting a more long-term orientation. pp.136-141. This is not to say that each 
of these points will necessarily be adopted. More than anything, it is an acknowledg-
ment that to play an effective role, the United States may have to rethink some aspects 
of past policies in a new era.

The National Strategy 
for Homeland Security
This is an Executive Summary of this document first prepared in 2002. The full text is 
at WhiteHouse.gov.
This document is the first National Strategy for Homeland Security. The purpose 
of the Strategy is to mobilize and organize our Nation to secure the U.S. homeland 
from terrorist attacks. This is an exceedingly complex mission that requires coordi-
nated and focused effort from our entire society—the federal government, state and 
local governments, the private sector, and the American people.1
People and organizations all across the United States have taken many steps 
to improve our security since the September 11 attacks, but a great deal of work 
remains. The National Strategy for Homeland Security will help to prepare our 
Nation for the work ahead in several ways. It provides direction to the federal 
government departments and agencies that have a role in homeland security. It sug-
gests steps that state and local governments, private companies and organizations, 
and individual Americans can take to improve our security and offers incentives 
for them to do so. It recommends certain actions to the Congress. In this way, the 
Strategy provides a framework for the contributions that we all can make to secure 
our homeland.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security is the beginning of what will be a 
long struggle to protect our Nation from terrorism. It establishes a foundation upon 
which to organize our efforts and provides initial guidance to prioritize the work 
ahead. The Strategy will be adjusted and amended over time. We must be prepared 
to adapt as our enemies in the war on terrorism alter their means of attack.

264  n  Appendix
Strategic Objectives
The strategic objectives of homeland security in order of priority are to:
Prevent terrorist attacks within the United States;
Reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism; and
Minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur.
Threat and Vulnerability
Unless we act to prevent it, a new wave of terrorism, potentially involving the 
world’s most destructive weapons, looms in America’s future. It is a challenge as 
formidable as any ever faced by our Nation. But we are not daunted. We possess the 
determination and the resources to defeat our enemies and secure our homeland 
against the threats they pose.
One fact dominates all homeland security threat assessments: terrorists are stra-
tegic actors. They choose their targets deliberately based on the weaknesses they 
observe in our defenses and our preparedness. We must defend ourselves against 
a wide range of means and methods of attack. Our enemies are working to obtain 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons for the purpose of wreaking 
unprecedented damage on America. Terrorists continue to employ conventional 
means of attack, while at the same time gaining expertise in less traditional means, 
such as cyber attacks. Our society presents an almost infinite array of potential 
targets that can be attacked through a variety of methods.
Our enemies seek to remain invisible, lurking in the shadows. We are actively 
engaged in uncovering them. Al-Qaeda remains America’s most immediate and 
serious threat despite our success in disrupting its network in Afghanistan and 
elsewhere. Other international terrorist organizations, as well as domestic terrorist 
groups, possess the will and capability to attack the United States.
Organizing for a Secure Homeland
In response to the homeland security challenge facing us, the President has pro-
posed, and the Congress is presently considering, the most extensive reorganiza-
tion of the federal government in the past fifty years. The establishment of a new 
Department of Homeland Security would ensure greater accountability over criti-
cal homeland security missions and unity of purpose among the agencies respon-
sible for them.2
American democracy is rooted in the precepts of federalism—a system of gov-
ernment in which our state governments share power with federal institutions. Our 
structure of overlapping federal, state, and local governance—our country has more 

Appendix  n  265
than 87,000 different jurisdictions—provides unique opportunity and challenges 
for our homeland security efforts. The opportunity comes from the expertise and 
commitment of local agencies and organizations involved in homeland security. 
The challenge is to develop interconnected and complementary systems that are 
reinforcing rather than duplicative and that ensure essential requirements are met. 
A national strategy requires a national effort.
State and local governments have critical roles to play in homeland security. 
Indeed, the closest relationship the average citizen has with government is at the 
local level. State and local levels of government have primary responsibility for 
funding, preparing, and operating the emergency services that would respond in 
the event of a terrorist attack. Local units are the first to respond, and the last to 
leave the scene. All disasters are ultimately local events.
The private sector—the Nation’s principal provider of goods and services and 
owner of 85 percent of our infrastructure—is a key homeland security partner. It 
has a wealth of information that is important to the task of protecting the United 
States from terrorism. Its creative genius will develop the information systems, vac-
cines, detection devices, and other technologies and innovations that will secure 
our homeland.
An informed and proactive citizenry is an invaluable asset for our country in 
times of war and peace. Volunteers enhance community coordination and action, 
whether at the national or local level. This coordination will prove critical as 
we work to build the communication and delivery systems indispensable to our 
national effort to detect, prevent, and, if need be, respond to terrorist attack.
Critical Mission Areas
The National Strategy for Homeland Security aligns and focuses homeland secu-
rity functions into six critical mission areas: intelligence and warning, border 
and transportation security, domestic counterterrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure, defending against catastrophic terrorism, and emergency preparedness 
and response. The first three mission areas focus primarily on preventing terrorist 
attacks; the next two on reducing our Nation’s vulnerabilities; and the final one on 
minimizing the damage and recovering from attacks that do occur. The Strategy 
provides a framework to align the resources of the federal budget directly to the 
task of securing the homeland.
Intelligence and Warning. Terrorism depends on surprise. With it, a terrorist 
attack has the potential to do massive damage to an unwitting and unprepared tar-
get. Without it, the terrorists stand a good chance of being preempted by authori-
ties, and even if they are not, the damage that results from their attacks is likely 
to be less severe. The United States will take every necessary action to avoid being 
surprised by another terrorist attack. We must have an intelligence and warning 

266  n  Appendix
system that can detect terrorist activity before it manifests itself in an attack so that 
proper preemptive, preventive, and protective action can be taken.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies five major initiatives in 
this area:
Enhance the analytic capabilities of the FBI;
Build new capabilities through the Information Analysis and Infrastructure 
Protection Division of the proposed Department of Homeland Security;
Implement the Homeland Security Advisory System;
Utilize dual-use analysis to prevent attacks; and
Employ “red team” techniques.
Border and Transportation Security. America historically has relied heavily on 
two vast oceans and two friendly neighbors for border security, and on the private 
sector for most forms of domestic transportation security. The increasing mobility 
and destructive potential of modern terrorism has required the United States to 
rethink and renovate fundamentally its systems for border and transportation secu-
rity. Indeed, we must now begin to conceive of border security and transportation 
security as fully integrated requirements because our domestic transportation sys-
tems are inextricably intertwined with the global transport infrastructure. Virtu-
ally every community in America is connected to the global transportation network 
by the seaports, airports, highways, pipelines, railroads, and waterways that move 
people and goods into, within, and out of the Nation. We must therefore promote 
the efficient and reliable flow of people, goods, and services across borders, while 
preventing terrorists from using transportation conveyances or systems to deliver 
implements of destruction.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies six major initiatives in 
this area:
Ensure accountability in border and transportation security;
Create “smart borders”;
Increase the security of international shipping containers;
Implement the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001;
Recapitalize the U.S. Coast Guard; and
Reform immigration services.
The President proposed to Congress that the principal border and transpor-
tation security agencies—the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. 
Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service, and the Transportation Security Agency—be transferred to the new 
Department of Homeland Security. This organizational reform will greatly assist in 
the implementation of all the above initiatives.

Appendix  n  267
Domestic Counterterrorism. The attacks of September 11 and the catastrophic 
loss of life and property that resulted have redefined the mission of federal, state, 
and local law enforcement authorities. While law enforcement agencies will con-
tinue to investigate and prosecute criminal activity, they should now assign prior-
ity to preventing and interdicting terrorist activity within the United States. The 
Nation’s state and local law enforcement officers will be critical in this effort. Our 
Nation will use all legal means—both traditional and nontraditional—to iden-
tify, halt, and, where appropriate, prosecute terrorists in the United States. We will 
pursue not only the individuals directly involved in terrorist activity but also their 
sources of support: the people and organizations that knowingly fund the terrorists 
and those that provide them with logistical assistance.
Effectively reorienting law enforcement organizations to focus on counterter-
rorism objectives requires decisive action in a number of areas. The National Strat-
egy for Homeland Security identifies six major initiatives in this area:
Improve intergovernmental law enforcement coordination;
Facilitate apprehension of potential terrorists;
Continue ongoing investigations and prosecutions;
Complete FBI restructuring to emphasize prevention of terrorist attacks;
Target and attack terrorist financing; and
Track foreign terrorists and bring them to justice.
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets. Our society and modern way 
of life are dependent on networks of infrastructure—both physical networks such 
as our energy and transportation systems and virtual networks such as the Internet. 
If terrorists attack one or more pieces of our critical infrastructure, they may dis-
rupt entire systems and cause significant damage to the Nation. We must therefore 
improve protection of the individual pieces and interconnecting systems that make 
up our critical infrastructure. Protecting America’s critical infrastructure and key 
assets will not only make us more secure from terrorist attack, but will also reduce 
our vulnerability to natural disasters, organized crime, and computer hackers.
America’s critical infrastructure encompasses a large number of sectors. The 
U.S. government will seek to deny terrorists the opportunity to inflict lasting harm 
to our Nation by protecting the assets, systems, and functions vital to our national 
security, governance, public health and safety, economy, and national morale.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies eight major initiatives in 
this area:
Unify America’s infrastructure protection effort in the Department of Home-
land Security;
Build and maintain a complete and accurate assessment of America’s critical 
infrastructure and key assets;

268  n  Appendix
Enable effective partnership with state and local governments and the private 
sector;
Develop a national infrastructure protection plan;
Secure cyberspace;
Harness the best analytic and modeling tools to develop effective protective 
solutions;
Guard America’s critical infrastructure and key assets against “inside” threats;

Partner with the international community to protect our transnational 
infrastructure.
Defending against Catastrophic Threats. The expertise, technology, and mate-
rial needed to build the most deadly weapons known to mankind—including 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons—are spreading inexorably. 
If our enemies acquire these weapons, they are likely to try to use them. The con-
sequences of such an attack could be far more devastating than those we suffered 
on September 11—a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorist attack in 
the United States could cause large numbers of casualties, mass psychological dis-
ruption, contamination and significant economic damage, and could overwhelm 
local medical capabilities.
Currently, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detection capabilities 
are modest and response capabilities are dispersed throughout the country at every 
level of government. While current arrangements have proven adequate for a vari-
ety of natural disasters and even the September 11 attacks, the threat of terrorist 
attacks using chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons requires new 
approaches, a focused strategy, and a new organization.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies six major initiatives in 
this area:
Prevent terrorist use of nuclear weapons through better sensors and procedures;
Detect chemical and biological materials and attacks;
Improve chemical sensors and decontamination techniques;
Develop broad spectrum vaccines, antimicrobials, and antidotes;
Harness the scientific knowledge and tools to counter terrorism; and
Implement the Select Agent Program.
E mergency Preparedness and Response. We must prepare to minimize the dam-
age and recover from any future terrorist attacks that may occur despite our best 
efforts at prevention. An effective response to a major terrorist incident—as well as 
a natural disaster—depends on being prepared. Therefore, we need a comprehen-
sive national system to bring together and coordinate all necessary response assets 
quickly and effectively. We must plan, equip, train, and exercise many different 
response units to mobilize without warning for any emergency.

Appendix  n  269
Many pieces of this national emergency response system are already in place. 
America’s first line of defense in the aftermath of any terrorist attack is its first 
responder community—police officers, firefighters, emergency medical providers, 
public works personnel, and emergency management officials. Nearly three million 
state and local first responders regularly put their lives on the line to save the lives 
of others and make our country safer.
Yet multiple plans currently govern the federal government’s support of first 
responders during an incident of national significance. These plans and the gov-
ernment’s overarching policy for counterterrorism are based on an artificial and 
unnecessary distinction between “crisis management” and “consequence manage-
ment.” Under the President’s proposal, the Department of Homeland Security will 
consolidate federal response plans and build a national system for incident manage-
ment in cooperation with state and local government. Our federal, state, and local 
governments would ensure that all response personnel and organizations are prop-
erly equipped, trained, and exercised to respond to all terrorist threats and attacks 
in the United States. Our emergency preparedness and response efforts would also 
engage the private sector and the American people.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies twelve major initiatives 
in this area:
Integrate separate federal response plans into a single all-discipline incident 
management plan;
Create a national incident management system;
Improve tactical counterterrorist capabilities;
Enable seamless communication among all responders;
Prepare health care providers for catastrophic terrorism;
Augment America’s pharmaceutical and vaccine stockpiles;
Prepare for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear decontamination;
Plan for military support to civil authorities;
Build the Citizen Corps;
Implement the First Responder Initiative of the Fiscal Year 2003 Budget;
Build a national training and evaluation system; and
Enhance the victim support system.
The Foundations of Homeland Security
The National Strategy for Homeland Security also describes four foundations—
unique American strengths that cut across all of the mission areas, across all levels 
of government, and across all sectors of our society. These foundations—law, sci-
ence and technology, information sharing and systems, and international coopera-
tion—provide a useful framework for evaluating our homeland security investments 
across the federal government.

270  n  Appendix
L aw. Throughout our Nation’s history, we have used laws to promote and safeguard 
our security and our liberty. The law will both provide mechanisms for the govern-
ment to act and will define the appropriate limits of action.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security outlines legislative actions that 
would help enable our country to fight the war on terrorism more effectively. New 
federal laws should not preempt state law unnecessarily or overly federalize the war 
on terrorism. We should guard scrupulously against incursions on our freedoms.
The Strategy identifies twelve major initiatives in this area:
Federal level
Enable critical infrastructure information sharing;
Streamline information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement 
agencies;
Expand existing extradition authorities;
Review authority for military assistance in domestic security;
Revive the President’s reorganization authority; and
Provide substantial management flexibility for the Department of Homeland 
Security.
State level
Coordinate suggested minimum standards for state driver’s licenses;
Enhance market capacity for terrorism insurance;
Train for prevention of cyber attacks;
Suppress money laundering;
Ensure continuity of the judiciary; and
Review quarantine authorities.
Science and Technology. The Nation’s advantage in science and technology is a 
key to securing the homeland. New technologies for analysis, information sharing, 
detection of attacks, and countering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
weapons will help prevent and minimize the damage from future terrorist attacks. 
Just as science has helped us defeat past enemies overseas, so too will it help us 
defeat the efforts of terrorists to attack our homeland and disrupt our way of life.
The federal government is launching a systematic national effort to harness 
science and technology in support of homeland security. We will build a national 
research and development enterprise for homeland security sufficient to mitigate 
the risk posed by modern terrorism. The federal government will consolidate most 
federally funded homeland security research and development under the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to ensure strategic direction and avoid duplicative 
efforts. We will create and implement a long-term research and development plan 
that includes investment in revolutionary capabilities with high payoff potential. 
The federal government will also seek to harness the energy and ingenuity of the 
private sector to develop and produce the devices and systems needed for homeland 
security.

Appendix  n  271
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies eleven major initiatives 
in this area:
Develop chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear countermeasures;
Develop systems for detecting hostile intent;
Apply biometric technology to identification devices;
Improve the technical capabilities of first responders;
Coordinate research and development of the homeland security apparatus;
Establish a national laboratory for homeland security;
Solicit independent and private analysis for science and technology research;
Establish a mechanism for rapidly producing prototypes;
Conduct demonstrations and pilot deployments;
Set standards for homeland security technology; and
Establish a system for high-risk, high-payoff homeland security research.
Information Sharing and Systems. Information systems contribute to every aspect 
of homeland security. Although American information technology is the most 
advanced in the world, our country’s information systems have not adequately sup-
ported the homeland security mission. Databases used for federal law enforcement, 
immigration, intelligence, public health surveillance, and emergency management 
have not been connected in ways that allow us to comprehend where information 
gaps or redundancies exist. In addition, there are deficiencies in the communica-
tions systems used by states and municipalities throughout the country; most state 
and local first responders do not use compatible communications equipment. To 
secure the homeland better, we must link the vast amounts of knowledge residing 
within each government agency while ensuring adequate privacy.
The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies five major initiatives in 
this area:
Integrate information sharing across the federal government;
Integrate information sharing across state and local governments, private indus-
try, and citizens;
Adopt common “meta-data” standards for electronic information relevant to 
homeland security;
Improve public safety emergency communications; and
Ensure reliable public health information.
International Cooperation. In a world where the terrorist threat pays no respect 
to traditional boundaries, our strategy for homeland security cannot stop at our 
borders. America must pursue a sustained, steadfast, and systematic international 
agenda to counter the global terrorist threat and improve our homeland security. 
Our international anti-terrorism campaign has made significant progress since Sep-
tember 11. The full scope of these activities will be further described in the forth-

272  n  Appendix
coming National Security Strategy of the United States and the National Strategy 
for Combating Terrorism. The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies 
nine major initiatives in this area:
Create “smart borders”;
Combat fraudulent travel documents;
Increase the security of international shipping containers;
Intensify international law enforcement cooperation;
Help foreign nations fight terrorism;
Expand protection of transnational critical infrastructure;
Amplify international cooperation on homeland security science and 
technology;
Improve cooperation in response to attacks; and
Review obligations to international treaties and law.
Costs of Homeland Security
The national effort to enhance homeland security will yield tremendous benefits 
and entail substantial financial and other costs. Benefits include reductions in the 
risk of attack and their potential consequences. Costs include not only the resources 
we commit to homeland security but also the delays to commerce and travel. The 
United States spends roughly $100 billion per year on homeland security. This fig-
ure includes federal, state, and local law enforcement and emergency services, but 
excludes most funding for the armed forces.
The responsibility of providing homeland security is shared between federal, 
state and local governments, and the private sector. In many cases, sufficient incen-
tives exist in the private market to supply protection. Government should fund only 
those homeland security activities that are not supplied, or are inadequately sup-
plied, in the market. Cost sharing between different levels of government should 
reflect the principles of federalism. Many homeland security activities, such as 
intelligence gathering and border security, are properly accomplished at the federal 
level. In other circumstances, such as with first responder capabilities, it is more 
appropriate for state and local governments to handle these responsibilities.
Conclusion: Priorities for the Future
The National Strategy for Homeland Security sets a broad and complex agenda for 
the United States. The Strategy has defined many different goals that need to be 
met, programs that need to be implemented, and responsibilities that need to be 
fulfilled. But creating a strategy is, in many respects, about setting priorities—about 
recognizing that some actions are more critical or more urgent than others.

Appendix  n  273
The President’s Fiscal Year 2003 Budget proposal, released in February 2002, 
identified four priority areas for additional resources and attention in the upcom-
ing year:
Support first responders;
Defend against bioterrorism;
Secure America’s borders; and
Use 21st-century technology to secure the homeland.
Work has already begun on the President’s Fiscal Year 2004 Budget. Assuming 
the Congress passes legislation to implement the President’s proposal to create the 
Department of Homeland Security, the Fiscal Year 2004 Budget will fully reflect 
the reformed organization of the executive branch for homeland security. That bud-
get will have an integrated and simplified structure based on the six critical mission 
areas defined by the Strategy. Furthermore, at the time the National Strategy for 
Homeland Security was published, it was expected that the Fiscal Year 2004 Budget 
would attach priority to the following specific items for substantial support:
Enhance the analytic capabilities of the FBI;
Build new capabilities through the Information Analysis and Infrastructure 
Protection Division of the proposed Department of Homeland Security;
Create “smart borders”;
Improve the security of international shipping containers;
Recapitalize the U.S. Coast Guard;
Prevent terrorist use of nuclear weapons through better sensors and procedures;
Develop broad spectrum vaccines, antimicrobials, and antidotes; and
Integrate information sharing across the federal government.
In the intervening months, the executive branch will prepare detailed imple-
mentation plans for these and many other initiatives contained within the National 
Strategy for Homeland Security. These plans will ensure that the taxpayers’ money 
is spent only in a manner that achieves specific objectives with clear performance-
based measures of effectiveness.

Endnotes
	
1. The National Strategy for Homeland Security defines “State” to mean “any state of 
the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, the Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or the trust territory of the Pacific Islands.” The Strategy defines “local gov-
ernment” as “any county, city, village, town, district, or other political subdivision 
of any state, any Native American tribe or authorized tribal organization, or Alaska 
native village or organization, and includes any rural community or unincorporated 
town or village or any other public entity for which an application for assistance is 
made by a state or political subdivision thereof.”
	
2. The distribution of the National Strategy for Homeland Security coincides with Con-
gress’ consideration of the President’s proposal to establish a Department of Home-
land Security. The Strategy refers to a “Department of Homeland Security” only to 
provide the strategic vision for the proposed Department and not to assume any one 
part of the President’s proposal will or will not be signed into law.

defenses against missiles. Specifically, it prohibited deployment by the 
United States and the Soviet Union (later the Russian Federation) of ABM 
systems for territorial defense, limited ABM deployments for defense of a 
state’s national capital or one ICBM-launcher complex; prohibited devel-
opment, testing, or deployment of sea-based, air-based, space-based, or 
mobile land-based ABM systems; prohibited transfer of ABM systems or 
components to other states; and provided for national technical means of 
verification while prohibiting concealment measures. The treaty went out 
of force in June 2002, six months after the United States provided notice 
it would no longer adhere to the treaty.

“All terrorism is local”: The notion that in a crisis, one’s perceptions are reality. 
Local factors significantly shape those perceptions of the most directly 
impacted targeted audience. It is a modification of former Speaker Thomas 
P. “Tip” O’Neil’s famous dictum that “all politics is local.”
Antibiotic: Any drug intended to retard or prevent the disease-causing ability of 
bacteria.
Antiproliferation: An attempt to prevent the spread of nuclear, biological, and 
chemical weapons. See also counterproliferation and nonproliferation.
Antiterrorism: Coordinated defensive measures to detect, prevent, and respond 
to terrorism. Part of an overall effort to minimize damage and maximize 
recovery. See also counterterrorism. The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has jurisdiction in these matters.

ons. A person can be infected through inhalation, exposure through the 
skin, or by eating contaminated food.
Antimicrobial: A general term for any drug or treatment intended to retard or pre-
vent the disease-causing ability of microbial, disease-causing organisms, 
such as bacteria, viruses, funguses, etc.

in Tokyo neighborhoods.
Australia Group: Informal group of countries established in 1985 to help reduce 
the spread of chemical and biological weapons by monitoring and control-
ling the spread of technologies required to produce them.
Avian influenza: Any influenza virus that infects birds (wild or domestic), but 
between 1997 and the present, most people use this term in reference to 
a particular strain of avian flu, H5N1, which crossed the species bar-
rier to become a disease organism for humans also. Currently, H5N1 flu 
virus, which up to 2006 had over a 60 percent case fatality rate, is feared 
to hold the potential for mutation. If so, it could be sufficient to become 
transmissible from human to human, just like standard strains of human 
influenza, and possibly start a global pandemic that could kill millions.
Away game: Phrase used by the Pentagon to describe a situation of forward 
defense, and international efforts to deal with security, distinguished from 
the “home game” of domestic homeland security. It influences homeland 
security in that it prevents individuals and groups from adopting terrorism 
as a tactic in the first place.
Bacteria: A particular type of single-celled microorganism, ranging in size from 
1 to 20 micrometers, usually visible under a light microscope. Examples 
of bacterial infectious diseases include cholera, anthrax, tuberculosis, and

politics today.
Biosecurity: Biological security or defense measures taken to prevent, monitor, 
research, respond to, and otherwise increase the protection of civilian and 
military populations against biological threats, such as catastrophic infec-
tious disease outbreaks, caused either by deliberate bioterrorism or natu-
rally occurring infectious pathogens or toxins.
Biological weapon (BW): Any weapon that uses living microorganisms, such 
as bacteria or viruses, to deliberately sicken or kill humans, animals, or

Clash of Civilizations: The term was introduced by the scholar Samuel P. Hun-
tington to describe conflict in the post-Cold War era. Rather than states 
attacking other states, fighting would take place along civilizational and 
cultural lines.
Clausewitz, Carl von: Prussian general and writer whose 1832 work, On War, is 
considered a classic treatise in strategy. He advocated the total destruction 
of an enemy’s forces as one of the strategic targets of warfare. Clausewitz 
also saw war as an extension of political policy and not merely as an end in 
itself.
Co-infection: Infection by more than one disease organism at the same time, which 
may cause one or both diseases to be worse, or more easily transmitted, 
than they might without the presence of the other. Example: HIV/AIDS 
and tuberculosis in Africa are common, devastating co-infections.
Comparative risk analysis: Risk is the likelihood that bad things may happen. Risk 
is conceptualized by DHS as a combination of threat, vulnerability, and con-
sequence probabilities.

ply preventing the spread of such weapons, technology, and knowledge 
which is associated with nonproliferation. See also antiproliferation and 
nonproliferation.
Counterterrorism: Coordinated offensive efforts and measures to prevent attacks, 
minimize damage, and maximize recovery. It is largely the bailiwick of 
the State Department, the Defense Department and the CIA. See also

emphasis is on self-policing rather than customs inspection and is an 
important development in civil security cooperation.
Damage limitation: Strategy based on the realization that prevention of terror-
ist attacks can never be perfect. Concern is geared toward mitigation of 
attacks that do occur with emphasis on creating a more vibrant civil soci-
ety and a citizen ethos of self-help.
Denial of capability: At an operational level, the emphasis is to deter any cam-
paign or series of terrorist actions. This is achieved primarily through the 
disruption of organizational recruitment and sustainment, as well as their 
training, access to weapons and sanctuary, communications, finance, and 
whatever other resources needed to initiate terrorist operations.
Denial of objectives: At this highest strategic level, the goal is to deter terrorism 
itself by marginalizing the terrorist message from both its target popula-
tion and its support base.
Denial of opportunity: The base, or tactical level, of deterrence which delinks 
the terrorist action cadre from its intended victim or victims. This is 
accomplished primarily through either denying the victim to the terrorist 
through protection and hardening, or by denying the terrorist access to 
the victim or weapon through entry and movement management.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS): U.S. cabinet-level department under 
the executive branch (president) designated to “detect, prepare for, prevent, 
protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the 
borders of the United States.”
Deterrence:  Threat of the use of force aimed at persuading another actor not to do 
what it intends or may like to do. It is a psychological effect on an oppo-
nent that results in a rational decision to desist because of the expected 
consequences of attacking or starting a war.
Disease: A condition in which the functioning of the body or a part of the body 
is interfered with or damaged. In a person with an infectious disease, the 
infectious agent that has entered the body causes it to function abnormally 

296  n  Glossary
in some way or ways. The type of abnormal functioning that occurs is the 
disease. Usually the body will show some signs and symptoms of the prob-
lems it is having with functioning. Disease can be infectious (able to be 
transmitted from another person, animal, or insect, or gotten from a germ 
or pathogen in the environment, such as the soil or air) or noninfectious 
(not able to be transmitted person to person, such as cancer or diabetes).
E mergency medical services (E MS): Generally refers to state or local level gov-

population in which that disease is not normally present or is present at a 
lower level.
E pidemiology: The study of epidemic disease, with a view to finding means of

the state of Israel since they are geographically further away. See also near 
enemy.
Fatwa: Religious ruling.
FE M A (Federal E mergency Management Agency): A civilian natural disaster 
management and recovery agency originally chartered to respond to hur-
ricanes, and later all natural disasters. Absorbed into the Department of 
Homeland Security in 2003, it was reduced to “a stepchild of national 
security,” according to Michael Brown, its former director, and was criti-
cized for not responding adequately to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina.
First wave of terrorism: First of four waves of terrorism expounded on by David 
Rapoport emerging in the late 1800s when rebel and revolutionary move-
ments embraced sensational violence to attack local regimes. The Nar-

cumstances change so quickly that one may not be aware of essential 
details about what is happening.
4 D’s: Four fundamental goals laid out by President George W. Bush in 2003 in the 
U.S. National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. They are: (1) defending 
U.S. citizens and interests at home and abroad; (2) defeating and destroy-
ing terrorist organizations; (3) denying sanctuary and support to terrorist 
organizations; and (4) diminishing the underlying causes of terrorism.
Fourth wave of terrorism: Fourth of four waves of terrorism expounded on by 
David Rapoport. It emerged in the aftermath of the Soviet defeat in 
Afghanistan and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran. It demon-
strated the growing power of religion as a way to motivate people to ter-
rorism. See also first wave of terrorism, second wave of terrorism, and third 
wave of terrorism.
French Revolution: Event from 1789 to 1799 in which republicanism replaced 
absolute monarchy in France. It is considered by many to be the seminal 
event in the birth of modern war and modern terrorism as perpetrated by

and former Republican Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. It 
consisted of three phases. Phase one went from July 1998 to August 1999. 
The second phase lasted from August 1999 to April 2000. Finally, phase 
three’s duration was a period from April 2000 until February 2001, con-
cluding just months before the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United 
States. It was charged to “conduct the most comprehensive review of 
American Security since the National Security Act of 1947 was signed into 
law over 50 years ago.” More concretely, the objective of the report was 
to “design a national security strategy” suitable for the new international 
environment of the twenty-first century.
Hazards: Anything that potentially endangers our community. Hazards are either 
natural or man-made. Natural hazards include blizzards, drought, earth-
quakes, epidemics, floods, hurricanes, tornados, or wild fires. Man-made 
hazards include criminal acts, hazardous materials, technical/industrial 
accidents, terrorism, and war.
Herd immunity: The existence of a presumed threshold of individuals in a given 
population (the “herd”) with immunity against a pathogen in sufficient 
(or insufficient) numbers to reduce or even prevent a broader outbreak. 
This does not require universal immunity among all the population, but a 
variable percentage, depending on many factors.
Home game: Domestic effort revolving around actions taken to harden victims 
against attack, to limit terrorist access to those victims, and to limit access 
to weapons of choice to carry out attacks. It equally involves efforts to 
mitigate the effects of attacks that do take place. Its efforts are largely 
concentrated in the Department of Homeland Security.
Homeland defense: Measures a state takes to protect what lies within its bor-
ders—its people along with the physical and institutional foundations of 
human sustenance and society. Though there is obvious overlap, homeland 
security before Hurricane Katrina was aimed exclusively at domestic and 
external terrorism attack threat and vulnerability reduction, and conse-
quence mitigation.
Homeland security: Refers to the “home game” of defense within U.S. borders. 
The Department of Homeland Security, which emerged in the aftermath 
of the September 11 attack, represents a new generation of domestic secu-
rity and public safety and sets as its goals preparedness, prevention, miti-
gation, response, and recovery from an attack. It is situated as distinct 
from the “away game” of operations more commonly associated with the 
Department of Defense.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5): Directive designed to 
prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major 
disasters, and other emergencies. It established the secretary of homeland 
security as the main federal official responsible for domestic incident man-
agement. Its purpose is to enhance the management of domestic incidents 

Glossary  n  299

system. 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 (HSPD-8: Directive serving as a 
follow up to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 for preparedness. It

takes for an infectious microbe to multiply and spread sufficiently to cause 
disease symptoms in the infected organism (human, animal, etc.).
Infection: The entry and development of a pathogenic disease agent in the body of 
a person, animal, or other organism. In an apparent “manifest” infection, 
the infected person outwardly appears to be sick. In an inapparent infec-
tion, there is no outward sign that an infectious agent has entered that 
person at all. Infection should not be confused with disease.

Response Plan, the National Contingency Plan, the Interagency Domes-
tic Terrorism Concept of Operations Plan, and the Federal Radiological 
Emergency Response Plan. The National Response Plan places an empha-
sis on planning, preparedness, and response at the local and state levels 
through the application of the National Incident Management System, 
created by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 in February 2003.

controversial piece of federal legislation. Originally passed after the Sep-
tember 11, 2001 attacks, the act was written in response to the terrorist 
attacks against the United States, and dramatically expanded the author-
ity of U.S. law enforcement for the stated purpose of fighting terrorism in 
the United States and abroad.
Pattern of convergence: Pattern of first responders tending to congregate at 
the scene of a catastrophe. Those converging on the scene tend to be of 
five types: the returnees, the anxious, the helpers, the curious, and the 
exploiters.
Petroleum: A broadly defined class of liquid hydrocarbon mixtures. Included are 
crude oil, lease condensates, unfinished oils, refined products obtained 
from the processing of crude oil, and natural gas plant liquids.
Petroleum products: Petroleum products are obtained from the processing of crude 
oil (including lease condensates), natural gas, and other hydrocarbon com-
pounds. Petroleum products include unfinished oils, liquefied petroleum 
gases, pentanes plus, aviation gasoline, motor gasoline, naphtha-type jet 
fuel, kerosene-type jet fuel, kerosene, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, 
petrochemical feedstocks, special naphthas, lubricants, waxes, petroleum 
coke, asphalt, road oil, still gas, and other products.
Plague: Either (1) a generic term for any widespread, deadly epidemic of any ori-
gin—derived originally from the specific Yersinia “black plague”; or (2) the 
plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, believed to be responsible for Europe’s 
Black Death and other periodic pandemics throughout history.
Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD 39): A directive that established the 
FBI as the lead federal agency for crisis management of a terrorist attack. 
It further established FEMA as the lead official for consequence manage-
ment of a terrorist incident.
Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62): Codified change in perspective 
regarding terrorism in May 1998 establishing the creation of a small group 
within the National Security Council focusing on the terrorist threat.

304  n  Glossary
Preventive war: Term for a type of war where public justification is proclaimed as 
a type of self-defense, an attack before the fact based on the assumption 
that conflict is likely imminent.
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI): Initiative announced by President George 
W. Bush on May 31, 2003 whereby the United States would take a lead 
in an effort to interdict the transfer of weapons of mass destruction, their 
delivery systems, and related materials to or from states of proliferation 
concern.
Proved reserves: An estimate of remaining recoverable resources that is based on 
economic and technical parameters. The EIA version of this definition 
stresses that proved reserves are estimated quantities of energy sources that 
analysis of geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable 
certainty are recoverable under existing economic and operating condi-
tions. The location, quantity, and grade of the energy source are usually 
considered to be well established in such reserves.
Public health: The health of the human population as a whole; or the field of medi-
cine that attempts to promote such health.
Radiological dispersal device: Conventional bomb wrapped in radioactive mate-
rial. When it is detonated, radioactive material is spread by the blast. It is 
commonly referred to as a “dirty bomb.”
Redundancy: Concept associated with segments of national infrastructure that 
have many similar assets serving the same purpose.
Regional Assistance Committees: Groups comprised of Department of Home-
land Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel, 
and according to the National Response Plan, is the primary vehicle for 
federal government coordination in the event of a radiological or nuclear 
incident.
Risk: The relationship between hazards and vulnerabilities.
Risk assessment (or analysis): See Comparative risk analysis.
Sarin: Toxic substance used as a nerve agent chemical weapon. Its use has been 
banned by the United Nations.
Second wave of terrorism: Second of four waves of terrorism expounded on by 
David Rapoport. It emerged in the aftermath of World War I, prompted 
by the forces of decolonization. Instead of targeting senior officials, nation-
alists typically attacked instruments of colonial control, such as police and 
military outposts. The Irgun attacking the British in Palestine is a clear 
example of this wave. The wave demonstrated that terrorism could be inte-
grated into an overall effective political strategy. See also first wave of ter-
rorism, third wave of terrorism, and fourth wave of terrorism.
Secure Trade in the Apec Region: See STAR Program.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): SARS appeared early in 2003 in 
China, but soon spread and created a significant global outbreak. SARS 
prompted the WHO’s first ever worldwide travel alert for a newly emerg-

ing viral disease, and was thought to be a mutated strain of the corona-
virus, normally one of three viruses responsible for the common cold. Its 
animal hosts are uncertain.
Sharia: Law of Allah.
Short ton: A unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds.
Soft power: Concept associated with political scientist Joseph Nye which stressed

power of military force.
Smallpox: The disease caused by the pathogenic Variola major virus, a member of 
the Orthopoxvirus genus and Poxviridae family. After a concerted, immu-
nization campaign around the world in the 1960s and 1970s, the virus was 
officially declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
in 1980. The former Soviet Union bioweapons program engineered a wea-
ponized version of smallpox in the 1970s and 1980s.
Sneak and Peak: Sneak and peek warrants allow law enforcement officers to law-
fully make surreptitious entries into areas where a reasonable expectation 
of privacy exists, search for items of evidence or contraband, and leave 
without making any seizures or giving concurrent notice of the search.
STAR program (Secure Trade in the APE C region): Program launched in 2002 
whose objective is to focus on securing Asia-Pacific trade while protecting 
regional transportation networks. Specifically the program is designed to 
“enhance security while increasing trade by committing APEC economies 
to accelerate action on screening people and cargo for security before tran-
sit; increasing security on ships and airplanes when in route; and enhanc-
ing security in airports and seaports.”
Strain: A genetic variation or subtype of any microorganism species. In pathogens, 
the strain can mean the difference between mild (or no) disease and severe, 
deadly virulence.
Strategic National Stockpile (SNS): Large-scale caches of antibiotics, medicines, 
vaccines, and other supplies capable of being rapidly deployed (within 12 
hours) in the event of a major mass casualty event anywhere in the United 
States, and hypothetically capable of supplying antibiotics and other phar-
maceuticals for hundreds of thousands of people.
Strategy: Ways or modalities by which we link capabilities or means we have or can 
generate to the ends, purposes, or objectives we seek. Ends are the goals 
sought. Means are the resources available to pursue the objectives. Ways are 
the concepts or methods for how one organizes and applies the resources. 
See also Carl von Clausewitz and Sun Tzu.

serve needs that can be met by assets available in other segments.
Sunset provisions: In public policy, a sunset provision or sunset clause is a provision 
in a statute or regulation that terminates or repeals all or portions of the law 

306  n  Glossary
after a specific date, unless further legislative action is taken to extend it. 
Not all laws have sunset clauses. In such cases, the law goes on indefinitely.
Sun Tzu: Ancient Chinese philosopher of war who wrote The Art of war, considered 
by many to be a classic treatise on strategy. He argued a good military 
leader who can project an aura of strength can resolve a dispute without 
losing soldiers. He also articulated the need for soldiers to know them-
selves as much as the enemy they faced.
Target audience: People, aside from the victims, whom terrorists hope to inspire 
fear in through their actions.
Terrorism: Calculated events perpetrated by adversaries who seek strategically to 
attain particular objectives by such means. It is a rational, or purposive use, 
of the “irrational” or intimidating effects of violence. It is a tactic of politi-
cal violence designed to intimidate or cause fear in an adversary.
Third wave of terrorism: Third of four waves of terrorism expounded on by David 
Rapoport. It is best exemplified by the Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO) in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. The terrorists in this wave 
were careful to use violence in a purposive way to achieve political goals 
and tended to stick with known methods. See also first wave of terrorism, 
second wave of terrorism, and fourth wave of terrorism.
Transgovernmentalism: Concept articulated by Anne-Marie Slaughter in which 
the component parts of states (whether judicial systems, legislatures, and 
bureaucracies) can make connections with their counterparts abroad and 
together develop mechanisms for governance in their sectors.
Transmission (of infectious agents): Any mechanism through which an infec-
tious agent, such as a virus, is spread from a reservoir or source to a human 
being. Usually each type of infectious agent is spread by only one or a 
few of the different mechanisms of transmission. Types of transmission 
mechanisms include: (1) direct transmission to the body, via various pos-
sible routes (e.g., mucus membranes, sexual organs, mouth, nose, etc.); (2) 
indirect transmission, via vehicles (such as eating utensils, food, blood, 
etc.) and vectors or hosts (such as biting mosquitoes, flies, or other hosts); 
and (3) airborne transmission of suspended aerosolized particles, that 
usually infect via inhalation into the lungs.
Transnational: Relationships occurring across borders at nonexecutive levels of 
government, between subnational governments or government depart-
ments, and between private and non-governmental actors.
Trilateral countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hun-
gary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands,

quake killed up to 280,000 people in south Asia and Africa.
U mma: The Muslim community.
U nconventional gas: Gas that is produced from coal (coalbed methane), shales, 
and tight sands. Gas hydrates are presently excluded from unconventional 
gas reserves estimates as they are currently nonproducible.
U nconventional oil: Oil that is more than 20.0 degrees API gravity, oil from coal 
and shale, bitumen, polar oil, and deepwater/ultra-deepwater oil, and liq-
uids created from natural gas.

Vector: A carrier, usually an insect that transmits the disease-causing organisms 
from infected to noninfected individuals. Examples include mosquitoes 
carrying malaria and yellow fever virus, and ticks carrying Lyme disease 
or viral hemorrhagic fever-inducing viruses.
Virulence: A trait of a pathogen (germ) that enables it to cause disease; or the dis-
ease-causing ability of any microorganism. That is, the amount of harm 
(deaths and/or sickness, etc.) that a pathogen may or may not be able to 
inflict on an infected victim.
Virus: A microscopic parasitic organism, not visible under a normal light micro-
scope, which depends on nutrients from another organism’s living cells 
to metabolize and reproduce. Viruses generally have a simple construc-
tion, usually consisting of a strand of either DNA or RNA with a pro-
tein covering. From the Latin for “poison.” Examples of infectious viral 
diseases include Ebola, influenza, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and 
HIV/AIDS.
Vulnerabilities: Those things potentially endangered by hazards. These include: 
population, critical infrastructure, residences, business/economy, sense 
of well-being and security, mental health, the environment, and animal 
populations.
War of ideas: Battle over ideals and principles and is a central element in any success-
ful strategy of combat. Consists of waging a coordinated strategic campaign 
aimed at addressing root causes of grievances. The educational systems and 
media of societies are targeted in an effort to discredit extremism.
“War on Terror”: Phrase used by George W. Bush in the aftermath of the Septem-
ber 11 attack to describe U.S. counterterrorism strategy.

national critical infrastructure elements (e.g. aircrafts, chemical process-
ing facilities) and using the resulting product as a weapon.
Weapons of mass destruction (WMD): Weapons that are capable of a high order 
of destruction and/or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large 
numbers of people. Generally considered to include chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear weapons that are distinguishable from conven-
tional weapons and explosives.
World Health O rganization (WHO ): Part of the United Nations system, located 
in Geneva, Switzerland, and established in 1946 to oversee and promote
