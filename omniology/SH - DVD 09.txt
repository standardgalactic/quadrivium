Other then that let’s get to work, I need some volunteers. Let’s pick up 
where we left off earlier. I have five chairs here, which means I need five 
volunteers. I need three men and two women or I need five women. I want 
the best looking women in here and the best looking guys.
If you didn’t stand up right now and come forward, what does that say about 
what you’re saying to yourself unconsciously folks? I do say that in my 
shows, because it puts a little bit of guilt and shame on people. Well, the 
pressure’s on when you’re doing a show to get people up there. 
That’s my son, if anybody wants to see him. I should put a little voice in the 
background that goes, sleep. Look at that picture of my son. I actually have 
one of him doing that I should put that on there. I have a little video of him 
doing that. He’s got on one of my jackets and a pair of shades
How are you guys doing?
Great!
Are you ready to do this? I’ve got to get my paper to follow the script, unlike 
what I normally do. Wow, have you guys ever been hypnotized before?
Yes.
No kidding, so are you guys ready for this?
Yes.
This is going to be cool, I like this. Patrick? Where are you from again?
Scotland.
It’s good to have you here. Debra, where are you from?
Norman, Oklahoma.
Michael?
Sydney, Australia.
I want to go to Australia next.

You’ll come and see me. Why don’t you just bring me down?
He was looking for a place to stay.
That’s the way I work, I mean if I say, why don’t you just bring me down 
there. It’s a lot easier for both of us. 
Linda, where are you from?
Dayton, Ohio
Dayton, Ohio.
I’m sorry I took mine off at lunch and haven’t put it back on, sorry. It’s a New 
York thing.
You took it off at lunch. This is a clean show. 
Sometimes you don’t want people reading your information, I hate that.
Okay, cool. Let’s get right to it. You have all been hypnotized before, you’ve
all done this, so this shouldn’t be too difficult for you. 
Debra, sleep!
Linda, how are you doing, sleep!
Michael, are you happy now? 
Oh yeah, thanks very much.
You’re bringing me to Australia, right? What the hypnotist giveth, the 
hypnotist can take away. Good to have you here, Michael, sleep!
I don’t need to know your name. I just need to know that you’re going to go 
to sleep. Yeah, you’re next, sleep!

Warm Up 1: Beach Trip
Spencer:
Very good. We get everyone hypnotized very quickly because we want to 
move through rapidly, so we’re going to go into the first routine. But before 
we do, I’m going to give you a little deepening, because they’ve been kind 
of sitting out there and walking around and I want to make sure that my 
guys up here are very responsive.
Is there anybody else out there who would like to play with this right now? If 
you do, sit back in your chair. I’m serious, man. If you want to do this, I’ll 
take you all through it, but you can watch out there with your eyes wide 
open, with your ears, wide awake, listening, watching, observing and doing. 
The first routine will be number 2, in just a minute and I’ll give you a cue for 
that. 
When you’re doing a show, after you’ve got people hypnotized, you always 
set it up… there are two things that are included in the shows that I always 
do.
1. I always have music in the background.
Once the show begins, I always have some music going in the background, 
some kind of little ditty is playing. The reason I do that is because I do not 
like to have a dead spot. There’s nothing worse than having silence in 
between the skits. I want things to keep on groovin’, things to happen. 
2. I always do the same routines.
Once I get to that point, and I’ve got the people up here hypnotized the way 
I want to, I’m ready to do my first routine. Now when I do my routines, I do a 
lot of the same routines every time. The reason I do the same routines is 
because still, even though you’ve got some great subjects, you don’t know 
if they’re all going to be great subjects. 
Some of these people may respond to an idea and others may not. You 
never know. You hope that you’ve got great subjects, so I do the same 
routines every time because now I’m going to weed out the people who I 
think are really good and who I think would have more fun in the audience. 
With that said, after I’ve got the people up here – remember, this is where 
we left off last time, right with people dropped. Okay, so we’ve got them 
dropped again. That was a hard task. 
In a moment, I’m going to count to three and we’re going to see just
how well you guys have concentrated. I’m going to count to three
and we’re going to go to the beach. We’re going to have a good time.

On the beach, we’re going to have a fantastic time on the beach. 
You’re walking around, you’ve been talking to people, you’ve had a 
little too much to drink, but you’re really having a good time.
In fact, I’ll count to three, you’ll sit up in your chairs and you’ve had 
way too much to drink. In fact, you’re just a little bit drunk. The 
craziest thing you’ve ever felt. Right now you can even feel that 
coming into your mind. You’re feeling a little woozy, you’re not going 
to throw up your stomach is fine. 
You see, I want to make it clear they’re not going to get sick. You can tell a 
person that they’re drunk, but I’ve seen people chuck on stage, not a 
pleasant sight. Remember, you’re the hypnotist, it is a suggestion and 
people do take suggestions literally. So remember your role is always to 
watch out for what’s happening. So even if I give them a suggestion, I’m still 
going to watch them and make sure that, to the best of my ability, nothing is 
going to go south on me.
Before we go any further, right now I’m going to count to three. 
Everybody sit up in your chairs, eyes still closed, going deeper and 
deeper to sleep. I want you to put a seatbelt on very quickly. I’ll count 
to three you’ll put a seatbelt on because you’re a little bit drunk. You 
had too much drink 1-2-3, sit up in your chairs very quickly. Sit up in 
your chairs and put on a seatbelt. Do it quickly. Put on your seatbelt. 
Quickly, put on your seatbelt. Put it on nice and tight, nice and tight.
Eyes all the way closed down, sleeping very, very deeply still. Still
sleeping very deeply very good. Very cool. Nice. Nice. Nice.
This time I’m going to count to three, and at number three…
And this is how we do the cue I’m going to count to three and the music 
beings.
1-2-3, okay cool. You’re just on the beach right now. Kind of bee-
bopping around. You’ve had a lot to drink. Put your hand out there 
for a second. Let me give you something to drink. There you go. 
Have a glass. There you go. Have a drink right there. Have a drink. 
Take a drink. Really enjoy that. 
Oh yeah, take it down. This is a double shot of the best Tequila 
you’ve ever had. Oh yeah, this is really getting good now this is 
some of the best stuff you’ve ever had. I’m telling you this is 
awesome. This is good. Go ahead. Take another drink. It’s going to 
make you laugh. Take another drink it’s going to make you laugh. It’s 
so good.

You guys out there, make a lot of noise because the more noise you make
the more they act out. The more they act out, the more noise you need to 
make. 
Keep on drinking. Hey, I just found this really cool bud on the beach, 
man who wants to try this? Who wants to try this? Oh, you do down 
there? Let’s go for it. Here, take a hit off of that. Take a big hit off it. 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Take that. Pass it down. Pass it over, man. Pass 
it over. Give her a hit of that. Oh, you want to keep it. Don’t bogart 
that joint, my friend. Pass it over. 
Take a big hit off of that. Oh man, if that doesn’t make your eyes go 
backwards, nothing’s going to. Whew. Oh yeah. Okay, Michael, take 
a big hit off that, man. Blow the smoke out. Oh yeah, blow some 
smoke rings, buddy. Oh yeah. Oh man, that feels so good. That is 
some of the best bud I’ve ever had. 
Yeah, keep on smoking that baby. Oh yeah. That feels so good. Oh 
yeah, right on. Oh yeah. Wow, Michael, what do you think about that, 
man?
It’s good. 
Yeah, what kind is it?
Hydrohead. 
Hydrohead, man that’s some good stuff. 
Hey Debra, how are you feeling? 
Good.
Yeah, you’re getting pretty wasted, aren’t you?
Yeah. 
Do you want another hit off of that?
Yeah. 
Give Debra another hit off of that, Michael. Come on. Take another 
hit off of that, man. Oh yeah. Wow. Whew. Pass it down. Pass it on 
down. Pass it back down to Linda she hasn’t had any. Linda, reach 
out. Come on, Linda. Give that to Linda. She hasn’t had any. Go 
ahead and take a hit off of that.

I’ll tell you what, let’s get off the beach. Let’s get in the car, man. 
Let’s get on a little dune buggy. You’ve got your seatbelts on, right?
We’re in a dune buggy we’re driving down the sand right now. There 
you go. Everything is cool, but look out here comes some big sand 
dunes. 
Look out for the sand dunes and POP! Oh boy, look out. You’re 
going to go over that hill again, and POP! There you go. Go ahead 
and turn to your left. Turn to your left and watch out for the sand. 
Then turn to your right. Look out! Don’t fall out of the dune buggy.
Look at the police. There are some cops coming down. Here comes 
the beach patrol. Here comes the beach patrol. Throw your joint out 
the window. Throw it out the window. What are you going to do with 
your drink? What are you going to do with it?
Applause and laughter
All right. You guys are doing good. Here’s what I’m going to have 
you do. Go ahead and take another big drink of that and this time 
when you do you’re going to pass out. Take another and you’re just 
going to pass out this time. And just sleep! Way down. 
Give them a round of applause. Make them feel good.
Applause
Let’s talk about what this is about. I want to find out who’s a good subject,
so we give them the idea they’ve been drinking on the beach. So they’re 
drinking on the beach they’re having some cocktails. You can see they’re 
really getting into this, too, right? They’re like going this is some good stuff, 
man. This is like free drinking. 
So when you go out and do some street hypnosis tonight, you can say 
listen, I can save you a lot of money tonight. Don’t give $50 to the bartender
just give me $20, and I’ll give you a better night with absolutely no 
hangover, exactly.
So with these people here – sleep! There you go. Loosely, limply, 
relaxed very good, stuck to your chair? Stuck to your chair? 
You notice how I put a safety belt on everybody, a seatbelt when they went 
through that ride. That’s a safety thing that you can do to make sure that 
they don’t fall out of their chairs. Does that mean they won’t fall out of their 
chairs? No. But you’re trying to do the best you can with what you’ve got. 
So if you add on these safety features, it will help you to do your best to 
take care of your subjects at all times.

So we started with the drink, and I thought well okay, most people like to 
have a hit once in a while. Not me, I don’t do it. No, I really don’t. You can 
laugh, but I don’t. I just don’t. 
Anyway, moving along, then we moved onto the next routine, where 
everybody’s drunk and then they get a little bit stoned, which is pretty cool. 
It’s fun because the audience wants to see these people acting out. That’s 
what makes it fun and makes it an audience participation show, because 
you guys get to see what they’re doing and you’re going wow, I can relate 
to that. 
So when I’m picking out routines as a hypnotist, I’m always thinking, first, of 
things that I can relate to. Oh-oh, busted. Wait a minute Igor gave this to
me, okay?
Laughter
He gave that to me. That’s not mine really. 
If you can relate to it, then you can present it. So, when you’re working on 
developing skits on your own – not today, we’ve got skits for you, but when 
you go out into the real world – look around the world in your own life. If you 
can relate to it, then you can convey that to the people on stage, and you 
can convey it to the audience.
If you’re trying to emulate somebody else because you think it’s kind of fun 
or kind of goofy but you don’t really feel it, you just think that it would work it 
probably isn’t going to come off as well because you can’t feel it. 
Remember, I said that this is an art. It’s a craft to me. It’s your soul, so put 
your soul into it. 
If it can move you, then you can move others, but it’s got to get you going 
first. If it gets you going, then you can convey that, that’s what makes it fun. 
That’s what gives you the energy as a performer. If you’ve got it in you, you 
can give it out to them and everybody’s going to have a good time. Yep. I’ve 
been on one of these rides before, but I was very young and foolish.
Everybody up here is sleeping very, very deeply.
How do we go onto the next routine, because right now we have 
background music playing?
Okay, so after I say sleep, then this music comes back up it’s about 50% 
down. It’s just some little ditty in the background, that’s a transition between 
routines. There again, find something that you like. 
I’m going to get into more of the mechanics of working with the DJ because 
you have all this stuff and it’s coordinated. As soon as one thing’s done, 
[

you’re blending into the next routine. It all becomes automatic and it all 
becomes very natural so you’re just flowing.
Is anybody in here a DJ or ever DJ’d? Okay, cool so you know what it’s like. 
Do the scratching thing. If you’ve got a Mac, go get a DJ program. It’s very 
easy to use iTunes and if you’re a PC person, get a Mac!
Laughter
I should have stock in that company for all the times I talk about a Mac. 
So we have this music going in the background between routines and I get 
the audience reaction. Give them a powerful round of applause. You give 
them a round of applause and say cool, this is a lot of fun.
Applause

Warm Up 2: Big Band
[
]
Michael:
In a moment, I’m going to count to three. On number three, you guys 
are going to be in a band. You’re going to be playing instruments. 
When the music begins, pick your favorite instrument, and you’re 
going to be playing in the band.
And that will be number five. You can just hold up your hand when you’re 
ready to make that transition because I like to do everything smoothly. 
Even when I’m working with a DJ, I’m always watching them to make sure 
that we’re on cue. 
On number three, sit up in your chairs. You guys are in a band 
playing your favorite instrument 1-2-3, play that instrument right now. 
Play that instrument. 
Give it up for them, you guys. Come on. 
Applause
Come on, play that instrument. Come on. That’s right. Play that 
guitar. Oh yeah, play that trombone. Play that trombone. There you 
go. Give it up. Play that guitar. Come on get on the drums, man. 
You’ve got to play the drums. Get the drums going. Come on, make 
those drums really go. Make those drums happen. There you go. Let 
it happen, guys. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Stand up and really go for it. 
Get down baby. Whew. Oh yeah. Play that trombone, baby. Come 
on, play your instrument. Come on play. Get up there and play with 
everybody. Show us how you play those drums, man. Come on, play 
those drums. There you go…
And freeze!
Okay, you can add a little flare in there. You can just say freeze and 
everybody’s like mannequins and they’re frozen. It’s a nice touch in the 
show when you do something like that. 
Then, of course, you say freeze and you turn around like whoa, what’s 
going on? It’s like you don’t have any idea what’s happening you’re just as 
amazed as the audience is, like, what’s going on? This is crazy. 
The individual I’m touching right now wake up. Hey, what are you 
doing?
Playing bass guitar.

Uh, a trombone. 
It looks like very nice one. Okay. Have a seat.
Give her a round of applause, too.
Applause
Notice I said earlier that I am not a comedian, but you can look at people 
and you can throw things in there, little one-liners that are fun. People can 
read into whatever they want from their own life experience. That’s what 
makes it kind of goofy, so have fun with it. 
Hey Linda, wide awake hey, what are you doing? Are you having a 
good time?
Yeah.
You really are, aren’t you? Yeah, come here. Sleep! There you go.

Patrick:
Spencer:
Now listen, in just one minute, I’m going to count to three. On 
number three, open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every way. But 
right now, you can’t open your eyes. Whenever I ask you your name, 
you won’t remember your name. You’ve lost your mind. You’ve lost 
your name. It doesn’t come out of your head. You’ve lost your name. 
You’ve absolutely forgotten your name. You don’t know what it is. 
In fact, if you try to say your name, your mind just goes blank, your 
throat locks up and you forget your name. It’s just that simple. On the 
count of three, open your eyes, feeling fantastic 1-2-3, wide awake. 
Hey, do you know what? I need to set you down over here because 
you keep wobbling around. Can you have a seat over here? Very 
cool, thank you. Okay, good. 
What am I doing? I’m trying to set the stage for later. Do I have to ask her 
anything now? No, because I’m just setting some things up that I want to 
present later in the demonstration. 
Have a seat, my friend. Thank you. What are you doing up there? 
I don’t know.
You don’t know? Very good. 
Wide awake Patrick, wake up. How are you doing? 
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
What are you doing what’s in your hand? 
I don’t know.
You don’t know? It looks like a joint, so here have a seat.
He’s still holding onto that that’s kind of crazy. Oh boy. He even looks like 
he’s a little out of it. 
Oh you know what your name tag’s missing, I forgot, what was your 
name? I forgot your name? Let’s try something easier. Where do you 
live?

Well, then she knows. And your name was…
Laughter
Isn’t that crazy? And sleep! Okay.
Applause
Its fun to throw in some little zingers like that, and you can use it right now 
or you can do other things. You can send it out into the audience, and then 
you can play with them later. It’s always fun to have these little things 
happening at all times to get all this different interaction because people are 
fascinated. It’s like, what? She can’t remember her name, really? 
It’s like the people she’s with are going, that can’t be so. She never acts like 
that. That’s crazy. This stuff must be real. They would never do that, but 
why are they doing that?
Stage hypnotists, listen to me. You have a lot of power on stage, but don’t 
be fooled by it. When I’m done here, I’m going to Montana and being a dad. 
This is my alter ego. When you’re a stage hypnotist you’ve got a lot of 
power and you have a lot of fun. Have an alter ego and have fun with it. 
But remember when you’re done with the stage to go home and be a real 
human being again, because that’s more important than coming up here 
and doing all of this. This just pays for me to have fun being a single dad. 
That’s all it does. That’s what’s most important to me as a stage hypnotist at 
this point in my life. 
Hey Michael, sleep! Way down deeper and deeper. Listen very 
carefully as you go deeper and deeper to sleep, for the rest of the 
day, whenever I ask you your name you’re going to forget your 
name, but you’re going to have a different one. It’s going to be the 
name of a different female. Whenever I ask you your name, it’s the 
name of a different lady. It’s always a different name. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
13
                                
Michael is no longer your name. Whenever I ask you your name, it’s 
the name of a different female. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen, 
but every time I ask you your name, it’s a different name of a 
different lady, wide awake. 
Okay, how are you doing? 
Good.
Debra, right?
Yeah.
Very good. Are you having a good time? 
Yeah.
Good. Nice to have you here, sleep! Now listen, I’m going to send 
you back out into the audience because you keep flopping over and I 
need a little bit more room up here. So I’m going to send you back 
out here to the audience, sleep! Wake up. I’m going to send you 
back out to the audience. 
Now listen very carefully. When I do, whenever you hear me say the 
word hypnosis, whenever you hear me say the word hypnosis, you’re 
going to jump up and you’re going to call me a fake because you 
think that there’s nothing real about hypnosis. 
Whenever you hear me say the word hypnosis, you’re going to get 
up and call me a fake. You think that hypnosis is nothing but 
fraudulence, and that I’m nothing more than a fraud. That’s it. I’m just 
a fraud. 
Sit up, wide awake. Debra, hey wake up. Listen dear, I’m trying to do 
a show here and you keep falling over and going to sleep and I can’t 
have that. There are other people out there that will probably make 
better use of the chair here, so I’m going to send you back out to the 
audience. Is that okay?
Uh huh.
All right. Give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Thank you. Did you see how I grabbed her head and helped her off the 
stage? It will either be me doing that or an assistant because when they 
leave the stage area, we want to take care of their safety. We want to make 
sure they get back down to wherever they’re going. Depending on what 
routine you’re doing, you may send them back to where they were or you 
may put them in a specific chair, depending on how you’re framing the 
whole situation. 
Are you still doing good over there, Patrick?
Yeah.
Right on. Are you having a good time?
Yeah. 
And your name was…
Melissa.
Melissa. Cool. I like that name, Melissa. Wait a minute. What was 
your name?
Michelle. Okay, I like that. 
Laughter and applause
Wide awake. Wake up, wake up, wake up. I’m trying to do a show. 
Stop that. What was your name again? 
And your name was… And you are…
Samantha.
Samantha. Well, I’ll tell you, the things that happen when you do 
hypnosis, folks. 
FAKE!

Miranda.
Laughter
Miranda, okay. 
So, do you see where I’m going with this? When you’re doing stage shows, 
we’ve got our first guest down, I am already looking for people that I can 
use individually for separate routines. You do group routines, then you do 
individual routines and that’s what makes it a lot of fun for the audience. 
That’s why they come to see you – the extremely powerful, confident, 
competent stage hypnotist – and pay you big money. 
Yes. 
All right. My only goal here is to make you rich. All right, you’re welcome.
Good man.
I will send you an email with my tithing amount.
And you are…
Uh.
Forget about it go to sleep. Listen very carefully I’m going to tell you 
who you are. The next time I ask you who you are, you still don’t 
know your name, but you speak only in an alien language. You 
speak only in an alien language. You no longer speak the English 
language, but you speak an alien language, which is a series of 
bleeps, blurps, blups, whatever they are, but you only speak in an 
alien language. 
Wide awake my dear. So anyway, as we were talking about 
earlier…

FAKE!
Debra, I’m trying to do something up here. Can you just sit down and 
chill? Pretty soon I’m going to send Samantha, Miranda, Melissa or 
whatever her name is down there and she’s going to have a word 
with you. Wow! That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. 
Hey Patrick, sleep! Listen very carefully. I know you’ve got one good 
arm and that’s all you need to be a Sheriff, okay? That’s all you need 
to be a Sheriff is that one good arm, buddy. It’s the best arm ever. I 
mean that arm is not just an arm, it is a gun. I mean it’s a big gun. 
You’re a big gunned armed guy and you can do anything you want 
with this big gun. 
We’re talking just about your arm. That’s the big gun. So right now, 
sleep. Sleep very deeply and you’re going to be the big gunned one-
armed Sheriff. Wide awake. Okay, good. 
So what I’m doing now is I’m framing for a new skit. I keep setting up these 
frames. I like to play with my audience and my subjects. I like to get close
up and personal because it’s a lot of fun to do that. That’s why I like 
hypnosis.
FAKE!
Debra, I’ve had enough of you, sleep!
And that’s how you take care of people like that.
Applause
It looks really good, but you interject all these sayings when you’re doing 
these skits. You just interject them so that you set the pace for what the rest 
of the show is going to be like and there are so many different things that 
we’re going to get into later.
Oh boy, I don’t know why she keeps falling asleep. 
Up. Linda, come up here for a minute would you please? Can you do 
me a favor? She keeps falling down and going to sleep and it’s just 
bothering me. A minute ago we were on the beach having a good 
time and here she is falling asleep. Can you tell her to wake up?
Beep- beep.

Hello, Sheriff. 
Hi.
How are you doing?

You know I’m having some problems up here with some of these 
people. What do have there?
My big gun.
That is your big gun, isn’t it? What are you going to do with it?
I might have to shoot somebody.
I’ll tell you what, the next time one of these people get out of line, I

Okay, so you know what where did you get that gun?
Someone gave me it.
Oh, somebody gave it to you? Nice. Yeah, it had to be a pretty cool 
person, right? I would think so. Yeah, whoever gave that to you, you 
better remember who that was because they were very cool. 
Yeah.
Yeah, very cool. 
Your name?
Debra.
All right, have a seat there by Debra, if you would please. Give the 
Sheriff a round of applause. Make him feel good.

Okay. What are we doing here? I want you to really understand that. Is 
everybody getting what I’m doing here? Is it making sense? 
Yes.
Is it adding a new level to what we’re doing here in this class?
Yes.
Is it helping to bring it all together for you now?
Yes.
So now you realize that yesterday was worth all the exhaustion, right?

I always put people to sleep before I do the next routine. Of course, we 
have music in the background between routines– our little ditty– By the time 
we get to your show on Sunday, guys, it’s going to be tight.

Warm Up 3: Horse Race
In a moment, I’m going to count to three. At number three, you’re
going to sit in your chairs and we’re going to go to the races. You 
guys are all going to be on a horse. We’re going to have a good time.
Before you get on that horse, though, what I want you to do is just go 
ahead and grab onto the reins if you would, please. Hold onto the 
reins. Grab the reins. There you go. 
Now, watch what I’m doing. I’m saying, right now reach out and grab the 
reins. I want to make sure I’ve got some really good responsive people up 
there. If they’re not grabbing the reins they may not be the best subjects. So 
I’m watching at all times. 
Grab the reins. Get ready. On number three, we’re going to go ride. 
We’re going to go for that race. Get ready now. I’m going to give you 
a number– number one, number two, number three, number r and 
number 5. 
Get ready on number three. When the music begins, I want you to 
ride that pony. Ride that pony as hard as you can. Make sure your 
stuck in your chair. That pony will not leave the stage. Get ready 
now. 1-2-3, ride that horse! Keep on riding that horse. Come on, let it 
go. Come on, ride that horse. There you go. 
Come on number two. Go number two. Go on number one faster and 
faster number one. Go number one. Go number three. Go, go, go. 
Here comes number four riding that horse. There you go. Come on 
number five. Hurry. There you go. 
Keep on going number three faster and faster. Come on, reach down 
there and give that horse a hug. Give your horse a hug. It’s working 
hard for you. There you go. Slap it on the butt. Slap it on the butt. Oh 
there you go. Nice. Give it a little kiss. It’s working hard for you. Give 
it a kiss. There you go. Yeah, ride that horse. Sit back on your horse 
now. Come on, get it going.
The race is on. The race is on. Here comes number one, number 
two, number three. Number three is coming down faster and faster. 
Number two to the side. Number two, keep over. Oh watch out, 
number two. Number two get number three out of the way. Push him 
over just a little bit. Push him over.
Come on number four. Get number three out of the way. Push 
number three over. Come on. Come on. Get her out of the way. 
Come on. Get some reaction. There you go.

22
                                
Come on. Get him out of the way. Come on. You know you want to 
get that prize because the prize is out there in front of you. The race 
is out there. There you are. There you are. 
You’re getting to the finish. You’re getting to the finish. The first one 
to the finish is going to win $1 million. You want to get it. Reach out 
there. Reach out there. Get your horse’s head out there. Come on. 
You’re going to win by a nose. There you go. Here you go. And 
sleep! Way down.
Give them a round of applause. Make them feel good.
Applause
So, another little example of the fun that we can have. You’re limited only 
by your own creative imagination. In a little bit, you too will be doing this for 
people riding a horse. Even you will be on a horse yourself. Who wants to 
go for a horse ride? Wanna ride the pony? Okay, very good it’s the same 
thing.
After you’ve done your preshow and you begin your routines, this is what 
we’re going to do for the rest of the evening. We’re going to go from one 
routine to another. Between each routine, you’ve got music playing in the 
background so there’s no dead space. 
As you’re doing your set-up here, you’re picking out people that you want to 
use one-on-one. So you’re giving them a pre-hypnotic suggestion. You’re 
either working on them here, or you’ll take a couple people and you’ll put 
them out here in the audience so you can play with them out there because 
everybody likes to see somebody coming out next to them. 
Are you okay, Patrick? Do you know everybody? Relax. Let yourself 
relax down. Just sleep. Go inside and become nice and peaceful 
inside. There you go. Relax comfortably. There you go everything 
nice, loose and relaxed, very comfortable inside and breathing easy. 
There you go.
I noticed he was breathing a little bit funny. I’m going to always watch out 
for my volunteers. You guys need to do that also because you never know 
where a person’s coming from. It was probably no big deal, but still, there’s 
always something in your mind going, are you breathing right? Is there 
something going on? 
Always- always- always take care of your subjects no matter what you do, 
because sometimes you can do some routines that were very fast and high-
paced and might be over the energy level for some people. So you always 
have to be cautious about that. Also when you’re picking subjects to do 
specific routines, you’ve got to be very careful about that.

be any more hypnotized than this, but listen very carefully. For the 
rest of the day, you’re going to enjoy telling everyone what a 
fantastic time you had coming up here and getting hypnotized. 
You’re going to have a fantastic time going out there into the world 
and telling everybody what a fantastic time you had learning stage 
hypnosis and you’re going to tell them who taught you, and you’re 
going to enjoy telling everybody to visit our websites. 
Okay, I’m going to count to three. Open your eyes, wide awake. All

Q&A Session
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
All right, so we’ve gone through some routines here and we’ve played with 
them a little bit. What I’d like to do is open it up for the next few minutes for 
some questions. I’m sure that some of you have some questions on what 
on Earth I’m doing? There’s one guy right there, please stand up.
I have a question around safety. Basically, you thought this fellow was 
breathing abnormally. 
Would you actually get the person out of trance first before making sure the 
person is okay or do you still keep them in trance?
No, I’d rather have the person in trance and give him a direct suggestion to 
be calm, cool and relaxed because you’re talking to the unconscious mind, 
much more effective. The hypnotist is perfect for emergencies because 
you’re dealing with the unconscious mind. 
One time I came upon an accident. I’ve told this story before. I had one of 
my sons with me. This has been years ago. We came upon an accident. It 
was in the wintertime. This little Volkswagen Bug had run into the back of 
this truck, this flatbed, and it went into the back window of the truck and 
smashed through. This woman who was driving it, it cut her open and her 
top lip was just hanging down. Her teeth were all jutted back and blood was 
just dripping everywhere.
My son said dad, are you going to stop and help her. I said, no. The 
paramedics will be here. He goes, dad, no, you’ve got to stop and help her, 
so I said okay. We stopped and we were the first ones on the scene, so I 
got out of the car and she was obviously in shock.
I just said, look at me. Listen very carefully. Because I know she’s already
in a hypnotic state of mind. Blood stop flowing! You are calm and 
comfortable. Everything inside is becoming calm and comfortable right now. 
The blood is stopping. Everything is easy and soft.
The blood stopped and all the sudden she went from screaming like crazy 
to ahhh. Okay? You guys have some amazing gifts. Being a stage 
hypnotist, you’re going to learn things that nobody else will learn. You can 
be a hypnotist – a clinical hypnotist – but you’re going to learn more things 
by doing stage work than you could ever imagine possible. Trust me on 
this.

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
25
                                
It’s so amazing the things that you’ll be able to do to help people because 
your confidence will all the sudden really begin to skyrocket with the skills 
that you’re learning through what you’re doing over these four days. You 
can take and transfer these out there on the street in real life emergencies if 
you need to, realizing that you’re not a medical doctor and that I’m not 
offering treating, diagnosing or curing. But the things you can do, you can 
be very, very helpful.
Any other questions? Yes, right there?
Another question about a safety issue. When it comes to making people 
imagine that they’re smoking dope, what about if someone has had, say, 
atenolol, and that could trigger and asthma attack on stage?
If they had what?
What if that could trigger an asthma attack on stage?
Anything is possible, and that’s why I say, whether you’re a stage performer 
or whatever, I mean anything is possible, and that’s why I always stress –
listen, always pay attention to your subjects and watch them. I mean we 
can’t predict what’s going to happen ever. Even in a class like this or any 
kind of training, we can never predict. All we can do is just watch and notice 
and do our best to offer support to another human being.
Would that be something that we could use in our pre-talk to the audience, 
so people who have an illness or people who are pregnant not to get up as 
volunteers?
You can use that in the pre-talk. If I see somebody that comes up here and 
they’re a small child or they’re pregnant, I’m going to say, well, I think that 
you’ve already had a good time, so I’m going to send you back to the 
audience.
Laughter
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
Because I don’t want a pregnant woman up here. I really don’t. So there are 
things that you’ll learn that you can be very tactful about. She wants to be 
up there. Say, I really congratulate you for wanting to come up here, but 
you’re going to feel much safer out here. Okay?
Before you release everybody, is it ever necessary to cancel any of the 
suggestions?

Spencer:
Is it necessary to cancel any of the suggestions? No. Yes. Yes. No. Well, 
here, listen, people always ask, man if you hypnotize somebody, is it going 
to stick forever? Obviously not, but it could but not the way that you think. 
Usually what happens is that after you’re done with the show, pretty soon 
people will go whew and come back to their senses because this is just like 
a big dream up here anyway. 
I always at the end of the show – we haven’t even got to that part yet – I’ll 
always end the show with:
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. I will say wake up and then 
you’re going to feel fantastic in every way. All suggestions are now 
removed, except for just a couple. One of those suggestions I’m 
going to leave you with is that you can tell all your friends what a 
fantastic time you had coming out to the hypnosis show, and you’re 
going to invite them to come back over and over again and to visit 
my website.
All right. These are things that I do. The second suggestion is I always give 
my subjects up here positive motivation because they put it all out here by 
coming up here. So I give them a gift and that gift that is the other 
suggestion that I will let them keep if they choose to. So it’s a positive 
suggestion. Maybe they want to stop smoking or lose weight or have more 
confidence, more success. So I try to instill something valuable for them for 
coming up there and volunteering. 
Okay and your next question would be…
My question is, when you put these people to sleep, in terms of their 
physical gesture, if it’s an uncomfortable one, it’s very easy to let them go 
out of hypnosis because it’s uncomfortable.
Do your question is if I have people up here and they’re laying across each 
other and if they’re uncomfortable, will that cause them to come out of 
hypnosis? Is that the question?
Yes.
Yes, they can. Not always, but they can. There again, I’m watching them. 
So I’m going to notice. If I think a person is uncomfortable – yes you were a 
little bit yesterday. 
This morning.
This morning. The days are all running together. But when you’re doing a 
show, you’re going to watch all this. When you’re doing a show, you’re 
going to notice that probably everybody is just there. They’re just all on top 
of each other having a good time, so you’ll watch them it’s the same thing. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
27
                                
You watch out for their comfort level because it can. I’ve heard people say 
well, I was doing really good until that person touched me. Then I kind of 
popped out of it. Then they don’t go back into trance. I just invite them off 
the stage. 
You let them off, or do you try to resolve the issue by readjusting and stuff?
It depends on what I’m noticing at the moment. I mean that’s kind of a 
judgment call that you’re going to have to make, that I make every time. If 
it’s something simple, I may just readjust people and just say sleep and put 
them back so they don’t feel uncomfortable. Or, if I think by looking at them 
that it’s going to be a problem. Then I might say, you know what, I think 
you’ll have more fun out in the audience. Thank you very much for coming 
up here.
Okay. Can I have a quick second question, just out of my own curiosity?
When you asked Michael to come up with all these female names, a lot of 
them come with an ‘M’ to start. Does that anything to do with the fact his 
name is Michael?
Does it have anything to do with it? I don’t have a clue, actually. 
Right here, yes? Do you have a microphone?
I was wondering, I forget what his name is, the guy that didn’t have a name 
tag. He didn’t seem like he was responsive and animated as the other 
participants. Would that be kind of the person you’d want to maybe ease off 
stage and back into the audience.
And I’m so glad that you asked, and I’m so glad that you noticed that. Who 
else noticed that? Yeah. Most of you noticed that. And did you notice I 
didn’t really do much with him? I just played around it because sometimes 
it’s better just to keep somebody up there and work around him, instead of 
just dismissing him in the middle of what you’re doing. 
I’m glad you guys noticed that, and that’s an excellent question. Good 
observation. 
Yeah, my question has to do with the arrangement of the skits. I was just 
wondering whether or not – do you start with easier skits because it 
seemed like, by going up you’re going to have like amnesia, when you did 
your thing, it started like hot and cold or do you just go and start anywhere? 
Make an easy one, kind of like build their hypnotic trance up until you get it 
right. Like you don’t know your name or…

Student:
Experience will be your best teacher. I mean that’s the best answer I have 
for you. I mean you’re going to have some groups of people where you can 
do absolutely anything with, and it doesn’t matter what the order is. 
That said, what I do in my shows is I always do two or three things as a 
group first. I usually always do two or three things as a group because 
when you get the group going together, this group dynamic, it makes it 
easier for people to now be individually sought out and utilized. 
So I will always do a group thing because that way the pressure’s on. We’re 
all doing this, and they all feel good about it. Then, of course, the more a 
person responds to a suggestion or an idea, what happens? 
They turn into a star?
They turn into a star, yeah. But each time that you give a person an idea 
and they act upon it, it makes it easier for them to accept successive 
suggestions. Every time you give a person a suggestion in hypnosis and 
they respond, they just go even deeper into trance. 
So the order is not that important. There again, that will come with 
experience. For example, if you’re doing a high school graduation night. 
High school kids, easy. You can do whatever you want with them. You can 
go, sleep! They’ll drop like butterflies.
So there are a lot of variations. Corporate crowds, it’s going to be a little bit 
different. There again, experience. So the more people that you’ve got, the 
easier it’s going to be for you to determine what you’re going to do. 
I have a routine that I follow. I have my skits that I do in every show. That’s 
what I do. I’ve done it for years. I love it, and it just works. I’m not going to 
reinvent my own wheel, but I reinvent a lot of my presentation because 
times are changing. A lot of the stuff is the same thing. It works for me. It’s a 
natural flow. I can do it in my sleep. And within the routines that I have, I 
have a lot of different variations that I can go off into.
So if I’m doing something and I’m thinking, oops, this is getting the kind of 
response I want, then I just simply switch and do something else. If I can’t 
go in the front door, I’m going to go into the back door. If the back door 
doesn’t work, I’m going to go into the side door. However I can get them.
Is it possible that a person may not be able to act out or experience 
something you’re suggestion. Let’s say if somebody has never been drunk. 
Let’s say somebody’s never done pot. Let’s say whatever. What will 
happen? Will that person maybe come out of the trance? Will they just sit 
there and go, duh!

One of two things will happen. 
Everybody has seen somebody drunk or stoned. That’s kind of a no brainer. 
Even if you’ve never had the experience, most of us have seen somebody 
on TV. You can’t get away from it in the United States of America. Foreign 
countries, you can. But here, you can do whatever you want so people have 
had that experience, so they know what it looks like and they can emulate 
it. 
Now there will be different cultures that you go to or different streams of 
society where it’s not appropriate. For example, I was doing a show and 
everybody was following along really good with everything that I did. This 
one lady was fantastic and I thought, oh, I’m going to use her because 
she’s cool. I was doing this routine and everybody’s going to get a drink. 
There you go. Have a drink. She goes, I’m sorry, but it’s against my religion. 
She’s a good Mormon woman, but it was against her religion. Now other 
Mormons may have been a little naughtier than her, but for her, she was 
sticking to her vows and covenants, which is awesome. So that was cool. I 
said, okay. Have a soda instead. 
There again, improvise, improvise, improvise. Any other questions on what 
we’ve been doing? Yes?
Just as a standard, you talked about a $5,000 show, or a $10,000 show. 
How long is your show, and how many…
As quick as possible to get the most amount of money as I can.
Just as a parameter. I mean you’ve got to give them at least an hour or an 
hour and a half, I guess. Also how many skits might you go through in a 
standard show?
It depends. I have about 50 routines that I have. I go through maybe about 
16 or 17. 
In how much time?
I give myself anywhere between 60 and 75 minutes max. No more than 
that. Why don’t you want to do it longer then that? Because people don’t 
have an attention span for something longer then that. If you get up there 
and do a show, sizzle it, make it look hot and then get off the stage, man, 
and just let them drip for me. That was great! Come back for more.
If you draw it out too long, it just can become boring. I had a conflict when I 
was doing a show at the theater because this guy, man, he just really 
irritated me, but he wanted me to do half the show, and then he wanted to

take an Intermission for like 20 minutes so he could sell popcorn and 
concessions right, and then do the other half of the show. 
I did it. It didn’t matter. I didn’t care. Everybody was on stage and at 
Intermission time, I just said, and sleep! I made sure they were all laid out 
on the floor. So they were all just laying on the floor sleeping for about 10 or 
15 minutes. 
I went to the back room and had a drink and some popcorn and stuff like 
that. Everybody had their thing. Then I’d go back and change my clothes. 
I’d come back on stage and I just framed it so it was nice. So when 
Intermission was over, I’m back up there. The lights come back on and we 
had this music playing.
Then I say, are you guys ready to get back on with the show? We’re going 
to have a great time. In just a moment, I am going to count to three. At 
number 3, the music will begin. Everybody on the floor get up off the floor 
and you will begin to respond to whatever the suggestion was at that point. 
You can do it. I don’t recommend it, but when you do a show for 6 ½ solid 
years, every Saturday night, you learn a lot of skills and a lot of things you 
can do that really makes things different for what you’re doing – the 
dynamics of doing a show for groups. 
You mentioned before that often you can’t see out into the audience 
because of the lights. So how are you picking people based on 
suggestibility tests? I mean how does that work if you can’t see what’s 
going on in the audience?
Well, I don’t need to see what’s going on in the audience. I mean I just have 
them put their hands up. I say, if you’re hands are stuck and if you want to 
have fun, come up to the stage. 
Then again, if you take that a little bit further, when I have everybody up 
here, they’re sleeping and I’m doing the induction and people are out there 
in the audience, some may be going to sleep. I’ll say if there’s anybody out 
there – if it’s a lighting issue –that appears to be in hypnosis next to you, 
please raise your hand. 
Then I have this coordinated with the lighting director, and they bring the 
house lights up about halfway, so I can look out and see what’s happening. 
Then when the show goes back on, the lights come down and we just want 
the lights right here on the stage. All the focus is right here on the stage, on 
you and on your subjects.
Applause Thank you.

Naughty Routines
Spencer:
Let me talk about one girl here that you haven’t met yet. Her name is 
Bonnie, and she is my blow-up doll. People ask about a little bit more risqué 
things. So let me address that because people want to know about it. I’m 
not here to teach a risqué show, but whenever you get to do a show, if you 
want to be a little bit more risqué, you can do that.
Let me give you, from my experience over the last 20 odd years of doing 
stage hypnosis shows around the world and doing entertainment, if you do 
a show that attracts all audiences, you’ll have more fun and you’ll make 
more money. 
That said, I do have Bonnie, she’s a blow-up doll. I dress her in clothes, it’s 
kind of fun routine. It doesn’t have to be a naughty routine, but it’s kind of 
fine because people will see the blow-up doll, and immediately their mind 
gets naughty because of the blow-up doll, and her name’s Bonnie. She 
wears a mini skirt, and she’s kind of cute. 
So anyway, I’ll bring her up on stage and I’ll say, 
Listen, in a moment, I’m going to count to the three. I’ve got this 
beautiful woman up here. Open your eyes. It’s like the person I’m 
touching right now, you want to dance with her so bad, and she’s like 
the cutest thing ever. You really want to be with her. She’s hot. 
Then I’ll say 1-2-3 and the music will play, and I’ll be sitting here talking to 
this blow-up doll, and they’re all back there watching me. Pretty soon this 
guy comes up there and he’s like, hey, hey, hey. I want to talk to her. So I 
can use a blow-up doll in that kind of routine in any kind of setting and keep 
it clean and fun.
If I see somebody starting to overboard, then I’ll just say, whoa, hands off, 
sleep! Just change the mood very quickly so that I don’t offend people. But 
you can go to a certain level of non-offensiveness with just about anything 
and have fun and keep it clean at the same time. 
The most successful people are the ones who keep their shows clean. So I 
really want to emphasize that. If you do that, you’re going to have a good 
time. There are people out there who are the XXX hypnotists and stuff like 
that. Some people like that. Pick your battles wisely. If you want to be rich 
and successful and make more money than anybody else in this business, 
keep it clean. Have a good time. The most successful person here in Las 
Vegas, not a hypnotist, was always a clean act. Just a little heads up for 
you on that.

If you’re doing a gig for a corporate environment, I mean I wouldn’t talk 
about smoking weed or something like that in there. So I’m sure you have a 
list of skits that you would do besides the ones that you did tonight?
Oh yeah, we have more skits that we’re going to go into. Yeah, definitely. 
There again, what I said earlier was when somebody books me, they send 
me an email and say, I want to hire you buddy boy. You look like the guy for 
us. I say, cool. Then I talk to them on the phone – and we’ll get into the 
business aspect tomorrow on how to book gigs and how to talk to your 
clients.
My question is like, okay, well, what kind of a show do you want? This is 
your show. It’s your money. I give them options– G, PG, PG17, R– you tell 
me. I let them tell me. Then I do that kind of show because they’re paying 
the money. 
Yes, Jay?
Yeah, so you actually my mind moving a little bit more with regards to the 
blow-up doll.
Laughter
What other props would you suggest that we use?
Well, I think Bonnie’s enough for you.
Laughter
Don’t tell my wife.
I’m going to tell your wife. I’ll probably sit by her on an airplane again. I use 
a lot of different props. A lot of props I use depending on the routine. Maybe 
I’ll have a couple of guys dancing together, and get some of those feather 
boas and put them on them and make them foo foo kind of guys, and just 
have fun like that.
Maybe I’ll put a wig on somebody and turn them into some kind of other 
character. Maybe I’ll give them a plastic air guitar to play or drumsticks or 
whatever. There again, you’re only limited by your own creative 
imagination. 
I can tell you everything I can do, or you might learn better just by using
your own creative imagination and thinking, what could I do if I could? If I 
could do anything I wanted to do, what would I do? If I could be anything I 
wanted to be on stage, who would I be? Get crazy with it. Have fun. Maybe

you want to be – I am Jake with Bonnie the Blow-up Doll as my sidekick. 
She will hypnotize you. Look into her eyes, and only her eyes. 
So there are a lot of things that you can frame in a way that’s fun and still 
safe for people. Any other questions? No, wow! Have you guys learned 
everything you needed to learn in this segment?
No.
Then you haven’t asked enough questions. 
I misunderstood you. This is great!
Oh, there’s more to learn, we are not done by a long shot. We just keep 
building and building and building and building and building, and it will not 
collapse. It will just continue to expand. 
I wanted to ask what would be the best route to take as far as like putting 
your own skit together. I know your imagination is the best way to go, but 
what would be a good way theme wise to start or even help us with that 
also. Like okay, can we sit down? Do we have exercises on putting our own 
thing together?
What we have is we have some specific exercises that we want you to go 
through because it’s going to be easier for you guys to get this if we have 
things already put together and I demonstrate. You’re going to see that 
what I demonstrated, you guys will get out there and do this also. I want you 
to be comfortable watching what I do and apply it to yourselves. Because 
you’ve seen it it’s like okay, I can do that. 
Then from there, man, let your imagination go crazy. 
Okay. That’s all I wanted to know.
So you could go to YouTube. Go to hypnotist shows. Do whatever you want 
to, to see what other people are doing and see what makes sense to you. 
Myself, I just used to watch comedy shows all the time and watch 
comedians. They were always kind of goofy. Their minds work goofy. So I 
hung around with a lot of comics.
In the early days, I’d always work with comics. They would be an opening 
act for me, and then I’d be the headliner. We’ll talk more about that in the 
business aspect of it. You know, when you go out there and you want to 
book yourself because you’re never an opening act hypnotist. 
The hypnotist is not an opening act. You are the headliner. You’re the 
headliner; you ain’t opening act. You ain’t no 20-minute skididdle out there. 
You’re the big honcho when you get out there.

How do you decide who does what?
How do I decide who does what?
Yeah.
I’m the conductor. This is my orchestra, and it’s up to me to determine who 
plays the drums and who plays what. For example, in the band, I just said, 
you’re in a band and you’re all playing an instrument. You pick the 
instrument you wanted. You had the trombone thing going. You wanted the 
big trombone. 
But for the other, like the individual skits, was there – did you just pick, or 
were you looking for certain things to decide who was going to do which 
individual little bit?
Well, I always look for that person who I think is going to be a lot of fun and 
be very animated. So I’m always looking for the number one because you 
may have a group of people up here, and may have some people who are 
good and some who are maybe not as good. So I’m going to be looking for 
the very best subjects to do all the different skits with. So that’s what I’m 
looking for.
Other than that, there’s no rhyme or reason for it. It depends on the routine. 
If the routine calls for two women, or a woman and a man, or a man, or two 
men or whatever, I’ll pick according to whatever my skit is at the moment. 
Other than that, it’s a free for all. It is a free for all in the mind. 
Any other questions are we done? We have 30 seconds? Oh, we’re done. 
You’ve got five seconds.
Do you keep a cheat sheet up there?
Huh? How offended am I by that? Of course I do. No I don’t. No. No. I do 
have them memorized. I do have a sheet up there by my sound technician. 
They’ll have one, but they don’t even use that. They just use my computer. I 
just take my computer and everything’s on there. So they use the whole 
thing. But I’ve got everything in my mind. 
I’ve memorized it. So you memorize your own thing too because there’s 
nothing that looks worse than this. So be professional and work out the 
routines. I mean really, take the time to do it. We’ll go into that because 
even before I do a show, when I’m in the room with the DJ setting up, I go 
through the entire show in my mind with him, live, music playing, everything 
to make sure that he’s on cue with me, and that we’re on the same page.

You’re going to get to a point where you will begin to have dreams of being 
a stage hypnotist. I’m wondering just by a raise of hands – and then you 
can get out of here for a break – how many people had dreams last night 
about being a stage hypnotist? Very cool. 
Here’s what one of my martial arts teachers told me. He said, when you 
begin to dream it, you become it. When you begin to dream it, it’s becoming 
absorbed inside of your body. It becomes a part of you.
So with that said, I am going to give you guys a boot for a few minutes. 
When you come back, we’ll have some more fun.
Applause
