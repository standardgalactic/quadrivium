“There are many books about 
UX, but few dare to take on the 
entire spectrum of UX work. 
UX for Beginners does that 
and does it well. It gives the 
beginner a broad view into the 
field encouraging them to dig 
deeper into the areas where 
they are most passionate.”

Preface

This Book Exists Because It Is Needed
(i.e., My “user research” uncovered a problem.)
Originally, these lessons were an email newsletter. Throughout 
my time working with startups, famous global brands, and 
in-house product teams, I was asked the same basic UX 
questions over and over, everywhere I worked. So, I decided 
to start a newsletter of UX ProTips, for my coworkers.
Once a week, I would write a short, funny lesson about 
one simple UX thing and email it to the company. These 
people were busy, and not experts, and they needed to be 
entertained if I expected them to learn about someone else’s 
job (mine).
In other words, they were beginners.
At first, I was worried about seeming arrogant or annoying, 
but everybody loved it! They even started sending me 
questions to answer. It didn’t take long before I started 
hearing my answers being repeated to clients in meetings, 
and people outside of our company would reply, asking how 
they could subscribe!
Soon after that, I noticed that the most popular question 
in UX forums was “What should I read to get started 
in UX?” And thus, my ProTips became a blog: www.
TheHipperElement.com. My first big project for the blog 
was the UX Crash Course. Thirty-one daily lessons about 
the most fundamental things in UX, which I posted every 
day in January, 2014. It was a huge success. Much bigger 
than expected. That Crash Course has now been read over a 
million times without paying a cent for promotion.
This Book Truly Practices What It Preaches
It started as an email newsletter, grew into a blog, became 
viral, and now you have it. The format of the book is based 
on science and research with real readers. It was then 
reviewed by some of the industry’s leading UXers—all to 
make it as engaging and useful as possible. We even gathered 
feedback from the Internet while we were writing it!
x   
﻿

is always useful, especially an easy, funny one like this. But, 
more important, being a manager also means that you are in 
a position to teach UX, and this book has been created for 
that reason, too. Use it as a reference or as a way to kick-start 
conversations with your team. Sometimes the most valuable 
thing is a good book that backs you up.
And finally, you might have experience in something relevant, 
like programming, or project management, or sales, but now 
you need to know more about UX design. Thanks for realizing 
that UX is a core element in all digital products and services! 
This book is a great place for you to initiate yourself and 
learn to “talk the talk” while building a solid understanding 
of the people who “walk the walk.” And if you aspire to go 
sideways into a design position in the future, fantastic!
How the Book Is Structured
(i.e., The “Information Architecture” of this book)
There are 100 lessons, grouped into sections, and they 
roughly follow the real process of doing UX on a real project. 
So if you are sitting at your first UX job right now, just start 
reading and it will feel like we’re working on it together. Also, 
try not to laugh too loud at my jokes, people will think you’re 
a weirdo.
You won’t find any long case studies, or complex diagrams, 
or chapters that do a “deep dive” on a specific topic. This 
book is designed to be a quick-and-dirty introduction to User 
Experience design. The lessons are short, and did I mention 
how funny and modest I am?
That blog is the motivation for this book. And if you want 
even more proof that there was a need, consider this: we 
were able to use the title UX for Beginners because it had 
never been used! And we’re talking about a job that was 
ranked fourteenth on a list of the most in-demand jobs in 
America in 2015!
Who Is This Book For?
(i.e., My “user profiles”)
Even if you still don’t understand what I mean by “UX”— it’s 
short for User eXperience, by the way—you’re in the right 
place. This book is written for three types of people: non-
designers who want to become designers, managers of UX 
designers, and experienced people from other jobs who want 
to learn more about UX.
If you’re a non-designer, this book is specifically for you. 
My mission is to create more designers by teaching the 
fundamentals in a simple way—something that is surprisingly 
hard to find. This isn’t just a book about “thinking like a 
designer” or “the UX mentality,” it is a practical set of lessons 
that teach what to do; how to be a UX designer on the first 
day of your first job. If you’re a student, or an intern, or a 
recent graduate that feels intimidated by doing UX “for real,” 
welcome. We need you.
If you manage UX designers, you’re either a designer yourself 
or you have the authority to enable or disable the designers 
on your team. Either way, the more time you spend managing 
design, the less time you spend doing design, so a refresher 
﻿This Book Truly Practices What It Preaches    xi

•	 In Behavior Basics, User Research, and The Limits of Our 
Minds, you will learn the fundamentals of understand­
ing how and why humans do what they do, and how 
to investigate when your users do something you don’t 
expect.
•	 The sections Information Architecture and Designing 
Behavior start to combine the basic ideas from the pre­
vious sections into your craft. The process and science of 
User Experience design. For a lot of people that might be 
a whole new way of thinking about design in general.
Then you start to actually design things:
•	 Visual Design Principles come before the Wireframing 
& Prototypes in this book, because making good wire­
frames—your main document as a UX designer—requires 
an understanding of how design works, not just what 
it looks like. After you understand how the size, color, 
and layout of your design can influence the user, you will 
learn how to make wireframes, and how not to make 
wireframes.
•	 In Psychology of Usability and Content, you will learn how 
to make your designs feel easier and more persuasive, so 
more people will use them.
•	 The Moment of Truth is critical: the launch.
•	 After the launch, any good UX designer will measure how 
their design works in the real world, with real users. You’ll 
learn about that in the section called Data for Designers. 
Don’t worry, there are no equations or anything… it’s 
mostly pictures. ;)
Although it’s quick, this book covers a lot. It may not be every 
UX-related topic in the world, but it introduces plenty. I have 
specifically focused on things that a beginner needs, so more 
advanced ideas like iteration or “lean” and “agile” processes, 
or contextual design, or design critiques, or accessibility and 
stuff like that are not covered in detail. That’s for designers 
with more experience. You can Google those things or read 
one of the other fine books that O’Reilly offers on those 
subjects.
All of the 100 lessons are self-contained: you don’t have to 
read them in order if you don’t want to. If there is something 
special you want to learn or if you want to keep it on your 
desk as a reference, do it! It’s also great to just have “around” 
for people to read on a coffee break.
The lessons are grouped into 14 sections:
•	 First, in the section called Key Ideas, you will learn some 
basic concepts. UX design can be counterintuitive some­
times, and a lot of your “common sense” will lead you in 
the wrong direction. If you have never designed anything 
before, take the time to read each of those lessons and 
think about them before continuing.
•	 In the section called Before You Start, you’ll learn some 
practical stuff that will prepare you for conversations later 
in the process. If you work in a big company, those parts 
will bite you in the ass if you skip them.

UX should be. Some people call that “empathy.” I just think 
it’s how good product design works.
If you think the book could be better in any way, or if you 
have a story about how it helped you be a better designer, 
please tell me on Twitter: @HipperElement
And seriously, share this book with someone if you like it. 
Those llamas aren’t going to feed themselves.
Enjoy!
Acknowledgements
This book could not have been made without the UX 
community itself, my most curious students, my most talented 
interns, and every colleague I have had over the past decade 
or so. Their questions, feedback, interest, and general lack of 
attention span (haha) have all come together in this book and 
the work related to it.
Thanks to my girlfriend, Camilla, for dealing with all the 
mornings when I got up to write a daily UX Crash Course 
lesson (and therefore barely spoke to her), and to my friends 
for not rolling their eyes when I begin a sentence with “On 
my blog…” or “In my book…”
I would also like to acknowledge anyone and everyone who 
actually takes the time to be a really good UX designer, 
whether you start here or not. 
We, my friends, are defining the future in real time.
•	 And finally, in Get A Job You Dirty Hippy, you’ll learn 
a few things about what UX role is right for you, what 
should be in your portfolio, and what you might actually 
do all day at your first design job.
We even threw in some amazing illustrations to make it more 
visual, easier to understand, more fun, and because every 
great author needs a few rubber ducks to get their point 
across. Obviously.
“I always include rubber ducks. Always.”—Ernest Hemingway
The Main Goals of this Book
Like any good UX project, this book has two goals:
•	 To make more UX designers
•	 To make me a millionaire
In other words, a user goal and a business goal.
BUT: 
I only achieve goal #2 if I achieve goal #1 in a spectacular 
way. The better I am at turning you into a great UX designer, 
the more you will share and discuss this book with others, 
making even more UX designers, and giving me the funds I 
need to finally have a llama farm in my backyard.
Every designer’s dream, am I right?
So I needed to make this book a great experience for you 
if I really want to start my million-dollar llama empire. If I 
succeed, we both win. If I fail, we both lose. That’s the way

Key Ideas

Everything has a user experience. Your job is not to 
create the user experience. Your job is to make it 
good.
And what do I mean by “good” user experience? It is 
common to think that a good user experience is one that 
makes users happy.
Not true!
If happiness was your only goal, you could just throw in 
some Lolcats and random compliments and go home. 
But—although that’s not the worst universe I can 
imagine—your boss may not be satisfied with the results. 
The goal of a UX designer is to make users effective.
A user’s experience is just the tip of the iceberg:
Many people mistakenly think that “UX” means a user’s 
experience, but it is actually about “doing” the process of 
User Experience Design. A user’s individual experience is their 
conscious, subjective opinion of your app or site. User feed­
back is important—sometimes—but UX designers need to do 
a lot more than that.
“Doing” UX
UX Design (also sometimes called UXD) involves a process 
very similar to doing science: you do research to understand 
the users, you develop ideas to solve the users’ needs—and 
the needs of the business—and you build and measure those 
solutions in the real world to see if they work.
You will learn about all of that in this book. Or if that’s not 
your deal, Lolcats are still an option.
LESSON 1
What Is UX?
The best place to start any education is at the beginning.
2   
Key Ideas

Ask yourself:
–– What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first 
place?
–– How does this make them feel?
–– How much work does the user have to do to get 
what they want?
–– What habits are created if they do this over and over?
–– What do they expect when they click this?
–– Are you assuming they know something that they 
haven’t learned yet?
–– Is this something they want to do again? Why? How 
often?
–– Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or 
your own?
–– How are you rewarding good behavior?
Any one of these five ingredients could be a book of its own, 
so I will be oversimplifying a bit. This is supposed to be a crash 
course, not Wikipedia.
Although, to be fair, I’m pretty sure Wikipedia’s UX page was 
written by a guy who heard about UX once… at that thing… 
that time…
1.	 Psychology
A user’s mind is complex. You should know; you have 
one, (I assume). UXers work with subjective thoughts and 
feelings a lot; they can make or break your results. And 
the designer must ignore their own psychology some­
times, too, and that’s hard!
LESSON 2
The Five Main Ingredients of UX
User Experience design is a process, and these lessons roughly 
follow that process, but you should always keep these five things 
in mind: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis.
Lesson 2: The Five Main Ingredients of UX    3

3.	 Design
As the UX designer, your definition of “design” will be 
much less artistic than a lot of designers. Whether you 
“like it” is irrelevant. In UX, design is how it works, and 
it’s something you can prove; it’s not a matter of style.
Ask yourself:
–– Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it 
immediately?
–– Does it communicate the purpose and function with­
out words?
–– Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the 
same site?
–– Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right 
places? How do you know?
–– Do the colors, shapes, and typography help people 
find what they want and improve usability of the 
details?
–– Do clickable things look different than nonclickable 
things?
2.	 Usability
If user psychology is mostly subconscious, usability is 
mostly conscious. You know when something is confus­
ing. There are cases where it is more fun if something is 
hard—like a game—but for everything else, we want it to 
be so easy that even a (moron) could use it.
Ask yourself:
–– Could you get the job done with less input from the 
user?
–– Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: 
Yes, there are.)
–– Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too 
clever?
–– Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or sub­
consciously expected (best)?
–– Are you working with the user’s assumptions or 
against them?
–– Have you provided everything the user needs to 
know?
–– Could you solve this just as well by doing something 
more common?
–– Are you basing your decisions on your own logic 
or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you 
know?
–– If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still 
work/make sense?
4   
Key Ideas

So, ask yourself:
–– Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to 
learn the truth?
–– Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective 
facts?
–– Have you collected information that can give you 
those types of answers?
–– Do you know why users do that, or are you interpret­
ing their behavior?
–– Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative 
improvements?
–– How will you measure this? Are you measuring the 
right things?
–– Are you looking for bad results, too? Why not?
–– How can you use this analysis to make 
improvements?
4.	 Copywriting
There is a huge difference between writing brand copy 
(text) and writing UX copy. Brand copy supports the 
image and values of the company. UX copy gets shit done 
as directly and simply as possible. 
Ask yourself:
–– Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
–– Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is 
that what we want?
–– Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
–– Does it inform the user or does it assume that they 
already understand?
–– Does it reduce anxiety?
–– Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
5.	 Analysis
In my opinion, most designers’ weak spot is analysis. 
But we can fix that! Analysis is the main thing that sep­
arates UX from other types of design, and it makes you 
extremely valuable. It literally pays to be good at it.
Lesson 2: The Five Main Ingredients of UX    5

Do research. Talk to users. Study the data. Cuddle some 
puppies. When you truly understand a problem, it becomes 
your problem, emotionally. That’s empathy. You will feel it. A 
good solution will excite you. Not because you’re an emo­
tional superhero, but because you relate to the users.
You’re one of them now.
*single tear*
Ask yourself:
•	 If you have to choose between a feature for your users 
or having this design in your portfolio, what will you 
choose?
•	 If users don’t like your design, what would probably be 
the reason?
•	 Have you actually tried the software, or are you just click­
ing “next” to get through it?
Know Thyself
There are two things you need to be aware of, about yourself, 
before you can start understanding users well:
•	 You want things that don’t matter to users.
•	 You know things that don’t matter to users.
Meditate on that for a minute.
Namasté.
Empathy: Want What They Want
If there is one word that is over-sold in UX, it’s “empathy”. It 
is important though. It is. In general, and in UX.
But here’s a secret: unless you are a serial killer, you have 
empathy. If you are a serial killer, UX design might not be for 
you. What we want by nature might not be what the users 
want. And that’s a big deal. It means your intuition about the 
users might be wrong!
LESSON 3
Your Perspective
In User Experience design, the way you look at a problem 
can make or break your work. Your own desires and 
experience can even work against the users.
6   
Key Ideas

•	 Are you judging a feature based on the time it will take to 
build it or the value to the user?
•	 Are you assuming users will click it just because it exists? 
(They won’t.)
You Know Too Much
Designing for people who know less than you is a core part 
of UX.
Not people who are dumber than you. People who know less.
You know that your site gets 
more powerful if you custom­
ize it, but users don’t. You 
know that your menu catego­
ries match the teams in your 
company, but users don’t. And 
you know your prices are high 
because licensing fees make 
your content expensive to 
make, but users don’t.
If users don’t know, users don’t 
care. And sometimes even 
when they do know, they don’t 
care! Licensing fees? That’s 
your problem. They can get a 
pirated copy for free.
Ask yourself: 
•	 If you didn’t read the text, 
would you understand?
•	 If a user only had a few 
clicks to find what they 
want, would this design be 
your best bet?
Lesson 3: Your Perspective    7

“What’s in It for Me?”
This is the “why” of user experience. What can the user gain? 
It is better to show users what they will get, rather than tell 
them. You can use a video, demo, example images, free trial, 
sample content, testimonials, or several of those things!
The best answers to “what is it?” also tell you a little about 
what you get. For example, “A global network of megaloma­
niacs cooperating to conquer the world and share funny cat 
pics.” That tells you what it is, and what you get (assuming 
you’re a megalomaniac who loves cats).
REMEMBER
You’re saying what’s in it for them. Not why you want them 
to register/buy/click. 
User motivation is a thousand times more valuable than 
beauty or usability—for the company—but how much time 
do you spend talking about it at work?
A good design communicates three things:
1.	 What is this?
2.	 What is the benefit for the user?
3.	 What should they do next?
“What Is This?”
It is always a good idea to have a title or an image (or both) 
that answers the question: “what is this?” Seems pretty basic, 
right? But it’s amazing how many websites forget to do it. 
Why? Because we already know. But the user doesn’t. Is it 
an article? A registration form? A party for people who love 
lemons? A place to see goats? Your gerbil’s secret YouTube 
channel?
Just tell them. Directly. And use simple words. Nobody is 
excited when you pull out the dictionary at a party. Especially 
not a lemon party.
LESSON 4
The Three “Whats” of User Perspective
Ah, finally! It’s time to discuss the user’s mind, and it’s always 
good to start with the basics and build from there.
8   
Key Ideas

It could be something bigger, like “How do I get started?” or 
“How do I buy?” or “Where do I get more training?” 
There is always a “next” step. Sometimes there are a few 
possibilities. It’s up to you to figure out what the users might 
need, and tell them how to get it.
“What Do I Do?”
If the user understands what it is and they are motivated to 
know or see more, their next action should be obvious in your 
design.
It could be something small, like “What do I click now?” or 
“How do I register?”
Lesson 4: The Three “Whats” of User Perspective    9

for other people—the users—then they 
are not meaningful for you.
That means you have to spend a lot of 
time trying to understand problems that 
mean nothing to you. And that might 
feel unnatural at first. That’s why UX is a 
unique, valuable job: it’s tricky.
Solutions are ideas that can be wrong.
In UX, we can test things. We can design 
more than one solution to the same problem 
and see which one is better. And we can ask 
users which solution they prefer.
This means that UX is a special kind of design: it can 
be wrong. And we can prove that it is wrong. 
And the same solution can be right for one site, and wrong 
for another! Just because Twitter does it, doesn’t mean it’s 
right for you.
All types of designers work with 
ideas. And great ideas are great!
Ideas come in different flavors. 
Some ideas are things we would 
like to make, like, perhaps, a 
fish-and-chocolate soufflé. (“I love 
both of those things! They must be 
great together!”). Some ideas are 
meaningful to us in a personal way, 
like that tattoo that reminds you 
of your pet hamster, Chewy. God 
rest his soul. And some ideas are 
solutions to problems. That’s what 
UX is all about.
Solutions are ideas with meaning for other people.
Unlike most artists and designers, UX designers do not focus 
on the ideas that have meaning for themselves. You should 
care a lot about creativity, but if your ideas are not meaningful 
LESSON 5
Solutions versus Ideas
UX designers must be creative every day. But our definition of 
creativity is less artistic and more analytical than some other 
designers. If you’re not solving problems, you’re not doing UX.
10   
Key Ideas

As a UX designer, your job is to create value—from the user’s 
perspective. Some parts of the UX process create more value 
than others. Spend your time wisely. You will learn about 
every part of the Pyramid throughout the rest of this book. 
For now, just understand that the bottom of the pyramid—
the big layers—are the parts that can destroy a product if 
you ignore them. And they are often invisible. The top of the 
pyramid—the small layers—are the parts that might not add 
value to your product, no matter how much time you spend 
on them. And they are usually visible.
LESSON 6
The Pyramid of UX Impact
UX is a lot more than buttons and wireframes. The stuff 
that seems obvious is only the tip of the iceberg, and 
the stuff that matters most is completely invisible.

Key Ideas

II
Before You Start

These things are often called “metrics” or “Key Performance 
Indicators” (KPIs) by the business-y folks.
Align the goals
The real test of a UX designer is how well you can align those 
goals so the business benefits when the user reaches their 
goal. (Not the other way around!)
YouTube makes money via ads, and users want to find good 
videos. Therefore, putting ads in the videos, or on the same 
page, makes sense. But, more than that, making it easy to 
search for videos and find similar videos will get users to 
watch more, which makes YouTube more money.
If the goals are not aligned, you will have one of two prob­
lems: either users can get what they want without helping 
the business (lots of users, no success), or the users don’t get 
what they want (no users, no success).
User Goals
Users always want something because they are people, and 
people always want something. Whether they are peeking 
at an ex on Facebook, trying to find their next ex on a dating 
site, or looking for sneezing pandas on YouTube, they want 
something.
They might also want to do something productive (or so I am 
told). There is a whole section about user research starting on 
page 61. For now, just assume you know stuff.
Business Goals
Every organization has a reason for creating a site or app 
in the first place. Typically it’s money, but it might be brand 
awareness, or getting new members for a community, etc.
The specific type of business goal is important. If you want to 
show more ads, your UX strategy will be a lot different than if 
you want to sell products or promote via social media.
LESSON 7
User Goals and Business Goals
When you start a new UX project—before you design anything—
you need to understand your goals. Two of them. And nothing 
is more important to your success as a UX designer.
14   
Before You Start

nobody got time fo’ dat. But a few seconds of ads is a small 
price to pay for those sweet, sweet sneezing pandas.
If YouTube made you watch 20 minutes of ads for every 30 
seconds of videos, it would die a quick, painful death. Ain’t 
Lesson 7: User Goals and Business Goals    15

Without the process of doing UX, you will have bad UX by 
default. There is no such thing as “no UX.” Even shitty prod­
ucts give the user an experience.
The experience of homicidal rage.
You need to get involved in several places, at many times, to 
design and protect a good user experience.
A Company Has a Process, Too
Your process as a UX designer is for you to gather the infor­
mation you need, research the users, design the solution, 
make sure it is implemented properly, and measure the 
results.
But, the company you work with also has a process to get the 
whole project done.
You will hear the word “process” a lot when people talk 
about design. It even comes up a few times in this book.
I often say things like, “UX needs to start early in the 
process,” or “A scientific process doesn’t allow bad ideas to 
survive,” or “I am in the process of photoshopping my boss’ 
head onto Arnold Schwarzenegger’s body right now.”
So, you need to understand UX as a process.
UX Is Not an Event or a Task
If you ever hear someone talk about UX like it is a one-time 
thing, or a moment in time, or a task that someone needs to 
do, feel free to interrupt. That’s wrong.
A UX designer is not “the person who does the UX part”. 
That’s like saying that the water is just the wet part of your 
drink.
LESSON 8
UX Is a Process
Every company is different. Every team is different. And every designer 
is different. So it’s worth asking some questions about how you work.
16   
Before You Start

And if the process just makes your life a living hell—like if 
they want you to work with something evil called “sprints”—
then tell somebody that you’re having difficulty! There might 
be a better way.
If a company’s process forces you to do bad work, the process 
might be wrong for UX.
So speak up!
(Remember: if you fix the process and still do bad work, the 
problem is not the process.)
UX designers are included in that process, along with the 
coders, the project managers, the other designers, the strate­
gists, the business people, the assistant managers, the middle 
managers, the executive managers, the manager’s managers, 
and so on.
At the beginning of a new project or when you get a new 
job, always learn how the company expects you to fit into the 
“machine” of production, and try to respect that overall way 
of working.
Always Question the Process
Your process and your company’s process have something in 
common: they can always improve.
Some improvements are easier said than done, but UX is a 
new part of business in general, so there is a good chance you 
will need to figure out where UX should fit, not just where 
your company expects it to fit.
If you are the first UX person to ever work at a company, you 
need to have this discussion with your colleagues and man­
agers. The earlier UX can be part of the product process, the 
better.
If you’re just one in a long line of fine UX designers, talk 
to them and find out how they think the process could be 
improved and where you would be most valuable.
Lesson 8: UX Is a Process    17

Always have a discussion with each of the “stakeholders” 
(important people), from each department that is affected by 
the design.
Collect problems that could be solved, things that can’t be 
changed, or technical things that must be included.
The sales team has products that it needs to sell. The pro­
grammers might have code that is hard to change. Executives 
have long-term goals that must be respected. The janitors… 
well, they probably won’t be affected by your designs, but 
you could help them out by not leaving your Red Bull cans all 
over the place. Geez.
By talking with stakeholders, you will avoid making mistakes 
that could cost time and money. Plus, your desk won’t attract 
so many flies in the summer.
You’re a UX designer now; other people’s needs are your 
needs.
In many types of design, part of the process is to find inspira­
tion and generate lots of ideas. Mood boards. Photography. 
Hallucinogens. Part of artistic creativity is to feed your mind 
with freedom and possibilities.
But that’s not how problem-solving works.
As a UX designer, your most ingenious creative ideas will 
come from the limitations and restrictions you define by 
studying the problem.
When those limitations come from your own colleagues and 
previous work, we call them “requirements.”
Requirements Protect You from Mistakes
In a real UX job, your design will affect other parts of the 
company: the sales team, the programmers, the executives.
LESSON 9
Gathering Requirements
In UX, the more you understand what you can’t do and 
what you must do, the better your final designs will be.
18   
Before You Start

Don’t Ask Stakeholders for Solutions or Wishes
Be careful not to confuse “requirements” and “expectations.”
When someone says they need something, ask why. If the 
answer is something about the opinions or expectations of 
other people, ask more questions.
Sometimes companies keep working on bad ideas because 
everyone assumes it can’t be better, and that might not 
be true. Sometimes they add a lot of unnecessary features 
because nobody said no.
Lesson 9: Gathering Requirements    19

And always be the first to suggest an experiment when some­
thing is truly subjective. You’ll learn more about that in the 
next lesson, Psychology vs Culture.
If you don’t know, you don’t know.
DO NOT LIE ABOUT UX. EVER.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, admit it, and say 
you will find out.
There is no room for bullshit in UX.
UX is widely misunderstood, and if your bullshit turns out to 
be false, the rest of us will want to leave a horse head in your 
bed. (Not good.)
Lying in UX makes us all look bad. Your opinion isn’t better 
than anyone else’s. Make sure your information is.
In the previous lesson, we learned about gathering require­
ments from important people in your company.
But you also have to bring your own information to the dis­
cussion. Other people might disagree with your design, and if 
you can’t back it up, why should they believe you?
As a UX designer, you need to have reasons to support your 
design before you design it, and you have to be able to 
defend your choices.
You might have to prove that you are right!
Know Your Craft
Good research, good theory, and good data are persuasive. 
Build agreement among stakeholders by doing good research, 
having a solid understanding of the users, their problems, and 
the goals, and by taking the time to explain important ideas 
to stakeholders when they don’t understand.
LESSON 10
Building Consensus
UX designers often find themselves in the middle of everything and 
everyone. Therefore, you should prepare yourself to convince a room 
full of people that your design is right. And have reasons to back it up.

Lesson 10: Building Consensus    21


III
Behavior Basics

Psychology
We are all born with the same brain (more or less). The details 
might vary a bit, but overall, it’s the same machine.
We can all feel happy and sad. We all want to be respected. 
We can all learn to ride a bicycle, and we all regret tequila the 
next day. Pinterest.com, for example, is built on the psycho­
logical principle of collecting things we like. That is common 
to all people.
Psychology, in this sense, is the same for all of us. Most of 
what we will learn in this book is about psychology. The stuff 
we all share. Behavior you can predict and use in your designs.
But differences are useful, too. 
Culture
After we’re born, we take those brains on very different 
journeys. You might be an Eastern, Christian scientist who 
climbed Everest, or a Western, atheist artist who watches 
monster truck videos 24/7.
For example: all people feel the need for justice, but one 
person might think death row is appropriate and another 
person might not. Or, to continue our Pinterest example: 
“collecting” might be universal, but what we collect is highly 
personal. Pinterest does a lot of work to find topics of interest 
for each user, whether that is interfaces, architecture, or fluffy 
chickens.
Culture, in this sense, is different for each of us. People with 
similar experiences and personalities will have similar cultures, 
but on an individual level, culture can be almost anything.
LESSON 11
Psychology versus Culture
Some parts of human behavior are predictable. Some aren’t. 
In this lesson, I want to introduce a two-part model that will 
help you know what you can control and what you can’t.
24   
Behavior Basics

more and more. They cannot be optimized, only customized. 
Their purpose is more detailed, but there are more of them. 
Your fluffy chicken collection could be endless! Very fluffy, 
sort of fluffy, yellow and fluffy, not-so-fluffy…
Keep these ideas in mind as we build our model of behavior 
throughout the book.
The Practical Difference
Psychological elements—such as collecting things you like—
can become focused over time as you move toward “optimal” 
functionality. The “perfect” feature. Their purpose is usually 
more general, but they have the most impact overall.
Cultural elements—like your topics of interest—will expand 
over time as users want to personalize or categorize things 
Lesson 11: Psychology versus Culture    25

Wait… let’s back up for a second and talk about psychology 
in general
Just for a second.
Whether you’re discussing dating psychology, or consumer 
psychology, or bathroom psychology, (which isn’t so popular 
in grad school), you’re still talking about the same brain we all 
got on our first day.
There is no special “user” part in there.
UX Design can affect that brain in lots of predictable ways. 
And that’s what you’re gonna learn: your brain, on design. All 
practical, all the time. No history, unless it matters. Nothing 
philosophical, because that’s not how I roll. And no Sigmund 
Freud, because cocaine isn’t considered a “best practice” 
anymore.
Just stuff you can use.
LESSON 12
What Is User Psychology?
Everything that can happen in a user’s mind is important when they 
use your design. And a few things 
before that. And a few after.
26   
Behavior Basics

The answers might not be what you think! Your intuition 
lies to you all the time. (You’ll learn about that in Lesson 33.) 
And sometimes the same design looks different to different 
people. You’ll learn about that, too. And some things that 
seem super personal are actually universal human behavior. 
Guess what? You’ll learn about that, too.
Why Do We Need User Psychology?
The answer: you can’t be a great UX designer without 
psychology.
UX Design is the practice of creating nonrandom effects in 
people to solve a problem. In other words, you make them 
feel, think, and do stuff—on purpose. Therefore, the more 
you understand your users’ feelings, thoughts, and actions, 
the better designer you are.
Understanding psychology allows you to answer things like 
why people share. Or why don’t they choose the cheapest 
option every time? Or why does the design that got 200 Likes 
on Dribbble actually suck the big one?
(Yes, that’s possible. Actually, it’s pretty common.)
Lesson 12: What Is User Psychology?    27

2.	 What the user wants
Much more important, but not as easy for the user to 
describe. A user’s motivations are the engine of their 
behavior. Everything they do, click, choose, buy, and even 
what they see and hear depends on what they want. 
“When you’re a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” 
And if you change the way they see the situation, some­
times they will want something different.
3.	 What the user thinks
It is helpful to imagine “thinking” as something the user 
carries, like bricks. Psychologists might call it cognitive 
load. Every time you make a user figure something out, 
or read more than a sentence of instructions, or learn a 
new feature, or hunt for the right link, or do two things 
at once, you’re giving them another brick to carry. Most 
people can only carry a few bricks at a time. If you give 
them too many, they will drop everything.
There are six big parts of an experience discussed throughout 
this book:
1.	 What the user feels
In UX forums, this is what inexperienced designers talk 
about most. Making the user “happy.” Asking them what 
they “like.” Making users say “wow!” Users have feel­
ings, and they are useful, but they are only a small frac­
tion of an experience. The good things about feelings are 
that we can see them on a user’s face, users can tell us 
about them, we can measure them, and we can relate to 
them, so feelings are easy to study.
LESSON 13
What Is An Experience?
There are probably many, endless conversations we could have 
about a philosophical “experience,” but I am not qualified to teach 
you philosophy, so I won’t. In UX, we need practical answers.
28   
Behavior Basics

6.	 What the user doesn’t realize
Ahhhh, yes. This separates good UX designers from other 
random people making wireframes. Most of our daily 
experience doesn’t catch our attention. You have been 
breathing this whole time, but now you’re aware of it. 
There’s a low, constant noise all around you, but you 
weren’t hearing it until right now. And that itch you just 
noticed… oh god… it’s so itchy…
UX designers must also design things that users will never 
notice, never give you feedback on, and maybe never 
remember, like information architecture (which has a 
whole section in this book) and heuristics (models of how 
your users act). But that’s a good thing! Unfortunately, 
though, no client will ever sit in a meeting and compli­
ment you for it, (because they don’t see it either). Those 
design elements will change the user’s behavior, and only 
the data can show you how.
4.	 What the user believes
Beliefs are tricky. The reasons people believe things are 
fairly predictable though. That’s why you learned about 
psychology versus culture before this lesson. More 
important, your intuition has predictable flaws that most 
people don’t know about. If you know about them—
and you will—it allows you to predict what people will 
believe, before they believe it.
5.	 What the user remembers
Ironically, almost all designers forget about this one. 
Humans do not remember things like a video. Memories 
make mistakes. We only remember certain parts, we 
change those memories over time, and sometimes we 
remember things that never even happened! Your design 
can determine which parts someone remembers, and 
which are forgotten.
Lesson 13: What Is An Experience?    29

Conscious Experience
You might hear UXers discussing something 
called “delight.” Basically it is the art of design­
ing something that makes a user say “wow!”
One thing must be true to create delight: the 
user must be aware of it, consciously. Daniel 
Kahneman, a Noble Prize–winning psycholo­
gist, says our conscious mind is like “a support­
ing character who believes herself to be the 
lead actor and often has little idea of what’s 
going on.”
LESSON 14
Conscious vs Subconscious Experience
In real life, your mind only puts attention on a small amount of 
the world around you. Otherwise you would be overwhelmed. 
This lesson is a basic idea with huge consequences.
30   
Behavior Basics

If you want users to trust or understand, your design must 
feel trustworthy or obvious. If it doesn’t, you can add as much 
delight as you want and it ain’t gonna fix nothin’. Usability, 
for example, is the science of making your designs mentally 
invisible. You can see them, of course, but the more aware 
the user is of your form design, the worse the experience. 
It should feel automatic. The more clever you get with your 
form design, or your copywriting, the less people will finish 
the form.
Sounds like Kanye West with the Kardashians, no?
Your conscious experience may feel like the whole experience, 
but it is actually just a small part. However, it’s still significant. 
It is what makes people share, like, comment, download, and 
register. YouTube videos often explicitly tell you to subscribe 
at the end, because you may not consciously think of doing it 
otherwise.
Subconscious Experience
Subconscious experience seems like it “just is.” It’s how we 
decide what we trust, what we believe, and what is easy.
But there is never a moment when you “decided” to trust 
a website or an app. It just happened. And a user will only 
notice that your form design is easy if they expected it to be 
harder. Otherwise they might not even mention it. Things are 
supposed to be easy.
That is subconscious design.
Lesson 14: Conscious vs Subconscious Experience    31

For now, just put them all in the same “happy” category.
Losses give you negative feelings. You feel grumpy when you 
haven’t slept, or devastated after a breakup, or embarrassed 
when your masseuse turns out to be your cousin.
There is a lot of debate among psychologists about emotions. 
I’m gonna skip all that. This lesson is already a little longer 
than most, because emotions are super important in UX 
design. Instead—I give you the simplest practical model of 
emotions known to mankind:
•	 There are two categories of emotions: gain and loss.
•	 Emotions are reactions, not goals.
•	 Time makes emotions more complicated.
Gain and Loss
Emotions come in two flavors: good and bad; positive and 
negative; happy and unhappy. Pretty easy so far, right? I 
call them gain and loss.
Gains give you positive feelings. You might feel refreshed 
after a good night’s sleep, or ecstatic after winning the 
lottery, or euphoric when your masseuse is a little more 
thorough than usual.
LESSON 15
Emotions
We have arrived at one of the core parts of psychology. 
The part that makes your pupils big or small, tears 
flow down your face, smiles happen, and more.
32   
Behavior Basics

about here-and-now. You think in time. You remember the 
past and expect the future.
When you see a box wrapped in colorful paper, you think: 
gift! When someone says “we need to talk” you think: crap.
The “gift” might be full of snakes, but you will be happy until 
you know that. If you expect something bad to happen—like 
if the box is labeled “muthafuckin’ snakes!”—you feel fear 
(or “worry” or “concern”: if it’s negative, it’s negative). You 
will avoid it or try to escape. Unless you’re on a muthafuckin’ 
plane.
A more interesting emotion, in my opinion, is anger. If you 
want/expect something, but you can’t get it, you will become 
aggressive toward whatever is stopping you. This is how 
emotions interact with time. When someone says “we need 
to talk” your first reaction is probably fear. You want to keep 
your job or your relationship, or whatever you think they are 
going to destroy. But when they actually do try to destroy 
it, you might get aggressive. Now they are stopping you 
from having it. When they succeed, you’re sad, (loss). If they 
change their mind, you’re happy, (gain).
AS A UX DESIGNER
Think about more than happiness. Manage the user’s feel-
ings throughout their experience by giving them the informa-
tion and signals they need to feel comfortable, like an icon 
showing that your site is secure or text that says the user can 
confirm their order on the next page, before they pay.
For now, just put them all in the same “unhappy” category.
Emotions Are Reactions, Not Goals
If I locked you in a dark box and gave you chemicals that 
would make you feel happy, forever, and then shot that box 
out into space, alone, with no communication, and you can’t 
move or control anything, would you consider that a good 
thing?
Hmmm… maybe not. If you only make users “happy” it’s like 
putting them in that box. Five minutes later, not so great.
There are two types of feelings: emotions and motivations. 
Motivations are what we want (goals), and emotions are how 
we feel when we gain or lose what we want (feedback). We’ll 
learn about motivations next.
AS A UX DESIGNER
You can give the user a score, or an email, or a badge, 
or levels, or Likes, or followers, or any other method of 
feedback so they feel useful emotions about their gains and 
losses. Or you can just show them which flavor of Ben & 
Jerry’s Ice Cream they are, like Buzzfeed.com, and call it a 
day.
Time Makes Emotions 
More Complicated
Your emotions, or your “mood,” change all the time. Within 
reason, that’s normal. If it’s extreme, you should probably see 
somebody about getting on reality television. But it’s not all 
Lesson 15: Emotions    33

like Facebook or Twitter. When you know how to use them, 
human motivations are UX magic in a bottle.
The 14 Universal Motivations
So, what are these 14 motivations?
Avoid death
Obviously, dying is bad. Evolution figured that out, too. You 
are motivated to live as long as possible (gain) and avoid 
anything life-threatening (loss), like heights, or fire, or snakes. 
Sometimes people commit suicide, but only when one of the 
other motivations is stronger than the will to live.
Avoid pain
Similar to death, but not necessarily life-threatening. This is 
ouchy pain like breaking your leg, not heartache pain like 
when ‘N Sync broke up and left me with nothing. Nothing!
The last lesson explained that emotions are reactions based 
on whether someone gains or loses their goals.
But what goals? Motivations. That’s what.
Motivations are built-in psychological needs. Shit we want. 
Some are physical—you need them to survive—and some 
exist only in your mind. All are important. Motivations can fall 
anywhere between conscious experience and subconscious 
experience.
You can gain or lose each motivation, and you are motivated 
to do both. That will become very useful in UX, when you 
learn about conditioning.
Motivations are relative. That means it’s not about how much 
you get, it’s about how much more you get compared to 
what you have or what other people have.
In my book, The Composite Persuasion, I outline 14 things 
that all people, everywhere, want. At least six of those 
motivations can be useful to you in (digital) UX and three of 
those are the foundation of gamification and social networks, 
LESSON 16
What Are Motivations?
This lesson is about the most overlooked and the most 
powerful psychological element in UX: what users want.
34   
Behavior Basics

Sex
Sometimes called “seduction”—not to be confused with 
“romance,” which is Love—this one is tricky, because it is 
counterintuitive. I will cover it individually in the next lesson.
Love
Also in the next lesson, Love comes in three different flavors, 
which give you a bad case of the feels for your family, your 
kids, and the person who lets you touch their fuzzy bits.
Protection of Children
You won’t spend much time on this one, but it’s good to 
know that it exists. Many things that involve adults have a 
different appropriateness or become more serious when they 
involve children. I am sure you can think of crimes that work 
like that. But sometimes, like with advertising, we just need 
extra rules and limitations to ensure safety. Why? Because in 
terms of evolution, people who can’t reproduce yet are more 
valuable than those who have already, so we gotta protect 
‘em.
Air/water/food
Your body needs fuel to operate, and if it is running low, your 
motivations will make you fix that. The more urgent the need, 
the more desperate you get.
Homeostasis
This is your body’s internal “balance.” Remember the last time 
you drank too much, came home, went to sleep, and woke 
up an hour later to reverse-drink? That was your motivation 
for homeostasis. The same motivation also helped you pee 
during the evening and “detox” from the other end the next 
day. Try saying no to this motivation. I dare you.
Sleep
Recent studies have shown that sleeping might be your 
brain’s cleaning and maintenance time. If you go long enough 
without sleep or if you watch C-Span for a couple minutes, 
your body and mind will take over and make sure you get 
some rest.
Lesson 16: What Are Motivations?    35

Understanding (Curiosity)
The motivation to understand things is particularly interesting, 
and not as easy to use in UX as many people think. It will be 
your final lesson on motivations, and it will change how you 
think about usability, onboarding, advertising, and how users 
handle change.
This is a very brief introduction to motivations, but hopefully it 
gives you a sense of how UX can shape behavior. When users 
become loyal or have a deep appreciation for your product, 
it’s because of gains in these motivations.
Affiliation
This is the motivation to belong to a group, and you will learn 
about it two lessons from now.
Status
This is the motivation to drive your own bus (metaphorically) 
and be better than others, and you will learn about it three 
lessons from now.
Justice
This is the motivation to balance the scales so everybody gets 
what they deserve; you’ll learn about it four lessons from 
now.
36   
Behavior Basics

Sex is the motivation to touch each other’s warm and fuzzy 
parts, and love is the motivation that feels all warm and fuzzy. 
Here, we will learn about both, and they are surprisingly 
different.
But first, a bit of business…
LESSON 17
Motivation: Sex and Love
Ooooh, baby. Turn the lights down low. Light some candles 
and bring out those chocolate-covered strawberries, 
because it’s time for a deeper look at two motivations 
that bring people closer together, online and offline.
Disclaimer
Sex can be a sensitive topic. First of all, it can be kind of 
shallow, so please don’t be insulted. Second, there are 
certain political elements when talking about genders 
and behavior. I will use the terms “female” and “male” as 
categories, but let’s be clear that the sexual behavior of a 
“male” doesn’t always come with the body of a man, and 
vice versa. However, if I get too deep into the details, this 
lesson will get a bit hairy. Pun intended.
I ask, please, for the benefit of the doubt, and believe that 
everyone should be respected, regardless of orientation.
Lesson 17: Motivation: Sex and Love    37

Some sexual signals are easy to see, like nice clothes or a fit 
body or a sign that says “Trust me, I’m Hot!” but others are 
much more subtle, like confidence and intelligence. And some 
signals are a matter of, ahem, personal taste. Like what you 
do for fun, or what music you like.
AS A UX DESIGNER
Provide the information users need to judge “quality” 
(popularity, interests, physical appearance, etc.) and to find 
whatever matches their taste. That can be as simple as a 
number of followers and a picture, or you might need videos 
and descriptions and niche categories.
This might sound absurd or surprising, but porn sites are actu­
ally some of the most active businesses when it comes to A/B 
testing and optimizing their designs, advertising, and search 
experience. It’s an incredibly competitive industry, and they 
even have to consider one-handed navigation. Seriously!
We are also motivated to protect our chances of getting sex. A 
simple bit of text can create a lot of motivation, like: “Profiles 
with more photos are usually more popular.” Once a user 
knows that, do you really think they will stick with one photo? 
More photos = better UX for everyone.
Sex Is About Reproduction
Females provide half of the process and males provide the 
other half, but those halves are distinctly different in a practi­
cal sense. Those differences cause a lot of our problems.
Think of sexual “rules of engagement” like an 
auction
If you have something valuable or rare, you want to give it 
to the person who can offer you the most, right? That’s why 
Antiques Roadshow is so popular. The more valuable an item 
is, the more protective you should be, and the more people 
expect to offer for it. If you have a painting by Picasso, only 
the best bidders should show up. And, if you have a lot to 
offer, you only spend your time bidding on stuff like a Picasso.
On the other hand, if you don’t have a lot to offer, then you 
look for the auctions that are a little less competitive. And, if 
you don’t have something that is rare or valuable, then you 
might not have the same expectations. Sexual attraction is 
sort of like that.
It might sound simple enough when I use that analogy, but 
we’re talking about people, so it is anything but simple. 
Perception is also a big part of it. It’s not about how “valu­
able” or “rare” a person really is—because we are all unique 
snowflakes—it’s about how valuable someone seems.
38   
Behavior Basics

But where romantic love involves sex, loving your kids is more 
about protection and helping them grow, and loving family 
and friends is almost territorial. The features you design 
should help people behave like that.
AS A UX DESIGNER
Helping users find love is like helping them shop for a 
dishwasher. They only need one, and the basics are mostly 
standard, but everyone has their own idea of what is 
“perfect.” Provide features to filter, compare, ask questions, 
save, follow-up, etc.
Love
If sex is shallow and short term, love is the opposite. It is made 
of hopes and dreams and caring and mutual interest and 
rainbows and sunshine. 
Awwwwwww…
You can love a partner, or your kids, or your family, and those 
are all a little different. Love, basically, is the motivation to 
reciprocate motivations with someone else (i.e., you make 
them happy, and they make you happy).
With romantic love, the trick is finding someone who will love 
you back. We tend to pick spouses who share our values, (you 
agree about what is good/bad), so you need to design a way 
for users to find themselves in the crowd.
Lesson 17: Motivation: Sex and Love    39

is a good chance you will hate anyone who disagrees with 
that belief.
AS A UX DESIGNER
Allow users to belong to a group or be identified by things 
they have in common—like joining guilds or “Liking” pages 
or choosing color schemes.
Affiliation, and the next two motivations, are purely relative. 
They only matter when you compare yourself to other people. 
My favorites. 
Affiliation
Belong to a group. Any group. The fans of a team. People 
with “UX” in their job title. People from your home country. 
People who fish on the weekends. People who hate people 
who fish on weekends.
Whatever.
Being part of a group (or believing we are part of 
it) makes us feel proud. We wear their colors, sing 
their songs, buy their swag, display their symbols, 
etc. It could be a sports team, a band, a school, a 
country, or just your family. If your group has an 
opponent, there is a good chance you will hate that 
opponent. If your group has a common belief, there 
LESSON 18
Motivation: Affiliation
Social media and games have become a huge part of the 
Internet, and the main motivations behind all of them are the 
same. One of those motivations is the desire to belong.
40   
Behavior Basics

This is just straight-up competition, but it doesn’t always come 
in the form of a game or a sport. Anything that can be done 
by all users, whether it is looking good in a profile picture or 
having the most followers, can (and will) become a compe­
tition. You just have to choose a way to use that competitive 
motivation.
Never move down. Remember: we are motivated to protect 
what we have gained. People will fight to keep their current 
status, even if it is made of something imaginary like points.
Sometimes adding a little bit of competitive risk is a good 
thing. If your farm will die while you’re away, like in Farmville, 
or if your “activity level” will go down, like on Tumblr, then 
you will be more active to make sure you don’t lose your 
status.
Status
Decide for yourself. Call it freedom, or autonomy, or respon­
sibility, or authority, or control, or rebellion. One way or 
another, you wanna be the boss, at least of yourself.
People always want to be in charge of themselves and their 
own decisions, even when someone else might do a better 
job, like when buying stocks or when that freedom might 
create more risk (like getting more responsibility at work).
You should let users have control, but help them make better 
decisions if you can and eliminate any chance of a major 
screw-up. Confirm dangerous choices or make those choices 
hard to do accidentally—“are you sure you want to launch the 
nukes, Mr. President?”
Be the best. Achievements, dominance, winning, popularity, 
money, talent, sex appeal, or some other version of that idea, 
which makes you more of something than most other people.
LESSON 19
Motivation: Status
The other motivation that makes social networks 
and games work is the desire to control, compare, 
and compete with others to be the best.
Lesson 19: Motivation: Status    41

While I was writing this book, Instagram deleted millions of 
fake followers from the network—which was a good thing to 
do, for Instagram—and users got upset because their follower 
counts went down. They would rather have a bigger number 
of followers (higher status) that included robots than a lower 
number that was made of real people (lower status).
AS A UX DESIGNER
Let users personalize some features, like a profile picture 
or privacy settings, and never take big choices out of their 
control. Create a way to measure users’ actions so they 
can compare themselves to others—like points on a high 
score list, followers on Instagram, or being The Mayor in 
Foursquare.
42   
Behavior Basics

On the other hand, if one kid beats up another kid, that 
might not seem fair to us as observers. But, if we then learn 
that he was fighting back against a bully, the feeling changes. 
If we find out the bully was falsely accused, it changes again. 
Morality is often a matter of perspective, which is probably 
why philosophers like to argue about it so much.
AS A UX DESIGNER
Have rules of conduct, or symbols of respect and honor, 
or give users the power to choose champions—like Twitter 
manners, Reddit Gold or Reddiquette, Kickstarter cam-
paigns, or American Idol.
Justice
The feeling that people should get what they deserve.
Everyone believes they deserve to be liked, even though most 
of us can be assholes from time to time. We all agree that 
Hitler was an “evil” leader rather than just a leader. And we 
all love to see underdogs win.
Justice is our emotional need for balance in the force.
The most interesting thing about Justice is that it only applies 
to the other motivations. If Person A has caused Person B to 
suffer a loss in one of the 13 motivations, we want Person 
A to suffer the same loss (or something equal). If Person A 
makes us happy by giving us gains in one of the other motiva­
tions, we feel like we owe them some recognition somehow.
LESSON 20
Motivation: Justice
Whether you think a kid deserves his black eye because he 
started the fight, or that the second kid is guilty for punching 
him, or that both kids were equally guilty, that’s Justice.
Lesson 20: Motivation: Justice    43

they have achieved, or anything they morally believe or 
support.
(Blank profiles don’t count, cheater.)
If you find one, let me know: 
@HipperElement.
HOMEWORK!!!!!1!!!
Yes, homework!
Don’t worry: your homework will be to stalk people on 
Twitter.
Go to Twitter. Try to find a profile description of a real person 
that does not name any group they are part of, any status 
44   
Behavior Basics

If the iPhone looked like every other phone at the time, you 
wouldn’t have felt curious, because you wouldn’t “get it.”
How to Screw It Up
The best way to suck at making people curious is to offer 
them something that isn’t one of the other 13 motivations. 
Ironically, the most common example of this is a chance to 
win an iPhone or iPad.
First: everyone already understands an iPhone or an iPad. No 
curiosity.
Second: it’s only a chance to win something that a lot of 
people already have (remember that Status is relative to other 
people.) So, the gain in Status is actually pretty small, unless 
you have no way to get an iPhone like if you’re a kid, or you 
can’t afford an iPhone, etc.
Instead, think of a way to make your product seem like a 
motivational gain, or not having your product seem like a loss. 
Stop trying to motivate people with a chance to get free shit.
Understanding is the motivation to get information about a 
situation that involves the other 13 motivations. Sometimes 
we call it curiosity. We are also motivated to protect what we 
already understand. The funny thing about Understanding is 
that—even though it’s pretty simple—designers and market­
ers screw it up all the time.
There are three rules for creating curiosity:
1.	 The user must understand enough to know there will be 
a gain or loss in one of the other 13 motivations.
2.	 The bigger the gain or loss seems to be, the more inter­
esting it becomes.
3.	 Hold something back.
The illustration for this lesson is similar to the original iPhone’s 
website. You see just enough to know that it’s better than 
the not-so-smart phone in your pocket, but the specifics are 
hidden.
Voilá! You’re curious.
LESSON 21
Motivation: Understanding (Curiosity)
This is the motivation behind teaser trailers for new 
movies and your anger when Facebook suddenly 
changes their features without warning.
Lesson 21: Motivation: Understanding (Curiosity)    45

AS A UX DESIGNER
You also have to consider the case when users want to 
understand, of course.
Users will choose something they understand over something 
they don’t, if you give them a choice. It doesn’t matter which 
one is actually better.
When you change or remove features, avoid using curiosity as 
a marketing strategy. Tell users what is coming, tell them why, 
show how it will work, and give them time to adjust, (if you 
can). Otherwise, users will be angry or afraid, because you’re 
taking away something they already understand. That’s a loss.

IV
User Research

Different People Will Say That 
User Research Happens at 
Different Stages in the Process
Some say you should do it first. Some say you make some 
drawings and do it then. Some say you do it after building a 
working product.
They are all right. There is never a bad time to do user 
research. Do it early, do it often. The important question isn’t 
when. It’s what. As in “what are you trying to learn about 
your users?”
There are two main types of information that you can get 
from research that involves people: subjective and objective.
Subjective Research
The word “subjective” means that it is an opinion, or a 
memory, or your impression of something. The feeling it gives 
you. The expectations it creates. Not a fact.
“What is your favorite color?”
“Do you trust this company?”
“Does my ass look fat in these pants?”
(i.e., There is no right answer.) To get subjective information 
you have to ask people questions.
LESSON 22
What Is User Research?
Ah, users. The sun in the UX solar system and the thorn in your 
side. One of the Sacred Laws of UX is “never blame the user,” 
even though—let’s be honest—sometimes it is really fucking 
tempting. However if you feel that way, you probably don’t 
understand your users well enough. Research is how we fix that.
48   
User Research

Sample Size
As a general rule, more people makes for more reliable 
information, even if it is subjective. One opinion could be 
completely wrong. If a million people agree, it is a good repre­
sentation of the crowd’s beliefs (but could still be false, objec­
tively). So collect as much info as possible for your research.
Lots of subjective opinions can become… 
almost objective?! WTF
If you ask a crowd of people to guess the answer to some­
thing objective—like jelly beans in a jar—the average guess 
will often be pretty close to the real, objective, answer. But 
“wisdom of the crowd” about something subjective can also 
cause riots and get George W. Bush elected, so… yeah. Be 
careful. Subjective things can never be true; only more or less 
popular.
Objective Research
The word “objective” means a fact. Something true. 
Something you can prove. Your opinion doesn’t change it, no 
matter how hard you wish.
“How long did you spend using our app?”
“Where did you find the link to our site?”
“What size are those pants?”
If people had perfect memories and never lied (especially to 
themselves), you could ask them about this stuff. If you find 
someone like that, let me know.
Objective data comes in the form of measurements and statis­
tics. But, just because you can count something doesn’t make 
it objective or “data.”
The plural of “anecdote” is not “evidence.”
—A wise person. 
For example, if 102 people vote that something is good and 
50 people vote that it’s bad, the only objective information 
you have is the number of people that voted. Whether it is 
“good” or “bad” is still a subjective opinion.
With me so far?
(If not, I will blame myself for explaining badly, not you for 
reading badly.)
Lesson 22: What Is User Research?    49

50   
User Research

Therefore, your job is to listen to what the users say, not to be 
their design monkey. Listen to what users think, watch how 
they try to get things done, and understand how and why 
they get lost in your designs. Then go find solutions to those 
problems.
Don’t ask users how they want their problems 
solved
If users think the button should be blue, or wish they could 
see all the products arranged by country of origin, or want 
you to smash little cymbals together and wear a cute little 
red hat, you can make note of it. But, if it doesn’t help you 
achieve your UX goals, it probably isn’t valuable right now. 
Ideas and solutions are different things.
You Are Not Testing the Users; 
They Are Testing You 
As the designer, you will be in a position of authority when 
you do user testing, but don’t let it go to your head. The users 
are testing your design. If they don’t do what you want them 
to do or if they don’t understand, that’s your fault, not theirs.
And if you lead them to the right answers by asking leading 
questions or giving them tips that normal users won’t get, 
the test is ruined. You ain’t proved nothin’. So when users are 
doing tests or giving answers, shut up and observe.
Users Are Not a Crystal Ball
UX is a set of skills, not a talent. Which means the average 
user can’t help you do it, and it is a terrible choice if you’re 
competing on X-Factor.
LESSON 23
What Isn’t User Research?
User research is very important and you should do it. 
But make sure you are asking users about what they 
think and feel, not what you should do next.
Lesson 23: What Isn’t User Research?    51

But just because people at your company really love that 
button that makes a fart sound when you tap it—who 
doesn’t?!—doesn’t mean your users need it. And that 
includes you. You are a person at your company whose 
opinion doesn’t matter. User research is not a way to confirm 
your beliefs; it’s a way to discover them.
Consensus Is Not a UX Strategy
Many designers think that a good way to find the best solu­
tion is to ask their colleagues. It’s not. You should include 
colleagues in the design process to identify their requirements 
for the project and keep channels of communication open in 
general. That’s what “working together” means.
52   
User Research

Let’s say the menu problem affects one out of every three 
people. That means you need at least three users to find the 
problem with the menu (it’s more like four or five in real life). 
And let’s say the pricing problem affects 1 out of every 20 
people. That means you need at least 20 users to find the 
problem with the menu (again, it’s more like 30 or 40 in real 
life).
So if you get five test users—a common practice for user 
testing—you’ll probably find the menu problem and miss the 
pricing problem. D’oh!
Since real services often only convert a few people out of 20 
anyway, that pricing issue might be a significant amount of 
your sales! That is why face-to-face testing is useful, but not 
reliable in isolation.
This is a very common question, and a good one. How many 
users should you include in your user research to make sure 
that you get all the information you need? Well, it depends, 
actually.
The Less Obvious the Problem, the 
More People You Need to Find It
Let’s say there are two problems with your design:
1.	 Most people don’t notice the button that opens the 
menu.
2.	 Your pricing page makes it seem like your product is not 
free, but it is.
Both are real issues I have seen in testing.
LESSON 24
How Many Users Do You Need?
Should you go for the wisdom of the crowd, or should you trust 
your most loyal users? Should you ask the people who know the 
most about your designs, or the beginners who have fresh eyes?
Lesson 24: How Many Users Do You Need?    53

Get Users Who Fit the Profile 
and A Couple Who Don’t
In Lesson 29, Creating User Profiles, you will learn how to 
define the types of users who are important to you. By testing 
users who fit your profile in real life, you’ll see how they think 
differently than you, and they will find problems that affect 
your real users.
BUT…
If you only test a single type of user, you’ll miss any problems 
that are caused by other types of thinking. Throw in a few 
random weirdos—not your colleagues—just to see what they 
do. You might make some interesting discoveries.
54   
User Research

Over the next few lessons you will look into some different 
types of research methods that involve questions of one type 
or another:
Observation
Give people tasks or instructions and watch them use 
your design, without help. Afterward, you can ask them 
questions. 
Interviews
Get somebody and ask them a set of questions, 
one-by-one.
Focus Groups
Get a bunch of people in a room together and ask them 
to discuss your questions. 
NOTE
Confident people often persuade others in the group, and a 
few random people are an unreliable example of anything, 
which is why I would rather set myself on fire than do a 
focus group in real life.
Three Basic Types of Questions
The specific questions you ask will, of course, vary, but there 
are three basic types:
1.	 Open Questions—”How would you describe me?”
This allows for a wide range of answers and works well 
when you want all the feedback you can get.
2.	 Leading Questions—”What are my best features?”
This narrows the answers to a certain type. My example 
assumes that I have some good qualities, which might 
not be true. Be careful: this type of question also excludes 
answers you might want to know!
3.	 Closed/Direct Questions—”Which is better, my smile or 
my frown?”
This type of question offers a choice: yes or no; this or 
that. But remember: if the options are stupid, the results 
will be stupid. Protip: don’t be stupid.
LESSON 25
How to Ask Questions
Often in UX—especially at the start of something new—you 
will need to ask real people some real questions, for realz.
Lesson 25: How to Ask Questions    55

Important
•	 Ask the same questions, the same way, to everyone.
•	 Avoid interpreting questions or suggesting answers.
•	 People might lie to avoid embarrassment or if it seems like 
you prefer a particular answer.
•	 Take notes or record the interview. Do not rely on your 
memory, ever.
•	 Don’t eat yellow snow.
Surveys
A form, which people answer on paper or online. These 
can genuinely feel anonymous, which is useful.
Card-Sorting
Each person gets a set of ideas or categories (on cards 
or post-its or online), which they sort into groups that 
make sense to them, personally. ProTip: don’t use your 
colleagues for this.
Google
It’s amazing how many useful opinions you can find 
online, for free, right now. Google is this website where 
you type in what you want and—oh, you’ve heard of it? 
Well, fine then. 
56   
User Research

Watch How They Choose, Not 
Just What They Choose
One of the most common mistakes for new UX designers is to 
ignore the process and only record the results.
The more the user doesn’t do what you expect, the more 
useful the testing is. If you just end up with a page full of 
notes that say “complete” and “incomplete,” you still know 
nothing. Instead, record how they navigate to the solution, 
why they think it is where it is, what clues they used to find it 
(or not), and whether they think they have completed the task 
or not.
Remember: Your Memory Sucks
Use video, take notes, have two people observing, or all of 
the above, because as my mom would say, “You can’t trust 
your memory any farther than you can throw it.” But that’s a 
confusing metaphor in this case, so just make sure you record 
your research as it’s happening. Don’t rely on memory.
Read Between the Lines
Users often have body language or facial expressions or say, 
“hmmm…,” or move their mouse in a way that reveals their 
thoughts and feelings during the test. If you have video of the 
screen and their face, you can take advantage of those real-
time clues later.
LESSON 26
How to Observe a User
Watching someone is one thing. Observing a user for 
research purposes is a whole other thing. If you don’t 
know the difference, you’re probably doing it wrong.
Lesson 26: How to Observe a User    57

True Story: People Will Lie 
to Get Your Approval
Don’t forget that you are in the room. People will lie to cover 
embarrassment, or act helpless to get your help, or tell you 
the design is great when it isn’t—just because you’re sitting 
there.
Always approach user testing as if you expect users to lie 
about something, even if they don’t realize it, because you 
can’t trust a user any farther than you can throw them. There 
we go: best metaphor ever. Thanks, Mom!
Do Not Help
It will be very tempting to help a user who is confused or 
uncomfortable because they don’t understand. Resist that 
temptation! The moment you help a user, or give them a hint, 
or point to something useful, the test is ruined because you 
are now testing the design instead of them. Letting users fail 
is sometimes the most useful result you can get.
58   
User Research

Interviews are bad because…
•	 You are there, so testers might adjust their behavior and 
opinions to get approval from you.
•	 It is harder to get real people to come to a place that 
is good for you, so you will usually end up testing with 
fewer users.
•	 The social nature of a face-to-face interview is not good 
for embarrassing or private products and services, like 
that site you buy all your latex body suits from.
•	 Introverted users probably can’t imagine anything worse 
than a face-to-face interview.
You should do interviews when…
You need to test subjective stuff with many steps or decisions 
involved, like navigating around a site to select the perfect 
latex body suit. Or if you need to ask follow up questions 
depending on the user’s behavior, like “which ball-gag goes 
with that body suit, in your opinion?”
What Is an Interview?
An interview is a set of questions, created by you before the 
interview, asked to a user, in person. 
Interviews are good because…
•	 You can ask follow-up questions; find out if your ques­
tions are confusing; give people tasks to complete; and 
get long, open answers to questions that might be harder 
to answer in writing.
•	 You can also watch users and get nonverbal clues, and 
you can learn about things where time limits are built 
into the experience, like games, quizzes, or real-time 
messaging.
•	 You can hand-pick the testers.
LESSON 27
Interviews
If you want to ask some questions or see people try something 
you have designed, you need to meet them face-to-face.
Lesson 27: Interviews    59

Surveys are bad because…
•	 You can’t ask follow-up questions, so it takes more care­
ful preparation to create a survey.
•	 It’s easy to accidentally influence the results by how you 
ask the question or the order you choose for the options.
•	 People are lazy, so the longer you make the survey, the 
fewer people will complete it.
•	 You can’t retake a survey to choose all the answers that 
make you Harry or Hermoine, even if you know—in your 
heart—that you’re not like Malfoy.
You should use surveys when…
You want to compare the answers of users to each other, or 
control the way questions are asked, or ask a lot of people, or 
control the mix of ages, genders, locations, etc.
What Is a Survey?
A survey is a set of questions that a user answers by filling out 
a form on paper or online, privately, and sometimes anony­
mously. It’s like a Buzzfeed quiz, but instead of finding out 
which Harry Potter character you are, you just give feedback.
Surveys are good because…
•	 They allow users to participate privately and therefore be 
more honest.
•	 Every user gets precisely the same questions, and you (the 
designer) can’t screw it up by asking the questions wrong.
•	 It is easy and cheap to get thousands of people to answer 
a survey. If you do that in person then you also need por­
table toilets, food trucks, bands to perform… it’s a hassle.
•	 Nobody has to feel disappointed, because a UX survey 
never says you are most like Malfoy.
LESSON 28
Surveys
Face-to-face interviews aren’t always an option, so sometimes 
you need to send questions out to people. But be careful, 
there are things a survey can do, and things it can’t.

Lesson 28: Surveys    61

What Is Card Sorting?
Not a way to win Blackjack more often. Unfortunately.
Basically, you give each user a set of topics or 
ideas written on “cards”—maybe types of 
content or features you’re considering—
and ask them to organize the cards into 
categories that make sense to the user.
Card sorting can literally be a bunch of 
recipe cards, or you can use an online 
tool to simulate it. By doing this with 
many users and then documenting the 
relationships they create between cards, 
you will learn which ideas or features are 
most related in the minds of the users, 
and it will help you design menus and 
information architecture. It sounds a bit 
complex, but I have done this with a 
whole class of students in 15 minutes, 
during the class, using online tools. It

Card Sorting
Some types of questions are hard to answer, so it might be better to 
get a user to show you instead.
62   
User Research

Card sorting is bad because…
•	 It is definitely a bit tedious to set it up, and the answers 
are more of a guide than a solution.
•	 Card sorting is only as good as the material you put into 
the experiment.
•	 Users will organize the cards you provide for them, 
whether that makes sense or not.
•	 If your site/app is a tool, like email, or something less tra­
ditional, like Tinder, card sorting might give you unhelpful 
results. Card sorting is designed to reveal assumptions 
and expectations, not innovation.
Use card sorting when…
You know what types of content or features you want to 
include, but the actual strategy for organizing that content 
isn’t so obvious.
took about an hour to create cards for an agency’s future site 
content—before the students arrived—and the students were 
able to sort them quickly while I ignored them completely, like 
the amazing teacher that I am. The software did all the work 
of measuring the patterns in their choices and probably saved 
me hours of work. Voilá!
Card sorting is good because…
•	 Designing big, complex sites like Wal-Mart or eBay can 
seem overwhelming at the beginning. Card sorting helps 
you get started.
•	 You can discover structure within a pile of ideas that 
seem random or unrelated, or learn about the priorities of 
your audience without asking them directly.
•	 I did card sorting for a digital agency’s website, because I 
understood the content too well and couldn’t think about 
it from the users’ perspective. It also revealed differences 
in the way clients and prospective employees thought 
about the agency.

research and data. If you can’t back it up with research or 
data, you’re just making shit up and you should stop.
Bad profile
Persona A is a male, between the ages of 35 and 45 with an 
above average income and education. They have at least one 
child and own at least one new vehicle. They are outgoing 
and career-oriented, and tend to be right-brain thinkers.
Why it’s bad
That might be great if you’re selling ads, but as far as UX 
goes, that profile is basically useless. Why? Because it doesn’t 
allow you to say “no” to any feature ideas. What sort of 
features does a male between 35 and 45 need? It could be 
anything!
Useful profile
Persona A is an experienced manager, mostly interested in 
one or two areas of expertise. They visit often, but they are 
pressed for time, so they focus on “collecting” content to 
What a Profile Is Not
First of all, let’s nail down what personas or profiles are not:
•	 Personality types
•	 Demographics
•	 Characters in your “brand story”
•	 Stereotypes based on your experience
•	 Shallow or one-dimensional
•	 Concepts
•	 Predictions
So, What Is a User 
Profile/Persona?
Profiles or personas describe the goals, expectations, motiva­
tions, and behavior of real people. Why do they come to your 
site? What are they looking for? What makes them nervous? 
And so on. All the information you need should be in your

Creating User Profiles

themselves.
Also remember that all users are not alike! You will probably 
have a few different behavioral groups, and they all deserve a 
good profile.
read on the weekends. They tend to be prolific social-media 
sharers, mostly to Twitter and LinkedIn. They ider themselves 
thought-leaders, so public image is important.
Why it’s useful
Now you have a lot of information to use! You know that 
fluffy content will not be popular, self-curating will 
be a big deal and you have a basis for setting up 
content categories. They need easy access to 
sharing, and only certain types of social 
sharing will be relevant.
You also get to say “no” to a 
Facebook campaign, because 
these users don’t spend time 
there, and “digest” emails (a 
summary of weekly activity) will 
be better than frequent notifica­
tions because these people are 
already pressed for time.
Think of “Ideal” 
Users; Several 
of Them!

think of the most valuable version of 
the users you see in real life. You’re not 
trying to support the current behavior; you’re

Step 3: What special powers does this device have?
Mobile devices travel with us so—surprise!—we spend 
more time on them and location becomes a factor. They 
are also small, so moving the device itself can be a fea­
ture. Laptops, on the other hand, don’t travel as well, but 
they are more powerful, they have huge screens and key­
boards, and the mouse allows more precise selections and 
functions. Don’t worry about “consistency” so much—
different devices require different thinking sometimes.
Step 1: Finger or mouse?
I am not going to cover this here, because Lesson 69, 
Touch versus Mouse is completely dedicated to this idea.
Step 2: Start small. 
Many people think “mobile first” has something to do 
with mobile being popular. Kind of, but not really: if you 
design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then 
you will focus on the content and your core functionality. 
That leads to simple, beautiful apps/sites. If you do it the 
other way around, it’ll be like trying to put a marshmallow 
into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.
LESSON 31
Devices
In today’s world, we’re not just talking about a single 
phone or laptop. Follow these six steps to help you 
think about designing for different devices:
66   
User Research

Step 6: Think about more than one screen at a time. 
This one is a bit advanced, but I think you’re ready for 
it. Can you use your phone and computer together, like 
a remote and a TV? Could a group of phones control a 
game on a tablet, all in the same room? What if you’re 
logged in on two devices, can you “throw” data from 
one to the other? Can the location of one device be used 
on another? What about syncing information; will that 
cause issues in real-time? What if two users log in to the 
same account at the same time, on different devices? 
Give it some thought!
Step 4: Consider the software. 
“Mac versus PC” is more than a cute ad campaign. Read 
through the UX guidelines before you start. Also, iOS 7 or 
Windows 8 look different than iOS 6 or Windows Vista. 
You might need to choose which versions you will sup­
port and which you will ignore. Every time you support 
one, it multiplies the design, development, and mainte­
nance time in the future. Think ahead!
Step 5: Be responsive. 
Is it on the Web? Does it support a few different types of 
phones? What if Apple makes a new iPhone that is a little 
different? The modern Internet—whether it is a website 
or an app—works on all devices. Decide whether a couple 
different layouts will do the job or whether you should 
create a fully responsive site for all types of customers.

The Limits of Our Minds

Intuition is often called common sense. Or, your “gut feeling.” 
And some people believe they have a special talent for 
intuition (nope). But, for everyone, your intuition always feels 
true. However, common sense isn’t as common as you might 
think. Intuition is not something you are born with. Trust me, 
babies make terrible UX designers. Intuition is constructed 
from your experiences; you expect certain things based on 
what you have experienced before.
People from North America might be confused when they 
go to a public toilet in Asia and only see a hole in the floor. 
Whereas two people from Asia might be equally confused 
about squatting over those crazy water chairs in North 
America.
Intuitive, schmintuitive. Normal is relative.
The tricky part for many people is that your beloved intuition 
can also be wrong when there is a right answer. Really, really 
often.
As a UX Designer, Gut Feelings 
Can Be Your Worst Enemy
You will often hear 
people say “trust 
your gut.” That 
is stupid advice, 
because everybody 
trusts their gut. 
You’re born that 
way. It’s like saying 
“eat what tastes 
good.” I might not 
be a doctor, but 
that isn’t the best 
advice if you want 
to be healthy. (We 
will learn why it still 
LESSON 32
What Is Intuition?
One word you will hear fairly often in UX design 
is “intuitive.” That means the user will understand 
without much explanation or training. Not you.

The Limits of Our Minds

You know too much, remember?! 
Saying your own design is intuitive is like saying you are 
the smartest person in the mirror. You need data and user 
feedback to know for sure. That’s how I know that I am the 
smartest person in my mirror.
feels like good advice, in the next lesson, What Is a Cognitive 
Bias?)
Trusting your gut guarantees you will be wrong eventually. 
Many times. Not trusting your gut is the only way to avoid 
those mistakes.
A UX Designer’s Job Is to Design 
for Other People’s Gut Feelings
Not your own.
When it comes to thousands or millions of users, “intuitive” 
means that most people understand it, regardless of whether 
you are included in “most people.”
Lesson 32: What Is Intuition?    71

Next time you want a raise at work, aim high. You won’t 
get the full amount, but the raise you get will be higher 
than it would have been otherwise.
Bandwagon Effect
The more people who believe something, the more likely 
it is that other people will believe it, too. Information 
doesn’t become more true or more false because lots of 
people believe it, but your brain doesn’t know that. Your 
mom always said, “If everybody jumped off a bridge, 
would you do it, too?” (Because all the other moms say 
that.)
This is why you should usually show how many people 
have Liked, registered for, or shared something. It’s also 
why informercials say garbage like “a million people can’t 
be wrong!” 
Oh yes they can!
Have you ever seen The Matrix? When Neo (Keanu Reeves) 
meets The Architect, it is revealed that there have been other 
Neos before. They are a “systemic anomaly” that happens 
from time to time. A flaw in the system.
Cognitive biases are sort of like that. If you ask people certain 
types of questions, or ask in a certain way, the “intuition 
system” will reliably choose the wrong answer. Those “mis­
takes” are something we can use in UX design. We can let 
users choose whatever they want, and most of the time they 
will choose what we want. If you do it right.
Some examples will help:
Anchoring
The first number you say affects the next number in 
someone’s head. For example, if you ask people to 
donate to a charity, they might give an average of $2. But 
if you “suggest” a donation of $10, the average will go 
up to something more like $5. Nothing changed, but you 
anchored donors to $10, which made $2 feel lower.
LESSON 33
What Is a Cognitive Bias?
Your brain is a system. Certain types of information go in, certain types 
of decisions come out. But like many systems, if you give it information 
it wasn’t designed for, you can get less-than-perfect results.
72   
The Limits of Our Minds

There are many types of cognitive biases; too many for this 
course. To learn more, read the whole list on Wikipedia.
Decoy Effect
This is one of my favorites. Imagine you want to subscribe 
to a newspaper, and these are the choices:
–– Web Only: $10
–– Print Only: $25
–– Print & Web: $25
Which one is the best deal? After a few sec­
onds to consider it, there is about an 80% 
chance that you think Print & Web is the 
best value.
Why? Because the Print Only price is 
the “decoy”—nobody will choose it. 
Its only purpose is to make the most 
expensive price look like a good 
deal. Even though nobody chooses 
it, if you remove it, about 60% of 
people will choose the cheap­
est option instead.
It’s not rational. It’s biased. 
If you have an election 
coming up soon in your 
country, think carefully.
Lesson 33: What Is a Cognitive Bias?    73

actually giving every user a small aneurysm. Choosing 
carefully from three things is easy. Choosing carefully 
from 30 things is impossible.
2.	 What You See Is All There Is
Most people will only consider the choices that they are 
offered, even if other possibilities exist. On the TV show 
The Bachelor, you never hear him say, “The second rose 
goes to… the camera guy, Bruce.”
Bruce might deserve that rose, but he’s not an option. If 
The Bachelor could still choose from everyone on Planet 
Earth, it wouldn’t be a good show. Whether you’re 
designing shipping options, or subscription features, or 
survey questions, this is important. Every choice should 
take the user closer to their goal, and you can design the 
choices so they are good for your goals in the process.
Many new designers think about user choices as a random 
event. The users could pick anything! 
Well, sort of.
They can choose randomly, but they won’t. And they 
shouldn’t. Sometimes, it really doesn’t matter (to us) what 
the user chooses. But sometimes it is the difference between 
success and failure. Always give users the options they need, 
and make sure everything is easy to find, but—as a UX 
designer—you can also maximize your own goals, without 
sacrificing anything for the user.
Here are four good principles:
1.	 The Paradox of Choice
In theory, choosing nothing is always an option.
The more options you offer someone, the harder it is to 
choose. That’s called the Paradox of Choice. If the user 
can’t decide, they will leave. Providing lots of options 
might feel like “something for everyone,” but you’re 
LESSON 34
The Illusion of Choice
Regardless of what you are designing, it’s only a matter of time before 
you have to let your users choose their own adventure. Whether it’s 
a menu, a set of prices, or a list of products, UX affects that choice.
74   
The Limits of Our Minds

–– Describe which type of people should choose each 
option. Which one is more you? Many products have 
a “pro” version so it comes with some status. Are you 
an amateur or a pro?
–– Put your features in a list so the user can see what 
they “lose” by choosing the free version instead of 
the premium version.
–– Have a sale! Forever! Include the “regular” price so 
users can see how much they are “saving.” Make 
sure they save the most on the most profitable 
option.
I could go on, but you get the idea.
3.	 Choose Defaults Wisely
Dan Ariely’s Ted Talk about decision-making includes one 
of the best examples of good/bad defaults that I have 
seen.
In a nutshell: countries that made people choose to be an 
organ donor got very few people to do it. Countries that 
made people choose not to be an organ donor had more 
than 90% organ donors.
It’s easier for a user do nothing than to do something. 
The lazy option should be the best one for your company 
and—ideally—for the user. If the user can truly choose 
“anything”—like a pay-what-you-want situation—then 
anchoring is the way to set a default in their mind.
4.	 Comparisons Are Everything
Users are choosing things based on comparing their 
options. Therefore, you should create comparisons that 
make your preferred options look better. In the previous 
lesson, we learned about the Decoy Effect. That’s one 
way to make an option look better. Here are some more:
–– You can point out which option is the “best value,” 
or the “most popular,” or “most edible.”
–– You can present subscriptions as “per month” or “per 
day” prices so users can see that yearly subscriptions 
are cheaper per month, even though they are more 
expensive in total.
Lesson 34: The Illusion of Choice    75

“Whoa.”—Ted “Theodore” Logan
Here are a few ways to get the attention of users:
Motion
This is the highest-ranking part of your visual system, so 
when something moves, your attention is drawn to it by 
reflex. But if everything is moving, the stationary item 
gets the attention.
Surprise
This is not the same thing as “shock” or “delight”—this is 
the principle behind pattern breaking in Lesson 54. When 
something doesn’t match what we expect, we notice.
Big text
This usually indicates the “main information” in the 
design, so our eyes tend to go there first.
Your brain can only consciously do one thing at a time, so it 
has to focus. That focus moves from one thing to another, all 
day long. That’s called attention. Ironically, most designers 
forget about attention. It seems so simple, yet we constantly 
overlook it. From what I have seen, people treat attention like 
a ticking time bomb. They do as much as possible, hoping 
that something will create interest, before time runs out.
That’s not how attention works.
Attention is like a spotlight. It points at a specific thing. If you 
want to point it at something else, you have to stop point­
ing it at the first thing. As you move the spotlight, anything 
outside of the light will go unnoticed. The other columns of 
content. The banners. The other banners. And the custom 
banners that you call something else internally so it doesn’t 
feel like you’re advertising to your own users (still banners!).
If you want people to notice something, it either has to be 
close to the spotlight or obvious in the dark.
LESSON 35
Attention
This lesson is about one simple idea that most people 
think about in the wrong way. However, that one idea 
can affect everything in your approach to design.
76   
The Limits of Our Minds

UX isn’t about creating a perfect world. It’s about eliminat­
ing everything that competes with our goals and user goals. 
Good UX is reductive, not expansive.
If God were a UX designer, you would be sitting in a small, 
dark, sound-proof room, in a comfortable chair, with no clock, 
using a device that could only display his website or app.
Who knows, maybe you are.
“Whoa.”—Bill S. Preston, Esq.
Sound
Audible alerts can be one of the most annoying things on 
the Internet, but it does get your attention. When used 
more elegantly, it works well.
Contrast and Color
These can make parts of your design jump out from your 
peripheral vision. Users will notice those parts without look­
ing directly at them. This is covered in Lessons 52 and 53.
What Are You Sacrificing to Get 
Attention?
Every time you add an extra message or 
pull someone’s attention with motion 
or sound, you are also stealing their 
attention from everything else.”Paying” 
attention really does have a “cost”: an 
opportunity cost.
It might be fun when people comment 
on that all-singing, all-dancing User 
Interface (UI) detail somebody worked 
so hard on, but if that causes them to 
miss the Buy Button, it’s a bad design 
choice. If a UX designer wants to 
design “everything a user can expe­
rience,” she’s missing the point of 
attention.
Lesson 35: Attention    77

All Memories Are Not Created Equal
Your brain puts more emphasis on the experiences that have 
stronger feelings and more “novelty” (they grabbed your 
attention, at the time). Your brain is also good at remember­
ing patterns and things you do over and over. That’s called 
practice, or a habit, or muscle memory.
AS A UX DESIGNER
You should read those last few sentences as tools that you 
can use in your designs. Part of that is done by using all the 
skills you have learned so far. Part of that is done after the 
experience is over.
Emphasize with Bias
In my book The Composite Persuasion, I dedicated a whole 
chapter to the idea of changing people’s memories. Here are 
a few tips:
Memory Is Really Cool
This lesson barely scratches the surface.
You base a lot of decisions on your memories, but your 
long-term memories might be different than they appear. 
Our brains don’t record memories like a video. Memories are 
reconstructed, from associations, each time you think about 
them. But associations change over time. You might become 
an expert in physics, or grow out of your go-to-school-
dressed-like-a-vampire phase.
That means it will become impossible for you to remember 
physics like a beginner, or to think about fake fangs as a cool 
accessory. Each time you remember something, you change 
that memory forever.
LESSON 36
Memory
The experiences you remember are not complete, accurate, 
honest, and sometimes they aren’t even real. That means 
it is possible to “design” what people remember.
78   
The Limits of Our Minds

Your memory is the same. You should record interviews or 
take notes that are good enough for someone else to use, 
and document your research (with sources!).
Beware of False Memory
Believe it or not, some things we remember are completely 
false. They never happened, and they are not a version of a 
real event. There are videos on YouTube of people experienc­
ing false memories in real life.
Still want to do everything users say?
Remind them of the good parts. 
If you buy a Macbook from Apple, the next email you get 
will be full of feature highlights. I’ll bet you a high-five 
that it changes the way you remember your reasons for 
buying.
Create habits.
It is useful to build patterns of clicks/touches that peo­
ple can learn and repeat quickly. Think: Tinder swipes. It 
might be new at the beginning, but once users can do it 
easily, they will remember it as being obvious the whole 
time. (Photoshop, anyone?)
Personalize. 
Many websites use your choices to 
improve your next visit. My Pinterest 
feed is about 80% things I like now, 
but my first experience was only about 
10% things I liked. Same with Reddit. 
However, I just know that. I don’t remem­
ber it.
Research and Memory
Nothing a user says in an interview or on a survey 
should be considered a fact. It is merely an impression. 
I once saw a survey where users were asked, “What 
website did you visit before this one?” The Google 
Analytics data showed that more than 30% of people were 
wrong, and that was a memory from five minutes before. 
Lesson 36: Memory    79

Motivations versus Time
Earlier, in Lesson 15, you learned how time affects emotions, 
but not how it affects motivations. Check it out:
Imagine that I offer you $100 now, or $120 next year. In real 
life, you would probably take $100 now, even though $120 is 
clearly more money. Now imagine you want something that 
costs $100 now, or $50 next year, or $10 per month over the 
next 12 months.
In real life, most people will pay $10 per month—like you did 
with your smart phone—because it is the best option “now.” 
Even though that is the most expensive option later (do the 
math!).
Hyperbolic Discounting might sound like a complex piece of 
mathematics, but it is actually a fairly simple idea:
Whatever is happening to you now (or soon) seems 
more important than what will happen to you later (or 
in the future).
It applies to your perception of value, and how you judge 
your own emotions, and how you make important decisions. 
It’s why most people don’t save money well, and why plans 
almost always take longer than expected. People get fat 
because eating unhealthy food is easier and more fun “now” 
than working out to be fit “later.”
Usability is basically the idea of getting people to the things 
they want as close to “now” or with as little effort as possi­
ble. The more work it takes or the longer they have to wait, 
the worse the experience feels.
LESSON 37
Hyperbolic Discounting
Usability is a big area of the UX world, and it is a critical 
element in most—if not all—projects. There is one 
cognitive bias that forms the backbone of usability, and it 
affects the way we predict the future and ourselves.
80   
The Limits of Our Minds

When you try to deactivate your Facebook account, it uses 
Hyperbolic Discounting to change your mind. The form is long 
and boring, so your emotions have time to decrease. Near the 
end, it shows you pictures of friends you will lose now, which 
replaces the impulsive motivation to destroy Facebook (and 
everything associated with it) later.
Most people quit before deactivating, even though, techni­
cally, nothing is stopping them.
Usability Is a Two-Way Street
In UX, we talk about usability a lot. Most of the time we 
want things to be easier, faster, simpler. Those are things the 
user wants now. Everything in your design should be based 
on getting users to the most valuable actions as quickly and 
easily as possible. But your design should also make destruc­
tive actions more time consuming and unemotional so they 
feel less appealing.
Like Facebook does.
Lesson 37: Hyperbolic Discounting    81


VI
Information Architecture

Information Architecture (IA) is the idea of giving a bunch of 
information some structure (i.e., organizing it, somehow). IA 
can be relatively simple with a small project, and incredibly 
complicated with a large project. IA is invisible. To work with 
it, we need to draw a site map.
This example shows a website with six pages: The home 
page, two sections in the main menu, and three subsections. 
The lines indicate which pages are connected by navigation 
(menus and buttons).
NOTE
A million users doesn’t mean you have a million profile 
pages. You have one profile page that can display any user’s 
profile.
When pages are organized this way—like a family 
tree—it is called a “hierarchy” or “tree.” Most sites 
and apps are organized like this (but it’s not the only 
way).
There are no “rules” for drawing site maps, but here 
are some general guidelines:
LESSON 38
What Is Information Architecture?
So far, we have mostly discussed the ways to understand users 
and UX. In this lesson, we actually start making shit. The first step 
in designing a real solution is the general structure of the thing.
84   
Information Architecture

•	 Just because it looks simple, doesn’t mean it makes sense.
•	 Keep it clear and readable.
•	 We usually draw top-to-bottom, not left-to-right.
•	 Don’t make a site map “fancy.” It’s a technical document, 
not a fashion show.
Deep or Flat, Not Both
Generally speaking, your site map will either be very “flat”—
which includes more sections in the menu and requires less 
clicks to reach the bottom—or your site map will be “deep”—
simpler menus, but more clicks to get where you’re going.
Notice that both of the structures in this example have the 
same number of pages. Equal, but different.
Sites with a lot of products, like Wal-Mart, often need a deep 
architecture; otherwise, the menus get ridiculous. Sites like 
YouTube, which only has users and videos to deal with, are 
usually more flat. If your site is deep and flat, that’s bad. You 
might want to simplify your goals, or design a good search as 
a core feature.
COMMON MY TH
You might hear people say that everything should be “three 
clicks away” at all times. This means they learned UX in the 
’90s and haven’t learned anything new since then. Focus 
on the user instead. Make sure they understand where they 
are and where they can go, at all times. If your navigation is 
easy and clear, the number of clicks is irrelevant.
Lesson 38: What Is Information Architecture?    85

Notice that nothing in the story tells me specifically how to 
solve or design those actions, just that they are possible. The 
purpose of these stories is to describe flows. Sequences of 
user choices. Not the final UI.
If the flows are simple and effective, you are doing a good job 
(so far).
Managers often think user stories are a way to order UX from 
the designer, but that is absolutely wrong. Why? Because a 
user story is basically a list of features or functions, and that 
has a major effect on the final solution. The UX Designer 
writes user stories to communicate to the team, not the other 
way around. That would be like telling Bob Ross what colors 
to use! (I was gonna say Michelangelo there, but let’s be 
honest, I made the right choice.)
A user story describes one possible path a user can take in 
your site or app. It should be short, but complete. You will 
need many user stories to describe your whole design.
A basic user story for Google.com might look like this:
1.	 The user arrives on the main search page.
2.	 The user can enter any search query and submit it with 
the mouse or keyboard.
3.	 The next page displays a list of search results with the 
most relevant results on top.
4.	 The user can click a link to go to the appropriate site, or 
they can navigate through more pages of results until 
they find something useful.
This is a little too simple, but you get the idea.
LESSON 39
User Stories
Information Architecture is not always easy to explain. It 
helps if you can talk about it with your team and think about 
it easily in your own head. User stories help you do that.
86   
Information Architecture

Categories
When you think of a retail store like H&M, you probably 
imagine its menu as a set of categories: “Men, Women, 
Kids, Sale,” and so on. Types of content. When you click 
those categories, you expect to see content that fits in 
that category.
This is the most common type of IA. However, if the 
categories are complex, like banking products, industrial 
chemicals, or sex toys (a friend told me), then you and 
your users might not have the same expectations about 
what is in those categories, and that can get confusing. 
If I want to buy a butt plug, is that under “Battery-
Operated” or “Glow-in-the-Dark”? Life is full of hard 
questions.
Ok, so now that you can write user stories, we need to bring 
your IA back into this. The structure of your pages determines 
the steps in your user stories. And to structure your pages, 
you have to pick a type of IA to work with (or a couple types, 
but let’s keep it simple for now).
Types of IA include:
•	 Categories
•	 Tasks
•	 Search
•	 Time
•	 People
Let me break it down for you (cue the DJ):
LESSON 40
Types of Information Architecture
There are many ways to organize a bunch of information. 
Depending on the type of content or the goals of your 
project, different structures can be better or worse.
Lesson 40: Types of Information Architecture    87

Time
If you’re just starting in UX, this might blow your mind a 
little: you can also design IA that changes with time. The 
simplest version would be your inbox, where messages 
are displayed in the order they arrived. That is time-based 
IA design. On a site, you would have pages for things like 
“hot right now, archived, later, new,” etc. Reddit or the 
Facebook News Feed are also examples of time-based 
design.
People
Facebook—or any social network—is IA based on people. 
All of the pages are designed around who the informa­
tion is about, and the relationships between them. Once 
you are on someone’s profile, Facebook uses categories 
(Photos, Friends, Places) to organize different types of 
content.
And there are probably many other types!
Tasks
Another way to organize your site or app is by the goals 
the users need to achieve. If you are a bank, perhaps 
something like “Save, Loan, Invest, Get Help, Open an 
Account” would make a simpler menu. If the user knows 
what they want, this is a great way to structure your 
design. But be careful: users don’t always know enough 
to choose their own adventure.
If you think about it, you will realize that a task-based site 
and a category-based site for the same company could 
look very different. It’s an important choice.
Search
If your site is very complex, or if it is mostly full of 
user-generated content, a search-based architecture like 
YouTube might make more sense. If YouTube only had 
categories (Funny, Sad, Ads, Movies, etc.) it would actu­
ally be hard to use and require a lot of work to keep the 
categories correct!
88   
Information Architecture

What Is a Dynamic Page?
A dynamic page is a page that isn’t always the same. It 
changes. For example:
•	 A dynamic page might react to your choices. When you 
choose more expensive shipping during the checkout 
flow, the total price changes automatically without leav­
ing the page.
•	 A dynamic page might look different depending on the 
user. Every person’s Facebook profile can show different 
content in the same page design because the page is 
dynamic.
•	 A dynamic page might act as a template for lots of con­
tent. Every article on the New York Times site might use 
the same page as a template, but the page fills itself with 
the article you have chosen each time.
What Is a Static Page?
A static page (or screen) is the most basic form of a digital 
layout. It will look precisely the same every time, for every 
user. It is hardcoded.
A real-life example might be that website you made when 
you were 13 that had a bunch of random animated GIFs in a 
chaotic layout beside a photo of your celebrity role-model and 
a slightly-too-honest-yet-vaguely-intriguing introduction of 
your super mature 13-year-old self.
Or, you know, images in your portfolio.
But static pages aren’t worse. They’re just simpler. Many 
product pages on apple.com have been static, because they 
were just pictures and text. Why over-complicate it?
LESSON 41
Static and Dynamic Pages
Some pages are always the same. Some pages are 
different for every user. Two different types of layout 
means two different types of design thinking.
Lesson 41: Static and Dynamic Pages    89

Things versus Containers
Static design is more about the exact layout, because static 
design doesn’t “do” very much. The things you design just 
sort of… sit there… like a boss!
For dynamic pages you have to design containers, not the 
content itself. You can never be exact.
A space for any headline. A space for any product image. A 
space for 15,000 posts about anything from babies, to Bieber, 
to latté art, to Bieber as a baby, to Bieber as latté art, and so 
on.
Containers can be different heights (short article or long 
article), different widths (short headline or a long headline), 
or they might even be empty sometimes!
Create No-Fail Scenarios
If a really long headline will break your layout, change the 
layout or don’t allow people to make headlines that long. 
If your layout will completely go to hell because somebody 
posted a tiny little photo, change the layout, or don’t allow 
them to upload tiny little photos.
Usually, it’s better if you change the layout. But don’t be 
afraid to create useful limitations so users will make more 
effective choices. 140 characters didn’t hurt Twitter, right? 
Just don’t be that designer who puts unnecessary limits on 
users because “This is the way the layout should be.” Users 
don’t like that guy.
90   
Information Architecture

Don’t Count Clicks or Pages
The architect of Grand Central Station didn’t count how many 
steps people would take or how many doorways they would 
go through, because it doesn’t matter.
It is more important to give people the right information at 
the right time so they know whether to turn left or right to 
find their train. A long hallway, like a flow with many pages, 
can be very simple to use, even though it’s long. And a short 
hallway with too many signs can be confusing, like a website 
with complex menus, even though it is “only” one choice.
Avoid Making a “Dead End” 
If you send a crowd of people into a hallway with no exit, 
you’re going to have problems, especially if someone farts.
If users navigate through several pages only to arrive at a 
page with no “next step,” they will leave or get lost, or get 
angry. Make sure there is always somewhere to go, and 
make sure the users know how to get there.
Imagine your users as a crowd of people in a physical place, 
like Grand Central Station in New York City. There are several 
predictable ways the crowds will move around the station, 
and if you’re the architect designing the station, you have to 
make sure the crowd moves easily.
An app or a website is a similar concept. Thousands or 
millions of people need to move through your Information 
Architecture without getting stuck or lost, and the easier it 
is for them to “flow” to where they want 
to go, the better your design will perform 
and the happier the users will be.
Whether they are flowing through the 
checkout, through projects in your portfo­
lio, or through the registration process on 
Facebook, this is important to think about.
Just like most people will go from the 
front door to a train, or from one train 
to another, your app or site will have 
common paths to consider, too.
LESSON 42
What Is a Flow?
If you want users to get from A to B, you have to design how they 
get there. And you definitely want users to get from A to B.
Lesson 42: What Is a Flow?    91

Users Only Go Backward When 
Confused or Lost—That’s Bad
You might think of your site as a tree with several branches, 
but users only think about the navigation options they can see 
right now or those that they have already used.
If a user clicks the back button, it doesn’t mean they are 
going “up a level” to retry their last decision. It means they 
have no fucking idea what to do. In a user’s mind, the back 
button is the “abort” button or the “nope” button. If, during 
user tests, you see users hitting “back” a lot, it means they 
are not finding what they want. And since you are probably 
sitting there watching them, it probably means that they 
would leave the site when they are alone.
User Motivation Is Rare, Not Common
When most people imagine users using their design, they 
imagine them reading all the text and checking every menu 
item and navigating right to the bottom of the site to find 
what they need.
If a user were being held hostage and had to explore your site 
under threat of waterboarding, they still might not be that 
thorough. If the user isn’t finding what they want, every extra 
click a user makes increases the odds that they will leave your 
site.
That includes clicks on the back button.
LESSON 43
Users Don’t Go Backward
It is really common to imagine your users navigating back 
to the page where they started or using the back button 
to find what they need. It is also really wrong.
92   
Information Architecture

Make Loops If You Want 
Users to Go Backward
When I say a “loop,” I mean something like this:
•	 Page A links to Page B.
•	 Page B links to Page C.
•	 Page C links to Page A.
The user can keep clicking forever without 
leaving your site.
Let’s say this loop is your port­
folio site. Page A shows the cate­
gories of work you have done. 
Page B is a list of projects within 
one category. Page C is details 
about one project. The user can 
pick a category, then a project, 
then read the details, and then 
navigate back to the categories 
without ever using the back 
button to navigate. They could 
see your entire portfolio without 
ever going “backward.”
If users can always click forward, 
they never have to stop and 
decide where to go next. 
Decisions are hard. Doing the 
same thing over and over is easy.
Lesson 43: Users Don’t Go Backward    93


VII
Designing Behavior

•	 You want users to do something.
•	 Users want to do something.
•	 Those two somethings might not be the same.
AS A UX DESIGNER
It is your job to make them the same. When the user 
completes their goal, you should also complete yours. That 
means you’re not just designing random artwork; you have 
intentions. Stores intend to sell stuff. Social networks intend 
to create registrations and social interactions. Porn sites 
intend you to… well, you get the idea.
A visual designer—like a UI designer—designs the interface 
itself. That’s important, but everyone has an opinion about 
how it looks. A lot of those opinions might be cryptic and 
useless, but still.
A UX designer designs how something works. i.e.—The 
behavior of the users. You can’t see behavior. But you can 
measure it.
UX Design Is Not a Matter of Opinion
One of the biggest new ideas when you get started with UX 
is the idea that you are now an active part of the design. You 
can predict and control what users choose, click, like, and do.
UX is the science of design. It’s all about results. But to get 
good results, you need to motivate users to be more effective. 
This also means that one UX design can be “more right” than 
another, regardless of which one everybody likes better. And 
we can prove it. Sometimes even the users prefer the wrong 
one! (This is covered in Lesson 24).
That can be a hard thing to accept, for many people.
Over the next five lessons, you will learn how to make people 
fight over imaginary things, drool when you ring a bell, how 
to “go viral,” create addictive games, and create trust in your 
designs and content.
LESSON 44
Designing with Intention
As UX designers, we should always have goals in mind: our 
own, and the users. Unlike UI design, your UX skills (or lack 
thereof) are measured by how well you achieve those goals.
96   
Designing Behavior

Feedback to Yourself
The mind-blowing part about emotions is that they are your 
brain giving feedback to your brain about something that 
happened. INCEPTION.
But since you, the designer, can control what happens, that 
means you can control the feedback. Which means you can 
train your users by rewarding them for something you con­
sider good, and punish them for something 
you consider bad. That is a powerful 
thing. It’s how we learned 
everything we 
know.
Feelings, Not Things
Most people are familiar with the general idea of a reward or 
a punishment. Reward = good. Punishment = bad. The part 
that a lot of people don’t understand is that rewards and 
punishments are feelings, not things. 
Your parents might have given you a toy for doing well in 
school, but the toy caused a happy feeling. Similarly, your 
parents might have taken away your 
bicycle because you started a meth 
business with your chemistry teacher, 
but it was the negative feeling that 
was the punishment, not the 
bicycle, and that feeling is what 
we’re interested in.
i.e., Rewards and punishments 
are emotions. You can cause 
those emotions in a million dif­
ferent ways.
LESSON 45
Rewards and Punishments
If psychology were math, this lesson would be when we move 
from adding and subtracting to multiplying and dividing. It’s easy, 
but it allows you to design behavior that grows over time.
Lesson 45: Rewards and Punishments    97

AS A UX DESIGNER
Users have plenty of their own natural associations and 
beliefs when they see your design for the first time. Use 
them. But you also get to create certain associations through 
your UX, UI, branding, and copywriting. Pay attention to 
when users feel good and bad. Over time, those rewards 
and punishments can create lasting associations and behav-
iors that boost engagement through the roof, or crush your 
entire company.
If you have ever wondered why people spend hours per day 
on Facebook but nobody could be bothered to use Google+, 
now you know.
Learning = Associations = Beliefs
The last really fundamental piece in our psychological model 
is the concept of associations. Over time, we can learn to feel 
positively or negatively about anything: your favorite colors, 
your lucky number, and the type of people you find attractive 
are all examples.
You “associate” those things with positive feelings, because 
they have been relevant when you experienced rewards in the 
past. Even if those associations are actually just superstitions 
(false beliefs). Punishments work the same way with negative 
associations. That’s how beliefs—including religions—are 
made, baby! So if your goal in this course is to start a cult, 
you’ll love the next few lessons.
98   
Designing Behavior

Types of conditioning
Classical
Connect a signal of your choice to an existing behavior. 
For example, when a bell rings, food comes out. Food 
makes dogs drool. After the bell becomes strongly asso­
ciated with food, the bell will make a dog expect food 
and drool all over himself. Therefore, the bell now causes 
drooling. And if drooling is your goal (that would be a 
weird app), you can trigger it any time you want.
Operant
Reward or punish a random action. Let’s say you find 
a new website and write a comment. Ten people like 
it. Cool. You write another comment. Five more likes. 
Wow! Now you’re hooked. You write a third. Somebody 
“The First Taste Is Free”
As any good drug dealer knows, nobody can be addicted to 
something they haven’t tried. So your mission is to get the 
user to a positive emotion within a minute or less, on the first 
visit. This is so important, in my opinion, that you should not 
launch anything until you achieve it.
IMPORTANT
A “punishment” doesn’t have to be painful. Think of it as a 
cost. It could be effort or money. People will do a little work 
or pay a little cash to get a reward, if the reward is worth it. 
But, the first reward should be free. Always.
LESSON 46
Conditioning and Addiction
Your job as a UX designer is to create experiences, not just 
observe them. So we need to do more than reward and punish 
what users naturally do. We need the science of training people 
to do something new, and then keep doing it. Forever.
Lesson 46: Conditioning and Addiction    99

Eventually the pigeon will be giving high-fives and drinking 
beer with the team. (This was actually done as a real experi­
ment, by real psychologists, and no pigeons were harmed. I 
admit, I was a bit jealous of their bowling scores.)
Timing Matters
How often does your design reward the user?
Regularly
If users are rewarded every time or “every X times,” they 
will begin to feel like they deserve it. Like a salary. It is 
hard to take that away, but it is also hard for users to 
walk away. Over time it gets boring, though, and it cre­
ates quantity, not quality. If your design can’t function 
without something, like the economy needs money in real 
life, then guaranteed rewards-for-work is useful.
Randomly
Slot machines will reward you often enough that you get 
hooked, but the rewards are unpredictable. This can be 
the most addictive, because there is always a chance that 
“the next one might be the big one.”
AS A UX DESIGNER
Random rewards based on the quality of content—like 
blogging or social media comments—will raise the level 
of content overall. If users cannot control rewards—like 
slot machines—it’s just as effective but makes them more 
selfish.
calls you an idiot. Hmmm. No more comments like that, 
I guess. The next one will be more like the first two. Six 
likes! Now you’re being trained.
Type of rewards and punishments
You can reward someone by giving something good or taking 
away something bad.
If you do something good, I can give you a treat. Or I can stop 
putting dog poo in your shoes. Either way, your experience 
gets better.
Both work.
However, if you do 100 things I like, you will have 100 treats. 
Or, you could just have your shoes, still without poo in them.
AS A UX DESIGNER
Focus on giving so there is a sense of progress over time. 
Plus, your users will become loyal instead of resenting you.
Shape Their Behavior
Big, complex behavior starts small. Want your pigeon to learn 
bowling? No problem. Reward it when it goes near the ball. 
Punish it when it moves away. Then, demand more. It must 
touch the ball to get the reward now. Then it has to push the 
ball to get a reward. And so on.
100   
Designing Behavior

Make It Addictive
Up until now we have talked about rewards and pun­
ishments as if you only do one or the other. But what 
if doing an action gets a reward, and not doing that 
action gets a punishment?
People presumably try drugs because they make you 
feel good the first time. However, after a while, not 
doing the drug makes you feel terrible. You can’t stop.
That’s addiction. Or FarmVille. In FarmVille, it was easy 
to get started, and if you keep playing, your farm 
becomes big and successful. However, if you stop 
playing, your crops die and your work is ruined—
unless you invite your friends… or pay.
Lesson 46: Conditioning and Addiction    101

LESSON 47

The difference between a game and a nongame has nothing to do 
with badges and points. It’s all about the psychology. Game design 
can be very nuanced, but let’s start with some fundamentals.
What Is a Feedback Loop?
A feedback loop has three ingredients: motivation, an action, 
and the feedback (emotion).
The user’s motivation might exist already, or it could be some­
thing you design for them, like beating Bowser in Mario Kart. 
That smug bastard.
Once the user is motivated, they need a way to act. This is 
when you start the race, or show them the problem to solve, 
or give them a place to type their comment, or whatever. 
Then, they need feedback: an evaluation, or score, or Likes, 
or real-time race positions, or something else that informs the 
user how effective they were/are.
One of the trendiest things in UX over the past few years have 
been the idea of adding “game mechanics” to things that 
aren’t actually games. One thing that games do very well is 
structuring rewards and punishments in a way that leads users 
through a series of goals. If you want to that, too, you came 
to the right place.
You will learn two major elements of game design:
•	 Feedback Loops
•	 Progressive Challenges
102   
Designing Behavior

Game Mechanics Are 
Motivations and Emotions
Feedback loops take your brain’s natural or “implicit” motiva­
tion and make it an external or “explicit” motivation by using 
symbols in the game. Rewards and punishments are feelings, 
not things. It’s how you trigger them that matters.
Badges and points are one way. Followers and Retweets are 
another. Friends and Likes, your job title and salary, and your 
street address and type of car—all symbols of progression.
Progression uses your motivation for status to make you “level 
up,” over and over. It’s the motivation to win, to improve, or 
to be better than Bowser. That arrogant son-of-a-bitch.
Loop it
It’s called a feedback “loop” because the feedback should 
be something that motivates the user to do the action again. 
Maybe they will try to beat their old score, or maybe they 
didn’t quite win this time, or maybe other people loved what 
they did.
Progressive Challenges
It’s nice if a game is really easy at first so new users can jump 
right in. But once people know how the game works, it’s not 
about just getting it done anymore. It’s about getting it done 
better. To create progression, you merely have to create a 
bigger, better, harder way to do what the user already knows.
The idea of “progression” is the reason for levels in Super 
Mario, or badges in Foursquare, or campaigns in Battlefield, 
or stars in Angry Birds. Any goal that is more difficult than the 
previous goal.
Often, companies will make you pay to access the higher 
levels, because now you’re addicted. A Game/UX designer did 
that. And you should, too.
Lesson 47: Gamification    103

•	 You pin something on Pinterest. The original pinner gets 
feedback. Your followers see the pin in their feed, from 
you.
Virality Is Much More Than 
Sharing: It’s a Feature
If you are working on a social network or an app with social 
features, or your site is based on user-submitted content, or if 
your dream is to be the next Grumpy Cat, this is for you.
The Basic Formula
Action from User A = Feedback for User B = 
Content for User C
For example:
•	 You share a friend’s photo on Facebook. That’s your 
action, which gives feedback to your friend. When you 
share it, the rest of your friends see the photo in their 
feed, with a note saying you shared it.
•	 You retweet something on Twitter. The original tweeter 
gets the feedback. Your followers see the tweet in their 
feed, from you.
LESSON 48
Social/Viral Structure
The Internet is famous for making things “go viral” but if your site 
isn’t designed to create viral word-of-mouth, it won’t. In this lesson, 
we’ll learn how to translate emotional content into viral popularity.
104   
Designing Behavior

Why Does This Work?
Viral structure achieves a few things when done right:
2-in-1 actions
The user who originally does the action does it for them­
selves. Always. Virality is an automatic machine that trans­
lates your emotional actions into more content.
Good shit floats
This type of feature turns your design into a “quality con­
tent” machine. The more actions people do on a piece of 
content, the more visible it gets. But content that nobody 
likes, disappears.
Social proof
It shows people that someone relevant liked it. Hopefully 
many relevant people. Then, affiliation kicks in.
Self-promotion
Since everyone can see who shared something, it creates 
an incentive to share more, to make yourself more visible 
(Status).
Network saturation
When everyone you know believes something, you are 
much more likely to believe it, too.
And so on.
Then, even more people see it, do actions, which give feed­
back, and creates even more content…
Ta da! More viral than a group of toddlers with the flu.
However, Facebook doesn’t show Likes to very many people, 
like it does with a Share. And Twitter doesn’t show Favorites 
to people like a Retweet. And Pinterest doesn’t show Likes to 
people like a Pin.
It’s ok to have actions that don’t create Viral Loops, but they 
should usually be lower priority visually in your design—the 
second choice; or third.
Facebook’s Share links are way too small and quiet (visu­
ally), and Share is the last one in the list. Twitter’s Reply and 
Retweet are first in the list, but still visually quiet. Pinterest’s 
Pin button is obvious and red and on the left. 
Facebook sucks for virality. Twitter is better (within a short 
time frame). Pinterest is even better (for images). Surprised?
Lesson 48: Social/Viral Structure    105

2.	 Nothing is 100% positive or negative
Top-rated product reviews are both positive and nega­
tive. It has also been shown that app ratings and book 
reviews are most-trusted when they do not have all 5-star 
ratings. A few 3- or 4-star ratings actually increase sales. 
Real people feel suspicious when something seems “too 
perfect.”
3.	 Democratize
As a group your users can be like a quality filter. Some 
companies use artificial intelligence to identify good con­
tent or prevent fraud, when they could be using actual 
intelligence. If you build voting and rating tools that are 
hard to abuse (limit the number of votes, require some 
experience to vote, etc.), what you have actually done is 
identify what your users trust most.
Trust Is a Critical Element 
in Everything You Do
There are lots of ways to create trust, but when users don’t 
trust your design, your perspective often prevents you from 
realizing it.
Here are seven simple ideas that are always worth 
considering:
1.	 Professionalism
This might seem obvious, but you need to look like a real 
company (i.e., not a scam). Part of that is visual design, 
part isn’t. Real companies will protect your data, survive 
until next year, and send you the stuff you just paid for. 
Companies often focus all their attention on the sales 
team and advertising; meanwhile, their website is five 
years old and wasn’t very good in the first place. That 
hurts trust.
LESSON 49
How to Create Trust
In UX design, it can be easy to slip into all the structures 
and techniques and forget about the fact that users 
are real people and they can tell when you’re full 
of shit. Context matters. Honesty matters.
106   
Designing Behavior

7.	 Use simple words
It is a myth that complicated language makes you more 
persuasive. Just speak like a normal person would speak. 
The more complicated you get, the fewer people will 
understand. Nobody trusts what they don’t understand.
4.	 Accountability
Trust can be built by showing information and by hiding 
it. Real names and contact information can reduce the 
amount of hateful, aggressive comments you get, and 
can make a company feel more personal. However, hiding 
someone’s identity will make them more comfortable 
with sharing private or embarrassing information. And 
doing the opposite will get the opposite result. Showing 
that you understand the consequences of information will 
create trust.
5.	 Handle negativity with grace
Many people panic when they get negative feedback in 
public, but you shouldn’t. When a company receives neg­
ative feedback and then deals with it gracefully in public 
they actually build more trust than positive feedback 
does. So pause, be thoughtful, and focus on solving the 
user’s problem instead of protecting your ego.
6.	 Keep users informed
So simple, yet so neglected. Think about what users need 
to make a purchase or register. Will there be shipping 
costs? Will you share my email address? Will I get spam? 
Will you charge my credit card immediately? Just tell them 
up front! It is better to tell the truth than let the user 
worry about it. Even when the truth isn’t the answer the 
users wants.
Lesson 49: How to Create Trust    107

Hidden versus Visible: 
The Paradox of Choice
In most projects, there will be situations where you have to 
decide how “clean” you want your layout to be. Designers 
will usually choose to hide everything because it looks better. 
Non-designers will want all of their favorite features to be 
visible all of the time, which will be a different set of features 
for each person.
So, how do you choose?
Visible features will always be used more and discovered more 
than hidden features. We are reminded that they exist every 
time we see them. However, the “Paradox of Choice” says the 
more options you see, the less likely you are to choose any of 
them. So, if you overload normal users with too many choices, 
they will freak out and run away screaming.
Power Users Are the Minority
Statistically-speaking, it is impossible for advanced or power 
users to be “most” of the people using your design; although 
it can be very tempting to believe that.
Unless your product/service is highly technical, the vast 
majority of your users will be normal people with other stuff 
to do. Not super-focused, tech-savvy people like you and your 
colleagues.
HARD TRUTH
If you want millions of happy users, design for the distracted 
idiots, not the obsessed geniuses.
LESSON 50
How Experience Changes Experience
New users and experienced users will see your design differently.
108   
Designing Behavior

If your users are forced to deal with a large amount of infor­
mation, give them some suggestions of categories or some 
other kind of help to remind them where to look!
Learning Is Slow; Habits Are Fast
“Onboarding” is the word we use to describe the step-by-
step lessons or very simple introductions to a new interface. 
It helps new users find the main features easily, and avoid 
confusion. However, what happens when the user has used 
your interface for two years?
Habits are created very quickly in your users’ minds, so you 
should design a “fast way” to do key features, which might 
not be as obvious. Power users will take the time to learn 
them for the sake of extra productivity. Keyboard shortcuts, 
right-click options, and all the little Twitter tricks like “.@” 
tweets are examples of this idea.
Make sure beginners can find the core features easily. Ideally, 
without clicking anything. And try to give power users easy 
access to advanced features, even if they aren’t visible all the 
time.
PROTIP
Have you hidden 20 social media options behind a single 
“share” button? Are you excited about how much cleaner 
it looks?! Unfortunately, you haven’t designed a “simple” 
interface. You have just crippled your sharing features 
because there are too many choices and nobody can see 
them. Counterintuitive, right?
Choose a few options and make them visible all of the time. 
You’ll thank me later.
Recognition versus Memory
How many different icons could you name off the top of your 
head, right now? How many could you recognize if I gave you 
a list? If you’re a normal human, the second answer would be 
a lot more.
If you design your interface so people have to ask for some­
thing—like search—they will only use the features they can 
remember. This means that, over time, they will use fewer and 
fewer features. Not more and more.

Designing Behavior

VIII
Visual Design Principles

The idea of visual weight is fairly intuitive. Some things look 
“heavier” than others in a layout. They draw your attention 
more easily. And that idea is valuable to a UX designer. Your 
job is to help users notice the things that matter. And it is 
equally important not to distract the users from their goals.
By adding visual “weight” to certain parts of your design, you 
increase the chance that a user will see them and you change 
where their eyes will go next. Remember: visual weight is 
relative. All visual principles are about comparing a design 
element to whatever is around it.
So, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to the stars 
of the UX Crash Course: The Rubber Ducks! *applause here*
Contrast
The difference between light things and dark things is called 
contrast. The more distinguishable a light thing is compared 
to a dark thing, the “higher” the contrast.
In UX, you want to give important things higher contrast, like 
the duck in the center. In this case, most of the image is light, 
so a dark duck is more 
noticeable. If the image 
were mostly dark, the 
lighter duck would be more 
noticeable.
If these were buttons, more 
people would click the dark 
one than if all the buttons 
were the same color.
LESSON 51
Visual Weight (Contrast and Size)
This lesson is the first of five visual principles that will help you direct 
the user’s attention. Some parts of your design are more important 
than others, so we have to help users notice the important stuff. 
112   
Visual Design Principles

As a general rule, you want more important things to be 
bigger than less important things. This creates a visual “hier­
archy” on the page and makes it easier to scan, but it also 
allows you to choose what the user notices first. That’s why 
it’s wrong to “make the logo bigger,” unless you want users 
to stare at your logo instead of buying something.
Depth and Size
In the real world, we notice things that are close to us more 
than things that are far away.
In the digital world, bigger things are perceived to be closer, 
like the middle duck in the second illustration, and something 
that is smaller is perceived to be farther away (like the blurry 
duck in the back.) If the ducks were all the same 
size, you would probably look at them from 
left to right (assuming you read that way). 
If you use blur effects or shadows 
it just makes the perception of 
depth more realistic. Size has 
this effect even if your 
design looks “flat.”
Lesson 51: Visual Weight (Contrast and Size)    113

LESSON 52
Color
Real life is full of sunlight, artificial light, heat, cold, clothing, brands, 
fashion, and a million other things that affect the way we perceive 
colors. As a UX designer, we might not care about Pantones and 
brand guidelines, but we definitely have to learn about color.
114   
Visual Design Principles

Recede or Advance
The other thing to keep in mind is that colors can be “loud” 
or “quiet.” The second image in Lesson 52 shows a red duck 
and two blueish ones. The red duck almost looks a little 
closer, doesn’t it? It’s not. Something like a “buy” button 
should have a color that makes it jump off the screen. More 
people will click a color that “advances” (comes forward).
On the other hand, sometimes we want things to step back 
so they are visible, but not too distracting, like the two blueish 
ducks. They “recede” (sink backward). This is good for some­
thing like a menu that is always on the screen. If it is always 
yelling at you, that’s unnecessary and it steals focus from 
more important things.
Keep Wireframes Simple
Colorful wireframes just get in the way of the functional 
details. Use colors where they matter, but don’t make your 
wireframes blue like blueprints, or dress them up for clients. It 
makes all discussions about color confusing: “No, the website 
won’t be blue…”
Combine Visual Principles
Color can work really well with the previous lesson about Visual 
Weight. Something big is noticeable, but you can’t miss some­
thing big and red! Make your errors and warning labels red and 
high contrast. Or, if you’re just confirming what the user did, 
something a little smaller in a receding green might be perfect.
There are a few things we can learn about color from the 
Technicolor rubber duckies on the preceding page. As UX 
designers, we usually rock the wireframes in black and white. 
And that’s a good thing! We focus on the function, while the 
UI designers can focus on the look, feel, and style. However, 
sometimes color is function. Like traffic lights, or making the 
color of a popsicle match the flavor. You know, important shit.
Meaning
In the first illustration in this lesson, we see three ducks in 
different colors: blue, yellow, and red. They’re so handsome. 
Immediately, these ducks seem to have different tonality, and 
it is easy to imagine how the colors can change what each 
duck “means.”
If the ducks were buttons, they might be “confirm,” “cancel,” 
and “delete.” If they were indicators on a fuel tank, they 
might represent “full,” “half,” and “empty.” Or if they were 
on a stove:  “cold,” “warm,” and “hot.”
You get the idea: the ducks are identical, but colors change 
the meaning. If you don’t need to indicate something like 
that, let the UI designer choose colors. But if you do, let your 
wireframes do the talking.
PROTIP
Don’t argue with other designers about the specific shade of 
color. In UX, pale red and primary red are both red. That’s all 
you care about.
Lesson 52: Color    115

Western world, you will probably look at them from left to 
right because that’s how we read. If that row of ducks were 
a menu or a list, we would do the same thing. Therefore, you 
could expect more people to click the options on the left, and 
fewer people to click the options on the right.
Who knew we could learn so much from rubber ducks?!
Human brains have a particular talent for patterns and 
sequences. Whenever something in nature happens over and 
over, we will quickly notice. In fact, we don’t just notice, we 
think about those things differently.
The first image shows five identical rubber ducks in a row. We 
don’t see five individual ducks though, we see a row of ducks. 
We treat them as a group or a sequence, and if you live in the 
LESSON 53
Repetition and Pattern-Breaking
One important visual design principles involves the creation 
of patterns to move the user’s eyes to important things. And 
like all good rules, patterns are made to be broken.
116   
Visual Design Principles

This might seem simple and obvious, but when you apply that 
principle to your designs—or your dance routines—it can make 
people notice the important buttons, options, or pop stars.
Be careful: pattern-breaking can also lead the user’s eyes 
away from other important things. Before you can break a 
pattern, you have to make one.
Combine Your Principles
To make a pattern or a sequence, keep visual weight and 
color consistent. The user’s eye will start at one end and 
follow the pattern to the other end. To break the pattern, just 
switch it up in the place where you want to add focus. Make 
the “Register Now” button an unexpected color, size, shape, 
or style, and watch your clicks go up overnight!
Breaking a Pattern
The second image shows the same five rubber ducks (still 
lookin’ good, aren’t they?) but this time one of them has 
gone solo. We’ll call her Beyoncé.
That changes everything. Now we see a row of four (jealous) 
ducks, and Beyoncé is alone, in the spotlight. She woke up 
like that! It is hard not to focus on Beyoncé, even though all 
five ducks are equally majestic creatures.
Now, if that were a menu, the middle option would get far 
more clicks than before because our eyes fixate on it. Also, 
those clicks would be stolen from the left options, so the left 
options would be less popular than before (although probably 
still more popular than the far-right option).
That’s a powerful thing to know.
Lesson 53: Repetition and Pattern-Breaking    117

Line Tension
The first image shows eight ducks in a row. We don’t see 
eight individual ducks; we see a line. That’s line tension. The 
perception of a line or a “path” when there isn’t one. Our 
eyes will follow the path to see where it goes. Super useful.
Are you tired of the ducks yet? I didn’t think so. 
Visual “tension” is a concept that seems very elementary, 
but you’d be amazed how useful it can be. Our brains are a 
little too good at seeing patterns where they don’t exist. As a 
designer you can use that.
LESSON 54
Line Tension and Edge Tension
Repetition, as we learned in the last lesson, creates a pattern. 
However, certain types of repetition can also create the 
perception of shapes that affect where the user’s eyes will go.
118   
Visual Design Principles

The result can be “shapes.”
In the second image, I have arranged the ducks so they 
appear to form the corners of a box. You could see 12 ducks, 
or four groups of 3 ducks, but your mind really wants to see 
the box, so it does. Furthermore, now we can put things 
“inside” the box (like more ducks!), or in the spaces between 
If we break that path—like any broken pattern—the gap 
steals more focus.
Edge Tension
So far, we have assumed there is only one line. But what if we 
create line tension using more than one line?
Lesson 54: Line Tension and Edge Tension    119

Combine Your Principles
In this lesson I have left the “tension” gaps blank, but you 
don’t have to. You can also use color to create a path like a 
gradient on a list of items. Or you can add visual weight to 
a group of elements by treating them like one shape instead 
of separate pieces. It’s a great way to direct the user’s eyes 
without adding any more things to a layout!
the corners. Similar to line tension, edge tension brings focus 
to the gaps.
Layout-wise, this can be an excellent way to put more focus 
on something small, like a label. Or you can create visual 
paths leading to the button you want people to click. Vintage 
ads use this technique often to put a small logo in focus. And 
conveniently, it makes a layout feel simpler and more cohe­
sive because a path or a box is only one mental thing, but 12 
separate ducks is too much awesome to handle.
120   
Visual Design Principles

•	 If you see motion, the far-right duck might be leading.
Those six ducks are identical. Only the alignment creates these 
perceptions. Buttons with similar functions can be aligned. 
Alignment
In the first image you see a group of six stunningly beautiful 
ducks, but you also see a lot of relationships, because of the 
way they are aligned:
•	 We see two rows.
•	 The far-left and far-
right ducks seem to be 
separated.
•	 The two center ducks seem 
the most organized.
•	 All ducks seem to be going in 
the same direction.
•	 If you see motion, the far-left duck 
might be falling behind.
LESSON 55
Alignment and Proximity
The last design principle you will learn about is how 
to add order and meaning to elements of your design 
without adding any more elements. It might sound 
subtle, but it affects everything you see, every day.
Lesson 55: Alignment and Proximity    121

Different levels of content can be aligned. Information can 
be in a grid of rows and columns like a spreadsheet to create 
complex meaning.
Proximity
The closeness or distance between two objects creates a 
feeling of those objects being related or unrelated. That dis­
tance is called proximity.
In the second image, you see six identical ducks that are not 
aligned horizontally or vertically, but you definitely see two 
groups. The ducks in each group seem together, like a team 
or a family. The only thing creating that perception is their 
proximity.
In your designs, put related elements closer together and 
unrelated elements farther apart. For example: a headline, a 
block of text, and a button that are all related to one action—
like a purchase or an app download—are usually designed 
like a “package.” That allows the user to understand that they 
go together without reading anything.
122   
Visual Design Principles

Motion Is Noticed First
If you have ever been disturbed by a vibrating banner or a 
jumping button, then you understand how motion can draw 
your attention. If you made a list of the things your brain 
notices, in order of priority, motion would be first. But, a little 
goes a long way. If you make a vibrating banner or a jumping 
button (which are really annoying to click, by the way) I will 
hunt you down and… well… let’s just say it won’t be pretty.
If Motion Makes People Wait, It’s Bad
Before you start designing amazing transitions between 
screens, and smooth animated buttons, and parallax gravity 
in your scrolling, think about the user. If the user is trying to 
navigate, or if they know what is coming, or if they have to 
see this animation a hundred times every time they use your 
site or app, you might be doing more harm than good.
Animations take time to show, and making users wait quickly 
gets frustrating. Even worse than waiting, sometimes anima­
tions make things hard to read, or they distract users from the 
content and buttons you want them to read and click.
LESSON 56
Using Motion for UX
In digital design, it is becoming more and more common to include 
animation or moti0on design as part of the UX. It’s a stylish detail, 
but in UX, you care about more than style. Motion is a tool.
Lesson 56: Using Motion for UX    123

the “end of the line.” If you are using motion to highlight key 
features or tell users where to go, straight lines are a good 
choice.
Straight lines point in a direction
Different types of motion will do different things to the user’s 
eyes. If you make something move in a straight line, the user’s 
brain will anticipate where it’s going and the user will look at 
124   
Visual Design Principles

Curved lines make people follow the curve
However, if you want to lead users around the screen—like 
when you’re explaining your app for the first time—curved 
motion will make their eyes stick to the path and stop where 
the animation stops.
Lesson 56: Using Motion for UX    125


IX
Wireframes and Prototypes

A wireframe is a technical document. Lines, boxes, labels. 
Maybe a color or two. That’s it.
Wireframes are often compared to 
blueprints because they have a similar 
purpose. A blueprint tells builders how 
to execute the architect’s plan. Not 
which wallpaper or furniture to choose. 
And blueprints are taken seriously. They 
aren’t a suggestion, or a “rough sketch,” 
or a “quick mock up.” All those sketches 
you make on whiteboards or during brain­
storming sessions are valuable, but they 
aren’t wireframes. They are your thoughts 
about the wireframes you will make later.
A wireframe might only take an hour to 
draw, but it can take weeks or months to 
plan. It is important that your colleagues and 
clients understand that. If another developer or 
designer can’t use your wireframe yet, it isn’t a wireframe. It’s 
a sketch. Keep going.
LESSON 57
What Is a Wireframe?
Wireframes are important, if not essential. If we are the “architect,” 
wireframes are the blueprints. But their simple appearance 
makes some people think they are simple, easy documents.

Explain early concepts/thoughts in words and pictures, 
not with wireframes. Show flows as icons, hand-drawn 
sketches, site maps, slides, or user stories instead; 
they’re better, faster to make, and easier for the client to 
understand.
2.	 Good wireframes take time.
I know they look basic, but there is a lot of thinking 
behind those empty rectangles. Every little piece must be 
planned and placed carefully on a specific page. Every link 
needs a destination. Every page needs a link (on another 
page) to get there. Every button needs to be where 
the user needs it, not where the user doesn’t need it. 
Wireframes are 90% thinking, 10% drawing. Make sure 
everyone respects the need for the 90% part!
3.	 Wireframes aren’t presented in phases.
Everything made by humans goes through “drafts” as 
we perfect our ideas, but wireframes are either ready or 
they’re not. If they’re not finished it is because something 
A wireframe is a planning document. It is a technical instruc­
tion document for the “builders.” Wireframes allow us to say 
insightful stuff like, “Oops, I forgot the main menu!” in the 
same way an architect could say, “Oops, I forgot the front 
door!”
Still, many people have a broad misunderstanding of wire­
frames and use them incorrectly. The following is a list of 
what wireframes are not. See if you recognize yourself in any 
of the Top 5 unforgivable (!) wireframe sins:
1.	 Wireframes are not a basic sketch.
Often we treat wireframes like a quick and dirty sketch, 
or like step 1 of the design. “Just make a wireframe 
for now!” They aren’t. Wireframes specifically exclude 
design, to show how the site/app will work, not how it 
will look. Those napkin drawings you (and I) make at the 
beginning are important for sorting out our thoughts, but 
they’re not wireframes.
LESSON 58
What Isn’t a Wireframe?
When most people think of UX, they think of the lines-and-
boxes diagrams we call wireframes. Unfortunately, many people 
also think that doing wireframes is the same as doing UX.
Lesson 58: What Isn’t a Wireframe?    129

5.	 Wireframes are not meant for display.
I die a little every time I see wireframes colored blue and 
presented in a stylish way. Immediately I know that the 
people behind those wireframes have no respect for what 
they’re doing: they have not used color with meaning 
(red for warning, etc.), they have tried to pass important 
things by a client/
boss by making 
them prettier, 
and they have 
put the focus 
on the “look-
and-feel” in a 
document that 
is primarily 
for technical 
purposes. 
Making a 
wireframe 
look like a 
blueprint is the 
equivalent of 
using Comic 
Sans to write 
a contract.
isn’t solved, isn’t organized, won’t work, will be hard 
to use, or is missing. If you can’t start to build, the 
wireframes are a work in progress. Don’t be afraid to 
say that to a client or your manager! Making decisions 
based on half-ready wireframes is a nightmare waiting to 
happen. I say this from experience.
4.	 Wireframes should be taken seriously.
I have watched people move a printed wireframe (on 
paper) from one section of a site to another because it 
“feels” better. I have seen a 70-page set of wireframes 
for a social network that didn’t have a profile page 
(designed by one of the top ad agencies in the world!). 
I have seen user-generated content that cannot be 
generated anywhere. I have seen a client cross out 
a “register now” button because it’s “ugly” in the 
wireframe. I have seen a site designed and launched by a 
global agency without a main menu (you thought I was 
joking when I said that, didn’t you?).
These might or might not seem like a big deal, but each 
is an example of a crippling mistake that could destroy a 
product or service.
Plan enough time for wireframes—especially in large 
projects. Label and describe (i.e., annotate) each element 
of each page so a developer never has to ask you what a 
button is supposed to do.
130   
Wireframes and Prototypes

I have designed entire social networks that are responsive, in 
a web-based drawing tool. I have designed iPad apps with 
six-figure budgets in Keynote. I have designed a website for a 
leading cable television channel, completely in Illustrator.
All without complaints.
My advice: find and use the simplest tool that can handle the 
project and make files that your team can share easily and 
cheaply.
They’re wireframes, not the Mona Lisa.
A lot of designers are surprised when I tell them that I use 
Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Apple Keynote to do wireframes 
(unless the project is really complex).
I have used Omnigraffle, Mockflow, Balsamiq, and a variety of 
other software options, which might or might not have been 
intended for wireframes, and to be honest, I think most of 
them are too complicated, most of the time.
Different Tools Work in 
Different Situations
If you’re making a very complex site with a lot of different 
content, like a giant, international corporate intranet for a 
company with tens of thousands of employees, then you 
might need a powerful tool.
But for most projects, those tools might be overkill.
LESSON 59
Learn Skills, Not Tools
One of the most common questions in UX is “What is the best 
wireframing tool?” But when you get good at wireframing, you 
will realize that the answer to that question is: the simplest one.
Lesson 59: Learn Skills, Not Tools    131

My first recommendation to all new UX designers is to use 
a pencil and paper for wireframing until you need to be so 
specific and technically accurate that something digital is 
required.
Sketch quickly, make rough drawings of your ideas, try 10 
different versions, sort out your layouts and ideas, decide on 
something, and then jump onto your computer to make a 
formal document.
Design the Best Solution, Not the 
Solution the Tool Can Design
No matter what type of design you do, you should always 
make sure you are doing the design based on the solution you 
need, not based on the features you have in your software.
Always design what you want first, and then use wireframes 
to make it into a technical document. If you start solving 
problems with a blank wireframing tool, you’re screwed 
before you start.
Often a pencil and paper is the best wireframing tool.

Wireframes and Prototypes

Pinterest, people regularly “skip” the description by typing a 
single period. If you need users to click that text to navigate, 
they are now trying to click a single period.
How Long Can It Be?
This is the more common mistake when designing: to forget 
the really long possibilities.
In 1999, singer/songwriter Fiona Apple’s second album title 
was an entire poem. I have seen a trademarked company 
name that is 40 words long. I have seen a blog where the 
whole post is in the title and the “body text” is always blank.
If you’re designing a music site, or a trademark list, or a blog 
template, would those behaviors still work, or would your 
design break?
If your design works well for 90% of users, it’s broken.
In my experience, conversations about UX design focus on the 
way you want users to use your stuff, not the way they could 
use it. That’s dangerous.
If you hear yourself saying things like, “Most headlines will 
probably fit on one line,” or “Users probably won’t have more 
than a thousand friends anyway,” or “Most of our users will 
probably use their face as a profile picture,” you’re creating 
opportunities for failure.
How Short Can It Be?
What if someone choses a period as a title? Or leaves it 
blank? Or makes a one-word description? Or, what if their 
whole blog is just single word posts? 
It is tempting to imagine everybody doing normal things, but 
people are creative and weird. Maybe they are writing articles 
about punctuation or maybe they run a “word of the day” 
blog, or maybe they don’t need one of your features. On 
LESSON 60
Avoid Convenient Examples
One of the most common design mistakes is to forget about 
less common user behavior. If you only use ideal content in 
your wireframes, your design might break in real life.
Lesson 60: Avoid Convenient Examples    133

the button that lets them delete the post, or add an ellipsis 
(the three periods at the end) when it gets too long (that’s 
called truncating!), or add a little note if the user edits the 
original content so other people know it changed.
And test your design with a lot of ugly, unusual images! You’ll 
thank me when the Naked Ninja Association creates their 
account.
What If It Doesn’t Exist?
It is surprisingly common to forget the “empty state” of a 
design. What does the page look like if a user hasn’t posted 
anything yet? Don’t just let it be empty; design what it looks 
like if it is empty.
What If Someone Deletes It?
The more difficult version of “empty” is “deleted.” On Reddit, 
a user can post a comment, and other users can reply to it, 
and then the original user can delete the first comment 
in the conversation.
What would happen in your design if 
something like that happened? What if 
someone has shared a link to some­
thing that is deleted? What does 
the user see when they visit 
that link?
What’s the Worst 
That Can Happen?
Don’t ask yourself what most 
users will do. That’s the easy part. 
Ask yourself how a user could 
abuse your design the most. Limit 
the number of characters they can 
type, or design it so it looks ok with 
only a title, or no title, or take away

Wireframes and Prototypes

Now, there are hundreds of design patterns, and they are 
changing all the time as devices and technologies evolve, so I 
can’t really make you a full list. But if you google “UI design 
patterns,” you will find many sites that collect common solu­
tions (whether they are good or not).
A design is not necessarily good just because it’s 
common. To be a “good” design pattern, a solution 
must be common and usable.
Some design ideas become popular because they allow lazy 
UI designers to ignore a challenging feature. It’s like putting a 
bag over someone’s head because they are ugly.
For example: Facebook’s “hamburger” button—which 
represents the hidden menu in many mobile apps—has 
started appearing on full-size websites that have plenty of 
space for a menu. It’s common because hiding the menu is 
easier than designing a nice one, not because the results are 
better.
In real life, many users don’t notice the hidden “hamburger” 
menu button at all, and they leave the site or get lost.
That’s bad.
And lazy.
“Don’t do it, bitch.”—Jesse Pinkman.
LESSON 61
What Is a Design Pattern?
When many designers have the same challenge and 
someone solves it in an elegant way, and many designers 
use that solution, it is called a design pattern.
Lesson 61: What Is a Design Pattern?    135

The reason I spent so much time teaching you visual design 
principles is so you would know how you can make this layout 
better.
Aha!
If we add a bigger head­
line (visual weight), create 
one column to follow (line 
tension), and use smaller 
sections (repetition), we 
can get people closer to 
the famous F-Pattern.
“Scanning” means the user only stops to read when some­
thing catches their eye. This lesson is about scanning patterns.
Using a website or an app may feel like a different experience 
every time, but in fact, the way people look at any design is 
fairly predictable.
The Z-Pattern
Let’s start with the most boring design I can imagine: an 
entire newspaper page of solid text. All one story. No head­
lines. No images. No breaks or pull quotes; just text, in even 
columns, from corner to corner.
In a design like that—which I hope you never create—users 
will generally scan it in a pattern something like a “Z,” start­
ing in the upper left and ending in the lower right. Anything 
in the layout that isn’t near the Z probably won’t be noticed.
Boring! Zzzzzzzz…. (see what I did there?)
LESSON 62
Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Visual Hierarchy
It is easy to imagine every user excitedly reading 
every letter you write and every pixel you make. Get 
over it, because real users won’t. They scan.
136   
Wireframes and Prototypes

F-Pattern
Similar layouts = similar scanning pattern. Google results 
make a great F-Pattern if you track the eye movements of 
users.
The F-Pattern made the founders of the Nielsen Norman 
Group famous a while back. They still maintain a very good 
blog and publish many reports worth reading.
The F-Pattern works like this:
1.	 Start in the upper-left corner, like the Z-Pattern.
2.	 Read/scan the first (head)line of the text.
3.	 Scan down the left side of the column until you find 
something interesting.
4.	 Read the interesting thing more carefully.
5.	 Continue scanning down.
6.	 By repeating that method over and over, the scanning 
pattern starts to look like an “E” or an “F,” hence the 
name.
Lesson 62: Z-Pattern, F-Pattern, Visual Hierarchy    137

Create a Visual Hierarchy
When you consistently use typography to indicate the impor­
tance of text, and certain colors to highlight buttons, and 
when you give more visual weight to things that matter, it 
creates a visual hierarchy (i.e.,a design that people can scan 
easily). Our eyes jump from important thing to important 
thing rather than scanning like a robot.
Some designers think visual hierarchy is good because it looks 
better, but the truth is that it feels better because it is easier 
to scan.
Why Is This Important?
You might notice that some parts of the page get lots of 
attention “naturally,” whereas other parts of the page 
are overlooked most of the time. This is what is meant by 
“strong” and “weak” spots in a layout.
A button in the upper left will get more clicks than a button in 
the upper right, which will get more clicks than a button in the 
lower left, which will get more clicks than a button in the lower 
right. And all of those will get more clicks than something 
randomly stuck in the middle, unless you do something about 
it.
It might also be good to know that each “block” of content 
and each column can have their own F-Pattern. It doesn’t 
have to be one-F-Pattern-per-page, but that is a more 
advanced conversation for another day.
138   
Wireframes and Prototypes

Ask yourself: “Are there going to be any pages that have an 
infinite scroll?” If the answer is yes, make sure everything in 
the footer is available somewhere else. If the language selec­
tor is in the footer and it runs away every time I try to change 
it, fuck you.
Navigation
Menus come in at least two flavors: main menu and 
submenu.
Main Menu
If you did your information architecture properly, then you 
already know what should be in the main menu. It’s the 
first level of links in your site map (below the home page).
The order of the menu items—left-to-right or top-
to-bottom—should be from most-to-least popular 
(measured by user interest, not by how much you like 
them).
Although it might be tempting to approach your wireframes 
on a page-by-page basis, don’t do it!
If you’re building a house, you don’t start with the rooms 
and furniture. You start with the walls. This is one of those 
“measure twice, cut once” kind of things. As a general rule, 
you should do your wireframes like you do your tattoos: start 
with the big parts, then fill in the details. In this case the big 
parts are the elements that will appear on all of the pages: 
navigation and footers.
Footers
A footer is typically a list of static links that are too general 
and too insignificant to get a place in the main navigation. 
Some sites actually have really nice footer designs, which is 
great, but if users need those links to make the site work, the 
footer is the wrong place for them.
LESSON 63
Layout: Page Framework
Now that you’ve established your goals, researched 
your users, and planned your information architecture, 
it’s time to put those plans into action!
Lesson 63: Layout: Page Framework    139

Menus are like dating: if you need more than seven or eight 
choices, it’s time to break somebody’s heart—maybe your 
own.
tl;dr
Create navigation and footers that work for all of the pages/
screens in your app before you get into content. You’ll thank 
me later.
If this is a brand new menu just make 
your best guess, and tell the developers 
that you want it to be easy to re-order 
them later. When you get some real 
traffic to your site, make sure your order 
and the real popularity match. If they 
don’t, fix it.
Submenu
The submenu is a list of the pages in 
your site map “below” whatever page 
the user is on. You did make a site map, 
right?! Phew. Good. You had me scared 
for a second there.
The main thing with the submenu is that 
it should ideally be in the same place 
on every page, even if the links change 
all the time. That way, users will quickly 
learn where to find it.
Huge Submenus Are 
Never a Good Idea
I am always surprised when someone tries to argue that their 
mega-menu is the best idea available. That actually means 
the Information Architecture (and the information architect) 
sucks.
Everything-in-one-menu is the laziest design in the universe. 
Do better.

Wireframes and Prototypes

Images
Many UX designers treat images as if they are not functional, 
but images can lead the user’s eyes, so you should think 
about them.
Images of people, specifically, draw more attention than 
anything else you can use in your layout. As a general guide­
line, the more emotion an image adds, the more engaging it 
is.
The Fold
One of the most popular old-school misconceptions is about 
“the fold.” In case you’ve never heard of it, this is the part of 
your design that is visible before the user scrolls. Everything 
above the fold will get maximum visibility. However, from the 
studies I have seen, 60 to 80% of users will scroll immediately 
if they expect to find something useful below the fold.
Whatever is above the fold should inform users about what is 
below the fold. If user’s don’t know what is down there, they 
might not be interested enough to find out.
Careful: It is popular right now to use huge background 
images at the top of the page. If it looks like the site ends at 
the fold, people might leave instead of scrolling. And if you 
need to add a graphic that says “scroll down,” your design is 
weak.

LESSON 64
Layout: The Fold, Images, and Headlines
There are many common questions about UX design 
that you will get throughout your career. And some 
that you should get, even though you won’t.
Lesson 64: Layout: The Fold, Images, and Headlines    141

•	 Choose images that add emotion and direct the user’s 
eyes.
•	 Use headlines to direct users to what matters most.
PROTIP
For images of people, try to get the eyes of the person in 
the image to look in the direction you want the user to look. 
It’s shocking how much difference it makes.
Headlines
Other than pictures of people, our eyes are 
most attracted to the largest, highest-con­
trast piece of text in a layout. So when 
you add a big headline to your design, 
you have just chosen where people will 
begin scanning.
Therefore, it is important that your 
headline is aligned with the most 
important content below it. If that 
content is not very important, you will 
draw too much attention to it (and 
away from other content.) If it is not 
aligned, users will look for a new focus 
point after they read the headline.
tl;dr
•	 Give people something 
to focus on before they 
scroll.
•	 Make it obvious that 
they can scroll.
142   
Wireframes and Prototypes

Find the Edges
In every design, you will use the visual principles you learned 
in this course. When you step back and look at your layout, 
you will notice that you have created “lines” or “edges” or 
“blocks” everywhere.
They might be the aligned edge of the text, or your images, 
or groups of things in a row. Each of those edges is an Axis of 
Interaction. Your eyes will follow an Axis until it is interrupted 
or until it ends. Your user’s attention is almost always focused 
on an Axis of Interaction, and when they stop focusing there, 
they will hop to the next Axis of Interaction.
Therefore, if you want people to click something, put it on (or 
near) an Axis of Interaction. If you don’t want them to click 
it, put it somewhere else. The farther an element is from the 
Axis, the less people will see it, and if you don’t see some­
thing, you can’t click it.
This idea is deceptively simple.
Human attention is very limited. We can only focus on one 
thing at a time, like a squirrel, or Duck Dynasty, or a skimpy 
swimsuit. So while we’re focusing on one chunk of content, 
the other chunks of content effectively become invisible.
Don’t believe me? See if you can pass this Selective Attention 
test.
FUN FAC T
In photos of a man and woman in skimpy swimsuits, 
eye-tracking studies show that women will look at the 
woman’s breasts more than men, and men will look at the 
man’s crotch more than women. It’s not about being sexy, 
it’s about checking out the competition in nature.
LESSON 65
Layout: The Axis of Interaction
One of the most common questions in UX design is “Should the 
button be on the left or the right?” Well, it depends, actually. 
It depends on where you have created visual “edges.”
Lesson 65: Layout: The Axis of Interaction    143

Wireframes and Prototypes

Input Types
The purpose of a form is to get input (i.e., information from 
the user). And there are a number of ways you can collect 
it. Whether you use a standard text field or a super-custom 
slider, you should choose the input type that gives you the 
highest quality answers.
For example, let’s say you want the user to pick their favorite 
type of goat. Checkboxes and radio buttons are both ways 
to let the user pick from a list of options. However, check­
boxes allow them to choose more than one option, and radio 
buttons only allow one selection.
List of different form input types: http://www.w3schools.
com/htmL/html_form_input_types.asp
If they aren’t one of the most valuable parts of your design, 
why are you using a form? Did I mention that they cause 
confusion, mistakes, and loss of engagement?
One Long Page or a Few Short Pages?
The most common question with regard to forms—from UX 
designers and marketers alike—is “How long is too long?”
It is a good general rule to keep forms as short as possible, 
but don’t be afraid to break it into pages if it makes sense, 
or if you want to save the input in steps just in case the user 
quits in the middle. The main thing is to make a form feel 
simple. Keep related questions together; eliminate questions 
you don’t really need; and use as many pages as you need, no 
more, no less.
LESSON 66
Forms
As you work through your designs, it is only a matter of time until 
you have to design a way for users to give you information. Forms 
are one of the places you will spend a lot of your time, usability-
wise. They cause confusion, mistakes, and loss of engagement, 
and they are one of the most valuable parts of your site.
Lesson 66: Forms    145

You can prevent mistakes by adding some intelligence to 
the inputs. For example, if a text field is for phone numbers, 
make the form smart enough to handle the structure 
(000) 000-0000 and 000 000 0000, or 0000000000, or 
000.000.0000. (Talk to your developers about this.)
Giving users an example of the input you expect can also 
reduce errors. It can be directly in a text field, for example, or 
part of your instructions.
When users miss a question or make a mistake, you should 
alert them so they can fix it. If it is a question that you can 
verify, you can show a check mark or an “X” to indicate 
whether it is correct or incorrect. This is called inline error 
handling. Password fields also use the inline method to indi­
cate if the password is weak or strong as you type.
Do not use inline error handling if you can’t verify the input, 
like when people type their name (i.e., you never know if a 
name is “correct.”)
When the user clicks “next” or “done,” you can check the 
form for missed questions or mistakes. If there is a problem, 
make it visually obvious which ones they missed and why they 
are wrong.
PROTIP
Make sure the user can see the error from the bottom of the 
form! If they have to scroll up to find out what happened, 
they won’t.
List of different breeds of goats: https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/List_of_goat_breeds
If you want a more complete answer from the user, use 
checkboxes. If you want a more selective answer, radio 
buttons might be your thing.
Labels and Instructions
When you’re labeling your inputs—how else will the user 
know what to do with them?—be short, clear, legible, and 
put the labels close to the input. In the grand scheme of 
things, that will solve 99% of labeling problems.
Sometimes instructions are needed if the question is uncon­
ventional or complicated. In that case, it can be helpful to add 
a little explanation. If it’s only a few words, put it near the 
label and the input. If it’s more than a few words, put it on 
the side of the form instead of within it so it doesn’t interrupt 
the flow of users who know what they’re doing.
For more on this, I highly recommend the book Web Form 
Design, by Luke W.
Preventing and 
Handling Mistakes
When it comes to forms, mistakes happen. It’s your job to 
prevent as many as possible and handle the rest as gracefully 
as you can.
146   
Wireframes and Prototypes

For most forms, put the “done” button on the left, on the 
Axis of Interaction. If the form will do something really 
destructive or critical, put it on the right so people pause to 
look for it instead of clicking it by reflex.
Phew, that was a lot for one lesson! Good work!
Speed versus Mistakes
This is a little advanced, but super useful:
Are you asking really common questions like “name” and 
“email,” or more unusual ones like “what’s your favorite type 
of velvet artwork?”
For common questions, a form with labels that are left-
aligned and above the input will get users through it as fast 
as possible. It keeps everything on the Axis of Interaction. For 
uncommon or complex questions, a form with labels to the 
left of the input (on the same row) will slow users down a 
little, but result in fewer errors.
Lesson 66: Forms    147

1.	 Primary Actions that are helpful to our goals.
2.	 Secondary Actions that are not.
This example shows two button examples (don’t tap them). 
As a general guideline, you will need only two button styles 
because most user actions fall into one of two categories:
LESSON 67
Primary and Secondary Buttons
Users can click or tap many things in your design. Some of 
those actions are helpful to your goals, and some aren’t.
148   
Wireframes and Prototypes

Secondary style
Low contrast compared to the background (a similar color 
or shade).
Position in layout
Away from the Axis of Interaction so users notice them 
only when they are looking for them.
Importance Is a BIG Exception
Sometimes counterproductive actions are important, like 
deleting your account. Those actions should get a primary 
style but secondary position in the layout. The reason is that 
we want the user to find it, but we want them to think about 
their action before doing it. It is also a good idea to give this 
button a warning color that indicates the importance of the 
action (red, orange, yellow, etc.).
Special Buttons
In some cases, you will have one type of action that is unique 
to your site or app, which requires special focus. Design a 
special button for this so it stands out in your design (pattern 
breaking).
Amazon’s “One-Click Purchase” buttons, Pinterest’s “Pin it” 
button, and Facebook’s good ol’ thumbs-up “Like” button all 
got this treatment (more or less).
Primary Buttons
Some actions that are available to the user are productive, 
like registering, buying, submitting content, saving, sending, 
sharing, and so on. They produce things that didn’t exist 
before. Those are primary actions, or things that we want the 
user to do as often as possible.
Buttons that execute primary actions—primary buttons—
should be as visible as possible. We do that by using the 
principles we learned earlier in the course.
Primary style
High contrast compared to the background (very different 
color or shade).
Position in layout
On or near the Axis of Interaction so users notice them 
first, by reflex.
Secondary Buttons
Some actions that are available to the user are counterproduc­
tive, like canceling, skipping, resetting, declining an offer, and 
so on. They remove or stop the creation of new things. Those 
are secondary actions, or things we don’t want the user to do, 
but we provide the option for the sake of usability.
Therefore, buttons that execute secondary options—second­
ary buttons—should be less visible, to prevent accidental or 
“reflexive” clicks.
Lesson 67: Primary and Secondary Buttons    149

Responsive Design Is One 
Design That Fits All Screens
Responsive design “stretches” and “adjusts” as you change 
the size of the window, so no matter what device you’re using 
or what resolution your screen has, it works perfectly.
How does this magical responsiveness occur, you say? Well, 
it’s all about “break points.”
One layout can’t stretch forever and still look good, so you 
have to decide when to show or hide some features and how 
far you want something to stretch before it will “break” and 
change to a layout that will show things better at that size. 
Then, when a device loads the page, or the window changes 
size, the site adjusts automatically, providing an orgasmically 
perfect experience to everybody.
There is no way to cover all the aspects of responsive design 
in a short lesson like this, but as you get deeper into UX, it is 
worth reading more about it.
Adaptive Design Is Really Just a 
Couple of Different Designs
A lot of beginner designers are confused between adaptive and 
responsive design terminology, but it’s actually pretty simple.
Adaptive design is a few different designs; one for each of 
the device types you think are important. For example, if you 
have a webshop and you have customers visiting on mobile 
and desktop web, then you might design a small phone-sized 
verison, and a bigger desktop version. If someone visits on a 
phone, they see the small one, and if they visit on a bigger 
screen, they see the big one.
That’s it.
Adaptive design takes less time and it’s easier because it is a 
lot more static than responsive design. Lots of designers will 
post a version of their design for mobile and a version for 
web and call it “responsive,” but in reality they often haven’t 
designed the “in between” states of the design.
LESSON 68
Adaptive and Responsive Design
UX is not one-size-fits-all, so you will eventually find 
yourself trying to fit your giant web design onto any 
number of other, smaller devices. Don’t panic. Adapt.
150   
Wireframes and Prototypes

If users are confused because they often overlook a button, 
you might be able to solve it by changing the button color. If 
users are confused because the structure of your site makes 
as much sense as Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, then 
you might need a bigger change to solve the problem.
Make the Smallest Change 
You Can Make
Sometimes doing everything is simpler than doing one thing. 
When you have a sense of the problem and what it might 
take to solve that problem, don’t look for the biggest, coolest 
way to solve it. Look for the minimum number of changes you 
can make that will get the job done.
For example, let’s say your menu is confusing. If you can solve 
the problem by making the menu labels more clear, then do 
that. Changing text is easy to do and easy to test. If that isn’t 
enough, maybe you can add some cross-links within the site 
so users can easily find what they want, even when they navi­
gate to the wrong page. No problem.
Sometimes a new design from scratch is the obvious choice. 
Like when your company still uses its site from 1998, and that 
multicolored, animated unicorn background just doesn’t say 
professionalism like it used to.
Sometimes an improvement to the old design is the obvious 
choice. Like when the designers update the brand accent 
color from a nice forest green to a fresh, minty green, but all 
the features stay the same.
No brainers.
But what about when the site is two years old, and several 
users have mentioned that Thing A and Thing B aren’t quite 
as good as your competitors? Not so obvious.
Define the Problem First
If you don’t know what you’re solving, you don’t know how 
to solve it. So, first, decide exactly what result you’re aiming 
for, and think about how far your current design is from doing 
that.
LESSON 69
To Design or Redesign?
It is only a matter of time before you have to choose between 
improving the thing that exists or creating something new.
Lesson 69: To Design or Redesign?    151

Sometimes the Best Redesign Is Less
Adding features isn’t always the right choice. It is always 
worth asking yourself if you can solve a problem by taking 
things away. Maybe your navigation is confusing because 
there are too many options that nobody cares about. Maybe 
you have given the users so much content that the page is 
hard to scan. Maybe you offer so many features that it’s too 
much to learn, so nobody stays long enough to understand it!
And maybe you can automate a bunch of things to make the 
user’s job simpler, even if that means making your job more 
complicated. When it comes to interfaces, less is usually more.
Or, if that isn’t enough, maybe you can redesign the home 
page so it provides obvious shortcuts to the popular stuff that 
is a bit hard to find. 
Or, if that isn’t enough, maybe you can move/combine a 
couple pages so they exist where the users expect to find 
them.
But…
If your code is really old or it’s built on a shitty Content 
Management System, or if other big things need to be 
changed at the same time, or if your company wants to make 
money in a different way… all of the previously described 
redesigns might be more difficult than just throwing the 
whole site in the garbagio (that’s Italian for garbage…proba­
bly) and starting from scratch.
A new design from scratch takes away all the baggage of the 
old design, but it means that you have to be more careful 
about using all of the existing data and managing expecta­
tions. If Facebook had a totally different design tomorrow, 
everybody would be pissed off, even if the new design is 
better. Either way, remember to help the users learn the new 
design!

Wireframes and Prototypes

Ability to hover
A mouse pointer is like Samuel L. Jackson: always on 
screen. And the computer knows where it is. The best 
advantage of a mouse is that it can cause changes 
without clicking. When the user positions the pointer 
“over” a button or a menu (i.e., hovering), the interface 
can change color or reveal options that they didn’t even 
know about—that’s called discovery.
Selects items easily
A mouse can click small areas, between individual letters, 
or click-and-drag to select a specific area. This is also a 
big advantage over fingers, which block our view and 
scroll the screen when we “touch and drag.” The mouse 
pointer, therefore, is much better (or faster) when it 
comes to working with text and image editing, which 
require careful selections, or when working with games 
that require precision.
A Mouse Has Some 
Advantages Over a Finger
A mouse pointer (the little arrow) is an extension of your hand 
that lives on the screen, allowing you to interact with a bigger 
screen without even being near it. 
Small and accurate
Since a mouse pointer isn’t a physical “thing,” it can be 
any size we want (in theory). In this case, smaller means 
more accurate. A mouse can actually select a single pixel, 
although one-pixel buttons are not recommended. But 
if you want to do something that requires fine control 
or lots of detail, like Photoshopping Justin Bieber in an 
underwear ad, then a mouse will perform better.
LESSON 70
Touch versus Mouse
The psychology of any interface might be the 
same, but the practical details can be very different 
depending on what the device itself can do.
Lesson 70: Touch versus Mouse    153

Wireframes and Prototypes

Built-in feedback
Your fingers have nerves in them, which tell your brain 
when they touch something. When your finger is 
touching the screen, you don’t need visual feedback to 
confirm it. That being said, visual feedback is still a good 
idea. In the very near future though, devices will probably 
give you haptic feedback that you can feel with your 
fingers!
Direct-to-interface
Instead of reaching for the mouse when you want to click 
the button, you reach for the button. That might sound 
small, but it means much less work for your brain.
Creates a physical orientation
The direct connection to your interface means people 
start assuming that a lot of real-world physical properties 
apply. Want to make something bigger? Stretch it. 
Smaller? Pinch it. Move it up? Put your finger on it and 
slide it up. You might not have realized that scrolling 
“down” on a screen means moving the content “up” in 
the real world. Touch devices change this, making “up” 
mean up and “down” mean down.
Always available
On a touch screen you type and click and select with 
the same thing: your finger! You also know where your 
finger is when you’re not using it, so it never gets lost. 
Hopefully.
Hidden options/navigation
Using the right mouse button (or a Cmd-click on Mac) in 
most software and some websites will display a menu or 
advanced options. This can allow you to design common 
shortcuts into the mouse pointer itself instead of showing 
them on the screen. And everything on the screen can 
have a different right-click menu. Some touch-based apps 
have a touch-and-hold concept that is similar, but it is 
slower and less obvious.
Can change shape
Unlike a finger, the mouse pointer can look like anything 
you want! An arrow, a hand, an icon, a cute little baby 
pig, and so on. When the cursor changes, it tells the user 
what will happen if the user clicks, like when the pointer 
becomes a hand over a link (a touch metaphor!). A lot 
of software takes advantage of this to provide rich visual 
feedback.
Your Finger Has Some 
Advantages Over a Mouse
Most people have 10 of these bad boys, and they have been 
designed by a natural process called evolution, which tends 
to be rather good at designing tools. Here are some of the 
benefits of your trusty ol’ fingers:
Lesson 70: Touch versus Mouse    155

Fully trained right out of the box
By the time you’re about four years old, you have 
conquered the basics of motor skills, and that is proven 
by the fact that little kids can use an iPhone just as well as 
some adults. If you watch those same kids use a mouse 
you will notice that it is less comfortable, and they might 
look at the mouse sometimes to stay oriented.
Gestures and multitouch
Gesturing with your hands is part of every conversation 
ever (assuming you have functional hands), so when we 
have to do a swipe or pinch, it’s no problem. Sometimes 
we have to teach people what gesture to use, though, 
so be careful about using crazy or complicated ones. If 
you need to do something a little more complex, a better 
choice might be a multitouch gesture, which is when you 
use more than one finger.

Psychology of Usability

One of the most common myths in UX is that good usability is 
more pleasing to the eye.
It is impossible for something to “look usable.” If someone 
says that about your design, ignore it.
When users are surveyed about which design is “most 
usable,” their opinions are more related to the beauty than 
the effectiveness. This means we can’t trust user opinions 
about how usable a design is.
Usability is measured by what people do:
•	 If more people buy something in an uglier design, it is 
more usable.
•	 If people read more in an uglier design, it is more usable.
•	 If more people register via the uglier design, it is more 
usable.
Sometimes you will be forced to choose between beauty and 
usability. Always choose usability.
Usability = Cognitive Load
Cognitive load is the amount of processing power that is 
required to complete any little thing we make a user’s brain 
do. For example:
•	 It takes less work to continue what you’re doing than to 
do something different.
•	 It takes less work to find something again than it did to 
find it the first time.
•	 It takes less work to read simple words than to read com­
plicated words.
•	 It takes less work to agree than it does to complain.
Every detail in your design (and in your life) should reduce the 
amount of cognitive load between the user (or yourself) and 
positive goals.
Usability is every detail, every moment, every time.
LESSON 71
What Is Usability, Really?
Your design will affect how much the user must think to get 
the job done. If you made a scale that goes from “no thinking” 
to “thinking hard,” that would be a usability scale.
158   
Psychology of Usability

AS A UX DESIGNER
It is your job to use psychology—and confirm it with 
tests—even if it makes something a little uglier. That being 
said, don’t do anything because it’s ugly. That’s just dumb. 
Ugliness doesn’t guarantee usability either.
Don’t Ignore Beauty!
Beauty is not irrelevant in UX. It is easy and fast to decide 
that you like the way something looks. That can lead to 
quick downloads, instant trust, and more persuasive designs. 
Beauty cannot make something more usable, but it can make 
users feel like it is more 
usable, and that is import­
ant, too.
In UX, your job is to test, 
measure, and research that 
beauty, not to create it.
Over the next few lessons 
you will learn some of the 
psychological factors that 
increase usability but might 
not affect the way some­
thing looks to an outsider. 
Lesson 71: What Is Usability, Really?    159

•	 Detect information, like the type of credit card, instead of 
asking for it. 
•	 Automatically format answers properly, like a phone num­
ber, instead of asking for it in several chunks (or using 
errors).
The disadvantage with simplification is that it might collect 
less information or take more time to build. And if you 
don’t confirm that email address, a typo can ruin the whole 
registration.
Easier: More Obvious Steps
It is almost always possible to make a question more obvious. 
Just pretend you’re designing for one of the guys from Duck 
Dynasty.
You could:
•	 Let them choose their country from a list instead of ask­
ing them to type it.
A word you might hear in UX is: heuristics. A heuristic is an 
approach or a strategy for solving a problem. Let’s say you 
want to get more people to finish a process with many steps. 
Like a checkout, or a registration, or getting through the 
body-scanners at the airport.
(i.e., You want to increase conversion.)
Below are four ways you could think about it (heuristics), each 
with their own advantages and disadvantages.
Simpler: Fewer Steps
It’s only a matter of time, as a UX designer, before someone 
brings you a seven-page registration flow that needs to be 
simplified.
You could: 
•	 Remove any questions that aren’t necessary, like confirm­
ing your email address. 
LESSON 72
Simple, Easy, Fast, or Minimal
UX designers are always trying to make functions better and nicer for 
the user. But in different situations, that means different approaches. 
So let’s compare four different ways of thinking about usability.
160   
Psychology of Usability

Minimal: Fewer Functions
Many designers believe minimalism is about flat design, or 
hiding your options in a hidden menu. It definitely is not.
Minimalism is about doing less, better. In theory, minimal­
ism makes a design simpler, easier, and faster. For example, 
Outlook is an email app with a lot of features like an address 
book, a full-featured calendar, meeting reminders, and differ­
ent ways to sort your inbox. It is not minimal. It may be more 
powerful, but it is also harder to learn.
Sparrow, on the other hand, is an email app that allows you 
to send, receive, forward, delete, and put emails in folders—
and that’s basically it. It is very popular and easier to learn but 
not as powerful.
Minimalism often requires a redesign from the ground up, 
and although it makes the fundamentals of your product 
better, it might not be enough for power users.
A Mix of Strategies Is Usually Best
To choose heuristics that are best for you, interview users to 
learn about their mental strategies, ask the “stakeholders” in 
your company about their needs, and always A/B–test your 
choices to confirm that they are better.
•	 Add super-clear instructions for every question, including 
questions like “Your name.”
•	 Break complex questions into more steps so each step is 
easier to understand.
The disadvantage with making things more obvious is that it 
often creates more questions or more reading for the user, 
which works against your simplification.
Faster: Less Time to Complete/
Repeat the Process
Often, the process itself is something the user has done many 
times before, or they will do it many times in the future. Over 
time, making it faster can improve your conversion a lot.
You could:
•	 Let them save their address and autocomplete it for them 
next time.
•	 Choose popular defaults so most people don’t have to 
change anything.
•	 Make shortcuts like Amazon’s one-click purchase for peo­
ple who are logged in.
The disadvantage with designing for speed is that you make 
the process less flexible—changes mean slowing down—and 
mistakes are easy to overlook while you’re click, click, clicking 
your way to the end.
Lesson 72: Simple, Easy, Fast, or Minimal    161

you’re dreaming of the day when your life will finally be com­
pleted by a $2,000 watch, you are browsing.
A browsing user will glance quickly at most of the images, 
one by one, starting at the upper left. She might skip some, 
but that’s ok. Photos that the user finds attractive will get 
extra attention (maybe even a click!).
To design for browsing: Make scanning easy and keep the 
content quick and visual. Don’t overcrowd the page with too 
much shit. Focus on the aspects of the products that create 
emotional appeal. If that’s style, focus on photos. If that is 
power (like boat engines or guns) then provide that info as 
clear labels. If that is brand names, clearly show the logos. If it 
is craftsmanship, magnify the handcrafted details. And so on.
Searching
When someone is trying to find something they have in mind, 
it might seem similar to browsing, but eye-tracking studies 
show a very different behavior: they are hunting. A searching 
user will ignore a lot of products or pictures. Organization in 
This can mean a variety of things in the real world, so for the 
purposes of this lesson, let’s clarify:
Browsing
This is when you go to Ikea to look at all the model rooms 
“just to get ideas,” and you probably walk out with a 
bunch of random crap anyway.
Searching
Searching is when you go to Ikea looking for a new sofa 
that will fit in your absurdly small apartment.
Discovery
This is when you find the sofa you’re looking for and also 
buy the clever little nested end-tables from the same 
showroom, because they are so damn clever and nested. 
As if those are things you need in your life.
Browsing
When you visit an online store just because their products 
look nice or because you’re following trends, or because 
LESSON 73
Browsing, Searching, or Discovery
Different people use sites and apps for different reasons. If you 
design for the wrong behavior, you won’t get the results you want.
162   
Psychology of Usability

Both of those things are wrong.
Mistake 1: Users only click things in the menu if they are 
looking for those things. Simple as that. Almost nobody 
“discovers” via the menu. And banners don’t work because 
banners never work. Haven’t you ever used the Internet 
before? Why would people suddenly get excited about 
banners now?
Mistake 2: The more experienced a user is, the less they 
explore for new things. In real life, only beginners explore sites 
or apps to find out what it can do. Experienced users know 
what they want and they know how to get it, so why would 
they explore?
“If you liked that, you’re gonna love this…”
Instead of relying on users to find new things, let them find 
what they are already looking for. Put the new stuff there, 
too, (and make it relevant) so they can “discover” it. This 
might feel like you’re hiding it, but really you’re making it as 
visible as possible to the right people.
On a site like Reddit, people come for the top-voted content, 
not new submissions. But if nobody votes on new submis­
sions, there will be no top-voted content! So, Reddit puts a 
few new submissions—from the categories you like—into the 
top content so they become visible, get votes, and start the 
Circle of Life once again.
The more you understand your users, the more you will know 
what to design for. Do your damn research!
your layout will help them systematically work through the 
options; they don’t want to miss any! A Pinterest-style layout 
works against them because it is “staggered” and random. 
But being able to “filter” the options is often useful.
To design for searching: Focus on attributes. If users want a 
restaurant with a certain price range and style, they will stop 
at every option that seems to have those qualities. Highlight 
the attributes that are most likely to be “critical” for most 
users, and nothing more. Ignore any ideas you might have 
about what looks “cluttered”; if the information is useful, it 
isn’t “clutter.” This isn’t an art gallery.
When the user finds what they want, they will click for more 
information (or buy). A restaurant’s menu, photos, and prices 
might be major points of interest, but the number of seats or 
name of the sous-chef, not so much.
Discovery
Ok, so let’s say your users aren’t finding your amazing selec­
tion of antique kazoos, but you think they would buy them 
if they did. How do you create discovery? The way you think 
people discover new things is probably the opposite of how 
people actually discover new things. Welcome to the wacky 
world of UX.
There are two mistakes you will probably make:
1.	 You will put it in the main menu or create “banners” on 
your own site promoting it.
2.	 You will expect your most loyal users to find it first because 
they spend the most time with your current design.
Lesson 73: Browsing, Searching, or Discovery    163

But…
Consistency Is a Tool, Not a Rule
If someone slaps you in the face, you will flinch the next time 
she raises her hand. You expect her to do it again. If you want 
the user to expect the same thing, design it the same way. 
But often you don’t want that.
Your app and your website do not have to look exactly the 
same. You click one and swipe the other; differences can com­
municate that difference. One user is very unlikely to use your 
app on an Android phone and an iPhone at the same time, for 
example, so if the features of those devices use slightly different 
approaches, fine! After all, the devices are slightly different.
A landing page, a home page, and a check-out have differ­
ent goals, so don’t worry that they look a bit different. They 
should!
Consistency is the idea that a design looks the same from page 
to page, or device to device, or user to user. And in general, it’s 
a good thing. When I log in this time, I expect a site or an app 
to be the same as last time. It helps me find the menu, navigate 
to things I like, and quickly skip the advertising at the begin­
ning. Branding-wise, it also helps me recognize the company, 
trust the content, and know that I came to the right place.
Patterns Require Consistency
A brain is a pattern-recognition machine. It is designed to expe­
rience something once, and then be better at doing the same 
thing again. That is why the menu should be in the same place 
on every page and screen, colors should indicate warnings and 
importance the same way everywhere, and why next time you 
will not ignore the sock on the doorknob of your parents’ room.
Consistency creates expectations. When the user expects 
something to work a certain way, and it does, that’s good 
usability.
LESSON 74
Consistency and Expectations
Consistency is a way to make learning faster and 
create useful expectations about what comes next. But 
consistency is not automatically good design.
164   
Psychology of Usability

Lesson 74: Consistency and Expectations    165

Good UX
The form should be clear and easy. The “cancel my sub­
scription” button should be somewhere logical (like account 
settings). You should get an email to confirm the cancellation. 
Everything should be easy to read, relevant, and so on.
Bad UX
If you are an unethical designer—which I hate—then you 
could make the form difficult and confusing. You could hide 
the “cancel” button somewhere weird or make it tiny and 
hard to see. And it could “fail” when the user makes a tiny 
mistake, so they have to start from the beginning.
The problem
In real life, bad UX will create fewer cancellations than good 
UX, which is better for the company.
Uh oh. More money for a worse experience? That’s not good.
There is a difference between a bad UX design, and a UX 
design that works against the user. The difference is psychol­
ogy. Anti-UX prevents mistakes and bad decisions by using 
normal UX principles, in the opposite direction.
The Good, The Bad, and The Anti
Let’s say you run a members-only website for clown car 
mechanics. It’s a lot of great content on one tiny site.
Members pay a subscription each month, until they cancel it. 
The price might look small, but you get so much out of it!
You don’t want people to cancel their account, obviously, but 
it is necessary to allow it, obviously. Otherwise, they all might 
repaint their faces with a single tear and a frowny mouth.
Let’s say we’re designing that cancellation process.
LESSON 75
Anti-UX
We are always trying to help our users, but that doesn’t always 
mean agreeing with them. And it would be näive not to realize 
that we have the power to deceive users with UX techniques.
166   
Psychology of Usability

Dirty UX Tricks Hurt Us All
RyanAir is a discount European airline that used to have one 
of the most deceptive websites that I have ever seen.
The new site (as of this writing) is better, but still includes a 
default to pay for extra insurance you don’t need. To unselect 
it, you scroll half way down a list of countries and pick “don’t 
insure me” from the list. It doesn’t make sense and it costs 
you money if you don’t understand.
That’s how you kill trust.
“Don’t do that shit. Ever.”
—R. McDonald, senior VP of clowns
However, there is a solution… 
Anti-UX
Everything from the “good UX” example remains the same. 
Clear and easy. But we’re also going to throw in some psy­
chology to fix “the problem.”
If your marketing department wants to know why the user is 
cancelling, put it in the form. A bunch of boring questions is 
a great way to reduce conversion. Break the form into several 
pages so it takes longer. Include links to FAQ pages that might 
“help” the user leave the cancellation process. And avoid 
using defaults; it maximizes the number of conscious choices 
for the user.
These things are all easy to do, but they all make you think 
rationally and they take time.
Show the user an article they loved, like “10 Ways to Stuff 
More Clowns into a Selfie,” or pictures of their best clown 
friends, or offer exclusive access to the Big Red Shoes Club 
(you know what they say about people with big red shoes!). 
(i.e., Remind the user what they will lose by cancelling.)
Nothing should be difficult or deceptive. We’re not trying to 
stop the user. We’re trying to remove the emotional motiva­
tion to cancel, so they choose to stay. If they have a rational 
reason for leaving, they will still leave. And that’s fine. 
Lesson 75: Anti-UX    167

Accessibility Is Visual
The simplest and most obvious way to make your designs 
more accessible is to make it easier to look at. This is actually 
very similar to the idea of designing for different devices, 
except that the differences are the users instead of the device.
Big text is easier to read, so if your audience is a little older or 
visually impaired, spend some extra time on readability. Color 
blindness is a real thing, and more common than you might 
think. Depending on your audience, up to 10% of them might 
have trouble with red and green, for example, so they might 
not be the best combination for “yes” and “no” options.
Accessibility is the idea of designing for people who have 
less-than-typical abilities in one way or another. Not necessar­
ily a disability. Anything that could make a typical design hard 
to use in any way might fall under the category of accessibil­
ity. It is also one of those topics that could be—and probably 
is—a whole book of its own. So think of this as a very general 
overview.
For beginners, I think the main thing is that you know about 
accessibility and include it whenever you can.
Accessibility is a major consideration for general public sites 
like governments and universities, but also for any site with 
millions of users, like Facebook, Tumblr, news sites, etc.
LESSON 76
Accessibility
When your projects will be used by the general public or specific 
groups of people who are very old, very young, hearing- or 
vision-impaired, who might not understand the languages 
you provide, etc., it’s time to adjust your approach.
168   
Psychology of Usability

Lesson 76: Accessibility    169

Accessibility Is Extra Thoughtful
Like all things in UX, you should try using an app or the 
Internet like your audience will. I promise you this: about 30 
seconds into your testing, you will hate yourself and every 
other designer who hasn’t considered these things.
But don’t stop there! Really think about your design instead 
of just looking at it. What would you want if you were 80 
years old, not tech-savvy, and just needed to find a recipe 
online because you can’t remember anything for more than a 
few minutes?
Accessibility Is Technology
Did you know that sight-impaired people use software called 
Screen Readers to read everything on the Internet? That soft­
ware will often read everything in the order it is laid out in the 
code, so it is worth making sure that is done properly. Screen 
readers might also read content in the “tab order”—the order 
you will select the content if you just hit the Tab key over and 
over—so if you want users with poor or no vision to get to 
the good stuff quickly, consider that detail.
Accessibility Is Content
Use simple words, simpler grammar, so people who are 
not-so-great in your language can still read without a lot of 
trouble.
Make it easy to change the language. Many sites—especially 
American ones—forget that two-thirds of the world doesn’t 
speak English very well. For many users, the language selector 
is not a minor detail; it is a make-or-break feature.
Make the content shorter so it doesn’t take as long to listen 
to it. Make it easy to jump within long pages. Make it easy to 
scan.

Content

Copywriting in UX Is Usability
Remember when I said that the purpose of UX is to make the 
user effective, not happy? Copywriting is probably the most 
pure example of that. Perfect UX copy is understood immedi­
ately and forgotten after it serves its purpose.
The UX designer is not the copywriter, or the marketer, or 
the salesperson, or the creative director. So, when we write 
copy we need to focus on making the user understand and 
engage.
Our headlines are calls-to-action, not storytelling.
Our explanations are instructional, not inspirational.
Our form labels are simple, not clever.
And our buttons labels are written for clarity, not to maximize 
whitespace.
Copywriting in Branding 
Should Create Associations
Remember when we learned about memory? Humans 
connect certain things with certain feelings. The goal of brand 
copywriting is to create those associations.
You might want users to believe your company is more 
human or more scientific or more authentic than your com­
petitors, and the way to make them think that is to write in a 
certain tone.
A brand copywriter might write a clever tagline or campaign 
slogan like Nike’s “Just Do It.” They might write headlines so 
they feel more fun, like MailChimp’s quirky copy. They might 
name products or features to make them more “catchy” 
or “on brand” like Apple’s iEverything or McDonald’s 
McEverything or Ben & Jerry’s flavor names.
LESSON 77
UX Copywriting versus Brand Copywriting
When it comes to copywriting, UX people and true copywriters 
care about different things. Our focus is on specific types of 
writing, and we’re not in it for the poetic street cred.
172   
Content

Choose Your Battles
If someone is designing a beautiful ad with a five-word 
tagline for a fancy magazine, that’s probably not the time 
for UX. If the text is readable, you’re done unless there is a 
chance to do some eye-tracking. Let the copywriter do their 
thing.
(P.S.—Yes, I just used an offline example in a UX book. You 
didn’t think UX happened only on the Internet, did you? UX 
happens in your mind, not on the screen.)
If you’re designing a complex form that is critical to the 
success of the business and the copywriter wants the labels to 
be more poetic, tell them to go suck a lemon. A big one. UX 
can be gangsta like that sometimes.
Good usability is always on brand. Don’t sacrifice function for 
style, ever.
Work Together!
These might seem like opposite things that could never work 
together, but that isn’t true at all! UX and copywriting have 
the same ultimate goal: persuasion.
In UX we make things clear and simple so more people can 
get shit done. Brand copywriters make things more motiva­
tional so more people want to get shit done. But, UX strategy 
can make prices look more attractive. Brand copywriting can 
increase engagement. Brand copy can motivate users, which 
increases engagement. And UX makes products more usable 
which improves the users’ impression of the brand.
In a perfect world, you want both.
Lesson 77: UX Copywriting versus Brand Copywriting    173

Benefit
Sometimes the verb and the benefit are the same thing, like 
the word “upgrade”; it is both the action and the benefit. But 
in a phrase like “Download Version 2 Now!” the new version 
is the benefit. In the phrase “Lose 5 kilograms today!” the 
benefit is losing five kilograms. You get the idea. Just make 
sure the benefit is a benefit to the user, not the website. A 
phrase like “Become a Member” has no clear benefit for the 
user, but the person who owns the site thinks it sounds great.
Urgent Time or Place
Words like “now,” “today,” or “in 1 minute!” provide a time 
frame that is urgent and feels easy. Words like “here” or 
“this” tell users that the button itself is what they are looking 
for. “Like This” or “Start Here” are common examples.
You can follow this formula for text on anything you want 
people to click:
Verb + Benefit + Urgent Time/Place
I have personally increased clicks on a button by 400% just by 
changing the text, and let me tell you: if you want your boss 
to think you’re a wizard, this is the lesson for you.
Verb
The verb is the action word: get, buy, see, try, upgrade, 
download, register, win, lose… whatever. This should be first, 
because it gets to the point immediately and turns the button 
into a command.
LESSON 78
The Call-To-Action Formula
Tiny changes in copy can make huge differences in results. The more 
important a button is, the more you should consider the details.

Content

Things to Avoid
A Call-To-Action (CTA) button/link—the one that you want 
users to click, like a buy/register button—should never begin 
with “Click here to…” The fact that it is a button or a link has 
already told the user that they need to click it (if you designed 
it properly), you don’t have to tell them again. That type of 
copy loses clicks because the user doesn’t see the action or 
benefit that the button executes, so they don’t click. “Click 
here to win” is not as good as “Win today!”
Also, long or difficult words on a button lose clicks. “Start 
here” would work much better than “Commence Forthwith” 
or “If you would like to enter the site begin by clicking this 
button.” Silly examples, but it’s important to remember.
On a button that says “Start Here!” you get an action, a 
benefit, and a place. In my experience, “Start Here” buttons 
work really well when the first question from a user will be 
“Where do I start?” Seems obvious, but it’s not as obvious 
when you’re planning the site in real life. In this case “here” 
describes the button itself.
Wild Card
The word “free” can sometimes take the place of an urgent 
time or place. If the button provides something big for the 
user like software, the user might assume there is a cost 
involved. In that case the word “free” can help reduce anxiety 
and improve click-through-rates. But use it carefully, it can 
also make premium brands feel less premium and imply that 
the benefit isn’t worth much.
Lesson 78: The Call-To-Action Formula    175

•	 Stupid: “Look at you! You’re so good at forms! When 
you get everything typed in there like a good form fill­
er-outer, then you should just go ahead and click that 
fancy yellow button below! You’re almost there, champ!”
•	 Good: “Answer every question. When you’re finished, 
click the yellow Done button at the bottom of this page.”
Labels
It can be very tempting to make labels clever or unique, but 
always resist that temptation. Use the most common, easiest, 
most basic version of the label that you can imagine. If your 
label can have more than one type of answer, it might not be 
clear enough yet. Take a look at these:
•	 Bad: “Where your heart is…”
•	 Not good: “The place where you live”
•	 Better: “Address”
•	 Best: “Home Address”
AS A UX DESIGNER
It is your job to help users complete tasks properly, and that 
often means telling them what something is, and what they 
should do with it.
If it isn’t 100% obvious how users should do something—and 
even if it is—you might want to help them out. 
Instructions should be short, literal, and direct. No lingo. No 
industry terms. No clever jokes or sarcasm or funny business. 
Don’t be too wordy or too soft. Tell the users exactly what 
to do. Use the simplest words and phrases you know. Write 
to everyone as if they were smart children or a non-native 
speaker of the language. Not stupid, just clear. Here are some 
examples:
•	 Bad: “Swing on down to the clicky spot when yer all 
set!”
•	 Also bad: “All input in this area is required data and 
must be successfully submitted to initiate the account cre­
ation process.”
LESSON 79
Instructions, Labels and Buttons

Content

However, this is one of the times in UX when the method is 
fairly easy and the real-life scenario can get political. If you 
have a creative director or a copywriter or client looking at 
your text and saying, “We need to make it more awesome,” 
you should say no.
Prove it with an A/B test if you must, but never back down 
when the text is for practical, functional reasons. Sometimes, 
the “experience” the user needs is something simple and 
clear, not something awesome and confusing.
Labels also apply to buttons, which is something that a lot of 
designers overlook.
If you skip the headline and the instructions, will you still 
understand what the buttons do? If not, make the labels 
better.
•	 Bad Button Labels: “Ok” or “Yes”
•	 Good Button Labels: “Ignore Changes” or “Save 
Changes”

Three Whats = One job
A landing page should be so focused that you don’t even 
need the main menu. In fact, the menu often makes a landing 
page less effective because it distracts the user.
Maybe they want to know how your site works and how to 
sign up. Maybe your campaign made them curious and they 
want to know more. Maybe you’re selling to other businesses 
and they need to see if your product fits their budget and 
needs. Maybe a friend recommended your product and that’s 
all they know!
If you understand what your users want, you should be able 
to tell them exactly why they are in the right place and how to 
get what they want.
Your Site Can Have Many 
Landing Pages
One of them will probably be the “home” page, but that’s 
not the only one. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that 
every user will come in the front door.
Think About Your Site or 
App Like an Airport
You have never been to this city, and you’re arriving from 
somewhere else in the world. You get off the plane with your 
(emotional) baggage and your first question is always the 
same:
“Where do I go?”
You might want to find a taxi, or a toilet, or some food, but 
it’s usually something like that, and you will go for the first 
thing that looks like it will meet your needs.
The difference with a landing page on your website is that 
people can decide to get back on the plane. Your job is to 
show people where to go so they don’t get back on the plane.
A good landing page answers the Three Whats of UX:
1.	 What is this?
2.	 What’s in it for me?
3.	 What should I do next?
LESSON 80
Landing Pages
The first page a user sees when they arrive on your site 
for the first time has one job: get them in the door.
178   
Content

It’s a good idea to create landing pages for your campaigns, 
common Google searches, and for any other specific source 
of traffic that you expect/get. The job of these landing pages 
is to create interest. You measure interest by whether the user 
clicks something or not.
Landing Pages Are Important
When a new user doesn’t click 
anything on your landing pages, 
that’s called a bounce. A user 
who bounces cannot do anything 
else with your site/app/product, 
because they are gone. 
They can’t register, or buy, or 
share, or post content. You are 
failing to make them a user at all.
Therefore, any time you spend 
optimizing a landing page is time 
well spent. Even a 1% improve­
ment could mean thousands or 
millions of dollars in sales, depend­
ing on what you’re working on. 
On the other hand, if 80% of the 
visitors fail to “land,” your airport 
has an emergency on its hands.
Lesson 80: Landing Pages    179

script, but they did it anyway, because readability wasn’t their 
main concern.
On the other hand, if you are a news site, writing your articles 
in a fancy script is probably a great way to get death threats 
and go bankrupt. 
That’s where UX comes in.
Readability Is a Combination of Things
Depending on your design, various things might help. The 
person doing the typography will be a great resource, as well, 
since they spend a lot of their time playing with text.
Here are some things to try: 
Is the text big enough?
Small text tends to look better but it’s difficult to read, 
especially on mobile devices. Try increasing the size of all 
the text in general. That’s also a good way to make it feel 
simpler.
Forget About Choosing 
Serif or Sans Serif
In UX, you don’t care. Even Comic Sans is acceptable, techni­
cally, although I wouldn’t fight for it if I were you.
Readability is the word for the “usability” of big blocks of 
text. Long Wikipedia articles, lists of Google search results, 
your manifesto about miniature donkeys—that sort of thing.
When other kinds of designers are looking at fonts and typog­
raphy, they should be choosing what tone and style those 
typefaces create in the design. They obviously want people to 
be able to read the text, as well, but it isn’t necessarily the first 
concern.
On a bottle of Absolut Vodka, for example, the fancy script 
is a little hard to read, but it looks “fancy,” which is what the 
designer wanted most. A UX designer would have had a panic 
attack about the idea of writing a whole paragraph in that 
LESSON 81
Readability
If you were some other kind of designer, this lesson might be 
called Typography. But since you’re a UX designer, let’s talk 
about how you should treat type for maximum effectiveness.
180   
Content

Use real content, and actually read it
If you’re trying to do any of this with lorem ipsum dummy 
text, then you’re not really doing UX. You can only test 
readability by using text that is readable. Even better, try 
copying and pasting an article that you actually want to 
read!
Add space between the letters
This is called kerning or tracking. When letters get a little 
too close together, they can become hard to read, espe­
cially in a paragraph. Put some “air” in there to make it 
easier to read.
Add space between the lines
This is called leading. As a general rule, 
the space between the lines should be 
about 1.5 times the height of one line 
of text. More can be nice, too. Don’t 
add too much though, or else it might 
be too distracting to go from one line to 
the next.
Add space around the text
All the other crap in your design might 
be distracting people from reading. 
That’s why “reader mode” in some 
browsers and apps take away every­
thing except the text. Focus.
Adjust the width of the column
The optimal width for a column is said 
to be between 45 and 75 characters, 
give or take. The narrower end (50-ish) 
feels better, and the wider end (70-ish) 
is actually faster. You can adapt your 
design based on the device and the 
type of content.
Lesson 81: Readability    181

Know your audience
In UX, that means you do your user research so you know 
who you are persuading and what they care about.
During the Interaction
Open and disarm
You have to engage the user’s interest immediately and 
then proceed to remove any obvious objections they 
might have. In UX, this can be a great headline or an 
eye-catching image above the fold. If price is a concern, 
for example, that should be part of the first information 
the user can see. Don’t assume they will continue far 
enough to learn about it later.
Create rapport
(Say rah-por) is the feeling of getting along with someone 
and it is created by similarities between people. In UX, 
this can be created by using familiar language, showing 
NOTE
Persuasion is complex. My book, The Composite Persuasion, 
is 270 pages specifically about making things persuasive, 
and it is only a “Crash Course”!
The Persuasion Formula
After comparing 40 different types of persuaders, I found that 
all of their methods share 8 common attributes, listed below.
Before the Interaction
Credibility
Without trust, everything else is irrelevant. Ideally you should 
build your credibility for real; however, the main thing is to 
communicate with others in a high-value way. In UX, this 
applies to everything from trustworthy branding, to trans­
parency about your prices, to testimonies from customers. 
Don’t say you’re valuable; show that value to your users.
LESSON 82
The Persuasion Formula
Forcing users to do things is usually a bad idea. People don’t like 
being forced. Instead, we must convince them to take action, and the 
process of “convincing” tends to follow a simple eight-step formula.
182   
Content

After the Interaction
Summarize with bias
Don’t let the persuasion end with the close! That makes 
people feel like you only value them until they give you 
what you want. In UX, this might be a follow-up email 
to remind them about everything they can do with their 
new Macbook, or suggestions for more articles, or feed­
back about how many people liked/agreed with their 
post.
what the user has in common with your customers, or 
describing the main person in your article in a way that 
makes the reader relate to them.
Isolate
When a user has come far enough that their interest is 
clear, you want to remove any competing information. 
In UX, that might mean removing the menu or banners 
during the checkout process so nothing distracts the user 
from their purchase.
Convince
For more complex persuasions, you might need to provide 
“waves” of information that leads the customer from the 
basics to the details, so they understand step-by-step. 
There are a variety of ways to do this. Cognitive biases 
are often helpful to frame the information in a way that 
makes it easier to accept, and easier to consume.
Close the deal
Just ask for commitment and don’t overcomplicate it. In 
UX this is the “publish” button or the “confirm purchase” 
button, or the “share” button.
Lesson 82: The Persuasion Formula    183

This version of the question was on the real-life front page 
of Reddit, with more than 700 comments. (One person 
answered “17 years.” Clearly an artist.)
Another common example of this idea is when someone gets 
laughs for doing something embarrassing. They will, para­
doxically, do it again and again to get more laughs and more 
attention. (Conditioning!) The same effect would be achieved 
if you asked people “what is the worst rejection you have ever 
received?” This type of question on Reddit often includes the 
original person (the one who is asking) giving their own example 
first. 
Now the rewards have been set so the worst story wins, so 
embarrassing yourself gains status, and everybody wants to 
be the worst! Much more effective than “Is it normal to be 
rejected like this?”
Imagine someone posts in a forum and asks, “How do I get 
laid?” At first glance, you’re not particularly interested in 
helping, unless you fancy yourself an artist with this sort of 
thing. This is the way a lot of corporations approach their 
social media activities; direct questions and factual posts, and 
self-centered content. It doesn’t create engagement.
Now imagine if it were phrased more like this: “What is the 
fastest you have ever had sex with someone after meeting 
them? How did it happen?” Suddenly the reader has been 
challenged to tell a story that makes them look good, or at 
least makes them interesting. There is no obvious benefit for 
the person asking the question, but that doesn’t mean there 
is no benefit for them.
It’s more fun to have a crappy or funny answer than not 
to answer, and that’s the whole objective here. It creates 
engagement!
LESSON 83
How to Motivate People to Share
It is possible to make exactly the same idea engaging or 
boring just by the way you present it. More important, 
you can motivate people to contribute, comment, and 
share by making their contribution a source of pride.
184   
Content

Instead of asking for help or examples directly, ask for exam­
ples of greatness. Or create an environment where horrible 
failure is desired by all.
Instead of just telling people to continue or share or click, 
motivate them with a teaser headline, cliff-hanger, or the 
promise of a reward or an opportunity.
If you’re a brand on social media, you will create a reason for 
a lot of people to spend a lot of time with you, building good 
feelings about your brand the whole time. Just don’t fall into 
the trap of clickbait. If you have shitty content, everyone will 
be disappointed when they get to it, and then your site or 
company will be associated with disappointment. Not good.

XII
The Moment of Truth


It is normal to think of the launch as the end of the creative 
process. But don’t.
That process is uncertain: strategic decisions are just educated 
predictions. Design is a matter of taste; people make irrational 
decisions all the time. The only way to know is to do some 
science, and good science always needs a question, a hypoth­
esis, an experiment, results, and interpretation.
Or what we in the industry like to call…
The Scientific Method
The Question/Problem
First and always, you need to start with a question. In your 
case, it might be a user problem. Your job is to understand 
the problem well enough that you can describe it specifically 
and then design a way to solve it.
Many people think that you should come up with some ques­
tions first and then use UX research to answer the questions, 
but that’s wrong. That’s called guessing. UX research is 
supposed to find the questions and problems. By researching 
users and data you will uncover user behavior that needs to 
be fixed, or doesn’t make sense. Why do users do that weird 
thing? What is the main problem for the user? How do users 
think about this feature? Why do people leave on the second 
step of the checkout? Why do so many people bounce on our 
landing page?
There are millions of those questions.
Hypothesis
Your design is your hypothesis: a strategy to solve the 
problem or answer the question. It is based on your research 
and data. It is your solution to the problem or question 
that you discovered in your research. You think it will work 
because the evidence says it will work.
The problem in digital projects is that you are usually so 
busy celebrating your launches that you forget to see if they 
LESSON 84
The Launch Is an Experiment
The main difference between UX design and other types 
of design is that we can measure our designs to see if they 
work. And we do that using the scientific method.
Lesson 84: The Launch Is an Experiment    189

Results
After you launch a site, you can get results like how long 
people stay on your site or how many registered or bought. 
These are not guesses, they are facts. You might need to wait 
a month or two on a small site, but the data will come.
These facts might not agree with your strategy. They might 
indicate that your design—although beautiful—is confusing. 
And they might prove that your obnoxiously large logo is 
distracting.
This is not a failure or a weakness; it is part of launching a 
site professionally. There are some things we just can’t know 
before launching. The site might also be humankind’s greatest 
creation, but we don’t know that, either, until we test it in the 
real world.
actually work. UX is not a matter of taste, it is a matter of 
results. Just because you like it, doesn’t mean it’s good.
Prediction
Before you design your experiment, you should make a 
prediction about what will change if you are right about your 
hypothesis. That means you need to decide how you will 
measure that change.
If you think people don’t notice the button because it is the 
wrong colour, what will change when you fix that problem? 
What will you measure to know if it worked?
If you think people aren’t engaged because you need more 
unicorns and rainbows, what will change when you fix that 
problem? What will you measure to know if it worked?
Experiment
Change your attitude: The launch is the experiment, not the 
result. You don’t know anything until you prove it with real 
users. If you have done your research well and based your 
design on that research, you’re not guessing. You’re experi­
menting. Big difference.

Data for Designers

A soul?!
Ok, ok… it may sound religious, but I am referring to the 
emotional, subjective parts of the human experience.
The soaring highs, the heartbreaking lows.
Call it whatever you want. It’s who we are.
Point is: can we measure it? Yes we can!
Feelings produce actions and decisions, and those things can 
be measured pretty easily.
Neuromarketing
In UX, we usually don’t have an fMRI machine in the office, 
but just as an example: there is an emerging industry that 
measures brains to discover which version of an ad or a movie 
creates the strongest emotions.
It’s essentially an A/B test, (you will learn more about A/B 
tests in Lesson 95) with much cooler data than we usually get. 
When you do an A/B test, you are doing the same thing, but 
using actions instead of brain scans as your evidence.
Groups Are Reliable; 
Individuals, Not So Much
As we learned in Lessons 16–21, motivations (feelings) make 
people do stuff. Actions.
You might “Like” a photo, retweet an article, or embarrass 
yourself in front of millions of people because 50 people said 
you should try to swallow a spoonful of cinnamon.
In UX, our goal is to create actions, not just feelings. We 
motivate people so they will act in a certain way, which is 
helpful for everyone (including us).
LESSON 85
Can You Measure a Soul?
One common opinion in UX is the idea that you can’t 
measure feelings. That isn’t actually true, especially 
when we measure the feelings of a group.
192   
Data for Designers

When we measure individual people, we have to ask them 
face-to-face; otherwise, the details have too much influ­
ence to be reliable. A user might act differently 
because of the news this morning, or their 
personal interests, or because they are 
killing time on the toilet at work.
When you put a few thousand or a few 
million people in a group, however, those 
individual differences don’t matter. The soul 
of the group becomes clear in the data.
When we talk about “the average person,” 
we don’t mean a specific person. We’re 
talking about numbers. And those numbers 
measure the affect of your designs.
Lesson 85: Can You Measure a Soul?    193

Data Is Made of People
You will be tempted to treat data as “just numbers” that 
mean whatever you want them to mean. Remember that 
those numbers represent the actions of real people with 
complicated lives.
Do not reduce millions of people into a single number and 
expect it to be reliable in every situation.
You may also be tempted to look for numbers that “prove” 
you were right. DON’T. And say no to anyone who asks you 
for that.
More Data Is Better Data
If you measure the clicks of five people, they might all be 
drunk, and you have no way to know. If you measure the 
clicks of five million people, it’s pretty unlikely that they are all 
Data Is Objective
In one of the early lessons, we learned about user research.
Data is different.
Data measures user behavior. What they do, how many times 
they did it, how long it took, and so on.
It is collected by a computer, so it can’t influence the user. It 
has well-defined measurements, so there is a very low margin 
of error. It can measure millions of people with no effort from 
you. And it can tell you things about your users like which 
browser they use or which country they are in.
And data never lies. This is science!
But it also doesn’t tell you anything about context, so be 
careful. Unfortunately, we designers have to interpret the 
data, and that is where mistakes can happen.
LESSON 86
What Are Analytics?
Now that you have learned to research users, set goals, plan 
Information Architecture (IA), direct the users’ attention, make 
good wireframes, and create usable features, it’s time to launch! 
And launching means we have something to measure.
194   
Data for Designers

Eye-tracking
Special software and equipment are used to measure 
where the users look as they use your design, so you 
know where you have guided them well, or not. Eye 
movements are unconscious, so I consider eye-tracking 
objective.
Screen capture and heatmaps
Software like HotJar, ClickTale, and Lookback allow you to 
record the screens of real users while they use your prod­
uct. Their input is hidden—everything is anonymous—but 
you see where they click, where the mouse goes, how 
far they scroll, and which pages they see as they move 
through your design. Some tools can also create “heat­
maps” that use color to show you specifically where your 
users (as a group) clicked. Super useful.
Search logs
Many people don’t realize that a search field on your site 
can save every word that is typed into it. If people are 
searching for it, it means they can’t find it, so those logs 
are very valuable for improving your information architec­
ture and layouts!
drunk, unless you only test people in Cancun during Spring 
Break.
The bigger the decision you are trying to make with data, the 
more data you need before you decide. But once the data 
speaks, the data has spoken!
A few ways to collect objective user data
There are just as many ways to get objective data as there are 
ways to get subjective user research:
Analytics
Google and many other companies offer cheap or free 
ways to track what your users do, anonymously. Basically, 
every time they load a page or click something, you will 
know. And you can design custom measurements, so the 
sky is the limit!
A/B tests
Design two versions of the same thing and launch both! 
You will know which one works better because you will 
test it with real people, in real time. The software also lets 
you know when to stop, because at a certain point, track­
ing more people isn’t going to change much.
Lesson 86: What Are Analytics?    195

Traffic Graphs
These graphs show the number of people that did something, 
over time. Like the number of visitors per day. You can call 
that “traffic.”
Traffic will always be moving up and down a little because 
random things in the world happen every day, even when 
your site doesn’t change at all.
That’s why you can never assume that a small change in 
traffic was caused by a new feature or a design change.
Now, on with the shapes!
There are two graph styles that human behavior creates fairly 
often: Traffic and Structured Behavior.
NOTE
I have used a bar graph in these examples because it was 
simpler to understand. Your analytics might use lines or 
dots or whatever. Don’t panic. They all do basically the same 
thing. That’s why we’re learning shapes, not graph types.
LESSON 87
Graph Shapes
You don’t need a deep knowledge of statistics to see 
interesting things in a graph. Human behavior makes a few 
basic shapes on a graph, and they all mean something.
196   
Data for Designers

If it would be fairly easy to walk across your graph, and it 
shows a consistent “rise” or “fall,” then the trend is likely to 
continue, unless you change it.
General Trend
If there is a slow consistent change, you will see it over time.
Lesson 87: Graph Shapes    197

Did you run a weekend campaign? Or, is something techni­
cal causing problems on one of your pages? Or, maybe your 
startup just went public? When you see a spike in a graph (or 
a sudden drop), try to find out what is causing it, because—
as tempting as it is to believe that you have spontaneously 
become cool—there is always a reason for a spike; sometimes 
good, sometimes bad.
Random/Unexpected/One-time event
People don’t suddenly change behavior without being 
provoked.
198   
Data for Designers

Predictable Traffic
A mature site (or a boring one) begins to have a clear pattern 
in visits.
See how there is a pattern repeating over and over, like a 
wave?
Sites that are popular with “office workers” often get more 
traffic during week days. If your users are all kids who go to 
school during the day, weekends might be your big days. That 
is very common and very normal.
But…
If it’s a healthy pattern it will usually come with a slow growth 
trend, too. If you see a super-predictable pattern and your 
numbers are slowly going down, your users might be dying of 
boredom. Shake things up!
Lesson 87: Graph Shapes    199

Exponential/Long Tail
This shows a strong bias toward a certain type of behavior or 
decision.
The graph shows a shape like a slide. More people will click 
the first thing than the second thing, and more people will 
click the second thing than the third thing. Any time there is a 
visual “order” or a natural sequence—like a menu that users 
read left to right—the graph will look like this.
Structured Behavior Graphs
The other big type of graph shows what people are doing. 
The date or hour when they did it isn’t as relevant. You have a 
big effect on this type of behavior via your IA.
NOTE
“Structured behavior” is just a phrase I made up. If you say 
it at work, you will sound smart, but nobody will know what 
you’re talking about, so you should explain it.
200   
Data for Designers

The list of “top pages” will usually look like this, too, because 
you can’t get to page two without going through page one. 
The detailed view of Time-per-Visit or Pages-per-Visit (see 
Lesson 91 about time) also usually looks like this, because 
spending more than 10 seconds on a site is so damn difficult.
Exponential with Unexpected Order
When users are ignoring the structure you gave them, it looks 
like this.
This one is more interesting. If your data looks like it has all 
the right pieces but a few are in the wrong order, it means 
that users have different priorities than you thought. They are 
clicking the second thing before the first thing sometimes. 
Those crazy bastards! 
Try to change your design/IA so it matches what the data is 
telling you. Don’t try to change the users, though; they hate 
that.

have a small group of people who are loyal, or very active, 
or spend a really long time on the site. They are doing much 
more than the average user, so it makes a bump. 
Find out what motivates them and make more of it!

This shows a small group of people who are doing a lot.
This graph looks pretty similar to the first “slide shape” but 
it has a bump. Some people think the graph is pregnant, but

home page of your site is really confusing, you might get a 
graph like this because very few people will get to the second 
page. A/B tests are a really effective way to find the problem, 
if it isn’t obvious.

A huge drop between two bars often indicates a barrier for 
users.
You want your “slide” to look gentle and smooth. If it has any 
insane drops or rough spots, those indicate problems. If the

Everything Is Relative
Try not to get excited or depressed about the actual numbers. 
You might be tempted to say things like, “Is three sessions 
good?” but that’s the wrong way to look at it. 
For you, 3,000 sessions might be the biggest day ever, and for 
some sites 3 million is still depressing. It’s all relative.
Instead, ask yourself: Is three sessions better than last month? 
How many users did you need to get that many sessions? 
And is that better than last month? Is that what a product like 
yours should do?
These numbers mean more together.
Let’s say I visit your website. I spend a few minutes there, I 
have a good time, everybody is happy. After, we all give each 
other (virtual) high fives, and I leave.
Then, tomorrow I visit again. And the next day, I go again.
I have been there three times—three sessions—but I am only 
one guy. One really handsome guy, but still. Just one.
If I were your only visitor (a sad situation in itself) you would 
see “3 sessions” and “1 user” in your Google Analytics, or 
maybe “3 Visitors” and “1 Unique Visitor” in other analytics 
products.
They’re not saying I am more unique than your other visitors, 
although I’ll take it as a compliment anyway. A unique visitor 
is a single user, a person, who can visit more than once.
LESSON 88
Stats—Sessions versus Users
A user can visit more than once. The difference between 
the visitors (unique users) and their visits (sessions) 
says a lot about loyalty and engagement.
204   
Data for Designers

So, if I visit your site three times on my laptop and then two 
more times on my phone, you will see “5 sessions” and “2 
users” in Google Analytics, even though both of those users 
are controlled by the human I affectionately call “me.”
There isn’t anything you can do about it; it’s just good to 
know. The downside is this: you can never know exactly how 
many individual humans came to your site. The upside is this: 
you can do a little more digging into how often users return 
on different devices.
You should spend your time looking at, and thinking about, 
the relationship between the sessions and users numbers. It 
tells you a bit about loyalty and about how well you turn first-
time visitors into repeat visitors.
Analytics are not your score, they are a story. You just have to 
know how to read them.
A User Is Actually a Device. 
Wait, What?!
As far as I know, analytics can’t know that your phone and 
your laptop are both controlled by the human that I affection­
ately call “you.”
Lesson 88: Stats—Sessions versus Users    205

because now they know what your site is and hopefully they 
recognize it.
NOTE
It is still possible that the user came from an ad, or a link on 
a blog, or they searched for something to find you again. 
But they also might have come back by choice.
These numbers mean more together.
Like most of these analytics, the real information comes from 
comparing the two numbers. This time we want to know the 
percentage of each, because if you add all the new users and 
all the returning users, that’s all the users. Math is fun!
REMEMBER
If a percentage goes down, it doesn’t mean you have less of 
something. It just means that number represents a smaller 
piece of the pie. It might have gone down because the other 
number went up! Or, maybe both went up, but the other 
number went up more!
The “health” of your site is general metaphor I have 
used a lot in meetings with clients and bosses. Basically, 
it is the combination of many statistics that indicate whether 
things are getting “better” or “worse” overall. 
Return visitors and new visitors tell a big part of that story. 
They are like taking your site’s pulse.
New Visitors
When a user comes to your site for the first time, they know 
nothing. They might come from an ad, or a link on a blog, or 
they might have searched for something relevant (or irrele­
vant) and discovered you by chance.
Either way, they’re new.
Return Visitors
If that new visitor comes back a second time (or third, or 
hundredth), they are a “return” visitor. This is important, 
LESSON 89
Stats—New versus Return Visitors
You will have many first-time visitors, and some of them will 
come back. By separating them into groups, you can start to 
understand the health of your site and what makes people return.
206   
Data for Designers

If you have very few new visitors, that’s a problem because 
nobody is finding you.
Try to balance growth and loyalty.
Early in the growth of your site, it’s actually good to have 
mostly new users. It means you’re being discovered a lot. 
Maybe 10 to 20% returning visitors, but that’s just a rough 
guideline. 
Over time (months or years), your goal is to make the 
numbers shift the 
other way, without 
losing “sessions and 
users.”
A very established 
site will have mostly 
return visitors, and 
more like 20 to 30% 
new visitors.
If you have very few 
return visitors, that’s 
a problem because 
nobody is coming 
back.
Lesson 89: Stats—New versus Return Visitors    207

On the other hand, Facebook would probably strap a screen 
to your eyeballs if it could, so you would never stop viewing 
pages. For them, more pageviews is better.
If your site makes money by showing banners on each page, 
then more pageviews is good because you make more 
money.
However, this also creates a reason to force users to view 
more pages than necessary (ever seen a 10-photo gallery 
broken into 10 individual pages?), which is a bad experience.
When there is a business reason to do something, and a UX 
reason not to do it, you have to be careful. If you can, fix that 
problem completely.
If you can’t fix it, remember: the more you make users work 
for your content, the less content they will see.
If you’re only doing UX to show more ads, you’re making the 
world worse, not better.
A “pageview” is pretty much what it sounds like: a user 
viewed a specific page on your website (or app).
Pageviews are a passive measurement, because users doesn’t 
have to do anything other than see the page.
They probably clicked or tapped something to get to that 
page, to view it, but analytics will count the page view even 
if the user leaves their apartment as the page loads, and they 
get lost in the woods, only to meet and fall in love with a bear 
and live happily ever after in the woods, never having actually 
seen the page.
“View” might not be the best description. Think of it as a 
page “load.”
Lots of pageviews can be good or bad. Or both.
If you are Google, then having a lot of pageviews is bad, 
because Google wants you to find the right search result as 
fast as possible and go to it. Nobody wants to go through 
pages and pages of search results.
So, for Google Search, fewer pageviews is better.
LESSON 90
Stats—Pageviews
Is your site/app a tool that needs to be efficient? Or, do you have a 
site that needs to be engaging? Pageviews can tell different stories.
208   
Data for Designers

If you’re Wikipedia, three seconds per visit is bad, because 
nobody can read an article in three seconds.
If you compare two pages and one has an average Time 
per Page of 45 
seconds, 
Time per Visit (or time per session) is how long users spend in 
your app or on your site, on average.
Time per Page tells you how long users spend on each specific 
page or screen, on average.
When you are using averages from many users, you have 
to remember that there is probably a wide variety of times 
people spend on the site or on a page. By averaging 
those times it gives you an idea of how the site 
is performing overall and allows you to 
compare one page to another page.
For example, if your site has an 
average Time per Visit of three 
seconds. That means users are either 
finding what they need extremely 
quickly or nobody stays long enough 
to do anything at all.
If you’re Google, you might try to 
give people what they’re looking for as 
fast as possible.
LESSON 91
Stats—Time
Time and pageviews have some similarities, but unlike pageviews, 
time metrics can tell you where your users are engaged… or confused.
Lesson 91: Stats—Time    209

If your site is all images, like Pinterest, then you probably want 
a short Time per Page, on a lot of pages, because images are 
quick and easy to consume—users are browsing! But you still 
want a long Time per Visit—that’s exploring!
If you’re Google you probably want very low Time per Visit, 
Time per Page, and Pageviews, because that would indicate 
that people are finding good results quickly.
If you’re Facebook you want very high Time per Visit (engage­
ment) and Pageviews (ads), but Time per Page is not very 
relevant.
and the other has 3 minutes, then those two pages are 
performing much differently.
Don’t Assume That Time Is Good
When users are confused they will also spend longer on a 
page, because they are trying to figure it out.
More time can mean more engagement or it can mean your 
menu is confusing, or the registration form is too difficult. 
Compare Time and Other 
Stats to Learn More
How much time and how many pages can tell you a lot about 
user behavior. There is no combination that is “good” or 
“bad”—it depends on what your design is supposed to do.
If your site has a lot of text, like the New York Times, then you 
probably want people to spend more time on fewer pages—
they are reading! Lots of pages in a short time might mean 
they are browsing, searching, or lost.

Data for Designers

headlines that are bad or unexpected, confusing IA, and 
designs that don’t show the user where to click.
Bounce rate is the percentage of users who arrive at your 
site, but don’t come in. They “bounce off” instead of actually 
using it.
No clicks. Nothing. Nada.
A low bounce rate (10 to 30%) is good 
because bouncing is bad. A high bounce 
rate (70 to 99%) is bad. Everything in the 
middle is normal-ish. Not good, not terrible, 
not interesting.
Your bounce will never be zero. Somebody 
always bounces. If it is zero percent (or even 
less than five percent), ask your develop­
ers to check the code for a technical error. 
You might be measuring your bounce rate 
incorrectly.
Your goal is to make bounce rate as low as 
possible.
The most common causes of high bounce 
rates are designs that aren’t trustworthy, 
LESSON 92
Stats—Bounce Rate and Exit Rate
It is valuable to know about the users who don’t stay on your 
site, and which parts of your design make people to leave.
Lesson 92: Stats—Bounce Rate and Exit Rate    211

I once redesigned a travel site with one-of-a-kind travel 
packages. Crazy stuff that you couldn’t find anywhere else. 
One package had a much lower exit rate than the others, 
even though the page designs were identical. When I looked 
closer, I realized that the content was written in a different 
style; it was more exciting! By changing the style of the other 
packages to match, we got users to stay for three minutes 
longer and two more pages per visit!
Exit Rate
Every user will leave your site eventually. That is called an exit.
The exit rate of a page tells you what percentage of the 
visitors left the site after viewing that page. 
If you only have three pages, then on average, 33% of users 
will exit from each one. If you have 10 pages, on average 
10% will exit from each one.
The more users go to a page, the higher the exit rate might 
be.
Look for pages with exit rates that “stick out.” If it is much 
higher or lower than the others, look into it. It might be a 
dead end, or a difficult form, or it could even be a good 
thing!
212   
Data for Designers

On a page with 25 banners that nobody cares about, a few 
people will still click them.
On a site with eight levels of navigation, the deepest pages 
will still be visited once or twice.
When you measure user behavior, it helps to understand 
what a group looks like, statistically. Numbers can tell you a 
lot about your design, but you need the right perspective. UX 
is about increasing the chance, the odds, the probability that 
users will do something.
Think of UX as the process of reducing the amount of options 
in a user’s mental roulette wheel. Every user may not win 
every time, but more users will win overall.
1% of People Will Do Anything
Many years ago, after many discussions about user-generated 
content, a colleague of mine named a rule after me:
Marsh’s Law: “Every feature will eventually be abused to its 
maximum abusability.”
Or, you can think about it like this: if something can be used, 
it will eventually be used by someone. 
That doesn’t make it good.
LESSON 93
The Probabilities of Interaction
Uncertainty is part of your UX life. It’s not a yes/no thing. You’re not 
trying to make something work, you are trying to make it work better. 
Lesson 93: The Probabilities of Interaction    213

Many people will look at the conversion rate and say “Wow! 
80% of our users make a purchase!”
Then, the whole team will go have drinks, or play in the 
inflatable castle, or whatever it is people do at your company 
to celebrate.
However, as the UX designer, you should not go to that party. 
You’re losing about 90% of potential sales.
But you aren’t losing them in the checkout. You are losing 
them at the landing page.
If 40% of people click on the landing page and 40% of them 
make a purchase, you would actually sell twice as much, even 
though your conversion rate is half.
80% of 10% = 8%
40% of 40% = 16%
Almost every company I have worked with has had a problem 
like this, but very few people notice. It can literally be a 
million-dollar mistake.
And I am still amazed that Facebook “Like” buttons get clicks 
on porn sites—or so I have heard.
It will be tempting to keep features because some users use it. 
Resist that temptation.
Every time someone clicks a shitty feature, they aren’t clicking 
something more useful.
90% Is Everybody
If you make a design so effective that the majority of people 
do what you hoped, that’s great!
If 90% of your users are aware that they can pay or register 
to get an upgrade, your design is great.
If 90% of users leave your site without clicking anything, it’s 
an emergency.
The only time I have seen 100% of users do something, it was 
a technical error or there was only one user.
Probabilities Are Not Intuitive
If 10% of people click on your landing page, and then 80% 
of those people make a purchase, is the design good?
Actually, no.
214   
Data for Designers

Items on the left of a horizontal list or at the top of a vertical 
list get more clicks because they are the first things people 
see.
Anchoring only works when the anchor is the first option. 
If you have something else in the first position, it might be 
getting clicks just because users see it first.
I have seen people build strategies on the assumption that 
Option #1 is what users like most, when in reality it is just 
what users see first.
Content Attention versus 
Surface Attention
You have learned how to grab the user’s attention and how 
to minimize competing messages. 
So what if everybody loves your site, but nobody reads it?
We have already learned a lot about the ways you can present 
information so more people choose certain options than they 
normally would.
But what if you see a lot of people choosing an option that 
you didn’t want them to choose?
There are probably a million examples of this. However, my 
goal in this lesson is not to give you a library of scenarios—
just to give you a taste of the way your navigation or layout 
might be a sheep in psychology’s clothing.
Order versus Appeal
You have learned about how to bias your content so that 
certain options look more attractive than others.
If users don’t choose those options it is possible you did it 
wrong. Or, you might just have them in the wrong order.
LESSON 94
Structure versus Choice
There are two major aspects of UX design that can 
give you mysterious results: IA and user psychology. 
And it is possible for one to look like the other.
Lesson 94: Structure versus Choice    215

Hierarchy versus Motivation
We have learned that user psychology is about motivat­
ing users to do important actions, like registering, buying, 
subscribing, upgrading, etc.
If you’re not getting much traffic to your conversion pages, it 
could be because people don’t want to register. Or, it could 
be because the users can’t get there.
If a user clicks down into a page that doesn’t have a 
“Register” button on it, they will not go backward when they 
become motivated to register.
They just won’t find the button.
Very few users will ever mention it, because it’s not a visual 
problem. It’s a business problem.
A common trend lately is websites with amazing visual effects 
and animations as you scroll. The problem is this: sometimes, 
it is more interesting to scroll up and down than to stop and 
read.
That’s surface attention. We want content attention.
Animations and cool effects should be used as elements of 
delight, not the whole design. Remember that motion beats 
everything, attention-wise. That means people will watch 
whatever is moving and ignore whatever isn’t.
Ever tried to read moving text? Probably not, because you 
were too busy watching it.
Motion and parallax effects should draw attention to things 
the user should do. Not the pure awesomeness of the design­
er’s imagination.
216   
Data for Designers

Design all the things! Then, you launch all the options at the 
same time, as an A/B Test.
What Is an A/B Test?
An A/B test is a way of asking thousands or millions of real 
visitors which option is best.
The tests make sure that each unique visitor only sees one 
option. Then, after enough people have gone through your 
test, you can see which version of the design created more 
clicks. The test should also measure the “confidence level” 
statistically so you know when you’re done (don’t stop it too 
early!)
You can do it with 2 versions, or 20 versions. Just remem­
ber: only part of your traffic can see each one, so the more 
versions you are testing, the more traffic or time you will 
need.
Let me paint the picture a little bit first…
Imagine that you want to design a page to sell shoes. And, of 
course, you want to sell as many shoes as possible. What do 
you think would get more people to buy?
A video of the shoes?
Complete shipping details before they click “buy”?
The logo of the shoe brand?
A money-back guarantee?
How do you choose?
If your first thought was, “Ask the users!” that’s not a bad 
idea. But often—when the options are all subjective, like 
this—asking people just confirms that different people like 
different things.
So, how can you decide between subjective things, like a 
boss?!
LESSON 95
A/B Tests
User research and user psychology are great ways to 
predict how users will behave and what they will do. But 
we don’t just want to predict. We want to know.
Lesson 95: A/B Tests    217

3.	 An A/B Test is most reliable when you only change one 
detail. If two pages are the same, but one has red links 
and one has blue links, that’s fine. If they also have differ­
ent menus, then there is no way to tell whether it is the 
link color or the menu that is making the difference. If 
you want to test multiple changes, you need a multivari­
ate test (next lesson!).
4.	 Testing two totally different pages, like a home page and 
a checkout form, is useless. That’s not a proper A/B Test.
Some tips
1.	 A/B Testing is usually free, other than the time it takes to 
design and create the pages you’re testing. The results 
can be extremely valuable, so even a small cost to do an 
A/B Test is very worth it.
2.	 It is not the same thing as launching a new page and then 
watching to see if that page seems better than the old 
one. The only way to compare two designs is to run them 
both at the same time, using (roughly) equal numbers of 
people for both.
218   
Data for Designers

Nope.
Here’s the kicker:
Any of the headlines will work with any of the photos. But 
depending on the combination, the user might have different 
reactions.
Maybe some people want to see the greatest thing ever, but 
only if the photo shows something they like.
Maybe some people would love to see the worst thing ever, 
but only if the photos show something they hate.
Or, maybe your mom makes every headline more effective! 
Who knows?!
Very subjective. Very complicated.
How would you know what combination to use!?
A multivariate test, that’s how.
Multivariate tests think harder than you can.
A multivariate test can test combinations of changes.
Multi-VARIATE. (Say: “multi-very-it”)
When you change one thing on your page or site, it can affect 
how the users think about something else. A multivariate test 
allows you to test relationships between design elements.
Let’s say you have three options for headlines: 
Headline 1: “This is the greatest thing ever!”
Headline 2: “This is the worst thing ever!”
Headline 3: “This is kind of really ok, ish!”
And you also have three options for photos to go with those 
headlines!
Photo 1: A puppy.
Photo 2: A hamburger.
Photo 3: Your mom.
That doesn’t sound so bad. Seems like an A/B/C test. Right?
LESSON 96
A Multi-what-now Test?!
An A/B test is brilliant for testing a specific change in your 
design. But, if you want to test how one design element 
affects another, you need a multivariate test.
Lesson 96: A Multi-what-now Test?!    219

So don’t!
Let the software pick combinations of headlines and photos 
randomly, and at the end it will tell you that Headline 2 with 
Photo 3 got the highest percentage of clicks. Or Headline 1 
and Photo 1. Or whatever.
Multivariate tests need more traffic than an A/B test because 
there are more combinations to test, but they also produce 
answers that would be a pain in the ass using A/B testing.
Try it!
In this case there are nine combinations of photos and 
headlines:
Headline 1 with photo 1, 2 or 3. 
Headline 2 with photo 1, 2, or 3. 
And headline 3 with photo 1, 2, or 3.
That is a lot of information to compare in your head. You will 
never be able to make a rational guess about which combina­
tion of headline and photo will be most popular.
220   
Data for Designers

Sometimes A/B testing is the only way to know.
Design and launch the experiment. Make the versions exactly 
the same except for that psychological detail.
Compare the results, and go with the winner.
Do the science. Trust the science. Be the science.
Eventually you will come to a design choice that is psychology 
versus psychology; motivation versus motivation; emotion 
versus emotion.
Maybe you have to choose between creating trust in your 
company or creating trust in the product you’re selling.
Maybe you have to choose between promoting the exclusive 
status of the brand or the popularity of the brand.
Maybe you need to choose between the word “enjoy” and 
the word “save”—they are both benefits! Or are they?
In those situations, it is damn near impossible to base your 
decisions on theory. And asking users face to face is not 
reliable unless you plan to ask 10,000 of them.
LESSON 97
Sometimes A/ B Testing Is the Only Way to Know
This book includes a lot of ways that you can use psychology to 
make things look and feel better than they would otherwise. But, 
what if you have to choose between two psychological strategies?

Get a Job, You Dirty Hippy

On a typical day I will arrive late, my personal secretary will 
give me a vanilla latté just the way I like it, and there is a 
waiting room full of people that want me to bestow knowl­
edge upon them.
But I like to ignore them for a while when I come in so they 
recognize my importance. I put my feet up on my desk, sip my 
latté, and then—if I feel like it—I will see each of my minions 
for five minutes, so they get a chance to worship my wire­
frames, kiss my ring, and shuffle out of the room backward, 
while they bow and say “sorry” over and over.
Pretty much what you expected, right?
You wish. 
REALIT Y CHECK
As a professional UX designer, you will spend most of your 
time gathering information or explaining things to people 
who may or may not agree with you.
UX is a very valuable part of any team. You will have a lot 
of responsibility, and you will probably get paid a salary that 
reflects your value. UX is also a role that will not be under­
stood by most of your colleagues, and therefore you might be 
surprised how often they want your input, and/or don’t listen 
to it.

The User Interface (UI) is what you see. UX is why you see it. 
If you’re more excited by making beautiful apps, or working 
with branding and ad campaigns, or designing logos and 
icons and color schemes, UI is for you.
If you’re more interested in what this book contains, UX is 
more your style. (But you’re always welcome to learn both!)
Generalist versus Specialist
You might hear UXers and recruiters talking about “general” 
UX (a little of everything) or “specialist” UX (focus on one of 
the roles described in this lesson).
In my opinion, all beginners should be generalists. Try every­
thing. Learn everything. Take any responsibility someone is 
willing to give you.
Five years from now, when you’re pretty good at most parts 
of UX, then you can decide if you want to be great at one 
particular area.
If you ever want to start a heated argument, go into a room 
full of UX designers and ask, “What is the definition of UX?” I 
promise you, all hell will break loose.
UX is a word like “personality.” Everybody understands what 
it is until somebody tries to define it in specific terms, and 
then the pitchforks come out.
With that in mind, I also understand that beginners need to 
know which jobs to look for, which jobs exist, and which jobs 
will make you happy. Following is a very brief overview of UX 
roles, which hopefully won’t make anybody want to send me 
death threats.
UI versus UX
First of all UI and UX are very different jobs. If you ever see 
a job where the job title is “UI/UX” it means the company 
doesn’t know what UX is, or it’s trying to cover two roles with 
one salary. Beware.
LESSON 99
Which UX Job Is Right For You?
All UX-related designers work on the same sorts of things, but 
different jobs focus on different areas. Which one is best for you?
Lesson 99: Which UX Job Is Right For You?    227

UX will interact more with other departments than specialist 
UX roles like IA or IxD, and it might include more of the busi­
ness considerations. So, if you think more about the product 
rather than the interface itself, UX is probably more your style.
UX Strategy
It’s hard to explain what a UX Strategy is in one paragraph, 
but think of it as a combination of marketing and UX. This 
type of position is more common in bigger, tech-savvy com­
panies or digital agencies. Those products and features need 
to fit into a marketing plan rather than solving real-world 
problems as a product. 
i.e., If you’re making an app for a company whose product 
is alcohol, it’s more strategic than useful, because nothing 
digital will make their alcohol better. Still cool, still UX, but it’s 
different. 
If you want to be a “Growth Hacker,” or if you want to build 
UX into marketing campaigns, or if you want to be a less 
technical (but more advertising-oriented) version of a UX 
designer, this might be your deal.
UX Research
The opposite side of the UX coin (compared to UX Strategy) 
might be UX Research. These people do way more face-to-
face user interviews and spend much more time with the data 
than a generalist like me.
Information Architecture
Information Architects work mostly with the structure of the 
content and pages. In smaller projects like apps and basic 
websites, Information Architecture (IA) is not a huge job, so 
it isn’t a separate role. But in really big projects like a global 
corporate intranet, or something like Wikipedia, or social net­
works, or large government archives, IA can be a big deal. 
If that feels like your thing, then the role of Information 
Architect is for you.
Interaction Design
Interaction Design (IxD) is the interface itself, but without 
thinking too much about style. So, you might not work as 
much with the IA, but you will get deeper into the details of 
animations, flows, and layouts for the actual pages.
IxD tends to connect more with frontend coding or UI design 
because it’s hard to think about one without thinking about 
the other. So if that sounds like you, then maybe IxD is your 
role of choice. 
UX
UX is the general term, or the “umbrella,” that all of these 
roles are “within”. If you don’t want to focus, and would 
prefer to be more of a big picture designer, then just stick 
with UX as a role. I have been doing this stuff for a while now 
and I still prefer UX as a job title.

However, in-house teams tend to work on the same types of 
things for a long time, so your experience won’t be as diverse, 
and you won’t be as “deep” in other areas.
Startup
At a startup, you will get an exciting opportunity and will 
probably have an influence on every part of the company. 
Since there won’t be many designers, you will get a lot more 
responsibility. Sometimes, the best learning happens when 
you bite off a little more than you can chew. 
However, at a startup you might not have a boss with UX 
experience, so you’re on your own. That means you get more 
glory when it goes right, but you could also ruin the product 
if you’re not careful. And you probably won’t have any money 
to spend, so anything more expensive than “free” will be too 
expensive. That is more difficult, but if you’re creative it might 
also generate your best ideas.
If you love analysis and want to spend a lot more time solving 
real-world user problems—and probably be a little more sci­
entific—this is a good role for you. 
Agency, In-House, or Startup?
The type of company you work for will also affect your role. 
Officially, I recommend that you try working at all of these 
types of companies if you can. They will teach you different 
things. 
Agency
As a consultant, like ad agencies or UX agencies, you will see 
a lot more projects, and many different types of projects, 
and speed matters. That means you will learn faster, it can be 
more exciting, and your experience will be more diverse.
However, at an agency you will only spend three to six 
months on a typical project, and most often there won’t be 
a “version 2” of anything, so you won’t get a chance to live 
with a product or think long term. 
In-House
When you are part of the team inside a company, you will 
work mostly on a single product or a set of products, all the 
time. You will learn a deeper understanding of that type of 
user and that type of product, and you will probably work on 
several versions of it. In-house teams often get to “try” more 
things, and A/B testing is where you will learn a lot about 
individual features and tactics.
Lesson 99: Which UX Job Is Right For You?    229

Make it simple and short. If the boss wants details, they can 
ask you for them in the interview. For now, explain what you 
did, why you did it, how you researched it, and any of the 
limitations you had to work with.
And even though UX isn’t about style, you should have visual 
things to show: sketches, wireframes, analytics screenshots, 
site maps, before-and-after designs, etc. 
Show your process! Teach them what you do!
Focus on Problems, 
Insights, and Results
If you focus on the pictures, it will give the boss the impres­
sion that you mostly do pictures. So don’t. 
Every project you do can be summarized as a problem that 
you discovered through research, a solution that was sup­
ported by evidence, data and your ingenious insights about 
users, and the results of that solution—hopefully good 
results.
Remember your audience: they don’t understand UX.
The average “boss” that is interviewing you for a UX position 
won’t actually know a lot about UX. Or, at least, that’s what 
you should assume.
Begin your portfolio by saying what you do or what responsi­
bilities you are interested in. It might not be a bad idea to say 
what you believe you are going to add, as well. 
If your future boss is a UX wizard, they will appreciate your 
clarity and the fact that you took the time to explain it in a 
simple way.
If they are regular people, it will help them understand what 
to ask you about, and why your portfolio might not include 
many “pretty things.”
Tell Short, Visual Stories
A UX portfolio doesn’t have the luxury of showing lots of 
beautiful screenshots. If you can make sexy interfaces, too, 
then great. If not, then you have to tell stories about what 
you have done.
LESSON 100
What Goes in a UX Portfolio?
UX is still relatively new, and difficult for nondesigners to understand. 
When you apply for a job you need to inform and inspire.
230   
Get a Job, You Dirty Hippy

nothing more interesting than someone who seems smart 
and unique. 
Have a blog? Link to it!
Do photography? Show some!
Does your background give you a unique perspective? 
Mention it!
Nobody expects a beginner to have a lot of experience. Show 
them you are smart, can solve problems, and that you’re 
willing to do the work; the rest is just details.
This brings us to the end of the book. 100 lessons! Well 
done! 
UX is 90% about how you think, and 10% about what you 
design. If you have read every lesson, understood them, and 
feel like you can apply them to real products, you’re already 
doing well.
I am pretty sarcastic a lot of the time, but UX is something I 
am really passionate about, and I hope this book has made it 
easy to share some of that passion with you.
You are always welcome to find me on Twitter: 
@HipperElement.
I also blog about UX and share links to the best things I find: 
www.TheHipperElement.com.
Thanks for reading, and good luck!
If you prove that you can make things work better by under­
standing users, you will immediately look valuable to any 
organization, regardless of how much experience you have.
No Experience? Make Some!
Unlike most jobs, it’s not that hard to make a basic UX portfo­
lio without any real jobs or clients.
Do case studies: Take a famous product or website—maybe 
even the one you want to work for—and get some real 
people to use it while you observe. Design a concept that 
solves some of the problems that you discover, or design A/B 
tests to investigate. Explain all of your reasoning, show your 
work, and make a wireframe for the final solution.
Solve a real problem: Design a mobile app to solve a 
problem you see in the world. It doesn’t have to be a full-
sized startup pitch… just demonstrate that you can produce 
solutions by yourself. That’s very attractive to a potential boss.
A/B–test your own site: Have a blog or a personal site 
somewhere online? You should. Google Analytics allows 
you to do A/B tests for free using a product called Content 
Experiments, so do some tests and see what happens. Then 
put the results in your portfolio.
Be Yourself
Don’t be afraid to add some personality! When employers 
sit and read 100 applications for a design position, there is
