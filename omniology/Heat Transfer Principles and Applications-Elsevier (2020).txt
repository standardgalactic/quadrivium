Preface
Over my years of teaching heat transfer, I have watched as the major textbooks in the ﬁeld have gotten
bigger and bigger. They have reached such a massive size that only a small portion of a book can be
successfully covered in a semester-length course. Also, the problems in the books have become so
complex that many, or most, students have comprehension difﬁculties. Inordinate amounts of time
are needed to just understand the problems, leaving much less time available for their solution.
The overall goal of this book is to assist the student in obtaining the greatest possible beneﬁts from
a semester-long undergraduate heat transfer course. The book is of reasonable length. Although it
contains more material than can be covered in the course, the extra material is not excessive, and it
provides the professor with ﬂexibility in topic selection. The problems in the book are of a practical
nature. They require the students to think critically, but are not excessively hard to comprehend.
The book is designed for a one-semester heat transfer course for mechanical engineering students
taken in the junior or senior year. It is also beneﬁcial for practicing mechanical engineers and for
practicing engineers in other disciplines (e. g., civil and electrical) who encounter heat transfer aspects
in their projects. Finally, with a chapter devoted to mass transfer, the book is useful for chemical
engineering students and engineers.
The book makes extensive use of Excel and MATLAB for the solution of numerical problems.
Excel Goal Seek is used for solution of single nonlinear equations, and Solver is used for simultaneous
linear and nonlinear equations. The fzero function of MATLAB is used for single nonlinear equations,
and MATLAB programs incorporating the GausseSeidel method are used for simultaneous equations.
MATLAB is also used for the solution of transient problems.
There are 12 chapters in the book, plus an appendix. Brief descriptions are as follows:
Chapter 1 introduces the three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation and
gives their basic equations. There are also sections regarding the direction of heat ﬂow, temperature
continuity and heat balances, unit systems, signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and the recommended approach to
problem-solving.
Chapter 2 deals with the differential equations for heat conduction in rectangular, cylindrical, and
spherical coordinates. It also discusses boundary conditions for the different geometries.
Chapter 3 discusses the solution of steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction problems. The
resistance concept and the electriceheat analogy are introduced. Heat generation in current-carrying
wires is covered, as is the conduction shape factor. Finally, there is a discussion of ﬁns.
Chapter 4 deals with unsteady conduction. It includes the lumped method; the Heisler method for
planes, cylinders, spheres, and multidimensional objects; and conduction in semi-inﬁnite solids.
Chapter 5 covers numerical methods applied to both steady and unsteady situations. The appro-
priate ﬁnite-difference equations are derived. Excel and MATLAB are used for the solution of the
resulting simultaneous linear and nonlinear equations.
Chapters 6 and 7 deal with convection. Chapter 6 is forced convection for internal and external
ﬂows. Chapter 7 is natural (free) convection. Both chapters present the pertinent dimensionless
numbers and correlation equations for the heat transfer coefﬁcient. Chapter 7 includes sections on
natural convection for enclosed spaces such as rectangular spaces between parallel plates and annular
spaces between concentric cylinders and spheres.
Chapter 8 covers heat exchangers. Both the log mean temperature difference and effectivenesse
number of transfer unit methods are discussed.
xiii

Chapter 9 deals with radiation heat transfer. There are sections on blackbody emission, radiation
properties, radiation shape factors, and radiant heat transfer between surfaces of an enclosure.
Radiation shields are also discussed.
Chapter 10 is unique. It is designed to enhance the students’ problem-solving abilities. Most of the
previous chapters were based on a single mode of heat transfer. The problems in this chapter are multi-
mode, incorporating more than one mode of heat transfer. The students have to determine what modes
are signiﬁcant, whether the problem is steady state or unsteady, and whether an analytical or numerical
solution should be used. They must also search out and provide any necessary information not given in
the problem statement.
Chapter 11 covers mass transfer. It discusses concentrations and properties of gas mixtures, Fick’s
law of diffusion, diffusion coefﬁcients, and Stefan’s law. Evaporation, venting from containers, and
mass transfer through walls and membranes are also covered. Finally, it discusses the wet-bulb and
dry-bulb psychrometer.
Chapter 12 consists of special topics which can be covered in the course if time permits. The
Chapter 3 discussion of heat generation in wires is extended to cover generation in plane walls and
spheres. Contact resistance and condensation/boiling are also discussed. Finally, there is a discussion
of energy usage in buildings, with special emphasis on the degree-day method.
The Appendix includes properties of materials, tables of Bessel and error functions, a discussion of
the use of Excel and MATLAB, and listings of MATLAB m-ﬁles for the examples of Chapter 5.
A few comments regarding teaching the course: A semester-length course at Hofstra is usually 13
or 14 weeks long with two 80-minute lectures per week. I have found that Chapters 1 through 9 can be
readily covered during a semester. It also may be possible to include a couple of topics from Chapters
11 or 12 if the professor so desires. I also recommend devoting a class session to Chapter 10. I typically
switch the order of Chapters 4 and 5. I teach Chapter 5 before Chapter 4 because I require the students
to submit two computer solutions: one for steady state and the other for unsteady state. Switching the
order allows the students to jump-start their computer work. I give three exams: one after Chapter 3,
one after Chapter 8, and the ﬁnal exam. I typically assign three or four homework problems per week. I
feel that class attendance is very worthwhile for the students, so my grading is usually 60% exams,
15% homework, 15% attendance, and 10% computer problems.
The following materials are provided to professors adopting the book: A solutions manual for end-
of-the-chapter problems; Excel spreadsheets and MATLAB m-ﬁles for end-of-the-chapter problems;
PowerPoint lecture slides; image bank of ﬁgures from the book; To obtain access, qualiﬁed instructors

1.1 Introduction
Let us ﬁrst discuss the relationship between thermodynamics and heat transfer. Thermodynamics, the
ﬁrst thermal science course in most engineering programs, is a study of equilibrium states of systems. It
considers the different types of energy (e.g., mechanical, kinetic, and potential, heat, internal) and the
amount of energy transferred during a system’s process from one equilibrium state to another. Ther-
modynamics has two basic laws. The ﬁrst law deals with conservation of energy and the conversion of
energy from one type to another. The second law deals with observed restrictions on system processes.
For example, there cannot be a process which solely involves the transfer of heat from a region of lower
temperature to a region of higher temperature. Thermodynamics considers the amount of energy being
transferred. It does not usually deal with the time needed for this energy transfer.

Heat transfer adds the time dimension to energy processes. It deals with the rate of transfer of heat
energy as a system moves from one equilibrium state to another. As an example, let us consider a hot
metal object at initial temperature T1 being cooled by a liquid at temperature T2. During the process,
the heat ﬂows from the object to the liquid and the temperature of the object decreases. The object
ﬁnally reaches the temperature T2 of the liquid. Thermodynamics can predict the amount of heat
transferred to the liquid during the process. Heat transfer provides further details. It can predict how
long it will take for the object’s temperature to go from T1 to T2. Heat transfer can also provide the
temperature distribution in the object at different times during the process.
In this chapter, we introduce the three modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) and
present their fundamental equations. We also discuss unit systems and give recommendation regarding
approaches to problem solving and the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures to retain in numerical results.
1.2 Modes of heat transfer
Mechanical engineering has two major areasdthermal/ﬂuids and mechanics/machine design. Heat
transfer, the subject of this book, is part of the ﬁrst area.
Transfer of heat occurs as a result of a temperature difference. This is the driving force which
causes the heat to ﬂow. If there is no temperature difference, there is no heat ﬂow.
It is also observed that heat ﬂows in the direction from the higher temperature to the lower
temperature.
There are three primary modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation.
Heat conduction occurs if there is a temperature difference between two locations in a solid or two
locations in essentially nonmoving liquids or gases. Heat convection typically occurs due to a
temperature difference between a surface of an object and an adjacent ﬂuid. Change of phase (i.e.,
evaporation and condensation) is also included in the convection category. Heat radiation occurs
between two surfaces of different temperatures. Conduction and convection require physical material
(i.e., solids or ﬂuids) for their transport. Radiation can occur through a vacuum.
Knowledge of heat transfer fundamentals is essential for design of many devices, systems, and
processes. For example, heat transfer knowledge is needed for design of systems for cooling of
computers and other electrical devices; heating and cooling equipment for buildings, refrigerators,
boilers, and car engines; and heat exchangers for many different industrial applications. Heat transfer
is indeed a major subject area for mechanical engineers and also chemical engineers.
We will now introduce the three modes of heat transfer. Later we will discuss unit systems,
problem-solving techniques, and signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
1.3 Conduction
Transfer of heat by conduction occurs in solids and in essentially nonmoving liquids and gases. It has
been observed (through experimentation) that the rate of heat transfer per unit area is proportional to
the temperature gradient in the material. That is,
qn
An
fvT
vn
(1.1)

Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

where n designates the direction of the heat ﬂow; e.g., x, y, or z in Cartesian coordinates.
In this equation, qn is the rate of heat ﬂow in direction n, An is the cross-sectional area through
which the heat ﬂows, and vT/vn is the temperature gradient in direction n. (Note: The area A is the area
perpendicular to the heat ﬂow.)
If we introduce a proportionality parameter into Eq. (1.1) and introduce a minus sign so that heat
ﬂow in the positive n direction will be numerically positive, we get Fourier’s law [1,2]:
qn
An
¼  k vT
vn
(1.2)
Eq. (1.2), named for French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier (1768e1830), gives the
heat ﬂow rate per unit area in the n direction at a point in the solid or ﬂuid. Heat ﬂow rate per unit area
is called “heat ﬂux.” Heat ﬂow is a vector quantity which has direction and magnitude. If we are using
Cartesian coordinates, there can be heat ﬂow and heat ﬂux components in all three coordinate
directions. The heat ﬂow components are qx, qy, and qz. The heat ﬂux components are

y ¼ k vT

z ¼ k vT

(1.3)
where k is the thermal conductivity of the material. If we are using the SI unit system where q is watts,
the area is m2, and the temperature gradient is C/m, then k has the units of W/m C. (Note: As the size
of a Celsius degree is the same as the size of a Kelvin degree, the numerical value of k in W/m C is the
same as its value in W/m K. That is, 1 W/m C ¼ 1 W/m K.)
[Note: In this text, we will usually leave out the symbol used for a temperature degree. That is, we
will often use W/m C rather than W/m C for the units of thermal conductivity. And, when we are
talking about a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, we will use 20 C rather than 20C.]
Thermal conductivity is highest for pure metals and a bit lower for alloys. The conductivity for
liquids is generally lower (except for liquid metals) and for gases even lower. Building materials such
as wood, plaster, and insulation have low conductivity. Multilayer evacuated insulation used for
insulating cryogenic tanks has very low conductivity.
For most materials, thermal conductivity is isotropic; that is, it is the same in all directions.
However, for some materials, it varies with direction. For example, although a single average k value is
often given for wood, the conductivity of wood is actually different in the across-the-grain and with-
the-grain directions.
Table 1.1 gives typical thermal conductivity values for some materials at about 20 C. Appendices A
through E give detailed information on the properties of common solids, liquids, and gases.
In general, thermal conductivity decreases with temperature for metals, decreases slightly with
temperature for many liquids, and increases with temperature for gases.
1.3.1 Conduction through a plane wall
In this section we develop the equation for the rate of heat ﬂow through a plane wall. The equation is
very useful for estimating heat ﬂow through large walls of ﬁnite thickness, such as the exterior walls of
a building. It is also useful in other situations where the heat ﬂow can be considered to be one-
dimensional; that is, the heat ﬂow is in a single direction.
1.3 Conduction

Consider the plane wall shown in Fig. 1.1. The wall has a thickness L and is very large in the y and z
directions. The left face of the wall is at temperature T1 and is at location x ¼ 0. The right face of the
wall is at temperature T2 and is at location x ¼ L.
Let us assume that T1 > T2. The heat ﬂow will be one-dimensional and will be in the positive x
direction.

Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

As all the heat ﬂow is in the x direction, Eq. (1.2) can be modiﬁed by changing “n” to “x” (or just
simply use “q”) and changing the partial derivative to a total derivative. That is,
q
A ¼  k dT
dx
(1.4)
Moving dx to the left-hand side of the equation, we can then integrate both sides of the equation:

dx ¼ 

(1.5)
q
A L ¼

(1.6)
In general, the conductivity k is a function of temperature. However, if k is constant or if we use an
average k value for the problem, then k may be taken outside of the integral sign in Eq. (1.6), and we
have
q
A L ¼ kðT1  T2Þ
(1.7)
Rearranging this equation, we reach its ﬁnal form:
q ¼ kA
L ðT1  T2Þ
(1.8)
Details of conduction heat transfer are given in Chapters 2e4.
Example 1.1
Heat ﬂow through a plane wall
Problem
A large concrete wall is 300 mm thick and has a thermal conductivity of 1.2 W/m C. The heat ﬂux through the wall is
100 W/m2. The higher-temperature surface of the wall is at 42 C. What is the temperature of the other surface of the wall?
Solution
Heat ﬂux is heat ﬂow per unit area, or q/A. From Eq. (1.8), we have
q ¼ kA
L ðT1  T2Þ
We want to obtain T2. Rearranging the equation, we get

1.4 Convection
Transfer of heat by convection typically occurs between a surface and an adjacent ﬂuid. Convection is
a phenomenon involving conduction in the ﬂuid and ﬂuid motion.
1.4 Convection
5

Fig. 1.2 below shows a ﬂuid ﬂowing over a surface. Observations show that the ﬂuid sticks to the
surface. As we move away from the surface, the ﬂuid velocity, u, increases until it reaches the free
stream velocity uN. In the free stream, the temperature of the ﬂuid is TN. The temperature of the
surface is Ts.
Let us consider the case where the surface temperature is greater than the ﬂuid temperature; that is,
Ts > TN. Heat ﬂows by conduction from the surface into the stagnant ﬂuid layer on the surface. The
heat then proceeds into the adjacent ﬂuid which is moving. Convection is this combination of
conduction at the surface and heat transport into the moving ﬂuid.
There are two main classiﬁcations of convection: forced convection and natural (or free)
convection. In forced convection, there is a device causing signiﬁcant ﬂuid motion. This could be a fan
or blower for gases or a pump for liquids. Or, it could be the wind blowing on a building on a windy
day. In natural convection, there is no device. The ﬂuid motion is gentler and is caused by buoyancy
effects in the ﬂuid caused by thermal expansion.
It has been observed that the rate of heat transfer by convection depends on the difference in
temperature of the surface and the ﬂuid. In addition, there are several other factors which inﬂuence the
heat transfer. These include the motion of the ﬂuid, the thermal and physical properties of the ﬂuid, and
the geometry and orientation in space of the surface.
The equation for convection, Newton’s law of cooling, is
q ¼ hAðTs  TNÞ
(1.9)
In this equation, named for English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and theologian Sir Isaac
Newton (1643e1727), q is the rate of heat ﬂow, A is the surface area in contact with the ﬂuid, Ts is the
temperature of the surface, TN is the temperature of the ﬂuid, and h is the convective coefﬁcient. If we
are using the SI unit system, then “h” has the units of W/m2 C. In the English system, the units are Btu/
h ft2 F.
Eq. (1.9) looks simple. It really isn’t! The convective coefﬁcient h is a complex parameter which
depends on the several factors mentioned above. In some cases, it also depends on the temperature
difference between the surface and the ﬂuid.

Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

In general, h values are greater for liquids than for gases. And, they are greater for forced con-
vection than for natural convection. Table 1.2 illustrates this generality for the situation of convection
from a heated horizontal cylinder.
We will learn in Chapters 6 and 7 how to determine the convective coefﬁcient for a variety of
situations. Until then, h values will be provided for problems involving convection.
Example 1.2
House wall with conduction and convection
Problem
A house wall is 8 feet high and 20 feet wide. It is 5 inches thick and has a thermal conductivity of 0.017 Btu/h ft F. It is
winter and we want to determine the convective coefﬁcient h on the outside surface of the wall. The temperatures of the
inside and outside surfaces of the wall are measured and found to be 72 and 28 F, respectively. The outside air temperature
is measured, and it is 25 F. What is the convective coefﬁcient on the outside surface of the wall?
Solution
As the wall area is large, we will assume one-dimensional heat transfer, with the heat ﬂow from the inside surface of the
wall to the outside air.
The rate of heat conduction through the wall is given by Eq. (1.8):
q ¼ kA
L ðT1  T2Þ
Dividing the heat ﬂow q by cross-sectional area A, we get the heat ﬂux through the wall:
q
A ¼ k
L ðT1  T2Þ
For this problem,
k ¼ 0:017 Btu = h ft F
T1 ¼ 72 F
T2 ¼ 28 F
L ¼ 5 in  1 ft
12 in ¼ 0:41667 ft
There is convection from the outer surface of the wall to the outside air. The rate of convection is given by Eq. (1.9):
q ¼ hAðTs  TNÞ

There is energy conservation at the outer surface of the wall. That is, the heat ﬂux into the surface by conduction equals the
heat ﬂux out of the surface by convection. From the above equations,
q

Putting values in this equation, we have

0:41667 ð72  28Þ ¼ hð28  25Þ
Solving for h, we get h [ 0.598 Btu/h ft2 F.
(Note: The h’s on the two sides of this result are different. The italic one on the left side is the convective coefﬁcient. The
one on the right side is the unit “hours.”)
The convective coefﬁcient on the outside surface of the wall is 0.598 Btu/h ft2 F.
Example 1.3
Fins on a surface
Problem
Fins are often added to a surface to enhance heat transfer. The subject of ﬁns and extended surfaces is discussed in detail in
Chapter 3. There are many different geometries of ﬁns. This example deals with a single cylindrical ﬁn, a “pin” ﬁn, as
shown in Fig. 1.3.
An aluminum pin ﬁn with a 0.3 cm diameter and a length of 10 cm is attached to a wall whose surface is at 180 C. The
conductivity of the ﬁn is 230 W/m C. The convective coefﬁcient between the ﬁn and the room air is 50 W/m2 C and the
room air is at 22 C. What is the rate at which heat ﬂows into the ﬁn from the wall, and what is the heat ﬂow rate in the ﬁn at
a distance of 3 cm from the wall?
Note: The temperature distribution in the ﬁn can be considered to be one-dimensional in the direction of the ﬁn’s axis and,
as we will show in Chapter 3, is given by:

Solution
This ﬁn problem illustrates a situation including both conduction and convection. At the wall, heat ﬂows into the ﬁn by
conduction. The heat is conducted axially through the ﬁn from its point of attachment at the wall to its free end. Heat also
goes from the surface of the ﬁn, along its whole length, to the room air by convection.

Note: The heat ﬂows are both positive, so they are both in the positive x direction.
The heat ﬂow rate into the ﬁn at the wall is 4.37 W. The heat ﬂow rate in the ﬁn at a distance of 3 cm from the wall is
2.62 W.
Discussion: From the wall to the location 3 cm from the wall, the conduction has decreased from 4.37 to 2.62 W, a dif-
ference of 1.75 W. From energy conservation, this 1.75 W is the rate at which heat is ﬂowing by convection from the sur-
face of the ﬁn to the room air over the ﬁrst 3 cm length of the ﬁn.
1.5 Radiation
All surfaces emit thermal radiation. The rate of emission depends on the absolute temperature and
characteristics of the surface.
A black surface is an ideal surface which emits the highest possible amount of thermal radiation.
For a black surface emitting in accordance with Planck’s law, the rate of thermal radiant emission is
qb ¼ sAT4
(1.11)
where qb is the rate of radiant energy emission, A is the area of the surface, T is the absolute temperature
(Kelvin or Rankine) of the surface, and s is the StefaneBoltzmann constant ¼ 5.67  108 W/m2
K4 ¼ 0.1714  108 Btu/h ft2 R4.
Real surfaces emit less radiation than ideal black surfaces. The surface property related to the
emission of real surfaces is the emissivity, ε, which is the ratio of the power emitted by a real surface to
1.5 Radiation
9

the power emitted by an ideal black surface at the same temperature. For a black surface, ε ¼ 1. It is
lower for real surfaces.
Table 1.3 gives typical emissivity values for different surfaces. Additional values are given in
Appendix F.
We are usually primarily concerned with the net transfer of radiant energy between surfaces. Like
conduction and convection, a temperature difference is needed for heat ﬂow to occur. However, unlike
conduction and convection, no physical material is needed to transfer heat via thermal radiation. The
radiation is transmitted as an electromagnetic wave. It passes undiminished through a vacuum and is
negligibly affected by many gases (e.g., air).
Radiant heat transfer between surfaces depends on the absolute temperatures of the surfaces, the
emissivities of the surfaces, the geometries of the surfaces, and the orientation of the surfaces with
respect to each other. This can be described by the equation
q
A ¼ sFG;ε

T4

(1.12)
where FG,ε is a function of the emissivities, geometries, and orientations of the surfaces.
Radiant heat transfer is a complex subject treated in more detail in Chapter 9. One special case of
practical interest is shown in Fig. 1.4. This is the case in which a heated convex object radiates to the
surfaces of a large surrounding enclosure.

Example 1.4
Convection and Radiation from a Cylinder
Problem
A heated aluminum cylinder (k ¼ 237 W/m K) is 5 cm diameter and 1 m long. The temperature of its surface is 200 C. The
cylinder is in a room where the air temperature is 20 C and the temperature of the room walls is 15 C. The emissivity of the
cylinder’s surface is 0.5 and the convective coefﬁcient at the surface is 25 W/m2 C. What is the heat ﬂow from the side of
the cylinder by convection and radiation?
Solution
The temperatures for the convective heat transfer can remain in Celsius (C), but the temperatures must be in absolute tem-
perature Kelvin (K) for the radiant heat transfer as follows:
TN ¼ room air temperature ¼ 20 C.
Ts ¼ surface temperature ¼ 200 C ¼ 200 þ 273.15 ¼ 473.15 K.
Tsurr ¼ temperature of the room walls ¼ 15 C ¼ 15 þ 273.15 ¼ 288.15 K.
The area of the side of the cylinder is A ¼ p D L ¼ p (0.05 m) (1 m) ¼ 0.1571 m2.
The convective heat transfer is

¼ 192.5 W
The heat ﬂow from the side of the cylinder by convection is 707.0 W. The heat ﬂow by radiation is 192.5 W.
Comments: Radiant heat transfer depends on temperature to the fourth power and becomes very signiﬁcant at high tem-
peratures. As the temperatures in this problem are quite low, the radiation heat transfer is small compared to the convective
heat transfer. The radiant heat transfer could be signiﬁcantly reduced by polishing the cylinder, thereby reducing the emis-
sivity to 0.1 or less. Also, because the convection and radiation occur at the cylinder’s surface, the information given about
the material of the cylinder and the conductivity are extraneous and not relevant to the problem. (They would have been
relevant if the problem had dealt with conduction within the cylinder.) Engineers often encounter situations in which a
surplus of information is available. Judgments must be made as to which items of information are relevant to the speciﬁc
situation. On the other hand, engineers often have to make educated judgments for required information that has not been
provided in the problem statement.
1.6 The direction of heat ﬂow
Heat ﬂow is a vector quantity. It has direction and magnitude. In Eq. (1.2) for conduction, we added a
minus sign so that heat ﬂow in the positive n direction would be positive and heat ﬂow in the negative n
direction would be negative.
For example, if heat is ﬂowing in the positive n direction, then vT/vn is negative because heat ﬂows
from a higher temperature toward a lower temperature. The minus sign is needed to make qn positive.
1.6 The direction of heat ﬂow
11

Likewise, if heat is ﬂowing in the negative n direction, then vT/vn is positive and the minus sign makes
qn negative.
The direction of heat ﬂow must also be considered for convection and radiation. Consider, for
example, Eq. (1.9) for convection:
Say that heat is ﬂowing from the surface to the ﬂuid, as shown in Fig. 1.3.
In this case, Ts > TN, and Eq. (1.9) is appropriate because it makes the heat ﬂow positive in the
direction it is actually ﬂowing. But, if the heat were ﬂowing from the ﬂuid to the surface, then the
equation should be revised to make the heat ﬂow positive in the direction it is actually ﬂowing. That is,
if TN > Ts we should revise Eq. (1.9) to
q ¼ hAðTN  TsÞ
(1.14)
Heat ﬂow direction must also be considered when formulating equations for radiative heat transfer.
1.7 Temperature continuity and heat balances
Due to the broadness of the subject of heat transfer, it is usual to separate heat transfer into its three
modes and study conduction, convection, and radiation separately. While advantageous for the
learning process, one has to keep in mind that many practical problems involve not only one but often
two or all three of the modes occurring simultaneously.
For example, consider an electric cartridge heater inside a block of metal sitting on a table in a
room. This is shown in Fig. 1.5.
When the power to the heater is turned on, heat starts to ﬂow into the block, thereby raising its
temperature. The temperature of the block will become greater than that of the air in the room, and
there will be heat transfer by convection from the exposed surface of the block to the air. There will
also be heat transfer by radiation from the exposed surface of the block to the walls and ceiling of the
room. And, because the temperature of the block will become greater than the temperature of the table,
there will be conduction from the block into the table.
There will be continuity of temperature at the exposed surface of the block in contact with the air.
That is, the temperature of the exposed surface of the block and the temperature of the air at the surface
will be the same. Disregarding any contact resistance between the block and the tabletop, the tem-
perature of the block’s surface in contact with the tabletop will be the same as that of the tabletop.

Surroundings

FIGURE 1.5

Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

There will also be continuity of heat ﬂows. The rate of heat ﬂow by conduction reaching the
exposed surface of the block will be equal to the rate of heat ﬂow leaving the block by convection and
radiation.
Regarding the surface in contact with the tabletop, the rate of heat ﬂow by conduction within the
block reaching the tabletop will equal the rate of heat ﬂow by conduction into the table.
If the electric power to the heater remains constant, the temperatures and heat ﬂows will eventually
stabilize and reach steady state. When this happens, we can do an energy balance on the block. We can
state that the electric power to the heater equals the rate of heat transfer from the block’s exposed
surface to the air by convection and to the surroundings by radiation plus the rate of heat transfer by
conduction from the block to the tabletop.
qpower ¼ qconduction to table þ qconvection to air þ qradiation to surroundings
(1.15)
Example 1.5
Heat Balance
Problem
Consider again Fig. 1.5 which depicts a metal block with an internal cartridge heater. The block rests on a tabletop. It
convects to the room air, radiates to the surroundings, and conducts to the tabletop. The block is 6 inches by 6 inches
by 6 inches and has a 300 W internal electric heater. The room air and the surroundings are at 72 F. The convective co-
efﬁcient is 5 Btu/h ft2 F and the emissivity of the block’s exposed surfaces is 0.4. It can be assumed that the heat ﬂow by
conduction to the tabletop is negligible. What is the average temperature of the exposed surfaces of the block?
Solution
Eq. (1.15) gives the heat balance for the block. At steady state, the power into the heater equals the sum of the convection to
the room air, the radiation to the surroundings, and the conduction to the tabletop.
The givens of the problem are
Tsurr ¼ 72 F ¼ 72 þ 459.67 ¼ 531.67 R ðRankineÞ
TN ¼ 72 F ¼ 531.67 R
h ¼ 5 Btu = h ft2 F
ε ¼ 0:4
qpower ¼ 300 W  ð3.412 Btu = hÞ = W ¼ 1023.6 Btu = h
The exposed area of the block is A ¼ 5 sides  (6  6) ¼ 180 in2 ¼ 1.25 ft2.
Let the unknown temperature of the exposed surfaces be Ts.
The convective heat transfer is
qconv ¼ hAðTs  TNÞ ¼ ð5Þð1:25ÞðTs  531:67Þ ¼ 6:25ðTs  531:67Þ

So, we have qpower  qconv  qrad ¼ 0.

Reducing this equation, we get the following equation to solve for Ts:
8:57  1010T4
s þ 6:25Ts  4415 ¼ 0
We can solve this through several techniques. One way is to use trial and error. A guess is made for Ts and the left-hand side
of the equation is evaluated. The result is compared to the right-hand side, which is zero. If the left-hand side is not zero, a
new guess is made for Ts and the procedure is repeated. Iterations are made until the left-hand side is zero.
A more efﬁcient solution of the equation is through the use of the Goal Seek feature of Microsoft Excel. This useful feature
is discussed in Appendix J.
It is found that the average temperature of the exposed surfaces of the block is
Ts ¼ 677.51 R ¼ 677.51  459.67 ¼ 218 F.
The average temperature of the exposed surfaces of the block is 218 F.
1.8 Unit systems
Problems in this book use either the SI unit system or the English Engineering unit system. Most
problems use SI. Conversion factors are located on the inside front cover of the book for easy
reference.
Unit conversion is really quite simple. One starts with the item to be converted and merely keeps
multiplying it by unity factors until the desired units are reached. For example, say we want to convert
10 Watts to BTU/day. We have
10 W 
3:412 Btu

 24

One common area of confusion pertains to temperature. The confusion is with respect to
temperature levels versus temperature units. Temperature levels are determined by the following
equations:
Celsius to Kelvin:
K ¼ C þ 273.15
Fahrenheit to Rankine:
R ¼ F þ 459.67
Celsius to Fahrenheit:
F ¼ 9
5 C þ 32
Fahrenheit to Celsius:
C ¼ 5
9 ðF  32Þ
Temperature levels in the four temperature scales are usually quite different. One notable exception
is that 40 C ¼ 40 F.
Things are quite different when we are considering the units of physical and thermal properties. The
size of a Fahrenheit degree is the same as the size of a Rankine degree, and the size of a Celsius degree is
the same as the size of a Kelvin degree. For example, a thermal conductivity of 150 W/m C is same as a
conductivity of 150 W/m K. And a speciﬁc heat of 0.2 Btu/lbm F is the same as 0.2 Btu/lbm R.
14
Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

One must remember that there is no need to convert numerical values from Celsius to Kelvin or
from Fahrenheit to Rankine when the temperatures are within the units of the various material
properties. However, it is of course necessary to convert the numerical values when we are considering
temperature levels.
The size of a Fahrenheit (or Rankine) degree is smaller than the size of a Celsius (or Kelvin) degree.
Let us consider the freezing and boiling points of water. Water at atmospheric pressure freezes at 32 F
and boils at 212 F. There are 180 Fahrenheit degrees between the two points. For Celsius, water freezes
at 0 C and boils at 100 C. There are 100 Celsius degrees between freezing and boiling. Therefore, a
difference of 180 Fahrenheit degrees is equivalent to a difference of 100 Celsius degrees. A Fahrenheit
degree is (100/180) ¼ (5/9) the size of a Celsius degree. If we have a temperature difference in
Fahrenheit degrees, the equivalent temperature difference in Celsius degrees is 5/9 that of the
Fahrenheit degree difference.
Finally, we must remember that absolute temperature units (Kelvin or Rankine) must be used for
problems involving thermal radiation.
1.9 Recommended approach to problem solving
In solving an engineering problem, be it a problem at the end of the chapters in this book or a general
problem in engineering, people often have the urge to solve the problem as quickly as possible, and
they immediately start writing equations and inserting numbers. This approach should be avoided.
Rather, the approach outlined below is recommended. This approach appears to be slower, but it
actually is more efﬁcient because it avoids having to go back and redo hastily and ill-performed steps.
Step 1 - Problem deﬁnition
This is perhaps the most important step. We need to clearly understand the objective of the problem.
What are we looking for? If we get this step wrong, then we may have a perfect solution, but it is not
relevant to the problem we want to solve! Write the objective of the problem in one or two sentences.
Step 2 - Problem givens
List the information given in the problem statement. In textbook problems, there is usually just enough
information given to solve the problem, and there is no extraneous information. This is really unlike
problems which you will encounter in the “real world.”
In those problems, there is often an excess of information and you will have to determine which
parts of this information are relevant to your problem. (Indeed, we included some extraneous infor-
mation in Example 1.4 above and we will do this occasionally in the end-of-chapter problems.)
Step 3 - Determine the appropriate equations
Considering the problem deﬁnition and the givens, determine the analytical equations appropriate for
the problem. For example, what modes of heat transfer are involved? Do we have conduction,
convection, or radiation, or a combination of modes? Is the heat transfer one-, two-, or three-
dimensional? Is the heat transfer steady state or transient? List the equations.
1.9 Recommended approach to problem solving
15

Step 4 - Obtain the solution
Put values into the equations and obtain numerical solutions. Make sure that you include units with
your numerical results! State the result in a sentence or two.
Step 5 - Review the solution
This ﬁnal step is of major importance! Consider your solution. Look at the problem deﬁnition and
assure yourself that you have solved the correct problem. And, is the numerical result reasonable? Are
the magnitudes of the results consistent with the magnitudes of the problem givens? For example, if
your problem was to determine the temperature at a point in a metal plate, and your answer was 900 C
when the surrounding air was at 20 C, and there are no internal heat sources or heaters in the problem,
then perhaps something is wrong. Perhaps you made an error in your calculations. Check the equations
and the values you put into them. Also, check that the correct units were used.
The above procedure is a methodical way of solving heat transfer problems. Indeed, the procedure
is also very applicable to other areas of engineering. It is highly recommended that the procedure be
followed as much as possible. Getting into a methodical mindset will serve you well in your engi-
neering career.
1.10 Signiﬁcant ﬁgures
There is a great tendency on the part of students (and often engineers) to retain too many signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in a ﬁnal answer. Indeed, calculators provide 10 or more digits and computers have even more.
Why not include all of the digits in a ﬁnal answer? Well, inclusion of all the digits is usually
inappropriate because of the inaccuracies and uncertainties inherent in all engineering calculations.
First, simpliﬁcations are often made in the problem statement and the analysis technique. For example,
surfaces are taken as being perfectly insulated; thermal resistances of thin metal walls are neglected;
multidimensional heat ﬂows are assumed to be one-dimensional.
Inaccuracies also occur with the use of tabulated material property data from reference sources.
Perhaps such data were obtained under stringent laboratory conditions which are inconsistent with
your application. And perhaps you were unable to ﬁnd the material properties for your particular
material and therefore substituted the properties of a similar material. (Of course, these concerns are
minimized if tests are conducted on your actual specimens, but such is usually not the case.)
As another example, inaccuracies may be introduced through use of empirical correlations
presented in reference sources; e.g., correlations for the convective coefﬁcient “h.” Such correlations
may have been from carefully controlled laboratory experiments. Your conditions may differ
considerably from the conditions under which the data were obtained.
In short, one must be careful to not include an excess of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a ﬁnal answer. Too
many ﬁgures imply that you know the result with more precision than you actually do. For example, an
answer of 24.373 C implies that the solution is accurate to one-thousandth of a degree. Such is usually
not the case. A good rule of thumb for textbook problems and most engineering problems is the
following: If an answer begins with "1", give the answer to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures; if it begins with any
other digit, give the answer to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For example, 1.78425 would become 1.784 and
5.8957 would become 5.90. Of course, this rule of thumb only pertains to the ﬁnal answer of a
16
Chapter 1 Introduction to heat transfer

problem. Intermediate calculations leading up to the ﬁnal answer should use considerably more sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgures to not introduce inaccuracies through rounding.
Signiﬁcant ﬁgures are discussed in many freshman engineering and data analysis texts. Two such
texts are given in Refs. [3,4].
1.11 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
This chapter provided an introduction to the study of heat transfer. The three modes of heat transfer
(conduction, convection, and radiation) were discussed, and basic equations for each mode were
presented. The concepts of temperature continuity and heat balance were discussed. Finally, there were
discussions of unit systems, problem-solving techniques, and signiﬁcant ﬁgures. These last three topics
are pertinent not only to heat transfer, but to most other areas of engineering.
We end this chapter with a word of caution. A lot of useful information is available on the Internet.
Most is accurate, but some is not. Use material only from reputable sources. Some such sources are
government ofﬁces (e.g., NIST) and standards/professional organizations (e.g., ASTM, ASME,
ASHRAE, IEEE, ANSI). Reputable manufacturing companies are also a useful source of information.
It is good to compare information from different Internet sources to gain conﬁdence regarding the
accuracy of the information.

2.1 Introduction
Chapter 1 brieﬂy described the three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. In
this chapter, we will look closely at the theoretical aspects of conduction. In particular, we will discuss
the governing differential equations and boundary condition equations whose solution will give us the
temperature distribution in the body and ultimately the heat ﬂow rates at different points in the body.

We will also discuss the initial condition equations that are needed if the problem is time-dependent,
i.e., nonesteady state.
2.2 Heat conduction equation
The heat conduction equation is a partial differential equation for conduction of heat through a body.
The solution of the equation gives the temperature distribution in the body at different instances of
time. As discussed in Chapter 1, differentiation of the temperature distribution will give the heat ﬂows
at the various locations in the body.
The heat conduction equation is derived for the rectangular (i.e., Cartesian) coordinate system. The
equation is then presented for cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems.
2.2.1 Rectangular coordinates
In this section, we will derive the differential equation describing the temperature distribution in a
body. (By “body” we mean a solid or an essentially nonmoving ﬂuid. In this text, “body” is synon-
ymous with “object” or “material”.)
Let us consider an inﬁnitesimal element in the object as shown in Fig. 2.1. The element has di-
mensions dx, dy, and dz and is located at coordinates x, y, and z, respectively.
Fig. 2.1 shows heat ﬂows into the element of qx þ qy þ qz and heat ﬂows out of the element of
qxþdx þ qyþdy þ qzþdz. For example, for the x direction: At location x, the incoming heat ﬂow is qx,
and at location x þ dx, the outgoing heat ﬂow is qxþdx.
In addition to heat ﬂowing in and out of the element, there may be heat generated within the
element. For example, an electrical current passing through a wire or busbar will cause resistance (or
Joule) heating in the material. Water added to cement will result in hydration, an exothermic heat-
producing chemical reaction. Heat is also produced through ﬁssion in nuclear fuel elements. Such

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

heat-generating phenomena occur within the material, and the rate of heat generation is usually
proportional to the volume of the material.
The heat ﬂows and generation will, in the most general situation, vary with location in the body and
also with time. If there is no variation with time, the heat transfer is “steady” On the other hand, if there
is variation with time, the heat transfer is “unsteady” Special cases of unsteady heat transfer are
transient and periodic.
So, we have heat ﬂowing in and out of the boundaries of the inﬁnitesimal element and possibly also
heat input to the material by internal heat generation. If more heat goes into the element than leaves,
then the internal energy of the material in the element will increase. If more heat leaves the element
than enters, then the internal energy will decrease. Increased internal energy means an increase in
temperature, and decreased internal energy means a decrease in temperature. A word equation may be
written for the energy balance on the element as follows:
Rate of Heat Flow In  Rate of Heat Flow Out þ Rate of Heat Generation
¼ Rate of Increase in Internal Energy
(2.1)
The incoming heat ﬂow rate is qx þ qy þ qz.
The outgoing heat ﬂow rate is qxþdx þ qyþdy þ qzþdz.
The rate of heat generation is qgendV, where qgen is the generation rate per unit volume and dV is
the volume of the element (i.e., dxdy dz).
And the rate of increase in internal energy is mass (i.e., density r times volume dxdydz) times
speciﬁc heat c times change of temperature per unit time.

In addition, qxþdx is qx plus the change in qx over a distance dx. Mathematically, this is

This Taylor expansion can be done similarly for the y and z directions.

the terms, results in the heat conduction equation:

Solution of this equation will give the temperature distribution T(x,y,z,t) in the body at different
instances of time. To solve the equation, it has to be combined with appropriate boundary conditions
that are discussed in Section 2.3 below. And, if the situation is nonesteady state, appropriate initial
conditions are needed. These initial conditions are discussed in Section 2.4 below.
2.2.1.1 Special casesdrectangular coordinates
The general heat conduction Eq. (2.3) can often be simpliﬁed. For example, if the problem is
steady state, the vT
vt term is zero. If there is no heat generation within the material, then qgen is zero.
2.2 Heat conduction equation

In addition, in many cases, all three dimensions are not needed to accurately model a problem. For
example, the wall of a building can often be modeled as one-dimensional, as shown in Example 2.1:
Example 2.1
Heat Flow Through a Wall
Problem:
To design air conditioning and heating systems for a building, it is necessary to determine the heating and cooling loads for
various components of the building’s envelope. Heat ﬂow through walls is often a major contributor to the loads. Let us say
we wish to determine the heat ﬂow through the wall shown in Fig. 2.2. We can determine the temperature distribution in the
wall by solving a simpliﬁed version of Eq. (2.3). The obtained temperature function can then be differentiated to get the
heat ﬂow through the wall. The task is to determine the appropriate version of the heat conduction equation for this
situation.
Solution:
Eq. (2.3) can be simpliﬁed as follows: The heat ﬂow is essentially one-dimensional as the wall area is large compared with
the wall thickness. In addition, the wall material does not generate heat. Finally, steady-state heat ﬂow is typically used in
load calculations.
Therefore, in Eq. (2.3), vT
vt ¼ 0;
qgen ¼ 0; and the y and z directional terms are zero. Eq. (2.3) thus simpliﬁes to
d

Another usual simpliﬁcation is that thermal conductivity k is constant. This results in the ﬁnal equation

Example 2.2
Heat Flow in a Thin Plate
As another example, let us consider conduction in a thin plate situated in the x-y plane, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
Problem:
Determine the heat conduction equation for a thin, ﬂat plate.
Solution:
Like Example 2.1, all three dimensions are not needed to properly describe the temperature distribution in a thin plate.
There is temperature variation in the x and y directions, but, as the plate is thin, there is negligible temperature variation
in the z direction. Only two dimensions are needed to properly describe the temperature distribution. At a point “A” in the
plate, there are heat ﬂow components qx and qy: However, qz is zero. If the heat transfer is steady, Eq. (2.3) simpliﬁes to

2.2.2 Cylindrical coordinates
Cylindrical coordinates are used for problems involving cylinders. A point in a body in cylindrical
coordinates is located by r, 4, and z, which are radius, azimuthal angle, and axial distance, respec-
tively. These dimensions for a point “Aˮ are shown in Fig. 2.4.

The heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates can be obtained from the rectangular
coordinate equation, Eq. (2.3), through coordinate transformation using the following relations be-
tween the parameters of the two coordinate systems. These relations are
x ¼ r cos 4
y ¼ r sin 4
z ¼ z
The heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates can also be obtained by an energy balance
on a cylindrical element, similar to what was done for the rectangular element in Section 2.2.1. A
cylindrical element is shown in Fig. 2.5.

With the application of appropriate boundary and initial conditions, this equation can be solved, at
least in theory, for the temperature distribution in a cylinder at different instances of time.
Example 2.3
Heat Flow in a Wire
Problem:
Electrical current is ﬂowing through the wire shown in Fig. 2.6 below. This ﬂow causes uniform heat generation (i.e., Joule
heating) due to the wire’s resistance. The heat ﬂows and temperatures in the wire are steady, and the conductivity k is con-
stant. As the wire is long, the axial heat ﬂow is negligible.

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

Heat ﬂows by conduction radially into the volume at r and radially out of the volume at r þ dr. There is also a heat input to
the volume by heat generation (i.e., Joule heating). As the problem is steady state, the heat ﬂow rate into the volume equals
the heat ﬂow rate out of the volume, that is, the heat balance on the volume element is
Heat Flow Rate In By Conduction þ Heat Flow Rate In By Generation ¼ Heat Flow Rate Out By Conduction
(2.26)
The incoming heat ﬂow rate by conduction is qr and the outgoing heat ﬂow rate by conduction is qrþdr. The area for heat
ﬂow at location r is dA ¼ 2 p r dz and the volume of the element is dV ¼ 2pr dr dz. The heat generation rate is qgen per unit
volume.
Eq. (2.26) thus becomes

However, as qrþdr ¼ qr þ vqr

2.2 Heat conduction equation

Note that the ﬁnal heat conduction equation for this problem, Eq. (2.25) or (2.32), could have been obtained directly from
the cylindrical heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.9), by eliminating 4 and z variations and assuming steady state and con-
stant conductivity k.

For example, if the problem is steady state, then the vT
vt term is zero. If there is no heat generation by
the material, then qgen is zero. And, if the conductivity k is constant, it can be taken outside the pa-
rentheses and then each term of the equation can simply be divided by k. Finally, in some problems, the
temperature distribution may not depend on all three dimensions. Those terms relating to
the nondependent dimensions can then be deleted from Eq. (2.9). For example, in Example 2.3 above,
the 4 and z terms could be deleted, the conductivity k was constant, and the problem was steady state.
2.2.3 Spherical coordinates
Spherical coordinates are used for problems involving spheres. A point “A” in a body in spherical
coordinates is located by radius r, azimuthal angle 4, and polar angle q as shown in Fig. 2.8.

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

The heat conduction equation in spherical coordinates can be obtained from the rectangular co-
ordinate equation, Eq. (2.3), through coordinate transformation using the following relations between
the parameters of the two coordinate systems:
x ¼ r cos 4 sin q
y ¼ r sin 4 sin q
z ¼ r cos q
The heat conduction equation can also be obtained by an energy balance on a spherical element,
which is shown in Fig. 2.9.

The general heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.33), can often be simpliﬁed to ﬁt a speciﬁc problem. For
example, if the problem is steady state, then the vT
vt term is zero. If there is no internal heat generation
by the material, then qgen is zero. If there is no angular dependence, the terms involving 4 and q can be
deleted. Finally, if conductivity k is constant, it can be taken outside the parentheses and then each term
of the equation can simply be divided by k.

Example 2.4
Radioactive Material in a Spherical Cask
Problem:
A spherical cask is ﬁlled with radioactive material. The material is initially at temperature T1 and is generating heat
uniformly at a constant rate of qgen per unit volume. The conductivity k of the radioactive material is uniform and constant.
The cask is thin-walled and has a radius of r1. The outer surface of the cask is convecting heat to the surrounding air with a
convective coefﬁcient h. The air is at temperature TN. Radiative heat transfer from the cask is negligible.
What is the temperature of the material at a distance of x meters from the center of the cask y minutes after the cask is
ﬁlled?
Note: Only determine the appropriate heat conduction equation for the problem. Do not attempt to solve the problem.
Solution:
To solve this problem, the ﬁrst task is to determine the appropriate heat conduction equation. After this is done, boundary
and initial conditions can be applied, and the heat conduction equation can be solved for the temperature distribution in the
material at various instances of time.
In this example, we will just determine the heat conduction equation. Solution of the equation is discussed in later sections
of this book.
The container is spherical, so the appropriate general heat conduction equation is Eq. (2.33):

There is indeed heat generation by the radioactive material and the problem deals with time-dependence. However, the
conductivity is constant, so it may be taken outside the parentheses in the ﬁrst term. All of the terms in the equation
can then be divided by k.
Also, the thermal diffusivity is deﬁned as a ¼ k

2.3 Boundary conditions
The heat conduction equations of Section 2.2 apply to the interior parts of the body. In this section, we
discuss the conditions at the boundaries of the body. The combination of the heat conduction equation
and the boundary condition equations for a body may be solved to determine the temperature distri-
bution in the body. (Note: If the problem is unsteady state, initial conditions are also needed for the
solution. These conditions are discussed in Section 2.4 below.)
Once the temperature distribution is obtained, it can be differentiated using the equations of
Chapter 1 to determine the heat ﬂows at different locations in the body. For example, if the temperature
distribution T(x,y,z) is known at a particular instant of time, then, from Eq. (1.3), the heat ﬂow rate per
unit area in the x direction at the different points in the body for the particular instant of time is

In developing the boundary condition equations, two items of information must be provided. These
are (a) the location of the boundary using a particular coordinate system and (b) the condition at the
boundary (e.g., speciﬁed temperature, heat ﬂux rate, convection, radiation, etc.).
2.3.1 Rectangular coordinates
Although most of our discussion deals with boundary condition equations for the rectangular coor-
dinate system, similar equations can easily be developed for cylindrical and spherical geometries.
These other geometries are discussed in Section 2.3.2.
Let us consider the plane wall of Fig. 2.2 shown earlier and repeated here. The wall has a thickness
L in the x direction and large extents in the y and z directions.
We will now proceed to obtain boundary equations for several different conditions at the x ¼ 0 and
x ¼ L boundaries of the wall.
2.3.1.1 Speciﬁed temperature
As shown in Fig. 2.10, the left side of the wall is at temperature T1 and the right side is at temperature
T2. The boundary condition equations are
At x ¼ 0; T ¼ T1
(2.36a)
and
At x ¼ L; T ¼ T2

The heat ﬂux at the right side of the wall has a magnitude of C2 and is in the x direction. The
appropriate boundary equation is
At x ¼ L; k vT
vx ¼ C2
(2.39)
2.3.1.3 Insulated boundary
As shown in Fig. 2.12, the right side of the wall is perfectly insulated and qx ¼ 0.
As qx ¼ kA vT
vx and both k and A are nonzero, the boundary equation is
At x ¼ L;
vT
vx ¼ 0
(2.40)
2.3.1.4 Convection
As shown in Fig. 2.13, let us say there is a ﬂuid on the left side of the wall. The ﬂuid is at temperature
TN, and the convective coefﬁcient between the ﬂuid and the wall surface is h. The boundary equation
can be developed using the concept of heat ﬂow continuity at the boundary. That is, at the boundary,
the convective heat ﬂow is equal to the conductive heat ﬂow, or qconv ¼ qcond.
By Eq. (1.3), the conductive heat ﬂow is
qcond ¼  kA vT
vx
By Equation (1.9), the convective heat ﬂow is
qconv ¼ h A ðT  TNÞ
However, in our situation the heat ﬂow is from the ﬂuid to the surface. As discussed in Chapter 1,
the convective ﬂow at the left surface should be written
qconv ¼ h A ðTN  TÞ

Hence, the boundary equation is, after canceling A from both sides of the equation,

(2.41)
2.3.1.5 Radiation
Let us say that the wall of Fig. 2.14 is in a vacuum, so there is no convective heat transfer at the wall
surfaces. But, let us have radiation heat transfer at both surfaces. The surroundings to the left of the
wall are at Tsurr1 and the left surface of the wall has an emissivity ε1. The surroundings to the right of
the wall are at Tsurr2, and the right surface of the wall has an emissivity ε2. Radiation heat transfer is

this section, that equation is

where Ts is the temperature of the surface, and Tsurr is the temperature of the surroundings. Note that
both temperatures must be in absolute temperature units, i.e., Kelvin or Rankine.
Regarding the boundaries at x ¼ 0 and x ¼ L: At the wall surfaces, there is heat ﬂow continuity.
That is, the heat ﬂow by conduction equals the heat ﬂow by radiation. Let us assume that all the
conduction and radiation heat ﬂows are in the þx direction as shown in Fig. 2.14. The boundary
equations at the two surfaces are then
At x ¼ 0; qrad1 ¼ qcond1
At x ¼ L; qcond2 ¼ qrad2
This gives, after canceling the area A on both sides of the equations,

convective heat transfer on both surfaces. There is also radiative heat transfer between both surfaces
and their respective surroundings.
At the left surface, the conduction heat transfer is equal to the sum of the convective and radiative
heat transfers. The same continuity of heat ﬂows concept applies to the right surface. The boundary
equations are

The area A can be deleted from the two equations as it is in all the terms.
Again, in writing the boundary equations, pay particular attention to the assumed directions of the
heat ﬂows so that the terms in the equations will have the correct signs.
Let us continue to discuss this boundary condition where convection occurs together with radiation.
Ts is the temperature of the surface, TN is the ﬂuid temperature, and Tsurr is the temperature of the
surroundings. The total heat ﬂow at the boundary is the sum of the convective heat ﬂow qconv and the
radiative heat ﬂow qrad, where

It would be nice to convert Eq. (2.48) into an equation that has a difference in temperature rather
than a difference in temperature to the fourth power. This can be done by introducing a new coefﬁcient

Having deﬁnedhrad, we can now write the total heat ﬂow at the surface as

(2.52)
In many practical situations, the ﬂuid temperature is about the same as the temperature of the
surroundings. If this is the case, we can add convective coefﬁcient h and radiative coefﬁcient hrad to get
a total coefﬁcient htotal ¼ h þ hrad, and the total heat transfer at the surface becomes
qtotal ¼ htotalAðTs  TavgÞ
(2.53)
where Tavg is the average of TN and Tsurr:

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

2.3.1.7 Symmetry conditions
There may be situations where the temperature distribution is symmetrical. For example, consider a
large plate of thickness 2L, which has uniform internal heat generation. At the two surfaces, there is
convection to the adjacent ﬂuids. If the convective coefﬁcients at both surfaces are the same and the
temperatures of the adjacent ﬂuids are the same, then the temperature distribution in the plate will be
symmetrical about the center plane. And, the temperature of the center plane will be the maximum
temperature in the plate.
If the center plane is at x ¼ 0 and the surfaces are at x ¼ L and x ¼ þL, then the symmetry
boundary condition is
At x ¼ 0;
vT
vx ¼ 0
(2.54)
2.3.1.8 Interfacial boundary
Figure 2.16 shows two walls in contact. Wall 1 has a conductivity k1 and a temperature distribution T1.
Wall 2 has a conductivity k2 and a temperature distribution T2.
Both the conductivities and the temperatures may vary with x.
At the interface between the two walls, i.e., at x ¼ L1, there is continuity of temperature if there is
no contact resistance between the walls. We will normally assume this condition of zero contact
resistance. (Note: Contact resistance is discussed in Section 12.3.)
From the temperature continuity, we have the boundary equation
At x ¼ L1;
T1 ¼ T2
(2.55)
There is also continuity of heat ﬂows at the interface, i.e., qcond1 ¼ qcond2. This gives the boundary
equation

2.3.2 Cylindrical and spherical coordinates
Boundary conditions were developed in Section 2.3.1 for the rectangular coordinate system. Similar
equations can be developed for cylindrical and spherical coordinates. For cylindrical objects, the
common boundaries are at radial and axial locations. There are also boundaries at angular locations if
the objects are asymmetrical. If the object is a hollow cylinder, there are boundaries at the inner and
outer surfaces and at the two ends. If it is a solid cylinder, there is only one radial boundary and two
axial boundaries.
A hollow sphere has boundaries at its inner and outer surfaces. A solid sphere has only one
bounding surface.
Possible boundary conditions are similar to those for rectangular coordinates, e.g., speciﬁed
temperature, speciﬁed heat ﬂux, convection, and radiation. If a speciﬁc temperature or heat ﬂux is not
given for a particular boundary, the boundary equation can be obtained by consideration of heat ﬂow
continuity at the boundary. For example, we could have, at a boundary, that conduction equals con-
vection, conduction equals radiation, or conduction equals convection plus radiation.
Example 2.5
Boundary Conditions for a Hollow Cylinder
Consider Fig. 2.17 that shows a hollow cylinder of inner radius r1, outer radius r2, and length L. The boundaries of this
cylinder are the inner surface, the outer surface, and the two ends.
Depending on the speciﬁc problem, many different boundary equations can be developed. The two coordinates of interest
are the radial distance r and the axial distance z. We will set z ¼ 0 at the left end of the cylinder. Then the right end of the
cylinder is at z ¼ L.
Let us say that there is a ﬂuid inside the cylinder at temperature TN1 with a convective coefﬁcient at the inner surface of h1
and a ﬂuid outside the cylinder at temperature TN2 with a convective coefﬁcient at the outer surface of h2. Let us also say
that the two ends of the cylinder are perfectly insulated.

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

The conduction heat transfer in the cylinder in the radial direction r is
qcond ¼  kA vT
vr
(2.58)
Area A, the area through which heat is ﬂowing, increases linearly with r and is A ¼ 2prL.
Thus, from Eq. (2.58), the conduction heat transfer in the þr direction at a distance r from the centerline of the cylinder is
qcond ¼  kð2prLÞ vT
vr
(2.59)
At the inner surface, i.e., at r ¼ r1, the convective heat transfer equals the conduction heat transfer. Hence, the boundary
equation at the inner surface is
kð2pr1LÞ vT
vr ¼ h1ð2pr1LÞðTN1  TÞ
(2.60)
which simplifies to At r ¼ r1;
k vT
vr ¼ h1ðTN1  TÞ
(2.61)
For the outer surface of the cylinder, i.e., at r ¼ r2, the conduction equals the convection. So, the boundary equation,
after canceling area A on both sides of the equation, is
At r ¼ r2;
k vT
vr ¼ h2ðT  TN2Þ
(2.62)
Note: Again, be careful with the convection terms in Eqs. (2.61) and (2.62). In writing the equations, we have assumed that
both the conduction and the convection heat ﬂows are in the þr direction. Hence, for the convection term at the inner sur-
face, we have ðTN TÞ, and for the convection term at the outer surface, we have ðT TNÞ. This was discussed above in
this chapter and in Chapter 1.
The two ends of the cylinder are perfectly insulated with no heat ﬂow. Hence, the boundary equations for the ends are
At z ¼ 0;
vT
vz ¼ 0
(2.63)
At z ¼ L;
vT
vz ¼ 0
(2.64)
2.3.2.1 Symmetry conditions
If the cylinder or sphere under consideration is solid, then there is only one physical boundary in the
radial direction, i.e., at the surface of the cylinder or sphere. However, more than one boundary
equation is needed for solution of the heat conduction equation. In many cases, the temperature dis-
tribution is symmetrical at the center of the cylinder or sphere. For example, when electricity ﬂows
through a wire, there is heating and a symmetrical temperature distribution at the center of the wire.
Cooling of a cylinder or sphere can also result in temperature symmetry at the center. For symmetrical
heating or cooling, there is a temperature maximum or minimum at the center, and the boundary
equation is
At r ¼ 0;
vT
vr ¼ 0
(2.65)
Example 2.6
Cooling of a Heated Sphere
Let us consider the heated sphere of radius r1 shown in Fig. 2.18. The sphere has just come out of an oven. The temperature
of the sphere is initially uniform throughout the sphere, and it is higher than the room air and the surroundings.
The thermal conductivity of the sphere is k. The surface of the sphere has an emissivity ε and a convective coefﬁcient h.
The air is at TN and the surroundings are at Tsurr. The temperature distribution in the sphere is T.
2.3 Boundary conditions

There is heat ﬂow continuity at the surface of the sphere. The heat ﬂow by conduction into the surface equals the heat ﬂow
by convection and radiation from the surface.

(2.70)
We will assume that k is uniform throughout the sphere. Then the temperature distribution during cooling will be symmet-
rical with respect to r. Even though r ¼ 0 is not a physical boundary, we can write the following equation for the symmetry:
At r ¼ 0;
vT
vr ¼ 0
(2.71)
In closing this discussion of boundary equations, let us consider a situation where we have a
boundary condition involving an angular coordinate of a cylinder or sphere. In particular, let us look at
the segment of a cylinder shown in Fig. 2.19.
The segment has inner radius r1, outer radius r2, axial length L, and includes the angle from 4 ¼ 0
to 4 ¼ 41. The 4 ¼ 0 surface is perfectly insulated and the 4 ¼ 41 surface has convection to a ﬂuid at
TN with convection coefﬁcient h.
For the insulated 4 ¼ 0 surface, the heat ﬂow is zero, so the boundary equation is
At 4 ¼ 0;
vT
v4 ¼ 0
(2.72)
For the 4 ¼ 41 surface, the conduction in the þ4 direction equals the convection in that direction.
The boundary equation is

Chapter 2 Heat conduction equation and boundary conditions

Eqs. (2.72) and (2.74) are the boundary equations for the 4 coordinate. To solve the heat conduction
equation for the temperature distribution in the segment, boundary equations will also be needed for
the radial and axial bounding surfaces.
2.4 Initial conditions
Eqs. (2.3), (2.9), and (2.33) are the general heat conduction equations for rectangular, cylindrical, and
spherical coordinates. If the problem is time-dependent, the vT
vt term in the heat conduction equation is
nonzero and initial condition(s) are needed for solution of the equation. Two examples of initial
conditions are as follows:
(1) If all points in the body are at the same temperature Tinit at time zero, then the initial condition
equation is
At t ¼ 0; Tðx; y; zÞ ¼ Tinit
(2.75)
(2) If the temperature distribution in the body is a known function Tinitðx; y; zÞ at time zero, then the
initial condition equation is
At t ¼ 0; Tðx; y; zÞ ¼ Tinitðx; y; zÞ
(2.76)
2.5 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed the partial differential equation governing heat conduction within a body.
The heat conduction equation was presented for rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate
systems. We also discussed boundary and initial condition equations that are used in conjunction with
the heat conduction equation to determine the temperature distribution in the body. Differentiation of
the temperature distribution will give the heat ﬂows at the various points in the body. Eq. (1.3) showed
this for rectangular coordinates. Chapter 3 will give similar equations for cylindrical and spherical
coordinates.
In the next chapter we will solve some of the differential equations developed in this chapter for
steady-state heat transfer.

2.6 Problems
2-1 In the derivation of the rectangular heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.3), it was assumed that
three ﬂows were incoming to the differential element

qx; qy; qz

and three were outgoing

qxþdx; qyþdy; qzþdz

. Redo the derivation assuming that all six ﬂows are incoming to the
element. You should obtain the same heat conduction equation.
2-2 Obtain the cylindrical heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.9), through coordinate transformation
of the rectangular heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.3).
2-3 Obtain the cylindrical heat conduction equation, Eq. (2.9), using the heat-balance approach in
conjunction with the cylindrical element of Fig. 2.5.
For problems 2-4 to 2-8, reduce the rectangular heat conduction equation as much as
possible to ﬁt the problem speciﬁcation. Just give the equation, do not solve it. The general

3.1 Introduction
Chapter 2 discussed the heat conduction equation and the boundary and initial conditions needed to
determine the temperature distribution in a body. In this chapter, we reduce the heat conduction
equation to its one-dimensional and steady-state form. We discuss practical problems that can be
appropriately modeled using only one dimension. Examples of such problems include heat ﬂow
through building walls, ﬂuid and heat ﬂow through pipes, and heat generation in electrical wires. The
very useful resistance concept from electric theory is discussed, as is the conduction shape factor that
can be applied to many unique, practical problems. Finally, there is a discussion of extended surfaces,
i.e., ﬁns. Fins are used in many devices to enhance heat ﬂow.
3.2 One-dimensional conduction
This section discusses conduction in plane walls, cylindrical shells, and spherical shells.
3.2.1 Plane wall
The plane wall shown in Fig. 3.1 has a ﬁnite thickness L in the x direction, is very large in the y and z
directions, and has a cross-sectional area A. The left surface of the wall is at temperature T1 and the
right surface is at T2.
Our tasks are to determine the temperature distribution in the wall and the heat ﬂow rate through the
wall. This can be done as follows:
The general heat conduction equation in the rectangular coordinate system is

with only the x direction. The problem is also steady state. Eq. (3.1) becomes

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

We will ﬁrst consider the situation where the conductivity is constant and there is no heat gen-
eration. Conductivity k can be removed from the bracket and qgen is zero. Eq. (3.2) then reduces to
d2T
dx2 ¼ 0
(3.3)
Integrating Eq. (3.3) twice with respect to x, we obtain
TðxÞ ¼ C1x þ C2
(3.4)
where C1 and C2 are constants.
Looking at Eq. (3.4), it is seen that the temperature distribution in the wall is linear, i.e., straight-
lined, as shown in Fig. 3.2.
To obtain the values of C1 and C2, we have to apply boundary conditions to Eq. (3.4). For our
problem, we have the temperature boundary conditions:
At x ¼ 0; T ¼ T1
(3.5)
and
At x ¼ L; T ¼ T2
(3.6)
Applying these to Eq. (3.4) gives
T1 ¼ C1ð0Þ þ C2
(3.7)
and
T2 ¼ C1L þ C2
(3.8)
Solving Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) for C1 and C2, we get
C1 ¼ ðT2 T1Þ=L and C2 ¼ T1. Substituting this into Eq. (3.4), we get the ﬁnal temperature
distribution in the wall:
TðxÞ ¼

From Eq. (3.9), dT
dx is T2T1
L
so the heat ﬂow rate is
qx ¼ kA
L ðT1  T2Þ
(3.10)
From Fig. 3.2, temperature T1 on the left surface of the wall is greater than temperature T2 on the
right surface. Hence, qx in Eq. (3.10) is positive. In Chapter 1, we discussed the sign convention for
heat ﬂow. Positive qx means that ﬂow is in the positive x direction. This makes sense for our problem.
Heat ﬂows from high temperature to low temperature. The left surface of the wall is at a higher
temperature than the right surface, and the heat is indeed ﬂowing in the þx direction.
3.2.1.1 Multilayered Walls
Sometimes walls consist of multiple layers. Consider, for example, the wall of Fig. 3.3, which has four
layers. The thicknesses of the layers are L1; L2; L3; and L4: The respective conductivities are
k1; k2; k3; and k4: As shown in the ﬁgure, the temperatures at the interfaces and boundaries are
labeled T1 through T5: Finally, the cross-sectional area of the wall is A.
Let us say that there are temperature boundary conditions at the outer surfaces of the wall. The left
surface is held at T1 and the right surface is held at T5. If T1 equals T5, there is no heat ﬂow. If T1 is
greater than T5, heat ﬂows from left to right. And, if T5 is greater than T1; heat ﬂows from right to left.
Let us make T1 greater than T5: Then the heat ﬂow will be from left to right in each layer.
Because of continuity of heat ﬂow, the heat ﬂow q through each of the four layers will be the same,
and Eq. (3.10) can be written for each layer:
q ¼ k1A
L1
ðT1  T2Þ
q ¼ k2A
L2
ðT2  T3Þ
q ¼ k3A
L3
ðT3  T4Þ
q ¼ k4A
L4
ðT4  T5Þ
(3.11)
These four equations can be rearranged so that the temperature differences are on the right-hand
sides of each equation, as follows:

(3.14)
This result leads directly to a discussion of the electric-heat analogy, as follows:
3.2.1.2 Electric-heat analogy and the resistance concept
There is an analogy between the ﬂow of electric current and the ﬂow of heat. The ﬂow of electric
current is caused by a potential difference, and the ﬂow of heat is caused by a temperature difference.
Ohm’s law states that the ﬂow of electric current I in a conductor is proportional to the potential
difference E across the conductor. That is,
I ¼ E
R Ohm’s Law
(3.15)
where R is the resistance of the conductor.
Let us look at Eq. (3.10) that is for the ﬂow of heat through a plane wall. The equation can be
rearranged to
q ¼ T1  T2
 L
kA

(3.16)
Let us compare Eq. (3.15) that is for electric ﬂow and Eq. (3.16) that is for heat ﬂow. It is seen that
the left-hand sides of the equations are the ﬂow rates and the numerators on the right-hand sides are the
potentials causing the ﬂows. Applying the electric-heat analogy, the denominator of the right-hand side
of Eq. (3.15) is the electrical resistance, so the denominator of the right-hand side of Eq. (3.16) must be
the heat ﬂow resistance. That is, the thermal resistance of a plane wall is the thickness of the wall
divided by the product of the conductivity and the area of the wall, or
Rwall ¼ L
kA
(3.17)
Let us look again at Eq. (3.14) for the heat ﬂow through our four-layer wall.
q ¼
T1  T5
 L1
k1A þ L2
k2A þ L3
k3A þ L4


(3.14)
The left-hand side of the equation is the heat ﬂow, and the numerator on the right-hand side is the
temperature difference or potential that is causing the ﬂow. The four terms in the denominator of
the right-hand side are the resistances of the four layers of the wall. The sum of these four resistances is
3.2 One-dimensional conduction
61

the total thermal resistance of the wall, i.e., the sum of the resistances between the two temperatures
causing the ﬂow. This can be generalized to the following equation, which will be very useful in
solving later problems:
q ¼ DToverall
P R
(3.18)
That is, the heat ﬂow rate is the overall temperature difference divided by the sum of the resistances
between the two temperatures.
Example 3.1
Heat Flow Through a Wall
Problem:
The house wall shown in Fig. 3.4 below consists of three layers. The layers, from outside to inside, are T-111 siding
(5/8 inch thick, k ¼ 0.8 Btu in/h ft2 F), ﬁberglass insulation (3-1/2 inch thick, k ¼ 0.27 Btu in/h ft2 F), and plasterboard
(1/2 inch thick, k ¼ 1.2 Btu in/h ft2 F). The wall is 8 ft high by 15 ft wide. The temperature of the outside surface of the
wall is 35 F, and the temperature of the inside surface of the wall is 72 F. Determine the rate of heat ﬂow through the wall
(Btu/h).
Solution:
Let us call the T-111 layer “1", the ﬁberglass layer “2", and the plasterboard layer “3." This is a problem in English units.
The ﬁrst thing to do is to make sure the units are consistent. Usually the best approach is to change all lengths to feet if the
problem is in the English system and all lengths to meters if the problem is SI. For this problem, however, the conductiv-
ities are in units of Btu in/h ft2 F and it is not necessary to change the thicknesses of the layers to feet. They can remain in
inches. However, if the conductivities were given in the usual units of Btu/h ft F, we would have to change the thicknesses
to feet in order for the heat ﬂow to have the units of Btu/h.
To get the heat ﬂow through the wall, we use Eq. (3.18)

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

For a wall, the resistance is L/k A. So, for our problem Eq. (3.18) is
q ¼

(3.19)
where
R1 ¼ L1

The wall is 8 ft high and 15 ft wide, so A ¼ 8  15 ¼ 120 ft2
We therefore arrive at the result q ¼ 2.613  120 ¼ 314 Btu/h.
The heat ﬂow through the wall is 314 Btu/h.
In Example 3.1 and also the four-layered wall discussed earlier, the same amount of heat ﬂows
through each layer of the wall. The situation is analogous to an electric current ﬂowing through several
resistances in series. Let us return to the 4-layer wall of Fig. 3.3. For that wall, the heat ﬂow was

(3.14)
As discussed above, heat ﬂow is analogous to electric ﬂow. Hence, the 4-layer wall can be modeled
as a circuit with four resistances in series between the temperature potentials T1 and T5 (Fig. 3.5).
As noted above in Eq. (3.17), the resistance of a wall is L/k A. Heat ﬂow by convection is qconv ¼

In Example 3.1, we had a house wall with temperature boundary conditions at both the inside and
outside surfaces. Let us redo Example 3.1 but with convection boundary conditions at the surfaces.
Example 3.2
Heat Flow Through a Wall with Convection
Problem:
The house wall of Example 3.1 is now modiﬁed to have convection boundary conditions rather than temperature boundary
conditions, as shown in Fig. 3.6 below. The outside air is at 31 F with ho ¼ 2 Btu = h ft2 F. The inside air is at 74 F with
hi ¼ 0.7 Btu/h ft2 F.

(a) What is the rate of heat ﬂow through the wall?
(b) What is the temperature at the interface between the T-111 and the ﬁberglass?
Solution:
Rate of Heat Flow
We can again use Eq. (3.18), but now we have ﬁve resistances in the denominator, three for the wall layers and two for the
convections at the wall surfaces.
q ¼ DToverall
P R
(3.18)
where DToverall is the temperature difference across the whole system, which now includes the convection. Thus, the
overall temperature difference is the difference between the temperature of the room air and that of the outside air. Eq.

Interface Temperature
The series electrical circuit for the problem is shown in Fig. 3.7. The heat ﬂow through each layer is the same. Once we
have determined q, we can determine the temperature at any location in the system by using Eq. (3.18).
We wish to ﬁnd temperature T2. We can apply Eq. (3.18) between T2 and the outside air temperature TNo. Between these
two temperatures there is one conductive resistance (the T-111 layer) and the outside convective resistance. Hence, Eq.
(3.18) becomes

As expected, solving Eq. (3.26) for T2, we get the same T2 ¼ 34.4 F.
We can also get the interface temperature T2 without ﬁrst obtaining heat ﬂow q, as follows:
As the same amount of heat ﬂows through each of the ﬁve components of this problem (i.e., the two convective compo-
nents and the three physical layers), we can apply the resistance technique between any two locations in the system. In
particular, we can apply the technique between T2 and the outside air and between the inside air and T2. That is,

The only unknown in Eq. (3.28) is T2. When we put the values for the other variables in the equation and solve for T2, we
get T2 ¼ 34.4 F, which is the same answer as from the other two approaches.
In the above examples we had series heat ﬂow. That is, the same amount of heat ﬂows through all
components of the system. In addition to series heat ﬂow, we can also have parallel heat ﬂow. Consider
Fig. 3.8 that shows a situation where heat ﬂow is both in series and in parallel.

There are two layers in the wall shown in Fig. 3.8. The ﬁrst layer is of material A with con-
ductivity kA, thickness L1, height HA, and width W. The second layer has two materials: B and C.
Material B has conductivity kB, thickness L2, height HB, and width W. Material C has conductivity kC,
thickness L2, height HC, and width W. The left surface of the wall is at temperature T1 and the right
surface is at T2.
The heat ﬂow through the ﬁrst layer is qA. In the second layer, there are two heat ﬂows, qB and qC,
which are parallel to each other. From continuity of heat ﬂow, qA ¼ qB þ qC.
The circuit diagram for this situation is shown in Fig. 3.9.
In this circuit, there are two resistances in parallel. Let us review circuit theory to get the equivalent
resistance for two resistances in parallel. If we have two resistances R1 and R2 in parallel, then, by
circuit theory, the equivalent resistance is

Unlike the house wall of Example 3.2, a real house wall has studs. This example will determine the effect of the studs on
the heat ﬂow through the wall. We will consider the same wall as Example 3.2 except the middle ﬁberglass layer will now
have ﬁberglass batts with studs. The inclusion of studs causes the heat ﬂow in the middle layer to be one of parallel ﬂow
rather than series ﬂow. Some of the heat goes through the ﬁberglass, and the remainder goes through the studs. A top view
of the wall is shown in Fig. 3.10.

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

Problem:
The house wall shown in Fig. 3.10 consists of three layers. The ﬁrst layer is T-111 siding (5/8 inch thick, k ¼ 0.8 Btu in/h
ft2 F). The second layer consists of ﬁberglass batts (3-1/2 inch thick, k ¼ 0.27 Btu in/h ft2 F) separated by studs on 16 inch
centers. The studs are 2  4s. (Their actual dimensions are 1-1/2 inch by 3-1/2 inch.) Like the T-111, the studs are soft-
wood, so we will use the same conductivity for them as the T-111. The third layer is plasterboard (1/2 inch thick, k ¼ 1.2
Btu in/h ft2 F). The wall is 8 ft high by 15 ft wide. The outside air is at 31 F and ho ¼ 2 Btu/h ft2 F. The inside air is at 74 F
and hi ¼ 0.7 Btu/h ft2 F.
Determine the rate of heat ﬂow through the wall.
Solution:
Fig. 3.10 shows four ﬁberglass batts in the middle layer of the wall. For a wall that is 15 feet long, there will actually be 11
such batts, each 14-1/2 inches wide. Also, as shown in the ﬁgure, we will assume that there are double studs at both ends of
the wall. For a 15 foot wall there will be 14 studs. Let us check that 11 batts and 14 studs will equal 15 feet. We have (11)
(14.5) þ (14) (1.5) ¼ 180.5 inches ¼ 15.04 ft. So, we are OK. Let us combine all the studs together and all the ﬁberglass
batts together to result in two parallel heat ﬂows through the center layer of the wall. The wall is 8 feet high and 15 feet
wide. For the T-111 and plaster layers, the heat ﬂow area is 8  15 ¼ 120 ft2. For the middle layer, the ﬂow area for the
studs is 14 studs x 1.5/12 ft per stud x 8 ft ¼ 14 ft2. The ﬂow area for the ﬁberglass is then 120e 14 ¼ 106 ft2.
The circuit diagram for the wall is shown in Fig. 3.11.

Deﬁning the radiation coefﬁcient hrad signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes electrical circuit diagrams. The
nonlinearities are in the coefﬁcient. There are no T4 nodes.
In many situations, there is concurrent convection from a surface to an adjacent ﬂuid and radiation
from the surface to the surroundings. The total heat transfer from the surface is then
qtotal ¼ qconv þ qrad ¼ hAðTs  TNÞ þ hradAðTs  TsurrÞ
(3.37)
If ﬂuid temperature TN and surroundings temperature Tsurr are equal, a combined coefﬁcient
hcombined may be deﬁned, which includes both the convective and radiative heat transfers.
hcombined ¼ h þ hrad
(3.38)
If this is done, the heat transfer at the surface is
qtotal ¼ hcombinedAðTs  TNÞ
(3.39)
and the resistance for the combined convection and radiation is

3.2.1.3 Overall heat transfer coefﬁcient and R-Value
Two terms often used in heat transfer are the Overall Heat Transfer Coefﬁcient, U, and the R-value.
The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is deﬁned by the equation
q ¼ UADT
(3.41)
From this equation, U is the heat ﬂow rate per unit area per unit temperature difference. U is also
sometimes called the Conductance, C.
Let us return to the four-layer wall that we considered earlier. For that wall, the heat ﬂow was given
by Eq. (3.14): q ¼

Comparing Eqs. (3.14) and (3.41), we can see that, for the four-layer wall, the overall heat transfer
coefﬁcient U is
U ¼

þ L2
k2
þ L3

(3.42)
The R-value is another term that is frequently used in heat transfer. It is the reciprocal of the Overall
Heat Transfer Coefﬁcient U.
R-value is commonly used in the speciﬁcation of thermal insulation. The higher the R-value, the
more resistance the insulation has to heat ﬂow. As an example, 3-1/2 inch thick ﬁberglass batts used
between studs in a 2  4 wall typically have an R-value of R-11 or R-13. For a 2  6 wall, the
ﬁberglass insulation would be 5-1/2 inch thick and the R-value would be R-19. R-values are also used
by states in their energy codes. For example, in New York, the energy code speciﬁes the minimum R-
value requirements for walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings of buildings.
The heat ﬂow through a wall of conductivity k, thickness L, and area A is q ¼ kA
L DT. From
Eq. (3.41), q ¼ UADT. Hence, for a wall, the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is U ¼ k/L. The R-value
is the reciprocal of U, so the R-value for the wall is L/k.
3.2 One-dimensional conduction
69

Let us determine the R-value for the ﬁberglass insulation used in the above examples. The ﬁber-
glass is 3-1/2 inches thick and its conductivity is k ¼ 0.27 Btu in/h ft2 F. The R-value is L/k ¼ 3.5 in/
(0.27 Btu in/h ft2 F) ¼ 13 h ft2 F/Btu. When purchasing this insulation in a store, you will only see
R-13 on the insulation. The units will not be included in the labeling.
3.2.2 Cylindrical shell
The cylindrical shell (or hollow cylinder) shown in Fig. 3.12 has an inner radius ri, an outer radius ro,
and a length L. The thermal conductivity is k. The cylinder has temperature boundary conditions with
the inner surface at Ti and the outer surface at To. Heat conduction through the wall is steady and is
only in the radial r direction. We want to determine the temperature distribution in the cylindrical wall
and the heat ﬂow rate through the wall.

Heat ﬂow through the cylinder’s wall is in the r direction. Hence, to get the heat ﬂow we can use the

(3.54)
A is the area through which the heat ﬂows. This area varies with the distance from the centerline of
the cylinder. At radial distance r from the centerline, the area is the circumference times the length of
the cylinder or A ¼ 2 p r L.
dT/dr may be obtained by differentiating Eq. (3.53) or by using Eqs. (3.46) and (3.52).
Putting the expressions for A and dT/dr into Eq. (3.54), we arrive at the expression for the heat ﬂow

Before leaving this discussion of cylindrical shells, let us discuss the overall heat transfer coefﬁ-
cient U: Unlike a plane wall, a cylinder has no single area through which heat is ﬂowing. The area
changes with r. At the inner surface of the cylinder, the area is Ai ¼ 2priL and at the outer surface it is
Ao ¼ 2proL. Because there is no unique area, the value of U must be stated with respect to a speciﬁc
area. For example, we can give the value of U with respect to the inner area or the value of U with
respect to the outer area. From Eq. (3.41) above, U is deﬁned by the equation q ¼ UA DT. For a
cylinder, the two physical areas are Ai and Ao, and the corresponding U values are Ui and Uo. Thus, for
a cylinder,
q ¼ UiAiDT ¼ UoAoDT
(3.57)
From Eq. (3.57), UiAi ¼ UoAo and Ui ¼ ðAo =AiÞ Uo. Putting in the relations for Ai and Ao, we
arrive at
Ui ¼ ðro = riÞ Uo
(3.58)
Example 3.4
Heat Transfer from an Insulated Pipe
Problem:
Steam at 150 C is ﬂowing through a 100 mm nominal size standard metric pipe. The pipe is carbon steel (k ¼ 60 W/m C)
and is located in a factory where the air temperature is 20 C. The convective coefﬁcient between the pipe and the room air
is 4 W/m2 C. The pipe is 50 m long and is uninsulated.
(a) What is the rate of heat transfer from the bare pipe to the room air?
(b) Insulation is added to the pipe to reduce the heat transfer. The insulation is 51 mm thick and has a conductivity of
0.05 W/m C. What is the new rate of heat transfer?
You may make the following assumptions: Radiation heat transfer from the pipe is negligible. The insulated pipe has the
same convective coefﬁcient at its outer surface as the uninsulated pipe. The temperature of the inside surface of the pipe is
essentially the same as the steam temperature.
Solution:
The uninsulated pipe is shown in Fig. 3.13.
From an Internet search, the outside diameter of the pipe is 114.3 mm and the inside diameter is 102.26 mm. Therefore,
r1 ¼ 0.05113 m and r2 ¼ 0.05715 m. There are two resistances between the two known temperatures T1 and TNo: the
resistance of the pipe wall and the convective resistance at the outside surface of the pipe. The circuit for the problem is
shown in Fig. 3.14.
From the circuit drawing and the resistance technique, we have

decreased the heat transfer from 9332 to 2710 W, a decrease of 71%.

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

As a ﬁnal observation, we assumed that the temperature of the inside surface of the pipe was essentially the same as the
steam temperature. This is often a very good assumption. The convective coefﬁcient, h, for steam on a surface is very large.
The convective heat transfer is q ¼ h A ðTs TNÞ: Rearranging this, we have Ts  TN ¼
q
h A. So, for very large h, the
difference between the surface temperature and the ﬂuid temperature is often very small.

3.2.3 Spherical shell
The spherical shell (or hollow sphere) shown in Fig. 3.16 has an inner radius ri, and an outer radius ro.
The thermal conductivity is k. The sphere has temperature boundary conditions with the inner surface
at Ti and the outer surface at To. Heat conduction through the wall is steady and is only in the radial r
direction. We want to determine the temperature distribution in the spherical wall and the heat ﬂow rate
through the wall.

(3.72)
A is the area through which the heat ﬂows. This area varies with the distance from the center of the
sphere. At radial distance r from the center, the area is the surface area of a sphere or A ¼ 4 p r2 .
dT/dr may be obtained by differentiating Eq. (3.71) or by using Eqs. (3.64) and (3.70).
Putting the expressions for A and dT/dr into Eq. (3.72), we arrive at the expression for the heat ﬂow

3.3 Critical insulation thickness
Contrary to intuition, addition of insulation to an object can sometimes increase the heat transfer from
the object rather than decrease it. However, this phenomenon occurs only in limited situations.
Fig. 3.17 shows a pipe or wire covered with a layer of insulation.
The bare pipe or wire has an outer radius of ri, and the radius to the outer surface of the insulation is
ro. As insulation is added to the pipe or wire, ro goes from ri to its ﬁnal value when addition of
insulation is stopped. The length of the pipe or wire is L.
Let us look at the heat transfer from the pipe or wire to the surrounding ﬂuid. The temperature at the
interface between the pipe or wire and the insulation is T1. The insulation has conductivity k and the
surrounding ﬂuid is at temperature TN. The convective coefﬁcient at the outer surface of the insulation
is h.
Between T1 and TN are two resistances: the conductive resistance of the insulation and the
convective resistance between the outer surface of the insulation and the ﬂuid. The expression for the
heat ﬂow through the insulation is

(3.75)
Looking at Eq. (3.75), we see that, as insulation is added to the pipe or wire, i.e., as ro increases, the
ﬁrst term in the denominator decreases and the second term increases. Because of this, there is a certain
value of ro for which the heat ﬂow is a maximum. To ﬁnd this value, called the “critical radius roc”, we
can differentiate the expression for q in Eq. (3.75) with respect to ro and set the result to zero. When
this is done, it is found that the critical radius is k/h.
roc ¼ k

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

So, the maximum heat ﬂow occurs when the outer radius of the insulation equals k/h.
Fig. 3.18 shows a typical plot of q versus ro. We have indicated two regions on the plot: Region A
where ro is less than roc and Region B where ro is greater than roc.
Let us say that a bare pipe or wire has an outer radius ri that is less than roc. This is in Region A. As
insulation is added, ro increases and the heat transfer increases until ro reaches roc. Further addition of
insulation will cause the heat transfer to decrease. On the other hand, if the bare pipe or wire has a
radius ri that is equal to or greater than roc, i.e., ri is in Region B; then any amount of added insulation
will decrease the heat transfer.
Example 3.5
Heat Flow from an Insulated Wire
Problem:
Please refer to the previous Fig. 3.17 that shows an insulated wire. We have a copper #12 AWG wire with PTFE insulation.
The bare wire has a diameter of 2.052 mm and the insulation is 15 mils thick. The thermal conductivity of the insulation is
k ¼ 0.25 W/m C. The temperature T1 at the interface between the wire and the insulation is kept at 100 C, and the sur-
rounding air is at 20 C. The convective coefﬁcient h at the outer surface of the insulation is 10 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the heat transfer rate from the wire per meter length before additional insulation is added?
(b) If more insulation is added to the wire, will the heat transfer rate increase or decrease?
(c) If the answer to Part (b) is that the heat transfer will increase, then how much insulation has to be added for the heat
transfer to reach a maximum? Also, what is the value of this maximum heat transfer rate?
Solution:
(a) For the original wire with the original insulation, ri ¼ 0.001026 m and ro ¼ 0.001407 m. (Note: 1 mil is 1/1000
inch)
Putting the values of this problem into Eq. (3.75), we get that the original heat transfer is q/L ¼ 6.95 W/m.
(b) Maximum heat transfer occurs when ro ¼ roc ¼ k=h.
roc ¼ 0:25 W = m C
10 W = m2 C
¼ 0.025 m
Because our initial ro is 0.001407 m, which is less than roc, addition of insulation will increase the heat transfer until
ro reaches roc:

(c) The thickness of insulation that has to be added to reach roc is 0.025e0.001407 ¼ 0.0236 m ¼ 23.6 mm. Using
roc ¼ 0.025 m in Eq. (3.75), it is found that the maximum heat transfer rate is 29.97 W/m.
The below graph shows q=L versus ro for this example. It is seen that the maximum heat ﬂow indeed occurs at
ro ¼ 0.025 m and the maximum heat ﬂow is 29.97 W/m.

Heat flow vs. ro for Example 3.5
One ﬁnal note on this example: The inner surface of the insulation had a temperature boundary condition. The temperature
was held constant at 100 C. As insulation was added to the wire, up to roc, the heat transfer from the wire increased. To
keep the temperature constant as the heat transfer increased, the electrical current would have to be increased to increase
the heat generation of the wire. If, instead of the constant temperature boundary condition, we had a constant power bound-
ary condition, then, as the insulation was added, the increased heat transfer would have caused a drop in temperature at the
inner surface of the insulation.
At the beginning of this section, we mentioned that the critical insulation phenomenon (i.e., an
increase in heat ﬂow with increased insulation) is only important in limited situations. Indeed, for
common values of k and h, the phenomenon is only relevant when the diameter of the pipe or tube
being insulated is very small or, as in Example 3.5, we are insulating a thin wire.
To illustrate this, let us consider a practical situation where we are putting ﬁberglass insulation on a
1/2 inch Schedule 40 pipe. Fiberglass has a k value of about 0.25 Btu in/h ft2 F. And, we will assume
that the pipe is in still air where h is about 2 Btu/h ft2 F. For a 1/2 inch Schedule 40 pipe, the OD is 0.84
inch. This makes ri equal to 0.42 inch.
The critical radius k=h is 0.25/2 or 0.125 inch. However, ro ¼ ri þ the thickness of the insulation.
So, ro is always greater than 0.42 inch, which is greater than roc. Addition of any amount of insulation
to the pipe will decrease the heat transfer.
3.4 Heat generation in a cylinder
Fig. 3.19 shows a cylinder of radius ro and length L. The cylinder has a uniformly distributed heat
source at strength qgen per unit volume. The heat ﬂow is steady and one-dimensional, i.e., T ¼ TðrÞ,
and there is a temperature boundary condition at the surface of the cylinder.
The heat conduction equation for this situation is Eq. (3.44), repeated here:

The heat ﬂow in the cylinder is in the radial direction and can be determined using the equation

(3.84)
At distance r from the centerline, the area through which heat ﬂows is A ¼ 2prL. The derivative
dT/dr can easily be obtained from Eq. (3.78) as C1 ¼ 0. Putting this in Eq. (3.84), we get the expression
for the heat ﬂow:
qðrÞ ¼ pr2Lqgen
(3.85)
Looking at the right side of Eq. (3.85): pr2L is the volume of the cylinder from r ¼ 0 to r ¼ r. Let
us call this volume the “control volume” When the volume is multiplied by heat generation rate qgen,
we have the rate of heat generation in the control volume. For steady state, the heat inﬂow to this
volume must equal the heat outﬂow from this volume. The heat generated in the control volume is
removed by heat ﬂow through the r ¼ r boundary of the volume.
The heat generation for the whole cylinder is pro2Lqgen. Again, as we have steady state, this heat
generation is removed by heat ﬂow out of the cylinder at the r ¼ ro surface.
Let us say that we have convection at the surface of the cylinder with an h and a TN: This is shown
in Fig. 3.20 below. The area of the surface of the cylinder is 2proL: Because of continuity of heat ﬂow,
the heat generated in the cylinder equals the heat into the surrounding ﬂuid by convection. If the
temperature of the surface is To, then the boundary equation for the surface of the cylinder is

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

Example 3.6
Heat Generation in a Wire
Problem:
A #22 AWG copper wire shorts out across a 0.15 V source. This causes the wire to heat up signiﬁcantly. The wire has a
length of 0.2 m and is located in 20 C room air. The wire’s thermal conductivity is k ¼ 385 W/m C. Finally, the convective
coefﬁcient at the surface of the wire is 15 W/m2 C. For steady-state conditions,
(a) What is the power generated in the wire?
(b) What is the heat generation rate qgen (W/m3)?
(c) What are the temperatures at the center and surface of the wire?
Solution:
(a) The power generated in the wire is P ¼ i2R, where i is the current through the wire and R is the resistance of the
wire. The resistance of the wire can be obtained from the relation
R ¼ rL
A
(3.87)
where r is the resistivity of the wire, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. From the
Internet, the resistivity of copper is 1.68  108 U m and the diameter of the wire is 0.644 mm. The cross-sectional area of
the wire is pr2
o ¼ 3.257  107 m2. The length of the wire was given as 0.2 m. Putting these values into Eq. (3.87) gives a
resistance R ¼ 0.010315 U.
The current in the wire by Ohm’s law is i ¼ E
R. We were given that E ¼ 0.15 V and we determined that R ¼ 0.010315 U.
Hence, the current is i ¼ 0.15/0.010315 ¼ 14.54 A.
The power generated in the wire is P ¼ i2R¼(14.54)2 (0.010,315) ¼ 2.181 W.
(b) qgen is the heat generation rate per unit volume. The volume of the wire is cross-sectional area times length. Using
values above, we have V ¼ (3.257  107) (0.2) ¼ 6.514  108 m3.
Therefore,
qgen ¼ P
V ¼
2:181

It is seen that the difference between the center and surface temperatures is only 0.002 C. This very small difference is due
to the high conductivity of copper and the small diameter of the wire.
As a ﬁnal item for this section, let us say that, instead of a solid cylinder, we have a hollow cylinder
that has uniform heat generation, as shown in Fig. 3.21. We will also have temperature boundary
conditions at the inner and outer surfaces.
For this situation, the heat conduction equation, Eq. (3.77), is the same as that for the solid cylinder,
and the general solution, Eq. (3.79), is also the same as for the solid cylinder. When we applied the
boundary conditions for the solid cylinder, we made C1 equal to zero due to the existence of material at
3.4 Heat generation in a cylinder

the center of the cylinder and the logarithmic term. For the hollow cylinder, there is no material at
r ¼ 0 and we cannot eliminate the C1 ln r term. The boundary conditions for the hollow cylinder
situation are applied to Eq. (3.79) in its entirety.
Heat generation for other geometries is given in Chapter 12.
3.5 Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity
The thermal conductivity k of materials varies with temperature. However, in many cases, this vari-
ation is small and the conductivity can be taken as being constant at the average temperature of the
problem.
Let us consider conduction through the plane wall of Fig. 3.22, which has conductivity varying
with temperature. The left face of the wall is at temperature T1 and the right face is at T2.

Comparing this with Eq. (3.10), it is seen that we can use the constant conductivity equation if we
use the conductivity value km in the equation.
Similar results can be obtained for heat ﬂow through cylinders and spheres when the conductivity is
linear with temperature. For example, consider heat ﬂow through the hollow cylinder shown in
Fig. 3.23.
If the conductivity of the cylinder is linear with temperature, it can be shown that the heat ﬂow q

Plate With Temperature-Dependent Conductivity
Problem:
A plate of pure copper is 15 cm by 20 and 1 cm thick. One side of the plate is at 200 C and the other side is at 600 C.
Determine the heat ﬂow rate through the plate (W). Consider the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity.
Solution:
The plate is like the wall of Fig. 3.22. The cross-sectional area A is 0.15  0.20 m ¼ 0.03 m2. The thickness L is 0.01 m.
From an Internet search, the conductivity of the copper varies with temperature as shown in Table 3.1.

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

At ﬁrst glance, the ﬁgure appears to show that the conductivity varies signiﬁcantly with temperature. However, the ﬁgure is
misleading due to the scaling on the vertical axis. If the vertical axis had started at zero, then the ﬁgure would have shown a
much more gradual variation of conductivity with temperature. This is shown in Fig. 3.25.
Indeed, the conductivity varies only 13.6% over the entire 800 K temperature range. And, the temperature relationship is
quite linear. Using Excel, the linear trendline ﬁt of Table 3.1 data is k ¼ 419:4  0:063 T with an R2 of 0.991. (Note: A
second-degree polynomial ﬁt is even better. It is k ¼ 0:000025 T2  0:023 T þ 405:4 with anR2 of 0.998.) The units in
these equations are k (W/m K) and T (K).
If we assume that k varies linearly with T, then we can use Eq. (3.98):
q ¼ kmA
L ðT1  T2Þ
(3.98)
For this problem, km is k at the mean temperature (200 þ 600)/2 ¼ 400 C ¼ 673 K.
Using the Excel linear trendline equation k ¼ 419:4  0:063T, we have
km ¼ 419:4  0:063 ð673Þ ¼ 377 W = m K.

The difference between heat ﬂows using these two data ﬁts is only 6%.
An even quicker solution would be to merely look at Fig. 3.24 and use the k value at the mean temperature of
400 C ¼ 673 K. Eyeballing the ﬁgure, we get that k is about 377 W/m K. Hence,
q ¼ kA
L ðT1  T2Þ ¼ 377ð0:03Þ

The closeness of these three results for q is due to pure copper’s small variation of conductivity with temperature and the
essentially linear characteristic of the keT function.
Let us next consider a problem involving a material having signiﬁcant temperature-dependent
conductivity.

Example 3.8
Cylinder With Temperature-Dependent Conductivity
Problem:
A long aluminum oxide cylinder has an inner diameter of 1 cm and an outer diameter of 2 cm. The temperature of the inner
surface is 500 C and that of the outer surface is 100 C. Determine the heat ﬂow rate through the cylinder’s wall per meter
length of the cylinder. Consider the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity.
Solution:
Consider Fig. 3.23 above. For this problem, ri ¼ 0.005 m, ro ¼ 0.01 m, Ti ¼ 500 C ¼ 773 K, and To ¼ 100 C ¼ 373 K.
From an Internet search, the conductivity of the aluminum oxide varies with temperature as shown in Table 3.2.
Fig. 3.26 is an Excel chart of the data of Table 3.2.
It is seen that the conductivity of aluminum oxide varies signiﬁcantly with temperature and is quite nonlinear.
Let us look again at Fig. 3.23 and consider conduction through a cylindrical shell having variable thermal conductivity.
The heat conduction for our problem is radially outward. The heat ﬂow at location r ¼ r is q ¼ k A
dT
dr and the
area through which heat is ﬂowing at this location is A ¼ 2prL: Hence, at r ¼ r,
q ¼  kð2prLÞ dT

(3.101)
Note: q does not vary with r. From heat ﬂow continuity, it is the same at all radial locations. We therefore were able to move

is an excellent ﬁt to the data of Table 3.2:

It is always good to check a ﬁnal answer, especially if the calculation involves several steps as in the above integration. So,
let us look at Fig. 3.26 and get an average value of k for this problem. The average temperature of the two surfaces is
(373 þ 773)/2 ¼ 573 K. Looking at Fig. 3.26, k is about 16 W/m K for this temperature.

Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

3.6 Multi-dimensional conduction
The above sections discussed one-dimensional conduction. Multi-dimensional problems (i.e., two
and three dimensions) can be solved using a variety of methods: classical analytical techniques,
conduction shape factor, numerical methods, or packaged software developed speciﬁcally for such
problems.
Classical analytical techniques for solving the partial differential equations of heat transfer have
been in existence for many years. Several books have been written on such solutions, including those
by Carslaw and Jaeger [1], Schneider [2], Myers [3], and Arpaci [4]. Analytical solutions were very
important and necessary before the advent of calculators and computers. They are also important for
research and mathematical investigations today. However, analytical solutions are limited in scope and
applicability and are often very complex. It is felt that the conduction shape factor and numerical
methods are much more useful for students and practicing engineers. Therefore, analytical techniques
such as separation of variables are not covered in this book. Shape factors are discussed in the next
section, and numerical methods in Chapter 5.
Also, several companies have developed software packages for engineering design and heat
transfer applications. These include COMSOL [5], Solidworks [6], Ansys [7], and CD-Adapco (ac-
quired by Siemens) [8].
3.7 Conduction shape factors
The conduction shape factor is very useful in solving specialized two- and three-dimensional problems
involving two temperatures. Examples of applicability include heat transfer from buried pipes and heat
transfer through rectangular enclosures such as kilns.
The heat transfer equation for this method is
q ¼ kSðT1  T2Þ
(3.106)
where q is the rate of heat transfer between the two surfaces at T1 and T2
k is the thermal conductivity of the medium between T1 and T2
S is the conduction shape factor.
From Eq. (3.106), the resistance for shape factors is 1
kS. This resistance can be used in solving
problems by means of the resistance concept. It is particularly useful for problems involving multi-
layered objects or surfaces with convection.
Some of the more useful conduction shape factors are given in Table 3.3. More shape factors can be
obtained from Refs. [9,10] and [11].

Example 3.9
Heat Flow Through a Kiln Wall
Problem:
A rectangular electric kiln for pottery has a maximum operating temperature of 1000 C. Its inside dimensions are 60 cm
wide by 50 cm deep by 30 cm high. The walls of the kiln are 8 cm thick and of refractory ﬁrebrick having a conductivity of
1.2 W/m C. During maximum operation, the inner surface of the kiln is at 700 C and the outer surface is at 375 C.
(a) Determine the heat ﬂow through the wall of the kiln (W) for the kiln at its maximum operating level
(b) The factory has 240V single-phase electric service. What is the maximum current draw of the kiln (A)? What size
wiring would you use for the kiln? Finally, what size circuit breaker would you use in the electric panel?
Solution:
(a) If the kiln were spherical, we could use the earlier derived equation for heat ﬂow through a spherical shell. However,
the kiln is rectangular so we have to take into account heat ﬂow at edges and corners of the kiln. The conduction
shape factor technique is excellent for this problem. Indeed, there are shape factors in Table 3.3 which cover our
situation; namely shape factors no. 8 (wall), 9 (edge), and 10 (corner). The kiln has 6 plane walls, 12 edges, and 8
corners. From Table 3.3, the shape factor calculations are
Swalls ¼ 2ð60  50Þ=8 þ 2ð60  30Þ=8 þ 2ð50  30Þ=8 ¼ 1575 cm

The heat ﬂow rate through the kiln’s wall is
q ¼ kStotalDT ¼ 1:2ð18:87Þð700  375Þ ¼ 7360
W
Although the shape factor technique is one way to model this problem, there are other possible ways. For example, let us
replace the rectangular wall of the kiln with a spherical wall and use the equation for conduction through a spherical wall.
The inner surface area of the kiln is 2 (60  50) þ 2 (60  30) ¼ 2 (50  30) ¼ 12,600 cm2.
The surface area of a sphere is 4pr2, so this inner surface area of 1.26 m2 corresponds to a spherical surface with a radius of
0.3167 m.
The thickness of the kiln wall is 8 cm. Therefore, let us consider conduction through a spherical wall of inner radius
0.3167 m and outer radius 0.3167 þ 0.08 ¼ 0.3967 m.
Conduction through a spherical wall is given by Eq. (3.73).

shape factor technique corresponds to a current of 7360/240 ¼ 30.67 A. From the Internet, AWG #10 copper wire
has an ampacity of 30 A, AWG #8 wire has 40 A, and #6 has 55 A. Therefore, #8 AWG wire should be used. Finally,
a 40 A circuit breaker would be appropriate for the circuit.
The conduction shape factor is very useful for calculating heat transfer from buried pipes. The
following example illustrates this situation.

Example 3.10
Heat Loss from a Buried Pipe
Problem:
This problem is based on a study made by the author of heat loss from a buried hot water pipe at a dog kennel in New York.
Water at 190 F ﬂows at a rate of 5 gpm through a buried one-inch Schedule 40 steel pipe from one building to another. The
pipe is horizontal and uninsulated. It is 60 feet long and is buried at a depth of 2 feet. The soil has a conductivity of 0.833
BTU/h ft F, and the ground surface temperature is 35 F.
Determine the rate of heat loss from the pipe (BTU/h).
Solution:
The outside diameter of 1 inch Sch 40 pipe is 1.315 inch. We will assume that the outer surface of the pipe is at the water
temperature of 190 F. This is a reasonable assumption as the pipe is metal, relatively thin-walled, and the convective
coefﬁcient at the water/pipe interface is quite large.
The appropriate shape factor is #1 from Table 3.3.

3.8 Extended surfaces (ﬁns)
This section gives an introduction to the topic of extended surfaces or ﬁns. Much research has been
done on this topic, and references [12e14] may be consulted for more detailed information.
As shown in Chapter 1, the heat transfer rate is proportional to heat ﬂow area for all three modes of
heat transfer. One way of increasing heat transfer from a surface is to add extended surfaces (or “ﬁns”)
to the surface. This increases the heat transfer area and, in turn, the rate of heat transfer.
Fins are used on a variety of devices. Some applications include coils for air conditioning and
refrigeration; baseboard heaters for residential and commercial buildings; heat sinks for electronic
devices, car radiators, and engine and air compressor cylinders. Some examples of these are shown
in Fig. 3.27:
Let us ﬁrst consider ﬁns of constant cross-sectional area. We will derive the governing differential
equation for the temperature distribution in the ﬁn and discuss the appropriate boundary condition
equations. We will see how the addition of ﬁns enhances the heat transfer from a surface. Common ﬁns
of varying cross-sectional area will then be discussed. Examples will be given for a single ﬁn on a
surface and also for multiple ﬁns on a surface.

3.8.1 Fins of constant cross section
3.8.1.1 The governing differential equation and boundary conditions
Let us consider the ﬁn of square cross section shown in Fig. 3.28. The cross section is of dimension a x
a and the ﬁn has a length L. It is attached to a surface that is at temperature Ts. The surrounding ﬂuid is
at temperature TN and the convective coefﬁcient at the side surfaces and end of the ﬁn is h. Finally, the
heat transfer is steady state.
Our analytical model is one-dimensional. This assumes that the temperature in the ﬁn only depends
on x, the distance from the surface on which the ﬁn is attached. This 1D model is usually very
acceptable as ﬁns are normally thin and of high thermal conductivity.
To derive the equation for the temperature variation TðxÞ of the ﬁn, let us consider the heat ﬂow in
and out of a differential vertical slice of the ﬁn. The slice (or “celement”) is from x¼x to x¼xþdx and
has a thickness dx. There is conduction qx entering the left side of the element and conduction qxþdx
leaving the right side. There is also convection qconv from the element to the adjacent ﬂuid. For steady
state, the rate of heat ﬂow into the element equals the rate of heat ﬂow out of the element or

duction heat transfer or a2 for our square ﬁn. In Eqs. (3.111), A is the surface area for convection or
P dx, where P is the perimeter around the ﬁn. For our square ﬁn of side “a," the perimeter is 4 a.

There is convection from the ﬁn to the ﬂuid at the x ¼ L end of the ﬁn. At this location, the heat
ﬂow by conduction equals the heat ﬂow by convection. The boundary condition is therefore
At x ¼ L;
kA dT
dx ¼ hAðT  TNÞ
The A’s are the same for conduction and convection at the end of the ﬁn, and the ﬂuid temperature
TN is constant. Hence, the boundary condition at the end of the ﬁn is
At x ¼ L;

3.8.1.2 The solution for temperature distribution and heat ﬂow

Eq. (3.118) gives the temperature distribution along the total length of the ﬁn, i.e., from x ¼ 0 to
x ¼ L. However, the objective in most situations is to determine the heat transfer from the ﬁn to the
ﬂuid. This can be done in two different ways. One way involves differentiation of the TðxÞ function of
Eq. (3.118). The other way involves integration of the TðxÞ function.
For the ﬁrst way, we consider the heat transfer into the ﬁn at location x ¼ 0. This is conduction heat
transfer and is given by
q ¼  kA
dT
dx

x¼0
(3.119)
The temperature function of Eq. (3.118) is differentiated with respect to x and the result is evaluated
at x ¼ 0. The result is then used in Eq. (3.119) to obtain the heat ﬂow into the ﬁn.
In the second way, we look at the convection heat transfer from the ﬁn’s surfaces into the ﬂuid. In so
doing, we integrate the function of Eq. (3.118) to get the heat transfer from the sides of the ﬁn into the
ﬂuid and use the temperature at the x ¼ L end of the ﬁn to get the heat transfer from the end of the ﬁn
into the ﬂuid. The total convection heat transfer to the ﬂuid is given by
q ¼
ZL
0
hPðT  TNÞdx þ hAðTx¼L  TNÞ
(3.120)
As we have steady-state conditions, the heat ﬂow into the ﬁn at x ¼ 0 equals the heat ﬂow into the
ﬂuid by convection from the ﬁn’s surfaces. That is, the q’s in Eqs. (3.119) and (3.120) are equal.
Regardless of whether the ﬁrst or second approach is used to get the heat ﬂow, the result is

The equations for the temperature distribution in the ﬁn (Eq. 3.118) and for the heat ﬂow from the
ﬁn (Eq. 3.121) involve hyperbolic trigonometric functions. These functions are readily available on
scientiﬁc calculators and in software packages. However, such was not always the case. In years past,
evaluation of the equations was very tedious and time-consuming as slide rules and tables had to be
used to evaluate the exponential and trigonometric functions. To speed up calculations, two frequently
used approximations were developed. These are discussed in the next two sections. Indeed, they will
speed up hand calculations. However, one must keep in mind that they are approximations and should
be used only in situations consistent with the assumptions made in their derivation.
3.8.1.3 Very-long-ﬁn approximation
The ﬁrst approximation assumes that the ﬁn is very long. This means that the temperature at the end of
the ﬁn approaches the ﬂuid temperature. Mathematically, the boundary condition at the end of the ﬁn is
As
x / N; T/TN
(3.122)
98
Chapter 3 Steady-state conduction

The previous differential equation (Eq. 3.114) and boundary condition equation at the base
(Eq. 3.116) remain applicable. The solution for the temperature distribution in the very long ﬁn is
TðxÞ  TN ¼ ðTs  TNÞemx
where m ¼

(3.123)
and the solution for the heat transfer to the ﬂuid is
q ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
hPkA
p
ðTs  TNÞ
(3.124)
3.8.1.4 Insulated-at-end ﬁn approximation
The other approximation assumes that there is negligible heat transfer from the tip of the ﬁn. This is
often an excellent approximation as most ﬁns have a lateral area much larger than the tip area. With no
heat ﬂow from the tip, the boundary condition equation at the end of the ﬁn is
q ¼ 0 ¼ kA dT
dx
which simpliﬁes to
At x ¼ L;
dT
dx ¼ 0
(3.125)
The differential equation for the temperature distribution in the ﬁn (Eq. 3.114) and boundary
condition equation at the base (Eq. 3.116) remain applicable. The solution for the temperature dis-
tribution in the insulated-at-end ﬁn is
TðxÞ  TN ¼ ðTs  TNÞ cosh½mðL  xÞ
coshðmLÞ
(3.126)
and the solution for the heat transfer to the ﬂuid is
q ¼

hPkA
p
ðTs  TNÞtanhðmLÞ
(3.127)
As before; m ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

As mentioned above, this approximation often gives excellent results. To make the results even
better, the lateral area can be increased to compensate for the neglected heat transfer area at the tip. The
lateral area is increased by adding an amount equal to A=P to the length of the ﬁn. This “corrected”
length Lc is used instead of L in Eqs. (3.126) and (3.127). For example, consider a pin ﬁn (i.e., a
cylindrical ﬁn of circular cross section) of length L and diameter D. The corrected length is
Lc ¼ L þ A=P ¼ L þ pD2=4
pD
¼ L þ D
4
Similarly, a ﬁn of square cross section of side a will have a corrected length
Lc ¼ L þ A=P ¼ L þ a2
4a ¼ L þ a

Finally, a thin ﬁn of rectangular cross section with width w and thickness t with t << w will have a
corrected length Lc ¼ L þ t
2.
3.8.2 Fin efﬁciency
Fin Efﬁciency is the ratio of the heat transferred by a ﬁn to the heat that would have been transferred if
the total ﬁn surface were at the base (or wall) temperature. That is,
hf ¼
qfin
heat transferred if entire fin surface were at Ts
(3.128)
This deﬁnition is very useful. It is easy to calculate the denominator in the deﬁnition. Then, if the
efﬁciency of a ﬁn is known, the heat transferred by the ﬁn can readily be determined. As shown below
in Section 3.8.4, ﬁn efﬁciency graphs are available for several common types of ﬁns.
3.8.3 Fin effectiveness
Fin Effectiveness indicates how successful the addition of a ﬁn to a surface has been in enhancing the
heat transfer from the surface. It is the ratio of the heat transferred by the ﬁn to the heat transfer from
the base area covered by the ﬁn if the ﬁn had not been attached. If Ab is the area of ﬁn attachment, then
the effectiveness is
εfin ¼
qfin
hAbðTs  TNÞ
(3.129)
Determination of ﬁn efﬁciency and ﬁn effectiveness is illustrated in Example 3.11.
Example 3.11
Heat Transfer from a Pin Fin
Problem:
A pin ﬁn (k ¼ 250 W/m C) is attached to a wall. The ﬁn’s diameter is 1.5 cm and it is 10 cm long. The wall is at 200 C. The
surrounding air is at 15 C and the convective coefﬁcient is 9 W/m2 C. (Note: The ﬁn is like that shown in Fig. 3.28 except
the cross section is circular rather than square.)
(a) Determine the rate of heat transfer from the ﬁn to the surrounding air.
(b) Compare the result of part (a) with the result from the very-long-ﬁn approximation.
(c) Compare the result of part (a) with the insulated-at-end approximation.
(d) Determine the efﬁciency of the ﬁn.
(e) Determine the effectiveness of the ﬁn.

(3.124)
Therefore, q ¼ ð0:1368Þð200 15Þ ¼ 25:3 W.
Comparing this result with that of Part (a), it is seen that the very-long-ﬁn approximation is totally inappropriate for this
ﬁn. The ﬁn is much too short to apply the very-long-ﬁn approximation. Indeed, the ﬁn would have to be 49 cm long before
the very-long-ﬁn approximation gives a heat transfer within 10% of the actual heat transfer rate of the ﬁn.
(c) The heat transfer using the insulated-at-end approximation is given by Eq. (3.127).
q ¼

(3.127)
Therefore q ¼ ð0:1368Þð200 15Þtanhð0:3098Þ ¼ 7:60 W.
It is seen that the insulated-at-end ﬁn approximation gives very good results. The heat transfer is 7.60 W, which is only
3.4% different from the 7.87 W result of Part (a). Let’s apply the corrected-length concept and see what the result is.
For our ﬁn, the corrected length is
Lc ¼ L þ D
4 ¼ 0:1 þ 0:015=4 ¼ 0:10375 m
Using the corrected length in Eq. (3.127) gives
q ¼ ð0:1368Þð200  15Þtanh½ð3:098Þð0:10375Þ ¼ 7:87 W
This is the same result that we got for Part (a). We conclude that using the insulated-at-end approximation with the
corrected length technique gives excellent results.
(d) The ﬁn efﬁciency is given by Eq. (3.128).

It is seen that the ﬁn is very effective. Heat transfer from the bare, unﬁnned area has increased by a factor of 26.8.

3.8.4 Fins of varying cross section
Section 3.8.1 discussed ﬁns of constant cross-sectional area. Example 3.11 also dealt with a ﬁn of
constant cross-sectional area. However, some types of ﬁns have cross-sectional areas that vary along
their length. We discuss three types of these ﬁns: circumferential ﬁns, triangular straight ﬁns, and
conical pin ﬁns.
3.8.4.1 Circumferential ﬁns
Circumferential (or “annular”) ﬁns are often used for cooling of engine cylinders and for enhancement
of heat transfer from heating pipes in buildings. Examples of circumferential ﬁns are in Fig. 3.27
above.
A circumferential ﬁn is shown in Fig. 3.29. Its efﬁciency is given by Eq. (3.130).

Functions I and K in Eq. (3.130) are the modiﬁed Bessel functions. The functions are available in

The ﬁn efﬁciency is also shown in Figs. 3.30 and 3.31. Fig. 3.30 gives the overall graph. It is seen
that the upper left corner of the graph is hard to read. Thus, we have included a second graph, Fig. 3.31,
which expands that portion of the graph. In these graphs, Lc ¼ L þ t

After the ﬁn efﬁciency is determined, the heat transfer from the ﬁn can be determined using
Eq. (3.128) above. This is illustrated in Example 3.12.

Example 3.12
Heat Transfer For a Baseboard Heater
Problem:
The ﬁnned tube for a baseboard heater is shown in Fig. 3.32. It consists of one-inch Type L copper tubing with square
circumferential ﬁns. The ﬁns are 4.25 inch by 4.25 inch and 0.02 inch thick. There are 40 ﬁns per foot length of
tubing. The conductivity of the ﬁns is 250 W/m C and the room air is at 65 F. The water ﬂowing through the heater is
at 180 F. It may be assumed that the convective heat coefﬁcient is 7.5 W/m2 C.
Determine the heat transfer rate from the heater (Btu/h) per foot length of the heater.
Solution:
Figs. 3.30 and 3.31 give the ﬁn efﬁciency for a circular circumferential ﬁn. However, we have square ﬁns rather than cir-
cular ﬁns. As an approximation, let us determine the dimensions of a circular ﬁn which has the same heat transfer area as
our square ﬁn.
Our ﬁn is 4.25 inch by 4.25 inch. One side of the ﬁn has an area 4.25  4.25 ¼ 18.063 in2 minus the area cut by the copper
tubing. One-inch copper tubing has an outside diameter of 1.125 in. One side of the ﬁn thus has a heat transfer area of
A ¼ 18.063 in2 - p/4 (1.125)2 ¼ 17.069 in2. Converting to square meters, we have
A ¼ 17.069 in2  (2.54 cm/in  1 m/100 cm)2 ¼ 0.011012 m2
We need to ﬁnd the outside diameter for an equivalent circular ﬁn. Looking at Fig. 3.33,
D1 ¼ 1:125 in ¼ 1.125 in  0.0254 m

length ¼ L ¼ r2  r1 ¼ 0:04661 m
corrected length ¼ Lc ¼ L þ t=2 ¼ 0:04687 m
Ap ¼ Lct ¼ 0:000023808 m2
The different curves on the ﬁgure are for different values of r2c=r1. For our problem, r2c=r1 ¼ 4:28. The value for the
bottom axis is 0.360.
Going into Fig. 3.30 with these values of r2c=r1 and x we see that the fin efficiency hf is 0.82.

40 fins = ft  3.2808 ft = m ¼ 131 fins=m
The total heat transfer for a one-meter length of ﬁnned tube is the heat transfer from the 131 ﬁns plus the heat transfer from

only 15% different from this.

3.8.5 Closing comments on ﬁns
Selecting ﬁns to enhance heat transfer is a complex matter. In general, the ﬁns should have high
conductivity. Fins are also more effective for smaller values of the convective coefﬁcient. That is, they
are more effective in gases than in liquids and for situations of natural convection rather than forced
convection. There are many different types of ﬁns and many different materials to choose from. And,
in addition to heat transfer capability, there may be size and weight constraints. Selection of ﬁns for a
particular application is often an economic decision based on the costs of manufacture and material.
In this Section 3.8, we have considered the enhancement of heat transfer from a surface through the
addition of ﬁns. We have derived the governing differential equation for the temperature distribution in
a ﬁn and have solved the equation for a ﬁn of constant cross-sectional area. We have also obtained or
set forth expressions for the heat transfer from several common types of ﬁns. It should be emphasized
that the material in this section is theoretical and has been based on several assumptions. These include
(1) The temperatures in the ﬁn and the heat ﬂows in and from the ﬁn are steady state, i.e., they do not
change with time.
(2) The temperature of the medium surrounding the ﬁn is constant and uniform over all surfaces of
the ﬁn.
(3) The ﬁn is thin and the heat ﬂow and temperature distribution in the ﬁn is one-dimensional.
(4) There is no contact resistance where the ﬁn is attached to the surface.
(5) Heat transfer from the ﬁn to the surrounding medium is by convection. There is no radiative heat
transfer.
(6) The thermal conductivity is homogeneous and is the same at all locations in the ﬁn. The
conductivity is also independent of direction.
(7) The convective coefﬁcient is the same over all surfaces of the ﬁn and is accurately known.
Some of these assumptions are more appropriate and realistic than others. The worst assumption is
the last one. We will see in later chapters that the convective coefﬁcient often depends signiﬁcantly on
surface orientation and surface dimensions. For example, the coefﬁcient is usually quite different for
horizontal and vertical surfaces. The only really accurate determination of h is through experimen-
tation on the particular devices and systems involved, during their actual operation. Empirical relations
and h-values developed through carefully controlled laboratory experiments are often signiﬁcantly
different from results obtained during actual component and system use in practice. In short, the
prediction of ﬁn performance depends greatly on the choice of h-value. The best approach would be to
measure h during actual device operation. If this is not possible, which is often the case, then one
should use their best judgment in picking an appropriate h to use in the equations of this chapter.
3.9 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we covered several steady-state situations in which the temperature distributions and
heat ﬂows did not vary with time. These included the geometries of ﬂat plates, cylindrical shells, and
spherical shells. We discussed practical multilayered situations such as heat ﬂow through a building’s
walls and from pipes covered with insulation. We also discussed special cases where thermal con-
ductivity was not constant, but rather a function of temperature, and where a material had internal heat
generation, such as a wire carrying electrical current. The conduction shape factor technique was

discussed. This technique is very useful in solving problems involving unique geometries such as
buried pipes and spheres. And, ﬁnally, we provided an introduction to extended surfaces and ﬁns,
which are often used in devices to enhance heat transfer from surfaces.
In our discussion of ﬁns, we brieﬂy discussed the difﬁculty in accurately determining the
convective coefﬁcient h. For now, values of h are provided as givens for all problems involving
convection. In later chapters, we will discuss how to determine h for ourselves.
We now move on to the next chapter and consider situations where the temperature distributions
and heat ﬂows vary with time.

3-55 Hot air at 1150 C is inside a kiln. The wall of the kiln is 7.6 cm thick and has a thermal
conductivity of 0.35 W/m C. The convective coefﬁcient on the inner surface of the kiln is
15 W/m2 C. The outer surface has a convective coefﬁcient of 3 W/m2 C and an emissivity of
0.75. The room air is at 25 C and the walls, ceiling, and ﬂoor of the room are at 30 C.

3-56 A homeowner is annoyed by water dripping due to condensation from cold water pipes in his
basement during hot, humid summers. The water drips on his head as he walks through the
basement and, even worse, it drips on cardboard boxes he has stored in the basement. The son
of his neighbor is an engineering student who tells him that he should insulate the pipes.
Condensation occurs if the temperature of the outer surface of the pipes is below the dew point
temperature of the air in the basement.

point temperature? (Note: This can be obtained from a psychrometric chart from an HVAC
text or from various internet sites.)
(b) The cold water ﬂowing through the water lines is at about 52 F and the water lines are 3/400
Type L copper pipe. If the homeowner adds ﬁberglass insulation to the lines, what is the
minimum thickness of insulation needed to prevent the condensation? Assume the
convective coefﬁcient at the outer surface of the insulation is 0.7 Btu/h ft2 F.
3-57 A house has a 40 gallon hot water heater. The water tank of the heater is 115 cm high and has a

the tank is maintained at 62 C. The steel tank (k ¼ 45 W/m C) has a wall thickness of 3 mm.
The room air is at 10 C. The convective coefﬁcient at the inner surface of the tank is 55 W/m2
C and is 6 W/m2 C at the outer surface of the insulation.
(a) What is the needed power (W) to the heater to keep the water at 62 C? The heat loss from
the bottom of the tank should be small. Consider only the heat loss from the top and the

radiate to the surroundings. For Plate A, the exposed surface has convective coefﬁcient
12 W/m2 C and emissivity 0.8. For Plate B, the exposed surface has convective coefﬁcient
2 W/m2 C and emissivity 0.4. The adjacent ﬂuids and surroundings are at 35 C. The total heat
ﬂux provided by the heater is 1800 W/m2.

4.1 Introduction
In general, temperatures and heat ﬂows in a body vary with both location and time. Chapter 3 discussed
situations in which the heat transfer was steady, i.e., had no variation with time. In this chapter, we
consider situations in which temperatures and heat ﬂows vary with time.
We will ﬁrst discuss lumped systems. For these systems, all locations in the body have essentially
the same temperature at a given time. That is, there is no spatial variation of temperature. This is the

simplest case of unsteady conduction. It is valid when a body is sufﬁciently small, has high thermal
conductivity, and/or is sufﬁciently insulated from its surroundings.
If a heat transfer situation does not meet the criteria for the lumped system analysis, then we must
look at spatial variation of temperatures and heat ﬂows in a body. We will ﬁrst discuss conduction in
large plane plates, long cylinders, and spheres. We will then show how these results can be applied to
other geometries such as short cylinders and rectangular solids.
Finally, we discuss heat transfer in semiinﬁnite solids. This topic is of considerable practical
interest. For example, it can be applied to determine the needed depth of burial of water pipes in the
ground to prevent freezing and the needed depth of foundation footings to prevent frost heave.
4.2 Lumped systems (no spatial variation)
In this section, we consider systems in which all points in the body are at the same temperature at a
given time. Although temperatures in the body change with time, there is no spatial variation at a given
time. That is, the temperature in the body is only a function of time or
T ¼ TðtÞ
(4.1)
4.2.1 Lumped systems analysis
Consider the body shown in Fig. 4.1. Let us say the body is initially at temperature Ti and it is suddenly
immersed in a ﬂuid at a lower temperature TN. Heat will ﬂow by convection from the body to the ﬂuid
until the temperature of the body reaches the ﬂuid temperature TN.
We can write a word equation for this process as follows:
Rate of decrease in internal energy of the body ¼ Rate of heat flow from the body to the fluid

Mathematically, this equation is

4.2.2 Application criterion
A body can be modeled as a lumped system when its internal resistance to heat conduction is small
compared with the convective resistance at its surface. This requirement is best met by small bodies of
high conductivity having a small convective coefﬁcient at the surface.
A dimensionless parameter, the Biot number (Bilumped), is used to determine the applicability of
lumped system analysis. This parameter is
Bilumped ¼ hL
k
where h is the convective coefﬁcient at the surface of the body, L is a characteristic length of the body,
usually taken as the volume Vof the body divided by the surface area A of the body, and k is the thermal
conductivity of the body.
Let us brieﬂy discuss why we have a subscript of “lumped” on the Biot number: In this consid-
eration of whether a lumped analysis is appropriate, the characteristic length L is the volume Vof the
body divided by the surface area A. The length parameter in the Biot number is deﬁned differently in
other places in this text. As an example, let us consider a sphere of radius ro. Bilumped would be

Chapter 4 Unsteady conduction

In other sections of this text, the Biot number Bi for a sphere is given as hro=k: Thus, there is a
factor of three difference between Bilumped and the other Biot number. In short, there are really two
different Biot numbers: one for use in this section and one for use in other sections of this text. Hence,
to avoid confusion, we have decided to use different nomenclatures for the two numbers rather than use
the same Bi for both.
Let us move on to the criterion for use of the lumped analysis. This criterion is
If Bilumped is less than 0.1, then the spatial variation of temperature in the body is small, and the
lumped system analysis is deemed appropriate.
If Bilumped
<
0.1
Lumped  System Analysis is applicable
Some words about the criterion: First, the value 0.1 is a rule of thumb and is not necessarily a ﬁrm
value. We discussed earlier the uncertainty in convective coefﬁcient h. This coefﬁcient is in the Biot
number, which leads to some uncertainty in the 0.1 value. If Bilumped is, say, 0.004, then we can be quite
conﬁdent that the spatial variation of temperature in the body is negligible and the lumped analysis is
appropriate. On the other hand, if Bilumpedis a bit greater than 0.1, say 0.13, we should not a priori
assume that there is signiﬁcant spatial variation of temperature in the body. Perhaps a closer inves-
tigation is needed.
Other factors may also enter into the decision to use a lumped analysis. Maybe only an estimate is
needed of the temperature in the body at a given time, and the details of the spatial variation are not
important. Or, maybe a quick answer is needed as to the temperature in the body. One could get a quick
result from the lumped analysis and then, if necessary, later supplement this analysis with analyses that
consider spatial variation.

Cooling of a copper cube
Problem
The copper cube (k ¼ 400 W/m C, r ¼ 8930 kg/m3, c ¼ 390 J/kg C) shown below is 2 cm by 2 cm by 2 cm. It is initially at
200 C in an oil bath. The cube is taken out of the bath and placed on an insulating board to cool by convection to the
surrounding air. Assume the surrounding air is at 20 C and the convective coefﬁcient is 10 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the temperature of the center of the cube after 45 min?
(b) How much heat (J) ﬂows to the surrounding air during the 45 min?

(Please note that for the surface area, we have only included ﬁve of the six faces of the cube. One face is on the insulating
board. This face does not convect to the air and we assume that there is no conduction to the board.)
The Biot number is much less that 0.1, so we can use the lumped analysis.

This is the temperature of the cube after 45 min. As we have a lumped system, all points in the cube will be at that tem-
perature, including the center.

Therefore, 4293 J of heat will be transferred from the cube to the surrounding air during the 45 min process.
(c) Eq. (4.8) gives the temperature of the cube after any amount of time. If we use this equation to see how long it will
take to have the cube reach TN, the result is that it will take an inﬁnite amount of time. How can this possibly be
true? Let us revisit this problem after we have discussed the time constant in the next section.
4.2.3 The time constant
The lumped system is a ﬁrst-order system as it obeys Eq. (4.3), which is a ﬁrst-order differential
equation:
 rcV dT
dt ¼ hAðT  TNÞ
(4.3)
126
Chapter 4 Unsteady conduction

And the system receives an abrupt change at time zero, that is, it is suddenly subjected to
convection at its surface. For such a ﬁrst-order system with step input, it is useful to deﬁne a time
constant s.
Let’s look at the response of our system, which is given by Eq. (4.8):
TðtÞ ¼ TN þ ðTi  TNÞ e


hA
rcV

t
(4.8)
The quantity rcV=hA in the exponential term has the units of time and is called the time constant.
s ¼ rcV
hA ¼ Time Constant
Using this deﬁnition, Eq. (4.8) becomes
TðtÞ ¼ TN þ ðTi  TNÞ et=s
(4.14)
Let us consider the process for the system:
At time zero, the system is at Ti. Convection begins and, assuming that Ti is greater than TN, the
system starts to cool toward the ﬂuid temperature TN. After a long period of time (actually inﬁnite time
according to the equation), the system will reach the ﬂuid temperature TN. At any time t during the
process, the temperature of the system is T.
By time t, the system has cooled from its initial temperature Ti to temperature T. For the complete
process, the system cools from Ti to TN.
Therefore, at time t, the system has completed


percent of the complete process. It can
be shown that the process is
63.2% complete after one time constant.
86.5% complete after two time constants.
95.0% complete after three time constants.
98.2% complete after four time constants, and.
99.3% complete after ﬁve time constants.
It is usually said that the process is complete after ﬁve time constants. That is, the system’s
temperature has reached TN in ﬁve time constants.
Let us continue our discussion of item (c) of Example 4.1:
The time constant for Example 4.1 is s ¼ rcV
hA ¼
ð8930Þð390Þð0:000008Þ
ð10Þð0:002Þ
¼ 1393 s
The process is essentially complete after ﬁve time constants, so the answer to item (c) of Example
4.1 is that the cube reaches the air temperature of 20 C in about (5) (1393) ¼ 6965 s or 116 min.
4.3 Systems with spatial variation (large plate, long cylinder, sphere)
4.3.1 Overview
If a body does not meet the criterion for treatment as a lumped system, i.e., if the Biot number is not
small enough, then we must consider the spatial distribution of temperature in the body. In this section,
we consider the transient temperature distributions in large plane plates, long cylinders, and spheres
due to convection boundary conditions.
4.3 Systems with spatial variation (large plate, long cylinder, sphere)
127

What is “large” for the plates and “long” for the cylinders? For the plates, we are theoretically
looking at plates that have a ﬁnite thickness of 2L and inﬁnite lengths in the other two directions. We,
of course, do not really have inﬁnite plates. The plates just have to be large enough so that their spatial
temperature distribution is only a function of one direction, say “x,” whose origin is at the center plane
of the plate. This is shown in Fig. 4.2.
Theoretically, the cylinders are inﬁnitely long. Actually they just have to be long enough so that the
spatial temperature distribution is only a function of radial distance r, whose origin is on the centerline
of the cylinder. The temperature is not a function of the axial distance or angle. This is shown in
Fig. 4.3.
And, for the sphere, the spatial temperature distribution is only a function of radial distance r,
whose origin is at the center of the sphere. The temperature is not a function of angle. This is shown in
Fig. 4.4.

In 1947, Heisler [1] solved the governing differential equations for transient temperature distri-
butions in these three geometries and provided the solutions in graphical form. These solutions are
called the “Heisler Charts” Later, in 1961, Grӧber, Erk, and Grigull [2] extended Heisler’s work and
provided charts giving the total energy transfer during a heating or cooling process. We are not
providing the Heisler and Grӧber charts in this text. Rather, we are providing the solutions for the three
geometries in equation form. Section 4.2 dealt with the lumped method. We will call the method of
this Section 4.3 the Heisler method.

The solution of Eq. (4.16) with conditions (4.17) through (4.19) can be obtained by the separation

The eigenvalues ln are the positive roots of the transcendental equation

(4.22)
where Bi is the Biot number. For plane plates, Bi ¼ h L
k . (As we will see later, the Biot number for
cylinders and spheres of radius ro is Bi ¼ h ro
k .) Among other methods, Eq. (4.22) may be solved for the
ln through use of the Goal Seek or Solver features of Excel or the fzero function of Matlab. See
Appendix J for details.
Once the ln values are determined, the Cn values in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21) may be obtained from
Cn ¼

(4.23)
Note that the trigonometric arguments in this section are in units of radians.
The series in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21) converge rapidly with increasing time due to the exponential
term. If the Fourier number is greater than 0.2, excellent results are obtained using just the ﬁrst term of
the series. This is called the one-term approximation. Keeping just the ﬁrst term, Eq. (4.21) becomes

If we are interested in an earlier time of the system’s response, that is, when Fo ¼ at

just use more terms of the inﬁnite series for the temperature.

The l1 and C1 values are given for different Biot numbers in Table 4.1. If more than one term is
used in the series solution, then the ln can be obtained through solution of Eq. (4.22) and the Cn can
then be obtained from Eq. (4.23).
Before continuing, let us look at Table 4.1. It is seen that there are entries for a Biot number of N.

means that the convective coefﬁcient is inﬁnite. Inﬁnite h means there is zero convective resistance at
the surface. So, the N entry in the table corresponds to a temperature boundary condition. At time
zero, a constant temperature is imposed on the two surfaces of the plate (or the surface of the cylinder
or the surface of the sphere). This temperature is used in place of TN in the above equations.
We are often interested in the amount of energy that is transferred from (or to) the surroundings
during a time period of the process. If a plate is initially uniform at Ti and the process is fully
completed, i.e., the plate is ﬁnally uniform at TN, the decrease in internal energy of the plate is
Qmax ¼ rcVðTi  TNÞ

If the process is only partially completed, the decrease in internal energy is
Q ¼ rc
Z

The decrease in internal energy given in Eq. (4.27) is equal to the energy going into the surrounding

Example 4.2
Cooling of a large plate
Problem
The large stainless steel plate (r ¼ 7900 kg/m3, c ¼ 580 J/kg C, k ¼ 23 W/m C) shown below is 30 cm thick. It is initially
in an oven and at a uniform temperature of 800 C. It is taken out of the oven, and it starts cooling to the 25 C room air. The
convective coefﬁcient is 75 W/m2 C.
(a) Can the lumped method be used for this problem?
(b) How long does it take for the center of the plate to reach 300 C?
(c) What is the surface temperature of the plate at that time?
(d) During the cooling, how much heat goes into the room air?
If your answer is “no” to item (a), you may use the one-term approximation method for items (b), (c), and (d).
30 cm
Ti = 800 C

h = 75 W / m2 C (All surfaces)

(a) We ﬁrst calculate Bilumped to see if we can use the lumped method.
Bilumped ¼ hðV=AÞ
k

23
¼ 0:489
As Bilumped > 0:1 the lumped method is inappropriate. We will consider the spatial distribution of temperatures in the plate
and use the one-term approximation method.

For Bi ¼ 0.489, linear interpolation of entries in Table 4.1 gives l1 ¼ 0:6467 and C1 ¼ 1:0688:

Therefore, a ¼

Taking the natural log of both sides, we get 9:3305  105t ¼ lnð0:3320Þ ¼ 1:1026 and arrive at the answer t

Let us just check Fo and make sure that Fo is greater than 0.2, which is the criterion for use of the one-term approximation
method:
Fo ¼ 2.231  104t ¼ 2.231  104ð11817Þ ¼ 2.636
As Fo > 0.2, our use of the one-term approximation was ﬁne.

Among other methods, Eq. (4.42) may be solved for the ln through use of the Goal Seek or Solver

then be obtained from Eq. (4.43).
We discussed above the amount of energy transferred from a plate to the surroundings during a time
period of the process. We will now do this for a cylinder: If the cylinder is initially uniform at Ti and the
process is fully completed, i.e., the cylinder is ﬁnally uniform at TN, the decrease in internal energy of
the cylinder is

Note: The arguments of the trig functions are in radians.
The series in Eqs. (4.59) and (4.60) converge rapidly with increasing time due to the exponential

If we are interested in an earlier time of the system’s response, that is, when Fo ¼ at

just use more terms of the inﬁnite series for the temperature.
The l1 and C1 values are given for different Biot numbers in Table 4.1. If more than one term is
used in the series solution, then the ln can be obtained through solution of Eq. (4.61) and the Cn can
then be obtained from Eq. (4.62).
Regarding the amount of energy transferred from a sphere to the surroundings during a time period
of the process: If the sphere is initially uniform at Ti and the process is fully completed, i.e., the sphere
is ﬁnally uniform at TN, the decrease in internal energy of the sphere is
Qmax ¼ rcVðTi  TNÞ

where

Cooling of a glass sphere
Problem
A glass sphere (r ¼ 2800 kg/m3, c ¼ 800 J/kg C, k ¼ 0.8 W/m C) is shown in the ﬁgure below. It has a diameter of 2 cm
and is initially at a uniform temperature of 200 C. The sphere then begins cooling to the surrounding ﬂuid that is at 20 C.
The convective coefﬁcient is 20 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the temperature of the center of the sphere after 10 min?
(b) What is the temperature of the surface of the sphere after 10 min?

solve the problem in both waysdwith the lumped method and also with the Heisler method. Doing this, we will be able to
see the amount of spatial variation of temperature in the sphere.

Tð0; 600 sÞ ¼ 20 þ ð200  20Þð1:0736Þe0:84012ð2:143Þ ¼ 62.6 C.

¼ 57.8 C.
The temperature of the surface of the sphere after 600 s is 57.8 C.
For this problem, the value of Bilumped met the 0.1 criterion for use of the lumped method. However, we see that there is still
some variation of temperature within the sphere. We conclude that in cases where theBilumped meets the 0.1 criterion for
use of the lumped method, but where Bilumped is fairly close to 0.1, it is prudent to also perform a Heisler method solution.
We will now do a problem in which the Fourier number is less than 0.2 and multiple terms of the series solutions must be
included for accurate results.
Example 4.4
Cooling of a large sphere
Problem
Note: This example is the same as Example 4.3 except the sphere is considerably larger. Its diameter is 10 cm rather than
2 cm.
A glass sphere (r ¼ 2800 kg/m3, c ¼ 800 J/kg C, k ¼ 0.8 W/m C) has a diameter of 10 cm and is initially at a uniform
temperature of 200 C. The sphere then begins cooling to the surrounding ﬂuid, which is at 20 C. The convective coefﬁcient
is 20 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the temperature of the center of the sphere after 10 min?
(b) What is the temperature of the surface of the sphere after 10 min?
Solution
We ﬁrst check Bilumped to see if the lumped method can be used.
Bilumped ¼ hro

This is considerably greater than 0.1 so the lumped method is inappropriate. We will use the Heisler method.

The center temperature of the sphere is 193.1 C after 600 s of cooling.
It is seen that the series converges very quickly. If we had only used the ﬁrst two terms in the series, the result for the center
temperature would have been 192.9 C.
We showed above that the one-term approximation was inappropriate for this problem as the Fourier number was too
small. Indeed, if we had only used the ﬁrst term of the series, the center temperature after 600 s would have been
Tð0; tÞ ¼ 20 þ 180

Chapter 4 Unsteady conduction

4.4 Multidimensional systems with spatial variation
4.4.1 Overview
Section 4.3 dealt with three geometries: Large (actually inﬁnite) plates of thickness 2L, long (actually
inﬁnitely long) cylinders of radius ro, and spheres of radius ro. These geometries are one-dimensional.
In all three cases, a location in the body can be described by a single parameter: “x” for the plates and
“r” for the cylinders and spheres.
The Heisler method of Section 4.3 can be extended to two- and three-dimensional bodies. Let us
start by visualizing how we can get multidimensional objects from the one-dimensional plates and
cylinders.
First, let us consider two large plates. If they intersect each other at right angles, the intersected
volume is a long (actually inﬁnitely long) bar. If the two plates have the same thickness 2L, then the
cross section of the bar is square. If the two plates have different thicknesses 2L1 and 2L2, then the
cross section of the bar is rectangular. This is shown in Fig. 4.5.
A second object is a short cylinder of length 2L and radius ro. As shown in Fig. 4.6, this object is
created by intersecting a long cylinder of radius ro with a large plate of thickness 2L.
These two examples are two-dimensional objects as a location in the object can be described by
two parameters. In the long bar, a location in the cross section is deﬁned by the “x” locations in the two
2 L2

4.4 Multidimensional systems with spatial variation

intersecting large plates. For the short cylinder, a location in the cylinder is deﬁned by the “x” location
in the plate and the “r” location in the long cylinder.
An example of a three-dimensional object is the rectangular solid. This object is formed by the
intersection of three large plates at right angles to each other. Consider Fig. 4.5 above and envision an
additional vertical plate at right angles to the shown vertical plate. If this second vertical plate cuts
through both the shown vertical plate and the horizontal plate, the intersected volume is a rectangular
solid. Said another way, the rectangular solid is formed by the intersection of three large plates at right
angles to each other. If all three plates have the same thickness, then the object is a cube of side 2L. If
the plates are not all the same thickness, then we have a rectangular solid of dimensions
2L1 by 2L2 by 2L3: A location in the solid is deﬁned by the “x” locations for the three intersecting
large plates. See Fig. 4.7. The rectangular solid is formed by two vertical plates of thickness 2L1 and
2L2, respectively, and a horizontal plate of thickness 2L3:

Chapter 4 Unsteady conduction

It turns out that we can use the Heisler method, discussed in Section 4.3 for one-dimensional
objects, to solve problems involving two- and three-dimensional objects, which are formed by the
intersection of the one-dimensional objects. We simply solve the one-dimensional problems separately
and then multiply these results to get the solutions for the two- and three-dimensional objects. That is,
the product of the solutions for the one-dimensional objects is the solution for the multidimensional
object. The theory behind this technique is discussed in Refs. [3e5].
The following equations outline the solutions for the three multidimensional objects described
above:

For the product solution of multidimensional objects, the ﬂuid temperature TN for the object
must be the same as that for all the one-dimensional objects which were combined to form the object.
The convective coefﬁcients, however, need not be the same on all surfaces of the multidimensional
object. However, they must be the same for the different surfaces of each one-dimensional object
forming the multidimensional object. To clarify this: If we have a short cylinder, the h value on the
ends of the cylinder can be different from the h value on the side of the cylinder. However, both ends
of the cylinder must have the same h value. For the rectangular solid, we can have a maximum of
4.4 Multidimensional systems with spatial variation
145

three different h values. The two surfaces of each intersecting plate must have the same h value, but
the different plates can have different h values.
Regarding the heat transfer from a multidimensional object, Langston [6] showed how the results
from the one-dimensional objects could be combined to get the heat transfer results for the two- or
three-dimensional object formed from the intersection of the one-dimensional objects, as follows:

The following three sections (Sections 4.4.2e4.4.4) include problems illustrating the use of these
equations for the multidimensional objects discussed above, i.e., a long bar, a short cylinder, and a
rectangular solid. The application of the Heisler method to additional geometries may be found in
Refs. [7e10].
4.4.2 Long bar
As shown in Fig. 4.5 above, a long bar is the intersection of two large plates. Example 4.5 illustrates the
application of the Heisler method to this geometry.

The water bath is at 35 C and the bar is 140 C when it enters the water. The bar is in the bath for 10 min. It may be assumed
that the convective coefﬁcient while the bar is in the water bath is 200 W/m2 C.

4.5 Semi-inﬁnite solid
4.5.1 Overview
In this section, we consider a semi-inﬁnite solid, also called a semi-inﬁnite slab. This geometry has one
physical boundary (a plane surface) and extends internally to inﬁnity in all directions. The semi-
inﬁnite solid is shown in Fig. 4.8. The distance from the boundary to a location in the solid is “x.”
4.5 Semi-inﬁnite solid
153

A variety of conditions can be imposed at the boundary. We will consider temperature, heat ﬂux,
and convection boundary conditions.
The semi-inﬁnite geometry is particularly applicable to large, thick bodies and to the earth’s
surface and ground. In addition, bodies can often be modeled as semi-inﬁnite solids during short
periods of time after a change has been made at a surface of a body. During this time period, the change
is felt in the region near the affected surface but has not yet been felt by the other surfaces of the body.
In the analysis that follows, the semi-inﬁnite solid has an initial uniform temperature Ti; the
imposed boundary condition remains constant during its application; and all thermal and physical
properties are constant.
4.5.2 Temperature boundary condition
The semi-inﬁnite solid is initially at uniform temperature Ti. At time t ¼ 0, the temperature of the
surface is suddenly changed to To. The temperature at a depth x at time t is

This equation can be solved by trial and error, that is, guessing a value of x, calculating the right side of the equation, and
seeing if it equals 0.3571. If not, choose another x and try again. Of course, it is much more efﬁcient to use software. Solv-
ing the equation for x using Excel’s Goal Seek gives x ¼ 1.474 m ¼ 4.84 ft.
Being conservative, we will round this answer upwards and conclude that the water pipe should be buried at a depth of 5
feet or greater.

4.6 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed unsteady conduction where temperatures and heat ﬂows in a body vary
with time. The ﬁrst step in an analysis is to calculate the Biot number, Bilumped, to see if the body can be
considered to be a lumped system. If so, all locations in the body at a given time have essentially the
same temperature and a simpliﬁed analysis, the lumped method, can be performed. If the body does
not meet the criterion for lumped system analysis, then we have to consider spatial variation of
temperature in the body. We discussed the Heisler method that provides solutions for spatial variation
in basic geometric shapes such as plates, cylinders, and spheres. We also considered temperature
distributions in semi-inﬁnite solids due to different boundary conditions at the exposed surface of the
solid.
Some bodies have complex shapes that do not fall within the basic geometric categories of this
chapter. In addition, some situations do not meet the requirements of the lumped or Heisler methods.
For example, thermophysical properties may vary with location or time, and the body may not have a
uniform temperature at the beginning of the process. For these cases, problems can often be solved
numerically. This is the topic of the next chapter.
4.7 Problems
Notes:
•
If needed information is not given in the problem statement, then use the Appendix for material
properties and other information. If the Appendix does not have sufﬁcient information, then use
the Internet or other reference sources. Some good reference sources are mentioned at the end of
Chapter 1. If you use the Internet, double-check the validity of the information by using more than
one source.
•
For this chapter, it is often helpful at the beginning of a solution to calculate Bilumped to see if the
lumped method can be used. If you use the Heisler method, you should calculate the Fourier
number to see if the one-term approximation can be used or if more than one term is needed. Of
course, you have to pay close attention to the geometry of the problem to see what sections of the
chapter are relevant.

Your solutions should include a sketch of the problem.

5.1 Introduction
Almost all of the material in previous chapters dealt with bodies having simple geometries, i.e., plates,
cylinders, and spheres, and constant and uniform thermophysical properties. For situations involving
convection, the convective coefﬁcient h and the ﬂuid temperature TN were constant. They did not vary
with time. If radiation was involved, the emissivity ε and the temperature of the surroundings Tsurr
were also time invariant. Additional constraints were also present in the Lumped and Heisler Methods
of Chapter 4. The bodies were required to have uniform temperatures at the beginning of heat transfer
processes. Solutions were for convective, not radiative, boundary conditions. For the ﬂat plate of the
Heisler Method, the convective coefﬁcients on both surfaces had to be the same.
In this chapter, we discuss numerical solution of heat transfer problems. Through the use of
numerical methods, the restrictions mentioned above can be removed. Numerical methods can be
applied to complex, as well as basic geometries, and can be used for situations in which properties and
boundary conditions are nonuniform and varying with time.
Numerical methods for heat transfer problems have been used since at least the 1940s [1e3]. With
the widespread availability of digital computers in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers and students
became able to solve problems that are very difﬁcult or impossible to be solved analytically.
There are several types of numerical methods used in heat transfer, including ﬁnite differences,
ﬁnite elements, boundary elements, and control volumes [4e9]. We discuss the ﬁnite-difference
method in depth and show its application to both steady and unsteady problems. Numerical solu-
tions to several problems will be presented. Some of these problems were solved earlier using other

techniques. For those problems, comparison will be made of the numerical results and the previously
obtained results. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the ﬁnite element method.
After four chapters of differential equations and relatively complex mathematics, many students
will ﬁnd this chapter to be refreshing and a welcome change, although temporary! The chapter only
uses algebra and the three basic equations for the modes of heat transfer:

qconv ¼ hAðTs  TNÞ

(5.3)
In all three equations, A is the area through which heat ﬂows. Eq. (5.1) is for conduction through a
wall of thickness L with surface temperatures T1 and T2: Eq. (5.2) is for convection from a surface at
Ts to a ﬂuid at TN with convective coefﬁcient h. And, in Eq. (5.3) for radiation, ε is the emissivity of
the surface, s is the StefaneBoltzmann constant, Ts is the surface temperature, and Tsurr is the
temperature of the surroundings. We also have to remember that, for radiation, temperatures must be in
absolute temperature unitsdRankine or Kelvin.
5.2 Finite-difference method
Let us ﬁrst consider the meaning of “ﬁnite difference”. In general, the temperature in a body is a
function of location and time. For example, in rectangular Cartesian coordinates, T ¼ Tðx; y; z; tÞ. The
parameters x, y, z, and t are continuous variables over their respective ranges. In the ﬁnite-difference
method, these four parameters are not continuous. They are only deﬁned at speciﬁc locations or times:
nodes for the spatial parameters and time steps for the time parameter.
The ﬁrst step in a ﬁnite-difference analysis is to determine the grid and nodal points for the object.
Let us say that we have a large wall of thickness L. The surface temperatures of the wall are, given, and
we wish to determine the interior temperatures. We can divide the thickness into any number of parts.
For example, if we decide that there should be 10 equally sized parts, the nodal points for the wall will
be as shown in Fig. 5.1.

As the surface temperatures are of primary importance, the two wall surfaces have been selected as
nodal points. The other nodal points are spaced equally across the thickness. The size of increment Dx
is given by
Dx ¼

number of divisions ¼ L

(5.4)
Let us look at Fig. 5.1. Nodes 1 and 11 are on the boundary and hence are called “boundary nodes”
The other nodes, nodes 2 through 10, are “interior nodes” The dashed lines in Fig. 5.1 are the
boundaries between the different nodes. In our ﬁnite-difference analysis, we will be looking at heat
ﬂows into and out of the various nodes. The cross-hatched area in Fig. 5.1 is the extent of node 7. The
node has node 6 on its left and node 8 on its right. Note that the interior nodes 2e10 have widths of Dx
and the boundary nodes 1 and 11 have widths of Dx=2:
Fig. 5.2 shows a rectangular plate that has been given a rectangular grid. There are 16 nodes, and
the increments Dx and Dy are given by
Dx ¼ L1

and Dy ¼ L2

(5.5)
There are three cross-hatched areas in Fig. 5.2, which show the extents of corner node 1, interior
node 7, and edge node 15. (A hint: To determine the extent of a given node, just go halfway to all
adjacent nodes and box-in the area.)
For the rectangular plate of Fig. 5.2, L2 ¼ 2L1. Therefore, we could have used a square grid, as
shown in Fig. 5.3.
The new grid has 28 nodes instead of the original 16 nodes. Increment Dx is still L1=3, but Dy is
now L2=6: When the temperatures at these 28 nodes are determined, we will have a better knowledge

of the temperature distribution in the plate than we would have obtained with the original 16 nodes.
Actually, we could have used an even larger number of smaller nodes to get an even more-detailed
indication of the temperature distribution in the plate.
In the next section, we will be formulating ﬁnite difference equations to solve for the nodal
temperatures. Such equations can certainly be obtained for a rectangular grid. However, we will see
that use of a square grid provides some simpliﬁcations.
Grids and nodes can also be established for other geometries. For example, consider Fig. 5.4 that
shows a circular plate.
There are ﬁve equally spaced nodes in Fig. 5.4. The distance between nodal points is Dr. If the
outer radius of the plate is ro, then the increment Dr ¼ ro=4: The dashed lines in Fig. 5.4 show the
boundaries of the various nodes. The center node, node 1, is a circular area. The other four nodes are
ring areas. As an example, the cross-hatched area is node 4. Note that the interior nodes 2, 3, and 4 have
widths of Dr. Center node 1 is circular with a radius of Dr=2: Boundary node 5 is a ring of width Dr= 2:
5.2.1 Steady state
In this section, we will develop ﬁnite difference equations for steady-state heat transfer in one and two-
dimensional objects.
Fig. 5.5 shows some nodes in a one-dimensional object.
For steady state, temperatures and heat ﬂows are constant; they do not change with time. Let us
look at the possible heat ﬂows for node i. There is conduction between node i and its two adjacent
nodes i1 and iþ1. And, there may be convection and/or radiation at the upper, lower, front, and/or

back boundaries of node i. (There could also be imposed heat ﬂuxes at these boundaries or the
boundaries could be insulated.) Finally, there may also be internal heat generation within node i at a
volumetric strength of qgen.
For steady state, from conservation of energy, the total rate of heat ﬂow into node i equals the total
rate of heat ﬂow out of node i. Fig. 5.6 shows the heat ﬂows for node i.
We have assumed that the incoming ﬂows are the conduction from node i1 and the internal heat
generation and that the outgoing ﬂows are the convection to the adjacent ﬂuid, the radiation to the
surroundings, and the conduction to node iþ1. We actually do not know the directions of the
conductive, convective, or radiative ﬂows until we solve the ﬁnite-difference equations and determine
the temperatures in the object. However, we need to assume directions so we can write the energy

conservation equation. (Remember that the direction of heat ﬂow is from the higher temperature to the
lower temperature.)
The energy conservation equation is: heat ﬂow in ¼ heat ﬂow out. For node i we have
qði1Þ/i þ qgenerated ¼ qrad þ qconv þ qi/ðiþ1Þ
(5.6)
Using Eqs. (5.1), (5.2), and (5.3) for the various heat ﬂows, Eq. (5.6) becomes

The direction of the internal heat generation is, of course, into node i. But, we have assumed the
directions for the other heat ﬂows and have written the terms in Eq. (5.7) accordingly. An alternative
way to write the energy conservation equation is to assume that all the heat ﬂows are into the node.
Then, rather than heat ﬂow in ¼ heat ﬂow out, the energy conservation equation for steady-state would
be: total heat ﬂow in ¼ 0. Let us do that. We will assume that all heat ﬂows are into node i. The energy
conservation equation is then

Comparing Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8), it is seen that the equations are identical.
To summarize, we can assume the directions for the different heat ﬂows associated with a node and
write an equation using heat ﬂow in ¼ heat ﬂow out. Alternatively, we can assume that all heat ﬂows
are into the node and write an equation using total heat ﬂow in ¼ 0. The author prefers the second
approach, and that is the way we will determine the ﬁnite-difference equations for nodes.
Eq. (5.8) is the ﬁnite-difference equation for node i. Similar equations can be developed for all the
other nodes in the object. The equations may then be solved simultaneously for the nodal temperatures.

Chapter 5 Numerical methods (steady and unsteady)

Continuing our discussion of one-dimensional steady-state numerical analysis, let us now look
again at the pin ﬁn of Example 3.11. The heat ﬂow for the ﬁn was determined analytically in Chapter 3.
Let us determine the heat ﬂow numerically and compare the two answers.
Example 5.1
Heat transfer from a pin ﬁn
Problem
A pin ﬁn (k ¼ 250 W/m C) is attached to a wall. The ﬁn’s diameter is 1.5 cm, and it is 10 cm long. The wall is at 200 C. The
surrounding air is at 15 C and the convective coefﬁcient is 9 W/m2 C. Determine, numerically, the rate of heat transfer
from the ﬁn to the surrounding air.
Solution
As discussed in Chapter 3, ﬁns are attached to surfaces to enhance the heat transfer. This problem was solved analytically
as Example 3.11. We now solve it numerically and compare the result with that of the analytical solution.
The ﬁrst step is to determine the grid for the problem. We decided to have the grid shown in Fig. 5.7. There are 11 nodes.
Node 1 is at the wall and node 11 is at the end of the ﬁn. These are boundary nodes. The other nodes (nodes 2 through 10)
are interior nodes. The spacing between nodes is uniform with Dx ¼ 1 cm ¼ 0.01 m. We wanted nodal points at the wall
and at the end of the ﬁn, so nodes 1 and 11 have widths of Dx=2: The other nodes have widths of Dx:
The temperature of node 1 is known. It is the wall temperature, i.e., 200 C. The other nodal temperatures are determined
through simultaneous solution of the 10 ﬁnite-difference equations for nodes 2 through 11.
Let us determine the equation for node 2. The node gets heat by conduction from adjacent nodes 1 and 3. It also gets heat
by convection from the surrounding ﬂuid. As discussed above, we will assume that all heat ﬂows are into node 2. We have
q1/2 þ q3/2 þ qN/2 ¼ 0
(5.9)
Putting in the expressions for the three heat ﬂows, Eq. (5.9) becomes
kA
Dx ðT1  T2Þ þ kA
Dx ðT3  T2Þ þ hPDxðTN  T2Þ ¼ 0
(5.10)
In Eq. (5.10), P is the perimeter p D of the ﬁn, and A is the cross section area p D2/4 of the ﬁn. D is the diameter of the ﬁn.
Equations similar to Eq. (5.10) can be written for the other eight interior nodes, i.e., nodes 3e10. The only thing that
changes is the subscripts on the temperatures. That is.
For i ¼ 3 to 10,
kA
Dx ðTi1  TiÞ þ kA
Dx ðTiþ1  TiÞ þ hPDxðTN  TiÞ ¼ 0
(5.11)
Node 11 is a special node. It is a boundary node and gets conduction from node 10 and convection from the side and end of
the ﬁn. Its nodal equation is
kA
Dx ðT10  T11Þ þ hP Dx

Eqs. (5.10), (5.11), and (5.12) can be solved simultaneously for the 10 unknown temperatures T2 through T11: (Remember
T1 is a given. It is 200 C)
For this problem, k ¼ 250 W/m C, h ¼ 9 W/m2 C, D ¼ 1.5 cm ¼ 0.015 m, Dx ¼ 1 cm ¼ 0.01 m, P ¼ p D ¼ 0.047124 m,
A ¼ p D2/4 ¼ 0.00017672 m2, TN ¼ 15 C, and T1 ¼ 200:
Putting these values into Eqs. (5.10), (5.11), and (5.12), we have the following 10 equations to solve for the unknown tem-
peratures T2 through T11:
8:840T2 þ 4:418T3 ¼ 883:66
(5.13)
4:418T2  8:840T3 þ 4:418T4 ¼ 0:06362

(5.16)
4:418T5  8:840T6 þ 4:418T7 ¼ 0:06362
(5.17)
4:418T6  8:840T7 þ 4:418T8 ¼ 0:06362
(5.18)
4:418T7  8:840T8 þ 4:418T9 ¼ 0:06362
(5.19)
4:418T8  8:840T9 þ 4:418T10 ¼ 0:06362
(5.20)
4:418T9  8:840T10 þ 4:418T11 ¼ 0:06362
(5.21)
4:418T10  4:4217T11 ¼ 0:05567
(5.22)
It is seen that these equations are linear equations with constant coefﬁcients. Several methods are available to solve these
simultaneous equations. We will discuss their solution by matrix inversion, the GausseSeidel method, and the Excel add-
in Solver.
Matrix Inversion:
Equations (5.13) through (5.22) can be written in the matrix form

(5.23)
where A is the 10  10 matrix of the coefﬁcients, T is the column vector of the 10 unknown temperatures, and B is the
column vector of the constants on the right-hand sides of the equations. That is

Chapter 5 Numerical methods (steady and unsteady)

To obtain the temperatures of vector T, we ﬁrst determine the inverse AL1 of the coefﬁcients matrix A. The inverse is then
multiplied by vector B to get the temperatures. That is
T ¼ A1B
(5.24)
The following outlines the procedures for solution using Excel and Matlab. Detailed instructions are included for Excel,
and the reader is encouraged to run the program to get experience in solving equations by matrix inversion using Excel.
Procedures are also given below for Matlab solution.
In the Excel spreadsheet, we choose locations for the following four areas: a 10  10 block for matrix A, a 10  10 block
for the inverse AL1 of A, a 10-element column for B, and a 10-element column where we want to have the temperatures.
For example, let us decide to put matrix A in block A1:J10, matrix AL1 in block A12:J21, vector B in column A23:A32,
and vector T in column A34:A43. We enter the values of the elements for A and B and then proceed as follows:
To get the inverse matrix AL1, highlight the block A12:J21 and then enter the formula ¼ MINVERSE(A1:J10) in cell
A12. Press CtrlþShiftþEnter. You will see the elements of the AL1 matrix appear. As shown in Eq. (5.24), we then
have to multiply AL1 by B to get the temperatures. To do this, we highlight the column A34:A43 and then enter the for-
mula ¼ MMULT(A12:J21,A23:A32) in cell A34. Press CtrlþShiftþEnter and the elements of vector Twill appear. These
elements are the desired values of T2 through T11.
For Matlab, the solution may be achieved interactively or through use of an m-ﬁle. Matrix A and vector B are deﬁned by
assignment statements, and the temperatures T2 through T11 are obtained by the statement T ¼ inv(A)B or T ¼ A\B. The
m-ﬁle for the solution is given in Appendix K.
The results using matrix inversion were the same for both Matlab and Excel. The T2 through T11 temperatures were
198.40, 196.96, 195.69, 194.58, 193.64, 192.85, 192.23, 191.76, 191.45, and 191.31 C. From the problem statement,
T1 ¼ 200 C.
It should be noted that the matrix inversion method is only appropriate for the solution of linear simultaneous equations. If
some equations are nonlinear (e.g., if we have radiative heat transfer and there are T4 terms), then matrix inversion cannot
be used. We now discuss the GausseSeidel method and the Excel Solver add-in. These methods can be used for both linear
and nonlinear equations.
GausseSeidel Method:
This is a very useful method that can be used to solve both linear and nonlinear simultaneous equations. Let us return to the
10 equations of this problem, i.e., Eqs. (5.13)e(5.22). Eq. (5.13) was for node 2, Eq. (5.14) was for node 3, etc. Let us
rearrange the equations for solution by the GausseSeidel Method:
Eq. (5.13), for node two is
8:840T2 þ 4:418T3 ¼ 883:66
(5.13)
Rearrange the equation so that T2 is the only item on the left side of the equal sign. Doing this, we get
T2 ¼ 0:4998T3 þ 99:962
(5.25)
The equation for node 3 is
4:418T2  8:840T3 þ 4:418T4 ¼ 0:06362
(5.14)
Rearranging this so that T3 is the only item left of the equal sign, we get
T3 ¼ 0:4998ðT2 þ T4Þ þ 0:007197
(5.26)
Continuing this for the other eight equations, we have
T4 ¼ 0:4998ðT3 þ T5Þ þ 0:007197
(5.27)
T5 ¼ 0:4998ðT4 þ T6Þ þ 0:007197

(5.32)
T10 ¼ 0:4998ðT9 þ T11Þ þ 0:007197
(5.33)
T11 ¼ 0:9992T10 þ 0:01259
(5.34)
5.2 Finite-difference method
171

Using Matlab or similar software, the solution of these 10 equations (Eqs. 5.25 through 5.34) is obtained by successive
looping through all the equations, one equation after another. Each time an equation is executed, the right side of the equa-
tion is calculated and the result becomes a new value for the temperature on the left side of the equation. After each com-
plete loop through all the equations, we have new values for all the temperatures. Before starting the process, we have to
give starting values for the unknown temperatures. For this particular problem, the base temperature is 200 C and the ﬂuid
temperature is 15 C. Initial guesses in this temperature range would be reasonable. When a loop is performed for all 10
equations, all the temperatures have been given new values. If the GausseSeidel Method is successful, successive looping
will result in convergence where the temperatures do not change with additional looping. For our equations, the method is
usually successful. As mentioned above, this method can be used for nonlinear, as well as linear, sets of equations. If the
equations are nonlinear, convergence may be affected by the initial guesses for the temperatures. If the temperatures do not
converge, try other starting temperatures. The Matlab program for this problem is given in Appendix K.
The Excel Solver add-in program:
Excel Solver, which comes with the Excel software, is a very useful program for solving both linear and nonlinear simul-
taneous equations. We will use it to solve for the temperatures in this Example 5.1, as follows:
We will solve the nodal equations, Eqs. (5.25) through (5.34). Alternatively, we could solve Eqs. (5.13) through (5.22) as
they are the same equations as (5.25) through (5.34).
Proceeding with Solver:
Starting with Eq. (5.25), rearrange the equation so that everything is to the left of the equal sign.
T2 ¼ 0:4998T3 þ 99:962
(5.25)
Eq. (5.25) then becomes
T2  0:4998T3  99:962 ¼ 0
(5.35)
Do this with the other nine nodal equations. Eqs. (5.26) through (5.34) then become
T3  0:4998ðT2 þ T4Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.36)
T4  0:4998ðT3 þ T5Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.37)
T5  0:4998ðT4 þ T6Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.38)
T6  0:4998ðT5 þ T7Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.39)
T7  0:4998ðT6 þ T8Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.40)
T8  0:4998ðT7 þ T9Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.41)
T9  0:4998ðT8 þ T10Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.42)
T10  0:4998ðT9 þ T11Þ  0:007197 ¼ 0
(5.43)
T11  0:9992T10  0:01259 ¼ 0
(5.44)
Looking at these 10 equations, we see that the left sides of the equations are all functions of the unknown temperatures
T2 through T11: Let us call these functions f2 through f11, respectively.
For example, from Eq. (5.35), f2 ¼ T2  0:4998T3  99:962. From Eq. (5.36), f3 ¼ T3  0:4998ðT2 þT4Þ  0:007197,
etc.
So, if we ﬁnd temperatures such that all the functions f2 through f11 are equal to zero, then we have solved the nodal
equations. Now comes the main part to get ready for using Solver: The requirement that all 10 functions be zero can
be reduced to a single requirement; namely, that the sum of the squares of all the functions be zero.
That is, we have the solution to the nodal equations if

Chapter 5 Numerical methods (steady and unsteady)

Now on to Solver:
Open a new Excel spreadsheet. We decided to put the temperatures in the column A2 through A11. We need starting values
(i.e., initial guesses) for the temperatures, so we put 200 in these 10 temperature cells. We entered the functions
f2 through f11 , one-by-one, into the column C2 through C11. For example, cell C2 for function f2 is ¼ A2  0.4998
 A3  99.962. We then entered the squares of the functions, f 2
2
through f 2
11;
one-by-one, into the column E2
through E11. Finally, we entered ¼SUM(E2:E11) into cell G1.
Calling up the Solver program, we instructed the program to make G1 zero by changing cells A2 through A11. We pressed
Solve. The temperature values changed, but we got a statement that a solution could not be found. This often happens if the
program does not get a result close enough to the required value of zero. In our case, the value in G1 was quite small,
0.00124, but not small enough for the program to declare a success. We reran the program asking it to make G1 a minimum
rather than zero and got the same answers as before, but now the program declared that it was successful. Even though G1
was not zero, it was quite small, and the values for all the functions were also small. Hence, we decided to accept the tem-
perature values that were, from T2 through T11: 198.38, 196.92, 195.62, 194.48, 193.49, 192.67, 192.01, 191.53, 191.21,
and 191.06 C. From the problem statement, T1 ¼ 200 C.
To summarize, we solved the nodal equations using the following methods: matrix inversion with Excel and Matlab,
GausseSeidel with Matlab, and Excel Solver. The two matrix inversion solutions gave the same results for the tempera-
tures. The GausseSeidel and Solver runs gave results slightly different from each other and slightly different from the
matrix inversion results. This was expected, as the GausseSeidel and Solver computational methods are different and
are iterative. But the bottom line is that the results from all methods were close to each other and all were deemed
acceptable.
We will use the temperature results to ﬁnally solve this problem, namely, to determine the heat ﬂow from the ﬁn. Recalling
the discussion on ﬁns in Chapter 3, the heat ﬂow can be determined by looking at the heat ﬂow into the ﬁn from the base or
by considering the heat ﬂow by convection into the ﬂuid. It turns out that looking at the convection to the ﬂuid is the better
alternative, for the following reason:
The heat ﬂow into the ﬁn at the base is q ¼ kA

vT


x¼0
: In our ﬁnite-difference model, the partial derivative is
approximated by ðT2T1Þ
Dx
: As the grid is quite coarse, this approximation does not accurately represent the partial
derivative. If we had taken additional smaller nodes near the base, we would have obtained a better result for ðvT= vxÞ
and a more accurate result for heat ﬂow q.
So, let us sum up the convective heat ﬂows from the different nodes to the ﬂuid. Looking at Fig. 5.7, we have
q ¼ hPðDx = 2ÞðT1  TNÞ þ

Putting, into Eq. (5.47), the above-noted temperatures for the matrix inversion solution and the values of the other pa-
rameters in the problem, it is found that the heat ﬂow from the ﬁn to the ﬂuid is 7.89 W. This is only a 0.25% difference
from the 7.87 W result obtained for the identical Example 3.11 of Chapter 3 which was done analytically.
After this long, but needed, discussion of solution methods, let us move on to derive nodal
equations for two-dimensional objects.
Fig. 5.8 shows a ﬂat plate with a rectangular grid. Nodes are of size Dx by Dy. Let us derive the
steady-state nodal equation for node (i, j), which is an internal node for the plate, i.e., the node is not on
a boundary.
5.2 Finite-difference method
173

Node (i, j) is surrounded by nodes (i1, j), (iþ1, j), (i, j1), and (i, jþ1). Let us assume that all heat
ﬂows are into node (i, j) and that there could also be internal heat generation at volumetric strength
qgen: Node i gets conductive heat ﬂow from the four surrounding nodes and also heat from the internal
generation. To better visualize the energy balance, let us give the plate a thickness “b.” This thickness
will ultimately cancel out of the equation.
Looking at the ﬁve heat ﬂows into (i, j), we have

Finally, if conductivity k is uniform throughout the body and we have a square grid, i.e., Dx ¼ Dy;
Eq. (5.50) becomes
Ti1;j þ Tiþ1;j þ Ti;j1 þ Ti;jþ1  4Ti;j ¼ 0

Rearranging this equation, we get

(5.52)
Eq. (5.52) says that the temperature of a node is the average of the temperatures of the four sur-
rounding nodes.
The above nodal equations are for an interior node. Similar equations can be written for the other
interior nodes of the object.
Eqs. (5.49) through (5.52) were derived for an interior node (i, j) by considering an energy balance
on the node. They could have alternatively been obtained through converting the appropriate differ-
ential equation to a numerical form, as follows:

The boundary node (i, j) gets heat by conduction from its three surrounding nodes, possible heat

Example 5.2
Rectangular plate with temperature boundary conditions
Problem
The rectangular plate shown in Fig. 5.12 has temperature boundary conditions. Determine, numerically, the temperatures
at the four internal nodes for steady conditions.
Solution
The nodal spacing is Dx ¼ 20 cm and Dy ¼ 10 cm. There is no internal heat generation. The four nodes are interior nodes,
so we can use Eq. (5.50).

Rearranging Eq. (5.68), the equation for temperature T1 becomes

(5.70)
T2 ¼ 0:5T1 þ 2T4 þ 400

Continuing the same procedure for nodes 3 and 4, we get

(5.72)
and
T4 ¼ 0:5T3 þ 2T2 þ 1200

(5.73)
Solving Eqs. (5.69), (5.71), (5.72), and (5.73) by GausseSeidel, we got the results
T1¼ 241.3;
T2¼ 255.6;
T3¼ 364.4;
T4¼ 378.7 C
An alternative way of solving this problem is to change the grid from a rectangular grid to a square grid, as shown in
Fig. 5.13.
There are more nodes and equations (10 vs. 4), but it is easier to write the equations as the ratio Dy=Dx becomes 1. Eq.
(5.52) shows that, for an interior node and a square grid, a nodal temperature is simply the average of the temperatures of
the four surrounding nodes. The equations for the 10 nodes of this revised grid can be quickly written by inspection.
For example, the temperature of node 1 is (300 þ 100 þ T2 þ T6)/4; the temperature of node 2 is (T1 þ 100 þ T3 þ T7)/4,
etc. Solving the 10 equations by GausseSeidel, we got the below results:
T1¼ 248.0;
T2¼ 238.4;
T3¼ 240.1;
T4¼ 250.9;

In this revised, ﬁner grid, node 2 is the same as the original node 1; node 4 is the same as the original node 2; node 7 is the
same as the original node 3, and node 9 is the same as the original node 4. Using the labeling of the original grid, the
result is

It is seen that there is a small difference between the results of the two models. In general, a ﬁner grid gives more accurate
results than a coarser grid unless the grid is so ﬁne that round-off error becomes signiﬁcant.
The Matlab programs for both the 4-node and 10-node models are in Appendix K.
(Note: Although this problem was for a plate, it could have been for a long column of rectangular cross section having
different temperatures on its four sides.)
Example 5.2 only had interior nodes. The next example has boundary, as well as interior, nodes.
It also has internal heat generation.
Example 5.3
Plate with a variety of boundary conditions and heat generation
Problem
The plate shown in Fig. 5.14 has a variety of boundary conditions. The left surface is isothermal at 500 C. The bottom
surface is isothermal at 100 C. The top and right surfaces are insulated, and the inside corner on the left has convection
to a ﬂuid. The convective coefﬁcient is 100 W/m2 C, and the ﬂuid temperature is 30 C. The plate is steel and has a
conductivity of 43 W/m C. The grid is square with Dx ¼ Dy ¼ 8 cm.
(a) If there is no internal heat generation, determine the nodal temperatures for steady state.
(b) If the plate has internal heat generation at a strength of 106 W/m3, determine the nodal temperatures for steady state.

Solution
Let us start the solution by deriving the nodal equations. For a particular node, we assume that all heat ﬂows go into the
node and we sum up the heat ﬂows to zero. Again, we will use “b" as the thickness of the plate. As Part (b) has heat gen-
eration, we will include the heat generation term in the nodal equations.
Insulated nodes (2, 3, 4, 8, 10):
Each node gets heat ﬂow by conduction from its adjacent nodes. For node 2, we have conduction from nodes 1, 3, and 6.
The nodal equation is

We will solve the nodal equations by matrix inversion. We have a square grid ðDx ¼ DyÞ, which simpliﬁes the equations
considerably. To use matrix inversion, we need to rearrange the terms in Eqs. (5.74)e(5.82) to facilitate creation of a co-
efﬁcients matrix and a constants vector. Doing this, and incorporating the square matrix feature, the equations become

The Matlab program for this solution is in Appendix K.
(Note: Although this problem was for a plate, it could have been for a long L-shaped structural support having different
conditions on its various surfaces.)
Let us now move on to a discussion of numerical solution of unsteady problems.
5.2.2 Unsteady state
If we have unsteady heat ﬂow in an object, we have to consider time, as well as location. For steady
state, we had spatial increments such as Dx and Dy. For unsteady state, we have a time increment, or
“step,” Dt in addition to the spatial increments. As shown in Fig. 5.15, the time scale progresses from
the origin at time zero, to one time step (Dt), two time steps (2Dt), three time steps (3Dt), etc.
5.2 Finite-difference method

In general, temperatures in an object are known at the beginning of a process, i.e., at time zero.
Problem solution proceeds from one time step to the next, with temperatures being determined for each
successive time step.
Let us now determine an energy conservation equation for unsteady state situations. Fig. 5.16
shows an interior node i in a one-dimensional object.
Nodes i1 and iþ1 are the two nodes adjacent to node i. There is conductive heat ﬂow between
these nodes and node i. There may also be internal heat generation. Like steady state, we will consider
all heat ﬂows to be into a node. A positive net heat ﬂow into node i will increase the node’s internal
energy. A negative net heat ﬂow into node i will decrease the node’s internal energy. Let us look at the
change in internal energy of node i during a time increment Dt: In words, we have
The net heat flow into Node i ¼ Change in internal energy of material
during time Dt

Eq. (5.96) describes the change in internal energy during one time step Dt. The terms on the left are
the heat ﬂows into node i during the time step. We have the heat ﬂow rates times Dt to give the heat
quantity into node i during the time step. The change in internal energy of the material in node i during
the time step is on the right side of Eq. (5.96). This internal energy change causes a change in tem-
perature of the node. At the beginning of the time step, the temperature of node i is Tb
i : At the end of
the time step, the temperature is Te
i : Let us talk a little more about these temperatures.
For numerical ﬁnite differences, time is not continuous. Rather, it is a series of successive, discrete
time steps. Temperatures are deﬁned at the beginning and end of these time steps. In Eq. (5.96),
temperature superscript “b” designates temperatures at the beginning of the time step, and superscript
“e” designates temperatures at the end of the time step. Looking at the left side of Eq. (5.96), it is seen
that the heat ﬂows into the node are based on temperatures at the beginning of the time step. We need
temperatures at both the beginning and the end of the time step on the right side of Eq. (5.96) as we
need the temperature change for the step.
Equations like Eq. (5.96) may be written for all interior nodes in an object. Let us rearrange the
equation so that Te
i is on the left side of the equation. Doing this, we have

Interior node (i, j) gets conduction from surrounding nodes (i1, j), (iþ1, j), (i, j1), and (i, jþ1). It
also may get heat from internal heat generation. Like the one-dimensional case, a positive net heat ﬂow
into node (i, j) will raise the internal energy of the node. The energy conservation equation for node (i,
j) is

Eq. (5.101) states that the temperature of node (i, j) at the end of the time step is equal to the
average of the temperatures of the four surrounding nodes at the beginning of the time step.
Energy conservation equations may also be written for boundary nodes. Consider, for example, the
corner in Fig. 5.18, which has convection from the adjacent ﬂuid and conduction from nodes (i, jþ1)
and (iþ1, j).

We can write nodal equations similar to Eqs. (5.97), (5.99), (5.100), (5.101), (5.103), and (5.104)
for all the interior and boundary nodes of a problem. If we look at these equations, it is seen from the
superscripts that the temperature on the left side of the equation is the temperature at the end of a time
step and all the temperatures on the right side are temperatures at the beginning of a time step. In
solving the equations, we work forward in time. For each time step, we know the temperatures at the
beginning of the time step. We calculate the right sides of the equations, and the result becomes the
temperatures on the left side of the equation. Then we continue with the next time step. The tem-
peratures we got on the left side of the equations now become the beginning temperatures for the next
time step. We use these temperatures on the right side of the equations to calculate end temperatures
for the time step. And, the process continues for as many time steps as we desire. For steady-state
problems we had to simultaneously solve the nodal equations. For unsteady problems, we simply
list the equations, one after another, and go through the equations successively. We calculate the right-
hand sides of the equations using temperatures that we already know and we get new temperatures on
the left sides of the equations that are temperatures at the end of that time step. These temperatures are
now used on the right sides of the equations to determine the temperatures at the end of the next time
step. This procedure can be easily done using loops in Matlab or iterations in Excel.
We will give a few examples of the procedure, but let us ﬁrst discuss the determination of time
increment Dt.
When we solve a problem, we ﬁrst decide on the spatial increments such as Dx, Dy, Dz, Dr, etc. We
then decide on what time increment Dt to use. The above nodal equations were developed using the
forward-difference or explicit approach. As described above, we know the temperatures at the
beginning of the time step and we get the temperatures at the end of the time step using the nodal

equations. We are working forward in time. It turns out that selection of the spatial and time increments
are not independent with this forward-difference approach. If we decide on too large a Dt, the pro-
cedure will be unstable and not result in the correct solution.
What is “too large” for Dt ? Let us look at Eq. (5.97), which is the equation for an interior node (i) in
a one-dimensional object, and Eq. (5.99), which is the equation for an interior node (i, j) in a two-
dimensional object. The coefﬁcients for nodes (i) and (i, j) in these equations must be zero or posi-
tive for a stable solution. If Dt is too large, the coefﬁcients become negative and the solution is un-
stable. That is, for the forward-difference approach,

(5.106)
These restrictions on the size of Dt are based on interior points in a body. If there are boundary
nodes, Dt may have to be a bit smaller. See, for example, Eq. (5.103), which is for a two-dimensional
boundary node with convection. The coefﬁcient for node (i, j) needs to be zero or positive, and the
convection term makes the acceptable Dt smaller than that given by Eq. (5.106).
As a practical matter, these restrictions on Dt usually have no impact. Most of the time we are able
to use a Dt meeting the criteria. However, if we really need to use a larger Dt, then we can use the
backward-difference or implicit approach. With this approach, the spatial and time increments are
independent, and there is no restriction on the size of Dt. However, as we will see, much more
computation is needed for the backward-difference approach than for the forward-difference approach.
Let us look at this backward-difference approach. The previous equation we had for an interior node in
a two-dimensional object was

The temperature differences on the left side of the equation have superscript “b," which means they
are the differences at the beginning of the time step. Let us instead make these differences the dif-
ferences at the end of the time step. That is, we will give them the superscript “e."

All items in the coefﬁcient for Ti;j in Eq. (5.108) are now positive, and there is no restriction on the
size of Dt. Similar equations may be written for all nodes in an object, giving us a set of equations to
solve for the temperatures at the end of a time step. Unfortunately, there are many unknowns in each
equation: namely, the temperatures of the various nodes at the end of the time step. We have to solve
the set of equations simultaneously to get the temperatures at the end of each time step before we can
move forward to the next time step. The computational effort is much more than we had with the
forward-difference approach. In using the backward-difference approach, we have eliminated the size
restriction on Dt, but we have increased the computational effort greatly. With the forward-difference
approach, we merely looped through the nodal equations, getting new values for the temperatures and
working forward one time step per loop. With the backward-difference approach, we have to solve
simultaneous equations for the temperatures for each time step as we work forward in time.
We will now give some examples illustrating solution of unsteady state problems.
Example 5.4
Rectangular plate with unsteady conduction
Problem
The stainless steel (k ¼ 15 W/m C, r ¼ 7900 kg/m3, c ¼ 477 J/kg C) plate shown in Fig. 5.19 has an initial uniform tem-
perature of 30 C. At time zero, the boundary temperatures shown in the ﬁgure are imposed on the plate.
(a) How long does it take for node 1 to reach 150 C and what are the temperatures of the other nodes at that time?
(b) What are the steady-state temperatures for the nodes?
(c) How long does it take for the plate to achieve steady state?
Solution
The four nodes of the plate are interior nodes. Each node is surrounded by four other nodes. If we call the node we are
writing the equation for “node (i, j),” then the surrounding nodes are nodes (i1, j), (iþ1, j), (i, j1), and (i, jþ1). There
is no internal heat generation. Therefore, Eq. (5.99), with qgen ¼ 0, can be used to obtain the nodal equations. This equa-
tion is

One of the ﬁrst things to do is decide on a time step. For the forward-difference approach, the bracketed expression
 
1 2 aDt

cannot be negative. This limits the size of Dt. For this problem, Dx ¼ 0:2 m and Dy ¼ 0:1 m
and a ¼ k
rc ¼
15
ð7900Þð477Þ ¼ 3:981  106 m2=s.
Putting these values into the bracketed expression, it is found that Dt must be less than or equal to 1004 s. We used a Dt of
1 s, certainly well within the limit. A small Dt will give more-accurate results. A time step of 10 s gave very good results
and a time step of 100 s gave good results. Above that time step, the results were not accurate.
(a) The Matlab program for this problem is in Appendix K. The four nodes are given initial values of 30 C and then the
program loops through Eq. (5.110)e(5.113) successively. Each loop (or pass) moves the time ahead one Dt. When
node 1 reaches 150 C, the program stops and prints out all the nodal temperatures.
The program took 2134 loops for node 1 to reach 150 C. With Dt ¼ 1 s, this means node 1 reached 150 C in
2134 s [ 35.6 min. At this time, T2 [ 161.1 C, T3 [ 265.3 C, and T4 [ 276.4 C.
(b) We ran the program without the T1 ¼ 150 breakpoint to see what ﬁnal temperatures would be reached. For 19,300
loops and greater, the temperatures did not change. Steady state had been reached. Final temperatures were
T1 [ 241.3 C, T2 [ 255.6 C, T3 [ 364.4 C, and T4 [ 378.7 C. These temperatures are the same as we got for the
GausseSeidel solution to Example 5.2, which was the steady-state problem for this geometry.
(c) As mentioned in Part (b): By running the program to steady-state conditions, we found that temperatures stopped
changing and steady state was reached in 19,300 loops, or 19,300 s ¼ 5.4 h. We may wish to deﬁne steady state a bit
less stringently, as follows: Earlier in this text, we mentioned that, for a ﬁrst-order system, a process is often
considered to be complete after ﬁve time constants. At this point, the process is actually 99.33% complete. Let us
consider node 1. For its process, the node goes from an initial 30 C to a ﬁnal 241.3 C. The process is therefore a
temperature change of 241.3e30 or 211.3 C. The 99.33% change for the process is 211.3  0.9933 ¼ 209.9 C,
which gives a ﬁnal temperature of 30 þ 209.9 ¼ 239.9 C. Running the Matlab program again, it is found that node 1
reaches 239.9 C in 10,610 s ¼ 2.95 h. Similar results are found for the other three nodes. So, if we use this “ﬁve time
constant” criterion, we could say that steady state is essentially reached after 3 h.
(Note: Although this problem was for a plate, it could have been for a long column of rectangular cross section having
different temperatures on its four sides.)
We now look at an example in cylindrical coordinates, which have both convection and radiation
boundary conditions.
Example 5.5
Disk with convection and radiation
Problem
The stainless steel disk (k ¼ 15 W/m C, r ¼ 7900 kg/m3, c ¼ 477 J/kg C) shown in Fig. 5.20 has a diameter of 8 cm and a
thickness of 1 cm. It is perfectly insulated on the bottom and has convection and radiation from the top. The top surface has
190
Chapter 5 Numerical methods (steady and unsteady)

an emissivity of 0.5 and a convective coefﬁcient of 100 W/m2 C. Radiation is to the surroundings that are at 20 C, and
convection is to a ﬂuid also at 20 C. There is an electric heater tape on the side of the disk that inputs 300 W into the disk.
The disk is initially uniform at 20 C. The heater tape is then turned on. Assume that the temperature in the disk varies only
radially. There is no axial variation.
(a) Assume there are ﬁve nodes as shown in the top view of the disk in Fig. 5.21. What are the nodal temperatures
4 minutes after the heater is turned on?
(b) What are the nodal temperatures of the disk at steady state?
Solution
Let us ﬁrst get the areas and volumes for the ﬁve nodes. Looking at Fig. 5.21, the areas on the top surface in contact with
the surroundings are

Each node gets conduction from adjacent nodes. The thickness of the disk is “b." The areas are the cross-sectional areas for
the radial conduction. The subscripts on the areas denote the two nodes sharing conduction. For example, A12 is for
conduction between nodes 1 and 2.
A12 ¼ b½2pðDr = 2Þ

For the conduction, A is the cross-sectional area through which the heat ﬂows and L is the distance between nodes. For
convection and radiation, A is the surface area of the particular node.
As we have done previously, we assume that all heat ﬂows into the node we are considering.
Node 1 gets heat by conduction from node 2, convection from the adjacent ﬂuid, and radiation from the surroundings. The

If we multiply the heat ﬂow rates in Equations (5.114) through (5.118) by Dt, we get the heat going into a node during the
time step Dt. This heat input is equal to the increase in the internal energy of the node during the time step. For example, for
node 1, from Eq. (5.114), we have

(a) A Matlab program was written to solve the problem by the forward-difference approach. The program is in
Appendix K. As radiation is present, we needed to use the absolute temperature scale, i.e., Kelvin. The ﬁve nodes
were given the initial temperature of 20 C ¼ 293.15 K. Eqs. (5.124) through (5.128) were arranged successively in a
loop. We picked a time increment Dt of 1 second. As we wanted the nodal temperatures after 4 min ¼ 240 s,
the program performed 240 loops and then output the nodal temperatures. The temperatures after 4 min were
found to be
T1 [ 494.5 K
[
221.4 C T2 [ 503.0 K
[
229.9 C T3 [ 529.0 K
[
255.9 C
T4 [ 573.9 K
[ 300.8 C T5 [ 640.4 K
[
367.3 C
(b) To determine the steady-state temperatures: Instead of only doing 240 loops (4 min), we continued the looping of
Eqs. (5.124) through (5.128) until the temperatures stopped changing with successive loops. The steady-state
temperatures were found to be
T1 [ 711.7 K
[
438.6 C T2 [ 719.9 K
[
446.7 C T3 [ 744.9 K
[
471.7 C
T4 [ 788.5 K
[
515.3 C T5 [ 854.1 K
[
580.9 C
We also determined the steady-state temperatures using Excel Solver. If we set Eqs. (5.114)e(5.118) all equal to zero, we
have the energy equations for steady state. And, the expressions in the equations are the functions for use by Solver. There
was excellent agreement between the Solver and ﬁnite-difference results; only a maximum of 0.4 C difference in
temperatures for all ﬁve nodes.
To close this section, we will use numerical forward-difference to solve two problems that were
previously solved analytically. The ﬁrst problem, Example 5.6, is the same as Example 4.8, which
determined the acceptable burial depth of a water line using semiinﬁnite slab theory.
5.2 Finite-difference method

Example 5.6
Burial depth of a water pipe
Problem
In a town in the Northern United States, the air temperature can be as low as 18 C for as long as 4 weeks. Assume that the
ground is initially at a uniform temperature of 10 C. How deep should water pipes be buried to prevent freezing? Assume
that the combined convective and radiative coefﬁcient at the ground’s surface is an average 30 W/m2 C. The ground has a
thermal conductivity of 2 W/m C, a density of 1800 kg/m3, and a speciﬁc heat of 2100 J/kg C. Fig. 5.22.
Solution
This is a one-dimensional problem. The ﬁrst step is to determine the grid. We decided to make node 1 at the ground
surface. This is a boundary node with convection. We need another boundary at some depth within the ground. This
node, node “n", has to be at a depth sufﬁciently greater than that of the water pipe (More about this later). We decided
to make this node an insulated boundary node. The grid is shown in Fig. 5.23.
Let us now develop the energy equations. Like we have done previously, we will assume that all heat ﬂows into a node.
And, the heat input during time step Dt is equal to the increase in the internal energy of the node during Dt.
We have two boundary nodes (nodes 1 and n) and (n2) interior nodes (nodes 2 through n1). Let us consider a cross-
sectional area A for the heat ﬂow. (This area A eventually cancels out of the equations.) The two boundary nodes have a
thickness of Dx/2. The interior nodes have a thickness of Dx. Therefore, the volume of a boundary node is (A Dx/2), and the
volume of an interior node is (A Dx).
Node 1 has heat input by convection from the adjacent ﬂuid and conduction from node 2. The energy equation is

Water pipes in the northern states of the USA are typically buried at depths of four feet or greater to prevent freezing. We
decided to use a nodal increment Dx of 1 inch ¼ 0.0254 m. As we are solving this problem using forward differences, we
have to make sure that the chosen time step meets the stability criterion. For our problem, the limiting criterion is that the
bracketed expression in Eq. (5.132) may not be negative. That is, for stability,

Putting in the values of the parameters in Eq. (5.135), it is found that Dt must be equal to or less than 441 s. We decided to
make Dt ¼ 5 min ¼ 300 s. From the problem statement, we want nodal temperatures after 4 weeks. This is equivalent to
2.4192  106 s. With a time step of 300 s, we need 2.4192  106 s/300 s ¼ 8064 time steps.

The Matlab program used for the solution is in Appendix K. All nodes were given initial temperatures of 10 C and then we
had 8064 successive loops of Equations (5.132) through (5.134). Each loop updated the nodal temperatures for a time step.
At the end of the 8064 loops, we had the nodal temperatures after 4 weeks. We then had the program determine the ﬁrst
node at which the temperature was above the freezing point of water, 0 C. The location of that node was the required burial
depth.
Finally, as mentioned above, node n has to be sufﬁciently deeper than the water pipe. We ran the program for several
depths, i.e., several different numbers of nodes. We found that if node n was 10 feet or more from the surface, the results
of the program did not change. As we had chosen Dx to be 1 inch, 10 feet is equivalent to 120 Dx. Hence, we used 121
nodes in the program.
It was found that the water pipe had to be buried at a depth of at least 4.75 feet to prevent freezing. This result by numerical
forward differences is in excellent agreement with the 4.84 feet result of Example 4.8, which was solved using the semi-
inﬁnite slab equations.
Our ﬁnal example of numerical solution is the same as Example 4.6, which used the Multidi-
mensional Heisler Method to determine the required cooling time for a short cylinder and the tem-
perature of a point in the cylinder at that time.

shown in Fig. 5.24 is 10 cm in diameter
and 5 cm thick. It goes into an oven where it is heated to a uniform temperature of 1200 C. It is then taken out of the oven
and cooled by convection to a ﬂuid that is at 150 C. The convective coefﬁcient on the curved surface of the disk is 100 W/
m2 C and the convective coefﬁcient on the two ﬂat surfaces is 250 W/m2 C.
(a) How long does it take for the center of the disk to reach 500 C?
(b) At the time obtained in Part (a): What is the temperature at a point located 3 cm from the centerline and 1.5 cm from
one end?
Solution
The nodal labeling is shown in Figs. 5.25 and 5.26. Fig. 5.25 shows the radial numbering, and Fig. 5.26A and B show the
axial numbering. Because of symmetry, there is no need to write nodal equations for axial nodes 7 through 11 of

Fig. 5.26A. The temperature at node 7 is the same as that of node 5; the temperature of node 8 is the same as that of node 4,
etc. Hence, we can use the revised axial grid of Fig. 5.26B and have fewer nodal equations.
Nodal identiﬁcation is by two subscripts (i, j). For example, the temperature Ti;j denotes the node at radial location “i” and
axial location “j.” Nodes on the axis of the cylinder (that is, i ¼ 1) are cylinders of radius Dr/2 with thickness Dx for inte-
rior nodes and Dx/2 for the boundary node (j ¼ 1). The other nodes are rings of width Dr except for the boundary node
(i ¼ 11), which has a width of Dr/2. The ring nodes have a thickness Dx except for the boundary nodes (j ¼ 1), which have
a thickness Dx/2.
From the dimensions of the cylinder and the nodal grid, we have Dr ¼ 0.5 cm ¼ 0.005 m and Dx ¼ 0.5 cm ¼ 0.005 m.
Writing the nodal equations is straightforward but very tedious. There are many nodes, and one must be very careful in the
correct assignment of subscripts and heat ﬂows for a node. We will derive the equations for two nodesdone on the axis of
the cylinder and the other on the side of the cylinder. The other equations are in the Matlab solution, which is in
Appendix K.

Node (1, 4) is an interior node on the axis of the cylinder. It is a cylinder of radius Dr/2 and thickness Dx. The node gets

In the Matlab program, all the nodes are given the initial temperature of 1200 C. The program then loops through these two
equations and the other nodal equations. With each pass through the equations, the time advances another time step.
(a) We used a time step of Dt ¼ 1 s, and it took 376 loops for the center node (node (1,6)) to reach 500 C. So, the center
node reached 500 C in 376 s.
(b) Node (7,4) is the node that is 3 cm from the centerline of the cylinder and 1.5 cm from an end. After 376 s, the
temperature of this node was 470.6 C.
These results are in excellent agreement with the results of the Multidimensional Heisler solution of Example 4.6, which
were 376 s and 471.1 C.
The Matlab program also determines the amount of heat ﬂow into the adjacent ﬂuid during the 376 s of the process. The
result was Q [ 1.108 3 106 J. The Heisler solution for the heat ﬂow was 1.110  106 J. Again, there was excellent agree-
ment between the ﬁnite-difference and Heisler solutions.
5.3 Finite element method
We have discussed the ﬁnite-difference method in detail. There are also other methods in general use
today. These include the ﬁnite element method, the boundary element method, and the control volume
approach.
198
Chapter 5 Numerical methods (steady and unsteady)

In the ﬁnite element method, an object is divided into spatial regions, i.e., ﬁnite elements. Triangles
are commonly used for two-dimensional objects and tetrahedrons for three-dimensional objects. The
elements are typically larger than the nodal volumes for ﬁnite differences, leading to a lesser number of
volumes. And, the ﬁnite element method gives a better approximation of irregularly and complex-
shaped geometries and complicated boundary conditions. However, the ﬁnite element method is
harder to implement than the ﬁnite-difference method. References at the end of this chapter discuss the
ﬁnite element method in detail. There are also many other books available on the subject.
The ﬁnite element method has historically been the predominant method used for structural me-
chanics and stress calculations. Determination of the temperature distribution in an object is a
necessary precursor to determination of thermal stresses. Hence, several companies have developed
ﬁnite element software for determining both temperatures and stresses. Some of these companies
provide low-cost software packages for colleges and students. Major software providers include
ANSYS [11], COMSOL [12], SolidWorks [13], Autodesk [14], and Siemens (formerly, CD-adapco)
[15]. This list is by no means inclusive. There are several other providers, both open source and
commercial, of software applicable to the heat transfer ﬁeld.
5.4 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed the ﬁnite-difference method for solving both steady and unsteady heat
transfer problems. For steady state, we learned how to divide an object into nodal volumes and develop
energy equations for both interior and boundary nodes. We then gave much attention to different ways
of solving these simultaneous equations for the nodal temperatures. For unsteady state, we discussed
the nodal grid and the development of the nodal equations. We discussed the forward-difference
approach in detail and mentioned the stability criteria associated with it. We also outlined the
backward-difference approach that eliminates stability concerns. Finally, we brieﬂy discussed the
ﬁnite element method, which is one alternative to the ﬁnite-difference method.
Several examples were included in the chapter to demonstrate the application of numerical
methods to both steady-state and unsteady-state problems. Some of these examples had previously
been solved using the advanced mathematics of differential equations, semi-inﬁnite slab theory, and
the Heisler Method. It was found that the numerical methods, using only algebra, gave results in
excellent agreement with the results obtained through the higher-level mathematics.
Moving on to the next chapter: Up to now, if a problem involved convection, we provided the value
of the convective coefﬁcient h. This is very unrealistic. For a problem in the “real world”, h will not
normally be a given. One has to either make a good assumption based on experience or determine h
using information from heat transfer researchers. A limited amount of this information comes from
analytical solutions. A major part of the information is in the form of correlations obtained by
experimentation. The next two chapters discuss convection and the determination of convective co-
efﬁcients for various geometries and situations.

Notes:
•
If needed information is not given in the problem statement, then use the Appendix for material
properties and other information. If the Appendix does not have sufﬁcient information, then use
the internet, but double-check the validity of the information by using more than one source.

•
Some problems specify the nodal spacing and time increment (if an unsteady problem). If these
are not given, you should choose the values yourself and clearly note them in your solution.
•
Your solutions should include a sketch of the problem. Node points should be numbered and
clearly indicated on the sketch. Solutions should include the nodal equations and indicate the
method used for solving them.
•
Caution: Make sure that you use absolute temperatures (Kelvin or Rankine) if the problem
involves radiation.

6.1 Introduction
Up to now, the convective coefﬁcient, h, has been a given in all problems involving convective heat
transfer. This is very unrealistic. Indeed, the coefﬁcient is usually not a given. Rather, one has to

determine the coefﬁcient either by making an informed estimate based on previous experience or by
using available analytical or experimental results. The extent of analytical solutions is limited, and
h-values are usually obtained from correlations of experimental data.
There are three major categories of convection: forced convection; natural (or free) convection; and
boiling, condensation, and evaporation. Forced convection is covered in this chapter. Natural con-
vection is in Chapter 7. Evaporation is in Chapter 11, and boiling and condensation are in Chapter 12.
6.2 Basic considerations
Let us consider convective heat transfer between a surface and a ﬂuid. In forced convection, the ﬂuid is
moving over the surface at a signiﬁcant velocity. This velocity is often created by a pump (for liquids)
or a fan or blower (for gases). Other examples of forced convection are wind blowing across the roof or
exterior walls of a building and a liquid ﬂowing by gravity over an inclined plate.
Experimental data for forced convection are correlated through the use of three dimensionless
parameters: the Reynolds number, the Prandtl number, and the Nusselt number. These parameters are
as follows:
Reynolds number ¼ Re ¼ rVL
m
(6.1)
where r ¼ density of the fluid.
V ¼ velocity of the fluid
L ¼ a characteristic length of the geometry. ðFor example; L may be the
length of a plate or the inside diameter of a pipe.Þ
m ¼ absolute viscosity of the fluid
The kinematic viscosity, y, is related to the absolute viscosity by y ¼ m=r. Hence, Eq. (6.1) may be
written as
Reynolds number ¼ Re ¼ VL
y
(6.2)
Prandtl number ¼ Pr ¼ cpm
k
(6.3)
where cp ¼ specific heat at constant pressure of the fluid
m ¼ absolute viscosity of the fluid
k ¼ thermal conductivity of the fluid
Nusselt number ¼ Nu ¼ hL
k
(6.4)
where h ¼ convective coefficient
L ¼ a characteristic length of the geometry
k ¼ thermal conductivity of the fluid
212
Chapter 6 Forced convection

Correlation of experimental data gives the Nusselt number as a function of the two other numbers.
That is
Nu ¼ f ðRe; PrÞ
(6.5)
The functional relationship is often of the form f ¼ C Rea Prb, where C, a, and b are constants.
After the Nusselt number has been determined for a problem, the convective coefﬁcient, h, can be
obtained from the deﬁnition of Nu given in Eq. (6.4).
Fluid motion and velocities for natural (or free) convection are much smaller than those of forced
convection. There typically is no equipment moving the ﬂuid over the surface, and the ﬂuid motion
occurs through density gradients in the ﬂuid created by the temperature difference between the surface
and the ﬂuid. Because velocities are small, the Reynolds number, which has the ﬂuid velocity in it, is
no longer signiﬁcant and relevant. It is replaced by the dimensionless Grashof number, which has the
coefﬁcient of thermal expansion, b, and the acceleration of gravity, g, in its deﬁnition.
Grashof Number ¼ Gr ¼ gbðTs  TNÞL3
y2
(6.6)
where g ¼ acceleration of gravity
b ¼ coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid
L ¼ a characteristic length of the geometry
y ¼ kinematic viscosity of the fluid
Ts and TN are the temperatures of the surface and fluid; respectively
For natural convection, experimental data are correlated using the Grashof, Prandtl, and Nusselt
numbers:
Nu ¼ hL
k ¼ f ðGr; PrÞ
(6.7)
The functional relationship is often of the form f ¼ C ðGr PrÞa, where C and a are constants.
The product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers is the Rayleigh number, Ra.
Like forced convection, once the Nusselt number is determined for a problem, the convective
coefﬁcient, h, is obtained from the deﬁnition of Nu, i.e., from Eq. (6.4).
We will now continue with our discussion of forced convection. We ﬁrst look at ﬂow over ﬂat
plates. Following that, we consider ﬂow over cylinders and spheres and ﬂow through tube banks.
Finally, we look at ﬂow through tubes, pipes, and ducts.
6.3 External ﬂow
This section considers external ﬂow over surfaces. We ﬁrst look at ﬂow over a ﬂat plate; then ﬂow over
cylinders and spheres; and ﬁnally, ﬂow through tube banks.
6.3.1 Flow over a ﬂat plate
Consider two-dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, as shown in Fig. 6.1.
6.3 External ﬂow
213

Flow velocity in the x-direction is u and ﬂow velocity in the y direction is v. There is no ﬂow in the
z-direction. The incoming ﬂow is solely in the x-direction at a velocity uN. This is called the “free-
stream” velocity. The ﬂuid encounters the plate at x ¼ 0, which is called the “leading edge” of the
plate. Flow of the ﬂuid over the plate causes a “boundary layer” to form on the surface of the plate. At
the plate surface (y ¼ 0), the x and y components of the ﬂuid velocity are zero. That is, the ﬂuid sticks
to the plate. Within the boundary layer, the ﬂuid has both u and v components. However, u is much
larger than v. Outside the boundary layer, the ﬂuid is moving in the x-direction at the free-stream
velocity uN.
If the plate is short enough in the direction of ﬂow, there is only a laminar boundary layer region.
Longer plates will have transition and turbulent boundary layer regions. The transitional region is
short, and the ﬂow over a plate is often modeled as a laminar boundary layer immediately followed by
a turbulent boundary layer, as shown in Fig. 6.2.

Chapter 6 Forced convection

The Reynolds number was deﬁned in Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2). For ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, the ﬂow
velocity in the Reynolds number is the free-stream velocity uN and the characteristic length is the
distance x downstream of the leading edge. As shown in Fig. 6.2, the ﬂow changes from laminar to
turbulent at a distance xc downstream of the leading edge. This distance, the “critical distance” is
determined from the critical Reynolds number.
Critical Reynolds number ¼ Rexc ¼ ruNxc
m
(6.8)
The critical Reynolds number varies, depending on the quality of the ﬂow as it passes the leading
edge. If the ﬂow is quiet and very smooth at the leading edge, the Critical Reynolds number is higher
than if the ﬂow is noisy and rough. The value typically used is 5  105. With this value, the critical
distance xc, from Eq. (6.8), is
xc ¼

The thickness of the boundary layer, d, varies with x. It is usually deﬁned as the distance from the
plate at which the x-component of velocity is 99% of the free-stream velocity. That is,
At y ¼ d;
u
uN
¼ 0:99
(6.10)
The boundary layer thickness, d, does not increase as rapidly with downstream distance x as shown
in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2. For example, let us consider air ﬂowing across a plate at a velocity uN ¼ 2 m=s. If
the plate temperature is 100 C and the free-stream air temperature is 20 C, then the boundary layer
thickness at a location 1 m downstream of the leading edge is only 1.5 cm.
6.3.1.1 Laminar boundary layer
In this section, we discuss the ﬂuid mechanics and heat transfer relevant to the laminar boundary layer.
Let us ﬁrst obtain the continuity and momentum equations for an inﬁnitesimal control volume in the
boundary layer. This elemental control volume is shown in Fig. 6.3. Also shown in the ﬁgure are the

in the z-direction. Solution of the continuity and momentum equations will give us the velocity
components uðx; yÞ and vðx; yÞ in the boundary layer.

6.3.1.1.2 Momentum equation
We now look at the momentum in the x-direction. From Newton’s Second Law,
X
Fx ¼ max
(6.14)
where P Fx ¼ sum of forces on the element in the x-direction.
m ¼ mass inside the element ¼ rdxdydz
ax ¼ acceleration of the element in the x-direction ¼ du
dt
Let us look at Fig. 6.3 and consider the forces acting on the ﬂuid element. There are shear forces on
the top and bottom of the element and pressure forces on the left and right faces of the element. The
shear forces are due to the velocity gradient in the y direction, vu/vy, and the ﬂuid viscosity m: The
shear stress in the x-direction in the ﬂuid is s ¼ m vu
vy, and the shear force is the shear stress times
the area it acts on. Because of the ﬂuid motion, the ﬂuid at the bottom of the element is moving faster in
the x-direction than the ﬂuid below the element. Hence, the ﬂuid below the element is exerting a shear
force on the element in the x direction. At the top face of the element, the shear force on the element
is in the þx direction as the ﬂuid above the element is moving faster than the ﬂuid at the top face of the
element.
The pressure forces on the left and right faces of the element act inward to the element. The
pressure on the left face is P and that on the right face is P þ vP

Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19) can be solved simultaneously for the velocity components uðx; yÞ and vðx; yÞ
within the laminar boundary layer. This was ﬁrst done by Blasius [1] in 1908. He changed the two
partial differential equations into the ordinary differential equation
f d2f
dh2 þ 2 d3f
dh3 ¼ 0
(6.20)
This was done by deﬁning a similarity variable h, which is a function of both x and y, and the
streamline function jðx; yÞ: For the streamline function j,
u ¼ vj
vy and v ¼ vj
vx
(6.21)
If we apply Eq. (6.21) to Eq. (6.19), the continuity equation is satisﬁed identically, so we only have
to consider the momentum equation, Eq. (6.18).
The variable hðx; yÞ is deﬁned as

Eq. (6.20) was obtained by applying the deﬁnitions of Eqs. (6.22) and (6.23) to the terms of the

fðhÞ and its ﬁrst two derivatives. The velocity components u and v may be obtained from this table by
using Eq. (6.24). The velocity components are also available from Fig. 6.4: component u from the left
axis and component v from the right axis. Note the straight line on the ﬁgure. This is the tangent line to
the u=uN versus h curve at h ¼ 0. The slope of the line is 0.332, which is consistent with the 0.332

For external ﬂows such as ﬂow over a plate, ﬂuid properties are evaluated at the so-called ﬁlm
temperature, which is the average of the surface temperature Ts and the ﬂuid temperature TN:
Example 6.1
Flow over a ﬂat plate
Problem
Air at 20 C ﬂows at a velocity of 2 m/s across a rectangular ﬂat plate. The plate is 25 cm long in the direction of ﬂow and
5 cm wide. It is at a temperature of 160 C.

the boundary layer?

6.3.1.1.4 Energy equation
Let us now look at the thermal aspects of the laminar boundary layer. As we saw above, the ﬂow of
ﬂuid across a plate creates a hydrodynamic boundary layer. If the plate is at a different temperature
than the ﬂuid, a thermal boundary layer is also created. Let us say that the plate temperature is Ts and
the free-stream ﬂuid temperature is TN: The temperature of the thermal boundary layer at the plate’s
surface is Ts. At the outer surface of the boundary layer, the ﬂuid temperature is essentially at TN:
Being more speciﬁc, the thermal boundary layer thickness is normally deﬁned as the distance from the
plate at which the difference between the ﬂuid temperature Tand the plate temperature Ts is 99% of the
difference between the free-stream ﬂuid temperature TN and the plate temperature Ts:
Fig. 6.5 shows an inﬁnitesimal control volume within the laminar thermal boundary layer.
Let us look at the energy transfers into and out of the control volume. We assume that the ﬂuid is
incompressible and the ﬂow is steady. There is also no internal heat generation in the ﬂuid due to
viscous shearing and no changes in potential and kinetic energies. The ﬂow in the boundary layer is
two-dimensional. There is no ﬂow in the z-direction. Finally, ﬂuid properties are constant.
Energy transfers to and from the control volume are by conduction and ﬂow of enthalpy. Enthalpy
is given the symbol hen to distinguish it from the convective coefﬁcient h.
The energy ﬂows into and out of the control volume are shown in Fig. 6.5. They are

For an incompressible ﬂuid,

And, as there is no internal heat generation and conditions are steady, the energy conservation
equation for the control volume is
(Energy In)left þ (Energy In)bottom ¼ (Energy Out)right þ (Energy Out)top
(6.41)
Using Eqs. (6.36) through (6.40) and the continuity equation, Eq. (6.19), and also neglecting

Let us look at the boundary conditions for Eqs. (6.44) and (6.45). For Eq. (6.44), the boundary
conditions are

•

Summarizing, it is seen that the boundary conditions for Eqs. (6.44) and (6.45) are identical. Hence,
the solutions for q1 in Eq. (6.44) and q2 in Eq. (6.45) will be the same if the kinematic viscosity y of

6.3.1.1.5 Thermal boundary layer thickness

From this equation, if the Prandtl number of the ﬂuid is 1, then the hydrodynamic and thermal
boundary layers are identical. If Pr > 1, then the thermal boundary layer thickness is less than the
hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness at a given location. If Pr < 1, the thermal boundary layer
thickness is greater than the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness at a given location.
Fig. 6.8 shows the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers for laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate.
Considering the relative thicknesses of the layers, the ﬁgure is for a ﬂuid having Pr > 1.
6.3.1.1.6 Convective coefﬁcient and Nusselt number
Let us ﬁrst determine a relation for the convective coefﬁcient at a location x downstream of the leading
edge. This is the local coefﬁcient hx. The coefﬁcient we have previously been using, h, is the average
coefﬁcient for an entire surface.
As mentioned before, the ﬂuid velocity is zero at the plate’s surface, i.e., at y ¼ 0. Hence, heat
transfer from the plate’s surface to the ﬂuid is by conduction. If the area of the plate surface at location
x is dA; then the heat transfer to the ﬂuid from area dA is

To get the average convective coefﬁcient and average Nusselt number for the entire plate,

plate in the direction of ﬂow is L, the average values are

Looking at Eq. (6.53) through (6.56), it is seen that the average values of the convective coefﬁcient
and Nusselt number for the entire plate are twice the local values at the trailing edge, i.e., at x ¼ L:
The above equations for laminar ﬂow on a ﬂat plate are valid for ﬂuids with Prandtl numbers
between about 0.6 and 50. These ﬂuids include common gases (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen,
carbon dioxide) and low viscosity liquids such as water, refrigerants, and propane. The equations are
not valid for high viscosity ﬂuids such as heavy oils and glycerin that have high Pr or for liquid metals
that have low Pr.
Churchill and Ozoe [3] have correlated experimental data to arrive at Eq. (6.57), which is valid for
all Prandtl numbers.

6.3.1.1.7 Reynolds-Colburn analogy
The electric-heat analogy was discussed in Chapter 3. The analogy used electrical circuits to model
heat transfer systems. The circuits were very useful in the visualization of the heat transfer processes
and in the development of equations for solution of heat transfer problems.
In this section, we discuss another very useful analogy. The analogy relates the drag force for
laminar ﬂow over the surface of a ﬂat plate to the convective coefﬁcient for the surface. We will ﬁrst
develop the analogy and then discuss its applications.
The local drag coefﬁcient and local Nusselt number for laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate are given by
Eqs. (6.33) and (6.54):

(6.63)
The right-hand sides of Eqs. (6.61) and (6.63) are the same. Therefore,
StxPr 2=3 ¼ 1
2Cfx
(6.64)
Eq. (6.64) is the Reynolds-Colburn analogy. It relates the local Stanton number to the local drag
coefﬁcient.
Eq. (6.64) may also be written for the average Stanton number and the average drag coefﬁcient:
St Pr 2=3 ¼ 1
2Cf
(6.65)
The convective coefﬁcient is in the deﬁnition of the Stanton number. Hence, Eqs. (6.64) and (6.65)
are relationships between the convective coefﬁcient ðhx or hÞ and the drag coefﬁcient ðCfx or Cf Þ
The Reynolds-Colburn analogy is very useful. Measurement of drag force for laminar ﬂow on a ﬂat
plate can be used to predict the convective coefﬁcient. That is, convective coefﬁcients can be estimated
from mechanical measurements without the performance of heat transfer experiments, which can often
be very complex and time-consuming. Conversely, if the convective heat transfer for the plate is
known, the drag force on the plate can be estimated without the performance of drag force experi-
ments. Example 6.4 illustrates application of the Reynolds-Colburn analogy.

6.3.1.1.8 Constant heat ﬂux
The above discussion is for situations in which the plate has a uniform surface temperature Ts:
However, some situations, e.g., electrically heated plates, have a constant heat ﬂux boundary condition
at the plate’s surface rather than a constant temperature boundary condition.
Let us consider heat ﬂow q to the ﬂuid from an area A on the plate’s surface. The heat ﬂux q/A is
constant over the plate’s surface. Although the heat ﬂux is constant, the convective coefﬁcient h and
the temperature difference Ts  TN vary with the x-location on the plate.
For the convective heat transfer, we have

The material properties in Eqs. (6.69), (6.70), and (6.72) are evaluated at the “ﬁlm” temperature,
which is the average of the free-stream and surface temperatures. However, the surface temperature
varies along the plate and is not known at the beginning of the solution. An iterative procedure must be
used. This procedure is illustrated in Example 6.5.
Example 6.5
Heated plate with uniform heat ﬂux
Problem
Air at 30 C ﬂows at a speed of 2.4 m/s across the top of a thin, square electrically heated plate. The bottom of the plate is
perfectly insulated. The plate is 25 cm on a side and inputs 150 W to the air.
(a) What is the average temperature of the plate?
(b) What is the maximum temperature of the plate?
Solution
Because of the small dimensions of the plate, we will assume that the plate only has a laminar boundary layer. We can
check this assumption after plate temperatures are determined.
As mentioned above, we need an iterative technique to determine the surface temperature of the plate. One technique is as
follows:

ðTsÞavg ¼ 30 þ 1140 y1=2

(6.78)
We can now proceed with the iterative process: guess a value for the average surface temperature ðTsÞavg; determine the
ﬂuid properties at the ﬁlm temperature Tf ¼
ðTsÞavgþTN
2
; and calculate ðTsÞavg using Eq. (6.78) and compare this result with
the guessed surface temperature. If they agree, we have a solution. If not, pick another guess for ðTsÞavg and do the process
again and again until the guessed and calculated values of the surface temperature agree.
Following this procedure, let us pick an initial value for ðTsÞavg of 200 C. Then, Tf ¼ ð200 þ30Þ=2 ¼ 115 C. At 115 C,
k ¼ 0:0320 W
	
m C; y ¼ 2.468  105 m2	
s; and Pr ¼ 0.7082.
Calculating ðTsÞavg using Eq. (6.78) gives ðTsÞavg ¼ 228.6 C, which does not agree with our guess of 200C. Picking 230 C
as our new guess, we have Tf ¼ ð230 þ30Þ=2 ¼ 130 C.
At
130 C, k ¼ 0:03305 W
	
m C; y ¼ 2.633  105 m2	
s; and Pr ¼ 0.7057. And, using Eq. (6.78),
we get
ðTsÞavg ¼ 228.8 C, which agrees closely with our guess of 230 C. Iterating a ﬁnal time with 229 C, we have agreement
between our guess and the calculated value.
So, the solution to Part (a) is: The average surface temperature of the plate is 229 C.
From Eqs. (6.68) and (6.70), it can be seen that the maximum surface temperature is at the trailing edge x ¼ L: From Eq.
(6.70), we have

hL

So, the solution to Part (b) is: The maximum surface temperature of the plate is 328 C.
At the beginning, we assumed that the plate had only a laminar boundary layer. Let us check this by calculating the Rey-
nolds number at x ¼ L:
ReL ¼ uNL
y
¼
ð2:4Þð0:25Þ
2:6275  105 ¼ 2:284  104
As ReL < 5  105; the boundary layer is laminar at x ¼ L and the plate only has a laminar boundary layer on it.
6.3.1.1.9 Unheated starting length
The above sections considered laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate where the entire plate was at a uniform
surface temperature Ts: Let us now consider ﬂow over a plate where the plate is insulated or unheated
for a portion of the plate immediately downstream of the leading edge. This is shown in Fig. 6.9.
The plate is unheated or insulated for 0  x  xo: For this portion, the plate surface is at the free-
stream temperature TN: For x > xo; the plate surface is at uniform temperature Ts: The hydrodynamic
boundary layer starts at the leading edge, but the thermal boundary layer starts at x ¼ xo: The boundary
layers are laminar over the entire plate.

outside this range.
6.3.1.2 Turbulent boundary layer
If a plate is long enough, there will generally be a laminar boundary layer followed by a turbulent
boundary layer. If the laminar boundary layer portion is small or if the ﬂow upstream of the plate is
rough and agitated, then it is often reasonable to assume that the plate has a turbulent boundary layer
on its entire length. This section presents equations for plates having a turbulent boundary layer
region.
Eqs. (6.33) and (6.34) gave equations for the local friction coefﬁcientCfx and average drag coef-
ﬁcient Cf for a laminar boundary layer. If the ﬂow is turbulent over the entire plate, the corresponding

The critical length xc is the distance from the leading edge of the plate where the ﬂow changes from
laminar to turbulent. This is taken to be where the Reynolds number is 5  105.
When the integrations of Eqs. (6.89) and (6.90) are performed using the Cfx relations of Eqs. (6.33)
and (6.85) and the hx relations of Eqs. (6.53) and (6.86), it is found that the average coefﬁcients for a

As a ﬁnal topic in the category of ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, let us look at how the local convective
coefﬁcient hx changes with distance x from the leading edge. It will be seen that hx increases
signiﬁcantly as the ﬂow changes from laminar to turbulent.
Example 6.7
Variation of local convective coefﬁcient with location
Problem
Air at 30 C ﬂows across a ﬂat plate at a velocity of 8 m/s. The plate is at a uniform temperature of 90 C and is 2.5 m long in
the direction of air ﬂow. Determine how the local convective coefﬁcient hx varies with distance x, the downstream distance
from the leading edge. Plot hx versus x from the leading edge (x ¼ 0) to the downstream end of the plate (x ¼ L ¼ 2.5 m).
Solution
Let us ﬁrst calculate the Reynolds number at x ¼ L and conﬁrm that the plate has both laminar and turbulent boundary
layers.
Properties of air at the ﬁlm temperature of (90 þ 30)/2 ¼ 60 C are, from Appendix D:
k ¼ 0.0281 W=m C; y ¼ 18:97  106 m2=s; Pr ¼ 0.72.
The Reynolds number at x ¼ L ¼ 2.5 m is ReL ¼ uNL
y
¼
ð8Þð2:5Þ
18:97106 ¼ 1:054  106. As this is greater than the value of the
critical Reynolds number (5  105), the ﬂow at the downstream end of the plate is turbulent, and there are both laminar and
turbulent regions on the plate.
The ﬂow changes from laminar to turbulent at the critical distance xc where the Reynolds number is 5  105. From the
deﬁnition of the Reynolds number, we have
Rexc ¼ uNxc
y
¼
8xc
18:97  106 ¼ 5  105; and xc ¼ 1:19 m
From x ¼ 0 to x ¼ 1.19 m, the ﬂow is laminar. From x ¼ 1.19 m to x ¼ 2.5 m, the ﬂow is turbulent.
In the laminar region, the local convective coefﬁcient is given by Eq. (6.54):
hx ¼ 0:332Re1=2
x
Pr1=3ðk = xÞ
(6.54)
When values of the various parameters are put into this equation, we have
hx ¼ 5:430x0:5 
W = m2 C

(6.93)
In the turbulent region, the local convective coefﬁcient is given by Eq. (6.86):
hx ¼ 0:0296Re0:8

(6.86)

When values of the various parameters are put into this equation, we have

turbulent region.

(W/m2C)
In the laminar region from x ¼ 0 to x ¼ 1.19 m, it is seen that hx decreases from a very large value near the leading edge
(x ¼ 0) to a value of about 5 at the end of the laminar region. Then,hxhas a jump to about 22.5 at the transition location
between laminar and turbulent. As x continues to increase, hx gradually decreases to a value of about 20 at the end of the
plate. It is seen that the rate of hx decrease in the laminar region is higher than that in the turbulent region. This is because,
from Eqs. (6.93) and (6.94), hx is proportional to x0:5 in the laminar region and proportional to x0:2 in the turbulent
region.
(Note: The ﬁgure shows an abrupt jump in hx where the ﬂow changes from laminar to turbulent. In reality, there will be a
transitional region between the laminar and turbulent regions and the change in hx, although still very signiﬁcant, will not
be as abrupt.)

Example 6.8
Flow over a square exhaust duct
Problem
A worker in a factory is cold. There is a sheet metal exhaust duct carrying hot air near his station, and he thinks he can get
some warmth from the duct by directing a fan over its hot surface. Using an infrared thermometer, he ﬁnds that the tem-
perature of the outer surface of the duct is 120 F. The room air is at 55 F. The duct has a square cross section 10 inches by
10 inches. Air from the fan moves at 8 ft/s.
(a) To get the greatest heating from the duct, should the fan be directed on a ﬂat side of the duct or on a corner of the
duct? (See Fig. 6.12 below)
(b) What is the expected convective heat ﬂow from the duct surface to the room air per foot length of duct? Will this
have a signiﬁcant impact on the person’s comfort?
(c) Estimate the duct’s radiative heat ﬂow to the room and compare it with the convective heat ﬂow you found in
Part (B).

Conclusion: As Orientation (A) gives a larger convective coefﬁcient, the air heating will be larger for that orientation.

qconv ¼ hADT ¼ ð2:67Þð3:333Þð120  55Þ ¼ 578 Btu=h per foot length of duct
If there is, say, about 10 feet of duct near the person, then about 5800 Btu/h will be added to the air near the person. This
should result in a positive impact on the person’s comfort but perhaps not a signiﬁcant impact.
(c) We estimate that the sheet metal duct has an emissivity of about 0.3.

The radiative heat transfer is small compared with the convective heat transfer. (Note: Painting the duct black would
increase the emissivity to about 0.9, which would triple the radiative heat transfer.)
6.3.2.2 Spheres
Many experimental studies have been performed to determine convective coefﬁcients for spheres in
crossﬂow. Although most of these studies are for heat transfer in air or water, there have been some
studies for other ﬂuids, such as oils. We mention a few forced convection correlations for spheres.
There are many more in the literature.

6.3.3 Flow through tube banks
Heat exchangers are used to transfer heat between two ﬂuids. The exchangers often have many parallel
tubes arranged in a bundle or “tube bank” One ﬂuid ﬂows through the tubes and the other ﬂuid ﬂows
through the tube bank, i.e., across the outer surfaces of the tubes. Convective coefﬁcients for ﬂow over
a single cylinder (or tube) were discussed in Section 6.3.2.1. Flow over a tube in a tube bank is more
complicated due to the impact on the ﬂow by adjacent tubes in the tube bank. Such altering of the ﬂow
has a signiﬁcant effect on the convective coefﬁcient for the tube in question. This section discusses the
convective coefﬁcient for the outer surface of a tube in a tube bank. Section 6.4 covers the convective
coefﬁcient for the inner surface of the tube.
Two common arrangements of tubes in a tube bank are “inline” and “staggered” as shown in
Fig. 6.13. The tube spacing in the ﬂow direction is SL and the spacing in the transverse direction is ST.
A diagonal spacing SD is also shown for the staggered arrangement. In terms of SL and ST;

Many researchers have determined correlations for the Nusselt number for ﬂow through a tube
bank. These correlations contain the Reynolds number, which is based on the maximum ﬂuid velocity
in the tube bank, and the outside diameter of the tubes. That is,
ReD ¼ rVmaxD
m
¼ VmaxD
y
(6.113)
where D is the outside diameter of the tube.
Let us look at the maximum velocity for the two arrangements: For both arrangements, ﬂuid enters
the tube bank from the left at uniform velocity Vin and inlet temperature Tin: As the ﬂuid passes the ﬁrst
row of tubes, it speeds up due to the narrowing of the ﬂow area. From continuity, the velocity as it goes
through the opening between two tubes in the ﬁrst row is
ST
STDVin: For the inline arrangement, this is
the maximum velocity in the tube bank. It is also the maximum velocity for the staggered arrangement
unless the spacing of the rows is small. Looking at the geometry and mass ﬂow conservation, it can be
shown that if SD < STþD
2 ; then the maximum velocity is through the diagonal passage of width SD D:

and there are 16 or more rows, then F is 1. For less than 16 rows, F is less than 1. For 13, 10, 7, 5, and 4
rows, it was found that F is, respectively, 0.99, 0.98, 0.96, 0.93, and 0.9. This data can be interpolated

Flow through a tube bank
Problem
An inline tube bank consists of 30 tubes. There are ﬁve rows of tubes in the ﬂow direction and six rows in the transverse
direction. The tube spacing is shown in Fig. 6.14. The tubes are 1/2-inch Type M copper tubes, 0.5 m long. Air enters the
tube bank at a velocity of 3 m/s and a temperature of 20 C. The outer surfaces of the tubes are at 110 C. What is the rate of
heat transfer by forced convection to the air?

From an Internet search, the tubes have an outside diameter of 0.625 inch ¼ 0.01588 m.

The Reynolds number is based on the maximum velocity and the outside diameter of the tubes. Fluid properties are to be

Solving this for the convective coefﬁcient, we get h ¼ 103.0 W/m2 C.
The heat transfer to the air is q ¼ hNtubesAtubeðTs TNÞ;
where Ntubes is the number of tubes; Atube is the surface area
per tube and TN is the average ﬂuid temperature. We assumed TN was 30 C.
So, we have q ¼ ð103:0Þð30Þ½pð0:01588Þð0:5Þð110 30Þ ¼ 6166 W.
The rate of heat transfer by forced convection to the air is 6166 W.
We assumed that the exit temperature of the air from the tube bank was 40 C. This gave us an average air temperature
of 30 C for determination of the ﬂuid properties. Now that we have the heat transfer amount, we can check whether
our assumption of 40 C exit temperature was appropriate. The heat gain of the air is q ¼ ðrinVinAinÞcpðTout TinÞ.
The ﬁrst parenthesis is the mass ﬂow rate of the incoming air. Then we have the speciﬁc heat, and ﬁnally the change
of temperature of the air as it goes through the tube bank. Putting values into this equation and using the calculated
6166 W for q, we get
q ¼ 6166 ¼ ð1:172Þð3Þ½ð6Þð0:02588Þð0:5Þð1007ÞðTout  20Þ
Solving for Tout, we get Tout ¼ 42:4 C. This gives an average air temperature of (20 þ 42.4)/2 ¼ 31.2 C. Our assumption
was very close, 30 C, and there is no need for iteration on the exit temperature and ﬂuid properties to get a better value for
q. Our calculated value is ﬁne.

6.4 Internal ﬂow
The previous section dealt with ﬂow over objects. For example, we looked at ﬂow over a cylinder and
discussed correlations for the convective coefﬁcient at the outer surface of the cylinder. This section
deals with ﬂow through cylinders, i.e., pipes and tubes, and ducts. We will discuss correlations for the
convective coefﬁcient at the inner surface of the cylinders and ducts.
Consider Fig. 6.15, which shows a ﬂuid ﬂowing through a circular tube.
The ﬂuid enters the tube with a uniform velocity Vin. As the ﬂuid goes through the tube, it is acted
on by shear stresses at the wall which impact the velocity proﬁle uðx; rÞ: The ﬂuid sticks to the wall
(zero velocity) and a boundary layer forms. If the ﬂow is laminar and the tube is long enough, the
velocity proﬁle ultimately becomes parabolic. At this point, the ﬂow is said to be “fully developed
hydrodynamically” and the velocity proﬁle stays the same as the ﬂuid progresses further down the
tube. If the ﬂow is turbulent, rather than laminar, the ultimate velocity proﬁle is not parabolic. Rather, it
is ﬂatter near the center of the tube, as shown in Fig. 6.16. The distance from the inlet to the fully
developed region is Lh; called the “hydrodynamic entrance length” For x > Lh; vu
vx ¼ 0:
We have used the terms “laminar” and “turbulent” In laminar ﬂow, ﬂuid particles glide through the
tube. There is little cross mixing of the particles. They tend to stay in the same relative layer as they
travel down the tube. In turbulent ﬂow, the ﬂow is rougher, with cross mixing of ﬂuid particles. There
are random variations of velocity and other ﬂuid properties such as pressure and temperature. Whether

Chapter 6 Forced convection

a ﬂow is laminar or turbulent depends a lot on the ﬂuid velocity and viscosity. Indeed, the Reynolds
number is used to determine whether the ﬂow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number for in-
ternal ﬂow is
ReD ¼ rVD
m
¼ VD
y
(6.118)
where D is the inside diameter of the tube.
V is the ﬂow velocity
r; m; and y are the fluid density; absolute viscosity; and kinematic viscosity
From experiments, ﬂow is usually laminar if ReD < 2300 and turbulent if ReD > 4000: (These
are rough, not ﬁrm, values.) Between these values, the ﬂow is “transitional.”
Looking at the deﬁnition of the Reynolds number, it is seen that laminar ﬂow generally occurs for
ﬂuids of high viscosity ﬂowing at low velocity. Most ﬂows encountered in engineering practice are of
the turbulent category.
If we consider the thermal aspects of the ﬂow, there is a thermal entrance length Lt analogous to the
hydrodynamic entrance length Lh discussed above. For thermally fully developed ﬂow, i.e., for x >
Lt; v

6.4.1 Entrance lengths
Experimentation has provided the following estimates of entrance lengths Lh and Lt:
For laminar flows; Lh z 0:05ReDD
(6.119)
Lt z 0:05ReDDPr
(6.120)
For turbulent ﬂows, the entrance lengths Lh and Lt are about the same and they are essentially
independent of Prandtl number Pr. It is often assumed that turbulent ﬂows are fully developed, both
hydrodynamically and thermally, about 10 diameters downstream of the entrance.
6.4.2 Mean velocity and mean temperature
The mass ﬂow rate of the ﬂuid is _m ¼ rAcVavg, where Ac is the cross-sectional area of the ﬂow and
Vavg is the average ﬂow velocity at a given location x. The ﬂuid velocity varies over the cross section,
and the average (or mean) velocity is obtained by integrating the velocity over the cross section:
Vavg ¼ 1

6.4 Internal ﬂow
247

Later in this chapter, we will be providing correlation equations for the convective coefﬁcient for
internal ﬂows. These equations often depend on the boundary conditions at the wall surface. The two
common boundary conditions are constant heat ﬂux and constant temperature, which we consider now.
6.4.3 Constant heat ﬂux
Fig. 6.17 shows a differential control volume in a ﬂuid ﬂowing through a channel. There is a constant
heat ﬂux on the surface of the channel. Such a constant heat ﬂux could have been applied by heating
tapes wrapped around the tube or perhaps a radiant heat source beaming on the outer surface of the
tube. We will do an energy balance on the control volume.
The heat ﬂux q0
s is constant, and the rate of heat ﬂow into the control volume is q0
sdAs, where dAs is
the differential area at the surface of the tube. The heat ﬂow into the volume raises the energy of the
ﬂuid in the volume a net amount _mcpdTm: The energy balance is
Net rate of heat in ¼ net rate of energy increase of ﬂuid.
dqs ¼ q0
sdAs ¼ _mcpðTm þ dTmÞ  _mcpTm

The differential surface area dAs is the perimeter P times dx. Eq. (6.123) then becomes:

6.4.4 Constant surface temperature
Fig. 6.18 shows a differential control volume in a ﬂuid ﬂowing through a channel. The channel has a
constant surface temperature. Perhaps such a constant surface temperature occurred from a ﬂuid
condensing or vaporizing on the outer surface of the tube. We will do an energy balance on the control
volume.
The surface temperature is Ts. The center of the volume is at location x þ dx=2. At this location,
the mean ﬂuid temperature is Tm þ dTm=2: The rate of convective heat ﬂow into the control volume is
dqs ¼ hdAs½Ts ðTm þdTm =2Þ, where h is the average convective coefﬁcient for the tube section
being considered. Area dAs is the differential area at the surface of the tube. The heat ﬂow into the
volume raises the energy of the ﬂuid in the volume a net amount _mcpdTm: The energy balance is
Net Rate of Heat in ¼ Net Rate of Energy Increase of Fluid
dqs ¼ hdAs½Ts  ðTm þ dTm = 2Þ ¼ _mcpðTm þ dTmÞ  _mcpTm
(6.126)
The differential surface area dAs is the perimeter P times dx. And, we can eliminate the second-
order term dx dTm: Eq. (6.126) then becomes
dqs ¼ hPdxðTs  TmÞ ¼ _mcpdTm

6.4.5 Equivalent diameter for ﬂow through noncircular tubes
Many parameters, including the Reynolds number, Nusselt number, and friction factor, contain the
inside diameter D of the tube. If the tube has a noncircular area, then an equivalent diameter, the
hydraulic diameter, should be used for the inside diameter. This diameter is deﬁned by
Dh ¼ 4Ac
P
(6.132)
where Ac is the ﬂow area and P is the wetted perimeter, i.e., the perimeter of the surface seeing ﬂuid.
Some examples are the following:
If the ﬂow area is circular with diameter D, then the hydraulic diameter is the same as the actual
diameter D of the tube. That is, Dh ¼ 4ðpD2=4Þ
pD
¼ D.
If the ﬂow area is square, with a side a, then Dh ¼ 4a2

6.4.6 Correlations for the Nusselt number and convective coefﬁcient
Internal ﬂow has been extensively investigated and there are many correlations for the Nusselt number
and convective coefﬁcient. We will present some of them here. The correlations are grouped according
to type of ﬂowdlaminar or turbulent.

6.4.6.2 Laminar ﬂow; fully developed
Nusselt numbers for circular and noncircular cylinders are given in Table 6.4. There are entries for two
boundary conditions: constant heat ﬂux and constant surface temperature.
6.4.6.3 Turbulent ﬂow; fully developed
In turbulent ﬂow, the ﬂow is usually fully developed within 10 or 20 diameters downstream of the
entrance. As the entrance region is so short, we will only include correlation equations for the fully
developed portion of the tube and will use these equations also for the entrance region as needed. In
addition, the type of boundary condition (e.g., constant ﬂux or constant temperature) has less impact on
the convective coefﬁcients for turbulent ﬂow than for laminar ﬂow. Therefore, the following equations
may be used for either boundary condition.

It is seen that Eq. (6.138) is not explicit for the friction factor f. It is on both sides of the equation.
The equation can be solved for f by manual trial-and-error or by using equation solving software. For
example, it can be solved using Goal Seek or Solver of Excel or using the fzero function of Matlab.
Example 6.10
Flow through a circular tube
Problem
We want to cool engine oil from 100 to 80 C. To do this, we plan to pass the oil through a tube whose surface is at a uniform
temperature of 40 C. The oil ﬂows through the tube at a velocity of 0.03 m/s, and the tube has an inside diameter of 2 cm.
How long does the tube have to be to achieve the desired cooling of the oil?
Solution
The mean bulk temperature of the oil is (100 þ 80)/2 ¼ 90 C. Properties of engine oil at 90 C are

Let us check if the ﬂow is fully developed: From Eqs. (6.119) and (6.120),
Lh z 0:05ReDD ¼ 0:05ð21:35Þð0:02Þ ¼ 0:021 m
Lt z 0:05ReDD Pr ¼ 0:021ð360Þ ¼ 7:6 m
The ﬂow is fully hydrodynamically developed, but probably thermally developing.
Hence, we cannot say that the ﬂow is fully developed, and we should use either Eq. (6.133) or (6.134) for the Nusselt
number. We will use Eq. (6.133):
NuD ¼ hD

There are two unknowns in this equation, h and L. We need a second equation with h and L. As the temperature of the tube
surface is uniform, we can use the energy equation for constant surface temperature, Eq. (6.130):

Flow through a noncircular tube
Problem
Water at 20 C having a ﬂow rate of 5 kg/s enters a tube of rectangular cross section. The tube cross section is 3 cm by 6 cm,
and it is 15 m long. The inner surface of the tube is maintained at a constant temperature of 75 C. What is the temperature
of the water leaving the tube?

As the tube is noncircular, we need the hydraulic diameter. For a rectangular tube with sides of a and b, the hydraulic

We need the ﬂow velocity to get the Reynolds number. The mass ﬂow rate is _m ¼ rVA, where A is the ﬂow area. The ﬂow

To get the exit temperature, we can use Eq. (6.131):
ðTs  TmÞx2 ¼ ðTs  TmÞx1e hP

Putting in the values, we have

ð5Þð4182Þ
ð15Þ ¼ 19:2 C
The exit temperature is Tm at x2; which is 75e19.2 ¼ 55.8 C.
The ﬂuid properties should be taken at the ﬂuid mean bulk temperature. We took properties at 20 C, but with this result, we
have a mean bulk temperature of (20 þ 55.8)/2 ¼ 37.9 C. We should do the problem again with water properties at a
higher temperature.
We did the problem again with properties at 40 C. We got a convective coefﬁcient of 9970 W/m2 C and an exit temperature
of 59.8 C. With this exit temperature, the mean bulk temperature is (20 þ 59.8)/2 ¼ 39.9 C. Properties were taken at 40 C
so no further iteration is needed. In short, the Dittus-Boelter equation predicts that the exit temperature of the water
is about 60 C.
Let us look at this problem a little more. We used the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is the simplest of the three equations
given for turbulent ﬂow. However, the temperature difference between the tube surface and the ﬂuid is considerable. The
tube surface is at 75 C and the mean bulk water temperature is 40 C. And, some properties of water vary signiﬁcantly with
temperature, e.g., the Prandtl number and the viscosity. It might be interesting to see the result from the Sieder-Tate
equation, which has a viscosity term to adjust for the difference between the surface and ﬂuid temperatures.
We did the problem using the Sieder-Tate equation, Eq. (6.136), and got h ¼ 11,460 W/m2 C, which is 15% higher than the
9970 W/m2 C value from Dittus-Boelter when we used properties at 40 C. With the Seider-Tate equation, the water exit
temperature was 62.5 C.
We also did the problem using the Gnielinski equation, Eq. (6.137). This equation has the friction factor f. We assumed that
the tube had a fairly smooth surface equivalent to drawn tubing and solved for the friction factor using the Colebrook
254
Chapter 6 Forced convection

Equation, Eq. (6.138). Using the Excel’s Goal Seek we found that the friction factor was 0.0164. Using this in the Gnie-
linski equation, we got a convective coefﬁcient of 13,200 W/m2 C and a water exit temperature of 65.0 C.
In short, the Dittus-Boelter equation gave a water exit temperature of about 60 C while the Sieder-Tate and Gnielinski
equations gave the exit temperature as about 64 C. Because of the temperature-dependent nature of the properties of
water, we will make an engineering judgment that the Sieder-Tate and Gnielinski equations are more accurate than the
Dittus-Boelter equation for this problem. We conclude that the exit temperature of the water is about 64 C.
6.4.7 Annular ﬂow
We have discussed the equivalent diameter to use in correlation equations for ﬂows through noncir-
cular tubes. Flow through an annulus is a bit different as there may be two surfaces with heat transfer
instead of one. Fig. 6.19 shows an annular ﬂow area created by two concentric tubes. The area has an
inside diameter D1, which is the outside diameter of the inner tube, and an outside diameter D2, which
is the inside diameter of the outer tube.
In a double-pipe heat exchanger, one ﬂuid ﬂows through the inner tube and the other ﬂows through
the annular area. The ﬂuids have different temperatures, and heat is transferred from one ﬂuid to the
other through the tube wall of the inner tube. The hydraulic diameter for the annular ﬂow area is the
difference in the diameters, i.e., D2  D1:

6.4.7.2 Fully developed turbulent ﬂow
For fully developed turbulent ﬂow in an annulus, the convective coefﬁcients at the two surfaces of the
annulus are of the same magnitude. The above equations for turbulent ﬂow in circular tubes may be
applied with the hydraulic diameter of Eq. (6.146) used as the tube’s diameter.
We conclude this chapter with an example that includes both internal and external convection.
Example 6.12
Heating of a warehouse
Problem
It is winter and workers in an unheated warehouse are cold and angry. They are freezing, and the people in the adjacent
ofﬁce are warm and comfy. There is a duct going through the warehouse which carries hot air to the ofﬁce for heating. The
warehouse workers have asked the management to provide diffusers in the duct to supply some hot air to the warehouse,
but their request has been denied. The workers have decided to take matters into their own hands. They have decided to use
fans to blow the warehouse air over the hot air duct and get some heating from the forced convection. The details are as
follows:
The duct is 10 inches diameter and the section in the warehouse is 50 feet long. The air enters the warehouse section at a
rate of 1100 cfm and a temperature of 130 F. The air in the warehouse space is at 45 F. Fans will blow the air in crossﬂow
over the duct at a velocity of 8 m/s.
(a) What is the temperature of the air in the duct as it leaves the warehouse?
(b) How much heating will be added to the warehouse air (Btu/hr)?
(c) What are some practical problems with this proposed heating of the warehouse?
Solution
We will assume that the duct wall is thin and a constant temperature surface. To get air property values, we need to make
some assumptions on temperatures. We will check these assumptions after the calculations and iterate as necessary. We
will assume that the air temperature drops by 20 F from the entrance to the exit. The air enters at 130 F (54.44 C) and
leaves at 110 F (43.33 C). The average temperature of the air in the duct is then (54.44 þ 43.33)/2 ¼ 48.89 C.
We will also assume that the temperature of the duct wall is Ts ¼ 85 F ¼ 29.44 C.
We now proceed to get the convective coefﬁcients hi and ho for the inside and outside surfaces of the duct.

Summarizing. We assumed the duct wall temperature was 85 F and we calculated it as 83.5 F.
We assumed the exit temperature of the duct air was 110 F and we calculated it as 108.7 F.
Our assumptions were close to the calculated values. We conclude that iteration is not necessary as it would have negli-
gible impact on the results.

Results
(a) Duct air exits at 109 F.
(b) Heating added to the warehouse is about 22,700 Btu/hr.
(c) Practical problems include the following:
The large number of fans needed. (This is not a problem if the facility is a fan factory.)
Mounting of the fans is a major installation task.
The noise due to the fans will be considerable.
There will be considerable increased electrical load for the fans.
The obtained warehouse heating is not very large considering the major installation requirements and costs. We calculated
that the use of the fans added 22,700 Btu/hr to the warehouse air. Actually, the impact of the fans is even less than this.
Without the fans, there would be natural convection from the hot duct. Example 7.4 estimates this natural convection as
5930 Btu/hr. Hence, the fans will actually only add 22,700  5930 ¼ 16,770 Btu/hr to the air. With such a low value, it is
probably better to continue lobbying the management for diffusers in the hot air duct. Or, perhaps install gas-ﬁred infrared
heaters near the ceiling or unit heaters near the work stations in the warehouse.
6.5 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we ﬁrst discussed the dimensionless parameters relevant to forced and natural
convection: the Reynolds, Prandtl, and Nusselt numbers for forced convection and the Grashof,
Prandtl, and Nusselt numbers for natural convection. We then proceeded to discuss forced con-
vection for both external and internal ﬂows. For external ﬂows, we looked at the laminar and tur-
bulent boundary layers on a ﬂat plate and outlined the analytical solution of the ﬂow and thermal
equations for the laminar boundary layer. Besides the ﬂat plate, we covered ﬂows over cylinders and
spheres. We also discussed ﬂow through the tube banks of heat exchangers. For internal ﬂows, we
looked at ﬂow through tubes and ducts. Correlation equations were presented for the different types
of ﬂows and different geometries. These equations, based on experimental studies, provide estimates
for the convective coefﬁcient h. Many of the equations have ranges of applicability for the Reynolds
and Prandtl numbers. If a problem has parameters outside of the applicable ranges, then one should
use the equation that most closely ﬁts the problem.
Of course, the best possible way to determine the h-value for an object is to perform an experiment
on the actual object. This is usually not possible from an economic and/or practical basis, and cor-
relation equations have to be used. One should keep in mind that the correlations are from carefully
controlled lab experiments having conditions often quite different from those encountered in practice.
Therefore, the h-value from a correlation equation may differ signiﬁcantly from the actual h of an
object, perhaps as much as 25% or more. (An aside to students who like to present answers with an
extreme number of digits: Considering the uncertainty in the h-value, is this practice really
appropriate?)
We continue now to Chapter 7, which discusses natural convection.

the data very well. Using the data in the section, determine a third degree polynomial ﬁt for the
data. Compare the values of F obtained from this third degree polynomial for rows 3 through
16 with those obtained from the fourth degree polynomial.
6-48 Example 6.7 showed how the local convective coefﬁcient varied for ﬂow across a ﬂat plate. We
wish to investigate how the local drag coefﬁcient Cfx varies with downstream distance x from
the leading edge. Nitrogen at 50 C ﬂows across a ﬂat plate at a velocity of 12 m/s. The plate is
at a uniform temperature of 100 C and is 5 m long in the direction of nitrogen ﬂow. Plot Cfx
versus x from the leading edge (x ¼ 0) to the downstream end of the plate (x ¼ L ¼ 5 m).

8.1 Introduction
Heat exchangers are devices used to transfer thermal energy between two ﬂuids. As the ﬂuids ﬂow
through an exchanger, one ﬂuid gains heat and the other loses heat. If the process does not include
evaporation or condensation, both ﬂuids will experience a change in temperaturedone ﬂuid increasing
in temperature and the other decreasing in temperature. Heat exchangers have a myriad of applica-
tions. In power plants, they serve as steam condensers, feedwater heaters, steam generators, and
preheaters. Heat exchangers see extensive use in chemical process applications. In addition, they are
extensively used in the HVAC industry, where they are boilers, condensers, evaporators, heaters, air
conditioners, radiators, and heating/cooling coils.
8.2 Types of heat exchangers
There are three main types of heat exchangers: direct contact, regenerator, and recuperator.
In a direct contact exchanger, the two inlet ﬂuid streams combine and mix together. Examples of
direct contact exchangers are cooling towers, open feedwater heaters in power plants, and chemical
processes where ﬂuids can be mixed together. There is no wall separating the ﬂuids to corrode and foul

and degrade the heat exchanger performance. In addition, the pressure drop of the exchanger is less
than that of exchangers incorporating tubes. Finally, the direct contact exchanger can be considerably
more economical than other types of exchangers. One major disadvantage, however, is that the ﬂuids
mix together. In many applications, contamination of a ﬂuid by the other ﬂuid is highly undesirable.
For example, one ﬂuid may be radioactive; the other nonradioactive. Or, one may be poisonous; the
other nonpoisonous. In these examples, direct contact exchangers are deﬁnitely unsuitable.
In a regenerator, heat is transferred to a storage medium, the “core” or “matrix” of the exchanger,
by the hotter ﬂuid, and then the cooler ﬂuid gains heat from the storage medium. It is a periodic
process, with the two ﬂuids alternating in contact with the core. Regenerators are of the ﬁxed-matrix or
rotary types. Regenerators have a high surface area per volume, and the high surface area makes the
exchanger particularly attractive for gas-to-gas applications. A disadvantage is that there can be minor
mixing of the ﬂuid streams.
In recuperators, the two ﬂuids are separated by a wall. The ﬂuids transfer heat by convection to and
from the wall and conduction through the wall. The major advantage of a recuperator is that the two
ﬂuids are indeed separated, with no cross-contamination if the wall maintains its integrity. Disad-
vantages include the higher capital cost of recuperators and the increased pressure drop, which results
in higher pumping costs.
Our discussion in this chapter is limited to recuperators. In particular, we will discuss double-pipe,
shell-and-tube, and crossﬂow heat exchangers.
The simplest type of recuperator is the double-pipe heat exchanger shown in Fig. 8.1A. It consists
of two concentric tubes. One ﬂuid ﬂows in the inner tube and the other ﬂuid ﬂows in the annular area
between the inner and outer tubes. If the ﬂuids ﬂow in the same direction, as they do in Fig. 8.1A, then
the ﬂow is said to be parallel ﬂow. If the ﬂuids ﬂow in opposite directions, the ﬂow is counterﬂow. Each
ﬂuid makes a single pass through the exchanger; they only go through the exchanger once.
In a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, one ﬂuid ﬂows through the tubes, and the other ﬂuid ﬂows
around the tubes, enclosed by the “shell” of the exchanger. Fig. 8.1B shows an exchanger with one
shell pass and two tube passes. Exchangers can also have more than two tube passes and more than one
shell pass. For example, Fig. 8.1C shows a two-shell pass, four-tube-pass exchanger. Bafﬂes are placed
in shell-and-tube heat exchangers to channel the ﬂow of the shell ﬂuid across the tubes. The bafﬂes
enhance contact of the shell ﬂuid with the tubes. They minimize bypassing of tubes by the shell ﬂuid.
In crossﬂow heat exchangers, one ﬂuid ﬂows through the tubes and the other ﬂuid ﬂows crosswise
to the tubes. The crossﬂow increases the heat transfer relative to ﬂows that are longitudinal along the
tubes, such as in the double-pipe exchanger. Fig. 8.1D shows two crossﬂow heat exchangers. In one
exchanger, a ﬂuid ﬂows through the tubes and the other ﬂuid ﬂows unrestrained over the tubes. It is
said that the tube ﬂuid is “unmixed” as it is conﬁned to the tubes. The other ﬂuid is “mixed” as it is
somewhat unconﬁned and can mix with itself. In the second exchanger, there are ﬁns on the outside
of the tubes. One ﬂuid ﬂows through the tubes and is “unmixed.” The other ﬂuid ﬂows through the
channels formed by the ﬁns. This ﬂuid is also said to be “unmixed” as it is conﬁned to the channels,
which hinder its mixing.
Figs. 8.2 and 8.3 are photographs of heat exchangers. Fig. 8.2A shows shell-and-tube heat
exchangers used in a chemical plant to cool hot gases with water. Fig. 8.2B shows a tube bundle for a
shell-and-tube heat exchanger. In the foreground is the tube sheet to which the tubes are attached.
Metal plates, or “bafﬂes,” are seen further back in the photo. These bafﬂes direct the shell-side ﬂuid
around the outside of the tubes, assuring that the ﬂuid contacts the tubes as much as possible.

Fig. 8.2C shows U-tubes for a one-shell-pass, two-tube-pass heat exchanger. In the left of the photo is
a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. Finally, Fig. 8.2D is a crossﬂow heat exchanger. One ﬂuid ﬂows
through the copper tubes and the other ﬂuid ﬂows over the tubes. The aluminum ﬁns on the tubes
inhibit mixing of the outer ﬂuid. Hence, it is said that both ﬂuids are “unmixed.”

The exchanger is 13.5 inches long, 3 inches diameter, and of nickel brazed 316L stainless steel. This
model has 253 tubes, and its heat transfer area is 0.60 m2. Uses of the exchanger include chemical
processing, water for injection for pharmaceutical plants, and semiconductor manufacturing. Many

Finally, Fig. 8.4 shows a badly corroded tube sheet and tubes. The effect of corrosion on heat
transfer is discussed in Section 8.4 below. Corroded heat exchangers can often be repaired and returned
to service through tube replacement. Several companies in the United States and overseas provide such
service.
8.2.1 Temperature distribution in double-pipe heat exchangers
Fig. 8.5 shows a double-pipe heat exchanger, which consists of two concentric pipes (or tubes). Fluid A
ﬂows through the inner tube, and Fluid B ﬂows in the annular area between the tubes, which is called
the “shell.” The outer surface of the outer tube is well-insulated so that heat transfer between the heat
exchanger and the environment is insigniﬁcant compared with the heat transfer between the ﬂuids.
Fig. 8.5 shows both ﬂuids ﬂowing in the same direction, left to right. This is a double-pipe parallel ﬂow
exchanger. If the ﬂow direction of one of the ﬂuids was reversed, the exchanger would be a double-pipe
counterﬂow exchanger.

Let us say that the temperatures of the ﬂuids, TA and TB, are different, with TA being greater than
TB: Then there will be heat transfer across the tube wall from Fluid A to Fluid B. As discussed

where P R is the sum of the resistances between ﬂuids A and B. These resistances are the convective
resistance at the inner surface of the tube, the conductive resistance of the tube’s wall, and the
convective resistance at the outer surface of the tube.
The rate of heat transfer between the ﬂuids can also be expressed in terms of the overall heat
transfer coefﬁcient U. That is,
q ¼ UAðDTÞavg
(8.2)
where ðDTÞavg is the “average” temperature difference between the ﬂuids and A is the heat transfer
area between the ﬂuids.
A double-pipe heat exchanger does not have a single, unique area A. It has the area of the inner
surface of the tube and the area of the outer surface of the tube, which are different. The inner surface
has area Ai ¼ 2priL, where ri is the radius of the inner surface and L is the length of the tube.
Similarly, the outer surface of the tube has an area Ao ¼ 2proL, where ro is the radius of the outer
surface and L is the tube’s length. As the areas are different, the U values must be referenced to a
speciﬁc area: Ui is referenced to the inner surface area and Uo is referenced to the outer surface area.
The rate of heat transfer in Eq. (8.2) is therefore
q ¼ UiAiðDTÞavg ¼ UoAoðDTÞavg
(8.3)
From Eq. (8.3), it is seen that UiAi ¼ UoAo: As Ai ¼ 2priL and Ao ¼ 2proL, the coefﬁcients are

Let us continue our discussion of the double-pipe heat exchanger. Fig. 8.6 shows two double-pipe
exchangers. The one on the left is parallel ﬂow; the one on the right is counterﬂow. Under each ﬁgure
is a diagram showing how the ﬂuid temperatures change as they travel through the exchanger. The
hotter ﬂuid enters the exchanger at Thi and leaves at Tho: The colder ﬂuid enters at Tci and leaves at
Tco: We will be calling the left end of the exchanger “Location 1” and the right end of the exchanger
“Location 2.” Some interesting items: For parallel ﬂow exchanger, the colder ﬂuid cannot exit the

exchanger at a higher temperature than the hotter ﬂuid exits. However, for the counterﬂow
exchanger, the exit temperature of the colder ﬂuid can be higher than the exit temperature of the
hotter ﬂuid. Also, for the counterﬂow exchanger, the temperature curves are not generally parallel.
That is, the temperature difference between the hot and cold ﬂuids usually varies with location in the
exchanger. If, however, one ﬂuid is evaporating at constant temperature and the other ﬂuid is
condensing at constant temperature, then the temperature difference will be constant throughout the
exchanger. Such is also the case if the products of the mass ﬂow rate and the speciﬁc heat for the two
ﬂuids are equal.
Let us now determine the average temperature difference between the ﬂuids, which is needed in
Eqs. (8.2) and (8.3). Consider the parallel ﬂow exchanger in Fig. 8.6. We will take a vertical slice of the
exchanger between locations x and x þ dx. Fig. 8.7 shows control volumes for Fluids A and B on both
sides of the tube wall. The area of the wall between x and x þ dx is dA. We will assume that the
temperature of Fluid A is greater than the temperature of Fluid B. As the ﬂuids ﬂow through their
respective control volumes, Fluid A gives heat to Fluid B and Fluid A’s enthalpy decreases. Fluid B
experiences an increase in enthalpy due to the heat received from Fluid A. The various energy ﬂows are
shown in Fig. 8.7.
For Fluid A, the energy balance is
_mAcATA ¼ UdAðTA  TBÞ þ _mAcAðTA þ dTAÞ

For Fluid B, the energy balance is

In these two equations, _m is the mass ﬂow rate, c is the speciﬁc heat, T is the ﬂuid temperature, U is
the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient of the exchanger, and dA is the differential wall area between the
ﬂuids. Subscripts indicate the particular ﬂuid: the hot ﬂuid (Fluid A) and the cold ﬂuid (Fluid B).
Rearranging Eq. (8.5), we get

Rearranging Eq. (8.6), we get

Both sides of Eq. (8.10) can now be integrated over the entire length of the heat exchanger, from the

speciﬁc heats are constants, we have

and Eq. (8.8) may be written as
dq ¼ _mBcBdTB
(8.13)
Integrating Eqs. (8.12) and (8.13) over the entire length of the heat exchanger; i.e., from the left end
(Location 1) to the right end (Location 2), we get expressions for the total rate of heat ﬂow q for the
exchanger:

(8.16)
Comparing this equation to Eq. (8.2), it is seen that the temperature factor is the average tem-
perature difference between the two ﬂuids in the heat exchanger. As the factor is the average (or mean)
temperature difference and contains a log function, the temperature term is called the Log Mean
Temperature Difference (LMTD). Summarizing, we have
q ¼ UAðLMTDÞ

In Eq. (8.18), we changed the subscripts on the temperatures from A and B to the more commonly
used subscripts h and c, respectively. We can do this as Fluid A is the hot ﬂuid and Fluid B is the cold
ﬂuid.
Calculation of the LMTD looks difﬁcult, but it really is not. The term ðTA  TBÞ1 is the tem-
perature difference of the ﬂuids at the left end of the exchanger and the term ðTA  TBÞ2 is the
temperature difference of the ﬂuids at the right end. Eq. (8.18) says that LMTD is the temperature
difference of the ﬂuids at the left end of the exchanger minus the temperature difference of the ﬂuids
at the right end of the exchanger divided by the natural log of the ratio of the two temperature
differences. Indeed, Eq. (8.18) can be written even more simply as

We derived the above equations using a parallel ﬂow double-pipe heat exchanger. If we had done
the derivation for a counterﬂow double-pipe exchanger, and the cold ﬂuid went right to left, the only
change in the equations would be Eq. (8.15), which would be replaced with
q ¼ _mBcB

8.2 Types of heat exchangers

Just keep in mind that the temperature differences in the equations (and q) are positive.
Caution: For a counterﬂow exchanger, DT1 can be equal to DT2: If this is the case, Eq. (8.19)
calculates the LMTD as 0/0. For this special case, the temperature difference between the ﬂuids is the
same throughout the exchanger, and DT1 ¼ DT2 should be used as the value for ðDTÞavg instead of the
calculated LMTD.
Example 8.1 shows how easy it is to calculate the LMTD for a double-pipe heat exchanger. It also
shows that the LMTD for a parallel ﬂow exchanger is different from the LMTD for a counterﬂow heat
exchanger having the same entrance and exit ﬂuid temperatures.
Example 8.1
LMTD for parallel and counterﬂow double-pipe exchangers
Problem
In a double-pipe heat exchanger, the hotter ﬂuid enters at 150 C and leaves at 80 C and the colder ﬂuid enters at 20 C and
leaves at 60 C. Determine the LMTD if the heat exchanger is
(a) parallel ﬂow and (b) counterﬂow.
Solution
Parallel ﬂow. The ﬁrst step in the solution is to draw a sketch of the temperature distribution of the exchanger and put the
temperatures and ﬂow directions on the sketch. Looking at Fig. 8.6, we have the parallel heat exchanger in the ﬁgure
below.

It is seen that the LMTD’s are different for the two different types of double-pipe heat exchangers even though the entering
and leaving ﬂuid temperatures are the same.
Another interesting observation is that the LMTD for the counterﬂow exchanger is greater than the LMTD for the parallel
ﬂow exchanger. This is a general characteristic and the reason why counterﬂow exchangers are usually preferred over par-
allel exchangers. For the same U, A, and ﬂuid entering and leaving temperatures, a counterﬂow exchanger will have a
greater heat transfer rate q than a parallel ﬂow exchanger.

Chapter 8 Heat exchangers

8.3 The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient
Let us now look at the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient in some detail. Fig. 8.8 shows a cross-sectional
view of the inner tube of a double-pipe heat exchanger. The convective coefﬁcient is hi at the inner
surface of the tube and ho at the outer surface. The tube has inner and outer radii ri and ro and a length
L perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁgure. Fluid A in inside the tube; Fluid B is in the shell; and Fluid A
has a higher temperature than Fluid B.
From Eqs. (8.1) through (8.3), we have
q ¼ DT
P R ¼ UiAiDT ¼ UoAoDT
(8.21)
Resistances were discussed in Chapter 3. At the inner surface of the tube, the convective resistance
is
1
hiAi: At the outer surface of the tube, the convective resistance is
1
hoAo:
And, the resistance of the tube wall is lnðro=riÞ
2pkL , where k is the thermal conductivity of the tube
material and L is the length of the tube. The circumferential areas in Eq. (8.21) are
Ai ¼ 2priL and Ao ¼ 2proL: Inserting these resistances into Eq. (8.21), we have

8.3 The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient

coefﬁcients for liquids are usually quite higher than those for gases. Therefore, if one ﬂuid is a liquid
and the other is a gas, the term related to the liquid is often negligible.
Typical ranges of the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient are given in Table 8.1.
The overall heat transfer coefﬁcients in Eqs. (8.22) and (8.23) are for new, clean heat exchangers.
With extended operation, the coefﬁcients may appreciably decrease due to degradation of the heat
transfer surfaces through corrosion, deposits, and possibly biological fouling such as algae. Both the
inner and outer surfaces of the tube may be affected. Additional resistance terms may be added to the
denominators of Eqs. (8.22) and (8.23) to account for the change in the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient.

where Rfi is the fouling factor (or resistance) on the inner surface of the tube and Rfo is the fouling
factor (or resistance) on the outer surface of the tube.
By comparing Eq. (8.22) to Eq. (8.24) and Eq. (8.23) to Eq. (8.25), we arrive at the following
relations between the overall heat transfer coefﬁcients for a new (clean) exchanger and one with

Example 8.2
Overall heat transfer coefﬁcient and fouling factor
Problem
A refrigerant is ﬂowing through the tube of a double-pipe counterﬂow heat exchanger. The tube is 1-inch Type L copper.
Air ﬂows in the annular region of the exchanger. The convective coefﬁcient on the inner surface of the tube is 140 W/m2 C
and the coefﬁcient on the outer surface of the tube is 40 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient based on the area of the outer surface of the tube?
(b) After a year of service, the inner surface of the tube has a fouling factor of 0.0002 m2 C/Wand the outer surface has
a fouling factor of 0.00015 m2 C/W. By what percentage has the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient decreased from that
calculated for the clean exchanger in Part (a)?
Solution
From the Internet, the copper tubing has an outside diameter of 1.125 inch and a wall thickness of 0.05 inch. Also, copper
has a thermal conductivity of 400 W/m C. Therefore,
ro ¼ ð1:125 = 2Þ in 

The new exchanger has an overall heat transfer coefﬁcient of 30.45 W/m2 C based on the outer surface area of the tube.

Comparing Eq. (8.25) to Eq. (8.23), it is seen that Eq. (8.25) has two additional resistance terms in the denominator. They are
Rfiðro = riÞ ¼ 0:0002ð0:01429 = 0:01302Þ ¼ 0:00022 and Rfo ¼ 0:00015:
Adding these values to the denominator in the calculation for UoðnewÞ above, we have, for the year-old exchanger
Uoðyear  oldÞ ¼

0:03284 þ 0:00022 þ 0:00015 ¼ 30:11 W=m2 C
The % decrease in Uo is ð30:4530:11Þ

 100 ¼ 1.12%.
It is seen that the effect of the fouling is very, very minimal.
8.4 Analysis methods
The two most common methods to solve heat exchanger problems are the LMTD method and the
effectivenessenumber of transfer unit (ε-NTU) method. Although both methods can be used for a
given problem, each method has its particular strong points. The LMTD method is especially useful in
the design and sizing of heat exchangers. If inlet and outlet temperatures and the overall heat transfer
coefﬁcient are given, or are easily determined, then the LMTD can be readily calculated and the
LMTD method can be used to determine the heat transfer rate and the required surface area for the
exchanger. If, on the other hand, only the inlet temperatures and ﬂow rates are known, then the LMTD
cannot be easily determined. Use of the LMTD method will entail tedious iterations to ultimately
determine the LMTD and achieve a successful problem solution. The ε-NTU method is greatly
superior in these performance-type problems where the outlet temperatures are to be determined. We
will now discuss the two methods and give examples to illustrate their use.
8.4.1 Log mean temperature difference method
8.4.1.1 Double-pipe heat exchangers
The outer surfaces of heat exchangers are well-insulated and the heat transfer to the surrounding
environment is very small. It is assumed that this heat transfer is negligible and that the total amount of
heat leaving the hot ﬂuid is gained by the cold ﬂuid. There are three equations for q, which can be used
to solve problems by the LMTD method:
For the heat leaving the hot ﬂuid, we have
q ¼ _mhcphðDTÞh ¼ _mhcphðThi  ThoÞ
(8.27)
For the heat gained by the cold ﬂuid, we have
q ¼ _mccpcðDTÞc ¼ _mccpcðTco  TciÞ
(8.28)
and the equation with the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient U and the LMTD is
q ¼ UAðLMTDÞ
(8.29)
318
Chapter 8 Heat exchangers

The temperature subscripts in Eqs. (8.27) and (8.28) are
hi ¼ hot ﬂuid entering (going in)
ho ¼ hot ﬂuid leaving (going out)
ci ¼ cold ﬂuid entering (going in)
co ¼ cold ﬂuid leaving (going out)
Example 8.3 shows the application of Eqs. (8.27)e(8.29) in determining the required heat transfer
area of an exchanger and the ﬂow rate for one of the ﬂuids.
Example 8.3
LMTD method for parallel and counterﬂow double-pipe exchangers
Problem
A double-pipe heat exchanger heats water from 20 to 65 C. The heating is done by hot gases (cp ¼ 900 J/kg C) that enter
the exchanger at 250 C and leave at 75 C. The ﬂow rate of the water is 2 kg/s. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient of the
heat exchanger is 280 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the surface area required if the heat exchanger is parallel ﬂow?
(b) What is the surface area required if the heat exchanger is counterﬂow?
(c) What is the ﬂow rate of the hot gases?
Solution
(a) We ﬁrst sketch the temperature diagram for a double-pipe parallel heat exchanger, putting the temperatures and ﬂow
directions on the sketch.

Solving this for A, we have A [ 19.15 m2.
(b) Similarly, we sketch the temperature diagram for a double-pipe counterﬂow heat exchanger.

8.4.1.2 Nonedouble-pipe heat exchangers
Not all heat exchangers are of the double-pipe type. For example, three nonedouble-pipe exchangers
were shown in Fig. 8.1BeD. If a heat exchanger is not a double pipe, Eqs. (8.27) and (8.28) are still
applicable. However, Eq. (8.29) has to be modiﬁed with the addition of a correction factor, F. The
equation becomes
q ¼ UAFðLMTDÞdpcf
(8.30)
Take special note of the subscript on the LMTD term. It stands for “double-pipe counterﬂow.”
The correction factor F is a correction to the LMTD which we would have if the heat exchanger were
of the double-pipe counterﬂow type rather than the nonedouble-pipe type. This is further illustrated in
the examples presented below.
The value of F is provided for some common types of heat exchangers in Figs. 8.9e8.11 below. In
these graphs, F is a function of parameters P and R, which are

(8.32)
In Eqs. (8.31) and (8.32), the t temperatures are for the tube-side ﬂuid and the T temperatures are for
the shell-side ﬂuid. However, it makes no difference which ﬂuid is assigned to the tube or to the shell.
If the problem is not speciﬁc, you have the freedom to assign either of the ﬂuids to the tube or the shell.
The subscripts “i” and “o” refer to the ﬂuid’s inlet and outlet.
Functions for F for some common types of exchangers are given in Table 8.3.
Graphs and functions for F were given in a pioneering 1940 paper by Bowman, Mueller, and Nagle
[3]. More recent papers on the LMTD method and the correction factor are in Refs. [4e7]. Compi-
lations of graphs and functions for F are in Refs. [8,9]. Please note that a graph and function have not
been included above for crossﬂow exchangers with both ﬂuids unmixed. Such exchangers are
discussed in Refs. [3,5]. Problems involving a crossﬂow exchanger with both ﬂuids unmixed may be
treated using the ε-NTU method of Section 8.4.2.

Chapter 8 Heat exchangers

There are a couple of special cases: First, if the heat exchanger is a double-pipe exchanger, then
F ¼ 1 and the LMTD in Eq. (8.30) is the one appropriate for the type of double-pipe exchanger, i.e.,
parallel ﬂow or counterﬂow. Also, if one or both of the ﬂuids is condensing or evaporating, then F ¼ 1
and there is no need to use the F graphs or F equations for the speciﬁc type of heat exchanger.
Example 8.4
LMTD method with correction factor F
Problem
A shell-and-tube heat exchanger with one shell pass and two tube passes has water in both the shell and the tubes. The hot
water enters at 90 C and is cooled to 60 C. The cold water enters at 10 C and is heated to 50 C. The rating of the heat
exchanger is 80 kW and the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is 950 W/m2 C.
(a) What is the needed surface area of the exchanger?
(b) What are the ﬂow rates of the two water streams?
Solution
This is a nonedouble-pipe exchanger so we need correction factor F. Graphs for F are based on a double-pipe counterﬂow
exchanger with the same entering and leaving temperatures as those for the nonedouble-pipe exchanger of our problem.
Therefore, we ﬁrst sketch the temperature diagram for a double-pipe counterﬂow exchanger and put temperatures and ﬂow
directions on the diagram.

For the hot water, q ¼ _mhcphðDTÞh ¼ 80; 000 ¼ _mhð4180Þð90 60Þ.
Solving for _mh, we get _mh ¼ 0:638 kg=s.
The cold water ﬂows at 0.478 kg/s and the hot water ﬂows at 0.638 kg/s.

Example 8.5
LMTD method with condensing ﬂuid
Problem
It is desired to heat water using condensing steam in a crossﬂow, unﬁnned heat exchanger. The water is in the tubes and the
steam ﬂows across the tubes. The steam is at 130 C. The water ﬂow rate is 3 kg/s and the water is heated from 20 to 90 C.
The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is 3500 W/m2 C. What is the required surface area of the exchanger?
Solution
This is a nonedouble-pipe exchanger so the equation for the heat ﬂow rate is q ¼ UAFðLMTDÞdpcf . Normally, we would
have to use a graph or equation to ﬁnd F for the crossﬂow heat exchanger. However, we have a ﬂuid that is condensing.
This is a special case, and F ¼ 1. The temperature diagram is given in the ﬁgure below.

Example 8.6
LMTD method with iteration
Problem
A double-pipe counterﬂow heat exchanger uses exhaust gases (cp ¼ 1000 J/kg C) to heat 2 kg/s of water from 15 to 40 C.
The gases enter the exchanger at 250 C. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient of the exchanger is 350 W/m2 C and the heat
transfer area of the exchanger is 5 m2. What is the ﬂow rate of the exhaust gases?

Chapter 8 Heat exchangers

We can get the heat transfer rate from Eq. (1):
q ¼ _mccpcðDTÞc ¼ 2ð4180Þð40  15Þ ¼ 2:09  105 W
Using this in Eq. (2), we have

Iteration is needed to solve Eq. (6) for the exit temperature of the exhaust gases. Once that is known, Eq. (4) can be used
to obtain the desired ﬂow rate of the gases. For the iteration, we could solve Eq. (6) by trial and error: Pick a value for
Tho, evaluate the right side of Eq. (6) and see if it is equal to 119.4. If not, pick another value of Tho and repeat the
process until the right side of Eq. (6) achieves 119.4. This can be very tedious. A better way is to use Excel’s Goal
Seek to do the iterations and get an answer.
On the Excel spreadsheet, put the initial guessed value for Tho in one cell, say cell A1. (Note: Tho has to be less than 250.
We used a guess of 40. The value is not critical.) Put the right side of Eq. (6) in cell A2. That is, cell A2 will
have [(225-A1)/LN(210/(A1-15)).
Call up Goal Seek and tell it to make cell A2 equal to 119.4 by changing cell A1.
From Goal Seek, we got that Tho ¼ 74.6 C. Using this in Eq. (4), we ﬁnd that the ﬂow rate of the exhaust gases
is 1.192 kg/s.
Example 8.7
LMTD method when outlet temperatures are not given
Problem
Hot water is available at 75 C in a factory. It is desired to use the water in a double-pipe counterﬂow heat exchanger to heat
cold water. The cold water enters the exchanger at 15 C and ﬂows at a rate of 2 kg/s through the exchanger. The hot water
ﬂows at a rate of 1.5 kg/s. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient of the exchanger is 500 W/m2 C and the surface area of the
exchanger is 8 m2.
(a) What is the rating of the exchanger (kW)?
(b) What are the exit temperatures of the two water streams?

We have three equations for the heat transfer rate:
q ¼ _mccpcðDTÞc

q ¼ _mhcphðDTÞh

q ¼ UAðLMTDÞ

Putting the known values into these equations, we have

(6)
We thus have three equations, Eqs. (4)e(6), to solve for the three unknowns q; Tco; and Tho: Iteration is needed. We
could solve the equations by trial and error. That is, guess Tco, use Eq. (4) to get q, put the q value into Eq. (5) to get
Tho, use the Tco and Tho in Eq. (6) to calculate q, and see if that q value equals the q value of Eqs. (4) and (5). If not,
pick another Tco and repeat the process until the q’s match. This is a potentially very tedious process. Fortunately, we
can use software to do the iteration. One way is to use Excel’s Solver add-in program. To do this, we rearrange the
equations to create functions. Let us call the functions f1; f2; and f3:
From Eq. (4), we have f1 ¼ q  2ð4180ÞðTco 15Þ ¼ 0.
From Eq. (5), we have f2 ¼ q  1:5ð4180Þð75 ThoÞ ¼ 0.
From Eq. (6), we have f3 ¼ q  ð500Þð8Þ ½ð75TcoÞðTho15Þ
ln
75  Tco


¼ 0.
If all three functions are zero, we have the solution to the three equations. And, making the quantity f 2
1 þ f 2
2 þ f 2
3 equal
to zero will assure that all three functions are indeed zero. In an Excel spreadsheet, we use three cells for the guesses for
Tco; Tho; and q: Let us say we use cells A1, A2, and A3. (Reasonable guesses could be 40, 40, and 1e5.) In three other
cells, say cells F1, F2, and F3, we put the three functions written with cell addresses. For example, cell F1 will
have ¼ A3-24180(A1-15). Finally, there is a test cell, say cell F4, with ¼ F1^2 D F2^2 D F3^2 in it. We call up Solver
and tell it to make cell F4 zero by changing cells A1 through A3. If there is no convergence to a solution, tell Solver to
make cell F4 a minimum. The criterion that F4 is zero is often too stringent.
From Solver we got the results q ¼ 1.54  105 W, Tco ¼ 33:4 C, and Tho ¼ 50:5 C.
(a) The exchanger’s rating is 154 kW.
(b) The cold water exits at 33.4 C and the hot water exits at 50.5 C.
8.4.2 Effectivenessenumber of transfer unit method
In the last two examples, iteration was needed for problem solution. The LMTD method, although
excellent for heat exchanger sizing problems, requires iteration for performance-type problems in
which both the inlet and outlet temperatures are not given. One can only imagine the difﬁculty in
solving iteration problems in the 1950s and earlier without the assistance of modern-day calculators
and computers.
Kays and London [10] developed the Effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units (ε-NTU) method
that eliminates the need for iteration for most performance-type problems. The method is as follows:
The “heat capacity rate” is Cc for the cold ﬂuid and Ch for the hot ﬂuid. It is deﬁned as the product
of the mass ﬂow rate and the speciﬁc heat.
For the cold fluid; Cc ¼ _mccpc
(8.33)
For the hot fluid; Ch ¼ _mhcph
(8.34)
326
Chapter 8 Heat exchangers

For the two ﬂuids in a heat exchanger, one has the higher heat capacity rate, Cmax, and the other has
the lower rate, Cmin: The ﬂuid with the higher heat capacity rate is called the “maximum ﬂuid” and the
ﬂuid with the lower heat capacity rate is called the “minimum ﬂuid”.
The “effectiveness” of a heat exchanger is deﬁned as
ε ¼
actual heat transfer
maximum heat transfer ¼
q
qmax
(8.35)
The actual heat transfer is given by Eqs. (8.27) and (8.28).
q ¼ _mccpcðTco  TciÞ ¼ _mhcphðThi  ThoÞ
(8.36)
Using the deﬁnition of the heat capacity rate, Eq. (8.36) can be written as
q ¼ CcðTco  TciÞ ¼ ChðThi  ThoÞ
(8.37)
The maximum heat transfer is that where the minimum ﬂuid undergoes the maximum possible
temperature change in the exchanger. The maximum temperature in an exchanger is that of the
incoming hot ﬂuid and the minimum temperature in an exchanger is that of the incoming cold ﬂuid.
Therefore, the maximum possible temperature change in an exchanger is Thi  Tci, and
qmax ¼ CminðThi  TciÞ
(8.38)
From Eqs. (8.35) and (8.38), we have
ε ¼
q
qmax
¼
q
CminðThi  TciÞ
(8.39)
Looking at Eq. (8.39), we see that if the effectiveness ε, the heat capacity rate for the minimum
ﬂuid, and the incoming temperatures are known, then the actual heat transfer of the heat exchanger can
be determined. The outlet temperatures of the ﬂuids do not need to be known.
Using Eqs. (8.37) and (8.39), the relation for the effectiveness can be written solely in terms of the
ﬂuid temperatures.
If the cold ﬂuid is the minimum ﬂuid, then
ε ¼ Tco  Tci
Thi  Tci
(8.40)
If the hot ﬂuid is the minimum ﬂuid, then
ε ¼ Thi  Tho
Thi  Tci
(8.41)
Another important dimensionless parameter for the ε-NTU method is the “number of transfer
units,” (NTU). This is deﬁned as
NTU ¼ UA
Cmin
(8.42)
Looking at Eq. (8.42), we see that the NTU is directly proportional to the heat transfer area A. The
larger the NTU, the larger the heat exchanger area A.
The effectiveness ε for a given type of heat exchanger is a function of the ratio of heat capacity rates
Cratio ¼ Cmin
Cmax and the number of transfer units NTU. Effectiveness graphs for various types of heat
exchangers are in Figs. 8.12 through 8.17A and B. Effectiveness equations are in Table 8.4.

We now present a problem that would have required iteration if it had been solved by the LMTD
method. The ε-NTU method does not require iteration.
Example 8.8
Effectivenessenumber of transfer unit method when outlet temperatures are not given
Problem
This is the same problem as Example 8.7. In that example, we showed that use of the LMTD method required iteration for
a solution. In this example, we show how much easier it is to use the ε-NTU method when outlet temperatures are not
given. Iteration is not needed for the solution.
Please refer to the problem statement and temperature diagram for Example 8.7.

In summary, the heat transfer rate of the exchanger is 1.505 3 105 W.
The cold water leaves the exchanger at 33.0 C.
The hot water leaves the exchanger at 51.0 C.
These answers are almost identical to those obtained via the LMTD solution in Example 8.7. The differences are due to the
minor inaccuracy of reading the graphs. It is seen that no iteration was needed for the ε-NTU solution.
We close this section with three more examples using the ε-NTU method.
Example 8.9
Effectivenessenumber of transfer unit method for determining surface area
Problem
A crossﬂow heat exchanger uses exhaust gases (cp ¼ 1020 J/kg C) to heat water. The water ﬂows through the tubes and the
gases ﬂow over the outside of the tubes, which are ﬁnned. The water ﬂows at 1.5 kg/s. It enters the exchanger at 20 C and
leaves at 70 C. The exhaust gases enter at 190 C and leave at 85 C. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is 250 W/m2 C.

q ¼ ð6270Þð70  20Þ ¼ _mhð1020Þð190  85Þ

Cmin ¼ Ch ¼ 2990ðexhaust gasesÞ
Cmax ¼ Cc ¼ 6270ðwaterÞ
Cmin = Cmax ¼ 2990=6270 ¼ 0:48
As the minimum ﬂuid is the exhaust gases, the equation for the effectiveness is
ε ¼ CcðTco  TciÞ
CminðThi  TciÞ ¼ ð6270Þð70  20Þ
ð2990Þð190  20Þ ¼ 0:62
With Cmin=Cmax ¼ 0:48 and ε ¼ 0:62; we go into Fig. 8.16 and ﬁnd that NTU ¼ 1:3.
NTU ¼ UA
Cmin ¼ 1:3 ¼ ð250ÞA
2990 Solving for A, we get A ¼ 15.5 m2.
The needed surface area of the exchanger is 15.5 m2.
Note: As both the inlet and exit temperatures of the ﬂuids were given, the LMTD method can also be readily used to solve
this problem. The amount of work needed for both solutions is about the same.

A shell-and-tube heat exchanger uses condensing steam to heat water. Both the steam and the water make a single pass

The outlet temperature of the water is 93.7 C.
(Note: If we had solved this problem using the LMTD method, we would have needed iterations due to the log term in the
LMTD.)
The ﬁnal ε-NTU problem is a more complicated one. We mentioned that the ε-NTU method was
especially useful if the LMTD solution for a problem required iteration. Well, here is an ε-NTU
solution that also requires iteration.

Problem
Air is being heated by hot oil in a crossﬂow heat exchanger. The air enters at 20 C and 1 atm pressure and is heated to 40 C.
The ﬂow rate of the air is 1.3 m3/s. The oil (cp ¼ 2100 J/kg C) enters the exchanger at 120 C. The oil ﬂows in the tubes of
the exchanger and the air ﬂows across the unﬁnned tubes. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient is 75 W/m2C and the heat
transfer area is 12 m2. What is the heat transfer rate of the exchanger and the exit temperature of the oil?
Solution
We ﬁrst draw the temperature diagram.

We then have to change the volumetric ﬂow rate of the air to a mass ﬂow rate. Using the ideal gas law, we have

The hot ﬂuid is the oil and the cold ﬂuid is the air.
ðairÞ Cc ¼ _mccpc ¼ ð1:565Þð1007Þ ¼ 1576
ðoilÞ Ch ¼ _mhcph ¼ _mhð2100Þ
The heat transfer rate is q ¼ CcðDTÞc ¼ ð1576Þð40 20Þ ¼ 3.152  104 W.
As we do not have _mh; we do not know which fluid is the minimum fluid. We have the value of the capacity rate for the
air, so let us assume the air is the minimum ﬂuid.
Then, Cmin ¼ Cc ¼ 1576.
The number of transfer units is NTU ¼ UA

With these values, we go into Fig. 8.17B to get Cmin=Cmax: We ﬁnd that there is no solution for our NTU and ε values.
Hence, the oil, not the air, must be the minimum ﬂuid.
With the oil as the minimum ﬂuid, we have

To determine the ﬂow rate of the oil, _mh, we need an iterative process. We make an initial guess for _mh and calculate
NTU and ε from Eqs. (1) and (2). With these values of NTU and ε, we can go into Fig. 8.17A and determine the corre-
sponding value of Cratio ¼ Cmin=Cmax: We can get
_mh from the value of this ratio as Cmax ¼ Cc ¼ 1576 and
Cmin ¼ _mhð2100Þ: So,
Cratio ¼ Cmin
Cmax
¼ _mhð2100Þ
1576

We compare the calculated value for _mh with the initial guessed value. If they agree, we have reached a solution. If not, we
make another guess for _mh and iterate again and again until the calculated value agrees with the guessed value. (Note: We
are using Fig. 8.17A as the minimum ﬂuid, the oil, is the unmixed ﬂuid.)
8.4 Analysis methods
335

Alternatively, we can use the equations in Table 8.4 to reach the solution. For a crossﬂow exchanger with one ﬂuid
unmixed and the other mixed, and with the unmixed ﬂuid being the minimum ﬂuid, the appropriate equation is
ε ¼ ð1 = CratioÞ


 Cratio

The variables in this equation are all functions of _mh as given in Eqs. (1)e(3). Therefore, Eq. (4) is a function of only one
variable, _mh: Eq. (4) is rearranged to
ε  ð1 = CratioÞ

1  exp

 Cratio

1  eNTU

(5)
Eq. (5) can be solved by Matlab’s fzero function, Excel’s Goal Seek, or Excel’s Solver. The software iterates with changing
values of _mh until the left side of Eq. (5) is zero.
It turns out that Eq. (5) has multiple solutions. We want the solution that hasε  1 and Cratio  1. If Excel is used, it turns
out that Solver is better than Goal Seek as Solver allows constraints (for example, ε  1 and Cratio  1). Goal Seek does
not have the capability of constraints. Depending on the initial guess of _mh, the solution by Goal Seek may give a solution
where ε and/or Cratio are greater than unity. Yes, it is a solution to Eq. (5), but it is not the one we are looking for.
Using Solver, we got the result that _mh ¼ 0.186 kg/s. Other parameters for the solution were
Cratio ¼ Cmin=Cmax ¼ 0:248, ε ¼ 0.807, and NTU ¼ 2.3.
For the oil, q ¼ _mhcphðDTÞh.
3:152  104 ¼ ð0:186Þð2100Þð120  ThoÞ
Solving for Tho, we get Tho ¼ 39:3 C.
The exit temperature of the oil is 39.3 C.
8.5 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed the thermal aspects of some common types of heat exchangers. We
discussed the determination of the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient for an exchanger and the impact of
the fouling of heat exchanger surfaces on the coefﬁcient. We then outlined two methods of thermal
analysis: the LMTD method and the ε-NTU method. Although either method could be used for thermal
analysis, we found that the LMTD method was especially useful for design and sizing of the heat
exchangers, while the ε-NTU method was especially useful for determining heat exchanger
performance.
There are several factors other than thermal, which must be considered in the selection of a heat
exchanger for a particular purpose. Consideration must be given to the cost of the exchangereboth the
capital cost and the operating costs. For example, there will be costs for cleaning of the exchanger to
maintain the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient, and electrical costs for pumping the ﬂuids through the
exchanger. An important factor is scheduling. Is the exchanger off-the-shelf or must it be custom-
designed and custom-manufactured? Does its delivery schedule impact the overall schedule for the
project? There are structural aspects such as the support for the exchanger and the design of the bafﬂes
to prevent or minimize vibration problems while still maintaining the desired ﬂuid ﬂow. The exchanger
will also have physical constraints. It must ﬁt in its allocated space in a plant. Indeed, there are many
factors to be considered in the selection of a heat exchanger. Thermal design is a major factor, but there
are other factors of signiﬁcance.

the Internet or other reference sources. Some good reference sources are mentioned at the end of
Chapter 1. If you use the Internet, double-check the validity of the information by using more than

In all problems, unless otherwise stated, the ﬂuid pressure is atmospheric. Gas properties in the
Appendix are at atmospheric pressure. If a problem has a gas at other than atmospheric pressure,
affected properties such as density and kinematic viscosity should be modiﬁed accordingly
through use of the ideal gas law.

pumps. This chapter discusses natural or free convection in which the ﬂuid has much gentler motion
caused by density gradients in the ﬂuid. Natural convection is an important topic. It has many
applications, such as radiators for heating a room, refrigeration coils, multiglazed windows, trans-
mission lines, electric transformers, immersion heaters, and cooling of electronic devices. As ﬂow
velocities are small, in many cases natural convection may be insigniﬁcant. However, in other situ-
ations, it may be the only signiﬁcant mechanism of heat transfer.
Our main objective, both in Chapter 6 and this chapter, is to determine the convective coefﬁcient, h,
for a variety of heat transfer situations and geometries. Much experimentation has been performed in
the ﬁeld of convective heat transfer. The results of these investigations have been correlated by
researchers using dimensionless numbers. We will ﬁrst discuss the dimensionless numbers associated
with natural convection. Following that, we will present correlations for a variety of geometries:
vertical plates, horizontal plates, inclined plates, cylinders, and spheres. We also will discuss natural
convection in enclosed spaces such as rectangular spaces relevant to double-glazed windows and solar
collectors, annular spaces between concentric cylinders, and spaces between concentric spheres.
7.2 Basic considerations
As discussed in Chapter 6, there are three major dimensionless numbers associated with forced
convectiondthe Nusselt, Reynolds, and Prandtl numbers. The convective coefﬁcient h is found in the
Nusselt number, Nu.
Nu ¼
hL
k
(7.1)
and the ﬂow velocity is in the Reynolds number, Re.
Re ¼ rVL
m
¼ VL
y
(7.2)
Another relevant dimensionless number is the Prandtl number, Pr, which contains ﬂuid properties.
Pr ¼ cpm
k
(7.3)
In these numbers, h ¼ convective coefﬁcient.
L ¼ a characteristic length for the problem.
k ¼ thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid.
V ¼ ﬂuid velocity.
r ¼ density of the ﬂuid.
m ¼ absolute viscosity of the ﬂuid.
y ¼ kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid.
cp ¼ speciﬁc heat at constant pressure of the ﬂuid.
For forced convection, correlation of experimental data gives the Nusselt number as a function of
the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. That is,
Nu ¼ fðRe; PrÞ
(7.4)
After the Nusselt number has been determined, the convective coefﬁcient can be obtained from it.

For natural convection, ﬂuid ﬂow is caused by density gradients in the ﬂuid. The ﬂow velocity is
signiﬁcantly less than for forced convection. Therefore, the Reynolds number is no longer relevant. It
is replaced with the Grashof number, GrL, which contains the acceleration of gravity, g, and the
volumetric coefﬁcient of thermal expansion, b.
Gr

. For ideal gases, b ¼ 1
T, where T is the absolute temperature of
the gas. For nonideal gases and liquids, b is obtained from property tables.
An Important Note: The Grashof number is positive. It contains the term ðTs TNÞ This probably
should have been written jTs TNj. However, carrying around the absolute value function is unwieldy.
So, just remember that Gr is positive and when the ﬂuid temperature is higher than the surface tem-
perature, make the term ðTN TsÞ rather than ðTs TNÞ
For natural convection, experimental data are correlated using the Grashof, Prandtl, and Nusselt
numbers:
Nu ¼ hL
k
¼ fðGr; PrÞ
(7.7)
Once the Nusselt number for a problem is found, the convective coefﬁcient may be obtained from
Eq. (7.5).
Another dimensionless number found in natural convection correlations is the Rayleigh Number,
Ra. This is the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers.

Like forced convection, hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers also form on surfaces asso-
ciated with natural convection. Figs. 7.1 and 7.2 show the hydrodynamic boundary layer for a vertical
surface. Fig. 7.1 is for a surface that is hotter than the ﬂuid, and Fig. 7.2 is for a surface that is colder
than the ﬂuid. In both cases, the boundary layer starts at the leading edge x ¼ 0. The boundary layer is
ﬁrst laminar, and then, if the plate is long enough, the boundary layer turns turbulent. For natural
convection on a vertical surface, the transition from laminar to turbulent occurs at critical distance xc
where the local Rayleigh number is about 109.

Chapter 7 Natural (free) convection

Many experimental studies have been performed to determine the convective heat transfer for
different geometries. Some correlation equations from these studies are given below. We include
correlations for ﬂat plates, cylinders, spheres, and enclosed spaces.
7.3 Natural convection for ﬂat plates
The following sections include correlations for vertical, horizontal, and inclined ﬂat plates.
7.3.1 Vertical plate
For a vertical plate, the characteristic length, L, is the height of the plate.
7.3.1.1 Constant temperature surface
For a constant temperature surface, Churchill and Chu [1] recommend the following correlation
equation if there is only a laminar region on the plate, i.e., if RaL < 109:

For Eqs. (7.10) through (7.13), ﬂuid properties should be evaluated at the ﬁlm temperature Tf ¼

Example 7.1
Vertical plate with constant surface temperature
Problem
Avertical plate is in 25 C water. It is 10 cm wide and 20 cm high. A surface of the plate has a constant temperature of 75 C.
What is the rate of heat transfer from the surface?

The rate of heat transfer from the surface is

It is interesting (and somewhat upsetting) to note that the correlation of Eq. (7.13) gives a result of 881 W, which is 28%
different from the 1216 W value we calculated using Eq. (7.11). This gives emphasis to the fact that results from existing
correlations are only approximate. Accurate results can often only be obtained through experimentation on the actual sur-
faces in question.
Example 7.2
Vertical plate with constant heat ﬂux
Problem
A thin vertical plate is 1.2 m high and 0.5 m wide. The left side of the plate is insulated and the right side absorbs a constant
heat ﬂux of 200 W/m2. There is convection from the right side of the plate to the adjacent 20 C air. Assume that radiation
from the plate is negligible.
(a) What is the temperature at the midheight of the plate, i.e., at x ¼ L=2 ¼ 0:6 m ?
(b) What is the temperature at the top of the plate, i.e., at x ¼ L ¼ 1:2 m ?
Solution
(a) To start the solution, we have to make an educated guess of the midheight surface temperature. Convective coef-
ﬁcient values for natural convection in air are small, say on the order of magnitude of 5 W/m2 C. Using Eq. (7.16),
we have Ts ¼ TN þ qs0

Note: We used the Churchill and Chu correlation equation, Eq. (7.17), for this solution. Alternatively, we could have used
the Fujii and Fujii equation, Eq. (7.18). If the latter equation had been used, the results for the midheight and top surface
temperatures would have been 77.5 and 86.0 C, respectively. The Churchill and Chu correlation gives temperatures about
7 C lower than the Fujii and Fujii correlation. Without experimentation on the actual plate, it is not possible to make a
judgment of which correlation is more accurate.
7.3.1.2 Constant heat ﬂux surface
For a constant heat ﬂux surface, we are interested in determining the temperature distribution of the
plate’s surface, that is, we want to ﬁnd TsðxÞ: For convective heat transfer, we have the basic equation
q ¼ hAðTs TNÞ: With a constant heat ﬂux q0
s, this equation becomes
qs0 ¼ q
A ¼ hðTs  TNÞ
(7.14)
Written for location x, Eq. (7.14) is

Rearranging Eq. (7.15), we get an expression for the surface temperature distribution:
TsðxÞ ¼ TN þ

7.3 Natural convection for ﬂat plates

Determination of TsðxÞ requires an iterative process as the ﬂuid properties are taken at the ﬁlm
temperature, and the surface temperature is unknown at the beginning of the solution. Sparrow and
Gregg [6] recommend that the ﬁlm temperature be deﬁned using the surface temperature at the
midheight of the plate, i.e., at x ¼ L=2: That is, Tf ¼ ½TsðL =2Þ þTN=2:
To start the iterative solution, we guess the surface temperature at x ¼ L=2: We then calculate
TsðL =2Þ using Eq. (7.16) and either Eq. (7.17) or Eq. (7.18). We compare our calculated value with the
guessed value and, if they are different, we iterate again. We continue the iterations until the guessed
value is deemed close enough to the calculated value. Example 7.2 illustrates this procedure.
7.3.2 Horizontal plate

Chapter 7 Natural (free) convection

The upper surface of the plate shown in Fig. 7.3 is called a “hot surface facing upward,” and the
lower surface is called a “hot surface facing downward.” Fluid motion at the two surfaces is quite
different. At the upper surface, the heating of the ﬂuid causes a decrease in the density of the ﬂuid
adjacent to the plate. This results in the rising of a heated plume through the colder ﬂuid above it. If the
temperature difference between the plate surface and the ﬂuid above the plate is great enough, pockets
of heated ﬂuid will be created. These pockets move through the colder ﬂuid above them, causing
considerable movement and ﬂuid mixing. At the lower surface, the heating of the ﬂuid also causes a
decrease in density of the adjacent ﬂuid. The ﬂuid wants to rise, but the plate is in the way. Hence, there
is less motion at the lower surface than at the upper surface. This difference in ﬂuid motion results in a
difference in the convective coefﬁcients for the two surfaces. The rate of heat transfer at the upper
surface is greater than that at the lower surface.
For cold surfaces (i.e., for Ts < TN), the heat transfer of a cold surface facing downward is the
same as that of a hot surface facing upward. And, the heat transfer of a cold surface facing upward is
the same as that of a hot surface facing downward.
For a horizontal surface, the characteristic length is

The following example deals with heating of a warehouse by natural convection from a hot hor-
izontal duct. The example is very similar to Example 6.12. However, in that example there was forced
convection at the outer surface of the duct. Here we have natural convection.
Example 7.4
Heat for a warehouse
Problem
There is a horizontal duct going through a warehouse carrying hot air to the adjacent ofﬁce. The warehouse is unheated,
and we would like to estimate the amount of heat provided from the duct to the warehouse air by natural convection. The
details are as follows:
The duct is 10 inches diameter and the section in the warehouse is 50 feet long. The air enters the warehouse section at a
rate of 1100 cfm and a temperature of 130 F. The air in the warehouse space is at 45 F.
(a) How much heat will be added to the air in the warehouse by natural convection from the outer surface of the duct
(Btu/hr)?
(b) What is the temperature of the air in the duct as it leaves the warehouse?
7.4 Natural convection for cylinders

Solution
We will assume that the duct wall is thin and a constant temperature surface. To get air property values, we need to make
some assumptions on temperatures. We will check these assumptions after the calculations and iterate as necessary. We
will assume that the duct air temperature drops by 10 F from the entrance to the exit. The air then enters at 130 F
(54.44 C) and leaves at 120 F (48.89 C). The average temperature of the air in the duct is (54.44 þ 48.89)/2 ¼ 51.67 C.
We will also assume that the temperature of the duct wall is Ts ¼ 110 F ¼ 43.33 C.
We now proceed to get the convective coefﬁcients hi and ho for the inside and outside surfaces of the duct.
Internal Flow. The air enters at 1100 cfm and 130 F (54.44 C). For air at 54.44 C, r ¼ 1.075 kg/m3. Mass ﬂow rate =

The average duct air temperature is 51.67 C. For air at this temperature,

Let us now check the assumed duct wall temperature by doing an energy balance. The convection at the inner surface of the

Chapter 7 Natural (free) convection

Solving for Ts; we get that the duct wall temperature is 47.12 C ¼ 116.8 F.
Summarizing:. We assumed the duct wall temperature was 110 F and we calculated it as 116.8 F.
We assumed the exit temperature of the duct air was 120 F and we calculated it as 120.5 F.
Although the exit temperature of the duct air was close to our assumption, there was a signiﬁcant different between our
assumption of the duct wall temperature and our calculated value. We should therefore iterate with another assumed duct
wall temperature, say 116 F, and keep the assumed exit temperature of the duct air at 120 F. Looking at the result of this
iteration, we would judge whether or not a further iteration was necessary.
Instead of doing these hand calculations again, let us use Excel Solver to reach a solution, as follows:
We can write three equations for the heat ﬂow q. One is for the convection at the inner surface, one is for the convection at
the outer surface, and the ﬁnal one is for the heat loss from the duct air. The equations are
q ¼ hiAiðTduct air  TsÞ
(a)
q ¼ hoAoðTs  TNÞ
(b)
q ¼ _m cpðDTÞduct air
(c)
We can combine these equations to get two equations for the two unknowns: the duct wall temperature Ts and the exit
temperature of the duct air Tair out:
From Eqs. (a) and (c), we have
hiAiðTduct air  TsÞ ¼ _m cpðDTÞduct air
(d)
From Eqs. (b) and (c), we have
hoAoðTs  TNÞ ¼ _m cpðDTÞduct air
(e)
For solution by Excel Solver, we move everything to the left of the equal sign in Eqs. (d) and (e). Doing this and putting in
the values for parameters, we get
f1 ¼ hiAiðTduct air  TsÞ 
_m cpðDTÞduct air ¼ 0

Excel Solver varies the values of Tair out and Ts until f 2

and (g) have been successfully solved for Tair out and Ts.
The Solver results were Ts ¼ 48:10 C and Tair out ¼ 51:35 C.
The heat ﬂow can be obtained from Eqs. (a), (b), or (c). Using Eq. (c), we have

Results:
(a) The rate of heat added to the warehouse air is 5930 Btu/hr.
(b) The air exits the duct at 51.35 C = 124.4 F. (Note: In the Excel program, we used the original values of the
convective coefﬁcients hi and ho. We assumed this approach was appropriate since the properties of air vary
minimally with temperature in the range of interest. We checked the validity of this approach by developing a more-
complex Excel program which calculated the coefﬁcients directly from Eqs. (6.135) and (7.32). The results of that
program conﬁrmed that use of the original convective coefﬁcients gave excellent results.)
7.4.2 Vertical cylinder
Studies of natural convection from vertical cylinders include those of Sparrow and Gregg [17],
Minkowycz and Sparrow [18], and Cebeci [19]. Let us consider a vertical cylinder of height L and
diameter D. The top and bottom surfaces can be treated as horizontal plates using the equations in
Section 7.3.2. If the curvature of the cylinder is small enough, the outer surface can be considered as

Rayleigh Number. The resulting Eq. (7.38) is more general than Eq. (7.37) and may be used for ﬂuids

Example 7.5
Cooling of a spherical container
Problem
Fig. 7.6 shows a thin-walled spherical container ﬁlled with a mixture of ice and water. There is 50% ice and 50% water by
volume. The container has a diameter of 25 cm, and it is in a room where the air is at 20 C. How long will it take for all of
the ice to melt?
Solution
Heat transfer will primarily be by natural convection from the room air to the container. There will be some radiative heat
transfer to the container, but that should be insigniﬁcant as the temperatures of the problem are low. (We will check this
after we determine the natural convection heat transfer.)
We

The

is
V ¼ ð4 =3Þpr3 ¼ ð4 =3Þpð0:125Þ3 ¼ 0:00818 m3. Therefore the initial volume of the ice is (0.00818) (0.5) ¼ 0.00409 m3.
The density of ice is 916.7 kg/m3, so the initial mass of ice in the container is
mice ¼ riceVice ¼

916:7 kg = m3

The heat of fusion of ice is 333.6 kJ/kg, so the amount of heat needed to melt all of the ice in the container is (333.6 kJ/kg)
 (3.75 kg) ¼ 1251 kJ.
The temperature of the ice/water mixture remains at 0 C while the ice is melting. As the container is thin-walled, we will
assume that the outer surface of the container is at 0 C. The air properties are taken at the ﬁlm temperature:
Tf ¼ ðTs þTNÞ=2 ¼ ð0 þ20Þ=2 ¼ 10 C.

So, for the three correlations, we have h ¼ 3.55, 3.74, and 3.70 W/m2 C. The values differ by a maximum of 5.4%. Let us
use the average of these results for our continuing calculations.
So, h ¼ (3.55 þ 3.74 þ 3.70)/3 ¼ 3.66 W/m2 C.

Therefore, q ¼ (3.66) (0.1963) (200) ¼ 14.37 W ¼ 14.37 J/s.
From above, we need 1251 kJ to melt all of the ice. At a rate of 14.37 J/s, this will take

and the radiative heat transfer is insigniﬁcant compared with the convective heat transfer of 14.37 W.
However, if the outer surface of the container is not highly polished, say ε ¼ 0:5, then the radiative heat transfer will be
10.1 W. The radiative heat transfer is then the same order of magnitude as the natural convection, and it should be included
in the total rate of heat ﬂow into the container.

Chapter 7 Natural (free) convection

7.6 Natural convection for other objects
In this section we discuss two papers that deal with natural convection from a variety of objects.
Sparrow and Stretton [14] performed experiments on cubes in various orientations and obtained a
correlation equation that can be used for bodies of unity aspect ratio such as cubes, spheres, and short
cylinders. We used this equation, Eq. (7.41), for spheres

)0:252
(7.41)
for
200 < RaL < 1.5  109
Sparrow and Stretton believe that this equation can be used for situations having RaL moderately
beyond the above given range; for bodies having aspect ratios deviating slightly from unity; and for all
Prandtl numbers, except, perhaps for liquid metals. They caution that the correlation should not be
used for bodies with aspect ratios deviating signiﬁcantly from unity.
The characteristic length L for Eq. (7.41) is deﬁned by the equations:
L ¼ A
D
and
p ðDÞ2
4
¼ Ahoriz
(7.42)
where A is the surface area of the body and Ahoriz is the projection of the body on a horizontal plane
located either above or below the body. D is an equivalent diameter based on Ahoriz:
Using the deﬁnitions of Eq. (7.42), the characteristic length L for a sphere is pD. For a cube with
its normal orientation, i.e., top and bottom on horizontal planes and sides vertical, L ¼ 3 S
ﬃﬃﬃp
p ,
where S is the length of a side of the cube. For a vertical short cylinder of length S and diameter S,
L ¼ ð3 =2Þ p S. For a horizontal short cylinder of length S and diameter S, L ¼ ð3 =4Þ p3=2 S:
Lienhard [15] considered the predicted and experimental data from vertical plates, cylinders, and
spheres. He proposed the following correlation for natural convection from any submerged isothermal
body for ﬂuids with Prandtl numbers on the order of unity or greater.
Nu ¼ h L
k ¼
0:52 Ra1=4
L
for 104 < RaL < 109
(7.43)
The characteristic length L in Eq. (7.43) is the distance that a ﬂuid particle travels in the boundary
layer as it goes around the object. Some examples of L are shown in Fig. 7.7.
Let us apply Eq. (7.43) to the above Example 7.3 that dealt with heating from a horizontal duct. The
duct is 16
00 wide and 8
00 high, which give a characteristic length of 16" þ 8" ¼ 24" ¼ 0.6096 m. Using
this length, RaL ¼ 4:376  108; Nu ¼ 75.2; and h ¼ 3:26 W

m2 C. This h value gives a heat transfer
rate of 88.2 W/m length of the duct, which is 15% lower than the 103.7 W/m result of Example 7.3
above.
We also can apply Eq. (7.43) to Example 7.5, which dealt with ice melting in a spherical container.
The container has a diameter of 25 cm, which gives a characteristic length of L ¼ pD=2 ¼ pð0:25Þ=2 ¼
0:3927 m. Using this length, we get RaL ¼ 1:469  108; Nu ¼ 57.3; and
h ¼ 3:62 W

m2 C. This
result for h is comparable with the values we obtained in Example 7.5 from the other correlations for
spheres.
Sparrow and Ansari [16] performed experiments on a vertical cylinder with height equal to
diameter. They found that Eq. (7.43) underpredicted the observed heat transfer by 8%e30%,

depending on the Rayleigh number. Sparrow and Stretton [14] performed experiments on a cube in air
and water. They found that Eq. (7.43) underpredicted the experimental data by 4%e23% for the cube
in air and 8%e15% for the cube in water.
7.7 Natural convection for enclosed spaces
Double-glazed windows, solar collectors, and building walls incorporate enclosed rectangular spaces.
Thermos bottles, solar collectors, and storage containers for cryogenic liquids often incorporate
concentric cylinders or spheres. The space between the outer walls of the enclosures is ﬁlled with a
liquid or gas or is evacuated to even further decrease the heat transfer. This section considers natural
convection in such enclosures. Much experimental and theoretical work has been done on natural

convection in enclosed spaces. Catton [25] provided a comprehensive review of the research as of
1978, and many other papers have been written since then, especially due to the increasing interest in
solar collectors. Correlation equations are presented below for some of the common geometries:
rectangular enclosures, annular double-walled cylindrical enclosures, and annular double-walled
spherical enclosures. Many more correlations can be found in research literature.
7.7.1 Enclosed rectangular space
Fig. 7.8 shows a rectangular enclosure. The enclosed space between isothermal walls has a height H
and a width L between the walls. The space is tilted with an angle q from the horizontal. The top and
bottom surfaces of the enclosure are adiabatic. The hot surface is at temperature T1, and the cold
surface is at temperature T2: To clarify the tilt angle: q ¼ 90 is a vertical space. q ¼ 0 is a horizontal
space with cold surface up and hot surface down. q ¼ 180 is a horizontal space with hot surface up
and cold surface down. For 0 < q < 90, the cold surface is up. For 90 < q < 180, the hot surface is
up.
Caution: In the following correlation equations for rectangular enclosures, the characteristic
length to use in calculating the Nusselt, Grashof, and Rayleigh numbers is the thickness of the gap, L,
between the two sides of the enclosure. Do not get confused. In this section, we use L as the gap
thickness and H as the height of the sides. In previous sections, L was the height of surfaces. Just make
sure to use the gap thickness, and not the height, in the calculation of the dimensionless numbers.
The enclosure has two plates enclosing the gaseous or liquid space plus the ends. Let us compare
the basic conduction and convection equations. They are

If the hot plate is at the top, there are no convective currents in the enclosure, and the heat ﬂow through
the ﬂuid is solely by conduction. If the hot plate is at the bottom, convective currents occur when the
Rayleigh number RaL > 1708: For lower values of RaL, the buoyant forces do not overwhelm the
viscous forces in the ﬂuid.

A liquid at 50 C is stored in a double-walled spherical container. The inner sphere is thin-walled and has a diameter of

The properties of the air in the gap are taken at the average temperature Tavg ¼ ð50 þ20Þ=2 ¼ 35 C and 0.5 atm pressure.
Air properties are given in the tables for 1 atm pressure. The thermal conductivity and absolute viscosity are not signif-
icantly affected by pressure. However, the kinematic viscosity is affected as its deﬁnition includes density. The air may
be considered to be an ideal gas. The ideal gas law is P ¼ rRT. This shows that, with a constant temperature, the pressure
is directly proportional to the density. In our case, the pressure has been halved. Therefore, the density at 0.5 atm is half of
the density at 1 atm.

7.8 Natural convection between vertical ﬁns
The addition of ﬁns to a surface enhances the heat transfer for the surface. Fins were discussed in
Chapter 3. However, that chapter only discussed single ﬁns convecting to an open adjacent ﬂuid. This
section discusses ﬁns that are closely spaced. In this situation, the ﬂow ﬁeld in the ﬂuid adjacent to a ﬁn
impacts the ﬂow ﬁeld of the ﬁn next to it. Such interaction affects the convective coefﬁcient for the ﬁns
and hence affects the heat transfer.
In particular, we will be looking at vertical straight rectangular ﬁns on a vertical surface. A picture
of such ﬁns were shown in Fig. 3.27; speciﬁcally, the picture of the ﬁns on the power transformer.
Fig. 7.12 shows three vertical ﬁns attached to a vertical surface. Only three ﬁns are shown, but there
can indeed be many ﬁns on the surface. The ﬁns have thickness t, and the space between the ﬁns is S.
The ﬁns are L high by b wide. The surface to which the ﬁns are attached is L high and W wide.
Elenbaas [27] considered the heat transfer in vertical channels both analytically and experimen-
tally. Bar-Cohen and Rohsenow [28] later provided the following Nusselt Number correlation equation

between ﬁns. Assuming that the two outer surfaces have the same h as the other surfaces should, in
most cases, have insigniﬁcant impact on the result.)

Fins have been added to the vertical wall of a small tank to assist in cooling the liquid inside the tank. Eleven vertical ﬁns
have been added to a square section of the tank wall that is 10 cm by 10 cm. The ﬁns are 0.8 mm thick, 10 cm high, and
2 cm wide. They are equally spaced on the total width of the wall section. The ﬁns are at a temperature of 130 C, and the

The second ﬁn example deals with designing a ﬁn array for removing heat at a speciﬁed rate from a
plate.
Example 7.9
Fins for cooling of electronic components
Problem
Heat-producing electronic components are mounted on one side of a vertical plate. Vertical ﬁns are to be added on the other
side of the plate to increase the convective heat transfer from the plate to the adjacent air. The ﬁns need to remove heat at a
rate of 25 W from the plate. The plate is 8 cm wide and 12 cm high. The ﬁns have a thickness of 1 mm and are 12 cm high
and 4 cm wide. They are equally spaced. The plate and the ﬁns are at 155 C and the adjacent air is at 25 C.
(a) How many ﬁns are needed to remove the speciﬁed heat, and what is the spacing S between them?
(b) If the ﬁns had not been added to the plate, what would have been the natural convection heat transfer rate from the
surface?

For this problem, q ¼ 25 W; b ¼ 0:04 m; L ¼ 0:12 m; and ðTs TNÞ ¼ 155  25 ¼ 130 C.
Putting the values into Eq. (7.72), we get the requirement
h N ¼ 20:03
(7.74)
The convective coefﬁcient h is a function of the spacing S between ﬁns. A spacing that results in a higher convective co-
efﬁcient will require a lesser number of ﬁns to achieve the desired heat transfer q. Let us continue with our analysis:

Chapter 7 Natural (free) convection

Summarizing: There are multiple answers to Part (a) of this problem. We ﬁrst decide how many ﬁns we want. Then we
solve Eq. (7.77) for the required ﬁn spacing that will give us the speciﬁed heat removal rate of 25 W. For example, let us
say that we want 15 ﬁns on the wall. Then N ¼ 15 and Eq. (7.77) becomes

Eq. (7.79) can be solved for spacing S. One way to do this is by using Excel Goal Seek.

We tell Goal Seek to make the left side of Eq. (7.80) zero by changing the value of S. When we did this, we got the result
S ¼ 0.002924 m ¼ 2.924 mm. Using Eq. (7.78), we ﬁnd that the total width of the ﬁn array is 5.3 cm and the ﬁn array will
indeed ﬁt on the 8-cm-wide plate.
We have seen that an array of 15 ﬁns will remove the speciﬁed 25 W from the plate. But there are several possible solutions
to Part (a) of this problem. Indeed, we could have any number of ﬁns from 3 to 25 to remove the speciﬁed heat. We would
just input the number N of the ﬁns into Eq. (7.77) and solve the equation for the needed ﬁn spacing S. We did this for
several numbers of ﬁns and got the results: For 3 ﬁns, the needed spacing is 6.009 mm; for 5 ﬁns, the spacing is
4.398 mm; for 10 ﬁns, the spacing is 3.367 mm; and for 20 ﬁns, the spacing is 2.652 mm. It turns out that 25 ﬁns is
the maximum number of ﬁns that can be used. A greater number of ﬁns give a ﬁn array width that, per Eq. (7.78), is greater
than the width of the plate.

7.9 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed natural (free) convection for a variety of surfaces and enclosures. Much
experimentation and analysis has been done on this topic, and we have provided several equations for
predicting the convective coefﬁcients. One must keep in mind, however, that the correlation equations
come from carefully-controlled laboratory experiments. Laboratory conditions, in most cases, are not
duplicated in practice. Hence, the results from the correlation equations may differ by as much as 25%
or more from results actually obtained in practice. The best situation, of course, would be to obtain

convective coefﬁcients from experimentation on the actual objects of interest. This, however, is usually
not possible due to cost, schedule, and other constraints. Although the results from the correlation
equations are “rough,” they do indeed provide valuable information for conceptual and design
purposes.
We did not include a discussion of combined free and forced convection. In some situations, ﬂuid
ﬂow is such that convection is not entirely natural (free) or not entirely forced. Flow velocities may be
in excess of those caused by the density gradients of natural convection but may not be large enough to
completely overwhelm the effects of the density gradients. In these cases of mixed convection, the
Nusselt Numbers for sole natural convection and sole forced convection have to be combined in some
fashion to accurately model the situation.
In general, combined free and forced convection should be considered if GrL

Combined free and forced convection is discussed in Refs. [29e35].
We now move on to the next chapter that deals with heat exchangers. The chapter is very appli-
cation-oriented and should be of much interest to many of you.
7.10 Problems
Notes:
•
If needed information is not given in the problem statement, then use the Appendix for material
properties and other information. If the Appendix does not have sufﬁcient information, then use
the Internet or other reference sources. Some good reference sources are mentioned at the end of
Chapter 1. If you use the Internet, double-check the validity of the information by using more than
one source.
•
Your solutions should include a sketch of the problem.
•
Caution: Make sure that you use absolute temperatures (Kelvin or Rankine) if the problem
involves radiation.
•
In all problems, unless otherwise stated, the ﬂuid pressure is atmospheric. Gas properties in the
Appendix are at atmospheric pressure. If a problem has a gas at other than atmospheric pressure,
affected properties such as density and kinematic viscosity should be modiﬁed accordingly
through use of the ideal gas law.

9.1 Introduction
The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection, and radiation. We discussed details of
conduction and convection in previous chapters and brieﬂy discussed radiative heat transfer in Chapter
1. We presented the following equation for radiation from a surface at temperature Ts to a large
surrounding enclosure at Tsurr:

Temperatures Ts and Tsurr must be in absolute temperature units (Kelvin or Rankine).
In this chapter, we discuss radiative heat transfer in considerably more detail. Topics covered
include blackbody radiation, radiation properties, radiation shape factors, exchange of radiant energy
between surfaces, and radiation shields.
9.2 Blackbody emission
The surfaces of all objects emit thermal radiation by virtue of their temperature being above absolute
zero. This radiation is emitted as electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of about
0.1e100 mm (1 mm ¼ 106 m ¼ 1 micron). Some other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum are
visible light (about 0.4e0.8 mm), X-rays (about 1011 m to 2  108 m), microwaves (about
1 mme10 m), and radio waves (about 10 me30 km). Unlike conduction and convection, which
require a medium for their transport, radiation is transported unhindered through a vacuum. Air,
oxygen, and nitrogen are also essentially transparent to radiation. Some other gases, however, (e.g.,
water vapor, carbon dioxide, and some hydrocarbon gases), have appreciable absorption of radiation in
speciﬁc wavelength regions. We will not be considering radiation transport through these latter types
of gases.
The wavelength l of the radiation is related to the frequency y of the radiation by the speed of
light co:
co ¼ ly
(9.2)
where co ¼ 2:9979  108 m

s in a vacuum.
A “blackbody” has a surface that emits radiation at the maximum possible rate. The emission is
over all wavelengths and is given by Planck’s law, which is

k ¼ Boltzmann’s constant ¼ 1.38065  1023 J=K
Ebl ¼ spectral emissive power of a blackbody
The spectral emissive power is the rate of thermal emission per unit surface area per unit wave-
length. If the wavelength of the radiation is in mm, then the units of the spectral emissive power are W/
(m2 mm).

Putting in the values for the various parameters, Eq. (9.3) can be expressed as

(9.4)
where C1 ¼ 3:7417 108ðW=m2
$ðmmÞ4 and C2 ¼ 1:4388  104 mm$K.
The blackbody spectral emissive power is shown in Fig. 9.1 for blackbodies having temperatures of
300 K, 1000 K, and 5800 K. The 300 K curve is for bodies at typical room temperature and the 5800 K
curve approximates the emission from the sun.
The spectral emissive power of a blackbody given in Eq. (9.4) is a function of both the wavelength
of the radiation and the absolute temperature of the blackbody. The blackbody emits over all wave-
lengths. If we integrate spectral emissive power Ebl over all wavelengths, we get the total emissive
power Eb which is a function of only the temperature T of the blackbody.

We have used the adjectives “spectral” and “total”. “Spectral” is for a parameter that depends on
the wavelength. A parameter with “total” is independent of wavelength.

9.2 Blackbody emission
345

Looking at Fig. 9.1, it is seen that the maximum (or peak) emission from a blackbody occurs at
lower wavelengths for higher temperatures. For 5800 K, the peak emission is at about 0.5 mm. For
1000 K, it is at about 3 mm. And, for 300K, it is about 9 mm. This is Wien’s displacement law, which is
lmaxT ¼ 2898 mm$K
(9.6)
where lmax is the wavelength of peak emission.
Using Eq. (9.6), we get the following wavelengths of peak emission that we previously estimated
by looking at Fig. 9.1:
For 5800 K; lmax ¼ 2898=5800 ¼ 0:500 mm
For 1000 K; lmax ¼ 2898=1000 ¼ 2:90 mm
For 300 K; lmax ¼ 2898=300 ¼ 9:66 mm
This shifting of wavelengths with temperature causes the “greenhouse effect” We have all been in
hot, uncomfortable cars and rooms on hot, sunny days. This is primarily due to the transmissivity
property of window glass. Glass has high transmission at the low wavelengths of solar radiation
(5800 K blackbody) and very low transmission at the higher wavelengths of the 300 K radiation inside
the car or room. The solar radiation easily goes through the glass into the inside air space, but it cannot
leave the space through the essentially opaque glass. The temperature of the space increases to a very
uncomfortable level if air conditioning is not provided.
We have seen that blackbody emission depends on wavelength and temperature. Sometimes we are
interested in ﬁnding the emissive power from a blackbody for a given wavelength band. This can be
determined by integrating the spectral emissive power over the wavelength range. For example, if we
want the total emissive power for a blackbody at temperature T for the wavelength band l1 tol2, we have
Ebðl1 / l2; TÞ ¼
Z l2
l1
Eblðl; TÞdl
(9.7)
If we want the fraction of the radiation emitted by a blackbody that is in wavelength band l1 to l2,
we have the total emissive power for the wavelength band divided by the total emissive power for all
wavelengths. That is,
Fl1/l2 ¼
R l2
l1 Eblðl; TÞdl
R N
0 Eblðl; TÞdl
(9.8)
where Fl1/l2 is the fraction of blackbody emission that is in wavelength range l1 to l2. From the
StefaneBoltzmann Law, the denominator is equal to sT4, so Eq. (9.8) may be written as
Fl1/l2 ¼
R l2
l1 Eblðl; TÞdl
sT4
(9.9)
Using Eq. (9.4), Eq. (9.9) becomes

Example 9.1
Blackbody emission in a wavelength band
Problem
What fraction of the emission from a blackbody at 5800 K lies in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., in
the range from 0.4 to 0.8 mm?
Solution
There are different ways to solve this problem. We will ﬁrst solve it using Table 9.1.
The fraction in the band from l1 ¼ 0:4 mm to l2 ¼ 0:8 mm is F0/l2T  F0/l1T
l1T ¼ ð0:4Þð5800Þ ¼ 2320
l2T ¼ ð0:8Þð5800Þ ¼ 4640
From Table 9.1; F0/l2T ¼ 0:5850 and F0/l1T ¼ 0:1245
Fraction ¼ F0/l2T  F0/l1T ¼ 0:5850  0:1245 ¼ 0:4605
46.1% of the radiation from a blackbody at 5800 K lies in the wavelength band from 0.4 to 0.8 mm.
This problem can also be solved without using Table 9.1. For example, the quad function of Matlab can be used to deter-
mine the integral in Eq. (9.10) directly. For this problem, we have
Fl1/l2 ¼
R l2


(Note that the periods for element-by-element operations are needed in the Matlab statement.)
The result is S ¼ 0.07907, which, using Eq. (9.14), gives the same result as we got using Table 9.1.
F0:4/0:8 mm ¼ ð5:8314Þð0:07907Þ ¼ 0:461
Excel could also have been used to determine the integral in Eq. (9.14). Indeed, the spreadsheet could have been pro-
grammed to determine the integral using, for example, Simpson’s rule. Such programming, however, is a bit involved,
and this is a study of heat transfer, not computer programming. Therefore, we will determine the integral in an alternative
way, as follows:
Open an Excel spreadsheet. Our wavelength limits are 0.4e0.8. Using an increment of 0.02, we put the wavelength
values in Column A, cells A1 through A21. In Column B, we put the values of the integrand in Eq. (9.14) corresponding
to the wavelength values of Column A. The integrand values are in cells B1 through B21. We highlight Columns A and B
and do Insert of a scatter chart. Clicking on the plot area, using the Layout tab, we Insert a trendline of a polynomial of
order 3. We click the appropriate boxes to display the trendline equation and the R-squared value on the chart.
Doing this, we got the trendline equation y ¼ 3:5663x3  7:3632x2 þ 4:7057x  0:7328 and an R-squared value of
0.9991, which showed that the third order polynomial was an excellent ﬁt for the integrand. We chose the polynomial
form as a polynomial is easy to integrate by hand. Integrating the integrand function, we get

In conclusion, the same result was obtained using Table 9.1, Matlab, and Excel.

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

9.3 Radiation properties
In this section, we deﬁne the following radiation properties: emissivity (or “emittance”), reﬂectivity (or
“reﬂectance”), absorptivity (or “absorptance”), and transmissivity (or “transmittance”).
The surface of an ideal blackbody absorbs all radiation that hits it and emits the maximum possible
radiant energy. A real surface emits less than a black surface at the same temperature. The total
emissivity ε of a real surface is the ratio of the emissive power E of the surface to the emissive power
Eb of a black surface at the same temperature. The emissivity of a black surface is 1. The emissivity of
real surfaces is less than 1.
Total Emissivity ¼ εðTÞ ¼ EðTÞ
EbðTÞ ¼
R N
0 Elðl; TÞdl
R N
0 Eblðl; TÞdl
(9.15)
This is the “total” emissivity of the surface as the emissive powers have been integrated over all
wavelengths. The spectral emissivity of the surface is the ratio of the spectral emissive power of the
real surface to the spectral emissive power of a black surface for the same wavelength l and same
temperature T. That is,
Spectral Emissivity ¼ εlðl; TÞ ¼ Elðl; TÞ
Eblðl; TÞ
(9.16)
Fig. 9.2 shows the spectral emissive powers for black, gray, and real surfaces at 2000 K. The gray
surface in the ﬁgure has an emissivity of 0.6. For a real surface at a given temperature, the emissivity
varies with wavelength. For a gray surface, which is an idealization like the black surface, the
emissivity does not vary with wavelength. The spectral emissive power of a gray surface at all
wavelengths is a constant fraction of the emissive power of the black surface at the corresponding
wavelength. That is,
For a gray surface: Elðl; TÞ ¼ ε Eblðl; TÞ
(9.17)
where emissivity ε is a constant.

9.3 Radiation properties
349

Fig. 9.3 shows radiation hitting an object. The incident radiation ﬂux is G (W/m2). Some of the
incident radiation is reﬂected from the surface, some is absorbed by the body, and some might be
transmitted through the object.
The reﬂectivity r is the fraction of incident radiation that is reﬂected. The absorptivity a is the
fraction of incident radiation that is absorbed. And, the transmissivity s is the fraction of incident
radiation that is transmitted through the object. Therefore, if the incident ﬂux is G, the amount rG is
reﬂected, aG is absorbed, and sG is transmitted. The energy balance is
G ¼ rG þ aG þ sG
(9.18)
Factoring out G, we have
1 ¼ r þ a þ s
(9.19)
The radiation properties in Eq. (9.19) are “total” properties, i.e., properties for all wavelengths. Eq.
(9.19) could also be written for speciﬁc wavelengths. If Gl is the incident radiation ﬂux at wavelength
l, the corresponding equations for Eqs. (9.18) and (9.19) are
Gl ¼ rlGl þ alGl þ slGl
(9.20)
and 1 ¼ rl þ al þ sl
(9.21)
If no radiation is transmitted through the object, the object is said to be “opaque” and trans-
missivities s and sl are zero.
We now discuss Kirchoff’s law, which relates the emissivity and absorptivity of a surface. Let us
put a small object inside a black enclosure that is at temperature T. When thermal equilibrium is
reached, both the object and the enclosure are at temperature T. For this equilibrium, the object’s
emission at a given wavelength must equal the radiation the object absorbs at that wavelength. That is,
El ¼ alGbl
(9.22)
where Gbl is the incident radiation on the object from the walls of the black enclosure.
From Eq. (9.16), the spectral emissive power of the object is El ¼ εlEbl so Eq. (9.22) becomes
εlEbl ¼ alGbl
(9.23)
If the object inside the enclosure is a blackbody, then El ¼ Ebl and al ¼ 1 as a black surface
absorbs all incident radiation. Eq. (9.22) becomes
Ebl ¼ Gbl

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

Putting Eq. (9.24) into Eq. (9.23), we arrive at
εlðl; TÞ ¼ alðl; TÞ
(9.25)
The spectral emissivity of a surface at a given wavelength and temperature equals the spectral
absorptivity of the surface at the same wavelength and temperature.
For a gray surface, deﬁned above, radiation properties are independent of wavelength. For such a
surface, Eq. (9.25) becomes
εðTÞ ¼ aðTÞ
(9.26)
Eq. (9.26) is also valid when the incident and emitted radiation have the same spectral distribution.
Example 9.2
Equilibrium temperature of a plate
Problem
Sunlight is incident on one side of a thin metal plate at the rate of 800 W/m2. The other side of the plate is perfectly insu-
lated. The plate has an absorptivity of 0.85 for solar wavelengths and 0.1 for long wavelengths. The air adjacent to the plate
is at 15 C, and the surroundings are also at 15 C. The convective coefﬁcient at the plate’s surface is 20 W/m2 C. What is the
equilibrium temperature of the plate?
Solution
Given: asolar ¼ 0:85, along ¼ 0:1, and G ¼ 800 W = m2.
As radiation is involved, we need to use absolute temperature units.
Therefore, TN ¼ Tsurr ¼ 15 C ¼ 15 þ 273.15 ¼ 288.15 K.
For equilibrium, an energy balance on the plate gives: Energy Flux In ¼ Energy Flux Out
Energy Flux In ¼ radiant energy absorbed by the plate ¼ asolarG
Energy Flux Out ¼ convection to surrounding air þ radiation to surroundings
Energy Flux Out ¼ ðT  TNÞ þ εs

The emission from the plate surface is at long wavelengths, so we have ε ¼ εlong, and by Kirchoff’s Law, Eq. (9.25),

asolarG ¼ hðT  TNÞ þ alongs

Eq. (9.29) can be solved for the plate temperature T by trial and error, Matlab’s fzero function, or Excel’s Goal Seek. The
plate temperature is found to be 321.1 K ¼ 47.9 C.
So far, we have discussed “spectral” radiation properties and “total” radiation properties. Spectral
properties are wavelength-dependent. Total properties are wavelength-independent and are obtained
by integrating the spectral property over a wavelength range. Total emissivity was deﬁned in Eq.
(9.15). Total absorptivity is deﬁned as

where al is the spectral absorptivity.
Gl is the spectral distribution of the incident radiation (W/m2 mm).
Total reﬂectivity and transmissivity are deﬁned similarly.

Radiation properties can also be directional, varying with the direction of the radiation to and from
a surface. For example, we can have “normal” emission or reﬂection in a direction normal, or
perpendicular, to a surface. There are also “hemispherical” radiation properties, with the properties
integrated over the hemisphere from the surface, that is, in all directions from or to the surface. In this
text, we will not consider directional characteristics of radiation. We will assume that radiation is
hemispherical. For example, when we use the symbol εl, we mean the hemispherical spectral
emissivity and when we use ε, we mean the hemispherical total emissivity. Typical hemispherical
emissivities for various surfaces are given in Appendix F.
9.4 Radiation shape factors
Radiative heat transfer between surfaces will be discussed in the next section. However, before doing
so, we must discuss the Radiation Shape Factor, also called the Angle Factor, View Factor, or
Conﬁguration Factor.
Radiation leaves surfaces by both emission and the reﬂection of incident radiation. Reﬂection from
a surface can be specular, like reﬂection from a mirror, or diffuse with reﬂection over all directions. Or,
it can be partially specular and partially diffuse. We will assume that both emission and reﬂection from
a surface is diffuse, with radiation leaving a surface over all the angles of a hemisphere.
In determining the transfer of radiation between surfaces, one major factor is the portion of the
radiation leaving a surface that is intercepted by the other surface. This is a geometric factor that
depends on the relative orientations of the two surfaces and their sizes. The radiation shape factor
Fij is deﬁned as the fraction of radiant energy leaving Surface i that hits Surface j directly.
Sometimes determination of shape factors is quite easy. For example, if two inﬁnite parallel plates
(Plates 1 and 2) are exchanging radiation, then F12 ¼ 1 and F21 ¼ 1 as all the radiation from one
plate will hit the other plate. As another example: Say we have two inﬁnitely long concentric cylinders
and we have radiation between the outer surface of the inner cylinder (Surface 1) and the inner surface
of the outer cylinder (Surface 2). All of the radiation from Surface 1 will hit Surface 2 and F12 ¼ 1:
9.4 Radiation shape factors
353

However, not all of the radiation from Surface 2 will hit Surface 1 as some of the radiation from
Surface 2 will hit Surface 2. Therefore, F21s1: The actual value of F21 depends on the diameters of
the cylinders.
More complex shape factors are obtained through double integration over the two involved sur-
faces. Figs. 9.4e9.7 give radiation shape factors for parallel rectangles, perpendicular rectangles with
a common edge, parallel coaxial disks, and concentric cylinders.
Table 9.2 gives the relations that were used to generate Figs. 9.4e9.7.
There is another item that needs to be discussed before we consider radiative transfer between
surfaces, as follows:
Let us say we have two surfaces, i and j, which are exchanging radiation. There is a relationship
between the areas of the surfaces and the respective shape factors of the surfaces. This relationship,
called the reciprocity theorem, is
AiFij ¼ AjFji

Problem
Determine the shape factor F14 for the Surfaces 1 and 4 in the following sketch:

Solution
Fig. 9.5 is for perpendicular rectangles with a common edge, so it cannot be applied directly to our problem as Surfaces 1
and 4 do not have a common edge. However, the ﬁgure can be used along with shape factor algebra to determine the
desired shape factor.
From the deﬁnition of shape factor, F14 is the fraction of radiation from Surface 1 that hits Surface 4 directly. The fraction
of radiation from Surface 1 that hits the vertical surface of Surfaces 3 and 4 is F1ð3þ4Þ, which is equal to the fraction of
radiation from Surface 1 that hits Surface 3 plus the fraction of radiation from Surface 1 that hits Surface 4. That is,
F1ð3þ4Þ ¼ F13 þ F14
(a)
Rearranging; we get F14 ¼ F1ð3þ4Þ  F13
(b)
To determine F14, we need to get the shape factors on the right side of Eq. (b). These shape factors are not for surfaces
sharing a common edge. Therefore, Fig. 9.5 cannot be used directly to get them. However, through shape factor algebra,
we can convert Eq. (b) into an equation that has only the unknown factor F14 and shape factors that can be obtained from
Fig. 9.5.
Note that Eqs. (a) and (b) do not contain the areas of the surfaces. Such is not the case if a surface comprised of more than
one surface radiates to a single surface. For example, let us consider the radiation from the combined surface of Surfaces 3
and 4 to Surface 1. That is, we want Fð3þ4Þ1:
Multiplying Eq. (a) by the area A1 of Surface 1, we get
A1F1ð3þ4Þ ¼ A1F13 þ A1F14
(c)
From reciprocity,
A1F1ð3þ4Þ ¼ Að3þ4ÞFð3þ4Þ1
(d)
A1F13 ¼ A3F31
A1F14 ¼ A4F41
Substituting Eq. (d) into Eq. (c), we have
Að3þ4ÞFð3þ4Þ1 ¼ A3F31 þ A4F41
(e)
That is, the radiation from Surfaces 3 and 4 to Surface 1 equals the radiation from Surface 3 to Surface 1 plus the radiation
from Surface 4 to Surface 1.
Following Eq. (e), we have, for the radiation from Surfaces 3 and 4 to Surfaces 1 and 2,
Að3þ4ÞFð3þ4Þð1þ2Þ ¼ A3F3ð1þ2Þ þ A4F4ð1þ2Þ
(f)
358
Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

Similarly, for the combined horizontal Surfaces 1 and 2 radiating to surface 4, we have
Að1þ2ÞFð1þ2Þ4 ¼ A1F14 þ A2F24
(g)
Also,
F2ð3þ4Þ ¼ F23 þ F24
(h)
Substituting F24 from Eq. (h) into Eq. (g), we have
Að1þ2ÞFð1þ2Þ4 ¼ A1F14 þ A2

F2ð3þ4Þ  F23

(i)
Rearranging Eq. (f), we have
A4F4ð1þ2Þ ¼ Að3þ4ÞFð3þ4Þð1þ2Þ  A3F3ð1þ2Þ
(j)
Because of reciprocity, the left sides of Eqs. (i) and (j) are equal. Hence, we can equate the right sides of the equations,
which gives
A1F14 þ A2

F2ð3þ4Þ  F23

¼ Að3þ4ÞFð3þ4Þð1þ2Þ  A3F3ð1þ2Þ

F14 ¼ 1

(l)
All of the shape factors in Eq. (l) are for two surfaces having a common edge. Hence, Fig. 9.5 can be used for their
evaluation.
In summary: Through the use of shape factor algebra, we have been able to obtain an expression for the desired F14 in
terms of shape factors that can be evaluated using Fig. 9.5.
Looking at the ﬁgure for this problem, A1 ¼ 18; A2 ¼ 30; A3 ¼ 12; and Að3þ4Þ ¼ 24:
ForshapefactorFð3þ4Þð1þ2Þ using Fig. 9.5, a ¼ 8; b ¼ 6; c ¼ 4: c=b ¼ 0:6667; a=b ¼ 1:3333; and Fð3þ4Þð1þ2Þ ¼ 0.27
from the ﬁgure. The other shape factors, from Fig. 9.5, are F3ð1þ2Þ ¼ 0:35; F2ð3þ4Þ ¼ 0:19; and F23 ¼ 0:13.
Putting these values into Eq. (l), we get

9.5 Radiative heat transfer between surfaces
Let us now discuss the radiation coming into a surface and the radiation leaving a surface. The
incoming radiation is irradiation G and the outgoing radiation is radiosity J. The surface is named
“Surface i.”
Gi ¼ irradiation ¼ rate at which radiation is incident on surface i per unit surface area
The radiation leaving a surface consists of two parts: the portion of the incident radiation that is
reﬂected from the surface and the radiation emitted by the surface. That is,
Ji ¼ riGi þ εiEbi
(9.32)
where Ji ¼ radiosity of surface i.
Gi ¼ irradiation of surface i.
ri ¼ reﬂectivity of surface i.
εi ¼ emissivity of surface i.
Ebi ¼ blackbody emissive power of surface i ¼ s T4
i .

ðEbi  JiÞ
(9.37)
Let us look again at Eq. (9.33):
qi ¼ AiðJi  GiÞ
(9.33)
We would like to get Gi in terms of Ji: Let us consider the enclosure of N surfaces shown in
Fig. 9.8. The N surfaces are exchanging radiant energy with each other. (It should be mentioned that
these surfaces do not need to be solid surfaces. Some could be open or closed windows through which
radiation passes. If such is the case, these windows would be assigned equivalent blackbody
temperatures corresponding to the rate of radiation going through them.)
Let us look at the radiant interactions for one of the surfaces of the enclosure, i.e., the interactions
for surface i.
In Section 9.4, we discussed radiation shape factors. Shape factor Fij is the fraction of radiant
energy leaving surface i that hits surface j. We assume that radiation from a surface is diffuse and the
radiation leaves a surface over the entire hemisphere. Fig. 9.9 shows three different types of surfaces:
ﬂat, convex, and concave. If a surface is ﬂat or convex, none of the radiation leaving it will return to hit
the surface. However, if a surface is concave, some of the radiation leaving the surface will hit the same
surface. That is, for ﬂat or convex surfaces, Fii ¼ 0. For concave surfaces, Fiis0.

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

There is a very useful relation between the shape factors of the surfaces of an enclosure, as follows:
Radiation leaving a surface of an enclosure will hit all of the surfaces of the enclosure that have a
nonzero shape factor with the surface sending out the radiation. That is, if the enclosure has N surfaces,
and Surface i is sending out the radiation, the relation is
Fi1 þ Fi2 þ Fi3 þ / þ FiN ¼ 1
Using the summation symbol, this relation is P
N
j¼1
Fij ¼ 1.
Let us now look at the radiation coming into and leaving one of the surfaces of the enclosure. From
previous deﬁnitions, Gi is the rate at which radiant energy is incident on Surface i per unit area of
surface, and Ji is the rate at which radiant energy leaves Surface i per unit area of surface. Surface i has
a surface area of Ai. Therefore, GiAi is the rate at which radiation is incident on Surface i.
Consider the enclosure of N surfaces. Surface i gets radiation from the other surfaces and, if
concave, can get radiation from itself. From the deﬁnition of radiosity, the rate of radiation leaving
Surface 1 is J1A1, and, from the deﬁnition of shape factor, the rate at which the radiation from Surface
1 hits surface i is J1A1F1i . Therefore, looking at radiation coming in from all N surfaces of the
enclosure to surface i, we have
GiAi ¼ J1A1F1i þ J2A2F2i þ J3A3F3i þ / þ JNANFNi

Using the summation symbol, Eq. (9.38) is

Eqs. (9.43) and (9.37) may be written for all N surfaces of the enclosure. We have N equations
from Eq. (9.43) and N equations from Eq. (9.37). These 2N simultaneous equations may be solved for
the N qi; s and the N Ji; s.
We could decrease the number of simultaneous equations from 2N to N by doing the following:
each surface has two equations for q: Eqs. (9.37) and (9.43). If we equate the right sides of these
equations, we get N equations for the Ji: After we solve the N equations and get the Ji, we can then use
either Eq. (9.43) or Eq. (9.37) to get the heat ﬂows qi:

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

Example 9.6
Radiant heat transfer for a cubical storage container
Problem
A thin-walled cubical container that is 0.5 m by 0.5 m by 0.5 m is ﬁlled with ice water. The container is inside another
cubical container and the 3 cm gap between the containers is a vacuum. The outer surface of the inner container has
an emissivity of 0.1 and a temperature of 1 C. The inner surface of the outer container has an emissivity of 0.3 and a
temperature of 19 C.
(a) What is the rate of heat transfer to the ice water?
(b) If the container initially contains 1/2 ice and 1/2 water by volume, how long will it take for all the ice to be melted?
Solution
This is a two-surface radiation problem. Let Surface 1 be the outer surface of the inner cube and Surface 2 be the inner
surface of the outer cube.
A1 ¼ ð6Þð0:5Þ2 ¼ 1:5 m2
A2 ¼ ð6Þ½0:5 þ 2ð0:03Þ2 ¼ 1:8816 m2
ε1 ¼ 0:1 and T1 ¼ 1 C ¼ 274.15 K ε2 ¼ 0:3 and T2 ¼ 19 C ¼ 292.15 K
(a) All of the radiation leaving the inner cube will hit the outer cube. Therefore F12 ¼ 1.
Hence, Eq. (9.49) is the appropriate equation for this two-surface problem.

The minus sign for q1 means that the heat ﬂow is into Surface 1, that is, into the ice water.
The rate of heat transfer to the ice water is 11.73 W.
(b) The volume of the container is (0.5 m)3 ¼ 0.125 m3. The volume of the ice is half of this or 0.0625 m3.

m1ce ¼

916:7 kg=m3
0:0625 m3
¼ 57:3 kg
The heat of fusion of ice is 333.6 kJ/kg, so the amount of heat needed to melt all of the ice in the container is (333.6 kJ/kg)
x (57.3 kg) ¼ 19115 kJ.
From Part (a), q ¼ 11:73 W ¼ 11:73 J=s.
The time need to melt all the ice is

¼ 1:630  106 s 

It will take about 19 days to melt all the ice.
An alternative way to get equations to solve for the radiosities and heat ﬂows is to write nodal equations using the electrical
circuit diagram. We assume that heat ﬂows are directed into the nodes, and the sum of the heat ﬂows into a node has to
equal zero for steady state. Looking at Fig. 9.10, we have the following equations for nodes J1 and J2:

Eq. (9.46) or Eq. (9.47) may be used to get q2: When the heat ﬂow from one surface is known, it is easy to get the heat ﬂow

By energy conservation, the rate of heat ﬂow from Surface 1 is equal to the rate of heat ﬂow to Surface 2. Hence, the bot-

Heat transfer from a radiant heater
Problem
A radiant heater on the ceiling of a factory is used to heat a work table directly under it. Both the heater and table top are
2 m by 2 m. The heater is at 500 C and has an emissivity of 0.9. The table top is at 30 C and has an emissivity of 0.5. The
temperature of the factory is 15 C. The distance between the heater and the table top is 3.6 m.
(a) What is the required power output of the radiant heater?
(b) What is the radiant heat ﬂux received by the table top?
Solution
This is a three-surface problem. Surface 1 is the heater; Surface 2 is the table top; and Surface 3 is the factory environment.

9.5.2.4 Three-surface enclosure with an insulated surface
Sometimes surfaces of an enclosure are perfectly insulated on their back side. For these surfaces, the
energy incident on the surface is equal to the energy leaving it. That is, the irradiation G equals the
radiosity J. As shown by Eq. (9.33), the heat loss q from the surface is zero. This adiabatic surface is
also called a reradiating or refractory surface.
If surface i is the adiabatic surface, then Gi ¼ Ji: The deﬁnition of radiosity Ji is
Ji ¼ ð1 εiÞGi þ εiEbi. As Gi ¼ Ji, it follows that Ji ¼ Ebi ¼ sT4
i for the adiabatic surface.

perfectly insulated surface.

Radiant heat transfer for a truncated cone with an insulated surface
Problem
A truncated cone has a height of 4 cm. The closed bottom of the cone has a diameter of 4 cm, a temperature of 800 C, and
an emissivity of 0.8. The top surface has a diameter of 3.5 cm and is open to a large room that is at 25 C. The side wall of

9.6 Radiation shields
Sometimes we want to decrease the radiant heat transfer between two surfaces. This can be done by
inserting a thin sheet of material between the two surfaces. The material can be in the form of a plate,
cylinder, sphere, or any other shape appropriate to the surfaces being affected. Usually, the added sheet
has low emissivities on its two surfaces. The inserted sheet is called a radiation shield. Multiple layers
of shields are used in insulations for cryogenic ﬂuid containers. Shields are also used to improve the
accuracy of temperature measurement. For example, say we are measuring the temperature of a gas
ﬂowing through a pipe. If the temperature of the pipe wall is different from that of the gas, the
measured gas temperature may be signiﬁcantly in error due to radiative transfer between the pipe wall
and the temperature sensor. Placing a radiation shield between the sensor and the pipe wall will reduce
the measurement error.
Let us look at a couple of examples that illustrate the effectiveness of radiation shields in
decreasing radiant transfer between surfaces.
Fig. 9.13 shows a radiation shield between two large plane surfaces. The left surface (Surface 1)
has a temperature T1 and an emissivity ε1: The right surface (Surface 2) has temperature T2 and
emissivity ε2: The radiation shield has emissivity ε31 on its side facing Surface 1 and emissivity ε32 on
its side facing Surface 2.

Let us look at the impact of the radiation shield on the radiative transfer between Surfaces 1 and 2.
The heat transfer from Surface 1 to Surface 2 without the shield in place is given by Eq. (9.51).

After T3 is determined, the heat ﬂow for the system can be obtained from Eq. (9.69).
If there are multiple radiation shields, equations like Eq. (9.69) can be written between adjacent
shields and the resulting equations can be solved simultaneously for the temperatures of the shields.
Then one of the heat ﬂow equations can be used to get the heat ﬂow through the system.

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

Another way to get the heat ﬂow is through use of the electrical circuit for the system. The circuit
has resistances in series as the heat ﬂow is the same through all segments of the system. Fig. 9.10
showed the circuit diagram for radiative transfer between two surfaces. There are two surface
resistances and one space resistance. Addition of a radiation shield between the surfaces adds two
surface resistances and one space resistance to the diagram. The resulting circuit for one radiation
shield is shown in Fig. 9.14. If there are more than one shield between the end surfaces, additional
surface and space resistances can be added to the circuit for the additional shield(s).
We can use this circuit diagram like we previously used an electrical circuit diagram when we
discussed conduction through composite materials. Using the circuit diagram of Fig. 9.14, the heat
ﬂow is the overall difference in potential (i.e., difference in emissive power Eb1  Eb2 ¼ s

divided by the sum of the resistances between Eb1 and Eb2. That is,

Let us say we want to ﬁnd the temperature T3 of the shield. The heat ﬂow is the same through all

circuit of Fig. 9.14. Therefore, if we want the temperature of the shield, we can write an equation
between the unknown potential Eb3 and one of the known end potentials (Eb1 or Eb2). For example,

Radiant heat transfer for a parallel plate system with a radiation shield
Problem
Two large parallel plates are exchanging radiation. One plate has a temperature of 1000 K and an emissivity of 0.8. The
other plate is at 350 K and has an emissivity of 0.4.
(a) What is the radiant heat ﬂux between the plates?
(b) It is desired to reduce the heat transfer between the plates by inserting a thin radiation shield between them. The
shield has an emissivity of 0.1 on one side and 0.05 on the other. What is the new rate of heat transfer after the shield
is in place, and what is the temperature of the shield?
(c) An additional shield like the one of Part (b) is placed in the system to further reduce the heat transfer. What is the
resulting heat ﬂux, and what are the temperatures of the two shields?

For the two-shield system, the heat ﬂux is 919 W/m2 and the shield temperatures are 955.6 and 776.5 K.
To summarize:
Without radiation shields, the heat ﬂux between the two plates is 20310 W/m2. With one shield, the heat ﬂux is 1760 W/
m2. With two shields, the heat ﬂux is 919 W/m2.
It is seen that use of one shield greatly decreases the heat ﬂux. Use of an additional shield further decreases the heat ﬂux but
not to as great an extent as achieved by the ﬁrst shield.
We mentioned at the beginning of this section that radiation shields are effective in increasing the
accuracy of temperature measurements in certain situations. Example 9.11 illustrates this.
Example 9.11
Radiation shield for temperature sensor
Problem (a)
A thermocouple is used to measure the temperature of hot air ﬂowing through a large duct. The emissivity of the thermo-
couple is 0.6 and the duct walls are at a temperature of 500 K. The convective coefﬁcient at the thermocouple’s surface is
100 W/m2 C. The thermocouple indicates an air temperature of 1025 K. What is the actual temperature of the air?

Chapter 9 Radiation heat transfer

Solution (a)
From an energy balance on the thermocouple at steady state:
The heat gained by convection from the air equals the heat lost by radiation to the duct walls. That is,

Solving this we get Tair ¼ 1379 K.
The actual air temperature is 1379 K, but the thermocouple indicates a temperature of 1025 K. This difference of 354 K is
due to the duct walls being at a much lower temperature than the air There is radiative transfer from the thermocouple to
the duct walls, thereby lowering the thermocouple’s temperature. The relatively high emissivity of the thermocouple also
contributes to the large difference between the measured and actual air temperature.
Problem (b)
A thin cylindrical shield is placed over the thermocouple to shield the thermocouple from the duct walls. The shield has an
emissivity of 0.1 on both of its surfaces, and the convective coefﬁcient is 50 W/m2 C on both surfaces of the shield. Deter-
mine the effect of the shield on the accuracy of the thermocouple reading.

We will realistically assume that the surface area of the thermocouple is very small compared with the inner surface area of

Use of the radiation shield reduced the thermocouple error from 354 to 98 K. This is a very signiﬁcant improvement.

9.7 Sky radiation and solar collectors
Radiant emission from the sun has a spectral distribution similar to that of a blackbody at about
5800 K. The sun radiates about 3.8  1023 kW of energy, of which about 1.7  1014 kW is intercepted
by the earth. At the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere, the solar irradiance, at normal incidence, is
about 1360 W/m2. This is called the “Solar Constant.” As the radiation goes through the atmosphere,
its intensity is decreased due to absorption and scattering by gases, particulates, and water vapor. On
clear, sunny days, the solar insolation at the surface of the earth can be as high as about 1000 W/m2. It
is much lower on cloudy or smoggy days.
Let us now brieﬂy discuss solar collectors. A solar collector will typically have a cover plate in
contact with the environment and an absorber plate deeper within the device. We want as much
radiation as possible to enter the collector and the least possible amount to leave it. For the cover plate,
therefore, we want high transmittance for solar radiation and a low transmittance for radiation at the
infrared wavelengths of the collector. Fortunately, several plastics and glasses have these character-
istics, including polycarbonate, plexiglass, clear low-iron oxide glass. For ﬂoat glass and tempered
glass, the solar transmittance is about 0.8 and the infrared transmittance is estimated at 0.2 [1].
For the absorber plate, we want high absorptance and low emittance. This is often achieved by
putting coatings on the absorber plates. One very good coating is black chrome on copper,
aluminum, or stainless steel. This coating has an absorptance of about 0.87 and an emittance of
about 0.08. The coating must be commercially applied. However, there are spray coatings avail-
able, which can be applied by the user, which also have high absorptance and low emittance. One
might think that ﬂat black paint would be a very good coating for an absorber plate. Such is not the
case. Indeed, the paint has a high absorptance (about 0.95), but it unfortunately also has a high
emittance (about 0.9) [1].
In predicting the performance of solar collectors and systems, it is necessary to have data on the
amount of solar radiation reaching a particular location. Such data are available from the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. One of its publications [2] gives the solar radi-
ation incident on many US cities. The publication gives incident solar radiation (kWh/m2/day) for
several types of solar collectors: ﬂat-plate collectors (ﬁxed, 1-axis tracking, 2-axis tracking) and
concentrating collectors. As an example for New York City, for a ﬁxed ﬂat-plate collector facing south,
the average solar radiation is 1.6 kWh/m2 for a day in December and 6.0 kWh/m2 for a day in June.
We have mentioned scattering and absorption of solar radiation by gases and particulates. Such
materials also emit radiation. The spectral emission is unlike blackbody radiation, but it is often useful
to treat the atmosphere as a blackbody having a temperature called the “effective sky temperature.”
This temperature depends on parameters such as altitude, humidity, cloud coverage, and particles in
the air such as dust and pollution. The sky temperature is lower than the air temperature at the earth’s
surface. The sky temperature is typically between about 230 and 290 K. The lower temperatures are
for cold, cloudless conditions while the higher temperatures are for warm, cloudy conditions.
Discussion of an interesting (and fun) phenomenon closes this chapter. The author has observed ice
in the street in the morning when the air temperature overnight has been above freezing. This can be
explained by radiative heat transfer. The phenomenon is illustrated in Example 9.12.

Water freezing in street
Problem
There are shallow puddles of water in the street during daytime. At night, the average air temperature is 5 C and the effec-
tive sky temperature is 250 K. The convective coefﬁcient between the water and the air is 10 W/m2 C and the emissivity of
the water surface is about 0.95. Will the water freeze overnight?
Solution
For equilibrium:
Heat into the water by convection from the air ¼ heat out of the water by radiation to the sky

9.8 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
In this chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of radiation heat transfer. We ﬁrst considered emission
from blackbodies. We looked at the wavelength distribution of the emission as given by Planck’s law.
We discussed Wien’s law and its importance with respect to the “greenhouse effect.” We deﬁned
radiation properties (emissivity, reﬂectivity, absorptivity, and transmissivity), irradiation, radiosity, and
the gray body. We discussed radiation shape factors that are used in determining the radiant heat
transfer between surfaces. We covered radiant exchange between gray, diffuse surfaces of an enclo-
sure, with special emphasis on two- and three-surface enclosures. We also observed the usefulness of
electrical circuit diagrams in determining the equations for such radiant exchange. We discussed the
use of radiation shields to decrease radiative transfer between surfaces. Finally, we brieﬂy discussed
sky radiation and solar collectors.
In short, we covered a lot of material. However, there are more-advanced topics of radiation heat
transfer that were not covered. These include the angular dependence of radiation properties, radiative
exchange for specular surfaces, gaseous radiation, and radiation transmission through media that
absorb and scatter radiation. Information on these topics may be obtained from the references in the
"Further reading" section at the end of the chapter.

10.1 Introduction
Like essentially all heat transfer texts, the organization of this text is segmental. The ﬁrst chapter is
general, and presents an introduction to heat transfer and its three modes: conduction, convection, and
radiation. Next are three chapters concentrating on conduction. There are two later chapters on
convection, and then a chapter on radiation. This organization is very good from a pedagogical
viewpoint. However, concentrating on a single mode at a given time is not very realistic. Most
problems involve more than one mode of heat transfer, and these modes act simultaneously. For
example, heat transfer through a building wall involves conduction through the wall, convection at the
surfaces of the wall, and sometimes radiation from the wall surfaces, all acting together.
At the time of the early chapters on conduction, the details of convection had not yet been
discussed. Therefore, values of convection coefﬁcients had to be given in the problem statements.
Examples and problems in this chapter are designed to be much more realistic, and convective
coefﬁcients are not provided. Indeed, for real engineering problems, an engineer has to determine the
convective coefﬁcients by his/her self. If quick, approximate answers are sufﬁcient, the engineer can
use estimates based on prior experience. If more accurate results are needed, then the appropriate
equations can be used to determine the coefﬁcients. At this point in the text, the reader has the
capability to determine convective coefﬁcients by his/her self. Problems can be more like “real world”
problems.
The problems in this chapter involve multiple modes of heat transfer. The reader has to determine
which modes of heat transfer are relevant for a given problem. He/she also has to somehow obtain any
needed information that is lacking in the problem statement. In addition, a decision must be made on
the method to be used for the solution of the problem.

Good engineers are resourceful and persistent. This chapter should enhance the reader’s problem-
solving abilities. It should also increase the reader’s conﬁdence in being able to solve heat transfer
problems. Finally, the examples and problems in this chapter should provide the reader with a
worthwhile review of material covered earlier in the book.
10.2 Procedure for solution of multimode problems
In solving the problems, the following questions must be answered:
What modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, and/or radiation) are signiﬁcant?
If convection is signiﬁcant, is it natural convection or is it forced convection?
Is the problem steady-state or transient?
Does the problem statement contain all necessary information? If not, where will the missing
information be obtained?
How should the problem be solved? Should it be solved analytically or numerically? Does the
problem involve differential equations? Does the problem involve simultaneous equations? What
software, if any, should be used in the solution?
After these questions are answered, the solution can proceed in earnest.
10.3 Examples
The following eight examples each incorporate more than one mode of heat transfer. The examples are
based on earlier examples and problems in this book. At the time they were earlier discussed,
concentration was focused on one speciﬁc mode of heat transfer. For example, Chapters 2, 3, and 4
dealt with conduction. For problems in these chapters involving convection boundary conditions, the
values of the convective coefﬁcients were givens in the problems. Now, with the experience of
Chapters 6 and 7, the reader has the ability to determine convective coefﬁcients by his/her self. There is
no need for the convective coefﬁcients to be given.
The below examples involve the solution of nonlinear simultaneous equations. We have found that
Microsoft Excel’s Solver add-in is very useful. (This add-in program comes with Excel. It just has to be
enabled.) Sometimes convergence depends on the initial guesses of the variables. However, we have
found Solver to be successful in almost all situations. We have provided details regarding the Excel
spreadsheets used in the solution of the examples. We have also provided listings of the Matlab
programs used for solution of some of the examples.
Property information was needed for the determination of forced and natural convective
coefﬁcients for air. In particular, we needed the temperature variation of air’s thermal conductivity,
kinematic viscosity, and Prandtl number. We took tabular data for these parameters and ﬁt the data to
polynomial functions. This was done through use of Excel spreadsheets. Tabular data were input to
the spreadsheet, scatter charts were inserted, and polynomial trendlines and equations were obtained.
We found that third-degree polynomial ﬁts were excellent for thermal conductivity and kinematic

viscosity. A fourth-degree polynomial was needed to accurately ﬁt the data for the Prandtl number.
The obtained equations were:

Cylindrical heater
Problem
A horizontal electric cylindrical heater has an output of 50 W. The heater has a diameter of 4 cm and a length of 30 cm.
The ends of the cylinder are insulated so all of the heat output leaves through the cylindrical side of the heater. The heater is
in a large room whose walls are at 30 C, and the room air is at 20 C. The surface of the heater has an emissivity of 0.5.
(a) What is the temperature of the surface of the heater?
(b) What are the respective heat ﬂows by convection and radiation from the surface of the heater?

Solution
Preliminary: There is convection and radiation at the surface of the cylinder. The convection is natural convection. We have
steady state. All necessary information is given. The heater output equals the convection and radiation from the surface.

Because radiation is involved, temperatures must be in absolute temperature units. Eqs. (10.2), (10.4), (10.6) will be used
for the properties of air.

We can use a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for the solution. In particular, we can use Excel’s Goal Seek program. Rearrang-

Putting the various constants and parameters into this equation and getting convective coefﬁcient h from Eq. (7.32), we
have a function that only depends on the unknown surface temperature Ts: If function f1 equals zero, we have a solution.
In the spreadsheet, we give a guess for the value of Ts: Goal Seek iterates on this value until a value that satisﬁes f1 ¼ 0 is
hopefully obtained. We now give a detailed description of the Excel spreadsheet. Readers uninterested in the details can go
directly to the end of this description for the results.

Calling up Goal Seek, we tell it to change cell B1 until cell F1 is zero. Convergence is reached, and the value in B1
becomes 404.977 K. Cell B16 is checked, and its value is within the appropriate limits for Eq. (7.32). The values
in Cells B20 and B21 are, respectively, the heat ﬂows by convection and radiation. The value in B20 is 30.28 and
the value in B21 is 19.72.
(a) The temperature of the surface of the cylinder is 405.0 K ¼ 131.9 C.
(b) The convective heat ﬂow at the surface is 30.28 W, and the radiative heat ﬂow at the surface is 19.72 W. When the
program is executed, the values are found in cells B20 and B21, respectively.
Note: In Chapter 3, we discussed combined convection and radiation from a surface. We deﬁned a radiative coefﬁcient hrad
that could be added to the convective coefﬁcient h to obtain a combined coefﬁcient hcombined ¼ h þ hrad. This combined
coefﬁcient could then be used to get the total heat transfer from the surface. That is q ¼ hcombinedAðTs TNÞ. Eq. (3.35)
deﬁned the radiative coefﬁcient as hrad ¼ εs

This technique of combining the convective and the radiative coefﬁcients gives exact results if TN ¼ Tsurr. It can
be applied when TNsTsurr, but there will be some error. In this problem, TN and Tsurr were different. Speciﬁcally,
TN ¼ 20 C and Tsurr ¼ 30 C. We modiﬁed the above Excel program slightly to solve the problem using the
combined-coefﬁcient approach and got results very close to the above exact results. The surface temperature was
401.8 K, the convective heat transfer was 29.26 W, and the radiative heat transfer was 20.74 W.

Liquid nitrogen container
Problem
A spherical liquid nitrogen container has a diameter of 1.5 m. The container is thin-walled and is surrounded by another
thin-walled hollow sphere of diameter 1.6 m. The spheres are of stainless steel and have an emissivity of 0.2. The space
between the spheres is evacuated. The container is in a room where the room air and the room enclosure are at 22 C. The
temperature of the liquid nitrogen is 77 K and the heat of vaporization of nitrogen is 200 kJ/kg.
(a) What is the rate of heat transfer to the liquid nitrogen?
(b) If a two-inch-thick layer of ﬁberglass insulation (k ¼ 0.036 W/m C) is added to the outside of the outer sphere,
what is the new rate of heat transfer to the liquid nitrogen? Assume that the emissivity at the outer surface of the
insulation is 0.85.
(c) Was the addition of the ﬁberglass insulation worthwhile? Consider the evaporation rate of the liquid nitrogen in your
answer.

Preliminary: There is radiation between the two spheres. There is convection between the outer surface of the outer sphere

There are two unknowns in this problem: T2 and T3: Excel’s Goal Seek cannot be used for solution as that program is only
suitable for one unknown. However, Excel’s Solver add-in program can handle more than one unknown and we will use it
for our solution. Looking at Eq. (10.15), we can create two functions that must be zero for a solution. First, we have
q1 ¼ q2, which leads to the function
f1 ¼ q1  q2 ¼ 0
(10.21)
We can also create a second function f2 from the equation q1 ¼ q3 þ q4.
f2 ¼ q1  q3  q4 ¼ 0

Both f1 and f2 need to be zero for a solution. This requirement will be satisﬁed if f 2

Calling up Solver, we tell it to change cells B2 and B3 until cell F3 is zero. F3 does not reach zero, but it is very small and
we conclude that an acceptable solution is reached. Convergence is reached. The values in B24 and B25 become 198.0,
and the sum of B26 and B27 is 198.0. (A minus value means the ﬂow is into the liquid nitrogen.) Cells B20 and B17 were
checked and found to be within the appropriate limits for Eq. (7.40).
With the insulation, the heat transfer into the liquid nitrogen is 198.0 W.
Part (c). As noted in the problem statement, the heat of vaporization of liquid nitrogen is 200 kJ/kg.
Without insulation, the heat input to the LN2 is 300.2 W or 300.2 J/s. The evaporation rate of the LN2 is
300.2 J = s  ð1 kg = 200; 000 JÞ  ð3600 s = hÞ  ð24 h = dayÞ ¼ 129.7 kg=day
With insulation, the heat input drops to 198.0 W and the evaporation rate is
ð198.0 = 300.2Þð 129.7Þ ¼ 85.5 kg=day
The addition of the insulation reduces the evaporation rate of the nitrogen by about 1/3. We conclude that addition of the
insulation was worthwhile.

Cooling of a copper cube
Problem
A copper cube (k ¼ 375 W/m C, r ¼ 8950 kg/m3, c ¼ 385 J/kg C) is 2 cm by 2 cm by 2 cm. It is initially
uniform at 200 C in an oil bath. The cube is taken out of the bath and suspended by wires in the 20 C room air. The
emissivity of the cube’s surface is 0.05. How long will it take for the temperature of the cube to drop to 50 C?

Solution
Preliminary: This is a transient problem. The temperature of the cube changes with time. The cube is of high conductivity
and is also quite small. Therefore, it appears that the lumped method would be appropriate. We will assume this and then
check the lumped Biot number at the end of the solution to see if our assumption was correct. There is convection and
radiation from the surface of the cube. No information was given as to an air ﬂow rate, so we will assume that the
convection is natural convection. Lacking information about the room, we will assume it is a large room and that the tem-
perature of the surroundings is the same as the temperature of the room air. As radiation is involved, temperatures must be
in absolute units. Eqs. (10.2), (10.4), (10.6) will be used for the properties of air.
S ¼ side of the cube ¼ 0.02 m A ¼ surface area of the cube ¼ ð6Þð0:02Þ2 ¼ 0:0024 m2
V ¼ volume of the cube ¼ ð0:02Þ3 ¼ 8  106 m3
TN ¼ Tsurr ¼ 20 þ 273.15 ¼ 293.15 K
ε ¼ 0:05
We are assuming that the lumped technique is appropriate. The energy word equation for the cooling of the cube is
Rate of decrease in internal energy of the body ¼ Rate of heat ﬂow from the body by convection and radiation
This equation is presented mathematically by Eq. (4.3) for only convection. Modifying Eq. (4.3) to include radiation gives

T4  T4


(10.23)
where T is the temperature of the cube at time t
r; c; and V are the density; specific heat; and volume of the cube
A is the surface area of the cube
Solution of the differential equation of Eq. (10.23) will give the temperature T of the cube at a given time t. Unfortunately,
the equation is nonlinear due to h and the T4 term, and it cannot be readily solved analytically. We will therefore solve it
numerically, as follows:
Dividing both sides of Eq. (10.23) byrcV, we get

We can solve this numerically, working forward in time, by changing dt to a ﬁnite time step Dt and changing dT to a ﬁnite
temperature difference DT. Eq. (10.24) then becomes

(10.25)
We pick a time step Dt and then iterate using Eq. (10.25) over and over. Each time we iterate, we are moving forward in
time by an amount Dt. The right side of Eq. (10.25) is recalculated and the temperature Tof the cube changes by an amount
DT: The value of h changes at each iteration as h is a function of T. For each iteration, DT ¼ Tnew  Told, so Eq. (10.25)
could be written as
Tnew ¼ Told 

The h-value should be a combined h for convection and radiation. The largest coefﬁcient for convection during the process
was 10.6 W/m2 C. The radiative heat transfer is much smaller than the convective heat transfer during the process, so the
combined h is not much greater than the h for convection. We will conservatively say it is 20 W/m2 C.

Excel can also be used to perform iterations, but it is a little tricky. First, we have to shutoff automatic calculation and
change it to manual calculation. On the main screen, click the “Formulas” tab, then go to “Calculation Options” and check
“Manual.” This menu also has a “Calculate Now” button that we will use later to run the program.
We also have to enable iterative calculations. Click the Microsoft button in the upper left corner of the main screen and
then click “Excel Options” in the bottom of the window. Click “Formulas” on the left panel, and then click “Enable iter-
ative calculation.” Enter the number of desired iterations in the “Maximum Iterations” box.
The Excel spreadsheet is given below. The operation of the program is controlled by the A1 cell in conjunction with the B2
cell. To run the spreadsheet, we ﬁrst enter the number of desired iterations as outlined above. Then enter “1" in cell A1 and
click “Calculate Now.” Because of the IF statement in cell B2, this will cause the initial value of the cube’s temperature
(473.15) to be placed in cell B2. Then go back to cell A1 and place “¼A1þ1” in it and click “Calculate Now.” This will
cause the program to iterate the number of times set in the “Maximum Iterations” box. For each iteration, the time goes
forward an amount dt. After the iterations are done, the ending temperature of the cube will be in cell B2. We can do
another set of iterations, continuing working forward in time, by clicking “Calculate Now” again. (Note: During this pro-
cess you will probably get a “Circular Reference” warning. This is due to cell A1 referencing itself. Nothing is wrong. We
want the circular reference.)

(b) Rigid polyethylene insulation is installed on the pipe. The insulation is 3/4 inch thick. What is the new rate of heat
transfer to the room? What is the % reduction in heat transfer due to the insulation?

Preliminary: There is forced convection at the inner surface of the pipe. There is convection to the room air at the outer
surface of the pipe. We will assume this is natural convection as no information was given as to any air ﬂow across the pipe.
We will assume that there is also radiation from the outer surface of the pipe to the room enclosure. The pipe is very long,
so we will assume it is horizontal and we will assume that the room is large. As no information was given as to the tem-
perature of the room enclosure, we will assume that the room surroundings are the same temperature as the room air. We
have steady state. We need information as to the inside and outside diameters of the pipe, the conductivity of the pipe, and
the emissivity of the outer surface of the pipe. We have series heat ﬂow. Convection from the water to the pipe equals
conduction through the pipe. In addition, these heat transfers are equal to the sum of the convection and radiation from
the pipe’s outer surface to the room. As radiation is involved, temperatures must be in absolute units. Eqs. (10.2),
(10.4), (10.6) will be used for the properties of air.
From an internet search, the OD of a 2 inch Sch 40 pipe is 60.3 mm and the ID is 52.6 mm. Therefore,
r1 ¼ 0:0263 m and r2 ¼ 0:03015 m. The conductivity of galvanized pipe is about 43 W/m C. A reasonable value for
the emissivity of the outer surface of the pipe is 0.6.

The volumetric ﬂow rate of the water is 10 gpm. The density of water at 90 C is 965.3 kg/m3.
The mass ﬂow rate of the water is therefore 10 gal/min x (1 m3/264.17 gal)  (1 min/60 s)  (965.3 kg/m3) ¼

There are two unknowns in this problem: T1 and T2. Once these are obtained, the heat ﬂows can be calculated. We will use
Excel’s Solver program for the solution.
From Eq. (10.30), we create two functions which must be zero for the solution. These functions are
f1 ¼ q1  q2 ¼ 0 and f2 ¼ q1  q3 ¼ 0
(10.34)
(Note: There is ﬂexibility in choosing the functions. For example, we could have used q2  q3 as one of the functions. We
just need two functions that include all three heat ﬂows among them.)
Solver needs a single criterion for solution. Our criterion is f 2

2 ¼ 0: If this is zero, then both functions will be zero.
We give initial guesses for T1 and T2: Solver performs iterations on these values until f 2

cannot reach zero, but it can reach very close to zero. The Excel spreadsheet for the solution is as follows:

Preliminary: From an Internet search, the polyethylene insulation has a conductivity of about 0.037 W/m C. We will as-
sume that the emissivity of the outer surface of the insulation is the same as that of the bare pipe, i.e., 0.6. We have steady-
state and series heat ﬂow. Convection from the water to the pipe equals conduction through the pipe, which equals the
conduction through the insulation, which equals the convection plus radiation from the outer surface of the insulation.
As radiation is involved, temperatures must be in absolute units. Eqs. (10.2), (10.4), (10.6) will be used for the
properties of air.

There are three unknowns in this problem: T1; T2; and T3. Once these are obtained, the heat ﬂows can be calculated. We
will use Excel’s Solver program for the solution.
The energy conservation equation is Eq. (10.35).
q1 ¼ q2 ¼ q3 ¼ q4
(10.35)
We have three unknowns. From Eq. (10.35), we create three functions that must be zero for the solution. We chose the
functions
f1 ¼ q1  q2 ¼ 0
f2 ¼ q3  q4 ¼ 0
and
f3 ¼ q1  q4 ¼ 0
(10.40)
(Note: There is ﬂexibility in choosing the functions, but we need to include all four heat ﬂows somewhere in the three
functions.)
Solver needs a single criterion for solution. Our criterion is f 2
1 þ f 2
2 þ f 2
3 ¼ 0: If this is zero, then all three functions will be
zero.
We give initial guesses for T1; T2; and T3: Solver performs iterations on these values until f 2

Heat transfer through a building wall
Problem
A wall of a building is 8 feet high and 15 feet wide. It consists of 1/2 inch thick plasterboard ðk1 ¼ 0:173 W=m CÞ, 3½
inch thick ﬁberglass insulation ðk2 ¼ 0:039 W=m CÞ, and 9/16 inch thick T-111 siding ðk3 ¼ 0:115 W=m CÞ. The air
inside the house is quiet at 72 F. Outside the house, the air is at 35 F, and it is blowing horizontally across the siding
at 10 miles per hour. What is the rate of heat transfer through the wall?

Preliminary: There is natural convection at the inside surface of the wall and forced convection on the outside surface. We
will assume that radiation is insigniﬁcant. The heat transfer is steady state. Composite walls were considered in Chapter 3.
We will use the resistance concept from that chapter to solve the problem. Eqs. (10.2), (10.4), (10.6) will be used for the
properties of air. These equations are for air temperatures being in Kelvin degrees.
The applicable equation is Eq. (3.18):
q ¼ DToverall
P R
(3.18)
For this problem, the overall temperature difference is the difference between the inside and outside air temperatures.
There are ﬁve resistances: three conductive resistances for the wall layers and two convective resistances for the inner
and outer surfaces of the wall. For a layer, the resistance is L
kA, where L is the thickness of the layer, k is the conductivity
10.3 Examples
409

of the layer, and A is the cross-sectional area through which the heat ﬂows. For the convection, the resistance is 1
hA, where h
is the convective coefﬁcient. Hence, for this problem, the heat ﬂow through the wall is, from Eq. (3.18),

Looking at Eq. (10.42), we see that we need convective coefﬁcients h1 and h4 to determine the heat ﬂow through the wall.
These convective coefﬁcients depend on their respective ﬁlm temperatures. Hence, we need to determine T1 and T4: There
is no need to determine interface temperatures T2 and T3. The resistance concept will be used to obtain equations for the
surface temperatures as follows:

The convective coefﬁcients h1 and h4 are functions of T1 and T4; respectively. Eqs. (10.45) and (10.46) are solved
simultaneously for T1 and T4. In doing so, the values of h1 and h4 are obtained. The rate of heat transfer through the
wall may then be determined from any one of several of the above equations.
An appropriate equation for the forced convection coefﬁcient h4 on the outside surface of the wall is Equation (6.92).

The characteristic length L is the length of the wall in the direction of ﬂow. We have L ¼ 15 feet ¼ 4.572 m.
The Reynolds number in Eq. (10.47) is ReL ¼ uNL

ðT4 þTNoÞ=2. The other properties of air in the equation are also taken at the ﬁlm temperature. The free-stream
velocity is uN ¼ 10 miles per hour ¼ 4.47 m=s.

and turbulent boundary layers. The results of the analysis will conﬁrm that this is the case for this problem.
As mentioned above, there are two unknowns in this problem: T1 and T4. Once these are obtained, the heat ﬂow through
the wall can be calculated. We will use Excel’s Solver program for the solution.

We also solved this problem using Matlab. We used the GausseSeidel method (see Appendix J). Eqs. (10.45) and (10.46)

changed the range of the looping. We kept increasing the range until the values of T1 and T4 were the same as those
of the previous run. It was found that convergence was quick. Only about ﬁve loops were needed. The Matlab results
were the same as the Excel results.

Preliminary: There is convection from the ﬁn to the surrounding air. For Part (a), the convection is natural; for Part (b), it is
forced. There is also radiation from the ﬁn surface to the surroundings. Lacking any info to the contrary, we will assume
that the temperature of the surroundings is the same as the room air. The heat transfer is steady state. We will do a numer-
ical analysis with the nodes as shown in the accompanying ﬁgure. As radiation is involved, we will work with temperatures

temperatures being in Kelvin degrees.

The nodal spacing is Dx ¼ L=4 ¼ ð50 cmÞ=4 ¼ 12:5 cm ¼ 0.125 m.

We have a steady-state problem. In developing nodal equations, we will assume that all heat ﬂows are into the node. We
will sum the heat ﬂows and set the sum to zero.
Node 1 has a surface area in contact with the room air of pDðDx =2Þ. Summing up all the heat ﬂows into Node 1 and setting
the sum to zero, we have the nodal equation for Node 1:

There are ﬁve unknowns in these equations: qbase; T2; T3; T4; and T5: But qbase is only in one of the equations,
Eq. (10.51). Hence, we can solve Eqs. (10.52) through (10.55) simultaneously for the four temperatures and then
use Eq. (10.51) to get qbase:
The solution could be performed with Excel Solver as we have done for previous examples in this chapter. The expressions
in Eqs. (10.52) through (10.55) each become functions f2 through f5: Guesses are made for the temperatures
T2 through T5: Solver then changes the temperatures until P

i ¼ 0: We have used Solver for this problem and have
obtained a solution. For variety, we have decided to outline a different solution technique, the GausseSeidel method.
This method was used in Chapter 5 for linear equations. We will use it here for our nonlinear equations. The process is
as follows:
Rearrange Eqs. (10.52) through (10.55) so that one temperature is on the left side of the equal sign. For Eq. (10.52), T2 will
be on the left. For Eq. (10.53), T3 will be on the left, similarly for T4 and T5: The T4 terms can stay on the right side of the
equal signs.
Doing this, Eqs. (10.52) through (10.55) become

A Matlab program was used for the GausseSeidel solution. In the program, initial guesses are given for the unknown tem-
peratures T2 through T5: The program then loops through Eqs. (10.56)e(10.59). Each time a loop is executed, the values
of the temperatures are updated. When the changes between the temperatures from one loop to the next become small
enough, the program has converged to the solution. It was found that this method did indeed converge, and the convergence
was quite quick. Having the solution for the temperatures, Eq. (10.51) above was used to get the rate of heat transfer qbase
from the ﬁn to the room air and surroundings.
Part (a) deals with natural convection from the ﬁn. An appropriate equation for the convective coefﬁcient is Eq. (7.32):

The solution for Part (a), natural convection, was

T3 ¼ 355:13 K;
T4 ¼ 335:65 K;
T5 ¼ 329:62 K;
and

The solution for Part (b), forced convection, was
T2 ¼ 362:63 K;
T3 ¼ 318:97 K;
T4 ¼ 302:27 K;
T5 ¼ 297:83 K;
and
qbase ¼ 59:85 W
The heat transfer from the ﬁn is 35.4 W for natural convection and 59.9 W for forced convection with an air velocity of
2 m/s across the ﬁn. As expected, the heat transfer for forced convection is greater than that for natural convection.

Temperature measurement
Problem
Air is ﬂowing at a rate of 1000 cfm through a 1600 by 1200 duct. A sensor in the center of the ﬂow measures the temperature
of the air. The sensor is a sphere of 3 mm diameter. Its surface has an emissivity of 0.4. The measured temperature is
120 F. If the duct walls are at 250 F, what is the actual temperature of the air?

T = ?
Solution
Preliminary: There is convection between the sensor and the ﬂowing air. There is radiation between the sensor and the duct
wall. The convection is forced convection over a sphere. The heat transfer is steady state.
The temperature of the temperature sensor is Tts ¼ 120 F ¼ ð120  32Þð5=9Þ ¼ 48.89 C ¼ 322.0 K.
The temperature of the duct wall is Tduct ¼ 250 F ¼ ð250  32Þð5=9Þ ¼ 121:11 C ¼ 394.3 K.
An appropriate equation for the forced convection is Whitaker’s equation, Eq. (6.111):

where ﬂuid properties are at the ﬂuid temperature except for ms which is at the surface temperature. We will assume that the
ﬂuid temperature is close to the sensor temperature. Then mszm and the viscosity ratio factor in Eq. (6.111) can be deleted.
(Note: The solution will conﬁrm that this is appropriate.) Fluid properties will be taken at 50 C.

Environmental test chamber
Problem
An environmental test chamber is cylindrical in shape. The inside dimensions are as follows: The top and bottom are
0.5 m diameter and the height is 0.8 m. There is a vacuum in the chamber during tests. An electrical heater below
the chamber keeps the bottom surface of the chamber at 150 C. The sidewall of the chamber is well-insulated. The
top of the chamber is a door that can be opened to move specimens in and out of the chamber. The door is 1.5 cm
thick and of a material whose thermal conductivity is 15 W/m C. All three interior surfaces of the chamber have an
emissivity of 0.88. The outside surface of the door has an emissivity of 0.75. There is convection from the outside
surface of the door to the 20 C room air. There is also radiation from the outside surface of the door to the 25 C
surroundings.
For steady-state operation of the chamber,
(a) What are the temperatures of the surfaces of the door and the temperature of the sidewall?
(b) How much power must the electric heater deliver to the chamber to keep the bottom surface of the chamber at
150 C?

Eqs. (4) and (5) have convective coefﬁcient h4. This is for natural convection from the upper surface of the door. The
surface is a hot surface facing up, so an appropriate relation for h4 is Eq. (7.24).

kair, vair, air Pr are given by Eqs. (10.2), (10.4), (10.6)
Eqs. (1) through (5) are solved simultaneously for the unknowns J1; J2; J3; T2; and T4:
Unfortunately, the results of both Excel Solver and Matlab (GausseSeidel solution method) did not converge acceptably.
Convergence for these methods sometimes depends on the initial guesses for the unknowns. For this problem, we were
unsuccessful in choosing initial guesses leading to convergence. Due to the non-convergence, we took the following
alternative approach:
First we assumed a temperature for the outer surface of the door, T4: With this temperature and the given TN, we calculated
convective coefﬁcient h4 using Eq. (7.24). Then we calculated the heat ﬂow q to the environment using
q ¼ h4A4ðT4  TNÞ þ ε4sA4

But this heat ﬂow is also the conduction through the door q ¼ kdoorA4
Ldoor ðT2 T4Þ. Rearranging, we have T2 ¼ T4 þ qLdoor
kdoorA4.
After we calculate T2, we can calculate Eb2 ¼ s T4

Looking back at the last circuit diagram, it is seen that the heat ﬂow from the bottom surface of the chamber to the bottom
of the door is

(7)
The heat ﬂow in Eq. (7) equals the heat ﬂow in Eq. (6). We try different values of T4 until both heat ﬂows are equal. When
that happens, we have the solution. The following Matlab program loops for a range of T4 values and gives a result of the
T4 value that makes the two heat ﬂows as equal as possible. The program also gives T2 and q:
The results for this problem were q ¼ 98:29 W; T2 ¼ 339:81 K; and T4 ¼ 339:31 K
We also need the temperature of the sidewall, T3: The calculations are as follows:

10.5 Problems
Notes:
•
If needed information is not given in the problem statement, then use the Appendix for material
properties and other information. If the Appendix does not have sufﬁcient information, then use
the Internet or other reference sources. Some good reference sources are mentioned at the end of
Chapter 1. If you use the Internet, double-check the validity of the information by using more than
one source.
•
Your solution should include a sketch of the problem.
•
It is strongly recommended that the reader spend some time (in some cases perhaps as little as a
few minutes) to give some thought to the problem before immediately jumping into its solution.
Draw the sketch. Consider the questions of Section 10.2. Determine what additional information
is needed and think about where it can be obtained. Determine what sections and equations of the
text are relevant. Consider the possible solution techniques and choose one. This time in
preparation will indeed be time well-spent and will lead to efﬁcient and successful solution of the
problem.

11.1 Introduction
This chapter deals with diffusion mass transfer. There are several types of processes that involve mass
transfer. Flow of a ﬂuid through a pipe certainly transfers mass. Blowing a gas over a surface for
cooling or heating purposes entails mass transfer of the gas. And, currents created near a surface due to
natural convection is also mass transfer. However, these types of mass transfer are macroscopic and are
not the focus of this chapter. In this chapter, we discuss several topics relevant to diffusion mass
transfer. This is mass transfer caused by concentration gradients in a material. We will start the chapter
by presenting terminology relevant to concentrations in gas mixtures.

11.2 Concentrations in a gas mixture
Let us consider a box that contains two different species of gas. One gas, Gas A, is in the left half of the
box. The other gas, Gas B, is in the right half of the box. The gases are at the same pressure and
temperature and are separated by an impervious partition. When the partition is removed, Gas A starts
to move into the Gas B part of the box, and Gas B starts to move into the Gas A part of the box. The
diffusion of the gases continues until the mixture of the gases is homogeneous and there are no
concentration gradients in the mixture.
Let us now look at a mixture of two or more species in a container. The concentration of each
species may be expressed as a mass concentration or a molar concentration. The mass concentration of
species i is the mass density ri with units of kg/m3. The molar concentration is Ci with the units of
kmol/m3. A “kmol” is a kilogram-mole, which is the amount of gas in kilograms that is numerically
equal to the molecular weight Mi of the gas. For example, 1 kmol of oxygen ðO2Þ is 32 kg; 1 kmol of
nitrogen ðN2Þ is 28 kg; and 1 kmol of argon ðArÞ is 39.95 kg.
From the deﬁnition of kilogram-mole, the density of species i of the mixture is
ri ¼ MiCi
(11.1)
For a gaseous mixture, the mass fraction of species i, mfi, is
mass fraction ¼ mfi ¼ mi
m ¼ ri
r
(11.2)
where
mi is the mass of species i
m; is the total mass of the mixture.
The mole fraction of species i in a gaseous mixture is
mole fraction ¼ yi ¼ ni
n
(11.3)
where
ni is the number of kmoles of species i
n is the total number of kmoles in the mixture.
Many common gases can be considered to be ideal gases. If all the gases in a mixture are ideal
gases, and the mixture itself is an ideal gas, we can use Dalton’s law to relate the partial pressure
fractions of the individual gases to the mole fractions. Let us assume that each gas is in its individual
container of volume Vand that all the gases are at the same pressure P and temperature T. The gases are
then combined into a container of volume V. The resulting mixture of gases is at pressure P and
temperature T.
For the mixture; we have PV ¼ nRT
(11.4)
where
n ¼

ni ¼ number of kmoles in the mixture
P ¼ pressure of the mixture ðkPaÞ
V ¼ volume of the mixture

T ¼ absolute temperature of the mixture ðKÞ

Chapter 11 Mass transfer

Eq. (11.4) can be written for each of the individual species. That is,
PiV ¼ niRT
(11.5)
where Pi is the partial pressure of species i.
Summing Eq. (11.5) for all the gases in the mixture, we have
X

V ¼


RT
(11.6)
Comparing Eq. (11.6) with Eq. (11.4), we have
P ¼
X
Pi
(11.7)
That is, the pressure of the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual species. And,
using Eq. (11.3), (11.4), (11.5), we see that the mole fraction yi of species i is the ratio of the partial
pressure of species i to the pressure of the mixture.
That is; yi ¼ ni
n ¼ Pi
P
(11.8)
Let us now use Amagat’s law and look at the volume fraction Vi=V of the different gases that form
the mixture. Each individual gas is in its own container of volume Vi; and all of the gases are at the
same pressure P and temperature T. The gases are then combined into a container of volume V. The gas
mixture is at the same pressure and temperature as the individual gases had before they were
combined.
For each species; before combination; we have PVi ¼ niRT
(11.9)
For the mixture; we have PV ¼ nRT
(11.10)
Dividing Eq. (11.9) by Eq. (11.10), we have
Vi
V ¼ ni
n
(11.11)
In summary, for each species of an ideal gas mixture, the volume fraction, the mole fraction, and
the ratio of the partial pressure to the total pressure of the mixture are equal.

11.3 Fick’s law of diffusion
At the beginning of the previous section, we considered a partitioned box with Gas A in the left side of
the box and Gas B in the right side. When the partition is removed, Gas A migrates toward the right
side and Gas B migrates toward the left side. For Gas A, a concentration gradient occurs, which causes
the gas to diffuse toward the right. This gradient, during the process after removal of the partition, is
shown in Fig. 11.1. It is seen that the gradient curve has a negative slope. That is, vCA=vx is negative.
At a location x, the ﬂux of Gas A, on a molar basis is
_nA
A ¼  DAB
vCA
vx
(11.12)
where _nA
A is the molar ﬂux of species A (kmol/s m2), DAB is the binary diffusion coefﬁcient (m2/s), CA is
the molar concentration of species A (kmol/m3).
Eq. (11.12) is Fick’s law of diffusion. The law can be expressed on a mass basis by multiplying
both sides of Eq. (11.12) by molecular weight MA and using Eq. (11.1). This results in
_mA

where _mA

density of species A (kg/m3).
The minus sign in Eqs. (11.12) and (11.13) makes the molar and mass ﬂows positive for ﬂow in
the þx direction.
11.3.1 Binary gas diffusion coefﬁcient
Many experiments have been performed to determine binary diffusion coefﬁcients. And, several
correlation equations have been proposed to ﬁt experimental data and to predict the coefﬁcient for
pairs of gases for which experimental data are unavailable [1e6]. One such equation, by Fuller,
Schettler, and Giddings [5], was developed by correlating data for 340 experiments. The equation has
a very good average error of only 4.3%. The equation is

where DAB ¼ binary gas diffusion coefﬁcient (m2/s),
P ¼ total pressure (atm),
T ¼ temperature (K),
M ¼ molecular weight of the gas (kg/kmol),
VA and VB ¼ diffusion molecular volumes of the two gases.
The diffusion molecular volumes of some simple gases are given in Table 11.1. For organic vapors,
the diffusion volume increments given in Table 11.2 may be appropriately summed to obtain an
equivalent volume to use in Eq. (11.14). For example, if methane (CH4) is Gas A, then, using the values
in Table 11.2, VA ¼ ð16:5Þ þ 4ð1:98Þ ¼ 24:42.
It is seen from Eq. (11.14) that the diffusion coefﬁcient is directly proportional to the temperature
to the 1.75 power and inversely proportional to the pressure. Hence, if DAB is known at State 1, then
DAB at State 2 can be approximated by using the relation

Experimental values of gas diffusion coefﬁcients are given in Table 11.3. Most of the experimental
values in the table are from a listing in Ref. [5], which can be consulted for the original data sources. If
the listed coefﬁcient value was for a temperature and/or pressure different from 300 K and 1 atm, then
Eq. (11.15) was used to modify the value to the 300 K, 1 atm reference values.

The previous section provided binary diffusion coefﬁcients for several different gas pairs. There can
also be diffusion of gases through liquids. Table 11.4 gives the diffusion coefﬁcients for several gases
in water [7].
11.4 Diffusion in gases
In this section, we consider two topics. The ﬁrst is Stefan’s law, which involves evaporation of a liquid
into and through a stagnant gas. A couple of relevant processes are the drying of fabrics and the drying
of paint. The second topic is equimolar counterdiffusion, which is relevant to distillation processes.

11.4 Diffusion in gases

11.4.1 Stefan’s law
Let’s consider the open container shown in Fig. 11.2. The container contains Liquid A and a stagnant
column of Gas B.
There is isothermal evaporation of liquid species A from the free surface of the liquid and the
diffusion of the gaseous species A through the stagnant column of Gas B. We will assume that the
process is steady, the gas pressure P in the container is constant, and that Gas B is not soluble in liquid
A. We will also assume that the two gases, A and B, are ideal gases.
There is movement of Gas B across the opening of the container to sweep away any amount of Gas
A reaching the opening. That is, the concentration of Gas A at the opening is negligible. The
movement of Gas B is gentle and has negligible effect on the gas movement inside the container.
Species A is evaporated from the liquid and moves upward by diffusion through the column of Gas
B. Gas B moves downward by diffusion. However, Gas B is not soluble in liquid A so there is no
downward movement of B at the liquid A surface. To have steady diffusion, there must be a bulk ﬂow
of A and B upward against the downward diffusion of B.
The downward mass diffusion ﬂux of species B at a location x is, by Eq. (11.13),
_mB

where A is the cross-sectional area of the container.

This equation can be applied in an experiment to determine binary diffusion coefﬁcients. The
experimental setup is essentially identical to the open container discussed in this section. A vertical
tube, closed at the bottom, contains the liquid of one of the gas species. The other species blows gently
across the open upper end of the tube. The liquid in the tube is maintained at a constant temperature,
and the evaporation of the liquid is measured by the drop of liquid level in the tube. Knowledge of the
evaporation rate _mA of the liquid affords the determination of the gas diffusion coefﬁcient DAB. The
tube used in the experiment is called a Stefan tube.

11.4.2 Equimolar counterdiffusion
Let us now look at Fig. 11.3 that shows two reservoirs connected by a tube. The tube has ﬂow area A
and length L. The reservoirs contain gas mixtures of species A and B, with the left reservoir having a
larger concentration of A than B and the right reservoir having a larger concentration of B than A. Both
reservoirs are at the same pressure P and temperature T. When the valve is opened, Gas A starts to
diffuse to the right and Gas B starts to diffuse to the left.
The diffusion of the gases follows Fick’s law. At steady state in the tube, we have, for the molar

greater rate than the helium. The molar ﬂow rates of both gases are the same. Use of Eq. (11.36) gives the molar ﬂow
rate as 1.712  109 kmol/s.
11.5 The mass-heat analogy
In Chapter 3, we discussed the heat-electric analogy, which was very useful in deriving equations for
heat ﬂow through layered systems such as composite walls. In this section, we will discuss another
analogy, the mass-heat analogy.
Let us ﬁrst go back to Fick’s law of diffusion, Eq. (11.12):
_nA
A ¼  DAB
vCA
vx
(11.38)
On the left side of the equation, we have the molar ﬂux and on the right side we have the binary
gaseous diffusion coefﬁcient and the concentration gradient. It is the concentration gradient that causes
the molar ﬂux. Fick’s law is analogous to Fourier’s law of heat conduction, stated in Eq. (1.3):
qx
A ¼  k vT
vx
(11.39)
On the left side of the equation is the heat ﬂux and on the right side is the thermal conductivity and
the temperature gradient which is the driving force for the heat ﬂux. By comparing Eqs. (11.38) and
(11.39), it is seen that the molar ﬂux corresponds to the heat ﬂux, the gaseous diffusion coefﬁcient
corresponds to the thermal conductivity, and the concentration gradient corresponds to the temperature
gradient.

11.5.1 Mass transfer through walls and membranes
In Chapter 3, we integrated Fourier’s law and applied appropriate boundary conditions to obtain re-
lations for the heat transfer rate q through a variety of walls: ﬂat walls, cylindrical walls, and spherical
walls. These relations were given in Eqs. (3.10), (3.55), and (3.73) and were the following:

In Eq. (11.40), L is the thickness of the wall, A is the cross-sectional area of the wall, and T1 and T2
are the temperatures of the two surfaces of the wall.
In Eq. (11.41), L is the length of the cylinder, ri and ro are the inner and outer radii of the wall, and
Ti and To are the inner and outer surface temperatures of the wall.
In Eq. (11.42), ri and ro are the inner and outer radii of the wall and Ti and To are the inner and
outer surface temperatures of the wall.
The analogous relations for molar ﬂow of gas species A through walls are given in Eqs. (11.43),

Table 11.5 gives some binary diffusion coefﬁcients in solids [8e10].
From Eqs. (11.43)e(11.45), we see that the gas concentrations at the boundaries of the solid wall or
membrane are needed for determination of the molar ﬂux. At each boundary, there is a solid side and a
gas side. We need the gas concentration on the solid side of the boundary. This concentration is related
to the partial pressure of the diffusing gas by the Solubility S. That is
CA; solid side ¼ SPA; gas side
(11.46)
11.5 The mass-heat analogy

where
CA; solid side ¼ concentration of gas species A at the solid side of the boundary (kmol/m3)
S ¼ solubility for the gasesolid combination (kmol/m3 bar)
PA; gas side ¼ partial pressure of gas species A on the gas side of the boundary (bar).
Some solubilities are given in Table 11.6 [8].
Another parameter often used in ﬂow through walls and membranes is the Permeability P. This is
the product of the diffusion coefﬁcient and the solubility. That is,
P ¼ DABS
(11.47)
where
P ¼ permeability (kmol/m s bar)
S ¼ solubility for the gas-solid combination (kmol/m3 bar)

The next example, Example 11.5, shows that gases can indeed pass through solid containers.
However, the leakage rate is usually very, very small.
Example 11.5
Diffusion of helium through a fused silica container

Solution
Let us assume that the diameter given is the inside diameter of the container. Then ri ¼ 1 m and ro ¼ 1:025 m.
The molar rate of ﬂow of the helium through the container wall is given by Eq. (11.45):
_nA ¼

(11.48)
We need the diffusion coefﬁcient DAB for the helium-fused silica system and the concentrationsCAi and CAo of the helium
at the inner and outer surfaces of the container.
From Table 11.5, DAB ¼ 4  1014 m2
s.
From Table 11.6, the solubility for the helium-fused silica system S ¼ 4.5  104 kmol/m3 bar.
The helium pressure is 2 atm. Converting this to bars, we have
P ¼ 2 atm x (101.325 kPa/1 atm) x (1 bar/100 kPa) ¼ 2.0265 bar.
The container has only helium, so the partial pressure of the helium is 2.0265 bar.
From Eq. (11.46), the concentration of the helium on the silica side of the inner surface is
CA; solidside ¼ SPA; gasside ¼

4:5  104
ð2:0265Þ ¼ 0:000912 kmol=m3
On the silica side of the outer surface, the concentration of helium is essentially zero as there is negligible helium in the
adjacent atmospheric air. Putting values into Eq. (11.48), we have, for the molar diffusion of helium through the container
wall,
_nA ¼

Problem
A rubber membrane, 0.5 mm thick, separates hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen is at 25 C and 2 atm pressure and

The diffusion coefﬁcients are in Table 11.5. For the H2erubber system, we have DAB ¼ 10.2  1010 m2/s, and for the
O2erubber system, we have DAB ¼ 1.58  1010 m2/s.
The concentrations of the gases in the membrane at the left and right boundaries can be determined from the solubilities of
the gases and the pressure of the gases using Eq. (11.46):
CA; solid side ¼ SPA; gas side
(11.50)
For the hydrogen on the left side of the membrane (location 1): S ¼ 2.1  103 kmol/m3 bar from Table 11.6 and the par-
tial pressure of the hydrogen is 2 atm  (101.325 kPa/atm)  (1 bar/100 kPa) ¼ 2.0265 bar. Hence, from Eq. (11.50),
CH2 ¼ 0.00426 kmol/m3 at location 1. On the right side of the membrane (location 2), CH2 ¼ 0.
For the oxygen on the right side of the membrane (location 2): S ¼ 3.12  103 kmol/m3 bar from Table 11.6 and the par-
tial pressure of the oxygen is 0.9 atm  (101.325 kPa/atm)  (1 bar/100 kPa) ¼ 0.9119 bar. Hence, from Eq. (11.50),
CO2 ¼ 0.00285 kmol/m3. On the left side of the membrane (location 1), CO2 ¼ 0.
The molar ﬂuxes of the gases through the membrane are, from Eq. (11.49),

Chapter 11 Mass transfer

The initial hydrogen mass ﬂux through the membrane is to the right at 1.74  108 kg/s per m2 of membrane.
The initial oxygen mass ﬂux through the membrane is to the left at 2.88  108 kg/s per m2 of membrane.
11.5.2 Transient diffusion
The previous section dealt with steady-state diffusion. The mass-heat analogy is also useful for
transient applications. One such application is the carburization of steel.
Carburization is used in the heat treatment of steel objects. In this process, a carbon-bearing
material such as charcoal or carbon monoxide gas is applied to the surface of the object. The car-
bon diffuses into the object and produces a surface layer of higher carbon concentration than the base
metal. This surface layer has increased hardness, toughness, and wear-resistance. Carburization is
often used for machine parts such as bearings, gears, and axles.
The carburization process is often used on low-carbon and alloy steels with initial carbon content of
0.2%e0.3%. The carbon concentration in the carburized layer is usually in the range of 0.8%e1%, and
the case depth generally ranges from about 0.1 to 1.5 mm.
The mass-heat analogy is useful for predicting the required time for the carburization process. In
Chapter 4, we discussed transient conduction in a semi-inﬁnite object. The object was initially at a
uniform temperature and then the surface temperature was abruptly changed and we determined the
resulting temperature distribution in the object for different times after the change of surface tem-
perature. This situation is analogous to the carburization process. The object initially has a uniform
carbon concentration and then the carbon concentration at the surface of the object is abruptly
increased. We wish to determine the carbon concentration at a speciﬁc depth in the object at a speciﬁc
time after the change in surface concentration.
The heat transfer equation for the transient conduction in a semi-inﬁnite object with a surface
temperature boundary condition is Equation (4.108):

CA; o ¼ concentration of species A at surface for t  0
DAB ¼ diffusion coefﬁcient
The concentrations on the left side of Eq. (11.52) are molar concentrations of species A. For dilute
solutions, we could have used densities, mole fractions, or mass (weight) fractions in place of the
molar concentrations.
11.5 The mass-heat analogy
447

Example 11.7 illustrates the application of Eq. (11.52) to a problem involving the carburization
process.
Example 11.7
Carburization of a steel machine part
Problem
A steel machine part is to be carburized in a furnace. The steel initially has a carbon content of 0.3% by weight. The carbu-
rizing agent produces a surface carbon concentration of 1.4% by weight. It is desired that the carbon concentration at a
depth of 0.75 mm from the surface be 1% by weight. How long should the part be kept in the carburizing furnace? Assume
that the diffusion coefﬁcient of carbon in steel is 3  1011 m2/s for the furnace temperature.

Solving Eq. (11.54) for time t, we have t ¼ 41,944 s ¼ 11.7 h.
To achieve the desired treatment, the part should be left in the furnace for 11.7 h.
11.6 Gaseliquid diffusion
Thus far, we have looked at diffusion through gases and diffusion of a gas through a solid. Let us now
look at diffusion of a gas in a liquid. Consider Fig. 11.4 that shows a gas adjacent to the surface of a
liquid.
The gas (species A) adjacent to the liquid surface has a partial pressure of PAgas. At the surface,
some of Gas A dissolves in the liquid. The mole fraction of the gas on the liquid side of the interface is
yAliquid. For dilute solutions, Henry’s law relates the gas pressure to the mole fraction of the gas in the
liquid. This law is

where H ¼ Henry’s constant.
Table 11.7 gives Henry’s constant for a variety of species in water. Although it is called a “con-
stant,” it is seen that H varies signiﬁcantly with temperature.
Examples 11.8 and 11.9 illustrate the use of Henry’s law.
Example 11.8
Dissolved carbon dioxide in sparkling water
Problem
A one-liter bottle of sparkling water is charged with carbon dioxide at 2 atm pressure and 20 C. The gas space above the
liquid contains a saturated mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide. What is the amount of dissolved CO2 in the water?
Solution
From the steam tables: For water at 20 C, the saturation pressure is 2.34 kPa. Therefore, above the liquid,
PH2O ¼ 2:34 kPa and PCO2 ¼ 2 atm  ð101:325 kPa =atmÞ  2:34 ¼ 200:3 kPa ¼ 2.003 bar.
From Henry’s law; at the liquid  gas interface; yAliquid ¼ PAgas
H
(11.56)
We are concerned with the amount of carbon dioxide in the water, so species A in Eq. (11.56) is the carbon dioxide. Lin-
early interpolating from Table 11.7 for carbon dioxide at 20 C, we have H ¼ 1426 bar. Hence, from Eq. (11.56), the mole
fraction of CO2 in the water is
yCO2liquid ¼ PCO2gas
H
¼ 2:003
1426 ¼ 0:001405
(11.57)
The volume of the water is 1 L x (1 m3/1000 L) ¼ 0.001 m3.

From above, yCO2liquid ¼ 0:001405.
From the deﬁnition of mole fraction, we have

nCO2þnH2O ¼
nCO2
nCO2þ0:0554 ¼ 0:001405.
Solving this for the number of kmols of CO2, we get nCO2 ¼ 7:795  105 kmol.

nCO2MCO2 ¼

7:795  105 kmol

Example 11.9
Oxygen diffusion in a pool
Problem
A homeowner ﬁlls his pool after cleaning it. The water initially has no oxygen in it. However, oxygen is gained from the
atmospheric air by diffusion. What will be the mole fraction of oxygen at a depth of 1 cm from the surface 10 hours after
the pool ﬁlling?
Solution
Atmospheric air contains about 21% oxygen. We will assume the air and water are at 300 K and the air is at standard
atmospheric pressure of 101.325 kPa. The saturation pressure of water at 300 K is 3.57 kPa, so the partial pressure of
the air is 101.325e3.57 ¼ 97.76 kPa. The partial pressure of the oxygen in the air is
PO2 ¼ 0:21ð97:76 kPaÞ ¼ 20.53 kPa ¼ 0:2053 bar
(11.58)
Using Eq. (11.55) and Henry’s constant from Table 11.7, we can get the mole fraction of oxygen on the liquid side of the
pool surface.
yO2liquid ¼ PO2gas
H
¼ 0:2053
45000 ¼ 4.56  106

A mass transfer coefﬁcient can be deﬁned similarly to how we deﬁned the convective coefﬁcient h.
The equation for the heat transfer coefﬁcient was
q ¼ hAðT1  T2Þ
(11.61)
For the mass transfer, we have
_mA ¼ Mcoef AðCA1  CA2Þ
(11.62)
where _mA ¼ mass ﬂow rate of species A (kg/s)
A ¼ area through which species A ﬂows (m2)
Mcoef ¼ mass transfer coefﬁcient (m/s)
CA ¼ mass concentration of species A (kg/m3).
As used in Eq. (11.62), the concentration of species A is actually the density rA of species A.

Chapter 11 Mass transfer

11.7.1 Dimensionless parameters
In heat transfer, several dimensionless parameters were used to correlate experimental data. These
parameters included the Reynolds number, Re; the Prandtl number, Pr; the Nusselt number, Nu; and
the Grashof number, Gr. Mass transfer also has its dimensionless parameters, which include
Schmidt Number Sc ¼ y
D ¼ m
rD
where
y ¼ kinematic viscosity
D ¼ the diffusion coefficient
m ¼ absolute viscosity
r ¼ density
Lewis Number Le ¼ a
D
where
a ¼ thermal diffusivity
The Lewis number is also the Schmidt number divided by the Prandtl number. That is,
Le ¼ Sc
Pr
Sherwood Number Sh ¼ Mcoef L
D
where
D ¼ the diffusion coefficient
L ¼ a characteristic length of the problem
In a previous section, we discussed some useful analogies between heat and mass transfer. For
example, we used equations for heat transfer through a wall to obtain equations for mass diffusion of a
gas through the wall of a container. Another heat-mass analogy is the ChiltoneColburn Analogy,
which is useful when both heat transfer and mass transfer are occurring simultaneously. The analogy
results in the following relation between the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient h and the mass transfer
coefﬁcient Mcoef :
h
Mcoef
¼ rcpðLeÞ2=3
(11.63)
where cp ¼ specific heat at constant pressure.
This relation will be used in the following section on the wet-bulb and dry-bulb psychrometer.
11.7.2 Wet-bulb and dry-bulb psychrometer
The wet-bulb and dry-bulb psychrometer measures the wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures of air.
Knowing these temperatures, the moisture content of the air can be determined. The psychrometer
consists of two bulb thermometers. One is uncovered (the dry bulb). The other (the wet bulb) has a
wick covering that is kept wet from a small water container in the device.
Fig. 11.5 shows the wet-bulb thermometer portion of the psychrometer.

The air, at temperature Tdb, ﬂows over the wet-bulb thermometer, evaporating water from the wick.
The temperature measured by the wet-bulb thermometer is Twb: Heat from the air stream causes
evaporation of water from the wick. At steady state, we have

(11.64)
where
_mw ¼ evaporation rate of the water ðkg=sÞ
hfg ¼ enthalpy of vaporization of water ðkJ=kgÞ
For the water being evaporated, we have, from Eq. (11.62),
_mw ¼ Mcoef Arðmf2  mf1Þ
(11.65)
where
r ¼ density of the air stream
mf1 ¼ mass fraction of water vapor in the air stream
mf2 ¼ mass fraction of water vapor in the air immediately adjacent to the wick
Combining Eqs. (11.64) and (11.65), we have

11.8 Chapter summary and ﬁnal remarks
This chapter was an introduction to mass transfer, a topic of major importance to chemical engineers.
We ﬁrst discussed the terminology relevant to concentrations in gas mixtures. We then discussed mass
diffusion, including diffusion of a gas in another gas, diffusion of gas in a liquid, and diffusion in a
solid. We covered leakage of gases through container walls and carburization of steel for case hard-
ening. We discussed the heat-mass analogy, whereby equations from heat transfer, with minor
modiﬁcation, can be applied to applications in mass transfer. Finally, we discussed the dry-bulb and
wet-bulb psychrometer whose operation is based on simultaneous heat and mass transfer. But, we have
only touched the surface of mass transfer. Additional information can be found in Ref. [11e17].

12.1 Introduction
This chapter contains special topics that may be included in a heat transfer course if time permits and
the instructor so desires. Two of these topics are internal heat generation and heat transfer in buildings.
They are extensions of material covered in earlier chapters. The other two topics, contact resistance
and condensation/boiling, are unique to this chapter.
12.2 Internal heat generation
Section 3.4 considered heat generation in a cylinder. In this section, we will consider heat generation in
plane walls and spheres.

12.2.1 Heat generation in a plane wall
Fig. 12.1 shows a plane wall. It has a constant, uniformly distributed internal heat generation source of
strength qgen W/m3. The wall has a thickness of L in the x direction. Its lengths in the y and z directions
are large so that the heat ﬂow can be assumed to be one-dimensional. The heat ﬂow is also steady, so
the temperature in the wall is T ¼ TðxÞ: As shown in the ﬁgure, there are temperature boundary
conditions at the two wall surfaces.
The appropriate heat conduction equation is Equation (3.2), repeated here:

the heat ﬂow is one-dimensional. Then Eq. (12.1) becomes

Let us now determine the location of the maximum temperature in the wall and its value. The

(12.11)
If we use this x-value in Eq. (12.9), we can get the maximum temperature in the wall.
Caution: Looking at the temperature distribution given in Eq. (12.9), it is seen that there is a heat
generation term and a linear term. If the heat generation rate is small, the linear term will dominate,
and there will be no maximum in the wall where dT
dx ¼ 0: Eq. (12.11) will then give a location xmax,
which lies outside the wall. That is, xmax will be less than zero or greater than L. For this situation, the
location of the maximum temperature in the wall will be at a wall surface. This is illustrated by
Example 12.1 which follows.

Note: For this lower heat generation rate, the conduction transfer through the wall overcomes the heat generation. The heat
ﬂuxes at both surfaces are to the left. Let us check our results. The input to the wall is the heat generation plus the heat ﬂowing

the heat ﬂow from the wall through the left surface is 1.683  105 A W, which conﬁrms our calculations.
Let us now look at the situation shown in Fig. 12.2, where both wall surfaces are at the same

surface is positive and in the plus x direction. Regarding the magnitude of the heat ﬂows: qgen is the
generation rate per unit volume and ðAL=2Þ is the volume of half of the wall. Therefore, the magni-
tudes of the heat ﬂows at the wall surfaces are equal to the heat generated in half of the wall. Finally,

at the center plane of the wall ðx ¼ L=2Þ, dT=dx ¼ 0 and the heat ﬂow is zero from Eq. (12.15). There
is no heat ﬂow across the center plane of the wall.
Summarizing, we see that the heat generated in the left half of the wall ﬂows out the left surface of
the wall. And, the heat generated in the right half of the wall ﬂows out the right surface of the wall.
The above is for temperature boundary conditions. Let us now look at convection boundary
conditions at the two surfaces. Fig. 12.3 shows this situation.
The ﬂuid on the left surface of the wall has a temperature TN1 and a convective coefﬁcient h1: The
ﬂuid on the right surface is at TN2with a convective coefﬁcient h2:

insulation on one surface is really equivalent to that of a wall twice as thick having the same convection at both surfaces.
For this latter wall, dT=dx is zero and the heat ﬂow is zero at the center plane.

Solution
An Excel spreadsheet was used for the solution of the problem. The values in this problem, i.e., values for
qgen; L; k; ε1; ε2; s; Tsurr1; and Tsurr2, were entered in cells. The unknown constants C1 and C2 were also assigned
cells. The functions on the left sides of Eqs. (12.40) and (12.42) were assigned cells. Let us say these last 2 cells were cells
F1 and F2. Finally, a cell F3 was deﬁned as F1^2 þ F2^2. We put starting values of 100 in the cells for C1 and C2 and called
up the Solver add-in program. We told Solver to vary the values in the cells for C1 and C2 until cell F3 was a minimum.
(Ideally we want F3 to be zero, but we are satisﬁed if F3 is very small.)
When we did this for the parametric values of the problem, we got a very small value for F3 and the values for C1 and C2
were C1 ¼ 94:31 and C2 ¼ 710:36: With these values, we used Eq. (12.37) to get the surface temperatures and Eq.
(12.43) to get the location of the maximum temperature. Using this location, we used Eq. (12.37) to get the maximum
temperature in the wall.

The left surface of the wall is at 437.2 C and the right surface is at 429.4 C. The maximum temperature in the wall is
437.7 C and it is located 9.43 mm from the left surface.
Note: The equations for C1 and C2 are nonlinear. Successful solution of the equations often depends on the guessed start-
ing values for C1 and C2. Several attempts with different starting values may be necessary for success.
We have covered situations for temperature, convection, and radiation boundary conditions at the
surfaces of the wall. We can also have both convection and radiation occurring simultaneously at the
wall surfaces. The treatment of this situation is left as a problem in the problems section of the chapter.

12.3 Contact resistance
Let us consider two large plates of area Awhich are in contact. Plate 1 has thermal conductivity k1 and
Plate 2 has conductivity k2: This is shown in Fig. 12.8.
The outside surface of Plate 1 is at temperature T1 and the outside surface of Plate 2 is at a lower
temperature T2. Ideally, the contact surfaces of the two plates are perfectly smooth and there is no
resistance to heat ﬂow at the contact interface. Then, as the plates are large, the heat ﬂow will
essentially be one-dimensional and will be

temperature difference between the two plates in contact. This temperature difference is shown in

above the other, in the apparatus. Below the lower specimen is a heat ﬂux meter. There is a heating
section above the upper specimen and a cooling section below the heat ﬂux meter. Insulation is
provided around the specimens so that heat ﬂow is axial. Thermocouples are provided in the test
specimens to determine the temperature proﬁles. Finally, there is a mechanism provided to vary the
axial force on the specimens so that results can be obtained for different contact pressures.
Heat transfer between surfaces in contact consists of conduction through the solid areas in contact
and conduction through the ﬂuid that is trapped in the spaces created by the roughness of the sur-
faces. (If the surfaces are in a vacuum, the latter item, of course, does not apply.) For surfaces at very
high temperatures, radiation heat transfer between the surfaces is also a factor. The contact
conductance depends on several parameters, including the material(s) of the surfaces; surface
roughness; surface ﬂatness; surface condition (e.g., conductance is decreased if the surfaces are
oxidized); the contact pressure; and the ﬂuid between the surfaces.
In general, contact conductance increases with an increase in contact pressure as a pressure
increase results in an increased area of surface contact. The conductance also increases with smoother
and ﬂatter surfaces, with trapped ﬂuids of higher conductivity, and for higher contact temperatures.
One way to increase contact conductance is to insert a very thin foil of soft metal between the
surfaces. Another way is to use thermal greases, many of which are silicon-based.
Much experimentation has been performed to determine contact conductance. Some experimental
results are given in Table 12.1 [1e4]. Other experimental and theoretical studies on contact resistance
are in Refs. [5e11].
We conclude this section with two examples involving contact resistance.

12.4 Condensation and boiling
Up to now, we have only considered heat transfer involving a single phase. This section considers heat
transfer involving a change of phase for a substance. When the temperature of a subcooled liquid is
raised above its saturation temperature, vaporization or boiling will occur. And, when the temperature
of a superheated vapor is lowered below its saturation temperature, condensation will occur. Such
changes in phase result in relatively large heat transfer rates. Applications include power and
refrigeration cycles and compact heat exchangers.
Condensation and boiling heat transfer are signiﬁcantly more complex than single-phase heat
transfer. We will consider only the fundamentals of the phenomena. The references at the end of this
chapter may be consulted for more detailed treatments of the topics.
12.4.1 Condensation heat transfer
As mentioned above, condensation takes place when a condensable vapor is cooled to a temperature
lower than its saturation temperature Tsat: This is usually done by bringing the vapor into contact with a
surface that is at a temperature lower than Tsat: The vapor will condense, and the resulting condensate
will ﬂow down the surface under the action of gravity. The condensation will be either dropwise or
ﬁlmwise. In dropwise condensation, drops of condensate form on the surface and ﬂow downward in
random paths over the surface. This will happen if the condensate does not “wet” the surface. On the
other hand, if the condensate “wets” the surface, then a condensate ﬁlm will form on the surface and
the condensate will ﬂow downwards as a ﬁlm over all of the surface. At the upper end of the surface,
the thickness of the ﬁlm will be zero or minimal. As the condensate ﬂows downward, the ﬁlm thickness
increases.
12.4 Condensation and boiling
481

The layer of condensate in ﬁlm condensation causes a resistance to heat ﬂow between the vapor and
the surface. Therefore, dropwise condensation results in signiﬁcantly higher heat transfer rates than
ﬁlm condensation and is to be preferred if such higher heat rates are desired. But dropwise conden-
sation is much harder to sustain than ﬁlm condensation, and ﬁlm condensation is the predominant
mode of condensation occurring in practice. For this reason, design of heat transfer devices usually
assumes ﬁlm condensation rather than dropwise condensation.
We will look at ﬁlm condensation for vertical and inclined plates. We will also look at external ﬁlm
condensation for vertical and horizontal cylinders and spheres.
12.4.1.1 Film condensation for vertical and inclined plates
12.4.1.1.1 Vertical plates
Fig. 12.13 shows ﬁlm condensation on a vertical ﬂat surface. This phenomenon was ﬁrst analyzed in
1916 by Nusselt [12]. The surface is at temperature Ts and the vapor adjacent to the ﬁlm is at saturation
temperature Tv: The thickness of the ﬁlm is dðxÞ: It is zero at x ¼ 0; and it increases with x.
An element of the condensate ﬁlm between x and x þ dx is shown in Fig. 12.14. The ﬁgure also
shows the forces acting on the element.
The element has a thickness of d  y; a height of dx, and a width of unity (in the z direction). Its
volume is therefore ðd yÞðdxÞð1Þ: It is assumed that the condensate ﬂow down the surface is laminar,
the temperature distribution from the plate surface to the vapor is linear, and there is no shear stress at
the interface between the condensate and the vapor. Three forces act on the element as follows: There
is the weight of the condensate in the element, the buoyant force on the element (which is the weight of
the displaced vapor), and the shear force on the left face of the element. The ﬁrst force acts downward
in the þx direction. The other two act upwards in the x direction. We assume that the acceleration of
the element is negligible. Newton’s Law then gives

The heat transfer coefﬁcient is based on laminar ﬂow in the ﬁlm. It also assumes that the tem-
perature proﬁle is linear across the ﬁlm thickness. However, the proﬁle is actually nonlinear, and the
condensate ﬁlm is being cooled to below the saturation temperature. These two factors can be
compensated for by replacing hfg in Eq. (12.83) by h0

It was found by experimentation that the critical Reynolds number, where the ﬂow turns turbulent,
is about 1800. It turns out that Eq. (12.85) for the heat transfer coefﬁcient gives accurate results if Re is
less than about 30. However, between Reynolds numbers of 30 and 1800, the surface of the condensate
becomes wavy and the heat transfer coefﬁcient in this region is somewhat greater than that given by
Eq. (12.85). McAdams [13] suggested that the heat transfer coefﬁcient given by Eq. (12.85) be
increased by 20% in the wavy region for design purposes. If this is done, Eq. (12.85) for vertical

The properties of the condensate in the previous equations should be taken at the ﬁlm temperature

efﬁcient in cases where the vapor is superheated. For those cases, the heat ﬂow should be calculated
using the difference between the surface temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to
the pressure of the vapor.
An alternative approach to Eq. (12.90) for the wavy surface region of 30 < Re < 1800 was

Steam condenser
Problem
A steam condenser has 60 horizontal tubes arranged in a tube bundle 10 tubes wide by 6 tubes high. Each tube has an outer
diameter of 2 cm and a length of 10 m. The outer surfaces of the tubes are at 20 C. The steam is saturated and at a pressure
of 20 kPa. What is the heat transfer rate for the condenser and the rate of condensation of the steam?

12.4.2 Boiling heat transfer
Boiling occurs when a solid surface is in contact with a liquid, and the temperature of the solid surface
is sufﬁciently greater than the saturation temperature of the liquid. Let us consider a surface immersed
in a liquid. The boiling heat transfer causes some of the liquid to vaporize, resulting in vapor bubbles
12.4 Condensation and boiling
489

and ﬁlms. If the liquid is initially stagnant, motion of the vapor and heated water will occur due to
buoyancy effects. There will be natural convection or pool boiling. If the liquid is initially in motion,
then the boiling will affect the initial ﬂuid motion. This boiling is ﬂow boiling. We will discuss pool
boiling. References [16e18] may be consulted for information on ﬂow boiling.
12.4.2.1 Regions of pool boiling
Fig. 12.17 shows a typical boiling curve for water at 1 atm pressure. Other liquids have similarly-
shaped curves. The boiling curve gives heat ﬂux ðq=AÞ at the surface of the immersed object versus the
excess temperature DTexcess, which is the difference between the surface temperature Ts and the
saturated water temperature Tsat. That is, DTexcess ¼ Ts  Tsat:
The ﬁgure shows four regions, a maximum, and a minimum. Let us ﬁrst discuss the regions.
Region I is for an excess temperature less than about 5 C. In this region, there is natural convection
heat transfer.
Region II is the nucleate boiling region that is for excess temperatures between about 5 C and
30 C. At the lower end of this range, bubbles start to appear on the surface of the solid. As the excess
temperature increases, these bubbles rise to the free surface of the liquid.
Region III is the transition boiling region, covering excess temperatures between about 30 C and
120 C. The creation of bubbles is quite rapid and a vapor ﬁlm starts to form on the solid surface. This
ﬁlm provides a resistance to heat transfer, which results in the decrease in heat ﬂux as the excess
temperature increases. This region is also called the unstable ﬁlm region as there is ﬂuctuation between
nucleate and ﬁlm boiling on the surface.
Region IV is the ﬁlm boiling region. The excess temperature is high, greater than about 120 C, and
the heating surface is covered by a ﬁlm, or blanket, of vapor. As the excess temperature increases,
radiation heat transfer through the vapor ﬁlm becomes signiﬁcant and increases the heat ﬂux.

The maximum heat ﬂux (Point A) is the critical heat ﬂux (CHF). Let us say we start at a point on the
boiling curve (e.g., Point C) in the nucleate boiling region to the left of Point A and slowly increase the
heat ﬂux. Following the curve, the excess temperature also increases. However, an important and
unexpected thing happens when the CHF point is reached. With further increase in heat ﬂux, there is an
abrupt increase of surface temperature and the system no longer follows the boiling curve. There is a
jump to Point D in the ﬁlm boiling region. And, this new surface temperature may indeed be greater
than the melting point of the solid, thereby causing failure of the device. For this reason, Point A is
often called the burnout point. This characteristic was ﬁrst observed by Nukiyama [19] in his ex-
periments on heated nichrome and platinum wires in water.
To avoid the possibility of burnout, devices are generally designed to operate in the higher heat ﬂux
area of the nucleate boiling region, but below the CHF point. The heat ﬂux for this operating area is
high and the excess temperature is small.
The minimum heat ﬂux (Point B) is called the Leidenfrost point. At this point, the surface is
completely covered by a ﬁlm of vapor.
12.4.2.2 Nucleate pool boiling
In 1952, Rohsenow [20] proposed a boiling curve correlation for the nucleate pool boiling region. This
correlation, which ﬁnds often use today, is

12.5 Energy usage in buildings
In this section, we discuss energy usage in buildings. In particular, we discuss the degree-day method.
The method could be applied to various types of buildings and for both heating and cooling. However,
it was originally developed for heating of residences, and it is for this application that it has the highest
accuracy. Hence, we restrict our discussion to the heating of residences. Using the degree-day method,
we will estimate the energy needed to provide adequate heating of residences.
Let’s ﬁrst consider the deﬁnition of “degree-day” If we look at a given day, the day has a maximum
temperature Tmax and a minimum temperature Tmin: If we average these temperatures, we get Tavg, the
average temperature for the day. That is, Tavg ¼ TminþTmax
2
. Another temperature of interest is the
balance point temperature. This is the outdoor temperature above which no heating is needed. When
the degree-day method originated, the balance point temperature was about 65 F. If the temperature on
a day was 65 F or higher, no heating would be needed on that day. However, if the temperature was
lower than 65 F, heating would indeed be needed. The amount of needed heating was postulated to be
proportional to the difference between 65 F and the average temperature Tavg for the day.
The number of degree days for a particular day is then the difference between the balance point
temperature (originally 65 F) and the average temperature of the day if the day’s average temperature
is below the balance point temperature. If the average temperature is above the balance point tem-
perature, the day has zero degree days. For example, let us say that the balance point temperature for a
building is 65 F, and the average temperature of a day is 43 F. Then the number of degree days for the
12.5 Energy usage in buildings
497

day is 65  43 or 22 degree days. But if the balance point temperature is 65 F and the average
temperature for the day is 74 F, no degree-days will be obtained for the day. Weather bureaus keep
track of annual degree days and often monthly degreedays for given locations. As shown below, these
values can be used to predict energy usage for heating a building.
Over the years, buildings have become better insulated. They have also become “tighter” and
inﬁltration of cold air has been reduced. Finally, the use of heat-generating appliances has increased.
All these factors have caused the balance point temperature to drop a bit from the original 65 F.
Degree-day data for the base of 65 F is still often used in determining energy usage. However, use of
the 65 F base tends to overpredict the energy usage, and a correction factor less than unity is applied to
the result so it is in better agreement with the actual energy usage of the building.
The equation for predicting heating energy usage of a building by the degree-day method is

ðBtu = hrÞ
DD ¼ the number of degree days for the desired period ðF  dayÞ
h ¼ efficiency of heating system; usually between about 0.6 and 0.95. For electricity; h ¼ 1
HV ¼ heating value of fuel ðBtu = unit of fuelÞ
For natural gas, HV ¼ 1050 Btu/ft3
For propane, HV ¼ 90,000 Btu/gal.
For #2 fuel oil, HV ¼ 140,000 Btu/gal.
For electricity, HV ¼ 3412 Btu/kWh.
Ti ¼ inside design temperature ðFÞ
To ¼ outside design temperature ðFÞ
CD ¼ correction factor ¼ 1 if DD is based on the actual balance point temperature
of the building
¼ 0.77 if DD is based on a 65 F balance point temperature
Let us now discuss some of the items in Eq. (12.109).
The inside design temperature Ti is arbitrary and determined from the desires of the occupants. A
temperature of 72 F is often used. The outside design temperature depends on the location of the
residence and the historical outside temperatures at that location. A location in the northern part of the
United States will have a lower design temperature than locations further south. Table 12.5 gives
ASHRAE recommended outside design temperatures and approximate annual heating degree days
(65 F base) for some locations in the United States [30].
The parameter qL in Eq. (12.109) is the calculated heat load of the building based on the inside and
outside design temperatures. The two major components of this parameter are the heat transfers
through the building envelope (walls, roof, ﬂoor, foundation) and the inﬁltration of cold air into the
building. Heat is needed to bring the inﬁltrating air up to the inside temperature.
498
Chapter 12 Special topics

In Chapter 3, we discussed steady-state heat transfer through walls and included convection at the
wall surfaces in our calculations. This information can be used to determine the heat transfers through
the building envelope. We deﬁned an overall heat transfer coefﬁcient U by the relation
q ¼ UA DT
(12.110)
where q is the heat ﬂow through the wall, U is the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient, A is the cross-
sectional area of the wall, and DT is the temperature difference across the wall.
The inﬁltration part of the heating load can be estimated from the relation
q ¼ rocpoðACHÞðVÞðTi  ToÞ
(12.111)
where
ro ¼ density of the air at the outside design condition

lbm = ft3
cpo ¼ specific heat of the infiltrating air ðBtu = lbm FÞ
V ¼ air volume of the building

ft3
Ti and To ¼ inside and outside design temperatures ðFÞ
ACH ¼ assumed number of air changes per hour
The inﬁltration ACH value ranges from about 0.2 for a tight new construction house to about 2 for
an old leaky house. Perhaps, a good value to use is 0.9 if details on the particular house are not known.
The degree-day method is useful for estimating the energy needed for heating a house and also for
evaluating the energy impact of potential remodels. This is illustrated in Example 12.13.

Example 12.13
Estimated energy usage of a house
Problem
A one-story house located in Syracuse, NY, is rectangular and 30 feet by 60 feet. The walls are 8 feet high. The house has
eight vinyl, double-pane insulated windows. Three are 2400 by 6000, three are 3000 by 6000, and two are 3000 by 48". There are
three exterior steel doors. One is 3000 by 8000, one is 3600 by 8000, and one is a patio door 7200 by 80". The exterior walls are T-
111 wood siding, 5/800 thick. The ﬂoor is 3/400 thick plywood with wood laminate ﬂooring. The roof is asphalt shingles. The
walls are 2  4 with R-11 insulation. The ceiling has 2  6 joists with R-19 insulation The ﬂoor has 2  8 joists with R-19
insulation. The ﬂoor is elevated from the ground and open to the outside environment. The furnace is oil-ﬁred and has an
efﬁciency of about 0.75.
(a) If the cost of oil is $ 3.10/gallon, estimate the annual heating cost for the house.
(b) The homeowner is considering adding R-19 of insulation to the ceiling to bring it to R-38. The cost of the insulation
is $ 30 for a 1500  39.2 ft roll. Estimate the energy cost savings and payback period if this is done.
Solution
(a) From Table 12.5, the recommended outside design temperature for Syracuse is 2.9 F. We will use an inside design
temperature of 72 F.
We ﬁrst look at the heat load of the windows and doors. From an Internet search, a typical U value for vinyl double-pane
insulating windows is 0.3. For the steel exterior doors, a typical U value is 0.27.
The total area for the windows is
Awindows ¼ ð3Þð24  60Þ þ ð24  60Þð30  48Þ þ ð3Þð30  60Þ
¼ 12600 in2 

The design heat load for the windows is
q ¼ UAwindowsðTi  ToÞ ¼ ð0:3Þð87:5Þð72  2:9Þ ¼ 1814 Btu=h
The total area for the doors
Adoors ¼ ð30  80Þ þ ð36  80Þ þ ð72  80Þ ¼ 11040 in2 

1 ft2= 144 in2
¼ 76.7 ft2
The design heat load for the doors is
q ¼ UAdoorsðTi  ToÞ ¼ ð0:27Þð76:7Þð72  2:9Þ ¼ 1431 Btu=h
Now let us look at the walls.
The gross wall area is ð8Þð30 þ 60 þ 30 þ 60Þ ¼ 1440 ft2. Subtracting the window and door areas, we have the net
wall area.
Awalls ¼ 1440  87.5  76.7 ¼ 1276 ft2
For a quick estimate of the design heat load for the walls, we will neglect the details of the wall construction and assume
that the wall area consists only of the R-11 insulation. (Note: This is really not a bad initial approach as the insulation is,
usually by far, the major component of the thermal resistance. We are neglecting the conduction through the studs and
assuming that there is insulation in the stud area. The actual heat ﬂow through the wall will be a little larger than we calcu-
late as the conduction through the studs is greater than the conduction through the insulation. On the other hand, we are
neglecting the decrease in heat ﬂow due to the added resistance of the siding and the convection. We thus have two
opposing factors that somewhat cancel each other out.) We will make the same assumption for the ﬂoor and ceiling.
For the walls,
q ¼ UAwallðTi  ToÞ ¼ Awall
Rwall
ðTi  ToÞ ¼ 1276

For the ﬂoor,
q ¼ UAfloorðTi  ToÞ ¼ Afloor
Rfloor
ðTi  ToÞ ¼ 1800
19 ð72  2:9Þ ¼ 6546 Btu=h
The ceiling has the same heat transfer as the ﬂoor.

Chapter 12 Special topics

The total heat transfer through the building’s envelope is thus
qenvelope ¼ 1814 þ 1431 þ 8016 þ 6546 þ 6546 ¼ 24353 Btu=h
The other major heat usage is due to the inﬁltration. This is calculated from Eq. (12.111).
q ¼ rocpoðACHÞðVÞðTi  ToÞ
(12.111)
We will assume that ACH ¼ 0.9. The volume of the building is V ¼ (60) (30) (8) ¼ 14,400 ft3.
At the outside temperature of 2.9 F, ro ¼ 0:086 lbm = ft3 and cpo ¼ 0:239Btu = lbm F.
The heat usage for the inﬁltration is then
q ¼ rocpoðACHÞðVÞðTi  ToÞ ¼ ð0:086Þð0:239Þð0:9Þð14400Þð72  2:9Þ ¼ 18407 Btu=h
The total heat loss qL ¼ 24353 þ 18407 ¼ 42760 Btu = h.
Using the degree-day equation, Eq. (12.109), the annual consumption of oil is estimated to be

Annual heating cost ¼ 723 gallons=yr  $3.10=gallon ¼ $2241=yr
The annual heating cost is estimated at $ 2240.
(b) If R-19 insulation is added to the ceiling to get R-38, the new heat transfer for the ceiling will be
q ¼ Aceiling

ðTi  ToÞ ¼ 1800

Adding the insulation will reduce the heating load for the ceiling by 6546  3273 ¼ 3273 Btu/hr. The new load will be
42,760  3273 ¼ 39,487 Btu/hr. The new oil consumption, using Eq. (12.109), is

It is estimated that adding the ceiling insulation will result in an energy cost savings of about $ 172 per year and that the
payback period will be about 6.4 years.
(Note: The given $ 30 cost of the package of insulation is material cost alone. No installation cost is included. Thus, the 6.4
year payback period is based on the homeowner adding the insulation by him/herself. If someone else does it and there are
installation costs, then the payback period will increase.)
The degree-day method can also be used to determine energy needed for cooling a building [31].
Many different methods are now available to estimate energy usage of buildings [32]. Commercial
software is also available to compute energy usage [33].

will have R-19 insulation. There will be an attic space for storage, and the attic ﬂoor will have
R-38 insulation.
(a) Estimate the design heat load for the building, considering heat ﬂows through the
building envelope and inﬁltration.
(b) Study possible heating systems for the building. Consider portable propane, kerosene,
and electric heaters. Using the Internet, determine current fuel prices and estimate the
annual heating costs for the three possible options. Select the heating option you will use.
(c) Using material costs from local box stores, estimate the cost of constructing the cabin,
assuming that you will be building the cabin yourself. Also estimate the cost of the cabin
if you use a contractor for the construction.
