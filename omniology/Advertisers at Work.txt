Introduction
In 1984, Bart Cummings published The Benevolent Dictators: Interviews with 
Advertising Greats (Crain Books). In that book, Cummings interviewed eigh­
teen of the most inﬂuential people in the advertising industry. We see these 
icons of advertising—people like Bill Bernbach, David Ogilvy, and Emerson 
Foote—as heroes and luminaries. Indeed, they light our way to the future 
of advertising. Cummings called his book, The Benevolent Dictators. Why? He 
explained that for many of these leaders, their word was law. And as for the 
benevolent aspect? There is no shortage of talent in the advertising business. 
No shortage of brilliance. But some are not just brilliant. They are also good, 
kind, fair, understanding, empowering, and dedicated. Despite the diversity 
of the interviewees, Cummings described them as self-conﬁdent leaders 
who didn’t seek out the role of leader and, importantly, as people who truly 
believed in advertising.
The eighteen people represented in Advertisers at Work are unique in their 
beginnings, roles, and views of the industry and, like Cummings’ advertis­
ing greats, they believe in advertising. At some critical juncture, what Doug 
Fidoten referred to during his interview as an inﬂection point, they chose to 
make a difference in the ﬁeld of advertising.
Did they know they’d end up in advertising? Overwhelmingly, the response 
is no. Fate took a role. Many were inﬂuenced by someone who ultimately 
served in the role of mentor. Jayanta Jenkins, David Oakley, and Doug 
Fidoten in particular share rich stories of the inﬂuential people who played a 
role in changing their lives. They and many others in the book then chose to 
mentor up-and-comers. For example, many of the interviewees offer career 
guidance. Luke Sullivan’s entire interview can be viewed as career advice to 
young creatives. Kristen Cavallo and Ellen Steinberg speak to what it is like 
to be women leaders in the ﬁeld. Jayanta Jenkins encourages young African 
Americans to consider the wealth of opportunities available in the industry.
Everyone featured in this book stepped up to ﬁnd the career they dreamed 
of, to be challenged, to identify a place they’d long to go each day and con­
tribute. They ﬁnd advertising the perfect playground—a congenial yet serious 
place to create, inﬂuence, have fun, and make a difference. Time and time 
again those interviewed emphasized their love of the ﬁeld, passion for the 
x

work, and enthusiasm for greeting each new project. Though each and every 
person represented in this book works incredibly long hours, they also can’t 
imagine doing anything else. Kristen Cavallo shared her amazement at her 
good fortune, even though she initially took a pay cut to work in advertising. 
Others acknowledged the incredulous feeling that they could be paid and 
paid well to do work that was quite simply so much fun.
The advertising industry is a different beast than it was in the days leading up 
to The Benevolent Dictators and depicted by programs like Mad Men and even 
documentaries such as Art & Copy.
How is it different?
1)	 Rigid organizational structures are dissolving. 
Mad Men and Art & Copy expressed the days when 
the structure of agencies were fairly well repre­
sented by the departments of account management, 
creative, and media. At the core, perhaps these are 
still the primary tasks, but without doubt, the roles 
have expanded with the prevalence of digital media. 
The role of creative technologist is evidence of this 
shift. And importantly, particularly for creative work, 
these roles are not linear. For decades now, art direc­
tors and copywriters have worked together from 
ideation through to production. This shift highlights 
the change in the role of technology in advertising as 
well as the challenge in overcoming the silos. This is 
a theme that resonates throughout many interviews, 
including those of Kristen Cavallo, Susan Credle, and 
Edward Boches. Jim Russell gives us a deep view of 
the role of technology in agencies.
2)	 Holding companies rule the industry. Avid 
watchers of Mad Men know that the Sterling Cooper 
agency was bought by a holding company in the third 
season. Ownership limited the decisions the leader­
ship could make. Ultimately, the limitations imposed 
by the holding company spurred the major players to 
launch out on their own. Once upon a time, agencies 
were truly run from the vision of their leadership. 
Today, four holding companies (the Interpublic Group 
of Companies, the Omnicom Group, the Publicis 
Groupe, and WPP) control much of the global indus­
try. Holding companies set corporate strategy, direct 
xi

collaborative relationships among agencies within 
the corporation, and dictate operational and ﬁscal 
management of their agencies.
	
The advertisers featured in this book represent 
both agencies within holding company families and 
independents, as well as one holding company. Anne 
Bologna represented MDC Partners, a Toronto-
based holding company that owns Crispin Porter + 
Bogusky (CP+B). Mullen (Edward Boches and Kristen 
Cavallo) and The Martin Agency (Mike Hughes) are 
brands within the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
Leo Burnett (Susan Credle) is a part of the Publicis 
Groupe. TBWA/Chiat/Day ( Jayanta Jenkins) is part of 
Omnicom Group. Dentsu America (Doug Fidoten) is 
a part of the Dentsu Group. Others work in agen­
cies that have retained or reclaimed their indepen­
dence, including Wieden+Kennedy (Craig Allen), 
Cramer-Krasselt (Marshal Ross), and McKinney (Ellen 
Steinberg and Jim Russell). Independent, small creative 
shops are also represented in the book (Chris 
Raih of Zambezi, David Oakley of BooneOakley, 
Ryan O’Hara Theisen and Jonathan Rosen of Lucky 
Branded Entertainment, and Eric Kallman of Barton 
F. Graf 9000). Marshall Ross provides insight into the 
challenges facing agencies that compete as part of a 
holding company.
3)	 Advertising is much more than print ads and 
TV commercials.  Advertising as a communication 
medium isn’t as straightforward as it once was. It can 
go beyond a standard print ad or broadcast commer­
cial. Advertising today can encompass both experi­
ences and messages. Even among messages, it may be 
short-form or long-form ﬁlm, text only, even an activ­
ity. What’s more, the messages (or experiences) may 
be shared anywhere, anytime. Ultimately, advertising 
is ideas regardless of the media involved. This theme 
is explored in the interviews of Mike Hughes, John 
Zhao, Ryan O’Hara Theisen and Jonathan Rosen, Eric 
Kallman, and Craig Allen.
4)	 Awards are still important. There are many 
awards sought after in the industry, such as Cannes 
xii

Lions, One Show Pencils, Clios, Addys, and Efﬁes. 
The interviewees and their agencies hold many of 
these awards. Mike Hughes discusses the role awards 
can play in driving the work of creatives, and Susan 
Credle explains in her interview how her team uses 
Leo Burnett’s HumanKind scale to evaluate and 
judge the quality and potential of their ideas. Though 
awards aren’t the only measure of an idea’s suc­
cess, they are critical to recognizing the value and 
inﬂuence of ideas. They are important to agencies 
as recruitment tools for both top talent and new 
clients.
5)	 Consumers have power. We can’t simply interrupt 
them and expect them to care about our message. 
We have to offer them something of value. To some 
extent this is relevant to point 3, but even without 
the experience or the message or the medium, we 
must recognize that consumers are co-creators of 
our brand. Chris Raih embraces this theme in his 
discussion of passion brands.
	
Those working in the ﬁeld of branded entertain­
ment—communication whose main purpose is to 
entertain the audience rather than differentiate a 
brand, but which is overtly branded—John Zhao, 
Ryan O’Hara Theisen, and Jonathan Rosen, empha­
size the need to offer valuable content if brands 
wish to earn time with consumers. John Zhao 
explains the challenge he faces today as he strives 
to be relevant to audiences in a world so crowded 
by content from a variety of sources. Ryan O’Hara 
Theisen and Jonathan Rosen expand on John’s view 
with their contention that advertising must serve the 
consumer—and by that they literally mean serve the 
consumer of the advertising—and not just the prod­
uct’s consumer. Their views add credence to the view 
that advertising can no longer simply push products 
via an advert. Instead, it must add value to the con­
sumer, and that value is likely in the form of enter­
tainment, and speciﬁcally branded entertainment.
	
Branded entertainment is actually not a new concept 
in the industry. When television programming was in 
xiii

its early stages of development, brands like Proctor & 
Gamble sponsored programs of interest to its target 
audience. Today’s soap operas are a byproduct of 
this kind of sponsorship. We are perhaps destined to 
return to this model as consumers seek high-quality, 
relevant programming, and brands seek to play a 
meaningful role in consumers’ lives. Yet, the model 
will differ because audiences seek different forms 
of entertainment. For instance, entertainment may 
be sought online or ofﬂine and of varying lengths 
and genres. Branded entertainment as a niche of 
the advertising industry focuses on the provision 
of entertainment, sponsored, of course, by relevant 
brands. Ultimately, though, the success of branded 
entertainment, like award-winning advertising, is 
based on the story told.
	
Doug Fidoten shares the importance of storytelling, 
a theme that also arises in the interviews from Mike 
Hughes and Susan Credle. Many agencies developed 
in a time reverent to newspaper as the king of print 
and television as the king of broadcast. These days 
it’s not uncommon to hear people anticipating the 
demise of traditional media and consequently the 
supporting advertising. Eric Kallman and Craig Allen 
take issue with such predictions, suggesting that 
there will always be a role for short-form ﬁlms dis­
tributed via broadcast venues.
6)	 The ad world is the world. It’s global. Audiences 
are exposed to messages from a variety of sources 
and origins. Brands pursue globally dispersed mar­
kets. Advertising is a cultural expression of mean­
ing. When we seek to expand beyond our cultural 
boundaries, we must do so with an understanding 
of the culture we target. This is a challenge. Chris 
Raih, Craig Allen, and Jayanta Jenkins give vivid depic­
tions of what it means to develop global advertising 
campaigns.
Everyone interviewed shares their personal stories, fears, challenges, 
­successes, and insights for those of us who wish to learn from their experi­
ences. Their openness and willingness to share made this project possible.

Chris Raih
Co-Founder and Managing Director 
Zambezi
Hailing from Minnesota, Chris Raih spent his early advertising days at Fallon 
Minneapolis, where he cut his teeth on accounts like United Airlines and BMW. 
He then joined Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, where he was a key account player 
for Nike and met creative partner Brian Ford. In 2006, at the age of 28, Raih 
co-founded Venice, California–based creative agency Zambezi (www.zambezi-la.
com), with nothing more than a cell phone and a Gmail account. Since its begin­
ning, Zambezi, a full-service agency focused on passion brands, has tripled in size, 
and opened an ofﬁce in Shanghai, China. Its client roster includes Champs Sports, 
vitaminwater, and the LA Lakers, among others. In 2011, Advertising Age 
awarded Zambezi the title of “Small Agency of the Year-West Region.”
Tracy Tuten: Chris, how did you ﬁnd your way into advertising? Did you 
grow up wanting to work in the ﬁeld?
Chris Raih: Actually, I was always excited and intrigued by the notion of 
mass communication. Growing up, I dreamed of being a journalist. Speciﬁcally 
I daydreamed as a young boy of being a writer for Sports Illustrated. I was the 
kid who read every page of each issue of Sports Illustrated. I literally have read 
every issue from the age of seven to today—and I just turned thirty-four 
recently. Still to this day, I have Sports Illustrated on my nightstand. I love the 
idea of telling stories and communicating from a journalistic perspective and 
always felt an attraction toward the news media.

In college, I was a print journalism major, and I wrote for the school paper 
as a columnist. Then, the summer before my junior year or my senior year, 
I ended up with an internship at an ad agency, a dynamite ad agency called 
Fallon in Minneapolis, where I grew up. Truthfully, it came at the right time 
for me. When I saw the creativity and the spark that was happening at the 
agency, my excitement and enthusiasm for communications really went 
to the next level. Ultimately, that was the ﬁrst big fork in the road for me. 
I moved more toward the creative side and away from the who, what, when, 
where, and why constraints of written journalism and news media. Once I 
had gotten a taste of advertising during that internship, I felt a strong pull 
to pursue it, which ultimately led to my ﬁrst job out of school as a young 
account executive at Fallon.
Tuten: Did your past interest in sports journalism affect your development 
into advertising for passion brands?1
Raih: Yes, I was fortunate to tap into that passion, and I still do on a day-to-
day basis. I played some small-time college basketball and I coached junior high 
teams even into my adult life. I deﬁnitely come from a sports family. At our 
agency, Zambezi, we deﬁnitely have a pedigree in sports marketing. We love 
working with sports and entertainment-related clients—it’s our niche.
Tuten: How did your past experiences help or hurt your rise to your cur­
rent position?
Raih: When I worked at Fallon as an account guy, I was fortunate enough to 
have the opportunity to work on some tough pieces of business. I worked 
on United Airlines during 9/11. Our client was a direct and immediate victim 
of the 9/11 attacks, and it created a really force majeure situation across the 
board. We, the agency, were keepers of the United Airlines brand. I will tell 
you that is a tough brief.2
Imagine—someone just took your product and used that product to kill 
thousands of people. How are you going to go market yourself and tell 
stories three weeks later? Really tough brief. I was really nothing more than 
a young whippersnapper on those teams, but I worked with highly intelligent 
1 A passion brand is one that incites a high level of involvement, commitment, and 
engagement from its target audience. Many passion brands are tied to interests consum­
ers tend to feel passionate about, such as sports, music, and art. The overarching com­
monality among passion brands is that they relate to their respective target audiences 
through a shared vision rather than on the basis of a functional need.

agency.

and global-minded people who were able to help craft some awesome 
stories and help lift the brand out of the aftermath of 9/11.
The reason I tell this story is to say that I was toughened up at a young 
age in terms of what kinds of challenges you can face at an ad agency. 
I also [worked on] BMW while at Fallon, and then ultimately got a job at 
Wieden+Kennedy and moved to Portland.
I would deﬁnitely say that for a twenty-four-year-old guy, working at 
Wieden+Kennedy on the Nike business was a dream job. I worked there for 
three years, and I ended up becoming the lead account manager on the Nike 
basketball business. The basketball business is kind of the crown jewel of 
Nike. Obviously, Nike is a huge sports empire, and basketball is the highest-
margin product. I was fortunate to work with incredible people all the way 
from the ad agency side to the brand side, and to the athletes themselves. 
That’s also where I met my partner, Brian Ford.
Brian was a copywriter at Wieden back in the day and became the lead 
writer for the Nike basketball business. He and I made up the core of the 
agency team for Nike basketball. Brian and I had a great relationship right 
from the beginning. We complemented each other well.
In mid-2006, after several years of working together, we started to discuss 
the idea of opening a shop. We both shared the theory that it was possible 
to create impactful work without an apparatus of hundreds and hundreds 
of people. We asked ourselves, “Could we do it more efﬁciently? Could we 
work with brands in a more nimble way? Could we move as quickly as con­
sumers were moving? Speciﬁcally, as quickly as young consumers? If we were 
quick and nimble, could we still tell really compelling branded stories with 
smaller groups of people?” This is something we were drawn to and I was 
always drawn to autonomy.
Some investors came out of the woodwork at the right time for us, and 
Brian and I were able to take the leap and move from Portland to Los 
Angeles. This was almost ﬁve years ago this month.
Tuten: What’s it like opening your own agency?
Raih: It has been scary, frustrating, exciting, wonderful, and fulﬁlling and 
everything in between. This has been another huge leap for me person­
ally, and in the development in my career. In terms of a learning curve, it is 
almost straight up and down as you go from the cozy conﬁnes of a best-of-
breed agency like Wieden to starting your ﬁrm. I’m sitting there in Brian’s 
apartment on day one with a Gmail account and a cell phone. We’re saying, 
“All right, I guess we had better go ﬁnd some clients.”

We deﬁnitely learned resourcefulness and ingenuity. We learned to never 
victimize ourselves. At the beginning it was all about hustling. I had to learn 
the sales side of this business. I knew how to push ad campaigns out the 
door. I knew how to facilitate communication between all parties and keep 
clients happy. I could get things done, on time and on budget, and at a really 
high creative level. I had been trained how to do those things. But I had 
never been trained on business development or anything that would con-
stitute the sales side of things. These were things I had to learn and learn 
quickly.
I am happy to say that through 2006, 2007, and 2008, we were building a 
really nice trajectory. During the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008 and 2009, a lot 
of things went south for many—not only in marketing and advertising, but 
across industries. We were working as a small agency with a number of mid-
size clients who could and in some cases did pull their marketing in-house. 
Some clients put work on hold. The president of one of the brands that we 
work with called me in, like, November 2008, and said, “Hey Chris. Buddy, 
you know I love you guys, but we are pulling in our sails and we are getting 
ready for a storm in ﬁrst and second quarter of 2009.”
When we lost some business, we contracted a bit from a stafﬁng perspective 
and deﬁnitely took some lumps, but I am happy to say we survived it. More 
than survived it. Fast-forward two years and we have been able to get back 
on the same growth trajectory. We are in a place I had hoped we would be. 
We have thirty-six employees in our Venice [California] ofﬁce and another 
three in our new Shanghai ofﬁce. We just opened the Shanghai ofﬁce this 
week.
Just recently, Bridget [Bulters, communications manager] and I were in 
Denver, Colorado, for the Advertising Age Small Agency Awards. I am very 
proud to say that Zambezi was awarded 2011 Agency of the Year for the 
West region. We are deﬁnitely starting to get some recognition and we are 
starting to get some heat and momentum as a brand—as our own brand. As 
an agency, we are moving from a regional to a national and even an interna-
tional proﬁle.
Where we are now is where I had hoped we would be in late 2009. The 
global ﬁnancial crisis set us back a bit, but probably in the long term served 
us well because it toughened us up. I see for myself that it toughened me 
up even more than any experience prior. It acutely helped me to develop a 
sense of resourcefulness, resilience, and ingenuity. It honed my basic instincts 
for business.
The agency is named after the Zambezi, or Bull Shark, one of the most 
infamous, resourceful, and adaptable creatures on earth, swimming between

freshwater and saltwater in the Zambezi River, which ﬂows through East 
Africa. It has become the muse for our logos and agency personality with 
our employees all coming to consider themselves “sharks.” This actually 
seems pretty funny to us since we are all really nice people. A common 
refrain around the ofﬁce is, “life is a river.” It means you never know what is 
around the next bend. You never know what is going to happen. It isn’t that 
we are ready for everything, but we are never shocked by anything. I would 
say that it has been rewarding and fulﬁlling and a great ride, and I look for­
ward to what the future holds.
Tuten: Would you say are Zambezi’s core values?
Raih: A couple of things are emerging as tenets of our agency and its brand. 
We have been able to prove ourselves to be able to work efﬁciently and 
collaboratively. Many agencies, speciﬁcally the big, established agencies, are 
often very hierarchical. It is very clear that unless you are a creative and, 
even more likely, a creative director, it is not your place to offer up ideas. We 
prefer to operate as more of a market. We are like a market of ideas being 
exchanged. An open bazaar of ideas. An idea exchange. We say the best idea 
wins even if that comes from the intern. If it’s a great idea and stands up to 
internal rigor, then we will go present it to the client. If that idea sells, then 
the contributor will get the credit.
We are collaborative internally and we try to be collaborative with our 
brand partners as well. We love our clients! They are great partners. They 
are the reason we come to work every day. We actually presume high levels 
of intelligence, ability, and marketing proclivity on the part of our clients. 
We expect that they know their brand very, very well. We know they are a 
valuable resource. This has helped us to do great, provocative, relevant work 
for our brand clients. At Zambezi, we don’t think you necessarily have to be 
bruised and bloodied on both sides in order to get a campaign out the door. 
In so many agencies, their reels3 may be undeniably good. But at the same 
time, you know there may have been some inﬁghting between the clients and 
the agency in the production of that work. We feel you can work together 
and pull in the same direction, and I think that has served us well. We are 
true partners for our clients.
3 Reel is a term that refers to the compilation of ﬁnished broadcast ads an agency or indi­
vidual has produced. Similar to the use of the term “book” in reference to a portfolio, it 
is a holdover term from the time when work was shown literally on audio or ﬁlm reels. 
Today, work, whether that of a reel or a book, is presented via digital media.

Another core value concerns victimization. We don’t want our people to 
ever victimize themselves. There are so many obstacles that arise on a day-
to-day basis and to succumb to those daily obstacles would be detrimental 
to our people and our business. When our people face issues, we ask that 
they not simply complain but come up with a solution. If they don’t like 
something, we tell them not to be a victim of circumstance. If there are 
conditions that are not conducive to doing great work, then suggest a way 
to work around it.
Our credentials deck actually includes a slide with some of these bullet 
points. Those are the big ones . . . collaborate internally, collaborate with our 
clients, do great work, come up with solutions and not problems. You can be 
nice and still do great work.
Tuten: Zambezi has been in the news a lot lately with the award for Agency 
of the Year and the press over the smartwater viral video. Can you tell us 
about the viral sensation?
Raih: There was an interview published yesterday about the project 
Zambezi did for smartwater. The project involved a video featuring Jennifer 
Aniston. We gave the video a cheeky title—“Jen Aniston Sex Tape.” If you’ve 
seen the piece, you know that the video is not that. The title is used ironi­
cally. It is used as a poke at what it takes to create a viral phenomenon. The 
title was simply another layer to the joke. But, of course, in this interview, 
the title is quoted at least ﬁve times. “Chris said sex tape blah, blah, blah, sex 
tape, blah, blah.” Yesterday, my mom reads the interview and calls me say­
ing, “Your grandmother is reading this!” I’m like, “Mom, it is irony. Don’t you 
know irony?”
Tuten: How do you approach new business development for Zambezi?
Raih: That is a good question, almost a two-parter. Part one is methodol­
ogy for business development. Part two is what the criteria are of the kinds 
of clients we could really make hay with. What kind of clients are we after? 
That’s pretty straightforward. We use the phrase “passion brands” for the 
kind of work we are after. Warren Buffett says, “Stick to what you know.” 
Our staff is very youth driven. We are very diverse. We are multicultural and 
we are all ex-jocks. We are all into music and sports and entertainment. We 
do our best around brands that are consumer discretionary brands largely 
targeted to Millennials4—your sneakers, your favorite energy drink, your 
4 Millennials are people born in the 1980s and 1990s.

favorite headphones, your snowboard, your favorite NBA team, your out­
door sports or action sports.
We are not chasing ﬁnancial institutions. We stick to our lane. Typically, those 
are brands for which the purchase decisions come from the heart as much 
as the head. These are brands that produce things young consumers keep on 
their person on a day-to-day basis. As I said—sneakers, video games, energy 
drinks, and electronics. If you walked ten feet out of our front door onto 
Venice Beach boardwalk and grabbed any seventeen-year-old, these are the 
brands you’d ﬁnd on that person. Any teen would have probably three of 
these products on his person at any point in time. Just stuff that he or she is 
passionate about and passionate about daily—those are the kinds of brands 
that we do the best with. The halo over these brands is passion.
Now about the ﬁrst part of your question—about our methodology for 
creating needs and getting us into client ofﬁces. It takes a number of differ­
ent forms. Back to the notion of being nice guys and being good partners 
with our brand clients. It has born a lot of fruit for us in so far as many of 
our clients currently have provided referrals. These days, marketing managers 
jump around from company to company quite a bit. I think I read that the 
average CMO5 life span is under two years at any given company—just one 
anecdotal statistic. It is a transient business in a relatively small industry. It’s a 
village in a way. We don’t want to burn any bridges.
These days we ﬁnd that somebody will shift to a new company and give us 
a shout. That’s a new thing for us. It took a few years with a lot of phone 
calling, a lot of hustling, a lot of chasing down the third-party consultants to 
barge into pitches.6
We continue to be the small guy in a lot of our pitches. We are often the 
dark-horse candidate. We have gone up against some of the biggest and best 
agencies in the world and I am happy to say that every now and then we are 
able to knock them on their ass. These days we’d rather get a referral than 
hustle so much.
Methodology is always an evolving thing. At the end of the day, we just want 
to get in the room with companies that we consider to be passion brands.

for the business. Sometimes, determining which agencies should be considered depends 
on a recommendation by a third-party consultant.

Tuten: What’s a typical day like for you?
Raih: On the personal side, I have a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-
old son at home. They are up bright and early. My wife and I kind of have a 
negotiation at 5:45 each morning as to who is going to get up with them 
when they start squawking. Today it was me, which has brought on the need 
for strong coffee. Let’s see. A typical day is that I am always checking e-mail 
immediately when I wake up. I check e-mail as I watch Sesame Street with the 
kids. This morning I knocked out about an hour of e-mail. We have clients in 
China, and typically there are a dozen or so e-mails from them when I wake 
up. We also have a number of East Coast clients and they are all up early. 
Each morning, I at least get the mission-critical e-mails answered before I 
even brush my teeth. Then I will make my way in. We don’t have any kind of 
strict 9:00 to 6:00 schedule here at Zambezi, but usually I am at the ofﬁce 
by 8:30. If the gods be good, I usually ﬁnd about an hour or so to do house­
keeping and organization, and then typically start a barrage of meetings or 
calls.
I think one challenge, personally speaking, is getting my head around our geo­
graphic expansion. It is simply no longer realistic for me to be aware of every 
moving piece of every campaign and every piece of business that we have. 
I am learning to be selective as a manager in terms to the kinds of situations 
that I need to insert myself and involve myself in. Those are typically more 
of a macro problem instead of a micro. If I am too focused on the creative 
rotation for this print ad, it is not necessarily the best thing for our company. 
Now if we have a particular brief that is a real sticky thing and we can’t quite 
solve it or, God forbid, we have a dissatisﬁed client—those are things that 
it does behoove the company for me to get involved in. I am learning what 
those things are. All day long I am being selective.
Several times a day, I have to choose between this meeting or answering that 
e-mail, or taking this phone call, or reaching out to this person. It’s like triage 
in terms of the things I take on. I do try to cross-train between the six or 
seven retained clients we do have and the ﬁve or six different departments 
we have. For instance, I make an appearance in a production meeting, go 
hang out with the studio designers, sit and work on deck with the strategic 
planners, go to lunch with creative directors, go get a beer with the senior 
account folks. It is a little bit like trying to clone myself.
Tuten: How involved are you in the creative work? Do you miss being more 
a part of the work given the time you spend on management and leadership?
Raih: Initially that was the spark between me and Brian. I think Brian has 
been taken aback—in a good way—as he sees my appetite and ﬂuency with

creative. Even as a mid-level account guy at Wieden+Kennedy, I had a strong 
opinion on the work. Truth be told, we would kind of try to work on the 
creative together.
It is not that I miss it because I stay involved. I pick my spots to be heard and 
to put my ﬁnger on some things. But yes, there are times I wish I could be 
involved with every single little piece that we are doing.
I’ll tell you something my uncle taught me. I was home for Thanksgiving or 
something a couple of years ago. I asked him, “How do you decide what to 
take on or what to tackle?” I am going to butcher this relatively slick piece 
of advice he gave me, but I will do my best. He basically said, “Think about 
a bull’s-eye. In the center of that bull’s-eye is where you bill out at a high 
hourly level.” Not to make it all about dollars and cents, but basically what 
he was saying is that as a founder, I am the center of this bull’s-eye. I need to 
spend as much time in that bull’s-eye to further the company’s interests. The 
further I get out in those concentric circles, the less I am serving the best 
interest of the company. That is something that I took to heart. I try to stay 
in that bull’s-eye as much as possible while not becoming detached from the 
front line.
Usually about once a day I catch myself weighing in on what kind of coffee 
mugs we need to buy for the kitchen, or what kinds of ﬁcus trees we need 
for the lobby. I just catch myself and smile and think about my uncle. He is 
right. It is good advice.
Tuten: Do you have any rituals that are important to your ability to work 
effectively?
Raih: One is like a mental exercise and one is a physical exercise. On the 
physical side, something we do a lot of in our ofﬁce is to just go outside. We 
are in Venice Beach, right on the boardwalk. We are literally ﬁfty feet from 
the sand. Here in LA, I will walk out to the beach a lot with Brian or whom­
ever or just by myself and take a deep breath and look at the waves for a 
second. When I try to not think about solutions so hard, sometimes the 
solutions come. Just by the physical movement of going out to the beach.
For the mental exercises, I’m usually stuck when a problem is a big, emo­
tional problem. I’m an ex-athlete. I am a highly competitive person. I tend to 
get emotional and passionate about things. At those times, you are not nec­
essarily thinking clearly. I am learning to take a deep breath and calm down 
in these situations. I try to wait before ﬁring off an e-mail in anger and so on. 
I try to think dispassionately and try to deconstruct the complex problem 
and into simple, pragmatic next steps. That is typically how you start to get 
unstuck.

Chapter 1 |  Chris Raih: Co-Founder and Managing Director, Zambezi

Tuten: Do you have a campaign that is a favorite? Something most meaning­
ful to you?
Raih: Let me paraphrase something Dan Wieden said. I was able to spend 
some time once with Dan Wieden. He is such a Hall of Famer in our indus­
try. He’s an amazing business person who has accomplished more than 
anybody in advertising, maybe ever. In addition, he’s the guy who wrote the 
line, “Just do it.” He has accomplished everything that he has accomplished 
and he’s still just a great guy. I remember sitting with him as a young account 
person at Wieden+Kennedy. We were with a bunch of folks working on the 
Nike business. I asked him this same question—what are you most proud of? 
What piece of work do you feel like, “Yes, we nailed it.” The answer he gave 
me frustrated me at the time, but as I’ve aged and have grown more with 
experience, I understand what he meant. I said, “Dan, what is your favorite 
campaign or favorite spot this agency has produced?” He basically demurred, 
answering, “The next one, the next one we get, the next brief we get.”
So my answer to this question is that the blank, white piece of paper is the 
one I am most excited about. The next one in the queue. I’d like to just 
plagiarize his answer right now versus going down memory lane or do a 
greatest hits kind of thing. I’ll say what Dan said: “My favorite campaign is the 
next one.”
Tuten: What is the next one?
Raih: We are developing work in China for our client, Li Nang. Li Nang is a 
sneaker giant. It’s the third-biggest sneaker brand in the world. The reason I 
say I am excited about it is that the project is like ten-fold the hardest thing 
we have ever done in terms of taking our expertise about youth, sports, 
and entertainment, and amplifying that in a foreign country where business 
gets done in a completely different way than here. It has forced us to really 
stretch outside of our comfort zone. We have work airing in China. It is far 
and away the hardest thing we have done. We’ve worked on it both night and 
day. We’re really proud of what our team and our clients have created.
Tuten: When you look around the industry, what’s most surprising to you?
Raih: There is a sea change when you look around the industry seemingly 
daily. You know, even a month ago, we would talk about QR codes7 and I 
would argue that QR codes are already passé. That is just one example of 
7 QR code is short for Quick Response code, a two-dimensional bar code used to house 
data that can be read with a reader using a smartphone or tablet.

how quickly tools and platforms and ways to tell stories are changing. We as 
an industry have been asked to be creative in the medium and now that is 
not enough. We need to be creative in the delivery of the message.
Tuten: With the nonstop news and industry developments, how do you stay 
up-to-date on what’s happening?
Raih: At Zambezi, we try to keep the collective IQ high. We have instituted 
a multiplatform, internal entity called Bites. On a weekly basis, we curate 
and distribute an HTML recap newsletter of the eight or ten most pertinent 
stories in marketing, sports entertainment, and tech. We distribute it to not 
only to our people, but also to our clients, production partners, and media 
partners. We distribute that once a week and then we get together once a 
month for a Bites immersion session. These sessions are mandatory, all-com­
pany meetings. They are a chance to put the pencils down and get away from 
computer screens.
Sometimes we meet off site or bring speakers in. We may go see an art 
exhibit or a show. We may do a show-and-tell session. For example, our 
most recent session was Friday. We had a couple of different things going on. 
Some of our creatives presented side projects. These were cheeky videos 
which brought the freaking house down. Lastly we did a kind of deep dive on 
media. Our media staffers presented on key terms, industry developments, 
new metrics, and that kind of thing. It was very well received.
Last month we went to the Tim Burton exhibit at the LACMA, the Los 
Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art, and sometimes we will go to a 
Dodger game or what have you. We typically parlay a Bites emerging session 
with two goals: team building and keeping our collective IQ high. My percep­
tion, and maybe I am blind to it, is that our staffers really love what we do 
with Bites. It is so sharp and it’s good enough that six months ago we started 
submitting it externally. Every client gets a copy of Bites from Zambezi, 
which underlines and speaks to being on the bleeding edge of what’s new 
and relevant in marketing, pop culture, technology, and sports entertainment.
Bites is branded by Zambezi, and it serves as tangible evidence that Zambezi 
is curious and hungry to know more. Bites hits the inbox of all of our clients 
all the way up to CMOs and CEOs.
I almost feel like I am beyond being surprised about stuff now. It rarely hap­
pens that I am shocked or feel I completely didn’t see something coming. 
Some of the things that jump out at me are especially related to marketing 
to young consumers. You can’t sell to today’s young consumers. You have to 
provoke them. We always try to be provocative in some way. The key word is 
relevance. We like to partner with brands that are relevant and our goal is to 

Chapter 1 |  Chris Raih: Co-Founder and Managing Director, Zambezi
12
make those brands even more relevant in terms of how consumers view the 
brands.
It used to be when an agency rolled out a campaign, that we were kind of 
guaranteed certain things like reach and frequency. Everything kind of took 
care of itself—knee bone connected to the hip bone and here come the 
sales. Now there are so many tools, choices, and opportunities to avoid or 
ignore paid media. To overcome this, the trend is to provoke and to try to 
create the belief in relevance around the brands you are working with.
The key is to really try to distill the problem and solutions. We are always 
after a good idea. A good idea is a good idea. With it, we can ﬁgure out what 
screen to put it on. A QR code is not a good idea. It is one potential arrow 
in the quiver. It is not an idea. Start with the idea. Then we will ﬁnd the right 
production partners to put it on the most pertinent screens.
Tuten: Give me an example of one of Zambezi’s great ideas.
Raih: I would say one piece that was pretty funny is our work with vitamin­
water. We worked with vitaminwater last fall on a fantasy football campaign. 
Fantasy football has become big business in the last ﬁve years or so. There 
are going to be like forty million people playing by this year and many of 
those are male consumers, eighteen to thirty-four, who are decently afﬂuent. 
That’s a pretty desirable audience. This audience is checking into fantasy 
football every single day from August through December, interfacing with 
their buddies. It’s become a loud market place. Budweiser, Procter & Gamble, 
Chevy . . . they all spend big in fantasy football.
vitaminwater wanted to try to steal some of that spotlight, really hijack 
some of the attention that was going on with fantasy football, but with a 
fraction of the ad spend. We had a couple of things going for us. We have a 
highly relevant athlete, Adrian Peterson, who is a star running back with the 
Minnesota Vikings. A year ago, he was probably the number-one overall pick 
among the fantasy drafts. We had him do the pitch for vitaminwater. The 
concept was freaking zany—basically that this athlete retained an attack-dog 
lawyer to try to sue fantasy guys who had Adrian on their team. He is like, 
“I am on your team. I ran the ball thirty-ﬁve times against the Bears. I got 
two bruised ribs and a sprained ankle and you win all the money in your fan­
tasy league with me. What is up with that? Where is my piece of the action?” 
This is obviously ridiculous because you and I know he makes millions of 
dollars a year to play football. This was very over-the-top, kind of cheeky.
We cast for the craziest actor we could ﬁnd and trust me, we found him! 
We got Gary Busey to play the lawyer. The net result in terms of the content 
was a very funny, high-octane, two-and-a-half-minute digital ﬁlm that was 

Advertisers at Work
13
aimed directly at the twenty-ﬁve-year-old fantasy guy. The ﬁlm talked about 
a speciﬁc ﬂavor, vitaminwater energy. A kind of very high-octane energy that 
is pure in vitaminwater. The piece itself was minimum branding, but maxi­
mum storytelling. When I compute the facts, we did this using almost no 
paid media. Nothing even close to the spending of Budweiser and P&G. With 
the provocative content and really strong social media engagement using 
Facebook and Twitter, the video became very well trafﬁcked. We were able 
to hijack the mindshare around fantasy football.
The day we released the video content, ESPN had its two-hour, kick-off 
fantasy special. ESPN aired the video in the special. I will never forget it. 
One of the best moments we could have dreamed of getting as ad folks 
and ESPN played the video in its entirety. All two-and-a-half minutes right 
there on ESPN at the beginning of the broadcast. They were like, “before we 
get started, this just came in from vitaminwater. These guys are crazy. Look 
at what content they put out. We have been watching it all day.” Then they 
opened the broadcast full screen. I can’t even imagine what a two-and-a-half-
minute spot would cost in that slot. Again, zero paid-media spent, but we got 
there simply by being very relevant and provocative.
Tuten: What lessons have you learned during your career that you’d like to 
share with those aspiring to the ﬁeld?
Raih: You should always be open to—not necessarily massive change in 
whatever your goals and dreams are—but be open to a circuitous route 
to get there. You never know what you may be able to see from the next 
vantage point.
I was in China a month or two ago. We were able to go out and hike the 
Great Wall. You think as you hike each section of the Wall—which is about 
half of a mile long—that the next section would be the end of it, yet it isn’t. 
The Wall is all built on rolling hills, and you can’t see the next one until you 
get to the guard tower. You can’t tell until the next section is right in front of 
you. I think that would be a message to young people: be open to what you 
are going to ﬁnd, be open to shifts, and be open to a line of development 
that isn’t always a straight line.
Tuten: What’s ahead for you and Zambezi?
Raih: As Brian and I discuss these kinds of things, we’ve realized some 
truths. First of all, we get out of bed every morning and we still have ﬂat 
bellies and sharp spears. We still have the same hunger we had on day one. 
We still have a keen since of urgency, just as we did on that ﬁrst day when 
we were sitting in Brian’s corporate apartment trying to ﬁgure out who was 
going to be our ﬁrst client. I would say in terms of goals, we are growing 

Chapter 1 | Chris Raih: Co-Founder and Managing Director, Zambezi

now but we want to protect the culture we’ve established here. We won’t 
grow beyond the point at which we can’t maintain the culture that we have 
tried so hard to establish. We round out at about ﬁfty people and everybody 
still likes coming into work. If we are able to maintain that at ﬁve hundred 
people, that is ﬁne too. We want to maintain the pride, the chemistry, and 
the culture that we have here.

Tracy Tuten: You recently moved from The Martin Agency to Mullen. 
What’s the transition been like for you?
Kristen Cavallo: I was just joking that I have only been here a few months 
and it feels like it has been ten years. It feels good. It feels like it’s been 
a lot longer—a lot longer. It was hard to leave The Martin Agency after 
fourteen years, but in some ways it was like coming home because Mullen 
was the ﬁrst agency I worked for. Mullen’s chief creative ofﬁcer is Mark 
Wenneker. I actually worked with him at the Martin Agency too—on the 
Saab account. Back then, I was the planner and he was the art director. He 
went to Goodby [Goodby, Silverstein, & Partners] for nine years and I stayed 
at Martin and then we reunited here. There were only two folks I didn’t 
know—the heads of media and account management. Everyone else I’d 
worked with at some point in my career.
Mullen is a more progressive agency today than when I was here years ago. 
The physical space is very different. Mullen used to have ofﬁces in Wenham 
and now we are downtown. The agency has been on such a growth spurt. 
About two hundred people [out of 375] have been hired in Boston in the 
last two years. The agency feels young and vibrant and has solid, digital skills. 
It feels forward leaning.
Tuten: You were with The Martin Agency for such a long time. How did this 
shift come about?
Cavallo: Initially, Joe Grimaldi [Mullen’s chief executive ofﬁcer] reached 
out to see if I had any recommendations for the role. We’ve stayed in touch 
over the years, so the call wasn’t unexpected when the role of chief strategy 
ofﬁcer came available. After a few discussions, I decided to throw my hat in 
the ring.
We toyed with the idea of my family moving to Boston and for various 
personal reasons that did not pan out. I withdrew from consideration for the 
job. I was really disappointed about it and I thought it just wasn’t in the cards. 
Then in February, Alex Leikikh [Mullen’s president] called back and said, “I 
am staring at Fast Company’s list of the top ten Most Innovative Marketing 
Companies in the country.” Mullen had made the list. He said, “It occurred to 
me that we are not being very innovative about this, so let’s start over. Let’s 
rewrite the rules and ﬁgure out a way to make this work.”
I thought, “How we can do this?” I have a fourteen-year-old son going into 
high school and a seven-year-old daughter going into second grade. I thought, 
“I don’t want to not be there for them and their activities.” The job requires 
that I manage twenty-ﬁve people in Boston. My husband and I discussed it 
and we came up with a proposal for me to spend three days and two nights 

Advertisers at Work
17
a week in Boston and four days and ﬁve nights a week in Richmond. Mullen 
said yes! So I usually ﬂy up Tuesdays and I ﬂy home Thursdays.
It is amazing I am able to still live in Virginia and keep my family unit tight. My 
parents live in Virginia, my in-laws live in Virginia, and my extended family live 
in Virginia and that way everyone was able to stay in a great family unit. I am 
able to come to work and be a chief strategy ofﬁcer and manage a team of 
rock stars and I feel enormously blessed. I feel happy that I work for people 
that didn’t let the traditional rules stop them. I feel enormously fortunate 
that I have a husband and kids, parents, and extended family who all said 
“we are here to help.” And I thank God every day for technology. Because 
if I didn’t have technology, this would not work. Whether I am Skyping or 
Facetiming with my kids, or Skyping or Facetiming with my co-workers, tech­
nology enables this whole thing to happen.
Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up want­
ing to work in the ﬁeld?
Cavallo: Heavens, no. I worked in sales and I got my undergraduate degree 
in business from James Madison University. I had been working for Clairol as 
a sales rep all through college. When I ﬁnished college, I really wanted to go 
into the marketing department in New York City. I asked my boss, “How do 
I get into the marketing department?” When I was in sales, I felt like I was 
on the front line with consumers. I would see people frustrated when they 
bought products that didn’t work or super happy when they bought prod­
ucts that made them look great. So much of their self-esteem is built into 
the products. I heard the pros, the cons, and the whys of every product in 
the line. Sales was the front line of consumer research.
I had all this great input to contribute about consumers, but I felt like I 
wasn’t being tapped to share that input. My boss said I could absolutely go to 
New York, but the requirement is an MBA. I struggled with it because I had 
just spent four years getting a degree in business and I didn’t have a desire to 
go back and get another one. But I decided to go for it. I did an accelerated 
program at George Mason University. It was a one-year program. I decided 
to major in something different since I had the marketing slant from under­
grad. I focused on statistics. With my masters, I felt like I was coming out 
with some form of added value, so to speak.
I moved to Boston after my MBA program and interviewed around with a 
bunch of great companies. In the process of networking, I was introduced 
to an ad agency by the name of Houston Efﬂer that had the Converse 
brand. At the time, I thought to myself, I am so not interested in advertis­
ing. My impression of advertising was like that of Melrose Place with Heather 

Chapter 2 |  Kristen Cavallo: Chief Strategy Officer, Mullen

Locklear. You know, with a lot of really short skirts and frivolous airheads. 
Then I went and interviewed. The agency was young and vibrant and fast-
paced.
I am an Army brat and I love change. Change feeds me. My fear is bore­
dom. Boredom stiﬂes me. I felt like this industry would feed my desires and 
squelch my fears. I almost took that job, but the next day I had another 
interview with an agency named Mullen. It was up in Wenham on the North 
Shore of Boston. It was located in this old monastery and it had kind of a 
Dynasty ﬂair for those who remember that show. Very regal and strong in 
conviction and spirit. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. I thought, “This is 
where I want to work.” I was hired to work on Timberland and BMW—two 
really strong brands. There was only one other planner, a guy by the name of 
Kevin Kolbe who came from Chiat/Day. He had great energy and experience, 
and really took me under his wing. I loved it.
My father refused to talk to me for about a month after that. He said I was 
the only person he knew who the higher my education went, the lower my 
salary went. I think my starting salary was $18,000 a year at Mullen with an 
MBA and I had left a job in sales making probably about $50,000. It was a 
pretty signiﬁcant cut, but I was so happy, very alive, and thriving in the chaos 
that is advertising. So I really just lucked into it. It was never really part of 
the plan.
Tuten: Do you think your background in sales helped you as you developed 
in advertising?
Cavallo: Deﬁnitely. Persuading somebody to back my judgment with their 
money is the heart of both sales and advertising. At this level, most of the 
agencies that we compete with are as capable as we are, and we are as 
capable as they. We all have good case studies. We all have great people. We 
all have the ability to hit the ball out of the park. Sometimes what makes 
the difference between winning and losing is a game of inches—one team 
being slightly more persuasive than the other. My sales experience deﬁnitely 
helped me hone that skill.
Tuten: Here’s the inevitable Mad Men question. Mad Men has reinforced 
some of the ad industry’s early stereotypes. Are any of the types of people 
and situations represented in the show still prevalent in the industry today?
Cavallo: Oh sure. I think Don Draper and his very focused perspective on 
creative is very much still true. The stereotypes represented in the show in 
terms of the positions are still true. Like the account guys being very focused 
on the clients’ point of view and the creative guys focused on the creative 
perspective and what will be award-winning—all that is still very true.

Advertisers at Work

The biggest shift in my mind is the role of women. Seeing Mad Men reminds 
me how far we’ve come.
Tuten: What advice do you have for women as we seek to advance?
Cavallo: Take yourself seriously, read, travel, be well-spoken. When you go 
into the room, take a seat alongside key decision makers. Believe that you 
belong there. If you don’t believe you belong there, or if you sit shyly on the 
sidelines, then you won’t be invited back.
Tuten: What’s it been like for you as a woman, working in the ﬁeld and 
working in positions of leadership? And how do you balance that with family 
time?
Cavallo: It can be difﬁcult to balance obligations. It is hard to be a work­
ing parent. There are times you leave vacation early for a pitch or times you 
leave work early for a game. For years, as a single mom, I tried to do it all 
myself to prove I was capable. But that was misguided. Doing something well 
matters more than doing it all. When I realized this truth, I asked my boss 
at Martin, Earl [Cox, Martin’s chief strategy ofﬁcer and partner], for help. 
I asked him for ﬂextime to work from home one day a week. Earl made it 
clear that he didn’t help me out of pity, but because he valued my contribu­
tion. I learned to accept actions like these not as symptoms of weakness, but 
as evidence of my worth.
When I was considering this job here at Mullen, I saw Sheryl Sandberg [chief 
operating ofﬁcer at Facebook] speak at TED.1 She spoke about the lack of 
women in C-suite jobs. I was surprised to hear her chide women for walking 
away from top jobs. She said that by doing so, we didn’t allow companies the 
chance to be progressive and contemporary in their approach.2 I took her 
advice to heart and that was a major reason I asked Mullen to consider my 
work schedule proposal. It’s working for me and for Mullen and for my fam­
ily. My kids and my husband and my family are my biggest cheerleaders.
There’s one other thing that comes to mind. This is from another TED talk. 
It was a talk by Madeleine Albright [former US Secretary of State]. She said, 
“Guilt is every woman’s middle name. Plenty of women asked me why I 
wasn’t in the carpool lane or told me I wasn’t prioritizing my kids. Is the

carpool lane the only way to show I care? I believe there is a special place in 
hell for women who don’t help other women.”3
Tuten: What’s a typical day for you like, if there is one?
Cavallo: My typical day . . . I have about twenty-ﬁve people in my strategy 
group, twenty-ﬁve who report to me. They are a mix of strategic planners 
and analysts and statisticians. The planners are traditional strategic plan­
ners, so to speak, and the analysts have master’s degrees for the most part 
in analytics or in econometric modeling. It’s a broad group of smart think­
ers and there are a variety of specialties including mobile, digital, innovation, 
and storytelling. My favorite time is spent managing and growing the team. 
I spend a good chunk of my time developing speciﬁc client strategies for 
current clients like JetBlue, Google, NOOK, and Zappos. I probably spend 
twenty percent of my day on agency issues like diversity and inclusion, rev­
enue generation, and such.
Tuten: Kristen, you have won several awards for your work on past cam­
paigns. Now, in your management and leadership role, are you as involved in 
client work? 
Cavallo: Well, this is not an industry of martyrs. No pitch has ever been 
won or lost and no case study has ever been based on just one person. 
Although a lot of people would have you sometimes believe that. Very often, 
one person might be a driving force. But it takes a lot of people to make 
what we make, lots of cooks in the kitchen. Collaboration and working 
with other people is key. I’m probably more involved in client work right 
now than I was in my past job as director of new business, but probably 
less so than when I was a planning director. When I was a planning director, 
everything was client work. As a business director, I didn’t work for any one 
speciﬁc client. Instead, my client was the agency. Now it is split for the most 
part with maybe a little heavier focus on the clients.
Tuten: Are you enjoying having more client focus than you did in your role 
in business development? Has the work at Mullen been positive so far?
Cavallo: Oh yes. Absolutely. Mullen really has a sweet spot with thought-
leader brands. By thought-leader brands I mean brands that tend to be out­
spent, brands that tend to not be the market share leader in that category.

Thought-leader brands must challenge the product category and do business 
differently. These are brands that have to think their way out of a problem 
because they don’t have the luxury of throwing money at it. Market share 
leaders tend to have the lion’s share of money and customers. It’s a totally 
different situation in how to approach the market. With these brands, usually 
we move at a really fast pace and are constantly asking ourselves, “What’s 
next?”
Our clients tend to feed their consumer-based social conversations with 
lots of initiatives, or topics in succession, much more frequently than maybe 
a market share leader would. That’s because they are trying to turn the 
category conversation in their favor, always trying to pull people to their 
brand. And since they don’t spend more than the market share leader, they 
have to say more provocative things to cause consumers to reappraise their 
choice.
Tuten: How would you describe the Mullen philosophy? Is it similar to your 
own approach to work and life? 
Cavallo: I actually think that Mullen’s philosophy and my personal philoso­
phy go hand in hand, which is one reason why I am here. Mullen’s philosophy 
has a name—it’s called “unbound.” It means that we don’t work in silos and 
all the disciplines are smashed together. We are a bundled solution with 
everything under one roof—media, digital, creative strategy, social, perfor­
mance analytics, everything. We don’t, for instance, have a digital department. 
Instead there are digital people throughout the whole company. Everyone 
is focused on solving business problems and just moving the ball down the 
ﬁeld—helping our clients win. Other agencies separate their media teams 
from their creative teams—often they even work in different buildings. I 
don’t know how to solve problems that way.
Mullen is pretty entrepreneurial and doesn’t labor over titles and such. 
People frequently move in the agency and try their hand at different things. 
It’s encouraged even. I love that about the agency. As far as my own approach 
to work and life, I’m an Army brat. I moved a lot growing up and I was 
exposed to many cultures. I learned to play instruments and sports. I have a 
lot of interests and I thrive in an open environment. Mullen suits my person­
ality. Plus I’m surrounded by other misﬁts like me.
Tuten: When you look around at the industry now—expanse of media, 
consumer control, interactive and social, challenges for print and traditional 
media—what’s most surprising to you?
Cavallo: Many agencies are known for expertise within a channel. Like 
digital or media or direct or experiential. There are so many agencies set up 
like that. People in these agencies need to be able to play across channels, 

Chapter 2 |  Kristen Cavallo: Chief Strategy Officer, Mullen
22
but they can’t really because of the agency specialization. Like, “I only work 
in digital,” or “I only work for the media company,” or “I work for the direct 
company,” or “I work for social media,” or “I am at the experiential agency.”
The industry did itself such a disservice when it started splintering things off 
as a way to not deal with competitive conﬂicts. The industry sold the idea 
to the client that they should hire agencies based on best in breed. I am not 
saying you can’t. While I know there are great agencies within those silos, I 
don’t believe they are structured to solve business problems because they 
have to execute solutions within their own boundaries.
When I was contemplating changing agencies, I had a handful of criteria that 
I was unwilling to compromise on. One was that I would not go to a siloed 
agency. The prevalence of siloed agencies surprised me. That alone dramati­
cally narrowed my ﬁeld of agencies. It was the biggest funnel shrinker of all 
my criteria.
Another one of my criteria was that the agency had to have a strong cre­
ative backbone. And lastly, the agency had to have a reputation for integrity 
—both in how they treat their employees and in their decision-making. If I 
was going to move, it had to be for an agency that had a reputation of integ­
rity and a sense of honesty in an industry that I don’t always think rewards 
that. Those were high bars. I wasn’t willing to sacriﬁce those parameters for 
money or a title.
Sometimes I think the industry isn’t its own best advocate. I think if it wants 
to be taken more seriously, then it needs to take itself more seriously and it 
needs to keep a high bar. The tactics that we use now will change. The tactics 
that we use are different than the tactics that we used six years ago. It will 
be different six years from now, but the values that we operate with should 
be sustained.
Tuten: Do you think the industry will rebundle and shift from the focus on 
silos?
Cavallo: I hope so. You are starting to see some agencies starting to rebun­
dle now. They are bringing media back inside and digital inside, but it is not 
enough just to have the capabilities inside the agency. It really comes down 
to the people and the process. Agencies with bundled disciplines tend to hire 
different people than siloed agencies. In bundled agencies, you reward people 
based on how collaborative they are and for the accomplishments of the 
group instead of the accomplishments of a person.
That will take years for siloed agencies to build because we’re talking about 
behavior and it is hard to change behavior. It is easy to just move somebody 

Advertisers at Work
23
into a building, but it is hard to get them to act like a team. I hope that it 
happens. For those agencies that are trying it, they need to know that they 
can’t do it in just a year or two. It will take longer. They have a longer road. 
An interesting thing is that there were a few dinosaurs that didn’t unbundle 
when it became popular to do so. Those few dinosaurs are now pioneers in 
an industry of super-siloed agencies. They should be justly rewarded.
Tuten: How do you stay on top of it all?
Cavallo: Let’s see. It’s so hard. I read constantly. I travel extensively. I attend 
shows and go to museums and people-watch. I deﬁnitely realize I don’t know 
everything I should, so I surround myself with really smart people. I believe 
Twitter to be both my chagrin and my pleasure. I pay attention to creative 
work. I read magazines and I shop. I talk to my kids. You just have to have an 
unending curiosity and willingness to learn, and when you get into a speciﬁc 
pitch or review or process, you have to be able to quickly immerse yourself 
in an industry and a brand. Being a quick learner and avid reader, being open-
minded, and having a big, curious appetite are all necessities for this job.
Tuten: Do you still watch television?
Cavallo: Yes, but I watch it all online. I watched all four seasons of Mad 
Men, but not once did I watch it on TV. I downloaded them all on iTunes and 
watched them. I watch almost all of my television after the fact and online. 
My time to watch TV is at 11 p.m.—never when it is “on,” so to speak. I do 
still have a TV and my kids watch it sometimes or they use it for Xbox.
In fact, my son and I were talking the other day about radio and how every­
one thought MTV was going to kill radio. The ﬁrst video ever played on MTV 
was “Video Killed the Radio Star” by the Buggles. We were talking about 
how in fact that did not happen and even more so now people are paying for 
radio. People may be listening to Sirius or using Pandora, but clearly radio 
has not died at all! Recently I turned on MTV and I couldn’t ﬁnd a video to 
save my life.
Now I go to YouTube for videos. When my daughter wants to ﬁnd the latest 
Taylor Swift song, we go to YouTube. We don’t go to MTV. I still think MTV is 
a cool brand, but it is based purely on yesterday’s momentum and equity, not 
anything they have necessarily done lately. The last thing I think they did with 
any kind of momentum and buzz factor for me would be the reality show 
with Puck from The Real World.
Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign, one with special meaning for you, 
that you worked on? What made it a favorite?

Chapter 2 | Kristen Cavallo: Chief Strategy Ofﬁcer, Mullen

Cavallo: I love working on brands that feel they have something huge to 
overcome—brands with a strong sense of mission and purpose. I have found 
that in a number of client brands. Volkswagen was my ﬁrst love because it 
was an outlier brand. It had a desire to become more beloved while staying 
true to its identity.
Kohler plumbing is one of my favorites. I have worked on that brand twice—
once at Mullen and once at Martin. Now every time I redo a new house, I 
redo it in Kohler from head to toe. I just love the whole mythology of that 
brand. I love the fact that Kohler is the name of the brand and the town it 
originated in, and the head of the company is the mayor of the town. The 
work they do is beautiful. They have a soul. They have one of the largest 
artists-in-residence programs of any company. Ten feet away from some-
one spray-painting enamel on a toilet, there is someone painting a fresco of 
Milton’s Paradise Lost. Mr. Kohler wants his employees to feel like artisans, not 
workers in a factory. That passion is reﬂected in the beauty of the Kohler 
products. I love that! I loved the whole spirit of the company.
Miller beer thoroughly embraced being a challenger brand. They were num-
ber three, Coors was number two, and Bud was number one.
We came up with this idea to make it a two-horse race—to laser-focus on 
Bud, the number one, and ignore Coors, the number two. To ignite the beer 
wars. We did a lot of mental chess. If Miller did this, what would Bud do? If 
Bud did this, what should Miller do? And so on. We came up with a campaign 
based on chapters of a book. Every quarter we would write a new chapter 
in the story of Miller and ﬁgure how it worked vis-à-vis Budweiser. Miller 
had a roster of agencies—us, Ogilvy, Y&R, Wieden+Kennedy—and we all got 
together for strategy sessions. I loved it. It was awesome to open up Time
magazine and have Time say it was one of the most inspiring turnarounds in 
business history.
Now I feel like a kid in a candy store that I get to work with brands like 
JetBlue and Zappos, and Google and NOOK. NOOK is fascinating as Barnes 
& Noble goes from a paper company to a digital company. They have so 
much ambition. They stare down big companies like Amazon and Apple each 
day. Every meeting is a game-changing meeting. Every one of them. They 
don’t have the luxury of an enormous budget, huge market share or ample 
shelf space. They ﬁght for every piece of it. But they have smarts and vision 
and courage, and that is beyond fun.

Cavallo: I’ve had lots of great moments. Seeing the VW “Milky Way” com­
mercial [aka the Pink Moon spot] on TV alongside my parents was one.4 
That was a favorite not only because of my passion for Volkswagen, but also 
because it was the ﬁrst time my parents thought what I did for a living was 
cool.
When we won the Wal-Mart account at Martin, certainly. It was the largest 
review of the year and we were the underdog.
When I had the recent pleasure of standing alongside a newly minted senior 
planner during her ﬁrst new business presentation. We’d rehearsed over and 
over and she really knew her stuff. When the big day came, she wore a new 
scarf she’d bought online with a cool design that connected to our client’s 
business. It was subtle but I loved that she wore her passion for their brand 
like a badge of honor. In the middle of her speech, the client interrupted to 
compliment her scarf. It was a good moment.
The opening of the ﬁrst Microsoft store—let me tell you, it is surreal to 
walk into a structure that I actually had a hand in designing. And to see 
people walking out with our shopping bag in hand. Our team designed the 
Microsoft Store logo and it gave me chills to see the logo lit above the door 
to the store, on the bag, and on employee uniforms.
The BFGoodrich pitch was the ﬁrst one I ran after I became director of new 
business. It felt like the Super Bowl to me. It was a test. I’d never managed a 
review before. Then on the last day, we were waiting to hear if we’d won or 
lost the account. I felt we’d done well, but this business is ﬁnicky and it’s hard 
to predict a win. It was a rainy day and we were dressed casually. Even more 
so than usual. We’d pulled so many late nights on the work and we had given 
it all we had. The consultant called me and asked me to pull a last-minute 
meeting with the core team, saying that there were “issues with compensa­
tion.” He insisted the client needed to have a conference call right away 
and that things were on edge. I was so angry! To have this wonderful work 
and thinking and chemistry come down to a disagreement over money was 
frustrating.
I got everyone in a room and we prepped for the call. About two minutes 
before the call was to start, I got a note from the receptionist that I had 
a visitor and they were insisting that I meet them in the lobby right then! 
4 The Volkswagen “Milky Way” spot aired in 1999 and was thought to be Volkswagen’s 
best advertising until its 2011 spot, “The Force.” Readers can see the ad and learn more 
about it at www.adweek.com/adfreak/battle-vw-ads-force-vs-milky-way-11593.

Chapter 2 |  Kristen Cavallo: Chief Strategy Officer, Mullen
26
Awful timing, right? I sprinted to the lobby, trying to think of ways to ditch 
the visitor and get back to the call. When I got to the lobby, the receptionist 
pointed me outside. There, in the rain, was the entire BFGoodrich marketing 
team. They were holding a banner with our proposed tagline and they were 
chanting for us to come outside. I called the team down from the confer­
ence room. We all ran outside, popped champagne, and danced and hugged 
for like twenty minutes. In the pouring rain! They said they knew we were 
the right choice after the ﬁrst meeting and each subsequent meeting had 
just conﬁrmed their gut reaction. It was a great ending to a great pitch and a 
great beginning to the relationship.
I never tire of those moments. When you get to see your work come to life, 
when a client’s business improves, when an employee believes in themselves, 
when a brand chooses your agency to represent them. These “votes of 
conﬁdence” motivate me and keep me going.
Tuten: Do you ever think about running your own place? Having your own 
name on the door?
Cavallo: No, I have never felt the need to have my name on the door. I feel 
the need to travel, to go places, and do things. I need to meet people and 
work on lots of different kinds of business. I work with some clients that I 
have been fortunate to work with again. I have never felt the need to see my 
name on the door.
This is probably an irrational fear, but I also have it stuck in my head that to 
run a place means I have to settle down and stand still. Maybe it’s because 
my role models—Joe Grimaldi, John Adams, and Mike Hughes—have all 
worked at their agencies for thirty-plus years. My desire for freedom is 
greater than my desire for power.
Tuten: Are they your mentors?
Cavallo: I am learning so much from Joe now. He is passing the baton so 
beautifully. If I’d built Mullen I know I would have a hard time letting oth­
ers drive. But Joe is remarkable. He is curious about our approaches, our 
thinking, our reasoning. His default mode is supportive. He assumes we’re 
right, which gives us so much conﬁdence. I feel like a plant being watered 
every day. And it makes me more determined not to let him down. And yes, 
at Martin, Mike Hughes and John Adams both served as my mentors. Mike 
taught me that genuine compassion is in short supply. We work in an indus­
try where shortcuts, breakups, and cynicism seem to dominate. In sharp con­
trast, Mike wins employee loyalty with praise, wins competitor respect with 
compliments, and wins client attention by listening . . . really listening. When 
Mike was inducted into the Creative Hall of Fame, John Adams pointed out 

Advertisers at Work
27
that people can be intimidated by Mike, but not for the usual reasons. Mike 
intimidates people because he talks about the kind of advertising he wants 
them to do. He tells them he wants them to change the world. He insists 
that they think bigger than they’re able to think. Then, as they sit there, he 
tells them what he ﬁnds remarkable about them and how knocked out he is 
by their talent. They leave proud, off to ﬁnd a wall to walk through for him.
John is the CEO of Martin and another big inﬂuence on me. Initially I was 
afraid of John, but after working with him on one new business pitch, I placed 
myself directly in his path. He pushed me and the strategies I was creating 
to be more surprising. He would question my logic until it was smarter. He 
would rehearse me over and over until my presentations were powerful and 
concise. He invested in me and I am better for it.
Tuten: Think back to when you were just getting started in the business. 
What do you wish you had known then that you know now?
Cavallo: When looking for a job, one’s inclination early on is either to pick 
the one agency that you admire or to pick the account that you want to 
work on. What I have found in my twenty years of being in the business is 
that neither is the best way to choose. Work for somebody who inspires 
you every day to try new things and think more deeply. Don’t worry about 
the brand or agency name on your résumé. Follow amazing people. I always 
learned the most when I worked for someone I admired. When I worked 
for somebody who pushed me—regardless of what agency I was at or what 
account I was on.
The reputations of the agencies can get distracting. I know plenty of people 
who have gone to work for the “agency of the moment” with all its magic 
fairy dust, and it didn’t turn out to be what they thought it would be. This 
is why you have got to ﬁnd the great people. Be willing to search for those 
people. Sometimes it may take a while for you to ﬁnd them. Once you do, 
you can build that “agency of the moment” with them.
Tuten: What’s next for you? What next steps, dreams, aspirations still await?
Cavallo: Personally, I want to raise good, stable kids who are productive 
members of society. I hope my kids see their parents as people who ﬁnd 
creative ways to solve problems and who love them. Work-wise, I have been 
given a rare gift to work for two companies back to back, which have high 
integrity, creativity, and regard for my personal growth. I plan on embrac­
ing that. Someday I’d love to work abroad. I grew up in Europe and I would 
really love to give my kids the experience of living in another country during 
their childhood.

I feel like my answer is all over the place. I don’t make ﬁrm career plans 
because I worry it will give me tunnel vision. Have you seen Steve Jobs’ 
speech to the Stanford graduating class? I’m sure it’s online.5 In it, he talks 
about how new opportunities will present themselves to you. They will be 
opportunities that you never thought of. These opportunities occur when 
you follow your passions. They don’t happen because you followed a career 
ladder or some predictable schedule for career growth—just when you fol­
low a passion and are committed to excellence in your work. You earn the 
opportunities with your passion, but you can’t take advantage of them unless 
you are open and smart enough to recognize the opportunities when they 
come. The choices may not always seem rational. But when you look back, 
they will make sense to you. And what’s even better, you’ll have fun with 
your career. That’s the best way to describe what’s next for me. I’m open to 
the opportunities and I plan on enjoying every moment.

Luke Sullivan
Former Creative Director
GSD&M Idea City
After 30 years and 21 One Show Pencils in the ad business, author Luke Sullivan 
is now chair of the advertising department at the Savannah College of  Art and 
Design (SCAD). He’s the author of the popular advertising book Hey,  Whipple, 
Squeeze This:  A Guide to Creating Great Advertising (Wiley, 2003); the blog 
Hey Whipple (www.heywhipple.com); and a memoir, Thirty Rooms to Hide 
In: Insanity,  Addiction, and Rock ‘n’ Roll in the Shadow of the Mayo Clinic 
(CreateSpace, 2011). Sullivan now lives in Savannah with his family. He reports 
that he enjoys the indoors and likes to spend a lot of his time there.
Tracy Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in the ﬁeld?
Luke Sullivan: I grew up reading comic books—Spider-Man, Daredevil. 
Then I started making my own comic books, which if you look at a comic, is 
basically a storyboard. Telling stories with words and pictures. It took me a 
couple of years out of college to put those two together: telling stories with 
words and pictures equals advertising. Lordy, I remember the ﬁrst book I put 
together to get into the business. What Tom McElligott and Ron Anderson 
[of Fallon] back in Minneapolis saw in me I will never know. It sucked, but 
somehow I got in. My blessings to them both.
Tuten: How did your background—school, earlier jobs—help or hurt your 
rise as a creative director?

Sullivan: The habit I picked up early that helped me most was deﬁnitely 
reading. In 1966, I discovered my ﬁrst Doctor Doolittle book by Hugh 
Lofting. I remember sneaking pages of it in during my sixth grade class 
because I found it more interesting than the class. I have read voraciously 
ever since. I recommend students do the same. It doesn’t have to be classics. 
It can be anything. Stephen King, romance novels, People magazine, history, I 
don’t care. Be curious. Stay curious.
In high school, I enjoyed putting together magazines and other “under­
ground” publications. One publication I released—to the irritation of the 
vice-principal—was a twenty-page book called “Student’s Guide to Better 
Skipping, Smoking, & General Misconduct.” It was a detailed manual on how 
to forge hall passes, which were the best doors to sneak out of school, and 
the best places to hang out during school hours.
After college, I spent three years reﬁnishing wood and working on a con­
struction crew while I ﬁgured out what I wanted to do next. One day I 
stumbled upon a book of the best ads from the Minnesota ad community. 
Each year advertising groups publish an annual of the best work. That was 
really the ﬁrst time I considered advertising as a career. While I wasn’t ready 
to get into the middle of the business, I did land a job as a typesetter at 
Dayton’s department store. I didn’t write the ads, I didn’t art direct them. I 
just set the type. But at least I was on the edge of the business and I wasn’t 
reﬁnishing woodwork in the third ﬂoor of a brownstone in the July heat.
Tuten: You’ve recently left the chief creative role at GSD&M Idea City to 
run the advertising department at SCAD. Can you share the decision-making 
thought process you went through as you made the choice? Goals for the 
future? Fears? What played in to the choice to mentor young talent in a 
school setting rather than in an agency?
Sullivan: I often think there are three main chapters to a creative person’s 
career. Getting famous, getting money, and getting settled. When you ﬁrst 
start, you’re all on ﬁre and you want to show the world you can do this. Your 
focus tends to be on awards because the recognition is evidence that you 
can do the work. Then after you’ve convinced yourself, “Dang, I really can do 
this,” you think, “Hey, I should get paid more for this. I do it really well.” That 
comprises much of the middle of one’s career. And then there’s that time 
when you want stability more than anything else. You have kids. You don’t 
want to move around as much anymore. So you look for a long-term home, 
a place you can see yourself happy in for ten, ﬁfteen years.
Maybe that doesn’t describe your path, but it does mine. As I approached 
this third chapter of my career, I wanted some stability. But stability in the 
advertising world is a scarce commodity. Even if you’re an established player,

forces outside of your control can make your job go away overnight. Things 
like a change in management or the loss of an account can shift everything in 
an instant. So I started looking outside of advertising, as I think many people 
in my position do. Education was a natural, at least for me, because I have 
enjoyed mentoring kids all these years. I think I have it in my blood. My mom 
was a teacher, and so was my grandfather. He even has a school named after 
him in Daytona Beach, Florida—R.J. Longstreet Elementary School. Good ol’ 
Poppa. I love carrying on the family business.
Tuten: Hey, Whipple, Squeeze This is among the most-read, most-loved 
advertising books and one I, like many other advertising professors, recom­
mend to students. What’s it like to be Luke Sullivan—the person who wrote 
such an inﬂuential book in the industry?
Sullivan: I wrote Whipple when I was at Fallon. I had been saving speeches 
and articles for a few years in a ﬁle. Gradually I started adding other people’s 
advice, insights, and articles and the ﬁle eventually grew unruly and bad-
tempered. It would no longer ﬁt in my ﬁle case and I didn’t want to buy a 
new one. Changing my storage system would’ve thrown off the design of my 
ofﬁce. I’m serious.
Then one day I had to give a speech at the Portfolio Center in Atlanta and I 
raided that ﬁle for all it was worth. I handed out the notes of the speech and 
later learned the notes were turning up as screen savers in agencies here 
and there.
In addition to being ﬂattered, I began thinking there was a market for a 
decent book on advertising. Most books—at least at the time—were pretty 
bad. All you had to do was look at the examples of “good advertising” these 
books contained and you could tell the authors weren’t practitioners of the 
craft, at least the craft I practice.
So I just started writing. I didn’t have a publisher nor any hope that such a 
book would be welcome on the shelves of bookstores. But that was beside 
the point. I had to write this book—mostly to get it out of my system. I 
wrote it out of an obsession. Once I had the idea in my head, I literally could 
not stop working on it.
After I had ﬁnished, I showed the ﬁrst manuscript around to about forty 
people I admired. These were just folks in the business. I showed it to creatives, 
account folks, directors. Every one of them was kind enough to read the entire 
thing and give me criticism. I am still in debt to those people. After that, it was 
just a matter of getting it into the hands of the right publisher.
Not knowing the ﬁrst thing about the process, I just wandered over to the 
Barnes & Noble in downtown Minneapolis and bought some books on how

to write book proposals and other how-to manuals. I followed what they 
said and that was pretty much it. It’s been fun. It’s made money, but not John 
Grisham money. First-time authors rarely make money. It’s more of a love 
and pride thing.
Hey Whipple has been a constant source of joy for me because so many 
young people write to me and say, “Hey, your book is what got me into the 
business.” That does not get old, I assure you. It feels great knowing you’ve 
had a positive effect on someone’s life. That is, if luring someone into the 
dark alley of advertising can be described as positive. It’s in ﬁve languages 
now and the fourth edition is out in 2012. The new edition will include cov­
erage on creating for social media.
Tuten: Your latest book is Thirty Rooms to Hide In. It’s quite a departure from 
Hey Whipple. Tell us about the book and what inspired you to share stories of 
your childhood.
Sullivan: It’s titled Thirty Rooms to Hide In: Insanity, Addiction, and Rock ‘n’ Roll 
in the Shadow of the Mayo Clinic,1 and about the best way I can describe it is 
The Shining . . . but funnier.
It’s the story of growing up with my ﬁve brothers in a big dark house in 
Minnesota back in the ﬁfties and sixties. Winters raged outside and our 
father raged inside, and yet we managed to have a wildly fun, thoroughly dys­
functional time growing up, thanks mostly to our mother’s protection. Dark 
humor was the coin of our realm, and The Beatles, they were true north on 
our compass of Cool. We made movies, started a rock and roll band, and 
wise-cracked our way though a pretty grim landscape of our father’s insanity, 
Eisenhower’s Cold War, fallout shelters, and JFK’s assassination.
Although I had two agents repping the book, we were unsuccessful in selling 
it to a major publishing house. My agent described the problem when she 
said, “Luke, I love the book, but you are about ten years too late to a market 
that is now ﬂooded with memoirs.” Every crybaby with a typewriter out 
there—and I include myself among them—has written a memoir. Seems to 
me there are plenty of “my childhood sucked more than your childhood” 
books out there. It might have started even way back when with Mommie 
Dearest’s “No more wire hangers”!
Tuten: Did the process of trying to get Thirty Rooms to Hide In published 
remind you of the approval process in advertising?

Sullivan: Absolutely. First, can we just agree that whenever art and com­
merce meet, there’s going to be tension? Sometimes compromise, some­
times conﬂict, but always tension. The creative world bristles with examples.
Take Hollywood, where producers can dictate “notes” while screenplays 
suffer the “death of a thousand cuts.” Or advertising, where clients can grind 
excellent work into vanilla-ﬂavored poop. Christ, even The Beatles were 
pressured by the ﬁnancial people, and to this day, their producer, George 
Martin, regrets being forced to release “Strawberry Fields Forever” and 
“Penny Lane” as singles when he knew they should’ve been part of the Sgt. 
Pepper’s album.
On the other hand, artists aren’t always right—even the great ones. I’m 
thinking of Michael Cimino. Here’s a guy who creates one of the best mov­
ies ever—The Deer Hunter. It wins a bunch of Oscars and so Hollywood 
decides Cimino is a deity and gives him carte blanche. He then immediately 
turns into an orgy of creative excess. You may remember Heaven’s Gate as an 
expensive, so-so movie? But actually what it was a creative indulgence, which 
actually closed the doors of the United Artists studio. Even more, what’s 
ironic is that United Artists was originally formed by so-called “creatives.” It 
was formed by actors like Chaplin, Fairbanks, and Pickford—to wrest control 
from the ﬁnancial people.
Here’s where I’m going with this: artistic control seems to be moving away 
from the ﬁnancial people and into the hands of not just artists, but consum­
ers. We’ve moved from being a downloading culture to one that uploads, and 
now everybody with a cell phone can have their own movies on YouTube 
and any crybaby—including me—with a computer can be a “published 
author.”
There’s no ﬁnancial entity keeping us in line anymore. No conference calls 
about “studio notes” or “client concerns.” Content is king and we artists 
can’t blame our mediocre output on “The Man” anymore.
Tuten: What’s a typical day like, if there is one? Do you have any rituals that 
are important to your ability to work creatively?
Sullivan: When I was a working copywriter, yes, I had many little ritu­
als I observed in order to have a productive day. All creative people are 
different. I happen to like a clean environment that offers no distractions. 
I read recently that author Jonathan Franzen, who wrote The Corrections, 
wrote on a little MacBook while facing a white wall in a small, bare room. 
He further removed distractions by having no internet access on his little 
machine.

There is a marvelous book about the creative process called The War of Art.2
The title is a nice little play on that old chestnut, The Art of War. In this book, 
the author posits that many of the roadblocks creative people encounter are 
of our own making. We have an unconscious resistance to writing that we 
have to be aware of in order to defeat.
I defeat it by working in a room without distractions. In a quiet, well-
ordered, empty, and totally clean room. I cannot work well with music of any 
kind playing. Well, okay, I cannot work with music with lyrics. I cannot work 
well with distractions. Many people can. I am unable to. No e-mail on the 
computer. No phone about to ring. Nothing. Just the white page or screen. 
It focuses me. And as for time of day, I always liked my morning brain better. 
Ten a.m. was prime thinking-time for me.
And as for a typical day? There never was one. That’s the thing about this 
business. There are so many things going on, even at a small agency, that 
things stay pretty lively. And even when you have something approaching a 
routine at the ofﬁce, it goes out the window when you go on a shoot or any 
kind of production.
Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign you worked on? What made it a 
favorite?
Sullivan: It’s a radio campaign, for a teeny little client that we had at Fallon 
McElligott in 1995 and 1996. It was a technical school called Dunwoody. They 
trained kids in what was once called “the trades.” You could get a degree 
in, say, heating and air conditioning, architectural drafting, computer repair 
. . . you know, real jobs. I had a great client who never changed a word of 
copy, trusted that I had their best interests in mind, and just let me at it. I’ve 
posted my fave spots from this campaign on my blog, heywhipple.com.3
It never won Best of Show anywhere, but I don’t care. Well, okay, maybe I 
was a little bummed. I still think the work was great, but listeners can decide 
for themselves on heywhipple.com.
Tuten: Are there campaigns that have special meaning for you? Can you 
share one with us?
Sullivan: Way back in 1986, I won an advertising contest. Reader’s Digest
sponsored a competition to agencies worldwide. “Who can come up with

the best poster to keep high school students from drinking and driving?” The 
ﬁrst year, two famous knuckleheads at Fallon won it—good ol’ Bob Barrie 
and Mike Lescarbeau. I was at The Martin Agency at the time and when they 
ran the contest the second year, I sat down with the express purpose of 
winning. You could enter a few concepts, and so I sort of put my chips on 
different creative strategies and sent the work in. Each campaign I submitted 
was with a different Martin art director. There was one with Cabell Harris, 
one with Diane Cook, and another with Hal Tench.
The work with Diane won. The winning concept Diane and I did avoided the 
clichés of the category, which in this case were gravestones, morgues, and 
toe tags. Over an image of a high school boy with his date in the back seat 
of a car being driven by his mom, we had the headline: “If losing your life 
doesn’t keep you from drinking and driving, imagine losing your license.” We 
got lucky, and Diane and I won the grand prize, which was a very expensive 
trip to Europe. We ﬂew to London with our spouses on the Concorde and 
spent one week there in a ﬁve-star hotel, The Savoy. Then we rode the Orient 
Express to Paris and spent another week in a ﬁve-star hotel there. After that, 
we spent a week in the south of France at a castle. Then to wrap it up, we 
took the Queen Elizabeth 2 back to New York City. It was a total blast to 
have won a tough little nationwide contest and to score such a cool trip.
Tuten: You’ve worked on award-winning campaigns—and it’s clear from 
your writing that you love the work. In your new role, how will you satisfy 
your passion for the work?
Sullivan: There was a time in my life where the greatest joys were either 
seeing my work air on TV or winning a Gold Pencil for it at the One Show. 
But as I’ve aged, my joys are more often felt on behalf of the successes of 
other people. In part, I think this has something to do with becoming a 
father. I have mentored juniors off and on throughout my working career 
and it always thrilled me when their work was sold and produced, or 
resulted in a winning pitch. Now as I enter the educational ﬁeld, I imagine it 
may be somehow similar—coaching kids, helping them stretch to their limit, 
and then seeing the fun when they succeed.
Tuten: Think back to when you were just getting started in the business. 
What do you wish you had known then that you know now?
Sullivan: Many young creatives I see today remind me of myself. They are 
just full of ﬁre and gasoline and insanity and must-must-must-get-ahead drive. 
But I think that is good. It’s good to try hard. It’s good to stretch to see 
what you’re capable of. But unbridled, such aspirations can curdle and burn a 
young person out. This happened to me back in the eighties when I let it all 

Chapter 3 |  Luke Sullivan: Former Creative Director, GSD&M Idea City
36
mean too much to me. I tried too hard and when I struck out, oh, my . . . that 
was the end of the world. Bertrand Russell said, “One of the symptoms of 
an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly 
important.” That sure described me. So now, I wish I could go back and tell 
myself, dude, it’s just advertising.
I was also poisoned by this obsession many of us have with winning. I still see 
it today in many students. After school is over, they begin to tear their hair 
out and worry, “Oh my God, what if I don’t land a job at one of the ﬁve or 
six elite agencies in America? I’ll be a loser.”
Having been around the ad schools over the years, I’ve overheard this same 
conversation in hallways and computer labs all over: “Dude! You know Bill? 
Yeah, he got into Goodby and I didn’t even get an e-mail back from them. 
God, I suck.”
Here’s the thing: they probably don’t suck. It’s just that they’ve been raised in 
a culture that places a lot of emphasis on winning. We believe in sayings like, 
“winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing,” and, “winners never quit,” and 
all the others.
The fact is, America has been obsessed with winning ever since we won ﬁrst 
place in World War II. We copped a silver in the ﬁfties space race—damn 
that Sputnik—but we came back and nailed the gold with Apollo II. Ever since 
then, we’ve been all, “Who even remembers the second man on the moon?”
It seems we’ve left the grading system and become a pass-fail society. In fact, 
more like winners/failures.
“What? You didn’t get into Harvard? Just Notre Dame? Duuuude.”
“What?? You didn’t win the Super Bowl, just the AFC title? Ouch.”
This is what I want to stay to students: “Students, repeat after me.
I did not get a job offer at Goodby. Or Crispin.
But I did get a job offer from, say, Shelby & Hammerstein in Chicago.
And they want to pay me for my ideas.
I am not stocking Bic pens on the shelves of Wal-Mart.
I have landed my ﬁrst job in a creative industry.
From here, I can probably go anywhere.
Because I have a career now.
It has begun.”

This is an important lesson. And, let us bless our friends who did land jobs 
at the high-proﬁle agencies. Those jobs come with some extra stress. Not 
everyone really wants that.
Let us be kind to ourselves and become “recovering perfectionists.” Let us 
leave winning to Charlie Sheen.
Tuten: This business changes so rapidly and there are always new things to 
learn whether its new consumer trends, new technology, or just keeping up 
with industry news. What’s your approach for knowing everything you need 
to know?
Sullivan: The only way to do any of this stuff is to do this stuff. It sounds 
silly, I know. But that is my experience and it’s what I am seeing the success­
ful agencies doing. They just start, they dive in, they ﬁgure shit out as they go. 
You, too, will ﬁgure shit out as you go, but ﬁrst you have to dive in. You will 
begin to realize what you bring to the party and what you don’t after you 
start. If you enter it with a willingness to listen, to learn, and every once in a 
while to just shut the hell up . . . you will meet in the middle.
My best advice for people is to do a few critical activities. Stay focused on 
the work. Read the awards annuals. Read everything, go online and watch 
the reels, read library books, read the sports section, the business section. 
Read history, read comedy. Soak up the culture around you. I go to a movie a 
week. Never fail. Movies are storytelling. As is a TV commercial. Movies have 
all the new cinematic techniques, also germane to my craft. And they are a 
good escape from the business.
There’s a tendency to stay cooped up with yourself when creating. Don’t 
stay in your copywriting ivory tower. Get out there. Learn and learn some 
more. It’s a process that’ll never end. The ability to read massive amounts of 
material, the ability to integrate all that data, to be disciplined in your study 
process? That’s what college is anyway. It’s not about what you learn. It is 
about learning to learn. It is about the process.
Tuten: When you look around at the industry now—expanse of media, 
consumer control, interactive and social, challenges for print and traditional 
media—what’s most surprising to you?
Sullivan: What I ﬁnd most surprising about the digital shift is the speed 
at which it happened. Often revolutions take place over time. I remember 
watching this wave coming towards me back in the early nineties. I remem­
ber thinking, “Wow, this is gonna change things.” I thought I’d have more time 
than it turned out we did. By 2000, the train had crashed through my living 
room and the whole advertising world is completely different. Today it’s dif­

Chapter 3 |  Luke Sullivan: Former Creative Director, GSD&M Idea City

ferent than the industry I grew up in, it’s different than the early nineties, the 
early 2000s. The curve of change is now almost vertical. It hurts my neck just 
to look up this curve and think about the changes to come.
Tuten: So many people struggle with balance between work and personal 
life. How do you achieve a balance?
Sullivan: When I was young, there was no boundary between work and life. 
Work was life. That may still be okay for those without spouses or children 
and for people who know how to keep sane in a business that does not pro­
mote sanity. But in my middle and later years, I drew a line in the sand and 
said this is work and this is home.
I always tried to be in the car at 5:50 or 6:00. I was fortunate enough to 
work at places that weren’t driven by what I see as a destructive work ethic. 
We all hear about them. These are places where you work until midnight 
all year long. Personally, I think such an ethic is destructive, even for young 
people. It’s not a sustainable model, not on a personal level anyway. It’s prob­
ably sustainable for the shops—they just need to keep the new meat coming 
in the side door as the burnouts are being poured out the back. But it’s not 
for me. Nothing is that important anymore. Only my family.
Tuten: You have a magic, fairy wand. If you wave it, you can change one thing 
about advertising that you hate. What do you change?
Sullivan: Clients would no longer ask agencies to do creative for new busi­
ness pitches. The clients would simply pick a few shops based on the kind 
of work they’ve done previously. Then the clients would visit each agency, 
get a feel for the people, and make a choice. I can think of no other busi­
ness where we give away our product for free. Where we work ourselves 
to the bone, where we lose weeks, weekends, holidays, slaving away with 
limited information in a crunched time schedule, as we try to quickly throw 
together solutions for complex marketing problems . . . and doing it all for 
free. I think it’s just an absolute shame. But until the whole industry locks 
arms and just says “No,” it’s going to keep happening.

President 
The Martin Agency
Mike Hughes, president of The Martin Agency (www.martinagency.com), a 
full-service advertising agency based in Richmond, Virginia, is a 40-year industry 
veteran. Hughes served as The Martin Agency’s longtime chief creative ofﬁcer, 
relinquishing this title to John Norman (former executive creative director for 
Wieden+Kennedy’s Amsterdam ofﬁce) in 2010. The succession of creative leader­
ship to Norman was brought about in part by Hughes’s illness; several years ago 
he was diagnosed with lung cancer and so he set about to identify someone who 
could guide Martin’s creative group forward. A survivor still, Hughes isn’t ready to 
retire. He’s set out to direct The Martin Agency beyond the making of ads, to serve 
the greater good—and nurture people along the way.
Hughes was inducted into The One Club’s Creative Hall of Fame, the advertising 
industry equivalent to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Virginia Commonwealth University 
Brandcenter, one of the top graduate programs in advertising, named its building Mike 
Hughes Hall. He’s also a member of the Virginia Communications Hall of Fame.1
Creativity magazine named Hughes one of the 50 most inﬂuential creative 
thinkers in the United States. Adweek called Hughes one of the nine best creative 
directors in America, and Ad Age listed The Martin Agency as one of the three best 
creative agencies in the world.

Tracy Tuten: It was David Oakley who helped me get in touch with you, 
and I really appreciate his help. He had given you quite a compliment at the 
end of his interview.
Mike Hughes: It’s a shame that you can’t believe a word David says [laugh­
ter]. But that’s awfully nice, that’s awfully nice. That makes me feel very good.
Tuten: He obviously thinks the world of you.
Hughes: Well, I think he’s crazy as a loon, but there’s a huge place in my 
heart for David. Huge.
Tuten: Let’s get started. What led you to advertising as a profession?
Hughes: Fear. I was a newspaper reporter who thought I wanted to be 
a magazine editor. I considered moving to New York City from my home­
town of Richmond, Virginia to try to get into the magazine business. But I 
was scared. I was nervous about moving. My father had sold typography to 
ad agencies in Richmond, and so he knew a lot of agency people. I thought 
I would at least try that for a year or two before I moved to New York to 
make my mark, and I’ve been doing this ever since. So it was fear of moving 
to New York I think, and then—getting into this business and ﬁnding some 
things I really loved about it.
Tuten: What are those things that you really love?
Hughes: When I was a newspaper reporter, a young newspaper reporter, I’d 
have to go out and ask hard questions of people. And then on deadline, you’d 
have to write a story about it. There were hard questions. I remember having 
to go to a bus crash where some young people were killed, and I had to talk 
to their families. I have nothing but admiration for the reporters who do that 
work, because it can be important, but it’s hard, very hard. But in advertising, 
they bring you all the information and you can take some time to ﬁgure out 
the right way to present that.
Let me tell you about my ﬁrst assignment, when I showed up at an ad agency 
and didn’t know anything. They gave me a four-color brochure to write for 
Reynolds Metals. They gave it to me at nine in the morning, and at 9:45, I 
gave them the copy because that’s how we did things at an afternoon news­
paper. They said, “What is this? No, we expect you to spend a week on this.” 
I said, “Doing what?” But there was time to work on the craft of writing in 

Advertisers at Work
41
a way that surprised me at an advertising agency. I didn’t know. Reporters—
newspaper, magazine, and all kinds of reporters—they go out and cover 
what’s interesting. In advertising, the content may or may not be inherently 
interesting. We have to ﬁnd ways to interest people in what we’re writing 
about. So it’s a different kind of discipline.
Tuten: How did you practice that craft?
Hughes: You know, I don’t think I’m a great “big idea” person, but I think I 
have some ability to help other people make their ideas work. I was lucky to 
come into advertising in a generation where it was assumed that you would 
sit across the desk from an art director all day and work on the ideas. My 
contribution was to be very patient while the art directors came up with 
the ideas, and then I would stay up all night and just write thousands and 
thousands of headlines to go with their ideas. And then I’d get them to edit 
that for me. It was a puzzle that was worth ﬁguring out, especially ﬁguring 
out why should anybody care about our message. They’re not going to care 
just because I come up with a clever pun. I mean, why should people care 
about whatever the product is I’m trying to sell, and how can I be honest in 
trying to present that?
Tuten: Did you have a mentor who helped you as you were developing 
your skills?
Hughes: Over the years, I had a number of mentors. Actually, going back 
to when I was a reporter for the afternoon paper in Richmond, Virginia, 
the metropolitan editor, who was pretty interesting because he knew—
like, you know, here I am at this very conservative newspaper, and I’m a 
bleeding-heart liberal who reads The New York Times every day, like all the 
reporters. And he suggested back then that I also look at the Daily News. He 
said there’s a big segment of the population that’s more comfortable with 
the writing that you see in the Daily News. That was an interesting thing to 
me—to this day I read The New York Times. But that editor taught me that I 
also have to learn to write for people who are different from me. I had to 
ﬁgure out how to write for people who had different views and interests. 
And to try to think about what those people did and what they were like. 
That was valuable.
And then in my ﬁrst job at an advertising agency—even though everybody 
else had copy and art together—the agency still had a separate copy chief. 
After I’d been there a few months, my boss said I was pretty good at this. 
He said I should start looking for a better agency to work for after eighteen 
months at his agency. In fact, he said if I was still there in two years, he’d ﬁre 
me. And so at eighteen months, I went to another agency.

Chapter 4 |  Mike Hughes: President, The Martin Agency
42
I just kept discovering new things about the business. Like my ﬁrst agency 
was not a good creative agency, but at least it was serious about the busi­
ness of selling things or interesting people in the products. Then I got to a 
better creative agency, and I learned about things like award shows that I 
didn’t even know existed. I certainly didn’t know that an agency in Richmond, 
Virginia, could do the kind of work [that would win awards]. I was really 
taken with it, and so I spent long days and long nights to try to do the kind 
of work that would appear in those places.
Then I bounced around to a couple of other places in my twenties. I worked 
a series of jobs for eighteen months each. Then I had a place of my own for 
a while. When Harry Jacobs, who at that time was president of The Martin 
Agency and creative director, offered me a chance to go there, I ﬁgured, 
“Well, this will be a huge cut in pay, because my little company is doing really 
well, but I have a lot to learn from Harry.” So I joined The Martin Agency 
thinking, “Well, I’ll do that for eighteen months.” That was in 1978, and I’ve 
been here ever since.
Tuten: What was so magic about eighteen months?
Hughes: It just seemed to be the way things had worked out for me. I had 
always gotten a really nice offer after eighteen months from all these differ­
ent places. I was given a contract at one of the last places that said that I had 
to give them three months’ notice. I was getting married at the time. I didn’t 
know where I was going to go, but I ﬁgured I had some time to ﬁnd some­
thing. So I told them that I was leaving in three months. There was this very 
talented, very beautiful writer in town, and the people who ran the ofﬁce 
wanted to hire her right away, and so I ended up with three months’ pay and 
I didn’t have to go to work. That allowed me to set up my own business. I did 
that until Harry Jacobs gave me the opportunity to come here.
Tuten: What was it like being a part of Martin all those years ago? How is 
the agency different than it is now?
Hughes: We were a lot smaller then. We had a wonderful time over this 
period. But, there was probably never a time we didn’t struggle, you know? 
In all the years we’ve been here, I bet once a month the entire time I’ve been 
here, someone comes into my ofﬁce and closes the door and says, “This 
agency is at a crossroads.” We’re always at a crossroads. I think every com­
pany always feels it’s at a crossroads, and advertising’s an industry that can 
make you feel pretty paranoid because business can come and go. But the 
things that I think we worked on here were just basically about being good 
people. Like every young creative director, when I came here—and I guess I 
was associate creative director under Harry, or some title like that, when I 

Advertisers at Work
43
was twenty-nine years old—and I came here and I would have said that the 
only thing that matters is the work, the work, the work, the work. As I’ve 
gotten older, I think I’ve come to understand that while nothing is that much 
more important than the work, what’s really important are the people, the 
people, the people, the people.
If you can ﬁnd a way to be a good place for good people to work and you 
give them some room to develop their own ideas, then you can have longer-
lasting success, I think. You can’t guarantee that any client will stay with you 
forever, but if you keep attracting good people, you’ll also keep attract­
ing, hopefully, good clients. And so this has been a place that really treats 
people well.
Tuten: You’ve talked to me about your philosophy on the importance of 
people and nurturing people, and you talked to me about how you had 
come to join The Martin Agency and work for Harry Jacobs. What’s been the 
highlight of your work experiences?
Hughes: Well, the thing I’m happiest about is I have a fabulous family, and 
on the professional side, it’s that I’m surrounded by such wonderful, inspir­
ing, and talented people. At Martin, we try to be a magnetic place for the 
best people. You know that everybody wants to talk about their culture as 
if they’re a family. Every agency will say that. But you also know that it’s got 
to be tougher than that. It’s more like a team because you never ﬁre family 
members, but . . .
Tuten: [Laughter.] Sometimes you wish you could.
Hughes: Yeah, sometimes you wish you could. Putting together a team 
where people support each other and help each other, that feels awfully 
good. But now making them support each other and help each other, that 
isn’t something I can dictate. It’s something that people do, and so I feel very 
fortunate that I’ve got a great group of people to work with. I feel strongly 
that everybody should be able to go to work and do work they love with 
people they love. I think that’s the gift the people here have given me.
Tuten: If you were going to give some advice to people who are getting 
started in the industry now and who want to achieve the kinds of things that 
you’ve achieved—which is pretty much every award in the industry, all kinds 
of honors, buildings named after you and so on—what kind of advice would 
you give them?
Hughes: Well, I don’t think you set out for those things. You know, like 
everybody else, I was once a paranoid young copywriter who felt that 
I wasn’t quite up to the job, and so I worked really hard and really long. 

Chapter 4 | Mike Hughes: President, The Martin Agency

I wish—I wish I could say that you could do that in an eight-hour-a-day job 
ﬁve days a week. But everybody I know who has made a real difference in 
whatever industry has really put in a lot of time and a lot of hard work. I’d 
say to these young people, I don’t think you should try to get ahead of your-
self. I never in my life asked for a promotion. It was always a matter of just 
trying to do the work as well as I could and as conscientiously as I could, 
and surrounding myself with other people that thought that way.
I think the best advice I ever got was from my dad when I started working 
in the professional marketplace. He said, “Just don’t ever lose your sense 
of humor,” and I think that is still the best advice I ever got. Because, you 
know, in any world, whether it’s journalism or advertising, there are so many 
ridiculous things that happen and so many things you can’t control, but if you 
keep a sense of humor about it all, I think you can go through your life and 
do good things and make good things happen.
Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign that you worked on?
Hughes: Well, it’s kind of hokey [laughter]. I have a favorite spot—a TV spot 
I did with an art director named Jerry Torchia. It was for Wrangler jeans. It 
was probably nineteen years ago. I was actually the copywriter on the spot. It 
was about a father giving his son a driving lesson. I was giving my son driving 
lessons. My son had knocked over some trash cans during his lessons. So in 
the spot, we had a kid knocking over some mailboxes. The story was simply 
about fathers and sons, ﬁrst-time driving lessons, and comfortable blue jeans. 
That spot always has a big place in my heart.
Tuten: Do you get to work on client work as much as you want to? I know 
you’re doing different types of things now.
Hughes: I have to be careful that nobody feels that I’m trying to be the 
creative director. I was creative director for a long time here and people can 
shut down on their own work and opinions if they feel I have a strong opin-
ion on the path a creative idea should be taking. I kind of underestimated 
how hard that would be. I think people have deﬁned me in that role for so 
long that it’s hard for me to be part of a discussion without someone think-
ing, “That’s the creative director talking.”
But I do have wonderful relationships with several of our clients, and I work 
much more in the strategy level than I do in the creative level, and I like that 
a lot. I really like that a lot.
Tuten: So for those clients, are you advising on marketing for their entire 
business or strictly for the advertising campaigns?
Hughes: It’s mostly about marketing. Every company now is trying to be so 
innovative, and yet nobody has a budget for innovation. Nobody is actually

staffed or resourced to do it. And so what we have to be able to do is to 
go in and talk about innovation and maybe different ways that they can 
approach their customers—not in terms of the advertising creative cam­
paign, but just in terms of how they build their story.
One of the things that I’ve been working on a lot for the last year and a half 
is this notion of storybuilding. Once upon a time we were brand storytellers. 
Now we start a story and the audience—our customers and our observers 
and everybody else—joins in on the conversation. We don’t tell the stories. 
We build them. That also means that storytelling is no longer media-speciﬁc. 
The story can be told through all the things a brand does. We’re trying—
I’m trying—to encourage companies to be a little bolder and not so thin-
skinned about what people say and how people add to their stories. It’s hard 
for a company to respond quickly to what happens online, for example. But, 
on the other hand, companies must be responsible with their responses to 
how others expand their brand stories.
Tuten: Do you feel like your clients are willing to take risks?
Hughes: Well, I think it’s the rare businessperson who isn’t at all concerned 
with risks, and I think agencies too often categorize their clients as too risk-
averse. Too many agencies blame their clients for the work they do. To me, 
that’s just not acceptable. We are responsible for the work that we do. Some 
clients make it harder than others, but I completely understand why they 
don’t want to be too risky. I think one of the things that agencies make a 
mistake in doing is they go in and try to sell innovative advertising by telling 
the clients, “Well, this will really be risky.” When agencies do this, they are 
daring the client to go with the concept, when the fact is bolder, smarter, 
more creative advertising works better than other kinds, so the risk is doing 
something that is not as interesting.
Tuten: What’s your favorite thing that Martin’s working on right now? The 
thing you’re most excited about?
Hughes: A couple of our people are developing a new kind of media tech­
nology that I can’t talk about yet, but it is incredibly exciting. I’m incredibly 
excited about some of the content things we’re developing. I’m not as close 
to the day-to-day in the creative work these days, but it still excites me a lot 
when something big comes through. No agency is as consistent as it wants 
to be.
Also, I feel extremely good, although I’m not planning to retire—I’m plan­
ning to live forever and work forever—I’m very excited about the people in 
the next generation of management at our company. Both John Adams, my 
partner, and I are very, very excited about the next generation of leadership. 

Chapter 4 |  Mike Hughes: President, The Martin Agency
46
They probably want to push us out the door, but right now it’s exciting to 
watch them work.
Tuten: How would you describe Martin’s philosophy?
Hughes: I think we try to be both a big-hearted agency and a big-shoul­
dered agency. It is surprising to a lot of people that this agency in Richmond, 
Virginia, can take on things as complicated as Walmart or Pizza Hut or some 
of the really involved campaigns we do—like the interesting process we’re in 
with Johnson & Johnson on Tylenol. Those are not easy assignments. Nobody 
expected the car insurance category to get very good. And I think our 
GEICO work—Steve Bassett is the creative director on that—I think the 
work Steve’s led over the years has helped raise the standard for that whole 
industry.
You know, I would love to have more technology business, automobile busi­
ness, and sports business, but working in unexpected categories is rewarding 
in its own way.
Tuten: If you had a magic, fairy wand and with it you could change one thing 
about advertising, what would you change?
Hughes: If I had a magic wand, I would drastically reduce the cynicism in 
the industry. The industry attracts a lot of the smart, bright people. There’s 
always a tendency for smart, bright people to get pretty cynical about things 
and underappreciate the opportunities they have. That cynicism takes a toll. 
You can actually see it sometimes in the advertising. Some advertising can 
be very sleek and impressive, but I think long term, no matter how hip you 
want to be, it’s helpful if you can reduce that cynical edge.
Tuten: Any advice for how to do it?
Hughes: Yes, I think you shouldn’t make advertising for your peers. You 
become a creative director and you start judging all the shows, and then it’s 
hard not to want to impress your peers. Your peers, they are often young, 
highly energized, “type A” males. It’s hard not to get a “fraternity” kind of voice.
One of the things I’m so proud of at our agency is this thing we’ve started 
called “The Mom Complex.”2 It was started by Katherine Wintsch [vice 
president and group planning director], an amazing young planner here who 
2 The Mom Complex is a think tank that seeks to inspire moms to teach the rest of the 
world about the challenges of motherhood. It was inspired by the idea that marketers 
owe mothers more meaningful and true marketing communications. Learn more about 
The Mom Complex at http://themomcomplex.com/site/about.

has also led the planning for the biggest marketer to moms, Walmart. She is 
doing what she calls “opinion parties” with mothers around the world. We 
must improve the quality of advertising to women. If you watch a football 
game this weekend, you’re going to see better commercials than if you 
watched, I don’t know, The View. That’s just a fact. And so I think we must ﬁnd 
ways to radically lift the level of quality of advertising to mothers on a more 
consistent basis. Certainly, Nike has done some wonderful things aimed at 
women over the years, but the whole category needs to be lifted up. And I 
think that would be a huge opportunity for us.
Tuten: Is that part of Martin’s mission at the moment?
Hughes: It is. Absolutely.
Tuten: Which clients are you working on it with?
Hughes: We are working with Kraft, Walmart—both our normal, US client 
and Walmart International—E! and Hasbro.
Tuten: This is not something the brands have to compete about. They can 
all have better advertising directed to women.
Hughes: Yes. What Katherine has done is this: her research has uncovered 
some true-life things for moms and the struggles moms have no matter what 
age their kids are. And it’s not that this will dictate a style of advertising, but 
it is more real in the way people talk to the most important consumer in 
the world.
Tuten: How do you think we ended up with the advertising that didn’t do 
the moms justice to begin with?
Hughes: I think a lot of it is because creative departments everywhere 
except in the fashion industry are dominated by young men. And there’s a lot 
of testosterone, and there’s a lot of energy there. It’s not all bad. Yet there is 
nobody more efﬁcient in the ofﬁce than the young, working mother. She gets 
things done. She has to get things done. The guys often are just off playing ping-
pong or something. But the young mother is efﬁcient and then she gets home 
to her kids. Those guys might hang around the ofﬁce all night long. And they 
will create something competitive, competitive within the industry. They’ll want 
to win the awards—more so than the young mom. But the mom will be more 
responsible. Of course, what I’m describing here are huge generalizations.
Tuten: Right.
Hughes: So don’t get me in trouble here. But, the moms will tend to do 
something that might be better for the client and the audience, but the work 
may not win as many awards. And so the industry has put itself on that kind 
of hamster wheel, where we’re chasing the kinds of things that win awards, 

Chapter 4 |  Mike Hughes: President, The Martin Agency
48
and the kinds of things that win awards become a style for people, rather 
than looking at and listening to the real world.
Tuten: That’s a debate we hear a lot about in the industry, whether we 
should be chasing awards or trying to meet client objectives.
Hughes: What you should do is both. It’s not that it’s about the awards. 
It’s that if you’re not at least interested in the awards, then you’re probably 
not as interested in the craftsmanship that’s so important. But, on the other 
hand, even the best award shows have a lot of stuff that reﬂects the cynicism 
or the fraternity atmosphere.
Tuten: Tell me what you’re reading right now.
Hughes: I’m an old English major who reads very few books. I constantly 
read newspapers and magazines. I’ve got a friend who’s a publisher, and he 
gives me some grief about this. I read the free samples I can get on my iPad 
from different books and rarely get the rest of the book, although I do occa­
sionally. Every year I get a book called The Best American Magazine Writing. 
The magazine editors put it together. You can’t even get it on a reader, and 
so I’m reading the real physical book and I’m just loving it. All these very 
interesting stories.
Tuten: I’ve never heard of that before. I’m going to have to get it.
Hughes: I highly recommend it. It’s a paperback. It comes out every 
December, and it’s the best magazine writing of the year. There’s a lot of 
serendipity because you go into it and you don’t even know what the topic 
is going to be for this next story. It’s amazing how much you can get into all 
the different topics.
Tuten: Mike, I told you when we spoke before that David Oakley summed 
up his interview with me by saying that he wanted to be more like you, so if 
you think of this chapter as being an opportunity to say anything you want 
to say to people who are developing the industry, people who admire you, 
people who feel you mentored them, what would you want to say?
Hughes: One of the advantages we have had over the years is that we were 
far enough away from Madison Avenue and the big agencies and everybody 
else in the industry that advertising people could be our heroes. They could 
really be our heroes. When I was in my twenties, I would read every word 
that Ed McCabe3 wrote or that David Abbott4 wrote. They were heroes to 
3 Founder of Scali, McCabe, Sloves advertising agency in the 1960s, and later founder of 
McCabe & Company. McCabe was the youngest person ever elected to The One Club 
Hall of Fame and is known for developing several iconic advertising campaigns.

me, and they still are. But now they’re also friends. And now I also know that 
David Abbott is a very elegant, fabulous man, and Ed McCabe, who is also a 
good friend, sometimes pretends to be crazy as a loon. This knowledge was 
hugely helpful.
For the last twenty years, I haven’t wanted The Martin Agency to be like 
any other agency. You know, it’s hard not to want to strive to be like oth­
ers. I love and admire and I’m the biggest fan in the world for Wieden and 
Goodby and Crispin and Chiat. I’m the biggest fan in the world, but I don’t 
want The Martin Agency to be like those agencies. I want us to be the best 
agency we can be in our own way. But in the eighties, we made a lot of prog­
ress because we kind of did say, “Okay how can we produce at that level.” 
At the beginning of the eighties, we said we were going to go be like those 
top agencies. And when I was a young writer, one of the things that I would 
sometimes do was in my head say, “Okay, how would Ed McCabe write this 
headline? Or how would David Abbott write it?” And it was an interest­
ing exercise to go through. Have you ever seen this little red book that our 
agency puts out for employees? Our Beautifully Imperfect Company?
Tuten: No, I don’t think I’ve seen it.
Hughes: I will get Helen5 to send you a copy. A few years ago, I gave a talk. 
It was a graduation speech, and it was well received. It got some attention, 
and the guys at work surprised me by turning it into a little book that we 
now give every employee. It talks about how everybody thinks they want 
balance in their life, but what I believe is that you don’t really want balance in 
your life. What you want in your life is joy. You want fun, and you want work 
that you ﬁnd meaningful, and you want to work with people you care about. 
When people talk about the search for balance, that isn’t really right.
For me, my life has always been about joy because I like my work and 
because I’m married to a wonderful woman and I get to go home at night 
to her. She doesn’t expect me to clean up the house or do anything that 
doesn’t bring me joy [laughter]. And joy for me means that I have to ﬁnd 
ways to engage in every part of my life, not just the work part. And so I 
think what a person needs to do to ﬁnd joy is throw yourself into things 
that excite you. I think you should always seek wisdom. One of my disap­
pointments in myself as I am getting old is that I’m not wise. I thought I’d be 
wise at this point. But what I love is that I am a better student than I’ve ever 
been in my life. College would make more sense for me now than it did back

when I was eighteen. I go into every meeting to see what I can learn. Even if 
I’m the presenter at the meeting, I can learn from my audience.
I’m also getting involved in serious discussions at meetings. A couple of years 
ago, I was kind of frustrated because I’d go to meetings and I’d hear the same 
people speaking up in every meeting. I wanted everybody to speak up and 
I thought we needed to hear more diverse voices. I developed this thing I 
called “Beer and Popcorn.” People came into the room at four o’clock, and I 
put some subjects up on the wall. I said, “Let’s pick which one we are going 
to talk about today.” These topics had nothing to do with advertising or 
the agency. One day we ended up with this conversation about religion. Of 
course, that’s one of the things you’re not supposed to be able to talk about, 
but I wanted to demonstrate to people that we could talk about anything. 
We had a fabulous discussion that continued in e-mail messages for weeks 
afterwards. Being part of the conversation, being part of the thinking that 
goes on in a company that is supposed to be both strategic and creative, that 
can be an exciting possibility.
Tuten: You talked about not achieving balance, not really even seeking to 
achieve balance. I think that’s going to be something that people have to 
practice on a day-to-day basis because you’re always working at it—at bal­
ance that is.
Hughes: Yes, you know, there’s this—I don’t care much what hours you 
come to work as long as you get the job done well. And, you know, we’re 
subject to the same laws as any other business that sells its hours and so 
it’s important that we record certain things. But one of the reasons that 
we don’t have any set vacation times for the majority of our people is that 
you can work your own schedule out. And you can even make up your own 
job, which is what I used to do. As long as you can say, “Okay, the company 
needs to make money on what I did and it needs to line up within one of 
our deﬁnitions of what we do as a company.” But from then on, you can just 
make up your job. What I want to do is take away excuses for not doing 
something fabulous.
Tuten: Although that could be intimidating, I imagine, for a lot of people 
who work with you.
Hughes: It is, it is. Some people want to do that and some people don’t, and 
it’s not that it’s an instruction that you have to do it. For some people, they 
want and need a regular job that lets them go home at ﬁve. That’s ﬁne, too. 
But if you’re going to throw yourself into doing really special things, it’s hard. 
You will end up constantly frustrated if you have that typical 9-to-5 job.

We now have a lot of production facilities inside our own agency, but still, 
for an agency like this, we are in Richmond and so if you’re a creative per­
son, you will spend a lot of time on the road for different kinds of video 
production.
That can be a hard life, and it can be hard on families, and so we want to 
help people in any way we can to take some of that burden away.
For example, if you’re going to be gone for a month in Los Angeles on a 
production, we’ll ﬂy your spouse over for a weekend in the middle of it or 
we’ll ﬂy you back home and do things like that and—even for more than 
a weekend—because we know that travel such as that is asking a lot of 
people.
These are things that are important for us—to take care of our people.
Tuten: Tell me what’s ahead for you. You’ve already designed your perfect 
job. So what do you still dream of? What do you still aspire to?
Hughes: Well, I’ve got to make some of these things real. It’s hard to come 
up with a good idea, but it’s harder still to bring those ideas to life and to 
make them happen. I want to see if I can make some of these things happen. 
One of the things Helen tells me all the time is that I like starting projects 
and she likes ﬁnishing them. I’ve had all these different projects going at any 
one time, and I am very guilty of starting things and then not bringing them 
to fruition. So I want to see if I can get a little more disciplined for myself 
and make these projects happen.
Tuten: So what’s the number-one project on the list—if you can tell us?
Hughes: No, I can’t even tell you about the second project.
Tuten: You can tell me after the book comes out. You can share later, just 
because I’m curious.
Hughes: Okay. You know, one more thing about David Oakley. What I like 
about David is his craziness. I wish I had a little bit more craziness. One of 
my partners told me recently that I was so rare because I was a creative 
director who was also a grown-up. I thought that was an insult. I think matu­
rity is a trap in this business, and so a big part of me wants to be more like 
David Oakley. So I guess we have this mutual admiration thing going on.
Tuten: I can deﬁnitely see that. When I talked to David, he deﬁnitely gets joy 
out of everything he’s doing, every day. That was my impression of him.
Hughes: Yes, yes.

Tuten: It seemed like he was always going to do his best work, but he was 
never going to take anything so seriously that it would get him down.
Hughes: That’s true.
I’m ﬂattered that you asked me to be a part of this, so thank you.

Susan Credle
Chief Creative Ofﬁcer 
Leo Burnett North America
Susan Credle joined Leo Burnett (www.leoburnett .us)—the agency responsible 
for such iconic characters as Tony the Tiger, Morris the Cat , the Jolly Green Giant , 
and the Marlboro Man—as the agency’s chief creative ofﬁcer in September 2009. 
Her career began, upon graduation from the University of North Carolina Chapel 
Hill, at BBDO New York. Over her 24 years at BBDO, she rose from a receptionist 
to ultimately become executive creative director and a member of the BBDO New 
York board of directors. Throughout her tenure at BBDO, she created award-
winning work for big-name brands like M&M/Mars,  AT&T, Pepsi, FedEx, and  Visa.
Credle sits on the Creative Review Committee of the Ad Council. In 2004, she was 
inducted into the AAF Advertising Hall of Achievement. In 2008, she received the 
ﬁrst New Generation of Leaders Award from the University of North Carolina 
Journalism School and currently sits on the school’s Board of  Visitors. Credle was 
chosen by Boards magazine as one of their Advertising Women of Excellence, 
which recognizes leaders who have made signiﬁcant creative and business contri­
butions in advertising.
Tracy Tuten: Susan, what led you to advertising as a profession? Did you 
grow up wanting to work in the ﬁeld
Susan Credle: No, not really. I actually really loved the theater and started 
performing on stage in about the seventh grade, and I danced a lot. And I 
5

Chapter 5 | Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America

really didn’t associate the theater and dance as a way of having a livelihood. It 
was more the fun part of my life. When I began to start thinking about what 
I was going to do for work in South Carolina, I thought my choices were 
teacher, doctor, lawyer, businesswoman, banker, and things like that.
I was actually clerking for a law ﬁrm one summer and had to serve a sub-
poena on an advertising agency. I walked in—I think I was sixteen years 
old—and I was like, “What is this place?” It felt like the theater. People 
walking around, you know, kind of a little bit more gregarious, a little less 
business-like. And somebody said, “Oh, we’re an advertising agency.” I never 
thought that the ads, the work that I saw out in the world, had to be made. 
And it felt like an artful business, and I think that’s the ﬁrst time I started 
thinking about it as a possibility.
Tuten: So did you go into college thinking about majoring in advertising?
Credle: No, as a freshman I went in thinking I would do drama. I just 
started there, but I got nervous about it. Maybe drama was a major that I 
couldn’t turn as quickly into a different source of careers. I was worried I 
was pigeonholing myself too much. I started looking for a major that could 
be more useful for careers. I actually ended up in the journalism school, not 
necessarily thinking about advertising, but the journalism school’s curriculum 
was much more broad because they needed you to know a lot about a lot 
of things. I liked the broadness of the curriculum. It also had a great reputa-
tion at the University of North Carolina. So I thought, “Well, the school’s got 
a great reputation and the curriculum is somewhat broad. That could help 
me—that could be good for any career I would want to go into.” Because, I 
mean, when you’re nineteen years old and you’re making these decisions, you 
just don’t know what’s best. I didn’t know.
Tuten: I don’t know that anyone does, even at middle age.
Credle: Right. So I was looking for the best education that would give me 
the broadest sort of sensibilities about anything I might want to do when I 
got out of college. Something that would have the broadest appeal across 
different careers. Then when I ended up in journalism school, I did discover 
the advertising sequence and a professor that I really liked named John 
Sweeney.1 That was the ﬁrst time that I really started thinking, “Wow, maybe 
this might work.”
1 Sweeney is the head of the advertising sequence at UNC Chapel Hill’s School of 
Journalism and Mass Communication.

Tuten: Did you know David Oakley2 at the time?
Credle: Yes. I didn’t know him that well, but yeah. He was always a talent.
Tuten: So Mr. Sweeney has quite a history of producing advertising brains.
Credle: Yes, that’s true. Another one is Stacy Wall, who actually started off 
in advertising and then went on to be a director and now owns a production 
company [The Imperial Woodpecker].
Tuten: That’s amazing. One of those “small world” kinds of things.
Credle: Yeah, yeah [laughter].
Tuten: So how did you get started then, moving from college into your 
career? I think I read that your ﬁrst job was bathroom-break girl?
Credle: Yeah, I went to New York. I actually didn’t choose New York 
because of advertising. I chose New York because of my age. I was like, “I’m 
twenty years old. I’ve lived in the South. I need to see the world, but I don’t 
have much money, so if I’m going to see the world without a lot of travel, I 
think New York City might be the place to bet on.” So I actually went there 
to be exposed to as different a world as I [could] imagine as quickly as pos­
sible, and I thought I would be up there for three months. As it turned out, I 
never left until I took the job [with Leo Burnett] in Chicago.
When I got to New York, I thought, “Well, advertising is still of interest to 
me, so I’ll start with it.” That was in 1985. I went to BBDO because it was 
the agency of the year and I thought, “Well, if they’re that good, I’ll start 
there.” The only job I could get was giving the receptionists their bathroom 
breaks. So I did. I said, “Sure. I’d like to be around the best.” So I started 
doing that and really got to know the company. I started introducing myself 
and asking the heads of department what they did, how they did it, and what 
kind of skills it took. I was really open to anything. I found all the different 
departments very interesting.
At BBDO at the time, the creative department really seemed to be the 
department that everybody else served. And, coming from a background in 
theater and making things—the creative side of things appealed to me a lot. 
So I started focusing in on the creative department as a place I would want 
to work.

Tuten: So you started as a creative and you’ve stayed true to that thus far?
Credle: Yeah. And, you know, it’s funny. I think that I probably have a little 
more of a planner3 in me, but we didn’t have planners when I started. 
Instead, we kind of started with thoughtful planner behavior creatively and 
then got to the craft of the message. So the planning part comes at the front 
end. Some people are better at the front, and then some are better at the 
back end. I enjoy that whole process.
Tuten: Did you have a mentor?
Credle: It’s interesting. This is an interesting question because I’m sure 
some people that greatly shaped my career would say that they were men­
tors, but I’m not sure that they were mentors as much as people that I 
admired, that I observed. I think we deﬁne a mentor as someone who sort 
of guides you and maintains a dialogue with you. Quite frankly, the atmo­
sphere that I grew up in, people were too busy to do that. But what I did get 
in terms of great mentorship was simply watching some of the best in the 
business at the time do their job and seeing how they got it done, where 
they paid attention to work, how they crafted things. The mentors in my 
life were the result of just the incredible gift of being around very talented 
people.
Tuten: Anyone you’d like to name?
Credle: Phil Dusenberry and Charlie Miesmer were two. Later on, a guy 
named David Lubars,4 watching how he worked. And then I was fortu­
nate that a lot of my mentors or a lot of people that helped me be better 
were actually people that I got to work with who were often times much 
younger—like Gerry Graff. Any talent that you’re around and you get to 
observe how they work, it becomes impressive. And it helps you—even if it’s 
not a formal mentorship.
Tuten: Just soaking it up.
Credle: Yeah.
Tuten: Were there any special lessons that you learned from any of those 
people?

Credle: Phil Dusenberry—his love of craft was just amazing. And he always 
explored options. I remember Charlie Miesmer saying something to me at 
one time, this is when we worked mostly in ﬁlm, but he said, “Susan, you 
should walk around when you’re on set and just frame up—frame up ﬁlm.” 
He meant frame up what you’re seeing and ﬁnd things that you believe are 
done the right way. And never be limited by what you thought you were 
going to go in and get. Always be expansive and always push the work and 
look for ways to make it better. It’s never static until we shift. So we’re 
always looking for, “Is this the best way we could say this? Is this the best 
angle? Is this the best piece of music?” And just that push to always better 
something. That was a big lesson.
Then some of the lessons I learned were what to take, what deserves a lot 
of attention, and what you should let just go. That’s a hard one because you 
can, in a subjective business like creative, worry every little thing. What hap­
pens is that you have clients that grow to the point that they get irritated 
because it becomes so difﬁcult. So, you have to know how to hold onto 
the things that really do make a difference and to push those, but not be so 
myopic that everybody who works with you gets exhausted.
Tuten: That sounds like something you’d have to work on every single day.
Credle: I do.
Tuten: Do you have rules like, “I’m always going to pay attention to X? X, Y, 
and Z are always important?” Or do you just evaluate every situation?
Credle: Every situation. You know, I think it’s like children. There are chil­
dren that you have high expectations from and you demand more from, and 
there are children that you just pray that they get their teeth brushed in the 
morning. I think ideas and brands are like that. There are some brands that 
you feel you can push, and I think that starts with a good relationship with 
the client. Then it’s understanding their stomach for adventure and want­
ing to try things. Those are the ones that I pay attention to and then push 
harder and harder. And then there are some clients that I know we need to 
take baby steps with and slowly get them used to the idea of doing certain 
things—and those I don’t push as hard.
It’s hard because you want them all to be great, but I think understanding 
that appetite for creativity is important. I had a client once say he didn’t like 
me. He didn’t not like me. It was that he didn’t like my goals at work because 
I said I wanted to hit home runs, and he said, “I just want to hit singles and 
get around the bases.” It was an interesting, honest conversation. At the time, 
I was younger and really needed to prove that I had a decent portfolio. Single 
bases didn’t seem like a very good career move for me.

Chapter 5 |  Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America
58
But for that brand, single bases were probably what he felt he needed at the 
time. Whereas now, when you’re in a more senior position, I think you’ve 
earned the right to understand just how far you can push. I think that’s why 
younger creatives are so aggressive with their work, and I don’t blame them. 
That’s what makes or breaks their future.
Tuten: Can you give me an example of a brand that you pushed? I know 
you might not be able to given client conﬁdentiality and things like that, but if 
you’ve got a story you can share, please do.
Credle: Well, you know, there’s a brand that we all pushed together. It was 
M&Ms. In 1995, my partner Steve Rutter and I were told that we were going 
to run the M&Ms account. We were kind of bummed because it didn’t seem 
like a very creative account. We went out to talk to the client. At the time, 
the client was Paul Michaels, who’s now the CEO. In one conversation, we 
realized he was on our side. He was ready to go. He wanted to push this 
brand to a place that the company, quite frankly, probably wasn’t ready [to 
be in]. Or if they were ready to go, they hadn’t thought to go there. Together 
we recreated the M&Ms characters and went on to give them unique 
personalities.
Today, those personalities that we pushed and created are represented in 
a store in Times Square. The M&Ms have very distinct personalities and are 
very character-driven. That was an incredible experience, where we took a 
brand to a completely different place—but [Paul Michaels] gave us permis­
sion because he said he wanted it so badly.
Tuten: Is that the same time that you helped to create Blue?5
Credle: Yeah. We actually did all the characters’ personalities straightaway, 
because we wanted them to play as an ensemble. The ﬁrst ones we intro­
duced in the new character form were Red, Yellow, and Blue. Blue was sort 
of the observant part of the ensemble. If you think about an ensemble cast 
like Seinfeld, Jerry Seinfeld sort of plays the role of commentator. You know, 
the character observes and the comedy comes out of his observations.
[Think of Blue] versus Red and Yellow. Red would be much more like 
George, the blustery comedian, and Yellow would be much more like 
Kramer. Then we went on and added some other characters, but we pur­
posely made them play like an ensemble, a comedic troupe.
Tuten: And did the characterizations start off with Seinfeld in mind?
5 Blue is an M&M candy color brought on in 1995 after an extensive voting campaign by 
consumers, who chose the new color.

Credle: No, we started off with archetypes. We went back and studied any 
comedy troupe from Shakespeare on and looked at which quintessential 
characters worked together well. They’re easy. You can dissect any comedic 
troupe into some basic types. There’s usually the blustery character—the 
blustery one thinks he’s smarter than any other character. There’s usually 
the idiot savant, the “clueless but is always okay” character. There’s ­usually 
an observant commenting on the characters’ character. There’s usually a 
nebbish—a nervous or a paranoid, overly intelligent character. And then 
there’s a female [laughter], a female or two that are usually like the Lucille 
Ball, comedic, almost physical character, and then usually there’s somebody 
who’s the sexy and “in control of my femininity” character. You could do that. 
You could break that down with almost any comedic troupe, and you’ll see 
similar shades of these iconic characters.
Tuten: So your drama training is coming into play heavily in your creative 
work?
Credle: [Laughter.] Yeah, probably. Yeah. I always said that brands were like 
roles. If you were an actor, you’d look at a brand and say, “Okay, how would 
this character behave? What would they wear? How would they talk? You 
know, how would they react?” And if you think about it, brands are a lot like 
a character. What role do they play in people’s lives? How should they talk, 
how should they act, how should they be? The more you can understand the 
role of a brand or what that brand’s character is, I think the stronger the 
work holds together.
Tuten: And that’s how Green came about?
Credle: Well, Green came about because we had basically worked a lot with 
Red and Yellow and Blue the ﬁrst couple of years. We thought, “I bet we can 
refresh the brand just by using new characters that are in our ensemble and 
giving them a stage.” So we said, “Let’s do Green.” You know, Blue had had a 
little campaign. Red and Yellow had been carrying the brunt of the work. We 
knew Green was going to be a female and [we] kind of knew her personality. 
There was a great myth in my high school about green M&Ms. I forget—
either the green M&Ms made you horny or you got pregnant. There was 
always some kind of sexual myth around the green M&Ms. We came up with 
a campaign called, “What is it about the green ones?” That kind of deﬁned 
her role as this kind of provocative, sexy, conﬁdent girl character.
Tuten: How did you end up being her voice?
Credle: Well, I haven’t done much of her voice. [Another] woman, Cree 
Summer, does her voice most of the time. I think she’s Canadian, but she has 

Chapter 5 |  Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America

a little bit of a twang, and every once in a while when we were doing demos, 
we would get used to something that was on the recording that I had done, 
and we would say, “Oh, let’s just leave that little piece.” But it’s not much.
Tuten: You look happy right now, so that must be a fond memory, being the 
voice of Green.
Credle: Yeah, yeah. Just the whole character-driven campaign and the fact 
that it’s still going strong even though I’m not there anymore. It’s a pretty 
amazing thing to have happened.
Tuten: Do you have any favorite campaigns that you’re working on now?
Credle: Well, I really think the Allstate “Mayhem” campaign work is a favor­
ite. You know, we started that—it broke last summer, so it’s about a year-
and-a-half old.
Tuten: That’s one of my personal favorites.
Credle: I’m so glad to have gotten something like that out, coming into 
Chicago. Allstate’s been a phenomenal client, a great partnership. The way 
that came about is we were sitting down with them, and they were very 
clear that they were ready to go. They wanted to push it. We had some nice 
dialogue about how far [to push]. We tried to make sure that we didn’t just 
do comedy for comedy’s sake, but that the campaign actually had a point, 
which is that the brand is about protection. Even though “Mayhem” is funny 
and amusing, it really has a very strong protection message to it.
Tuten: Yeah, deﬁnitely. Last year, right around this time, my husband and I 
had gone to get a Christmas tree.
Credle: [Laughter.] Oh no.
Tuten: And my husband didn’t do the best job tying it to the top of the car.
Credle: Yeah.
Tuten: It ﬂew off, on the highway.
Credle: Mm-hmm.
Tuten: At sixty-ﬁve miles per hour. Hit the car behind us.
Credle: There’s nothing that works better than truth.
Tuten: The very next day, my mom calls and says, “Oh my God! You’ve got 
to see this Allstate commercial.”
Credle: That’s great. Oh, that’s wonderful. When you can relate to the ads—
that’s it. I think the one spot or two spots that people have really enjoyed 

Advertisers at Work
61
are the GPS spot, the “recalculating GPS spot,” and “the blind spot,” when he 
says, “You’re good.” Like your experience with the Christmas tree, the more 
you’ve almost had something happen because of something we’re showing 
you, you’re like, “Oh my Lord. I have met Mayhem.”
Tuten: Exactly, exactly. So it deﬁnitely hits home and made it all the more 
hilarious to our entire family.
Credle: That’s great.
Tuten: Your current role is chief creative ofﬁcer. What’s a typical day like?
Credle: Oh my goodness. Typical day: I usually start at nine. I walk—I try 
to walk to work. It’s a little cold right now, but I have about a thirty-minute 
walk to work and get in about nine. My day is pretty packed because we 
have over ﬁfty brands that we work with. If you just do the math, the 
amount of people that want to come in and talk about what they’re up to, 
what their ideas are—it’s back to back. I’ve learned to put blank holes in my 
calendar so that I have a little bit of time every now and again. But it’s meet­
ings all day, and then around six o’clock, the meetings stop. And I would say 
from about six to eight, I try to catch up on all the e-mails that I probably 
missed—and correspondence. Then, I try, on an average day, to get out [of 
the ofﬁce] between seven and eight. When we’re busy, you know, you just do 
it. You stay until the work’s done or you’re done. I used to—ten years ago, I 
think—work all night. I have to get a little sleep now. You do get to a point 
where you’re like, “I can’t. I’ve got to go to sleep.” [Laughter.]
Tuten: How do you prepare mentally for each day?
Credle: Well, three days a week a trainer comes to my house. We do a lot 
of breathing exercises and stretching and just kind of ﬁnding a place where 
you ﬁnd some strength. And I think it’s important, too, because in this posi­
tion, what you ﬁnd is that when you start work, at every second of the day, 
you are giving out, whether it’s advice or like how we’re talking and I’m giving 
you this story—but it’s always helping other people.
Tuten: Right.
Credle: And I ﬁnd that starting the day with someone helping me is a good 
gift. I try to start every day thinking about—and this is going to sound so 
corny—“How can I be a positive inﬂuence today?”
Tuten: No. I don’t think that sounds corny. I think that sounds amazing.
Credle: [Laughter.] I think as a leader or as someone in this position—
sometimes I just want to go kill everybody. But as a leader you want every­
thing to be right, you want everybody to come through for you. I think if 
you’re not careful, your ﬁrst instinct is to really be frustrated with people, 
4

Chapter 5 |  Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America
62
and while that’s the feeling, I don’t think it gets you anywhere. So I’m try­
ing to reframe everyday frustration into something else. If I’m frustrated, 
it means that people need me to help them do something that they’re not 
doing right now. To me, I’m blaming myself as much as the people that I need 
to do something. It’s like, “I must be doing something wrong because they’re 
not getting where we need to get.” So, that’s a hard one.
I did have a boss years ago who said something beautiful. I asked him, “How 
do you lead? How do you get people to do stuff?” And he said, “You know, 
interestingly, it’s not one leadership style. For every individual, I have to think 
about what would motivate them—because we’re not all motivated by the 
same things.” And that was really interesting. He said to really think about 
people. “What can I tell them? What can I do for them that will motivate 
them to be better?” There’s no one answer.
Tuten: In the group that you lead, everyone is a creative?
Credle: Well, it’s interesting. When I came here, I said, “I didn’t come here 
to run a creative department. I came here to run a creative agency.” And I 
think if you have the creative mindset, you’d bleed over to all departments, 
because they’re all part of getting us to the best work. So I work with lots of 
different people, but my line of sight should be the creatives.
Tuten: If you’re in a different area of the agency, I think we have the ste­
reotype that creatives are all alike. You know, they’re different from us [my 
background is in research], and they’re the same within—but when you think 
about how to motivate them, is everybody different? 
Credle: Incredibly different. I have creatives who, if you’re hard on them, 
burst into tears and become dysfunctional. I have creatives who, if you’re not 
hard on them, think you’re a weak leader and aren’t getting anything from 
you. I have creatives who, if they’re in a vulnerable situation, start acting like 
jerks, so I have to work to make sure that really strong people surround 
them so that they don’t get scared. I have creatives who believe they’re 
better than they are. I have creatives who believe they’re not as good as 
they are. I have creatives who, if you give them too much, shut down. I have 
creatives who, if you give them too little, they shut down.
Tuten: Did you know that you were going to become a psychologist when 
you took this role?
Credle: [Laughter.] I do know. I told somebody, “The higher up you go in 
this job, man—you’re just a therapist!”
There’s a lot to be said for playing the role of therapist at work. Forget the 
creative department or an agency. I think once you get to a leadership role—

Advertisers at Work
63
and by that, I don’t necessarily mean a job of “leader” because I recognize 
that there are leaders at all levels of an organization—or even a manage­
ment role, you have to consider the needs of the people and how to work 
based on their needs.
Tuten: Right. When I was studying your background, I read about the scale 
you use at Leo Burnet to judge the creative work, the “HumanKind scale.”6
Credle: Yeah.
Tuten: That’s what you use to judge work or that your whole team uses to 
judge work. How did that scale come about? How was it created and how 
do you use it creatively?
Credle: Well, my boss, who hired me, Mark Tutssel,7 was largely responsible. 
It [the HumanKind scale] was created before I got here. I think just before I 
got here, so that was over two years ago. I think it’s like any good idea: when 
it seems to be brilliant, there are a lot of people that claim it’s theirs. When 
it’s a piece of crap, everybody runs from it and says, “I didn’t do it.” This one, 
thank goodness, a lot of people want to be its parent, but I credit my boss, 
Mark Tutssel. If he didn’t come up with the whole thing, he pushed to have it.
It’s interesting because I, without naming it, have been kind of practicing 
HumanKind in my career without knowing it—that is, I always believed 
brands could have meaning in people’s lives beyond “it makes my hair clean” 
or “it makes my teeth not fall out.” That, if [brands] have a voice, they can do 
so much more than just sell a product, and that by doing more than selling 
a product, you build brand loyalty. It’s all in service to capitalism. But when 
I saw the HumanKind scale—well, that’s one of the reasons why I took the 
job at Leo Burnett. Because the scale showed me Leo Burnett is a com­
pany that’s dedicated to the same things that I’m dedicated to, which is not 
just quarterly sales but making a difference in the world—or attempting 
to. Making a difference in people’s lives gives this business a lot more value. 
Personal value for me.
Tuten: Can you tell us how it’s used?
Credle: The ﬁrst way we use it is to really ask, “Where on the scale do we 
think the work we’re looking at lives?” And if the idea is, “Okay, you told me 
6 The HumanKind scale is a scale from 1 to 10 that Leo Burnett uses to judge the value 
of ideas and creative work. The higher the score, the more valuable the idea or the work. 
Leo Burnett strives to never produce anything below a 5.

why I should buy this brand—that’s a ﬁve.” If it’s a beautiful way of telling 
me—that’s a six. If it’s really well crafted—seven. Eight is if it starts to really 
change the way I think and feel. Nine changes the way I live. That’s a really 
hard one to do. And then ten changes the world. But it gives us something to 
aspire to.
Tuten: When your teams come in and share concepts with you, do they 
introduce it that way? Do they come in and say, “We think we’ve hit a seven 
here?” 
Credle: It’s starting to happen. It’s young in our culture, so I think they’re 
intuitively starting to think that way. We meet quarterly as a global com-
pany. Some of the top creators from around the world get together, and we 
actually look at the work and we grade it. So creatives will know what the 
company believes their work is living up to. We put numbers to it so we can 
kind of put some math to how we’re doing and what we’re doing.
Tuten: It’s such a subjective business, and so to have some objective mea-
sures can help.
Credle: Yeah, it does. We are working with the research team to show how 
the work that is getting scored high in our global meetings tracks from a 
business standpoint. And we’re seeing signiﬁcant parallels: that the work that 
this company believes is living in the six, seven, eight numbers is actually 
producing work that’s helping clients.
Tuten: Have you had any nine or ten ideas?
Credle: I think there was one nine—no tens. The one nine was for Earth 
Hour. It started in Sydney. Earth Hour is on Earth Day. Everybody in the 
world turns off their lights for one hour. It’s been a bigger concept in Europe. 
The important thing is—it changes the way people live. Just to have over a 
billion people turn out their lights on one day is a big gesture.
Tuten: Yeah, that’s amazing. Do you have people who’ve set a goal like that, 
to say, “This year I want to come up with a nine or a ten?”
Credle: Yeah, I hope they all are saying that, but it’s really hard even to get 
an eight. We don’t give out many of those in our company. We feel like a 
brand is healthy if it’s getting solid ﬁves. That’s good, strong work, but still 
a ﬁve is just a nice solid, good job. Sixes—sixes start to be interesting. And 
sevens are really where we hope brands start to live.
Tuten: I love the idea of the scale.
Credle: The bottom of the scale is really great, too. When I see an idea is 
destructive, then I can say, “We as an agency won’t put this out.” It might be

funny, it might break through, it might make noise—but we don’t do that at 
this company. And then two is no idea. Rarely do you see twos. Three is a 
hard one because it means the brand or the idea is invisible. And that’s what 
I think we, as an entire industry, are largely guilty of: putting out work that 
says and does the right thing, but nobody sees it.
Tuten: It just blends into the background.
Credle: Yeah.
Tuten: What’s your favorite campaign that never was, the one you wish has 
been produced but wasn’t?
Credle: [Laughter.] Oh, let me see. I’m sure there are lots of them. There 
was a campaign that we wrote years ago for Gillette that I loved. It was 
called “For the man, not the masochist.” I wanted to do it so badly because 
I thought to put the word “masochist” into the world would be great. It was 
a good vocabulary word. The point was to get people to go from disposable 
razors to a real Gillette razor. The whole campaign was about people who 
loved pain. The tag was something like, “The only reason you should be using 
a disposable razor is if you really love pain.”
Tuten: And why didn’t it ﬂy?
Credle: Because everyone thought nobody in America would know what 
the word “masochist” meant [laughter].
Tuten: Oh, that’s sad.
Credle: [Laughter.] I know, but I’m still on a mission. That’s my point: when 
we put words like that out there, I think we make a contribution to the 
world because we’re actually teaching vocabulary.
Tuten: Absolutely. I can remember when I was in high school some kid 
studying for SATs or something had come across the word “instigator.” That 
became this little trend for a few weeks in the high school—everyone was 
trying to ﬁt the word “instigator” into regular conversations.
Credle: Well, it’s interesting. There are tons [of other examples] if I sat 
down and thought about it. Every day there’s something that doesn’t ﬂy and 
you’re like, “Ahh. That would have been good.”
Tuten: Do you have a special ﬁle you stick them in in case they can come 
back to life later?
Credle: No. I probably should. But it’s funny. I’ve always believed that the 
work that I really love usually works so well for the one brand that it 
shouldn’t be too easy to push into something else.

Chapter 5 |  Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America

Tuten: Leo Burnett is known for its eraserless pencils. Can you tell us about 
those pencils and what they mean in terms of the organization’s philosophy?
Credle: Well, I think the ﬁrst thing you’ll see if you come to the company is 
a lot of illustrations that show that the work that we make comes out of the 
pencil. You know, when Leo Burnett [began], print was really the craft or the 
medium, so there was a lot of writing. Print was a very copy-driven medium 
at the time. When Leo Burnett started [the company], his point was that you 
have to write and write and write and write—down to the nub to get where 
you need to go. And to think about how our work comes through this very 
simple machine, the pencil, powered by a human brain. What is nice about 
the eraserless pencil for me is that it says there are no bad ideas and you 
should never erase—because the bad ideas get you to the better ideas. So, 
it’s okay to write down everything. And don’t think that the thing that you 
wrote doesn’t have value.
Tuten: I love that idea. It relates a lot to Malcolm Gladwell’s ten thousand 
hours. You can’t get to ten thousand if you didn’t start with one.8
Credle: Yep. It was funny. My dad was asking me for some help. He’s with 
UNC Memorial Hospital and he needed to name a residents’ program that 
he was working on. We were hanging out, and so I said, “Okay, I’ll think about 
it.” About ﬁfteen minutes later, I sent him an e-mail across the room with an 
idea that I thought would work. He e-mailed me back saying, “How much do 
I owe you?” And I e-mailed him: “$30,000.” And he said, “That only took you 
ﬁfteen minutes.” And I replied, “No, it took me forty-eight years. You just saw 
the last ﬁfteen minutes.”
Tuten: [Laughter.] With the history that honors the pencil, what is it like for 
Leo Burnett to work in the digital age?
Credle: [Laughter.] I think it was Clay Shirky9 that said “when a medium 
is taken for granted, then it becomes important.” In a weird way, creating 
for new mediums, as long as they’ve reached a point of being important en 
masse, it shouldn’t be an issue. As a creative person, you think about how 
you communicate in your life and you use those tools to do that. So from a 
creative standpoint, I think it kind of almost happens naturally.
8 In his book, Outliers (Little, Brown & Company, 2008), Gladwell surmised that the most 
successful people in any ﬁeld have at least 10,000 hours of practice before they become 
a top performer.

I remember when I ﬁrst signed up for Facebook when it ﬁrst started, and 
there was nobody on it. It was hilarious. People were like, “Well, what do 
we do here? . . . I don’t know.” And then, as it became more and more mass, 
you start understanding how you’re using it, what you do on it, how people 
use it. And then as a creative, you go, “Okay, if people are using it like that, 
why don’t we do this?” So you start using the mediums when they become a 
place where people are taking them for granted. That’s okay.
I think where we’re having to play catch-up is on the actual delivery—in 
making it, because these back ends are incredibly complex. [Doing it all 
ourselves] would be like saying as a creative department we have to build 
the elevators for a company’s building. It’s like, “Whoa. When did that get in 
our line of sight?” And what I’m wrestling with right now is how much of 
this company should be in the production digital delivery business versus the 
ideation and strategic business of using new media. And then we go to the 
best-in-class, back-end delivery places to make it.
It really follows the ﬁlm production model. Very few agencies keep a great 
ﬁlm production [capability] in-house. There are a couple of reasons why: 
because the talent’s always changing, so you would date yourself very quickly 
by building that. The other is the amount of the work—when you’re in pro­
duction, the intensity and the amount of hours that it takes. It really works 
better in a freelance basis, where people come in, work hard on a job, and 
when it’s done, they take a respite.
I think this is going to be the future—outsourcing to the best-in-class back 
end. The problem is that in the past in ﬁlm production, the ﬁlm companies 
rarely, if ever, competed with the agencies for creation of the content. They 
stayed on the other side of making the content. Whereas in new media, 
there’s such a blurred line of creating and making, and there are agencies 
that want to do both. Right now the competition is there.
Tuten: So when you hire, you still hire art directors and copywriters. You’re 
not hiring creative technologists?
Credle: Yeah, we are hiring those people. It’s just a question of how many 
of them. I really want the kind of creative technologist that knows where 
to go to make ﬁlm work and how to supervise it, in the same way that ﬁlm 
producers knew the best directors, the best editors, the best music houses. 
They knew even before the set, they could look at the scope of a project 
and say, “We’re going to need two cameras or we’re going to need three 
days or we’re gonna . . .” They became very well-equipped to understand bid­
ding and what was needed to create . . . to turn an idea on a piece of paper 
into the real thing. And I think that with creative technologists, we need

people that can look at a social concept—you know, whether it’s a social 
media idea or a game, whatever we’re doing—and be able to look at it and 
say, “What kind of team? How long? How much money? Who would we go 
to? How would we put this bench together that will get us to the best-in-
class delivery?” This is all theory right now, but I’ve believed it for ten years, 
and it’s not over—it seems to be going faster and faster towards that than 
away from that.
Tuten: We’ll see what happens.
Credle: I know. I’m putting it out there.
Tuten: Susan, what’s been the best moment in your career thus far?
Credle: Hmm—wow. There’s so many. One will always be the M&M charac­
ters. To have created something that doesn’t go away is pretty special. We’ll 
see. Maybe one day they’ll stop doing the characters or they’ll change them, 
but right now, we’re seventeen years strong, and what we created in 1995 
is alive and well and surpassed all of the possibilities I thought they had. So 
that’s what I’ll talk about I think long after I’m ﬁnished with this career. The 
other thing is just the incredible talent, throughout my twenty-ﬁve years, that 
I’ve been able to work with and chat with and talk with—from directors to 
actors to musicians to editors. It’s just incredible the kind of people I’ve been 
allowed to engage with.
Tuten: I see a bottle of champagne on the desk behind you. Is that from 
something special?
Credle: No, that’s actually from Stacy Wall’s new company, Imperial 
Woodpecker. This is how Imperial Woodpecker announced the latest direc­
tor: a bottle of champagne with Peter Martin’s name on it. So we’re actually 
celebrating the new director, Peter Martin [laughter].
Tuten: That’s a fun way to introduce someone.
Credle: Yeah, that boy’s creative.
Tuten: What inspires you?
Credle: What inspires me? I think what inspires me are talented people. 
They give me energy. Smart people, dreamers, people that go, people that 
have characteristics that I don’t have.
Tuten: What are those?
Credle: [Laughter.] Humor, comedy.
Tuten: You don’t think you have that?

Credle: Everybody says that I’m funny, but I don’t know. I’ve never thought 
so. I guess that’s why a guy like Gerry Graff I just enjoy being around so 
much—because of his wit. And I think it’s just a guy kind of locker room 
humor that I just ﬁnd hilarious. I don’t understand at all. Some guy told me, 
“All you have to do is get a bunch of sugar and then just don’t edit yourself 
and you can get that sophomoric comedy coming out of you.”
Life inspires me, just observing. I was thinking today, “Man, I’ve been in 
the ofﬁce so long. You know, I just want to go see stuff.” Like I was in the 
Museum of Contemporary Art this past weekend, and I saw this cool thing. 
And it was great. It was just so simple. An artist had done an exhibit where 
he had taken old TV sets and plugged them into the wall—so you just get 
the static. And he had painted scenes on the screens, and the static became 
water. It was just beautiful. That was just great.
Tuten: What an amazing idea.
Credle: Yeah. And, just watching people, break the conventional, see things 
in a different way. That’s always amazing to me. I love it.
Tuten: Imagine you have a magic, fairy wand and with it you can change one 
thing about advertising. What do you change?
Credle: Impatience. Well, maybe not impatience. Maybe that’s not the right 
word. The one thing I would change is I would love to make people believe 
that experimentation and doing is not going to hurt them. The idea of having 
to test something or quantify it or get enough people to agree is not going 
to get us to the best place fastest. It’s actually swinging, you know? Taking 
some chances is not a dangerous thing. We overworry everything, whereas if 
we would simply just act and do, we would get so much further faster.
We did a thing for Secret this past year. This is a great example. There was 
no [creative] brief, but a woman on the team really felt—she really wanted 
to do something for anti-bullying. She designed all these cool t-shirts, or had 
Leo Burnett design them. I just thought it would be a nice thing for Secret to 
give to girls, but we couldn’t ﬁgure out how or where. Then we were talking, 
and I said, “I think the problem is that you have this thing that you want to 
do, but it doesn’t relate back to the brand at all.” We went to Secret and we 
said, “We have a movement that we think we should start. It’s called ‘Mean 
Stinks’. And it will be our anti-bullying campaign.”
And so there was no brief, there was nothing, and the client said, “We have 
two print insertions in People and Cosmo. Let’s see what we can do. And 
we can do a Facebook thing.” And we said, “All right.” So we had very little 
money, very little media, but some good scalable media. And we did a couple 

Chapter 5 |  Susan Credle: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett North America
70
of print ads and a little bit of a Facebook thing. The print ads said, “Say some­
thing nice behind someone’s back at Facebook Secret: Mean Stinks.” And 
within two weeks, we had over 200,000 girls talking on the Facebook page 
and apologizing and saying they wished they had not been bullies. It contin­
ues to grow and Procter & Gamble gave “Mean Stinks” their Global Purpose 
Award this year.
It all happened just because they did it. It didn’t go through testing. They just 
put a little money behind it, just a little bit. Like no harm, no foul. It wasn’t 
like they bet the bank on it. They said, “Just run a couple of print ads and let’s 
see what happens.” And now they’re like, “Holy cow. This might be our cam­
paign.” We could have hemmed and hawed and said, “Well, that’s not really 
what we’re doing . . . .” But they took a chance. They did something that 
wasn’t quite in their line of sight. And we are all beneﬁting now.
Tuten: That sounds like a nine to me.
Credle: Yeah, but we don’t do enough of that. We don’t do enough “Let’s 
try stuff.” If we have an idea for a client and it’s an easy thing for them to 
do, they should just do it. Yet we’ll spend seven hours talking about, “Should 
we? Should we not? You know, we probably shouldn’t.” And in the time we 
analyzed it, we could have done it and seen if it was something that would 
have resonated. That’s the one thing that I think [that’s different], than the 
old school way of using focus groups. I think this new media and this way 
of getting people’s opinion in a more organic way—I think we’ll see some 
signiﬁcant changes in that in the next ﬁve to ten years.
Tuten: Just doing it and seeing what happens?
Credle: People forget that the reason we did such rigor, especially to televi­
sion commercials, is because it’s not that the commercial was expensive to 
do—I mean, it costs money—but it’s that you’re going to put $30, $40, $50 
million dollars behind it in media. And, if there’s a way to get a good feeling 
of which communications you want to put a lot of your mass media money 
behind, we should be doing it.
Tuten: And you can do it in social for very little and see what happens.
Credle: Yeah, exactly.
Tuten: One last question for you. What’s ahead for you? What next steps, 
dreams, aspirations?
Credle: Well, it’s interesting. Okay, I think the short-term answer is I really 
would like to see Leo Burnett and its HumanKind philosophy strongly come 
to life. So more things like “Mean Stinks.” I would like to be able to talk to 

Advertisers at Work
71
you about that and you—in the same way that you know what “Mayhem” 
is—be able to say, “Oh, I love it. It’s doing such great things for the world.”
I’d really like to see this company have a lot of famous work that lives the 
HumanKind scale, or lives at the top of it. I’d like to see the business of 
advertising regain its focus a little bit. I think we’re, as an industry, all over the 
place. And the question is: have the basic principles of marketing and com­
munication really changed that radically? Or do we need to get back and 
kind of relearn some of them?
I really like building brands versus doing advertising. And I’d like to turn 
around in a couple of years and say that the M&Ms’ story that I have—there 
are a few more to go with it. As for the dream, I was thinking when in your 
life do you kind of get off of the career path and get into the “give back” 
path? What I realized is that while I think I would get a lot out of working 
with children and volunteering and all of that—I think I would love it—but I 
can have more impact staying in this career and working on the HumanKind 
scale and as a sort of “giving back” path. I could give back by tutoring a child 
on Monday night, which I have done, but I can give more through my career.
Tuten: The level of reach is completely different.
Credle: I think that the personal reward is better on the micro scale, but 
the effect is more on the macro scale. And it also seems like that’s a great 
way to pay off a quarter of a century investment.
Tuten: In yourself?
Credle: In the career. It’s like, what was the point of getting here? I’m not 
very motivated by money. I mean, it’s not bad [laughter]. But it’s not a huge 
motivator for me, things and stuff. But inﬂuencing and trying to make a 
difference—those are pretty big things for me.
One of the things I do is encourage agencies and brands to realize that 
besides doing entertaining work that breaks through and sells stuff, we have 
a social responsibility to put something out there that hopefully does some­
thing in this world for people. And it doesn’t mean that it has to be altru­
istic. I mean, M&Ms—we believe that we should tell really good jokes. We 
should write really well. The characters should be very, very well developed 
and crafted. But I loved working on the brand because we just were telling 
people, “Don’t forget to have fun.” You know, smile every once in a while. I 
truly believe that’s good for the world.

Marshall Ross is chief creative ofﬁcer of Cramer-Krasselt (C-K; www.c-k.com) 
where he’s been a part of the leadership team behind the agency’s rise to the 
second-largest independent agency in the United States, with $1 billion in annual 
billings. C-K has grown by nearly 50 percent since 2005 with clients such as 
Corona Extra, Edward Jones, Hilton Hotels Worldwide and Porsche.
As chief creative ofﬁcer, Ross has crafted award-winning campaigns for numerous 
clients, garnering everything from Efﬁes to Webbys to Cannes Lions. Ross’s creative 
passions are never ending. His ability to nurture cross-platform creativity—paired 
with the agency’s integrated structure and culture—has helped the agency consis­
tently deliver on its mission to “Make friends, not ads” long before it became trendy 
to do so: from CareerBuilder’s Monk-e-Mail viral sensation; to helping Corona fans 
“Find Your Beach” online, ofﬂine, or wherever they ﬁnd themselves; to enlisting pas­
sionate Porsche-philes to help create relevance for the expanding lineup of Porsche 
cars.
Before joining C-K, Ross was a copywriter and creative supervisor at Foote, Cone & 
Belding. At the age of 27, he started a creative boutique, Mitchiner, Ross & Kahn, 
which after a successful run was acquired in 1992 by Campbell Mithun Esty, 
where Ross assumed the post of executive creative director.
Tracy Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in the ﬁeld

Chapter 6 |  Marshall Ross: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Cramer-Krasselt

Marshall Ross: Well, I don’t know that I understood what the ﬁeld was. I 
knew that there were two things that had a gravitational pull for me. One was 
that my father was a lifelong salesman. That’s what he did. And he worked for 
Encyclopedia Britannica—actually, World Book Encyclopedia. He sold it door to 
door. And then by the time I was around in his life, he was a furrier and worked 
for a large furrier in Chicago and managed the store and always had this amazing 
rapport with customers and was able to help them see their way to saying yes.
I think some of that has to be hereditary because when I was thirteen, I 
remember working in my uncle’s store and being a pretty good salesperson. 
I mean, I was a little kid, and I was selling clothes to adults. When I was in 
high school, my father got me a job at a big clothing store. And I was sixteen, 
seventeen years old, and I was selling suits to grown men and their wives.
I always sort of had this sales thing in me, and at the same time, I was a 
designer. I was an illustrator. I was always drawing. I was very fascinated 
by the worlds of art and design. I had no idea what I was going to do 
with either of those things. I don’t even think I was thinking about what 
I would be doing. I had a high school teacher whose husband worked at 
Leo Burnett,1 and she said, “You should be an art director in an advertising 
agency. You’re very facile at this.” I didn’t even know what the word “facile” 
meant. And I said, “Okay. That sounds like a good idea.”
I learned a little bit about it. Somebody had gotten me some unwarranted 
interviews around town. I met some people from Leo Burnett and met some 
people from Ogilvy & Mather, and I decided, “Yeah. That’s what I want to do.” 
I started applying to art schools and universities, and that sort of became my 
identity ﬁx all the way through my education—my sort of upper-education 
career. And that’s kind of what I did.
The weird thing was I thought I was going to be an art director, and I was. 
My ﬁrst job was as an art director for Foote, Cone & Belding.2 I was actually 
hired as an art director, but it became obvious to me early on that—at the 
time—art directors really got sort of bogged down in the execution piece 
of things and were out of sync with their writers. I was an English minor, and 
I’d always liked to write. I thought I was pretty good at it. I taught myself to 
write better, and I switched from art direction to copywriting. About a year 
into it, I became a copywriter. So, anyway, that’s how that happened.
Tuten: How long had you been art directing when you realized that copy 
was more of your passion?

Ross: Maybe two years.
Tuten: And did that feel right once you did it?
Ross: Yeah, absolutely. The speed was right for me. I think I am a decent art 
director, but I am a much better writer. I was much more adventuresome 
with language for some reason than I was with design. And I don’t know why 
that is. I think it’s because it was faster and it helped me play more easily. 
Playfulness is a big part of this job. You have to be willing to put yourself in 
a place where you are having fun and it was easier for me to do that with 
language.
Tuten: How does that translate into your work now?
Ross: Well, the writing piece or just the beginning piece?
Tuten: That beginning shift from art and design to language.
Ross: I think that what it does, or what it did, was instill in me a tremendous 
amount of empathy for all kinds of craft in the space in which we operate. I 
completely empathize with the struggles of photographers and illustrators 
and designers and art directors, and at the same time, I think I understand 
what marketing directors have to do to synthesize their points of view and 
how to help them synthesize their points of view. I think that I understand 
or empathize with the idea of the creative process from a lot of different 
angles.
Tuten: What about the sales piece, that growing up and having the sales 
experience? Do you ﬁnd yourself selling now? 
Ross: I think that all successful marketing people are successful because 
they understand how to link desire with solution, and so I think I do that. 
Probably seventy percent of my work is ﬁguring out what that linkage is 
or articulating what that linkage is in a way that becomes really compel-
ling. Sometimes that’s helping writers and art directors or user experience 
people or developers turn that linkage into experiences. And sometimes it’s 
about helping an audience of marketing people recognize why the path we’re 
heading down is the right one.
Tuten: Kristen Cavallo at Mullen says sales is a major part of her job because 
you have to persuade someone to let you “run your idea with their money.”
Ross: I think that’s a very nice, succinct way of saying that the art of persua-
sion is to make sure that your idea is actually their need. That’s why I call it 
“linkage.” I think sales is about connecting. The art of persuasion is making 
that connection feel obvious, innate, and inarguable. If you’ve done a good

job of making their issue and your solution become indelibly connected, 
their response is, “Well, what else would I do?”
Tuten: Perfect. Would you describe that as the C-K philosophy?
Ross: No, I think C-K’s philosophy comes from a couple of other different 
things, but it does involve connection in a way. It’s just a deeper one. C-K’s 
philosophy is really simple, and it’s about the idea of value. We think that a 
relationship between a person and a brand, or a group and a brand, is far 
more valuable, far more worthy of investment than buzz, than click, than 
even transactions. And so our philosophy is about how do we get past those 
ﬁrst sort of shallow engagements, which could even mean a sale? How do 
we get past those shallow engagements into something that’s long lasting, 
into something that’s repetitive, into something that kind of brings joy to 
both groups?
And we have a little line that everyone here has to learn and learn what 
it means. It’s simply, “Make friends, not ads.” That’s what we try to get the 
organization to do: think not about this thing you’re about to create, but 
think, how do you help a brand and its publics become friends. We’ve been 
actually doing that long before Mark Zuckerberg took the word “friends” 
and did something with it—before he could probably shave. Anyway, that’s 
our philosophy, and we actually have an interesting organizational structure. 
We have no proﬁt centers between any of our disciplines. We don’t have any 
sort of wholly owned subsidiaries. We have T-shaped subject matter people3 
who can ﬂow all around the organization and work on anything they want as 
long as what they’re providing is relevant, without worrying about where the 
budget is going. So that’s our philosophy.
Tuten: Can you give me an example of how “make friends, not ads” has 
come into play for one of your clients?
Ross: Sure, I’ll just give one of our really recent examples, because it’s easier 
for me to think a few weeks ago than a few years ago. But if you look at the 
“Everyday Magic” campaign for the Porsche 911, it was about helping people 
who see a weekends-only sports car to see the 911 as a car they could 
drive every day. But what made it, I think, “friendship building” was that it 
was a campaign designed to help connect prospects with existing owners. 
The campaign let the owners tell their stories—how they used the Porsche 
911, what they think it does for them—directly to prospects. The campaign

a depth of expertise in a speciﬁc area.

created an intimacy that the brand was never able to achieve before with 
people who weren’t directly a part of the owner group. So that was a really 
cool thing. You can see the stories from owners at www.porscheeveryday.com.
Tuten: Okay. Great. I’ll take a look at that. Now, the second question, a 
follow-up to the philosophy question: you talked about how people can 
ﬂow, and as long as they’re adding value and what they’re doing is relevant, 
they don’t have to worry about where the budget is coming from. Is that 
something that’s made possible by Cramer-Krasselt being an independent 
agency?4
Ross: Yeah, absolutely. We are not required to write a check every year to 
London or New York or Paris. We’re New York. So we get to decide what 
our proﬁt goals are, what our efﬁciencies are. Obviously, we’re not in a vac­
uum. We benchmark on what’s smart and what’s appropriate. But, because 
we’re independent, we simply get to operate in ways of our own choosing. 
It’s unusual for a company of our scale to still be independent, and then even 
more so to run things without proﬁt centers.
Tuten: Are there challenges that go along with that?
Ross: Well, it’s very messy. It’s deﬁnitely very messy. That’s the biggest chal­
lenge, creating the right kind of connectivity all the time is messy. But the 
upside, more important than the challenges, the upside is that there’s zero 
internal competition. We used to have a saying in this business, and it was 
kind of BS: “ideas can come from anywhere.” That was sort of a code for 
“Well, everybody kind of has to be creative, and our creative departments 
are not egotistical, so ideas can come from anywhere.” But the truth is now 
ideas must come from everywhere, and that’s because the marketing land­
scape, the communications landscape, the media landscape—all of those 
“scapes” are so remarkably different, require so much coordination, that if 
you don’t have tennis players on all sides of the court, and the courts are 
now six-sided, if you don’t have somebody that can hit the ball back in every 
corner, you’re just not going to make it. Your thinking is just not going to 
work. So it’s a real imperative that this kind of play happens.
We found that if people don’t need purchase orders to work with each 
other, if people don’t need job numbers even to work with each other, col­
laboration becomes a lot easier.
4 The vast majority of advertising agencies are now held as subsidiaries of a holding 
company. The four major holding companies worldwide are WPP, Omnicom, Interpublic, 
and Publicis. Few agencies have retained their independence, operating as private entities. 
Some notable examples include Cramer-Krasselt, Wieden+Kennedy, and McKinney.

Tuten: Is time tracking different at C-K than it is at other agencies?
Ross: I think probably not. I think what’s different is that we don’t have 
gates between disciplines, that things can be more informal, and you don’t 
need department heads approving everything. People can seek each other 
out. People can agree independently. People can make the call independently. 
They can say, “Yeah, I think I can add value to that. It makes sense that myself 
or a number of people in my group be a part of this project.”
I remember when I was at a large holding-company agency [Foote, Cone, & 
Belding, part of the Interpublic Group] and recognized one of the motiva­
tions for starting my own agency. I literally just started to keep track on 
a piece of paper where my time was spent. I ﬁgured out I was spending 
something like seventy percent of my time negotiating internally for what I 
could show to a client versus working with clients and working on the craft 
of making things great. That statistic just sort of blew my mind. I said, “This 
is insane. We’re tougher. You know, we’re a bigger hurdle than the world is.” 
So that didn’t make any sense to me. I think if you did an interview of folks 
around C-K, they probably would not list as a complaint, “It’s too hard to 
get ideas in front of a client.” If they had complaints, they wouldn’t list that 
among their complaints. They might have others, but they wouldn’t list that.
Tuten: Now, you mentioned your own agency, the shop that you created 
with your partners. How did that come about?
Ross: It was a combination of a couple of things. All of us had some sort of 
sense of missed opportunity at the places we were at. We all felt like, you 
know, “If we were doing this in our own way, it would be a lot of fun.” I wish 
I could say it was headier than that, but it really wasn’t. At the same time, we 
had compelling reasons to make Chicago our home. At the time, there really 
weren’t a lot of interesting agencies to go to in the city of Chicago that 
would have been dramatically different from where we were.
In my case, I had a family. My wife was doing well, very well, in her [career], 
and her work was Chicago-based, and I didn’t think it was fair to ask her to 
come to New York or some other place for me to seek something out. We 
have family here. And, you know, Chicago’s a great city. So my partners and I 
thought, “Let’s just try it.” We had been kind of doing it anyway. We had this 
little company called After Hours Advertising. We never spent any of the 
money we made. We just kind of chucked it in the bank. We said, “Well, one 
day we’ll either go for a trip around the world with our wives, or we’ll just 
start an ad agency.” So we did the stupid thing, and we started an ad agency.
Tuten: What was that like compared to what it’s like to be with a big shop, 
like C-K?

Advertisers at Work
79
Ross: At the start of the agency, we didn’t know anything about anything, 
which was kind of amazing. The only thing we knew how to do was what 
was very speciﬁc to our jobs, and we quickly learned in the ﬁrst two weeks 
that there were a lot of other jobs that got done that we didn’t even know 
about. I mean, we literally didn’t understand the manufacturing process at the 
time, which was pre-Macintosh. So we didn’t know how to get an idea into 
the newspaper. “What? Like, how do you do that?” So, you know, we had to 
use our network of people at other places, made lots of horrible mistakes—
some hilarious now, you know, [that made us] absolutely panic-stricken at 
the time, but hilarious now.
And so I think the biggest thing was just the heft of the work. We literally 
had two shifts, but it was the same people pulling both shifts. One of my 
partners and I lived downtown near each other, and we would just walk 
home at midnight, literally six days a week. So that was really different. I think 
that’s still the big difference between now being with C-K and Mitchiner, 
Ross & Kahn: one, the scale, and, two, the pitchability of C-K. You know, that 
was the biggest problem at Mitchiner, Ross & Kahn. We did quite well, and 
we grew pretty quickly and lasted past the danger zone. We lasted for more 
than seven years. But you still ran into walls where a client of a certain scale 
would say, “You know what? You guys just can’t handle what we need.” I think 
today it’s a very different environment.
Organizations of all sizes are able to have their at-bat with clients of all sizes, 
but at that time, which was the mid-nineties, it was different. And so I really 
welcomed the scale of C-K, the pitchability of C-K. The one thing I miss 
about our tiny place was that it was really ﬂexible. C-K’s pretty ﬂexible, but 
Mitchiner, Ross & Kahn was really ﬂexible. C-K is one hundred and ten years 
old. There’s sort of a big historical obligation that’s on the current watch. You 
don’t want to be the management team that screws this up. We didn’t have 
that at Mitchiner, Ross & Kahn. We were like, “whatever.”
Tuten: So that agency was bought out. Is that right?
Ross: Yes, by Campbell Mithun Esty, which now I think is called Campbell 
Mithun.
Tuten: Did you stay put or did you leave when the merger occurred?
Ross: We were bought and absorbed into Campbell Mithun. Several of us 
moved right over to Campbell Mithun and took leadership jobs there. I 
stayed for a number of years until that agency was sold. I didn’t really like 
the idea of what was going to become of that. Peter Krivkovitch [Cramer-
Krasselt’s CEO and president] and I had spoken over the years many times

about me joining Cramer-Krasselt. I gave him a call, and I said, “Well, I think 
ﬁnally I can say, ‘This makes a lot of sense.’” And that was that.
Tuten: And you’ve been there ever since?
Ross: Yeah, like sixteen years, which is a long time in advertising.
Tuten: It is a long time. Do you think that that’s it for now? You’re going to 
stay put?
Ross: I think I have a really important goal still left, you know, a big aspira­
tion still left ahead of me here. My singular goal is to get C-K to what I call 
a “sustaining benchmark status.” I think, for me and a lot of people here, it’s 
important we sort of hit a place where we are a constant benchmark. There 
are a few agencies that I think have achieved that, and I admire them a lot. 
That’s the goal—to get us to that point.
Tuten: Can you share which agencies you believe have hit that level of hav­
ing a sustainable industry benchmark status?
Ross: For me, the agency that most models “the dream” is Goodby, 
Silverstein & Partners.5 Probably Wieden+Kennedy, too. Those two, for the 
last twenty-ﬁve years, really have always been a place to look to and learn 
from. It’s really the consistency of the reference point that I think is so 
amazing. It’s one thing to do it for a couple of years. It’s one thing to knock 
it out of the park in a way that makes everyone’s head turn once or twice, 
but to just consistently do it, to build a culture and value system that makes 
that happen over and over and over again. To me, that’s the goal: how do you 
build a self-repeating culture?
Tuten: What kinds of things are you doing to achieve that at C-K?
Ross: We’re doing all kinds of things to try and do that. We’re trying to hire 
people who are believers, who are willing to stay. I think that’s a big part of 
it. We’re trying to stretch the deﬁnition of talent. We’re trying to leverage 
our independence in ways that make the culture feel unique and make the 
culture feel precious and something that people want to defend, something 
that people want to go to bat for. We’re looking for ways to give people free­
doms and challenges that they haven’t had. We bring outside inﬂuences in a 
lot more than we used to.

We now have a huge program called “Right Brain,” which brings speakers, 
musicians, artists, programmers, mad scientists into the company culture 
on a monthly basis. We ask people within the company to research things 
and bring them to the rest of us and have their own forum to do it without 
somebody approving what they do. So, those kinds of things.
Tuten: Do you think those types of actions are part of what’s led Ad Age to 
name C-K one of the “agencies to watch for” the last three years in a row?
Ross: Well, I hope so. It’s hard to say. I think that like all sort of culture-
based businesses, it is so much about who’s winning and who’s not winning. 
So I think a large part of the Ad Age measurement is about business success. 
I think a second, big part is, how good is the work? I think that our work has 
managed to be pretty good. To me, it’s really not at that place yet that I think 
gets us to benchmark. So, I love that Ad Age has done that and I’m grateful 
for it, but it’s not really satisfying for me until the product is really able to be 
a reference point over and over again.
Tuten: Is your goal one that is shared by the rest of the leadership team?
Ross: Yes. I think it is. I think we probably have different ways of expressing 
it, but I think the idea of success—success with continuity, success on a large 
public level—is very much shared. And I know we all believe that they key to 
that is how interesting the work product is, whether that work product be 
media innovation, planning innovation, or creative innovation—that’s what 
drives this business and is the ﬁrst step to helping brands create friends.
Tuten: What’s a typical day like for you?
Ross: Breathless. And it’s kind of nutty. It’s booked solid, and it has a lot of 
travel—a lot of travel.
Tuten: What kinds of travel? To meet with clients? Prospecting? 
Presentations like at ad:tech?6 Everything?
Ross: All three of those things. Last week I started in Chicago, I went to 
Nashville, I went to Atlanta, I went to Frankfurt, I went to Stuttgart, and back 
again by Saturday. And then I leave again tomorrow for Los Angeles. And 
that’s kind of typical.
Tuten: Now, if you’re traveling that much and you’re doing the important 
work as part of the leadership team, how much time do you get to spend 
really with the creative, with the work?
6 ad:tech is an industry trade show and forum. Ross presented in my session at ad:tech 
New York 2010.

Ross: Not enough. And that’s kind of—I guess that’s what’s expected. This 
goes back to that goal that I spoke about earlier. I would personally like to 
spend more time with the creative work, but I’m not sure that helps [us 
reach] the goal. I think the challenge for me, and for everybody on the lead­
ership team, is to ﬁgure out how can the values that I might represent be 
present in rooms where I am not.
Tuten: Right.
Ross: My challenge is to ﬁgure out who the people are who can lead those 
moments and lead them well enough that I can do these other things. As 
much as I miss those moments, there are other things that have to be done. 
From my point of view, the job of chief creative ofﬁcer has to be about goal 
setting and values driving, not ad tweaking. If I’m ad tweaking on a big scale 
or across the network, that’s kind of a worrisome thing. And it’s also impos­
sible, really, to do that well. It’s impossible because it’s impractical.
We have ofﬁces across the country and clients across the country, and 
there’s a lot of work. To bottleneck the work through me would be kind 
of egomaniacal, and I don’t think it could work very well. And I think it’d 
be demoralizing. So I believe that if you have creative leaders in New York, 
in our other ofﬁces, even within groups in the Chicago ofﬁce, they have 
to be able to take the ball to a certain point. The executive creative direc­
tors of the individual ofﬁces have to be able to take the ball all the way. 
They shouldn’t need me. Ideally, they’d want me for certain things, but they 
shouldn’t be requiring it.
Tuten: Do you ever have a brief come in where you say, “I just have to work 
on this project.”
Ross: Sometimes. And, again, because of how I delegate it, I don’t see all the 
briefs, but there are a couple of businesses I do stay tied with. A lot of new 
business is when I get a chance to do work either by, again, sort of setting 
the approach we might take and then creating an example of what that 
might look, sound, or feel like. New business is where I get to do that the 
most. And sometimes with Porsche, which is a personal passion.
Tuten: Can you give me an example of something you’ve worked on 
recently?
Ross: Well, I’m really happy to say that for Porsche’s model year 2013, 
I wrote a lot of that work. Actually, I’m a little unhappy because I say that and 
yet I can’t tell you what the work is because you’re not even supposed to 
know what our cars are for the model year ’13. But that’s very recent. That’s 
why I was in Germany last week, sharing that with our counterparts there.

Tuten: You enjoyed it?
Ross: Yeah, it was great. I mean, it was challenging to be in the role of copy­
writer again, from a logistics viewpoint. I had to go in on the weekends, but it 
was really fun to just write and think about ideas.
Tuten: And is that one where other people came to you and said, “We need 
you on this one?” Or is that one that you said, “I have to work on this.”
Ross: No, I think logistics created a hole. There were some people that 
were out on production and some deadlines that sort of overlapped. It was 
the luck—in this case the good luck, the conﬂuence—where, really the only 
thing I could say without ruining other people’s lives was, “Okay, I’ll do it.”
Tuten: And what did it feel like?
Ross: It was great. It was scary for the ﬁrst couple of hours, but then it was 
great. It was a lot of fun. More fun than my usual days.
Tuten: Scary in the “I don’t know if I can do this anymore” kind of way?
Ross: It’s like anything else. If you don’t play tennis for a while, the ﬁrst time 
you ﬁnd yourself on the court, you kind of suck, right?
Tuten: Right.
Ross: So it was that. I wrote a bunch of stuff, and I was like, “God! I’m going 
to ﬁre this person.” And then, then ﬁnally, I remembered that that’s normal. 
And then it got fun. And then when it gets fun, it gets good.
Tuten: And then who served as your creative director?
Ross: It’s funny because I asked a larger team to review the work. And I 
think they were pretty honest, and so I kind of reverse creative-directed. I 
said, “Okay, guys, now you’re the creative directors. What sucks and what’s 
really great?” And it worked. I think it did. We’re really happy with the work.
Tuten: That’s fantastic. What a great story. Say you have a magic wand and 
you can change with this magic wand one thing about advertising. What do 
you change?
Ross: Ooh, that’s a good question. What’s the one thing I’d change about 
advertising? I think I’d wish that the really horrible work wouldn’t be 
successful. There’s a lot of really bad stuff that you’re exposed to that I 
consider to be visual and noise pollution. And a lot of it arcs [i.e., causes 
sales to increase in response to the advertising]. It makes me crazy. A lot 
of it sells a lot of stuff, and I just wish it wouldn’t. And that would be how 
I would use that magic wand. I would say, “Okay, from now on, if it’s really 

Chapter 6 |  Marshall Ross: Chief Creative Ofﬁcer, Cramer-Krasselt
84
offensive and crass, it doesn’t get to be successful. You can’t even buy your 
way to success if that’s the way you’re going to market.” That’s what I would 
change.
Tuten: It’s funny to me that you mention that, because that’s one of the 
things that we always end up discussing in my advertising classes when it 
comes to creative. Is the objective to meet the marketing goals of the client, 
or is the objective to create really good work? Sometimes the answer is not 
the same for those two things.
Ross: Well, right. I think the challenge with how open-minded the market­
place is in terms of accepting, responding to work that’s just horriﬁc and 
work that’s really great, is that it allows marketing directors to be right­
fully conﬂicted about what’s the right path for them. From their perspec­
tive, their jobs are on the line with the success or failure of their products 
and services. Unless they work for companies like Apple that are driven 
by the aesthetic and driven by a design point of view, they’re up against it. 
If somebody brings them a formula with a box full of rocks and that for­
mula works, it’s going to be hard to get them off it with work that’s more 
insightful, with work that’s more human, with work that’s more endearing, 
with work that’s more memorable. Because the junk actually succeeds. It’s 
very challenging.
Tuten: Are you in that situation with clients?
Ross: I think everybody in my job is in that situation with clients. I think it’s 
a fair situation to be in. Our clients have, appropriately, a different lens with 
which they view the world. And like I said, the ﬁrst topic we spoke about, if 
you can’t link what you’re trying to do with what they must do, you’re not 
going to get to yes.
Tuten: When you look around the industry now, what’s most surprising to you?
Ross: I think the biggest surprise—well, maybe it wasn’t a surprise. We saw 
it coming, but everybody just sort of said, “Holy cow. That looks like what’s 
going to happen,” and then it happened. It’s happened in all kinds of different 
industries. The surprise is how people who had nothing to do with advertis­
ing came to control the world of advertising. Did you know that Google is 
the world’s largest ad agency? But Google doesn’t care about advertising. 
These guys were out to invent a way to share information. Their mission 
is to bring information to people in a really usable way. It just so happens 
that their way of sustaining that mission is through ad sales. They’ve become 
probably the most powerful force in advertising. I think that’s mind-boggling. 
On the one hand, it’s kind of amazing and cool. On the other hand, it’s like, 
“How did we let that happen?”

A lot of the issues that we seem to have with the industry come from the 
outsiders—complete outsiders. Look at the music industry. Steve Jobs came 
in and completely transformed the music industry [with the introduction 
of the iPod and iTunes]. All these music industry people, many of whom got 
into the business because they love music and they worship the artists that 
create it, suddenly found themselves not in command of the industry they 
created. That’s what has happened to the advertising industry.
Tuten: So what do you think will be happening next in the advertising 
industry?
Ross: I think that change, among others, will probably spark a whole domino 
effect of new models for what the ad business is. I think that in ﬁve years 
from now, there will be a few pillars of constancy, but a lot of the land-
scape is going to look incredibly different. It’s going to be way more entre-
preneurial. It’s going to be absolutely more technologically fueled. It will 
be analytics-fueled, and somehow creativity will still end up being a huge 
differentiator. But the deﬁnition of creative is going to be real different.
Tuten: In what way?
Ross: Well, I think the palettes—the canvas and paints—are just going to 
be different. It wasn’t that long ago when agencies were measured by the 
brilliance of their ﬁlm. And now, already, it’s become—in, I think, a positive 
way—the brilliance of their engagement props, or how well they’re able to 
elicit participation and activate that participation into real results for cli-
ents. That’s changing the kinds of ideas that people create. And people that 
started in this business, interested in design and interested in words or 
interested in marketing are still interested in and motivated by these things. 
But they’re deploying them in ways there’s no way they would have imagined 
three or four years ago. That’s really cool.
Tuten: When we teach advertising, we’re still teaching people who want to 
go into the creative side to be art directors and copywriters.
Ross: As long as it’s writing and art directing through the lens of how things 
work today, that still makes sense. I think there’s a place—there has to be a 
place for the artist. I mean, you look at gaming, and you say, “Gaming? That’s 
a technology ﬁeld, a software ﬁeld.” It is, but it’s movies. It’s just movies that 
wait for you to determine their outcomes. There is still great writing, and 
there is still amazing art direction. So I think that those mindsets and those 
skill sets are still going to be in huge demand.
What’s going to be different is, again, how they’re deployed. We’re going to 
have to understand that the paint comes out of the tube in a different way 
now. That’s a huge challenge for people who are currently in the business,

who’ve been in the business for a while, and even for the next generation, 
because they’re still inspired by the past. That’s what got them interested. 
The truth is, the past is not all that relevant anymore.
Tuten: What should we be doing in the classroom differently, do you think?
Ross: Well, I think that we still talk about the business and teach about the 
business in a two-dimensional way. We talk about ideas as marriages between 
images and language. There’s a whole new dimension that I like to call “acti­
vation.” The big idea is the cliché in the business—the goal is to develop a 
big, breakthrough advertising idea. I think that’s over. We need to be looking 
for big, breakthrough activation ideas. It’s about mobilization. I don’t mean 
literally a mobile phone, although that’s certainly part of it. It’s mobilization 
of people behind actions. And that’s very different than thinking about the 
world of perceptions and imaging. Now you have to do all of that at the 
same time. You have to create aesthetics in a world that galvanizes, mobilizes, 
and motivate people to actually do things earlier, more often, and in more 
ways than ever before. And so the role of art and the role of language have 
totally new jobs before them. And creative people, whether they wear a suit 
or wear jeans or whether they use a calculator or Adobe Creative Suite, 
have to look at what they’re creating in a very different way.
Tuten: You’ve talked to me a lot in the last several minutes about changes 
in the ad industry and changes that have happened and what’s coming. Mad 
Men is an incredibly popular drama now, and that reinforces a lot of stereo­
types about the ad industry. Are any of those still true?
Ross: Well, obviously, Mad Men is ﬁction on a lot of fronts. I think that’s 
what makes advertising a constant stage throughout the generations of tele­
vision—you know, it started with the movies, right, with North by Northwest. 
And then TV picked up on it with Bewitched. Darren Stevens [of Bewitched] 
was in the ad business. And when I was in college, there was Thirtysomething. 
There’s always been that stage for the industry because the one constant, 
the one truth, is the way ego shapes this business. That’s still true. I think 
that, like Hollywood, advertising is a magnet for people with grand visions, 
egos bigger than they should be, who sometimes through amazing skill and 
brilliance, and sometimes [through] sheer luck, get the chance to exercise 
their egotistical point of view. And so that part’s true.

Edward Boches is chief innovation ofﬁcer at Mullen (www.mullen.com), an 
independent full-service agency within the Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG). 
Mullen integrates disciplines from creative to digital marketing, public relations and 
social inﬂuence, media planning and buying, mobile marketing, direct response, and 
performance analytics. Mullen specializes in what it calls an “unbound” approach 
to marketing, a term that Boches pays homage to with the name of his blog, 
Creativity Unbound. Boches has been with Mullen since its early days, working in 
the creative department, ultimately as chief creative ofﬁcer. Mullen clearly provided 
Boches room to soar as it ranks among Advertising Age’s Agency A-List and Fast 
Company’s Most Innovative Companies.
Boches created the role of chief social media ofﬁcer and later, chief innovation 
ofﬁcer, as he sought to inspire change and encourage people in the agency and 
industry to embrace new technologies, platforms, and consumer behaviors neces­
sary to create cool and relevant ideas for clients. He proudly says, “Somehow I’ve 
survived for 30 years in a business that typically eats its young.” In this interview, 
he shares a rare glimpse into the story of Mullen in its early days and a look at 
where, having learned many lessons from the advertising industry, his life is headed.
Tracy Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in this ﬁeld?
Edward Boches: I grew up wanting to be in the media in one way or 
another. Even at an incredibly young age, like seventh grade maybe. I loved the

printed page, newspapers, magazines, and everything about it. I was a bit of 
a news junkie, even back then. I also was interested in ﬁlm, starting probably 
about early high school. By high school, I decided, well, I want to be either 
Walter Cronkite or Orson Welles or somebody who is making something 
out of the media to perform, persuade, inﬂuence, and entertain other people.
I liked the idea of being a creator of popular culture and ideas that mattered. 
I started college as a journalism major. I went back and forth between ﬁlm 
and journalism. I actually thought I wasn’t a good enough writer to be a great 
journalist, which may have been a premature conclusion, and then I also 
thought the idea of becoming a famous Hollywood director seemed slightly 
elusive, and I ended up majoring in a hybrid: public communication.
My ﬁrst job was as a newspaper reporter for a weekly newspaper. I then 
went into PR, later became a corporate speechwriter, and then I ended up 
in advertising. It was sort of circuitous route, but it still seemed to be con­
nected and related to my ﬁrst love, which was [working] with the printed 
page and creating ideas and content where nothing existed before.
Tuten: I think you must have been an unusual high school student to already 
know—as others have reported—who Bill Bernbach1 was.
Boches: Well, I knew the work, anyway, from all those great ads appearing 
in LIFE and LOOK magazines. I probably had seen pictures of him at the ad 
agency. I was certainly familiar with VW and Avis and Alka-Seltzer ads. I just 
seemed acutely aware of all of that stuff.
And what’s also interesting is the ﬁrst serious ﬁlm I ever saw. I saw Citizen 
Kane when I was maybe . . . ﬁfteen years old.
The whole concept of the auteur in cinema really intrigued me as well. At 
that time, I was making Super 8 movies. When I was in high school, I had a 
Super 8 camera, and I had the Moviola,2 and I had editing slicing systems. In 
those days, you had to do everything with glue and cement and wait for the 
ﬁlm to come back. I made political ﬁlms that were either protesting against 
companies that polluted, or oppressive school systems, or whatever.
I guess I was a little radical, too, although I didn’t think that at the time. 
I founded a newspaper in high school, a student-run newspaper called The 
Mad Hatter. It got me thrown out of school. I think I was only a junior in 
1 Bill Bernbach was a creative director and one of the founding members of Doyle Dane 
Bernbach (DDB). He is credited with being the ﬁrst to team copywriters and art direc­
tors into two-person teams.

high school—I know I didn’t have my driver’s license yet—and I got featured 
on some Boston news station for being one of the more active high school 
radicals at the time. So all of that sort of went together: being political, 
subversive, creating content, writing, expressing yourself. Advertising in some 
ways was the easy way out because it was fun. It was ﬁlled with instant 
gratiﬁcation. You could be clever and irreverent even though you were selling 
stuff [to] people. It was a more attainable career than, say, being a ﬁlmmaker.
Tuten: All of those characteristics that you just named seem like they are 
still very relevant for you today.
Boches: In some ways, yes. I once said to somebody that social media was 
invented just for me because it sort of combined all of my interests. 
I actually got really bored with traditional advertising if you will—with things 
like print or outdoor or television. I got bored with just delivering other 
people’s messages to other people’s audiences with other people’s money. 
It sort of lost some of its appeal over time. I’ve been doing this a long time. 
Now I don’t quite have that passion for making “an ad” that I may have had 
when I was younger. I still have the passion for media and connecting people 
and generating ideas and ﬁnding new ways to inﬂuence. But the original 
thing that got me really excited was, “Oh, I can come up with an idea and 
put it on that blank piece of paper, that two-dimensional plan, and have it be 
something magical.” After doing that for a number of years, it wasn’t quite as 
exciting anymore.
Tuten: Is that what led you to the role of chief innovation ofﬁcer?
Boches: Yes. I guess basically what happened was two things. It became 
apparent to me that all the changes that were going on were going to 
dramatically affect our business. We frankly had failed a couple of times to 
really evolve as quickly as we needed to in the digital social space. Part of 
that reason was because we always brought somebody in from the outside. 
We did that because he supposedly was or allegedly was an expert in digital 
or interactive. Those people never could quite ﬁt into our culture or make 
change from the inside.
One day I just said, “Maybe I’ll do that job. Maybe I’ll be the person who 
tries.” I don’t know a whole lot about digital. I didn’t know anything about 
social at the time. This was maybe three years ago. But I said, “I know an 
awful lot about our company, our clients, and our standards, and maybe I’ll 
go and learn that other kind of stuff and try to become an evangelist for 
it.” What happened was I actually got into it! I got into every aspect of it— 
Twitter, and blogging, and fast-generated content, and the power of conduct­
ing research via the Web, and so on.

Chapter 7 |  Edward Boches: Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, Mullen

I’m more interested in that and I started to ﬁnd ways in which I could get 
clients excited about it. As that happened, I said, “Shoot. Maybe we should get 
somebody else to pay attention to ‘the advertising part of things.’” I ended up 
hiring my replacement, who is probably a better creative director than I was.
At that point, I started really pursuing all of the new platforms and digital 
technologies. I’ve deﬁned my job as I’ve gone along from being someone who 
actually made advertising to somebody who tries to inspire people to try 
to embrace new ways of thinking to the creation of more modern forms of 
advertising. The simple way to look at it was this: for a long time, we made 
ideas out of words, pictures, and stories. And now ideas are also made out 
of technology and applications and utility. Trying to get a company to think in 
those terms has been interesting and fun. It’s fun to try to make that trans­
formation happen.
Tuten: How much of your effort is spent on work that is Mullen’s develop­
ment in a speciﬁc area versus how much is spent on speciﬁc client work?
Boches: I don’t do that much direct client work anymore. I run an internal 
innovation lab that tries to experiment and be a catalyst for new ideas. I 
write and speak about trends as a public face for the agency and its innova­
tive thinking. I generate an awful lot of content that we use in new business 
that helps show clients and prospects new ways of looking at things.
And I spend time trying to generate things for Mullen. They range from 
a crowdsourced Gen Y blog that I incubated, called “The Next Great 
Generation.” It really runs completely and totally autonomously and has 
recently become the Gen Y content provider to The Boston Globe. I work 
on smaller things like playing with new platforms, social digital participation, 
and that sort of thing. We just launched something with boston.com called 
“The Pulse.” It combines content from The Globe, content from blogs, social 
media, data, and analytics, Twitter participation, geo-based access to content, 
etc. It sort of takes the user, the reader, the professional content, data, and a 
branded advertising platform and puts them together in a new kind of media 
content.
I think it’s important to be playing around with those kinds of things for a 
couple of reasons. One is they could become new sources of revenue over 
time. They could set examples or be experimental laboratories for the cre­
ation of new things for clients that make a statement about the agency being 
progressive in its thinking. These activities help raise awareness, which helps 
with the recruitment of both clients and employees. So it’s a new sort of 
unchartered territory that a number of agencies are paying attention to—
like Wieden+Kennedy3 with its incubator, or BBH Labs.4 It’s about agencies 

Advertisers at Work
91
inventing their own brands and products. I don’t know if anybody knows 
where this is going to go, but I think there’s a sense that it could be impor­
tant and we should be playing in those spaces.
Tuten: How big is your team there, the innovation team working with you 
at Mullen?
Boches: There are really only a couple of us. It’s me and percentages of 
other people. I tap into existing developers, technology people, project 
managers, mobile people, media people, and a few Gen Y content generators. 
Almost all of them have other roles and responsibilities. One of the reasons 
for doing it that way is to make the lab somewhat virtual. You’re more likely 
to spread the thinking and the practices and the technologies into other 
areas of the company rather than keep it off to the side as a completely 
contained department.
Tuten: You’re not a silo. You’re integrated.
Boches: Some silo and some integrated. If you’re doing things for the 
agency and not the clients, those things by deﬁnition are siloed. If you’re 
doing things with people who work on client business, they’re bringing that 
information, that thinking, that inspiration back into the rest of the agency, 
and it will inevitably affect the client one way or another.
Tuten: What’s a typical day like—if there is one?
Boches: A typical day is a combination of staying connected with people 
outside the agency via social platforms. I think another important part is 
bringing ideas and content in from the outside. I generate a ton of content. 
That’s the second part of my day. Blogging, speaking, writing, appearances, 
and generating content for those things takes up a fair amount of time. Let’s 
say it’s a ﬁfth of the time that I might be actually working on projects for the 
agency. Some of the things that I refer to that we might be trying to create 
or invent. The rest of the time might just be ad hoc. I’m dragged into meet­
ings, or I’m asked to consult or counsel on something, or to meet with a

Tuten: You are one of the founding partners of Mullen. What was that expe­
rience like?
Boches: Mullen was founded by one guy, Jim Mullen, but three additional 
people became partners in the very early days. It was actually awesome. 
Joe Grimaldi, who’s CEO, came here before me. I joined a few months later. 
At that time, the agency was already eight or nine years old and had about 
twelve or thirteen employees. Joe and I became partners along with Paul 
Silverman, my predecessor as chief creative ofﬁcer.
We basically built this agency from nothing. We were in a house on the 
North Shore in the middle of nowhere. We were thirty miles from Boston 
and a million miles from Madison Avenue. We were smart and we balanced 
each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We sort of knew what we were 
doing, but not really. But it was a lot of fun because we had the challenge of 
building something. We were doing it for ourselves. We were experimenting 
as we went along. We could decide what we wanted to be and then how to 
be it. Anyone who’s ever worked in a start-up company when it was small 
and you were struggling and you were trying to turn it into something would 
say that was the most fun. The journey to get big was more fun than being big.
We successfully created a culture that was inherently entrepreneurial, 
that embraced change on an ongoing basis, and that was rooted ﬁrst and 
foremost in creativity. Those qualities served us well as the world changed 
around us.
Tuten: Do you miss that now?
Boches: We try to create that to a degree whenever we can in pockets of 
the company, or on certain projects, or on certain pieces of business. But 
I do miss it. I do. There are beneﬁts to being large, having more resources, 
being surrounded by professional, talented people who are good at speciﬁc 
things. In those days we had to ﬁgure out everything for ourselves from 
the most basic stuff like traveling and faxing, to how you did new business 
pitches to how you prospected for new clients to how you produced a TV 
commercial. Anything we were doing for the very ﬁrst time. But at the same 
time, it was closer to rock and roll, like being in a band that nobody ever 
heard of and taking the show on the road, hoping to ﬁnd an audience.
Tuten: Like you have a dream and you just work every day a bit towards 
the dream.
Boches: It was also at a time when there was nothing—there was no tech­
nology. We didn’t have computers. We didn’t have web, e-mail, internet. We

had IBM Selectric typewriters and landlines. I can’t even imagine that now. It 
seems like it would be so much easier today because you don’t even need 
ofﬁce space. You need a cell phone and an internet connection and people 
can work from wherever they are. You can set up a company. Back then you 
needed an ofﬁce because you had to congregate someplace. You needed 
Xerox machines, you needed a little bit more capital expense than you need 
today. It should be a hell of a lot easier to do it today than it was then.
Tuten: That sounds like it was an amazing experience.
Boches: It was. It was great. I hadn’t really thought about it for a long time, 
but as you ask these questions, I’m starting to get ﬂashbacks.
Tuten: Anything speciﬁc? A special story you want to tell us?
Boches: Oh, there are some great stories. Oh God, I could tell you a story 
that was amazing. We had the biggest pitch of our lives. There were fourteen 
of us in the company. This must have been twenty-nine years ago, so this 
would have been 1982, ’83. We were going up against the biggest agency in 
Boston, which at the time was HBM [Humphrey Browning MacDougall], and 
against J. Walter Thompson in New York. It was for Apollo Computer, which 
was a very, very hot workstation company that was on its way to being a 
Fortune 1000, if not a Fortune 500, company.
Joe and I were basically doing the whole pitch. He was running the deck 
and the presentation, and I was doing all the creative with my partner. We 
had a pretty cool campaign. We were writing every single word of copy to 
try to be as perfect as we could be. We knew that we had a great way to 
position these network workstations visually and verbally and with a level of 
conﬁdence that rivaled BMW advertising. We were the dark horse, for sure. 
The local ad trade publications at that time, like Ad Week New England, said it 
was a joke that we were even in this pitch with these big agencies.
The night before the pitch, Joe gets a call that his mother had died. She was 
in Florida and she’d passed away. It wasn’t expected. I think she had a heart 
attack or stroke and died. This is maybe six or seven o’clock at night a day 
and a half before the pitch. All I remember is Joe stayed up and worked 
through the night. We worked from seven p.m. straight through the next 
morning till dawn. We ﬁnished the presentation. We ﬁnished the deck. I 
ﬁnished the copy, and then he had to leave to ﬂy to Florida. And he was the 
senior guy. We had to go and do the presentation without him. It was just 
one of these crazy, intense, dramatic things. We did the pitch, and we blew 
them away, and we won! It was a big local and national advertising story. 
“Who the hell are these guys in Beverly Farms in the middle of nowhere

that no one had ever heard of?” We had just beat the biggest agency in 
Boston, and a giant New York agency. It was empowering.
Here’s another. It was ’87 maybe. We were in this magniﬁcent building. We 
had renovated William Randolph Hearst’s private estate into an impressive 
ofﬁce space in Pride’s Crossing atop a hill with a view of Boston and the 
tip of Cape Cod out over the ocean. I was in New York getting ready to do 
a new business pitch. I get a call that morning from Joe telling me that the 
agency had burned to the ground, just totally burned to the ground. Nothing 
was left. First I thought—it was April 2 and I had my dates confused—I 
thought it was April 1, and I thought the entire thing was a joke. It turns out 
it wasn’t a joke. There had been a small ﬁre that had started inside the build­
ing. There was a volunteer ﬁre department in that town. A couple of mishaps 
happened, and the next thing there are some explosions inside that building 
and the building burned to the ground. So we lost everything—every ﬁle, 
every computer, every desk, every piece of furniture, every document, every 
deck, every piece of paper, everything—there was literally nothing left. Not 
a pencil, not an eraser, not a paper clip—nothing. But, you know what? We 
were up and running as an agency the next day because people didn’t ask 
any permission from anybody—ever. They just did what they needed to do.
The three of us in New York ﬁnished our pitch and ﬂew home. Somebody 
else went out and bought new equipment. Somebody else did this or did 
that. We returned to the little building that we had been in prior to renovat­
ing the estate, now with three times as many people. We put four people 
into an ofﬁce. We were crammed on top of each other. We still went to 
work the next day. At the end of that year, we had lost no business, we lost 
no clients, we missed no deadlines.
In fact, I think we grew twenty-ﬁve percent. At the time, we probably had, 
say, maybe forty employees—my numbers could be off a little bit. What was 
interesting is we had a culture of “collective entrepreneurialism.” It was a 
term that I coined years ago—collective entrepreneurialism, which was the 
idea of “we’re in this together, but we’re behaving as a unit of entrepreneurs.” 
That kind of stuff was challenging and trying, but man, it was joyful at the 
same time. That aspect of our culture still permeates the place today despite 
that there’s probably only—out of six hundred people—there’s probably 
only four or ﬁve of us who were here when that happened.
Tuten: Do you tell these stories to your current employees so they can 
have that sense of culture?

Advertisers at Work
95
Boches: Not really. It’s kind of the classic story of mom and dad telling you 
they used to walk uphill both ways to and from school. I think it’s in the lore, 
but the ﬁre is actually one story that I don’t think we make a big deal of.
Tuten: How do you keep the collective entrepreneurship alive?
Boches: That is a combination of things, I think. First of all, we’re big believ-
ers in rights and responsibilities, so we actually give people more rights and 
decision-making authority than they might get at the same age or with the 
same title in a lot of companies, as long as they’re willing to embrace the 
responsibility that goes with it. That’s one thing.
I think a second piece of it is it’s almost just inherently in the DNA of the 
company. It’s one of those things where you couldn’t get rid of it even if you 
tried.
The third thing is, as a result, it attracts a certain kind of people. We never, 
ever attract people who want to be tenders or who want to maintain the 
status quo. We tend to do a really good job attracting people who want 
to take over, who want to build things, who want to make stuff, who want 
to assume that level of responsibility. That kind of person perpetuates the 
culture. I think we would make an argument that one of the most valuable 
assets that any company has is that [type of] culture.
I was looking at growth charts with my partner a week or so ago. It’s 
signiﬁcant. We’ve gone from a $2 million agency [income] to a $110 million 
agency, whatever the numbers are. If you look at any time we’ve had a down 
year, we may have lost clients. One year we lost BMW and Timberland in 
the same year. Another year we lost Nextel, which was our biggest client by 
two or three times, so that year was obviously a dip in our income than our 
previous year. But if you look at the company, we have never, ever had two 
bad years in a row. In the three or four times in the history of the company 
we’ve had a down year, the next year was an up year that brought us back to 
close to where we had been previously. That’s a cultural thing that permeates 
how we work and what we believe we can do. We call on that without even 
realizing it.
Tuten: How do you see Mullen changing in the future?
Boches: It’s interesting because there’s a big debate going on. It’s been going 
on for a year or two now. Are we in the middle of an incredible transforma-
tion when it comes to advertising, which includes branding, yes or no? More 
people seem to think yes than no.
There’s a question as to whether traditional media will become less impor-
tant in the future than it’s been in the past. Most people will say yes, but

Chapter 7 |  Edward Boches: Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, Mullen
96
when you look at the actual numbers in terms of where dollars are spent, 
there’s a tremendous amount still spent on traditional media and no real sign 
of it diminishing.
Then the third question that comes up in this debate is where is the indus­
try going. Will clients of the future be more inclined to want integrated 
agencies that do everything well? Or will they want best of breed, specialist 
agencies that do social or digital or something else?
We may be at odds with the majority of people who think the specialists are 
still the way to go. But we believe that you can’t be best of breed if you’re 
not completely, totally integrated and you don’t have convergence because 
everything is interdependent. How do you have traditional advertising that 
doesn’t have social media, that doesn’t have digital, that doesn’t have plat­
forms, that doesn’t have apps, that doesn’t have mobile, that doesn’t have all 
of those things naturally working together?
So, when you ask where Mullen will be in the next four or ﬁve years, we’ll 
still be in advertising. We’ll still be an advertising agency. We will still be 
rooted in creative ideas. We will apply those ideas to more new places and 
platforms, to mobile and social and community kinds of things. The way 
in which we [create] will be more informed by creative technologists and 
developers and programmers, not just writers and art directors.
I personally am a big believer, even though some people don’t agree with 
me, that the future creative person is going to come as much from other 
areas as they do from the traditional writer, art director, and the crafts. In 
fact, if you look at the biggest cultural inﬂuencers of the last three or four 
years, who are they? They’re the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world, right? 
Programmers and nerds—not necessarily who we consider traditional 
communicators.
Tuten: Right.
Boches: They’re Ev Williams, they’re Steve Chen, they’re the guys who are 
inventing things like YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. They aren’t writers 
and art directors. They’re programmers. They just happen to be creative.
Tuten: But we’re still going to have to have content created, too.
Boches: Oh yeah, absolutely. But what is content going to be? Is content 
going to be a platform or an application? As I said earlier, I think future sto­
ries are going to be made out of technology and code and APIs [application 
programming interfaces] as much as they are out of words and pictures.

Tuten: So for my students now, or for your students next semester at BU,5 
what would you tell them about how to best prepare for being a creative 
technologist?6
Boches: Well, I don’t know if they need to be creative technologists. 
I think what they [each] need to do is have a speciﬁc skill and have it really 
well developed. They could be a writer. They could be an art director. They 
could be a designer. They could be a developer. They could be a UX [user 
experience design] person. They could be a videographer. All of those skills 
are still completely and totally necessary. The difference in the future is that 
you need to have a much broader perspective than just your speciﬁc skills.
So you’ve probably heard of the expression, “T-shaped person,” which is 
almost becoming a cliché.7 Look at any project these days—whether it’s 
Nike Plus or Garmin Connect or a Facebook app, or a mobile game, or 
a social experience, whatever kind of project that you look at—the team 
that makes that stuff now is much broader than it used to be. The people 
that you have to have in the room are well beyond what used to serve as 
a core creative team. There are now four, ﬁve, six, seven, eight roles maybe. 
Somebody who really knows social, someone who knows mobile, someone 
who can actually do front-end development, and so on.
The real challenge now is, how do you get all of those people to work really, 
really well together? In fact, how do you stay open-minded enough to believe 
that the idea that everybody is working toward may not be an “advertising 
idea,” or a concept that emanates from a television script, but may be some­
thing that transcends any one medium or execution. The skill that everybody 
in that room has to have, even if they all have a speciﬁc skill—the second 
skill that they all have to have is to be a T-shaped person. In other words, 
they must be able to see and understand, appreciate, and leverage the value 
of every other person on that team. They must understand their relation­
ship to the holistic thing that they’re trying to do. That is way easier said than 
done.
I actually remember the days when art directors would refuse to put URL 
addresses in a print ad because it would ruin the layout. You would have one

7 The T-shaped person is a metaphor among human resource professionals that describes 
the ideal employee. The T-shaped person has a depth of skill and expertise (the vertical 
aspect of the T), but is also capable of collaborating across many disciplines (the horizon­
tal aspect of the T).

person who was building the web site saying, “Well, if you don’t put the URL 
in the print ad, no one’s going to know the web site and people aren’t going 
to go there.” The art director’s attitude was, “Yeah, but you’re really fucking 
up the layout.” At the time, I actually engaged in those conversations. It was, 
“No, we don’t want to put the URL in the layout. It’s really going to look 
stupid.” You look back at that and go, “Oh my God. That was the most ridicu­
lous thing.” You had two people who had no appreciation for what each 
other’s contribution was to the project. The web people thought that all that 
mattered was the web, and the print people thought that no one was going 
to go to the web. Consumers were only going to read the print ads. Yet both 
the web person and the print person could make a remarkable contribution 
to the overall project. I guarantee you there’s plenty of people in the busi­
ness who remember those idiotic arguments.
Tuten: Now they’re saying that about the little Facebook icon.
Boches: Exactly. Now we’re forwarding to a thing where you have a user 
experience person telling somebody else, “I don’t really think the way you 
have that hierarchy in the navigation is really working at all.” Someone may 
say, “But it looks beautiful,” but the UX person may say, “Yeah, but we need 
usability here.” Even beyond that, the question may be, “what is it we should 
actually be making and creating? Should it be a platform? Should we actually 
be inventing something worth being advertised rather than simply advertis­
ing?” What I would tell students is, “Okay, develop a skill and master it to the 
degree possible, but then learn how to apply that skill within the context to 
where all these other rules are as fundamental as yours.”
Tuten: Given what you just described, what does a creative brief look like 
these days?
Boches: That’s a really, really good question because the creative brief prob­
ably looks as stupid as it did twenty years ago. The brief says, “Okay. Who 
are we talking to? What’s the problem we’re solving? What’s the message 
we should deliver? What are the executional guides?” Here we probably 
have multiple briefs and the briefs depend on whether or not we’re creating 
advertising, whether or not we’re starting from scratch and trying to solve a 
problem with something that may be beyond creative execution.
I think the brief ought to start with the problem that we’re trying to solve. 
The problem, by the way, may not be an advertising problem. It’s what kind 
of problem are we trying to solve that would make our brand of more value 
to this consumer?
I think the second thing it has to address is the use of media, technology, 
content, and community by the users, customers, or target audience or com­

Advertisers at Work
99
munity members. Thinking about how somebody interacts with stuff beyond 
just the brand and the category is really important. I would actually go so 
far as to have every brief basically say, “You can’t solve this problem with an 
ad. You have to solve this problem with an idea that isn’t an ad.” Then you 
get to invent this idea or creative that might be worth advertising, right? I 
think another way to look at it is to really ﬁgure out the problem behind 
the problem. The problem can’t be, “Oh, we want know about this product.” 
The problem might be, “Well, what problem do these people actually have 
that we could solve?” And maybe solving it and actually doing something of 
value in the world of social media, etc., might be the reason that gets them 
to pay attention to us and might turn them on to the product we want them 
to know about. That’s almost coming at it from an extreme perspective in 
order to ﬁght the inclination to solve problems with a TV commercial.
Does that make any sense?
Tuten: Yes, it really does. But it also sounds like it’s a really hard process to 
go through.
Boches: I think it really depends on the people involved. We do this exer­
cise sometimes where I’ll ask creative people, “Don’t you think you should 
learn a little bit more about technology? Don’t you think you should learn a 
little bit more about APIs or different platforms or whatever?” And often I’ll 
get an answer that’s something like, “No, I don’t need to do that.”
I’ll ask, “Well, why not?”
They’ll say, “Because I know that no matter what I think up, someone will be 
able to make it or produce it.” Which is true. There’s hardly anything you can 
think up that someone will not be able to do. Here’s the downside of that. 
If you’re not aware of the capabilities of technology and APIs and certain 
platforms, you may never think up the idea to begin with.
I think it was the day that Google did the Arcade Fire HTML 5 video8 that I 
had this exact same conversation with somebody. I dragged him in my ofﬁce 
and I showed him the video. I said, “Would you be able to think that up?” His 
jaw dropped open. It was the ﬁrst time he’d seen it. He was blown away. I 
said, “Would you be able to think that up? I’m sure someone could make it. 
Obviously, here it is. But would you be able to think it up?” The answer was, 
“Uhh, gee, uhh, yeah, actually, I, I, I couldn’t.”
I said, “Well, why not?”

“Because I would—I had no idea that something like that was even possible. 
I wouldn’t even know where to start.” These days, creative people need to 
be incredibly curious and interested in everything new that comes along.
We’re doing a project right now for Olympus where all of the content 
is being generated by users, and none of it by the brand itself, for a new 
camera. The campaign really just took a chapter out of Gary Vaynerchuk’s 
The Thank You Economy.9 We just gave out a thousand cameras to certain 
people who would be willing and promised to generate a certain amount of 
content. We then put in place an entire infrastructure using almost all open-
source platforms—Tumbler and Google+and Twitter and Facebook and 
YouTube—to generate, aggregate, collect, and spread that content all over 
the place. With a fraction of the cost of a media buy—of course, we still do 
some paid media—the social components make that paid media more effec­
tive. It takes a certain kind of person who will think that way and be open to 
thinking that way.
Tuten: You are encouraging your creatives to be aware of what’s pos­
sible and what’s new. But, what do you suggest that they do? What’s your 
approach for keeping up with all these new things?
Boches: Well, my approach to keeping up with things is to build a commu­
nity of people who can help me keep up because I don’t think you can do 
it by yourself. I mean, we can all, with good intent, build up our RSS reader, 
ﬁll our Pulse app10 with all the stuff we hope to or plan to read every day, 
or even organize our Tweet deck according to different topics and subjects, 
but that’s really hard to do on a daily basis. We can get good at using certain 
kinds of tools whether it’s Springpad11 or all of the stuff we might use to save 
things or bookmark stuff. But I think what you have to do is ﬁgure out how 
to manage.
I’ve got a certain group of people that I’ve developed relationships with 
ofﬂine and online around whatever topics I know matter to me—mobile, 
social, digital, education, brands, etc. So number one, I have people I can go 
to directly anytime I need stuff. Two, they know enough about what I do and 
what I care about and what I’m interested in that I’m pretty sure they’re 
going to send me stuff that matters to me. They’re going to ﬁlter content 
that’s for me. I can use my Google+circles more efﬁciently that way. It still

takes a little bit of an effort because you can’t simply just say, “Oh, okay, I’m 
just going to click on all these people and these names and just hope that 
they play that role for me.” You actually have to make the effort to give back 
and to develop a relationship with them and a dialogue and then hopefully 
that leads to that kind of quid pro quo with this community of people help­
ing each other stay up on what matters.
Tuten: Content-management through relationships.
Boches: Yeah. I mean, you can also read your ass off, but that takes a lot of time.
Tuten: Not nearly as efﬁcient. Now, you mentioned Springpad, and that was 
something that you helped to create.
Boches: Well, no, no. I’m on the board of directors. I didn’t help to create it.
Tuten: But it’s something that you believe in strongly.
Boches: Well, I think that they have a lot of potential. They’re still a start-
up and they’re pivoting from what they started-up being to what they’re 
doing now. They’ve added millions of users, but they’re a long way from 
being Facebook or Twitter. For me, being involved with companies like that, 
learning a little bit about how software companies think, is actually valuable 
for the advertising business. You can learn from hanging out with software 
start-ups the ideas of prototyping, AB testing, of being agile and putting stuff 
out on the marketplace when it isn’t completely ready, when it’s still in beta. 
Letting users deﬁne how to make products better.
Many of these things are in some ways like the antithesis to how advertising 
works, where we make our stuff so precious and we want it to be perfect 
and magniﬁcently designed, and then we’ve got to produce it and then we 
put it out into the marketplace. That long, linear process might lead to some­
thing that’s gorgeous and ﬁnished, but it’s not always the best. In a world 
where things change daily and things are disposable more quickly, it’s not 
always the best way to do things. I think we’re going to see more conver­
gence among and between marketing, advertising, and software and gaming-
type companies over the next ﬁve years.
Tuten: Are you involved in any of that gaming work?
Boches: I’m not doing anything myself in that space really at the moment. 
The agency’s doing some stuff, but I’m not. I’m not really there, personally. I 
support it, but I’m not working on it.
Tuten: You’re really active outside of Mullen. Things like the Springpad board 
and the content that you produce, and teaching with institutions, and giving 
industry talks. Which aspects of your work do you enjoy the most and why?

Chapter 7 |  Edward Boches: Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, Mullen
102
Boches: I think the one thing that ties all of those things together is sort of 
sharing what I know. If I’m helping a start-up company with ideas about how 
to think about marketing, or I’m teaching a course, or I’m lecturing, or I’m 
running workshops, or I’m blogging, what ties all of that stuff together is the 
idea of sharing. And I think that’s really interesting—there’s a real interesting 
beneﬁt to doing that.
Number one is appealing to an awful lot of different people in communi­
ties, many of whom will gladly reciprocate. The second thing is it really helps 
you interact with people that you might not naturally interact with. Doing so 
exposes you to a lot more new thinking and ideas and platforms and conversa­
tions—all of which are fodder for your own learning and progress. All of which 
is stuff that you can bring back to the agency and package as examples, or infor­
mation from clients, or content that helps with doing business.
The third thing that it helps is that by sharing knowledge, say if you have 
to give a speech someplace, you’ve got to really clarify your thoughts, and 
you’ve got to organize them, and you’ve got to write them down. You’ve 
got to develop a point of view. All of that makes you sharper as a content 
creator and a salesperson. These are incredibly vital skills when you’re trying 
to pitch and win business, or pitch and attract believers in an idea that you 
think would be good for the agency. I think everybody knows that really 
good creative people are combinations of idea generators and salespeople. 
I may not be making ads per se, but I’m applying certain aspects of creativity 
into some of these other areas.
Tuten: Do you have any rituals that are important to your ability to work 
creatively?
Boches: The only ritual I would have—and I didn’t even understand this 
until recently, but it’s become more clear—I would call it seeking collisions. 
I just read, and it might have even been a Steve Jobs’s quote, that when you 
ask creative people how they do what they do, many times they can’t actu­
ally explain or give a reason how and why they came up with ideas. His 
argument was what creative people inherently do is they combine things in 
different ways that create small explosions or that yield something that is an 
unexpected result of two things.
Also, if you read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From,12 you get 
that same thing. Johnson would argue, and others have argued, that cities 
are more creative than suburbs. [And he explains] why New York is more 
12 Riverhead Books, 2010.

103
creative than Paris. It’s because Paris pushes the congestion of the new city 
out to the ring and they try to preserve the history of the old city, and as a 
result they have fewer collisions and, therefore, there’s nothing really won­
derful and creative that’s emerging out of Paris compared to, say, Shanghai 
and New York, etc.
You see the same thing in a way in companies like Pixar and IDEO and other 
creative companies that now work in these little congested environments. 
My ritual is trying to mash things up that don’t belong together, that come 
from different places, whether it’s literature and advertising, or physical space 
and theater, or sources of content from different disciplines, or even just the 
people that you try to interact with and engage. I think good ideas come 
from collisions. I’ll give you just a simple example, which we’re excited about. 
Am I talking too much or do you want to hear this?
Tuten: No, I want to hear it.
Boches: Okay, so I was at Google Zeitgeist,13 privileged to be invited. It was 
in Phoenix. I sat next to Sandra Day O’Connor.14 I talked to Robert Reich15 
and Arianna Hufﬁngton.16 I saw the guys who did the High Line17 in New 
York and Pencils of Promise,18 the inventor of Angry Birds, and all this really, 
really amazing stuff.
Here’s the collision that happened to me. So Robert Reich talks about how 
the problem in America is that there’s an “us and them” going on, and I’ve 
used that expression before in some of my presentations—that our com­
munities of concern are getting narrower. Congress doesn’t care really 
about unemployment because unemployment among college grads is only 
ﬁve percent and they’re closer to college grads than they are to high school 
dropouts, where unemployment is thirty-ﬁve percent. To groups with whom 
we have empathy and interdependency, we care about, and those with whom 
we don’t have empathy and interdependency, it’s easier for us to dismiss.

Europe can basically now say, well, Greece isn’t really a part of them, so do 
they really have to worry about Greece? This thought about community 
really struck me as being an interesting problem that we have.
The second thing is someone asked a question of Sandra Day O’Connor 
that was completely irrelevant to any of this. It was a conversation about 
juries and jury selection, and this thought of juries sort of popped into my 
head and I thought, “Oh, that’s really interesting.” Juries are people who are 
from different backgrounds, different socioeconomic backgrounds, and juries 
work really well. People take responsibility, they’re incredibly diligent, they 
come to good decisions. Then I started to also think about what little I know 
about the military service, which is similar. Then I started to think about 
what I know about social media because all these things that we’re talking 
about vis-à-vis Robert Reich are ironic in an age when social media enables 
us to all connect to each other. But what do we do on social media? We 
connect to like-minded people.
One of the things that college students do before they go off to college is to 
search on Facebook to ﬁnd someone to be their roommate. They search for 
someone who will stay in their comfort zone as opposed to seeking some­
body who’s completely and totally different from another background.
Now all of a sudden, these three, four things crashed into my brain and I 
came up with an idea. The basic idea is “can mandatory social media service 
save America?” My thought is instead of having mandatory military service 
and mandatory community service, what if we had mandatory social media 
service? What if the basic idea was you get recruited and you get put into 
a circle, a Google circle if you will, with eleven other people from different 
regions, different ethnic backgrounds, different socioeconomic backgrounds, 
etc., and you get handed a problem? The problem could be obesity, or pov­
erty, or unemployment, or the fact that young men get all their sex educa­
tion from watching online porn. You get handed the problem and you have 
to solve the problem as a group, not unlike a jury. You have benchmark goal 
setting and procedure. There’s a proctor who pays attention to this thing and 
the result comes out and gets posted on a common web site, where legis­
latures and the press and academia and business can get ideas and begin to 
implement them.
Maybe we will solve problems and maybe we won’t, but the idea is that we’d 
have a pretty good likelihood of increasing empathy, interdependency, and 
an understanding of other people’s perspectives by having mandatory social 
media service. The service would not be that demanding since basically every 
eighteen-year-old in America is on social media already. And yes, there are 
three or four things we have to ﬁgure out, such as the multilingual thing,

access to technology for everybody, and how to actually implement this 
thing. But it’s the best idea that I’ve had all year. Do you think it’s any good?
Tuten: I think it’s really interesting. I’m wondering how you would assess 
the effectiveness of it.
Boches: Well, there are probably short-term and long-term ways of assess-
ing the effectiveness of it. That’s a very, very good question. I don’t have all 
the answers to that, but I could ramble off a couple from the top of my head. 
First of all, it could be the reaction of the participants and whether or not 
they, in a post-participation survey, had a different perspective of people 
whose opinions are different from theirs. You could measure the effective-
ness by the number of ideas that got posted on this web site that resulted in 
new policies or proposed legislation across all of these issues. You could also 
look at the quality of the content that came out of it. You could subsequently 
look at whether or not any of those were ever implemented or were effec-
tive. And you could also look at whether or not there was an increased 
overall empathy among people who just seem to go at each other among 
their differences. I think you could set up ways to look at it short term and 
long term, short term from as early as six months, long term—ﬁve or ten 
years out.
Tuten: And even maybe a longitudinal study of the success of the people 
who participate?
Boches: Exactly. Now, the real point is that while there may or may not be 
merit in this idea, it certainly makes for an interesting conversation. But it’s 
an example of collision. Using collisions to generate ideas. So thank you for 
enduring that little spiel.
I’m thinking this idea will have to be seeded initially via schools or states, 
because I don’t think Congress is going to pass the thing and make it manda-
tory. There’s two points to that crazy little story. Point number one is colli-
sions of ideas and thinking. If you seek them out or just make them part of 
your daily routine, you end up having interesting ideas. The second aspect is 
what kind of responsibility do brands have to ﬁxing and addressing some of 
the social problems that are out there? At least in my own personal case, as I 
live in a new space, being inﬂuenced by so many new things and technologies, 
I become increasingly interested in things that are different, in things that are 
potentially more, meaningful than, say, advertising. There’s still a relationship 
to advertising, because I think that in a world where we’re connected to 
each other and we have things like social media to connect us, brands have a 
responsibility to addressing social problems. I also think it would be good for 
them businesswise.

Tuten: In terms of what it means to consumers or in terms of the growth it 
allows for the brand?
Boches: Both. I think that we will see brands that practice real social 
responsibility will actually do better proﬁt-wise. They will do better, a) 
because they endeared themselves to certain constituencies and customers, 
and b) because they contribute to improving the world around them a little 
bit, which may actually generate better economic situations that yield more 
business. And then I think that they may actually learn what it is they should 
be doing. It might be less altruistic and less selﬁsh and greedy. It has worked 
for certain brands. It’s worked for Apple and Google and Nike. You do see it 
in some cases.
Tuten: It just needs to become more prevalent.
Boches: Yes. Pepsi made a really great effort with Pepsi Refresh.19 I think 
at the end of the day, they’re not sure it actually contributed to business as 
much as traditional advertising. People who want to preserve the status quo 
will make that argument vociferously. I think that in the longer term, espe­
cially if you look at a younger generation, for whom this stuff may matter 
more, I think it’s already a good place to invest.
Tuten: What’s next for you? What hopes and dreams and aspirations? Is 
it going to be in the area of creating collisions and social responsibility, or 
something more?
Boches: There are three things actually that I’m interested in. I would love 
to do a start-up or work more with start-ups. I don’t know if any of the 
ideas about mandatory social media service will materialize or turn into 
anything, but if they do, maybe that will be my start-up. If I get a presidential 
candidate to believe in mandatory social media service and he or she gets 
elected and wants me to come and help run that program, maybe I’ll do 
that. I’m still interested in changing this industry or helping it stay caught 
up and relevant. And then I also have become really excited about teach­
ing, which has been a result of doing an executive-in-residence and running 
some workshops and lecturing in a bunch of classes. So I’ll learn more about 
the potential for teaching from my experience next semester at Boston 
University. Teaching is something I am really drawn to.

Dentsu America
Doug Fidoten is president of Dentsu America, Inc. (www.dentsuamerica.com), a 
full-service agency that is part of the Dentsu Network. He is a graduate of Oberlin 
College, an experience he was able to customize to address his interests in busi­
ness and photography. Fidoten’s regard for photography has served him well as he 
moved from the creative side of the advertising industry to roles in account man­
agement and eventually to the leadership team at Dentsu America. Doug Fidoten 
led the Canon team at Dentsu America and remains active in that account despite 
the demands of his role. In 2006, he was named the ﬁrst American president for 
Dentsu. Still an avid photographer, Fidoten lives in Manhattan with his wife and 
three children.
Tracy Tuten: What in your background brought you to this industry in the 
ﬁrst place
Doug Fidoten: I didn’t grow up in an advertising family. I really didn’t know 
anything about it. It wasn’t something that I was familiar with either from a 
relative or from somewhere in the family. My mother was actually an artist 
and an art teacher, and my father was really more in the analytical world. By 
the time I was conscious of what my father did, he had moved into the com­
puter space and was working on computer automation for manufacturing 
processes and things that were really kind of at the cutting edge of what was 
happening in the earlier ages of computers. My father was focused on com­
puters as they related to ofﬁce automation and manufacturing automation.

You can see our household was ﬁlled with a lot of duality. On the one hand, 
I was exposed to a lot of art. We went to a lot of museums. We heard a lot 
of music. We did a lot of activities that were of high interest to my parents 
and, of course, they wanted their kids to be exposed to these experiences 
whether we, the kids, wanted it or not. When you’re young, you don’t really 
appreciate these things. Later on you realize, “Gee, I’m really glad I did this 
when I did.” So that was one side of what it was like growing up. The other 
side of my development was based on inﬂuences from my father. He was 
involved in information systems, and he’d get invited to conferences, and he 
would take the family. He’d be at the conference for a couple of days and 
then we’d travel on vacation. My favorite thing as a kid was to visit the show 
ﬂoors at the conferences and see all the vendors displaying their innovations 
and wares. Not a lot has changed. That’s still going on.
As a young kid, I loved walking around and collecting all the trinkets they 
were giving out, you know, the notepads and all the other little things. As 
we would walk through, my father would show me things and make sure I 
was exposed to the new developments in the world of technology. One of 
the best examples was Xerox’s featuring the earliest example of a graphical 
user interface. And the mouse was at one of these shows for the ﬁrst time. 
They were developed by Xerox, through their PARC [Palo Alto] research 
facility. I remember my father remarking about how amazing it was and what 
a breakthrough it was [compared to] what he was experienced with. Years 
later, obviously, that became the roots for the Mac and what inspired Steve 
Jobs and everything that came after, even though Xerox never ﬁgured out 
what to do with it.
My young way of bringing these two spheres together originally fell into 
the world of photography. I literally had my ﬁrst camera in second grade 
and moved up the levels of sophistication as I got older. I think by the time 
I was in eighth or ninth grade, I had an SLR [single lens reﬂex camera], and 
I learned darkroom work. My father had given me access to work in the 
photo labs on the weekends at the company where he worked. Because of 
my mother, and remember she was both a teacher and an artist, was doing 
coursework at Carnegie Mellon, I would get access to work with etchings 
and lithography stones. So I had this passion that just grew over time. This 
passion really was both the science side of photography, which was chemis­
try and, if you want to understand it, the physics of light, and then the artistic 
side of it.
Tuten: Did you study advertising in college?
Fidoten: I went to Oberlin College. At that time, I was still continuing to 
ﬁgure out how to bring these halves—science and art—together. Oberlin’s a 

Advertisers at Work
109
great school, very intellectual, very willing to let students kind of chart their 
own path, and rather than adopt a traditional major, I actually had the ability 
to do my own major. I designed and named my own major, which, if I still 
remember correctly, was “Physiology, Perception, and the Visual Arts.” My 
thinking behind it was a combination of how the physiology of our nervous 
system and our brain affects the way we perceive the world and the way we 
perceive art. The psychology behind it, which is not necessarily part of the 
wiring, and then ultimately, how that expresses itself in the development of 
art over time. Like the single-point perspective in the Renaissance, and things 
like that. That major gave me the opportunity to continue to use photogra­
phy as my artistic expression.
Eventually that led me to an opportunity away from school in which I 
apprenticed as a photographer. I literally apprenticed in New York City with 
a professional photographer, a very famous guy by the name of George Tice.1 
He was not a commercial photographer in the sense that he was shooting 
for advertising. He made his money selling his work through galleries, selling 
books, and he’d won either a Guggenheim or a MacArthur. I really forget 
which, but something that allowed him to spend most of his time taking pho­
tographs and not so much making money. I went to work for him for that 
period and really learned the craft of photography and developed a passion 
for it in a way I’d never had a chance to do before. I’d never had that level of 
skill or mentorship.
Tuten: So this is how you ended up in New York?
Fidoten: This is another inﬂection point that would lead to a number 
of things. First, when I ﬁnished my apprenticeship, I went back to school, 
ﬁnished my major, and continued to do the photography I was doing and 
the coursework I had to do to graduate. After a very brief moment at home 
trying to decide what was next, I decided to go back to New York City. I had 
a pocket full of names from people I’d met during my apprenticeship, and I 
felt like that’s where I belonged. I had been to New York when I was much 
younger because my family had lived on Long Island, but I’ve often said it was 
as if I had just been away on an extended trip.
There’s no time for this romantic story, but I’ll tell it anyway. I had been in 
school at Oberlin, and I hadn’t been in New York in many, many, many years. 
1 George Tice is most famous for his large, black-and-white photographs of New Jersey. 
His work is included in many major museum collections throughout the world and 
is depicted in several books including Hometowns: An American Pilgrimage (New York 
Graphic Society, 1988).

I hitchhiked with a friend to New York. We ended up on Staten Island with 
our last ride, walked to the ferry, took a ferry ride to downtown Manhattan 
as the sun was setting and glinting off the World Trade Center, and for the 
ﬁrst time, you know, as if I were an immigrant, I felt at home. It was that 
experience that really led to my coming back. After I graduated from school, 
I came to New York with a portfolio of pictures and a pocketful of names, 
wonderfully naïve, and just started knocking on doors until somebody 
would have me. I ended up assisting, [working] as a photographer’s assistant. 
Terrible pay, worse than advertising, but tremendously exciting, and that’s 
really where I met advertising people. I was in a commercial studio. We were 
doing ads for American Express and others, and for the ﬁrst time I was 
learning about the ﬁeld of advertising.
I met account people—I really didn’t know what they did except they 
seemed to take the clients to lunch [laughter]—and art directors. That 
was my ﬁrst inkling that there was a world outside of what I knew. In an 
odd way, advertising began for me as an effort to fund my career, which I 
thought was going to be photography. Sure enough, I ﬁrst ended up in a little 
agency. Then I got the bug. I could see there was this connection between 
art and science—or art and thinking, art and strategy—that took hold of 
me. I started my next push and said to myself, “Okay, now I want to be on 
Madison Avenue.”
That led ﬁrst to AC&R and then BatesAlliance, an agency that I ran for Bates 
and, ultimately, Dentsu. As I said, [there were] all of these career inﬂection 
points: when I ﬁrst met Kaz Kudo—my mentor, when I ﬁrst found myself 
working on some Japanese accounts, and then years and years and years 
later, not only working this time for an agency that is headquartered in Japan 
and started in Asia, but working on projects for the greatest photographic 
company on the planet, Canon. How all those things happen, I couldn’t tell 
you. Maybe that’s part of fate or that’s part of . . .
Tuten: Your destiny?
Fidoten: Some trail out there that we walk on and we don’t even real­
ize we’re on it, but I couldn’t be more grateful that all of that somehow fell 
together as it did.
Tuten: Tell me more about how you transitioned from those early days into 
really knowing where you ﬁt in the industry.
Fidoten: This question reminds me about a campaign that I had done an 
awfully long time ago. It was my ﬁrst actually. It wasn’t my ﬁrst job in adver­
tising. It was my second job in advertising. But it was the ﬁrst time where 
the work was really under my control and my direction, and I was still quite 

Advertisers at Work
111
young. We were pitching business, and it was also my ﬁrst pitch. Eventually 
I did two pitches with the same client, but the ﬁrst one was the most 
signiﬁcant.
Tuten: Yes.
Fidoten: The pitch was for Hertz car sales. This pitch was really kind of my 
bridge—a bridge that got me out of a little retail agency [and allowed me] 
to cross over to Madison Avenue. It was also the pitch that brought me to a 
person who served as my mentor—Kaz Kudo.
[He was my boss] at what I would call my ﬁrst legitimate Madison Avenue 
agency. He’s an interesting story in and of himself because he is Japanese, 
but he was not working in a Japanese agency. At the time, nobody had even 
thought about a Japanese agency. This was very much a traditional, Madison 
Avenue, US-based agency, but through a series of gratuitous circumstances, 
this man ended up working there. Eventually, while I was still working for 
him, he wrote a book. The book was about his life as the ﬁrst Japanese 
national working on Madison Avenue. That book has never been translated. 
It was only published in Japanese, but it was a somewhat successful book in 
Japan. In particular, it became something that was picked up and read by a lot 
of young, aspiring account people at Dentsu, which, of course, is my current 
place.
So there are these points along the journey. Everyone has them. Points at 
which one can look back and see an indicator or a coincidence that relates 
to a place we land later. This is clearly one of them. At the time, and perhaps 
even later, one can never really understand how these came about or what 
they might mean. This story is just one of these points along my journey and 
these points lined up in a certain direction that I would never have under­
stood in my young twenties.
Tuten: So you started at a small shop, but then you had the chance to move. 
Tell me more about that and Kaz Kudo.
Fidoten: Yes, I made the move from the little retail ad shop where I got my 
ﬁrst job in advertising to AC&R Advertising at 437 Madison Avenue. I had 
really had a hard time moving because I had worked there for a year and a 
half or two years, and at the little shop I was kind of a jack-of-all-trades. In 
a real agency, nobody does everything. This was exacerbated in that at the 
small shop, nobody was really giving any credit to what I was doing. Plus, I 
couldn’t point to any of the clients as being anything anybody would actually 
pay any attention to! I mean, they were little retail accounts from all over the 
country, but [nothing] anyone would actually have ever heard of. So getting 
that break and getting that ﬁrst interview with the type of agency I wanted 
to work with took some doing.
f

I had had a couple of interviews at this place on Madison. They said, “Okay, 
we’re going to bring you back and have you meet with a man named Kaz 
Kudo.” When I arrived, he was in a client meeting. So I was waiting there for 
him to come back from the meeting, and he ﬁnally showed up. I was ushered 
into his ofﬁce. I remember it still—the ofﬁce was everything you could imag­
ine. It was a big executive ofﬁce. Kudo had a kind of very imposing character 
about him. And, of course, this was at the time reﬂected now in Mad Men. 
Everybody was still smoking all the time. He lit up a cigarette, looked at my 
résumé, and started to smoke the cigarette. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t 
say a word to me for what felt like forever. I’m sure it was probably only 
maybe two or three minutes, but I think two to three minutes of silence in 
an interview has got to be a frightening kind of experience to anyone. He 
didn’t speak and I didn’t say a word. I didn’t say a word. I waited for him to 
speak ﬁrst. It was that action that actually got me the job! I mean, there were 
other things as well, but the fact that I had the patience to sit there, which 
immediately represented a cultural understanding to him—one that I didn’t 
even know. I had never dealt with anybody who was Japanese before. I don’t 
even think I had ever even been to a Japanese restaurant. And the fact that 
I had that patience, just sitting there and waiting, when I think most would 
have tried to ﬁll up the time with some nervous chatter.
I remember the next day when I got the call. I was offered the job, and the 
guy, who was sort of the intermediary, said, “You did very, very well with 
Mr. Kudo.” And I thought, “What did I do?” It’s only after I came to know him 
very well, not only as a mentor but also as a friend, that I understood. There 
are things like this experience that have played major roles in my career, 
again many points further down the road. Sometimes I’ll be in a situation 
with a group of Japanese executives and some other Americans, and after­
wards I’ll have understood the context of the meeting, even though half of 
it’s in Japanese and half of it’s in English. I’ll be sharing the context with the 
other Americans, “This is what happened. This is what’s going on, this is what 
somebody said.” They’ll say, “You must speak Japanese.” But I have to explain, 
“No. I don’t speak Japanese, but what I do understand is from a cultural 
point of view and from a business point of view. I understand the dynamic of 
what’s important in the room.”
Tuten: How did you learn to understand these kinds of cultural nuances?
Fidoten: Culture is more important than the language itself. The Japanese 
language can be exceedingly difﬁcult and complex. But in terms of those con­
nections between how we do business, how the Japanese look at it, and how 
to connect the dots, all of it literally goes back to that moment when Kaz 
was smoking the cigarette in his ofﬁce.

113
Tuten: Are you still in touch with Kaz Kudo?
Fidoten: Yes. He’s not a young man, and he makes his home in Japan now. 
We still correspond periodically via e-mail. He still remains a signiﬁcant 
ﬁgure in my life.
Tuten: Does he know how important he is to you?
Fidoten: I think he certainly does. He has contacts at Dentsu, and I think he 
periodically touches base with some of them and gets word of what I’m up 
to. Hopefully, I make him proud.
Tuten: I’m sure you do.
Fidoten: He was a tough boss and I know he did his best to teach me well. 
I think as can only happen in the Japanese mentoring system. I can’t remem­
ber the Japanese word for it, but there is kind of this Japanese sensibility of 
the mentor and the mentee.
Tuten: Sensei.
Fidoten: Well, sensei certainly, but there’s another expression for it as well, 
and I think I’ve always had that relationship to certain other people who 
have been my mentors, and it’s always been the same. No matter where we 
are in life, what our titles are, what our ages are, the nature of that relation­
ship never changes. I think obviously, people have that relationship with their 
parents, but I think they also realize that with mentors and people who are 
signiﬁcant in their life, that never changes. But I always think in my mind, “Is 
what I’m doing making them proud in terms of the inﬂuence they had on 
me?”
Tuten: Well, if you’d like, we can send him a copy of the book.
Fidoten: That would be nice. That would be really nice.
Tuten: Tell me about your favorite campaign. Do you have one that is espe­
cially meaningful to you?
Fidoten: Our agency had an opportunity to pitch for the Maxell business. 
Most people will know a very famous campaign for Maxell audiotape. It was 
a campaign done by Scali, McCabe, Sloves, and the concept was of this guy 
kind of sitting in his chair and getting blown away by the power and clarity 
of the music. That wasn’t what we were pitching for. At that point, Maxell 
was introducing a whole new category of products—computer products. 
This was during the very early stages of the PC, when the central form of 
memory was ﬂoppy disks. None of your readers are going to remember this 
[laughter].

Chapter 8 |  Doug Fidoten: President, Dentsu America
114
Maxell was introducing its series of ﬂoppy disks and it was going to be a new 
competitor in the market for computer storage devices. Now, in the excite­
ment of the category at the time, where PCs were changing all the time and 
the category was in its ﬁrst big boom, nothing could be less interesting or 
less utilitarian than computer memory. It was my ﬁrst opportunity to not 
only win the business, but to actually understand the power of a brand. It 
was my ﬁrst opportunity to bring a brand into a category where it was so 
hard to distinguish one brand from the next. Literally, the only thing that 
would distinguish one brand from another in this product category was the 
name placed on the box.
How do you get people to understand the power of something that was 
actually one of the ﬁrst digital recording mediums? We won the business and 
we had a few campaigns. I don’t know that any of them were very distin­
guished. But then, we really hit on this idea that we would separate the prod­
uct by claiming it. By identifying it on the packaging, by creating this notion of 
the gold standard, creating literally a seal, making it part of the box, making 
it part of the campaign. We introduced the brand as the gold standard, in a 
product category where there was no standard. There was no way of distin­
guishing one from the next. This concept meant that when a prospect looked 
at the packaging, immediately it was clear that there’s something about this 
brand that’s different than the others.
Once we established that standard, we built a campaign, which to this day 
I still love. I don’t know if I could ever ﬁnd any examples of it. We came up 
with this notion of what’s the ultimate computer, and if a computer could 
speak, if a computer could be discerning, why would it choose one product 
over another? Why would it choose Maxell over another brand? And the 
computer that we decided was the ultimate computer—and, again, you’ve 
got to realize how long ago this was—was a robot. We actually created a 
series of robots and created a campaign that was, for all intents and pur­
poses, wordless. Imagine the contrast. Where every other brand was spout­
ing specs and talking about this versus the other thing in what was then 
a very technical world, we had an ad that represented something entirely 
different.
See if you can imagine this. It was a beautiful ad. It was a gold robot staring

huge hit. These things were running in magazines when magazines were still a 
source of information, like Fortune and Forbes.
The ads tested through the roof, and in a category that had no real inter-
est, against some of the other things we were selling. That was my ﬁrst real 
visceral understanding of the power of creating a brand and the power of 
creating a difference using communication and powerful creative to cut 
through and make a statement. Also, the power of a visual, in that case to say 
much more than one hundred words could have said, much less what one 
thousand words could have said. And here it was still really just my second 
real advertising experience. For many years, that agency, AC&R, was my 
home. Unfortunately, it doesn’t exist anymore.
I can really remember that moment as a real turning point in terms of 
understanding the business I was in—what we were doing, how we can 
make a difference. When you ﬁrst get into the business, it is an apprentice-
ship. No matter what you’ve learned in school, you’ve got to learn the ropes. 
You’ve got to learn the craft. You’ve got to learn how agencies function and 
what the rhythms are and what the energy is and how people deal with each 
other. You can only learn this in the real world. You’ll never learn that in a 
classroom. Obviously, I never had the ability to learn these things before my 
ﬁrst jobs. I never did an internship in the business, and so I didn’t even know 
the basics until I got into it. Even at my ﬁrst job, that little shop with only 
four or ﬁve people, I never really understood. Because there, everyone did 
everything.
Tuten: Tell me about that transition—from your ﬁrst experience in the 
industry to feeling like you understood how agencies work.
Fidoten: I never really understood what the real roles were. You can be in 
any agency of any size, and actually sooner or later you’ll realize that you 
meet all the same people. They’re different—their names are different and 
they look a little different, but in fact they play similar roles within the struc-
ture of the agency.
What I understood when I got my ﬁrst break was how to get a job done. 
I was brought in to my ﬁrst job to play multiple roles. I was young account 
guy, media buyer, and courier, you know, all rolled up into one. I might call 
some of these roles “trafﬁc,” even “production,” these days but I was all of 
those things. It was not a fun job. I’m glad I didn’t do it too long, but it did 
give me something that I could package and offer as experience to come in 
to another agency. I was invited to join another agency because they really 
were looking for somebody who could do that on a unique piece of busi-
ness and kind of use my ability to get the job done. I used my ability as the

promise of, “Okay, but I want to get into a more mainstream role and I don’t 
want to be doing this forever.”
Often times I think to myself, you know, that happens all the time now. 
I mean, still to this day I have people come work for me that start in an 
internship type of position or assistant coordinator, whatever. And I’ll say, 
“Look, give me a year. Give me a year of your life doing what I need, and 
then you go on to do what you want to do.” I’ve always hired like that. As a 
matter of fact, anytime I’ve tried to hire what I’d call a professional assistant, 
where that’s kind of their role in life—that really they just want to be, you 
know, that executive assistant—it’s never really worked for me. I’ve always 
wanted to work with people who come in ambitious about the business, and 
see it as a starting point. The starting point might be as an assistant! Maybe 
it’s just because of the way I grew up in the business and it just feels the 
most comfortable to me.
Tuten: What does your current assistant want to be?
Fidoten: I think Melissa wants to go into strategic planning. So I think I’ve 
got maybe another six to seven months, and that’s about it. Before Melissa, 
I had another guy. He almost gave me a year, and then he got lured away as 
an account person at a great agency in Los Angeles. So my desk, or near my 
desk, has always been a pathway to something. The industry is ﬁlled with 
people I’ve watched move on to great jobs and great careers and do great 
stuff. I’m ﬁne with that. I always feel good about it. I hate losing people, but I 
know this is an industry where, if you don’t move, you don’t learn what you 
need to learn. If you don’t look for the next step on the ladder, you’re not 
going to grow.
Tuten: As a photographer, it seemed that you would have come up through 
the creative side. But yet you’ve ended up on the strategic side. How did 
that happen?
Fidoten: Good question. I think ﬁrst of all, to be honest, until I got into 
advertising, I didn’t understand the creative side. I didn’t even understand 
how the creative side works. Now you would think, okay, I was working with 
a commercial photographer, how could I not get that? But I wasn’t intro­
duced to any of the things that many of us would take for granted now in 
terms of what the concepts are behind advertising, how the creative side 
thinks about kind of the underlying strategy, and then how to express that 
in art and copy. I really came at it from such a different direction that all I 
really knew was we were trying to illustrate something that an art director 
had scribbled, usually on a napkin. I only saw it as a visual sort of puzzle to 
be solved and even then I only saw it as the end result of the photograph. 

Advertisers at Work
117
I never really saw the full context of it, and I didn’t really know the roles of 
copywriters and art directors and creative directors and all the people that 
were involved on that side of the business.
I remember one of the ﬁrst shots I did years ago. Every American Express 
ad had, in the corner, a shot of the card and some little object that was 
signiﬁcant to the ad. The name on that card—I don’t know if this is still 
true—but the name that was on the card in the ad was always C. F. Frost, 
who I later learned was actually an account person who worked on the 
account and must have sold his name to American Express for a dollar 
to use in the ad. We were shooting an ad that was meant to get cards to 
students who were just graduating. The goal was to get these new graduates 
their ﬁrst American Express card. I shot the inset shot, which was the card 
and a pen. Later, I was given the completed ad. I must still have the ad some­
where, but this was literally the ﬁrst time I understood that there was a 
main visual, there was body copy, there was a headline, there was a concept, 
and there was a point being made. Seriously.
By the time I got into advertising and started understanding what was 
involved, my inclination seemed to move more to the account side because I 
seemed to have a facility to work with clients, to understand what they were 
doing and what they wanted. I didn’t really understand the training that was 
necessary on the creative side, and I hadn’t gone through any of that training.
Once I got into a larger agency and roles were more clearly deﬁned, I was 
already going down this account-work road. What attracted me to account 
work was really strategic thinking. There’s obviously a lot of work that’s not 
strategic, that is just the kind of running the business and getting it done. But 
being on the account side, it didn’t keep me from being involved or perhaps 
overly involved on the creative side. Over the years—and probably differ­
ent creative people will weigh in on the positive and not so positive side of 
this—I’ve always felt comfortable working very closely with creative people, 
understanding what their challenges are, being able to talk to them in a way 
that maybe account people in the past weren’t. Account people were always 
known as, are still known as, “the suits.” You know, nobody wears a suit 
anymore, or rarely. [But] understanding early on in my career the challenges 
creative people have with the work that they do and also understanding 
what it means to sell the work has been a beneﬁt.
Because if you didn’t really appreciate the work and understand what it took 
to create the work, you could be very dismissive of it. The minute the client 
looked at it and said, “Well, I don’t think that’s what we want,” you’re really 
not going to be in a position to be very effective in arguing for it.

Chapter 8 |  Doug Fidoten: President, Dentsu America
118
What I discovered along the way was in order to truly be effective with 
clients and as an account person and as somebody who is a representative 
for the agency and the agency’s point of view, it’s incumbent on you to really 
understand the client’s business as well or better than the client does.
Tuten: It’s important to know the client business, but how can we do that 
from our position within the agency?
Fidoten: [You do your best.] I learned that lesson, many times, and I learned 
it very early on. I’ve often said for years to the account people working for 
me that I expect them to be as conversant in the technology and the issues 
that the clients are facing and understand the product as well or better than 
their clients do. Because if they don’t, there’s no way they can be credible. 
There’s no way they can speak with authority and defend or recommend 
anything. Clients see right through it.
On the other hand, when you’ve been on the front lines, when you’ve been 
out there with them, at the counter, selling the products, being involved with 
the engineers or being involved with the salespeople, you carry so much 
more credibility. You can do it at any age. I think one of the reasons that at a 
relatively young age I was in a position to lead accounts and have signiﬁcant 
positions in my agency had more to do with my knowledge of the category 
and the business that the clients were in than it had anything to do with 
even how good I was, let’s say, at advertising.
When I was at AC&R, I did a lot of technology work. I understood the 
category. I understood what was going on. My creative people worked with 
me because they knew I could help them and the clients worked with me. 
I’ll never forget, I spent close to a decade running the Foot Locker business, 
on the agency side, not the client side, and had great clients there, many of 
whom had kind of grown up in the Foot Locker system. That was a company 
where if you wanted to come up through the ranks, you started in the store 
selling shoes. Otherwise, you never had credibility in the company, in those 
years.
I was out with a guy, terriﬁc friend of mine [at Foot Locker], Brent Hollowell. 
Now, he’s vice president of marketing with Woolrich. Brent and I were hav­
ing a big challenge in Texas. There was competition down there, and it was 
really kicking our butts, and no one understood what to do. Brent and I got 
on the plane, ﬂew down to Texas, and started visiting stores, talking to the 
managers, store by store, “What’s the issue? What’s going on here?” We 
walked into one store, and Brent looked at me and said, “Doug, let’s put on 
the stripes.” We went to the back of the store, took off our sport coats and 
our ties, put on the stripes, and went out on the ﬂoor, and for the rest of the 

Advertisers at Work
119
day, we were busy selling. Now for him, this was second nature because this 
was where he had come from. To me, this was a ﬁrst.
We came up with a great campaign for Texas, with a lot of good ideas, and 
we went to sell it at headquarters. We walked in to present to these guys 
who had all started in the stores, selling on the ﬂoor. We started talking 
about why we wanted to do this and where this was coming from and what 
we had done to understand the situation. The minute I said, “Yep, I was on 
the ﬂoor. I was selling shoes,” everybody was listening. For the rest of the 
time I spent working on that company, it completely changed how we did 
business together.
At one point, a lot of their marketing money, a lot of their advertising money 
was supplied by the shoe companies. They had the ability to sort of roll it 
all up into one big fund and use it as they wished. The biggest, most power­
ful shoe company at the time was Nike, and Nike changed its mind and said, 
“No, we don’t want our money being commingled with other vendors’. It 
can only represent Nike products, and therefore we’ll be happy to do the 
advertising for you and we’ll be sure to feature the store and feature our 
shoes.” Given that this sum represented a huge percentage of sales, what I 
saw was the end of my agency’s role as a leader in the communications strat­
egy. I thought about it from a strategic point of view, and I remember having 
a meeting with Foot Locker and saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, you’re giving 
the store away if you go along with this. Right now you are a branded house. 
People come to Foot Locker because it’s Foot Locker, and then within it, 
they ﬁnd the things they want.”
“It’s your expertise. It’s your sense of collection. It’s your sense of curation 
that makes this place what it is. If you just turn over the reins of control to 
all the different vendors, then you’re just going to be a house of brands. You’ll 
be like a department store, but a very small version of it, and all of your 
communications will be essentially run by outside companies.” I remember 
putting together a presentation on this and looking at the store displays at 
the lease line. I could see the store displays as a valuable property to be sold 
carefully, not as a property that simply kind of displayed everybody’s stuff 
and gave it equal weight. Malls were really huge at that point and where the 
majority of sales were.
I said, “Let’s treat the lease line, that last eighteen inches between the mall 
and interior of the store, as the most valuable thing in the world. Let’s 
make them pay for the privilege of being there, being featured and support 
us with more money, to help us drive sales, which is going to beneﬁt them 
and beneﬁt us. And therefore we remain a branded house.” We went out

to Nike—and I won’t mention all the names, but most of the founding elite 
were in that meeting. We presented this idea and got huge pushback on it.
Tuten: I’ll bet.
Fidoten: And I can tell you where most of those guys are today, but I won’t 
[laughter].
Tuten: [Laughter.]
Fidoten: We got huge pushback on it. Let me tell you, that was a long ﬂight 
back to New York. We weren’t deterred. We said, “Fine, let’s go to Reebok.” 
We ﬂew up to Boston the following week. At that time, Reebok had origi­
nally launched a shoe called the Pump, and it had not been successful for a 
number of reasons. They were about to relaunch it, and we got up there and 
said, “Let’s make this a Foot Locker launch, a Foot Locker exclusive launch. 
Let’s do this kind of program.” Reebok bought into it. We did a terriﬁc cam­
paign that launched the product at the Foot Locker stores.
There used to be a huge show—I don’t know if it still exists—called Super 
Show, where all of the sports and athletic guys would gather in Atlanta, and 
at that time, the head of Reebok was showing the launch to Wall Street as 
an example of the way they were going to do business moving forward. By 
the time we got over to the Nike booth and went into a conference room, 
the Nike people were ready to talk a very, very different story. We called this 
form of advertising “vendor supported marketing,” and I think that practice, 
that process, still exists to this day. I don’t know if it’s an inﬂection point in 
the industry, but certainly, it’s an example of where strategic thinking and 
adversity and the ability to realize what’s important both for your client and 
in a sense for your agency leads to really a breakthrough in thinking. The 
creative had to be great because, obviously, the best stuff being done in the 
world at that point was advertising for athletic products.
Every generation has its own product categories where there’s an oppor­
tunity to do great work, and Foot Locker was an opportunity to do great 
work, but it was also an opportunity to understand what the dynamics of 
the business were. We have a fundamental need to understand what are the 
drivers of the business. That, to me, is the world of strategy and the world of 
an account person. It’s really what the agency has to understand.
More than ever, you read stories today about how agencies should be in the 
business of helping their clients not just build their brands, but build their 
brands and build businesses. Now that may mean new business models. It may 
mean new ways of increasing revenue. It may mean understanding dynam­
ics that have nothing to do with what is considering traditional advertising,

whether it’s store design, whether it’s the layout of a hotel room, whether, 
you know, it’s the important aspects of travel that have nothing to do with 
typically getting you from point A to point B. I mean, all of these things are 
important, but fundamentally you must be in touch with the business.
When you’re not in touch with the business, you ﬁnd yourself a disposable 
commodity. This is a tough business and we often say, “We’re only as good as 
our last campaign.”
Tuten: Is there any way for the industry to change this view of the work?
Fidoten: It can be true, but I think it’s not true if you’re really fundamen­
tally partners and advisors to where the client business can go, what’s 
possible, and how you can help. I mean, we’re not supply chain experts 
here. We’re not sourcing experts. We don’t have a lot to do with basic 
R&D, but advertising has to do with a lot more than just the outer shell of 
communication.
If that’s all you do—advertising—then, honestly, you are only as good as your 
last spot. You shouldn’t just be judged with questions like, “Was that a great 
spot? Was that a great campaign?” More and more now, I think agencies are 
being judged and rewarded not just on paid fees and retainers and things, but 
also on performance.
As long as the measures are fair—because we don’t control a lot of things—
but as long as the measures are fair, it makes sense given the role that we 
play.
Tuten: Are you as involved in the client work now as you want to be?
Fidoten: No. As president, a lot of things that come to my desk aren’t 
directly involved with campaigns. I mean, it has to do with personnel issues 
and making sure we have the best people, keeping the people we do have 
happy, and all of the things that go on in the overall running the business. But 
what I try to do—I can’t say whether this is good or bad—but I try to stay 
involved in areas where I can be involved and areas where I can really add 
value. I just ﬁnished a nearly yearlong project, and I was in a lot of meet­
ings, very actively involved and very hands-on. I did it because I love it. I did 
it because it’s an area where I felt I could bring value and understanding 
because it was a complex assignment. I did it because I knew how important 
it was to the client in terms of their success. And I also did it because this is 
why I’m here. I mean, you know, without that kind of involvement, I think it’s 
very easy to lose touch with what we do.
On the other hand, I’m also reluctant because I know what this is like to be 
at the other end. I have a lot of good people here and I want to give them 

Chapter 8 |  Doug Fidoten: President, Dentsu America
122
room. I want them to have freedom to run businesses, control the work, and 
not feel like somebody’s micromanaging them. That’s one of the wonderful 
things about this business—that at a pretty young age you can be given a lot 
of autonomy.
That’s a good thing. I think it’s up to us to be guides, to be mentors, to make 
sure we’re helping and guiding and directing, but give people room. Give 
people room to grow, and give people room to take ownership, because 
that’s the only way they’re going to be passionate, and they’re not going to 
be passive because if somebody’s telling you what to do, you’re going to be 
passive. You’re going to do it because you were told to do it. But if some­
body’s giving you the room and saying, “This is where you’ve got to get to. 
Now you’ve got to ﬁgure out a lot. I’m going to help you, but you’ve got 
to ﬁgure out how to get there.” I think you take ownership—or the right 
people take ownership.
Tuten: Right.
Fidoten: Those are the kinds of people you want to have around you, but 
you also want to have people who know when to ask, when to get you 
involved, and, even when you don’t have to get involved. That’s the ideal. It 
doesn’t happen all the time, but on the ﬂip side, I think if I got too far away 
from the day-to-day or from things that were important to my clients, I 
think I’d lose touch and I’d lose value. I don’t think you can just become an 
administrator.
Look, there are people in very senior executive positions who have lots to 
do that doesn’t have to do with any particular client, but I think that even 
those people pick up the phone, call senior clients, talk about the business, 
talk about what’s going on, know what’s going on because that’s what clients 
care about and that’s what they’re paying for. And, the rest of it—frankly, the 
rest of it is overhead, and no one’s happy about that. No one’s happy about 
paying for overhead. They want to be paying for people who are paying 
attention to their business and helping make a difference.
This is true, what I’m about to tell you. Well, it may not be true in all busi­
nesses, but it is true in advertising. I’ve talked to a number of people and I 
think I have enough evidence that this is true. No matter how many steps 
you take from the ﬁrst time you’re sitting at a desk to years and years later, 
you don’t actually shed any job. You just collectively wrap them up. So, as an 
account person you begin as an assistant account executive. You’re schlep­
ping the bags around. You’re making sure the decks are ready. You’re doing 
copies for meetings. You’re making sure that the PowerPoint is working or 
Keynote is working, that the computers are going to work. You make sure

you’re not going to get there and ﬁnd out three cables are missing. Fast-
forward twenty years, and you’re an executive vice president and all the rest 
of it, and frankly, you’re worrying about the same stuff, all of that plus every­
thing else that comes with it.
Tuten: You have an ability to tell stories as though you had just experienced 
them. Did that come from your experiences in advertising?
Fidoten: It’s important. Frankly the entire notion of a campaign came out of 
storytelling. I know everyone thinks about brands and branding, but ulti­
mately, behind all of it, it’s storytelling.
Tuten: What if you were telling the story of your life? If you wrote an auto­
biography, what would it be called? 
Fidoten: I always say that if I wrote an autobiography, it’d be called “A Life 
in Advertising: Just Worry About It.” That clearly comes from my character. 
I do worry. That’s who I am. I get anxious about things. I worry. I consider 
it to be actually one of my greatest weapons in this business. I’m always 
concerned. I’m always thinking, what did we not think about? What did we 
not look for? What did we leave out? In this business, you can never take 
anything for granted. To take things for granted could be the worst thing that 
could befall a person in advertising.
It’s not an easy life to be a worrier. But I just read last week’s issue of Time 
magazine and the cover story was about how anxiety is actually good for 
you. Obviously, too much anxiety isn’t good for you, but a little bit of anxiety 
in this business is what drives us. I think we all talk about it as we get closer 
and closer to deadline, how we become more and more productive. And I 
just think there’s a lot of that in this business and a lot of need to really be 
thinking about what’s next, what’s wrong, what didn’t we think about, and 
not use it in a negative way, but use it as an energizing way as kind of keeping 
you focused and concerned about your clients’ business. I’ve often told my 
clients—and this is from long before there were cell phones—that I’m avail­
able 24/7. I mean it.
There are a couple of wonderful stories about that. I’ll tell one story, which 
kind of says something about balancing advertising and life. I was doing a 
commercial many years ago, and it involved a superstar baseball player. We 
had been struggling to connect with him and his agent to make sure that 
he would do the commercial. He was in a baseball all-star game that was 
taking place in San Diego, on the West Coast, and my client at the time was 
out there at the game and had told me, “I will track him down. I will ﬁnd 
him after the game. And I will get conﬁrmation that he’s actually coming.” I 
don’t know what time the baseball game ended on the West Coast, but it

was probably, New York time, three o’clock in the morning. The client goes 
running for the phone saying, “I’m going to call Doug. I’m going to let him 
know I talked to this guy and he said he’s going to do it.” And somebody says 
to him, “What? It’s three o’clock in the morning.” My client said, “No, no, no.” 
He said, “You don’t get it. Not only is Doug waiting for this call, but he’ll be 
thrilled if I wake him up and tell him because he’s been worrying about it all 
night.” And you know, sure enough, he calls me at three in the morning—and 
it was the best call I got. He was exactly right.
Tuten: It’s wonderful you are available 24/7 from a work perspective, but 
what does that do to your ability to maintain some balance between work 
and home life?
Fidoten: I’m very fortunate that I’m married to a woman, Beth, who has 
been in advertising almost as long as I have—maybe longer—not in account 
work, but largely on the media side. A media maven of her own, actually. 
She’s been named, “Woman of the Year in Advertising” and been nominated 
for a number of honors. Even “Mother of the Year in Advertising.” She’s really 
compiled her own wonderful record in the world of advertising. First of all, 
I’m probably more proud of her career than my own, but I think her work 
and understanding of the industry have always made my work possible. We 
both understand what we do.
If we didn’t understand, it would never work. We both did a lot of these 
crazy nights and long hours and weekends and for anyone who isn’t in the 
industry, after a point, this life is just really not understandable. We are in a 
service industry. That’s a part of it. The nature of advertising is just second 
nature to both of us. Obviously our love of the industry and shared pas­
sion has been a huge glue in our relationship. We have three kids too, which 
is kind of amazing when you consider our work schedules. When she was 
Mother of the Year, it was when our twins were, I think, probably all of three 
or four. Many people when they have children decide to move out of the city 
and commute in. But Beth insisted, absolutely insisted that we stay in the city. 
We live and work in Manhattan. Living here has made it possible for us to 
not only have a work life, [but] to be with our kids as they grow up. They are 
city kids and they have their own experiences, but they can see us and see 
our work and we can participate in their lives and still be part of this busi­
ness. I don’t think any of them will end up in advertising [laughter].
Believe me, I know many people who work crazy hard and their families are 
hours are way. I’m not saying it can’t be done. People do it. People do it well. 
I’m not saying everyone should live in Manhattan, because it comes with its 
own issues, but it has made our life possible.

Tuten: Is your wife still in advertising?
Fidoten: She was until very recently. Now she’s returning to school to 
become an art teacher. You always return to what you know and love, I 
guess. My mother was an artist and teacher. My wife and my father, too. After 
my father retired from his ﬁrst career, he ended up teaching communications 
at Slippery Rock, a school in western Pennsylvania. It was only after teach-
ing there in communications that he had an appreciation for what I actually 
did. Prior to that it was hard to explain. We often joke, what is it we do in 
advertising? Even after I’d been in advertising for years, he’d say—what is it 
that you do? Do you write the words? Do you take the pictures?
I’m not sure Mad Men has made it any clearer what it is that we do! 
[Laughter.] The only show that came close was Thirtysomething. My wife and 
I used to watch that and it was the most painful but funny thing because it 
was like reliving your day all over again. I don’t know if the show would reso-
nate now as it did then, but when we watched it, we’d say it was the closest 
thing to what our day was like. A far cry from Bewitched! Deﬁnitely a closer 
look at what the day-to-day experience is like [laughter].
Tuten: What’s still ahead for you?
Fidoten: I have many challenges in the business I’m in. We have a lot of 
things we want to do with the agency. There are things we can do in adver-
tising now that we never even dreamed of before. The tools we have have 
changed. The markets are changing. The market is fragmented. There are 
more challenges and we have to ﬁgure out how to take all of these tools, 
things, and marry them to what we know is true. We have to continue to be 
effective and continue to create work that we can proud of. This business 
continues to be exciting.
I have a lot more I want to do in mentoring others and sharing successes. 
There are so many people involved in everything we accomplish. These 
people are like a cast of characters. We have stars, we have people with 
charisma, people who are on the front lines, people who have to carry the 
heavy load. In our case, it may be two to three weeks that we give these 
people to bring a campaign together. There is a great deal of pride when 
we are able to come together and create something wonderful. We can feel 
enormous pride about a campaign that we worked well on and know when 
we accomplished what we set out to do. We share the success as a team. 
As a group. That’s what it’s about. Whether you are in a big organization 
with thousands of people or a small group of ﬁve that just started up as an 
agency, sharing what’s produced together is what brings an agency to great-
ness or pulls an agency down to where it vanishes overnight.

I may want to ﬁnd more time to teach, too. I love to teach. I’ve been teaching 
on and off as opportunities have arisen. I’ve lectured for Dentsu all around 
the world in Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore. I love that. There is such an energy 
to thinking about what’s important, sharing it with people, and getting them 
energized about it. It’s just like a client presentation. You are sharing with a 
group what they should be excited about. I enjoy teaching just like I enjoy 
making a client presentation. So far there hasn’t been much time for this, but 
I hope it happens more in the future.
I’ll tell a ﬁnal story. A very close friend of mine whom I’ve known since I ﬁrst 
came to New York got me an amazing birthday gift. He’s an inspiring teacher 
in his own right. He spent his own life teaching kindergarten because he 
believes that’s where the foundation of education begins. He knows of my 
passion for photography and that other than taking pictures of my kids, my 
photography has taken a backseat to my career.
It was one of my cornerstone birthdays and there was a seminal exhibit of 
Richard Avedon’s work at the museum. Avedon was an amazing photogra­
pher, known for his work in fashion, portraits—such a gifted photographer. 
Anyway, my friend went to the exhibit and then to the bookstore to get 
this book for me as a gift for my birthday. He got there just at the close of 
the museum, bought the book, and sat down on the great stairwell in the 
museum. As he was sitting there on the staircase, Richard Avedon comes 
down the stairs! My friend stood and explained that he had just bought this 
book for me and he’d so appreciate it if Avedon would include an inscription. 
He told Avedon of my great love and talent in photography, but that my life 
and career had taken a different direction.
When my friend brings me the book, I open it up and inside, Avedon had 
written, “Doug, it’s never too late to begin. Richard Avedon.” And, you know, 
you just have to say to yourself—that it’s true of everything.
Here, I have a terriﬁc career in advertising. I have great relationships. I have 
been a part of wonderful campaigns that have made a difference for clients 
and made a difference in their businesses. But you have to keep looking at 
your life like that: it’s never too late to begin, whatever our talents are, what­
ever our motivation is. And, you know, to get something from somebody like 
that—someone who is at the pinnacle of his life and talent, it’s nothing short 
of inspiring. Avedon died fairly shortly thereafter.
Tuten: Are there other famous people who’ve made a difference in how 
you view your life?
Fidoten: It’s tough to top the impact of Richard Avedon’s message other 
than to say that recently I met Martin Scorsese. I’ve met celebrities. I’ve met

athletes—scores of athletes. Very accomplished people from all walks of life. 
But recently I’ve had a couple of opportunities to meet Marty Scorsese for 
a project we were involved in. He’s on the cover now of Wired. There’s actu­
ally a story in there deﬁnitely worth reading, a story about creativity and 
maintaining creative spirit.2
Scorsese is nearing seventy. What I found remarkable about talking to him 
was the passion and intellectual curiosity that he has still about every­
thing— about his phenomenal knowledge of ﬁlm, about the way he could 
bring up one thing after the other, about the way he made references to the 
cave paintings of Lascaux, the single-point perspective of the Renaissance, 
the panels of paintings that were done pre–Renaissance. I mean, he has this 
sense of the world in which he works, what’s important about that world, 
and all of the aspects of the world. That’s what keeps him current and cre­
ative. And I say the same thing about our business of advertising. You know, 
it’s about knowing your craft, knowing the history in a way that’s important 
to what we do today because it does matter, and then understanding that 
there’s always going to be a new challenge. We can learn a lot from Martin 
Scorsese. Here’s a man at nearly the age of seventy who tackled his ﬁrst 
children’s ﬁlm, his ﬁrst 3D feature [Hugo], and a lot of other new creative 
work with the same passion and intensity that he tackled his student work 
at NYU.
In some ways, meeting and getting to know Scorsese represents another 
one of those series of connected points in my journey. A lot of my personal 
attraction to New York and my love of the city ﬁrst started with his ﬁlms. 
From that story I told you about the Staten Island ferry to right now, meet­
ing him connects more points on my path. I’m still here, living up on the 
Upper West Side, and he’s still here somewhere in Manhattan. I don’t know 
exactly where, but he doesn’t live in Hollywood. He lives here.
Tuten: How does knowing someone like Scorsese shape your own plans 
for the future? What’s ahead for you?
Fidoten: I want to be able to do the same thing, but in my own ﬁeld. I want 
to be able to tackle the next campaign, the next thing I do with the same 
passion and freshness that I had when I ﬁrst came in. I want to keep the 
same curiosity and interest I had when I was trying to ﬁgure out how to 
move my ﬁrst mechanical around the agency and get it out the door.

And not just passion—also with the same bit of self-doubt. A little bit of 
“I’m not sure.” A reminder to me that I will never have it all ﬁgured out. 
Not that I ever do feel that way! And I know others don’t. Sometimes you 
do wish that you could have it all ﬁgured out. But it’s better to be on the 
problem-solving side. We should be always learning and always doing more 
with something than we thought we could before. We need more seminal 
experiences.

Creative Director 
BooneOakley
David Oakley is president, and creative director at BooneOakley 
(booneoakley.com), the agency he co-founded with partner John Boone. 
The agency, based in Charlotte, NC, has done well since its inception in 2000. 
In a relatively short period of time, the agency has brought home a Webby, 
a Cannes Gold Lion, and multiple Clio and Addy awards. Under David’s 
leadership, BooneOakley has been named an Advertising Age 
“Southeast Small Agency of the Year,” and David and John were 
named a “Hot Creative Team” by Creativity magazine. The agency 
web site was honored in the Google Creative Canvas for 2010.
David started his advertising career as a copywriter at Young & Rubicam in 
New York, where he crafted campaigns for major brands including Certs, Dr. 
Pepper, and AT&T. From there, he went to TBWA/Chiat/Day to help develop the 
Absolut Vodka campaign—voted one of Ad Age’s “Top Twenty Ad Campaigns 
of the Twentieth Century.” After seven years in the Big Apple, David followed his 
Carolina roots to super-regional agency, Price McNabb, where he worked on sev­
eral award-winning campaigns. In 1997, David and John Boone opened a satel­
lite ofﬁce of The Martin Agency in Charlotte. There, David served as associate 
creative director for Wrangler, Alltel, Kellogg’s, Saan, and the Charlotte Hornets.
David Oakley: I’m telling you, blunders happen to us. That happens a

something about the AV equipment doesn’t work or—I don’t know. It’s just 
been our history. It happens, so I just kind of laugh because it happened to 
somebody else.1
Tracy Tuten: BooneOakley has the Bojangles account. How is everything at 
Bojangles?
Oakley: It’s really interesting. Bojangles is doing a lot of interesting con­
sumer research right now. We are in the process of learning more about the 
customer base, which is always a good thing. A lot of the work that we’re 
going to be doing in the coming months is going to be based on the ﬁndings.
Tuten: Who’s doing the research?
Oakley: It’s a company called Bain and Company. I think the research ﬁrm 
is based out of Massachusetts. Bojangles actually was purchased last summer 
by a holding company called Advent and the holding company, fortunately, is 
willing to do some spending for good consumer data, which is a good thing. 
It’s something that we really wanted to do before, but Bojangles never had 
the budgets to do it.
Tuten: Interesting. I had Bojangles this morning for breakfast.
Oakley: Really? You did not.
Tuten: I did. Seriously!
Oakley: What did you have?
Tuten: I had a chicken biscuit.
Oakley: A Cajun ﬁllet biscuit? Very good, very good. I’m very impressed.
Tuten: I thought about you while I was going through the drive-through. I 
said, “David would be so pleased to know that we have this interview today 
and I’m here frequenting his client.”
Oakley: It’s Bo time! [The tag line for Bojangles’ campaign.] You were prob­
ably going through the drive-through while I was sitting at corporate head­
quarters. Actually, it’s not known as a corporate headquarters. It’s known 
as the support center, right? That’s what it’s called. It’s not called corporate 
headquarters. It’s called support center because they’re there to support all 
of the individual franchises and owners.
1 David Oakley here is referring to the fact that I did an initial interview and on the 
“save,” my computer crashed and I lost it all. I had to ask him to do the whole thing 
again. He graciously agreed.

Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
­wanting to work in this ﬁeld?
Oakley: Both of my parents were potters, which was great. It was a really 
creative background to have. I actually didn’t realize until I got in college 
that I’d had a very unusual upbringing, being the son of two craftspeople. It 
was really a great childhood. We traveled to craft shows up and down the 
Eastern seaboard when I was a kid. We would go to Florida or we’d go to 
Virginia Beach and we’d show our wares. But it was also a lot of work and 
growing up that way taught me that while I wanted to do something creative 
in my career, I did not want to be a craftsperson. I really didn’t want to be a 
potter. I saw my dad and my mom, and they always had mud all over them. 
They had clay all over them, you know, just from making pots. It’s a really 
hard business being a potter, and they worked really hard. I wanted to ﬁnd 
a way to be creative and not be dirty all the time. That sounds like a really 
weird thing because I’m not exactly the cleanest person around, you know? 
I take a shower once every couple of months [laughter].
Tuten: Are your parents still living?
Oakley: My mom is still living. My dad passed away seven years ago, but the 
business that they started out in Creedmoor, North Carolina, which is north 
of Raleigh, is still going strong. My sister runs the business now. My sister is a 
glass blower. She has a great, glass-blowing business there, and there are still 
four potters who make pottery at the Cedar Creek facilities. It’s awesome. 
The business my parents started is forty-four years old now, and just this 
year it was recognized by the Department of Transportation, or the Highway 
System, or whoever does the tourism signage. Now, there are signs on the 
highway that say “Attraction: Cedar Creek Gallery and Pottery.” So it’s kind 
of like a state treasure now.
Tuten: That’s fantastic.
Oakley: Yeah, it’s really cool, I’m really proud to be a part of it. And that was 
a great place to be from.
Tuten: Does BooneOakley do the advertising for the gallery?
Oakley: We have done ads for them, yes, in the past. But, you know, they’re 
just a little too small for us. You know, they don’t have the budgets that we 
want [laughter]. No, I’m just kidding. We do everything—we do a lot of stuff 
for them for free actually. It’s my sister. We talk about ads and marketing all 
the time.
Tuten: Is your mom surprised how you turned out? At how you ended up 
using your creativity?

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley
132
Oakley: Yes, she actually thought I’d be successful instead [laughter]. Instead, 
this happened. This ad thing happened. No, she’s really psyched. She’s really 
proud of me. Like any mom. I’m kind of embarrassed by that question, but 
the answer is yes, she’s very proud, of course.
Tuten: It just occurred to me when you were talking about growing up, for 
her to be a potter and to see how you channeled creativity in a different 
way. It must be a source of pride for her.
Oakley: At the beginning though, things were different. I have to be honest. 
When I was ﬁnishing school at Chapel Hill, I really thought that I would go 
back to Cedar Creek and run the Cedar Creek Gallery. I thought that would 
be my work. And even though I wanted a different creative route, I thought 
that I would probably become a potter, too. Even though that’s not really 
what I wanted to do. The hardest thing I ever did was really decide to leave 
that opportunity, that sure thing, and go out on my own and ﬁgure out a dif­
ferent way for myself. I just needed to do something. My parents were very 
supportive of me moving to New York and going and getting my ﬁrst job in 
advertising. They thought that was really cool. But, still, it was a big decision.
Tuten: Did you go to college to study advertising? How did you discover 
advertising as your creative ﬁeld?
Oakley: No, I didn’t plan to study advertising. I really went to college pretty 
much to meet girls [laughter]. I went to North Carolina because I heard that 
it was like sixty-three percent women. No, I went to North Carolina and I 
really went there because they had a good basketball team. That’s really why 
I went there. And because I was able to get in. I loved my time at Carolina. I 
took a lot of business courses. I was a business major.
See, it’s like this. When sons and daughters of bankers go to school and they 
rebel, they go into the arts. When the son of an artist goes to school, they 
rebel by going into business. I was kind of like that at college. I really wasn’t 
a great student. I was an okay student. I was really more into the whole col­
lege experience than I was into learning. When I was about to graduate, I 
was over at a girlfriend’s house on a Sunday afternoon, and I was doing my 
economics homework, and she was doodling or drawing these little drawings 
of—they looked like stick ﬁgures. She couldn’t draw for anything. But I asked, 
“What are you doing?”
She says, “I’m drawing the Pillsbury Doughboy.”
I’m like, “Why?”
She said, “I’m writing headlines for Advertising 170.”

Advertisers at Work
133
I’m like, “Wait a minute. You get college credit for doing that? That’s so easy. 
Anyone could do that.”
She said, “It’s not so easy.” Blah, blah, blah.
I said, “Well, wait a minute.” It never occurred to me that people could 
make a living, you know, doing print ads or writing commercials. It never, 
ever occurred to me that people actually did that for a living. So she told me 
about a professor, and his name was John Sweeney. She said, “He’s awesome. 
He worked at an agency for seven years and he’s been a professor here for 
four, and you really should go talk with him if you’re really interested in this.”
I was the kind of student [for whom] it was really unusual to go to class, 
let alone to go talk to a professor. That was beyond my capabilities. I mean, 
seriously, it was like a big deal to go see a professor at random and say, “I 
want to take your class.”
I went to his class. I went to see him the next morning. I introduced myself. 
He said, “Well, great. What year are you, freshman, sophomore?”
I’m like, “No, I’m a senior.”
He goes, “Oh, so you’re graduating in two months?”
I said, “Yeah.”
He said, “Well, I suggest you probably go and get a job, you know? That’s 
probably what you should do.”
I’m like, “Well, yeah, I want to do that, but I want to get a job in advertising. 
That’s what I want to do. It just hit me yesterday. This is it.”
John Sweeney said, “Well, there are a lot of people graduating every year, and 
it’s a really hard ﬁeld to get into, and you probably should just get a job in 
whatever—what’s your major, David?”
And I said, “Industrial relations.” 
And he says, “I think you should get a job in whatever kind of job, whatever 
kind of career you go into with an industrial relations business major.”
And I’m like, “Okay, well, I’m not sure, but I know that I want a job in 
advertising.”
Anyway, basically, he said that his class was full and I was really bummed. 
I graduated and then that summer I saw that he had another class. He 
was teaching a summer school class, so I went back to him. And I said, “Hi, 
Professor Sweeney. Do you remember me?”
And he says, “Yeah.” He kind of remembered me.

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley
134
I said, “I’m David Oakley.”
He said, “You graduated, didn’t you? Didn’t you graduate?”
I said, “Yeah, I did, but I’m still here in Chapel Hill.”
And he asks, “Why?”
I said, “Continuing education. I just hadn’t left Chapel Hill. So I really want to 
take your class.”
He said, “No, you can’t take my class. It’s full, and there’s a ﬁfteen-person 
waiting list to get in it.”
And I don’t know what made me say this to Sweeney, but I said, “I know 
you’re like the most popular professor in the advertising track. I know you’ve 
won Professor of the Year for the last three years, but I also know college 
students, and I guarantee you that every single one of your classes, at least 
one other person will skip, and when that person skips your class, I’m going 
to be in that seat.” And he just looked at me like I was crazy. I said, “I will be 
in that seat.” And I walked away.
So I went to his class the ﬁrst day, and it was literally packed with people. 
Then somebody got up and left, and I sat down in the seat. I went every 
single day. Every day there were open seats, so I just kept going even though 
I wasn’t enrolled in his class. Eventually it came time for the mid-term exam 
and I came ready to take the exam as though I was actually enrolled in the 
class. Professor Sweeney must have been thinking, “This guy’s a psycho.” 
[Laughter].
Up until that point, four weeks into the class, he had barely acknowledged 
me. But that day he came up to me, looked at me and he just threw a copy 
of the test on my desk, and he said, “Okay, you’re in.” That was that. He 
ofﬁcially added me into the class. I ended up staying at Chapel Hill another 
year and a half and working as a waiter and oyster shucker. During that time, 
I took three more classes with Sweeney. He helped me put my portfolio 
together, and to make a really long story short, I took my beginning advertis­
ing portfolio, and I moved to New York.
Sweeney introduced me to some people in New York, and I kind of net­
worked my way around and ended up getting my ﬁrst job at Young & 
Rubicam. Twenty-ﬁve years later, Sweeney is still a really good friend of 
mine, and he’s been my mentor since the beginning. He is a great professor. 
But you know what? He really wanted me to prove to him that I wanted a 
career in advertising. Once I showed him that I really wanted it and I was 
committed, he was like, “Okay, we’ll go. You’ll get it.” So that’s how I started.

Advertisers at Work
135
Tuten: You are exactly the kind of success story from students that keeps 
professors going, keeps us teaching every day. There are plenty of those 
other ones who—well, like you were before you met him.
Oakley: Just going through the motions, going through the bars, hanging 
out, coming into class hung over. Something clicked when I realized that I 
really wanted to do advertising. It was a crazy decision, and, it’s been a crazy 
career, and it’s still young. I still feel really young, and I can’t believe that was 
like twenty-ﬁve years ago. It feels like it’s gone by in twenty-ﬁve minutes, and 
I guess that’s because I was having a good time.
Tuten: What was your ﬁrst job at Young & Rubicam?
Oakley: My ﬁrst job was as a copy cub. Basically, it was a junior copywriter 
position. They called copy trainees copy cubs. I was hired with four other 
junior writers from around the country. They hired a guy from Winthrop 
University whose portfolio basically consisted of poetry that he had writ-
ten. They hired a guy from University of Illinois. They hired a woman from 
University of Missouri. We all started together. It was like this melting pot 
of different people. We all became friends because we started together and 
we went through this six-week copy-training program. Through this training 
program we were introduced into what a big ad agency was all about. After 
training, we were split up. We were all put into different groups.
Of course, we were the low person on the totem pole in our respective 
creative departments. When I was there at Young & Rubicam—this is around 
1987—there were fourteen hundred people in the ofﬁce. It was crazy. It 
was almost like going to a small college inside this giant ad agency. It was just 
ridiculous how many people were there.
Tuten: What kinds of campaigns did you work on there?
Oakley: Let’s see. I did a really fun print campaign for Certs breath mints. It 
was the ﬁrst time they’d ever done a sugar-free version of Certs, and it was 
interesting because it was such a big agency, and everybody wanted to do TV. 
So people really didn’t care about the campaign. The more seasoned creative 
types didn’t really care about doing print advertising at the time. Y&R was 
known then as a TV shop, so I couldn’t believe that one of my ﬁrst assign-
ments was to do a full-color magazine advertisement for Certs. I ended up 
getting lucky. I was assigned to work with an older art director.
I was like twenty-four and my art director was sixty-two. This art direc-
tor actually drew his comps with a paintbrush, and watercolor, and paint-
brushes. He didn’t use markers. He didn’t use a computer. He drew all of 
his comps with a paintbrush, which was like crazy. I couldn’t believe it, and

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley
136
I really kick myself because I don’t have any of his comps. I wish I had saved 
them. At the time, he would do them and throw them away. But, anyway, we 
did a campaign for Certs that ended up winning all these awards. It won at 
the One Show and it won Clios. The funny thing was that this Certs cam­
paign was the only thing that won awards out of the entire New York ofﬁce. 
I was still pretty new at Y&R and it was just kind of ironic that this little 
print campaign that no one wanted to do ended up winning the only awards 
of the year.
Tony Carillo was the art director. While we worked, he would sit there 
and tell me stories about his daughter. He would talk about his tennis-
playing daughter, who was this great tennis player. He’d say, “Yeah, she’s from 
Flushing, she’s from Queens. You know, she was junior partners with this kid. 
You probably know him, John McEnroe.” So he’s telling me about going and 
hanging out with McEnroe and I’m like, “What’s your daughter’s name?” And 
he says, “Oh, Mary, Mary Carillo.” So the tennis announcer that you see now, 
Mary Carillo, is his daughter.
So Mary Carillo was John McEnroe’s mixed doubles partner, and they won 
the US Open together. It was like, holy shit! Y&R was a very, very amazing 
place to work actually. It was like a school. It exposed you to so much.
Tuten: What’s the most important thing that you learned while you were 
working there?
Oakley: The most important thing that happened to me is that I met my 
wife, Claire while I was at Y&R. She was an accounts person. I fell in love with 
her, we got married, and we celebrated twenty-one years last week.
Tuten: Congratulations.
Oakley: Well, thank you very much. Thank you. What was the most impor­
tant thing I learned? I kind of knew this from my parents, but it was reiter­
ated at Y&R. The lesson is to always to believe in yourself and keep your eye 
on the prize. Y&R was my ﬁrst step into advertising. It was really cool and I 
learned a lot, but there were also times that I didn’t like what I was produc­
ing. The Certs campaign was really one of the few things that I produced 
there that I really liked.
Y&R was a bureaucracy, and I really learned to keep my eye on the prize 
because I wanted to do the type of work that some of the other agencies in 
town were doing at the time, like Chiat/Day or Scali, McCabe, Sloves. They 
were doing unbelievable work. I was also keeping my eye on a couple of the 
agencies in North Carolina, one was McKinney, and LKM—Loefﬂer Ketchum 
Mountjoy—in Charlotte at the time, and also The Martin Agency, which was 
doing great work. I just really watched other agencies, and I knew that I 

Advertisers at Work
137
wanted to work at a smaller agency. But Y&R was the best place you could 
ever start a career. I’ll put it to you this way. It got me in, got my foot in the 
door. It was my ﬁrst job, and a lot of great things came from it. I can sit here 
for hours and tell you Y&R stories, but if you really want to know all of the 
good ones, you have to buy the book.
Tuten: Your book?
Oakley: Exactly. Whenever it’s ready in 2028.
Tuten: I’ll be your ﬁrst sale. Tell me about this bureaucracy issue at Y&R.
Oakley: When you’re a junior writer, there are just so many levels to work 
through to get your ideas approved. You have to be very guarded with an 
idea. When you come up with a good idea, it’s almost like it’s your baby, and 
you have to shepherd it through. You don’t want these different cooks to 
come in and put different things into it. Sometimes you’ll have a creative 
director or a supervisor that can add things and make it better. There are 
some who are gifted at that. But there are also a lot of people who aren’t so 
gifted at that, and sometimes what they add to an idea, well, it’s like they just 
want to put their ﬁngerprint on your idea to put their ﬁngerprint on it.
So when you’re a junior writer, you have to go through the senior writer, and 
then you go through the associate creative director, and then you go through 
the group creative director, and then you ﬁnally get it to the executive cre­
ative director before it goes out to the client. An idea has to go through like 
ﬁve levels before it actually gets to see the light of day. It’s very, very hard to 
get it through all these levels. It’s much easier to do great work by having an 
idea, working through a creative director, and then going to the client. The 
bureaucracy of it all was frustrating. It was frustrating to have such a long, 
difﬁcult road to work with ideas.
Tuten: So you said that Chiat and The Martin Agency were doing the kind 
of great work you wanted to do while you were at Y&R. What kinds of 
things were they doing? What was different at those agencies than Y&R?
Oakley: Chiat/Day had done a campaign for NYNEX, which was the tele­
phone system in town at the time, and it was a print campaign, and it was all 
over the subways. I’m completely blanking on exactly what the executions 
were right now, but I was in love with this campaign! I was like, “This is the 
best thing that I’ve ever seen.” And then there was a great campaign for 
Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse that I thought was written brilliantly. The 
work appealed to me in a different way. Y&R was more akin to formulated 
packaged goods stuff. Y&R did ads for Efferdent and Rolaids. I worked on the 
Rolaids account. I met Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers’ manager, and I did radio 
spots with him, and I met Rollie Massimino, the Villanova head coach, and did

radio spots with him. The work was fantastic and fun, but the creative was 
just kind of formulaic. It just wasn’t really anything breakthrough. It wasn’t 
what I wanted to do.
Tuten: Was this the “Rolaids: How do you spell relief?” campaign?
Oakley: Yes [laughter]. Yes, I worked on that campaign.
Tuten: I still use that campaign as an example in class. To point out the value 
in repetition.
Oakley: When I was there, they started giving out the Rolaids Reliever of 
the Year award for the best relief pitcher in baseball. I did a print campaign 
for that. It was good. When I look back on it, Y&R was pretty awesome, and I 
met friends, not only Claire, but friends that I’ve had for life. People who are 
still in my life today. Y&R was kind of like this mini-graduate school that I was 
in, and I was there for three and a half years.
Tuten: And then what happened?
Oakley: There were a lot of changes going on during that time at Y&R. A 
new group of creative directors came in. I saw people get laid off at Y&R, 
old people who had been there forever. People who had been there during 
the “mad men” days, you know, and I’m there in the late eighties and people 
who had been there for like thirty years get laid off. A new guy would come 
in and just lay everyone off. They didn’t lay me off because I wasn’t making 
enough money to save them any money, I guess. But what was your ques­
tion? Why did I leave?
Well, I had been working to make my portfolio better and I got an oppor­
tunity to go to TBWA. This was right before they merged with Chiat/Day. 
TBWA was right across the street from Y&R. I literally just walked across 
Madison Avenue and started a new job. I got to work with some incred­
ible people there. I worked on the Absolut Vodka campaign. It was about 
two years or three years after the campaign had just started. I got to 
come in. I was lucky. I was still really junior. I had only been in the business 
for three years. It was just incredible. I was at TBWA/Chiat/Day for four 
years.
Tuten: Is the Absolut Vodka campaign the only one that you worked on 
there?
Oakley: No. Absolut was an interesting thing because it was a print cam­
paign that really became iconic, if you really think about it. Imagine if you said 
to a creative team, “Hey, here’s what I want you to do. I want you to put the 
product really big in the middle of the page. I want the product to take up 

Advertisers at Work
139
the whole page. I want the name of the product to be in like 2-inch type at 
the bottom, and I want there to be one other word on the page. That’s your 
assignment.” The creative team would vomit! Seriously, we would vomit. That 
would have been like the worst assignment you could ever have. I mean, it’s 
terrible. But that’s exactly what that campaign is based on.
Geoff Hayes was the originator of the campaign. He actually saw the genius 
in the package design of Absolut Vodka. The taste of Absolut vodka is no 
better than any other vodka. It’s the same stuff, basically. I mean, if you put 
out ﬁve glasses, I could never tell you which one was Absolut—even then, 
even when I was working on it! What Absolut had was an amazing package. I 
think Absolut was the ﬁrst to actually spray the type and label on the bottle 
instead of using a paper label. Spraying the label made the brand seem so 
much more classy, chic, cool. It really made the brand seem more high-end. I 
thought that was pretty amazing.
What Geoff Hayes was able to recognize is that they should really make the 
package the king. The bottle should be king. He had this idea to feature the 
bottle and make the package the hero. Geoff looked at it and said, “This bot­
tle is perfect. This is perfect.” And then he just wrote, “Absolut Perfection” 
and put a little halo over the bottle, and that’s how the campaign was born. 
It was just one execution, and the legs on this campaign were unbelievable. It 
went on for ﬁfteen or twenty years. I think they’ve changed it now, but it did 
go on for a long time.
Tuten: So what’s your favorite one?
Oakley: My favorite one is an evolution that happened right as I was get­
ting to TBWA. A team named David Warren and Tom McManus worked 
on a campaign. They had the insight to branch the campaign out and do a 
city campaign. Michael Roux was the head of Absolut and he wanted to do 
something that recognized certain cities. Roux said something like, “I’d love 
to do something that we could run in Chicago magazine or New York maga­
zine that would be speciﬁc to that town.” David and Tom took Michael’s 
request and came back with this idea that a city icon could be reﬂected as 
the bottle. What if you took an overhead shot of a swimming pool and made 
a swimming pool look like a vodka bottle, an Absolut bottle? They named it 
“Absolut LA.”
In that same meeting, they brought in an overhead shot of Central Park that 
they had altered to look like the bottle, and it said, “Absolut New York.” And 
it was just like, “Holy shit. That is like unbelievable, but it doesn’t have the 
bottle, so we’re not going to be able to do that.” I mean, they clawed and 
clawed, and I have to give them major credit for being persistent, but they 

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley

were able to get that to Michael Roux. I think that he was skeptical at ﬁrst, 
but he decided to go for it. Roux bought those two ads. They would run 
speciﬁcally only in New York and Los Angeles, and they got Steve Bronstein 
to shoot them. They had models made for the shoots.
There must have been rocket fuel added to that campaign because when 
those two ads hit the market, that’s when people started tearing them out 
of magazines and collecting them. From that point on, it just opened up this 
whole thing. I was lucky to work with those guys because they kind of took 
me under their wing and invited me to really help them come up with more 
ideas for the campaign. They’d say, “Okay, Oakley. Help us think some more.” 
That’s how, as a young writer, I got to work on an iconic campaign. I did the 
Absolut Boston ad, which was the parquet ﬂoor of the Boston Garden. I’m 
such a big basketball fan. I really wanted to do Absolut Chapel Hill, but, you 
know, we decided to do it for Boston [laughter]. We did Absolut Louisville 
and Absolut Seattle and Absolut St. Louis. We did these city ads all over the 
place. There were some ads that never made it.
Tuten: Do you have a favorite ad that was never produced?
Oakley: There was one that didn’t make it, which I think would have been 
one of the best of all time. It had a political leaning to it, and this was in 
1992. It was the political season of 1992. It was a spread and the ad had the 
Absolut bottle way on the left side of the page and it said, “Absolut Liberal,” 
and the other side of the spread had the bottle on the right side, and it 
said, “Absolut Conservative.” It was left-right. It was one quick visual pun. 
Everybody at the agency loved it. We were like, “This is going to be the best 
one we’ve ever done, blah, blah, blah, blah.” We presented it to Michael Roux, 
and he was just like, “No, no, no, no. I do not get involved in politics. No poli­
tics, no politics.” And we were like, “But you’re appealing to everyone now. 
You’re saying it doesn’t matter your political afﬁliations. This is the vodka for 
you.” He wouldn’t do it. Four years later, in 1996, they took that ad back out 
to those guys because Absolut under new leadership, and they tried to sell 
it, and the same thing happened. They could not sell that ad. So anyway, that 
one didn’t happen.
Tuten: That’s a great idea. I love it.
Oakley: Well, thanks. That was a good one. There are a lot of ads that never 
made it, never saw the light of day. Oh well.
Tuten: Is it heartbreaking?
Oakley: It is, especially when you’re starting off in your career because 
you put so much heart and soul into coming up with an idea and the ideas

can get killed for so many odd reasons. The stereotypical reason is like, 
the client’s wife didn’t like it. That sounds so lame, but it’s happened. It’s 
happened.
Tuten: So how do you deal with it?
Oakley: With one that doesn’t make it? For every ad that’s made it through 
the pipe, there are ten that don’t make it through, you know? It’s kind of like 
sperm, I guess. God, I don’t know why I said that! [Laughter.]
Have you ever heard the saying, “The one that makes it through is a good 
one”? It makes me think of Luke Sullivan, and I think you said you were 
interviewing Luke Sullivan, right?
Tuten: Yes, I did.
Oakley: Okay. His book, Hey Whipple, Squeeze This,2 was a huge, huge 
inﬂuence on me. There is a principle in that book that I will never forget and 
I tell people all the time. It is just a simple thing: “outlast the idiots.” Meaning 
if someone kills your ad, go back to the drawing board and come back with 
a better one—and if they kill that one, go back again, suck it up, and come 
back with a better one because eventually there’s going to be a deadline, and 
they’re going to have to buy it. So if you give in and just say, “Oh, screw it. 
Here, take this. Is that what you want?” then you’re going to have to produce 
that ad. It takes just as long to produce a bad ad as it does to produce a 
good ad. So you should really outlast the idiots, and eventually, the deadline 
will happen, and you’ll have to produce something really good. Anyway, thank 
you, Luke.
Tuten: I bet he’ll be happy to see that you learned such valuable lessons 
from his book.
Oakley: He’s a great guy. He’s been a huge inﬂuence on not only me, but a 
whole generation of writers, really. You know what, I wrote a blog post a few 
months ago, and it was entitled “Luke Sullivan’s Mistake.”3 It was really funny 
because I put it out there knowing he would end up seeing it somehow. 
Someone would forward it to him.
In the original printing of Hey Whipple, Squeeze This, there’s a picture of 
Absolut Magnetism, which was an ad I did. I had heard that ad was going to 
be in the book and that meant I would be mentioned in the book. I was so

psyched. I was like, “Wow! Luke Sullivan’s writing a book,” you know, because 
he was winning every award you can imagine at this time in advertising. He 
was like a god, and here he’s writing a book about it, about how he does it.
Someone said to me, “Hey, your ad is in there. Oakley’s ‘Magnetism’ is in 
there.” So I run out to the bookstore to buy the book. I get it. I’m ﬂipping 
through the book to ﬁnd the ad. I ﬁnd it on page twenty or whatever page 
it’s on, and there it is. I’m like, “Oh my God. It’s here.” I ﬂip immediately back 
to the credits to see if my name is in it. It lists me as the art director. And 
I’m like, “Fuck! I’m a copywriter. This is the greatest copywriter ever, Luke 
Sullivan, and he thinks I’m an art director. He thinks I’m an art director!”
He got it backwards—my art director was listed as the copywriter. So I 
wrote this whole thing about he made this big mistake in his ﬁrst book. 
But anyway, you have to read it. He was really nice about it. He wrote me 
like three e-mails, saying, “Oh my God. I cannot believe I never knew that, 
you know?” He says, “I’m changing it in the new edition. I will make sure it’s 
right.” I’m like, “No, it’s really funny. I’d rather be known as the art director. 
The art directors did more on that campaign than any copywriter ever did.”
Tuten: The new edition is supposed to be a complete new edition to incor­
porate social media and digital.
Oakley: Oh good. Well, he doesn’t, he doesn’t know anything about that 
[laughter].
Tuten: Should I let him know so he can stop work on the book?
Oakley: Yeah, deﬁnitely stop him.
Tuten: So it sounds like you had a great experience at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
Oakley: Oh, I did. Claire and I got married during this time. And after three 
years of being married, we had our ﬁrst kid, Sydney. We had a little tiny 
apartment and after about six months, we decided that we were either going 
to move to New Jersey or we were going to move really out of Manhattan. 
I got an offer to come down to Charlotte, and I really had only been to 
Charlotte a couple of times. We moved here. We just up and moved. I didn’t 
realize what a traumatic experience that was going to be—moving with a 
little baby to a place like Charlotte in the mid-1990s from New York City. 
Even though I’m from North Carolina, it was a huge culture shock to me. 
For Claire, who had spent her whole life in New York, it was like, “Holy moly, 
where have you brought me?” It was very different. Looking back on it, it 
was the best thing we could have ever done, but at ﬁrst living here was an 
interesting experience. Anyway, I’m getting off track.

Advertisers at Work
143
Tuten: Who did you work for when you ﬁrst came to Charlotte?
Oakley: I worked for an agency called Price McNabb. It was founded by 
Charlie Price, who’s from North Carolina, and at the time I think he had an 
ofﬁce in Raleigh, Columbia, Asheville, and Charlotte. And I met John Boone 
there, and we started working together. I spent about two and a half years at 
Price McNabb. I loved that it was small and the layers of bureaucracy weren’t 
there. It was just one creative director. We got a lot of great work done in 
the time that I was there, a lot of good stuff produced.
I got an opportunity after that to go to The Martin Agency. I got a call from 
Mike Hughes, who was the creative director at The Martin Agency. This was 
like getting a call from God. I mean, Martin was just, was it. Luke Sullivan 
worked at Martin for a long time. I mean, it was, “Wow. Mike Hughes has 
noticed my work and he’s interested in it,” you know? I got the job offer to 
move to Martin in Richmond, but I turned it down. Isn’t that crazy? Claire 
was expecting our second baby. We were expecting Lucas. So I talked 
to Mike Hughes and said, “You know what? I really don’t want to leave 
Charlotte, and I can’t believe I’m saying this to you, Mike, but I’m not going 
to take the job offer. I cannot believe I’m saying this, but it’s not—the timing 
is not right, you know? I can’t believe I just turned down that job.”
I went back to Price McNabb and I worked there for another six months. 
Lucas was born, and it was awesome. In the meantime, John Boone had been 
freelancing. He had left Price McNabb and was freelancing at The Martin 
Agency, and they offered him a job, and John, almost jokingly, said to Mike 
Hughes, “I know that you had offered David Oakley a job a few months back. 
He’s in Charlotte and I’m in Charlotte. I know he didn’t want to move to 
Richmond. Why don’t you just open an ofﬁce in Charlotte and you can hire 
both of us, and I know he would take the job.” John came back to Charlotte 
and told me about it. And I’m like, “You did what? You said that to Mike? 
Wow! That’s pretty cool.” And then a week later, Mike Hughes called and 
says, “We’d love for you to work for us. God knows why you want to live in 
Charlotte, but, if you want to live in Charlotte, we’ll do it. We’ll get you guys 
a little place and we’ll hire you.” So that was that. We opened up an ofﬁce for 
The Martin Agency here.
Tuten: So how did BooneOakley come about? Why isn’t it The Martin 
Agency Charlotte?
Oakley: That’s a good question. We worked with Martin for maybe three 
years. Three years seemed to be about my limit before I needed some­
thing new. We got to work on Wrangler jeans. We did a ton of fun stuff 
for Wrangler. I thought it was a great account. We pitched and won the 

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley
144
Charlotte Hornets. We pitched Performance Bike. John and I were kind of 
autonomous, but we also worked on some of Martin’s bigger brands, like 
Kellogg’s and Saab and Wrangler out of Richmond. We were really just a cre­
ative output and we spent a lot of time in Richmond. I personally started to 
get bored. I just kept thinking, “You know, this is kind of boring.” I don’t know 
if sitting and looking at John all day was boring. I don’t know what it was. He 
was probably more bored than I was, but I really wanted to break off and 
start our own agency.
Honestly, Martin thought the Charlotte Hornets account was too small 
for them. And I was like, “You know what? It’s not too small for me.” Also, I 
didn’t want to travel as much at the time. I was doing a lot of traveling for 
production, and I had two small kids and I wanted to be in Charlotte with 
my family. I talked to John and we came to an agreement: “Okay, we’re going 
to start BooneOakley.” But then we had to talk with Mike. We went to 
Richmond. I sat down with Mike Hughes and told him, “I really have always 
wanted to open my own shop. There is only one place I’d rather work than 
The Martin Agency and that one place would be working for myself. The 
Martin Agency was like my dream job. Everything’s been great about it. I’m 
going to do it [open my own agency], but I’m really honestly scared out of 
mind because this is like jumping out of an airplane—or jumping off a tra­
peze without a safety net below.”
And the Mike Hughes said the coolest thing. He said, “This is your safety net 
right here. You can always come back to work for me.” That’s what he said. I 
was like, “Wow. That is so amazing. Mike, are you serious?” And he says, “No.” 
He just started laughing, but then he said, “Yeah, I am serious. If you guys get 
tired of it in a year or two years and you realize what a pain in the ass run­
ning your own agency is and how hard it is, you can call me and come back. 
He was serious when he said, “I will take you back,” which I thought was one 
of the greatest things ever. If I can ever offer that to someone who works 
for me, I will. I would always want to be like Mike Hughes. He’s the best boss 
ever.
Tuten: Do you ever think about going back?
Oakley: Every day. Every day I think about it. I do! Running your own busi­
ness is really hard and it’s a lot more than just doing fun, creative work. It’s 
so much more than that. It’s much harder than I ever realized. At the time, 
we were this kind of cocky creative team. Creativity magazine had named us 
“hot creative team of the year,” and this was in 2000. We were full of our­
selves a little bit. We were like, “We don’t need those account people. We 
don’t need those support people. We don’t need big Martin. What do they 
do? We can do all of this on our own.” And we struck out on our own, and 

Advertisers at Work
145
it was like, “Holy shit. You know, they did a lot of stuff. They did so much 
stuff, and it’s not really all about the creative.” Running your own business 
is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but yet it’s probably the most 
rewarding.
Tuten: Have you ever called Mike to ask him if you could come back?
Oakley: Yeah, it was a couple weeks ago. I did talk with him. I said, 
“Remember when I came to talk to you and you said if we ever wanted our 
jobs back we could? Can I have it back?”
And he just says, “No. I was lying. No, you can’t have it back.”
I’m like, “Oh, man, come on. You said that I could come back.”
He says, “I was kidding.” But he was just totally joking. He’s the type of guy 
that if I called him today and say I wanted a job, he would give me a job. It 
might be as a janitor. I don’t know what the job would be, but he would help 
me.
Tuten: How did you launch BooneOakley? What did you do?
Oakley: The ﬁrst thing that we did for BooneOakley was to put a billboard 
out on Highway 485. It was in the year 2000. It was about two weeks before 
the presidential election. That was the year that Al Gore was running against 
George Bush. We put a billboard up that had a picture of Governor Bush 
and it said, “Gore 2000.” This was a big, fourteen by forty-eight [foot] bill-
board. When we had the outdoor company print it, they’re looking at it like, 
“What is this? This is a mistake.” I’m like, “Don’t worry. Just print it and put it 
up.”
So we put it up, and within an hour, we’re getting calls from CNN, Fox News, 
wondering, “How in the world could you have made such a horrible mistake 
and how did you do this?” I respond, “Well, you’ve got to understand, um, 
um, um, it’s our ﬁrst day, our ﬁrst week in business. You’re not really going to 
write a story on this, are you? You’re not really going to?”
This one guy from Fox kept saying, “This is the biggest political campaign 
blunder in history. Of course we’re going to write a story on it.” But then 
he says, “So tell me: who are you working for? Is it the Democrats or the 
Republicans?”
And I don’t know how to respond. I just say, “Um, we’ve been instructed not 
to say.” I just said it like that. He says, “Oh! You’ve been instructed not to say? 
They don’t want you to tell us who you’re working for? Oh, okay.” He was 
all over me. And I’m like, “That’s all I can say. I would really appreciate it if 
you would just let this drop.”

“We’re not letting this drop.”
That afternoon, it was the lead story on CNN.com: “Ad agency bungles 
campaign billboard.” It was kind of a worldwide story. This was on a Friday, 
but on Sunday, I’m online, Googling the story, and I’m seeing pictures of this 
billboard everywhere. I’m seeing it in, you know, in Chinese. They had written 
about this story in China. I’m like, “Oh my God.”
I remember telling Claire, “No, I can read this. Look. It says, ‘Those idiots 
don’t know the difference between Bush and Gore. What a bunch of idiots, 
losers, whatever.’” Anyway, that’s basically what it said. We had to pretend 
all weekend that we didn’t know anything, except that we had just really 
screwed up. On Friday afternoon, we had said, “Well, we’re going to get it 
changed as soon as possible. We’ll get it taken down, but the outdoor com­
pany has left for the weekend. They don’t work on Saturday and Sunday. You 
know how unions are.” [Laughter.] I’m saying that—like there are no unions 
in North Carolina. But, anyway, we had said, “They don’t work on the week­
ends. We’ll change it Monday morning.” Then on Monday morning, we sent 
out a little press release saying, “At eleven o’clock the Bush-Gore billboard 
will be ﬁxed.” That’s basically what we said. And at eleven o’clock, there was 
an NBC News helicopter literally ﬁlming live while we put a sign across 
the billboard. The sign said, “Today’s job opening: proofreader for 123Hire.
com,” which was a jobs listing site. Someone had needed a proofreader. 
Obviously, there was a proofreader who was needed because there was a 
giant mistake!
The news story was carried on CNN and everywhere. It ran all over the 
news outlets again. The story was, “Well, you thought it was a humungous 
blunder, but what it turned into was an amazing, amazing publicity stunt for 
123Hire.com,” and we got nationwide coverage again. On Wednesday of that 
same week, there was an article in The Wall Street Journal about it, and we 
were interviewed for The Wall Street Journal, which is a pretty darned good 
way to start a business. That was a good thing.
The president of Continental Tire North America, which is based in 
Charlotte, drove by the billboard that weekend and came into the ofﬁce 
on Monday morning and told his marketing team, “Find out who did this 
billboard. I want them to pitch our business.” Continental just happened to 
be in the middle of an agency review, and they asked us to come into the 
review. To make a long story short, we ended up winning that business two 
weeks later. That billboard really catapulted us and got us going.
Tuten: That’s a great idea. How did you come up with that?
Oakley: John and I were talking one afternoon about all the political signs 
that were in the neighborhood. It was primary season, probably in August 

Advertisers at Work
147
of that year. You know, there were like tons of Pat McCrory signs in our 
neighborhood, and John was saying he couldn’t believe how many were 
in his neighborhood. One of us happened to say how weird it would be if 
there were a mistake or, you know, what if one was printed wrong? Then I 
remembered this story about Yonkers Raceway. I don’t know if you’ve ever 
heard of this, but there’s a horseracing track up in New York, probably in 
the Bronx, I guess. Yonkers is in the Bronx. When they opened it, if I have my 
stories straight, it was in the 1940s. They were almost bankrupt by the time 
they ﬁnished it, but they put giant letters up and they spelled it “Yonkers 
Raceway,” but they spelled it “wya.” They misspelled it, and the next day, it 
was on the cover of The New York Herald. I think the Herald was the paper of 
the time, but the New York Post and The Daily News had it on the cover. The 
Raceway had free publicity from this giant screw-up, but then all of a sudden, 
everyone knew that Yonkers Raceway was opening that weekend. They were 
idiots because they spelled it wrong, but they had gotten the publicity that 
they had wanted. They had a sellout that weekend. Everyone came out to the 
race to laugh at the sign, and it got them started off successfully.
We thought, “Man, wouldn’t it be wild if a political billboard was done the 
wrong way like that?” We had a friend from 123Hire, and we were talking 
to him about using our new agency. We honestly had this idea for 123Hire 
before we even had them as a client. But we called Brian Parsley, who was 
the owner of 123Hire. We were like, “Look, we’ve got a great idea. We want 
to come present it to you.” We brought it to him, and said, “There’s no way 
anyone’s ever going to do this. It’s so risky. You’re talking about the president, 
the future president of the United States,” and we’re thinking copyright 
infringement, and this and that. Somehow though, Brian just says, “That is 
awesome. I love that.” He went on, “It won’t cost that much to print this. I 
already have billboards in Charlotte. I’ll just take one of my old ones down 
and put that one up.” So that’s how it happened.
Tuten: That’s perfect.
Oakley: It worked out really well. I will tell you. It was scary that weekend. 
I was not prepared for the media onslaught, but I was able to kind of get 
through it somehow.
Tuten: Are you usually the voice of BooneOakley? Are you the primary 
spokesperson?
Oakley: Yeah, pretty much. I just have that personality. When I was in the 
eighth grade, I won an award at the end of the year. The Kaopectate Award, 
for basically having diarrhea of the mouth. I’ll never forget my eighth-grade 
teacher giving me that award in front of the whole school. It was great, yeah.

Tuten: Teachers live for moments like that.
Oakley: [Laughter.]
Tuten: BooneOakley’s web site is very unusual. Can you tell us about that?
Oakley: It’s basically a series of YouTube videos. I wish I could take all the 
credit for it, but all the credit really goes to a junior team that was working 
here, Jim Robbins and Ryan Holland. We had given them the task of redo­
ing our web site. Our web site prior to this one launching about a year and 
a half ago was basically built-in ﬂash. It was really cool. It had astronauts on 
it. We were dressed as astronauts. It had gotten a lot of attention and won 
industry kudos for being a cool web site. We wanted something new, but 
also to do something else that was very attention-getting. Well, Jim and Ryan 
had come to us with an idea to include a talkbot on the site. Basically, the 
idea was that a visitor could type something into our site and the site would 
give an answer. Anything you typed in, we would have an answer for it. It 
seemed like a really cool idea. We were working on it for a while, and then 
another agency did something similar, so John and I killed the idea. We said, 
“We can’t do that. It’s too similar.”
Jim and Ryan did just what Luke Sullivan talked about: they outlasted the 
idiots. We killed the idea and they came back to us a week or two later 
and said, “You know what? We noticed this thing on YouTube where you 
can do annotations in the videos, and you can click on the videos to go to 
another video.” They were showing it to us, and we were like, “Wow. I didn’t 
know that. That’s crazy. I had no idea you could do that.” It was a brand-new 
technology.
We started talking about the agency, asking things like: What is 
BooneOakley’s story? What are we all about? We were about really doing 
daring work and doing things that are outside the, very unusual, creative 
stuff, so let’s tell our story and maybe tell our story in a series of videos. We 
talked with Jim and Ryan about what we wanted to say in the videos, and 
then they went back and illustrated the ideas with stick ﬁgures. It almost 
took me back to my friend, Laura Bowen, and the ﬁrst time I considered 
advertising as a possible career. They were just really crude drawings.
They put them together on ﬁle cards and came in and showed the ﬁrst 
video one afternoon, and I almost fell off my seat. I was like, “Holy God, 
this is good! This is so funny.” We spent like the next two months com­
ing up with other videos and other things to link them all together. Really, 
the whole web site was just a vehicle to show our work and to show what 
we did, what we had done, and to make it very interactive and easy to get 
through.

Tuten: You got tons of publicity for doing the web site that way, but are 
there any cons?
Oakley: We got a lot of publicity. We’ve gotten a lot of new business inqui­
ries through it. One of the cons, though, is using YouTube. A lot of corpora­
tions block certain sites, like porn, I guess, and YouTube! That means many 
people cannot access YouTube at the ofﬁce. We didn’t realize this, so in some 
respects, we shut ourselves off from consideration by companies. At com­
panies in which YouTube is restricted, when someone types in booneoakley.
com, the site comes up as “restricted.” We have had a lot of new business 
leads, but the biggest con is that not everybody can look at YouTube at the 
ofﬁce.
Tuten: What do you think you’ll do next with it?
Oakley: You know what we’re going to do now and we’re in the process 
of doing it? We’re going to keep the YouTube site. We’re going to keep it 
because I think it’s great, and we’re able to update it and add things. It is a 
little bit of a problem that people can’t view it from some companies, so 
we’ve done a very simple site. We direct people to that site if they have 
problems navigating the one on YouTube.
Tuten: I read recently on your blog about a pitch that you lost.
Oakley: Which one?
Tuten: I don’t know which one it was.
Oakley: I’m joking. But I’m also laughing because I feel like we’ve lost like 
our last three pitches.
Tuten: Oh.
Oakley: It’s very fresh in our mind—losing. The hardest thing is losing. I 
hate, hate, hate losing, absolutely hate it.
Tuten: It’s surprising then that you blogged about losing.
Oakley: Well, I just felt like it was almost cathartic. I wanted to send the 
message out to our people that maybe sometimes when you lose, that’s 
what was meant to happen, and you have to accept it and move on. Maybe 
we weren’t right for that client, even though we really wanted it. And, you 
know what? We weren’t right. We weren’t right for the client if we lost the 
pitch. In that blog post, I told a story about a pitch I was on when I was with 
The Martin Agency. We went down and pitched Alamo Rental Car. While we 
were waiting to give our presentation, I found the pitch that the agency that 
had previously pitched in the morning had left by mistake in the rehearsal

150
room. I’m looking through the pitch thinking, “Oh my God. This stuff is ter­
rible. This is awful. Oh my God. There’s no way we’re going to lose to this.” I 
brought the other pitch with us, and we did our presentation.
Our presentation basically was [laughter] received by crickets [dead silence]. 
When we presented, it was like crickets. We were in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, 
and we all loaded into the van that would take us back to the airport. I was 
like, “I can’t believe the stuff that Foote, Cone, and Belding presented. It’s 
terrible. It’s got like Bobby McFerrin singing and changing his song to ‘Don’t 
Worry. Drive Happy.’ I can’t believe anyone would actually present that. If we 
lose to these guys, I’ll be vomiting all the way home.”
John Adams, Martin’s CEO, and really, really a brilliant guy, was with us on the 
pitch. He said, “If we lose to these guys, I’ll be okay with it.”
I’m like, “What? Are you like crazy?”
He goes, “No. If we lose to these guys, we weren’t right for them. They don’t 
want the type of work we do, and it wouldn’t have been a good ﬁt. So it’s 
better for us to lose now and move on to something else.” He goes on to 
say, “If we were pitching against Chiat or Wieden+Kennedy or Goodby, I 
would really, really be upset if we lost to them, but I won’t be upset if we 
lose to FCB because it wasn’t meant to be. They don’t do the same type 
of work that we do, and if they win, they will have beaten us at a different 
ballgame than what we’re playing. Obviously, the client wants something dif­
ferent.” Well, we found out a week later that they went with FCB, and that 
actual campaign I had found in the rehearsal room got produced.
I really didn’t believe John Adams. I’m like, “You’re full of it. Don’t you want to 
win?”
He said, “I don’t want to win if it’s not the right ﬁt for our agency. You have 
to take a step back and realize that you’re not meant to win everything. 
Sometimes it’s better to lose than to get into a bad relationship.”
Anyway, that’s what I needed to share with our people here. When we lose, 
it’s meant to be. We just weren’t the agency who produced the kind of work 
that that prospective client wanted. Sometimes it’s better to lose.
Tuten: How did the employees take it?
Oakley: They told me I was full of shit. No, I don’t mean that. I think they 
really appreciated it. I wrote it more for them than anything. I wrote it for 
the people who actually worked on the pitch. I wrote it for the agency. And 
I wrote it for me, too. Because even though I know what John Adams taught 
me is true, it’s still really hard to lose.

Tuten: How do you handle it as an agency when you lose? Do you have a 
meeting about it? Do you talk through what you did right and what you did 
wrong?
Oakley: We always bring everyone together. We’re very transparent about 
things. We’re a small agency, and I’m not a great poker player. People can read 
me. They know when I’m really psyched, and they can tell when I’m really 
bummed. When I get that phone call after the pitch and the ﬁrst thing I hear 
on the phone is, “Unfortunately, we’ve decided to go with another agency,” 
you know, I’m not going to be able to walk around the rest of the day jok­
ing and everything. I’m going to go to the guys and say, “Here’s the deal. We 
didn’t win. We gave it our best. I’m really proud of everyone. We went all the 
way down the ﬁeld.” It’s almost like being a coach. You’ve got to keep your 
team excited and up, and you can’t let them get too low. I think that’s one of 
the things about running a business that you end up becoming. You become a 
coach.
Tuten: You’ve had three losses recently?
Oakley: Yes.
Tuten: What’s that like? That’s got to be a whole new level of coaching, 
coaching past it.
Oakley: It is. It’s really hard because I’m right in the middle of it. I want to 
win, but we just have to be patient and ﬁnd the right next piece of business 
that’s good for us. It’s really difﬁcult and you have to keep your head up. It’s 
not that different from any sports team when you go on a three-game losing 
streak. You just have to get up the next day and go to work, and eventually, 
things will fall in place. I’ve been through periods of time where we won like 
crazy. The work’s coming in like crazy. Of course, winning creates another 
set of problems. It’s a funny business. It’s very much a roller coaster business: 
you’re up, you’re down, you’re up, you’re down. It’s a wild, wild, fun ride.
Tuten: Can’t take it too personally.
Oakley: You deﬁnitely can’t take it personally. It’s just like when you’re a 
junior writer and your creative director’s telling you, “No, that idea sucks,” 
or “That idea’s not good,” or “But maybe you should do this.” You really can’t 
take it personally. You just have to keep going and coming back with new 
stuff. You kind of have to go home and lick your wounds a little bit and then 
come back the next day and be ready to go after the next piece of business 
that might be available.
Tuten: Is that the best piece of advice that you’d give to someone who’s 
somewhat new in the business?

Chapter 9 |  David Oakley: Creative Director, BooneOakley
152
Oakley: Well, I think you really have to learn to have a thick skin, and 
ﬁgure out how to deal with obstacles put in your way so that you can get 
around them. Figure out a way to get around them and make things happen. 
That’s the best way. In this business there are always different obstacles and 
different ways to get to a solution, and you’ve got to ﬁnd a way to make it 
happen.
Tuten: What’s next for you? What dreams and aspirations do you still have?
Oakley: Well, actually, it was just doing this interview, so I’ve pretty much 
peaked now [laughter]. But seriously, I’d like to grow into someone more like 
Mike Hughes. I look at Mike as like the best boss I’ve ever had in terms of 
being a real, genuine, nice, good person, who has great instincts and is great 
with people and is fair in his judgments and people respect him. Yet he was 
able to let the people who work for him grow and do the work and become 
better. That’s what I’m hoping that I’m able to do, that the people who work 
for me become better people and deﬁnitely better creative people, but 
more than anything, better, and maybe one day they’ll go off and start their 
own place.
Tuten: Do you want to grow BooneOakley? Is it as big as you want it to be?
Oakley: No, I’m not really that concerned about size for BooneOakley as 
long as we’re able to make a decent living and continue to do the type of 
work that really makes me happy and makes John happy, the type of work 
that gets noticed and gets talked about, and really creates a reaction for our 
clients. I mean, really—it’s not fun—advertising sucks if you’re doing boring 
work. It’s like beige wallpaper. No one even notices it. I just want to be able 
to continue doing the type of work we’ve been doing and doing it on differ­
ent canvases. I’m really excited about things that are happening digitally. The 
developments in digital represent such a new, interesting way of talking with 
people. That’s what I’m excited about. Oh, and writing that book.
Tuten: Are you and John still creative partners or too busy managing the 
business to be a creative team anymore?
Oakley: We are occasionally creative partners, but over the last couple 
of years, basically, we’ve been creative directors on different accounts, and 
we’ve been—we haven’t done that much creative together recently. He’s an 
awesome, awesome art director, great creative mind, and a brilliant guy. Yeah, 
we haven’t really, honestly.
Tuten: Do you miss it?
Oakley: I deﬁnitely miss it. But, you know, I feel like there are different things 
that I am destined to do right now versus doing copywriting or, you know.

Advertisers at Work
153
Tuten: What are you destined to do?
Oakley: I’m destined to do interviews [laughter]. No, I think I’m destined 
to be Mr. Client Relationship guy. Not really. I don’t know. I really want to be 
someone who is—I’m trying to think of how to say it—fostering a den of 
creativity. I want to be someone who creates a place where people come to 
do creative stuff and do it for our clients. I don’t know how to explain it, but 
someone who’s created this environment where really cool things happen.
Tuten: I’ll look forward to seeing what you do to make that happen.

Managing Director 
MDC Partners
Anne Bologna serves as managing director of MDC Partners 
(www.mdc-partners.com), a holding company that contains several advertis­
ing agencies, including Crispin, Porter, & Bogusky. Prior to joining MDC Partners, 
Bologna was the managing director for Cramer-Krasselt’s New York ofﬁce. Between 
2005 and 2010, she was founding partner and CEO of the independent agency, 
Toy. Over its nearly ﬁve-year run, Toy New York garnered numerous industry 
accolades and attracted clients such as Amazon, Budweiser, Virgin Mobile, Macy’s, 
and Google. One of the agency’s most celebrated campaigns, “Elf Yourself” for 
OfﬁceMax, achieved unique notoriety when it spread virally to over 200 million 
people in less than six weeks.
Prior to that, Bologna spent much of her 25 years in the advertising business at 
Fallon; ﬁrst as director of strategic planning for its Minneapolis ofﬁce and later as 
president of the New York ofﬁce, where she nearly doubled the agency’s billings 
and transformed the outpost into one of the top ten most awarded agencies in the 
world. During that time, she contributed pioneering thinking to a number of global 
brands, creating the “brand bible” that gave focus to Starbucks in the late 1990s 
and helping develop the global brand strategy for Citibank’s award-winning “Live 
Richly” campaign, considered the most successful in Citibank’s history.
In 2008, Advertising Age named Anne Bologna a “Woman to Watch.” She is a 
guest lecturer at Columbia University and one of an elite group of industry leaders 
who co-authored the book The 22 Irrefutable Laws of Advertising and When to 
Violate Them (Wiley, 2006). In 2009, Bologna received the “Changing the Game 
Award”—an honor given by Adweek and Advertising Women of New York to honor

women who’ve reinvented their businesses to meet today’s challenges. She’s happily 
married to her college sweetheart and has one son, who lives in Brooklyn.
Tracy Tuten: Let’s begin today with how your career evolved. Did you grow 
up wanting to work in advertising
Anne Bologna: So, the thirty thousand–foot view of my career? It is not 
an exaggeration to say I am probably one of those limited number of people 
who have a blessed career. I’ve only worked in four agencies, one of which 
was my own, before starting at MDC Partners, and all of those agencies 
were sort of at the peak of their life stage when I was there, which was 
purely a coincidence, of course.
First of all, I was a television reporter right out of college, but it wasn’t my 
calling and so I got into advertising by having dropped out of the reporter 
business. I went back to my alma mater and took these interest inventory 
tests, and all signs pointed to advertising, which was not at all anything I had 
ever considered. But it turns out that those tests must be good because the 
person who was counseling me, she said, “I think you’d be great in advertis-
ing. You should go do some information interviews.”
After my ﬁrst interview, I was hooked on advertising. I thought I really feel 
like hand-and-glove ﬁt with this industry. Then with my second interview, 
I was actually offered a job. I spent ten years at an agency called Campbell 
Mithun in Minneapolis. I spent ten years there, which I call my MBA in adver-
tising because it was an agency that had a number of blue chip packaged-
goods companies, like General Mills, Pillsbury, and ConAgra.
One of the things that Campbell Mithun did that was very noteworthy dur-
ing that time, was having launched Healthy Choice from scratch. The Healthy 
Choice launch was obviously a tremendous success. It’s still around and it 
still is a robust business. I worked there for ten years as an account person 
and then I became an account director.
I started to get a little bit bored because all the assignments seemed to be 
the same to me. I was looking for new challenges, and so I walked across the 
street to Fallon. I started at Fallon as a planner, an account planner, which is 
on the strategy side of our business. I was a senior planner even though I 
had no idea what I was doing exactly in that particular discipline, but a hand-
ful of years later, I became the head of the planning department, and I had as 
many as twenty-ﬁve planners reporting to me. I did that for ten years.
At that point, I left Minneapolis and I moved out to New York City. This was 
in the early 2000s and at that time I wanted to make the switch from run-
ning a department to running an agency. I was the president of Fallon New 
York in the early 2000s. My primary goal at Fallon New York was to turn

157
around the agency’s creative. It was a big challenge. At that time, Fallon New 
York didn’t even have a reel. In our business, the reel is obviously a catch­
phrase for having a body of work that is a calling card to clients. I found a 
creative partner, Ari Merkin, and together we reinvented the ofﬁce. By the 
end of that third year there, we were proud to be able to be able to say that 
little New York ofﬁce of Fallon was among the top ten most creative agen­
cies in the world. We were very, very proud of that.
It was right at that point that the industry started to shift. There were start-
ups in New York, like Mother and Taxi and Strawberry Frog. You could see 
things changing, and at the same time, Fallon didn’t necessarily need a New 
York ofﬁce. It seemed like a good time to start an agency. That’s just what we 
did and we called the agency “Toy.”
Tuten: Where did the name Toy come from?
Bologna: Basically, Toy was a metaphor for ideas that are as engaging as a 
new toy. That was basically the idea, which I think kind of sums up what was 
happening in the advertising industry. In other words, we need consumers 
much more than they need us. If our ideas are not engaging, as engaging as a 
new toy, we won’t be able to communicate effectively with our consumers. 
So we founded an agency based on that philosophy.
Tuten: What was it like to compete as a new agency in this world of 
powerhouses?
Bologna: We did some things that we are really proud of. We launched the 
Kindle (for Amazon) and developed the “Elf Yourself” campaign for Ofﬁce 
Max. The “Elf Yourself” campaign attracted 193 million visitors and was called 
the best viral campaign in the history of the Web. More than 123 million 
“elves” were created and shared online.
But my hindsight learning was that we started the agency too late in our 
careers. After ﬁve years, we closed. We were an amazing threesome, the 
three partners—myself, and Ari Merkin, who’s now at Crispin Porter, and 
David Dabill, who’s also at MDC. We needed another ﬁve or six years to 
reach the level of scale that we needed. At this late stage of our lives, it just 
didn’t feel like we had the luxury of doing that. After ﬁve years, the timing 
was right with our employees and with our clients for us to say, “You know 
what? Let’s transition all of our clients and we’ll all kind of move on.” We 
tried to treat our people well in that transition and now here we are.
Tuten: What was it like, giving up an agency that you essentially birthed?
Bologna: It was pretty emotional stuff. I call it “the exceedingly rational 
business decision with profoundly emotional consequences” because it 
was difﬁcult. It was like giving up a baby, really. And it still is. It will always be 

Chapter 10 |  Anne Bologna: Managing Director, MDC Partners
158
one of the best experiences in advertising that I will ever have had because 
there’s nothing like having your own. It certainly is one of the most unique 
experiences, but it lives on because it is actually you. One of the best things 
that came out of it is it strengthened the partnerships and the friendships, 
frankly, that I had with my two business partners at the agency, David and Ari. 
That’s something I’ll carry with me forever, as well.
We did some good things and we left a little bit of a creative legacy. “Elf 
Yourself” is still one of the most signiﬁcant successes in viral marketing. I 
think it reached one in ﬁve Americans, after just six weeks. So funny. And, of 
course, launching the Kindle was a something that we were proud to be a 
part of. It felt like it was a wonderful and precious little moment in time, but 
for all kinds of reasons it was time to move on.
Tuten: And then you joined Cramer-Krasselt as managing director of the 
New York ofﬁce.
Bologna: Interestingly, Peter Krivkovich, who is CEO of C-K, was one of 
the ﬁrst people that I spoke to after we decided to close down Toy.
Well, the transition was astoundingly seamless because C-K honestly shared 
all the same values that I have, which range from a strong work ethic to a 
humble sense of self. For instance, I don’t talk much about myself. I always 
say, “I’m from Minnesota. I don’t talk about myself. I just get the work done, 
you know?” And that was similar to C-K.
C-K is at heart a Midwestern agency, in terms of their home base. They have 
a very strong work ethic and a philosophy of being humble: don’t pound 
your chest too hard and talk about yourself too much. Just focus on the 
work and focus on the client and good things will come. That’s the culture, 
but it’s also an agency that is essentially smart. It isn’t really fair to summa­
rize an agency in one word, but if I had to do it, I’d say that C-K is smart. It 
attracts smart people. It’s run by smart people, and the CEO and the chief 
ﬁnancial ofﬁcer and the chief operating ofﬁcer are all incredibly smart people 
and they focus on business strategy and consumer strategy. They spend a lot 
of time on getting the foundation, which is often termed “the strategy.”
And if you played a reel of all the agency’s work beyond just television, you’ll 
just feel the sort of intelligence that’s baked into it. I value putting intelli­
gence into marketing, because I think the marketing lasts longer and it works 
harder. That’s what led me to being a strategic planner in the ﬁrst place. C-K 
does that—it puts intelligence into everything it produces.
Tuten: It seems in this industry we tend to think that creative work can be 
creative or it can be effective, but we might not see many examples of both. 
When creative is smart, it can achieve both?

Advertisers at Work
159
Bologna: Exactly. You see a lot of clever but kind of “dumb,” or not clever 
but creative—but still dumb—advertising on the market. Consumers can 
feel when it’s this kind of creative for its own sake as opposed to being 
smartly creative, you know? I really appreciate effective and smart creative, 
and I appreciate that consumers get it.
Tuten: Has it been hard to integrate into a new agency? How is it different 
from creating a new agency from scratch?
Bologna: When you start an agency from scratch, you have this ability to 
attract people who want that. People who are eager to see what the agency 
can become. I’ve always had that experience, though, whether it was grow­
ing up or working at developed agencies or beginning my own. I am spoiled 
because I grew up with a very, very wonderful family. I always say I won the 
gene-pool lottery. So I was lucky that way, and I was lucky to work at both 
Campbell Mithun and Fallon with smart, nice people. I’ve just been spoiled by 
that.
Tuten: What’s a typical day like for you?
Bologna: Well, every day’s different, which is one of the things I love about 
advertising. We basically learn new things for a living and because all of our 
clients’ problems are new, not only across clients but within clients, you’ve 
got to learn something new every day in order to exist in this business. But I 
would say the general manager’s job falls into less than a handful of buckets. 
One big part of my job is setting a vision, and setting a mission, and creat­
ing an environment in the agency where people can do the jobs that they 
need to do and do them well. Setting the bar and maintaining high standards, 
which is the leadership piece in its purest form.
Beyond that, I deal with a lot of the soft issues, like people issues, growth and 
development issues, and opportunities. Frankly, I just deal with a lot of the 
people-people-people stuff. That’s one big bucket.
Tuten: Are you involved in client work?
Bologna: That is another bucket of work—client relationships. I try to forge 
very strong trust-based relationships with each one of our clients. I’m almost 
an activist in that regard. I’m very proactive in being involved in enough of 
the detail so that I actually know my clients’ businesses. I have to be involved 
in client work. I ﬁgure the minute I become only a ﬁgurehead, then I should 
be ﬁred. I should ﬁre myself.
Do you know why I think that? In advertising, we are really simply a service 
business. We service our clients. We make things, but at the end of the day, 
we are an extension of our clients’ business problems and their brands. 

Chapter 10 |  Anne Bologna: Managing Director, MDC Partners
160
I think if you get too far away from being deeply involved in your clients’ 
businesses, if you get too far away to add value, you’re over. Frankly, clients 
are paying for leadership from senior staff and if they’re not, they should be. 
Those that aren’t usually will end up regretting it. Why? Because I have a lot 
of experience to bring to bear on behalf of my clients. That’s what senior 
staff does. I really like doing that. You could think of client relationships and 
adding value to clients as kind of a whole bucket in the role of a managing 
director.
The third bucket is new business development. To work on developing new 
business means that I’m constantly out in the marketplace meeting people, 
networking, and making sure that people that I know—or people that I 
could or should know—know what the agency is doing. I send e-mails and 
notes and letters. I contact people and let them know what’s happening, and 
now that there’s social media, I can post things on Facebook and Twitter 
about the things the agency is doing. Deﬁnitely new business is another 
bucket of tasks related to my job.
The ﬁnal bucket is really just the general, operational part. There’s just a lot 
of business stuff. I run a business here, too, as well as an agency, and that’s 
a lot about the numbers for everything ranging from how well we’re run­
ning the place to what kind of light bulbs should we have. It’s running the 
infrastructure; decisions that nobody really cares about, but yet can’t be 
neglected.
Tuten: People oftentimes struggle with maintaining a balance between work 
life and home life. One might suggest this is harder for women than men 
and also harder in a business like advertising than it might be in some other 
professions. How do you manage maintaining balance? Or do you?
Bologna: That’s a good question, and I have a little bit of a different answer 
than you might expect. I didn’t do this consciously, but as I look back on my 
career and my professional and personal life, I never really balanced. I never 
said to myself, “Gee. I’ve just got to get more balance.”
I did say, “I wish I could spend more time with my child.” I don’t think any 
mother, working mother, ever feels like she’s spending enough time with her 
child. But I’ve always integrated my work life with my personal life. I don’t 
know if that’s unusual, but I’ve always blurred those lines. My business rela­
tionships became my personal relationships, and my personal relationships 
became my business relationships. That’s still the case. It all felt satisfying to 
me because I just never drew those dividing lines. I’ve been called a “worka­
holic,” but I’ve never felt like a workaholic. I feel like I love what I do and I 
like all the people that I do it with. This is why I’m extremely careful about 

Advertisers at Work
161
choosing who I work with. When you’re working with people that you don’t 
see eye to eye with or people who are just big energy drainers, which is 
poison to me, that’s when work starts to feel like work.
Tuten: How did you grow from your early work as a planner to serving in 
leadership roles?
Bologna: This goes back to the fortunate part. If you look back over my 
career, you could say that the majority of my career has been spent at Fallon. 
My experiences there totaled twelve or thirteen years. I always have said the 
culture of Fallon is simply an extension of me. You have to consider too that 
not only did I feel so consistent with the culture of Fallon, but I also worked 
there during my most formative years. I was there during my early-to-mid 
thirties through to the mid-to late forties. It just felt like I was there forever. 
Those are really formative years. During that time I rose from just being 
an employee to being a manager to being a leader. I grew up there. It’s like 
you’re birds of a feather. Toy was more of the same. During my time at C-K, 
likewise. I have felt that I worked with people that I would want to spend 
time with. I’m so fortunate to be able to work with like-minded colleagues 
and like-minded clients.
As for leadership, people either take to leadership or they don’t. I did and 
I do. Even if becoming a leader is difﬁcult for someone, even if a person 
doesn’t take to the leadership role initially, growing into a leadership role is 
really about serving others. There comes a point in a leader’s tenure when 
they have to reconcile the fact that leadership is nothing more than being 
the best possible version of yourself in service of others. Basically, that’s 
what leadership is. To lead, you’ve got to get comfortable with that.
Once you step into that role of leadership—well for me, at least, it’s not 
like I miss being in the actual day-to-day practitioner roles. Why? Because 
once you have a certain role in the agency, it’s not like you ever really stop. I 
still do account planning every day. I still do account management every day. 
I kind of pretend to be a creative every day. It is more satisfying to me to 
help other people to be the best version of the roles they are playing, which 
is what they are, than for me to be doing those roles, though. In that way, I 
guess you can say that I’ve crossed over to the side of facilitating and devel­
oping people more so than doing the work of the agency.
I’ll tell you this, if I wasn’t around account planners, or around account plan­
ning such that I could at least contribute, I probably would miss it, but I’m still 
around it. And I’m better off, because I think there are people that are better 
than me now doing account planning. I can add value, but the people actively 
in those roles are current and practiced in their respective crafts.

Tuten: Do you have any rituals that are important to your ability to work 
effectively? Things you do to gear up for work?
Bologna: That is an interesting question. I do a couple of things. One of my 
rituals—really more of a practice than a ritual—is to nurture diversity. I’m 
really, really big on diverse people. I love getting a group of people who have 
different points of view together in a room. When you do that, chances are 
the room is not going to be a comfortable place for anyone there! But good 
things can come out of a room full of different people with different points 
of view. I even hire that way. Companies need to ﬁll themselves with diverse 
people. Agencies need diversity to grow and succeed. Pick people with the 
same values, and you’ll get the same outcomes. So I’m really big on that. I 
also try to foster debate and discussion. People tell me that I create tension. 
I call it “creative tension.” I call it “healthy tension.”
First of all, I think when you are disagreeing with someone, the act of dis­
agreeing must always be managed with utmost respect for the individual. I 
won’t tolerate people treating others in a disrespectful manner, no matter 
the nature of the disagreement. But healthy discussion and debate, I think, is 
how you get to places, to more creative solutions.
The other thing I believe in and that I use as a practice for effectiveness is to 
be “in touch.” When my son was young, I really felt like I was in touch. If you 
have children, you know that’s how you stay current. Just look at the children 
and you know what’s happening! You look and see what they’re doing, and 
that keeps you fresh. This is really key for creativity. Creativity comes when 
you combine two things that aren’t generally combined. That’s why I talk 
to a lot of people—I ﬁnd stimulation in talking to a lot of diverse people. 
And I read a lot. I keep myself in touch with whatever is new and fresh. I’m 
sort of an early adopter of new technologies and new things because I think 
that’s how you make connections between things that might otherwise not 
be made. So my unwritten rules are just the whole embracing of a sense of 
diversity and outside inﬂuences and bringing those things to bear to solve 
the problem at hand.
Tuten: If you had a magic, fairy wand and with it you could change one thing 
about advertising, what would you change?
Bologna: I would abolish all fear. There is so much fear now. Too much fear 
in the business world and particularly today, with the economy the way it 
is. One of the things I lament about is the way fear limits us from making 
advances forward. It’s not like I’m pointing ﬁngers because the clients are 
under pressure. Still, the business world in general has a lot of legacy and 
fear and we have to stand up to pressure and adversity. These are just words 

Advertisers at Work
163
when I say them—it’s easy to say these things, of course. But it can be amaz­
ing when you stand up in the face of pressure and adversity and you just 
take a stand for something and you decide you’re going to take a risk with 
something. That takes personal courage, and I think we need more of that 
today than ever.
And in the agency world there’s a fear of change. On the client side, there’s 
fear of being the champion for an idea that has longer-term potential than 
just next quarter. So I would eradicate fear.
Tuten: Is there a way to do this?
Bologna: Well, ﬁrst of all, I think humor can be very useful sometimes. It 
can be useful to think of people from the perspective of a parent. I would 
say everything you needed to know about humans you learn as a parent. If 
you’re not a parent, I would say think about what it was like for you when 
you were a child or when you were a teenager. You never wanted to do what 
your parents told you to do. In fact, if they told you what to do, you wanted 
to do just the opposite. Everybody is still that way.
If you want to get people to do things, you’ve got to take note of human 
nature and you’ve got to do a bit more cajoling and allow people to have 
ideas of their own. Nobody wants to be told what to do. You need to inspire 
people and to help direct and guide people to make good decisions on their 
own. I deal with fear the same way I would deal with any challenge. I brought 
up the humor thing because sometimes humor can be the great leveler. It 
can cut through a lot of tension. I remember I’ve done that since I was a 
kid. I’m a pretty straightforward gal, and I try to deal with things head-on. I 
don’t let things fester and I’m also not big on subterfuge. I always say I’m too 
stupid for politics. I just don’t get that stuff. I just say what needs to be said. 
But I’m direct and yet respectful of people’s humanity and people’s sensitivity. 
I deal with things straight on, but I also use a liberal amount of humor and 
empathy.
Tuten: It’s easy to forget how powerful simply showing empathy to others 
can be.
Bologna: Oh yes. Besides the fact that human beings can be far more fragile 
than they appear, there’s also this fragile thing called ego. Sometimes you just 
have to be mindful of the fact that ultimately everyone needs to feel all right 
about themselves. I remember I heard a terrorist negotiator once say that 
the secret to successful negotiation is to allow your opponent to save face. I 
think people forget that. People forget that nobody wants to look stupid. No 
one wants to look wrong, and certainly not in a big meeting when the stakes 
are high and others can observe your shortcomings. People don’t want their 

Chapter 10 |  Anne Bologna: Managing Director, MDC Partners
164
dignity challenged. You’ve got to be mindful of those things as you handle 
difﬁcult situations. It takes a deft hand.
At the end of the day, I would say the one thing that I’ve always found that 
transcends things and makes difﬁcult things very easy besides a liberal 
amount of humor is just simple honesty and integrity. Those two things will 
get you a long way. Even recently, I’ve had to face some very difﬁcult conver­
sations with clients. Conversations involving very sensitive situations with 
clients. Whether they knew they were doing it or not, situations in which 
clients were treating some of our people with disrespect. Those are hard 
conversations, but they are conversations that must be had. You can’t let 
those things go. As a leader, I have to bring those things up, but such conver­
sations have to be managed in just the right way. If you do it with integrity 
and honesty and treat them the way you want to be treated, it’s going to be 
okay. I can’t think of any situation where this approach has gotten me into 
trouble or even gotten me an adverse effect. Frankly, if it has, it was probably 
meant to be anyway, whatever the outcome was, even if the agency got ﬁred 
or they asked me off the business, whatever. Probably in the end, it was the 
right thing.
Tuten: Mad Men has reintroduced a lot of stereotypes about advertising. 
Do you see any truth to those stereotypes in the industry today?
Bologna: Well, I think a lot of stereotypes still exist, I just think they’re a lot 
more hidden today than they used to be. They’re a lot more under the radar. 
There are things that happen and things people believe or don’t believe, but 
these kinds of things are kept more covert. I try to ignore all that, I guess. 
When you watch that show, I think the things that deﬁnitely still exist in the 
industry today are the characters. In fact, there are a lot of characters in the 
business, which is one of the things I love about it. Sometimes the quirkier 
you are, the better. I think human beings are characters, and I think some­
times we hide our quirkiness, which is not a good thing.
There’s a lot of drama in agency business. Whether you’re making a show 
about it or not, there’s a lot of drama in agency business. I think it’s because 
we deal with the most fragile part of the human condition. We use our 
imaginations for a living, which means you have to have an idea. That means 
you’re putting yourself out there—way out there—all the time, every day. 
It’s a very insecure place when you’re doing that. You’re dealing with a lot of 
human drama in the whole business.
Even beyond creativity, pitching business is the lifeblood of the agency busi­
ness. We’re constantly pitching. There is no high like winning, and there’s very 
few lows like losing. It’s an emotional rollercoaster. I always say that manag­
ing an agency is really about managing energy. You can help build that energy 

Advertisers at Work
165
and fuel that energy in a positive way, or you can do the opposite. If you lose 
a pitch, an agency feels terrible, just terrible. . If you lose several in a row, 
which happens to all agencies sometimes because that’s just how it goes, 
it can be extremely demoralizing. There is an ebb and ﬂow to the industry. 
Agency leaders have to ﬁgure out how to just keep people up.
The other thing, that’s not as prevalent in the industry today that should be 
more prevalent, and that did exist back in the Mad Men era, is the ability to 
get to the point. This might sound funny. But watch an episode with a pitch 
in it. If you watch their presentations, Don Draper will spend about two min­
utes just setting up the situation, something like, “Well, okay. You came to us 
and you said you want to sell hotels.” Then he says about a minute’s worth 
of explanation on creative strategy and then he shows the ads. That’s it. 
Agencies have gotten into this really bad habit of spending forty-ﬁve minutes 
or more, and one hundred and twenty slides to explain the most obvious 
things. We explain things the client knows. We explain what can be assumed. 
And in the process, we make something that should be exciting and interest­
ing, boring. We have made things a lot more complicated and time-consum­
ing than they need to be.
Tuten: I see that kind of inability to focus in many areas today. Do you ever 
say that to the team you are working with as you prepare presentations?
Bologna: I do try. I think if you ask people here one of the things that I am 
notorious for saying is, “Excuse me. Do you have a point? So what’s your 
point?” It’s like, “Get to the point!” People do not want to hear you drone 
on and on. A good metaphor is PowerPoint. On a slide template, there is a 
headline and then there’s a whole body of text. The client doesn’t need to 
hear all the text. Get to the headline! Then move on to the story. We tend 
to overwhelm clients with too much information that’s not really leading 
to a solution. That’s something that has become prevalent throughout the 
industry—the overkill of information. Mad Men has that right. That’s how 
presentations ought to be and that’s a lesson that the industry has forgotten.
You know, this isn’t really rocket science. We are in a very human business, 
whether people like to admit that or not. If you look at some of the best 
advertising ideas of all times, they are so incredibly simple. Now, the business 
world has gotten very complex. How to reach consumers is complex. I’m not 
issuing a call for oversimpliﬁcation. I am, however, issuing a call for simplicity.
Tuten: But everyone has bought into the same approach. What if one 
agency goes in with simplicity and another goes in with overkill. There’s the 
fear you mentioned earlier—what one agency loses from an impression of 
lack of preparedness.

166
Chapter 10 | Anne Bologna: Managing Director, MDC Partners
Bologna: Yes, right. We’re our worst enemy. You know why? It’s because 
agencies are so competitive. And the times that we do that most is when 
we’re pitching. You keep thinking to yourself, “Oh my God, my competi-
tors are probably going to come in with more ideas and a better strategy.” 
Agencies tend to react to that by presenting more and saying more and 
going deeper into the details when, in practice, you should do the opposite. 
You should have better ideas and explain them less [laughter].
Tuten: What changes in the industry have you found surprising?
Bologna: One of the things that is most surprising to me is that things are 
really not as different as we think they are. Consumers aren’t that different. 
What’s different is how they’re behaving and what they’re interacting with. 
But the basic motivations? They are the same. Five years ago, I did not get 
the majority of my news on Twitter. I still got the news. My need for news 
is the same, but where I go to get the news is different. The point though 
is that human nature has remained very much the same. As an industry, we 
tend to forget this. The other thing about advertising is that we’re in a “back 
to the future” situation as an industry. We are actually returning to some of 
the approaches we used long ago. Remember, the soap operas were invented 
by advertisers. That was branded entertainment. Now, years later, we see 
brand-sponsored entertainment as one of the most rapidly developing areas 
of advertising.
I was reading a piece that was published in Harvard Business Review in the 
early nineties. [It] was published almost twenty years ago. The article was 
about launching brands without mass media advertising. The article was 
all about the importance of sponsorship and promotions. It talked about 
Swatch, Häagen-Dazs, and The Body Shop. Since then, of course, there’s been 
Starbucks. The idea is that consumers aren’t watching as much television 
anymore, and we have to respond with sponsorships and promotions.
But, you know what? When advertising started, consumers weren’t watching 
television! Brands inﬁltrated popular culture then and when brands inﬁltrate 
culture and consumers’ lives now, we think how it is all brand new. It’s really 
not! What’s new is the range of vehicles and technologies. We just have to 
use some of those old-fashioned principles of getting your brand in front of 
consumers in a relevant way without just pouring money into thirty-second 
TV commercials. My short answer to what’s surprising to me is that things 
are actually not that different. Once you look beneath the massive changes in 
vehicles and technologies to the way consumers actually interact with mes-
sages in the media, the fundamentals are still the same.
Tuten: Share a campaign that is personally meaningful to you. Is there one 
that stands out? A favorite?

Bologna: Do you mean from my own personal career? I have one that 
comes to mind. One from my history that is near and dear to me is 
Citibank—the “Live Richly” campaign. It launched in 2000, I believe. What I 
loved about it is that it was like a good movie. When you go and see a really 
good movie, the movie stays with you for not only days, but you remember 
it for years. That’s what happens with a movie that really resonates with you. 
The same thing that makes a movie great is the same thing that makes an 
advertising campaign great. It’s not easy—but a lot has to go right.
With the Citibank “Live Richly” campaign, everything went right. First off, 
the clients were wonderful people. Anne McDonald and Brad Jakeman were 
the clients, who are now still professionals in marketing. Anne and Brad are 
really very talented, visionary people. They decided that they wanted to do 
the best work in the world, not just in banking, which, by the way, was not 
known for great advertising. So they set an enormously high vision, an aspira­
tional vision for the campaign. They did their homework. They didn’t even do 
an agency search until they had their own ducks in a row. So they really set 
an aspirational vision, and then they got their act together.
One thing that’s become too uncommon in the agency business is that 
sometimes a client needs to kind of get their own house in order before 
they do an agency search. So Citibank did that. They got their house in 
order. They spent a couple of years ﬁguring out their own internal politics 
and their own product and they put together a really thorough visionary 
brief, and then they decided to do an agency search. In a nutshell, they were 
brilliant people who set a high aspiration and did their homework and they 
briefed the agencies really well.
In the agency business it is a little bit like garbage in–garbage out. The work 
is only ever as good as what you put into it. I always say that one of the 
dirty little secrets in the agency business is that agencies really are pleasers. 
Agencies want to do a great job, and when you give them a huge challenge 
and then you get out of the way and let them do their jobs, agencies will go 
beyond the call of duty. Citibank did that. The pitch included seven or eight 
agencies, and Fallon ended up winning it. We made history together.
We launched this campaign called “Live Richly” and it ran in thirty-three 
countries. It was their most successful marketing campaign ever. In fact, after 
the ﬁrst six weeks, the increase in checking accounts was something like 
three hundred percent just because the campaign struck an emotional chord. 
It was an incredibly successful campaign. It touched people in ways that no 
one would have ever imagined. It was just an emotional appeal, but it moved 
the business and we, everyone who worked on it, had not only continued 
successful careers after that, but we all became friends. We’re still very close 
friends more than ten years later.

168
Tuten: What made it so special? The work or the people with whom you 
were working?
Bologna: It was all of the above. Back to the point that everything went 
right. All those things that went right are the same things that are so satis­
fying. The campaign theme was smart and emotional. It was successful. We 
made friendships. We were like a band of brothers. It’s satisfying to be a part 
of something.
Tuten: Any special moments from your current role?
Bologna: I wish I had a story here to share, and I’m sure I will at some 
point. But since you’ve asked such a big question, I thought I’d better go back 
into the archives of my history.
Tuten: What’s still ahead for you? You’ve started your own agency. You’ve 
risen through the ranks at two of the top agencies in existence. What still 
awaits you?
Bologna: That’s a great question. I think I kind of alluded to it earlier when 
I was saying how satisfying it is to me, having crossed over into the realm of 
leadership. Really, I would love nothing more than to help create the condi­
tions for greatness for other people. To help create the right environment 
for successes like the Citibank “Live Richly” campaign to happen for those 
working on my team. I work with a wonderfully talented group of people, 
and many of them are in that sweet spot age of between thirty and early for­
ties. Everyone should be able to have the kinds of opportunities that I’ve had. 
I’d love to be able to give these folks the opportunity to have the same kinds 
of experiences that I’ve had, to be honest. If I can do that, it will be very sat­
isfying for me at this stage in life. It’s the whole giving back day to day. Frankly, 
I don’t think you have to go to Africa to help the world, right? You can help 
people in your own backyard. That’s one thing I want to do. It’s important to 
me.
And then, when you think about the struggles and challenges we have in the 
world. But one of the realities of the world in which we live is that the entire 
world is challenged. Things are not great in the world right now, starting with 
our own economy. Our economic situation is pretty dire. I heard a statistic 
the other day that’s very upsetting, which is thirty-seven percent of the chil­
dren in America are living in poverty. That’s terrible. That’s here. Right here in 
the US. When I talked about how I blur the lines between my personal and 
professional lives, well, I’d like to blur the lines between doing business and 
doing good. I haven’t quite ﬁgured out how to do that yet, but it’s something 
I will do and I look forward to doing.

Tracy Tuten: Jayanta, how did you end up in advertising? Did you grow up 
wanting to be in the ﬁeld?
Jayanta Jenkins: No, it was completely by accident to be honest with you. 
I grew up in a family that deﬁnitely wasn’t on any particular side of creativity. 
I mean, my father wasn’t in advertising, nor was my mother or my grand­
parents, for that matter. My uncle was a lounge singer, and I always found 
it interesting going as a kid to watch him sing. I guess if there’s any form of 
creativity in my past, it was from him. And, as a kid, I loved to draw. I loved to 
take pictures. There is one thing growing up that I think did have an impact 
on me. We lived probably about twenty-ﬁve minutes west of Washington,

DC, and I always ended up at the museums because my father worked liter­
ally less than a block, a quarter block away from the Smithsonian Mall. I do 
remember quite often spending a weekend at least once or twice a month 
just hanging out at the museums all day. This happened from the time I was 
eleven until I was eighteen. Usually I would end up at either the Air and 
Space Museum or the National Gallery of Art. Those were my favorites.
Tuten: So with advertising you are able to integrate your love of art with 
your career?
Jenkins: That was deﬁnitely the beginnings of my interest and love for art. 
In terms of how speciﬁcally I got into advertising, I would say it was really by 
mistake. When I went to undergraduate school, I went into school wanting 
to be either a painter or a graphic designer or a photographer. Ultimately I 
ended up studying fashion photography and photojournalism, and I got my 
major—those are my minors—my major was in fashion art and advertis­
ing. But I remember the kind of pivotal thing that happened while I was in 
school. There was a guy named Jerry Torchia, who was a creative director 
at The Martin Agency. He had an advertising class at VCU where I got my 
undergraduate degree. Basically in this class, he taught about advertising, and 
the creative process used to come up with ads.
In the class, we would create ads and we had to bring in work that we’d 
done for critique. I hadn’t done any ads whatsoever. All I had was photogra­
phy. So I brought in photos that I’d taken. He looked through it all, and then 
he looked at me and very convincingly said, “You should be an art direc­
tor.” And I’m like, “Okay. What is an art director? It sounds cool. Yeah, sure.” 
And I remember him giving me an art director’s annual, a One Show Annual. 
I started going through these things, and I don’t know what happened, but I 
completely locked into it.
I had deﬁnitely wanted to be a creative in advertising because what I had 
noticed and saw at the time was just the ability to do all of the things I’d ever 
loved as a kid and as a teenager. Everything I loved was at my disposal as an art 
director: photography, illustration, ﬁlm, music. Once I fully understood that I 
could in some way or shape connect to all these people and collaborate—that 
was it. I absolutely dug my nails in and I haven’t looked back since.
Tuten: That was the pivotal moment, for your teacher to turn to you and 
say you could be an art director.
Jenkins: Yeah, absolutely. Because again, I had no clue what an art director 
was. I didn’t even know how ads were made at the time. We’re all sur­
rounded by advertising from the moment we’re born until [we] die. Growing 
up where I grew up, there’s no reason I would have known or had any insight 

Advertisers at Work
171
as to how ads are made or that people even actually came up with them, you 
know?
Tuten: Did you think, “People get paid for that? You’ve got to be kidding.”
Jenkins: They get paid, and in some instances you get paid very well. It’s 
crazy just how well. More importantly beyond money, you get to inspire and 
challenge yourself daily.
Tuten: You ﬁnished out your fashion and ﬁne arts degree. You didn’t switch 
over to a degree in advertising at that point?
Jenkins: No, I went back to school after I got my undergraduate degree. At 
the time, the big school for advertising was called the Portfolio Center in 
Atlanta, Georgia. All the people that I’d seen in these One Show annuals had 
gone to the Portfolio Center. It was highly recommended at the time. So I 
applied and ended up going to the Portfolio Center for two years to get my 
advertising skills sharpened.
That was a great experience as well because I went from VCU, which was 
kind of very broad and general, to a very highly disciplined program. I was 
surrounded by kids who had the same ambition, and I learned and grew and 
was taught by other advertising professionals. Those are really great experi­
ences, and it really helped me prove to myself that I actually should pursue 
a career in advertising. Up to that point, it was a desire for me, but I hadn’t 
made any ads! Like I said, I had just been doing photography—and Portfolio 
Center was a good training ground for me to ﬁnesse my skills and create a 
portfolio.
Tuten: What was your specialty? Did you stick with photography or did you 
branch out at that point?
Jenkins: You know, at that point, when I got into Portfolio Center, what I 
really fundamentally began to understand about all creative—photography, 
illustration, ﬁlm—is that it has to be guided by a powerful concept or pow­
erful idea. Whatever message you have has to be guided by a powerful, pow­
erful idea. It was part two of my “Aha” moment in advertising. To be good, 
you must come up with really great ideas. Photography or ﬁlm or whatever 
is going to be the medium that you may use to execute that idea. And then 
you must execute brilliantly. Illustration, same thing. Television, same thing. 
Design, the same thing. Even product packaging! All these things are guided 
by the key component, which is having a great idea. So that was the thing 
that I focused on in my time at Portfolio School—creating ideas. It wasn’t 
like photography or illustration, but it just was making sure that no matter 
what the delivery device was for the message, that it had a brilliant, beautiful, 
big idea.

Tuten: In your role now, as the global creative director, are you still generat­
ing ideas?
Jenkins: Absolutely. I mean, ideas are like oxygen! We require ideas to 
breathe. Ideas are deﬁnitely the thing that drives business. I work on 
Gatorade now, and my work, it’s all about ideas, one hundred percent.
Tuten: You’re actively involved in client work?
Jenkins: Oh yes. I’ve been involved on a daily basis. When I ﬁrst got into the 
business, [I had] no concept of the client work. It’s a skill that can’t be taught 
in school. It’s just honed over time. It’s one of the things I love doing—inter­
acting with our clients and helping sell ideas and working together collabora­
tively to make things come to life. It’s one of my most favorite things about 
being in this business—the collaboration.
Tuten: Can you share something you’re working on now? Something that 
you’re excited about?
Jenkins: Now that I’m doing global work, what’s really exciting is taking the 
platform that we started here in the United States. We’re basically trans­
forming Gatorade from a hydration company to a sports nutrition company 
and creating that imprint around the world.
We’re creating a global language that will unify the brand, not just as an 
American brand, but as a global brand. You don’t really get too many oppor­
tunities like that in your career to lead brands like Gatorade in a really big 
way. It’s very exciting to me, and it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. It 
started when I was working on Nike in Portland at Wieden+Kennedy. I was 
working on basketball, and I had the opportunity to launch Lebron James 
in Asia. It was just really exciting to strip away language and again come up 
with ideas that could connect with people universally. Once I started seeing 
ways of doing it, being able to participate in the process, I recognized that I 
wanted to be the global guy. I didn’t just want to be the guy that worked on 
a brand and spoke to people within our borders. I wanted to really develop 
ideas and platforms that really spoke universally because we are a global 
community. That really excites me about being a communicator in advertis­
ing. It’s being able to express ideas universally to people, you know?
Tuten: What is a typical day like? Do you have one?
Jenkins: You know, I’m glad you asked that question because this is one of 
the things I love about advertising. It’s a different job every single day you 
walk into the door. My father worked for the government. His job was the 
same exact type of job every single day of his life. I mean, that works for 
some people. Some people like that very systematic routine. But advertising

is such that literally the complexion and the complexity changes every day, 
sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Sometimes something 
happens that you don’t like, but no matter what, it’s a different organism 
every day you walk into the ofﬁce.
Tuten: How much time are you spending traveling?
Jenkins: A ton. I probably spend a good ﬁfty-seven percent, if not a little bit 
more, presenting work or on production. Travel is a big portion of this job, 
which is also fun. I love going to different countries and seeing things and 
learning about different cultures because that helps to inform the work that 
I do on Gatorade, and other things I get to do as well.
Tuten: Now, with Gatorade, you mentioned that company shifting its focus 
to nutrition.
Jenkins: Yep.
Tuten: So repositioning the mission of the brand even. Did you help come 
up with that idea? Did you help direct the path?
Jenkins: I was part of the team. I work with some really amazing strategic 
people here at Chiat Day. One guy in particular is Scott MacMaster. He’s a 
brilliant strategist. A couple of other guys I work with are Nick Drake [global 
managing director], Brent Anderson [global group creative director], Patrick 
O’Neill [executive creative director], and Steve Howard [global group cre­
ative director]. We have a really amazing team of smart, passionate people on 
Gatorade who love the brand. Our clients are passionate and have a really 
strong vision for the brand as well. You’ve got to put all these heads into play 
as you look at things to roll out, like the tagline we just came up with, or 
the positioning of going from a hydration brand to a sports nutrition brand. 
There are a lot of players involved in the work.
Tuten: Do you usually specialize in sport, given your background at Wieden? 
Did you come into Chiat to work on a sport brand?
Jenkins: Yeah, yeah, I did. But the thing for me that’s interesting is that I was 
never a big sports person growing up. I didn’t really play sports as a kid, but 
the thing that I probably bring to this whole game that helps tremendously is 
my love for culture, popular culture and sports culture. And, you know, not 
being that typical—not that there’s anything wrong with being a jock, but I 
was never that numbers kind of jock person, you know what I mean? I was 
never in the gym all the time, but I loved the culture behind sports. That’s 
been the thing that’s really helped me carve out a little path for myself and 
ﬁnd my own voice within this whole experience for sure.

Wieden was my ﬁrst entrance into dealing with a sports brand. My very 
ﬁrst job was with The Martin Agency, ironically because the guy who got me 
into this was from The Martin Agency. But when I got up to Wieden, I was 
assigned to Nike. I just immersed myself. That’s what you do. You immerse 
yourself. What makes the stories that people tell special, whether those sto­
ries are told through commercials or some other channel of communication, 
what’s special is that the stories they tell are told through their own lens, 
their own ﬁlter, their own take on things. What’s brilliant about what comes 
out of Wieden and absolutely what comes out of Chiat or any really great 
advertising agency is the ability to tell stories and to tell them from a unique 
perspective. You’re coming at the story from a different angle. It’s about get­
ting people’s points of view that come from their own experiences. That’s 
what makes everything really unique, I think, in most cases.
Tuten: I would think your background, not being a jock, would really be a 
huge beneﬁt to you to speak differently, to have a unique voice in the world 
of sport, and help you understand people who also come to sport from a 
different perspective.
Jenkins: Yeah, absolutely.
Tuten: So, tell me about the path that led you to your current role. You 
started at Martin. You would have worked under Mike Hughes at that time?
Jenkins: Yep. Mike is awesome. Mike was one of those people who really 
helped me take ﬂight. The Martin Agency was an amazing place to start for 
me. Obviously, they have an amazing reputation, an amazing legacy, and they 
continue to do amazing things. But one of the things that I learned really, 
really strongly, one of the things that made an imprint on me at Martin was 
their ability to do print. They were doing print advertising back in the eight­
ies to nineties that was just head and shoulders above anything that was 
being done nationally. Maybe even internationally. I learned the craft of print 
advertising from those guys, and they really took me under their wing and 
helped nurture me and give me a real good runway to take off because my 
second job was at Wieden+Kennedy.
Wieden is where I really found my voice. I learned television and I learned 
how to take an idea and blow it out to many different forms and to commu­
nicate the idea on multidimensional levels. It was an amazing place to grow 
and to be nurtured and, again, to ﬁnd my voice. I grew up at Wieden.
Now, Chiat has just been amazing. I’ve been able to take all that I’ve learned 
over the last—let’s say eight or nine years—and throw it away to a good 
extent because every place is different and has a different approach to things. 
With Chiat, I’ve developed a degree of maturity that has aligned with all my 

Advertisers at Work
175
past experiences and has allowed me to really become more than I had ever 
imagined I would become in this business. I’m still growing. I’m still deﬁning 
myself, but Chiat has given me an amazing platform to lead brands and to do 
things in a way that I never dreamed of at Wieden or at Martin. It’s been an 
amazing career so far actually, when I sit down and think about it.
Tuten: Well, when I consider the path, the hierarchy of the agencies, going 
from Martin to Wieden to Chiat. That’s impressive.
Jenkins: Thank you. I don’t know if anyone else has talked to you about this, 
but you begin to wonder what’s next, you know what I mean? You reach a 
point where you wonder what the next challenges are. Each place that I’ve 
been at so far has really given me the ability to stretch and grow into roles 
and to deﬁne myself and to access things that really career-wise have been 
amazing. Really, really amazing.
Tuten: So what do you think you want to do next in terms of a personal 
goal or professional development?
Jenkins: [With] the pursuit of a career in advertising, what’s been great is 
all the things I’ve been able to achieve. But I’ve left some things off, and that’s 
been personal relationships. I’ve never been married and part of the reason 
is because I’ve been really chasing this thing. I’ve been totally dedicated to 
developing my career. Personally, I’d like to get to a place where I can just 
feel good about where I am and maybe be married and have a family.
Professionally, it’s looking for the next challenge and maybe the challenge 
isn’t through creating a TV commercial. Maybe it’s something else. Maybe it’s 
a movie. Maybe it’s working on product development. I don’t know what. I 
just think the lesson I’ve learned, that I’ve been learning over the last ten-
plus years, is it’s all about the power of an idea. The vessel is what you use to 
deliver that idea.
Tuten: You have me curious. I’m going to follow you and ﬁnd out what you 
end up doing.
Jenkins: Me, too.
[Laughter.]
Tuten: Do you think about opening your own shop?
Jenkins: No, I don’t think about opening my own shop. A good friend of 
mine just recently opened his shop. For me, it’s not really anything that’s ever 
crossed my mind. I can’t explain why not, but it’s not something that I’ve 
actually wanted to do, to be honest with you.

176
Chapter 11 | Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
Tuten: Just because you like to focus on doing the fun stuff and not the 
other stuff?
Jenkins: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
Tuten: Well, I’ve talked to a mix of people with this book. Some people 
at major agencies like you, and some people, like David Oakley, who have 
started out on their own, and consistently, they all said, “We had no idea 
what we were getting into.”
Jenkins: Yeah, that’s kind of the beauty of this business or businesses like 
this. That unknown and that question mark really helps foster and create 
a lot of this magic that happens. I don’t know that anyone who begins an 
agency really knew where they were going to end up. They just have the 
passion. And I think that’s the common theme with everyone you’ve spo-
ken to. They’re very highly motivated, passionate people who have had the 
luxury and the blessings of being able to land themselves with brands that 
need people like them to help communicate their stories. They’ve had the 
opportunities to work with great brands that want to put good into the 
world.
You know, I’ve never worked on cigarettes. I don’t want to. I don’t drink 
anymore so I wouldn’t put my energy toward that kind of product either. But 
it’s really been a blessing to be able to align myself with brands that promote 
the common good among people. That kind of work is inspiring, amazing.
Tuten: Is there a brand that you want to work with? One that’s like a 
dream?
Jenkins: Yes. There is a brand that I would love to work with: Prince.
Tuten: Prince the musician?
Jenkins: Yeah. I think it would be amazing to work with someone like that in 
developing marketing for a record or for a tour, you know, whatever he put 
his pursuit toward. That’s someone that’s actually been a really big inﬂuence 
on my career. Prince is an iconic individual who has taken an industry and, 
through his point of view and music, has deﬁned himself and the category. 
And not just music, but ﬁlm and however many other different things.
I always imagine that if I could approach my career in advertising the way 
that Prince has approached his career in music that it would be a never-
ending journey of fun, amazing, great things. Can you imagine what it would 
take? I don’t know if you follow Prince or musicians like Prince, but just 
imagine what it would take to reinvent yourself, to stay part of the social 
consciousness, and to do it your own way. I think that’s amazing. It’s that

same quality that I admire about Dan Wieden and David Kennedy. That’s 
what I admire about Mike Hughes and also David and John at BooneOakley, 
and Rob Schwartz, Patrick O’Neill, and Lee Clow here at Chiat. These are 
people who really helped deﬁne things on their own terms, and a lot of 
people agreed with them or came along for the ride, you know? I think 
that’s beautiful.
Tuten: Do you actively try to plan for your life and your career following in 
Prince’s model? Are you doing that?
Jenkins: You know, I think—yes, to answer the question. I mean, I don’t 
know if I’m anywhere near that trajectory, but I know that’s been my motto 
for sure, absolutely.
Tuten: When did you come to a place where you recognized that would be 
a model that would be appropriate for you?
Jenkins: It was long before I got into advertising. I think this was prob­
ably when I was a kid, you know, a teenager, when I was listening to his 
music. I think to a lot of people back in the eighties, Prince’s music was just 
highly sexual. It wasn’t the sexuality that attracted me to his music. What I 
deﬁnitely saw was someone who was creatively a genius. I was really moved 
by the approach and the music and just the style of the music. His personal 
style. To this day it still really blows me away and it motivates me in a really 
huge way.
Tuten: Do you know him?
Jenkins: I don’t, and it’s funny because I’ve been to like seventy-ﬁve-plus 
concerts and I’ve deﬁnitely followed this cat for a while, but I’ve not had the 
opportunity to work with him yet.
Tuten: I bet you will. I can just see that happening. You’ve put your wish out 
into the universe, and I think it’s going to come.
Jenkins: Yeah, I hope so. That would be a good one to come true.
Tuten: Do you have something that you worked on in the past that never 
made it, that never got produced, but something that you loved when you 
were working on it?
Jenkins: You know what? Here’s another thing that’s really been cool 
because I was talking to a good friend of mine, Melanie Myers, who is a 
global recruiter at Wieden+Kennedy. We talked a few weeks ago about cre­
atives who get into these funks where they don’t produce things for a year 
or six months or however long. Going dry that long can be a mental death 
if you’re a creative person. The conversation made me think back on my 

Chapter 11 |  Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
178
career and productivity. Ever since I started at Martin, I’ve been consistently 
producing work. There’s probably work that someone might wish would get 
produced that doesn’t, but I think I’ve been really blessed, knock on wood, 
that every year that I’ve been in this business I’ve been able to put some­
thing out there to be judged or contribute to the greater good. I can’t say 
that there’s anything that’s been killed or a brand that I’ve wanted to work 
on that I haven’t been able to put my hands on yet.
I will say that I never could have imagined that when Jerry Torchia told me 
to be an art director that I would have worked on brands like Nike and 
Gatorade. I couldn’t have imagined then that I would be able to say I’d be 
a global creative director helping lead a bunch of people in the business. I 
mean, that’s just mind-blowing. So I don’t spend much time thinking about 
what I haven’t done or what I wish I’d done. I’m just very blessed at the 
moment where I’m at, and hopefully where I’m heading.
Tuten: What do you do to nurture your creativity?
Jenkins: I take lots of pictures, I’m on Instagram, and I just try to stay con­
nected and present. In advertising, time can go by very quickly. The downside 
of working in advertising is the social aspect. Socially, the focus tends to be 
on alcohol. Which is just not good. It puts you in a place of being uncon­
nected and not present and not in the moment. I think these days what I 
tend to try to do is give myself a creative outlet. The outlet is staying con­
nected to the culture, and just doing things that kind of again keep me in the 
moment. When I ﬁrst got into advertising, I got caught up in the external 
part of advertising. The part that people think is really cool. Drinking is a big 
part of socializing in the advertising industry.
Tuten: The Mad Men portrayal.
Jenkins: Yeah, yeah. Everyone’s different, but I’m deﬁnitely in a happy place 
right now. I quit drinking almost a year ago and I’m really happy about that. 
It changed my whole point of view [about myself] and being in this business, 
and I think it’s made me a better person, you know?
Tuten: How did that come about?
Jenkins: Well, this business, for me, it’s been about relationships on a very 
personal level, being able to communicate with people and being able to be 
a nice person. This is what I’m getting at. There were times when I wasn’t 
“in the moment” like I am now. Times when I would come to work and I 
was just so hazy and so cloudy from drinking the night before that I wasn’t 
able to be one hundred percent—I wasn’t able to contribute one hundred 
percent. I was only contributing about, let’s say, forty-seven percent, which is 

Advertisers at Work
179
actually—I was doing damn good at forty-seven percent [laughter]. Which is 
why it’s even more of a blast to people to be doing my thing at one hundred 
percent now. But I don’t know, I just feel a lot more together and my head’s 
screwed on a little more tightly, without all that other nonsense.
Tuten: You said at Chiat that you came into your own and developed your 
maturity, and I can hear that maturity in what you’re saying. It a big step to 
take, I think, for anyone.
Jenkins: Yeah, it is. You know what’s funny about being a creative in adver­
tising? The idea is that you want to stay a young person at heart. You need 
to feel that you can connect to people and feel you’re not passé. I’ve been 
able to maintain the sense of connection without having to go off on the 
deep end. I don’t need to drink and act like a complete lunatic, which I think 
some people think you have to be to be a creative in advertising. Again, 
maturity is the word. Chiat, my work here, has matured me for the better. I 
love it.
Tuten: Do you have a mentor now?
Jenkins: You know, that’s funny. Yes, I do. Jimmy Smith has been my mentor 
probably for the last twelve years, and that’s actually a very interesting story 
if you have time to hear it.
Tuten: I certainly do.
Jenkins: Jimmy Smith was a creative at Wieden+Kennedy. And after Jerry 
Torchia told me to be in advertising, I started going to annuals and look­
ing at work religiously. I saw Jimmy Smith’s name. He happened to be at 
Wieden+Kennedy. After I started looking through these annuals over and 
over again, I started recognizing the work of Wieden+Kennedy and places 
like Chiat, Fallon, and BBH London. Very soon after I discovered I wanted 
to be in advertising, I also discovered I wanted to work at places like 
Wieden+Kennedy, by all means. Jimmy is another African American, and I 
just cold-called him. He asked me to send him my portfolio, and I did, and he 
didn’t like it. That’s when I’d gone back to school, to the Portfolio Center. I’d 
stayed in touch with Jerry Torchia, who was my ﬁrst mentor in advertising.
Then Jimmy Smith became my mentor. Jimmy would give me pointers here 
and there, but to make a long story a little bit shorter, I ended up, through 
Jimmy’s guidance, getting the job at Wieden+Kennedy. Jimmy talked to Dan, 
and Dan saw my work, and then Jimmy helped to continue to nurture me 
from the point when I joined Wieden. The very cool thing that happened 
was Jimmy went from being my mentor within my fourth year of working at 
Wieden to becoming my partner. At the time I didn’t think about it much, 

Chapter 11 |  Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
180
but my mentor became my partner. We worked together for a number of 
years, and then we became business partners, and then he became a fam­
ily friend and today he is probably like a brother to me, like more than a 
brother to me. That cold call turned into this relationship that became 
something much bigger and broader than I would ever have imagined. To this 
moment, he’s still one of my best friends and continues to inspire and to give 
me pointers. And, he tells me when I’m fucking up. He’s been a huge force in 
my life as a friend and professionally as well.
Tuten: Did he play a role in your decision to mature and to stop the haze?
Jenkins: Yes, yes, yes, he did. He absolutely did. In fact, he also played a role 
in me coming to Chiat. Chiat had gotten Gatorade and spoken to Jimmy. 
Jimmy had left Wieden in probably 2005 and I’d stayed behind. Then Chiat 
asked me to come too without knowing that Jimmy and I were connected. 
It was cool because we were able to reconnect again. He’s actually gone off 
and started his own business called Amusement Park Entertainment. He’s 
doing his own thing now in a big way. When I look back on it, it’s a really 
cool relationship that I’ve stumbled upon because of advertising.
Tuten: Are you helping to mentor anyone yourself now?
Jenkins: I am, deﬁnitely. I mentor a guy who basically just cold-called me 
out of the blue and then showed up in Portland! I’ve been mentoring him 
for probably the last ﬁve or six years. I’ve at least tried my best to help him 
along and do his thing. The thing that’s interesting about when you mentor 
people is that sometimes people will show up for a split second and then 
basically they’ll get discouraged and go off and do whatever. But then you 
have a small few people who really value your time and your input and actu­
ally end up ﬁnding their own path. They may need a little bit of assistance, 
but they’re doing amazing things. This guy is starting to do that for sure for 
himself.
Tuten: He’s at Chiat?
Jenkins: No, he’s not at Chiat. Actually, he works for the Food Network, as 
an associate creative director.
Tuten: Interesting.
Jenkins: Very different path.
Tuten: That must be very fulﬁlling for you to have had someone who helped 
you so much and then be able to do that for somebody else.
Jenkins: Yeah, it’s cool. It’s deﬁnitely very cool.

Advertisers at Work

Tuten: What’s it been like being an African American in the advertising 
industry, where we hear so much about issues with developing diversity in 
staff and that kind of thing?
Jenkins: That’s a great question. You know what? It’s been crazy. It’s been 
absolutely crazy. And it’s been crazy because there aren’t a lot of black cre­
atives in the United States, and deﬁnitely not in positions like mine. Overall 
I would probably say less than one percent, right? And then even outside of 
creative, industry wide, there are just not a lot of African Americans in other 
positions either. And funny enough, at The Martin Agency, I was the ﬁrst 
African-American creative they’d ever hired in the department since they 
opened the doors in 1977.
Tuten: Seriously? Wow.
Jenkins: Yeah, straight up. But let me get to your question. I think the reason 
it’s been somewhat crazy from time to time is that I’m sometimes in situ­
ations with people who aren’t used to socializing across ethnicities. What 
am I trying to say? It’s just very interesting as a black person in this business, 
navigating. Not that it’s been hard or there’s been racism or there’s been 
doors shut in my face. There is simply just a lack of women and a lack of 
diversity in the ethnicities represented behind advertising doors. Diversity 
can really help businesses open their eyes and see the world differently. And 
I don’t think it’s because of anything that was purposeful, and the industry 
has deﬁnitely changed a lot since I got into the business.
And I’ve talked to Jimmy about this too. It’s changed dramatically since he 
started working in advertising, probably back in ’86 or ’87. But for me, I think 
the thing that’s been really great is being able to have a point of view and 
have a voice that’s helped change things and change people’s perceptions and 
help brands grow.
Maybe my voice has helped more African Americans be hired in creative 
departments. If you look at the landscape of this country, it’s not just all 
white or all black or all female or all male. Having different points of view in 
agencies really helps brands to stand out and carve niches for themselves, 
and not just black ones or white ones, but ones that represent a mass of 
voices, you know?
Tuten: What do you think can be done to encourage more diversity in the 
industry?
Jenkins: I think kids need to know. When you ﬁrst asked me how I got 
into advertising, I said, “by accident.” There aren’t a lot of black-run agencies 
that are in the United States, right? So there aren’t kids that have neighbors 
w

Chapter 11 |  Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
182
or uncles or whomever who are in these places, so they wouldn’t know 
about advertising as a career path, right? That’s probably one thing. And I 
just think more education in school because this is an incredibly, incredibly 
fun job, right? I come in every day, I sit around with other people and come 
up with ideas, and I get to work with some of the most talented people on 
the planet to execute ideas. I think if more kids knew about advertising, like 
really they knew about the roles within advertising, the creative directors, 
the writers, the art directors, even the planners or the account management, 
I think it would probably open things up.
It’s funny because my friend Jimmy, the reason he knew about advertis­
ing was Bewitched. He said to himself, “Wow, that guy has a beautiful wife, 
awesome home, and a fun job. I want to do that.” So that’s how he discov­
ered advertising. You know, of course, I was aware of Bewitched, but I didn’t 
connect to it like Jimmy did. I’ve actually done a lot of things in communities 
where I’ve gone to schools and talked to kids about what I do to help inform 
and inspire kids to consider a career path in advertising. Again, it’s all about 
creativity and having a point of view and having the skills to develop that.
Tuten: Those skills can be used in lots of different industries as well.
Jenkins: Oh absolutely, entertainment—across the board. Absolutely.
Tuten: If you had a magic, fairy wand and with it you could change one thing 
about the advertising industry, what would you change?
Jenkins: I would completely eliminate alcohol.
Tuten: That’s interesting.
Jenkins: Like hands down.
Tuten: Because nobody’s better with it?
Jenkins: No, no, no. Not at all. I think if there’s one thing that deﬁnitely 
becomes a huge waste of a person’s time in general is alcohol abuse, but I 
think in this industry, it’s so ever-present. Alcohol does nothing good for any 
person in this entire business, period.
Tuten: But some people might say that it’s a creative crutch, something that 
they use to get their creative juices ﬂowing.
Jenkins: What I would say to that is it’s deﬁnitely an illusion. I think alcohol 
creates an illusion, and you know illusions are make-believe. We can contrib­
ute at a higher level by expressing through the one creative intelligence that 
exists in and around all of us.

Tuten: Has that been hard for you since it is so much a part of the culture 
of the industry when you’re out meeting with people, doing the relationship-
building thing? Has it been difﬁcult for you?
Jenkins: No, not at all. It’s been great because I’ve been somewhat of a 
beacon. When people come across a creative person who doesn’t drink, 
the ﬁrst question isn’t, “What’s wrong with him?” It’s instead, “Oh, that’s 
refreshing.”
Tuten: You might inspire other people.
Jenkins: Yeah, absolutely.
Tuten: Now, you said that there’s one other thing you wanted to change. 
What is it?
Jenkins: Well, now this is a very personal thing. I just became, within the last 
two years, a vegan. I’ll tell you, another thing people do, not just in advertis­
ing, but in general, people don’t pay attention to diet, I think. When I cor­
rected the way I ate and eliminated alcohol, my clarity and so many things 
came together in such a beautiful way. In this business, the way we work, it’s 
a lot of late nights, lots of pizzas, lots of crazy food.
And you see a lot of people in this business who are very unhealthy. Imagine, 
you get into this business in your early to mid twenties and then for ten 
years, you are just eating shit. Then imagine being our age. Your body just 
can’t sustain the energy level that it’s going to take to start a business or go 
to the next shoot or whatever. Obviously, I’ve been thinking a lot about sus­
tainability as it relates to my career and beyond my career and to the traps 
of alcohol or eating poorly. It doesn’t really add up when you look at the big, 
big, big picture. Those are simple things, too. You know what I mean? They’re 
very simple things to adjust in your life.
Tuten: It’s simple, but when you’re talking about the culture of the late 
nights, the rush, the travel, it’s simple, but it wouldn’t be easy to do either.
Jenkins: No, it’s not because it comes down to a personal choice, because 
being vegan and the way I travel is extremely hard. But, again, on the other 
side of it, I have much more energy now and I can do things in a way that 
I wasn’t able to do eight years ago, and I’m not super old. I’m only forty-
one. And my energy level has gone up in the last two years as opposed to 
plateauing.
Tuten: You mentioned spirituality a little earlier in our interview. What role 
does that play?

Chapter 11 |  Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
184
Jenkins: Spirituality’s playing a huge role in my personal life and it’s inform­
ing my career deﬁnitely. By spirit I don’t meant breaking it down to being 
Christian or being Islamic or being Jewish, or whatever. What I mean is 
having the presence of mind to know that there’s more than yourself. The 
spirit that helps you get through the day. I’ve really been deeply connected 
to spirituality in a way that I wasn’t before because of bad habits or just—I 
don’t know—I won’t say “stupidity,” but just ignorance. And I think it’s helped 
inform the way I interact with people I work with. Being spiritually centered, 
I feel that I’m just a nicer person, you know. Without getting too philosophi­
cal about it.
Tuten: How did you grow into that?
Jenkins: I hope to grow even more.
Tuten: How did you nurture that aspect of your life?
Jenkins: Well, I come from a family background that’s highly spiritual. My 
father was Buddhist—which is how I got my name—and went through a lot 
of different philosophies and religions as I was growing up. My grandmother 
was into metaphysics, which is, you might know, its own thing altogether. My 
other grandmother was Christian, Baptist speciﬁcally. Those aspects of my 
family deﬁnitely informed my journey, my path that I’m on.
Tuten: So you had the foundation already. You just had to return to your 
roots.
Jenkins: Yeah, yeah, deﬁnitely. And I never allow faith or religious views to 
inform my work directly, but, at the same time, there’s left and there’s right. I 
try to allow the good principles to inform my decisions as I create things or 
as I communicate with people or as I walk this path.
Tuten: I respect everything that you’ve said. I’m really impressed with the 
thoughtfulness that you’ve applied to your personal life and your profes­
sional life.
Jenkins: Thank you.
Tuten: Your family must be really proud of you.
Jenkins: Oh, this is funny. This is my favorite story about me in advertising 
and my family. So I’d been working at Wieden and I was home visiting for 
the holidays, and my grandmother says to me, “I was at church the other day. 
Everybody was asking about you.” And I’m like, “Oh, that’s cool.” And she 
said, “[I told them] Jayanta’s in Portland selling shoes. He’s a shoes salesman 
now.”

That’s hilarious because my grandmother’s perception of what I do is like 
Al Bundy from Married with Children. But she got it half-right, because I guess 
I was selling shoes. She’s never had a concept of what it means to be an art 
director. No one in my family gets it. I brought my father out to see a shoot. 
I brought my cousin out to see a shoot so he could see behind-the-scenes 
work of what it takes to put a thirty-second or a sixty-second commer­
cial together. Even with the visits, what they understand is simply enough 
to know that I’m wildly happy, so they’re happy to that extent, but they 
deﬁnitely don’t get it.
Tuten: That’s really funny, and, you know, you’re right—I mean, she’s right. 
When it comes down to the bottom line, that’s what you were doing. You 
were selling shoes.
Jenkins: Yep.
Tuten: Do you get to see them as much as you’d like to?
Jenkins: I go home once a year and hang out. It’s always interesting going 
back home because so much has changed for me personally, just things that 
I’ve exposed myself to. When you go home, it’s just—it’s representative of 
things from the past most of the time. I don’t know if you’re from North 
Carolina or if you’re far away from home or not, but it’s always interesting to 
go back home. It’s always very interesting.
Tuten: Actually, that’s something that I’ve been dealing with quite a lot for 
the last two years because I was in Richmond. I was actually out at Virginia 
Commonwealth. I taught advertising in that program.
Jenkins: Oh, awesome.
Tuten: I probably taught the class that changed your life while I was there. 
And then I re-met someone that I went to school with from fourth grade to 
twelfth grade and we fell in love, and I moved back to my hometown. For the 
last two years, after spending twenty years away, I have been going through 
on a daily basis just what you’re talking about. You know, some things are 
the same, and some things—you just can’t put the toothpaste back in the 
package.
Jenkins: Yep. That’s awesome.
Tuten: How do you see the advertising industry changing over the next few 
years?
Jenkins: I think what’s really awesome is the technology. I love technology. 
I’ve always loved technology since I was a kid. I love that the whole way we 
interact with each other socially has changed forever and forever changed 

186
Chapter 11 | Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
the way advertising will grow and evolve. I remember when I was getting 
into advertising, a big deal was banner ads. Because the internet had just 
started.
To do a good banner ad back in 1999 was a big deal. The whole social aspect 
of the way we communicate is going to continue to change and evolve 
advertising. The thing that’s really interesting to me is teenagers don’t neces-
sarily look at TV to get all of their cultural references. The kids today aren’t 
connected to television the way we were when we were teenagers. I think 
smartphones and mobile devices are playing a big role in that, and obviously 
computers play a big role. It’s interesting because you’ve got to think there’s 
a wonderful question mark on what this will be even ﬁve years from now. 
Because of Facebook, because of Twitter, because of things that we don’t 
even have names for yet. All of this will evolve over the next ﬁve years to a 
decade.
I honestly wish I were a teenager right now because this would be the most 
mind-blowing time from a technological standpoint to be a teenager. Again, if 
you think about when we were kids, a Walkman was a big deal! It was a big 
deal because a Walkman meant personal music was portable. I mean, a cas-
sette versus an eight-track, an eight-track versus an LP. I’m very envious of 
what will be when I’m probably in my seventies because things are going to 
change so dramatically. It’s exciting. And I think it will give us different ways 
to understand to each other.
From a global standpoint, we’ll be connected to each other in a way we 
really never have been before. That’s super exciting. Brands that are smart 
and the people who run them will get on board and take a stake in this, and 
not in a way to show and to sell things, not be a huckster, but just to ﬁnd 
ways to push things forward and to allow people to grow in really beautiful 
ways.
Tuten: Do you think brands are ready for the labor commitment that social 
is bringing in terms of communication? I mean, it’s really not mass communi-
cation anymore.
Jenkins: What did you say, the labor commitment?
Tuten: Yeah.
Jenkins: What do you mean by that?
Tuten: Well, when I think about what it means for a brand to speak to con-
sumers, I mean, they might be responding to individual posts or trying every 
day to engage individuals, to come up with fresh content.

Jenkins: Oh, I see.
Tuten: Just the amount of production that can be involved for social com­
munication is so much more involved than the amount of production that 
might have been involved for three television commercials we’re running as 
part of a campaign.
Jenkins: Yeah, that’s true. I hadn’t really thought about it that way, but you’re 
right. I don’t know. I think in a world where a lot of this stuff is user-gen­
erated, brands will probably piggyback on that a little bit, and the real big 
brands will always have the resources to do really interesting things as well. 
The GEs, the Proctors, the Nikes—those types of brands.
Tuten: Actually, this reminds me of your web site. It’s called Fresh Is the 
Word?
Jenkins: Yeah.
Tuten: So what’s that?
Jenkins: Fresh Is the Word is—there’s a group that I loved as a kid called 
Mantronix, and they had a song called “Fresh Is the Word.” It was a song I 
used to breakdance to. Actually I was shocked I was able to get that URL 
because I thought someone would have taken it. But Fresh Is the Word basi­
cally emanated from that song. I also try to hopefully apply it to my work 
and to my own life, and that’s always just kind of a reminder to look at things 
from a very fresh perspective, which is really hard to do. It’s easy to not do 
it. What’s easy is to follow the status quo. That’s exclusively where that came 
from.
Tuten: That’s your slogan, your personal slogan?
Jenkins: Yep, absolutely.
Tuten: So what’s next for you?
Jenkins: What’s next for me? I feel very fortunate to Martin, Wieden, and 
Chiat because it’s been such a great progression. I’ve really started at a 
medium-sized place and then I went from a medium to a large place to a 
behemoth. And at all three of these places, I’ve still been able to be creative 
and to grow and to learn things on a daily basis.
I’m at a point in my career where I want to really be able to contribute in 
a very holistic way to the culture of the place, and not just to an account. 
The culture of a place is what seems to me to drive the work. That’s why 
places like Martin thrive, because of the culture. Wieden, because of the 
culture. And this place, Chiat, because of the culture. I wonder how I could 

Chapter 11 |  Jayanta Jenkins: Global Creative Director,  TBWA/Chiat/Day
188
­contribute to the culture of the agency in a way that would really affect 
brands and the agency and its work?
Tuten: When I talked with Marshall Ross, of Cramer-Krasselt, he had said 
that his mission for C-K was to create a creative environment, a culture 
there that would allow consistently best-in-class work. He deﬁned best in 
class as what comes out of Goodby or Wieden. You were at one of those 
agencies. You were working at a place Ross identiﬁed as a goal for C-K 
culture. I also talked to Eric Kallman, who’s with Gerry Graf’s new shop in 
New York.
Jenkins: Yeah. See, that place seems very interesting, but keep going.
Tuten: Eric basically said what you said. That’s why he went to Barton F. 
Graf 9000—to have that chance to create something bigger than himself 
there.
Jenkins: Yeah, I mean, that guy, he is brilliant, genius. Eric is a monster. When 
he made that move coming off of all the work he’d been doing at Wieden, it 
wasn’t a “What the fuck?” If you’re dialed in enough to your own thing, you 
understand why people make moves like that. I’m very envious of that guy in 
the most beautiful way possible, completely envious.
Tuten: Do you know him?
Jenkins: I don’t. I don’t know him at all. I know he was at Chiat New York 
for a while, and I know his work. I’ve always heard good things about the guy. 
It’s very rare that you hear “super nice guy” and “advertising person” in the 
same breath, and this guy has had that throughout his whole entire career.
Tuten: Anything you want to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?
Jenkins: No, but this conversation’s been really good because you’ve 
allowed me to sit and pause and think about some things in a way that I 
haven’t in one setting for a long time, so I thank you. Just for the opportunity 
to talk to you and to share some of my experiences and contribute. I hope 
it helps inﬂuence and inform the next generation of really awesome, talented 
people, and not people who are disillusioned about why they should get into 
advertising.
I think that when you look at a Mad Men or you look at some of the ways 
advertising has been represented, there are some other ways of doing things 
out there, and I commend you for your efforts in talking to people who have 
beautiful outlooks on the industry and the future, and can do things for the 
right reasons.

Tuten: I hope that you’re right that young people will read this, read these 
interviews, and be inspired, and believe that something’s possible.
Jenkins: One thing I will often tell kids and young people who want to get 
into advertising is that this business, any business really, depends on and will 
grow and ﬂourish on people bringing fresh points of view and insights of 
themselves to that business. When I sit down and talk to kids, I’ll look at two 
kids and talk about the way one’s dressed versus the way the other one’s 
dressed and how each person’s individuality helps feed the creative process. 
It helps people distinguish themselves and it helps brands distinguish them­
selves and, it helps people associate themselves and identify with who they 
are and who they aren’t.
Tuten: It’s interesting to me that you can connect the nodes of people who 
know each other throughout the book. Everyone is somehow connected 
and at the same time, they all have had, every single person has had, some­
thing so profound to say and something different from everybody else.
Jenkins: That’s one thing about creativity, and advertising suffers from it a 
little bit, is how to be really distinctly different, having a fresh point of view. 
One of my old instructors would always say to look at album covers from 
the sixties. He would point out how there was so much music produced, 
but every album cover was beautiful and interesting and unique. They were 
all different, and no one was trying to copy each other. What you said, that 
you’ve talked to people with distinctly different points of view and some­
thing profound to say, reminds me of what my old instructor said about 
albums. It’s a really good sign in terms of where this industry is going. I think 
that’s an awesome sign.

Eric Kallman
Executive Creative Director 
Barton F. Graf 9000
Eric Kallman is executive creative director at the relatively new agency, Barton 
F. Graf 9000 (www.bfg9000ny.com), headed by Gerry Graf and based in New 
York. Prior to joining Barton F. Graf 9000 (BFG), Kallman was a copywriter at 
Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, Oregon, where he worked with Craig Allen on cam­
paigns that included the Old Spice campaign, “The Man Your Man Could Smell 
Like.” Kallman was partly responsible for game-changing Skittles and Starburst 
campaigns during his tenure at TBWA/Chiat/Day. Before going to ad school and 
joining TBWA, Kallman studied journalism and was a local NPR host in California.
Tracy Tuten: Tell me about this new role you are playing with BFG. You’re 
in a different situation than the other people I’ve been interviewing because 
you’ve just like jumped off a bridge into a new agency. Tell me about it.
Eric Kallman: Well, it’s Gerry’s thing. I didn’t know what apparently every­
one else had known at the time, which was that Gerry was starting his own 
agency. I didn’t know if it had started or was starting or what really was 
going on. The ﬁrst round of Kayak[.com] commercials done by the agency 
hadn’t come out or anything.1 I was in town [in New York judging the art 
directors’ club show] and we are old friends, so I went to visit him. He was 
at his new ofﬁces. We sat down and he told me what he was doing and that

he had just won Kayak from Goodby. Gerry explained his vision for the 
agency and what he wanted to do, what he was hoping to build. It sounded 
awesome and something I couldn’t say no to.
Tuten: You went to visit Gerry having no idea you were getting a job offer?
Kallman: Yeah, he offered me a job! It wasn’t worded harshly, like, “Leave 
your job now and join me,” [laughter] but yeah, he offered me a job. It 
sounded so exciting. I couldn’t say no.
Tuten: Tell me about the vision for Barton F. Graf 9000.
Kallman: Well, I feel corny using the word “vision.” Gerry had worked at a 
number of large agencies his whole career. I had only been at larger agencies. 
He knew he wanted to do his own thing and build it the way he wanted to 
build it. Most importantly, Gerry wanted to work with the type of people 
and clients that he wanted to work with. People who wanted the type of 
work that he liked to do. Ultimately, what Gerry wanted was right in tune 
with what I would want to do as well, so I decided to join him.
Tuten: Can you tell me what that kind of work is? Is there a philosophy to 
the work?
Kallman: Oh, good work, literally, good work. We want to hopefully work 
with clients who want to make good, creative advertising. Solid, creative adver­
tising. Agencies get so big or they’re so political or they’re owned by bigger and 
more powerful places and the ability to make solid creative advertising can get 
lost in all of that. It can get to a place where you realize that you have to do 
a piece of work a certain way or you go into a project knowing its limitations 
upfront in terms of how good the work could be. We honestly just want to do 
the best work that we possibly can and want to work with people and clients 
who want the most creative and best work. It’s pretty simple.
When you start something new, you cut out all the politics and you create 
the rules and the culture yourselves. I wasn’t looking for a job when this 
happened, and I am not looking now, but it wasn’t until I talked to Gerry that 
I could see what my next step would be. If I didn’t work for Gerry, my next 
job would probably be at the management level at some big agency. I think it 
would have been like being a junior again in a huge pool of creative directors.
What I imagined about moving up to the management level at a big shop, is that 
it must get even less talent-driven and more political. Cutting out all the politics, 
and working hard, and making the best work possible is all we’re going for.
Tuten: How many people are with the agency now?
Kallman: We’re up to twenty-ﬁve.

Advertisers at Work
193
Tuten: Are you worried that as you grow, some of the politics will sneak 
back in, or do you think you can create a culture that will ensure it doesn’t?
Kallman: Well, I’m assuming that the more people working in an agency, the 
more politics will come into play in any situation naturally. But we’re really 
careful with our new hires to make sure that they’re kind and hard-working, 
straightforward, talented people. It’s a quality-control issue as with any 
newer agency or any independent agency starting. So far, so good.
Tuten: Are the new hires coming to you or are you getting a reputation for 
poaching the best in the business?
Kallman: No, well, that’s funny. Our president, Barney Robinson, who was 
the president of Bartle Bogle Hegarty [BBH], left to come over and be the 
president of BFG. He’s fabulous at hiring these wonderful people with amaz­
ing, amazing pedigrees. Our head planner came from Google and the new 
account director on DISH worked at BBH and then at Coca-Cola. All of 
these people are wonderfully smart people with wonderfully smart résumés. 
He brings them over right away.
And then Gerry and I—we’re slower. I think, we’re being very, very picky. 
Our creative department right now is ﬁve people, and they’re all juniors. We 
don’t label them as juniors. It’s not their title, but they’re all recently out of 
school, mostly in their ﬁrst jobs. They’re wonderful, doing great, and hopefully 
learning a lot and getting better and better. Gerry and I need to focus right 
now on bringing in some senior creatives. I don’t know why, but so far, it’s 
not like I’m getting hundreds of books2 in my e-mail inbox or anything. But 
then again, we’re young. We only have a couple of clients. We’re still a small 
agency.
Tuten: It sounds like a really exciting time.
Kallman: We’re very excited.
Tuten: Were you scared?
Kallman: Not scared at all. And I’m not even saying that in any kind of ego­
tistical way. I’m not scared at all just because I really, truly believe it’s going to 
work. Everyone working with us is so talented. Everyone we’ve brought in 
really is so talented. I feel so lucky to get to work with this kind of agency. I 
don’t think it would happen, but if for some reason we went under—I don’t 
think we ever would, but if we did—everyone here could the next day ﬁnd 
2 Portfolios of creative work.

not just a great job, but even a better job, probably wherever they want. 
In that aspect, there’s no fear. Maybe I’m just too dumb, but I just haven’t 
thought about us failing. So far things have been going good, so knock on 
wood.
Tuten: How do you spend your time at work? Are you mostly mentoring?
Kallman: No.
Tuten: Managing, creating?
Kallman: No. It’s crazy. I go from getting a little bit of time to write—but 
that rarely ever happens—to calling the client to reviewing work. I’ve often 
heard creative directors feel like they don’t have enough time to create for 
themselves.
I see that happens more and more and more for me. I used to have a little 
time here and there to write or work on my own or with Gerry. As we 
grow, I’m getting less and less time. The one time I do get to concept and 
write is when the other teams show me work. I’ll get another thought from 
what they’ve presented. I’ll sit there with those creatives and work with 
them and kind of think off of what they’ve brought to me or blow out a new 
idea. It’s my favorite time to work. Obviously, creatives like to work and be 
creative. But besides that, this is really new. I’m not only managing for the 
ﬁrst time, but I’m also at a new agency.
And I’ll go from working with my creative team and then, right after that, we 
have to go look at something else. Like we’ll look at the new glass walls in 
the new ofﬁce or something. Do you see what I mean? We’re like picking out 
desks or something random, and I’m like, “I don’t know. You pick the desks. 
Let’s just make work.” It’s a very unique situation. I’m very aware of how 
unique it is. Every two hours I’m in a totally different place, doing something 
totally different, and some of that time I’m doing creative work, or reviewing 
creative work. Still for me, the creative work is the most fun.
Tuten: How do you mentally prepare yourself for each day?
Kallman: I don’t, actually. I don’t really know when each day will start or 
end. It’s one big kind of blur. The days just go on and on. I just kind of go 
and go until . . . That’s another thing I learned. I’m younger than most of the 
awesome people you’ve been talking to for this book and obviously far less 
experienced in a managerial position. But what I’ve found is that I kind of 
have to pick a point to end my day, if that makes sense.
Tuten: That does make sense.
Kallman: Because there’s so much to do, I could just keep going. I could 
always keep going and never stop on any given day.

Advertisers at Work
195
Tuten: Do you just decide on spur of the moment, or do you start off that 
morning saying, “Today my day will end at eight p.m.” or . . . ?
Kallman: Oh, no. I never put limits on stuff like that. So, yeah, I get in as 
soon as I can and go and go usually until well, I’m tuckered out. It’s pretty 
much a constant and it’s most weekends, too. But, it’s been going well, and 
it’s getting more and more exciting and encouraging with every day. This is 
more than a job for me. I don’t think I could do this if I wasn’t so personally 
invested it.
Tuten: Does it feel like it’s your own shop?
Kallman: Oh, gosh. No, it doesn’t feel like it’s my own shop. Gerry’s the 
boss, but I do feel more a part of it than any other job I’ve had. I don’t feel 
like I’m working under Gerry because there are so few people here. It’s a 
small amount of highly intelligent people who are all working together. Right 
now, that’s the vibe, and there’s no weird hierarchy. No one’s afraid to talk 
to anyone else or express their opinions. It’s a group of really smart people 
who get along really well. I just feel like I’m a part of something that’s gotten 
off on the right foot.
Tuten: That’s a good feeling.
Kallman: Yeah, yeah, it’s great. It’s hard to get. I feel lucky to say that I care 
about this agency, more about its future, this is all more than a job. I think 
that most people aren’t that fortunate.
Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession?
Kallman: In college, I studied journalism. I went to college thinking I wanted 
to be a sportscaster. First, because I love sports and [second,] because sports­
casters seem like they have a ton of fun. “Yeah, that Craig Kilborn, he used to 
be an anchor on Sports Center, and then he got the show after Letterman.” It 
seemed to be a little more entertainment or comedy infused than in most jour­
nalism. So, anyway, I wanted to be a sportscaster. I went to college and I worked 
like nuts. I interned at NPR, and I interned at NBC Sports.
Then after college I landed an awesome ﬁrst job. I was the local morning 
host for NPR’s Morning Edition in Santa Barbara. I did that for a while. But 
I guess what I was learning, throughout all my internships and then my job, 
was that journalism was not for me. I’m not trying to get over the top about 
it, but, really, when you broke it down, instead of doing something with your 
own life, you followed other people around all day and talked about what 
they were doing with their lives. When I interned at NBC Sports, I realized 
it I guess for the ﬁrst time. I love sports, but I quickly realized that the job 
meant talking to other people about what they were doing—and what I 

Chapter 12 |  Eric Kallman: Executive Creative Director, Barton F. Graf 9000
196
wasn’t doing. I hope that doesn’t sound horrible. It was just important for 
me to do something myself, and not just observe others.
Does that make sense?
Tuten: It does.
Kallman: I had this realization about journalism and I quit my job. I moved 
home, to San Francisco, with my mom and grandparents. I was twenty-three 
or something like that. I had to ﬁgure out what to do. While I was home, I 
looked at my old college catalog and noticed the only class I didn’t take as a 
communications major was Intro to Advertising.
And I thought about it. I was like, “Oh, maybe”—I literally thought, “Maybe. 
I see commercials on TV. Some of them are good, but most of them aren’t 
any good. I bet I could come up with stuff at least half as good as that.” So I 
went online and I found the AAAA, the Advertising whatever Association of 
America web site. And I looked up the agency list in San Francisco. At that 
point, I couldn’t tell the difference between Goodby or Joe’s Advertising on 
the corner [laughter]. I just went down the list and I called them all, one by 
one. I said, “Hi, I’m a recent college graduate, and I’m interested . . .” and then 
click. They just hung up on me, time and time and time again.
Finally, I got an in. Some account guy—I believe it was DDB San Francisco. 
Whoever does those Chevron ads with the claymation cars. I put on a suit, 
and I went in, and I met with this guy. He just talked about himself for two 
hours. Seriously, and he talked about the business side. And I said, “Well, what 
about the actual commercials themselves and the ideas behind them. I see 
that you work on Chevron. Who found the idea for the claymation cars?
And he was like, “Oh, that’s the creative department.”
I’m like, “Oh, where are they? How do you do that?”
And he goes, “You have to have a portfolio.”
And I said, “How do you do that?”
And he said, “You do that in ad school.” That was it! As soon as I got home, 
I went online and I found an online ad school in San Francisco. I went there 
for a couple of quarters. And then I went to a different ad school for a short 
while and put together a book. Eventually I went job hunting and luckily I got 
my ﬁrst job with Gerry Graf, at Chiat New York.
Tuten: So it’s like coming home again then to work with Gerry now?
Kallman: Yeah, coming back to the old boss! [Laughter.] Like I said, when 
I learned about the opportunity, I honest to God didn’t know that he was 

Advertisers at Work
197
going to offer me a job. I honest to God didn’t know where he was with 
starting his agency. I was just in town and I was visiting my old boss. I thought 
I was just visiting him to say hi and then it turned into a job offer and, of 
course, more talks later and eventually, it happened. It all worked out.
Tuten: Once you took a look in that old college catalog and you saw Intro 
to Advertising and you started on that path, did you ever stop? You knew it 
was the right thing?
Kallman: No, no, no. Maybe. Well, it struck me as right. Then calling the 
places and getting to go to an ad agency, well then it struck me even more. 
I was like, “Oh, okay, now this is getting interesting.” And then when I found 
my ad school, I sat in on a class there and saw what they did. Basically, I saw 
a bunch of students present concepts to a teacher. Then, I got really excited, 
like, “Wow, I think this is something I’m really interested in.” And then if you 
combined all that with the fact that you’re twenty-three or twenty-four and 
you’re living with your mom and grandparents, you have a very strong, maybe 
more reason to ﬁgure something out and work harder.
But, yes, my curiosity was piqued by that catalog, but it grew and especially 
once I sat in on the class. And then I thought, “Oh my gosh. This is something 
I think might be right up my alley.” Besides being a sportscaster, I couldn’t 
really think of a job for people who get to sit around with their buddies and 
make jokes all day. Let’s just say I was fortunate to ﬁnd this career [laughter.]
I was also fortunate to work so hard at journalism in college to realize it’s 
what I didn’t want to do, if that makes sense. Otherwise I would have been 
trapped. I wouldn’t have started pursuing advertising until so many years 
down the line, and I could have been stuck, if that makes sense.
Tuten: I think a lot of people do feel stuck. They would have to go through 
too much to switch.
Kallman: Yeah. I was fortunate.
Tuten: What advice would you give then to young people today who are 
trying to ﬁgure out what to do with their lives?
Kallman: Whatever you think you might be interested in, you have to fully 
investigate. That is really the best advice. I also think that generally people 
don’t realize how willing other people are to help. You’d be amazed how 
willing people are to help others. If you’re interested in something, you 
should fully explore and investigate it. If that means going to places you 
don’t know or going to people that you care about or whose work you 
respect and asking if you can talk to them, I think people are very willing to 
help. Talking to as many people and doing as much of it as you can as early

as you can will really help you ﬁgure out what you are all about. “Oh, I like 
this aspect or that aspect,” whatever it is about the job. Those kinds of con­
versations can help you narrow down and ﬁnd what’s right for you sooner 
rather than later.
Tuten: Did you have a mentor who was instrumental in how you developed 
in your career?
Kallman: Creatively? My old partner, Craig Allen, is one of the ﬁrst that 
comes to mind. He had been working already for a year, I believe, when I 
got a job at Chiat. What I learned from him while working with him was just 
instrumental for me—I learned so much. I’ll always consider Craig not only 
my partner, but also someone I learned a great deal from, especially in my 
ﬁrst couple of years.
Aside from Craig, I learned much from Gerry. Gerry’s my boss, but now my 
relationship with him is a little bit more like a partnership, not like when I 
was a junior and he was ECD [executive creative director]. Every day, I feel 
like I’m learning. It’s similar to when I ﬁrst started working with Craig and I 
felt I learned a lot every single day I was working. With Gerry now, I’m learn­
ing about managing, about running an agency, about sensing out priorities, 
and so many other things. I feel like I’m learning so much as I work with him.
Tuten: Any lessons you can share with us? About creativity or about 
managing?
Kallman: An important lesson is how to approach new ideas. Once you 
think you’ve thought of a great idea, at least what you believe is a good idea, 
you should get over it really fast. Get over it. Because you need to think of 
a lot more ideas you think are really good until you actually have one, if that 
makes sense.
There are so many different lessons I could share. Different areas to think 
about. If we’re talking about when “concepting” in general, though, the lesson 
is “the more ideas you think of, the more good ones you’ll think of.” And 
always remain open as you move along with an idea, as you’re thinking out 
the idea. As the idea develops, it may develop in a way you didn’t expect. 
Even as the idea moves on into being sold to the client, and then into pro­
duction eventually, it’s easy to get trapped in your own mind. You have to stay 
open to everyone and everything as the idea becomes an ad.
It can harm the idea’s growth if you get trapped in your own mind, if you 
already have in your head what the ad should be like, what it is going to be. 
The idea may grow differently than you imagined, and in a good way.

It’s best to openly collaborate. The more collaboration, the better. And that 
doesn’t mean agreeing with everyone, but that means considering every idea 
that comes along. The majority of the time, I probably disagree with them, 
but something I guess that I’ve learned is that every possible idea shared on 
any aspect of a project coming from any one at any level is something you 
should really be open to and think about. Because there’s going to be some 
good ideas and you wouldn’t want to limit your project or the success of 
what you end up with by being so blinded by your own vision.
It’s important to stay open not only in your writing or when you’re doing 
the concepting part, but also with your production.
Lessons learned: the keys are hard work and staying open and sticking to 
what you’re good at. Maybe I’ve not even ever fully experimented with this 
kind of commitment, but you should—when concepting and working, you 
should. This is probably like Advertising 101 and a “no, duh” truth of the 
business—but, seriously, you need to be true to yourself. A lot of times 
people can get caught up in what’s popular at the moment. I see a lot of ads 
that are like a lot of other ads in tone or style. All the good creatives stay 
true to their own voice and are going to execute on a brief with their own 
voice. But, yeah, just be yourself.
Tuten: Do you have a way of judging the work either that you do or that 
your junior people do and come in and present to you?
Kallman: I do have a way of judging work and it’s by this pattern. Everything 
a) gets weeded out according to whether it answers the brief or not and 
then, b) I look for the best ad. The best ad may not be humorous. Just 
because majority lot of the work I’ve done has been humor and the people 
I’ve learned from like Gerry do a lot of humor, looking for the best work 
doesn’t mean looking for the funniest. It means looking for the best. For 
some people, looking for the best ad may sound so subjective. But you’re 
just looking for the most unique, the breakthrough way, the way to answer 
a brief, to answer it in the right way, to answer the brief with a voice, to 
answer with a voice that you’ve never quite heard before. Uniqueness is 
what stands out and I think it’s what breaks through in any ﬁnished ads that 
you see. The best ad is not only the strongest communication. It’s often 
times the most unique or new. It’s something I’ve never seen before.
Tuten: That would be hard.
Kallman: Yeah. But it’s hard for anyone to come up with something that’s a 
good ad.
Tuten: What was it like to be one of the guys who created “The Man My 
Man Could Smell Like”?

Chapter 12 |  Eric Kallman: Executive Creative Director, Barton F. Graf 9000

Kallman: Oh, man. It was fun. Looking back on it, it happened very fast 
[laughter]. Can I talk about this? Well, I don’t work there anymore, so I can’t 
get in trouble [laughter].
Tuten: That’s right [laughter].
Kallman: I remember Old Spice wanted to do one more spot for the 
body wash, because it wasn’t selling as well as they wanted. They wanted to 
do a single spot and then they planned to discontinue the body wash. We 
had a really short timeline, I want to say three days to write it. Somehow it 
happened.
Tuten: You had the idea already at that point?
Kallman: No, we didn’t. This is actually a good example of how “staying 
open” to what everyone else does in a campaign and around an idea really 
pays off. Old Spice had already established the style and tone and humor in 
its earlier campaigns. We had done a few Old Spice projects already by that 
point. The foundation was already in place. The planner—I don’t know who 
it was—found out that the overwhelming majority of male body wash is 
purchased by females. Of course, that makes perfect sense. The assignment 
was to keep that in mind while doing an ad in the Old Spice comedic tone. 
Basically, do an Old Spice spokesman ad that spoke directly to women.
Whoever it was, I don’t know it if was a strategist at Wieden or someone at 
P&G, but whoever dug up the fact that the smartest way to sell body wash 
for men would be to actually sell the body wash to women should get half 
or more than half the credit for anything. Know what I mean? We had the 
assignment. We worked on the assignment. The script was written.
I remember the script seeming different than what Craig and I usually 
pitched. Usually we have a very strong sense of the visuals involved in a spot. 
When we’re presenting a TV spot, as I would imagine most creatives would, 
we typically have fully envisioned what will be seen in the spot. In this case, 
we had a dialogue script, and we had shown maybe eight or ten other scripts 
to our creative directors. And then when we got to it, I remember we said, 
“We’re not quite sure what you see yet, but we think you see a guy talking 
to the camera and we think you see all this other stuff happening.” Anyway, 
we prefaced it, before we presented it, by saying, “We’re not quite sure what 
you see yet.” Because really what we had written, it was more like a radio 
script when we wrote it. It was only the dialogue.3

old_spice_man_man.

The creative directors liked it, and as we worked on it further, we ﬁgured 
out, “Yeah, you should just pretty much see what this guy’s talking about.” 
The visuals just followed the dialogue.
I’m sorry. This could end up being two hours if I take you start to ﬁnish on 
the whole thing.
Long story short, I think we presented two spots to the client. We liked the 
“The Man You Smell Like” more. The other one sold. There was a regroup 
with the creative directors and our ECD. We went back and sold in “The 
Man Your Man Could Smell Like,” so the project almost died once there. The 
timing was all off too. When we went to make the thing, we did casting on 
Christmas Eve. You usually call in two hundred people for casting and one 
hundred and twenty show up. But because it was Christmas Eve, we barely 
scraped together twenty to forty people. The choices were horriﬁc, and, 
then Isaiah walks in the door and delivers it exactly how you see it. Isaiah 
Mustafa, he’s the actor.
That’s a saving grace. When we went to shoot the thing, we had two days 
and we weren’t anywhere near to having a usable take. The afternoon of the 
second day, it started raining something like a half-hour before the insurance 
ended for a weather day. So we got a third weather day with insurance or 
something like that. It was almost the last take on that third day that became 
the one that ﬁnally worked and that we used.
They weren’t sure about the spot when we ﬁrst presented it to them.
Tuten: They weren’t?
Kallman: Here’s what happened. We presented the spot over the phone. 
They had a link to the ad. They had a roomful of people there. They watched 
it. We hear the spot playing over the phone, and then there’s silence. And 
then they came on and said, “We’re going to put you on mute for a bit.” They 
put us on mute for like ten or ﬁfteen minutes. They came back on, and they 
said they weren’t sure about it.
Now, these are wonderful clients and wonderful people. Everyone likes or 
doesn’t like stuff that ends up being popular sometimes, so I’m not trying 
to diss the clients at all, because they’re great clients. They just weren’t sure 
about how good the ad was. That’s how it ended up being aired after the 
Super Bowl. They had already done the media buy to start it on the Super 
Bowl and keep running the ad after. They decided not to run it on the Super 
Bowl. They started the day after instead. I wasn’t involved in the discus­
sions—but I believe that the higher-ups talked them into running it through 
the rest of the media buy, but not on the Super Bowl. Somehow it ended 

Chapter 12 |  Eric Kallman: Executive Creative Director, Barton F. Graf 9000
202
up catching on ﬁre. It caught ﬁre so quick that it ended up winning a one of 
those Super Bowl polls of what your favorite commercial is, even though it 
never aired in Super Bowl.
The whole deal was just up and down, a roller coaster ride, the whole way 
through production. After we had it ﬁlmed, we weren’t like, “Yes! We’ve done 
it!” We had this idea and we went and made it. It had gone through so much 
and took so much effort. It was over the holidays and the process was so 
draining.
By the time we were done with it and especially because the ﬁrst few people 
who had seen it weren’t over the moon about it, at that point, I was just 
hoping it would be considered “ok.” Every time you want it to be great, 
every time you make an ad or spot, you want it to be great. By the time it 
was about to hit air, I was just hoping people didn’t hate it, honest to God. 
And then, it caught on and we were ﬂoored obviously. It was amazing.
Tuten: It won the top award.
Kallman: Yeah, yeah. It won the Grand Prix for ﬁlm, the Grand Prix at 
Cannes.
Tuten: Do you ever feel like the magic might not happen again?
Kallman: Well, the Grand Prix is just as full of luck as anything. Luck is 
involved. Sometimes things have to come together. We thought it was a cool 
idea and was going to be a good spot. But the huge reaction was over­
whelming. It was similar to when we did the online responses, when we did 
the “Twitter Response” campaign.4
Tuten: I loved that campaign!
Kallman: Thank you. When we went into doing that, literally, it was a team 
from Wieden, a bunch of technical and digital people who had the abili­
ties and could do things and get them online so fast. There were people 
who weeded through all the tweets and were responsible for picking the 
ones that were not only the best ones to respond to as far as getting the 
“response” out there, but also people who had followers and whatnot. 
4 The ﬁrst ad generated much buzz online and on talk shows, including mentions by Ellen 
DeGeneres. The “response” campaign came about when the team realized they could 
feed on the buzz. The campaign was built on the idea that the team would pick tweets 
and comments from social media, and the actor would then “respond” in short videos 
posted on YouTube.

Besides that whole team, there was Isaiah on his little set with a tele­
prompter and then me and Craig on our laptops and our CDs [creative 
directors] there, too, on their laptops.
When it all started, either Craig or I or someone joked something like, 
“Welcome to the hardest work we’ll ever do for maybe a bronze pencil.” It 
was a ton of fun, but it was the same thing as the initial ad, where we had no 
idea that people enjoyed it so much until after the fact! [Laughter.] We really 
didn’t know until we got back to work the next day. We just didn’t know as 
it was going on. We didn’t know that people were talking about it. That it was 
getting so much attention.
We were basically locked in a tiny little set with Isaiah and just typing as fast 
as we could for two days. That was even more shocking! I’ll never forget the 
next day coming into the agency. People were being so kind and congratula­
tory and then we were going online and seeing the buzz the campaign had 
gotten. It was ﬂattering and humbling, but more than all of that, it was wildly, 
wildly surprising.
Tuten: Tell me: what’s your favorite work that was never, ever produced?
Kallman: That was never produced? Oh my God. I think every creative has 
like a handful that come to mind immediately. Hopefully Craig or I will be 
able to use the really good ideas again . . . for some other client down the 
road.
Tuten: So that’s what you want to do? You want to write TV commercial 
scripts instead of ads?
Kallman: Yeah. A couple were bigger, event-style things. Those are the 
types of ideas that would be shot down for reasons beyond creativity—
like for their expense. Sometimes the client loves an idea, but the expense 
of executing the idea ultimately kills the idea. The realities of expense 
always come into play. Still, there’s not a creative in the world—there’s 
not a good creative in the world—who doesn’t have, like, ﬁve ads that pop 
straight to the top of their mind. Actually, that are always on their mind, 
that they love—that they keep on their mind as the best things ever that 
never got made.
Tuten: You worked so closely with Craig. Do you miss him? I was wonder­
ing if you did because he’s someone you worked so closely with.
Kallman: Of course I do. I MISS CRAIG. Put that in the book really bold. 
It’s rare for anyone to have partners for ﬁve or six years at any level. And 
Craig was my ﬁrst real partner. We were fortunate enough to produce a ton 
of work, and good work. When I think about it, it was like we spent forever 

Chapter 12 |  Eric Kallman: Executive Creative Director, Barton F. Graf 9000

together. We basically lived together in LA the whole time we were at Chiat 
New York. And especially our three years in Portland, I think I spent over a 
year and a half of it with him in LA, so—yeah. I miss my friend.
Tuten: Do you ever feel like you need to just call him up and just run 
through some ideas with him?
Kallman: Actually, the ﬁrst ideas that I CD’ed [creatively directed] at 
Gerry’s place, at Barton F. Graf 9000—it was like two days before the pre­
sentation and I sent him the work. Obviously, I wish I could do that every 
time. I was so excited about it, and a little bit nervous since it was my ﬁrst 
work as a creative director.
It was the ﬁrst time in my life that I was getting to make a call like that. I got 
to make the ﬁnal decision. I was just excited to hear his opinion about what 
he thought of the work. Would he say, “Oh, it sucks. Is there only one good 
script out of all of these?” and that kind of thing. Obviously, I always trust 
that guy’s opinion.
Tuten: But just the one time?
Kallman: That’s the only time. It was right before my ﬁrst presentation. It 
was half nervousness, half excitement, half “where’s Craig?” [Laughter.]
Tuten: Some people might have thought that you and he would open your 
own shop together.
Kallman: Oh God! That would have been fun. I’m having a lot of fun now, 
too. I wish Craig came out here with us, with Gerry. Portland was a fabulous 
time.
Tuten: What things in the industry surprise you most?
Kallman: What doesn’t surprise me? You know what doesn’t surprise me 
are people’s acceptance and excitement and enthusiasm and focus on all 
things digital. But what blows my mind is a lot of the enthusiastic people are 
saying, “This is a great new world and a whole new skill set to learn”—[to 
the exclusion of traditional forms of advertising].
Think about it. When the radio was developed, print ads did not disappear. 
When television was introduced, radio ads did not disappear. It’s the same 
with television today. Whichever media being used, it’s just another skill set, 
another tool to learn. I didn’t work in advertising when these other media 
forms were introduced, so I don’t really know how the industry reacted 
when TV came along. But I’m pretty sure that they didn’t say “Hey, we have 
this great new medium. Forget everything you know about how to use the 
old ones because they are dead now.”

Advertisers at Work
205
I feel like people should be excited about new media and wanting to learn 
about working on digital, social, and interactive as much as possible, but that 
doesn’t have to mean abandoning the skills needed to execute a print ad or 
a thirty-second TV commercial because no matter what anyone’s good at or 
likes doing, I’ll bet my life that in ten years I will still be watching live sports 
on TV every night, and those live sports will still have timeouts and there will 
still be television commercials or advertisements of some sort. So the whole 
excitement and rage about digital advertising and interactive advertising, it 
surprises me how separate it is in some people’s minds. Do you know what I 
mean? And even the fact that the One Club has the One Show and then the 
next night has the One Show Interactive. To me, that’s bizarre. They’re all ads. 
They’re all competing creativity.
Tuten: They’re all one.
Kallman: In advertising, I think it’s kind of appalling that there’s two differ­
ent awards shows for interactive and non-interactive work. I think it should 
be the same show. It seems to be a bit of rivalry or whatever. People who do 
one thing think the other isn’t relevant. That’s always been confusing to me.
Tuten: If you had a magic, fairy wand and you could change one thing about 
advertising, what would it be? Is that what it would be?
Kallman: Well, I would change people’s mindset. There will be more and 
more digital and interactive advertising in the future. I’m sure there will be. 
And, other mediums might digress some, but “traditional advertising” on TV 
isn’t dead just because there’s something new to learn and advertise with, if 
that makes sense. So, yeah, that mindset has always been really confusing to 
me. It just doesn’t make sense.
Tuten: Eric, if you were going to write an autobiography, what would it be 
called?
Kallman: “I Was Born at a Young Age.” That would be the ﬁrst line. That 
would be the ﬁrst line of the ﬁrst chapter. I don’t know [laughter]. I don’t 
think I would write an autobiography. I’m actually afraid to answer your 
question because I feel like it could come off like I’m a real a-hole. I work a 
lot. Maybe that would be the same thing. What would my wife call the book? 
“My Husband Works a Lot.”
Tuten: “Just Keep Working.”
Kallman: Yeah, yeah. “I Worked a Lot: The Life of Eric Kallman.”
Tuten: So in all of the long hours that you work, what’s your favorite bever­
age Kallman, Eric:beverage of choice to keep you going?

Chapter 12 |  Eric Kallman: Executive Creative Director, Barton F. Graf 9000

Kallman: I can’t do the coffee too late because that’s just crazy even 
though I do. I was a big, big Diet Coke man forever, and then I started work­
ing with Gerry. Gerry loves Coke Zero. Like he has a deep-rooted passion 
for it, and I was like, “Really?” And then I made a big, a big life choice. So now 
I’m a Coke Zero guy. Caffeine works.
Tuten: It does. Is there a brand that you’re longing to produce work for?
Kallman: One that hasn’t had famous ads done for it yet?
Tuten: Or maybe that has had famous ads, but you just want to work on 
that work or build that brand.
Kallman: When I was coming out of school, the ﬁrst Skittles campaign, the 
ﬁrst of the new work that was done by Gerry Graf had just come out. And I 
was like, “Oh my gosh, that is what I want to do.” And if you ever look at my 
early portfolio, my student portfolio was almost like a Skittles ad for every­
thing. It was like a Skittles ad for shoe polish, a Skittles PSA [public service 
announcement] about don’t hurt your children. Everything I did was maybe 
along those lines, that tone, that style. And so basically I am a schmuck who 
was lucky enough to get my way in to the business and get to work on stuff 
I wanted to work on right away. Lucky.
Coming out of school I was like, “I want to work on that campaign, I want 
to work on that campaign.” And then I was lucky enough to work on that 
campaign. Since then, I’m a big believer of working for people whose work 
you like, not necessarily on a certain product or at a certain agency. Does 
that make sense?
If you’re lucky enough to get to work with the people whose work you 
respect and like the most, you’ll learn the most. And I think you’ll probably 
have the greatest chance that they’ll like your work the most, too, if that 
makes sense. When I ﬁnished ad school, I looked for a job, and I was a little 
anal. And I made an A, B, C, and D list of all the agencies that I wanted to 
work for, with like the A list being, “I would love to work there,” and then 
B, C, D. Well, when I mailed out my portfolio, I mailed it out to the A list 
ﬁrst and two weeks later to the B list and then one week later to the C list. 
Like that, in my mind, I’m thinking that it would maybe get it in front of the 
people I wanted to work for the most the earliest. I would let them decide if 
they like my work or not and could use my services or not ﬁrst.
And here’s my long-winded point because everything I’ve had to say has 
been long-winded today. I thought for sure that the D list, my last choice of 
places, would be the people who might actually offer me a job. And I thought 
my A-list people would be the people who liked my work the least because, 
in my mind, they were the best people.

Advertisers at Work
207
As it turns out, advertising is really not about being the best or worst. The 
whole industry is subjective. If you work for someone whose work you like 
the most, there’s the greatest chance that they like your work or style or 
work or tone the most as well. In ﬁnding that match of views and interests, 
you’ll not only learn the most, you’ll get the most work produced. You’ll also 
be working for the people who you like the most. So the biggest, surprising 
thing when I came out of school was that I got the strongest response to my 
book from the people that I wanted to work for the most, and not just in 
one instance. I got to talk to the four or ﬁve people whose work I admired 
the most, I got the jobs I wanted the most at the agencies I respected the 
most. I was lucky. I got to work with people like Craig and Gerry from the 
very beginning.
Tuten: You are. You were lucky. And you still are, but hardworking, too.
Kallman: I’m very lucky, yes. I’ll be the ﬁrst to tell you that, but, yeah, I work 
hard, too. Yeah, I work hard. Luck and hard work.

Craig Allen 
Creative Director 
Wieden+Kennedy
Craig Allen is a creative director at  Wieden+Kennedy (www.wk.com) in Portland, 
Oregon. He earned fame and recognition as an art director/copywriter, working for 
the last several years with partner Eric Kallman on accounts such as Old Spice’s 
“The Man Your Man Could Smell Like.”  Allen’s early work in the industry was at 
TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, where he (with Kallman) became known for their 
innovative work for Skittles. In 2010,  Allen and Kallman were named among 
Creativity magazine’s top 50 creatives in the industry.
Tracy Tuten: How did you come to be in advertising? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in the ﬁeld?
Craig Allen: No, I didn’t grow up wanting to be in advertising. Actually, 
I think I grew up wanting to draw comic books or maybe be a rock star! 
[Laughter.] When I think back, those dreams quickly faded due to personal 
talent problems. It turns out whether you want to be an illustrator or a 
rock star, personal talent is required! But, no, seriously, I went to school 
at University of Texas at Austin. I went to art school there. I had two con­
centrations. One focus was in ceramics, surprisingly enough, and the other 
in photography. About halfway through school, I realized I had the urge to 
design product packaging. I was drawn to it. I didn’t know I wanted to do 
advertising, but I knew I wanted to do something, so I took the Introduction 
to Advertising course at UT–Austin on a whim. From there, I just kept going. 
I ended up double-majoring in studio art and advertising. But still, even after 
the double major, I really didn’t know what I wanted to do.

Tuten: You had some clue though—you knew to double major. Some people 
ﬁnd out well after school.
Allen: I know. Yeah, luckily, I didn’t graduate and then ﬁnd out. Thankfully 
UT–Austin had a great advertising program.
UT–Austin happened to have one of the best undergraduate advertising 
programs around. I didn’t choose to go there for advertising. I just kind of 
lucked out. Plus, I actually graduated with a book.1 That is pretty rare in 
advertising. Usually, you have to go to graduate school or a portfolio school 
to ﬁnish your book, so I was lucky in that I went right out of undergraduate 
school straight into advertising. I think I was twenty-three. A lot of people 
go to portfolio centers and programs designed to help you get your book 
together. By the time they hit the market, they are twenty-six, twenty-seven.
Honestly, I think no one has any idea what they’re doing when they start 
advertising. When I started, in many ways, I started fresh, like an open book. 
I think that was good. I actually went straight to Chiat/Day in New York. I 
accepted a role in the Young Bloods program—a six-month internship. At the 
end of the six months, they hired a bunch of us on. And then I worked there 
for ﬁve years.
Tuten: You worked at TBWA/Chiat/Day and now Wieden+Kennedy. That’s 
not bad coming straight out of undergrad.
Allen: Yeah, I’ve only had two jobs. I’ve just happened to have lucked into 
working for very smart people, you know. At Chiat, I was able to work under 
Gerry Graff, Ian Reichenthal, and Scott Vitrone. I think they are some of the 
best scriptwriters in advertising today. I kind of just lucked into them. You 
know what they did for me? Through blood, sweat, and tears, they taught me 
how to write TV spots. I lucked into advertising and then I lucked into Chiat. 
Chiat was evolving around me. It evolved into a very super-creative shop.
Tuten: You sound very pro-Chiat!
Allen: Yeah, I know. I think that’s my downfall. I’m probably a little too loyal. 
But seriously, it’s just like I said: I’ve just been lucky to fall into these great 
places. I don’t know if there are many better places to work other than 
Chiat New York and Wieden+Kennedy in Portland. I think I’m the luckiest 
guy in advertising.
1 Portfolios are sometimes referred to as books; for a creative, a book is akin to a 
résumé illustrating his or her own work and scope of capabilities. Many aspiring creatives 
go to a portfolio school in order to ﬁnish a book. It’s unusual for an undergraduate stu­
dent to graduate with a book of any consequence.

Tuten: What’s it been like losing your partner? Since Eric Kallman has gone 
to work at Gerry Graf’s new shop in New York?
Allen: You know, it’s always a little bit difﬁcult when you’re changing. I miss 
working with Eric for sure. The hardest thing in advertising, I think, is ﬁnding 
somebody you can work with because it’s a very weird process. You have to 
be open. When you work with someone new, you’re opening yourself up and 
then you’re asking the other person if they think what you created is funny. 
It’s hard to ﬁnd partners.2 I’ve only had two partners, I think, or maybe three 
at most, in my whole career. When I ﬁnd somebody that I like and I’m com­
fortable working with, I tend to stick with them as long as possible. It’s easier 
than bouncing around from partner to partner. Once you get a copacetic 
feel for how two people work together, it can be so valuable. Eric was my 
last partner. It was so fun working with him. We’re still good friends. I’m really 
excited for him at Gerry’s place, and I think he’ll do great things there. But, 
you know, he moved away from town, and anytime you lose a friend, well, it 
just sucks. Hopefully we’ll get to work together again someday.
Tuten: The two of you worked together a long time.
Allen: Yeah, It was a great run and I’m thankful for it. It seems like to me 
there are not a lot of fantastic people in the business. When you ﬁnd some­
one great, you ought to stick with them as long as you can. There were no 
hard feelings or anything, luckily, with Eric. For us, it was just simply that he 
wanted to move back to New York and I didn’t.
Tuten: Do you have a new partner?
Allen: Actually, the creative director on Old Spice is now my partner, so one 
of the guys moved off to a different brand. I’m working with another creative 
director who also worked on Old Spice, so he already knows the brand. 
Becoming a creative director is a totally different job than writing ads. It’s 
much more management, which I’m kind of learning now. But with this new 
person, new for me, it’s great that he already knows the brand. Everything 
runs more smoothly.
Tuten: You are doing some creative directing now? How is that different 
from your role before?
Allen: It’s totally different from before. Before someone would say, “Here’s 
the brief. Come up with some good ads.” Now, as a creative director, it’s 
2 Creatives typically team up. A copywriter and an art director, when teamed over time, 
refer to themselves as partners.

Chapter 13 |  Craig Allen : Creative Director,  Wieden+Kennedy
212
“Here’s the brief. Is the brief okay? Who should we put on this brief?” And 
then we begin trying to match the right team to the brief, and get great ads 
out of the team.
Tuten: What is that like? Moving from a creative team to directing other 
creatives? Is it scary?
Allen: Yeah, of course, it’s scary. I think any time there’s change, it’s scary, but 
it’s kind of exciting, you know? Just change to me is exciting. I hate repetition, 
so it’s kind of nice. It’s a new challenge, and I feel like I’m just starting over in 
my career. It’s an amazing feeling to know that I’m doing something now that 
I’ve never done before. In this new job, it’s kind of like starting from scratch 
with no work behind me. It’s been challenging just because it’s a new job. 
Plus I really enjoy writing and making ads. I miss spending time making the 
work, for sure, because obviously I don’t do as much of it now as a creative 
director. Some days I feel like I spend the day not really knowing what to do, 
while other people come up with the ads and then ask me if I like them. It’s 
been deﬁnitely challenging for me, but I’m getting the hang of it now, I think.
Tuten: Does it feel as though you are mentoring the creatives? Or is it 
more like managing them?
Allen: I don’t know if I’d call it mentoring, but it’s also different from manag­
ing. We have a bunch of senior people here, but everybody has their own 
kind of style and tone of voice. We each bring something to the table. It is 
very interesting to see how my style and tone meshes with that of the cre­
atives I work with, especially as I try to teach them whatever I can. They’re 
learning what I like as well. You could say we’re kind of learning each other. It 
is a fun process.
But, besides that, there is deﬁnitely mentoring. Luckily, at Wieden, there 
just aren’t any bad people in the building. We are always working with good 
people. For the young people, we are working with them, molding them, 
teaching them, just as I was molded as I developed.
Tuten: You are passing along the lessons you learned from your own men­
tors and past creative directors?
Allen: Yeah, exactly. I’m trying to remember all the good lessons and then 
teach the younger creatives as if the lessons were my own. That way I seem 
smarter [laughter]. Actually, at the end of the day, even reviewing these les­
sons is a beneﬁt to me. It might be the best thing.
Tuten: What is a typical day like for you?
Allen: You know, that’s what I love about advertising. No two days are the 
same, which works really well for me. I really like a hectic work environment. 

Advertisers at Work
213
I thrive on it and that’s pretty much the state of the advertising business all 
the time.
Tuten: How do you stay up-to-date on what’s happening in the industry? All 
of the things you need to know to be current?
Allen: If I have a recipe for success—if that even exists—I read a lot of 
ESPN and Longhorn football blogs, then I follow that up with celebrity news 
web sites for some reason. I’m not proud of that. And I also like funny viral 
videos. I try to do this every day. I come in and catch up on what’s going on. 
I don’t watch a lot of TV, but my wife watches a lot. For me, just living and 
being outside and getting out a lot matters for soaking up what’s current. I 
try to keep in tune with as much stuff as I can, but I by no means watch a 
ton of television. I hate reality television, so that’s probably the main reason.
Tuten: Do you have a ritual that’s important to your ability to create? 
Something you use when you are ideating?3 
Allen: As far as how I create, I wish what I did sounded “cooler” but sadly, 
my process is just sitting in complete quiet until I think of a good idea. When 
Eric and I would go into concepting sessions, everybody would always say 
it looked like we were sad or ﬁghting with each other. For our sessions, we 
would basically just sit in a room, staring at each other in complete silence 
until we had something funny to say. I wish it were cooler. I’d love to tell you 
that we just turned on some good rock music and played ping-pong to get 
our creative juices ﬂowing, but that doesn’t work for me as well.
Yeah, for me, concepting means sitting there in a quiet space and going 
through everything in my head. When I was younger, this process took much 
longer than it does now. As you get older and more experienced, it becomes 
easier to run through the ideas and shoot holes in them on your own. 
Before we even share concepts, we can be running through things in our 
head, thinking “Ahh, that’s not good because of this or that.” Even as a team, 
there’s a lot of pruning that can happen before we share with each other.
Tuten: What’s the process like? How do you share and review ideas in a ses­
sion? Are you recording yourselves so you can play back what you said?
Allen: No, but we usually have some kind of pad of paper. We’ll think and 
think and when we ﬁnally have something to share, I’ll say it or he’ll say it, 
and then we’ll laugh. If we laugh, then we write that down, and then we’ll go 
3 Ideation is the term used in the industry for the phase of the creative process focused 
on the development of concepts and ideas.

Chapter 13 |  Craig Allen : Creative Director,  Wieden+Kennedy
214
to the next thing. We try not to dwell too much, especially in the beginning 
of the process. To dwell too much on any individual idea in the concepting 
stage limits what we are able to come up with. And concepting is just more 
about quantity. Later, we’ll come back and revisit the ideas that made it down 
on paper. Usually, at that stage there will be three or four ideas that stick 
out and we’ll say, “Okay, there’s something here.” But the beginning of the 
creative process is all just about getting it down and getting through the bad 
ideas. This is one of the key lessons I share with my creatives now. I tell them: 
the ﬁrst round or two is just writing all the stuff that you probably shouldn’t 
be writing.
Tuten: You have to pick all the low-hanging fruit and then purge it to get to 
the good stuff?
Allen: Exactly. And it’s not easy. When you are working, there will be ideas 
thrown out in concepting that you like. It’s funny. You’ll be tempted by some 
of those ideas. But if you take a break from the work, get some distance, and 
then a few days later, even a week later, come back to the ideas, and you’ll 
say, “Oh, that was horrible.”
Tuten: Do you leave spare time to distance yourself from the work? 
Systematically plan in the time to be able to step away and then come back 
to see if the idea still resonates?
Allen: It depends on the project, but with Eric, we would always do “the 
overnight test.” If there was something that we were really excited about, 
we’d end on that idea and then we would go home, and try not to keep 
thinking about it overnight. When we came back in the morning, we could 
better evaluate the idea. A lot of times, we’d come back the morning after, 
and I would be like, “Oh, man, this is not as good as I remember it being.” Or 
sometimes it is good. It can go both ways. That’s why the overnight test is an 
important one. At least do the overnight test. If there’s more time, that’s ﬁne 
too, but you may have a couple of weeks to concept, but you may have less. 
Sometimes a week, sometimes two days.
Tuten: In your role as creative director, are you helping people sift through 
the good and the bad? Or are they doing their own purging before the con­
cepts are shown to you?
Allen: I hope that the teams have already cleared through the bad them­
selves. As a creative, I would always evaluate and throw out work myself 
so that I could be certain that the ideas I was bringing before my creative 
directors were good before I showed the work. We always try to tell them, 
“Bring your best stuff. Don’t bring, like, ﬁve hundred scripts that you know 
aren’t good. Bring the stuff that you know is great.” In our standard process, 

Advertisers at Work
215
we have a couple check-ins for each assignment. This gives us time to push 
people to do more with their ideas or set work aside for a while if that’s 
what is needed. We can encourage them and say, “Keep going,” and try to 
push the work forward. As I was developing, I learned that doing a lot of 
work is simply the best way to go. Repetition—writing, writing, writing—
produces the best work. That’s how I kind of learned. It’s like just beating the 
good scripts out of yourself.
Tuten: Beating the scripts out?
Allen: Yeah, a mental mind beating.
Tuten: You are talented at humor especially. How do you know when some­
thing is going to be funny? Especially funny to a lot of people.
Allen: You know, it’s so weird—advertising is so weird, and pop culture is 
about one hundred bajillion times weirder. I wish I could understand pop cul­
ture. To pretend I understand pop culture would be a massive overstatement. 
But I see stuff all the time and think to myself, “Really? That’s what’s popular? 
Oh, man, I do not get it.” I think everybody does that to some extent, in 
response to some things. Then you can see other stuff and you’re like, “That’s 
hilarious.” At the end of the day, we just always try to write the best stuff we 
can and make ourselves laugh.
Usually, if I’m laughing, something is working. I’m pretty hard on myself and 
pretty hard on everybody else around me. I push to come up with good 
stuff. If we’re laughing, there’s a good point. At least we like it, and from there, 
it’s a leap of faith. You just put the work out there and you kind of hope for 
the best.
I think anytime you start out writing for pop culture, you’re in trouble. You 
can’t set out to be funny on a grand scale. You can’t begin writing with the 
notion of let’s write something that will go viral on the internet. We never 
wrote any ads from the perspective of, “I think this would do really well on 
the internet.” You just write and when you look back at the work and think, 
“This is really funny,” you move forward. Then you try to go to a good direc­
tor and you try to shoot the best ﬁlm you can and come out the other side 
with something you think is funny and put it out there. For every ad that I’ve 
had that’s been successful, I’ve had three or four that I thought were just as 
funny that weren’t successful at all.
You think every idea you come up with is great because you came up with 
them. That’s the nature of advertising. And I think that’s true of everything 
creative. So there have been spots that I did earlier in my career that were 
successful enough, but I was like, “Oh, this one’s going to do just fantastic.” 

Chapter 13 |  Craig Allen : Creative Director,  Wieden+Kennedy
216
And you put it out there and people are like, “That’s weird. I don’t like it.” 
I just don’t think there’s any way to tell. I will say that for any of our most 
successful spots, they came from a stack of ten to twelve scripts. And we 
like them. We like all of them. We’ve never presented a script and been like, 
“This is the one. This one is going to really ignite pop culture on ﬁre.” That 
has simply never happened. For the successful spots, we probably liked those 
scripts no more or less than the next three behind it. They would have all 
made us laugh. Some scripts you really like and you hope that they will be 
produced and be successful. But, it’s just funny because you never really 
know what’s going to catch on or how people are going to react.
Tuten: Do you usually test scripts to decide which one to produce? 
Allen: It’s different for every account. You know, I’ve been lucky that we 
haven’t tested much for the accounts I’ve worked on in my career. I haven’t 
done a lot of testing. Sometimes we do testing afterwards, which is great 
because you can use the ﬁlm. If you are testing with a storyboard, you’re 
trying to explain to the people involved, “On paper, this doesn’t look that 
funny, but we swear it’s going to be really funny when we shoot it.” You know, 
they’re kind of taking a leap of faith when you can actually shoot it and come 
to them and say, “See? It is funny.” And then they actually think it’s funny. In 
testing, people always react better when you have ﬁnished spots as opposed 
to little drawings that come one after another with voiceover on top of 
them. I’ve worked with clients that test a lot, and I’ve worked with clients 
that don’t test as much.
I’m sure there are beneﬁts to testing, but I ﬁnd that the best work comes 
from not having to test before because the participants are reacting to 
something that’s not made. It’s not a true test. For instance, take the Skittles 
“beard” spot, for instance.4 The message is very subtle. On paper, it’s just a 
drawing of a beard feeding a woman Skittles. When the idea is depicted on 
paper, I can’t imagine it would test very well. At best, people might say, “That’s 
weird.” But once you see it fully executed, you’re like, “Oh, that’s actually not 
as weird as I thought. It’s funny.” So, overall, testing afterward is much more 
beneﬁcial than testing before, I think.
Tuten: How can you know what’s going to be perceived as funny? Especially 
if you aren’t testing.
Allen: That’s an interesting question. Everybody has a different sense of 
humor. We can present stuff that makes us laugh. We may think it’s hilarious.

But then we’ll go present it to our creative directors and they’re not laugh­
ing. When we leave, we’re thinking, “How did they not think that’s funny?” 
It’s just that advertising is probably the most subjective business you can 
be in outside of art or music. It’s just so subjective. During my ﬁrst job at 
Chiat, we had some of the hardest creative directors to please, Scott, Ian, 
and Gerry. We wrote so many scripts. Round after round after round after 
round of scripts to come up with one spot. But that was a great ﬁrst job 
because by the end of it, I had learned a really valuable lesson. You can’t be 
too precious with the ads. That’s what I learned and I was lucky to learn it 
early on.
We have creatives that come in all the time with one script, and they’re just 
so passionate about it. If as a creative director, I don’t respond to the script 
in the way they thought I would, they will be crushed. It’ll take them a day or 
two to recover. That’s the worst thing one can do for developing the cre­
ative process. That’s how people get stuck. At Chiat, I learned to move. You 
develop a set of scripts and you just know that the creative directors are 
going to go through them like, “No, yes, no, no, no, yes, no,” and, “Okay, next 
one.” Of course, you’re a little hurt because you put your soul into creat­
ing something and you believed it was really funny. But you cannot be too 
precious with the ads. You have to learn to move on. If the ads become too 
precious, well—it’ll be hard.
That said, I’m still very passionate about my work and my ideas. When things 
don’t sell that I wish would sell, I’m upset. But you can’t let it ruin your 
whole day. You can’t let that disappointment stiﬂe what could come next.
Tuten: Do you ﬁnd that as a creative director you are mostly working with 
ideas based on humor?
Allen: I do work mostly with humor, but I like to think that I’m good at 
other things as well. And I’ve worked on other brands that are maybe not as 
humorous. I like to challenge myself. I’d like to do something that’s maybe not 
funny at all. It’s good as a creative to step outside your comfort zone every 
now and again, even though it’s scary and terrifying. But it’s also exciting.
Though, here’s the thing. No matter what kind of concept I’m working with, 
I always try to think that story is king. Whether it’s humor or some other 
focus, I always try to include an element of story in the script. That’s where 
this work gets really fun—to be able to tell a story in thirty or forty-ﬁve or 
sixty seconds. The story is what people respond to. Even though it seems 
like I’m always working with humor, I’m really working with storytelling. You 
know, I would love to do more with long-form scripts. I’ve dabbled in longer-
form work, and I would like to do more. It’s super scary because it’s longer, 
but that’s why it’s so exciting to me.

ing upon whether the context applies to their experiences, the ad may not 
make sense to them. Sometimes it’s simply that humor doesn’t translate at 
all. Some cultures are just serious cultures. North America is becoming a 
smaller market. The world market comparatively is becoming more impor­
tant and it becomes more critical for brands to speak with a global message. 
It affects our work.
Tuten: Is testing more important then, when the advertising is being made 
for a global market?
Allen: Yes, it is. In a North American market, there’s less risk that what you 
ﬁnd funny won’t be to the target audience. But with global, you make some­
thing you think is funny and then you have to test it. And you may have to 
test it in several different markets. Sometimes a product is new in country 
A, but in country B it’s been around forever. There are so many issues you 
may be dealing with. We try to take trips over to experience the cultures 
we are targeting. Whatever [the country or region] the work is for, we try 
to go there and immerse ourselves in the culture so we can understand at 
least a little bit, but ultimately, you only know a culture by living in it for a 
long period of time. There are certain things that are just impossible for us 
to know.
Tuten: What a great beneﬁt of the job—to experience so many different 
places. To learn so much about different cultures.
Allen: Right. Yeah, totally. The travel can be great. We’re just about to begin 
tours of several different places, but so far I’ve been to Morocco, Paris, 
Thailand, London, and Sweden. I missed a China trip, which would have been 
really cool. But there are more places coming up soon. Everything feels really 
foreign to me because I’ve never been to these places. I’ve never been to 
Russia or South America. Part of me thinks that at our core, people are the 
same and we will think the same things are funny. To a point, I think I’m right, 
but there are just so many things that do not translate.
Tuten: How are you managing technology? Do you have creative technolo­
gists on your teams?
Allen: Well, as far as technology goes, luckily Wieden+Kennedy hired some 
of the best digital technologists. They keep us up-to-date. Some people seem 
to assume that if you aren’t a digital native, then you can’t do digital. That’s 
just not true. Good ideas are good ideas. The question is, where do you put 
those ideas? How do you execute those ideas? Our job is to develop the 
ideas and then we can work with the digital technologists to ask what’s pos­
sible or what could be done with the idea that we hadn’t yet imagined. We 
ask them questions like, “Will this make the internet explode by accident?” 

Chapter 13 |  Craig Allen : Creative Director,  Wieden+Kennedy
220
Most of the time, we’ll ask a question and the answer will be “Actually, that’s 
very possible,” or a lot of the times, “That’s not possible at all, but you could 
do [blank] instead.”
The relationship with technology is collaborative. If you combine a great 
creative mind and a great digital mind, the digital mind will know executional 
possibilities that the creative may not have heard of, but the digital mind may 
not have the practice of disciplined creative for developing stories. You asked 
me about keeping up with industry news. The technologists keep up with the 
latest advances and that’s not something creatives dedicate time to doing.
What you have to remember is that a good idea is still going to be a good 
idea. It’s just ﬁnding out where it ﬁts best. A lot of times we’ve written a 
campaign thinking it’s going to be TV, and we realize, “Actually, this is really 
cool. It’s a completely digital campaign.” And, starting from maybe digital 
thinking as opposed to TV or maybe TV as opposed to digital—I think 
switching up the potential media focus keeps the campaigns different from 
one another as well.
Tuten: Is this tied to the Wieden+Kennedy philosophy? Focusing on the 
ideas? Some shops tend to be known for digital, or print, or TV. Is Wieden all 
about the idea?
Allen: The philosophy here is pretty tremendous in that the focus really is 
on the idea. I mean, every agency is saying, you know, “Ideas come ﬁrst,” but 
here they actually do. It’s refreshing, especially as a creative, to experience a 
culture where ideas are meant to thrive above all else.
Every agency will say the ideas are the top priority but it doesn’t always 
happen. Why does it happen here? I think it’s probably because this agency is 
independent. Most agencies are part of a big holding company and there will 
always be someone above that a creative must answer to. At an independent 
agency, there just aren’t as many people to satisfy as the idea makes its way 
through the process. The big men in suits hiding in the clouds don’t exist 
here. Here Dan [Wieden] sits upstairs, and at the end of the day, he can 
make the ﬁnal call without a lot of repercussions.
One of the sayings here is “fail harder.”5 “Don’t be afraid to fail” is an impor­
tant philosophy here. For me, it’s kind of amazing because there aren’t many 
businesses where failing is actually encouraged. Especially when you’re com­
ing up with work, if you are afraid of failing, you become so afraid of screw­
5 At the Wieden+Kennedy Portland ofﬁce, a wall of 100,000 pushpins spells out the 
words “Fail Harder.” One red pushpin lives among the 99,999 others.

221
ing up, so afraid of someone yelling at you, that the work is stiﬂed. You can 
come up with a lot better work and innovative work when you’re not afraid. 
When you are free of the fear of failing. There are many times where some­
body doesn’t agree with a path an idea is taking and the creative team will be 
nervous. Here it’s more likely that we’ll end up saying, “You know, let’s just go 
for it.”
If you’re doing any kind of creative work the right way, you’re always a little 
bit scared and you’re always kind of forging ahead and doing things that make 
you a little bit nervous. If you’re not, you’re probably not doing anything 
good. One thing we do to kind of test the boundaries is to use our account 
team for research. We go in and we present the account folks an ad. If they 
just laugh and say, “That’s good,” it scares us. We must not have pushed 
the boundaries. We played it too safe. But when we go in and the account 
people say, “Oh, no,” and they start acting like they are actually nervous that 
we might present the work to the client, that’s when we know we’ve done 
something pretty interesting. When they react with a kind of confused terror, 
that’s good work.
Tuten: Have they ﬁgured out that their words of afﬁrmation are the oppo­
site for you? Do they know you really want to extract terror? [Laughter.]
Allen: Yeah, I think they do. One time we told them. We said, “If you guys 
don’t say ‘please tell us you aren’t pitching this,’ then we know we haven’t 
done a good job.” And you can tell if they’re faking it or whatever [laughter].
No, you can tell. If you do it right, their reaction is just like, “Oh my gosh, can 
we even do that?” Well, I feel like when you’re asking the question, “Can we 
even do that in any medium?” it’s probably good, especially in today’s world, 
where everything’s a piece of entertainment and you’re going online with 
TV spots, and you’re competing against sites where comedians write funny 
videos. You should always be scaring yourself a little bit.
Tuten: Is pushing yourself beyond what’s comfortable something that comes 
naturally to you or did you learn it?
Allen: You know, I probably did learn it, but I didn’t realize I was learning it 
through my experiences. I’ve had creative directors and executive creative 
directors who didn’t like anything that wasn’t completely crazy. Over time, 
I guess I learned to write work that way and I also learned to assess my 
work on my own. Part of that assessment is knowing the work needs to 
beat something else. I think I honor that philosophy, but I didn’t realize I had 
it, that it was a part of me, until I got to a new place and wasn’t working for 
those bosses anymore.

Chapter 13 |  Craig Allen : Creative Director,  Wieden+Kennedy
222
Tuten: Are you doing the same for those teams you direct now?
Allen: Yeah, I think so. I tell the creatives here all the time, “I want you to 
scare me. I want you to do something that makes me ask, ‘How did they 
think of that?’”
Tuten: Do you think about opening your own shop some day?
Allen? That’s the dream, right? I think that’s supposed to be the dream at 
least. But, no, for me, I have two ﬁrst names, so I don’t know if that’s going to 
work, you know, as a name for a shop. [Laughter.] I’ll have to get more clever, 
I guess. Right now I’m just happy learning this new role, just honing in. There 
are a lot of good creative directors here, and I’m learning from them and 
the ECDs [executive creative directors] and everybody. But, I have no idea 
what the future holds. If the future does present the opening of an agency 
for me, I will have a lot of business-name concepting to do to say the least 
[laughter].
Tuten: No ideas?
Allen: Really, I don’t know. I’ll have to think of one. I feel like it should be 
funny-sounding and slightly confusing. I don’t know if there’s a name that 
could capture what I’d want. Maybe there is. There are acronyms for every­
thing, so maybe I could think of an acronym that would say what I wanted.
Tuten: Mad Men is a popular drama now. Do you see any clear similarities 
or differences in advertising then and now?
Allen: Mad Men is actually one of the few TV shows I watch. I think it’s 
pretty good. I wish some of the things portrayed in Mad Men were still 
the same in the industry. I wish we all still dressed really suavely and drank 
Scotch. I’m not much of a cigarette smoker, but I think that looks cool as 
well.
Tuten: You could carry one as a prop.
Allen: Exactly and just gesture with it [laughter].
It’s funny but people always ask that question nowadays. A lot of people ask 
us how close that show is to real advertising. We actually met Jon Hamm at 
the Emmys last year. We asked him, “Can we take a picture with you?” and 
he kind of looked at us a little weird. So I said, “We’re in advertising,” and he 
laughed. He was like, “Okay, let’s do this.” He even asked us how close the 
show was to real advertising. [I said,] “I’m sure it was really close to advertis­
ing in the sixties.”

The aspect of the show that just makes me laugh is how segregated the 
teams are. There are copywriters working with copywriters and art direc­
tors working with art directors, but the copywriters and the art directors 
don’t work together. The copywriter writes words, and they take it down 
the hall, and the art director makes it look pretty. Obviously today, art direc­
tors and copywriters work together, but even more so, there is a blurring 
of the lines. Technically I am an art director, but I write just as much as a 
copywriter, if not more. And my partners, who are technically copywriters, 
do just as much art direction as writing. When you can do both jobs, you are 
a kind of a hybrid creative. I think the days are gone when you can just be a 
really great designer and then hope that somebody will come up with ideas 
and you can just put them down in a fanciful way. I think that’s gone.
But that’s what we see on Mad Men. The art director sitting around with his 
markers, waiting for the ad to come in and then draw the ad up. There was 
no collaboration then and when you can collaborate on all aspects of an 
ad, the work is so much better. Titles have become a little bit meaningless, I 
think. And there are a lot of titles. There are digital strategists and nontra­
ditional creative, and art directors, and copywriters, and all kinds of things. 
And I just think all these titles are kind of funny. Frankly, we should just all be 
called “creatives.”
Tuten: In school, we still tend to teach creatives to pick a side—art direc­
tion or copywriting.
Allen: Exactly. I think that if you say, “I’m only one thing,” you might be in a 
bit of trouble, especially as advertising keeps changing. I think you’ve got to 
be able to do a little bit of everything. I like to call myself an art writer.
Tuten: Do you have a better title for your role as creative director?
Allen: No, I haven’t come up with a creative director one yet.
Tuten: If you open your own shop, you can dismiss with the titles. Or 
change them.
Allen: There you go. If I ever have an agency, we’ll have art writers and copy 
directors. And smart business people instead of accounts people.
Tuten: Do you interact with accounts much?
Allen: To make good work, you have to have smart, good, account people. 
I’ve been lucky to have good account people, and I’ve heard stories about 
how bad account people can be. I’m not afraid of our account people here 
or at my last agency. I like being able to walk in the room and share ideas

with them, and for them to have some input. It never feels like it’s us against 
them. We’re all in it together. That’s when we make the best work.
Tuten: What’s next for you? Career wise?
Allen: Well, maybe I should go back to trying to draw comic books or be a 
rock star.
Tuten: Given the recognition you’ve earned for your work, like being one of 
Creativity’s Top Most Creative, some would say you are a rock star.
Allen: Oh, thank you for saying that. Right now this role as creative director 
is an interesting new thing for me. It’s made advertising a lot more interest­
ing recently. I’m not doing the same role. Instead, I have to learn how to be 
a creative director. It’s a new challenge and it’s fun. I would still love to write 
some long-format scripts, if possible. If I can ever ﬁnd some time. And, we’re 
having our ﬁrst child in November, so that’s going to be a fun game.
Tuten: Congratulations!
Allen: Thank you. So now I’m becoming king of putting things together and 
I’m also packing away all the cool things that I like. I told somebody the 
other day it’s like a bad episode of Two and a Half Men, where I’m literally 
packing up my golf clubs, and guitars, and ampliﬁers and taking them down to 
a storage unit so that I can ﬁt in baby toys.
Tuten: That’s what bigger homes are for!
Allen: Yeah, I guess that’s true. That’s what we need to do: just get a new, big 
house. Seriously though, that’s probably the next step.
Oh, and I did have one thing I was going to say, one last point that I want to 
make. If we have time? I actually wrote myself a note on my hand to remem­
ber to tell you. The note says, “Don’t avoid traditional media.”
Tuten: What do you mean by that?
Allen: A clear trend I’ve seen in advertising today is that everybody is so 
hungry to do digital work that they run away from traditional media. They 
run to digital work. I think that is a mistake. It seems that people are avoiding 
traditional media just because it seems old, when actually traditional media 
can still be very effective. What we have to do is ﬁgure out how traditional 
can support digital and how digital can support traditional. The answer is not 
to run away from traditional when traditional still offers a lot of value. The 
best campaigns I’ve seen at award shows have had a bit of everything—all 
kinds of media—traditional and digital. Given that the best incorporates a 
mix of media, it’s funny for the industry to turn its back on traditional media.

Advertisers at Work
225
We just did a campaign where we used TV to set up the digital idea. 
Television was the activation point. I think that’s a good way to do it. Usually 
people would say, “We don’t need to do TV.” But TV’s still pretty effective, 
and it’s a good tool to use instead of completely going in favor of digital. It’s 
just ﬁnding how they can work together.
Tuten: Are your clients focused on digital? Are they excluding traditional or 
will they listen to your advice on media strategy?
Allen: We have great clients. I’ve always worked with great clients, and that’s 
another key ingredient. You need good account people and you need great 
clients that trust you. Going into a client pitch, we’ve done complete presen­
tations, all digital. We’ve also done digital presentations where we start with 
the preface, “I know this is a digital presentation, but we want to start with a 
billboard,” you know? They’re always okay with these suggestions as long as 
you can back it up and the strategy is based on good, sound reasoning. I like 
to think all clients would be open to it as long as it makes sense, but maybe 
that’s wishful thinking.
Tuten: Is the focus on digital due to budget constraints?
Allen: Digital budgets are getting so big these days. I would say that they’re 
almost as big as our traditional budgets. It’s funny that some clients are a 
little behind and may not be aware of the costs of putting together a shiny 
digital campaign. But more clients are ready to invest money in digital and 
understand that for it to be really good, it needs budget too. The digital 
experience is getting a little bit more fancy. I don’t want to avoid digital, but 
it’s important that we ﬁgure out how to leverage old and new media. They all 
have value.
That’s it. That’s all I had written on my hand: don’t avoid traditional media.
Tuten: Craig, thank you for talking with me today. I’ve learned a lot.
Allen: Great, yeah, and if you ﬁnd any places to insert jokes to make me fun­
nier or any places that words might make me seem more handsome, just feel 
free to add those [laughter].

Three continents, ﬁve countries, one deportation, and a dual-residency later, Jon 
Rosen has been The International Man of Advertising—all in search of the fresh­
est ideas. Jon developed his success at award-winning traditional agencies such 
as Leagas Delaney/London, Fallon/New York, Wieden+Kennedy/Amsterdam, and 
Publicis Mojo/Sydney, where he worked on global brands such as Nike, Adidas, 
Diesel, Powerade, Gor-Tex, and Coca-Cola. He began directing, and this new love 
ultimately led him back home to the media epicenter of New York, where he met 
his future business partner and wingman, Ryan O’Hara Theisen.
The duo’s love for ideas and production, mixed with their appetite for the evolving 
world of branded content, created the foundation for Lucky Branded Entertainment 
(luckyny.com). Lucky is a hybrid—half agency/half production company that writes, 
directs, and produces viral ﬁlms and branded content. The New York City–based 
company has created and produced ﬁlms for clients like Nike, Diesel, Google, 
Speedo, and Gucci. Lucky’s unique business model allows the team to keep clients 
ahead of the curve without burning a hole in their pockets.
Tracy Tuten: Why don’t you just start by giving us an overview of Lucky 
Branded Entertainment and the role that branded entertainment1 plays in 
advertising.
Jonathan Rosen: Okay. We’ve been going full-throttle over the last couple 
of weeks. We started Lucky as sort of a viral company. Ryan and I both came 
from traditional creative shops. Most of my career has been overseas, and 
Ryan’s been mostly in North Carolina and New York. We met in ﬁlm school. 
We both started ﬁlm school for the same reason—because we were both 
kind of burned out from traditional advertising. We did the summer direc­
tors program at NYU and probably worked harder than we’ve ever worked 
in the industry before. And that’s saying a lot considering how much we had 
worked in the industry.
But the work was so fulﬁlling because ﬁlm school was helping us to real­
ize our passion. Film school was amazing. During that time, we made some 
great ﬁlms, and I went back to Australia. Then, sometime later, Ryan sends 
an e-mail to our whole ﬁlm class, saying “Does anyone feel like they’re not 
doing what they’re supposed to be doing?” It caught me totally off guard, but 
1 Branded entertainment is made with the direct ﬁnancial support of a brand to com­
municate the brand’s message to an audience. It is different than “product placement.” 
Instead, the brand plays a role in the production of a video, movie, television program, or 
game, and so on; any form of entertainment may be developed by and for a brand’s com­
munication purposes. Rather than an audience watching a television program with com­
mercials shown during breaks, for example, the program itself is funded and produced by 
the brand.

at the same time, this message came at the right time for me to act. A week 
later, I was on my way back to New York, and I called Ryan and said, “Ryan, 
let’s start a new type of company.”
Little did I know that Ryan had just taken a new job at R/GA. He had negoti-
ated everything he wanted. It was a sweet position for him, but still, he said, 
“Let’s do it.”
I was like, “Wait, have some time to think about it. You know, relax.”
He had more to lose at that point. He’s like, “No, you don’t understand. 
We’ve got to make this happen now if we’re going to do it.”
The next thing you know, we’re off and running and we thought we were 
going to just specialize in viral ﬁlms. But actually, as we’ve been progress-
ing, the industry’s been changing. And the calls we’ve been getting are wider. 
While most of our work is creating online videos, some virals, many docu-
mentaries, we’re doing other forms of ﬁlm, too. We recently even shot a TV 
pilot for Teach for America that we’re about to shop.
Ryan O’Hara Theisen: To give you the simplest view of what we stand for—
to “capture our motto”—we consider ourselves a creative agency and ﬁlm 
production company combined into one. We typically approach brands directly 
or we’ll collaborate with another advertising agency that represents the brand. 
In those cases, when we partner with another agency, we’ll work with them 
from the point of developing strategy, taking whatever research they have. And 
if they don’t have research ﬁndings to inform the work, helping them develop 
the research to get to the insights that will then lead us to the concept.
We then work on developing the concept and handling execution, which for 
us usually means a video-led campaign. But, you know, a video-led campaign 
might be what comes out of our concepting, but not always. Sometimes that’s 
not the right answer for the project at hand. But that’s what we do best—
focus on the video-led campaign world. If we’re handling that, when it comes 
to execution, it’s producing and directing those ﬁlms and then helping to strat-
egize the seeding and placement of the videos as well as develop any digital 
and social support the campaign requires. A lot of times we’ve been getting 
into more traditional TV and print because those media support the needs of 
the campaign. Primarily, most of our work lives online and most of it is in the 
video world. Above all, everything we do is storytelling-led. It’s all storytelling.
Tuten: I like the way you said that, “all storytelling.” A focus on the story 
really gives you a lot of options as you move forward as a company.
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, it does. And like Jon said, we started with the 
shortest format. A lot of viral ﬁlms are still in the thirty-second to one-

230
minute range, especially the successful ones used for branding. We had two 
key reasons that got us most excited for starting a company, both of which 
focused on the end goal of short ﬁlm. First, if you want to play in this space 
as a client, you need to be really brave. Why? Because if you’re going to make 
a commercial and put it online, it’s going to go nowhere fast.
We all know our time is precious, and especially online there’s just so much 
competition. If a client wants to play in this space, they need to be ready to 
do something different than a traditional commercial hosted online. We felt 
that this is a missing expertise to some extent in the industry.
Second, for us as directors who are growing our reels, this company gave 
us the chance to work on breakthrough content and to do “brave work.” 
There’s that phrase again—brave work.
It’s a win-win, but the thing is when you play a motto out like that, sticking 
to a niche, we started to realize that viral ﬁlms, and even viral series, are not 
the type of the things that represent high budgets. Nor do they always rep­
resent, you know, a long-term kind of brand message for clients or a brand. 
What you’re left with is the kind of projects that may focus on a launch, or 
may help to reinvigorate a brand that’s lost energy. Viral projects are pow­
erful setups for a brand launch or product launch, or to give energy to a 
brand that’s sort of fallen by the wayside. A viral ﬁlm might be just right for 
these kinds of situations. But, realistically, these opportunities, limited by such 
parameters, well, they don’t exactly represent a lot of revenue potential in 
terms of growing a company.
Tuten: Jon mentioned that even in the brief period of time that you’ve 
been working in branded entertainment, working with your own agency, the 
industry has been changing a lot. In what ways has the industry changed?
Rosen: It’s still changing a lot. It’s changing all the time. We actually just hired 
an outside consultant to help us deﬁne that change. We’re in the process 
of deﬁning the changes and what they could mean for us. One thing is that 
in the sphere of branded entertainment, just in this brief time since we’ve 
entered the market, the phrase “branded entertainment” has become a 
buzzword. Now there are parties from many different sectors getting into 
this space and competing for business.
You have your traditional agencies that have opened up little entertainment 
divisions. You have the TV networks that are now going to the brands and 
saying, “Hey, we’ve got writers. We’ve got production companies. We can work 
with you to make a show where your product is fully integrated in the script.”
Then you’ve got the people who are hobbyists who are making content, 
user-generated content, and making content ﬁrst. They build a reputation on 

Advertisers at Work
231
creativity and speed, and now brands are going to them and saying, “Hey, can 
you make something for us?”
And there’s the media companies, who formerly wouldn’t touch any sort of 
creative development or production, but now they’re offering clients value-
added packages where a client can buy X amount of media and the media 
companies include the offer to create programming and online videos as 
part of the deal.
God, there are so many forms of competition in this ﬁeld now. There’s even 
CAA2 and the talent agencies.
O’Hara Theisen: They have a lot of brand relationships, too.
Rosen: Totally, so they started an agency within CAA that puts these deals 
together and puts writers on certain jobs and gets products placed in 
scripts. The landscape is changing rapidly and everyone is trying to ﬁgure out 
the magic solution.
O’Hara Theisen: And to Jon’s point, the branded entertainment space has 
changed so much. From the standpoint of competition, there’s just so many 
more hungry entities, powerful, large entities that are part of the old media 
model and the old advertising model. They’re jumping at this opportunity. 
They’re jumping from a hungry perspective. They need to ﬁgure out ways 
to stay alive, and they see this work as a way for them to stay relevant and 
current.
There is even competition on a consumer level, in the form of user-gen­
erated content. We’re always hearing stats like “Forty-eight hours of video 
content is uploaded to YouTube every minute.” We cheer when we hear 
those kinds of numbers, but then you think about the competition for atten­
tion that added content represents. We compete against every bit of content 
from every source for those precious moments and views a consumer can 
allocate to content. We need people to consume the content, pay atten­
tion to it, and even engage in a conversation around the content. The more 
content is in the space, the more difﬁcult it becomes to garner that level of 
attention and engagement.
Because the market is more competitive, I would say the production budgets 
and the creative development budgets are all over the place. We’ve seen 
budgets start to grow and be a little healthier, but we also see that clients 
don’t have a realistic view of what it takes to produce a strong piece. Much 
of it depends upon the sophistication level of the client. If we are working

with a brand that’s done a lot of work in the past and they’re used to paying 
TV production budgets, they understand the importance of strategy and 
planning and creating from a holistic point of view. They understand why it’s 
important to spend time developing a concept.
Likewise, they understand that it takes time to produce the work, and so 
they might come to the table with realistic budgets. But, at the same time, it 
goes without saying that there are some brands, in fact major brands—let’s 
say, for instance, soft drink brands and other major players—which might 
come to you and say they want all of that effort, planning, research, concept­
ing, production, and still, and they are willing to pay you a totally unrealistic 
budget like $15,000. At this stage, at least, there’s no real agreed-upon num­
bers or standards in the industry. Everything is still new. Everyone is looking 
for opportunities, including the clients.
Tuten: When you consider the notion of branded entertainment—and so 
far, branded entertainment has been primarily video-led—do you see this 
content form going beyond video, and if so, where?
O’Hara Theisen: Well, one of the things we think about is the media 
context for video. For many people, when you say “video,” they think of just 
online. You know, as Rosen has mentioned, we’ve started to get more into 
television development. We’re exploring longer formats, including thirty-
minute shows, hour-long shows, and feature ﬁlms. Those are entertainment 
forms for ﬁlm and video. But gaming always represents an enormous brand­
ing opportunity. With a game, the brand is able to create an experience 
within a game.
We always recommend to our clients that they video-seed campaigns. Even 
if the campaign goal doesn’t include the desire for a video to go viral, we 
always recommend that the client set aside money for a video-seeding 
budget because of the competition that exists for the consumers’ eyes. 
One thing we’ve started to see from seeding is the use of online games as 
the seed.
One group came to us recently and presented on their use of garnering 
views by working with online games, and especially Facebook games. Some 
of the games that are out there offer the gamer the opportunity to either 
pay real money to move forward to the next level or they’re allowed to 
watch one of three, branded videos. The consumer picks between which of 
the three that they want to see, so there’s a little choice involved. By watch­
ing the video, then they’re allowed to continue playing the game at the next 
level without paying for the opportunity. In a sense, this is also branded 
entertainment. You could say it’s taking a commercial and throwing it into a 

Advertisers at Work
233
game, but I would say for those campaigns to be successful, people still have 
to be offering true entertainment and not just heavy selling of the product 
represented in the video.
Rosen: Yeah, in a sense, the concept [of branded entertainment] has really 
existed for a long time now. There are certain examples in the advertis­
ing industry’s past such as BMW ﬁlms, or even well before that, P&G soap 
operas. We kind of look at it as a philosophy. We don’t believe that old-
school advertising—where the point is selling something and selling with a 
hard sell “buy, buy now!” approach—works anymore. Consumers are too 
savvy for that approach to be meaningful and effective.
The way we view things, the best approach is to “gift” consumers something, 
and in this case, we are gifting them with entertainment. That’s the philoso­
phy of branded entertainment. Just as a digital shop with great technology 
gifts consumers with useful and cool tools and apps the consumers can use, 
we also gift people with something that’s useful to them, in this case, enter­
tainment. The marketing-savvy aspect is that the consumers welcome the gift 
because of its value and they take the gift with them. Since the gift is imbued 
with a brand, the brand has an opportunity to then build a relationship with 
the consumer.
Tuten: We hear so often now that marketing is content marketing, but the 
content has to offer value. I think the challenge for everyone now is “how 
can we give something of value?”
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, deﬁnitely.
Tuten: You spoke earlier about video seeding. Will you share with me a little 
bit about what that means?
O’Hara Theisen: Video seeding is something where basically we take the 
video or the series of videos that we created and then we strategically 
ensure that the most people possible interact with the video. We set up a 
plan using online inﬂuencers to ensure the interaction. The online inﬂuencers 
might be a few inﬂuential bloggers. They might be people who have video 
social-sharing sites. If you consider seeding from the perspective of paid 
versus earned media,3 seeding straddles both.
We prefer to utilize organic-earned media sites, but ultimately you may need 
to pay someone or pay groups of people to consider using your content. You 
3 Earned media refers to brand coverage, publicity, word-of-mouth communication, and 
buzz. Earned media is brand-related messaging; the brand does not pay for it.

234
can reach them directly or you might be paying “seeders” who have con­
nections with online inﬂuencers. These seeders work with bloggers and web 
sites. Some bloggers are very ethical and concerned about their own reputa­
tion and the value of their web site. They blog for their fans. They may say, 
“I will not take any money. I only want content that’s really cool because my 
money is my reputation. And I make my money off ads on my site and other 
things like that.” Those people are picky bloggers, and the value to them is 
to be able to highlight new, sensational content, rather than funding. Other 
bloggers are more open to accepting some sort of payments to host and 
promote your content.
The really good seeding groups have amazing connections. They have 
inﬂuence, but at the same time, we’ve found that they also need to be 
more than just about blogger outreach because that really only allows you 
to get a certain amount of views. After that, you need to look into other 
things to promote the content. This might be when an online game integra­
tion, possibly on Facebook, comes into play to help hit the kind of numbers 
desired.
Tuten: What kind of numbers, views, are we talking about for these 
campaigns?
Rosen: It might be ﬁve hundred thousand for one client, or a million for 
another. The content only has value to the client if it is seen and experi­
enced. You need serious amounts of viewers and people coming across the 
content. That’s why we activate the content with these other tools, like seed­
ing, and other channels where people are coming in in large numbers.
Tuten: This kind of strategy, seeding in particular, is something that you 
would propose to your client as you’re working through their objectives for 
the campaign?
O’Hara Theisen: No, not generally. Honestly, when we originally started 
Lucky, the plan was to have our own seeding arm within a year and a half. 
However, we found that clients are still at a place where they don’t fully 
understand seeding. Even though we feel it’s hugely important and we spend 
a lot of time trying to educate clients about why seeding is valuable and how 
it works, they don’t always set aside that money for seeding.
To inﬂuence a client to fund a seeding strategy requires a whole other level 
of pitch. It means the client going back to their boss, or to the CMO [chief 
marketing ofﬁcer], or to the president, and educating that person who 
controls the budget about the meaning of seeding. For us, we’ve chosen to 
pull in seeding groups that we trust rather than develop our own ­seeding 

Advertisers at Work
235
­capability. We’re still working together with our seeding groups and our 
clients to develop sound seeding strategies.
We use different groups now, because one group of seeders may be perfect 
for one project, by virtue of the connections they have. Meanwhile someone 
else might be great for another project because of the nature of those con­
nections. Of course, every seeding group will tell you they are right for any 
project. But we’ve had experiences with different groups where, regionally, 
some of them are better. Or, topic-wise, another seeder might be better. So, 
for instance, if you’re trying to reach stay-at-home moms, you will know that 
there are certain kinds of blogs that make sense for this audience. You’ll want 
to work with a seeder who has connections with those speciﬁc opinion 
leaders. Not all seeders will have the ability to pull off that level of speciﬁcity 
in the sphere of inﬂuence.
Tuten: Do you think that you’ll end up adding the seeding arm to your 
agency at some point?
O’Hara Theisen: I don’t know. Honestly, we really care about it a lot. From 
a strategic, smart business point of view, I think it makes a lot of sense. But 
at the same time, as we plan for our business model, seeding isn’t entering 
our conversations as offering the best path for us in terms of sustaining our 
business. Right now, I would say we will probably pick partners rather than 
invest in this division in house. We’ll pick the right partner for the right job 
all along the way. There’s also a sense that the market is still too young for us 
to invest in as a core capability. But for the right company, the company who 
is really able to crack it, seeding represents a major business potential.
Tuten: You said that you both met in ﬁlm school, but you had been working 
in advertising before that time. Is that right?
Rosen: Correct.
Tuten: So what led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in the industry?
Rosen: For me, one of my ﬁrst jobs in high school was working at a sneaker 
store. I was able to witness the great Nike and Michael Jordan spots and 
their inﬂuence over people coming in, wanting to buy Michael Jordans. That 
was probably the ﬁrst time that I actually got excited about advertising being 
a possible profession for me. But at that time, I really thought I was going to 
go into the music business. I did some internships at places like Epic Records, 
and Sony, and a few others, and quickly realized music wasn’t the creative 
ﬁeld I needed.

By this time, I had also started to dream about going to ﬁlm school. My 
parents got divorced during this stage of my life and the ﬁnancial concerns 
around the divorce made me worry that ﬁlm was a little too unpredictable 
ﬁnancially. With these inﬂuences—the music industry lacking the creative 
outlet I wanted, ﬁlm seeming to lack stability, and my understanding of the 
need to make ﬁnancially-sound choices—the answer came back to advertis­
ing. In advertising, I could combine all of these passions. I could combine my 
love for ﬁlm, music, pop culture, and history.
O’Hara Theisen: And I guess for me, I started out more with a love for 
photography. In college, I worked as a photojournalist for four years. I really 
planned on doing photojournalism for my life’s work. But then I took a 
couple of advertising classes my senior year of college. I was also taking 
some design courses just for fun. What happened is that this introduction 
to advertising and design introduced me to the world of art direction. It 
seemed cool and interesting.
I decided on a plan: “Oh, maybe I’ll just go kind of go into the creative side of 
advertising for a few years, and then I’ll have my darkroom downstairs and I 
can kind of play off both worlds.” What really ended up happening was that 
I went to ad school. Both ﬁelds, photojournalism and art direction, really 
require a lot of work to hone your skills and practice your craft. You have to 
dedicate a lot of energy into building your abilities. Eventually, you become 
attractive enough for a company to take you on. For example, for photojour­
nalism, I wanted to work for National Geographic. I knew I was going to have 
to continue to study to land a place at a magazine that could eventually be a 
stepping stone to National Geographic. I recognized that this was a long road 
ahead. I thought advertising would be a shorter road. I knew I would still 
need to work on my skills, but I saw a more direct path from ad school to an 
agency.
I went to ad school for two years, and all the while I was slowly becoming 
more and more passionate about advertising. Then ﬁve or six years went 
by and I realized I hadn’t touched my camera literally in ﬁve years. That was 
a wake-up call for me. So I enrolled in some documentary ﬁlm courses at 
Duke, down in North Carolina, and that’s what sort of sparked my return to 
pictures. Except then the pictures were motion pictures.
Tuten: Does it seem surreal now to realize—like do you ever just think 
during the day, “Wow. We have our own agency.”? You’re both very young to 
already be at this stage.
Rosen: Yeah, it’s been deﬁnitely a roller coaster. I don’t think even if some­
one told us ahead of time everything that was going to happen, everything 

Advertisers at Work

that was before us, we’d have believed it was possible. I don’t know someone 
could get what it means to do this until you actually experience it all.
A lot of our time has been in building and managing the agency. We are 
doing things now that when we worked in traditional agencies, we were 
always protected by the large resources available at those agencies. When 
we worked in large shops, we could just be “creatives.” Now, Ryan and I are 
the product of our own agency. If we’re not creating, we’re not growing our 
business. That’s a hard pill to swallow at times. It means every minute, every 
task we take on, there’s the understanding that we’re playing with resources 
that we need to succeed.
At a large agency, you just don’t have that sense of accountability about 
day-to-day life. We have to be resource-savvy. At the same time, being a small 
company, we don’t always have enough manpower to do all the jobs that 
we need to do to get the work done. And then the company isn’t moving 
forward. Sometimes you get stuck chasing your tail.
O’Hara Theisen: We deﬁnitely have moments. When we moved into our 
new ofﬁce a year ago, it was a pretty incredible feeling. It still feels great to 
go to work. It feels different to come to work here, at our place, than it did 
to go and make a good salary or a day rate somewhere else. Working and 
earning felt good, but now our life is really about our work. Especially when 
you compare our life now to time spent as a freelancer. When you are free­
lancing—at least in New York—you’re really mostly doing the work to make 
enough money to live, or enough money to live a good life. As a freelancer, 
you are rarely able to produce the work you develop.
To Rosen’s point, it is surreal to look back and know that we made some­
thing happen. We have a vision and we have seen that vision come to life. At 
the same time, our roles can be overwhelming from the day-to-day manage­
ment and operational side of things. I don’t want to label it “the good and 
the bad,” but there is deﬁnitely an element of the good and the challenging.
Rosen: With that being said, I don’t think we could go back and work for 
someone again.
Tuten: Is that because of the experience of being in charge, and having the 
authority to choose your priorities, or because of the burnout you men­
tioned at the start of our interview?
Rosen: It’s probably a little combination of those two. I think we both have 
other interests outside of advertising. And we may pursue those down the 
road. This agency is our shot at doing work our way. The industry has done 
things a certain way for a long time. There’s a risk of getting sucked into the 

Chapter 14 |  Ryan O’Hara Theisen and Jonathan Rosen:  
Chapter 14 |  Founders, Lucky Branded Entertainment
238
vortex of the old ways of doing things. This is a constant challenge for us. 
We remind ourselves, “Okay, we want to do it differently. We want to do 
it our way.” And, working with clients who’ve done it the old way, we have 
to remind ourselves and educate them. I think where we are right now is a 
good place to be. I know, too, that we are not the only shop trying to ﬁgure 
out how to do things differently. A lot of other shops are trying to ﬁgure this 
out as well.
Tuten: What’s a typical day like for the two of you, especially given that you 
play creative roles and also roles as managers and leaders?
Rosen: Well, when we ﬁrst get into the ofﬁce, we get a really big, iced latte 
and I get an egg sandwich. O’Hara Theisen does more healthy choices every 
once in a while [laughter].
O’Hara Theisen: I try to do oatmeal, yeah. We usually get in anywhere 
from like nine-thirty to ten, and then kind of see what e-mails have come 
through. I actually check e-mails when I get up at eight. I check e-mails while 
I am getting ready so I know what’s happening or if something came up we 
need to deal with the moment we enter the ofﬁce. Then we are in meet­
ings, either in person or on the phone, and trying to set up new business 
opportunities.
At any given time, we’ll have one or two projects actively in progress, so 
each day there’ll be time set aside during the day to dive into those. This 
usually means leaving the ofﬁce for a while to go and get something accom­
plished. This could be anything. It might be casting later in the day, and we 
may have people come into the agency or we may be going to a casting 
agency and picking out people for an upcoming video we will be shooting. It’s 
fun. We have a mix anywhere from strategy to conceptual development to 
projects that are in preproduction. We manage post-production right on site, 
so we might have another project that’s in the editing process. It keeps our 
day-to-day life really interesting because there are different projects in dif­
ferent stages of the production time line. Our brains need to be able to shift 
around a lot and yet still be focused when it’s on any given activity.
Rosen: We have to work at being efﬁcient in the creative development 
process. When you are a full-time writer on something, you really have a lot 
more time. Back in the day, we used to complain that the planners would 
have so much time on the brief and then the creatives would only get a 
week to work from the brief. Looking back, that seems like so much time 
dedicated to individual tasks in the creative process. Now owning our own 
company, we have to be more efﬁcient than that because of all the other 
duties that we’re working on day-to-day. And we are doing that successfully.

We can pound out really good work in a shorter amount of time, so that’s 
deﬁnitely different.
Tuten: Do you have any rituals that are important to how you gear up for 
working creatively?
Rosen: I personally work better outside of the ofﬁce when I work cre-
atively. Ryan may differ. I work better at a café or a park or something like 
that. It just depends on the assignment. But for me to get out of the work 
environment, it really frees me up creatively. When I’m in the work mode, 
I don’t want to be distracted by everything else, like e-mails and so on. For 
me, that’s best. But for O’Hara Theisen, I think it’s different.
O’Hara Theisen: Everyone has to ﬁnd their own best way of working. I 
like being here at the ofﬁce. I don’t know why that is. But you start to ﬁgure 
out, like Jon was saying, the way your brain works best. And for me, maybe 
it’s just because there might be other things, like I feel I need to be ready 
to jump back on, but that’s sort of the way I work. And then I would say on 
the production side, I like to be super, super, super prepared, so I put a lot of 
time into preproduction, and that way I feel a lot more relaxed on the shoot 
day. This extra focus lets me feel like I can focus on the directing side of 
things. There are so many logistics that go into directing and shooting.
Meanwhile, I might also be dealing with the clients, be it an agency partner 
or brand manager on the set. As a smaller production company, we’re not 
working with a one- or two-million-dollar TV budget. We might be directing, 
and then called away to manage clients during the shoot. That’s why we like 
always have all our ducks in a row so the shoot goes as seamlessly well as 
possible.
Tuten: How big is your staff now?
O’Hara Theisen: We’re at six people, six staff members.
Tuten: Do you have to use freelancers, too? Or do the six of you manage 
all those roles?
O’Hara Theisen: You know, that’s a great question. When creative devel-
opment picks up, we’ll bring on other creative teams. We’ve brought on 
media planners, strategic planners, and even some digital media specialists 
when the right project called for it. For us, our success is really important 
because that’s all we really have as a smaller company. Every client opportu-
nity that we have has to go really, really well because it is such a small world 
and referrals are huge. We always try to overdeliver and always impress. 
Sometimes that might mean we are not getting to hold on to the amount of 
revenue that we want because we chose to forgo that to build a relationship.

As far as the production side goes, the model works the same way. But I 
would say it’s more natural in the production world to call in teams by the 
project because a lot of times a production company might only be a few 
executive producers, like a business manager, and, you know, that can be an 
entire production company. And meanwhile, they might have one shoot that’s 
got two hundred people on it.
O’Hara Theisen: We’re that same way. Like we deﬁnitely will go from let’s 
say four of us who are focusing on one production to—when a shoot hap­
pens, we’ve had all the way up to like seventy people working for us.
Production is so fast. You might get a call on a Tuesday and then on a Friday 
or a Saturday, you’re shooting something and there’s twenty-ﬁve people 
standing around you, working together, and somehow, you know, it’s like this 
dance that gets pulled off.
Tuten: I read an article several years back about Mick Jagger, and it was 
talking about how when the Rolling Stones are on the road, that’s what their 
business is like. They go from ﬁve people and a small recording staff to two 
hundred–plus people to create the show.
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, exactly. I think for any kind of big production you 
need to be able to expand. Another thing we’re always doing is we’re always 
meeting with crew, cinematographers, and great producers here in New 
York. We do this because two things happen. One is that people will be 
booked, so when your job comes along, even though you always love work­
ing with person A, they’re booked on something else so you need to have a 
pool of people you can turn to. Second is that people move up the ladder, 
you know? They might end up becoming too expensive for you for certain 
projects, so you’ve got to always be out there meeting new people. In some 
ways this is like advertising, but in some ways not like advertising. The pro­
duction side of things has a lot more trust in it.
As a production company owner, you need to be able to put a lot of trust 
in other people’s eyes. With an agency, sure, you might hire a group to help 
you with concepting or things like that and they might not nail the work. 
Then in the end it’s up to you to pull the work through. But with production, 
it’s usually a lot of money going into one or two days and there’s so many 
things that can go wrong, from the weather to the actors to accidents like an 
electrical ﬁre on set. We’ve even been robbed during a shoot.
O’Hara Theisen: You really are putting a lot of trust and a lot of money 
into people’s hands that you may know from referrals and networking. It 
works because this is a small, trusting kind of community.

Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign, one that has special meaning to the 
two of you that you’ve produced at Lucky?
Rosen: The Teach for America TV pilot that we’re about to sell is a special 
one for us. It’s actually not on our web site, but we could send you a link to 
take you further.
Tuten: That would be great.
Rosen: That was a project that we worked on for a year, and we pretty 
much didn’t make any money on it. Obviously, we have high hopes for it to 
sell to networks. Basically, Teach for America came to us. Actually, I think it 
pitted the work against two other production companies. Our bid was one 
of the highest, but still really low in the grand scheme of things. Teach for 
America liked our treatment the best. From that day on, we worked for a 
year developing this project.
Basically it’s a documentary-style reality show where we take a master 
teacher into an inner-city classroom where a struggling teacher has lost 
control of the classroom. The struggling teacher is overwhelmed, and the 
master teacher helps transform the struggling teacher, and thus transforms 
the classroom. If this kind of work occurred on a large scale, the implication 
is that in the end, the educational system could be transformed. To work on 
a project that is as lofty as that is in terms of potential impact in the world, 
well it’s a really awesome project to be part of.
Tuten: That sounds like reality television for good instead of evil.
Both: Yes.
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, Jon has mentioned we’re just starting the selling 
process. Even in our preliminary talks with people, with network executives, 
that’s the challenge. The tendency is for network executives to want to add 
cheap drama to it.
We are trying to approach the project from a documentary sensibility. We 
want to let the reality of the situation tell the story. In reality television, all 
the hours the world has spent watching Real Housewives and things like that, 
has made reality television a little cookie-cutter. That’s the reality mindset of 
television audiences now. That’s what we’re up against right now, trying to 
ﬁnd the right network, the one that will believe in the format.
Tuten: That’s a challenge.
O’Hara Theisen: Deﬁnitely.

Tuten: This brings me to a question related to challenges. Imagine that you 
have a magic, fairy wand and if you wave it, you can change one thing about 
the industry that you hate. What would you change?
Rosen: I would change advertising.
Tuten: In what way?
Rosen: I would get rid of it. [Laughter.]
I mean, we’re seeing, not only in branded entertainment, but even in these 
sorts of social events and social projects, the industry is changing a lot. 
Here I am, an old advertising guy. I can’t stand watching commercials. I 
fast-forward everything on the DVR. People have a choice now whether to 
watch, whether to consume advertising or not. For me, if all advertising were 
removed, I wouldn’t miss it.
But I guess you’re asking this question from the perspective of someone 
who makes advertising, what I would do to change it. Actually, this is a bigger 
philosophical question. I’m lucky that I can share how we’re approaching the 
industry and where Lucky is going because it represents what we believe in 
for the industry.
I think if we could make things ﬁrst that would represent a positive change. 
A Hollywood production company comes up with the idea of the script. 
They develop the script concept before they ﬁnd funding, and before they 
make the work. In the advertising world, we have to wait for those oppor­
tunities to show up on our lap from our clients, or in our case half the time, 
from other agencies. With that waiting, we’re missing so many other oppor­
tunities. It feels like in our world we should be creating those opportunities. 
One of the ways moving forward that we’d love to explore is to actually 
make the work, develop the work ﬁrst, and then ﬁnd clients to attach to the 
work later. Obviously, right now, this approach is deﬁnitely a bit cost-prohibi­
tive. But when we can shift to that approach, to that model completely, that’s 
when I’ll be fully happy in the industry.
Tuten: Then you’ll be an artist.
Rosen: That’s funny that you should say that. Yes, that’s been my mantra for 
the last eight months. If I could be an artist in everything I do, whether it’s 
my bank account, whether it’s how I plan my vacations, I would be a very 
happy boy.
Tuten: What about you, Ryan?

Advertisers at Work
243
O’Hara Theisen: I don’t know. As Jon was saying everything, I was trying to 
think about it. Geez, what would I change about advertising? I don’t know. I 
think I’m stumped on that a little bit. Sometimes I feel the industry doesn’t 
accept new ideas quickly enough. There’s a frustration—you know, this is 
from a smaller company so you have to consider who we compete against: 
large agencies that are part of holding companies.
Tuten: Right.
O’Hara Theisen: Those holding companies really manage a lot of the larg­
est relationships with brands, and for us, those represent the opportunities 
for us to do great work because there’s a better budget there to support 
projects. Not that money always means good ideas, but money does mean 
resources to help your idea grow and have the best kind of chance in the 
beginning.
For me, I think there’s a frustration that as much as the world is changing 
from a media and a technology point of view, and advertising supposedly 
could lead changes, communicating is very slow to change because of these 
archaic models. I wish we could tear that all down and work on a level 
where things are a lot more ﬂuid and reactive. I think we would be seeing a 
lot more interesting work that way. Instead, there are a lot of people at the 
top levels who are protecting their jobs, and so they slow the progress of 
new models down.
Tuten: At least to the extent that you control your agency and your deci­
sions, you’ve embraced what you want form the industry at Lucky.
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah. I think that’s a major, major reason why we did 
it. I mean, it’s so funny because, you know, in a lot of ways things have not 
changed much at all. We get called in for consulting jobs and we’re in those 
environments. Sometimes you’re totally impressed and you have great sur­
prises as to cool, innovative things going on at agencies, but I would say for 
the most part, a lot of times you’re kind of like, “Really? This is what you’re 
having us do? Like, you know, this seems like the same exact kind of job we 
would have done four years ago.” And then you’re promising the client that 
this is going to be effective, and I know you really want it to be, but why 
aren’t you just opening up to a whole other way to look at this?
Tuten: I know you both are running short on time today and will need to 
go. But before we wrap, I’m curious, how did you guys come up with the 
name “Lucky”?

Rosen: It started with the May meeting we had three years ago. This was 
when I came back from Australia. Ryan said yes to starting a company, and 
that night I went to a concert alone. The concert was The Verve, and they 
have this song called “Lucky Man.” I was thinking how we’re really lucky to 
be able to move out of the industry and start a company that would com­
bine our conceptual passion with our new love of ﬁlmmaking.
It’s funny because I wasn’t really that serious about it, but I just wanted to 
throw it at Ryan. I was like, “Oh, what do you think of this name, Lucky?”
He’s like, “That’s it.”
I’m like, “Give it some time. Think about it.” It was sort of like what hap­
pened when I said, “Do you want to start a company?” I wasn’t prepared to 
commit to the name, and Ryan was ready right away. We checked out the 
uses of the name. Lucky Man, Lucky Brand jeans, and then when we Googled 
“lucky”—ﬁve hundred Chinese restaurants show up.
Tuten: [Laughter.]
Rosen: But ultimately lucky is a mantra in a way. We’re happy-go-lucky kind 
of guys to begin with.
O’Hara Theisen: And it’s also got a mischievous kind of conﬁdence to it. 
And that’s something that we always try to keep alive here, whether it’s 
parties on April Fools’ Day and we’re having a little bit of fun, whatever 
we’re doing. We’re kind of sticking to this personality that we agreed was 
ours from the beginning. There’s something we want to be and achieve here, 
something different than the old, stodgy model of the advertising industry, 
which seems afraid or unwilling to change. Lucky still feels like the right 
name, you know?
Tuten: It ﬁts perfectly with the mission of entertainment.
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, deﬁnitely. It ﬁt really, really well with viral in the 
beginning, you know?
Tuten: Because you’re lucky if it launches, lucky if it spreads?
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, there is at least a little bit of luck in every project. 
You can put all the strategy and seeding and do it, but you need just a little 
good luck as well.
Tuten: Deﬁnitely. Any last thoughts from the two of you?
Rosen: No. If you want to throw out one last question?
Tuten: What do you still dream of accomplishing?

Advertisers at Work
245
Rosen: Deﬁnitely making a feature ﬁlm, for sure.
O’Hara Theisen: I agree. For me, it might actually be a documentary ﬁlm, 
but feature-length.
Tuten: And would it be branded?
Rosen: I’m not sure. We’ll ﬁnd out.
Tuten: If the opportunity presents itself?
O’Hara Theisen: Yeah, if the opportunity’s there. I mean, obviously, we 
don’t think advertising’s gross, considering we’re pretty passionate about it 
from our roots. I think if the right brand allows you to tell the pure story 
you want to tell, then for sure, we’d brand the ﬁlm. But, there is sort of mar­
riage that needs to come together for that kind of relationship to work well, 
as we know.
Rosen: Lucky’s based off of this Madison Avenue-meets-Hollywood sort of 
love affair. They need each other pretty badly, so hopefully, our feature ﬁlms 
and documentaries will be right in the middle of all that.

Independent Filmmaker
John Zhao is a Korean/Chinese–American independent ﬁlmmaker. Born in China, 
he spent his childhood with his grandfather, an acclaimed calligrapher who sparked 
John’s everlasting love for art and poetry. John went to the cinema for the ﬁrst time 
in Germany; he was a young boy, but decided that day he’d start making ﬁlms.
While growing up in America, John spent this time riding skateboards and taking 
heavy interest in scuba diving and studying the behavior of sharks. He studied 
marine biology before transferring to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) for 
its esteemed creative advertising program. During this time, he frequently visited 
China to teach and travel.
John’s ﬁrst ad stint was an internship at Wieden+Kennedy the year before graduat­
ing. At age 23, during his ﬁrst year in New York City, he successfully wrote, pro­
duced, and directed his ﬁrst feature, Days Gone By, with rogue tactics and few 
resources. (Learn more about the ﬁlm at www.johnxzhao.com.) John is currently 
developing several more features while freelancing in advertising and ﬁlm produc­
tion projects in New York City.
Tracy Tuten: How did you get started? Did you grow up knowing you’d 
work in advertising?
John Zhao: Well, indirectly. I knew that I wanted to be a ﬁlmmaker since I 
was a kid. It was later that I realized I could take skills I gained from being a 
ﬁlmmaker and apply it to projects in ad agencies as well. Advertising could 
provide a steady career for me that was also related to my love of ﬁlm. I was 
living in Germany, actually, when I realized I loved ﬁlm. I was born and raised 
in China and then I went to Germany as a young boy. That’s when I went to

my ﬁrst movie theater. Ever since then—I think I was seven years old—I just 
wanted to make ﬁlms. And I think I wrote my ﬁrst feature ﬁlm when I was 
like twelve or something. It was a really terrible horror movie. I just found 
it in my basement the other day. But, if you look back into my childhood, 
there’s evidence that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
Now, advertising is something I knew nothing about until I got to college. I 
didn’t want to go to ﬁlm school because my favorite ﬁlmmakers never went to 
ﬁlm school. They just picked up a camera and made their ﬁrst ﬁlms. I ﬁgured 
ﬁlm school was expensive. If I had the money to do that, then I would just 
make my own ﬁlm, too. I also seriously considered spending my college years 
as an English and history major because literature and the humanities were 
important to me as a storyteller, but I realized I could do a ton of that on my 
own as well. When I saw that the strength of VCU’s communication program 
was in their creative advertising courses, that’s when I realized that if I wanted 
to make ﬁlms, I would also have to be able to advertise them, to market them, 
so that’s what made me choose advertising initially.
I’m the only child in my family, so it also convinced my folks that I wasn’t just 
going to spend four years learning how to “tell stories,” you know? Even 
though that’s all I wanted to do with my life. They were more supportive 
knowing I’d be able to get a job out of school. Also, I knew I wasn’t the best 
businessman. I knew I had ideas, but ﬁlm is a pricey venture and I had no clue 
how I’d deal with getting my creative work into the marketplace. So I felt 
like an ad agency would be a fast-paced place to start and learn. Surprisingly, 
the creative advertising program opened up my mind a lot. It wasn’t so 
much about making ads or selling something, but more about learning how 
to be speciﬁc with your message, collaborate with strangers, and be a faster 
thinker. Everyone in the program became very close with each other. So I 
started out with these two separate things, but they turned out going hand 
in hand. Yeah, it was a fun couple of years.
When I think of ﬁlm, this thing I was after since I was a child, I was always 
unsure how or what I’d do to support it. Even full-time ﬁlmmakers do other 
things to make a living. They direct commercials, write screenplays, wait 
tables, they do whatever it takes because being able to make feature ﬁlms 
isn’t a career—it’s a privilege, and your so-called career can end any day. So 
for me, having found and extracted the hard skills in something I love to do 
and being able to apply it to another part of society is a very lucky thing I’ve 
been able to do between ﬁlms.
Tuten: How did this unfold from the time you were in college?
Zhao: I interned while ﬁnishing my undergrad degree. After I graduated, 
I did some freelancing. Soon I decided to make my ﬁrst feature ﬁlm and

moved to New York. While I was editing the ﬁlm and telling people about it, 
it helped me ﬁnd a full-time position in a new branded entertainment com­
pany. So it’s been a kind of straddle between advertising and ﬁlmmaking, then 
discovering a place where I can I juggle the two.
Tuten: Most people starting out in the ﬁeld would target a traditional 
agency and work with a mix of media. You’ve targeted ﬁlm and especially 
branded entertainment early on. Did you eschew traditional agencies?
Zhao: I was really enjoying working in a traditional agency, and I loved 
working with the partners that I had. But during that time, I wanted to get 
out of the ofﬁce and onto a ﬁlm set. Even prior to graduation, I was spending 
my free time on ﬁlm shoots so I missed the physicality of that a lot. I felt like 
if I could ﬁnd people who would let me apply my conceptual skills in adver­
tising to ﬁlm production, I would be able to create a more distinct line of 
work, if that makes any sense.
Tuten: You started with ﬁlm on your own. You did your own writing, ﬁlming, 
editing?
Zhao: Yeah, I mean, that’s the way you should start these days. It’s easy to get 
someone else to do the dirty work, but as a ﬁrst-time director, you should 
know what it feels like produce, to write, to edit, to cook meals for your 
cast and crew. The technology these days really allows you to do a lot and 
very quickly. Almost as fast as you can think of something. While I was still in 
Richmond, going to school, I’d spend as much time working in plays, being a 
production assistant on commercials, music videos, anything really. Even in a 
small town I was able to do that and it taught me a lot of stuff.
Then by the time I was able to have some time and mostly have the cour­
age to make my ﬁrst feature, I thought the best thing to do would be to do 
everything—that included writing, producing, shooting ﬁlm, editing, direct­
ing. I felt like, “Okay, the technology is available for me to do it all.” It would 
[also] obviously save a lot of money.
And the third point, and probably the most important, is that I would be able 
to learn everything and ﬁgure out what aspect am I good at and what aspect 
of ﬁlmmaking I am not good at. I knew that by handling each step of the ﬁlm, 
it would be fun, but I would also learn ﬁrsthand what I wish I had more help 
on. I knew that would inform my work on the next ﬁlm. I would develop a 
new model of working. I’ll know where I should reach out for more help and 
so on. That was my philosophy when I started making my ﬁrst feature.
Tuten: Beyond that, your work is focused on ﬁlm whether you are making 
feature ﬁlms, shorts, or commercials. Are there other synergies between 
your work in advertising and your ﬁlm making?

Chapter 15 | John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker
Zhao: VCU has a great advertising program. It really hits the most impor-
tant aspects of the work. You’re working with different partners, and you 
learn how to work with people and how to ﬁnd a point where the team can 
agree on the creative direction of the concept. Coming out of that program, 
I knew how to come up with ideas very quickly and work under deadlines—
you know, pulling all-nighters. All the things that I learned in advertising 
school have also taught me how to be a good director. These are the same 
key qualities needed to direct ﬁlm.
I wasn’t aware of it at the time, but it turns out that ﬁlm directing is very 
similar. You’re working with different actors, and each actor is a different 
person. You have to know how to talk to each actor a different way. And you 
have to be aware that they’re coming from a different background. And you 
have to be receptive to any ideas that they come up with because ﬁlmmaking 
is a collaboration. It’s not about writing a script and then me telling people 
what I want them to do. That never makes a good ﬁlm.
You should always be collaborative, receptive—and it’s a high-stress job. You 
know, it’s like every day you have so many hours of daylight, for example, to 
shoot a certain scene and you have to get all of it done and also be aware 
that there are going to be technical issues that fall in your way. I hope that 
answers your question.
Tuten: You speak passionately about the work, about each aspect. Things 
that others might consider just another chore on the list of things that have 
to happen in creating the work.
Zhao: I see all the steps in creating something from writing to shooting to 
editing, as all one motion, in both advertising and ﬁlmmaking. Sure, we need 
to designate jobs to organize the machine, but I really get disappointed when 
someone doesn’t go the extra mile because it’s not part of their job descrip-
tion. It’s very common for me to have to rewrite an entire scene while 
shooting, or begin producing while writing, so it’s all part of the same motion 
for me.
For me, though, in making my feature ﬁlm, I had some challenges in terms of 
getting everything done in a way that was consistent with my vision. Typically, 
it’s useful to have more than one camera running on a scene, but I couldn’t 
do that because I simply didn’t have the resources to hire another cinema-
tographer. These limitations got in the way of my directing at times, because I 
was playing other roles.
Sometimes during the process, I felt like there was a glass wall every time 
I had a camera in my hands. I felt like there was a glass wall blocking my 
relationship between me and the actors because I was more invested in the

technicalities or the framing or how things looked and how things would 
cut together in the end, and the colors and, you know, very technical things. 
For me, it was a tug of war between the left brain and the right brain, which 
is working with actors, getting the best performances, and being able to tell 
the story in a meaningful way. The next time I work on a feature ﬁlm, I would 
deﬁnitely love to have a cinematographer and a producing partner to help 
me organize the whole shoot a little better.
Tuten: Was it a detriment that you didn’t go to ﬁlm school? How do you 
learn what aspects should be represented in ﬁlm if you didn’t go to ﬁlm 
school to learn the process?
Zhao: I have a lot of ﬁlm school friends and I think it’s a great place to learn 
technical things. It’s a great place to meet like-minded people, but I think it’s 
super important for ﬁlmmakers to be inspired outside of ﬁlm. And I think 
that I get a lot of my ideas and inspiration from life. I get better ideas from 
walking around Brooklyn or just traveling than if I were to sit down at my 
computer and watch a ton of movies. I think talking to people and being 
connected with people is super important. 
And I want to make a ﬁlm school if I wind up making enough ﬁlms and 
having enough to teach from those experiences—this is going to sound 
weird—but I want to make a ﬁlm school where we don’t even watch any 
ﬁlms during the time we’re at the ﬁlm school. You’re going to learn, you’re 
going to study literature, you’re going to study music, and you’re going to be 
inspired by other things, and then in the end, you’re going to learn how to 
make a ﬁlm by making a ﬁlm. I don’t think it’s an academic thing. It’s more of 
a physical process. And that goes with advertising, too. I don’t really want to 
keep my head too high in the sky ever.
One scary thing I realize is that the more comfortable or secure I feel in my 
life, I tend to be less creative. Like during the whole time prior to making 
my ﬁlm, I was in university or I was interning or freelancing at a large agency. 
You live pretty comfortably in an agency. Ofﬁces are hip, you get a desk, you 
get to travel. I was eating well and everything. And then I dumped all of my 
savings, which when you start out really isn’t much at all, into making a ﬁlm. 
But suddenly, I felt very creative because I had to ﬁnd ways around those 
ﬁnancial difﬁculties in creative ways. I couldn’t throw money at problems. 
It was very physical because I had to run all over the place to ﬁnd things. It 
was great to be able to work with very creative, successful people at an ad 
agency, but it was also very refreshing to be like a street-level creative where 
I was talking to people at diners, bowling alleys, or what-have-you to see if I 
could ﬁlm there or get their stories.

Chapter 15 |  John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker
252
I even cast some people in my ﬁlm who weren’t actors. Like if one location 
was a pharmacy, I would actually cast a pharmacist there and learn about 
their life and know where they came from and things like that. I think that’s 
super important to stay connected with people outside of your industry 
because in the end, you are in the business of connecting with people. Being 
in that twentieth-story corner ofﬁce is actually detrimental to creativity. I 
would rather come up with my best ideas in a diner at three in the morning 
while I’m talking to my waiter or something like that. I feel more connected 
to people and I guess I’ll end at that. That’s a big thing for me, to keep my life 
polarized where I can work in an ofﬁce space and work with bigger budgets 
but also never get my head too high in the sky.
Tuten: Would you say that’s the philosophy that guides your work?
Zhao: Yes, that’s my philosophy for the rest of my life. And also make ﬁlms 
and maybe start a ﬁlm school and continue to work in advertising because I 
think it’s fun and it’s great practice, especially in branded entertainment. It’s 
great practice for me as a ﬁlmmaker.
Tuten: Overall are you happy with how the ﬁlm turned out? Do you feel 
that it met its purpose in your life?
Zhao: Yeah, deﬁnitely. I think the ﬁrst feature someone produces, it’s some­
thing you can’t expect too much out of. You just have to do it all on your 
own, stay focused on telling the story you want to tell and get it out there 
and then get some feedback. Then you grow. The experience feeds future 
work. I don’t think a person really becomes “a ﬁlmmaker” until the second 
feature, or maybe even the third.
It’s weird because I didn’t expect this ﬁlm to really go anywhere. I knew I 
liked it, but I knew this year’s Sundance alone had like ﬁve thousand ﬁlm sub­
missions, which is crazy. Eight hundred ﬁlms would get submitted back in the 
nineties. So when I made my ﬁrst feature, I [thought], “Wow, this will just get 
lost in the clutter. Like this is kind of my self-taught ﬁlm-school and that’s all 
it will be.” But it’s getting into festivals, and I couldn’t ask for more, so at the 
same time, I just don’t know what to expect because I just wasn’t prepared 
for it. Basically, I’ve screened it in New York a couple of times and it went 
over well with the audiences, so I’m just more curious now to see what will 
happen at the festival in London. Since it’s an international festival, I’m curi­
ous [about] what a more international audience is going to think of it.
I thought making the ﬁlm was the hardest part. I’m realizing this stuff is the 
part where I actually need the most help, the most people involved. Right 
now I don’t have that. I don’t have a team that’s behind this ﬁlm. I’m just 
ﬂying solo. So, really, I’m just doing everything I can. It’s a learning process.

253
My advertising skills come in handy. I’m able to put together press kits for 
example—just knowing how to design a good press kit and website pretty 
standard for ﬁlm makers. And things like that, how to present the ﬁlm. What 
I’m missing with this ﬁlm is what a strategic or seeding expert would do at 
an agency. They’d organize and time the campaign release. Like I would orga­
nize and time festivals and distribution.
Tuten: How did you fund the work?
Zhao: It wasn’t anything formal. I self-funded it by saving up money from my 
day job and I took the sacriﬁce by being basically homeless and living out of a 
suitcase for a while, couch-surﬁng, and pouring all my resources into the ﬁlm.
Tuten: How do you stay current in the roles you play—whether it’s writing 
or directing or ﬁlming?
Zhao: That’s a good question. You know how I said I was trying to ﬁgure out 
what I’m good at and what roles I like taking on the most during my ﬁrst 
ﬁlm? For ﬁlmmakers now, especially when you consider how easy it is to 
pick up a camera and go out and shoot a ﬁlm, there’s just no excuse to not 
practice and do your homework. You can see this truth every day online with 
the ﬁlms posted on YouTube and the prevalence of UGC [user-generated 
content] in ad campaigns. The technological resources are there for almost 
anyone with the talent to jump in and create ﬁlm work, video work.
Actually, I am really in the mood to do a couple of short ﬁlms, just very 
quickly. I’m thinking about, starting this fall, doing some short ﬁlms with 
friends and actor friends that I’ve made up here, and that will keep me in 
good practice while I ﬁnish writing the feature scripts. I really want to pack­
age the scripts this time with the proper business plan, and pitch it and get 
some ﬁnancing behind the production. It’s not really about money, it’s just 
that the stories—they require more resources for me to actually realize 
them the way I want, so I might be living out of a car again, but either way it’s 
going to require more money on the production side.
Tuten: As you do this ﬁlm work, will you be able to maintain your advertis­
ing career, too? Will you have to sacriﬁce it for the feature ﬁlmmaking?
Zhao: When I was still in school, my ﬁrst experience at a larger agency 
was at Wieden. That was in Portland, Oregon. I left and came to New York 
speciﬁcally because I wanted to take the risk of making a feature ﬁlm. I felt 
that New York was the place to try. Whether I failed or succeeded at it, 
I wanted to take the risk now. Later on in life there will come a time when 
I really need to make a living. I needed to try this path before the day that I 
really have to worry about earning money to live.

So during that time, actually, when I ﬁrst came to New York, I wasn’t work­
ing in advertising. I was just doing random, odd jobs. Sometimes they’d be 
freelance, but sometimes something completely different. When I was shoot­
ing, in 2010, I had the most jobs that I’ve ever had in one year compared to 
the rest of my life. Some of it involved freelance work that I was getting from 
recruiters where I was lucky enough I could work from home and schedule 
things around the work. That was during preproduction when I was writing. 
But for the most part, it was scrappy. I was meeting a bartender down the 
street that would let me take a gig at the bar for like two or three weeks, 
and they would be night shifts so that during the daytime I had time to 
shoot. And then I would ﬁnd my next thing.
Somehow, day by day, week by week, I was able to make it work. Eventually 
there was a three-month period, where I needed to just focus on the ﬁlm, 
and I was able to get by. Living on people’s couches obviously saves you a lot 
of money.
I don’t want to come off like I’m complaining. I was really blessed. The time 
I’m describing, it was the most crazy, intense, fun year of my life. I would do it 
again in a heartbeat.
But to really answer your question, I think there are a lot of students that 
wind up in ad schools, on the creative side, who want to be a copywriter or 
art director as their day job and then paint, write novels, or make music at 
night. The honest truth, it’s not impossible, but it’s very difﬁcult. I really don’t 
know any ﬁlmmakers who had a lifelong career as a copywriter, for example. 
But I think it’s possible to switch back and forth between both. There’s no 
right or wrong, but for me, I thought that before I could help other agen­
cies and brands have something to say creatively, I needed to do something 
to see if I had something to say personally. Staying focused on one thing at 
a time helped me try different things in a short amount of time rather than 
trying to be everything at once.
Tuten: Now that the ﬁlm is out and you are writing the next two scripts, 
you are back in advertising full-time. But still working with video.
Zhao: Yeah, deﬁnitely. I’m really blessed to have chosen advertising and ﬁlm 
as two interests that I have. I feel like the more I work and the more I’m 
growing up, the more I feel like they go hand in hand, just because what I 
know from one thing deﬁnitely has helped the other. These days, I really love 
watching some of my favorite ﬁlmmakers who started out before this whole 
branded entertainment thing, take on their short ﬁlms and other projects, 
funded by brands, and still make something that’s uniquely them. There’s 
deﬁnitely more of a dance going on between the two worlds.

In an artistic sense, whether ﬁlm or advertising, it’s all about ﬁnding a distinct 
voice. It doesn’t matter whether it’s for a brand or simply for a story. The 
key is to ﬁnd something that’s very, very distinct, very unique, that hasn’t 
been said before, and that resonates with an audience.
But then you have to pitch it. Pitching a ﬁlm is just like pitching a campaign to 
the clients. You’re pitching a ﬁlm to the actors, and the crew, and your pro­
ducers. It’s a very similar mindset. In the pitching, you’re testing out whether 
the idea works. What doesn’t work? Who do you want to work with? You’re 
getting feedback. And then once you ﬁnd what you’re looking for, then you 
have to produce it. Once you’ve ﬁnished creating the work, you know, it’s 
still not the end of the story. Then you have to see if the idea resonates with 
the audience.
Tuten: Usually in advertising, there’s a leap of faith at that stage, especially if 
there hasn’t been testing. But you know there will be media support to get 
the story in front of the audience. Is that the same or different for ﬁlm?
Zhao: I think the biggest lesson I learned in making this ﬁlm was that once 
you ﬁnish making the ﬁlm, that’s only half the battle. You have to market it. 
You have to put it through festivals. You have to ﬁnd an audience. Those 
things can take more money and time than making the ﬁlm! I didn’t know 
that before I made Days Gone By. I thought eighty percent of the battle was 
just getting the thing done. In a way, advertising is the same. You have to have 
a strategy as to how to time the release of certain pieces of your campaign. 
Just like a ﬁlm, you have to do that, too. You have to build a world around 
this story that you’re telling and time it in a very efﬁcient way and reach an 
audience.
Tuten: In what other ways is your ﬁlm work similar to your day job in 
advertising?
Zhao: The job I have now is with a relatively new company totally dedicated 
to branded ﬁlm work. Obviously all of us began in more traditional agen­
cies, but we are all ﬁlm lovers and we see how ﬁlm can tell a brand’s story. 
The agency is quite small. With such a small group of us, we all have to wear 
many, many hats in order to get our work done. There, my main focus is 
writing. Most of my time is writing scripts. With every project that I’ve done, 
the work always starts out with writing, but then depending on what the 
project is and how it goes, I’m always branching off into various roles, espe­
cially during execution.
Primarily we are creating videos that are intended to be viral. Sometimes we 
will produce a series of viral videos in a short time. Especially in those cases 
we really have to split up the work in terms of directing them. Sometimes 

Chapter 15 |  John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker
256
we have two different shoots in one day, and there’s just not enough people 
to hold down all those shoots. I’m ﬁnding myself producing a music video 
here, directing a viral there. Sometimes I’m editing them. It’s deﬁnitely a good 
balance between my advertising and ﬁlmmaking skills, and keeps my skills 
honed across the work. Still, I’d say I spend most of the time writing and put­
ting together pitches—everything that happens with a traditional ad cam­
paign up until the point of execution—and then I switch into my ﬁlmmaker 
mode.
Tuten: Do you think this will be the focus of your career in advertis­
ing? Branded entertainment? Or do you think you’ll return to a traditional 
agency now that you’ve ﬁgured out the process for ﬁlm and how it can co-
exist with your career?
Zhao: Branded entertainment, or being able to take my ﬁlm produc­
tion knowledge and apply it to ad gigs, came at a great time for me. After 
I ﬁnished my ﬁrst ﬁlm, I was a bit hesitant about whether a traditional ad 
agency would even ever hire me again! I ﬁnished undergrad and didn’t have 
a huge portfolio like some of these bigger portfolio grad school guys. I was 
just beginning to work at agencies when I left to make a ﬁlm. Then with that, 
it’s like—wow, two years went by working on that ﬁlm. Some might disagree, 
but I don’t know if a feature ﬁlm shows well in a traditional portfolio for 
agency work. It’s kind of a weird thing to stick in a book.
So as I wrapped up the ﬁlm, I was wondering what my next step [would] be. 
And then I landed this opportunity and it seemed to encapsulate both things 
that I live for. It’s just the right place for me to be, especially now.
This is an important lesson for people getting started in their careers: to be 
open to feeding your passion and not just locking yourself into a set career 
path because that’s the path that is most common or most understood. I feel 
like my generation should be open to more unusual paths and not just lock 
themselves in one career mode. They should be receptive to all these other 
things that are connecting with the ad industry.
There are so many roles to be played in branding. There are so many oppor­
tunities. I’m even reluctant to use the word “career” anymore. I feel like 
people my age especially are going to have several careers throughout their 
lives and maybe two or three careers at the same time. The choices should 
be more about going where you feel like you can be most useful and most 
talented and a place where you can grow and really give the world as much 
as you can rather than just pigeonholing yourself into something that the 
industry has said is the right path and being stuck in there forever. I think it’s 
good to explore.

Tuten: Would you say that branded entertainment is more advertising or 
more about ﬁlm? 
Zhao: If I had to give a percentage, it’s probably like a seventy percent to 
thirty percent ratio, advertising versus ﬁlm. The thing is branded entertain­
ment does begin with the same motives, the same goals, the same ideals as 
traditional advertising. But the model is about ﬁnding a new way to reach an 
audience. We know as an industry that traditional modes of communication 
are not as effective as they once were, whether that’s because of the form, 
or the fragmentation in media, or whatever.
I try to be a good audience. That’s how I inform my work. I try to watch 
what’s out there. I try to enjoy ﬁlms, and art, and commercials, and every­
thing as much as anyone else would. Today I would rather watch a really fun, 
little, short ﬁlm or a music video on YouTube than sit in front of the televi­
sion screen and watch a TV spot. When someone passes me a viral video 
that’s hilarious, or it moves me in some way, or it surprises me, that leaves a 
much bigger impact in my mind than say a print ad these days.
I’ve grown up around all the other traditional media and to my way of 
thinking, they have become just background noise for me. I know that my 
interpretation is the same as others in the market. I represent the audience 
in many cases and if I recognize advertising as background noise, others are, 
too. And having branded entertainment seems capable of breaking through 
those barriers a little more effectively. From the perspective of the brand, 
you’re able to tell stories in a way that you weren’t able to before.
I’ll give you an extreme example. My ﬁlm’s sound designer is French and 
he was nice enough to let me crash with him at the Cannes Film Festival 
last year. I had a brief chat with one of the Oscar-winning producers of The 
Cove—this really moving documentary about the murdering of dolphins by 
ﬁshermen. Save it for a sunny day, it’s pretty depressing.
But anyways, getting back to the point. The producer is an avid scuba diver 
and he went on to direct a 30-minute documentary called The Deepest Dive 
about the bathyscaphe Trieste that dove to the deepest known part of the 
Earth’s oceans in 1960. During this dive, Rolex attached one of their proto­
type watches to the outside, and it emerged and survived. It was that dura­
ble. So naturally to make this ﬁlm, it was supported by Rolex and produced 
by JWT [J. Walter Thompson], who does a lot of work with them and has 
their own production house, JW2. Even though the ﬁlm is about this historic 
event—and I think it wound up broadcasting on National Geographic—I 
found that the little tibit about the watch that survived in Rolex’s overall 
involvement of this ﬁlm left a much more natural and interesting impression

with me than if I saw some glossy cheesed-out TV spot during the commer­
cial break.
Tuten: How do you go about writing a viral video or a short ﬁlm that’s 
branded? Is there a creative brief just as there would be for a more tradi­
tional advertising project?
Zhao: That’s a good question. Yes, there is a brief. It’s just executed differ­
ently. I often start concepting for my projects in the same ways that I would 
concept for a print ad, or a TV spot, or any communication intended for 
traditional media. I begin that way and I get that out of my system by writ­
ing all those ideas down. After, I realize that the viral world is a different 
medium. Many times viral videos, to be speciﬁc, need to have something that 
will make the audience pass it around. They need something that’s super 
punchy. That something special needs to be a speciﬁc little quirk, to be of the 
brand rather than something encapsulating the whole campaign. It’s often 
a little joke, or a little whistle, or something like that that really grabs your 
attention.
So oftentimes, I begin as I would traditionally, but when I get all those little 
ideas out of my system from writing a traditional ad campaign, I will grab my 
partner, my art director partner, and we will just turn off our art director/
copywriter roles and grab a camera and go out and start shooting things. You 
know, we will start doodling or we will start improvising and telling jokes, 
until we ﬁnd that thing that makes us laugh. And that’s how we do it. With 
viral ﬁlms, it’s important to ﬁnd something quirky.
Tuten: How can you know what will be quirky enough to go viral? How 
do you know when you’ve hit upon that special something that triggers the 
spread of a piece of entertainment?
Zhao: I don’t think anyone really ever knows. You just have your instincts. 
Basically I think the idea of a viral video, or the appeal of it is they are natu­
rally unintentional or voyeuristic—the videos of cats jumping in boxes or a 
friend catching on ﬁre, those get a million hits and stuff. So when you’re try­
ing to achieve that spontaneity on purpose you have to be in a certain state 
of mind.
You have to surprise yourself. There’s this quote from Robert Frost. He said, 
“No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.” You have to surprise 
yourself ﬁrst and then that will surprise the audience. That’s more important 
than ever with branded entertainment and viral ﬁlms because for the video 
to be effective, it needs to be something that really resonates with people. 
Whether it’s shocking or funny, it has to be so spontaneous and so out of 
the blue that it grabs your attention.

Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign? Something meaningful to you?
Zhao: Off the top of my head, those Old Spice virals Tim [Heidecker] and 
Eric [Wareheim] directed were just phenomenal to me. Their sense of 
humor is just so visceral and really I think it redeﬁnes what comedy can 
be today. It’s the kind of stuff I’d laugh at and joke around about with my 
friends since I was a kid—this kind of absurdist sensibility. I think they’re 
totally artists in themselves, and in a way, “anti-commercial.” So, like, to see 
a mainstream brand like Old Spice and an agency like Wieden be open to 
something that wild gave me more hope for working on ad gigs. That I can 
be myself. Like Tim and Eric!
As far as something I worked on goes, we did a series of virals for Google 
called demoslams. As we all know, Google has tons of different technologies 
and new ones coming out. From what exists already from Gmail to “Gchat” 
to the way the search engine works, basically Google wanted to create a 
unique viral for each service. So, for example, for Google Translate we came 
up with a viral that documents these three kids who are obsessed with kung 
fu ﬁlms. Of course, they’re American kids and they don’t speak Chinese. They 
use GoogleTranslate to redub what they ﬁlm into Chinese. For each technol­
ogy, we basically made these fun demonstrations. The reason why I enjoyed 
working on these is because everything moved so fast. Literally, we were 
pitching our ideas one day and the next week we had it approved and we 
were shooting like ten videos in a two-week period. That’s fantastic for me 
as a ﬁlmmaker because I didn’t feel like anything was stalled. I felt like every­
thing was very spontaneous, and that’s the vibe and the energy that I like to 
work in. Especially in making viral videos, you need to be very spontaneous. 
Everything needs to feel slightly scrappy and that’s how you get all those 
surprising ideas. Even during our shoot, we were improvising with the actors.
During that two-week period, I was able to go from writing to pitching and 
then the next week we were looking for the cast already and we were build­
ing sets and we were shooting. We were coming up with more new ideas on 
the set. That’s great practice for me. Amazing. A wonderful opportunity to 
have.
Tuten: The fast pace is important to you. The ability to plan and execute 
quickly.
Zhao: I think so. I always knew ﬁlmmaking—here I’m talking about tradi­
tional, narrative ﬁlmmaking for cinema—can be a long process. You hear 
about these great ﬁlms that come out, like The Tree of Life or Blue Valentine 
that take a decade to just develop. So working in advertising, I think I could 
be synergistic. It balances out the time component of ﬁlmmaking for me.

Chapter 15 | John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker
I needed something that would balance out the time commitment to ﬁlm 
and also provide a creative outlet for me in between projects. But, then 
again, you’d think that advertising is always fast, but there are so many 
pitches that take a long time. Where I work, we are set up to be a one-stop 
shop for branded entertainment. We are the ad agency and production 
agency all under one house.
But even with that, you still ﬁnd situations where the process seems 
extended. One thing we like to do where I work is take on more personal 
projects, to keep ourselves sharp. I produced and edited a music video for 
a musician friend of ours, who’s on his way to release his album and other 
great things. Because the budget was so low, we did it very quickly and it 
turned out wonderfully. But because the musician’s manager had a speciﬁc 
way that they wanted to plan the record release and video, timeline and all 
that, it’s been months and we’re just releasing it this spring. We shot it last 
summer. Sometimes you can work very fast but there’s other things you 
can’t control.
I also ﬁnd it enjoyable and fulﬁlling to work with a small team. I started 
out in agencies where there would be 400 people running around. 
Communication is key. With a small team, communicating on creative tasks is 
much easier. I can come up with ideas much more efﬁciently and faster.
Tuten: Your plan is to stay with a small agency then.
Zhao: Yeah. I prefer a nimble work environment. I guess I went from one 
opposite to the other, going from a large agency to what now is probably 
the smallest work environment one could have. Between those two polar 
opposites I would deﬁnitely choose a small team because I like working 
with people that I feel are family. It’s not that I don’t like bigger agencies or 
more people. It’s more that I like working with people I have a history with, 
and at bigger agencies, you’re put on a project with a group of people, and 
once that’s done, you might be switching to a completely new set of people. 
That can be great, but I like making those really long, personal connections 
with people. I like to know my partners. I like to know what goes on in my 
partner’s private life.
Less people also means fewer walls to hop over to get my ideas launched. 
Though it does, in part, depend on the scale of the campaign. Obviously, if I 
was working on a huge Nike campaign, I would rather work in a big agency 
where I have all the support and I’m working on a piece of a bigger whole. 
But when you’re working on one documentary project, or one music video, 
or one viral video, I think it’s good to keep it focused like that and not have 
too many cooks in the kitchen.

I’m really not opposed to working at a traditional agency again. I just prefer 
working with a group of people that I know really well. The day goes by in a 
much more productive fashion.
Tuten: Do you have advice for people who are getting their start in adver­
tising now? 
Zhao: Thinking back, to get a gig in advertising out of school I wanted to do 
work to impress people. To do things the “right way,” whatever that meant. I 
guess I wanted to get hired! [Laughter.] Now I think my 20s are more about 
ﬁguring out what kind of work I can create that others might lack the sensi­
bilities to, and why I’m doing the things I do, as opposed to just how to get 
it done. All that’s a lifelong journey but, I think I do feel I’m beginning to have 
a deeper sense of what kind of stories I’m good at telling and what kind of 
projects I’d be better concepting for.
Everyone is unique, but it’s hard to stay that way when you have pressures to 
conform to an industry or when any kind of group thinking is involved. Even 
in a huge agency it’s important to not fall into a role where you become 
an advertising machine. Once you begin to develop your aesthetic and 
what kinds of ideas you feel like you have a talent in coming up for, you can 
gravitate towards those more and in turn create better work. Because as a 
creative you’re like a tastemaker, or a ﬁlter for all the ideas ﬂoating around in 
the air.
Yeah, I think being nimble, and I think being spontaneous and a little bit 
scrappy maybe helps create great things. And that also comes from my expe­
rience as a ﬁlmmaker. I think it’s good not to be too precious about things. 
I know people are going to kill me for saying that because you’re always 
supposed to review your work and things like that, but I think there’s a point 
where, you know, there are twelve different opinions. The audience is going 
to look at something very differently [than you].
When you start out, you want to just work. You want to impress others. And 
in a way it’s good to learn the rules ﬁrst before you try to bend them. But 
I wish more people had told me that eventually, the stuff that you make to 
impress yourself will probably impress others as well, so I’d be a little more 
of a risk taker from the get go.
These days, I try to come up with ideas and then make sure that I’m happy 
with them, ﬁrst of all, and that my partner’s happy with them, before I just let 
it out and unleash it into the world. For instance, I try to go out there and I 
purposely listen to music, and see art and things and ﬁlms that are outside 
of my personal taste. Those kinds of activities keep me in balance and keep 
me in check on what’s out there, how others may view concepts. The more 

Chapter 15 |  John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker
262
I work, the more I feel it’s important to gravitate towards being a differenti­
ated creative. A creative who is focused on certain things or good at writ­
ing certain kinds of concepts. Not to pigeonhole myself, but to be good at 
something speciﬁc so when there’s a project that comes around, I will know 
whether I can match well with it instead of just saying, “Oh, I’m just a cre­
ative. I do well at everything.”
Tuten: You’re saying young creatives should be true to their own sense of 
identity in developing their work.
Zhao: Yeah, you know, you come out of school and then you are trying to 
get the ﬁrst job. That’s an important step because it’s those early experi­
ences that will help you learn what you like and don’t like. But sometimes 
people will feel that you shouldn’t question things because you haven’t had 
any experience yet. We have to remember even when we are new to an 
experience that we have a voice. We have a mind. And the sooner you can 
identify your gift, that certain thing that belongs to you, then you’ll begin to 
ﬁnd those projects, and ﬁnd them earlier in your career.
The advertising world can be subject to slow response times and the 
tediousness can be frustrating for young creatives. I am a young creative 
and it might be a little immature of me to say this. Probably a lot of young 
creatives feel this way. We just want to jump in and get a lot of work done 
and get it produced. Still, I know there are a lot of reasons why it takes time 
to approve things.
There was this one campaign or TV spot that I was working on, writing. I 
think it took like a year or something, or a year and a half before I ever saw 
it. It was just so much back and forth. I just know there’s got to be a better 
way of communicating ideas or a better system of approval. Sometimes, I feel 
like ﬁlmmaking is great for me, especially in the way that I make ﬁlms, where 
I’m working with a tiny crew. It’s very refreshing because I’m just with a 
group of actors and a sound guy. It’s very tiny and we’re getting a lot of work 
done, as opposed to if I’m working on an advertising campaign. I’m dealing 
with clients that could be a huge team of people as well as other agencies 
that we might be working with at the time. It’s just a lot of things that might 
stall the energy and the creativity.
In making viral ﬁlms, I think it’s important to have spontaneous energy and 
mindset every time I walk into my ofﬁce. And if there’s something stalling it 
that leads me astray a little bit. So I wish there were a way to like speed up 
the process.
Tuten: Do you have something you think you really wish you had known 
before? Questions of your own?

Advertisers at Work
263
Zhao: The questions I still have are mainly about the business itself, in 
both advertising and ﬁlm, just where it’s going and how to reach audiences. 
Personally, I think there’s too much content out there. There is too much 
clutter. Often, I watch virals posted on an advertising blog or somewhere 
else online, but I often question whether all the money that is poured into it 
and all the effort to produce the work that the agency did with the client—
I wonder sometimes if it even resonates with people. Does it matter? Did 
it make a difference? How can a message really get across to people when 
there’s just so much stuff out there? That’s my biggest question, how do I as 
a creative not only come up with new ideas, but ﬁgure out ways of reaching 
an audience in a better way? How can I speak to my audience without simply 
putting more stuff into this ocean of clutter? I think that’s the most critical 
question for me as a ﬁlmmaker and as a person in advertising.
When you create something, you create these works not just for yourself, 
but also because you want people to experience something. You don’t want 
the audience to go numb because the whole landscape is so cluttered. I 
really think it’s so easy to go through, say, 20 years of work and have only 
two or three campaigns or one ﬁlm that actually resonates with its audi­
ences’s memories. So it’s like, how do we focus that?
It doesn’t need to necessarily be everyone. Obviously, ﬁlms are just as tar­
geted as ad campaigns, but, you know, when you create you want the work 
to reach and inﬂuence an audience and not get lost.
Tuten: Things change so fast in this industry. How do you stay current with 
new technology and the latest advances?
Zhao: I meet documentary ﬁlmmakers who work on their ﬁlms often for 
a much longer time than a lot of independent feature ﬁlmmakers because 
of the amount of research required for a documentary. Especially if you’re 
doing a piece on someone’s life, it takes time to ﬁlm and document life 
changes. The good documentary ﬁlmmakers are always so on point about 
using the latest technology and writing business plans to market their ﬁlm. 
By the time they ﬁnish their ﬁlm, whatever technology they used is going to 
be old technology because it’s from ﬁve or four years ago, and the same with 
the business plan that they used. It is constantly changing. The same is true 
with advertising. The years between the nineties and the 2000s represented 
crazy, crazy change. It just makes you wonder: if that’s just one decade of 
change, then what’s going to happen in the next decade, you know?
I remember one of the partners at Wieden, John Jay, whom I admire a lot, 
was giving a talk about creativity to these visiting Japanese students. In it, 
one of the questions he asked was, “Why do truly creative people dis­
like change?” As he was talking about that, it hit me personally. I feel like 

Chapter 15 |  John Zhao: Independent Filmmaker

ﬁlmmaking has, more or less, the same hierarchy of studio and crew struc­
tures for most of the time it’s been around. But if you look at the ad indus­
try, it’s so much more accommodating to changing things up. Messing with 
the structures, you know? So, I start to wonder a lot about how the ﬁlm 
industry could follow that kind of ﬂexibility. Even working in a speciﬁc and, I 
suppose, new area of advertising—we still wind up doing things in a certain 
way, and we get comfortable doing things a certain way, but that could shift 
anytime. It’s pretty exciting I think.
Tuten: Some people in the industry might say that there needs to be a 
process of multiple levels of approval and reﬁnement from other creatives. 
You’ve talked a lot about getting work out, speed, creating quickly. You focus 
on agility. In this project, there are people who are on one side of this con­
tinuum and then others on the opposite side.
Zhao: Yeah. I once read about a social experiment done with a school. I for­
get which school ran the experiment. The school took an art class and split 
the class in half. There were maybe twenty people in the class. The ﬁrst half, 
their job was to come up with pottery. They made one piece every week. 
That was their goal—to produce every single week. The other half spent 
their entire year making one perfect piece of pottery. They all sent their 
work anonymously into a competition. The surprising thing was that no one 
in the half that spent the year perfecting one amazing piece of pottery was 
selected in the competition. But the people who made things every week, 
several were actually selected in the competition. Their work turned out to 
be more beautiful and more human. Why? They released it at a time where 
it was still full of life, before they killed it—before they killed their own ideas 
through tons of editing.
And, again, I know it’s very hard for me to say this in the advertising world 
because when you create advertising, you are creating something that a 
brand relies on. You are creating work that, when people see it, will affect 
their impressions of the company. It’s not just like me as a ﬁlmmaker, I’m 
telling a story. You are reaching a broader spectrum, and it’s hard to not want 
to gravitate towards that. But to hone real creativity, it’s good to just pound 
out ideas instead of spending the whole day writing the perfect TV spot and 
spending a whole week like sitting around writing this one idea and trying 
to cut it down and rebuild it. In the end, it’s not that it doesn’t matter, but I 
think you’re taking the life out of a lot of things by doing that.
Tuten: What’s next for you, John?
Zhao: I just hope I can keep making feature ﬁlms. In between those, I want 
to put my creativity in anything else that magniﬁes my storytelling skills—
and lately it’s been advertising and music videos. I just enjoy making things

and also ﬁguring out, as I said earlier, the infrastructure. Or being part of 
the dialogue of ﬁguring out better ways to meet audiences. And being more 
effective and not wasting things and cluttering things.
I’m very minimalistic. If you walked into my room, [you’d see] I have a very 
small book collection, a very small DVD collection, my computer, and some 
clothes. I like it when things can be seen in a tangible way, and I feel like 
the landscape is the opposite of that in some ways. If I can make ﬁlms and 
help the industry, both in advertising and ﬁlm, ﬁnd the audiences better and 
maybe build new structures, then I’m a pretty happy guy.
And I guess one last thing: in the end, if I learn enough from working in this 
throughout my life, I would like to build a ﬁlm school some time later on in 
my life. If things click. That’s a faraway dream of mine, but I would love to set 
up some one-year ﬁlm camp, where I can offer an experience for kids that’s 
very inspirational, and I can teach kids how to make ﬁlms.

Tracy Tuten: What led you to advertising as a profession? Did you grow up 
wanting to work in the ﬁeld?
Ellen Steinberg: I’ll start. My father was a commercial artist. I grew up 
around a lot of graphic design and the kind of advertising that was more 
like writing a headline that rhymed, and doing the illustration. I have to say, 
growing up with it, I never looked at advertising and thought, “I want to do 
that.” I actually went so far as to target occupations completely different 
from advertising. I always had the ﬁne-artist gene, though when it came time 
for school, I actually applied to a school for accounting. I was good at math 
and I really had no idea what I wanted to do. By the time I got accepted, I 
was taking an accounting course my senior year in high school, and about a 
month into it—actually, it was probably more like an hour into it—I thought, 
“There’s no way in hell I could do this for a living.”
I actually stumbled upon what I would say is now my career [during] my 
freshman year at the University of Delaware. I had heard really cool things 
about this hot department called visual communications, which was in the 
art department. Word was that the department was very hard to get into, 
and there was a really crazy professor who taught in the program. The pro­
fessor was giving a talk one night and I attended. It was a one- or two-hour 
presentation, and the professor showed student work.
One of the slides showed a spread, a print ad for Scotts Lawn Care. It was 
the ﬁrst slide up there. I actually remember this slide. It was a line drawing 
of a house sitting on a horizon line, and it was repeated on the left side and 
the right side. And on the left side was a green crayon scratch on the ground, 
and it said, “Green with Scotts.” And then the exact same chicken scratch 
was in the sky on the right, and it said, “Green with envy.” And I looked at it, 
and I went, “I want to do that.” And that’s how it happened. That’s why I’m 
here. It was actually the perfect solution for me, because I could use art and 
I could also solve problems. I found it really just fascinating.
Tuten: Ellen, was your ﬁrst job out of college in advertising?
Steinberg: It was. I ended up being in the visual communications program, 
which was a three-year program undergrad, and I developed a portfolio, and 
I went straight up to New York, and found a job.
Tuten: And stayed in the business ever since?

Advertisers at Work
269
Steinberg: Yeah, just about. I’ve had brief hiatuses here and there. I free­
lanced for about seven years, but it’s twenty-one years that I’m in the busi­
ness, I’m horriﬁed to say.
Tuten: And the improv, justice of the peace, and yoga work—that’s all on 
the side?
Steinberg: Yes, yes [laughter]. Jim has a very different story than mine.
Tuten: Jim, tell us about your story.
Jim Russell: Okay. I’ve always enjoyed creative media, whether it’s music 
or ﬁlm or good advertising, from the time I was a kid and into college. But 
in college, I was a psychology major and then picked up a computer science 
degree as well. I was a double major. I did that because I was really inter­
ested in artiﬁcial intelligence. I loved the idea of trying to teach computers 
how to do things that humans do well.
Straight out of school, I worked at Andersen Consulting, which is now 
Accenture, as one of their small group of AI consultants. AI consultants go to 
their different clients around North America and build different AI systems 
to help the clients with underwriting, and this and that. I did that for a while 
and I really liked it.
This is where serendipity comes into play. Andersen opened up an applied 
R&D center in Silicon Valley, a bike ride from the Stanford campus in Palo Alto. 
I moved there in ’93. Half my job was still sort of building demos and doing 
technology stuff, but the other half was focused on a business center for differ­
ent clients of Accenture. One day Citgo would be in, and the next day it would 
be the New York Times, and the next day would be a company like Volvo. All of 
these clients had different problems, and what we were basically doing was 
building the business center. It was really a sort of marketing center. We built 
these demos, and if all was going well, the chief information ofﬁcer would point 
to what was being shown on the screens and say to his or her underlings, “I 
want to build one of those. How quickly can you make it happen?”
That was really what caught me ﬁrst—using technology for storytelling to 
get people to do what you want them to do. That’s a crass way of saying it, 
but that’s what we were doing at the time. So I did that and I realized I was 
sort of a square peg in a round hole in traditional technology consulting, 
even at that R&D center. Slowly but surely, the next job was helping execu­
tives at Intel with their keynote addresses and speeches and building the 
demos around that. And then the next job over was at an online agency, so 
even though I have been working for about twenty-three, twenty-four years, 
I’ve only been in advertising since 2000, so for about eleven years now.

Tuten: What was it that made it clear that advertising was a place that you 
could belong and make a difference?
Russell: I didn’t know that actually. Once I got over to the online agency, 
from the work I was doing before, it just felt like such a good ﬁt. Every prob­
lem you’re trying to solve has creativity at the center of it, but it’s grounded 
in some form of technology. I’m not a creative. I don’t work in the creative 
department, like Ellen does. I’m a little bit different. I’m sort of half-strategist, 
half-thinking about what’s next in the world of innovation. My focus is on 
how technology can be applied within the realm of marketing. So for me, I 
can apply all those skills, but in a very creative way and in a very emotional 
way. You know the best doorway into inﬂuencing somebody to love the 
brand is not through their mind, but through their heart. Trying to ﬁgure that 
out was and is really interesting to me.
Tuten: You both have really different roles at McKinney, but you’re both, at 
heart, creatives. Tell me about what a typical day is like for both of you and 
also how it is that you both end up working on the client work. How do you 
feed into the client work that’s coming out of McKinney?
Steinberg: I’m a group creative director, so I’m basically a creative direc­
tor for several accounts. That means a typical day for me is either kicking 
off a project, or I’m reviewing the work of one or two teams. I always say 
that I go in there and I kill as much work as I can. But I’m just trying to make 
sure that whatever we’re doing feels really original and fresh. Those are my 
internal responsibilities, making sure that we have great work that actually 
is solving a problem and is not just, I would say, art for art’s sake. Creatively 
solving the problem.
The second part of my job is dealing with the clients and trying to sell work 
to them, which is incredibly challenging. You know, with good work there’s 
usually some risk involved. I always joke that it’s kind of like we’re more like 
lawyers because we’re trying to argue someone into something when we 
understand why it’s good, but they don’t come from the same world. I think 
we all get that, and it’s trying to respectfully and intelligently present a case 
of why this work is good and could be effective.
Tuten: Does the sales side come naturally for you?
Steinberg: God, no. You know, if anything, I’ve learned after being a man­
ager now for several years that the best thing I can do is just speak from my 
heart. It’s kind of like what Jim was just saying. I ﬁnd the best thing I can do 
is form a relationship with clients so they know I’m a friend. They know I’m 
a supporter, and then I just really give my honest two cents on what I feel 
would be good for them. I ﬁnd that when I can just be myself and—if they 

Advertisers at Work
271
choose something that I don’t believe in—to just ask, “Do you really want 
to do that?” They’ll actually listen to me. But it’s a ﬁne art. It’s as much of a 
dance as learning how to do the creative itself.
Tuten: Was there anything that you had to do to prepare yourself for that 
part of your job?
Steinberg: Yeah, the ten years prior to that. I think it’s one of those things, 
and I watch it in younger creatives—that the more you do it, the better you 
become at it. You start to learn what the pitfalls are. You start to learn to bet-
ter set up what you’re trying to solve without just going to the executional 
device. I think for me, at least, it was just doing the work and getting in front 
of clients and learning from my own mistakes. And also, I have to say, every 
time I watch a good presenter, I sit and I watch them, and I just take notes.
Tuten: I think we all can improve on our presentation skills by watching 
people who are better.
Steinberg: Absolutely.
Tuten: Jim, talk to me about your typical day.
Russell: My role here at McKinney has really shifted in the past year. We got 
so good at practicing the craft of digital. I just got a report that a bunch of 
people who reported to me who were interactive strategists were being dis-
banded and being moved to where they needed to be. They are being moved 
into creative or planning. We got so good at doing digital, and now we live in 
a postdigital world. It shouldn’t be thought of as something special or unique. 
Since then, it’s been really fun. I get to work on what I want to work on. Part 
of that is looking at what we should be paying attention to—what’s coming 
down the pipe six to eight months from now. It used to be eighteen months, 
twenty-four months, but things are moving so quickly.
The other thing is in pitches, just making sure our digital ideas are really 
good, so that’s where creativity still comes into play with what I’m doing. And 
then the last part is just thinking about how we can work internally to come 
up with more leading ideas faster for all our clients and for ourselves.
Tuten: Can you tell us something that’s coming down the pike technology-
wise?
Russell: That we’re working on or just overall?
Tuten: Just overall. Something exciting that I can’t even imagine yet.
Russell: Geez, there are quite a few. I think we’re going to get to the point 
in the world pretty soon where we’re going to have bandwidth that’s like

twenty to thirty times more than what we have right now. The experiment 
that Google’s doing in Kansas City is an example. When this happens, and 
again, this is not far off, communication such as PowerPoint, Skype, and basic 
videoconferencing that we see now as being standard practice will seem 
incredibly primitive. I don’t want to go all the way to say there will be holo­
grams that we’ll look at and communicate via gesture, but certainly, from the 
perspective of what is possible when one can transmit large amounts of data, 
we’ll begin to see these possibilities to be true. For some capabilities, we’re 
already there.
The crux is that we’ll have to ﬁgure out a different way to invite people into 
the world in which we wish to communicate. We’ll have enormous technolo­
gies able to support how our brands wish to present themselves and impact 
the lives of their target consumers. But how do you engage the consumers 
in this context? How do you invite them to your world when their own 
world is competing with you?
Tuten: And do you have any answers that you can share?
Russell: One critical point is that we can’t consider ideas as solely a mes­
sage anymore. The message has always been the core, but we can never 
again focus on messaging to consumers or talking at them. If there isn’t some 
natural conversational part, where we’re inviting them to participate with 
the brand or co-create with the brand, it’s probably not a good idea. The 
idea that we’re focused on probably isn’t worthwhile.
Tuten: What rituals do you both have? Things that help you work creatively 
or work productively?
Steinberg: I’ll explain, but keep in mind that I’m describing my creative ritu­
als more from when I was actually coming up with ideas on my own, rather 
than my work now as a creative director. Now, my work is largely manag­
ing. But on my own, so much for me is ﬁguring out what the problem is and 
letting it just sort of simmer overnight. I rarely like to just jump in and start 
concepting. I like to let the problem or opportunity sink in a little bit. I come 
from an art background, so my approach is primarily visual. I always like to 
start from that angle, even if it is just purely a routine method of getting into 
the concepting. Of course, I want the resulting ideas to be smart and reso­
nate, but it can be fun and worthwhile to approach ideation from different 
angles. Especially if you’re in a visual medium.
And then another important aspect for me, as far as creativity and creating 
go, comes from a Buddhist learning. It’s to really honor when it’s not work­
ing. It’s the whole square peg/round hole phenomenon. There comes a point 
where, if you just have to force it, it’s better to stop and come back to the

issue at another time. I’ve learned now that the creative process shouldn’t 
be that hard. This is true with managing, too—it just shouldn’t be that hard. 
So it’s being able to not be attached, to be able to walk away and just throw 
the cards up in the air, and try something completely different. You really do 
have to practice the art of nonattachment, because it’s easy to cling and go, 
“No, this is it. This is my baby. I want to see it grow up.” But it’s far better to 
say, “Ehh, yeah, that was just not meant to be,” and just let it go.
I also think it’s important to be able to walk away in general, cleanse the air, 
have a life. That’s something I always try to invite people that are working for 
me to do whenever I can tell they’re stressed out in their minds. I tell them 
to walk away for a little bit.
Tuten: How do you draw that line between when you should protect an 
idea that you think is really good and when you should throw the cards up in 
the air and let things end as they may?
Steinberg: I deﬁnitely encourage people to try to ﬁgure it out. It isn’t 
always intuitively obvious when you should give up and when you should 
hold your ground. Sometimes I struggle to ﬁgure this out. I mean, I won’t be 
as attached to a concept as my creatives are. I keep saying this word “hon­
oring,” but I think you also have to honor when you ﬁrst see an idea and it 
resonates with you, and you think, “Oh!” That reaction came from some­
where, so I feel like [you should] really give it its due, give it its due chance 
of being. Try it twenty different ways, but then, okay, twenty is enough. If it 
doesn’t work at twenty ways, it isn’t working, so let it go.
You know, it’s a real ﬁne art. I think you know when, in the beginning, you 
look at the work and go, “Ehh, maybe. Play with it and see if it develops into 
anything.” Those are easier to let go of because they never really had that 
fully convincing ﬁrst spark.
Tuten: But the other ones, you can?
Steinberg: But the other ones, I feel like you’ve got to give it its due shot, 
play with it, but then, you know, after a while, if it’s not working . . . It’s all 
relative to how much time you have, but if you try for a couple of days and 
it’s just not developing, then let it go.
Tuten: Are you as involved in client work as you’d like to be?
Steinberg: I am. There’s part of me that misses creating from the bottom 
up. I feel like I’ve become sort of a third or fourth partner with my creative 
team, where I’m deﬁnitely adding to the idea or helping shape it. And I get a 
lot of fulﬁllment now from directing the project and helping steer the cre­
atives down a path where they can keep blossoming and the work can keep 

Chapter 16 |  Ellen Steinberg Jim Russell:  
Chapter 16 |  Group Creative Director/EVP Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, McKinney
274
blossoming. That’s really fulﬁlling for different reasons, and I do feel like I still 
am able to help put my own personal mark on work.
Tuten: That’s good. Jim, what about you? Tell me about the rituals that are 
important to you.
Russell: I don’t know [laughter]. I guess for me, the ritual is to not take 
myself too seriously. It’s kind of important. Again, I’m not creating the ideas 
necessarily. I’m often justifying the ideas as to whether they can work digi­
tally. With digital, you can make a fact-based argument for why something 
would work, and often that’s my role. I don’t know. I think with me and my 
ﬁeld, often it’s the lateral move of an idea from another industry that gets 
transferred over to the category you’re working in or something else like 
that that’s really important. And that’s something that is not going to come 
to you a half an hour after a brieﬁng happens.
Or even the next day. Everybody in advertising says they don’t have enough 
time. But, I don’t think the advertising industry is unique in feeling pressure 
to solve problems with a deadline.
Often we are told to come back with ideas within four or ﬁve business days 
of a client telling us what they want solved. And that’s just the way business 
works. Maybe lightning will happen during that time, maybe not. Often you 
just need more time to marinate on the idea, and understand where the hid­
den connections are, and what’s the right way to express the idea and ﬁnd 
the idea.
Steinberg: And, actually, sometimes the best gift is when an idea dies. For 
whatever reason, you ﬁnd out, “Oh, it’s not quite the brief we wanted,” or 
“Someone did this idea a few years ago,” or “The client just doesn’t like it.” 
Sometimes that’s the best gift because, more often than not, with the think­
ing that you already have and all the stewing, you can come back and actually 
do something even better. I see that all the time. You have a quick mourning 
period—and it has to be quick—but then you move on and do something 
even better.
Tuten: It’s like football when you have twenty-four hours to worry about 
the loss and then you’re on your way?
Steinberg: Yes, exactly that idea.
Tuten: Did you have mentors who helped you as you developed into your 
careers?
Russell: I don’t think I had one, not in the traditional sense. The only person 
I could say served in this kind of role—and this still sticks with me—is the 

Advertisers at Work

person who was CEO of Accenture at the time. This was in the mid-nineties. 
I was basically his technology lackey. I didn’t ﬁx his laptop, but I would show 
him new things. I was the ﬁrst one to show him the Internet. His name was 
George Shaheen, and he then went on to found Webvan. I just remember, 
even with me being a twenty-something-year-old kid at that time, when I’d 
go into his ofﬁce, he would tell his assistant that we were not to be inter­
rupted. Here’s a CEO of a multi-million-dollar company, one of the leading 
professional services ﬁrms in the world, but I’d have his undivided attention 
to show him what I had brought to the meeting. I say I don’t consider that a 
traditional mentor because he wasn’t advising or guiding me, but at the same 
time, I learned so much from that.
Actually, one thing I learned is to pay attention to the priority in front of 
you at the time. Rather than checking messages as they arrive, tweeting, and 
whatever else we call multitasking. The fact is, you don’t get much done if 
everybody’s trying to multitask.
Tuten: So do you emulate his behavior?
Russell: Wait. I have a tweet I have to read, so if you’ll just give me a second 
here—I’m kidding. Go ahead [laughter].
Steinberg: Make sure that you get that.
Russell: What was your question?
Tuten: Do you emulate his behavior when you meet with people now?
Russell: I try to. When you said, “Who’s your mentor?” that’s the only 
example I can think of.
Tuten: That makes me sad that he’s all you had.
Russell: Really?
Tuten: Yes.
Russell: Why?
Tuten: Just as I’ve done these interviews, some of the people—well, it’s like 
they’re tearing up thinking about the people who really made a difference 
putting them on their career path, and so I wish you had that, Jim.
Russell: I haven’t been doing this for twenty-three years, right? My career 
has shifted. I’m not in the same industry where I started out. In fact, this is 
the longest I’ve been in any one industry. That’s why this is fun for me. When 
this stops being fun, I’ll go do something else.
Tuten: That’s an important lesson. When it stops being fun, go do some­
thing else.

Chapter 16 |  Ellen Steinberg Jim Russell:  
Chapter 16 |  Group Creative Director/EVP Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, McKinney
276
Russell: Yeah, maybe I’m a little bit different. I’ve always been that way.
Tuten: Ellen, what about you? A mentor?
Steinberg: There are people in my career who have taught me things along 
the way. But, technically, what’s a mentor? Is it someone who teaches you 
along the way? I don’t think there were people along the way who adopted 
me the way I think a mentor would, but I’ve had the privilege of working 
with some amazing people.
Actually, I’ll back up to a professor in college who was incredibly instru­
mental in shaping my life and just being the catalyst for me to be who I am 
today. I always credit him. He really forced me to come out of my shell. He 
taught all of us super-important lessons about advertising that go beyond 
just creativity—but more about being open and sharing your work versus 
being private and competitive. And, you can see this in certain schools where 
people come out guarding their work. His point to us was you want to share 
because it’s going to get better and why hold that back? But he also taught 
us about earning your way into places.
We would do a lot of ﬁeld trips to New York when we were just in piddly 
old Newark, Delaware, showing them that we studied what they do and why 
we admire them, and never just cold-calling people. Really working hard, 
working without pay, offering to help in the ofﬁce without pay just so you 
can breathe the air. He taught us a lot of invaluable information.
And then along the way, as a very young art director, I worked with people 
that really honed my craft. I thought I was a good designer and then they 
would be looking over my shoulder and telling me just how horsey every­
thing looked. It was a while until I could actually spot that myself. So, my 
professor, and people in my early New York days, and then the people I 
worked with at Fallon in Minneapolis. I always say that when I had the chance 
to work at Fallon McElligott, that was me getting to work with people that I 
studied in school who were my heroes! These people were the most gen­
erous, open people, absolutely humble, and they really brought to life the 
things my professor had told us about in school. They all taught me to just 
be open, and that your work will grow from that.
Tuten: So you started off in New York, and then you went to Minneapolis, 
and now you’re in North Carolina.
Steinberg: Yeah, and there was New York and Australia in between as well, yes.
Tuten: How was it you ended up moving to so many places?

Advertisers at Work
277
Steinberg: I guess for creatives, we tend to get focused on the New York 
thing, but I really think, especially when you’re young, people make hops 
every couple of years. So I did that. I think a big reason I sort of jumped all 
over the place is that I got to see just how different places worked. When I 
was freelance, that was great because I got to sample different agencies all 
over the country and just see how differently they work, what the culture 
was like, and so on. But me going out to Minneapolis—I would never have 
chosen that at the time. I was absolutely in love with New York, but I knew 
at the time that Fallon was just one of the best agencies in the world and 
it was such an honor to be invited to work there. There was no way I was 
turning that down. That started my jump off the island.
Tuten: And how long were you with Fallon?
Steinberg: I was with Fallon for ﬁve years in Minneapolis and then I was 
with them again in New York for a few years.
Tuten: That’s a good experience.
Steinberg: And I freelanced for them in between.
Tuten: Do you have a favorite campaign?
Steinberg: That’s a hard question for me. Here at McKinney?
Tuten: It might not be at McKinney. It might be something from your past, 
but something that you had a role in.
Steinberg: Hmm, hmm, hmm. You go, Jim.
Russell: Okay. There’s one at McKinney or really one and a half I’d like to 
share. The cool thing about digital work is often you’re doing stuff that’s 
really on the cutting edge, and what we are putting into the world is more 
like improvisational than, you know, just producing ads and seeing what 
happens.
We created a campaign for a ringtone company sort of in the pre-iPhone 
era. They wanted to sell a lot of ringtones, so we invented this construct 
called “Not pheromones but pherotones,” or ringtones that cause intense 
sexual attraction. We created a doctor, a professor, who was researching this 
term. She was a Danish doctor, and she was on tour in the college campuses 
in America. We crossed the line a little bit by putting a Wikipedia entry for 
pherotones. We had staged one of them. We created some low-end banner 
ads and stuff like that. It was just getting the conversation around to whether 
this was real or not, and then exposing that, “Oh my gosh. Pherotones do 
exist, and you can buy them at Oasys Mobile,” and get these ringtones. The 
professor had ofﬁce hours. People could chat and converse with her and IM.

This is all before the pre-social media days. We have all sorts of other tools 
as our disposal. It just was a blast seeing this take off and never knowing 
what was going to happen the next morning in terms of the discussions that 
were occurring and other stuff around this campaign.
Tuten: That sounds like a lot of fun.
Russell: The other one, the half, is that I was kind of blessed that when I 
joined advertising in 2000, I got to work on the launch of MINI in the United 
States. I was an account person at the time. It was a live campaign. It was 
amazing and I just thought all clients were going to be like that. The head of 
[communications at] MINI Cooper at the time, Kerri Martin, sat in the room 
and said, “Look, my only goal for us is to put out great work and be brand of 
the year. If we do that, I’ll be happy.” And, I didn’t know. I thought they were 
all going to be like that.
Steinberg: Yeah.
Russell: To be told, “I just want great work. Do this,” it was so nice. To work 
on a brand that was very powerful to begin with and be empowered to 
make the brand even stronger. Since then, I have known what it is to have 
client situations like that—and I’ve had them since then, too.
Tuten: Ellen, do you have one to tell?
Steinberg: This has always been a really hard question for me. There are 
certain projects that I’ve loved for different reasons. I almost feel like what’s 
more interesting is just what shapes my favorites now. It’s probably a product 
of being in the business over twenty years, but I feel like you can do cool TV 
and print and interesting, creative execution. You can keep doing that, I think, 
till the cows come home. I really love doing something that’s more just a 
really innovative business-building idea these days. We’re working on some­
thing now for Sherwin-Williams called Chip It! that’s an online tool in their 
digital color tool collection that I just love because it’s just so out of the box 
and really fun and engaging. Basically, it turns any online image into a palette 
of paint colors. And then you can save the colors with the picture, send it 
to a friend and even print it out. You know, take it to the store with you. 
It’s nowhere near a traditional “ad,” yet I think it will do a lot for Sherwin-
Williams.
I think it’s just kind of interesting how what moves me now is not what it 
was before. I used to love to do a really killer one-two punch print ad, like 
the good old days at Fallon. And, I still have appreciation for those types of 
things, but the world’s just totally different now.

Advertisers at Work
279
Tuten: Okay. Imagine that you have a magic, fairy wand and with it you can 
change one thing about advertising. What do you change?
Steinberg: Honestly, my wish is that every client would embrace risk. 
Because honestly, at the end of the day, while I do think superstar creatives 
are not easy to ﬁnd, but there are a lot of really good ones out there. Finding 
a great CMO [chief marketing ofﬁcer] that has an appetite to do something 
that’s differentiating, that will get people’s attention, that can be a challenge. 
To ﬁnd clients that have an appetite for risk would be the biggest step for 
advertising.
Tuten: Have you had any of those ideal clients?
Steinberg: A couple times, yeah, a couple times I have. But a couple times 
out of twenty years, you know? I feel like, more often than not, a version of 
your idea gets through, but the version is not quite the way that you hoped 
for it to be. Or the campaign that you really thought would get people’s 
attention, never remotely sees the light of day. To be brave is rare. And 
there’s a game to this business. I truly feel like there’s a game to how you 
succeed and, more often than not, clients land on the side of safety.
Tuten: Do you have an example of a client who embraced risk?
Russell: I think the span of even within the past ﬁve years, there’s just a 
ﬁner point of “I want return on my marketing investment.” That means 
there’s more testing. That means there’s more analytics to try to uncover 
what return actually means. Sometimes what we do is so creative, showing 
storyboards to people or using intrinsically false ways to get feedback, like 
focus groups. The dynamics of focus groups don’t do service to the work 
and what the work could do to move a brand.
So it’s difﬁcult, but at the same time I respect why they want to test things 
and why they want to understand potential outcomes. Media is a very differ­
ent animal. I don’t understand why clients want to place bets in safe media 
outlets in some cases.
Steinberg: It’s that lack-of-risk thing.
Russell: Yeah, it’s that lack-of-risk thing.
Tuten: So, Jim, is that the one thing you would change, too, or is your 
answer a little bit different?
Russell: I don’t know. I can’t think of anything I want to change necessarily. 
I’m just in a pragmatic mood.

Chapter 16 |  Ellen Steinberg Jim Russell:  
Chapter 16 |  Group Creative Director/EVP Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer, McKinney
280
Steinberg: I think the problem is focus groups. I think focus groups are just 
a subset of this overall lack of strength or lack of conviction to leap off a cliff. 
Man, if we could obliterate focus groups, that would be really great.
Russell: I think I have a more accurate left brain than Ellen does. Maybe. If I 
were a CMO, and let’s say I had a $40, $50 million advertising budget. I’d say, 
“Look. I want the best possible creative work, but I want to work with you 
in ways we all agree on to test, and we can test this and have some degree 
of conﬁdence that the consumers will love this work just as much as the ten 
of us in the room will.” And now the tools in your tool kit for testing include 
brain scans, and other measurement technologies people can’t even imagine, 
and what not. Any test has its ﬂaws. You’ve just got to be smart about which 
ones you’re doing to honor the creative process as opposed to sending 
people animatics and storyboards or something else and saying, “What did 
you think?” So, that’s all.
Tuten: Jim, are you working on any of those innovations in measurement 
and testing?
Russell: There are other groups that do that more than I do, honestly. In 
our planning department, we do analytics. We are using more enlightened 
ways of testing now than the focus group.
Tuten: Mad Men has reinforced some of the ad industry’s early stereotypes. 
Are any of those types that you see on the show still prevalent in the indus­
try today?
Russell: I just think the common element is that this is hard work, and 
you want to blow off steam after work. The difference is this isn’t the ﬁfties 
anymore, or the early sixties, so you have a lot of more options to blow off 
steam. By that, I don’t mean methadone and pain killers. No. No.
Tuten: We’re not limited to Scotch.
Russell: Or Ecstasy. They didn’t have that then. The main point is that you 
can exercise, do yoga, use meditation. A lot of people I know here, they go 
rock climbing before they come in to work. We work hard and we feel stress 
and we handle it in very different ways than what are shown in Mad Men. You 
need a release in some way. I don’t think it has to be booze and womanizing.
Steinberg: I think the deadlines are still pretty prevalent. Of course, they 
had probably a month to come up with one print ad. There’s always an ad 
that looks kind of suspect, but then after a night with some liquor and some 
hookers, they go, “All right, I’ll run that print ad.”
Tuten: When you look around the industry now, what surprises you most?

Advertisers at Work
281
Steinberg: It’s just so different now as far as turnaround times go. And also, 
I miss the good old days of presenting an idea in a thumbnail sketch. People 
expect it to be very blown out, very quickly. But, you know, bigger picture, 
it’s because the world is just absolutely changing, so it’s interesting to me just 
now. What is an ad, you know? Now there are stunts, there are online tools, 
there’s a social media campaign. It’s all advertising, so would I have predicted 
the business would be like this ten years ago even? No way. It’s just a totally 
different game. I think for people like us that are a little bit older, it’s breath-
ing some life into it, breathing some fear into it, too, because you have to 
quickly learn what all the young kids know.
Tuten: What advice would you give to those young kids?
Steinberg: I’d still give them the advice that it’s all about the great idea. You 
can do the coolest execution and make it look really sweet, but there needs 
to be something that I emotionally connect to.
Tuten: Jim, what about you? Advice?
Russell: The big advice from me for young people is “get used to failure and 
cherish that.” Some of the best projects I worked on here at McKinney and 
elsewhere, some people would look at in terms of the results, whether it 
tipped to be viral and other silly things, and say, “That project was a fail-
ure.” But I look at all of those projects as a learning experience. That’s how 
you learn, right? I look at those projects and see skills I learned. Like how I 
learned to propagate a brand through Twitter, or how I learned to work with 
a team more effectively. The point is—these projects are not really failures. 
Instead, it’s important to hug and cherish those things because nobody else 
will do that for you. Your batting average for getting an idea past someone 
like Ellen and on to a client might be one out of ﬁfty ideas. Embrace what 
others would consider to be not succeeding.
Tuten: Are you systematic about it, so each time you have a failure, do you 
do a little analysis?
Russell: I do with my projects on the big things. I do try to have a debrief 
or an after-action type of report, where we get everybody in the room and 
[discuss] what worked, what didn’t, what would we do differently the next 
time. I don’t know. Maybe we should be more premeditative and do that for 
the small things here, too. Those certainly help.
Tuten: I love the idea of learning from the failures. It’s such an important 
lesson.
Russell: The important point is for people to know the lesson: when you 
face failure, dust yourself off and go on.

282
Steinberg: Yeah. Get used to it.
Russell: Don’t get attached to the failure, like, “Oh man, that really blew. 
I thought that was the best idea I ever thought of.” You know, it’s kind of 
what Ellen was saying before: you mourn the loss of something that didn’t 
get sold and just dust yourself off.
Steinberg: Yeah, give yourself a compartmentalized amount of time. I get it. 
I get the loss people feel. You put a lot of work into it. You love it. You see all 
the right reasons for it to live, but at the end of the day, it died. For what­
ever reason, it’s dead. Fine. You have thirty-six hours to mourn. But then pick 
yourself up and stop bitching about it [laughter].
Tuten: Ellen, I have a question speciﬁcally about you this time.
Steinberg: Okay.
Tuten: It’s pretty unusual still to see a female leader in creative. Do you see 
that gender gap closing in creative departments in the future or what kind of 
advice would you have for women to be able to move up through the ranks 
of creative?
Steinberg: McKinney is pretty interesting because there are so many 
female creatives here. I have to say, I’ve never seen as many female creatives 
as we have here. It’s funny. I am asked this question a lot, just what it’s like 
to be a woman. I do think probably the industry doesn’t see as many female 
managers because the women make a choice at some point. A lot of them 
choose to start families and get away from this exhausting career. I com­
pletely get that. But then there are others that stay. You know, there’s a stay-
at-home dad or whatever. But whatever the case, my advice for people, or 
my own experience at least, is I’ve never worked at a place where I’m aware 
that I’m a woman. Maybe I’ve been really lucky. I personally would not take 
that if I was at a place that would not let me voice my opinion because of my 
genitalia.
I encourage people to ﬁnd an environment where you simply are ﬁnding that 
the people are recognizing you for your intelligence and your talents, and 
that’s all that’s there. That it doesn’t matter if you’re a female or a male. I’ve 
been really lucky that that’s all I’ve had. But I don’t believe in luck, so there’s 
something that I’m putting out there and I’m ﬁnding the right people to play 
with.
Tuten: Did that just come naturally?
Steinberg: I guess somehow I’ve been inviting that in. I do know that if I 
was around an environment where it was a deﬁnitive boys’ club and I was 

Advertisers at Work
283
not invited in, that would not be okay with me. I would push my way in, or 
I would speak up, or I would, quite honestly, leave and say it’s not worth 
it because I really think, especially as a creative, the best ideas should be 
rewarded. It doesn’t matter where they’re coming from.
Tuten: So what’s ahead for you two? What are your next steps, dreams, and 
aspirations?
Steinberg: To get out of advertising!
Tuten: No! Seriously?
Steinberg: No, I don’t know. Dreams and aspirations?
Tuten: If you weren’t in advertising, where would you be?
Steinberg: I’d probably be a yoga instructor part of the time. I’d probably 
really be enjoying not working, quite honestly. I might be a yoga instructor in 
Vegas.
Tuten: Doing weddings on the side.
Steinberg: Yeah, doing weddings on the side. I do know I love creating, so I 
think I would get bored if I were doing absolutely nothing, but I would have 
to be in some environment where I could creatively problem solve. I think 
that’s why advertising kind of keeps me around.
Tuten: It’s got it all.
Russell: I think of one or two ads. Sometimes when I have to think too 
much, I wish I were a blackjack dealer in Vegas, and my job was nothing more 
than to just deal those cards. Keep the numbers in my head and see who 
wins and who loses. Probably the bloom would be off that rose in about two 
weeks, but, you know, it’s cool for them. But I always like to be around stuff 
that’s what’s new and what’s next, so working for a technology company or 
a startup that’s using technology in an interesting way always is appealing to 
me.
Tuten: Do you ever think about having your own agency, either of you?
Steinberg: No. I have no interest in that.
Russell: No.
Tuten: How come?
Russell: Well, you know, interviewing—my beautiful interviewing skills to 
the contrary—I’m simply not a people person. I have a hard time when 
people say, “Hi, how are you?”

“I’m Jim Russell. I’ve been working hard for you, too.” [Laughter.]
Steinberg: Running an agency, it’s just so difﬁcult. I’ve watched several 
friends go off and open their own agency, and it’s absolutely stressful. If 
you’re lucky, you have a client come in that can pay for your overhead and 
[you can] think of as your stepping stone. But it’s so fragile these days, and to 
have that many people that I’m responsible for and—oh God. I don’t know. It

For David

Foreword
I went to the Cannes Advertising Festival last year, and as I was walking 
up the red carpet with the stairs lined with photographers and half the ad 
people in tuxes and gowns, I started thinking that Scorsese and Almodóvar 
walked up these same steps a few weeks back at the Cannes Film festival. 
Maybe they deserve the press and glamour and all that, but this crowd? No. 
At the end of the day I sell candy. I’m also a satellite TV salesman and a travel 
agent. The people I walked up the red carpet with at the Grand Palais were 
car salespeople and hawkers of sugar water.
So keep that in mind. In the advertising world, words like “legendary” and 
“genius” are thrown around a lot, but at the end of the day the only legendary 
thing these people did was design a nice computer store and sell a lot of milk.
The people in this book aren’t strangers to fancy accolades, but I don’t 
think they would ever use the word “genius” to describe themselves. What 
they would say is they work harder than most, they are always learning, and 
they are always in search of the “new.” And working harder and never being 
satisﬁed, regardless of how I make it sound, is quite admirable even if you are 
just looking for a new way to sell deodorant.
The hard working people Tracy Tuten interviewed for this book are the 
types of people you want to learn from. I know this because I have person­
ally learned a lot from them. I have a long past with many of them. There 
are a few people in this book that I have worked for. There are some that 
I wanted to work for but they didn’t want to work with me. There is one 
that I did get to work for but then they ﬁred me. There are also a few who 
worked for me and are quickly getting to the point where I will one day be 
working for them.
And what will you learn? Work harder than everyone else, create something 
that has never existed before, and be very wary of tuxedos.

Acknowledgments
This book would not be possible without the complete willingness and 
openness of the eighteen people who participated as interviewees. They 
made this book what it is. Every aspect of value a reader may experience 
from the book is tied to their experiences, stories, opinions, and advice, and 
above all else, their willingness to share all of that with those they’ve never 
met.
Many of these advertising greats were supported and, yes, even gate kept, by 
agency professionals. I relied heavily on these professionals for their organi­
zational skills and helpfulness.
I thank Bart Cummings, who provided an example of excellence for me to 
use as a benchmark and as inspiration.
I thank Gerry Graf, who wrote the Foreword, and John Sweeney and Mark 
Tungate, both of whom contributed their reviews and endorsements.
I thank Jeff Olson, who developed the concept based on the Apress “At 
Work” series and believed in me as the person who could see the concept 
through to its ﬁnal form. He provided me with the greatest fun I’ve known in 
my role as a professor of advertising.
Rita Fernando served as the book’s organizational genius, showing amazing 
patience and detail-orientation from start to ﬁnish. It is my sincere hope to 
work with her again.
Kristen Ng provided her talent and time to transcribing the interviews and 
offered encouragement throughout the process. Her involvement always 
felt like that of a friend and I am grateful for her participation, talent, and 
collegiality.
David Oakley, featured in this book, was enormously supportive of the book 
and helped me reach out to many of the other advertising greats featured. 
I am incredibly thankful for his support and his belief in the project.
I am also thankful for my family, especially David, Daddy, Susan, and Chloe.
