Basic Engineering Mathematics
Why is knowledge of mathematics important in engineering?
A career in any engineering or scientiﬁc ﬁeld will
require both basic and advanced mathematics. Without
mathematics to determine principles, calculate dimen-
sions and limits, explore variations, prove concepts, and
so on, there would be no mobile telephones, televisions,
stereo systems,video games,microwaveovens,comput-
ers, or virtually anything electronic. There would be no
bridges, tunnels, roads, skyscrapers,automobiles,ships,
planes, rockets or most things mechanical. There would
be no metals beyond the common ones, such as iron
and copper, no plastics, no synthetics. In fact, society
would most certainly be less advanced without the use
of mathematics throughout the centuries and into the
future.
Electrical engineers require mathematics to design,
develop, test, or supervise the manufacturing and instal-
lation of electrical equipment, components, or systems
for commercial, industrial, military, or scientiﬁc use.
Mechanical engineers require mathematics to perform
engineering duties in planning and designing tools,
engines, machines, and other mechanically functioning
equipment; they oversee installation, operation, mainte-
nance, and repair of such equipment as centralised heat,
gas, water, and steam systems.
Aerospace engineers require mathematics to perform a
variety of engineering work in designing, constructing,
and testing aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft; they con-
duct basic and applied research to evaluate adaptability
of materials and equipment to aircraft design and
manufacture and recommend improvements in testing
equipment and techniques.
Nuclear engineers require mathematics to conduct
research on nuclear engineering problems or apply
principles and theory of nuclear science to problems
concerned with release, control, and utilisation of
nuclear energy and nuclear waste disposal.
Petroleum engineers require mathematics to devise
methods to improve oil and gas well production and
determine the need for new or modiﬁed tool designs;
they oversee drilling and offer technical advice to
achieve economical and satisfactory progress.
Industrial engineers require mathematics to design,
develop, test, and evaluate integrated systems for man-
aging industrial production processes, including human
work factors, quality control, inventory control, logis-
tics and material ﬂow, cost analysis, and production
co-ordination.
Environmental
engineers
require
mathematics
to
design, plan, or perform engineering duties in the
prevention, control, and remediation of environmen-
tal health hazards, using various engineering disci-
plines; their work may include waste treatment, site
remediation, or pollution control technology.
Civil engineers require mathematics at all levels in
civil engineering – structural engineering, hydraulics
and geotechnical engineering are all ﬁelds that employ
mathematical tools such as differentialequations,tensor
analysis, ﬁeld theory, numerical methods and operations
research.
Knowledge of mathematics is therefore needed by each
of the engineering disciplines listed above.
It is intended that this text – Basic Engineering
Mathematics – will provide a step by step approach to
learning all the early, fundamental mathematics needed
for your future engineering studies.

Preface
Basic Engineering Mathematics 6 th Edition intro-
duces and then consolidates basic mathematical princi-
ples and promotes awareness of mathematical concepts
for students needing a broad base for further vocational
studies. In this sixth edition, new material has been
added to some of the chapters, together with around
40 extra practical problems interspersed throughout the
text. The four chapters only available on the website in
the previous edition have been included in this edition.
In addition, some multiple choice questions have been
included to add interest to the learning.
The text covers:
(i)
Basic mathematics for a wide range of introduc-
tory/access/foundation mathematics courses
(ii)
‘Mathematics for Engineering Technicians’ for
BTEC First NQF Level 2; chapters 1 to 12, 16 to
18, 20, 21, 23, and 25 to 27 are needed for this
module.
(iii)
The mandatory ‘Mathematics for Technicians’
for BTEC National Certiﬁcate and National
Diploma in Engineering, NQF Level 3; chapters
7 to 10, 14 to 17, 19, 20 to 23, 25 to 27, 31, 32, 34
and 35 are needed for this module. In addition,
chapters 1 to 6, 11 and 12 are helpful revision
for this module.
(iv)
GCSE revision, and for similar mathematics
courses in English-speaking countries world-
wide.
Basic Engineering Mathematics 6th Edition provides a
lead into Engineering Mathematics 7th Edition.
Each topic considered in the text is presented in a way
that assumes in the reader little previous knowledge of
that topic.
Theory is introduced in each chapter by a brief out-
line of essential theory, deﬁnitions, formulae, laws and
procedures. However, these are kept to a minimum, for
problem solving is extensively used to establish and
exemplifythe theory.It is intendedthat readers will gain
real understanding through seeing problems solved and
then solving similar problems themselves.
This textbook contains some 750 worked problems,
followed by over 1600 further problems (all with
answers – at the end of the book). The further prob-
lems are contained within 161 Practice Exercises; each
Practice Exercise follows on directly from the relevant
section of work. Fully worked solutions to all 1600
problems have been made freely available to all via the
website – see below. 420 line diagrams enhance the
understanding of the theory. Where at all possible the
problems mirror potential practical situations found in
engineering and science.
At regular intervals throughout the text are 15 Revision
Tests to check understanding. For example, Revision
Test 1 covers material contained in chapters 1 and 2,
Revision Test 2 covers the material contained in chap-
ters 3 to 5, and so on. These Revision Tests do not have
answersgivensinceitisenvisagedthatlecturers/instruc-
tors could set the Tests for students to attempt as part of
their course structure. Lecturers/instructors may obtain
a complimentary set of solutions of the Revision Tests in
an Instructor’s Manual available from the publishers
via the internet – see below.
At the end of the book a list of relevant formulae con-
tained within the text is included for convenience of
reference.
‘Learning by example’ is at the heart of Basic Engi-
neering Mathematics 6th Edition.

Chapter 1
Basic arithmetic
Why it is important to understand: Basic arithmetic
Being numerate, i.e. having an ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide whole numbers with some
conﬁdence, goes a long way towards helping you become competent at mathematics. Of course electronic
calculators are a marvellous aid to the quite complicated calculations often required in engineering;
however, having a feel for numbers ‘in our head’ can be invaluable when estimating. Do not spend too
much time on this chapter because we deal with the calculator later; however, try to have some idea
how to do quick calculations in the absence of a calculator. You will feel more conﬁdent in dealing with
numbers and calculations if you can do this.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand positive and negative integers
•
add and subtract integers
•
multiply and divide two integers
•
multiply numbers up to 12 × 12 by rote
•
determine the highest common factor from a set of numbers
•
determine the lowest common multiple from a set of numbers
•
appreciate the order of operation when evaluating expressions
•
understand the use of brackets in expressions
•
evaluate expressions containing +,−,×,÷ and brackets
1.1
Introduction
Whole numbers are simply the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, ... (and so on). Integers are like whole numbers,
but they also include negative numbers. +3,+5 and
+72 are examples of positive integers; −13,−6 and
−51 areexamplesofnegativeintegers.Between positive
and negative integers is the number 0 which is neither
positive nor negative.
The four basic arithmetic operators are add (+), subtract
(−), multiply (×) and divide (÷).
It is assumed that adding, subtracting, multiplying and
dividing reasonably small numbers can be achieved
without a calculator. However, if revision of this area
is needed then some worked problems are included in
the following sections.
When unlike signs occur together in a calculation, the
overall sign is negative. For example,
3 + (−4) = 3 + −4 = 3 −4 = −1
and
(+5) × (−2) = −10

Basic Engineering Mathematics
Like signs together give an overall positive sign. For
example,
3 −(−4) = 3 −−4 = 3 + 4 = 7
and
(−6) × (−4) = +24
1.2 Revision of addition and
subtraction
You can probably already add two or more numbers
together and subtract one number from another. How-
ever, if you need revision then the following worked
problems should be helpful.
Problem 1.
Determine 735 + 167
H T U
7 3 5
+ 1 6 7
9 0 2
1 1
(i)
5 + 7 = 12. Place 2 in units (U) column. Carry 1
in the tens (T) column.
(ii)
3 + 6 + 1 (carried) = 10. Place the 0 in the tens
column. Carry the 1 in the hundreds (H) column.
(iii)
7 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 9. Place the 9 in the hun-
dreds column.
Hence, 735+ 167 = 902
Problem 2.
Determine 632 −369
H T U
6 3 2
−3 6 9
2 6 3
(i)
2 −9 is not possible; therefore change one ten
into ten units (leaving 2 in the tens column). In
the units column, this gives us 12 −9 = 3
(ii)
Place 3 in the units column.
(iii)
2 −6 is not possible; therefore change one hun-
dred into ten tens (leaving 5 in the hundreds

(ii)

the tens column and the 6 in the hundreds (H)
column.
Hence, 86 × 7 = 602
A good grasp of multiplication tables is needed when
multiplying such numbers; a reminder of the multipli-
cation table up to 12 × 12 is shown below. Conﬁdence

Again, knowing multiplication tables is rather important
when multiplying such numbers.
It is appreciated, of course, that such a multiplication
can, and probably will, be performed using acalculator.
However, there are times when a calculator may not be
available and it is then useful to be able to calculate the
‘long way’.
Problem 9.
Multiply 178 by −46
When the numbers have different signs, the result will

(iii)
7 into 14 goes 2, remainder 0. Place 2 above the

Hence, 1834÷ 7 = 1834/7 = 1834

1.4 Highest common factors and
lowest common multiples
When two or more numbers are multiplied together, the
individualnumbersare called factors.Thus, a factor is a
number which divides into another number exactly. The
highest common factor (HCF) is the largest number
which divides into two or more numbers exactly.
For example, consider the numbers 12 and 15
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 (i.e. all the
numbers that divide into 12).

6
Basic Engineering Mathematics
The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5 and 15 (i.e. all the numbers
that divide into 15).
1 and 3 are the only common factors; i.e. numbers
which are factors of both 12 and 15
Hence, the HCF of 12 and 15 is 3 since 3 is the highest
number which divides into both 12 and 15
A multiple is a number which contains another number
an exact number of times. The smallest number which
is exactly divisible by each of two or more numbers is
called the lowest common multiple (LCM).
For example, the multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48,
60, 72, ... and the multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45,
60, 75, ...
60 is a common multiple (i.e. a multiple of both 12 and
15) and there are no lower common multiples.
Hence, the LCM of 12 and 15 is 60 since 60 is the
lowest number that both 12 and 15 divide into.
Here are some further problems involving the determi-
nation of HCFs and LCMs.
Problem 12.
Determine the HCF of the numbers
12, 30 and 42
Probably the simplest way of determining an HCF is to
express each number in terms of its lowest factors. This
is achieved by repeatedly dividing by the prime numbers
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . . (where possible) in turn. Thus,
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
30 = 2
× 3 × 5
42 = 2
× 3 × 7
The factors which are common to each of the numbers
are 2 in column 1 and 3 in column 3, shown by the
broken lines. Hence, the HCF is 2 × 3; i.e. 6. That is,
6 is the largest number which will divide into 12, 30
and 42.
Problem 13.
Determine the HCF of the numbers
30, 105, 210 and 1155
Using the method shown in Problem 12:
30 = 2 × 3 × 5
105 =
3 × 5 × 7
210 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7
1155 =
3 × 5 × 7 × 11
The factors which are common to each of the numbers
are 3 in column 2 and 5 in column 3. Hence, the HCF
is 3 × 5 = 15
Problem 14.
Determine the LCM of the numbers
12, 42 and 90
The LCM is obtained by ﬁnding the lowest factors of
each of the numbers, as shown in Problems 12 and 13
above, and then selecting the largest group of any of the
factors present. Thus,
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
42 = 2
× 3
× 7
90 = 2
× 3 × 3 × 5
The largest group of any of the factors present is shown
by the broken lines and is 2 × 2 in 12, 3 × 3 in 90, 5 in
90 and 7 in 42
Hence, the LCM is 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 1260 and
is the smallest number which 12, 42 and 90 will all
divide into exactly.
Problem 15.
Determine the LCM of the numbers
150, 210, 735 and 1365
Using the method shown in Problem 14 above:
150 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 5
210 = 2 × 3 × 5
× 7
735 =
3 × 5
× 7 × 7
1365 =
3 × 5
× 7
× 13
Hence, the LCM is
2 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 13
= 95550

Order of operation and brackets
1.5.1
Order of operation
Sometimes addition, subtraction, multiplication, divi-
sion, powers and brackets may all be involved in a
calculation. For example,
5 −3 × 4+ 24 ÷ (3 + 5) −32
This is an extreme example but will demonstrate the
order that is necessary when evaluating.
When we read, we read from left to right. However,
with mathematics there is a deﬁnite order of precedence
which we need to adhere to. The order is as follows:
Brackets
Order (or pOwer)
Division
Multiplication
Addition
Subtraction
Notice that the ﬁrst letters of each word spell BOD-
MAS, a handy aide-m´emoire. Order means pOwer. For
example, 42 = 4 × 4 = 16
5 −3 × 4 + 24 ÷ (3 + 5) −32
is
evaluated
as
follows:
5 −3 × 4+ 24 ÷ (3 + 5) −32
= 5 −3 × 4 + 24 ÷ 8 −32
(Bracket is removed and
3 + 5 replaced with 8)
= 5 −3 × 4+ 24 ÷ 8 −9
(Order means pOwer; in
this case, 32 = 3 × 3 = 9)
= 5 −3 × 4+ 3 −9
(Division: 24 ÷ 8 = 3)
= 5 −12 + 3 −9
(Multiplication: −3 × 4 = −12)
= 8 −12 −9
(Addition: 5 + 3 = 8)
= −13
(Subtraction: 8 −12 −9 = −13)
In practice, it does not matter if multiplication is per-
formed before division or if subtraction is performed
before addition. What is important is that the pro-
cessofmultiplicationanddivisionmustbecompleted
before addition and subtraction.
1.5.2
Brackets and operators
The basic laws governing the use of brackets and
operators are shown by the following examples.
(a)
2 + 3 = 3 + 2; i.e. the order of numbers when
adding does not matter.
(b)
2 × 3 = 3 × 2; i.e. the order of numbers when
multiplying does not matter.
(c)
2 + (3 + 4) = (2 + 3) + 4; i.e. the use of brackets
when adding does not affect the result.
(d)
2 × (3 × 4) = (2 × 3) × 4; i.e. the use of brackets
when multiplying does not affect the result.
(e)
2 × (3 + 4) = 2(3 + 4) = 2 × 3 + 2× 4;
i.e.
a
number placed outside of a bracket indicates
that the whole contents of the bracket must be
multiplied by that number.
(f)
(2 + 3)(4 + 5) = (5)(9) = 5 × 9 = 45; i.e. adja-
cent brackets indicate multiplication.
(g)
2[3 + (4 × 5)] = 2[3 + 20] = 2 × 23 = 46;
i.e.
when an expression contains inner and outer
brackets, the inner brackets are removed
ﬁrst.
Here are some further problems in which BODMAS
needs to be used.
Problem 16.
Find the value of 6 + 4÷ (5 −3)
The order of precedence of operations is remembered

6 + 4 ÷ (5 −3) = 6 + 4 ÷ 2

Chapter 2
Fractions
Why it is important to understand: Fractions
Engineers use fractions all the time, examples including stress to strain ratios in mechanical engineering,
chemical concentration ratios and reaction rates, and ratios in electrical equations to solve for current
and voltage. Fractions are also used everywhere in science, from radioactive decay rates to statistical
analysis. Calculators are able to handle calculations with fractions. However, there will be times when
a quick calculation involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of fractions is needed.
Again, do not spend too much time on this chapter because we deal with the calculator later; however, try
to have some idea how to do quick calculations in the absence of a calculator. You will feel more conﬁdent
to deal with fractions and calculations if you can do this.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the terminology numerator, denominator, proper and improper fractions and mixed numbers
•
add and subtract fractions
•
multiply and divide two fractions
•
appreciate the order of operation when evaluating expressions involving fractions

tor. The number below the line, i.e. 14, is called the
denominator.
When the value of the numerator is less than the
value of the denominator, the fraction is called a
proper fraction.
9
14 is an example of a proper
fraction.
When the value of the numeratoris greaterthan the value
of the denominator, the fraction is called an improper
fraction. 5
2 is an example of an improper fraction.
A mixed number is a combination of a whole number
and a fraction. 21
2 is an example of a mixed number. In
fact, 5
2 = 21
2
There are a number of everyday examples in which
fractions are readily referred to. For example, three
people equally sharing a bar of chocolate would have
1
3 each. A supermarket advertises 1
5 off a six-pack of
beer; if the beer normally costs £2 then it will now
cost £1.60. 3
4 of the employees of a company are
women; if the company has 48 employees, then 36 are
women.
Calculators are able to handle calculations with frac-
tions. However, to understand a little more about frac-
tions we will in this chapter show how to add, subtract,

multiply and divide with fractions without the use of a
calculator.
Problem 1.
Change the following improper
fractions into mixed numbers:
(a) 9
2
(b) 13
4
(c) 28
5
(a)
9
2 means 9 halves and 9
2 = 9 ÷ 2, and 9 ÷ 2 = 4
and 1 half, i.e.
9
2 = 41
2
(b)
13
4
means 13 quarters and 13
4 = 13 ÷ 4, and
13 ÷ 4 = 3 and 1 quarter, i.e.
13
4 = 31
4
(c)
28
5 means 28 ﬁfths and 28
5 = 28 ÷ 5, and 28 ÷ 5 =
5 and 3 ﬁfths, i.e.
28
5 = 53
5
Problem 2.
Change the following mixed numbers
into improper fractions:
(a) 53
4
(b) 17
9
(c) 23
7
(a)
53
4 means 5 + 3
4. 5 contains 5 × 4 = 20 quarters.
Thus, 53
4 contains 20 + 3 = 23 quarters, i.e.
53
4 = 23
4
The quick way to change 53
4 into an improper
fraction is 4 × 5 + 3
4
= 23
4
(b)
17
9 = 9 × 1 + 7
9
= 16
9
(c)
23
7 = 7 × 2 + 3
7
= 17
7
Problem 3.
In a school there are 180 students of
which 72 are girls. Express this as a fraction in its
simplest form
The fraction of girls is 72
180
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by the
lowest prime number, i.e. 2, gives
72
180 = 36
90
Dividing both the numerator and denominator again by
2 gives
72
180 = 36
90 = 18
45
2 will not divide into both 18 and 45, so dividing both the
numerator and denominator by the next prime number,
i.e. 3, gives
72
180 = 36
90 = 18
45 = 6
15
Dividing both the numerator and denominator again by
3 gives
72
180 = 36
90 = 18
45 = 6
15 = 2
5
So 72
180 = 2
5 in its simplest form.
Thus, 2
5 of the students are girls.
2.2
Adding and subtracting fractions
When the denominators of two (or more) fractions to
be added are the same, the fractions can be added ‘on
sight’.
For example,
2
9 + 5
9 = 7
9 and 3
8 + 1
8 = 4
8
In the latter example, dividing both the 4 and the 8 by
4 gives 4
8 = 1
2, which is the simpliﬁed answer. This is
called cancelling.
Addition and subtraction of fractions is demonstrated in
the following worked examples.
Problem 4.
Simplify 1
3 + 1
2
(i)
Make the denominators the same for each frac-
tion. The lowest number that both denominators
divide into is called the lowest common multiple
or LCM (see Chapter 1, page 5). In this example,
the LCM of 3 and 2 is 6

Fractions

(ii)
3 divides into 6 twice. Multiplying both numera-
tor and denominator of 1
3 by 2 gives
1
3 = 2
6

(iii)
2 divides into 6, 3 times. Multiplying both numer-
ator and denominator of 1
2 by 3 gives
1
2 = 3

numerator and denominator of 3
4 by 4 gives
3

2.3 Multiplication and division of
fractions
2.3.1
Multiplication
To multiply two or more fractions together, the numera-
tors are ﬁrst multiplied to give a single number and this
becomes the new numerator of the combined fraction.
The denominators are then multiplied together to give
the new denominator of the combined fraction.
For example,
2
3 × 4
7 = 2 × 4
3 × 7 = 8
21
Problem 9.
Simplify 7 × 2

Dividing numerator and denominator by 7 gives
1 × 14
7 × 5 = 1 × 2
1 × 5 = 2

This process of dividing both the numeratorand denom-
inator of a fraction by the same factor(s) is called
cancelling.

Decimals
Why it is important to understand: Decimals
Engineers and scientists use decimal numbers all the time in calculations. Calculators are able to handle
calculations with decimals; however, there will be times when a quick calculation involving addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division of decimals is needed. Again, do not spend too much time on
this chapter because we deal with the calculator later; however, try to have some idea how to do quick
calculations involving decimal numbers in the absence of a calculator. You will feel more conﬁdent to deal
with decimal numbers in calculations if you can do this.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
convert a decimal number to a fraction and vice-versa
•
understand and use signiﬁcant ﬁgures and decimal places in calculations
•
add and subtract decimal numbers
•
multiply and divide decimal numbers

Introduction
The decimal system of numbers is based on the digits
0 to 9.
Thereareanumberofeverydayoccurrencesinwhichwe
use decimal numbers.For example, a radio is, say, tuned
to 107.5MHz FM; 107.5 is an example of a decimal
number.
In a shop, a pair of trainers cost, say, £57.95; 57.95 is
another example of a decimalnumber. 57.95 is a decimal
fraction, where a decimal point separates the integer,i.e.
57, from the fractional part, i.e. 0.95
57.95 actually means (5 × 10) + (7 × 1)

3.2 Converting decimals to fractions
and vice-versa
Converting decimals to fractions and vice-versa is
demonstrated below with worked examples.
Problem 1.
Convert 0.375 to a proper fraction in
its simplest form
(i)
0.375 may be written as 0.375 × 1000
1000
i.e.
0.375 = 375
1000
(ii)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5
gives 375
1000 = 75
200

Basic Engineering Mathematics
(iii)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5
again gives 75
200 = 15
40
(iv)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5
again gives 15
40 = 3
8
Since both 3 and 8 are only divisible by 1, we cannot
‘cancel’ any further, so 3
8 is the ‘simplest form’ of the
fraction.
Hence, the decimal fraction 0.375 = 3
8 as a proper
fraction.
Problem 2.
Convert 3.4375 to a mixed number
Initially, the whole number 3 is ignored.
(i)
0.4375 may be written as 0.4375 × 10000
10000
i.e.
0.4375 = 4375
10000
(ii)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 25
gives 4375
10000 = 175
400
(iii)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5
gives 175
400 = 35
80
(iv)
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5
again gives 35
80 = 7
16
Since both 5 and 16 are only divisible by 1, we
cannot ‘cancel’ any further, so 7
16 is the ‘lowest
form’ of the fraction.
(v)
Hence, 0.4375 = 7
16
Thus, the decimal fraction 3.4375=3 7
16 as a mixed
number.
Problem 3.
Express 7
8 as a decimal fraction
To convert a proper fraction to a decimal fraction, the
numerator is divided by the denominator.
0.8 7 5
87.0 0 0
(i)
8 into 7 will not go. Place the 0 above the 7
(ii)
Place the decimal point above the decimal point
of 7.000
(iii)
8 into 70 goes 8, remainder 6. Place the 8 above
the ﬁrst zero after the decimal point and carry the
6 remainder to the next digit on the right, making
it 60
(iv)
8 into 60 goes 7, remainder 4. Place the 7 above
the next zero and carry the 4 remainder to the next
digit on the right, making it 40
(v)
8 into 40 goes 5, remainder 0. Place 5 above the
next zero.
Hence, the proper fraction 7
8 = 0.875 as a decimal
fraction.
Problem 4.
Express 513
16 as a decimal fraction
For mixed numbers it is only necessary to convert the
proper fraction part of the mixed number to a decimal
fraction.
0.8 1 2 5
16

13.0 0 0 0
(i)
16 into 13 will not go. Place the 0 above the 3
(ii)
Place the decimal point above the decimal point
of 13.0000
(iii)
16 into 130 goes 8, remainder2. Place the 8 above
the ﬁrst zero after the decimal point and carry the
2 remainder to the next digit on the right, making
it 20
(iv)
16 into 20 goes 1, remainder 4. Place the 1 above
the next zero and carry the 4 remainder to the next
digit on the right, making it 40
(v)
16 into 40 goes 2, remainder 8. Place the 2 above
the next zero and carry the 8 remainder to the next
digit on the right, making it 80
(vi)
16 into 80 goes 5, remainder 0. Place the 5 above
the next zero.
(vii)
Hence, 13
16 = 0.8125
Thus, the mixed number 513
16 = 5.8125 as a decimal
fraction.

3.3 Signiﬁcant ﬁgures and decimal
places
A number which can be expressed exactly as a
decimal fraction is called a terminating decimal.
For example,
3 3
16 = 3.1825 is a terminating decimal
A number which cannot be expressed exactly as a deci-
mal fraction is called a non-terminating decimal. For
example,
15
7 = 1.7142857... is a non-terminating decimal
The answer to a non-terminating decimal may be
expressed in two ways, depending on the accuracy
required:
(a)
correct to a number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, or
(b)
correct to a number of decimal places i.e. the
number of ﬁgures after the decimal point.
The last digit in the answer is unaltered if the next digit
on the right is in the group of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.
For example,
1.714285... = 1.714 correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
= 1.714 correct to 3 decimal places
since the next digit on the right in this example is 2
The last digit in the answer is increased by 1 if the next
digit on the right is in the group of numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 or
9. For example,
1.7142857... = 1.7143 correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
= 1.7143 correct to 4 decimal places
since the next digit on the right in this example is 8
Problem 5.

3.4 Adding and subtracting decimal
numbers
When adding or subtracting decimal numbers, care
needs to be taken to ensure that the decimal points
are beneath each other. This is demonstrated in the
following worked examples.
Problem 7.
Evaluate 46.8 + 3.06 + 2.4+ 0.09
and give the answer correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
The decimal points are placed under each other as
shown. Each column is added, starting from the
right.
46.8
3.06
2.4
+0.09
52.35
11 1
(i)
6 + 9 = 15. Place 5 in the hundredths column.
Carry 1 in the tenths column.
(ii)
8 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 13. Place the 3 in
the tenths column. Carry the 1 into the units
column.
(iii)
6 + 3 + 2+ 0 + 1 (carried) = 12. Place the 2 in
the units column. Carry the 1 into the tens column.
(iv)
4 + 1(carried) = 5. Place the 5 in the hundreds
column.
Hence,
46.8 + 3.06 + 2.4 + 0.09 = 52.35
= 52.4,correct to 3
signiﬁcant ﬁgures
Problem 8.
Evaluate 64.46 −28.77 and give the
answer correct to 1 decimal place
As with addition, the decimal points are placed under
each other as shown.
64.46
−28.77
35.69
(i)
6 −7 is not possible; therefore ‘borrow’ 1 from
the tenths column. This gives 16 −7 = 9. Place
the 9 in the hundredths column.
(ii)
3 −7 is not possible; therefore ‘borrow’ 1 from
the units column. This gives 13 −7 = 6. Place the
6 in the tenths column.
(iii)
3 −8 is not possible; therefore ‘borrow’ from the
hundreds column. This gives 13 −8 = 5. Place
the 5 in the units column.
(iv)
5 −2 = 3. Place the 3 in the hundreds column.
Hence,
64.46 −28.77 = 35.69
= 35.7 correct to 1 decimal place
Problem 9.
Evaluate 312.64 −59.826 −79.66+
38.5 and give the answer correct to 4 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures
The
sum
of
the
positive
decimal
fractions
= 312.64 + 38.5 = 351.14
The
sum
of
the
negative
decimal
fractions
= 59.826 + 79.66 = 139.486
Taking the sum of the negative decimal fractions from
the sum of the positive decimal fractions gives
351.140
−139.486
211.654
Hence, 351.140−139.486 = 211.654 = 211.7, cor-
rect to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

3.5 Multiplying and dividing decimal
numbers
When multiplying decimal fractions:
(a)
the numbers are multiplied as if they were integers,
and
(b)
the position of the decimal point in the answer is
such that there are as many digits to the right of
it as the sum of the digits to the right of the dec-
imal points of the two numbers being multiplied
together.
This is demonstrated in the following worked examples.
Problem 10.
Evaluate 37.6 × 5.4
376
×54
1504
18800
20304
(i)
376 × 54 = 20304
(ii)
As there are 1 + 1 = 2 digits to the right of
the decimal points of the two numbers being
multiplied together, 37.6 × 5.4, then
37.6× 5.4 = 203.04
Problem 11.
Evaluate 44.25 ÷ 1.2, correct to
(a) 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, (b) 2 decimal places
44.25 ÷ 1.2 = 44.25
1.2
The denominator is multiplied by 10 to change it into an
integer. The numerator is also multiplied by 10 to keep
the fraction the same. Thus,
44.25
1.2
= 44.25 × 10
1.2 × 10
= 442.5
12
The long division is similar to the long division of
integers and the steps are as shown.

(ix)
12 into 105 goes 8; place the 8 above the 5 of

(x)
8 × 12 = 96; place the 96 below the 105
(xi)
105 −96 = 9
(xii)
Bring down the 0 to give 90
(xiii)
12 into 90 goes 7; place the 7 above the ﬁrst

(xiv)
7 × 12 = 84; place the 84 below the 90
(xv)
90 −84 = 6
(xvi)
Bring down the 0 to give 60
(xvii)
12 into 60 gives 5 exactly; place the 5 above
the second zero of 442.500
(xviii)
Hence, 44.25 ÷ 1.2 = 442.5
12
= 36.875
So,
(a)
44.25 ÷ 1.2 = 36.9, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
(b)
44.25 ÷ 1.2 = 36.88,
correct
to
2
decimal
places.
Problem 12.

3 = 7.666666...
Hence, 72
3 = 7.667 correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Note that 7.6666... is called 7.6 recurring and is
written as 7.

Using a calculator
Why it is important to understand: Using a calculator
The availability of electronic pocket calculators, at prices which all can afford, has had a considerable
impact on engineering education. Engineers and student engineers now use calculators all the time since
calculators are able to handle a very wide range of calculations. You will feel more conﬁdent to deal with
all aspects of engineering studies if you are able to correctly use a calculator accurately.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
use a calculator to add, subtract, multiply and divide decimal numbers
•
use a calculator to evaluate square, cube, reciprocal, power, root and ×10x functions
•
use a calculator to evaluate expressions containing fractions and trigonometric functions
•
use a calculator to evaluate expressions containing π and ex functions
•
evaluate formulae, given values
4.1
Introduction
In engineering,calculations often need to be performed.
For simple numbers it is useful to be able to use men-
tal arithmetic. However, when numbers are larger an
electronic calculator needs to be used.
There are several calculators on the market, many of
which will be satisfactory for our needs. It is essential
to have a scientiﬁc notation calculator which will have
all the necessary functions needed and more.
This chapter assumes you have a CASIO fx-991ES
PLUS calculator, or similar, as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Besides straightforward addition, subtraction, multipli-
cation and division, which you will already be able
to do, we will check that you can use squares, cubes,
powers, reciprocals, roots, fractions and trigonomet-
ric functions (the latter in preparation for Chapter 21).
There are several other functions on the calculator
which we do not need to concern ourselves with at this
level.
4.2 Adding, subtracting, multiplying
and dividing
Initially, after switching on, press Mode.
Of the three possibilities, use Comp, which is achieved
by pressing 1.
Next, press Shift followed by Setup and, of the eight
possibilities, use Mth IO, which is achieved by press-
ing 1.
By all means experiment with the other menu options –
refer to your ‘User’s guide’.
All calculators have +, −, × and ÷ functions and
these functions will, no doubt, already have been used
in calculations.

Evaluation of formulae
The statement y = mx + c is called a formula for y in
terms of m, x and c.
y, m, x and c are called symbols or variables.
When given values of m, x and c we can evaluate y.
There are a large number of formulae used in engineer-
ing and in this section we will insert numbers in place
of symbols to evaluate engineering quantities.
Just four examples of important formulae are:

Chapter 5
Percentages
Why it is important to understand: Percentages
Engineers and scientists use percentages all the time in calculations; calculators are able to handle cal-
culations with percentages. For example, percentage change is commonly used in engineering, statistics,
physics, ﬁnance, chemistry and economics. When you feel able to do calculations with basic arithmetic,
fractions, decimals and percentages, all with the aid of a calculator, then suddenly mathematics doesn’t
seem quite so difﬁcult.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the term ‘percentage’
•
convert decimals to percentages and vice versa
•
calculate the percentage of a quantity
•
express one quantity as a percentage of another quantity
•
calculate percentage error and percentage change
5.1
Introduction
Percentages are used to give a common standard. The
use of percentages is very common in many aspects
of commercial life, as well as in engineering. Interest
rates, sale reductions, pay rises, exams and VAT are all
examples of situations in which percentages are used.
For this chapter you will need to know about decimals
and fractions and be able to use a calculator.
We are familiar with the symbol for percentage, i.e. %.
Here are some examples.
•
Interest rates indicate the cost at which we can bor-
row money. If you borrow £8000 at a 6.5% interest
rate for a year, it will cost you 6.5% of the amount
borrowed to do so, which will need to berepaid along
with the original money you borrowed. If you repay
the loan in 1 year, how much interest will you have
paid?
•
A pair of trainers in a shop cost £60. They are adver-
tised in a sale as 20% off. How much will you
pay?
•
If you earn £20000 p.a. and you receive a 2.5%
pay rise, how much extra will you have to spend the
following year?
•
A book costing £18 can be purchased on the internet
for 30% less. What will be its cost?
When we have completed his chapter on percentages
you will be able to understand how to perform the above
calculations.
Percentages are fractions having 100 as their denom-
inator. For example, the fraction 40
100 is written as 40%
and is read as ‘forty per cent’.
The easiest way to understand percentages is to go
through some worked examples.

Percentage calculations
5.2.1
To convert a decimal to a percentage
A decimal number is converted to a percentage by
multiplying by 100.
Problem 1.
Express 0.015 as a percentage
To express a decimal number as a percentage, merely
multiply by 100, i.e.
0.015 = 0.015 × 100%
= 1.5%
Multiplying a decimal number by 100 means moving
the decimal point 2 places to the right.
Problem 2.
Express 0.275 as a percentage
0.275 = 0.275 × 100%
= 27.5%
5.2.2
To convert a percentage to a decimal
A percentage is converted to a decimal number by
dividing by 100.
Problem 3.
Express 6.5% as a decimal number
6.5% = 6.5
100 = 0.065
Dividing by 100 means moving the decimal point 2
places to the left.
Problem 4.
Express 17.5% as a decimal number
17.5% = 17.5
100
= 0.175
5.2.3
To convert a fraction to a percentage
A fraction is converted to a percentage by multiplying
by 100.
Problem 5.
Express 5
8 as a percentage
5
8 = 5
8 × 100% = 500
8 %
= 62.5%
Problem 6.
Express 5
19 as a percentage, correct
to 2 decimal places
5
19 = 5
19 × 100%
= 500
19 %
= 26.3157889... by calculator
= 26.32% correct to 2 decimal places
Problem 7.
In two successive tests a student
gains marks of 57/79 and 49/67. Is the second
mark better or worse than the ﬁrst?
57/79 = 57
79 = 57
79 × 100% = 5700
79 %
= 72.15% correct to 2 decimal places
49/67 = 49
67 = 49
67 × 100% = 4900
67 %
= 73.13% correct to 2 decimal places
Hence, the second test is marginally better than the
ﬁrst test. This question demonstrates how much easier
it is to compare two fractions when they are expressed
as percentages.
5.2.4
To convert a percentage to a fraction
A percentage is converted to a fraction by dividing by
100 and then, by cancelling, reducing it to its simplest
form.
Problem 8.
Express 75% as a fraction
75% = 75
100
= 3
4
The fraction 75
100 is reduced to its simplest form by can-
celling, i.e. dividing both numerator and denominator
by 25.

Problem 9.
Express 37.5% as a fraction
37.5% = 37.5
100
= 375
1000
by multiplying both numerator and
denominator by 10
= 15
40
by dividing both numerator and
denominator by 25
= 3

means multiply.
Problem 10.
Find 27% of £65
27% of £65 = 27
100 × 65
= £17.55 by calculator
Problem 11.
In a machine shop, it takes 32
minutes to machine a certain part. Using a new tool,
the time can be reduced by 12.5%. Calculate the
new time taken
12.5% of 32 minutes = 12.5
100 × 32
= 4 minutes
Hence, new time taken = 32 −4 = 28 minutes.
Alternatively, if the time is reduced by 12.5%, it now
takes 100% −12.5% = 87.5% of the original time, i.e.
87.5% of 32 minutes = 87.5
100 × 32
= 28 minutes

Problem 12.
A 160 GB iPod is advertised as
costing £190 excluding VAT. If VAT is added at
20%, what will be the total cost of the iPod?
VAT = 20% of £190 = 20
100 × 190 = £38
Total cost of iPod = £190 + £38 = £228
A quicker method to determine the total cost is:
1.20 × £190 = £228
5.3.2
Expressing one quantity as a
percentage of another quantity
To express one quantity as a percentage of another quan-
tity, divide the ﬁrst quantity by the second then multiply
by 100.
Problem 13.
Express 23cm as a percentage of
72cm, correct to the nearest 1%
23cm as a percentage of 72cm = 23
72 × 100%
= 31.94444...%
= 32% correct to

Working in minute units, 2 hours = 2 × 60
= 120 minutes
47 minutes as a percentage
of 120 min = 47
120 × 100%
= 39.2% correct to

Problem 21.
An electrical store makes 40% proﬁt
on each widescreen television it sells. If the selling
price of a 32 inch HD television is £630, what was
the cost to the dealer?
In this case, it is a 40% mark-up in price, so we
use
new value
100 + % change × 100, i.e. a plus sign in the
denominator.
Dealer cost =
new value
100 + % change × 100
=
630
100 + 40 × 100
= 630
140 × 100 = 63000
140
= £450
The dealer buys from the manufacturer for £450 and
sells to his customers for £630.

Chapter 6
Ratio and proportion
Why it is important to understand: Ratio and proportion
Real-life applications of ratio and proportion are numerous. When you prepare recipes, paint your house,
or repair gears in a large machine or in a car transmission, you use ratios and proportions. Trusses must
have the correct ratio of pitch to support the weight of roof and snow, cement must be the correct mixture
to be sturdy, and doctors are always calculating ratios as they determine medications. Almost every job
uses ratios one way or another; ratios are used in building & construction, model making, art & crafts,
land surveying, die and tool making, food and cooking, chemical mixing, in automobile manufacturing
and in aircraft and parts making. Engineers use ratios to test structural and mechanical systems for
capacity and safety issues. Millwrights use ratio to solve pulley rotation and gear problems. Operating
engineers apply ratios to ensure the correct equipment is used to safely move heavy materials such as steel
on worksites. It is therefore important that we have some working understanding of ratio and proportion.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne ratio
•
perform calculations with ratios
•
deﬁne direct proportion
•
perform calculations with direct proportion, including Hooke’s law, Charles’s law and Ohm’s law
•
deﬁne inverse proportion
•
perform calculations with inverse proportion, including Boyle’s law
6.1
Introduction
Ratio is a way of comparing amounts of something; it
shows how much bigger one thing is than the other.
Some practical examples include mixing paint, sand
and cement, or screen wash. Gears, map scales, food
recipes, scale drawings and metal alloy constituents all
use ratios.
Two quantities are in direct proportion when they
increase or decrease in the same ratio. There are
several practical engineering laws which rely on direct
proportion. Also, calculating currency exchange rates
and converting imperial to metric units rely on direct
proportion.
Sometimes, as one quantity increases at a particu-
lar rate, another quantity decreases at the same rate;
this is called inverse proportion. For example, the
time taken to do a job is inversely proportional to the
number of people in a team: double the people, half
the time.

Basic Engineering Mathematics
When we have completed this chapter on ratio and pro-
portion you will be able to understand, and conﬁdently
perform, calculations on the above topics.
For this chapter you will need to know about decimals
and fractions and to be able to use a calculator.
6.2
Ratios
Ratios are generally shown as numbers separated by a
colon (:) so the ratio of 2 and 7 is written as 2:7 and we
read it as a ratio of ‘two to seven.’
Some practical examples which are familiar include:
•
Mixing 1 measure of screen wash to 6 measures of
water; i.e. the ratio of screen wash to water is 1:6
•
Mixing 1 shovel of cement to 4 shovels of sand; i.e.
the ratio of cement to sand is 1:4
•
Mixing 3 parts of red paint to 1 part white, i.e. the
ratio of red to white paint is 3:1
Ratio is the number of parts to a mix. The paint mix is
4 parts total, with 3 parts red and 1 part white. 3 parts
red paint to 1 part white paint means there is
3
4 red paint to 1
4 white paint
Here are some worked examples to help us understand
more about ratios.
Problem 1.
In a class, the ratio of female to male
students is 6:27. Reduce the ratio to its simplest
form
(i)
Both 6 and 27 can be divided by 3
(ii)
Thus, 6:27 is the same as 2:9
6:27 and 2:9 are called equivalent ratios.
It is normal to express ratios in their lowest, or simplest,
form. In this example, the simplest form is 2:9 which
means for every 2 females in the class there are 9 male
students.
Problem 2.
A gear wheel having 128 teeth is in
mesh with a 48-tooth gear. What is the gear ratio?
Gear ratio = 128:48
A ratio can be simpliﬁed by ﬁnding common factors.
(i)
128 and 48 can both be divided by 2, i.e. 128:48
is the same as 64:24
(ii)
64 and 24 can both be divided by 8, i.e. 64:24 is
the same as 8:3
(iii)
There is no number that divides completely into
both 8 and 3 so 8:3 is the simplest ratio, i.e. the
gear ratio is 8:3
Thus, 128:48 is equivalent to 64:24 which is equivalent
to 8:3 and 8:3 is the simplest form.
Problem 3.
A wooden pole is 2.08m long. Divide
it in the ratio of 7 to 19
(i)
Since the ratio is 7:19, the total number of parts
is 7 + 19 = 26 parts.
(ii)
26 parts corresponds to 2.08m = 208cm, hence,
1 part corresponds to 208
26 = 8
(iii)
Thus, 7 parts corresponds to 7 × 8 = 56 cm and
19 parts corresponds to 19 × 8 = 152cm.
Hence, 2.08m divides in the ratio of 7:19 as 56cm
to 152 cm.
(Check: 56 + 152must add up to 208, otherwise an error
would have been made.)
Problem 4.
In a competition, prize money of
£828 is to be shared among the ﬁrst three in the
ratio 5:3:1
(i)
Since the ratio is 5:3:1 the total number of parts
is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 parts.
(ii)
9 parts corresponds to £828
(iii)
1 part corresponds to 828
9
= £92, 3 parts cor-
responds to 3 × £92 = £276 and 5 parts corre-
sponds to 5 × £92 = £460
Hence, £828 divides in the ratio of 5:3:1 as £460
to £276 to £92. (Check: 460 + 276 + 92 must add
up to 828, otherwise an error would have been
made.)

Ratio and proportion

Problem 5.
A map scale is 1:30000. On the map
the distance between two schools is 6cm.
Determine the actual distance between the schools,
giving the answer in kilometres
Actual distance between schools
= 6 × 30000cm = 180000cm
= 180,000
100
m = 1800m
= 1800
1000 m = 1.80km
(1mile ≈1.6km, hence the schools are just over 1mile
apart.)

Here are some further worked examples on ratios.
Problem 6.
Express 45p as a ratio of £7.65 in its
simplest form
(i)
Changing both quantities to the same units, i.e. to
pence, gives a ratio of 45:765
(ii)
Dividing both quantities by 5 gives
45:765 ≡9:153
(iii)
Dividing both quantities by 3 gives
9:153 ≡3:51
(iv)
Dividing both quantities by 3 again gives
3:51 ≡1:17
Thus, 45 p as a ratio of £7.65 is 1:17
45:765,9:153,3:51 and 1:17 are equivalent ratios
and 1:17 is the simplest ratio.
Problem 7.
A glass contains 30ml of whisky
which is 40% alcohol. If 45ml of water is added
and the mixture stirred, what is now the alcohol
content?
(i)
The 30ml of whisky contains 40%
alcohol = 40
100 × 30 = 12ml.
(ii)
After 45ml of water is added we have 30 + 45
= 75ml of ﬂuid, of which alcohol is 12ml.
(iii)
Fraction of alcohol present = 12

Problem 8.
20 tonnes of a mixture of sand and
gravel is 30% sand. How many tonnes of sand must
be added to produce a mixture which is 40%
gravel?

46
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(i)
Amount of sand in 20 tonnes = 30% of 20 t
= 30
100 × 20 = 6t
(ii)
If the mixture has 6t of sand then amount of
gravel = 20 −6 = 14t
(iii)
We want this 14t of gravel to be 40% of the
new mixture. 1% would be 14
40 t and 100% of the
mixture would be 14
40 × 100t = 35t
(iv)
If there is 14t of gravel then amount of sand
= 35 −14 = 21t
(v)
We already have 6t of sand, so amount of sand
to be added to produce a mixture with 40%
gravel = 21 −6 = 15t
(Note 1tonne = 1000kg.)

6.3
Direct proportion
Two quantities are in direct proportion when they
increase or decrease in the same ratio. For example,
if 12 cans of lager have a mass of 4kg, then 24 cans
of lager will have a mass of 8kg; i.e. if the quantity
of cans doubles then so does the mass. This is direct
proportion.
In the previous section we had an example of mixing
1 shovel of cement to 4 shovels of sand; i.e. the ratio
of cement to sand was 1:4. So, if we have a mix of 10
shovels of cement and 40 shovels of sand andwe wanted
to double the amount of the mix then we would need
to double both the cement and sand, i.e. 20 shovels of
cement and 80 shovels of sand. This is another example
of direct proportion.
Here are three laws in engineering which involve direct
proportion:
(a)
Hooke’s law∗states that, within the elastic limit
of a material, the strain ε produced is directly pro-
portional to the stress σ producing it, i.e. ε ∝σ
(note than ‘∝’ means ‘is proportional to’).
∗Who was Hooke? – Robert Hooke FRS (28 July 1635–3
March 1703) was an English natural philosopher, architect and
polymath who, amongst other things, discovered the law of
elasticity. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

(b)
Charles’s law∗states that, for a given mass of
gas at constant pressure, the volume V is directly
proportional to its thermodynamic temperature T ,
i.e. V ∝T.
(c)
Ohm’s law†states that the current I ﬂowing
through a ﬁxed resistance is directly proportional
to the applied voltage V , i.e. I ∝V .
Here are some worked examples to help us understand
more about direct proportion.
Problem 9.
Three energy saving light bulbs cost
£7.80. Determine the cost of seven such light bulbs
(i)
3 light bulbs cost £7.80
(ii)
Therefore, 1 light bulb costs 7.80
3
= £2.60
Hence, 7 light bulbs cost 7 × £2.60 = £18.20
Problem 10.
If 56litres of petrol costs £72.80,
calculate the cost of 32litres
(i)
56litres of petrol costs £72.80
(ii)
Therefore, 1 litre of petrol costs 72.80
56
= £1.30
Hence, 32 litres cost 32 × 1.30 = £41.60
∗Who was Charles? – Jacques Alexandre César Charles
(12 November 1746 – 7 April 1823) was a French inven-
tor, scientist, mathematician and balloonist. Charles’s law

Problem 11.
Hooke’s law states that stress, σ, is
directly proportional to strain, ε, within the elastic
limit of a material. When, for mild steel, the stress
is 63MPa, the strain is 0.0003. Determine (a) the
value of strain when the stress is 42MPa, (b) the
value of stress when the strain is 0.00072
(a)
Stress is directly proportional to strain.
(i) When the stress is 63MPa, the strain is
0.0003
(ii) Hence, a stress of 1MPa corresponds to a
strain of 0.0003
63
(iii) Thus,the value of strain when the stress is
42MPa = 0.0003
63
× 42 = 0.0002
(b)
Strain is proportional to stress.
(i) When the strain is 0.0003, the stress is
63MPa.
(ii) Hence, a strain of 0.0001 corresponds to
63
3 MPa.
(iii) Thus,the value of stress when the strain is
0.00072 = 63
3 × 7.2 = 151.2 MPa.
Problem 12.
Charles’s law states that for a given
mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume is
directly proportional to its thermodynamic
temperature. A gas occupies a volume of 2.4litres
at 600K. Determine (a) the temperature when the
volume is 3.2litres, (b) the volume at 540K
(a)
Volume is directly proportional to temperature.
(i) When the volume is 2.4litres, the tempera-
ture is 600K.
(ii) Hence, a volume of 1 litre corresponds to a
temperature of 600
2.4 K.
(iii) Thus,the temperature when the volume is
3.2 litres = 600
2.4 × 3.2 = 800K
(b)
Temperature is proportional to volume.
(i) When the temperature is 600K, the volume
is 2.4litres.

48
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(ii) Hence, a temperature of 1K corresponds to
a volume of 2.4
600litres.
(iii) Thus, the volume at a temperature of
540K = 2.4
600 × 540 = 2.16 litres.

Problem 13.
Some guttering on a house has to
decline by 3mm for every 70cm to allow rainwater
to drain. The gutter spans 8.4m. How much lower
should the low end be?
(i)
The guttering has to decline in the ratio 3:700 or
3
700
(ii)
If d is the vertical drop in 8.4m or 8400mm, then
the decline must be in the ratio d :8400 or
d

(iii)
Now
d
8400 =

(iv)
Cross-multiplying gives 700×d =8400×3 from
which,
d = 8400 × 3

i.e. d = 36mm, which is how much lower the end
should be to allow rainwater to drain.
Problem 14.
Ohm’s law states that the current
ﬂowing in a ﬁxed resistance is directly proportional
to the applied voltage. When 90mV is applied
across a resistor the current ﬂowing is 3A.
Determine (a) the current when the voltage is
60mV and (b) the voltage when the current is 4.2A
(a)
Current is directly proportional to the voltage.
(i) When voltage is 90mV, the current is 3A.
(ii) Hence, a voltage of 1mV corresponds to a
current of 3
90 A.
(iii) Thus, when the voltage is 60mV, the
current = 60 × 3
90 = 2A.
(b)
Voltage is directly proportional to the current.
(i) When current is 3A, the voltage is 90mV.
(ii) Hence, a current of 1A corresponds to a
voltage of 90
3 mV = 30mV.
(iii) Thus, when the current is 4.2 A, the
voltage = 30 × 4.2 = 126mV.

Inverse proportion
Two variables, x and y, are in inverse proportion to one
another if y is proportional to 1
x , i.e. y α 1
x or y = k
x or
k = xy where k is a constant, called the coefﬁcient of
proportionality.
Inverse proportion means that, as the value of one vari-
able increases, the value of another decreases, and that
their product is always the same.
For example, the time for a journey is inversely propor-
tional to the speed of travel. So, if at 30m.p.h. a journey
is completed in 20 minutes, then at 60m.p.h.the journey
would be completed in 10 minutes. Double the speed,
half the journey time. (Note that 30 × 20 = 60 × 10)
In another example, the time needed to dig a hole is
inversely proportional to the number of people digging.
So, if four men take 3 hours to dig a hole, then two men
(working at the same rate) would take 6 hours. Half the
men, twice the time. (Note that 4 × 3 = 2 × 6)
Here are some worked examples on inverse proportion.

It is estimated that a team of four

when the resistance is 4ohms
(a)
R α 1
A, i.e. R = k
A or k = RA. Hence, when
R = 7.2 and A = 5, the
coefﬁcient of proportionality,k = (7.2)(5) = 36
(b)
Since k = RA then A = k
R . Hence, when R = 4,
the cross sectional area, A = 36
4 = 9 mm2

Powers, roots and laws
of indices
Why it is important to understand: Powers, roots and laws of indices
Powers and roots are used extensively in mathematics and engineering, so it is important to get a good
grasp of what they are and how, and why, they are used. Being able to multiply powers together by
adding their indices is particularly useful for disciplines like engineering and electronics, where quantities
are often expressed as a value multiplied by some power of ten. In the ﬁeld of electrical engineering,
for example, the relationship between electric current, voltage and resistance in an electrical system is
critically important, and yet the typical unit values for these properties can differ by several orders of
magnitude. Studying, or working, in an engineering discipline, you very quickly become familiar with
powers and roots and laws of indices. This chapter provides an important lead into Chapter 8 which deals
with units, preﬁxes and engineering notation.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the terms base, index and power
•
understand square roots
•
perform calculations with powers and roots
•
state the laws of indices
•
perform calculations using the laws of indices
7.1
Introduction
The manipulationof powers and roots is a crucial under-
lying skill needed in algebra. In this chapter, powers and
roots of numbers are explained, together with the laws
of indices.
Many worked examples are included to help under-
standing.

Powers and roots
7.2.1
Indices
The number 16 is the same as 2× 2 × 2 × 2, and 2× 2 ×
2 × 2 can be abbreviated to 24. When written as 24, 2 is
called the base and the 4 is called the index or power.
24 is read as ‘two to the power of four’.
Similarly, 35 is read as ‘three to the power of 5’

Powers, roots and laws of indices
53
When the indices are 2 and 3 they are given special
names; i.e. 2 is called ‘squared’ and 3 is called ‘cubed’.
Thus,
42 is called ‘four squared’ rather than ‘4 to the power
of 2’ and
53 is called ‘ﬁve cubed’ rather than ‘5 to the power of 3’
When no index is shown, the power is 1. For example,
2 means 21
Problem 1.
Evaluate (a) 26 (b) 34
(a)
26 means 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 (i.e. 2 multiplied
by itself 6 times), and 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 64
i.e.
26 = 64
(b)
34 means 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 (i.e. 3 multiplied by itself
4 times), and 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81
i.e.
34 = 81
Problem 2.
Change the following to index form:
(a) 32 (b) 625
(a) (i)
To express 32 in its lowest factors, 32 is initially
divided by the lowest prime number, i.e. 2
(ii)
32 ÷ 2 = 16, hence 32 = 2 × 16
(iii)
16 is also divisible by 2, i.e. 16 = 2 × 8. Thus,
32 = 2 × 2 × 8
(iv)
8 is also divisible by 2, i.e. 8 = 2 × 4. Thus,
32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 4
(v)
4 is also divisible by 2, i.e. 4 = 2 × 2. Thus,
32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
(vi)
Thus, 32 = 25
(b) (i)
625 is not divisible by the lowest prime num-
ber, i.e. 2. The next prime number is 3 and 625
is not divisible by 3 either. The next prime
number is 5
(ii)
625 ÷ 5 = 125, i.e. 625 = 5 × 125
(iii)
125 is also divisible by 5, i.e. 125 = 5 × 25.
Thus, 625 = 5 × 5 × 25
(iv)
25 is also divisible by 5, i.e. 25 = 5 × 5. Thus,
625 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5
(v)
Thus, 625 = 54

Square roots
When a number is multiplied by itself the product is
called a square.
For example, the square of 3 is 3 × 3 = 32 = 9
A square root is the reverse process; i.e. the value of the
base which when multiplied by itself gives the number;
i.e. the square root of 9 is 3
The symbol
√
is used to denote a square root. Thus,
√
9 = 3. Similarly,
√
4 = 2 and
√
25 = 5
Because −3 × −3 = 9,
√
9 also equals −3. Thus,
√
9 =
+3 or −3 which is usually written as
√
9 = ±3. Simi-
larly,

Laws of indices
There are six laws of indices.
(1)
From earlier, 22 × 23 = (2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2)
= 32
= 25
Hence,
22 × 23 = 25
or
22 × 23 = 22+3
This is the ﬁrst law of indices, which demonstrates
that when multiplying two or more numbers
having the same base, the indices are added.
(2)
25
23 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2 × 2
= 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 2
1 × 1 × 1
= 2 × 2
1
= 4 = 22
Hence,
25
23 = 22
or
25
23 = 25−3
This is the second law of indices, which demon-
strates that when dividing two numbers having
the same base, the index in the denominator is
subtracted from the index in the numerator.
(3)
(35)2 = 35×2 = 310
and (22)3 = 22×3 = 26
This is the third law of indices, which demon-
strates that when a number which is raised to
a power is raised to a further power, the indices
are multiplied.
(4)
30 = 1 and 170 = 1
This is the fourth law of indices, which states that
when a number has an index of 0, its value is 1.
(5)
3−4 = 1
34
and
1
2−3 = 23
This is the ﬁfth law of indices, which demonstrates
that a number raised to a negative power is the
reciprocal of that number raised to a positive
power.

This is the sixth law of indices, which demon-
strates that when a number is raised to a frac-
tional power the denominator of the fraction is
the rootof the number and the numerator is the
power.
Here are some worked examples using the laws of
indices.

Understanding powers of ten is important, especially
when dealing with preﬁxes in Chapter 8. For example,
102 = 100,103 = 1000,104 = 10000,
105 = 100000,106 = 1000000

Chapter 8
Units, prefixes and
engineering notation
Why it is important to understand: Units, preﬁxes and engineering notation
In engineering there are many different quantities to get used to, and hence many units to become familiar
with. For example, force is measured in newtons, electric current is measured in amperes and pressure is
measured in pascals. Sometimes the units of these quantities are either very large or very small and hence
preﬁxes are used. For example, 1000 pascals may be written as 103 Pa which is written as 1 kPa in preﬁx
form, the k being accepted as a symbol to represent 1000 or 103. Studying, or working, in an engineering
discipline, you very quickly become familiar with the standard units of measurement, the preﬁxes used
and engineering notation. An electronic calculator is extremely helpful with engineering notation.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the seven SI units
•
understand derived units
•
recognise common engineering units
•
understand common preﬁxes used in engineering
•
express decimal numbers in standard form
•
use engineering notation and preﬁx form with engineering units
8.1
Introduction
Of considerable importance in engineering is a knowl-
edge of units of engineeringquantities, the preﬁxes used
with units, and engineering notation.
We need to know, for example, that
80kV = 80 × 103 V, which means 80000 volts
and
25mA = 25 × 10−3A,
which means 0.025 amperes
and
50nF = 50 × 10−9 F,
which means 0.000000050 farads
This is explained in this chapter.
8.2
SI units
The system of units used in engineering and science
is the Système Internationale d’Unités (International
System of Units), usually abbreviated to SI units, and is
based on the metric system. This was introduced in 1960
and has now been adopted by the majority of countries
as the official system of measurement.
The basic seven units used in the SI system are listed in
Table 8.1 with their symbols.
There are, of course, many units other than these seven.
These other units are called derived units and are

For example, speed is measured in metres per second,

time.
*Who was Newton? – Sir Isaac Newton PRS MP (25 Decem-
ber 1642–20 March 1727) was an English polymath. Newton
showed that the motions of objects are governed by the same
set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.

Some derived units are given special names. For exam-
ple, force = mass × acceleration has units of kilogram
metre per second squared, which uses three of the
base units, i.e. kilograms, metres and seconds. The unit
of kg m/s2 is given the special name of a newton∗.
Table 8.2 contains a list of some quantities and their
units that are common in engineering.
8.3
Common prefixes
SI units may be made larger or smaller by using prefixes
which denote multiplication or division by a particular
amount.
The most common multiples are listed in Table 8.3.
A knowledge of indices is needed since all of the pre-
ﬁxes are powers of 10 with indices that are a multiple
of 3.
Here are some examples of preﬁxes used with engineer-
ing units.
A frequency of 15 GHz means 15 × 109 Hz, which is
15000000000 hertz∗,
i.e. 15 gigahertz is written as 15GHz and is equal to 15
thousand million hertz.
∗Who was Hertz? – Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (22 February
1857–1January1894)wasthe ﬁrstperson toconclusively prove
the existence of electromagnetic waves. The scientiﬁc unit of
frequency – cycles per second – was named the ‘hertz’ in his
honour. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

neater, takes up less space and prevents errors caused
by having so many zeros, to write the frequency as
15GHz.)

A force of 20kN means 20 × 103 N, which is 20000
newtons,
i.e. 20 kilonewtons is written as 20kN and is equal to
20 thousand newtons.
A charge of 30μC means 30 × 10−6 C or 30
106 C, which
is 0.000030C,
i.e. 30 microcoulombs is written as 30μC and is equal

A capacitance of 45pF means 45 × 10−12 F or 45
1012 F,
which is 0.000000000045F,
∗Who was Henry? – Joseph Henry (17 December 1797–
13 May 1878) was an American scientist who discovered the
electromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also dis-
covered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday,
though Faraday was the ﬁrst to publish his results. Henry was
the inventor of a precursor to the electric doorbell and electric
relay. The SI unit of inductance, the henry, is named in his
honour. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

Standard form
A number written with one digit to the left of thedecimal
point and multiplied by 10 raised to some power is said
to be written in standard form.

Engineering notation
In engineering, standard form is not as important as
engineering notation. Engineering notation is similar
to standard form except that the power of 10 is always
a multiple of 3.
For example,
43645 = 43.645 × 103
in engineering notation
and
0.0534 = 53.4× 10−3
in engineering notation
From the list of engineering prefixes on page 62 it is
apparent that all prefixes involve powers of 10 that are
multiples of 3.
For example, a force of 43645N can rewritten as
43.645 × 103N and from the list of preﬁxes can then
be expressed as 43.645kN.
Thus,
43645N ≡43.645kN
To help further, on your calculator is an ‘ENG’ button.
Enter the number 43645 into your calculator and then
press =. Now press the ENG button and the answer is
43.645 × 103. We then have to appreciate that 103 is the
prefix ‘kilo’, giving 43645N ≡43.645 kN.
In another example, let a current be 0.0745A. Enter
0.0745 into your calculator. Press =. Now press
ENG and the answer is 74.5 × 10−3. We then have
to appreciate that 10−3 is the preﬁx ‘milli’, giving
0.0745A ≡74.5mA.
Problem 6.
Express the following in engineering
notation and in prefix form:
(a) 300000W (b) 0.000068H
(a)
Enter 300000 into the calculator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 300 × 103
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 103 corre-
sponds to kilo.
Hence, 300000W = 300 × 103 W in engineering
notation
= 300 kW in prefix form.
(b)
Enter 0.000068 into the calculator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 68 × 10−6
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 10−6
corresponds to micro.
Hence, 0.000068H = 68 × 10−6 H in engineering
notation
= 68μH in prefix form.
Problem 7.
Express the following in engineering
notation and in prefix form:
(a) 42 × 105 
(b) 4.7 × 10−10F
(a)
Enter 42 × 105 into the calculator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 4.2 × 106
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 106 corre-
sponds to mega.
Hence, 42 × 105  = 4.2 × 106  in engineering
notation
= 4.2 M in prefix form.
(b)
Enter 47 ÷ 1010 =
47
10000000000 into the calcu-
lator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 4.7 × 10−9
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 10−9
corresponds to nano.
Hence, 47 ÷1010 F = 4.7 × 10−9 F in engineer-
ing notation
= 4.7nF in prefix form.
Problem 8.
Rewrite (a) 0.056mA in μA
(b) 16700kHz as MHz
(a)
Enter 0.056 ÷ 1000 into the calculator (since milli
means ÷1000). Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 56 × 10−6
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 10−6
corresponds to micro.

66
Basic Engineering Mathematics
Hence, 0.056mA = 0.056
1000 A = 56 × 10−6 A
= 56μA.
(b)
Enter 16700× 1000 into the calculator (since kilo
means ×1000). Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 16.7 × 106
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 106 corre-
sponds to mega.
Hence, 16700kHz = 16700 × 1000Hz
= 16.7 × 106Hz
= 16.7MHz
Problem 9.
Rewrite (a) 63 × 104 V in kV
(b) 3100pF in nF
(a)
Enter 63 × 104 into the calculator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 630 × 103
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 103 corre-
sponds to kilo.
Hence, 63 × 104 V = 630 × 103 V = 630kV.
(b)
Enter 3100 × 10−12 into the calculator. Press =
Now press ENG and the answer is 3.1 × 10−9
From the table of preﬁxes on page 62, 10−9
corresponds to nano.
Hence, 3100pF = 31 × 10−12 F = 3.1 × 10−9 F
= 3.1 nF
Problem 10.
Rewrite (a) 14700mm in metres
(b) 276cm in metres (c) 3.375kg in grams
(a)
1m = 1000mm, hence
1mm =
1
1000 =
1
103 = 10−3 m.
Hence, 14700mm = 14700 × 10−3 m = 14.7m.
(b)
1m=100cm, hence 1cm= 1
100 = 1
102 =10−2 m.
Hence, 276cm = 276 × 10−2 m = 2.76m.
(c)
1kg = 1000g = 103 g
Hence, 3.375kg = 3.375 × 103g = 3375g.

Chapter 9
Basic algebra
Why it is important to understand: Basic algebra
Algebra is one of the most fundamental tools for engineers because it allows them to determine the
value of something (length, material constant, temperature, mass, and so on) given values that they do
know (possibly other length, material properties, mass). Although the types of problems that mechanical,
chemical, civil, environmental or electrical engineers deal with vary, all engineers use algebra to solve
problems. An example where algebra is frequently used is in simple electrical circuits, where the resistance
is proportional to voltage. Using Ohm’s law, or V = IR, an engineer simply multiplies the current in a
circuit by the resistance to determine the voltage across the circuit. Engineers and scientists use algebra
in many ways, and so frequently that they don’t even stop the think about it. Depending on what type of
engineer you choose to be, you will use varying degrees of algebra, but in all instances algebra lays the
foundation for the mathematics you will need to become an engineer.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand basic operations in algebra
•
add, subtract, multiply and divide using letters instead of numbers
•
state the laws of indices in letters instead of numbers
•
simplify algebraic expressions using the laws of indices
9.1
Introduction
We are already familiar with evaluating formulae using
a calculator from Chapter 4.
For example, if the length of a football pitch is L and its
width is b, then the formula for the area A is given by
A = L × b
This is an algebraic equation.
If L = 120m and b = 60m, then the area
A = 120 × 60 = 7200m2.
The total resistance, RT , of resistors R1, R2 and R3
connected in series is given by
RT = R1 + R2 + R3
This is an algebraic equation.
If R1 = 6.3k, R2 = 2.4k and R3 = 8.5k, then
RT = 6.3 + 2.4+ 8.5 = 17.2k
The temperature in Fahrenheit, F, is given by
F = 9
5C + 32

where C is the temperature in Celsius∗. This is an
algebraic equation.
If C = 100◦C, then F = 9
5 × 100 + 32
= 180 + 32 = 212◦F.
If you can cope with evaluating formulae then you will
be able to cope with algebra.
9.2
Basic operations
Algebra merely uses letters to represent numbers.
If, say, a,b,c and d represent any four numbers then in
algebra:
(a)
a + a + a + a = 4a. For example, if a = 2, then
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 4 × 2 = 8
(b)
5b means 5 × b. For example, if b = 4, then
5b = 5 × 4 = 20
(c)
2a+ 3b + a −2b = 2a + a + 3b −2b = 3a + b
Only similar terms can be combined in algebra.
The 2a and the +a can be combined to give 3a
∗Who was Celsius? – Anders Celsius (27 November 1701–
25 April 1744) was the Swedish astronomer that proposed the
Celsius temperature scale in 1742 which takes his name. To
ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
and the 3b and −2b can be combined to give 1b,
which is written as b.
In addition, with terms separated by+ and −signs,
the order in which they are written does not matter.
In this example, 2a + 3b + a −2b is the same as
2a + a + 3b −2b, which is the same as 3b + a +
2a −2b, and so on. (Note that the ﬁrst term, i.e.
2a, means +2a)
(d)
4abcd = 4 × a × b × c × d
For example, if a = 3,b = −2,c = 1 and d = −5,
then 4abcd = 4 × 3 × −2 × 1 × −5 = 120. (Note
that −× −= +)
(e)
(a)(c)(d) means a × c × d
Brackets are often used instead of multiplication
signs.
For example, (2)(5)(3) means 2 × 5 × 3 = 30
(f)
ab = ba
If a = 2 and b = 3 then 2 × 3 is exactly the same
as 3 × 2, i.e. 6
(g)
b2 = b × b.
For
example,
if
b = 3,
then
32 = 3 × 3 = 9
(h)
a3 = a × a × a
For
example, if
a = 2,
then
23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

basic operations in this introduction to algebra.

Multiplying by a gives
2a2 + 3ab
Multiplying by b gives

Problem 14.
Divide 2x2 + x −3 by x −1

2x2 + x −3 is called the dividend and x −1 the
divisor. The usual layout is shown below with the
dividend and divisor both arranged in descending
powers of the symbols.
2x + 3


2x2 + x −3

.
.
(ii)
Dividing the ﬁrst term of the dividend by the
ﬁrst term of the divisor, i.e. 2x2
x
gives 2x, which
is put above the ﬁrst term of the dividend as
shown.
(iii)
The divisor is then multiplied by 2x, i.e.
2x(x −1) = 2x2 −2x, which is placed under the
dividend as shown. Subtracting gives 3x −3
(iv)
The process is then repeated, i.e. the ﬁrst term
of the divisor, x, is divided into 3x, giving +3,
which is placed above the dividend as shown.
(v)
Then 3(x −1) = 3x −3, which is placed under
the 3x −3. The remainder, on subtraction, is zero,
which completes the process.
Thus, (2x2 + x −3) ÷ (x−1)=(2x + 3)
(A check can be made on this answer by
multiplying (2x + 3) by (x −1), which equals
2x2 + x −3)

Further algebra
Why it is important to understand: Further algebra
Algebra is a form of mathematics that allows you to work with unknowns. If you do not know what
a number is, arithmetic does not allow you to use it in calculations. Algebra has variables. Variables
are labels for numbers and measurements you do not yet know. Algebra lets you use these variables in
equations and formulae. A basic form of mathematics, algebra is nevertheless among the most commonly
used forms of mathematics in the workforce. Although relatively simple, algebra possesses a powerful
problem-solving tool used in many ﬁelds of engineering. For example, in designing a rocket to go to the
moon, an engineer must use algebra to solve for ﬂight trajectory, how long to burn each thruster and at
what intensity, and at what angle to lift off. An engineer uses mathematics all the time – and in particular,
algebra. Becoming familiar with algebra will make all engineering mathematics studies so much easier.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
use brackets with basic operations in algebra
•
understand factorisation
•
factorise simple algebraic expressions
•
use the laws of precedence to simplify algebraic expressions
10.1
Introduction
In this chapter, the use of brackets and factorisation
with algebra is explained, together with further practice
with the laws of precedence. Understanding of these
topics is often necessary when solving and transposing
equations.

Brackets
With algebra
(a)
2(a + b) = 2a + 2b
(b)
(a + b)(c + d) = a(c + d) + b(c + d)
= ac + ad + bc + bd
Here are some worked examples to help understanding
of brackets with algebra.
Problem 1.
Determine 2b(a −5b)
2b(a −5b) = 2b × a + 2b × −5b
= 2ba −10b2
= 2ab −10b2
(Note that 2ba is the
same as 2ab)

= 3x2 −3xy + 4xy −4y2
(Note that 4yx is the same as 4xy)
= 3x2 + xy −4y2
Problem 3.
Simplify 3(2x −3y) −(3x −y)
3(2x −3y) −(3x −y) = 3 × 2x −3 × 3y −3x −−y
(Note that −(3x −y) = −1(3x −y) and the
−1 multiplies both terms in the bracket)
= 6x −9y −3x + y
(Note: −×−= +)
= 6x −3x + y −9y

expression and simplify 2[x2 −3x(y + x) + 4xy]

Factorisation
The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8 because 8 divides by
1, 2, 4 and 8
The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and24 because 24
divides by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24
The common factors of 8 and 24 are 1, 2, 4 and 8 since
1, 2, 4 and 8 are factors of both 8 and 24
The highest common factor (HCF) is the largest
number that divides into two or more terms.
Hence, the HCF of 8 and 24 is 8, as explained in
Chapter 1.
When two or more terms in an algebraic expressioncon-
tain a common factor, then this factor can be shown
outside of a bracket. For example,
d f + dg = d( f + g)
which is just the reverse of
d( f + g) = d f + dg
This process is called factorisation.
Here are some worked examples to help understanding
of factorising in algebra.
Problem 9.
Factorise ab −5ac
a is common to both terms ab and −5ac. a is there-
fore taken outside of the bracket. What goes inside the
bracket?
(i)
What multiplies a to make ab? Answer: b
(ii)
What multiplies a to make −5ac? Answer: −5c
Hence, b −5c appears in the bracket. Thus,
ab −5ac = a(b −5c)
Problem 10.
Factorise 2x2 + 14xy3
For the numbers 2 and 14, the highest common factor
(HCF) is 2 (i.e. 2 is the largest number that divides into
both 2 and 14).
For the x terms, x2 and x, the HCF is x
Thus, the HCF of 2x2 and 14xy3 is 2x
2x is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes
inside the bracket?
(i)
What multiplies 2x to make 2x2? Answer: x
(ii)
What multiplies 2x to make 14xy3? Answer: 7y3
Hence x + 7y3 appears inside the bracket. Thus,
2x2 + 14x y3 = 2x(x + 7y3)
Problem 11.
Factorise 3x3y −12xy2 + 15xy
For the numbers 3, 12 and 15,thehighest common factor
is 3 (i.e. 3 is the largest number that divides into 3, 12
and 15).
For the x terms, x3,x and x, the HCF is x
For the y terms, y, y2 and y, the HCF is y
Thus, the HCF of 3x3y and 12xy2 and 15xy is 3xy
3xy is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes
inside the bracket?
(i)
What multiplies 3xy to make 3x3y? Answer: x2
(ii)
What multiplies 3xy to make −12xy2? Answer:
−4y
(iii)
What multiplies 3xy to make 15xy? Answer: 5
Hence, x2 −4y + 5 appears inside the bracket. Thus,
3x3 y −12x y2 + 15x y = 3xy(x2 −4y + 5)
Problem 12.
Factorise 25a2b5 −5a3b2
For the numbers 25 and 5, the highest common factor
is 5 (i.e. 5 is the largest number that divides into 25
and 5).
For the a terms, a2 and a3, the HCF is a2
For the b terms, b5 and b2, the HCF is b2
Thus, the HCF of 25a2b5 and 5a3b2 is 5a2b2
5a2b2 is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What
goes inside the bracket?

Further algebra

(i)
What multiplies 5a2b2 to make 25a2b5? Answer:
5b3
(ii)
What multiplies 5a2b2 to make −5a3b2? Answer:
−a
Hence, 5b3−a appears in the bracket. Thus,
25a2b5 −5a3b2 = 5a2b2(5b3 −a)
Problem 13.
Factorise ax −ay + bx −by
The ﬁrst two terms have a common factor of a and the
last two terms a common factor of b. Thus,
ax −ay + bx −by = a(x −y) + b(x −y)
The two newly formed terms have a common factor of
(x −y). Thus,
a(x −y) + b(x −y) = (x −y)(a + b)
Problem 14.
Factorise 2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by
a is a common factor of the ﬁrst two terms and b a
common factor of the last two terms. Thus,
2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by = a(2x −3y) + b(2x −3y)
(2x −3y) is now a common factor. Thus,
a(2x −3y) + b(2x −3y) = (2x −3y)(a + b)
Alternatively, 2x is a common factor of the original
ﬁrst and third terms and −3y is a common factor of
the second and fourth terms. Thus,
2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by = 2x(a + b) −3y(a + b)
(a + b) is now a common factor. Thus,
2x(a + b) −3y(a + b) = (a + b)(2x −3y)
as before
Problem 15.
Factorise x3 + 3x2 −x −3
x2 is a common factor of the ﬁrst two terms. Thus,
x3 + 3x2 −x −3 = x2(x + 3) −x −3
−1 is a common factor of the last two terms. Thus,
x2(x + 3) −x −3 = x2(x + 3) −1(x + 3)
(x + 3) is now a common factor. Thus,
x2(x + 3) −1(x −3) = (x + 3)(x2 −1)

Laws of precedence
Sometimes addition, subtraction, multiplication, divi-
sion, powers and brackets can all be involved in an
algebraic expression. With mathematics there is a deﬁ-
nite order of precedence (ﬁrst met in Chapter 1) which
we need to adhere to.
With the laws of precedence the order is

Chapter 11
Solving simple equations
Why it is important to understand: Solving simple equations
In mathematics, engineering and science, formulae are used to relate physical quantities to each other.
They provide rules so that if we know the values of certain quantities, we can calculate the values of
others. Equations occur in all branches of engineering. Simple equations always involve one unknown
quantity which we try to ﬁnd when we solve the equation. In reality, we all solve simple equations in our
heads all the time without even noticing it. If, for example, you have bought two CDs, for the same price,
and a DVD, and know that you spent £25 in total and that the DVD was £11, then you actually solve the
linear equation 2x + 11 = 25 to ﬁnd out that the price of each CD was £7. It is probably true to say that
there is no branch of engineering, physics, economics, chemistry and computer science which does not
require the solution of simple equations. The ability to solve simple equations is another stepping stone
on the way to having conﬁdence to handle engineering mathematics.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
distinguish between an algebraic expression and an algebraic equation
•
maintain the equality of a given equation whilst applying arithmetic operations
•
solve linear equations in one unknown including those involving brackets and fractions
•
form and solve linear equations involved with practical situations
•
evaluate an unknown quantity in a formula by substitution of data

Introduction
3x −4 is an example of an algebraic expression.
3x −4 = 2 is an example of an algebraic equation (i.e.
it contains an ‘=’ sign).
An equation is simply a statement that two expressions
are equal.
Hence,
A = πr2 (where A is the area of a circle
of radius r)
F = 9
5C + 32 (which relates Fahrenheit and
Celsius temperatures)
and
y = 3x + 2 (which is the equation of a
straight line graph)
are all examples of equations.
11.2
Solving equations
To ‘solve an equation’ means ‘to ﬁnd the value of the
unknown’. For example, solving 3x −4 = 2 means that
the value of x is required.
In this example, x = 2. How did we arrive at x = 2?
This is the purpose of this chapter – to show how to
solve such equations.

Solving simple equations
83
Many equations occur in engineering and it is essential
that we can solve them when needed.
Here are some examples to demonstrate how simple
equations are solved.
Problem 1.
Solve the equation 4x = 20
Dividing each side of the equation by 4 gives
4x
4 = 20
4
i.e. x = 5 by cancelling, which is the solution to the
equation 4x = 20
The same operation must be applied to both sides of an
equation so that the equality is maintained.
We can do anything we like to an equation, as long
as we do the same to both sides. This is, in fact, the
only rule to remember when solving simple equations
(and also when transposing formulae, which we do in
Chapter 12).
Problem 2.
Solve the equation 2x
5 = 6
Multiplying both sides by 5 gives
5
2x
5

= 5(6)
Cancelling and removing brackets gives 2x = 30
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives
2x
2 = 30
2
Cancelling gives
x = 15
which is the solution of the equation 2x
5 = 6
Problem 3.
Solve the equation a −5 = 8
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives
a −5 + 5 = 8 + 5
i.e.
a = 8 + 5
i.e.
a = 13
which is the solution of the equation a −5 = 8
Note that adding 5 to both sides of the above equation
results in the −5 moving from the LHS to the RHS, but
the sign is changed to +
Problem 4.
Solve the equation x + 3 = 7
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives x + 3 −3 = 7 −3
i.e.
x = 7 −3
i.e.
x = 4
which is the solution of the equation x + 3 = 7
Note that subtracting 3 from both sides of the above
equation results in the +3 moving from the LHS to the
RHS, but the sign is changed to –. So, we can move
straight from x + 3 = 7 to x = 7 −3
Thus, a term can be moved from one side of an equa-
tion to the other as long as a change in sign is made.
Problem 5.
Solve the equation 6x + 1 = 2x + 9
In such equations the terms containing x are grouped
on one side of the equation and the remaining terms
grouped on the other side of the equation. As in Prob-
lems 3 and 4, changing from one side of an equation to
the other must be accompanied by a change of sign.
Since
6x + 1 = 2x + 9
then
6x −2x = 9 −1
i.e.
4x = 8
Dividing both sides by 4 gives
4x
4 = 8
4
Cancelling gives
x = 2
which is the solution of the equation 6x + 1 = 2x + 9.
In the above examples, the solutions can be checked.
Thus, in Problem 5, where 6x + 1 = 2x + 9, if x = 2,
then
LHS of equation = 6(2) + 1 = 13
RHS of equation = 2(2) + 9 = 13
Since the left hand side (LHS) equals the right hand
side (RHS) then x = 2 must be the correct solution of
the equation.
When solving simple equations, always check your
answers by substituting your solution back into the
original equation.
Problem 6.
Solve the equation 4 −3p = 2p −11
In order to keep the p term positive the terms in p are
moved to the RHS and the constant terms to the LHS.
Similar to Problem 5, if 4 −3p = 2p −11
then
4 + 11 = 2p + 3p
i.e.
15 = 5p
Dividing both sides by 5 gives
15
5 = 5p
5
Cancelling gives
3 = p
or
p = 3
which is the solution of the equation 4 −3p = 2p −11.

84
Basic Engineering Mathematics
By substituting p = 3 into the original equation, the
solution may be checked.
LHS = 4 −3(3) = 4 −9 = −5
RHS = 2(3) −11 = 6 −11 = −5
Since LHS = RHS, the solution p = 3 must be correct.
If, in this example, the unknown quantities had been
grouped initially on the LHS instead of the RHS, then
−3p −2p = −11 −4
i.e.
−5p = −15
from which,
−5p
−5 = −15
−5
and
p = 3
as before.
It is often easier, however, to work with positive values
where possible.
Problem 7.
Solve the equation 3(x −2) = 9
Removing the bracket gives 3x −6 = 9
Rearranging gives
3x = 9 + 6
i.e.
3x = 15
Dividing both sides by 3 gives
x = 5
which is the solution of the equation 3(x −2) = 9.
Theequation may bechecked by substituting x = 5 back
into the original equation.
Problem 8.
Solve the equation
4(2r −3) −2(r −4) = 3(r −3) −1
Removing brackets gives
8r −12 −2r + 8 = 3r −9 −1
Rearranging gives
8r −2r −3r = −9 −1 + 12−8
i.e.
3r = −6
Dividing both sides by 3 gives
r = −6
3 = −2
which is the solution of the equation
4(2r −3) −2(r −4) = 3(r −3) −1
The solution may be checked by substituting r = −2
back into the original equation.
LHS = 4(−4 −3) −2(−2 −4) = −28 + 12 = −16
RHS = 3(−2 −3) −1 = −15 −1 = −16
Since LHS = RHS then r = −2 is the correct solution.

When there is just one fraction on each side of the equa-
tion as in this example, there is a quick way to arrive
at equation (1) without needing to ﬁnd the LCM of the
denominators.
We can move from 4
x = 2
5 to 4 × 5 = 2 × x by what is
called ‘cross-multiplication’.
In general, if a
b = c
d then ad = bc
We can use cross-multiplication when there is one
fraction only on each side of the equation.

There are many practical situations in engineering in
which solving equations is needed. Here are some
worked examples to demonstrate typical practical
situations.

Solving simple equations

Applying the principle of moments
to a beam results in the equation
F × 3 = (7.5 −F) × 2
where F is the force in newtons. Determine the
value of F
Removing brackets gives
3F = 15 −2F
Rearranging gives
3F + 2F = 15
i.e.
5F = 15

Problem 18.
A copper wire has a length L of
1.5km, a resistance R of 5 and a resistivity ρ of
17.2 × 10−6mm. Find the cross-sectional area, a,
of the wire, given that R = ρL
a
Since R = ρL
a then
5 = (17.2 × 10−6mm)(1500 × 103 mm)
a
.
From the units given, a is measured in mm2.
Thus, 5a = 17.2 × 10−6 × 1500 × 103
and
a = 17.2 × 10−6 × 1500 × 103
5
= 17.2 × 1500 × 103
106 × 5
= 17.2 × 15
10 × 5
= 5.16
Hence, the cross-sectional area of the wire is 5.16mm2.
Problem 19.
PV = mRT is the characteristic gas
equation. Find the value of gas constant R when

Dividing both sides of PV = mRT by mT gives

mT = R
Substituting values gives
R =

Problem 20.
A rectangular box with square ends
has its length 15cm greater than its breadth and the
total length of its edges is 2.04m. Find the width of
the box and its volume
Let x cm = width = height of box. Then the length of
the box is (x + 15)cm, as shown in Fig. 11.1.
(x 15)
x
x
Figure 11.1
The length of the edges of the box is 2(4x) + 4(x + 15)
cm, which equals 2.04m or 204cm.
Hence,
204 = 2(4x) + 4(x + 15)
204 = 8x + 4x + 60
204 −60 = 12x
i.e.
144 = 12x
and
x = 12cm
Hence, the width of the box is 12cm.
Volume of box = length × width × height
= (x +15)(x)(x)=(12+15)(12)(12)
= (27)(12)(12)
= 3888cm3
Problem 21.
The temperature coefﬁcient of
resistance α may be calculated from the formula
Rt = R0(1 + αt). Find α, given Rt = 0.928,
R0 = 0.80 and t = 40
Since Rt = R0(1 + αt), then
0.928 = 0.80[1 + α(40)]
0.928 = 0.80 + (0.8)(α)(40)
0.928 −0.80 = 32α
0.128 = 32α

Hence,
α = 0.128
32
= 0.004
Problem 22.
The distance s metres travelled
in time t seconds is given by the formula
s = ut + 1
2at2, where u is the initial velocity in m/s
and a is the acceleration in m/s2. Find the
acceleration of the body if it travels 168m in 6s,
with an initial velocity of 10m/s
s = ut + 1
2at2, and s = 168,u = 10 and t = 6
Hence,
168 = (10)(6) + 1
2a(6)2
168 = 60 + 18a
168 −60 = 18a
108 = 18a
a = 108
18 = 6
Hence, the acceleration of the body is 6 m/s2
Problem 23.

circuit are connected in parallel the total resistance

10 + 1
30 = 6 + 3 + 1
30

30 = 1

Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives RT = 3
Alternatively, if
1
RT
= 1
5 + 1
10 + 1
30, the LCM of the
denominators is 30RT
Hence, 30RT

Cancelling gives
30 = 6RT + 3RT + RT
i.e.
30 = 10RT
and
RT = 30
10 = 3, as above.

Problem 24.
The extension x m of an aluminium
tie bar of length l m and cross-sectional area A m2
when carrying a load of F newtons is given by the
modulus of elasticity E = Fl/Ax. Find the
extension of the tie bar (in mm) if
E = 70 × 109 N/m2, F = 20 × 106 N, A = 0.1m2
and l = 1.4m
E = Fl/Ax, hence
70×109 N
m2 = (20×106N)(1.4m)
(0.1m2)(x)
(the unit of x is thus metres)
70 × 109 × 0.1 × x = 20 × 106 × 1.4
x = 20 × 106 × 1.4
70 × 109 × 0.1
Cancelling gives
x = 2 × 1.4
7 × 100 m
= 2×1.4
7×100 ×1000mm

Problem 26.
A painter is paid £6.30 per hour for a
basic 36 hour week and overtime is paid at one and
a third times this rate. Determine how many hours
the painter has to work in a week to earn £319.20
Basic rate per hour = £6.30 and overtime rate per
hour
= 11
3 × £6.30 = £8.40 Let the
number of overtime hours worked = x
Then,
(36)(6.30) + (x)(8.40) = 319.20
226.80 + 8.40x = 319.20
8.40x = 319.20 −226.80 = 92.40
x = 92.40
8.40 = 11
Thus, 11 hours overtime would have to be worked to
earn £319.20 per week. Hence, the total number of
hours worked is 36 + 11, i.e. 47hours.
Problem 27.
A formula relating initial and ﬁnal
states of pressures, P1 and P2, volumes, V1 and V2,
and absolute temperatures, T1 and T2, of an ideal
gas is P1V1
T1
= P2V2
T2
. Find the value of P2 given
P1 = 100 × 103,V1 = 1.0,V2 = 0.266,T1 = 423
and T2 = 293
Since P1V1
T1
= P2V2
T2
then (100 × 103)(1.0)
423
= P2(0.266)
293
Cross-multiplying gives
(100 × 103)(1.0)(293) = P2(0.266)(423)
P2 = (100 × 103)(1.0)(293)
(0.266)(423)
Hence,
P2 = 260 × 103 or 2.6 × 105

. Calculate the stress, given that
D = 21.5,d = 10.75 and p = 1800
Since D
d =
 f + p
f −p

then 21.5
10.75 =
 f + 1800
f −1800

i.e.
2 =
 f + 1800
f −1800


90
Basic Engineering Mathematics
Squaring both sides gives
4 = f + 1800
f −1800
Cross-multiplying gives
4( f −1800) = f + 1800
4 f −7200 = f + 1800
4 f −f = 1800 + 7200
3 f = 9000
f = 9000
3
= 3000
Hence,
stress, f = 3000
Problem 29.
12 workmen employed on a
building site earn between them a total of £4035 per
week. Labourers are paid £275 per week and
craftsmen are paid £380 per week. How many
craftsmen and how many labourers are employed?
Let the number of craftsmen be c. The number of
labourers is therefore (12 −c).
The wage bill equation is
380c + 275(12−c) = 4035
380c + 3300 −275c = 4035
380c −275c = 4035 −3300
105c = 735
c = 735
105 = 7
Hence, there are 7 craftsmen and (12 −7), i.e. 5
labourers on the site.

Chapter 12
Transposing formulae
Why it is important to understand: Transposing formulae
As was mentioned in the last chapter, formulae are used frequently in almost all aspects of engineering in
order to relate a physical quantity to one or more others. Many well-known physical laws are described
using formulae −for example, Ohm’s law, V = I × R, or Newton’s second law of motion, F = m × a. In
an everyday situation, imagine you buy ﬁve identical items for £20. How much did each item cost? If you
divide £20 by 5 to get an answer of £4, you are actually applying transposition of a formula. Transposing
formulae is a basic skill required in all aspects of engineering. The ability to transpose formulae is yet
another stepping stone on the way to having conﬁdence to handle engineering mathematics.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne ‘subject of the formula’
•
transpose equations whose terms are connected by plus and/or minus signs
•
transpose equations that involve fractions
•
transpose equations that contain a root or power
•
transpose equations in which the subject appears in more than one term
12.1
Introduction
In the formula I = V
R , I is called the subject of the
formula.
Similarly, in the formula y = mx + c, y is the subject of
the formula.
When a symbol other than the subject is required to
be the subject, the formula needs to be rearranged to
make a new subject. This rearranging process is called
transposing the formula or transposition.
For example, in the above formulae,
if I = V
R then V = IR
and if y = mx + c then x = y −c
m
How did we arrive at these transpositions? This is the
purpose of this chapter – to show how to transpose for-
mulae. A great many equations occur in engineering and
it is essential that we can transpose them when needed.
12.2
Transposing formulae
There are no new rules for transposing formulae.
The same rules as were used for simple equations in
Chapter 11 are used; i.e. the balance of an equation
must be maintained: whatever is done to one side of
an equation must be done to the other.
It is best that you cover simple equations before trying
this chapter.
Here are some worked examples to help understanding
of transposing formulae.
Basic Engineering Mathematics. 978-0-415-66278-9, © 2014 John Bird. Published by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

Transposing formulae
95
Problem 1.
Transpose p = q +r + s to make r
the subject
The object is to obtain r on its own on the LHS of the
equation. Changing the equation around so that r is on
the LHS gives
q +r + s = p
(1)
From Chapter 11 on simple equations, a term can be
moved from one side of an equation to the other side as
long as the sign is changed.
Rearranging gives r = p −q −s
Mathematically, we have subtracted q + s from both
sides of equation (1).
Problem 2.
If a + b = w −x + y, express x as
the subject
As stated in Problem 1, a term can be moved from one
side of an equation to the other side but with a change
of sign.
Hence, rearranging gives x = w + y −a −b
Problem 3.
Transpose v = f λ to make λ the
subject
v = f λ relates velocity v, frequency f and wave-
length λ
Rearranging gives
f λ = v
Dividing both sides by f gives
f λ
f
= v
f
Cancelling gives
λ = v
f
Problem 4.
When a body falls freely through a
height h, the velocity v is given by v2 = 2gh.
Express this formula with h as the subject
Rearranging gives
2gh = v2
Dividing both sides by 2g gives
2gh

Chapter 13
Solving simultaneous
equations
Why it is important to understand: Solving simultaneous equations
Simultaneous equations arise a great deal in engineering and science, some applications including theory
of structures, data analysis, electrical circuit analysis and air trafﬁc control. Systems that consist of a small
number of equations can be solved analytically using standard methods from algebra (as explained in this
chapter). Systems of large numbers of equations require the use of numerical methods and computers.
Solving simultaneous equations is an important skill required in all aspects of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
solve simultaneous equations in two unknowns by substitution
•
solve simultaneous equations in two unknowns by elimination
•
solve simultaneous equations involving practical situations
•
solve simultaneous equations in three unknowns
13.1
Introduction
Onlyoneequationisnecessarywhenﬁndingthevalueof
a single unknown quantity (as with simple equations
in Chapter 11). However, when an equation contains
two unknown quantities it has an inﬁnite number of
solutions. When two equations are available connecting
the same two unknown values then a unique solution
is possible. Similarly, for three unknown quantities it is
necessary to have three equations in order to solve for
a particular value of each of the unknown quantities,
and so on.
Equations which have to be solved together to ﬁnd the
unique values of the unknown quantities, which are
true for each of the equations, are called simultaneous
equations.
Two methods of solving simultaneous equations analyt-
ically are:
(a)
by substitution, and
(b)
by elimination.
(A graphical solution of simultaneous equations is
shown in Chapter 19.)
13.2 Solving simultaneous equations
in two unknowns
The method of solving simultaneous equations is
demonstrated in the following worked problems.
Basic Engineering Mathematics. 978-0-415-66278-9, © 2014 John Bird. Published by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

Basic Engineering Mathematics
Problem 1.
Solve the following equations for x
and y, (a) by substitution and (b) by elimination
x + 2y = −1
(1)
4x −3y = 18
(2)
(a)
By substitution
From equation (1): x = −1 −2y
Substituting this expression for x into equation (2)
gives
4(−1 −2y) −3y = 18
This is now a simple equation in y.
Removing the bracket gives
−4 −8y −3y = 18
−11y = 18 + 4 = 22
y = 22
−11 = −2
Substituting y = −2 into equation (1) gives
x + 2(−2) = −1
x −4 = −1
x = −1 + 4 = 3
Thus, x = 3 and y = −2 is the solution to the
simultaneous equations.
Check: in equation (2), since x = 3 and y = −2,
LHS = 4(3) −3(−2) = 12 + 6 = 18 = RHS
(b)
By elimination
x + 2y = −1
(1)
4x −3y = 18
(2)
If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 4, the
coefﬁcient of x will be the same as in equation (2),
giving
4x + 8y = −4
(3)
Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives
4x −3y = 18
(2)
4x + 8y = −4
(3)
0 −11y = 22
Hence,
y = 22
−11 = −2
(Note: in the above subtraction,
18 −−4 = 18 + 4 = 22)
Substituting y = −2 into either equation (1) or equa-
tion (2) will give x = 3 as in method (a). The solution
x = 3, y = −2 is the only pair of values that satisﬁes
both of the original equations.
Problem 2.
Solve, by a substitution method, the
simultaneous equations
3x −2y = 12
(1)
x + 3y = −7
(2)
From equation (2), x = −7 −3y
Substituting for x in equation (1) gives
3(−7 −3y) −2y = 12
i.e.
−21 −9y −2y = 12
−11y = 12 + 21 = 33
Hence, y = 33
−11 = −3
Substituting y = −3 in equation (2) gives
x + 3(−3) = −7
i.e.
x −9 = −7
Hence
x = −7 + 9 = 2
Thus, x = 2, y = −3 is the solution of the simultaneous
equations. (Such solutions should always be checked
by substituting values into each of the original two
equations.)
Problem 3.
Use an elimination method to solve
the following simultaneous equations
3x + 4y = 5
(1)
2x −5y = −12
(2)
If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 2 and equa-
tion (2) by 3, the coefﬁcient of x will be the same in the
newly formed equations. Thus,
2 × equation (1) gives
6x + 8y = 10
(3)
3 × equation (2) gives
6x −15y = −36
(4)
Equation (3) – equation (4) gives
0 + 23y = 46
i.e.

(Note +8y −−15y = 8y + 15y = 23y and 10−−36 =
10 + 36 = 46)

Solving simultaneous equations
105
Substituting y = 2 in equation (1) gives
3x + 4(2) = 5
from which
3x = 5 −8 = −3
and
x = −1
Checking,by substituting x = −1 and y = 2 in equation
(2), gives
LHS = 2(−1) −5(2) = −2 −10 = −12 = RHS
Hence, x = −1 and y = 2 is the solution of the simul-
taneous equations.
The elimination method is the most common method of
solving simultaneous equations.
Problem 4.
Solve
7x −2y = 26
(1)
6x + 5y = 29
(2)
When equation (1) is multiplied by 5 and equation (2)
by 2, the coefﬁcients of y in each equation are numeri-
cally the same, i.e. 10, but are of opposite sign.
5 × equation (1) gives
35x −10y = 130
(3)
2 × equation (2) gives
12x + 10y = 58
(4)
Adding equations (3)
and (4) gives
47x + 0 = 188
Hence,
x = 188
47 = 4
Note that when the signs of common coefﬁcients aredif-
ferent the two equations are added and when the signs
of common coefﬁcients are the same the two equations
are subtracted (as in Problems 1 and 3).
Substituting x = 4 in equation (1) gives
7(4) −2y = 26
28 −2y = 26
28 −26 = 2y
2 = 2y
Hence,
y = 1
Checking, by substituting x = 4 and y = 1 in equation
(2), gives
LHS = 6(4) + 5(1) = 24 + 5 = 29 = RHS
Thus, the solution is x = 4, y = 1

and equation (2) becomes
a −4b = −2
(4)
Multiplying equation (4) by 2 gives
2a −8b = −4
(5)
Subtracting equation (5) from equation (3) gives
0 + 11b = 11
i.e.
b = 1
Substituting b = 1 in equation (3) gives
2a + 3 = 7
2a = 7 −3 = 4
i.e.
a = 2
Checking, substituting a = 2 and b = 1 in equation (4),

Similarly, in equation (2) 33 = 4(2x −y)
i.e.
33 = 8x −4y
(4)
Equation (3)+equation (4) gives
60 = 12x and x = 60
12 = 5
Substituting x = 5 in equation (3) gives
27 = 4(5) + 4y
from which
4y = 27 −20 = 7
and
y = 7

13.5 Practical problems involving
simultaneous equations
There are a number of situations in engineering and
science in which the solution of simultaneous equations
is required. Some are demonstrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 12.
The law connecting friction F and
load L for an experiment is of the form F = aL + b
where a and b are constants. When F = 5.6N,
L = 8.0N and when F = 4.4N, L = 2.0N. Find the
values of a and b and the value of F when
L = 6.5N
Substituting F = 5.6 and L = 8.0 into F = aL + b
gives
5.6 = 8.0a + b
(1)
Substituting F = 4.4 and L = 2.0 into F = aL + b
gives
4.4 = 2.0a + b

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives
1.2 = 6.0a
a = 1.2
6.0 = 1

gives
RHS = 2.0
1


+ 4 = 0.4 + 4 = 4.4 = LHS
Hence, a = 1
5 and b = 4
When L = 6.5, F = aL + b = 1
5(6.5) + 4 = 1.3 + 4,
i.e. F = 5.30N.
Problem 13.
The equation of a straight line,
of gradient m and intercept on the y-axis c, is
y = mx + c. If a straight line passes through the
point where x = 1 and y = −2, and also through
the point where x = 3.5 and y = 10.5, ﬁnd the
values of the gradient and the y-axis intercept
Substituting x = 1 and y = −2 into y = mx + c gives
−2 = m + c
(1)
Substituting x = 3.5 and y = 10.5 into y = mx + c
gives
10.5 = 3.5m + c
(2)
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives
12.5 = 2.5m,
from which, m = 12.5
2.5 = 5
Substituting m = 5 into equation (1) gives
−2 = 5 + c
c = −2 −5 = −7
Checking, substituting m = 5 and c = −7 in equation
(2), gives
RHS = (3.5)(5) + (−7) = 17.5 −7 = 10.5 = LHS
Hence, the gradient m = 5 and the y-axis intercept
c = −7

Solving simultaneous equations

Removing the brackets from equation (1) gives
27 = 1.5I1 + 8I1 −8I2
Rearranging gives
9.5I1 −8I2 = 27
(3)
Removing the brackets from equation (2) gives
−26 = 2I2 −8I1 + 8I2
Rearranging gives
−8I1 + 10I2 = −26
(4)
Multiplying equation (3) by 5 gives
47.5I1 −40I2 = 135
(5)
Multiplying equation (4) by 4 gives
−32I1 + 40I2 = −104
(6)
Adding equations (5) and (6) gives
15.5I1 + 0 = 31
I1 = 31
15.5 = 2
Substituting I1 = 2 into equation (3) gives
9.5(2) −8I1 = 27
19 −8I2 = 27
19 −27 = 8I2
−8 = 8I2
and
I2 = −1
Hence, the solution is I1 = 2 and I2 = −1 (which may
be checked in the original equations).
Problem 15.
The distance s metres from a ﬁxed
point of a vehicle travelling in a straight line with
constant acceleration, a m/s2, is given by
s = ut + 1
2at2, where u is the initial velocity in m/s
and t the time in seconds. Determine the initial
velocity and the acceleration given that s = 42m
when t = 2s, and s = 144m when t = 4s. Also ﬁnd
the distance travelled after 3s
Substituting s = 42 and t = 2 into s = ut + 1
2at2 gives
42 = 2u + 1
2a(2)2
i.e.
42 = 2u + 2a
(1)
Substituting s = 144 and t = 4 into s = ut + 1
2at2
gives
144 = 4u + 1
2a(4)2
i.e.
144 = 4u + 8a
(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by 2 gives
84 = 4u + 4a
(3)
Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives
60 = 0 + 4a
and
a = 60
4 = 15
Substituting a = 15 into equation (1) gives
42 = 2u + 2(15)
42 −30 = 2u
u = 12
2 = 6
Substituting a = 15 and u = 6 in equation (2) gives
RHS = 4(6) + 8(15) = 24 + 120 = 144 = LHS
Hence, the initial velocity u = 6m/s and the acceler-
ation a = 15m/s2.
Distance travelled after 3s is given by s = ut + 1
2at2
where t = 3,u = 6 and a = 15
Hence, s = (6)(3) + 1
2(15)(3)2 = 18 + 67.5
i.e. distance travelled after 3 s = 85.5 m.
Problem 16.
The resistance R  of a length of
wire at t◦C is given by R = R0(1 + αt), where R0
is the resistance at 0◦C and α is the temperature
coefﬁcient of resistance in /◦C. Find the values of α
and R0 if R = 30 at 50◦C and R = 35 at 100◦C
Substituting R = 30 and t = 50 into R = R0(1 + αt)
gives
30 = R0(1 + 50α)
(1)
Substituting R = 35 and t = 100 into R = R0(1 + αt)
gives
35 = R0(1 + 100α)
(2)
Although these equations may be solved by the conven-
tional substitution method, an easier way is to eliminate

112
Basic Engineering Mathematics
R0 by division. Thus, dividing equation (1) by equation
(2) gives
30
35 = R0(1 + 50α)
R0(1 + 100α) = 1 + 50α
1 + 100α
Cross-multiplying gives
30(1 + 100α) = 35(1 + 50α)
30 + 3000α = 35 + 1750α
3000α −1750α = 35 −30
1250α = 5
i.e.

Problem 17.
The molar heat capacity of a solid
compound is given by the equation c = a + bT,
where a and b are constants. When c = 52,T = 100
and when c = 172,T = 400. Determine the values
of a and b
When c = 52,
T = 100, hence
52 = a + 100b
(1)
When c = 172,
T = 400, hence
172 = a + 400b
(2)
Equation (2) – equation (1) gives
120 = 300b
from which,
b = 120
300 = 0.4
Substituting b = 0.4 in equation (1) gives
52 = a + 100(0.4)
a = 52 −40 = 12
Hence, a = 12 and b = 0.4

13.6 Solving simultaneous equations
in three unknowns
Equations containing three unknowns may be solved
using exactly the same procedures as those used with
two equations and two unknowns, providing that there
are three equations to work with. The method is demon-
strated in the following worked problem.
Problem 18.
Solve the simultaneous equations.
x + y + z = 4
(1)
2x −3y + 4z = 33
(2)
3x −2y −2z = 2
(3)
There are a number of ways of solving these equations.
One method is shown below.
The initial object is to produce two equations with two
unknowns. For example, multiplying equation (1) by 4
and then subtracting this new equation fromequation (2)
will produce an equation with only x and y involved.
Multiplying equation (1) by 4 gives
4x + 4y + 4z = 16
(4)
Equation (2) – equation (4) gives
−2x −7y = 17
(5)
Similarly, multiplying equation (3) by 2 and then
adding this new equation to equation (2) will produce
another equation with only x and y involved.
Multiplying equation (3) by 2 gives
6x −4y −4z = 4
(6)
Equation (2)+equation (6) gives
8x −7y = 37
(7)
Rewriting equation (5) gives
−2x −7y = 17
(5)
Now we can use the previous method for solving
simultaneous equations in two unknowns.
Equation (7) – equation (5) gives
10x = 20
from which,
x = 2
(Note that 8x −−2x = 8x + 2x = 10x)
Substituting x = 2 into equation (5) gives
−4 −7y = 17
from which,
−7y = 17 + 4 = 21
and
y = −3
Substituting x = 2 and y = −3 into equation (1) gives
2 −3 + z = 4
from which,
z = 5
Hence, the solution of the simultaneous equations is
x = 2, y = −3 and z = 5

Chapter 14
Solving quadratic equations
Why it is important to understand: Solving quadratic equations
Quadratic equations have many applications in engineering and science; they are used in describing
the trajectory of a ball, determining the height of a throw, and in the concept of acceleration, velocity,
ballistics and stopping power. In addition, the quadratic equation has been found to be widely evident
in a number of natural processes; some of these include the processes by which light is reﬂected off a
lens, water ﬂows down a rocky stream, or even the manner in which fur, spots, or stripes develop on wild
animals. When trafﬁc policemen arrive at the scene of a road accident, they measure the length of the
skid marks and assess the road conditions. They can then use a quadratic equation to calculate the speed
of the vehicles and hence reconstruct exactly what happened. The U-shape of a parabola can describe
the trajectories of water jets in a fountain and a bouncing ball, or be incorporated into structures like
the parabolic reﬂectors that form the base of satellite dishes and car headlights. Quadratic functions
can help plot the course of moving objects and assist in determining minimum and maximum values.
Most of the objects we use every day, from cars to clocks, would not exist if someone somewhere hadn’t
applied quadratic functions to their design. Solving quadratic equations is an important skill required in
all aspects of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a quadratic equation
•
solve quadratic equations by factorisation
•
solve quadratic equations by ‘completing the square’
•
solve quadratic equations involving practical situations
•
solve linear and quadratic equations simultaneously
14.1
Introduction
As stated in Chapter 11, an equation is a statement
that two quantities are equal and to ‘solve an equation’
means ‘to ﬁnd the value of the unknown’. The value of
the unknown is called the root of the equation.
A quadratic equation is one in which the highest
power of the unknown quantity is 2. For example,
x2 −3x + 1 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
There are four methods of solving quadratic equa-
tions. These are:
(a)
by factorisation (where possible),
(b)
by ‘completing the square’,
(c)
by using the ‘quadratic formula’, or
(d)
graphically (see Chapter 19).

14.2 Solution of quadratic equations
by factorisation
Multiplying out (x + 1)(x −3) gives x2 −3x + x −3
i.e. x2 −2x −3. The reverse process of moving from
x2 −2x −3 to (x + 1)(x −3) is called factorising.
If the quadratic expression can be factorised this pro-
vides the simplest method of solving a quadratic
equation.
For example, if x2 −2x −3 = 0, then, by factorising
(x + 1)(x −3) = 0
Hence, either
(x + 1) = 0, i.e.
x = −1
or
(x −3) = 0, i.e. x = 3
Hence, x = −1 and x = 3 are the roots of the quad-
ratic equation x2 −2x −3 = 0
The technique of factorising is often one of trial and
error.
Problem 1.
Solve the equation x2 + x −6 = 0 by
factorisation
The factors of x2 are x and x. These are placed in
brackets:
(x
)(x
)
The factors of −6 are +6 and −1, or −6 and +1, or +3
and −2, or −3 and +2
The only combination to give a middle term of +x is
+3 and −2,
i.e.
x2 + x −6 = (x + 3)(x −2)
The quadratic equation x2 + x −6 = 0 thus becomes
(x + 3)(x −2) = 0
Since the only way that this can be true is for either the
ﬁrst or the second or both factors to be zero, then
either
(x + 3) = 0, i.e. x = −3
or
(x −2) = 0, i.e. x = 2
Hence, the roots of x2 + x −6 = 0 are x = −3 and
x = 2
Problem 2.
Solve the equation x2 + 2x −8 = 0
by factorisation
The factors of x2 are x and x. These are placed in
brackets:
(x
)(x
)
The factors of −8 are +8 and −1, or −8 and +1, or +4
and −2, or −4 and +2
The only combination to give a middle term of +2x is
+4 and −2,
i.e.
x2 + 2x −8 = (x + 4)(x −2)
(Note that the product of the two inner terms (4x) added
to the product of the two outer terms (−2x) must equal
the middle term, +2x in this case.)
The quadratic equation x2 + 2x −8 = 0 thus becomes
(x + 4)(x −2) = 0
Since the only way that this can be true is for either the
ﬁrst or the second or both factors to be zero,
either
(x + 4) = 0, i.e. x = −4
or
(x −2) = 0, i.e. x = 2
Hence, the roots of x2 + 2x −8 = 0 are x = −4 and
x = 2
Problem 3.
Determine the roots of
x2 −6x + 9 = 0 by factorisation
x2 −6x + 9 = (x −3)(x −3),
i.e. (x −3)2 = 0
The LHS is known as a perfect square.
Hence, x = 3 is the only root of the equation
x2 −6x + 9 = 0
Problem 4.
Solve the equation x2 −4x = 0
Factorising gives
x(x −4) = 0
If
x(x −4) = 0,
either
x = 0
or x −4 = 0
i.e.
x = 0
or
x = 4
These are the two roots of the given equation. Answers
can always be checked by substitution into the original
equation.
Problem 5.
Solve the equation x2 + 3x −4 = 0
Factorising gives
(x −1)(x + 4) = 0
Hence, either
x −1 = 0 or x + 4 = 0
i.e.
x = 1 or
x = −4
Problem 6.
Determine the roots of 4x2 −25 = 0
by factorisation

118
Basic Engineering Mathematics
The LHS of 4x2 −25 = 0 is the difference of two
squares, (2x)2 and (5)2
Byfactorising,4x2 −25 = (2x + 5)(2x −5),i.e.(2x +
5)(2x −5) = 0
Hence, either
(2x + 5) = 0,
i.e.
x = −5
2 = −2.5
or
(2x −5) = 0,
i.e.
x = 5
2 = 2.5
Problem 7.
Solve the equation x2 −5x + 6 = 0
Factorising gives
(x −3)(x −2) = 0
Hence, either
x −3 = 0 or x −2 = 0
i.e.
x = 3
or
x = 2
Problem 8.
Solve the equation x2 = 15 −2x
Rearranging gives
x2 + 2x −15 = 0
Factorising gives
(x + 5)(x −3) = 0
Hence, either
x + 5 = 0 or x −3 = 0
i.e.
x = −5 or
x = 3
Problem 9.
Solve the equation 3x2 −11x −4 = 0
by factorisation
The factors of 3x2 are 3x and x. These are placed in
brackets:
(3x
)(x
)
The factors of −4 are −4 and +1, or +4 and −1, or −2
and 2.
Remembering that the product of the two inner terms
added to the product of the two outer terms must equal
−11x, the only combination to give this is +1 and −4,
i.e.
3x2−11x −4 = (3x + 1)(x −4)
The
quadratic
equation
3x2 −11x −4 = 0
thus
becomes
(3x + 1)(x −4) = 0
Hence, either (3x + 1) = 0,
i.e.
x = −1
3
or
(x −4) = 0,
i.e.
x =
4
and both solutions may be checked in the original
equation.
Problem 10.
Solve the quadratic equation
4x2 + 8x + 3 = 0 by factorising
The factors of 4x2 are 4x and x, or 2x and 2x
The factors of 3 are 3 and 1, or −3 and −1
Remembering that the product of the inner terms added
to the product of the two outer terms must equal +8x,
the only combination that is true (by trial and error) is
(4x2 + 8x + 3) = (2x + 3)(2x + 1)
Hence,
(2x + 3)(2x + 1) = 0,
from
which
either
(2x + 3) = 0 or (2x + 1) = 0
Thus,
2x = −3, from which
x = −3
2
or −1.5
or
2x = −1, from which
x = −1
2
or −0.5
which may be checked in the original equation.
Problem 11.
Solve the quadratic equation
15x2 + 2x −8 = 0 by factorising
The factors of 15x2 are 15x and x or 5x and 3x
The factors of −8 are −4 are +2, or 4 and −2, or −8
and +1, or 8 and −1
By trial and error the only combination that works is
15x2 + 2x −8 = (5x + 4)(3x −2)
Hence,
(5x + 4)(3x −2) = 0,
from
which
either
5x + 4 = 0 or 3x −2 = 0
Hence, x = −4
5
or
x = 2

14.3 Solution of quadratic equations
by ‘completing the square’
An expression such as x2 or (x + 2)2 or (x −3)2 is
called a perfect square.
If x2 = 3 then x = ±
√
3
If (x + 2)2 = 5 then x + 2 = ±
√
5 and x = −2 ±
√

If (x −3)2 = 8 then x −3 = ±
√
8 and x = 3 ±
√
8
Hence, if a quadratic equation can be rearranged so that
one side of the equation is a perfect square and the other
side of the equation is a number, then the solution of
the equation is readily obtained by taking the square
roots of each side as in the above examples. The process
of rearranging one side of a quadratic equation into a
perfect square before solving is called ‘completing the
square’.
(x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2
Thus,inordertomakethequadraticexpressionx2+ 2ax
into a perfect square, it is necessary to add (half the
coefﬁcient of x)2, i.e.

The method of completing the square is demonstrated
in the following worked problems.
Problem 15.
Solve 2x2 + 5x = 3 by completing
the square
The procedure is as follows.
(i)
Rearrange the equation so that all terms are on the
same side of the equals sign (and the coefﬁcient
of the x2 term is positive). Hence,
2x2 + 5x −3 = 0

120
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(ii)
Make the coefﬁcient of the x2 term unity. In this
case this is achieved by dividing throughoutby 2.
Hence,
2x2
2 + 5x
2 −3
2 = 0
i.e.
x2 + 5
2x −3
2 = 0
(iii)
Rearrange the equations so that the x2 and x
terms are on one side of the equals sign and the
constant is on the other side. Hence,
x2 + 5
2x = 3
2
(iv)
Add to both sides of the equation (half the coefﬁ-

14.5 Practical problems involving
quadratic equations
There are many practical problems in which a
quadratic equation has ﬁrst to be obtained, from given
information, before it is solved.
Problem 22.
The area of a rectangle is 23.6cm2
and its width is 3.10cm shorter than its length.
Determine the dimensions of the rectangle, correct
to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
Let the length of the rectangle be x cm. Then the width
is (x −3.10)cm.
Area = length × width = x(x −3.10) = 23.6
i.e.
x2 −3.10x −23.6 = 0
Using the quadratic formula,
x = −(−3.10) ±

(−3.10)2 −4(1)(−23.6)
2(1)
= 3.10 ± √9.61 + 94.4
2
= 3.10 ± 10.20
2
= 13.30
2
or −7.10
2
Hence, x = 6.65cm or −3.55cm. The latter solution is
neglected since length cannot be negative.
Thus, length x = 6.65cm and width = x −3.10 =
6.65 −3.10 = 3.55cm, i.e. the dimensions of the rect-
angle are 6.65cm by 3.55cm.
(Check: Area = 6.65 × 3.55 = 23.6cm2, correct to
3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.)

Problem 23.
Calculate the diameter of a solid
cylinder which has a height of 82.0cm and a total
surface area of 2.0m2
Total surface area of a cylinder
= curved surface area + 2 circular ends
= 2πrh + 2πr2 (where r = radius and h = height)
Since the total surface area = 2.0m2 and the height
h = 82cm or 0.82m,
2.0 = 2πr(0.82) + 2πr2
i.e.
2πr2 + 2πr(0.82) −2.0 = 0
Dividing throughout by 2π gives r2 +0.82r −1
π = 0
Using the quadratic formula,
r =

Thus, the radius r of the cylinder is 0.2874m (the
negative solution being neglected).
Hence, the diameter of the cylinder
= 2 × 0.2874
= 0.5748m or 57.5cm
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Problem 24.

projected vertically upwards at time t seconds is
s = ut −1
2gt2. Determine how long the mass will
take after being projected to reach a height of 16m
(a) on the ascent and (b) on the descent, when
u = 30m/s and g = 9.81m/s2
When height s = 16m,
16 = 30t −1
2(9.81)t2
i.e.
4.905t2 −30t + 16 = 0
Using the quadratic formula,
t = −(−30) ±

(−30)2 −4(4.905)(16)

√
586.1
9.81

Hence, the mass will reach a height of 16m after
0.59s on the ascent and after 5.53s on the descent.
Problem 25.

A concrete path of constant width is laid all the way

determine its base diameter.
From Chapter 27, page 278, the total surface area A of
a solid cone is given by A = πrl + πr2, where l is the
slant height and r the base radius.
If A = 482.2 and l = 15.3, then
482.2 = πr(15.3) + πr2

Basic Engineering Mathematics
i.e.
πr2 + 15.3πr −482.2 = 0

meaningless and is thus ignored).
Thus, the diameter of the base = 2r = 2(6.9106)
= 13.82cm.

Logarithms
Why it is important to understand: Logarithms
All types of engineers use natural and common logarithms. Chemical engineers use them to measure
radioactive decay and pH solutions, both of which are measured on a logarithmic scale. The Richter scale
which measures earthquake intensity is a logarithmic scale. Biomedical engineers use logarithms to mea-
sure cell decay and growth, and also to measure light intensity for bone mineral density measurements. In
electrical engineering, a dB (decibel) scale is very useful for expressing attenuations in radio propagation
and circuit gains, and logarithms are used for implementing arithmetic operations in digital circuits.
Logarithms are especially useful when dealing with the graphical analysis of non-linear relationships
and logarithmic scales are used to linearise data to make data analysis simpler. Understanding and using
logarithms is clearly important in all branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne base, power, exponent and index
•
deﬁne a logarithm
•
distinguish between common and Napierian (i.e. hyperbolic or natural) logarithms
•
evaluate logarithms to any base
•
state the laws of logarithms
•
simplify logarithmic expressions
•
solve equations involving logarithms
•
solve indicial equations
•
sketch graphs of log10 x and loge x

Introduction to logarithms
With the use of calculators ﬁrmly established, logarith-
mic tables are now rarely used for calculation. However,
the theory of logarithms is important, for there are sev-
eral scientiﬁc and engineering laws that involve the rules
of logarithms.
From Chapter 7, we know that
16 = 24
The number 4 is called the power or the exponent or
the index. In the expression 24, the number 2 is called
the base.
In another example, we know that
64 = 82
In this example, 2 is the power, or exponent, or index.
The number 8 is the base.
15.1.1
What is a logarithm?
Consider the expression 16 = 24
An alternative, yet equivalent, way of writing this
expression is log2 16 = 4
Basic Engineering Mathematics. 978-0-415-66278-9, © 2014 John Bird. Published by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

Logarithms
127
This is stated as ‘log to the base 2 of 16 equals 4’
We see that the logarithm is the same as the power
or index in the original expression. It is the base in
the original expression that becomes the base of the
logarithm.
The two statements 16 = 24 and
log216 = 4 are equivalent
If we write either of them, we are automatically imply-
ing the other.
In general, if a number y can be written in the form ax,
then the index x is called the ‘logarithm of y to the base
of a’, i.e.
if y = ax then x = loga y
In another example, if we write down that 64 = 82 then
theequivalentstatementusing logarithmsislog8 64 = 2.
In another example, if we write down that log3 27 = 3
then the equivalent statement using powers is 33 = 27.
So the two sets of statements, one involving powers and
one involving logarithms, are equivalent.
15.1.2
Common logarithms
From the above, if we write down that 1000 = 103, then
3 = log10 1000. This may be checked using the ‘log’
button on your calculator.
Logarithms having a base of 10 are called common
logarithms and log10 is usually abbreviated to lg. The
following values may be checked using a calculator.
lg27.5 = 1.4393...
lg378.1 = 2.5776...
lg0.0204 = −1.6903...
15.1.3
Napierian logarithms
Logarithms having a base of e (where e is a mathemat-
ical constant approximately equal to 2.7183) are called
hyperbolic, Napierian or natural logarithms, and
loge is usually abbreviated to ln. The following values
may be checked using a calculator.
ln3.65 = 1.2947...
ln417.3 = 6.0338...
ln0.182 = −1.7037...
Napierian logarithms are explained further in Chapter
16, following.
Here are some worked problems to help understanding
of logarithms.
Problem 1.
Evaluate log3 9
Let x = log3 9
then 3x = 9 from the deﬁnition of
a logarithm,
i.e.
3x = 32, from which x = 2
Hence,
log3 9= 2
Problem 2.
Evaluate log10 10
Let x = log10 10 then 10x = 10 from the deﬁnition
of a logarithm,
i.e.
10x = 101, from which x = 1
Hence,
log1010 = 1 (which may be checked
using a calculator).
Problem 3.
Evaluate log168
Let x = log16 8
then 16x = 8 from the deﬁnition
of a logarithm,
i.e. (24)x = 23
i.e. 24x = 23 from the laws
of indices,
from which,
4x = 3 and x = 3

Hence,

Laws of logarithms
There are three laws of logarithms, which apply to any
base:
(1) To multiply two numbers:
log(A × B) = logA + logB
The following may be checked by using a calculator.
lg 10 = 1
Also,
lg 5 + lg 2 = 0.69897...+ 0.301029... = 1
Hence, lg(5 × 2) = lg 10 = lg 5 + lg 2
(2) To divide two numbers:
log
A
B

= logA −logB
The following may be checked using a calculator.


= ln2.5 = 0.91629...

= 0.91629...
Hence,
ln
5


= ln5 −ln2
(3) To raise a number to a power:
logAn = nlogA
The following may be checked using a calculator.
lg52 = lg25 = 1.39794...
Also,
2lg5 = 2 × 0.69897... = 1.39794...
Hence,
lg52 = 2lg5

The laws of logarithms may be used to solve
certain equations involving powers, called indicial
equations.
For example, to solve, say, 3x = 27, logarithms to a base
of 10 are taken of both sides,
i.e.
log10 3x = log10 27

Let loga = x then ax = 1 from the deﬁnition of the

If ax = 1 then x = 0 from the laws of logarithms.

Let loga 0 = x then ax = 0 from the deﬁnition of a

Chapter 16
Exponential functions
Why it is important to understand: Exponential functions
Exponential functions are used in engineering, physics, biology and economics. There are many quantities
that grow exponentially; some examples are population, compound interest and charge in a capacitor.
With exponential growth, the rate of growth increases as time increases. We also have exponential decay;
some examples are radioactive decay, atmospheric pressure,Newton’s law ofcoolingand linearexpansion.
Understanding and using exponential functions is important in many branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
evaluate exponential functions using a calculator
•
state the exponential series for ex
•
plot graphs of exponential functions
•
evaluate Napierian logarithms using a calculator
•
solve equations involving Napierian logarithms
•
appreciate the many examples of laws of growth and decay in engineering and science
•
perform calculations involving the laws of growth and decay
16.1 Introduction to exponential
functions
An exponential function is one which contains ex, e
being a constant called the exponent and having an
approximate value of 2.7183. The exponent arises from
the natural laws of growth and decay and is used as a
base for natural or Napierian logarithms.
The most common method of evaluating an exponential
function is by using a scientiﬁc notation calculator.Use
your calculator to check the following values.
e1 = 2.7182818, correct to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
e−1.618 = 0.1982949, correct to 7 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
e0.12 = 1.1275, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
e−1.47 = 0.22993, correct to 5 decimal places,
e−0.431 = 0.6499, correct to 4 decimal places,
e9.32 = 11159, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
e−2.785 = 0.0617291, correct to 7 decimal places.
Problem 1.
Evaluate the following correct to 4
decimal places, using a calculator:
0.0256(e5.21 −e2.49)
0.0256(e5.21 −e2.49)

= 4.3784, correct to 4 decimal places.

The power series for ex
The value of ex can be calculated to any required degree
of accuracy since it is deﬁned in terms of the following
power series:
ex = 1 + x+ x 2
2! + x 3
3! + x 4
4! + ···
(1)
(where 3!= 3 × 2 × 1 and is called ‘factorial 3’).
The series is valid for all values of x.
The series is said to converge; i.e. if all the terms are
added, an actual value for ex (where x is a real number)
is obtained. The more terms that are taken, the closer
will be the value of ex to its actual value. The value of
the exponent e, correct to say 4 decimal places, may be
determined by substituting x = 1 in the power series of
equation (1). Thus,
e1 = 1 + 1 + (1)2
2! + (1)3
3! + (1)4
4! + (1)5
5! + (1)6
6!
+ (1)7
7! + (1)8
8! + ···
= 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.16667 + 0.04167 + 0.00833
+ 0.00139 + 0.00020+ 0.00002 + ···
= 2.71828
i.e.
e = 2.7183, correct to 4 decimal places.

The value of e0.05, correct to say 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, is
found by substituting x = 0.05 in the power series for
ex. Thus,
e0.05 = 1 + 0.05 + (0.05)2
2!
+ (0.05)3
3!
+ (0.05)4
4!
+ (0.05)5

= 1 + 0.05 + 0.00125 + 0.000020833
+ 0.000000260+ 0.0000000026
i.e. e 0.05 = 1.0512711, correct to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
In this example, successive terms in the series grow
smaller very rapidly and it is relatively easy to deter-
mine the value of e0.05 to a high degree of accuracy.
However, when x is nearer to unity or larger than unity,
a very large number of terms are required for an accurate
result.
If, in the series of equation (1), x is replaced by −x,
then
e−x = 1 + (−x) + (−x)2
2!
+ (−x)3
3!
+ ···
i.e.
e−x = 1 −x + x 2
2! −x 3
3! + ···
In a similar manner the power series for ex may
be used to evaluate any exponential function of the form
aekx, where a and k are constants.

Napierian logarithms
Logarithms having a base of e are called hyperbolic,
Napierian or natural logarithms and the Napierian
logarithm of x is written as loge x or, more commonly,
as ln x. Logarithms were invented by John Napier∗, a
Scotsman.
The most common method of evaluating a Napierian
logarithmisby ascientiﬁcnotation calculator.Useyour
calculator to check the following values:
ln 4.328 = 1.46510554... = 1.4651, correct to 4
decimal places
∗Who was Napier? – John Napier of Merchiston (1550–4
April 1617) is best known as the discoverer of logarithms. The
inventor of the so-called ‘Napier’s bones’, Napier also made
common the use of the decimal point in arithmetic and mathe-
matics. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
ln 1.812 = 0.59443, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
ln 1 = 0
ln 527 = 6.2672, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
ln 0.17 = −1.772, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
ln 0.00042 = −7.77526, correct to 6 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures
ln e3 = 3
ln e1 = 1
From the last two examples we can conclude that
loge ex = x
This is useful when solving equations involving expo-
nential functions. For example, to solve e3x = 7, take
Napierian logarithms of both sides, which gives
ln e3x = ln7
i.e.
3x = ln7

Chapter 17
Straight line graphs
Why it is important to understand: Straight line graphs
Graphs have a wide range of applications in engineering and in physical sciences because of their inherent
simplicity. A graph can be used to represent almost any physical situation involving discrete objects and
the relationship among them. If two quantities are directly proportional and one is plotted against the
other, a straight line is produced. Examples include an applied force on the end of a spring plotted against
spring extension, the speed of a ﬂywheel plotted against time, and strain in a wire plotted against stress
(Hooke’s law). In engineering, the straight line graph is the most basic graph to draw and evaluate.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand rectangular axes, scales and co-ordinates
•
plot given co-ordinates and draw the best straight line graph
•
determine the gradient of a straight line graph
•
estimate the vertical axis intercept
•
state the equation of a straight line graph
•
plot straight line graphs involving practical engineering examples
17.1
Introduction to graphs
A graph is a visual representation of information,
showing how one quantity varies with another related
quantity.
We often see graphs in newspapers or in business
reports, in travel brochures and government publica-
tions. For example, a graph of the share price (in pence)
over a 6 month period for a drinks company,Fizzy Pops,
is shown in Fig. 17.1.
Generally, we see that the share price increases to a high
of400p in June,butdipsdown to around 280p in August
before recovering slightly in September.
A graph should convey information more quickly to the
reader than if the same information was explained in
words.
When this chapter is completed you should be able to
draw up a table of values, plot co-ordinates, determine
the gradient and state the equation of a straight line
graph. Some typical practical examples are included in
which straight lines are used.
17.2
Axes, scales and co-ordinates
We are probably all familiar with reading a map to locate
a town, or a local map to locate a particular street. For
example, a street map of central Portsmouth is shown
in Fig. 17.2. Notice the squares drawn horizontally and
vertically on the map; this is called a grid and enables
us to locate a place of interest or a particular road. Most
maps contain such a grid.
We locate places of interest on the map by stating a letter
and a number – this is called the grid reference.

For example, on the map, the Portsmouth & Southsea
station is in square D2, King’s Theatre is in square E5,
HMS Warrior is in square A2, Gunwharf Quays is in
square B3 and High Street is in square B4.
Portsmouth & Southsea station is located by moving
horizontally along the bottom of the map until the
square labelled D is reached and then moving vertically
upwards until square 2 is met.
The letter/number, D2, is referred to as co-ordinates;
i.e. co-ordinates are used to locate the position of
a point on a map. If you are familiar with using a
map in this way then you should have no difﬁculties

with graphs, because similar co-ordinates are used with
graphs.
As stated earlier, a graph is a visual representation
of information, showing how one quantity varies with
another related quantity. The most common method of
showing a relationship between two sets of data is to
use a pair of reference axes – these are two lines drawn
at right angles to each other (often called Cartesian,
named after Descartes∗, or rectangularaxes), as shown
in Fig. 17.3.
The horizontalaxis is labelled the x-axis and the vertical
axis is labelled the y-axis. The point where x is 0 and y
is 0 is called the origin.
x values have scales that are positive to the right of the
origin and negative to the left. y values have scales that
are positive up from the origin and negative down from
the origin.
Co-ordinates are written with brackets and a comma in
between two numbers. For example, point A is shown
with co-ordinates (3, 2) and is located by starting at the
∗Who was Descartes? – René Descartes (31 March 1596–11
February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and
writer. He wrote many inﬂuential texts including Meditations
on First Philosophy. Descartes is best known for the philosoph-
ical statement ‘Cogito ergo sum’ (I think, therefore I am), found
in part IV of Discourse on the Method. To ﬁnd out more go to

When co-ordinates are stated the ﬁrst number is always
the x value and the second numberis always the y value.
In Fig. 17.3, point B has co-ordinates (−4,3) and point
C has co-ordinates (−3,−2).

The distances travelled by a car in certain periods of
time are shown in the following table of values.

Distance travelled (m) 50 100 150 200 250 300
We will plot time on the horizontal (or x) axis with a
scale of 1cm = 10s.
We will plot distance on the vertical (or y) axis with a
scale of 1cm = 50m.
(When choosingscales it is better to choose ones such as
1cm = 1unit,1cm = 2units or 1cm = 10units because
doing so makes reading values between these values
easier.)
With the above data, the (x, y) co-ordinates become
(time, distance) co-ordinates; i.e. the co-ordinates are
(10, 50), (20, 100), (30, 150), and so on.
The co-ordinates are shown plotted in Fig. 17.4 using
crosses. (Alternatively, a dot or a dot and circle may be
used, as shown in Fig. 17.3.)
A straight line is drawn through the plotted co-ordinates
as shown in Fig. 17.4.

Scales are normally chosen such that the graph
occupies as much space as possible on the
graph paper. So in this case, the following
scales are chosen.
Horizontal axis (i.e. L): 1cm = 50N
Vertical axis (i.e. F): 1cm = 10N

Draw the axes and label them L (newtons) for
the horizontal axis and F (newtons) for the

(120, 35), (230, 50), (410, 93), (540, 125) and
(680, 147), marking each with a cross or a dot.

Using aruler,drawthebeststraightlinethrough

normal with experimental values. In a practi-

Extend the straight line at each end.

From the graph, determine the force applied
when the load is 325N. It should be close
to 75N. This process of ﬁnding an equivalent
value within the given data is called interpola-
tion. Similarly, determine the load that a force
of 45N will overcome. It should be close to
170N.
11.
From the graph, determine the force needed to
overcome a 750N load. It should be close to
161N. This process of ﬁnding an equivalent
value outside the given data is called extrapo-
lation. Toextrapolateweneedtohaveextended

force applied when the load is zero. It should be
close to 11N. The point where the straight line
crosses the vertical axis is called the vertical
axis intercept. So, in this case, the vertical-axis
intercept = 11N at co-ordinates (0, 11).

In another example, let the relationship between two
variables x and y be y = 3x + 2
When x = 0, y = 0 + 2 = 2
When x = 1, y = 3 + 2 = 5
When x = 2, y = 6 + 2 = 8, and so on.
The co-ordinates (0, 2), (1, 5) and (2, 8) have been
produced and are plotted, as shown in Fig. 17.6.
When the points are joined together a straight line
graph results, i.e. y = 3x + 2 is a straight line
graph.
17.3.1
Summary of general rules to be
applied when drawing graphs
(a)
Give the graph a title clearly explaining what is
being illustrated.
(b)
Choose scales such that the graph occupies as
much space as possible on the graph paper being
used.
(c)
Choose scales so that interpolation is made as
easy as possible. Usually scales such as 1cm =
1unit,1cm = 2 units or 1cm = 10 units are used.
Awkward scalessuch as1cm = 3unitsor1cm = 7
units should not be used.
(d)
The scales need not start at zero, particularly when
starting at zero produces an accumulation ofpoints
within a small area of the graph paper.
(e)
The co-ordinates, or points, should be clearly
marked. This is achieved by a cross, or a dot and
circle, or just by a dot (see Fig. 17.3).
(f)
A statement should be made next to each axis
explaining the numbers represented with their
appropriate units.
(g)
Sufﬁcient numbers should be written next to each
axis without cramping.
Problem 1.

necessary. The table is achieved as follows:

17.4 Gradients, intercepts and
equations of graphs
17.4.1
Gradients
The gradient or slope of a straight line is the ratio of
the change in the value of y to the change in the value of
x between any two points on the line. If, as x increases,
(→), y also increases, (↑), then the gradient is positive.
In Fig. 17.8(a), a straight line graph y = 2x + 1 is
shown. To ﬁnd the gradient of this straight line, choose
two points on the straight line graph, such as A and C.

In Fig. 17.8(b), a straight line graph y = −3x + 2 is
shown. To ﬁnd the gradient of this straight line, choose
two points on the straight line graph, such as D and F.
Then construct a right-angled triangle, such as DEF,
where EF is vertical and DE is horizontal.
Then, gradient of DF = change in y

Fig. 17.8(c) shows a straight line graph y = 3.
Since the straight line is horizontal the gradient
is zero.
17.4.2
The y-axis intercept
Thevalueof y when x = 0 iscalledthe y-axisintercept.
In Fig.17.8(a)the y-axisinterceptis1 andin Fig.17.8(b)
the y-axis intercept is 2
17.4.3
The equation of a straight line graph
The general equation of a straight line graph is
y = mx + c
where m is the gradient and c is the y-axis intercept.
Thus,
as
we
have
found
in
Fig.
17.8(a),
y = 2x + 1 represents a straight line of gradient 2 and
y-axis intercept 1. So, given the equation y = 2x + 1,
we are able to state, on sight, that the gradient = 2
and the y-axis intercept = 1, without the need for any
analysis.
Similarly, in Fig. 17.8(b), y = −3x + 2 represents a
straight line of gradient −3 and y-axis intercept 2
In Fig. 17.8(c), y = 3 may be rewritten as y = 0x + 3
and therefore represents a straight line of gradient 0 and
y-axis intercept 3
Here are some worked problems to help understanding
of gradients, intercepts and equations of graphs.
Problem 2.
Plot the following graphs on the same
axes in the range x = −4 to x = +4 and determine
the gradient of each.

The co-ordinates are plotted and joined for each graph.
The results are shown in Fig. 17.9. Each of the straight
lines produced is parallel to the others; i.e. the slope or
gradient is the same for each.
To ﬁnd the gradient of any straight line, say, y = x −3,
a horizontal and vertical component needs to be con-
structed. In Fig. 17.9, AB is constructed vertically at
x = 4 and BC is constructed horizontally at y = −3.
The gradient of AC = AB
BC = 1 −(−3)
4 −0
= 4
4 = 1
i.e. the gradient of the straight line y = x −3 is 1, which
could have been deduced ‘on sight’ since y = 1x −3
represents a straight line graph with gradient 1 and
y-axis intercept of −3
The actual positioning of AB and BC is unimportant
because the gradient is also given by
DE
EF = −1 −(−2)
2 −1
= 1
1 = 1
The slope or gradient of each of the straight lines
in Fig. 17.9 is thus 1 since they are parallel to each
other.

Hence, the gradients of both y = 3x and y = 3x + 7
are 3, which could have been deduced ‘on sight’.
y = −4x + 4 and y = −4x −5 are parallel to each other
and thus have the same gradient. The gradient of DF is
given by
FE
ED = −5 −(−17)
0 −3
= 12
−3 = −4
Hence, the gradient of both
y = −4x + 4 and
y = −4x −5 is −4, which, again, could have been
deduced ‘on sight’.
The y-axis intercept means the value of y where the
straight line cuts the y-axis. From Fig. 17.10,
y = 3x cuts the y-axis at y = 0
y = 3x + 7 cuts the y-axis at y = +7
y = −4x + 4 cuts the y-axis at y = +4
y = −4x −5 cuts the y-axis at y = −5
Some generalconclusionscan be drawn fromthe graphs
shown in Figs 17.9 and 17.10.Whenanequationis ofthe
form y = mx + c, where m and c are constants, then

156
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(a)
a graph of y against x produces a straight line,
(b)
m represents the slope or gradient of the line, and
(c)
c represents the y-axis intercept.
Thus, given an equation such as y = 3x + 7, it may be
deduced ‘on sight’ that its gradient is +3 and its y-axis
intercept is +7, as shown in Fig. 17.10. Similarly, if
y = −4x −5, the gradientis −4 and the y-axis intercept
is −5, as shown in Fig. 17.10.
When plotting a graphof the form y = mx + c, only two
co-ordinatesneedbedetermined.Whentheco-ordinates
are plotted a straight line is drawn between the two
points. Normally, three co-ordinatesare determined, the
third one acting as a check.
Problem 4.
Plot the graph 3x + y + 1 = 0 and
2y −5 = x on the same axes and ﬁnd their point of
intersection
Rearranging 3x + y + 1 = 0 gives
y = −3x −1
Rearranging 2y −5 = x
gives 2y = x + 5 and
y = 1
2x + 21

Since both equations are of the form y = mx + c, both
are straight lines. Knowing an equation is a straight
line means that only two co-ordinates need to be plot-
ted and a straight line drawn through them. A third
co-ordinate is usually determined to act as a check.

If y = mx + c then m = gradient and c = y-axis

(ii) y-axis intercept = 2
(b) If y = −4x + 7, then
(i) gradient = −4
(ii) y-axis intercept = 7
(c) If y = 3x i.e. y = 3x + 0,
then
(i) gradient = 3
(ii) y-axis intercept = 0
i.e. the straight line passes through the origin.
(d) If y = −5x −3, then
(i) gradient = −5
(ii) y-axis intercept = −3
(e) If y = 6 i.e. y = 0x + 6,
then
(i) gradient = 0
(ii) y-axis intercept = 6
i.e. y = 6 is a straight horizontal line.
(f) If y = x i.e. y = 1x + 0,
then
(i) gradient = 1
(ii) y-axis intercept = 0
Since y = x, as x increases, y increases by the same
amount; i.e. y is directly proportional to x.
Problem 6.
Without drawing graphs, determine
the gradient and y-axis intercept for each of the
following equations.
(a) y + 4 = 3x
(b) 2y + 8x = 6 (c) 3x = 4y + 7

Straight line graphs
157
If y = mx + c then m = gradient and c = y-axis
intercept.
(a)
Transposing y + 4 = 3x gives
y = 3x −4
Hence, gradient = 3 and y-axis intercept = −4
(b)
Transposing 2y + 8x = 6 gives 2y = −8x + 6
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
y = −4x + 3
Hence, gradient = −4 and y-axis intercept = 3
(c)
Transposing 3x = 4y + 7 gives 3x −7 = 4y
or
4y = 3x −7
Dividing both sides by 4 gives
y= 3

or
y=0.75x −1.75
Hence, gradient = 0.75 and
y-axis intercept = −1.75

(d) y

The vertical axis intercept is at v = 5.5 m/s.
The equation of a straight line graph is y = mx + c. In
this case, t corresponds to x and v corresponds to y.
Hence, the equation of the graph shown in Fig. 17.15
is v = mt + c. But, from above, gradient, m = 2.5 and
v-axis intercept, c = 5.5
Hence, the equation of the graph is v = 2.5 t + 5.5

17.5 Practical problems involving
straight line graphs
When a set of co-ordinate values are given or are
obtained experimentally and it is believed that they
follow a law of the form y = mx + c, if a straight line
can be drawn reasonably close to most ofthe co-ordinate
values when plotted, this veriﬁes that a law of the
form y = mx + c exists. From the graph, constants
m (i.e. gradient) and c (i.e. y-axis intercept) can be
determined.
Here are some worked problems in which practical
situations are featured.

The co-ordinates (10, 50), (20, 68), (40, 104), and
so on are plotted as shown in Fig. 17.17. When the
co-ordinates are joined, a straight line is produced.
Since a straight line results, there is a linear relationship
between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.

To ﬁnd the Fahrenheit temperature at 55◦C, a verti-
cal line AB is constructed from the horizontal axis
to meet the straight line at B. The point where the
horizontalline BD meets the vertical axis indicates
the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature.
Hence, 55◦C is equivalent to 131◦F.
This process of ﬁnding an equivalent value in
between the given information in the above table
is called interpolation.

(b)
To ﬁnd the Celsius temperature at 167◦F, a
horizontal line EF is constructed as shown in
Fig. 17.17. The point where the vertical line FG
cuts the horizontal axis indicates the equivalent
Celsius temperature.
Hence, 167◦F is equivalent to 75◦C.
(c)
If the graph is assumed to be linear even
outside of the given data, the graph may be
extended at both ends (shown by broken lines in
Fig. 17.17).
From Fig. 17.17, 0◦C corresponds to 32◦F.
(d)
230◦F is seen to correspond to 110◦C.
The process of ﬁnding equivalent values outside
of the given range is called extrapolation.

If a graph is plotted with both the scales starting at
zero then the result is as shown in Fig. 17.18. All of
the points lie in the top right-hand corner of the graph,
making interpolation difﬁcult. A more accurate graph is
obtained if the temperature axis starts at 55◦C and the
volume axis starts at 24.5m3. The axes correspondingto
these values are shown by the broken lines in Fig. 17.18
and are called false axes, since the origin is not now
at zero. A magniﬁed version of this relevant part of the
graph is shown in Fig. 17.19. From the graph,

Graphs reducing non-linear
laws to linear form
Why it is important to understand: Graphs reducing non-linear laws to linear form
Graphs are important tools for analysing and displaying data between two experimental quantities. Many
times situations occur in which the relationship between the variables is not linear. By manipulation, a
straight line graph may be plotted to produce a law relating the two variables. Sometimes this involves
using the laws of logarithms. The relationship between the resistance of wire and its diameter is not a
linear one. Similarly, the periodic time of oscillations of a pendulum does not have a linear relationship
with its length, and the head of pressure and the ﬂow velocity are not linearly related. There are thus
plenty of examples in engineering where determination of law is needed.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand what is meant by determination of law
•
prepare co-ordinates for a non-linear relationship between two variables
•
plot prepared co-ordinates and draw a straight line graph
•
determine the gradient and vertical axis intercept of a straight line graph
•
state the equation of a straight line graph
•
plot straight line graphs involving practical engineering examples
•
determine straight line laws involving logarithms: y = axn, y = abx and y = aebx
•
plot straight line graphs involving logarithms
18.1
Introduction
In Chapter 17 we discovered that the equation of a
straight line graph is of the form y = mx + c, where
m is the gradient and c is the y-axis intercept. This
chapterexplainshowthelawofagraph can stillbedeter-
mined even when it is not of the linear form y = mx + c.
The method used is called determination of law and is
explained in the following sections.
18.2
Determination of law
Frequently, the relationship between two variables, say
x and y, is not a linear one; i.e. when x is plotted against
y a curve results. In such cases the non-linear equation
may be modiﬁed to the linear form, y = mx + c, so that
the constants, and thus the law relating the variables, can
be determined. This technique is called ‘determination
of law’.

Some examples of the reduction of equations to linear
form include
(i)
y = ax2 + b compares with Y = mX + c, where
m = a, c = b and X = x2
Hence, y is plotted vertically against x2 horizon-
tally to produce a straight line graph of gradient
a and y-axis intercept b.
(ii)
y = a
x + b, i.e.
y = a
1
x

+ b
y is plotted vertically against 1
x horizontally to
produce a straight line graph of gradient a and
y-axis intercept b.
(iii)
y = ax2 + bx
Dividing both sides by x gives y
x = ax + b
Comparing with Y = mX + c shows that y
x is
plotted vertically against x horizontally to pro-
duce a straight line graph of gradient a and y
x
axis intercept b.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate deter-
mination of law.

possible to determine the values of constants a and b

Also,
lne = 1 and if, say, lg x = 1.5,
then x = 101.5 = 31.62
Further, if 3x = 7 then lg 3x = lg 7 and x lg 3 = lg 7,
from which x = lg 7
lg 3 = 1.771
Theselawsand techniquesareused whenevernon-linear
laws of the form y = axn, y = abx and y = aebx are
reduced to linear form with the values of aand b needing
to be calculated. This is demonstrated in the following
section.
18.4 Determination of laws involving
logarithms
Examples of the reduction of equations to linear form
involving logarithms include
(a)
y = axn
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides
gives
lg y = lg(axn)
= lga + lgxn by law (1)
i.e.
lg y = n lgx + lga by law (3)
which compares with Y = mX + c
and shows that lg y is plotted vertically against
lg x horizontally to produce a straight line graph
of gradient n and lg y-axis intercept lg a.
See worked Problems 4 and 5 to demonstrate how
this law is determined.
(b)
y = abx
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides
gives
lg y = lg(abx)
i.e.
lg y = lga + lgbx
by law (1)
lg y = lga + x lgb
by law (3)
i.e.
lg y = x lgb + lga
or
lg y = (lgb)x + lga
which compares with
Y = mX + c
and shows that lg y is plotted vertically against
x horizontally to produce a straight line graph
of gradient lg b and lg y-axis intercept lg a.
See worked Problem 6 to demonstrate how this law
is determined.
(c)
y = aebx
Taking logarithms to a base of e of both sides
gives
ln y = ln(aebx)
i.e.
ln y = lna + lnebx
by law (1)
i.e.
ln y = lna + bx lne
by law (3)
i.e.
ln y = bx + lna
since lne = 1
which compares with
Y = mX + c
and shows that ln y is plotted vertically against
x horizontally to produce a straight line graph
of gradient b and ln y-axis intercept ln a.
See worked Problem 7 to demonstrate how this
law is determined.

and determine the law
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of
P = RI n gives
lg P = lg(RI n) = lg R + lg I n = lg R + nlg I
by the laws of logarithms
i.e.
lg P = n lg I + lg R
which is of the form Y = mX + c,
showing that lg P is to be plotted vertically against lg I

It is not possible to determine the vertical axis intercept
on sight since the horizontal axis scale does not start
at zero. Selecting any point from the graph, say point
D, where lg I = 0.70 and lg P = 2.78 and substituting
values into
lg P = n lg I + lg R
gives
2.78 = (2)(0.70) + lg R
from which,
lg R = 2.78 −1.40 = 1.38
Hence,
R = antilog 1.38 = 101.38 = 24.0
Hence, the law of the graph is P = 24.0I2

When x = 2.1, y = 5.0(3.0)2.1 = 50.2
(b)
When
y = 100,100 = 5.0(3.0)x,
from
which
100/5.0 = (3.0)x
i.e.
20 = (3.0)x
Taking logarithms of both sides gives
lg20 = lg(3.0)x = x lg3.0

Graphical solution of
equations
Why it is important to understand: Graphical solution of equations
It has been established in previous chapters that the solution of linear, quadratic, simultaneous and
cubic equations occur often in engineering and science and may be solved using algebraic means. Being
able to solve equations graphically provides another method to aid understanding and interpretation of
equations. Engineers, including architects, surveyors and a variety of engineers in ﬁelds such as biomed-
ical, chemical, electrical, mechanical and nuclear, all use equations which need solving by one means or
another.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
solve two simultaneous equations graphically
•
solve a quadratic equation graphically
•
solve a linear and quadratic equation simultaneously by graphical means
•
solve a cubic equation graphically
19.1 Graphical solution of
simultaneous equations
Linear simultaneous equations in two unknowns may
be solved graphically by
(a)
plotting the two straight lines on the same axes,
and
(b)
noting their point of intersection.
The co-ordinates of the point of intersection give the
required solution.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the
graphical solution of simultaneous equations.
Problem 1.
Solve graphically the simultaneous
equations
2x −y = 4
x + y = 5
Rearranging each equation into y = mx + c form gives
y = 2x −4
y = −x + 5
Only three co-ordinates need be calculated for each
graph since both are straight lines.

Hence, the solution of the simultaneous equations is
x = 2.50, y = −1.20
(It is sometimes useful to initially sketch the two straight
lines to determine the region where the point of inter-
section is. Then, for greater accuracy, a graph having a
smaller range of values can be drawn to ‘magnify’ the
point of intersection.)

equations
A
general
quadratic
equation
is
of
the
form
y = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are constants and
a is not equal to zero.
A graph of a quadratic equation always produces a shape
called a parabola.
The gradients of the curves between 0 and A and
between B and C in Fig. 19.3 are positive, whilst the gra-
dient between A and B is negative. Points such as A and
B are called turning points. At A the gradient is zero
and, as x increases, the gradient of the curve changes
from positive just before A to negative just after. Such
a point is called a maximum value. At B the gradi-
ent is also zero and, as x increases, the gradient of the
curve changes from negative just before B to positive
just after. Such a point is called a minimum value.

Quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0
may be solved graphically by

plotting the graph y = ax2 + bx + c, and

The x values of the points of intersection give the
required solutions since at these points both y = 0 and

The number of solutions, or roots, of a quadratic equa-
tion depends on how many times the curve cuts the
x-axis. There can be no real roots, as in Fig. 19.7(a),
one root, as in Figs 19.4 and 19.5, or two roots, as in
Fig. 19.7(b).
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the

Figure 19.8
A graph of y = 4x2 + 4x −15 is shown in Fig. 19.8.
The only points where y = 4x2 + 4x −15 and y = 0
are the points marked A and B. This occurs at x = −2.5
and x = 1.5 and these are the solutions of the quadratic
equation 4x2 + 4x −15 = 0
By substituting x = −2.5 and x = 1.5 into the original
equation the solutions may be checked.
The curve has a turning point at (−0.5,−16) and the
nature of the point is a minimum.
An
alternative
graphical
method
of
solving
4x2 + 4x −15 = 0 is to rearrange the equation as
4x2 = −4x + 15 and then plot two separate graphs
−in this case, y = 4x2 and y = −4x + 15. Their
points of intersection give the roots of the equation
4x2 = −4x + 15, i.e. 4x2 + 4x −15 = 0. This is shown
in Fig. 19.9, where the roots are x = −2.5 and x = 1.5,
as before.

The parabola y = −2x2 + 3x + 6 and the straight
line y = 0 intersect at A and B, where x = −1.13
and x = 2.63, and these are the roots of the
equation −2x2 + 3x + 6 = 0
(b)
Comparing
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6
(1)
with
0 = −2x2 + 3x + 2
(2)
shows that, if 4 is added to both sides of
equation (2), the RHS of both equations will
be the same. Hence, 4 = −2x2 + 3x + 6. The
solution of this equation is found from the
points of intersection of the line y = 4 and
the parabola y = −2x2 + 3x + 6; i.e. points C
and D in Fig. 19.12. Hence, the roots of
−2x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 are x = −0.5 and x = 2
(c)
−2x2 + 3x + 9 = 0
may
be
rearranged
as
−2x2 + 3x + 6 = −3 and the solution of this
equation is obtained from the points of inter-
section of the line y = −3 and the parabola
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6; i.e. at points E and F in
Fig. 19.12. Hence, the roots of −2x2 + 3x + 9 = 0
are x = −1.5 and x = 3
(d)
Comparing
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6
(3)
with
0 = −2x2 + x + 5
(4)
shows that, if 2x + 1 is added to both sides of
equation (4), the RHS of both equations will be
the same. Hence, equation (4) may be written
as 2x + 1 = −2x2 + 3x + 6. The solution of this
equation is found from the points of intersec-
tion of the line y = 2x + 1 and the parabola
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6; i.e. points G and H in
Fig. 19.12. Hence, the roots of −2x2 + x + 5 = 0
are x = −1.35 and x = 1.85

Chapter 20
Angles and triangles
Why it is important to understand: Angles and triangles
Knowledge of angles and triangles is very important in engineering. Trigonometry is needed in survey-
ing and architecture, for building structures/systems, designing bridges and solving scientiﬁc problems.
Trigonometry is also used in electrical engineering; the functions that relate angles and side lengths in
right-angled triangles are useful in expressing how a.c. electric current varies with time. Engineers use
triangles to determine how much force it will take to move along an incline, GPS satellite receivers use
triangles to determine exactly where they are in relation to satellites orbiting hundreds of miles away.
Whether you want to build a skateboard ramp, a stairway, or a bridge, you can’t escape trigonometry.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne an angle: acute, right, obtuse, reﬂex, complementary, supplementary
•
deﬁne parallel lines, transversal, vertically opposite angles, corresponding angles, alternate angles, interior
angles
•
deﬁne degrees, minutes, seconds, radians
•
add and subtract angles
•
state types of triangles – acute, right, obtuse, equilateral, isosceles, scalene
•
deﬁne hypotenuse, adjacent and opposite sides with reference to an angle in a right-angled triangle
•
recognise congruent triangles
•
recognise similar triangles
•
construct triangles, given certain sides and angles
20.1
Introduction
Trigonometry is a subject that involves the measurement
of sides and angles of triangles and their relationship to
each other. This chapter involves the measurement of
angles and introduces types of triangle.
20.2
Angular measurement
An angle is the amount of rotation between two straight
lines. Angles may be measured either in degrees or in
radians.
If a circle is divided into 360 equal parts, then each part
is called 1 degree and is written as 1◦
i.e.
1 revolution = 360◦
or
1 degree is
1
360th of a revolution
Some angles are given special names.
•
Any angle between 0◦and 90◦is called an acute
angle.
•
An angle equal to 90◦is called a right angle.
•
Any angle between 90◦and 180◦is called an obtuse
angle.

188
Basic Engineering Mathematics
•
Any angle greater than 180◦and less than 360◦is
called a reﬂex angle.
•
An angle of 180◦lies on a straight line.
•
If two angles add up to 90◦they are called comple-
mentary angles.
•
If two angles add up to 180◦they are called supple-
mentary angles.
•
Parallel lines are straight lines which are in the same
plane and never meet. Such lines are denoted by
arrows, as in Fig. 20.1.
•
A straight line which crosses two parallel lines is
called a transversal (see MN in Fig. 20.1).

With reference to Fig. 20.1,
(a)
a = c, b = d, e = g and f = h. Such pairs of
angles are called vertically opposite angles.
(b)
a = e, b = f , c = g and d = h. Such pairs of
angles are called corresponding angles.
(c)
c = e and b = h. Such pairs of angles are called
alternate angles.
(d)
b + e = 180◦and c + h = 180◦. Such pairs of
angles are called interior angles.
20.2.1
Minutes and seconds
One degree may be subdivided into 60 parts, called
minutes.
i.e.
1 degree = 60 minutes
which is written as
1◦= 60′
41 degrees and 29 minutes is written as 41◦29′. 41◦29′
is equivalent to 4129◦
60 = 41.483◦as a decimal, correct
to 3 decimal places by calculator.
1 minute further subdivides into 60 seconds,
i.e.
1 minute = 60 seconds
which is written as
1′ = 60′′
(Notice that for minutes, 1 dash is used and for seconds,
2 dashes are used.)
For example, 56 degrees, 36 minutes and 13 seconds is
written as 56◦36′13′′
20.2.2
Radians and degrees
One radian is deﬁned as the anglesubtended atthecentre
of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius. (For
more on circles, see Chapter 26.)
With reference to Fig. 20.2, for arc length s,
θ radians = s

Figure 20.2
When s
is the whole circumference, i.e. when
s = 2πr,
θ = s
r = 2πr
r
= 2π
In one revolution, θ = 360◦. Hence, the relationship
between degrees and radians is
360◦= 2π radians or 180◦= π rad
i.e.
1 rad = 180◦

A right-angled triangle ABC is shown in Fig. 20.19.
The point of intersection of two lines is called a vertex
(plural vertices); the three vertices of the triangle are
labelled as A, B and C, respectively. The right angle
is angle C. The side opposite the right angle is given
the special name of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse,
length AB in Fig. 20.19, is always the longest side of a
right-angled triangle. With reference to angle B, AC is
the opposite side and BC is called the adjacent side.
With reference to angle A, BC is the opposite side and
AC is the adjacent side.
Often sides of a triangle are labelled with lower case
letters, a being the side opposite angle A,b being the
side opposite angle B and c being the side opposite
angle C. So, in the triangle ABC, length AB = c, length
BC = a and length AC = b. Thus, c is the hypotenuse
in the triangle ABC.
∠is the symbol used for ‘angle’. For example, in the
triangle shown, ∠C = 90◦. Another way of indicating
an angle is to use all three letters. For example, ∠ABC
actually means ∠B; i.e. we take the middle letter as the
angle. Similarly, ∠BAC means ∠A and ∠ACB means
∠C.
Here are some worked examples to help us understand
more about triangles.

Hence, ∠C = 180◦−90◦−62◦= 28◦. Thus,
∠DCE = 28◦(vertically opposite angles).
θ = ∠DCE + ∠DEC (the exterior angle of a triangle is
equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles).
Hence, ∠θ = 28◦+ 15◦= 43◦
∠α and ∠DEC are supplementary; thus,

The sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180◦.
Hence, ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180◦−56◦= 124◦
Since ∠ABC = ∠ACB then
∠ABC = ∠ACB = 124◦

∠PXZ = 180◦−∠RXZ and ∠QYZ = 180◦−∠RYZ.
Thus, ∠PXZ = ∠QYZ.
Triangles PXZ and QYZ are congruent since
∠XPZ = ∠YQZ, PZ = ZQ and ∠XZP = ∠YZQ (ASA).
Hence, XZ = YZ.
Triangles PRZ and QRZ are congruent since

Introduction to trigonometry
Why it is important to understand: Introduction to trigonometry
There are an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and trigonometric functions. Fields that use
trigonometry or trigonometric functions include astronomy (especially for locating apparent positions
of celestial objects, in which spherical trigonometry is essential) and hence navigation (on the oceans, in
aircraft, and in space), music theory, acoustics, optics, analysis of ﬁnancial markets, electronics, prob-
ability theory, statistics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scans and ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry,
number theory (and hence cryptology), seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences,
land surveying and geodesy (a branch of earth sciences), architecture, phonetics, economics, electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography,crystallography
and game development. It is clear that a good knowledge of trigonometry is essential in many ﬁelds of
engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the theorem of Pythagoras and use it to ﬁnd the unknown side of a right-angled triangle
•
deﬁne sine, cosine and tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle
•
evaluate trigonometric ratios of angles
•
solve right-angled triangles
•
understand angles of elevation and depression
21.1
Introduction
Trigonometry is a subject that involves the measurement
of sides and angles of triangles and their relationship to
each other.
The theorem of Pythagoras and trigonometric ratios
are used with right-angled triangles only. However,
there are many practical examples in engineering where
knowledge of right-angled triangles is very important.
In this chapter, three trigonometric ratios – i.e. sine,
cosine and tangent – are deﬁned and then evaluated
using a calculator. Finally, solving right-angled triangle
problems using Pythagoras and trigonometric ratios
is demonstrated, together with some practical examples
involving angles of elevation and depression.
21.2
The theorem of Pythagoras
The theorem of Pythagoras∗states:
In any right-angled triangle, the square of the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
other two sides.

In the right-angled triangle ABC shown in Fig. 21.1, this
means

(1)
B
A
C
a

Figure 21.1
If the lengths of any two sides of a right-angled triangle
are known, the length of the third side may be calculated
by Pythagoras’ theorem.
From equation (1):
b =

a2 + c2
Transposing equation (1) for a gives a2 = b2 −c2, from
which a =
√
b2 −c2
Transposing equation (1) for c gives c2 = b2 −a2, from
which c =
√
b2 −a2
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the
theorem of Pythagoras.
Problem 1.
In Fig. 21.2, ﬁnd the length of BC
B
A
C
a
b4 cm
c  3cm
Figure 21.2
From Pythagoras, a2 = b2 + c2
i.e.
a2 = 42 + 32
= 16 + 9 = 25
Hence,
a =
√
25 = 5cm.
√
25 = ±5 but in a practical example like this an answer
of a = −5cm has no meaning, so we take only the
positive answer.
Thus
a = BC = 5cm.
ABC is a 3, 4, 5 triangle. There are not many right-
angled triangles which have integer values (i.e. whole
numbers) for all three sides.
Problem 2.
In Fig. 21.3, ﬁnd the length of EF
E
d
F
D
f 5cm
e13cm
Figure 21.3
By Pythagoras’ theorem,
e2 = d2 + f 2
Hence,
132 = d2 + 52
169 = d2 + 25
d2 = 169 −25 = 144
Thus,
d =
√
144 = 12cm
i.e.
d = EF = 12cm
DEF is a 5, 12, 13 triangle, another right-angled
triangle which has integer values for all three sides.
Problem 3.
Two aircraft leave an airﬁeld at the
same time. One travels due north at an average
speed of 300km/h and the other due west at an
average speed of 220km/h. Calculate their distance
apart after 4hours
After 4 hours, the ﬁrst aircraft has travelled
4 × 300 = 1200km due north
and the second aircraft has travelled
4 × 220 = 880km due west,
as shown in Fig. 21.4. The distance apart after
4hours = BC.

and
BC =

2214400 = 1488km.

21.4 Evaluating trigonometric ratios
of acute angles
The easiest way to evaluate trigonometric ratios of any
angle is to use a calculator. Use a calculator to check the
following (each correct to 4 decimal places).
sin29◦= 0.4848
sin53.62◦= 0.8051
cos67◦= 0.3907 cos83.57◦= 0.1120
tan34◦= 0.6745 tan67.83◦= 2.4541
sin67◦43′ = sin6743
60
◦
= sin67.7166666...◦= 0.9253
cos13◦28′ = cos1328
60
◦
= cos13.466666...◦= 0.9725
tan56◦54′ = tan5654
60
◦
= tan56.90◦= 1.5340
If we know the value of a trigonometricratio and need to
ﬁnd the angle we use the inverse function on our calcu-
lators. For example, using shift and sin on our calculator
gives sin−1(
If, for example, we know the sine of an angle is 0.5 then
the value of the angle is given by
sin−1 0.5 = 30◦(Check that sin30◦= 0.5)
Similarly, if
cosθ = 0.4371 then θ = cos−1 0.4371 = 64.08◦
and if
tan A = 3.5984 then A = tan−1 3.5984 = 74.47◦
each correct to 2 decimal places.
Use your calculator to check the following worked
problems.

Problem 10.
Evaluate sin 1.481, correct to 4
signiﬁcant ﬁgures
sin 1.481means the sine of 1.481radians. (If there is no

a calculator needs to be on the radian function.
Hence, sin1.481 = 0.9960
Problem 11.
Evaluate cos(3π/5), correct to 4
signiﬁcant ﬁgures
As in Problem 10, 3π/5 is in radians.
Hence, cos(3π/5) = cos1.884955... = −0.3090
Since, from page 188, πradians = 180◦,
3π/5 rad = 3
5 × 180◦= 108◦
i.e. 3π/5 rad = 108◦. Check with your calculator that
cos108◦= −0.3090

It is important to know when to have your calculator on
either degrees mode or radian mode. A lot of mistakes
can arise from this if we are not careful.
Problem 13.
Find the acute angle sin−1 0.4128 in

Basic Engineering Mathematics
Six piecesofinformation describeatrianglecompletely;
i.e. three sides and three angles. As long as at least
three facts are known, the other three can usually be
calculated.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the

There is usually more than one way to solve such a

In triangle ABC,

Transposing gives

cos42◦= BC
AB = 6.2

AB =

Alternatively,
by

from
which

AC2 + BC2 =

To ‘solve the triangle ABC’ means ‘to ﬁnd the length

sinC = 35

C = sin−1 0.94595 = 71.08◦
B = 180◦−90◦−71.08◦= 18.92◦(since the angles in
a triangle add up to 180◦)
sin B = AC
37 , hence
AC = 37sin18.92◦= 37(0.3242) = 12.0mm
or, using Pythagoras’ theorem, 372 = 352 + AC2, from
which AC =

Chapter 22
Trigonometric waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Trigonometric waveforms
Trigonometric graphs are commonly used in all areas of science and engineering for modelling many
different natural and mechanical phenomena such as waves, engines, acoustics, electronics, populations,
UV intensity, growth of plants and animals, and so on. Periodic trigonometric graphs mean that the
shape repeats itself exactly after a certain amount of time. Anything that has a regular cycle, like the
tides, temperatures, rotation of the earth, and so on, can be modelled using a sine or cosine curve. The most
common periodic signal waveform that is used in electrical and electronic engineering is the sinusoidal
waveform. However, an alternating a.c. waveform may not always take the shape of a smooth shape based
around the sine and cosine function; a.c. waveforms can also take the shape of square or triangular waves,
i.e. complex waves. In engineering, it is therefore important to have some clear understanding of sine and
cosine waveforms.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
sketch sine, cosine and tangent waveforms
•
determine angles of any magnitude
•
understand cycle, amplitude, period, periodic time, frequency, lagging/leading angles with reference to sine
and cosine waves
•
perform calculations involving sinusoidal form A sin(ωt ±α)
22.1 Graphs of trigonometric
functions
By drawing up tables of values from 0◦to 360◦, graphs
of y = sin A, y = cos A and y = tan A may be plotted.

while those to the left and downwards are negative.
Let 0A be free to rotate about 0. By convention,
when 0A moves anticlockwise angular measurement is
considered positive, and vice versa.

be constructed to form the right-angled triangle 0AB
in Fig. 22.3. Since all three sides of the triangle are
positive, the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tan-
gent will all be positive in the ﬁrst quadrant. (Note:
0A is always positive since it is the radius of a
circle.)

The above results are summarised in Fig. 22.4, in which
all three trigonometric ratios are positive in the ﬁrst
quadrant, only sine is positive in the second quadrant,
only tangent is positive in the third quadrant and only
cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant.
The underlined letters in Fig. 22.4 spell the word CAST
when starting in the fourth quadrant and moving in an
anticlockwise direction.
It is seen that, in the ﬁrst quadrant of Fig. 22.1, all of the
curves have positive values; in the second only sine is
positive; in the third only tangent is positive; and in the
fourth only cosine is positive – exactly as summarised
in Fig. 22.4.
A knowledge of angles of any magnitude is needed
when ﬁnding, for example, all the angles between
0◦and 360◦whose sine is, say, 0.3261. If 0.3261 is
entered into a calculator and then the inverse sine key
pressed (or sin−1 key) the answer 19.03◦appears.
However, there is a second angle between 0◦and 360◦
which the calculator does not give. Sine is also positive
in the second quadrant (either from CAST or from
Fig. 22.1(a)). The other angle is shown in Fig. 22.5 as
angle θ, where θ = 180◦−19.03◦= 160.97◦. Thus,

the following worked problems.
Problem 1.
Determine all of the angles between
0◦and 360◦whose sine is −0.4638
The angles whose sine is −0.4638 occur in the third
and fourth quadrants since sine is negative in these
quadrants – see Fig. 22.6.
From Fig. 22.7, θ = sin−1 0.4638 = 27.63◦. Measured
from 0◦, the two angles between 0◦and 360◦whose sine
is −0.4638 are 180◦+ 27.63◦i.e. 207.63◦and 360◦–
27.63◦, i.e. 332.37◦. (Note that if a calculator is used
to determine sin−1(−0.4638) it only gives one answer:
−27.632588◦)

22.3 The production of sine and
cosine waves
In Fig. 22.11, let OR be a vector 1 unit long and free to
rotate anticlockwise about 0. In one revolutiona circle is
produced and isshown with 15◦sectors.Eachradiusarm
has a vertical and a horizontal component. For example,
at 30◦, the vertical component is TS and the horizontal
component is OS.
From triangle OST,
sin30◦= TS
TO = TS
1
i.e.
TS = sin30◦
and
cos30◦= OS
TO = OS
1
i.e. OS = cos30◦
22.3.1
Sine waves
The vertical component TS may be projected across to
T ′S′, which is the corresponding value of 30◦on the
graph of y against angle x◦. If all such vertical compo-
nents as TS are projected on to the graph, a sine wave
is produced as shown in Fig. 22.11.
22.3.2
Cosine waves
If all horizontal components such as OS are projected
on to a graph of y against angle x◦, a cosine wave is
produced. It is easier to visualise these projections by
redrawing the circle with the radius arm OR initially in
a vertical position as shown in Fig. 22.12.
It is seen from Figs 22.11 and 22.12 that a cosine curve
is of the same form as the sine curve but is displaced by
90◦(or π/2 radians). Both sine and cosine waves repeat
every 360◦
22.4 Terminology involved with sine
and cosine waves
Sine waves are extremely important in engineering, with
examples occurring with alternating currents and volt-
ages – the mains supply is a sine wave – and with simple
harmonic motion.
22.4.1
Cycle
When a sine wave has passed through a complete
series of values, both positive and negative, it is said
to have completed one cycle. One cycle of a sine
wave is shown in Fig. 22.1(a) on page 221 and in
Fig. 22.11.
22.4.2
Amplitude
The amplitude is the maximum value reached in a half
cycle by a sine wave. Another name for amplitude is
peak value or maximum value.
A sine wave y = 5sin x has an amplitude of 5, a
sine wave v = 200sin314t has an amplitude of 200
and the sine wave y = sin x shown in Fig. 22.11 has
an amplitude of 1.
22.4.3
Period
The waveforms y = sinx and y = cosx repeat them-
selves every 360◦. Thus, for each, the period is 360◦.
A waveform of y = tanx has a period of 180◦(from
Fig. 22.1(c)).
A graph of y = 3sin2A, as shown in Fig. 22.13, has an
amplitude of 3 and period 180◦
A graph of y = sin3A, as shown in Fig. 22.14, has an
amplitude of 1 and period of 120◦

Periodic time
In practice, the horizontal axis of a sine wave will be
time. The time taken for a sine wave to complete one
cycle is called the periodic time, T.
In the sine wave of voltage v (volts) against time t
(milliseconds) shown in Fig. 22.17, the amplitude is
10V and the periodic time is 20ms; i.e. T = 20ms.

Lagging and leading angles
A sine or cosine curve may not always start at 0◦.
To show this, a periodic function is represented by
y = Asin(x ± α) where α is a phase displacement
compared with y = Asinx. For example, y = sin A is
shown by the broken line in Fig. 22.18 and, on the
same axes, y = sin(A −60◦) is shown. The graph
y = sin(A −60◦) is said to lag y = sin A by 60◦
In another example, y = cos A is shown by the bro-
ken line in Fig. 22.19 and, on the same axes, y =
cos(A+45◦) is shown. The graph y= cos(A+45◦)
is said to lead y = cos A by 45◦

A sketch of y = 5sin(A + 30◦) is shown in Fig. 22.20.
Problem 8.
Sketch y = 7sin(2A −π/3) in the

An oscillating mechanism has a
maximum displacement of 2.5m and a frequency of
60Hz. At time t = 0 the displacement is 90cm.
Express the displacement in the general form
Asin(ωt ± α)
Amplitude = maximum displacement = 2.5m.
Angular velocity, ω = 2π f = 2π(60) = 120π rad/s.
Hence,
displacement = 2.5sin(120πt + α)m.
When t = 0, displacement = 90cm = 0.90m
Hence,
0.90 = 2.5sin(0 + α)
i.e.
sinα = 0.90
2.5 = 0.36
Hence,
α = sin−1 0.36 = 21.10◦

Thus, displacement = 2.5sin(120πt + 0.368) m

Non-right-angled triangles
and some practical
applications
Why it is important to understand: Non-right-angled triangles and some practical applications
As was mentioned earlier, ﬁelds that use trigonometry include astronomy, navigation, music theory,
acoustics, optics, electronics, probability theory, statistics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scans and
ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry, seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences, land
surveying, architecture, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering,
computer graphics, cartography and crystallography. There are so many examples where triangles are
involved in engineering, and the ability to solve such triangles is of great importance.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state and use the sine rule
•
state and use the cosine rule
•
use various formulae to determine the area of any triangle
•
apply the sine and cosine rules to solving practical trigonometric problems
23.1
The sine and cosine rules
To ‘solve a triangle’ means ‘to ﬁnd the values of
unknown sides and angles’. If a triangle is right-angled,
trigonometric ratios and the theorem of Pythagoras∗
may be used for its solution, as shown in Chap-
ter 21. However, for a non-right-angled triangle,
∗Who was Pythagoras? To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird
trigonometric ratios and Pythagoras’ theorem cannot be
used. Instead, two rules, called the sine rule and the
cosine rule, are used.
23.1.1
The sine rule
With reference to triangle ABC of Fig. 23.1, the sine
rule states

sin A =

sin B =

rule states

The rule may be used only when

of triangles and their areas
Problem 1.
In a triangle XYZ, ∠X = 51◦,
∠Y = 67◦and YZ = 15.2cm. Solve the triangle and
ﬁnd its area
The triangle XYZ is shown in Fig. 23.2. Solving the
triangle means ﬁnding ∠Z and sides XZ and XY.
Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180◦,

(or area = 1
2xz sinY = 1
2(15.2)(17.27) sin67◦

It is always worth checking with triangle problems that
the longest side is opposite the largest angle and vice
versa. In this problem, Y is the largest angle and X Z is
the longest of the three sides.
Problem 2.
Solve the triangle ABC given
B = 78◦51′,AC = 22.31mm and AB = 17.92mm.
Also ﬁnd its area
Triangle ABC is shown in Fig. 23.3. Solving the triangle

Since B = 78◦51′, C cannot be 128◦0′, since 128◦0′ +

valid.

Hence,

When P = 46.45◦and Q = 36◦then
R = 180◦−46.45◦−36◦= 97.55◦
When P = 133.55◦and Q = 36◦then
R = 180◦−133.55◦−36◦= 10.45◦
Thus, in this problem, there are two separate sets of
results and both are feasible solutions. Such a situation
is called the ambiguous case.

A triangle ABC has sides
a = 9.0cm,b = 7.5cm and c = 6.5cm. Determine
its three angles and its area
Triangle ABC is shown in Fig. 23.7. It is usual ﬁrst
to calculate the largest angle to determine whether the
triangle is acute or obtuse. In this case the largest angle
is A (i.e. opposite the longest side).

a9.0cm

Applying the cosine rule,
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bccos A
from which
2bccos A = b2 + c2 −a2
and
cos A = b2 + c2 −a2
2bc
= 7.52 + 6.52 −9.02
2(7.5)(6.5)
= 0.1795
Hence,
A = cos−1 0.1795 = 79.67◦
(or 280.33◦, which is clearly impossible)
The triangle is thus acute angled since cos A is positive.
(If cos A had been negative, angle A would be obtuse;
i.e. would lie between 90◦and 180◦)
Applying the sine rule,
9.0

travelling at a constant speed. Find the average

After 5 hours the walker has travelled 5 × 6.5= 32.5km

Chapter 24
Cartesian and polar
co-ordinates
Why it is important to understand: Cartesian and polar co-ordinates
Applications where polar co-ordinates would be used include terrestrial navigation with sonar-like
devices, and those in engineering and science involving energy radiation patterns. Applications where
Cartesian co-ordinates would be used include any navigation on a grid and anything involving raster
graphics (i.e. bitmap – a dot matrix data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels).
The ability to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates is vitally important when using complex
numbers and their use in a.c. electrical circuit theory and with vector geometry.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates
•
change from polar to Cartesian co-ordinates
•
use a scientiﬁc notation calculator to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates and vice-versa
24.1
Introduction
There are two ways in which the position of a point in
a plane can be represented. These are
(a)
Cartesian co-ordinates, (named after Descartes∗),
i.e. (x, y)
(b)
Polar co-ordinates, i.e. (r, θ), where r is a radius
from a ﬁxed point and θ is an angle from a ﬁxed
point.

24.2 Changing from Cartesian to
polar co-ordinates
In Fig. 24.1, if lengths x and y are known then the
length of r can be obtained from Pythagoras’ theorem

x are the two formulae we
need to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates.
The angle θ, which may be expressed in degrees or
radians, must always be measured from the positive
x-axis; i.e. measured from the line OQ in Fig. 24.1.
It is suggested that when changing from Cartesian
to polar co-ordinates a diagram should always be
sketched.
Problem 1.
Change the Cartesian co-ordinates
(3, 4) into polar co-ordinates
A diagram representing the point (3, 4) is shown in
Fig. 24.2.

3 = 53.13◦
or
0.927rad.
Note that 53.13◦= 53.13 × π
180 rad = 0.927rad.
Hence, (3, 4) in Cartesian co-ordinates corre-
sponds to (5, 53.13◦) or (5, 0.927 rad) in polar
co-ordinates.
Problem 2.
Express in polar co-ordinates the

co-ordinates (−4, 3) is shown in Fig. 24.3.

Hence, θ = 180◦−36.87◦= 143.13◦
or
θ = π −0.644 = 2.498 rad
Hence, the position of point P in polar co-ordinate
form is (5, 143.13◦) or (5, 2.498rad).

Hence, θ = 180◦+ 67.38◦= 247.38◦
or
θ = π + 1.176 = 4.318 rad.
Thus, (−5, −12) in Cartesian co-ordinates corre-
sponds to (13, 247.38◦) or (13, 4.318 rad) in polar
co-ordinates.

Hence, θ = 360◦−68.20◦= 291.80◦
or θ =
2π −1.190 = 5.093 rad.
Thus, (2, −5) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds
to (5.385, 291.80◦) or (5.385, 5.093rad) in polar co-
ordinates.

(3.39, 2.12) in Cartesian co-ordinates.

y = r sinθ = 6sin137◦= 4.092
which corresponds to length AB in Fig. 24.8.
Thus, (6, 137◦) in polar co-ordinates corresponds to
(−4.388, 4.092) in Cartesian co-ordinates.
(Note that when changing from polar to Cartesian co-
ordinates it is not quite so essential to draw a sketch. Use
of x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ automatically produces
the correct values and signs.)

y = r sinθ = 4.5sin5.16 = −4.057
which corresponds to length AB in Fig. 24.9.
Thus, (1.948, −4.057) in Cartesian co-ordinates cor-
responds to (4.5, 5.16 rad) in polar co-ordinates.

24.4 Use of Pol/Rec functions on
calculators
Another name for Cartesian co-ordinates is rectangular
co-ordinates. Many scientiﬁc notation calculators have
Pol and Rec functions. ‘Rec’ is an abbreviation of ‘rect-
angular’ (i.e. Cartesian) and ‘Pol’ is an abbreviation of
‘polar’. Check the operation manual for your particular
calculator to determine how to use these two func-
tions. They make changing from Cartesian to polar co-
ordinates, and vice-versa, so much quicker and easier.
For example, with the Casio fx-991ES PLUS calculator,
or similar, to change the Cartesian number (3, 4) into
polar form, the following procedure is adopted.

Cartesian and polar co-ordinates

7. Press =
The answer is r = 5,θ = 53.13◦
Hence, (3, 4) in Cartesian form is the same as
(5, 53.13◦) in polar form.
If the angle is required in radians, then before repeating
the above procedure press ‘shift’, ‘mode’ and then 4 to
change your calculator to radian mode.
Similarly, to change the polar form number (7, 126◦)
into Cartesian or rectangular form, adopt the following
procedure.
1.
Press ‘shift’
2. Press ‘Rec’
3.
Enter 7
4. Enter ‘comma’
5.
Enter 126 (assuming your calculator is in degrees
mode)
6.
Press )
7. Press =
The answer is X = −4.11 and, scrolling across,
Y = 5.66, correct to 2 decimal places.
Hence, (7, 126◦) in polar form is the same as
(−4.11,
5.66)
in
rectangular
or
Cartesian
form.

Areas of common shapes
Why it is important to understand: Areas of common shapes
To paint, wallpaper or panel a wall, you must know the total area of the wall so you can buy the appropriate
amount of ﬁnish. When designing a new building, or seeking planning permission, it is often necessary
to specify the total ﬂoor area of the building. In construction, calculating the area of a gable end of a
building is important when determining the number of bricks and amount of mortar to order. When
using a bolt, the most important thing is that it is long enough for your particular application and it
may also be necessary to calculate the shear area of the bolt connection. Ridge vents allow a home to
properly vent, while disallowing rain or other forms of precipitation to leak into the attic or crawlspace
underneath the roof. Equal amounts of cool air and warm air ﬂowing through the vents is paramount for
proper heat exchange. Calculating how much surface area is available on the roof aids in determining
how long the ridge vent should run. Arches are everywhere, from sculptures and monuments to pieces
of architecture and strings on musical instruments; ﬁnding the height of an arch or its cross-sectional
area is often required. Determining the cross-sectional areas of beam structures is vitally important in
design engineering. There are thus a large number of situations in engineering where determining area
is important.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the SI unit of area
•
identify common polygons – triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon
•
identify common quadrilaterals – rectangle, square, parallelogram, rhombus and trapezium
•
calculate areas of quadrilaterals and circles
•
appreciate that areas of similar shapes are proportional to the squares of the corresponding linear dimensions
25.1
Introduction
Area is a measure of the size or extent of a plane surface.
Area is measured in square units such as mm2, cm2 and
m2. This chapter deals with ﬁnding the areas of common
shapes.
In engineering it is often important to be able to calcu-
late simple areas of various shapes. In everyday life its
important to be able to measure area to, say, lay a car-
pet, order sufﬁcient paint for a decorating job or order
sufﬁcient bricks for a new wall.
On completingthis chapter you will be able to recognise
common shapes and be able to ﬁnd the areas of rectan-
gles, squares, parallelograms, triangles, trapeziums and
circles.

Quadrilaterals
There are ﬁve types of quadrilateral, these being rect-
angle, square, parallelogram, rhombus and trapezium.
If the opposite corners of any quadrilateral are joined
by a straight line, two triangles are produced. Since the
sum of the angles of a triangle is 180◦, the sum of the
angles of a quadrilateral is 360◦

(a)
all four angles are right angles,
(b)
the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length,
and
(c)
diagonals AC and BDare equal in length and bisect
one another.
Square

(a)
ABCD is a square
The diagonals of a square bisect each of the right
angles, hence
a = 90◦
2
= 45◦
(b)
EFGH is a rectangle
In triangle FGH, 40◦+ 90◦+ b = 180◦, since the
angles in a triangle add up to 180◦, from which
b = 50◦. Also, c = 40◦(alternate angles between
parallel lines EF and HG). (Alternatively, b and c
are complementary; i.e. add up to 90◦)
d = 90◦+ c (external angle of a triangle equals
the sum of the interior opposite angles), hence
d = 90◦+ 40◦= 130◦
(or
∠EFH = 50◦
and
d = 180◦−50◦= 130◦)
(c)
JKLM is a rhombus
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the interior
angles and the opposite internal angles are equal.
Thus, ∠JKM=∠MKL = ∠JMK = ∠LMK = 30◦,
hence, e = 30◦
In
triangle
KLM,
30◦+ ∠KLM + 30◦= 180◦
(the angles in a triangle add up to 180◦), hence,
∠KLM = 120◦. The diagonal JL bisects ∠KLM,
hence, f = 120◦
2
= 60◦
(d)
NOPQ is a parallelogram
g = 52◦since the opposite interior angles of a
parallelogram are equal.
In triangle NOQ, g + h + 65◦= 180◦(the angles
in a triangle add up to 180◦), from which
h = 180◦−65◦−52◦= 63◦
i = 65◦(alternate angles between parallel lines
NQ and OP).
j = 52◦+ i = 52◦+ 65◦= 117◦
(the
external
angle of a triangle equals the sum of the interior
opposite angles). (Alternatively, ∠PQO = h =
63◦; hence, j = 180◦−63◦= 117◦)
(e)
RSTU is a trapezium
35◦+ k = 75◦(external angle of a triangle equals
the sum of the interior opposite angles), hence,
k = 40◦
∠STR = 35◦(alternate angles between parallel
lines RU and ST). l + 35◦= 115◦(external angle
of a triangle equals the sum of the interior opposite
angles), hence, l = 115◦−35◦= 80◦

Problem 7.
A rectangular tray is 820mm long
and 400mm wide. Find its area in (a) mm2 (b) cm2
(c) m2
(a) Area of tray = length × width = 820 × 400
= 328000mm2
(b)
Since 1cm = 10mm,1cm2 = 1cm × 1cm
= 10mm × 10mm = 100mm2, or
1mm2 =
1
100cm2 = 0.01cm2
Hence, 328000mm2 = 328000 × 0.01cm2
= 3280cm2
(c)
Since 1m = 100cm,1m2 = 1m × 1m
= 100cm × 100cm = 10000cm2, or
1cm2 =

10000m2 = 0.0001m2

Chapter 26
The circle and its properties
Why it is important to understand: The circle and its properties
A circle is one of the fundamental shapes of geometry; it consists of all the points that are equidistant
from a central point. Knowledge of calculations involving circles is needed with crank mechanisms, with
determinations of latitude and longitude, with pendulums, and even in the design of paper clips. The
ﬂoodlit area at a football ground, the area an automatic garden sprayer sprays and the angle of lap of a
belt drive all rely on calculations involving the arc of a circle. The ability to handle calculations involving
circles and its properties is clearly essential in several branches of engineering design.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a circle
•
state some properties of a circle – including radius, circumference, diameter, semicircle, quadrant, tangent,
sector, chord, segment and arc
•
appreciate the angle in a semicircle is a right angle
•
deﬁne a radian, and change radians to degrees, and vice versa
•
determine arc length, area of a circle and area of a sector of a circle
•
state the equation of a circle
•
sketch a circle given its equation
26.1
Introduction
A circle is a plain ﬁgure enclosed by a curved line, every
point on which is equidistant from a point within, called
the centre.
In Chapter 25, worked problems on the areas of circles
and sectors were demonstrated. In this chapter, proper-
ties of circles are listed and arc lengths are calculated,
together with more practical examples on the areas of
sectors of circles. Finally, the equation of a circle is
explained.
26.2

the radius, r, of the circle (see OP in Fig. 26.1).

(b)
The boundary of a circle is called the circumfer-
ence, c
(c)
Any straight line passing through the centre and
touching the circumference at each end is called
the diameter, d (see QR in Fig. 26.1). Thus,
d = 2r
(d)
The ratio circumference
diameter
is a constant for any cir-
cle. This constant is denoted by the Greek letter π
(pronounced ‘pie’), where π = 3.14159, correct
to 5 decimal places (check with your calculator).
Hence, c
d = π or c = πd or c = 2πr
(e)
A semicircle is one half of a whole circle.
(f)
A quadrant is one quarter of a whole circle.
(g)
A tangent to a circle is a straight line which meets
the circle at one point only and does not cut the
circle when produced. AC in Fig. 26.1 is a tangent
to the circle since it touches the curve at point B
only. If radius OB is drawn, angle ABO is a right
angle.
(h)
The sectorofacircleisthepartofacirclebetween
radii (for example, the portion OXY of Fig. 26.2
is a sector). If a sector is less than a semicircle it is
called a minor sector; if greater than a semicircle
it is called a major sector.

(i)
The chord of a circle is any straight line which
divides the circle into two parts and is terminated
at each end by the circumference. ST, in Fig. 26.2,
is a chord.
(j)
Segment is the name given to the parts into which
a circle is divided by a chord.If the segment is less
than a semicircle it is called a minor segment (see
shaded area in Fig. 26.2).If the segment is greater
than a semicircle it is called a major segment
(see the un-shaded area in Fig. 26.2).
(k)
An arc is a portion of the circumference of a
circle. The distance SRT in Fig. 26.2 is called
a minor arc and the distance SXYT is called a
major arc.
(l)
The angle at the centre of a circle, subtended
by an arc, is double the angle at the circumfer-
ence subtended by the same arc. With reference

The equation of a circle
The simplest equation of a circle, centre at the origin
and radius r, is given by
x2 + y2 = r2
For example, Fig. 26.16 shows a circle x2 + y2 =9

and radius r, is given by
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2

The general equation of a circle is
x2 + y2 + 2ex + 2 f y + c = 0

Volumes and surface areas
of common solids
Why it is important to understand: Volumes and surface areas of common solids
There are many practical applications where volumes and surface areas of common solids are required.
Examples include determining capacities of oil, water, petrol and ﬁsh tanks, ventilation shafts and cooling
towers, determining volumes of blocks of metal, ball-bearings, boilers and buoys, and calculating the
cubic metres of concrete needed for a path. Finding the surface areas of loudspeaker diaphragms and
lampshades provide further practical examples. Understanding these calculations is essential for the
many practical applications in engineering, construction, architecture and science.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the SI unit of volume
•
calculate the volumes and surface areas of cuboids, cylinders, prisms, pyramids, cones and spheres
•
calculate volumes and surface areas of frusta of pyramids and cones
•
appreciatethat volumes of similar bodies are proportionalto the cubes of the correspondinglinear dimensions
27.1
Introduction
The volume of any solid is a measure of the space occu-
pied by the solid. Volume is measured in cubic units
such as mm3, cm3 and m3.
This chapter deals with ﬁnding volumes of common
solids; in engineering it is often important to be able to
calculatevolumeorcapacity to estimate,say,theamount
of liquid, such as water, oil or petrol, in different shaped
containers.
A prism is a solid with a constant cross-section and
with two ends parallel. The shape of the end is used to
describe the prism. For example, there are rectangular
prisms (called cuboids), triangular prisms and circular
prisms (called cylinders).
On completing this chapter you will be able to calculate
the volumes and surface areas of rectangular and other
prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones and spheres, together
with frusta of pyramids and cones. Volumes of similar
shapes are also considered.
27.2 Volumes and surface areas of
common shapes
27.2.1
Cuboids or rectangular prisms
A cuboid is a solid ﬁgure bounded by six rectangular
faces; all angles are right angles and opposite faces are
equal. A typical cuboid is shown in Fig. 27.1 with length
l, breadth b and height h.

l
Figure 27.1
Volume of cuboid = l × b × h
and
surface area = 2bh + 2hl + 2lb = 2(bh + hl + lb)
A cube is a square prism. If all the sides of a cube are x
then
Volume = x3 and surface area = 6x2
Problem 1.
A cuboid has dimensions of 12cm by
4cm by 3cm. Determine (a) its volume and (b) its
total surface area
The cuboid is similar to that in Fig. 27.1, with
l = 12cm,b = 4cm and h = 3cm.
(a)
Volume of cuboid= l × b × h = 12 × 4 × 3
= 144 cm3
(b)
Surface area = 2(bh + hl +lb)
= 2(4 × 3 + 3 × 12+ 12 × 4)
= 2(12 + 36 + 48)
= 2 × 96 = 192cm2
Problem 2.
An oil tank is the shape of a cube,
each edge being of length 1.5m. Determine (a) the
maximum capacity of the tank in m3 and litres and
(b) its total surface area ignoring input and output
oriﬁces
(a)
Volume of oil tank=volume of cube
= 1.5m× 1.5m × 1.5m
= 1.53m3 = 3.375 m3
1m3 = 100cm× 100cm × 100cm = 106 cm3.
Hence,
volume of tank = 3.375 × 106cm3
1litre = 1000cm3, hence oil tank capacity
= 3.375 × 106
1000
litres = 3375litres
(b)
Surface area of one side = 1.5m × 1.5m
= 2.25m2
A cube has six identical sides, hence
total surface area of oil tank = 6 × 2.25
= 13.5 m2
Problem 3.
A water tank is the shape of a
rectangular prism having length 2m, breadth 75cm
and height 500mm. Determine the capacity of the
tank in (a) m3 (b) cm3 (c) litres
Capacity means volume; when dealing with liquids, the
word capacity is usually used.
The water tank is similar in shape to that in Fig. 27.1,
with l = 2m,b = 75cm and h = 500mm.
(a)
Capacity of water tank = l × b × h. To use this for-
mula, all dimensions must be in the same units.
Thus, l = 2m,b = 0.75m and h = 0.5m (since
1m = 100cm = 1000mm). Hence,
capacity of tank = 2 × 0.75 × 0.5 = 0.75m3
(b)
1m3 = 1m × 1m × 1m
= 100cm× 100cm × 100cm
i.e. 1 m3= 1000000 =106 cm3. Hence,
capacity = 0.75m3 = 0.75 × 106cm3
= 750000cm3
(c)
1litre = 1000cm3. Hence,
750000cm3 = 750,000
1000
= 750litres

27.5 Volumes and surface areas of
frusta of pyramids and cones
The frustum of a pyramid or cone is the portion remain-
ing when a part containing the vertex is cut off by a
plane parallel to the base.
The volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone is given
by the volume of the whole pyramid or cone minus the
volume of the small pyramid or cone cut off.
The surface area of the sides of a frustum of a pyra-
mid or cone is given by the surface area of the whole
pyramid or cone minus the surface area of the small
pyramid or cone cut off. This gives the lateral surface
area of the frustum. If the total surface area of the frus-
tum is required then the surface area of the two parallel
ends are added to the lateral surface area.
There is an alternative method for ﬁnding the volume
and surface area of a frustum of a cone. With reference

Find the total surface area of the
frustum of the cone in Problem 24.
(i)
Method 1
Curved surface area of frustum = curved surface
area of large cone −curved surface area of small
cone cut off.
From Fig. 27.22, using Pythagoras’ theorem,
AB2 = AQ2 + BQ2
from which AB =
!
10.82 + 3.02"
= 11.21cm
and
AD2 = AP2 + DP2
from which AD =
!

= 7.47cm
Curved surface area of large cone = πrl
= π(BQ)(AB) = π(3.0)(11.21)
= 105.65cm2
and curved surface area of small cone
= π(DP)(AD) = π(2.0)(7.47) = 46.94cm2
Hence, curved surface area of frustum
= 105.65 −46.94
= 58.71cm2
Total surface area of frustum
= curved surface area
+ area of two circular ends
= 58.71 + π(2.0)2 + π(3.0)2
= 58.71 + 12.57 + 28.27 = 99.6cm2
(ii)
Method 2
From page 285, total surface area of frustum
= πl(R +r) + πr2 + π R2
where l = BD = 11.21 −7.47 = 3.74cm,
R = 3.0cm and r = 2.0cm.
Hence, total surface area of frustum
= π(3.74)(3.0 + 2.0) + π(2.0)2 + π(3.0)2
= 99.6cm2

Chapter 28
Irregular areas and volumes
and mean values
Why it is important to understand: Irregular areas and volumes and mean values of waveforms
Surveyors, farmers and landscapers often need to determine the area of irregularly shaped pieces of land
to work with the land properly. There are many applications in business, economics and the sciences,
including all aspects of engineering, where ﬁnding the areas of irregular shapes, the volumes of solids,
and the lengths of irregular shaped curves are important applications. Typical earthworks include roads,
railway beds, causeways, dams and canals. Other common earthworks are land grading to reconﬁgurethe
topography of a site, or to stabilise slopes. Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of geotechnical
engineering (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in
the cuts match those of the ﬁlls, while minimising the distance of movement. Simpson’s rule is a staple of
scientiﬁc data analysis and engineering; it is widely used, for example, by Naval architects to numerically
determine hull offsets and cross-sectional areas to determine volumes and centroids of ships or lifeboats.
There are therefore plenty of examples where irregular areas and volumes need to be determined by
engineers.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
use the trapezoidal rule to determine irregular areas
•
use the mid-ordinate rule to determine irregular areas
•
use Simpson’s rule to determine irregular areas
•
estimate the volume of irregular solids
•
determine the mean values of waveforms
28.1
Areas of irregular figures
Areas of irregular plane surfaces may be approximately
determined by using
(a)
a planimeter,
(b)
the trapezoidal rule,
(c)
the mid-ordinate rule, or
(d)
Simpson’s rule.
Such methods may be used by, for example, engineers
estimating areas of indicatordiagrams of steam engines,
surveyors estimating areas of plots of land or naval
architects estimating areas of water planes or transverse
sections of ships.

Irregular areas and volumes and mean values
291
(a)
A planimeter is an instrument for directly mea-
suring small areas bounded by an irregular curve.
There are many different kinds of planimeters but
all operate in a similar way. A pointer on the
planimeter is used to trace around the boundary
of the shape. This induces a movement in another
part of the instrument and a reading of this is used
to establish the area of the shape.

Vectors
Why it is important to understand: Vectors
Vectors are an important part of the language of science, mathematics and engineering. They are used to
discuss multivariable calculus, electrical circuits with oscillating currents, stress and strain in structures
and materials, and ﬂows of atmospheres and ﬂuids, and they have many other applications. Resolving a
vector into components is a precursor to computing things with or about a vector quantity. Because posi-
tion, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum and angular momentum are all vector quantities, resolving
vectors into components is a most important skill required in any engineering studies.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
distinguish between scalars and vectors
•
recognise how vectors are represented
•
add vectors using the nose-to-tail method
•
add vectors using the parallelogram method
•
resolve vectors into their horizontal and vertical components
•
add vectors by calculation using horizontal and vertical components
•
perform vector subtraction
•
understand relative velocity
•
understand i, j, k notation
29.1
Introduction
This chapter initially explains the difference between
scalar and vector quantities and shows how a vector is
drawn and represented.
Any object that is acted upon by an external force
will respond to that force by moving in the line of
the force. However, if two or more forces act simul-
taneously, the result is more difﬁcult to predict; the
ability to add two or more vectors then becomes
important.
This chapter thus shows how vectors are added and sub-
tracted, both by drawing and by calculation, and how
ﬁnding the resultant of two or more vectors has many
uses in engineering. (Resultant means the single vector
which would have the same effect as the individual vec-
tors.) Relative velocities and vector i, j,k notation are
also brieﬂy explained.
29.2
Scalars and vectors
The time taken to ﬁll a water tank may be measured
as, say, 50s. Similarly, the temperature in a room may
be measured as, say, 16◦C or the mass of a bear-
ing may be measured as, say, 3kg. Quantities such
as time, temperature and mass are entirely deﬁned by
a numerical value and are called scalars or scalar
quantities.
Basic Engineering Mathematics. 978-0-415-66278-9, © 2014 John Bird. Published by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.

Vectors
301
Not all quantities are like this. Some are deﬁned by
more than just size; some also have direction. For
example, the velocity of a car may be 90km/h due
west, a force of 20N may act vertically downwards,
or an acceleration of 10m/s2 may act at 50◦to the
horizontal.
Quantities such as velocity, force and acceleration,
which have both a magnitude and a direction, are
called vectors.

Drawing a vector
A vector quantity can be represented graphically by a
line, drawn so that
(a)
the length of the line denotes the magnitude of the
quantity, and
(b)
the direction of the line denotes the direction in
which the vector quantity acts.
An arrow is used to denote the sense, or direction, of the
vector.
The arrow end of a vector is called the ‘nose’ and the
other end the ‘tail’. For example, a force of 9N acting at
45◦to the horizontal is shown in Fig. 29.1. Note that an
angle of +45◦is drawn from the horizontal and moves
anticlockwise.

denotes the sense of direction, where A is the
starting point and B the end point of the vector.

(d)

The force of 9N at 45◦shown in Fig. 29.1 may be
represented as

0a
or 0a
The magnitude of the force is 0a
Similarly, the velocity of 20m/s at −60◦shown in
Fig. 29.2 may be represented as
0b or −→
0b
or 0b
The magnitude of the velocity is 0b
In this chapter a vector quantity is denoted by bold

Addition of vectors by drawing
Adding two or more vectors by drawing assumes that
a ruler, pencil and protractor are available. Results
obtained by drawing are naturally not as accurate as
those obtained by calculation.
(a)
Nose-to-tail method
Two force vectors, F1 and F2, are shown in
Fig. 29.3. When an object is subjected to more
than one force, the resultant of the forces is found
by the addition of vectors.

angle θ to the horizontal, shown as ab

When more than 2 vectors are being added the nose-to-

The resultant velocity is given by length 0r and

Worked examples 1 to 3 have demonstrated how vectors
are added to determine their resultant and their direc-
tion. However, drawing to scale is time-consuming and
not highlyaccurate. The followingsections demonstrate
how to determine resultant vectors by calculation using
horizontal and vertical components and, where possible,
by Pythagoras’ theorem.
29.5 Resolving vectors into horizontal
and vertical components
A force vector F is shown in Fig. 29.13 at angle θ to the
horizontal. Such a vector can be resolved into two com-
ponents such that the vector addition of the components
is equal to the original vector.

The two components usually taken are a horizontal
component and a vertical component. If a right-angled
triangle is constructed as shown in Fig. 29.14, 0a is
called the horizontal component of F and ab is called
the vertical component of F.

A method of adding two vectors together is to use
horizontal and vertical components.
The horizontal component of force F1 is F1 cosθ1 and
the horizontal component of force F2 is F2 cosθ2. The
total horizontal component of the two forces,
H = F1 cosθ1 + F2 cosθ2
The vertical component of force F1 is F1 sinθ1 and the
vertical component of force F2 is F2 sinθ2. The total
vertical component of the two forces,
V = F1 sinθ1 + F2 sinθ2
Since we have H and V , the resultant of F1 and F2
is obtained by using the theorem of Pythagoras. From

The vertical componentof the 15N force is 15sin0◦and
the vertical component of the 10N force is 10sin90◦.

This is, of course, a special case. Pythagoras can only

Methods of adding
alternating waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Methods of adding alternating waveforms
In electrical engineering, a phasor is a rotating vector representing a quantity such as an alternating
current or voltage that varies sinusoidally. Sometimes it is necessary when studying sinusoidal quantities
to add together two alternating waveforms, for example in an a.c. series circuit, that are not in phase with
each other. Electrical engineers, electronics engineers, electronic engineering technicians and aircraft
engineers all use phasor diagrams to visualise complex constants and variables. So, given oscillations to
add and subtract, the required rotating vectors are constructed, called a phasor diagram, and graphically
the resulting sum and/or difference oscillations are added or calculated. Phasors may be used to analyse
the behaviour of electrical and mechanical systems that have reached a kind of equilibrium called sinu-
soidal steady state. Hence, discovering different methods of combining sinusoidal waveforms is of some
importance in certain areas of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine the resultant of two phasors by graph plotting
•
determine the resultant of two or more phasors by drawing
•
determine the resultant of two phasors by the sine and cosine rules
•
determine the resultant of two or more phasors by horizontal and vertical components
30.1 Combining two periodic
functions
There are a number of instances in engineering and sci-
ence where waveforms have to be combined and where
it is required to determine the single phasor (called
the resultant) that could replace two or more separate
phasors. Uses are found in electrical alternating cur-
rent theory, in mechanical vibrations, in the addition of
forces and with sound waves.
There are a number of methods of determining the
resultant waveform. These include
(a)
drawing the waveforms and adding graphically
(b)
drawing the phasors and measuring the resultant
(c)
using the cosine and sine rules
(d)
using horizontal and vertical components.

Plotting periodic functions
This may be achieved by sketching the separate func-
tions on the same axes and then adding (or subtracting)
ordinates at regular intervals. This is demonstrated in
the following worked problems.
Problem 1.
Plot the graph of y1 = 3sin A from
A = 0◦to A = 360◦. On the same axes plot
y2 = 2cos A. By adding ordinates, plot
yR = 3sin A + 2cos A and obtain a sinusoidal
expression for this resultant waveform
y1 = 3sin A and y2 = 2cos A are shown plotted in
Fig. 30.1. Ordinates may be added at, say, 15◦intervals.
For example,
at 0◦, y1 + y2 = 0 + 2 = 2
at 15◦, y1 + y2 = 0.78 + 1.93 = 2.71
at 120◦, y1 + y2 = 2.60 + −1 = 1.6
at
210◦, y1 + y2 = −1.50 −1.73 = −3.23,
and
so on.

The resultant waveform, shown by the broken line, has
the same period, i.e. 360◦, and thus the same frequency
as the single phasors. The maximum value, or ampli-
tude, of the resultant is 3.6. The resultant waveform
leads y1 = 3sin A by 34◦or 34 × π
180rad = 0.593rad.
The sinusoidal expression for the resultant waveform is
yR = 3.6sin(A + 34◦) or yR = 3.6sin(A + 0.593)
Problem 2.
Plot the graphs of y1 = 4sinωt and
y2 = 3sin(ωt −π/3) on the same axes, over one
cycle. By adding ordinates at intervals plot
yR = y1 + y2 and obtain a sinusoidal expression for
the resultant waveform

ted in Fig. 30.2.

y2 is subtracted from y1. For example,

315
at 0◦, y1 −y2 = 0 −(−2.6) = +2.6
at 30◦, y1 −y2 = 2 −(−1.5) = +3.5
at 150◦, y1 −y2 = 2 −3 = −1, and so on.
The amplitude, or peak, value of the resultant (shown by
the broken line) is 3.6 and it leads y1 by 45◦or 0.79 rad.
Hence,

30.3 Determining resultant phasors
by drawing
The resultant of two periodic functions may be found
from their relative positions when the time is zero.
For example, if y1 = 4sinωt and y2 = 3sin(ωt −π/3)
then each may be represented as phasors as shown in
Fig. 30.5, y1 being 4 units long and drawn horizontally
and y2 being 3 units long, lagging y1 by π/3 radians or
60◦. To determine the resultant of y1 + y2, y1 is drawn
horizontally as shown in Fig. 30.6 and y2 is joined to
the end of y1 at 60◦to the horizontal. The resultant
is given by yR. This is the same as the diagonal of a
parallelogram that is shown completed in Fig. 30.7.

30.4 Determining resultant phasors
by the sine and cosine rules
As stated earlier, the resultant of two periodic func-
tions may be found from their relative positions when
the time is zero. For example, if y1 = 5sinωt and y2 =
4sin(ωt −π/6) then each may be represented by pha-
sors as shown in Fig. 30.12, y1 being 5 units long and
drawn horizontally and y2 being 4 units long, lagging
y1 by π/6 radians or 30◦. To determine the resultant of
y1 + y2, y1 is drawn horizontally as shown in Fig. 30.13
and y2 is joined to the end of y1 at π/6 radians; i.e. 30◦
to the horizontal. The resultant is given by yR
Using the cosine rule on triangle 0ab of Fig. 30.13 gives
y2
R = 52 + 42 −[2(5)(4)cos150◦]
= 25 + 16 −(−34.641) = 75.641

Hence, yR = y1 + y2 = 5sinωt + 4sin(ωt −π/6)

Given y1 = 2sinωt and

When time t = 0, the position of phasors y1 and y2 are
as shown in Fig. 30.14(a). To obtain the resultant, y1 is
drawn horizontally, 2 units long, and y2 is drawn 3 units
long at an angle of π/4rad or 45◦and joined to the end
of y1 as shown in Fig. 30.14(b).
From Fig. 30.14(b), and using the cosine rule,

Presentation of
statistical data
Why it is important to understand: Presentation of statistical data
Statistics is the study of the collection, organisation, analysis, and interpretation of data. It deals with all
aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences,
engineering, government and business. Statistical methods can be used for summarising or describing a
collection of data. Engineering statistics combines engineering and statistics. Design of experiments is a
methodology for formulating scientiﬁc and engineering problems using statistical models. Quality control
and process control use statistics as a tool to manage conformance to speciﬁcations of manufacturing
processes and their products. Time and methods engineering use statistics to study repetitive operations
in manufacturing in order to set standards and ﬁnd optimum manufacturing procedures. Reliability
engineering measures the ability of a system to perform for its intended function (and time) and has tools
for improving performance. Probabilistic design involves the use of probability in product and system
design. System identiﬁcation uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems
from measured data. System identiﬁcation also includes the optimal design of experiments for efﬁciently
generating informative data for ﬁtting such models. This chapter introduces the presentation of statistical
data.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
distinguish between discrete and continuous data
•
present data diagrammatically – pictograms, horizontal and vertical bar charts, percentage component bar
charts, pie diagrams
•
produce a tally diagram for a set of data
•
form a frequency distribution from a tally diagram
•
construct a histogram from a frequency distribution
•
construct a frequency polygon from a frequency distribution
•
produce a cumulative frequency distribution from a set of grouped data
•
construct an ogive from a cumulative frequency distribution

31.1
Some statistical terminology
31.1.1
Discrete and continuous data
Data are obtained largely by two methods:
(a)
By counting – for example, the number of stamps
sold by a post ofﬁce in equal periods of time.
(b)
By measurement – for example, the heights of a
group of people.
When data are obtained by counting and only whole
numbers are possible, the data are called discrete. Mea-
sured data can have any value within certain limits and
are called continuous.
Problem 1.
Data are obtained on the topics given
below. State whether they are discrete or continuous
data.
(a)
The number of days on which rain falls in a
month for each month of the year.
(b)
The mileage travelled by each of a number of
salesmen.
(c)
The time that each of a batch of similar
batteries lasts.
(d)
The amount of money spent by each of several
families on food.
(a)
The number of days on which rain falls in a given
month must be an integer value and is obtained by
counting the number of days. Hence, these data
are discrete.
(b)
A salesman can travel any number of miles
(and parts of a mile) between certain limits and
these data are measured. Hence, the data are
continuous.
(c)
The time that a battery lasts is measured and
can have any value between certain limits. Hence,
these data are continuous.
(d)
The amount of money spent on food can only be
expressed correct to the nearest pence, the amount
being counted. Hence, these data are discrete.
Now try the following Practice Exercise
Practice Exercise 122
Discrete and
continuous data (answers on page 435)
In the following problems,state whether data relat-
ing to the topics given are discrete or continuous.
1.
(a) The amount of petrol produced daily, for
each of 31 days, by a reﬁnery.
(b) The amount of coal produced daily by
each of 15 miners.
(c) The number of bottles of milk delivered
daily by each of 20 milkmen.
(d) Thesizeof10samplesofrivetsproduced
by a machine.
2.
(a) The number of people visiting an exhi-
bition on each of 5 days.
(b) The time taken by each of 12 athletes to
run 100 metres.
(c) The value of stamps sold in a day by each
of 20 post ofﬁces.
(d) The number of defective items produced
in each of 10 one-hour periods by a
machine.
31.1.2
Further statistical terminology
A set is a group of data and an individual value within
the set is called a member of the set. Thus, if the
masses of ﬁve people are measured correct to the near-
est 0.1kilogram and are found to be 53.1kg, 59.4kg,
62.1kg, 77.8kg and 64.4kg then the set of masses in
kilograms for these ﬁve people is
{53.1,59.4,62.1,77.8,64.4}
and one of the members of the set is 59.4
A set containing all the members is called a population.
Some members selected at random from a population
are called a sample. Thus, all car registration numbers
form a population but the registration numbers of, say,
20 cars taken at random throughout the country are a
sample drawn from that population.
The number of times that the value of a member
occurs in a set is called the frequency of that mem-
ber. Thus, in the set {2,3,4,5,4,2,4,7,9}, member 4

has a frequency of three, member 2 has a frequency of
2 and the other members have a frequency of one.
The relative frequency with which any member of a
set occurs is given by the ratio
frequency of member
total frequency of all members
For the set {2,3,5,4,7,5,6,2,8}, the relative fre-
quency of member 5 is 2
9. Often, relative frequency is
expressed as a percentage and the percentage relative
frequency is
(relative frequency× 100)%
31.2
Presentation of ungrouped data
Ungrouped data can be presented diagrammatically in
several ways and these include
(a)
pictograms, in which pictorial symbols are used
to represent quantities (see Problem 2),
(b)
horizontal bar charts, having data represented
by equally spaced horizontal rectangles (see Prob-
lem 3), and
(c)
vertical bar charts, in which data are repre-
sented by equally spaced vertical rectangles (see
Problem 4).
Trends in ungrouped data over equal periods of time
can be presented diagrammatically by a percent-
age component bar chart. In such a chart, equally
spaced rectangles of any width, but whose height cor-
responds to 100%, are constructed. The rectangles
are then subdivided into values corresponding to the
percentage relative frequencies of the members (see
Problem 5).
A pie diagram is used to show diagrammatically the
parts making up the whole. In a pie diagram, the area of
a circle represents the whole and the areas of the sectors
of the circle are made proportional to the parts which
make up the whole (see Problem 6).
Problem 2.

shown in Fig. 31.3.

Problem 6.
The retail price of a product costing
£2 is made up as follows: materials 10p, labour
20p, research and development 40p, overheads
70p, proﬁt 60p. Present these data on a pie diagram

330
Basic Engineering Mathematics
A circle of any radius is drawn. The area of the circle
represents the whole, which in this case is £2. The circle
is subdivided into sectors so that the areas of the sectors
are proportional to the parts; i.e. the parts which make
up the total retail price. For the area of a sector to be
proportionalto a part, the angle at the centre of the circle
must be proportional to that part. The whole, £2 or 200p,
corresponds to 360◦. Therefore,
10p corresponds to 360× 10
200 degrees, i.e. 18◦
20p corresponds to 360× 20
200 degrees, i.e. 36◦
and so on, giving the angles at the centre of the circle
for the parts of the retail price as 18◦,36◦,72◦,126◦and
108◦, respectively.

Presentation of grouped data
When the number of members in a set is small, say ten or
less, the data can be represented diagrammatically with-
out further analysis, by means of pictograms, bar charts,
percentage components bar charts or pie diagrams (as
shown in Section 31.2).
For sets having more than ten members, those members
having similar values are grouped together in classes
to form a frequency distribution. To assist in accu-
rately counting members in the various classes, a tally
diagram is used (see Problems 8 and 12).
A frequency distribution is merely a table showing
classes and their corresponding frequencies (see Prob-
lems 8 and 12). The new set of values obtained by
forming a frequency distribution is called grouped
data. The terms used in connection with grouped data
are shown in Fig. 31.6(a). The size or range of a class
is given by the upper class boundary value minus
the lower class boundary value and in Fig. 31.6(b)
is 7.65−7.35; i.e. 0.30. The class interval for the class

shown in Fig.31.6(b)is7.4 to 7.6 and theclassmid-point
value is given by

One of the principal ways of presenting grouped data
diagrammatically is to use a histogram, in which the
areas of vertical, adjacent rectangles are made propor-
tional to frequencies of the classes (see Problem 9).
When class intervals are equal, the heights of the rect-
angles of a histogram are equal to the frequencies of
the classes. For histograms having unequal class inter-
vals, the area must be proportional to the frequency.
Hence, if the class interval of class A is twice the
class interval of class B, then for equal frequencies the
height of the rectangle representing A is half that of B
(see Problem 11).
Another method of presenting grouped data diagram-
matically is to use a frequency polygon, which is the
graph produced by plotting frequencyagainst class mid-
point values and joining the co-ordinates with straight
lines (see Problem 12).
A cumulative frequency distribution is a table show-
ing the cumulative frequency for each value of upper
class boundary. The cumulative frequency for a particu-
lar value of upper class boundary is obtained by adding
the frequency of the class to the sum of the previous fre-
quencies. A cumulative frequencydistribution is formed
in Problem 13.
The curve obtained by joining the co-ordinates
of cumulative frequency (vertically) against upper
class boundary (horizontally) is called an ogive
or
a
cumulative
frequency
distribution
curve
(see Problem 13).
Problem 8.
The data given below refer to the gain
of each of a batch of 40 transistors, expressed
correct to the nearest whole number. Form a
frequency distribution for these data having seven
classes
81 83 87 74 76 89 82 84
86 76 77 71 86 85 87 88
84 81 80 81 73 89 82 79
81 79 78 80 85 77 84 78
83 79 80 83 82 79 80 77
The range of the data is the value obtained by taking
the value of the smallest member from that of the largest
member. Inspection of the set of data shows that range
= 89 −71 = 18. The size of each class is given approx-
imately by the range divided by the number of classes.
Since seven classes are required, the size of each class is
18 ÷ 7; that is, approximately 3. To achieve seven equal
classes spanning a range of values from 71 to 89, the
class intervals are selected as 70–72, 73–75, and so on.
To assist with accurately determining the number in
each class, a tally diagram is produced, as shown in
Table 31.1(a). This is obtained by listing the classes
in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the
40 members of the set in turn and allocating them to
the appropriate classes by putting ‘1’s in the appropri-
ate rows. Every ﬁfth ‘1’ allocated to a particular row is
shown as an oblique line crossing the four previous ‘1’s,
to help with ﬁnal counting.

Construct a histogram for the data

The histogram is shown in Fig. 31.7. The width of
the rectangles corresponds to the upper class bound-
ary values minus the lower class boundary values and
the heights of the rectangles correspond to the class fre-
quencies. The easiest way to draw a histogram is to mark
the class mid-point values on the horizontal scale and
draw the rectangles symmetrically about the appropriate
class mid-point values and touching one another.

Inspection of the set given shows that the major-
ity of the members of the set lie between £80
and £110 and that there is a much smaller num-
ber of extreme values ranging from £30 to £170. If
equal class intervals are selected, the frequency dis-
tribution obtained does not give as much informa-
tion as one with unequal class intervals. Since the
majority of the members lie between £80 and £100,
the class intervals in this range are selected to be
smaller than those outside of this range. There is no
unique solution and one possible solution is shown in
Table 31.2.

When dealing with unequal class intervals, the his-

the heights) of the rectangles are proportional to the
frequencies of the classes. The data given are shown
in columns 1 and 2 of Table 31.3. Columns 3 and 4
give the upper and lower class boundaries, respectively.
In column 5, the class ranges (i.e. upper class bound-
ary minus lower class boundary values) are listed. The
heights of the rectangles are proportional to the ratio

The masses of 50 ingots in
kilograms are measured correct to the nearest 0.1kg
and the results are as shown below. Produce a
frequency distribution having about seven classes
for these data and then present the grouped data as a
frequency polygon and a histogram

The range of the data is the member having the largest
value minus the member having the smallest value.
Inspection of the set of data shows that
range = 9.1 −7.1 = 2.0
The size of each class is given approximately by
range
number of classes
Since about seven classes are required, the size of each
classis2.0 ÷ 7,i.e.approximately 0.3,and thusthe class
limits are selected as 7.1 to 7.3, 7.4 to 7.6, 7.7 to 7.9,
and so on. The class mid-point for the 7.1 to 7.3 class is
7.35 + 7.05

i.e. 7.2
the class mid-point for the 7.4 to 7.6 class is
7.65 + 7.35

i.e. 7.5
and so on.
To assist with accurately determining the number in
each class, a tally diagram is produced as shown
in Table 31.4. This is obtained by listing the classes
in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the
50 members of the set of data in turn and allocating it
to the appropriate class by putting a ‘1’ in the appropri-
ate row. Each ﬁfth ‘1’ allocated to a particular row is
marked as an oblique line to help with ﬁnal counting.
A frequency distribution for the data is shown in Table
31.5 and lists classes and their corresponding frequen-
cies. Class mid-points are also shown in this table since
they are used when constructing the frequency polygon
and histogram.

A cumulative frequency distribution is a table giving
values of cumulative frequency for the values of upper
class boundaries and is shown in Table 31.6. Columns
1 and 2 show the classes and their frequencies. Column
3 lists the upper class boundary values for the classes
given in column 1. Column 4 gives the cumulative fre-
quency values for all frequencies less than the upper
class boundary values given in column 3. Thus, for
example, for the 7.7 to 7.9 class shown in row 3, the
cumulative frequency value is the sum of all frequen-
cies having values of less than 7.95, i.e. 3 + 5 + 9 = 17,

Chapter 32
Mean, median, mode and
standard deviation
Why it is important to understand: Mean, median, mode and standard deviation
Statistics is a ﬁeld of mathematics that pertains to data analysis. In many real-life situations, it is help-
ful to describe data by a single number that is most representative of the entire collection of numbers.
Such a number is called a measure of central tendency; the most commonly used measures are mean,
median, mode and standard deviation, the latter being the average distance between the actual data and
the mean. Statistics is important in the ﬁeld of engineering since it provides tools to analyse collected
data. For example, a chemical engineer may wish to analyse temperature measurements from a mix-
ing tank. Statistical methods can be used to determine how reliable and reproducible the temperature
measurements are, how much the temperature varies within the data set, what future temperatures of
the tank may be, and how conﬁdent the engineer can be in the temperature measurements made. When
performing statistical analysis on a set of data, the mean, median, mode and standard deviation are all
helpful values to calculate; this chapter explains how to determine these measures of central tendency.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine the mean, median and mode for a set of ungrouped data
•
determine the mean, median and mode for a set of grouped data
•
draw a histogram from a set of grouped data
•
determine the mean, median and mode from a histogram
•
calculate the standard deviation from a set of ungrouped data
•
calculate the standard deviation from a set of grouped data
•
determine the quartile values from an ogive
•
determine quartile, decile and percentile values from a set of data
32.1
Measures of central tendency
A single value, which is representativeof a set of values,
may be used to give an indication of the general size of
the members in a set, the word ‘average’ often being
used to indicate the single value. The statistical term
used for ‘average’ is the ‘arithmetic mean’ or just the
‘mean’.
Other measures of central tendency may be used and
these include the median and the modal values.

32.2 Mean, median and mode for
discrete data
32.2.1
Mean
The arithmetic mean value is foundby addingtogether
the values of the members of a set and dividing by the
number of members in the set. Thus, the mean of the set
of numbers {4, 5, 6, 9} is
4 + 5 + 6 + 9
4
i.e. 6
In general, the mean of the set {x1,x2,x3,...xn} is
x = x1 + x2 + x3 + ··· + xn
n
written as
%x
n
where % is the Greek letter ‘sigma’ and means ‘the sum
of ’ and x (called x-bar) is used to signify a mean value.
32.2.2
Median
The median value often gives a better indication of the
general size of a set containing extreme values. The set
{7, 5, 74, 10} has a mean value of 24, which is not really
representativeof any of the values of the members of the
set. The median value is obtained by
(a)
ranking the set in ascending order of magnitude,
and
(b)
selecting the value of the middle member for sets
containing an odd number of members or ﬁnding
the value of the mean of the two middle members
for sets containing an even number of members.
For example, the set {7, 5, 74, 10} is ranked as
{5, 7, 10, 74} and, since it contains an even number
of members (four in this case), the mean of 7 and 10 is
taken, giving a median value of 8.5. Similarly, the set
{3, 81, 15, 7, 14} is ranked as {3, 7, 14, 15, 81} and
the median value is the value of the middle member,
i.e. 14
32.2.3
Mode
The modal value, or mode, is the most commonly
occurring value in a set. If two values occur with
the same frequency, the set is ‘bi-modal’. The set
{5, 6, 8, 2, 5, 4, 6, 5, 3} has a modal value of 5, since the
member having a value of 5 occurs the most, i.e. three
times.
Problem 1.
Determine the mean, median and
mode for the set {2, 3, 7, 5, 5, 13, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3, 4, 3}
The mean value is obtained by adding together the
values of the members of the set and dividing by the
number of members in the set. Thus,
mean value, x
= 2 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 13 + 1 + 7 + 4+ 8 + 3 + 4+ 3
13
= 65
13 = 5
To obtain the median value the set is ranked, that is,
placed in ascending order of magnitude, and since the
set contains an odd number of members the value of the
middle member is the median value. Ranking the set
gives {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 13}. The middle
term is the seventh member; i.e. 4. Thus, the median
value is 4
The modal value is the value of the most commonly
occurring member and is 3, which occurs three times,
all other members only occurring once or twice.
Problem 2.
The following set of data refers to the
amount of money in £s taken by a news vendor for
6 days. Determine the mean, median and modal
values of the set
{27.90, 34.70, 54.40, 18.92, 47.60, 39.68}
Mean value
= 27.90 + 34.70 + 54.40 + 18.92 + 47.60 + 39.68
6
= £37.20
The ranked set is
{18.92, 27.90, 34.70, 39.68, 47.60, 54.40}
Since the set has an even number of members, the mean
of the middle two members is taken to give the median
value; i.e.
median value = 34.70 + 39.68
2
= £37.19
Since no two members have the same value, this set has
no mode.

32.3 Mean, median and mode for
grouped data
The mean value for a set of grouped data is found by
determiningthesumofthe(frequency×classmid-point
values) and dividing by the sum of the frequencies; i.e.
mean value, x = f 1x1 + f 2x2 + ···f nxn
f 1 + f 2 + ··· + f n
=
%( fx)
% f
where f is the frequency of the class having a mid-point
value of x, and so on.

The class mid-point/frequency values are 20.7 3,
21.2 10, 21.7 11, 22.2 13, 22.7 9 and 23.2 2
For grouped data, the mean value is given by
x =
%( f x)
% f
where f is the class frequency and x is the class mid-
point value. Hence mean value,
(3 × 20.7) + (10 × 21.2) + (11 × 21.7)
x = +(13 × 22.2) + (9 × 22.7) + (2 × 23.2)
48
= 1052.1
48
= 21.919...
i.e. the mean value is 21.9 ohms, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
32.3.1
Histograms
The mean, median and modal values for grouped data
may be determined from a histogram. In a histogram,
frequency values are represented vertically and variable
valueshorizontally.Themean valueisgivenby thevalue
of the variable corresponding to a vertical line drawn
throughthe centroid of the histogram. The median value
is obtained by selecting a variable value such that the
area of the histogram to the left of a vertical line drawn
through the selected variablevalue is equal to the area of
the histogram on the right of the line. The modal value
is the variable value obtained by dividing the width of
the highest rectangle in the histogram in proportion to
the heights of the adjacent rectangles. The method of
determining the mean, median and modal values from
a histogram is shown in Problem 4.

assemble a device is measured 50 times and the
results are as shown. Draw a histogram depicting

any arbitrary axis, say YY shown at a time of 14 min-
utes, the position of the horizontal value of the centroid
can be obtained from the relationship AM = %(am),
where A is the area of the histogram, M is the hor-
izontal distance of the centroid from the axis YY, a
is the area of a rectangle of the histogram and m is
the distance of the centroid of the rectangle from YY.
The areas of the individual rectangles are shown circled
on the histogram giving a total area of 100 square
units. The positions,m, of the centroids of the individual
rectangles are 1,3,5,... units from YY. Thus
100M = (10 × 1) + (16 × 3) + (32× 5) + (24 × 7)
+ (12 × 9) + (6 × 11)
i.e. M = 560
100 = 5.6 units from YY
Thus, the position of the mean with reference to the
time scale is 14 + 5.6, i.e. 19.6 minutes.
The median is the value of time correspondingto a verti-
cal line dividing the total area of the histogram into two
equal parts. The total area is 100 square units, hence the
vertical line must be drawn to give 50 units of area on
each side. To achieve this with reference to Fig. 32.1,
rectangle ABFE must be split so that 50 −(10 + 16)
units of area lie on one side and 50−(24 + 12 + 6) units
of area lie on the other. This shows that the area of ABFE
is split so that 24 units of area lie to the left of the line and
8 units of area lie to the right; i.e. the vertical line must
pass through 19.5 minutes. Thus, the median value of
the distribution is 19.5 minutes.
The mode is obtained by dividing the line AB, which
is the height of the highest rectangle, proportionally to
the heights of the adjacent rectangles. With reference
to Fig. 32.1, this is achieved by joining AC and BD
and drawing a vertical line through the point of inter-
section of these two lines. This gives the mode of the
distribution, which is 19.3 minutes.

where x is a member of the set, x is the mean value of

Quartiles, deciles and percentiles
Other measures of dispersion which are sometimes
used are the quartile, decile and percentile values. The
quartile values of a set of discrete data are obtained by
selecting the values of members which divide the set
into four equal parts. Thus, for the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 14, 17} there are 11 members and the values
of the members dividing the set into four equal parts
are 4, 7 and 13. These values are signiﬁed by Q1, Q2
and Q3 and called the ﬁrst, second and third quartile
values, respectively. It can be seen that the second quar-
tile value, Q2, is the value of the middle member and
hence is the median value of the set.
For groupeddata the ogive may be used to determine the
quartile values. In this case, points are selected on the
vertical cumulative frequency values of the ogive, such
that they divide the total value of cumulative frequency
into four equal parts. Horizontal lines are drawn from
these values to cut the ogive. The values of the variable
corresponding to these cutting points on the ogive give
the quartile values (see Problem 7).
When a set contains a large number of members, the set
can be split into ten parts, each containing an equal num-
ber of members. These ten parts are then called deciles.
For sets containing a very large number of members, the
set may be split into one hundred parts, each contain-
ing an equal number of members. One of these parts is
called a percentile.

Chapter 33
Probability
Why it is important to understand: Probability
Engineers deal with uncertainty in their work, often with precision and analysis, and probability theory is
widely used to model systems in engineering and scientiﬁc applications. There are a number of examples
of where probability is used in engineering. For example, with electronic circuits, scaling down the power
and energy of such circuits reduces the reliability and predictability of many individual elements, but the
circuits must nevertheless be engineered so that the overall circuit is reliable. Centres for disease control
need to decide whether to institute massive vaccination or other preventative measures in the face of
globally threatening, possibly mutating diseases in humans and animals. System designers must weigh
the costs and beneﬁts of measures for reliability and security, such as levels of backups and ﬁrewalls, in
the face of uncertainty about threats from equipment failures or malicious attackers. Models incorpo-
rating probability theory have been developed and are continuously being improved for understanding
the brain, gene pools within populations, weather and climate forecasts, microelectronic devices, and
imaging systems such as computer aided tomography (CAT) scan and radar. The electric power grid,
including power generating stations, transmission lines, and consumers, is a complex system with many
redundancies; however, breakdowns occur, and guidance for investment comes from modelling the most
likely sequences of events that could cause outage. Similar planning and analysis is done for communica-
tion networks, transportation networks, water and other infrastructure. Probabilities, permutations and
combinations are used daily in many different ﬁelds that range from gambling and games, to mechanical
or structural failure rates, to rates of detection in medical screening. Uncertainty is clearly all around
us, in our daily lives and in many professions. Standard deviation is widely used when results of opinion
polls are described. The language of probability theory lets people break down complex problems, and
argue about pieces of them with each other, and then aggregate information about subsystems to analyse
a whole system. This chapter brieﬂy introduces the important subject of probability.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne probability
•
deﬁne expectation, dependent event, independent event and conditional probability
•
state the addition and multiplication laws of probability
•
use the laws of probability in simple calculations
•
use the laws of probability in practical situations

Introduction to probability
33.1.1
Probability
The probability of something happening is the likeli-
hood or chance of it happening. Values of probability lie
between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an absolute impos-
sibility and 1 represents an absolute certainty. The prob-
ability of an event happening usually lies somewhere
between these two extreme values and is expressed
as either a proper or decimal fraction. Examples of
probability are
that a length of copper wire
has zero resistance at 100◦C
0
that a fair, six-sided dice
will stop with a 3 upwards
1
6
or 0.1667
that a fair coin will land
with a head upwards
1
2
or 0.5
that a length of copper wire
has some resistance at 100◦C 1
If p is the probability of an event happening and q is the
probability of the same event not happening, then the
total probability is p + q and is equal to unity, since it
is an absolute certainty that the event either will or will
not occur; i.e. p + q = 1
Problem 1.
Determine the probabilities of
selecting at random (a) a man and (b) a woman
from a crowd containing 20 men and 33 women
(a)
The probability of selecting at random a man, p,
is given by the ratio
number of men
number in crowd
i.e.
p =
20
20 + 33 = 20
53
or
0.3774
(b)
The probability of selecting at random a woman,
q, is given by the ratio
number of women
number in crowd
i.e.
q =
33
20 + 33 = 33
53
or
0.6226
(Check: the total probability should be equal to 1:
p = 20
53 and q = 33
53, thus the total probability,
p + q = 20
53 + 33
53 = 1
hence no obvious error has been made.)
33.1.2
Expectation
The expectation, E, of an event happening is deﬁned
in general terms as the product of the probability p of
an event happening and the number of attempts made,
n; i.e. E = pn
Thus, since the probability of obtaining a 3 upwards
when rolling a fair dice is 1/6, the expectation of getting
a 3 upwards on four throws of the dice is
1
6 × 4,i.e.2
3
Thus expectation is the average occurrence of an
event.
Problem 2.
Find the expectation of obtaining a 4
upwards with 3 throws of a fair dice
Expectation is the average occurrence of an event and is
deﬁned as the probability times the number of attempts.
The probability, p, of obtaining a 4 upwards for one
throw of the dice is 1/6
If 3 attempts are made, n = 3 and the expectation, E, is
pn, i.e.
E = 1
6 × 3 = 1
2
or 0.50
33.1.3
Dependent events
A dependent event is one in which the probability of
an event happening affects the probability of another
event happening. Let 5 transistors be taken at random
from a batch of 100 transistors for test purposes and the
probability of there being a defective transistor, p1, be
determined. At some later time, let another 5 transistors
be taken at random from the 95 remaining transistors
in the batch and the probability of there being a defec-
tive transistor, p2, be determined. The value of p2 is
different from p1 since the batch size has effectively
altered from 100 to 95; i.e. probability p2 is depen-
dent on probability p1. Since 5 transistors are drawn and
then another 5 transistors are drawn without replacing

Probability
347
the ﬁrst 5, the second random selection is said to be
without replacement.
33.1.4
Independent events
An independent event is one in which the probability
of an event happening does not affect the probability
of another event happening. If 5 transistors are taken at
randomfroma batch of transistors and the probabilityof
a defective transistor, p1, is determined and the process
is repeated after the original 5 have been replaced in
the batch to give p2, then p1 is equal to p2. Since the
5 transistors are replaced between draws, the second
selection is said to be with replacement.
33.2
Laws of probability
33.2.1
The addition law of probability
The addition law of probability is recognised by the
word ‘or’ joining the probabilities.
If pA is the probability of event A happening and pB
is the probability of event B happening, the probability
of event A or event B happening is given by pA + pB
Similarly, the probability of events A or B or C or
... N happening is given by
pA + pB + pC + ··· + pN
33.2.2
The multiplication law of probability
The multiplication law of probability is recognised by
the word ‘and’ joining the probabilities.
If pA is the probability of event A happening and pB is
the probability of event B happening, the probability of
event A and event B happening is given by pA × pB
Similarly, the probability of events A and B and C and
... N happening is given by
pA × pB × pC × ··· × pN
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate proba-
bility.

Problem 4.

excessive vibration,
(b)

Problem 5.
A batch of 100 capacitors contains 73
which are within the required tolerance values and
17 which are below the required tolerance values,
the remainder being above the required tolerance
values. Determine the probabilities that, when
randomly selecting a capacitor and then a second
capacitor,
(a)
both are within the required tolerance values
when selecting with replacement,
(b)
the ﬁrst one drawn is below and the second
one drawn is above the required tolerance
value, when selection is without replacement
(a)
The probability of selecting a capacitor within
the required tolerance values is 73/100. The ﬁrst
capacitor drawn is now replaced and a second one
is drawn from the batch of 100. The probability
of this capacitor being within the required toler-
ance values is also 73/100. Thus, the probability
of selecting a capacitor within the required tol-
erance values for both the ﬁrst and the second
draw is
73
100 × 73
100 = 5329
10000
or
0.5329
(b)
The probability of obtaining a capacitor below
the required tolerance values on the ﬁrst draw
is 17/100. There are now only 99 capacitors
left in the batch, since the ﬁrst capacitor is not
replaced. The probability of drawing a capacitor
above the required tolerance values on the second
draw is 10/99, since there are (100 −73 −17),
i.e. 10, capacitors above the required tolerance
value. Thus, the probability of randomly select-
ing a capacitor below the requiredtolerance values
and subsequently randomly selecting a capacitor
above the tolerance values is
17

99 = 170
9900 = 17

Problem 6.
A batch of 40 components contains 5
which are defective. A component is drawn at
random from the batch and tested and then a second
component is drawn. Determine the probability that
neither of the components is defective when drawn
(a) with replacement and (b) without replacement
(a)
With replacement
The probabilitythat the componentselected on the
ﬁrst draw is satisfactory is 35/40 i.e. 7/8. The com-
ponent is now replaced and a second draw is made.
The probability that this component is also satis-
factory is 7/8. Hence, the probability that both the
ﬁrst component drawn and the second component
drawn are satisfactory is
7
8 × 7
8 = 49
64
or
0.7656
(b)
Without replacement
The probability that the ﬁrst component drawn
is satisfactory is 7/8. There are now only 34
satisfactory components left in the batch and the
batch number is 39. Hence, the probability of
drawing a satisfactory component on the sec-
ond draw is 34/39. Thus, the probability that the
ﬁrst component drawn and the second component
drawn are satisfactory i.e. neither is defective is
7
8 × 34
39 = 238

or
0.7628
Problem 7.
A batch of 40 components contains 5
which are defective. If a component is drawn at
random from the batch and tested and then a second
component is drawn at random, calculate the
probability of having one defective component, both
(a) with replacement and (b) without replacement
The probability of having one defective component can
be achieved in two ways. If p is the probability of draw-
ing a defective component and q is the probability of
drawing a satisfactory component, then the probability
of having one defective component is given by drawing
a satisfactory component and then a defective compo-
nent or by drawing a defective component and then a
satisfactory one; i.e. by q × p + p × q
(a)
With replacement
p = 5

Problem 8.
A box contains 74 brass washers,
86 steel washers and 40 aluminium washers. Three
washers are drawn at random from the box without
replacement. Determine the probability that all
three are steel washers
Assume, for clarity of explanation, that a washer is
drawn at random, then a second, then a third (although
this assumption does not affect the results obtained).
The total number of washers is
74 + 86 + 40,
i.e.
200
The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on
the ﬁrst draw is 86/200. There are now 85 steel washers
in a batch of 199. The probability of randomly selecting
a steel washer on the second draw is 85/199. There are
now 84 steel washers in a batch of 198. The probability
of randomly selecting a steel washer on the third draw
is 84/198. Hence, the probability of selecting a steel
washer on the ﬁrst draw and the second draw and the
third draw is

i.e. 160/200. There are now
199 washers in the batch of which 159 are not made
of aluminium. Hence, the probability of not drawing
an aluminium washer on the second draw is 159/199.
Similarly, the probability of not drawing an aluminium
washer on the third draw is 158/198. Hence the proba-
bility of not drawing an aluminium washer on the ﬁrst
and second and third draws is

Introduction to
differentiation
Why it is important to understand: Introduction to differentiation
There are many practical situations engineers have to analyse which involve quantities that are varying.
Typical examples include the stress in a loaded beam, the temperature of an industrial chemical, the rate
at which the speed of a vehicle is increasing or decreasing, the current in an electrical circuit or the torque
on a turbine blade. Differential calculus, or differentiation, is a mathematical technique for analysing the
way in which functions change. A good knowledge of algebra, in particular, laws of indices, is essential.
This chapter explains how to differentiate the ﬁve most common functions, providing an important base
for future studies.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state that calculus comprises two parts −differential and integral calculus
•
understand functional notation
•
describe the gradient of a curve and limiting value
•
differentiate y = axn by the general rule
•
differentiate sine and cosine functions
•
differentiate exponential and logarithmic functions
34.1
Introduction to calculus
Calculus is a branch of mathematics involving or lead-
ing to calculations dealing with continuously varying
functions such as velocity and acceleration, rates of
change and maximum and minimum values of curves.
Calculus has widespread applications in science and
engineering and is used to solve complicated problems
for which algebra alone is insufﬁcient.
Calculus is a subject that falls into two parts:
(a)
differential calculus (or differentiation),
(b)
integral calculus (or integration).
This chapter provides an introduction to differentiation
and applies differentiation to rates of change. Chapter35
introduces integration and applies it to determine areas
under curves.
Further applications of differentiation and integration
are explored in Engineering Mathematics (Bird, 2014).

Functional notation
In an equation such as y = 3x2 + 2x −5, y is said to be
a function of x and may be written as y = f (x)

Basic Engineering Mathematics
An equation written in the form f (x) = 3x2 + 2x −5
is termed functional notation. The value of f (x)
when x = 0 is denoted by f (0), and the value of f (x)
when x = 2 is denoted by f (2), and so on. Thus, when
f (x) = 3x2 + 2x −5,
f (0) = 3(0)2 + 2(0) −5 = −5
and
f (2) = 3(2)2 + 2(2) −5 = 11,and so on.
Problem 1.
If f (x) = 4x2 −3x + 2, ﬁnd
f (0), f (3), f (−1) and f (3) −f (−1)
f (x) = 4x2 −3x + 2
f (0) = 4(0)2 −3(0) + 2 = 2
f (3) = 4(3)2 −3(3) + 2 = 36 −9 + 2 = 29
f (−1) = 4(−1)2 −3(−1) + 2 = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
f (3) −f (−1) = 29 −9 = 20
Problem 2.
Given that f (x) = 5x2 + x −7,
determine (a) f (−2) (b) f (2) ÷ f (1)
(a)
f (−2) = 5(−2)2 + (−2) −7 = 20 −2 −7 = 11
(b)
f (2) = 5(2)2 + 2 −7 = 15
f (1) = 5(1)2 + 1 −7 = −1
f (2) ÷ f (1) = 15
−1 = −15

The gradient of a curve
If a tangent is drawn at a point P on a curve, the gradient
of this tangent is said to be the gradient of the curve at
P. In Fig. 34.1, the gradient of the curve at P is equal
to the gradient of the tangent PQ.

Thus, as point B moves closer and closer to point A,
the gradient of the chord approaches nearer and nearer

gradient of the chord AB and when B coincides with A
the chord becomes the tangent to the curve.

34.4 Differentiation from ﬁrst
principles
In Fig. 34.4, A and B are two points very close together
on a curve, δx (delta x) and δy (delta y) representing
small increments in the x and y directions, respectively.

however,
δy = f (x + δx) −f (x)
Hence,

As δx approaches zero, δy
δx approaches a limiting value
and the gradient of the chord approaches the gradient of
the tangent at A.
When determining the gradient of a tangent to a curve
there are two notations used. The gradient of the curve
at A in Fig. 34.4 can either be written as

∗Who was Leibniz? – Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (sometimes
von Leibniz) (1 July 1646 – 14 November 1716) was a German
mathematician and philosopher. Leibniz developed inﬁnitesi-
mal calculus and invented the Leibniz wheel. To ﬁnd out more
go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
f (x) = x2 and substituting (x + δx) for x
gives
f (x + δx) = (x + δx)2 = x2 + 2xδx + δx2, hence,
f ′(x) = limit

2xδx + δx2
δx

δx→0{2x + δx}
As δx →0,{2x + δx} →{2x + 0}.
Thus, f ′(x) = 2x i.e. the differential coefﬁcient of x2
is 2x
This means that the general equation for the gradient of
the curve f (x) = x2 is 2x. If the gradient is required at,
say, x = 3, then gradient = 2(3) = 6
Differentiation from ﬁrst principles can be a lengthy
process and we do not want to have to go through this
procedure every time we want to differentiate a function.
In reality we do not have to because from the above
procedure has evolved a set general rule, which we
consider in the following section.
34.5 Differentiation of y = axn by the
general rule
From differentiation by ﬁrst principles, a general rule
for differentiating axn emerges where a and n are any
constants. This rule is
if y = axn then dy
dx = anxn−1
or
if f (x) = axn then f ′(x) = anxn−1
When differentiating, results can be expressed in a
number of ways. For example,
(a)
if y = 3x2 then dy
dx = 6x
(b)
if f (x) = 3x2 then f ′(x) = 6x
(c)
the differential coefﬁcient of 3x2 is 6x
(d)
the derivative of 3x2 is 6x

Problem 4.
Differentiate the following with
respect to x: y = 4x7
Comparing y = 4x7 with y = axn shows that a = 4 and
n = 7. Using the general rule,

Problem 7.
Differentiate y = 4
y = 4 may be written as y = 4x0; i.e. in the general rule
a = 4 and n = 0. Hence,
dy
dx = (4)(0)x0−1 = 0
The equation y = 4 represents a straight horizontal
line and the gradient of a horizontal line is zero, hence
the result could have been determined on inspection.
In general, the differential coefﬁcient of a constant is
always zero.
Problem 8.
Differentiate y = 7x
Since y = 7x, i.e. y = 7x1, in the general rule a = 7 and
n = 1. Hence,
dy
dx = (7)(1)x1−1 = 7x0 = 7
since x0 = 1
The
gradient
of
the

y = 7x

Thus, since y = 3x4 −2x2 + 5x −2,
the gradient = dy
dx = 12x3 −4x + 5
At the point (0,−2),x = 0, thus
the gradient = 12(0)3 −4(0) + 5 = 5

gradient is positive but is decreasing in value until at A
the gradient is zero, shown as A′. Between A and B the
gradient is negative but is increasing in value until at B
the gradient is at its steepest. Hence B′ is a maximum
negative value.
If the gradient of y = sinx is further investigated
between B and C and C and D then the resulting graph
of dy
dx is seen to be a cosine wave.
Hence the rate of change of sinx is cosx, i.e.
if y = sin x then dy
dx = cos x
It may also be shown that
if y = sin ax, dy
dx = acosax
(1)
(wherea isaconstant)
and if y = sin(ax + α), dy
dx = acos(ax + α)

(where a and α are constants).
If a similar exercise is followed for y = cosx then the
graphs of Fig. 34.6 result, showing dy
dx to be a graph of
sin x but displaced by π radians.

Rates of change
If a quantity y depends on and varies with a quantity
x then the rate of change of y with respect to x is dy
dx .
Thus, for example, the rate of change of pressure p with
height h is dp
dh
A rate of change with respect to time is usually just
called ‘the rate of change’, the ‘with respect to time’
being assumed. Thus, for example, a rate of change of
current, i, is di
dt and a rate of change of temperature, θ,
is dθ
dt , and so on.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate practi-
cal examples of rates of change.
Problem 26.
The length L metres of a certain
metal rod at temperature t◦C is given by
L = 1 + 0.00003t + 0.0000004t2. Determine the
rate of change of length, in mm/◦C, when the
temperature is (a) 100◦C (b) 250◦C

366
Basic Engineering Mathematics
The rate of change of length means dL
dt
Since length L = 1 + 0.00003t + 0.0000004t2, then
dL
dt = 0.00003 + 0.0000008t.
(a)
When t = 100◦C,
dL
dt = 0.00003 + (0.0000008)(100)
= 0.00011m/◦C = 0.11mm/◦C.
(b)
When t = 250◦C,
dL
dt = 0.00003 + (0.0000008)(250)
= 0.00023m/◦C = 0.23mm/◦C.
Problem 27.
The luminous intensity I candelas
of a lamp at varying voltage V is given by
I = 5 × 10−4V2. Determine the voltage at which
the light is increasing at a rate of 0.4 candelas
per volt
The rate of change of light with respect to voltage is
given by dI
dV
Since I = 5 × 10−4V2
dI
dV = (5 × 10−4)(2V) = 10 × 10−4 V = 10−3 V
When the light is increasing at 0.4 candelas per volt then
+0.4 = 10−3 V, from which
voltage,V = 0.4
10−3 = 0.4 × 10+3 = 400volts
Problem 28.
Newton’s law of cooling is given by
θ = θ0e−kt, where the excess of temperature at zero

Determine the rate of change of temperature after
50s, given that θ0 = 15◦C and k = −0.02
The rate of change of temperature is dθ

Since θ = θ0e−kt, then dθ
dt = (θ0)(−ke−kt)

When θ0 = 15,k = −0.02 and t = 50, then

Introduction to integration
Why it is important to understand: Introduction to integration
Engineering is all about problem solving and many problems in engineering can be solved using calculus.
Physicists, chemists, engineers and many other scientiﬁc and technical specialists use calculus in their
everyday work; it is a technique of fundamental importance. Both integration and differentiation have
numerous applications in engineering and science and some typical examples include determining areas,
mean and rms values, volumes of solids of revolution, centroids, second moments of area, differential
equations and Fourier series. Standard integrals are introduced in this chapter, together with one appli-
cation – ﬁnding the area under a curve. For any further studies in engineering, differential and integral
calculus are unavoidable.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand that integration is the reverse process of differentiation
•
determine integrals of the form axn where n is fractional, zero, or a positive or negative integer
•
integrate standard functions −cos ax, sin ax, eax, 1
x
•
evaluate deﬁnite integrals
•
determine the area under a curve
35.1
The process of integration
The process of integration reverses the process of
differentiation. In differentiation, if f (x) = 2x2 then
f ′(x) = 4x. Thus, the integral of 4x is 2x2; i.e. integra-
tion is the process of moving from f ′(x) to f (x). By
similar reasoning, the integral of 2t is t2
Integration is a process of summation or adding parts
together and an elongated S, shown as
(
, is used to
replace the words ‘the integral of’. Hence, from above,
(
4x = 2x2 and
(
2t is t2
In differentiation, the differential coefﬁcient dy
dx indi-
cates that a function of x is being differentiated with
respect to x, the dx indicating that it is ‘with respect
to x’
In integration the variable of integration is shown
by adding d (the variable) after the function to be
integrated. Thus,
)
4x dx means ‘the integral of 4x with respect to x’,
and
)
2t dt means ‘the integral of 2t with respect to t’
As stated above, the differential coefﬁcient of 2x2 is 4x,
hence;
(
4x dx = 2x2. However, the differential coef-
ﬁcient of 2x2 + 7 is also 4x. Hence,
(
4x dx could
also be equal to 2x2 + 7. To allow for the possible
presence of a constant, whenever the process of inte-
gration is performed a constant c is added to the result.
Thus,

Deﬁnite integrals
Integrals containing an arbitrary constant c in their
results are called indeﬁnite integrals since their precise
value cannot be determined without furtherinformation.
Deﬁnite integrals are those in which limits are applied.
If an expression is written as [x]b
a, b is called the upper
limit and a the lower limit. The operation of applying
the limits is deﬁned as [x]b
a = (b) −(a)
For example, the increase in the value of the integral
x2 as x increases from 1 to 3 is written as
( 3
1 x2dx.
Applying the limits gives

The area under a curve
The area shown shaded in Fig. 35.1 may be determined
using approximatemethods such as the trapezoidal rule,
the mid-ordinaterule or Simpson’s rule (see Chapter 28)
or, more precisely, by using integration.

The shaded area in Fig. 35.1 is given by
shaded area =

y dx =

f(x) dx
Thus, determining the area under a curve by integration
merely involves evaluating a deﬁnite integral, as shown
in Section 35.4.
There are several instances in engineering and science
where the area beneath a curve needs to be accurately
determined. For example, the areas between the limits
of a
velocity/time graph gives distance travelled,
force/distance graph gives work done,
voltage/current graph gives power, and so on.
Should a curve drop below the x-axis then y(= f (x))
becomes negative and
(
f (x)dx is negative. When
determining such areas by integration, a negative sign
is placed before the integral. For the curve shown in
Fig. 35.2, the total shaded area is given by (area E+
area F +area G).

whether it crosses the x-axis.

Number sequences
Why it is important to understand: Number sequences
Number sequences are widely used in engineering applications including computer data structure and
sorting algorithms, ﬁnancial engineering, audio compression, and architectural engineering. Thanks to
engineers, robots have migrated from factory shop ﬂoors −as industrial manipulators; to outer space −
as interplanetary explorers; hospitals −as minimally invasive surgical assistants; homes −as vacuum
cleaners and lawn mowers; and battleﬁelds −as unmanned air, underwater and ground vehicles. Arith-
metic progressions are used in simulation engineering and in the reproductive cycle of bacteria. Further
uses of APs in daily life include uniform increase in the speed at regular intervals, completing patterns of
objects, calculating simple interest, speed of an aircraft, increase or decrease in the costs of goods, sales
and production, and so on. Geometric progressions are used in compound interest and in calculating
the range of speeds on a drilling machine. GPs are used throughout mathematics, and they have many
important applications in physics, engineering, biology, economics, computer science, queuing theory,
and ﬁnance.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne and determine simple number sequences
•
calculate the nth term of a series
•
calculate the nth term of an AP
•
calculate the sum of n terms of an AP
•
calculate the nth term of a GP
•
calculate the sum of n terms of a GP
•
calculate the sum to inﬁnity of a GP
36.1
Simple sequences
A set of numbers which are connected by a deﬁnite
law is called a series or a sequence of numbers. Each
of the numbers in the series is called a term of the
series.
For example, 1,3,5,7,... is a series obtained by
adding 2 to the previous term, and 2,8,32,128,...
is a sequence obtained by multiplying the previous
term by 4
Problem 1.
Determine the next two terms in the
series: 3,6,9,12,...
We notice that the sequence 3,6,9,12,... progres-
sively increases by 3, thus the next two terms will be
15 and 18
Problem 2.
Find the next two terms in the series:
9,5,1,...

Number sequences
383
We notice that each term in the series 9,5,1,... pro-
gressively decreases by 4, thus the next two terms will
be 1 −4, i.e. −3 and −3 −4, i.e. −7
Problem 3.
Determine the next two terms in the
series: 2,6,18,54,...
We notice that the second term, 6, is three times the ﬁrst
term, the third term, 18, is three times the second term,
and that the fourth term, 54, is three times the third term.
Hence the ﬁfth term will be 3 × 54 = 162, and the sixth
term will be 3 × 162 = 486
Now try the following Practice Exercise

36.2
The nth term of a series
If a series is represented by a general expression, say,
2n + 1, where n is an integer (i.e. a whole number),then
by substituting n = 1,2,3,... the terms of the series
can be determined; in this example, the ﬁrst three terms
will be:
2(1) + 1,
2(2) + 1,
2(3) + 1,...,
i.e. 3,5,7,...
What is the nth term of the sequence 1,3,5,7,...?
First, we notice that the gap between each term
is 2, hence the law relating the numbers is: ‘2n+
something’.
The second term, 3 = 2n + something, hence when
n = 2 (i.e. the second term of the series), then 3 = 4+
something, and the ‘something’ must be −1
Thus, the nth term of 1,3,5,7,... is 2n −1
Hence the ﬁfth term is given by 2(5) −1 = 9, and the
twentieth term is 2(20) −1 = 39, and so on.
Problem 4.
The nth term of a sequence is given
by 3n + 1. Write down the ﬁrst four terms.
The ﬁrst four terms of the series 3n + 1 will be:
3(1) + 1,
3(2) + 1,
3(3) + 1 and 3(4) + 1
i.e. 4, 7, 10 and 13
Problem 5.
The nth term of a series is given by
4n −1. Write down the ﬁrst four terms.
The ﬁrst four terms of the series 4n −1 will be:
4(1) −1,
4(2) −1,
4(3) −1 and 4(4) −1
i.e. 3, 7, 11 and 15
Problem 6.
Find the nth term of the series:
1,4,7,...
We notice that the gap between each of the given three
terms is 3, hence the law relating the numbers is: ‘3n+
something’.
The second term,
4 = 3n + something,
so when n = 2, then
4 = 6 + something,
so the ‘something’ must be −2 (from simple equations)
Thus, the nth term of the series 1,4,7,... is: 3n −2
Problem 7.
Find the nth term of the sequence:
3,9,15,21,... Hence determine the 15th term of
the series.
We notice that the gap between each of the given four
terms is 6, hence the law relating the numbers is: ‘6n+
something’.
The second term,
9 = 6n + something,
so when n = 2, then
9 = 12 + something,
so the ‘something’ must be −3
Thus, the nth term of the series 3,9,15,21,... is:
6n −3
The 15th term of the series is given by 6n −3 when
n = 15
Hence, the 15th term of the series 3,9,15,21,... is:
6(15) −3 = 87
Problem 8.
Find the nth term of the series:
1,4,9,16,25,...

384
Basic Engineering Mathematics
This is a special series and does not follow the pattern
of the previous examples. Each of the terms in the given
series are square numbers,
i.e. 1,4,9,16,25,... ≡12,22,32,42,52,...
Hence the nth term is: n2

36.3
Arithmetic progressions
When a sequence has a constant difference between suc-
cessive terms it is called an arithmetic progression
(often abbreviated to AP).
Examples include:
(i)
1,4,7,10,13,...where the common
difference is 3
and
(ii)
a,a + d,a + 2d,a + 3d,...where the
common difference is d.
36.3.1
General expression for the nth term
of an AP
If the ﬁrst term of an AP is ‘a’ and the common
difference is ‘d’ then:
the nth term is:
a + (n −1)d
In example (i) above, the 7th term is given by
1 + (7 −1)3 = 19, which may be readily checked.
36.3.2
Sum of n terms of an AP
The sum S of an AP can be obtained by multiplying the
average of all the terms by the number of terms.
The average of all the terms = a +l
2
, where ‘a’ is the
ﬁrst term and ‘l’ is the last term, i.e. l = a + (n −1)d,
for n terms.
Hence, the sum of n terms, Sn = n
a +l
2

= n
2 {a+[a + (n −1)d]}
i.e.
Sn = n
2 [2a + (n −1)d]
For example, the sum of the ﬁrst 7 terms of the series
1,4,7,10,13,... is given by:
S7 = 7
2[2(1) + (7 −1)3] since a = 1 and d = 3
= 7
2[2 + 18] = 7
2[20] = 70
Here are some worked problems to help understanding
of arithmetic progressions.
Problem 9.
Determine (a) the ninth, and (b) the
sixteenth term of the series 2,7,12,17,...
2,7,12,17,... is an arithmetic progression with a com-

The nth term of an AP is given by a + (n −1)d
Since the ﬁrst term a = 2,d = 5 and n = 9 then
the 9th term is: 2 + (9 −1)5 = 2 + (8)(5)
= 2 + 40 = 42

Problem 10.
The 6th term of an AP is 17 and the
13th term is 38. Determine the 19th term
The nth term of an AP is: a + (n −1)d
The 6th term is:
a + 5d = 17
(1)
The 13th term is:
a + 12d = 38
(2)
Equation (2) −equation (1) gives: 7d = 21 from which,
d = 21

Substituting in equation (1) gives: a + 15 = 17 from
which, a = 2

Hence, if the nth term is 22 then:
a + (n −1)d = 22
i.e.
2.5 + (n −1)(1.5) = 22
i.e.
(n −1)(1.5) = 22 −2.5 = 19.5
and
n −1 = 19.5

The sum of 7 terms of an AP is 35
and the common difference is 1.2. Determine the
ﬁrst term of the series.
n = 7,d = 1.2 and S7 = 35. Since the sum of n terms
of an AP is given by:

2[2a + (n −1)d]
Then
35 = 7
2[2a + (7 −1)1.2] = 7

Problem 15.
Three numbers are in arithmetic
progression. Their sum is 15 and their product is 80.
Determine the three numbers.
Let the three numbers be (a −d),a and (a + d)
Then,
(a −d) + a + (a + d) = 15
i.e.
3a = 15
from which,
a = 5
Also,
a(a −d)(a + d) = 80
i.e.
a(a2 −d2) = 80
Since a = 5,
5(52 −d2) = 80
i.e.
125 −5d2 = 80
and
125 −80 = 5d2
i.e.
45 = 5d2
from which,
d2 = 45
5 = 9
Hence,
d =

9 = ±3
The three numbers are thus: (5 −3),5 and (5 + 3), i.e.

3 + (n −1)3 = 207
from which,
(n −1) = 207 −3

= 68
Hence,
n = 68 + 1 = 69
The sum of all 69 terms is given by:
S69 = n
2[2a + (n −1)d]

2 [2(3) + (69 −1)3]

arithmetic progression are: 4,31.5, and 376.5,
respectively. Determine (a) the number of terms in
the series, (b) the sum of all the terms, and (c) the
80th term.
(a)
Let the AP be a,a + d,a + 2d,...,a + (n −1)d,
where a = 4
The 12th term is: a + (12 −1)d = 31.5
i.e.
4 + 11d = 31.5
from which,
11d = 31.5 −4 = 27.5
Hence,
d = 27.5
11 = 2.5
The last term is: a+(n −1)d
i.e. 4 + (n −1)(2.5) = 376.5
i.e.
(n −1) = 376.5 −4
2.5
= 372.5
2.5
= 149
Hence, the number of terms in the series,
n = 149 + 1 = 150
(b)
Sum of all the terms,
S150 = n
2[2a + (n −1)d]

= 75(380.5) = 28537.5
(c)
The 80th term is: a + (n −1)d = 4 + (80 −1)(2.5)

Geometric progressions
When a sequence has a constant ratio between succes-
sive terms it is called a geometric progression (often
abbreviated to GP). The constant is called the common
ratio, r.
Examples include
(i) 1,2,4,8,...where the common ratio is 2
and (ii) a,ar,ar2,ar3,...where the common ratio is r
36.4.1
General expression for the nth term
of a GP
If the ﬁrst term of a GP is ‘a’ and the common ratio is
‘r’, then
the nth term is:
arn−1
which can be readily checked from the above examples.
For example, the 8th term of the GP 1,2,4,8,... is
(1)(2)7 = 128, since ‘a’ = 1 and ‘r’ = 2
36.4.2
Sum of n terms of a GP
Let a GP be a,ar,ar2,ar3,...,arn−1
then the sum of n terms,
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + ··· +arn−1 ···
(1)
Multiplying throughout by r gives:
r Sn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + ···arn−1 + arn ···
(2)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
Sn −r Sn = a −arn
i.e.
Sn(1 −r) = a(1 −rn)
Thus, the sum of n terms, Sn = a(1 −rn)
(1 −r)
which is
valid when r < 1
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives:
Sn = a(rn −1)
(r −1)
which is valid when r > 1
For example, the sum of the ﬁrst 8 terms of the GP
1,2,4,8,16,... is given by:
S8 = 1(28 −1)
(2 −1)
since ‘a’ = 1 and r = 2
i.e.
S8 = 1(256 −1)
1
= 255
36.4.3
Sum to inﬁnity of a GP
When the common ratio r of a GP is less than unity, the
sum of n terms,
Sn = a(1 −rn)
(1 −r) , which may be written as:
Sn =
a
(1 −r) −
arn
(1 −r)
Since r < 1,rn becomes less as n increases, i.e.
rn →0 as n →∞
Hence,
arn
(1 −r) →0 as n →∞
Thus,
Sn →
a
(1 −r)
as n →∞
The quantity
a
(1 −r) is called the sum to inﬁnity, S∞,
and is the limiting value of the sum of an inﬁnite number
of terms,
i.e.
S∞=
a
(1 −r) which is valid when −1 < r < 1

If £100 is invested at compound
interest of 8% per annum, determine (a) the value
after 10 years, (b) the time, correct to the nearest
year, it takes to reach more than £300.
(a)
Let the GP be a,ar,ar2,...arn
The ﬁrst term, a = £100 and the common ratio,
r = 1.08
Hence, the second term is: ar = (100)(1.08) =
£108, which is the value after 1 year, the third
term is: ar2 = (100)(1.08)2 = £116.64, which is
the value after 2 years, and so on.
Thus, the value after 10 years
= ar10 = (100)(1.08)10 = £215.89
(b)
When £300 has been reached, 300 = arn
i.e.
300 = 100(1.08)n
and
3 = (1.08)n
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:
lg3 = lg(1.08)n = n lg(1.08)

Chapter 37
Binary, octal and
hexadecimal numbers
Why it is important to understand: Binary, octal and hexadecimal number
There are inﬁnite ways to represent a number. The four commonly associated with modern computers
and digital electronics are decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal. All four number systems are equally
capable of representing any number. Furthermore, a number can be perfectly converted between the
various number systems without any loss of numeric value. At a ﬁrst look, it seems like using any number
system other than decimal is complicated and unnecessary. However, since the job of electrical and
software engineers is to work with digital circuits, engineers require number systems that can best transfer
information between the human world and the digital circuit world. Thus the way in which a number is
represented can make it easier for the engineer to perceive the meaning of the number as it applies to a
digital circuit, i.e. the appropriate number system can actually make things less complicated.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise a binary number
•
convert binary to decimal and vice-versa
•

•

Introduction
All data in modern computers is stored as series of bits, a
bit being a binary digit, and can have one of two values,
the numbers 0 and 1. The most basic form of represent-
ing computer data is to represent a piece of data as a
string of ‘1’s and ‘0’s, one for each bit. This is called a
binary or base-2 number.
Because binary notation requires so many bits to rep-
resent relatively small numbers, two further compact
notations are often used, called octal and hexadecimal.
Computer programmers who design sequences of num-
ber codes instructing a computerwhat to do, would have
a very difﬁcult task if they were forced to work with
nothing but long strings of ‘1’s and ‘0’s, the ‘native
language’ of any digital circuit.

Basic Engineering Mathematics
Octal notation represents data as base-8 numbers with
each digit in an octal number representing three bits.
Similarly, hexadecimal notation uses base-16 numbers,
representing four bits with each digit. Octal numbers
use only the digits 0–7, while hexadecimal numbers
use all ten base-10 digits (0–9) and the letters A–F
(representing the numbers 10–15).
This chapter explains how to convert between the
decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal systems.
37.2
Binary numbers
The system of numbers in everyday use is the denary
or decimal system of numbers, using the digits 0 to 9.
It has ten different digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)
and is said to have a radix or base of 10.
The binary system of numbers has a radix of 2 and uses
only the digits 0 and 1.
(a) Conversion of binary to decimal
The decimal number 234.5 is equivalent to
2 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10−1
In the binary system of numbers, the base is 2, so 1101.1
is equivalent to:
1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 + 1 × 2−1
Thus, the decimal number equivalent to the binary
number 1101.1 is:
8 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1
2 that is 13.5
i.e. 1101.12 = 13.510, the sufﬁxes 2 and 10 denoting
binary and decimal systems of numbers, respectively.

The result is obtained by writing the top digit of the
remainder as the least signiﬁcant bit, (the least signiﬁ-
cant bit is the one on the right). The bottom bit of the
remainder is the most signiﬁcant bit, i.e. the bit on the

Octal numbers
For decimal integers containing several digits, repeat-
edly dividing by 2 can be a lengthy process. In this case,
it is usually easier to convert a decimal number to a
binary number via the octal system of numbers. This
system has a radix of 8, using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 and 7. The decimal number equivalent to the octal
number 43178 is:
4 × 83 + 3 × 82 + 1 × 81 + 7 × 80
i.e.
4 × 512 + 3 × 64 + 1 × 8 + 7 × 1 = 225510
An integer decimal number can be converted to a cor-
responding octal number by repeatedly dividing by 8
and noting the remainder at each stage, as shown below

For fractions, the most signiﬁcant bit is the top integer
obtained by multiplication of the decimal fraction by 8,
thus,
0.437510 = 0.348
The natural binary code for digits 0 to 7 is shown
in Table 37.1, and an octal number can be converted
to a binary number by writing down the three bits
corresponding to the octal digit.

The ‘0’ on the extreme left does not signify anything,
thus

Hexadecimal numbers
The hexadecimal system is particularly important in
computer programming, since four bits (each consist-
ing of a one or zero) can be succinctly expressed using
a single hexadecimal digit. Two hexadecimal digits rep-
resent numbers from 0 to 255, a common range used,
for example, to specify colours. Thus, in the HTML
language of the web, colours are speciﬁed using three
pairs of hexadecimal digits RRGGBB, where RR is the
amount of red, GG the amount of green, and BB the
amount of blue.
A hexadecimal numbering system has a radix of 16
and uses the following 16 distinct digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F
‘A’ corresponds to 10 in the denary system, B to 11, C
to 12, and so on.
(a) Converting from hexadecimal to decimal
For example, 1A16 = 1 × 161 + A × 160
= 1 × 161 + 10 × 1
= 16 + 10 = 26
i.e.
1A16 = 2610
Similarly,
2E16 = 2 × 161 + E × 160
= 2 × 161 + 14 × 160
= 32 + 14 = 4610
and
1BF16 = 1 × 162 + B × 161 + F × 160
= 1 × 162 + 11 × 161 + 15 × 160
= 256 + 176 + 15 = 44710

The binary bits are arranged in groups of four, start-

fours as:
1110
0111
1010
1001
and a hexadecimal symbol
assigned to each group as:

Inequalities
Why it is important to understand: Inequalities
In mathematics, an inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different. A work-
ing knowledge of inequalities can be beneﬁcial to the practising engineer, and inequalities are central to
the deﬁnitions of all limiting processes, including differentiation and integration. When exact solutions are
unavailable, inconvenient, or unnecessary, inequalities can be used to obtain error bounds for numerical
approximation. Understanding and using inequalities is important in many branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne an inequality
•
state simple rules for inequalities
•
solve simple inequalities
•
solve inequalities involving a modulus
•
solve inequalities involving quotients
•
solve inequalities involving square functions
•
solve quadratic inequalities
38.1
Introduction to inequalities
An inequality is any expression involving one of the
symbols <, >, ≤or ≥
p<q means p is less than q
p>q means p is greater than q
p≤q means p is less than or equal to q
p ≥q means p is greater than or equal to q
38.1.1
Some simple rules
(i)
When a quantity is added or subtracted to both
sides of an inequality, the inequality still remains.
For example, if p <3
then
p + 2 < 3 + 2 (adding 2 to both sides)
and
p −2 < 3 −2 (subtracting 2 from
both sides)
(ii)
When multiplying or dividing both sides of
an inequality by a positive quantity, say 5, the
inequality remains the same. For example,
if p > 4 then 5p > 20 and
p
5 > 4
5
(iii)
When multiplying or dividing both sides of an
inequality by a negative quantity, say −3, the
inequality is reversed. For example,
if p > 1 then −3p < −3 and
p
−3 < 1
−3
(Note>has changed to<in each example)
To solve an inequality means ﬁnding all the values of
the variable for which the inequality is true. Knowl-
edge of simple equations (Chapter 11) and quadratic
equations (Chapter 14) are needed in this chapter.

Simple inequalities
The solution of some simple inequalities, using only
the rules given in Section 38.1, is demonstrated in the
following worked problems.
Problem 1.
Solve the following inequalities:
(a) 3+x >7
(b) 3t <6
(c) z −2≥5
(d) p
3 ≤2
(a)
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality:
3+x >7 gives:
3 + x −3 > 7 −3, i.e. x >4
Hence, all values of x greater than 4 satisfy the
inequality.
(b)
Dividing both sides of the inequality: 3t < 6 by 3
gives:
3t
3 < 6
3, i.e. t < 2
Hence, all values of t less than 2 satisfy the
inequality.
(c)
Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality: z −2≥5
gives:
z −2 + 2 ≥5 + 2, i.e. z ≥7
Hence, all values of z equal to or greater than 7
satisfy the inequality.
(d)
Multiplying both sides of the inequality: p
3 ≤2
by 3 gives:
(3) p
3 ≤(3)2, i.e. p ≤6
Hence, all values of p equal to or less than 6 satisfy
the inequality.
Problem 2.
Solve the inequality: 4x +1>x +5
Subtracting 1 from both sides of the inequality:
4x +1>x +5 gives:
4x > x + 4
Subtracting x from both sides of the inequality:
4x > x + 4 gives:
3x > 4
Dividingboth sides of the inequality: 3x > 4 by 3 gives:
x > 4
3
Hence all values of x greater than 4
3 satisfy the
inequality:
4x + 1 > x + 5
Problem 3.
Solve the inequality: 3−4t ≤8+t
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality:
3 −4t ≤8 + t gives:
−4t ≤5 + t
Subtracting t from both sides of the inequality:
−4t ≤5+t gives:
−5t ≤5
Dividing both sides of the inequality: −5t ≤5 by −5
gives:
t ≥−1 (remembering to reverse the inequality)
Hence, all values of t greater than or equal to −1 satisfy
the inequality.

38.3 Inequalities involving
a modulus
The modulus of a number is the size of the number,
regardless of sign. Vertical lines enclosing the number
denote a modulus.

Inequalities
403
For example, |4|=4 and |−4|=4 (the modulus of a
number is never negative)
The inequality: |t|<1 means that all numbers whose
actual size, regardless of sign, is less than 1, i.e. any
value between −1 and +1.
Thus |t|< 1 means −1< t<1
Similarly, |x|>3 means all numbers whose actual size,
regardlessof sign, is greater than 3, i.e. any value greater
than 3 and any value less than −3.
Thus |x|>3 means x>3 and x < −3
Inequalities involving a modulus are demonstrated in
the following worked problems.
Problem 4.
Solve the following inequality:
|3x +1|<4
Since |3x +1|<4 then −4<3x +1<4
Now −4<3x +1 becomes −5<3x, i.e. −5
3 <x
and 3x+1<4 becomes 3x <3, i.e. x < 1
Hence, these two results together become −5
3 <x < 1
and mean that the inequality |3x +1|<4 is satisﬁed for
any value of x greater than −5
3 but less than 1.
Problem 5.
Solve the inequality: |1+2t|≤5
Since |1+2t|≤5 then −5≤1+2t ≤5
Now −5≤1+2t becomes −6≤2t i.e. −3≤t
and 1+2t ≤5 becomes 2t ≤4 i.e. t ≤2
Hence, these two results together become: −3 ≤t ≤2
Problem 6.
Solve the inequality: |3z −4|>2
|3z −4|>2 means 3z −4>2 and 3z −4<−2
i.e. 3z >6 and 3z <2
i.e. the inequality: |3z −4|>2 is satisﬁed when
z > 2 and z < 2

Inequalities involving quotients
If p
q >0 then p
q must be a positive value.
For p
q to be positive, either p is positive and q is
positive or p is negative and q is negative.
i.e. +
+ = + and −
−=+
If p
q <0 then p
q must be a negative value.
For p
q to be negative, either p is positive and q is
negative or p is negative and q is positive.
i.e. +
−=−and −
+ =−
This reasoningis used when solving inequalities involv-
ing quotients, as demonstrated in the following worked
problems.
Problem 7.
Solve the inequality: t +1
3t −6 >0
Since t + 1
3t −6 >0 then t + 1
3t −6 must be positive.
For t + 1
3t −6 to be positive,
either
(i) t +1>0 and 3t −6>0
or (ii) t +1<0 and 3t −6<0

404
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(i)
If t +1>0 then t >−1 and if 3t −6>0 then
3t >6 and t >2
Both of the inequalities t >−1 and t >2 are only
true when t >2,
i.e. the fraction t + 1
3t −6 is positive when t > 2
(ii)
If t +1<0 then t <−1 and if 3t −6<0 then
3t <6 and t <2
Both of the inequalities t <−1 and t <2 are only
true when t <−1,
i.e. the fraction t + 1
3t −6 is positive when t < −1
Summarising, t + 1
3t −6 >0 when t > 2 or t < −1
Problem 8.
Solve the inequality: 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1
Since 2x +3
x +2 ≤1 then 2x +3
x +2 −1≤0
i.e. 2x + 3
x + 2 −x + 2
x + 2 ≤0
i.e. 2x +3−(x +2)
x +2
≤0 or x +1
x +2 ≤0
For x + 1
x + 2 to be negative or zero,
either
(i) x +1≤0 and
x +2>0
or (ii) x +1≥0 and
x +2<0
(i)
If x +1≤0 then x ≤−1 and if x +2>0 then
x >−2
(Note that>is used for the denominator, not ≥;
a zero denominator gives a value for the fraction
which is impossible to evaluate.)
Hence, the inequality x +1
x +2 ≤0 is true when x is
greater than −2 and less than or equalto −1, which
may be written as −2 < x ≤−1
(ii)
If x +1≥0 then x ≥−1 and if x +2<0 then
x <−2
It is not possible to satisfy both x ≥−1 and x <−2
thus no value of x satisﬁes (ii).
Summarising, 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1 when −2 < x ≤−1

Problem 9.
Solve the inequality: t2 >9
Since t2 >9 then t2 −9>0, i.e. (t +3)(t −3)>0 by
factorising.
For (t +3)(t −3) to be positive,
either
(i) (t +3)>0 and (t −3)>0
or (ii) (t +3)<0 and (t −3)<0
(i)
If (t+3)>0 then t >−3 and if (t −3)>0 then
t >3
Both of these are true only when t > 3
(ii)
If (t +3)<0 then t <−3 and if (t −3)<0 then
t <3
Both of these are true only when t < −3

i.e.
z > 1 or z < −2
Problem 12.
Solve the inequality: t2 <9
Since t2 <9 then t2 −9<0, i.e. (t +3)(t −3)<0 by fac-
torising.
For (t +3)(t −3) to be negative,
either
(i) (t +3)>0 and (t −3)<0
or (ii) (t +3)<0 and (t −3)>0
(i)
If (t +3)>0 then t >−3 and if (t −3)<0 then
t <3
Hence (i) is satisﬁed when t >−3 and t <3 which
may be written as: −3 < t < 3
(ii)
If (t +3)<0 then t <−3 and if (t −3)>0 then
t >3
It is not possible to satisfy both t <−3 and t >3,
thus no value of t satisﬁes (ii).
Summarising, t2<9 when −3 < t < 3 which means
that all values of t between −3 and +3 will satisfy the
inequality.

Quadratic inequalities
Inequalities involving quadratic expressions are solved
using either factorisation or ‘completing the square’.
For example,
x2 −2x −3 is factorised as (x +1)(x −3)
and 6x2 +7x −5 is factorised as (2x −1)(3x +5)
If a quadratic expression does not factorise, then the
technique of ‘completing the square’ is used. In general,
the procedure for x2 +bx+c is:

For example, x2 +4x −7 does not factorise; completing
the square gives:

406

Similarly,
x2 + 6x −5 ≡(x + 3)2 −5 −32 ≡(x −3)2 −14
Solving quadratic inequalities is demonstrated in the
following worked problems.
Problem 15.
Solve the inequality:
x2+2x −3>0
Since x2 +2x −3>0 then (x −1)(x +3)>0 by factor-
ising.
For the product (x −1)(x +3) to be positive,
either
(i) (x −1)>0 and (x +3)>0
or (ii) (x −1)<0 and (x +3)<0
(i)
Since (x −1)>0 then x >1 and since (x +3)>0
then x >−3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when
x>1
(ii)
Since (x −1)<0 then x <1 and since (x +3)<0
then x <−3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when

Problem 16.
Solve the inequality: t2 −2t −8<0
Since
t2 −2t −8<0
then

For the product (t −4)(t +2) to be negative,
either
(i) (t −4)>0 and (t +2)<0
or (ii) (t −4)<0 and (t +2)>0
(i)
Since (t −4)>0 then t >4 and since (t +2)<0
then t <−2
It is not possible to satisfy both t >4 and t <−2,
thus no value of t satisﬁes the inequality (i)
(ii)
Since (t −4)<0 then t <4 and since (t +2)>0
then t >−2
Hence, (ii) is satisﬁed when −2<t <4

Solve the inequality:

The inequality thus becomes: (x +3)2 −6<0 or

From equation (2), −

y2 −8y −10 does not factorise; completing the square

Graphs with
logarithmic scales
Why it is important to understand: Graphs with logarithmic scales
As mentioned in previous chapters, graphs are important tools for analysing and displaying data between
two experimental quantities and that many times situations occur in which the relationship between the
variables is not linear. By manipulation, a straight line graph may be plotted to produce a law relating
the two variables. Knowledge of logarithms may be used to simplify plotting the relation between one
variable and another. In particular, we consider those situations in which one of the variables requires
scaling because the range of its data values is very large in comparison to the range of the other variable.
Log-log and log-linear graph paper is available to make the plotting process easier.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand logarithmic scales
•
understand log-log and log-linear graph paper
•
plot a graph of the form y = axn using log-log graph paper and determine constants ‘a’ and ‘n’
•
plot a graph of the form y = a bx using log-linear graph paper and determine constants ‘a’ and ‘b’
•
plot a graph of the form y = aekx using log-linear graph paper and determine constants ‘a’ and ‘k’
39.1 Logarithmic scales and
logarithmic graph paper
Graph paper is available where the scale markings along
the horizontal and vertical axes are proportional to the
logarithms of the numbers. Such graph paper is called
log-log graph paper.
A logarithmic scale is shown in Fig. 39.1 where the dis-
tance between, say 1 and 2, is proportional to lg 2 −lg 1,
i.e. 0.3010 of the total distance from 1 to 10. Simi-
larly, the distance between 7 and 8 is proportional to
lg 8 −lg 7, i.e. 0.05799 of the total distance from 1 to
10. Thus the distance between markings progressively
decreases as the numbers increase from 1 to 10.

With log-log graph paper the scale markings are from 1
to 9, and this pattern can be repeated several times. The
number of times the pattern of markings is repeated on
an axis signiﬁes the number of cycles. When the vertical
axis has, say, 3 sets of values from 1 to 9, and the hori-
zontal axis has, say, 2 sets of values from 1 to 9, then this

log-log graph paper is called ‘log 3 cycle × 2 cycle’ (see
Fig. 39.2). Many different arrangements are available
ranging from ‘log 1 cycle × 1 cycle’ through to ‘log 5
cycle × 5 cycle’.
To depict a set of values, say, from 0.4 to 161, on an axis
of log-log graph paper, 4 cycles are required, from 0.1
to 1, 1 to 10, 10 to 100 and 100 to 1000.

Graphs of the form y = axn
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of
y = axn
gives:
lg y = lg(axn) = lg a + lg xn
i.e.
lg y = nlg x + lg a
which compares with
Y = mX + c
Thus, by plotting lg y vertically against lg x horizon-
tally, a straight line results, i.e. the equation y = axn
is reduced to linear form. With log-log graph paper
available x and y may be plotted directly, without hav-
ing ﬁrst to determine their logarithms, as shown in
Chapter 18.
Problem 1.
Experimental values of two related
quantities x and y are shown below:
x
0.41 0.63 0.92 1.36
2.17
3.95
y
0.45 1.21 2.89 7.10 20.79 82.46
The law relating x and y is believed to be y = axb,
where ‘a’ and ‘b’ are constants. Verify that this law
is true and determine the approximate values of ‘a’
and ‘b’
If y = axb then lg y = b lg x + lg a, from above, which
is of the form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a
straight line graph lg y is plotted vertically against lg x
horizontally. x and y may be plotted directly on to log-
log graph paper as shown in Fig. 39.2. The values of y
range from 0.45 to 82.46 and 3 cycles are needed (i.e.
0.1 to 1, 1 to 10 and 10 to 100). The values of x range
from 0.41 to 3.95 and 2 cycles are needed (i.e. 0.1 to 1
and 1 to 10). Hence ‘log 3 cycle × 2 cycle’ is used as
shown in Fig. 39.2 where the axes are marked and the
points plotted. Since the points lie on a straight line
the law y = axb is veriﬁed.
To evaluate constants ‘a’ and ‘b’:
Method 1. Any two points on the straight line, say
points A and C, are selected, and AB and BC are

BC = 11.5units

= 2.3
Since lg y = b lg x+ lg a, when x = 1, lg x = 0 and
lg y = lg a.
The straight line crosses the ordinate x = 1.0 at y = 3.5.
Hence, lg a = lg 3.5, i.e. a = 3.5
Method 2. Any two points on the straight line, say
points A and C, are selected. A has co-ordinates
(2, 17.25) and C has co-ordinates (0.5, 0.7).
Since
y = axb then 17.25 = a(2)b
(1)
and
0.7 = a(0.5)b
(2)
i.e. two simultaneous equations are produced and may
be solved for ‘a’ and ‘b’.
Dividing equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate ‘a’
gives:
17.25
0.7
= (2)b
(0.5)b =
 2
0.5

i.e.
24.643 = (4)b

Basic Engineering Mathematics
Taking logarithms of both sides gives:
lg 24.643 = b lg 4,
i.e.
b = lg 24.643
lg 4
= 2.3, correct to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Substituting b = 2.3 in equation (1) gives:
17.25 = a(2)2.3
i.e.
a = 17.25
(2)2.3 = 17.25
4.925
= 3.5, correct to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
Hence, the law of the graph is: y = 3.5x2.3

Prove that the law relating current and power is of
the form P = RI n, where R and n are constants,
and determine the law. Hence calculate the power
when the current is 12A and the current when the
power is 1000W.
Since P = RI n then lg P = n lg I + lg R, which is of
the form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight
line graph lg P is plotted vertically against lg I hori-
zontally. Power values range from 49 to 4290, hence 3
cycles of log-log graph paper are needed (10 to 100, 100
to 1000 and 1000 to 10000). Current values range from
1.4 to 13.1, hence 2 cycles of log-log graph paper are
needed (1 to 10 and 10 to 100). Thus ‘log 3 cycles ×
2 cycles’ is used as shown in Fig. 39.3 (or, if not avail-
able, graph paper having a larger number of cycles per
axis can be used).
The co-ordinates are plotted and a straight line results
which proves that the law relating current and power
is of the form P = RIn
Gradient of straight line, n = AB

At point C, I = 2 and P = 100. Substituting these

which may have been found from the intercept on the

Hence, the law of the graph is: P = 25I2
When current I = 12,
power P = 25(12)2 = 3600 watts (which may be read
from the graph).

Since p = cvn, then lg p = n lg v + lg c, which is of the
form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight
line graph lg p is plotted vertically against lg v hori-
zontally. The co-ordinates are plotted on ‘log 3 cycle×
2 cycle’ graph paper as shown in Fig. 39.4. With the
data expressed in standard form, the axes are marked in
standard form also. Since a straight line results the law
p = cvn is veriﬁed.

The straight line has a negative gradient and the value

Selecting any point on the straight line, say point C,
having co-ordinates (2.63 × 10−2,3 × 105), and substi-
tuting these values in p = cvn
gives:
3 × 105 = c(2.63 × 10−2)−1.4
Hence,

Graphs of the form y = abx
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of
y = abx
gives:
lg y = lg (abx) = lg a + lg bx
= lg a + xlg b
i.e.
lg y = (lg b)x + lg a
which compares with
Y = mX + c
Thus, by plotting lg y vertically against x horizontally
a straight line results, i.e. the graph y = abx is reduced
to linear form. In this case, graph paper having a linear
horizontal scale and a logarithmic vertical scale may be
used.Thistypeofgraph paperiscalledlog-lineargraph

the logarithmic scale. For example, graph paper having
3 cycles on the logarithmic scale is called ‘log 3 cycle

Verify the law and determine the approximate
values of ‘a’ and ‘b’. Hence evaluate (i) the value of
y when x is 2.5, and (ii) the value of x when y is
1200.
Since y = abx then lg y = (lg b)x + lg a (from above),
which is of the form Y = mX + c, showing that to
produce a straight line graph lg y is plotted vertically
against x horizontally.Usinglog-lineargraphpaper,val-
ues of x are marked on the horizontal scale to cover the
range 0.7 to 4.3. Values of y range from 18.4 to 1850
and 3 cycles are needed (i.e. 10 to 100, 100 to 1000
and 1000 to 10000). Thus, using ‘log 3 cycles × linear’
graph paper the points are plotted as shown in Fig. 39.5.
A straight line is drawn through the co-ordinates,
hence the law y = abx is veriﬁed.
Gradient of straight line, lg b = AB/BC. Direct mea-
surement (say in centimetres) is not made with log-

Point A has co-ordinates (3.82,1000).

i.e.
a =

Hence, the law of the graph is: y = 7.5(3.6)x

When x = 2.5, y = 7.5(3.6)2.5 = 184

ln y = kx + lna
since
lne = 1
which compares with
