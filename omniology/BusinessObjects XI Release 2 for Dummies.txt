Authors’ Acknowledgments
Derek Torres: I want to thank my partners in crime, Stuart Mudie, Julie
Albaret, and Patrick Albaret. It was a great team effort to pull this one
together. I’d also like to thank our Executive Editor, Greg Croy, for his
patience — we probably made him endure far more than he anticipated when
he signed on for this project! I’d also like to thank our agent Lynn Haller for
her hard work in selling this title. Thanks to everyone at Wiley past and pre-
sent, including our Project Editor, Rebecca Senninger, and Jody Lefevere.
Thanks to my friends and associates, past and present, at Business Objects.
Thanks finally to my family for lending me to my laptop and publisher.
Stuart Mudie: Thanks to Justine and Ellie, for everything; my parents Marion
and Bill Mudie, for encouraging me to dream, and then — most importantly —
to follow those dreams; my brother Craig and his wife Leona, for giving me an
excuse to break off from the writing of this book to be best man at their wed-
ding; my co-authors Derek Torres and Julie Albaret, for their friendship over
the years, and for joining me on this journey; Alan Daifuku, for hiring me to
work at Business Objects in the first place, and for bringing me to live in
France; my agent, Lynn Haller, for her hard work and dedication; our out-
standing technical editor Patrick Albaret, for making everything clear; our
Acquisitions Editor Greg Croy and our Project Editor Rebecca Senninger, for
keeping us on the right track; and all the other fine folks at Wiley.
Julie Albaret: Thanks to Patrick, Stuart, and Derek for bringing me on this
rich adventure; my family for their support and encouragement; my school
EISTI friends and my coworkers at SQLI, Business Objects and Advanced-
Schema, with whom I share the same passion and from whom I learnt and 
am still learning so much.

Introduction
B
usinessObjects XI Release 2 is an industry-leading suite of tools for
reporting, query-and-analysis, performance management, and informa-
tion management. The tools that make up the suite allow you to access,
format, and share data, as well as analyze the information this data contains
and measure your organization’s performance.
About This Book
For new users, business intelligence can seem dauntingly complex.
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 For Dummies is an introductory-level book 
that helps you get started viewing and creating reports, building powerful
queries on your organization’s database, and measuring your company’s 
performance — all without bombarding you with industry jargon and overly
complex technical explanations.
The authors of this book have a combined experience of over 15 years of
working with BusinessObjects tools; many of those years were spent working
for the Business Objects company at its Paris headquarters. We combine and
simplify — in a single book — what the official user documentation spreads
across a large number of electronic manuals.
Foolish Assumptions
We wrote this book with certain assumptions in mind:
 You’ve recently encountered the BusinessObjects suite for the first time
and are trying to get to grips with it, or that you want to take your
knowledge of the system to the next level.
 You have a general familiarity with the personal computer, and you
know your way around a basic user interface such as the one found in
Microsoft Word — but at no time do we take it for granted that you are a
technical expert.

 We also suspect that you probably won’t read this book from cover to
cover, at least not in one sitting (although there’s nothing to stop you
from doing so if you feel the urge). Rather, we expect you’re more likely
to jump from chapter to chapter, to dig around, and to use it as a quick
reference when performing a task you haven’t done in a while.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains eight major parts. Each part consists of several chapters.
Part I: Getting Started with
BusinessObjects
Part I introduces you to some key Business Intelligence concepts. It goes on
to look at the tools that make up the core of the BusinessObjects suite, and
then walks you through installing them — both on a single computer and on
a server — to the point where you’re ready to roll your sleeves up, get stuck
in, and use them. Finally, it takes a look at the Central Management Console
(CMC), the Web-based administration tool you use to manage your
BusinessObjects installation once everything is in place.
Part II: Universes
Universes are at the heart of any BusinessObjects system. Part II tells you
what they are (hint: they’re made of numbers, not stars), how to create one,
and how to work with its different dimensions. Don’t worry; it’s less meta-
physical than it sounds!
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting
Part III explains how you can use the BusinessObjects desktop reporting tool
to query, analyze data, and build reports. The desktop reporting tool is the
actual BusinessObjects software installed on your computer, affectionately
known to many users as DeskI. Think of it as the non-Web-based
BusinessObjects.

Part IV: Making Web Intelligence 
Work for You
In Part IV, you find out all about InfoView, the Web-based portal that lets 
you work with your reports and access your organization’s data online. 
For most users, InfoView is the “public face” of BusinessObjects — offering
all the desktop reporting features over a Web browser and allowing you 
to create reports from anywhere with an Internet connection. If you’re 
using BusinessObjects, you’re more likely to work with InfoView than any
other tool.
Part V: Keeping Track of How 
Your Organization Is Doing
In Part V, we cover how to use dashboards, analytics, and other tools and
methodologies to measure your organization’s performance against strategy.
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible 
Data with Data Marts
In Part VI, you discover what data marts are and how they fit into your
BusinessObjects system.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Part VII contains several short lists of useful information — including tips on
how to prepare for a successful Business Objects integration, and a list of
helpful resources beyond the pages of this book.
Part VIII: Appendixes
We close the book with our appendixes, which include an overview of Crystal
Reports, BusinessObjects’ companion reporting tool, and a glossary.

Part I
Getting Started
with
BusinessObjects

In this part. . .
U
ndoubtedly, you’re itching to get started. But as you
probably know if you’ve taken the trouble to pick up
this book in the first place, business intelligence can be a
complex subject and it’s worth taking the time to find your
bearings a little before getting started with BusinessObjects
With this in mind, Chapter 1 gives you a general introduc-
tion to the world of business intelligence and some of its
key concepts, before going on to look at how you can use
BI applications and technologies to help you and your
organization make better business decisions, and pro-
vides a brief overview of all the different products that
make up the BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise
product suite.
Part I then walks you through the steps involved in
installing BusinessObjects, both on your local machine
(Chapter 2) and, as is more typically the case, on a 
server (Chapter 3).
Chapter 4 introduces you to the workings of the Central
Management Console (CMC), a Web-based system admin-
istration tool that lets you manage user profiles, security
and access rights once your system is up and running.

 Discovering how business intelligence can help your business
 Delving into BusinessObjects XI Release 2
B
efore you roll your sleeves up and get running with BusinessObjects 
XI Release 2, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the bigger picture.
At the beginning of this chapter, we give you an overview of business 
intelligence, and show how you can use business intelligence applications
and technologies to help you make better business decisions.
If your business has been running Crystal Enterprise or BusinessObjects,
you’re probably faced with having to upgrade — specifically, to
BusinessObjects XI. If so, welcome to some enhanced capabilities. If 
not — if you’re just starting out with Business Objects XI — welcome to a
whole new business universe. The last half of this chapter provides an
overview of the different components that make up the BusinessObjects XI
Release 2 Enterprise product suite — and offers some pointers on finding the
right tools for the job — both for the migration and the projects to follow.
Fitting Business Intelligence 
into Your Business
Business intelligence (BI) is a business management term for the tools and
methodologies used to collect, provide access to, and analyze data (which, in
a typical organization, usually means information about a firm’s operations
such as details of sales, production, or human resources).

Business intelligence lets you keep track of what’s going on in your company.
It provides you with timely and pertinent insight so you can measure your
performance against your company’s established goals, and take action at a
time when it is still possible for you to influence the outcome. Best of all, it
lets you do it all yourself, rather than having to depend on IT professionals to
provide you with the data you need at a time that suits their schedule.
Put simply, BI lets you make better business decisions because it gives you
access to the right information at the right time.
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 has four main functional areas, which allow you
to track, understand, and manage your business: 
 Reporting: Reporting, as its name suggests, enables you to format and
deliver information to large audiences both inside and outside your
organization in the form of reports.
 Query and analysis: Query and analysis tools provide you with a means
of interacting with business information (by performing your own ad
hoc queries) without having to understand the often complex data that
lies underneath this information.
 Performance management: Performance management tools let you
keep track of and analyze key performance indicators and goals using
Dashboards, Scorecards, and Analytics.
 Data integration: Data integration lets you extract information from a
range of sources and transform it so that it becomes usable by your
other BI tools, data marts, and data warehouses.

Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 
Life before business intelligence
In the beginning was the data, and the data was
hidden away somewhere deep in the bowels of
the corporate databases where only an elite of
highly trained users were able to reach it.
If you needed access to any of this data to do
your job effectively, the only way to get at it was
to beg one of those highly trained elite users for
help. But when your query finally made its way
to the top of Mr. Elite User’s in-tray, often sev-
eral months later, the information that trickled
down to you in the form of a spreadsheet or
even a printed report would be horrendously
out-of-date. As for whether Mr. Elite User was
likely to understand your business requirements
in the first place and so avoid supplying you with
wrong (or at best irrelevant) information. . . well,
you’re better off not even going there.
“Timely? Pertinent? I’m sorry, we don’t do those.
Can I interest you in these global sales figures
from the first quarter of last year instead?”

Taking a Closer Look at BusinessObjects
XI Release 2 Enterprise
In this section, we take a look at some of the different members of the
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise family.
At first glance, BusinessObjects seems to offer a confusing range of tools 
that do the same job. But at least for the immediate future, there’s a good
reason for the overlap in product functionality: Crystal Enterprise and
BusinessObjects were originally different products. Check out the sidebar 
“A tale of two products” to find out more.
Tools for migrating from 
previous installations
Which tools you’ll need for the migration depends mainly on whether you’re
coming from a BusinessObjects or Crystal environment. Be patient, and
follow the ancient wisdom that says Get the right tool (or, in this case, wizard)
for the job.
Import Wizard
The Import Wizard (see Figure 1-1) is a locally installed Windows appli-
cation used by administrators to import user accounts, groups, reports, 
and folders from Crystal Enterprise, BusinessObjects, or Crystal Info into
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise. You can also use the wizard to move
a test deployment of BusinessObjects XI to a production environment.

Chapter 1: Business Intelligence and BusinessObjects XI Release 2
A tale of two products
BusinessObjects XI has illustrious ancestors:
Both Crystal Enterprise and Business Objects
products brought efficient, interactive reporting
to databases — and a host of other tools that
helped lay the foundation for what we now call
business intelligence. Then their powers com-
bined: Business Objects and Crystal Enterprise
merged in late 2003 — and BusinessObjects XI
fully integrated the features of both companies’
products. 
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 has been around
since 2005; about a year and a half later, an
update appeared: BusinessObjects XI Release 2
Productivity Pack. That’s the subject of this
book. And a formidable — though sometimes
confusing — toolbox it is.

In BusinessObjects XI Release 2, the Import Wizard supports upgrades from
these existing implementations:
 BusinessObjects 5.1.4 and above 
 BusinessObjects 6.0, 6.1, and 6.5
 Crystal Enterprise 8.5, 9, and 10
 Application Foundation 6.1.b, 6.1.3, and 6.5.1
 BusinessObjects XI (if you haven’t installed the Productivity Pack 
until now)
You can also administrate remote servers from the Import Wizard.
Repository Migration Wizard
The Repository Migration Wizard has a much more specific use than the
Import Wizard: It’s used solely to migrate a Report Design Repository from
previous versions of Crystal Enterprise Server into the BusinessObjects XI
Release 2 repository.
The repository is the database server that stores all the information about
your BusinessObjects system and its users.
Data Source Migration Wizard
The Data Source Migration Wizard lets you migrate reports based on Crystal
queries, dictionaries, and InfoViews to BusinessObjects Enterprise XI.
Figure 1-1:

and

Objects

10
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

The Data Source Migration Wizard has a slightly misleading name, because
you can use it to migrate two types of objects: data sources and reports. 
It works by converting the data source for each report into an object that 
can be used in BusinessObjects Enterprise, and then resetting the report’s
data-source location so it points to the new object.
Report Conversion Tool
Okay, the Report Conversion Tool is not (strictly speaking) a migration 
tool — but you can use it to convert Desktop Intelligence reports to the Web
Intelligence format — and then publish the converted reports — so it does
serve as a bridge between technologies. It can convert the following types 
of report to the Web Intelligence XI Release 2 (.wid) format:
 Legacy BusinessObjects reports (.rep) previously migrated to the
Desktop Intelligence (.rep) format using the Import Wizard.
 Desktop Intelligence reports created directly in the Desktop
Intelligence tool.
The Report Conversion Tool isn’t a panacea. It can’t convert all Desktop
Intelligence reports, nor all Desktop Intelligence features. Exactly what 
gets converted depends on the features of the original report; some features
prevent the report from being converted at all; other features may be 
modified or removed during the conversion process.
You can also use the Report Conversion Tool to open reports from previous
versions of the BusinessObjects desktop-reporting tool directly in Desktop
Intelligence. However, to be sure that you take full advantage of the product’s
security features, you’re better off using the Import Wizard to import your
legacy reports.
All it takes to design a universe
As we explain in Part III, the concept of a universe (in effect, a collection 
of business objects) lies at the heart of any BusinessObjects XI Release 2
installation. When it comes to building and managing these universes, you
have a couple of different tools at your disposal.
Designer
Business Objects Designer is the tool that enables BusinessObjects XI users
to create universes (see Figure 1-2).
The person who creates business universes is called (believe it or not) a 
universe designer. Depending on the situation at your company, this person
may be the database administrator, a programmer, a project manager, or 
even a report creator who has sufficient technical skills to create universes
for other users.
11
Chapter 1: Business Intelligence and BusinessObjects XI Release 2

Whatever the purpose of the larger universe may be, the purpose of a 
business universe is to let nontechnical users run queries against a database
in order to create reports and analyze data. Its simple interface is designed 
to provide a business-focused front end to make the SQL structures in the
database more easily understandable, using vocabulary that’s familiar to
business users.
Universe Builder
Universe Builder is another tool that you use for — you guessed it — building
business universes. How it differs from Designer mainly concerns whether 
or not your metadata source was compatible with BusinessObjects XI
Release 2 at the time it was released. If it was, you’re probably better off
building your Universes with Designer. If not, use Universe Builder instead.
For more information on the specifics of Universe Designer, see Chapter 5.
BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence
BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence is a desktop reporting tool that 
allows you to analyze data, perform ad-hoc queries to fetch new data, and
create new reports of your own. Now a feature of BusinessObjects XI, it was
previously known as BusinessObjects — a stand-alone flagship product. It
makes a seriously powerful desktop tool.
Figure 1-2:

Quick
Design
Wizard in

12
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Using a desktop tool instead of a permanent network connection gives you a
handy advantage by freeing up your IT resources as you use less bandwidth.
Part III explains the workings of BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence in 
more detail.
BusinessObjects Web Intelligence
Sometimes, having to open a full-client application just isn’t the most 
convenient way of working, especially if your machine isn’t powerful enough
for the job.
Fortunately, BusinessObjects also features a tool that makes it possible 
for you to perform a range of query and reporting tasks directly from a
browser-based interface: BusinessObjects Web Intelligence.
Part IV looks in more detail at how Web Intelligence works.
Enterprise Performance Management
Although Desktop Intelligence and Web Intelligence are powerful tools in
their own right, there may still come a time when you want to move on from
the reports they let you build and take your use of the BusinessObjects XI
suite to the next level.
Part V describes how you can use the suite’s Performance Management tools
to create more complex dashboards, metrics, and analytics that allow you to
keep track of how your organization is doing.
Publishing Wizard
The Publishing Wizard lets you add new documents to BusinessObjects XI
Release 2 Enterprise. You can assign object rights to specific BusinessObjects
Enterprise folders — allowing you to control who publishes what, and where
(within the company, anyway).
Although the Publishing Wizard is a Windows application, you can use it to
publish reports to servers running on both Windows or Unix.
13
Chapter 1: Business Intelligence and BusinessObjects XI Release 2

InfoView
Consider InfoView your company’s business intelligence portal. As a 
browser-based tool, InfoView is the main interface for most users who work
with objects in BusinessObjects XI Release 2. You can use InfoView to view,
manage, and work with your organization’s different business-intelligence
objects — including Crystal reports, Web Intelligence documents, and
Desktop Intelligence documents, as well as the suite’s Enterprise
Performance Management tools.
Part IV looks at InfoView in more detail.
Central Management Console
The Central Management Console (CMC), shown in Figure 1-3, is the Web
interface that lets you or your administrator control and make best use of
your BusinessObjects deployment. It enables you to carry out such tasks as
setting up user roles, server administration, managing passwords, and more.
Chapter 4 examines this tool more closely.

 Checking the minimum requirements
 Installing BusinessObjects Enterprise on your computer
T
ypically (as you might suspect), BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise
is not to be found on just any old home computer. Most end users 
interact with the tools that make up this product suite over the Web, using
InfoView. However, the following client tools are also available as stand-alone
applications you can install on your local PC:
 BusinessObjects Designer: Enables you to create Universes (which
requires fewer superpowers than you may think).
 Desktop Intelligence: Allows you to analyze data, perform ad-hoc
queries to fetch new data, and create reports. Often referred to as DeskI.
 Publishing Wizard: Makes it easier for you to add new documents to
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise.
 Business Views Manager: A tool from the Crystal Reports world that lets
you build Business Views — objects that give report designers and end
users access to specific types of business information.
 Import Wizard: Used by administrators to import user accounts,
groups, reports, and folders from Crystal Enterprise, BusinessObjects,
or Crystal Info into BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise.
 Report Conversion Tool: Lets you convert Deski reports to the Web
Intelligence (WebI) format, and then publish them.
 SDKs: Used by developers to integrate Business Objects products into
other applications.
In this chapter, we show you how to install these applications locally if you’re
responsible for developing applications or migrating data, or if you manage
BusinessObjects Enterprise content.

Making Sure You’re Ready
To run BusinessObjects XI R2 — even if all you want to do is install the client
software on your local PC — you need a pretty decent (and recent) machine.
Forget about trying to put BusinessObjects XI R2 on that old laptop that the
IT department has had hanging around for the last five years; it just won’t 
be powerful enough.
To run BusinessObjects Enterprise XI R2 effectively, your computer must
meet the following minimum hardware requirements:
 Pentium III 700 MHz
 1GB of RAM
 5GB hard-drive space
 CD-ROM drive (unless you are installing directly from a network)
In addition, you must be running one of the following operating systems:
Windows 2000 SP4 Professional
Windows XP SP1 Professional
Windows XP SP2 Professional
Windows 2000 SP4 Advanced Server
Windows 2000 SP4 Datacenter 
Windows 2000 SP4 Server

We recommend not running BusinessObjects XI R2 with Windows Vista. You
might get BusinessObjects XI R2 to run on Vista, but Business Objects won’t
give you any help if you run into problems.

Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Installing BusinessObjects Enterprise 
on Your Computer
After you determine that your computer is up to the task, you are ready to
get down to the nitty-gritty of actually installing the product. Sit back, hold
tight, and follow these steps:
1. Insert the installation CD (or DVD) in your CD-ROM drive (or browse
to the location on your network where the installation files are 
stored, and then click the Setup.exe file).
The Installation Wizard runs automatically; you’re given a choice 
of languages (a quite impressive 12 at the time of writing) in which to
install the product, and links to other relevant reading material (as
shown in Figure 2-1).
2. (Optional) Choose a language from the menu on the left. 
You are then presented with links to a whole host of reading material,
including the Installation Guide and the Release Notes, the Education
and Consulting pages on the Business Objects Web site, and the
Technical Support Web site.
Figure 2-1:

Chapter 2: Deploying on a Single Computer

3. Click Install.
You are greeted with a Welcome Screen that invites you to exit all
Windows programs you may have running before continuing with Setup. 
4. When you’ve closed all Windows programs, click Next.
The License Agreement appears.
5. Read the License Agreement (you do read those things, don’t you?),
select the I Accept the License Agreement option button, and then
click Next.
On the following screen, you’re presented with a choice between 
performing a Client Installation and a Server Installation, as shown in
Figure 2-2. 
Because you’re installing BusinessObjects on your computer, the Client
Installation, which installs Designer, Desktop Intelligence, Publishing
Wizard, Business Views Manager, Import Wizard, Report Conversation
Tools, and SDKs, is what you’re interested in.
6. Select the Perform Client Installation option button, and then 
click Next.
The next screen invites you to specify the folder where you want to
install the software, as shown in Figure 2-3.
7. Choose to accept the default option (C:\Program Files\Business
Objects\) or click the Browse button to select an existing directory
or create a new one. In either case, click Next when you’re done.
Figure 2-2:

The final screen offers you one last chance to go back and change any 
of the details, as shown in Figure 2-4; or, more precisely, a chance to
click the Cancel button and start over from scratch! (If you’re a Business
Objects User Interface designer, a summary of what those details are
would have been nice to see at this point!)
8. If you can remember what options you selected and you’re completely
certain they correspond to what you want to do, click Next.
Now you can sit back while the software is installed. When everything 
is ready, the final screen of the installation wizard informs you that the
installation is complete. You’re good to go!

Performing a Server Installation
In This Chapter
 Making sure you’re ready
 Installing BusinessObjects Enterprise on your server
A
lthough (as Chapter 2 describes) you can install some of the client 
tools that make up the BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise product
suite on your local PC, the fact is, you’re far more likely to install the suite 
on a server. Then you can allow several, several dozen, or several hundred
users to connect to these tools remotely over the Web.
This chapter describes how you perform such an installation — first by
ensuring that you have everything in place before you start, and then by
taking you through each of the steps involved.
Making Sure You’re Ready
Before you go anywhere near that shiny installation DVD, you must first
examine the system you already have in place: Ensure that it meets 
the minimum requirements for running a server-based installation of the
BusinessObects XI R2 product suite.
Minimum requirements
To run BusinessObjects Enterprise XI R2 effectively, your server must meet
the following minimum hardware requirements:
 Pentium III 700 MHz
 1GB of RAM
 5GB hard-drive space (plus 1.5GB for the Performance Management 
feature)
 CD-ROM drive (unless you’re installing directly from a network)

You must also be running one of the following operating systems.

The computer you’re setting up as your server needs to have both an 
application-server program and compatible database software that can store
information about the system and its users. Ideally, these should be in place
before you start installing the BusinessObjects software, but you can always
install them as part of the BusinessObjects installation process. The upcom-
ing sections describe these two requirements in more detail.
Choosing an application server
The machine on which you plan to install and run BusinessObjects XI R2
must have an application-server program up and running before you do the
installation. Fortunately, BusinessObjects supports a range of application
servers; while you’re deciding which one to use, take a good look at your 
current environment:
 Note which application servers you currently have in place.
 If you intend to develop custom applications, decide which 
Web-development environment you want to use.
22
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

If you don’t have an application server already in place on your server 
computer, BusinessObjects comes with one on your installation CD: Tomcat,
which you can install along with BusinessObjects. Indeed, when we walk 
you through the installation process later in this chapter, we assume you’re
doing just that.
The first question you need to address is which development environment —
the programming language or languages you intend to use to develop your
custom Web applications — you want to work in.
As it happens, the choice is pretty simple: Active Server Pages (ASP) or its
more recent successor ASP.NET or JavaServer Pages (JSP). Be aware that
whichever option you go for also affects, or is influenced by, your choice of
application servers (the machine hosting your Web applications): 
 If you want to develop your custom applications using ASP or ASP.NET,
you must use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).
 If you want to develop your custom applications using JSP, you can
choose any of the supported application servers shown in Table 3-1.
(Tomcat is one of those.)
Examining the relative merits of the ASP and JSP environments is beyond the
scope of this book. A simple Web search will reveal scores of sites that
debate the benefits of one or the other; if you don’t have your own opinion
on the matter already, we’re pretty sure you will before long. Nonetheless, it’s
worth noting that certain features — including support for DHTML in Web
Intelligence, and Enterprise Performance Management capabilities — are only
available in the JSP version.

Chapter 3: Performing a Server Installation

Database software: Repository 
of all knowledge . . .
. . . at least that’s the way BusinessObjects XI R2 sees the database 
software it uses to store information about the system and its users. You
have to have a database program installed on your computer before you
install BusinessObjects. The Central Management Server (CMS) feature of
BusinessObjects interacts with this database program, which serves as 
the CMS database; Chapter 4 details how you can access and manage it.
BusinessObjects also includes Enterprise Auditor, a tool that enables you to
monitor and record key information about the usage of your BusinessObjects
deployment. If you want to use it, however, you need to have yet another
database — this one specifically dedicated to Auditor — in place.
BusinessObjects XI R2 supports a range of databases, including Microsoft SQL
Server 2000 SP3, Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 SP4, Oracle9.2, Oracle10.1, IBM DB2,
Sybase ASE, Sybase AS IQ, and NCR Teradata. For details of exactly what is
currently supported, we suggest you consult the Business Objects Web site:
www.businessobjects.com/pdf/products/xi/boe_xi_supported_
platforms.pdf. Be warned: It’s a pretty long and complicated list!
If you don’t have a database-server program already in place on your server
computer, Business Objects helps you out: You can install MySQL as part of
the BusinessObjects XI R2 installation process.
Installing BusinessObjects 
XI R2 on Your Server
After you have all the prerequisites in place for installing BusinessObjects XI
R2, you’re ready to get down to the installation process proper. Follow these
steps to do so:
24
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 
What’s in a name?
In prior releases of BusinessObjects (before
BusinessObjects XI), the database at the heart
of the system was called the repository, and
when Crystal Enterprise was a stand-alone
product, the Central Management Server used
to be known as the Crystal Management Server
or Automated Process Scheduler (APS).

1. Insert the installation CD (or DVD) in your CD-ROM drive or browse 
to the location on your network where the installation files are stored;
then click Setup.exe.
The Installation Wizard runs automatically; you’re given a choice of 
languages in which to install the product (a quite impressive 12 at the
time of writing), as shown in Figure 3-1.
2. (Optional) Choose a language from the menu on the left.
You’re presented with links to a whole host of reading material, includ-
ing the Installation Guide and the Release Notes, the Education and
Consulting pages on the Business Objects Web site, and the Technical
Support Web site.
3. Click Install to get the installation process under way.
A Welcome Screen appears, inviting you to exit all Windows programs
you may have running before continuing with Setup. 
4. Close all Windows programs, and then click Next.
5. Read the License Agreement, click the I Accept the License Agreement
option button, and then click Next.
You’re presented with a choice between performing a Client Installation
and a Server Installation, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Because you’re installing BusinessObjects on a server, what you want is
(unsurprisingly) the Server Installation. It installs all components,
including the client SDK.
Figure 3-1:

6. Select the Perform Server Installation option button, and then 
click Next.
You’re asked to enter your user information (full name and organization)
and the product keycode, as shown in Figure 3-3.
7. Enter your full name, organization, and product keycode. Choose
whether to install Performance Management. Click Next.
Performance Management is a series of more advanced tools, which we
examine more closely in Part V, that you can use to create dashboards,
metrics, and analytics to track how your organization is performing.

Only the product keycode is mandatory. Ask your BusinessObjects
administrator for it if you don’t know what your keycode is.
Now you’re ready to specify the folder into which you want to install the
software, as shown in Figure 3-4. 
8. Choose to accept the default option (C:\Program Files\Business
Objects\); click Browse if you want to select an existing directory 
(or you can create a new one). Click Next when you’re done.
9. Choose the type of installation you want to perform by checking the
appropriate check box, and then click Next.
Figure 3-5 shows these available options:
• New: Installs a standard set of both client and server components
from the BusinessObjects XI R2 suite. 
If you choose this option, you must also specify whether you
intend to use an existing database server, or install a MySQL 
database server as part of the installation process.
• Expand: Lets you add additional components to an existing 
installation.
• Custom: Lets you specify exactly which components you want 
to install, as shown in Figure 3-6.
For the purposes of these steps, choose to perform a New installation,
and to install MySQL as your database server at the same time.

by clicking Browse and then browsing to a new location.
b. Type the Connection, Shutdown, and Redirect port numbers.
We recommend accepting the default port numbers proposed by the
installer; for more information about what these ports do, consult the
Tomcat documentation.
The final screen gives you one last opportunity to go back and change
any of the details (or rather, to cancel the installation and start over);
unfortunately, the installer doesn’t provide you with a summary of just
what those details are.

B
usinessObjects XI Release 2, as you may have noticed, provides a 
pretty complex suite of reporting, query and analysis, and performance-
management tools. Such a broad range of products clearly has to cater 
to the needs of a variety of different user profiles, while at the same time 
handling security and access rights that become ever more complex as your
system grows.
Fortunately, the suite comes with a tool designed to help you (or your system
administrator) face up to all this complexity — straight from an easy-to-use
Web interface. That tool is the Central Management Console (CMC), and this
chapter takes a look at how it works.
Knowing Your Rights: The
BusinessObjects Security Model
Before you dive straight in to the workings of the Central Management
Console (CMC), you need a clear understanding of the BusinessObjects 
XI R2 security model and how it lets you manage what users can and 
cannot do.

Objects, groups, and users
Three key concepts you need to retain when thinking about the
BusinessObjects security model are objects, groups, and users. Sure, 
these names may be familiar to you from other contexts, but it’s still 
worth reviewing their usage in the BusinessObjects system: 
 Objects: Objects lie at the heart of the BusinessObjects system. They
gave their name not only to the product, but to the company itself.
In BusinessObjects XI R2, objects can include reports, Web Intelligence
documents, Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint), Adobe
Acrobat PDFs, text files, hyperlinks, folders, and more.
In the CMC, you manage objects in (surprise!) the Objects Management
area.
 Groups: A group is a logical grouping of individuals who all require 
similar rights and permissions. Combining them in this way allows 
you to make any changes to their rights and permissions in one place
instead of having to modify each user’s account individually.
Examples of groups could include specific roles (such as the group 
of people responsible for designing BusinessObjects universes) or 
particular departments or teams (such as managers in the Accounts
Department).
 Users: A user is each individual person who needs to interact with the
BusinessObjects system in some way.
How it all hangs together
How do these different elements combine in the BusinessObjects security
model? It’s quite simple. You assign rights to each item in the system —
objects, users, and other features — which determine the individual actions
that users can perform on each particular item. And that’s it!
For example, if you want to allow managers in a certain team to access all 
the reports stored in a particular folder, you browse to the Rights tab for the
folder in question, and then add the group to which these managers belong
to the list of those who are allowed to access the folder.
Of course, it isn’t quite as simple as that — there are different kinds of rights
you can assign to items, for instance — but that’s the basic idea. 
32
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Rights are set on objects and folders, not on the people who will access
them. If you set the rights on the Rights tab of a specific group of managers,
for example, then you are determining which groups can access this group 
of managers (taken as an object), not what this group of managers can
access. This is an important distinction.
Discovering the Central 
Management Console
Okay, you know the theory (or at least some of it) and you’re ready to get
started and do some real work with the CMC. We show you how to launch the
Central Management Console and give you a tour of the home page.
Launching the CMC
To launch the CMC, do the following:
1. Choose All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪
BusinessObjects Enterprise➪BusinessObjects Enterprise Java
Administration Launchpad.
We assume you’re using the JSP version of BusinessObjects. If you’re
using ASP, replace BusinessObjects Enterprise Java Administration
Launchpad with BusinessObjects Enterprise .NET Administration
Launchpad.
You can also access the CMC directly from your Web browser. If 
you’re using the JSP version, simply type http://Webserver:8080/
businessobjects/enterprise115/adminlaunch/launchpad.html
in the address bar of your browser, where Webserver is the name of the
Web server machine. For the ASP version, type http://Webserver/
businessobjects/Enterprise115/WebTools/adminlaunch/
default.aspx.
A new browser window opens (see Figure 4-1).
2. Click the Launch the Central Management Console link.
3. Enter your User Name and Password, and then click Log On.
Provided your account has sufficient rights to access the Central
Management Console (basically, if you have at least some administration
rights), the CMC home page opens, and you’re good to go.
33
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

The CMC Home Page
Figure 4-2 shows the CMC Home Page. Take a good look. If you’re going to be
carrying out administration tasks in BusinessObjects — creating, organizing
and removing folders, managing users and user groups, scheduling events,
and more — this is where it all happens. As likely as not, you’ll be seeing
quite a bit of this page.
The CMC Home Page is broken down into three main areas: 
 Organize: This area is where you interact with folders, objects, groups,
users, servers, and so on, in a brave attempt to keep everything in order.
 Define: The Define area is where you set up scheduled events. 
Figure 4-2:
The CMC
Home Page.
Figure 4-1:
Launching
the Central
Management
Console.
34
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

 Manage: The Manage area is where you handle the settings for the 
different BusinessObjects applications, license keys, and enable trusted
authentication (users can log on once per session, rather than repeatedly
whenever they open a new application).
The tasks you can perform from the CMC Home Page are legion, and we could
fill this book on just that topic. Rather, we prefer to concentrate on managing
users, and assigning them rights to the different objects that make up the
whole system. Rest assured, that in itself is complex enough.
Managing Users
This section looks at some of the tasks involved in creating, managing, and
deleting user accounts, and shows you how to access the tools that make up
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 suite.
When you install the BusinessObjects system, the install process creates two
user accounts by default:
 Administrator: The Administrator account belongs to two groups:
Administrators and Everyone. An administrator can perform all tasks in
each BusinessObjects application installed. By default, the Administrator
account is not assigned a password, but quite clearly you should assign
one straight away.
 Guest: The Guest account belongs to one group: Everyone. By default,
the Guest account is not assigned a password.
Adding a new user account
When it comes to managing users, one of the most common tasks you may 
be required to carry out is to create a new user account — for example, when
a new employee joins your organization.
To add a new account, follow these steps:
1. Click the Users button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click New User.
3. When asked to specify the authentication type, select Enterprise.
The New User page appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
4. Fill out all the relevant information for this account, including
account name, full name, e-mail address, and description.
Note that only the account name is mandatory; all the other fields 
are optional.
35
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

When filling out the user details, you can also use the description 
area to include any extra information about the user or account you 
are creating.
5. Enter the password for the account and check the relevant password
options:
• Password never expires: The password you set remains valid for as
long as the account exists.
• User must change password at next logon: You set a password, which
may well be the standard password used across your company 
for first-time access to all applications, and the user then changes
this password to one of her own choice the first time she logs on.
• User cannot change password: You set the password, and that’s it —
the user doesn’t get any say in the matter! 
6. Select the connection type.
The type of BusinessObjects XI Release 2 license your organization has
dictates which connection type you should use: 
• Concurrent User: Choose this type if your license specifies a certain
number of users who can connect at the same time. 
• Named User: Choose this type if the user has an individual license
in her own name.
7. Click OK.
The new user is added to the system, by default in the Everyone group.
Figure 4-3:
Creating a
new user
account.
36
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Adding users to groups
A user that does not belong to any groups, and therefore does not have any
access rights, is not going to be very productive. This section describes how
to add a user to one or more groups.
You can add users to groups when the user is first created, or at any other
time as your needs evolve.
The CMC lets you add users to groups in one of two ways, each with a slight
difference in focus:
 In the Users management area of the CMC, you can add one user to one
or more groups.
 In the Groups management area of the CMC, you can add one or more
users to one group.
Adding one user to one or more groups
To add one user to one or more groups, for instance when a new employee
joins your company, follow these steps:
1. Click the Users button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Under Account Name, click the name of the user whose group 
membership you want to change.
3. Click the Member Of tab.
4. Click the Member Of button to view the groups available for this user
to join.
5. Select the group or groups you want the user to become a member 
of in the Available groups area. 
You can select multiple groups by Ctrl+clicking.
6. Once you’ve made your choice, click the > arrow to add the user 
to the group(s) selected, as shown in Figure 4-4.
7. Click OK. 
On the Member Of tab, you see a list of all the groups the user is a
member of. 
All users in the system are members of the Everyone group by default.
37
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

Adding several users to one group
To add one or more users to one group, for instance if you create a 
brand-new group and don’t want to have to go through the tiresome task 
of adding each user individually, follow these steps:
1. Click the Groups button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click the name of the group you want to assign the user(s) to.
3. Click the Users tab.
4. Click Add Users.
5. Select the user(s) you want to add to the group.
You can select multiple users by Ctrl+clicking.
6. Once you’ve made your choice, click the > arrow to add the user(s) 
to the group.
7. Click OK.
On the Users tab, you see a list of all the users who are members of this
group, as shown in Figure 4-5.
When adding users to a group, you can search for a specific user by entering
the user’s name in the Look For field.

Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Deleting a user account
All good things must come to an end. On that sad day when a user no longer
needs to access the BusinessObjects system, you can delete his or her
account as follows.
To delete a user account, follow these steps:
1. Click the Users button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Select the check box for the user you want to delete.
3. Click Delete.
4. When asked to confirm that you want to delete the account, click OK.
The account is deleted.
When you delete an account, it’s gone forever. If the user might need to
access the account again in the future, select the Account Is Disabled 
checkbox in the user’s Properties page instead.
Setting passwords
You can also use the CMC to manage password settings, both for an individ-
ual user and for all the users in the system. Note that any changes made
apply only to Enterprise accounts (that is, accounts managed from directly
within the BusinessObjects system). Nonetheless, if you are working with
accounts mapped to an external user database, such as Windows NT, LDAP,
or Windows AD, your external system should allow you to put similar 
restrictions in place.
Changing password or password settings for a single user
To change the password or password settings for one user at a time, for
instance if a user can’t remember his password, follow these steps:
1. Click the Users button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click the name of the user whose password settings you want 
to change.
3. On the Properties tab, in the Enterprise Password Settings area, type
and confirm the new password.
4. Select or clear the check box for any other password settings you
want to change:
• Password never expires
• User must change password at next logon
• User cannot change password
5. Click Update to apply your changes.
39
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

Changing password settings for every user
To change password settings for all users, for instance if your organization
changes its security policy to require user passwords to adhere to certain
characteristics, follow these steps
1. Click the Authentication button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click the Enterprise tab.
3. Select the check box for each password setting that you want to use,
providing a value where required, as shown in Figure 4-6.
• Password Restrictions: Require users to have passwords of a 
certain length, and/or containing both uppercase and lowercase
characters.
• User Restrictions: Oblige users to change at regular intervals, and
prevent them from using the same one or two passwords over and
over again.
• Logon Restrictions: Disable a user’s account after a certain number
of failed logon attempts, and decide under what circumstances it
may subsequently be re-enabled.
• Trusted Authentication: Enable or disable the Trusted
Authentication feature, and decide its settings.
4. Click Update to apply your changes.

Using Groups (To Make 
Your Life Easier)
Whenever you create a new user account, do you really want to have to 
go through the whole rigmarole of assigning all the relevant rights to the
account every single time? No, we didn’t think you would. Fortunately, 
that’s where groups come in.
Groups are collections of users who all share the same rights and permis-
sions. You can create a group, for example, for a particular department 
(such as the Accounts department), for a specific role (such as Report
Writers), or for a geographic location (such as Europe). Bundling users
together in groups allows you to change rights and permissions in one 
centralized location rather than having to modify them for each account 
individually — which, we’re sure you’ll agree, is a pretty nice idea.
When you install the BusinessObjects system, some groups are already 
created by default:
 Administrators: Members of the Administrators group can perform all
tasks in each BusinessObjects application installed. By default, the
Administrator group contains only the Administrator user.
 Everyone: Each user in the system is a member of the Everyone group.
By default, the Everyone group grants members access to all reports 
in the Report Samples folder.
 NT Users: When you install the BusinessObjects system on Windows,
the installation process creates a BusinessObjects NT Users Group. 
By default, members of this group can view folders and reports.
This group is added to Windows on the local machine, and the user 
who carried out the installation is automatically added to this group
(under his or her Windows logon). Consequently, if you enable NT
authentication, users can user the Windows accounts to log on to the
BusinessObjects system.
 Universe Designer Users: Members of this group can access the
Universe Designer folder and the Connections folder. By default, this
group has no users. You must add users as required.
Members of the Universe Designer Users group can also control which
users have access rights to Designer.
Creating a new group
To create a new group, do the following:
41
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

1. Click the Groups button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click New Group.
3. Click the Properties tab, and then enter a Name and Description 
for the new group, as shown in Figure 4-7.
4. Click OK.
Adding subgroups
Groups can exist independently, or they can be subgroups of another 
group at a higher hierarchical level. Creating a subgroup makes managing
access rights that are common across multiple groups even easier, because
subgroups inherit the rights of their parent group.
There are two ways of adding subgroups: You can add one or more groups 
to a parent group (working from the point of view of the parent group), or
you can make a group a member of a parent group (working from the point 
of view of the subgroup).
To add a subgroup, follow these steps:
1. Click the Groups button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click the name of the group you want to add a subgroup to.
3. Click the Subgroups tab.
4. Click Add/Remove Subgroups.
5. Select the group or groups you want to add as subgroups of 
this group.
You can select multiple groups by Ctrl+clicking.
6. Once you’ve made your choice, click the > arrow. 
Figure 4-7:
Creating a
new group.
42
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

The subgroup(s) are added to the group, as shown in Figure 4-8.
7. Click OK.
To make a group a member of a parent group, follow these steps:
1. Click the Groups button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Click the name of the group you want to make a member of a 
parent group.
3. Click the Member Of tab.
4. Click the Member Of button.
5. Select the parent group or groups you want to make this group a
member of.
You can select multiple groups by Ctrl+clicking.
6. Once you’ve made your choices, click the > arrow.
The subgroups are added to the group, as shown in Figure 4-9.

Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

Deleting a group
Sometimes, you may discover that a group is no longer required. In that case,
you can delete the group. 
You cannot delete the default Administrator or Everyone groups.
To delete a group, follow these steps:
1. Click the Groups button on the CMC Home Page.
2. Select the check box for the group you want to delete.
3. Click Delete.
4. When asked to confirm that you want to delete the account, click OK
and the group is then deleted.
Take special care when deleting a group, as you cannot recover a group you
delete by mistake.
Exploring the Rights Tab
As an administrator, you can view and change the rights principals have to
any object within the system — folders, reports, or whatever — from the
Rights tab of the object in question.
Displaying the Rights tab
To display the Rights tab, do the following:
1. Click the Folders button on the CMC Home Page, and then browse
through your folder hierarchy until you find the object you’re 
looking for.
Alternatively, you can click the Objects button to view a list of all the
objects in the system.
2. Click the name of the folder or other object whose rights you want to
manage.
3. Click the Rights tab. 
A page showing the Rights currently assigned to the object in question
appears, as shown in Figure 4-10.
44
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Reading the Rights tab
The columns of the Rights tab provide information on who has access to the
object, and what type of access they have:
 Name: Lists each of the principals granted access to the object.
Typically, access is granted to groups rather than individual users, 
but specific users can also be included in this list. To add or remove 
a group or user for this object, click Add/Remove.
 Object: States whether the principal is a group or user.
 Description: Provides more detailed information on who the principals
are than may be understood by a simple name.
 Access Level: Shows the level of rights assigned to the principal for this
object. You can choose a predefined access level or select Advanced to
define more rights yourself. For more information on access levels, see
the upcoming “Understanding access levels” section.
 Net Access: Shows the net (or aggregate) total of the rights assigned 
in the Access Level column, together with any rights inherited by the
principal.
Understanding access levels
Think of access levels as being like “packages” of rights that principals might
commonly need. For an administrator, they speed up the process of assigning
user rights by avoiding the need to assign individual rights one at a time.
The predefined access levels are
 No Access: The principal cannot access the object.
 View
• If set at the folder level, the principal can view the folder, all objects
within the folder, and the generated instances of each object.
Figure 4-10:
Assign user
rights and
permissions
from the
Rights tab.
45
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

• If set at the object level, the principal can view the object, its 
history, and its generated instances.
Rights include viewing objects and viewing document instances.
 Schedule
• The principal can generate new instances by scheduling an 
object to run against a specified data source, either once or on 
a recurring basis.
• The principal can view, delete, and pause the scheduling of
instances that they own.
• The principal can also schedule to different formats and destina-
tions, set parameters and database logon information, and carry
out a range of scheduling related tasks.
Rights include All View Access Level rights, plus
• Schedule the document to run
• Define server groups to process jobs
• Copy objects to another folder
• Schedule to destinations
• Print the report’s data
• Export the report’s data
• Edit objects that the user owns
• Delete instances that the user owns
• Pause and resume document instances that the user owns
 View On Demand: The principal can refresh data against a data source,
as and when required.
Rights include All Schedule Access Level rights, plus being able to
refresh the report’s data.
 Full Control: The principal has full administrative control of the object.
The Full Control Access Level enables principals who are not members
of the Administrators group to add, edit, and delete other principals’
content through the CMC. Assign it with caution!
Rights include all available advanced rights, including these:
• Add objects to the folder
• Edit objects
• Modify rights users have to objects
• Delete objects
• Delete instances
46
Part I: Getting Started with BusinessObjects 

Understanding inheritance
An important concept to bear in mind when considering rights in
BusinessObjects is the concept of inheritance. Basically, to avoid the 
administrator having to set rights on every single object — which would
quickly become a Herculean task — the rights a user has with regard to 
any object in the system come from a combination of the different groups
and subgroups the user belongs to, and the rights the objects have inherited
from the parent folders they are contained in.
For example, a user who is Canadian Sales Director may belong to two groups:
Canada and Senior Managers. For a specific object, such as the folder Sales
Reports, the Canada group may have the View Objects permission denied and
the Senior Managers group may have the same permission granted. In this
case, the Canadian Sales Director would not be able to view any objects in
the folder in question — which may surprise her!
The BusinessObjects rights system is quite restrictive, and a single inherited
“denied” for any permission is enough for the permission to be, well, denied.
Managing Applications
You may not want all your users to have access to the same applications, 
in part because they simply don’t need them — in the same way that a
plumber and an electrician don’t carry around the same toolkit — or, more
likely, because you want retain a certain level of control over some tools
(such as Designer, for instance).
With this in mind, you can specify which groups (or even which individual
users) can access several of the applications in the BusinessObjects XI
Release 2 suite, and exactly what rights they have in each case. You can 
also use the BusinessObjects Applications area of the CMC to change the
appearance and even the functionality of some applications.
The applications you can manage from the CMC are:
 The CMC itself
 Crystal Reports Explorer
 Designer
 Desktop Intelligence
 Discussions
 InfoView
 Web Intelligence
47
Chapter 4: Taking Control with the Central Management Console

For example, you may want a group of users to be able to view Web
Intelligence documents but not create new ones, and for this same group 
not to have access to the Desktop Intelligence tool.
To set rights for specific Web Intelligence features, follow these steps:
1. In the Manage area of the CMC Home Page, click BusinessObjects
Enterprise Applications.
2. Click Web Intelligence.
3. Click the Rights tab, and then click Web Intelligence in order to
expand the list of rights you can grant or deny.
4. Select the options you want, and then click Apply.
In our example, we would explicitly deny the Create Document right 
for this group. We would also set Log On to Desktop Intelligence and
view this object in the CMC to denied, so that no users in this group
could log on to DeskI.

Universes

In this part. . .
D
id you think that installing BusinessObjects was all
you needed to do to get the ball rolling? If so, you’d
better think again! At this point, you basically have a car
without an engine. Now it’s time for you to start putting
together the engine (universe) that will run Business-
Objects. Without a BusinessObjects universe, there’s no
way that you can prepare the data for the folks in Sales 
to use to query and build reports in time for next week’s
department meeting. 
If you’re the person who is responsible for putting
together the universes for your BusinessObjects environ-
ment, you’re in the right place. The chapters in this part
give you the rundown on how to create a basic universe
to get you going. Chapter 6 shows you how to define a 
universe, while Chapter 7 shows you how to use joins
between your tables. The part wraps up with Chapter 8,
where you take a closer look at dimensions.
Admittedly, you won’t be a master of the universe after
this part, but you’ll be able to get things going and help
those folks in Sales get ready for the big meeting.

W
hen you think of BusinessObjects or any other business-intelligence
tool, the first thing that probably comes to mind is reports. Why not?
Reports are the rock stars of BusinessObjects; they are what most users 
ultimately work with.
Of course, before you can use reports, you need a universe in place. No, not
the big one (that one’s already in place), but a specific body of metadata: 
 In business intelligence, metadata is information that describes your
data and the way it’s structured; don’t confuse it with actual data! 
 A universe is a set of metadata that describes what’s in a relational 
database that’s dedicated to a specific group of users. 
For example, say that you own a boutique. You may have a partial or entire
database dedicated solely to Customers. The metadata that describes that
data makes up the Customers universe.
BusinessObjects lets you create the universe you need (what a concept), 
so that later on you can create the reports you want. There’s no shortage 
of ways to create a universe in BusinessObjects:
 BusinessObjects Designer: The easiest way to go about creating a 
universe with Designer is to use the Quick Design Wizard (see the 
section “Working with BusinessObjects Designer” for details).
 Designer via the Universe Parameters window: You can put together
your universe manually. Just flip ahead to the “Building a Universe 
the Old-School Way” section.

 BusinessObjects Universe Builder: In certain conditions, you can auto-
matically generate universes using a catchy, convivial wizard. For exam-
ple, if Universe Builder supports your metadata or if you need to have
backward compatibility with BusinessObjects 6.5, you should use this
option. See the section “Becoming Master of the Universe (Builder).”
In this chapter, we show you how to create a universe using all three of these
methods. Which one you choose depends on many factors.
BusinessObjects lets you create a universe by first selecting a source of 
metadata — whether that source is OLAP, ODBC, SAP, Oracle, or whatever.
With your metadata source in place, you pick bits and pieces of the data 
to include in your universe, so users can work with this data in their own
terms. Think of it as an all-you-can-eat data buffet.
Depending on your organization, you may never actually be called upon 
to create a universe. Creating universes can be somewhat tricky at times;
most companies tend to leave that chore to BusinessObjects consultants 
or experienced professionals. But if you’re using BusinessObjects as an
extension to another product that you already use at the office, you may
need to know how to create your own universes.
Working with BusinessObjects Designer
BusinessObjects Designer (or Designer for short) is one of the applications
that BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise makes available while you’re
installing the client software. (We discuss the purpose of Designer in greater
detail in Chapter 1.) When you build a universe with Designer, you have
access to the Quick Design Wizard the very moment the application opens; if
you are new to creating universes, the Quick Design Wizard is the best way
for you to get started because it figuratively holds your hand and walks you
step by step through the process
The most important thing to keep in mind about Designer is that it employs
the semantic layer to help users understand the data they’re working with.
The semantic layer (a patented Business Objects technology) maps the data
in your database — in effect, translates it into commonly used business
terms. The idea is to make complex data easier to understand. As shown in
Figure 5-1, for example, data could be mapped to terms such as Purchase
Order, Inventory, and so on. In the figure, data is displayed in the red
cylinder while Purchase Order, Inventory, and Materials appear in
front of the user.
Designer has always been the traditional way of creating universes in
BusinessObjects; up until this release, it was the only way. If you’re using a
SQL or ODBC connection to your data, Designer is the way to go for you.

Starting BusinessObjects Designer
To start building a universe in Designer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪
BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Designer.
The User Identification dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
2. Select the BusinessObjects XI Release 2 Enterprise installation that’s
on your computer or network from the System drop-down list.
If you have more than one installation on your network, you may have
several options available. Otherwise, there is but a single system.
3. Select one of the five authentication methods available in the
Authentication drop-down menu.
Ask your BusinessObjects administrators which authentication method
to use. If this is your first time using the software, the drop-down list is
empty. Either manually enter your BusinessObjects XI Release 2 server
details (which you can get from your BusinessObjects administrator) 
or select Standalone (No CMS).

4. Enter your user name and password in the User Name and Password
text boxes and click OK.
Contact your BusinessObjects administrator if you do not know your
user name/password.
The Designer application appears if you logged in properly; the Quick
Design Wizard opens immediately so you can start building your uni-
verse (see the next section).
Creating a universe with the 
Quick Design Wizard
After you start Designer, Quick Design Wizard opens automatically (see
Figure 5-3); there are four screens to creating your universe. 
Set aside 15–20 minutes to create your universe.
Follow these step to create a universe:
1. On the Quick Designer Wizard Welcome screen, click Next.
The Step 1 — Define the Universe Parameters screen appears, as shown
in Figure 5-4.
2. Enter a name for your universe and select a database connection:
• If this is the first time you’re using Designer to create a universe:
Create a database connection by clicking the New button. The 
New Connection Wizard appears. Or, you can also use an existing
connection stored in the CMS. Go to Step 3.
Figure 5-3:
The Quick
Design
Welcome
screen.
54
Part II: Universes 

• If you don’t need to create a database connection: Skip to Step 9.
You can also choose whether your universe has strategies. In a
BusinessObjects universe, a strategy is an automated, built-in routine.
Check the Click Here to Choose Strategies box if you want strategies.
(You actually choose your strategies in Step 10.)
3. Click Next in the New Connection Wizard.
The Database Middleware Selection page appears; it’s a data-access
driver that connects to the database. You might use, for example,
Microsoft ODBC driver, or the IBM DB2 client. If you’re not sure which
node to use, contact your BusinessObjects administrator. Should this
button not appear, it is because you do not have the proper rights.
Contact your BusinessObjects administrator to obtain them.
4. Select the database node from the collapsible/expandable menu and
click Next.
The Login Parameters page appears. This is where you decide what 
to call your new connection and determine whether it’s just for 
you or whether other users can use the connection.
5. On the Login Parameters screen, set the following options:
a. Set the database connection name and type with the Type drop-
down list.
b. Enter your user name and password in the User Name and Password
text boxes, respectively. Remember that this is the database user
name and password, which are different from the BusinessObjects
user name and password. Questions? Ask your Database
Administrator.
Figure 5-4:
The Step 1
window.
55
Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

c. This step varies depending on your selected database connection
type in Step A. For example, if you’re using an ODBC driver, select
the data source name from the Data Source Name drop-down list. 
On the other hand, if you’re using an OLEDB driver, set the server
name and database name.
d. Click Next.
The data source isn’t a file, but rather the connection parameter to your
database. 
6. Click the Test Connection button; the results appear at the bottom 
left of the window. Click Next.
If your connection failed, click the Back button and check your selected
settings. You may have selected a database node that is not available on
your computer. 
When in doubt about your database node, choose ODBC.
If you are using ODBC and the connection doesn’t respond, check your
data-source properties by choosing Control Panel➪Administrative
Tools➪Data Sources (ODBC).
7. Select the advanced settings for your database connection settings in
the Advanced Settings screen, and then click Next.
This page offers advanced settings depending on the selected database
node. For example, you can tell BusinessObjects how to handle connec-
tions by using the radio boxes providing three distinct options:
• Disconnect after each transaction: This option lets you disconnect
from the server after you finish whatever it is you are trying to do.
If you don’t like the default, we recommending choosing this
option.
• Keep the connection active for X minutes: This option lets you set 
an amount of time (the default selection is 10 minutes) to keep 
a connection alive. Once that period expires, the connection is
dropped. We recommend maintaining this default value.
• Keep the connection active during the whole session (local mode
only): This option maintains a permanently open connection. 
For security and performance reasons, this isn’t a good option 
to choose.
You can also set array fetch and bind sizes, as well as the login
timeout. You’re well enough to leave alone these advanced features
and keep the default values. There is no compelling reason for 
you to change these default values.
56
Part II: Universes 

8. Set any customized settings on the Custom Parameters screen and
then click Finish.
If there are any customized settings, you have two options: You can
remove them or you can modify their value. By default, there is but a
single option — Binary Slice Size — that you can modify by entering a
number in the text box and clicking Set. You can also remove custom
settings by clicking each parameter name and then clicking Remove.
The New Connection Wizard finishes; you return to the first screen of
the Quick Design Wizard, where your new database connection appears
(see Figure 5-5).
9. Click Next.
The Choose the Strategies screen appears — if, in Step 2, you decided 
to include strategies (see Figure 5-6). In you didn’t, skip to Step 11 to
create classes and objects. This is primarily for advanced users; we 
recommend keeping the default values and going on to the next step.
Don’t forget to test your connection again!
10. If you decided to select strategies in Step 2, select one of the three
strategies in the Choose the Strategies screen and click Next.
In this window, you select a strategy for objects, joins, and tables 
by using the appropriate drop-down lists. If you select a strategy, a
description appears below the drop-down menu. Again, this is really 
for advanced users, but you can find out more about objects, joins, 
and tables in Chapter 6.
Figure 5-5:
The new
database
connection
appears.
57
Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

11. Create initial classes and objects from your list of database tables 
and columns by adding them to your universe; click Next.
• The information presented in the left column represents actual
data that is in your database. Designer lets you transform your
data into objects and classes, which makes comprehension easier
for users. 
• You can select an individual column or table from the list or 
you can select multiple tables by Ctrl+clicking. Click the Add 
and Remove buttons to add these elements to your universe or
remove them.
12. Create measure objects from your list of database tables and columns
by adding them to your universe in the Create Initial Classes and
Objects; click Next.
You can manually add tables and columns to the measure objects in
your universe by selecting the desired elements and clicking the Count,
Sum, Minimum, Maximum, and Average buttons. These buttons make 
up an aggregate function that allows you to display values. Such addi-
tions make up a unique class called Measures that lets you define key
indicators for your analysis, such as revenue or customer numbers.
Press Ctrl to make multiple selections.
13. Click Finish.
The final window displays a list of how many classes, objects, filters, and
joins you created, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Now that you’ve created a universe, sit back and take a break! Of course,
we’ve really just scratched the surface. In Chapter 6, we cover how to use 
filters and joins in your universes.
Figure 5-6:
The
Strategies
window.
58
Part II: Universes 

Before you take that break, be sure to save your universe in Designer by
choosing File➪Save. (Who knew it was that easy to save the universe?)
Your new universe now appears as a schema in Designer, as shown in Figure
5-8. This schema lists the tables that are included in your universe, as well as
any selected columns. You can also find the same information presented in
the left panel of Designer. The tables are displayed in a hierarchical menu,
which you can expand or collapse as necessary to see the available columns
(objects).

Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

Building a Universe the Old-School Way
Some of us love a challenge, or at least insist on doing things the hard way!
For those of you who are anti-wizard, or simply like to have more creative
control, there is more than one way to build a universe. (For instance, you
can start with a really big bang . . . just kidding.)
Using the Quick Designer Wizard, Designer lets you put together your 
universe à la carte via the Universe Parameters. This feature is similar to 
the Quick Designer Wizard; the primary difference is that you create your 
universe by working one tab at a time (with complete control over each 
step) instead of from wizard page to wizard page.
Lots of folks find this from-the-ground-up way of creating a universe easy
enough to understand; if you’re more comfortable using wizards, try Quick
Design Wizard (see the preceding section). Avoiding the wizard doesn’t offer
a guaranteed advantage, but more advanced users tend to appreciate the
non-wizard interface: You can go right in and set up your universe without
explanations or multiple screens. 
Here’s how to do this:
1. Start BusinessObject Designer.
Turn to the earlier section “Starting BusinessObjects Designer” 
if you need help starting BusinessObjects Designer. 
The Quick Design Wizard opens (refer to Figure 5-3).
2. Click Cancel in the Quick Designer Wizard screen; in Designer, choose
File➪New.
The Universe Parameters window appears; it’s similar in function to the
Quick Design Wizard, just slightly less convivial.
3. On the Definition tab (see Figure 5-9), enter a name in the Name 
text box and a description in the Description text box, and select a
connection for your universe from the Connection drop-down menu.
If no existing connections are available, click New and go to Step 3 in 
the “Creating a Universe with the Quick Design Wizard” section. At this
point, you can consider yourself done — everything that is mandatory 
is now complete. Of course, you can take the hard way out and carry 
on to Step 4.
If you decide to carry on with the other tabs, save yourself some time
and skip the Summary tab. It is a read-only tab that provides a summary
of your universe; for example, it shows the number of objects, tables,
etc. It’s basically useless when you create a universe because everything
equals to zero!
60
Part II: Universes 

4 On the Strategies tab, set any desired strategies for your universe.
If you select one of the available strategies, its definition appears below
the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 5-10. 
The drop-down menus you see change depending on your connection
type. For example, you might have drop-down menus for objects, joins,
and tables. Each one features a series of choices that are unique to that
drop-down menu. For example, the Tables drop-down menu only has
(Built-in) Standard, while the Joins drop-down menu has more options:
Edit Manually and All Matching Column Names. 
Steps 5 through 8 are more oriented toward modifying universe 
properties than of actual use when creating a universe. If you modify 
the Controls, SQL, and Parameters tabs without knowing what you 
are doing, you run the risk of impacting query generation later on and
obtaining incorrect results. If you are not comfortable with that risk, 
go on to Step 9.
Figure 5-10:
The
Strategies
tab.
Figure 5-9:
The
Definition
tab in the
Universe
Parameters
window.
61
Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

5. In the Controls tab, set any query result limits.
This tab lets you set maximum results for returned results or for the
amount of time spent processing a query. The default results are largely
sufficient for most users; however, feel free to change as necessary. 
6. On the SQL tab, set query and generation options for your universe.
This tab has a number of options available for queries, multiple paths,
or Cartesian products. By default, most options are selected, as shown
in Figure 5-11. We recommend keeping these default settings unless 
compelled to do otherwise.
7. On the Links tab, if you have any existing, exported universes, you
may opt to dynamically link them.
If this is your first universe, you won’t see any universes listed here 
yet. If you do have other universes, you can add or remove links
between them. 
You can only link exported universes; in other words, you or someone
else had to create and export these universe to the CMS.
8. On the Parameter tab, add any properties as necessary.
This is an advanced feature; you could easily leave this tab as is and
continue. Of course, you can use it by adding any SQL parameter that is
available for a universe. These include, for example, AUTO_UPDATE_
QUERY, DISTINCT_VALUES, and END_SQL. Enter a property name and
value, using the text boxes, as shown in Figure 5-12. After you enter this
information, click Add. You can also replace an existing value, or even
delete it.
Figure 5-11:
The SQL tab.
62
Part II: Universes 

9. Click OK.
Your new universe is now complete. At this point, you have an empty
universe. It appears in BusinessObjects Designer’s Universe and
Structure pages that you can access by choosing File➪Open.
Becoming Master of the 
Universe (Builder)
The third way of building a universe involves an application called
BusinessObjects Universe Builder. Universe Builder has one notable advan-
tage: Although you have to install it on the same machine as BusinessObjects
XI Release 2 Enterprise, it operates completely independently. 
Over time, more users will probably use the Universe Builder over Designer
simply because Designer doesn’t allow the use of plug-ins that either didn’t
exist when it was released or have been updated since its release. Universe
Builder uses Designer to create and manage some features, such as CMS 
login and reading connections; it also uses the Designer SDK (for developers).
Nevertheless, Universe Builder shares some very basic purposes with
Designer; for example, both allow you to connect to metadata sources and
then map this metadata to more easily understood concepts — classes and
objects, for example. A handy sidebar (“Universe Builder versus Designer”)
offers a look at how these two applications compare.
Figure 5-12:
The
Parameter
tab.

Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

Starting Universe Builder
Like Designer, the Universe Builder is easy to find and easy to launch.
To open Universe Builder, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪
BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Universe Builder.
The Universe Builder application launches and the User Identification
window appears.
2. Select the installation that’s on your computer or network from the
System drop-down list.
3. Select an authentication method from the Authentication drop-down
menu.
4. Enter your user name and password in the User Name and Password
text boxes.
You can ask your BusinessObjects administrator for these details; if you
have nothing, you can leave all fields blank, select Standalone (No CMS)
from the Authentication drop-down list.
5. Click OK.
Did you know that you can also open the Universe Builder from Designer? 
To do that
64
Part II: Universes 
Universe Builder versus Designer
Understanding the difference between Universe
Builder and Designer can be somewhat difficult;
understanding when to use one or the other can
be even more confusing! After all, both applica-
tions are designed to help you create your own
universe. Basically, what it comes down to is
this: Was your metadata source already com-
patible with BusinessObjects XI Release 2 at the
time of its release? In other words, will your
metadata play nicely with BusinessObjects XI
Release 2? If there is no compatibility, you will
need to use Universe Builder.
If your metadata was supported by BO XI R2,
then you should use BusinessObjects Designer.
On the other hand, if it wasn’t supported, or if
the metadata source uses a plug-in that was
subsequently updated or was released since
the release of BO XI R2, then you should use
Universe Builder. Incidentally, SAP-BW users
should also use Universe Builder because the
application creates a universe automatically on
the basis of data type. Universe Builder is the
right tool not only because it supports your
metadata type, but it also allows automatic uni-
verse creation.
Universe Builder also offers compatibility with
BusinessObjects 6.5 As data-exchange plug-ins
are updated over time, more and more Business-
Objects users will move to Universe Builder to
create their universes.

1. Close any open universes in Designer.
2. Choose File➪Metadata Exchange. 
The Metadata Exchange window opens, as shown in Figure 5-13.
3. Select the desired metadata type from the Create a Universe From
drop-down menu.
4. Click OK.
The subsequent window that appears — the Universe Builder pane — makes
up the actual Universe Builder interface (see Figure 5-14).

Builder
pane.

Chapter 5: Creating a Universe from the Safety of Your Desk

Creating a universe with Universe Builder
Now you’re ready to start creating a universe with Universe Builder. If you’re
already familiar with the Designer application, you will probably find that
Universe Builder is equally intuitive and certainly more modern-looking!
To create a universe with Universe Builder, follow these steps:
1. Select your metadata source, either by clicking icons under the
Bridges menu or clicking the tabs across the top of the Universe
Builder panel.
You can choose from seven different metadata sources. If you don’t
know which metadata source your company supports, ask your
BusinessObjects administrator.
2. Click the Metadata Sources button.
The Connection Wizard for your chosen metadata source appears. For
example, if you chose the CWM OLAP metadata source in Step 1, the
CWM OLAP Connection Wizard opens.
3. Click Next.
4. Click the Browse File button and choose an XML source file.
Of course, the source file isn’t always an XML file. It could also be, for
example, an Oracle OLAP file. If you do use an Oracle OLAP file, things
are done a little differently and we really recommend you check out the
Universe Designer documentation from Business Objects.
5. Click Finish.
The name of the source file appears; its corresponding database appears
underneath the XML file as shown in Figure 5-15.
Figure 5-15:
The XML file
and its
database.
66
Part II: Universes 

6. Select the database name; then right-click it and select Create
Universe.
Alternatively, select the database name and then choose File➪Create
Universe. 
Be careful; if you click the XML metadata source name instead, the
Create Universe command is dimmed.
The Universe Builder Wizard for that particular metadata source appears.
7. Click Next.
8. Select the data-source elements you want to include in your universe,
using the arrow buttons.
The first arrow button adds a single element to your universe; you can
add all elements by clicking the second arrow button. 
Pressing Ctrl while selecting multiple files doesn’t work here.
9. Select the metadata source connection.
This indicates which of the available connections to use when you 
open the universe. You can also set your universe name here. There 
are settings that allow saving the new universe automatically, as well 
as replacing an existing universe. We recommend saving the universe 
automatically.
If no metadata source connection appears, you cannot use Universe
Builder. Try creating your universe directly with Designer instead.
10. Click Next.
Review the summary page that recapitulates the previous steps and
your selections.
11. Click Finish once you are satisfied and are ready to generate your 
universe.
When you’ve completed the wizard, your new universe is complete. It now
appears in BusinessObjects Designer’s Universe and Structure pages (which
are displayed when you open the universe in Designer).

Chapter 6
Defining a Universe
In This Chapter
 Discovering the universe (the BusinessObjects version of it, anyway)
 Importing universes
 Saving a universe (you don’t have to be a superhero)
 Exporting a universe
You’re now well on your way to setting up your universe in
BusinessObjects. (Remember, in BusinessObjects-speak, a universe is
the buffer between the user and data in a data warehouse containing objects
and classes.) Oh, wait — you mean you thought that you were done in
Chapter 5? Hardly! Up to this point, you’ve created a universe, but you’ve
basically created just the shell of a universe. You’re miles (hey, at least it isn’t
light-years) away from being able to create your first report or document.
Creating a BusinessObjects universe can be compared to a creating a house.
In Chapter 5, you laid a foundation for your universe to fall back on. Before
you get too deep into creating a universe, it may help you to work with 
other universes that other developers have already created. In fact,
BusinessObjects provides (for example) a number of sample universes that
can get you started. We go into what to expect before you start diving in and
creating your own universes.
There’s more to BusinessObjects universes than just creating them; you can
open other universes in your BusinessObjects installation, or even import
one, (which has far greater effects). After you create a universe, you might
want to save it for future use or even export it to help train a colleague later
on. Who knows — perhaps that colleague will also read this book and import
your creation!

Planning for Your Universe
Most likely, you’ve already created the shell of your universe using
BusinessObjects Designer. Now you have to start thinking about turning 
that shell into something useful — not just for you, but perhaps for an entire 
organization of people. This next step of planning is a costly event — not in
money, but in hours.
Creating a universe can — and should — involve the participation of many
people within your organization.
Your role as universe designer is important — it requires technical know-how,
a good understanding of your organization, and strong analytical skills. You
also need to know your limitations — and know when to turn to other team
members’ strengths. Even if you aren’t the most technical person in your
organization, you need a comfortable knowledge of your database system(s)
within the organization; those are the data sources that feed your universe.
No data equals no universe!
Not everyone within an organization can be a one-stop-shop for all informa-
tion about the organization. Nor can a single person effectively deduce your
organization’s needs accurately; don’t be surprised if you have to depend 
on the expertise of other members of your organization. You’ll want to deter-
mine exactly what data BusinessObjects is going to hold before you build a
universe to hold it. This kind of information may not necessarily be at your
fingertips. For example, a project manager — or any of various people whose
jobs are less technical but more intimately involved with “the big picture” of
the organization — may well be able to help you here.
Analyzing your data 
The first step is a thorough analysis of your organization and its needs. 
This can take a decent (or indecent) amount of time, depending on the size 
of your operations. In addition to determining (not alone!) what information
your users will need to access and analyze, you also need to start creating
business questions and/or scenarios that your users may face. The idea is 
to make your universe relevant to your organization and its users.
Project managers, business analysts, or other team members who work 
with your organization’s customers are likely the people best equipped to
help you create such questions and perform such analysis. Their input is 
crucial to determining what objects and classes you’ll need to create for 
your universe to make it helpful.
70
Part II: Universes 

Creating a structure for your universe
After you have an accurate sense of your organization’s needs, the next 
step is to figure out what kind of structure your universe needs. As you see 
in later chapters, you can start by creating a universe schema with a number
of tables. At this stage, you want to stop and think: Is a single universe
enough for your organization? Or should you consider creating additional
universes to adequately address your organization’s requirements? The
answers to these questions will have an impact on the structure you choose
for your universe.
Importing Universes
Before you get busy planning and creating your own BusinessObjects uni-
verse, you may want to import an existing or sample universe to familiarize
yourself with it first.
It’s possible to both open and import a universe. What’s the difference?
There’s a big one! Opening a universe in BusinessObjects Designer simply
opens it and makes its features available to you. The universe is not included
in your BusinessObjects installation. On the other hand, importing a universe
brings it into your Central Management Console (CMC) — and, by extension,
makes it part of your BusinessObjects installation. If you opened a universe
in Designer and then opened your Web browser and logged into the CMC, 
the opened universe is not listed among the available universes.
When you open a universe, you have two choices: 
 You can open a local universe that has never been exported. This means
that it is a universe that can only be used on your machine. 
 You can open a local copy of an imported universe. When you import a
universe, you open the latest version of the universe stored on the CMS.
To import a universe, follow these steps:
1. Open BusinessObjects Designer by choosing Start➪All Programs➪
BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Designer.
2. Choose File➪Import.
3. From the Folder drop-down menu, select the folder that contains the
universe you want to import, as shown in Figure 6-1.
4. Select the universe you want from the list of available universes 
(or click the Browse button to find the universe manually).
5. Click OK in the Select a Universe Folder dialog box.
6. Click OK in the Import Universe dialog box.
71
Chapter 6: Defining a Universe

Your chosen universe opens in the Designer application, as shown in 
Figure 6-2, and in the CMC of your server machine, using a Web browser.

Saving Universes
So you’re working away with your universe, getting some great content.
Sooner or later, you’re going to want to save the universe. (We’d never dream
of putting a cheap science-fiction joke here. Nope. Not us.) When you save
your BusinessObjects universe, think of it as much the same thing as saving 
a Microsoft Word document: You’re simply saving the current state of the 
universe so you can work on it later — or you’re looking to avoid data loss in
case the power goes out for some reason. 
By saving a universe, you are saving the universe file on your local drive 
and not actually in your repository. The file isn’t available in your 
installation’s CMC.
To save your universe, follow these steps:
1. Start creating your new universe using BusinessObjects Designer.
2. Click the Save icon or choose File➪Save.
The Save As dialog box appears.
3. Enter a valid name for your universe, as shown in Figure 6-3.
You’re limited to 100 characters for the universe name.
4. Click Save.
Saving a universe keeps the security (and the peace). If you are sharing 
your computer with someone else, another user without the rights to see 
the universe in the CMS isn’t authorized to open your locally saved copy.
Alternatively, you may want to save your universe as a PDF. You’re not
exactly saving the whole BO universe as a PDF, but rather, the various bits 
of information that your universe contains (such as the components and 
the schema of your tables).
Figure 6-3:
The Save As
dialog box.
73
Chapter 6: Defining a Universe

To save your universe details as a PDF, follow these steps:
1. Start creating your new universe using BusinessObjects Designer.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. Select a location for your file.
4. Enter a name for the universe.
5. Select Portable Document Format (*.PDF) From the Save As Type
drop-down list.
The PDF file of your universe details is stored in the location you selected. 
You can configure the contents of the PDF file by selecting the different
options in the Options dialog box (Tools➪Options➪Print/PDF), as shown 
in Figure 6-4. This tab allows you to specifically determine what features, 
if any, should be output to PDF format. The categories of printable features
are in three sections: General, List Components, and Full Description. Each
option represents a feature or item that is displayed in the PDF. We recom-
mend selecting the items that satisfy the level of detail that you require. 
Just keep in mind that the more selections you make, the more crowded your
PDF will be!
If you want to print the universe structure and want to display the full 
structure within a single page — a good thing when you have a large 
universe — choose View➪Page Break. Figure 6-5 shows how the two tables
Outlet_lookup and shop_facts are not displayed on the same page.

Exporting Universes
As a universe designer, you’ll need to export your universe as soon as you’re
satisfied with it so you can make it available to everyone in your organization
who’s using BusinessObjects.
To make your universe available to BusinessObjects users throughout your
organization, you export the universe so it appears in the CMC. Otherwise
the universe is only available in your local repository, and only you will have
access to it.
To export a universe, follow these steps:
1. Launch BusinessObjects Designer.
2. Choose File➪Export.
The Export Universe dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-6.
3. From the Domain drop-down menu, select the folder for the universe
you want to export or locate it manually by clicking the Browse
button.
Making no selection is the equivalent to selecting all groups displayed. 
If you select only a single group, the universe won’t be available for
people belonging to unselected groups.
4. Select a universe from the list of available, active universes from the
Universes box.
5. Click the Add button to add any inactive universes.
Figure 6-5:

75
Chapter 6: Defining a Universe

6. Select the inactive universes and click Open.
When exporting a universe, make sure that your universe has a secured
connection, one that is stored in the CMS. If your universe doesn’t have
a secured connection, an alert occurs and you have to set a connection
to your universe, as shown in Figure 6-7.
7. Click OK in the Export Universe dialog box.
The exported universe now appears in the CMC, as shown in Figure 6-8.
Exporting a universe is required if you plan on using it with Web Intelligence. 
If you are still working on the universe and you don’t want other people to
access it, you can export it to a specific folder (for example, a Temporary
Universe folder). After you export the universe, you can ask your administra-
tor to allow only you to use this folder (see Chapter 4 on CMC rights). When
you have finished development on it, you can make it available to all users
and then export it to a different folder.

are completely finished with it, you can move the universe. Otherwise, copy
it to continue working on it in your own development folder.

Joining Your Universe
In This Chapter
 Adding tables to your universe
 Creating joins between your tables
 Detecting joins
 Using loops
I
f you’re reading this chapter, it’s likely that you’ve already created your 
universe shell in Chapter 5. This means that you’ve created the schema
that composes your universe and you’ve probably added a few tables. That’s
a great first step toward creating your first universe. As you probably have
guessed by now, a BusinessObjects universe isn’t something that you create
overnight, or at least not in a few book pages!
Not every BusinessObjects user has to create a universe; this important task
comes with a lot of responsibility that isn’t necessarily for beginning users,
especially in a corporate environment. An administrator-level user who has
extensive BusinessObjects or business-intelligence experience is likeliest to
be creating universes.
But even if you’re just learning the ropes of BusinessObjects, it’s worth
having a go at creating a universe. So now it’s time to tie together those
tables you created in your schema. To do so, you use a join — the logical
equivalent of a pipe or duct that connects two or more tables. It’s sort of 
like the plumbing in your bathroom — imagine that the sink, the toilet, and
the shower are each a database table. You use a join, or plumbing pipes, 
to connect the tables in a way that makes sense and serves a purpose for
each of them (sink, toilet, and shower).

For example, say that you have a table for customers and a table for 
orders. Among the various columns available in the tables, both might have
an account number field in both tables. You can create a join from the
account number field in the Customer table to the account number in the
Orders table.
Joins and loops (a collection of joins) are a major component of creating your
universe. Therefore this entire chapter is dedicated to these two concepts;
it’s the next step in the long journey that is creating a universe. Rome wasn’t
built in a day; BusinessObjects universes aren’t either.
Before You Join: Creating Tables
Before you get too carried away, you need to take a few preliminary steps
before you can work with joins. For example, it won’t hurt to actually have a
table in your universe to which you can add a join! This is easily and quickly
done in Designer.
To insert a table in your universe, follow these steps:
1. Launch Designer; choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI
Release 2➪BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Designer.
2. Log on to Designer.
3. Create or open an existing universe.
See Chapter 6 if you’re not sure how to open a universe.
4. Double-click anywhere in the open area in the Structure window.
5. Using the Table Browser, which displays all tables and databases
views to which you have access, select a table and click Insert or drag
and drop it onto the Structure window.
You now have a universe with table(s). If you’re looking to work with joins,
you’ll want to have at least two.
Creating a Join
Using a join in your universe schema helps ensure that correct data is
returned when users perform a query using the data in your universe. 
Joins keep tables connected between appropriate columns so you only 
get the right query data — and not every possible combination that could 
be returned without the use of joins. The join is simply a condition that 
connects the data in the various tables that make up your universe.
80
Part II: Universes 

You can create a join in BusinessObjects Designer in a number of ways,
though you’ll most likely end up creating joins either by hand or using a join
that BusinessObjects automatically finds for you.
Creating joins manually
Manually creating a join in your BusinessObjects Designer database schema
is just a matter of dragging and dropping.
To create a join, follow these steps:
1. Place the mouse cursor at the spot where you want to create your join;
this is a column.
You’ll know that you’re ready to create a join when the cursor changes
form to resemble a hand, as shown in Figure 7-1.
2. Click the left mouse button and drag the mouse to the corresponding
column.
The column appears highlighted when you drag; the cursor turns into a
pencil, as shown in Figure 7-2.
3. Release the mouse. 
If you don’t want to set any properties, you can stop here.

The
selected
column is
highlighted;
the cursor is
now a
pencil.
Figure 7-1:
The hand-
shaped
cursor.
81
Chapter 7: Joining Your Universe

4. Double-click anywhere in the new join.
The Edit Join window appears, as shown in Figure 7-3. You can set
important settings for your join, such as the type or its cardinality (the
minimum and maximum number of instances between two entities).
This window also lets you set information such as which two tables 
and columns to use for your join. (This window isn’t critical if you’re 
creating a join manually by using drag-and-drop.)
If you want to create a join without using your mouse, you can use the
Edit Join window to set the tables and columns manually.
5. Click OK after you enter any properties.
In general, a join links data from one table to data of a second table. The SQL
generated, for example, is Country.country_id=Region.country_id,
which appears in the Edit part of the Join Properties window or in the
Formula bar. A query retrieves all counties and their associated regions. 
But perhaps your database contains countries without any regions or even
customers without orders. (This kind of information can be useful if you want
to launch a marketing campaign for these customers.) In that case, define
your join by checking the Outer Join checkbox (refer to Figure 7-3) and your
query returns all countries or customers even if they don’t have a region 
or orders.
Figure 7-3:
Edit Join
window. 
82
Part II: Universes 

Using auto-detected joins
If you’re not comfortable with the idea of locating and/or creating your own
joins, you can always let BusinessObjects Designer earn its pay and do it for
you. If your database schema features a large number of tables or columns 
in it, then we recommend letting Designer detect and suggest joins for you —
to either the tables or columns.
Before you get too comfortable, you have some work to do! We don’t really
recommend working with a strategy, which is a file that uses information on
the schema in your database. Strategies are a somewhat outdated concept
that is really difficult for beginning users to follow. Instead, use the 
Universe Builder.
However, if you decide to go forward and select a strategy, you can create a
strategy in one of two ways:
 Use one of the canned strategies that come with BusinessObjects. If
you’re not comfortable with writing your own script, you can select a
pre-loaded strategy from the Parameters window. For example, an easy
strategy is to select matching column names in the database schema.
 Write your own SQL strategy. 
There’s only one major drawback to using the auto-detection feature in
BusinessObjects Designer. When your strategy creates a join between two
columns with slightly different names, but that contain the same data, the
auto-detection feature won’t find them. For example, if you have an Account
No. column and an Account Number column, Designer doesn’t consider 
them to be the same thing, even if the data in the table indicates otherwise.
Before you use this method to create your joins, be sure your tables all have
matching column names.
To create an auto-detected join, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Parameters to open the Strategies tab in BusinessObjects
Designer.
The Universe Parameters window opens with the Strategies tab 
showing, as shown in Figure 7-4.
83
Chapter 7: Joining Your Universe

2. Select a strategy from the Joins drop-down list.
Choose the strategy that makes the most sense in your situation. 
If you’re confused, each strategy provides a brief description of its 
purpose below the drop-down list.
This strategy or rule is applied when searching for joins to create.
3. Click OK.
4. Back in the Structure pane of BusinessObjects Designer, select the
area to “consider” when applying the strategy.
You can either drag across a specific area to include (as shown in 
Figure 7-5) or select tables individually by Shift-clicking.
5. Choose Tools➪Automated Detection➪Detect Joins.
The Candidate Joins dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-6. The joins
that Designer detected are listed.
Figure 7-5:

the area to
apply auto-
detection of
joins. 
Figure 7-4:

window.
84
Part II: Universes 

6. Select a join and click Insert.
If only one join is available, it is selected. If no joins are available, the
Insert button is grayed out.
7. Click Close.
Deleting a join
If you find that a particular join is no longer needed, select it and then press
the Delete or the Backspace key.
Before deleting a join, think about any repercussions that this might have on
your universe and other users in the future. You can’t get your joins back.
Using Loops
After you get the hang of joins, you can take things even further by using
loops. A loop is a collection of joins that create consistent paths between
tables in your database schema.
Universe schemas need to be more flexible than database schemas because
they often require the use of more than a single path to get the job done. 
You can ask BusinessObjects Designer to find and resolve loops within your
universe schema.
We recommend revisiting the BusinessObjects documentation online when
working with loops, as the technical level involved with SQL clauses goes
beyond the scope of this book.
Figure 7-6:
Creating
detected
joins.
85
Chapter 7: Joining Your Universe

Before you start with loops, you need to make sure that cardinalities are 
set in your schema. Double-click your join, and choose the appropriate 
cardinality in the Edit Join window (as shown in Figure 7-7): 
 One-to-one: A single row in a column has only a single row in the column
of the other table. 
 One-to-many: A single row in a column can have one or many rows in
the column of the other table.
 Many-to-one: Many rows in the column can have a single row in the
column of the other table.
We recommend clicking the Detect button, which checks all loops and pro-
poses the cardinalities settings or an alias resolution (used by the Detect
Alias tool) or a context resolution based on the Detect Context tool.
After you verify that you’ve set your cardinalities, you can see what (if any)
aliases are needed to fix your loops.
Setting cardinalities is very important because all three algorithm tools are
based on cardinalities. If cardinalities are missing, the result provided by
these tools may be wrong. When you are using the detect loop tool, a 
warning message is displayed, as shown in Figure 7-8.

Adding Dimensions 
to Your Universe
In This Chapter
 Creating objects 
 Creating classes
 Using objects and classes
 Creating a list of values
S
o you have yourself a brand-new universe — but now you need a dimen-
sion. Although that sounds like something straight out of science fiction,
in this case a dimension is really just an object that you’ll analyze. To make
your BusinessObjects universe truly complete, your dimension needs one 
or more classes — and a few objects.
Classes and objects are the bread and butter of your universe. They are 
the data from your data source that you use to create your queries. But
they’re also much more than that. The object is really a SELECT statement
that is mapped to one or more column in one or more tables in your universe
schema. (Here’s the English translation: When you build a query in WebI, 
the SELECT statement is referenced through the column that your object 
represents.) A working knowledge of SQL helps you with these tasks. If you’re
a bit rusty, check out SQL For Dummies, 4th Edition by Allen Taylor (Wiley
Publishing).
In the bigger picture, you include your objects in a class, which is simply 
a logical container that works like a suitcase (it can hold objects or other
classes). You can create a class that’s no more than a single object — 
though you’re likely to have considerably more objects than that in the 
class, depending on how much data you have that fits the class.

Classes don’t have any technical mumbo-jumbo behind them, which makes
them different from objects. In effect, classes keep your universe tidy. You can
create as many as you need to make sense of your objects. It’s important that
classes be presented in a logical way that allows other users to find what they
need with minimum hassle. That logical way is the dimension: a grouping of
related classes.
BusinessObjects Designer is the right tool to help you create your dimensions,
including your objects and classes. 
Creating Objects
In the BusinessObjects suite and in Universe Designer, you will find three 
different kinds of objects, as shown in Figure 8-1. Each one has its own set of
properties: 
 Dimensions: Defined by their blue square icon, you use dimension
objects for analyzing your data, or even creating hierarchies with them.
These are the center of your analysis. Its value has a value for the report
creator; for example, the dimension can be a product dimension (prod-
uct line, product), time dimension (year, month), location dimension
(country, region, city), people dimension (manager, employee).
 Measures: This object is symbolized by a pink bumble icon. A measure
object is an indicator; it has a meaning associated with a dimension.
“Number of employees” and “Sales Revenue” are measures. Not only are
you interested in the sales revenue, but the sales revenue by country, 
for each product.
 Detail: This object is represented with a green pyramid. A detail 
object qualifies a dimension. For example, this could be the address 
of a person, or the description of a product. A detail object must be
associated with its parent dimension.

kinds of
objects.
88
Part II: Universes 

Even though creating an object isn’t a hard task, you need one before you can
use classes. As with most things in BusinessObjects, you can create an object
in BusinessObjects Designer in two ways:
 Create an object manually using the Universe pane.
 Drag and drop objects from the Structure pane.
Taking the manual-y approach
If you like to dive right in and get your hands dirty, consider the manual
approach to creating objects. 
Creating an object manually in BusinessObjects Designer involves adding an
object to a class in the Universe window (see Figure 8-2) and then setting
properties for the object.
Figure 8-2:
The
Universe
window and
its classes.
89
Chapter 8: Adding Dimensions to Your Universe

You can add an object in just a few steps:
1. Select the class in the Universe window where you will add your new
object and click Insert Object.
You can also right-click the class and select Insert Object.
The Edit Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-3.
2. Enter a name for your object in the Name text box.
We recommend carefully naming your object in a way that makes 
sense to other users. Don’t use the column names that you find in the
database schema; not everyone has access to the schema and they 
may be confused by unusual-looking object names.
3. Click the >> button to the right of the Select area.
The Edit Select Statement window opens, as shown in Figure 8-4.
4. Add a Select statement from the Tables and Columns, Classes and
Objects, Operators and Functions areas or manually add it in the 
text box.
Some knowledge of SQL is helpful here. If you don’t know SQL, ask your
administrator. Otherwise, you can leave this blank for now.
5. Back on the Definition tab, select Number from the Type drop-down
list for all numeric formats, dates, and alphanumerics.
6. Add a brief description in the Description text box, which is available
for users that use the object in the Query Panel.
7. Click OK.
The new object appears under the class in the Universe window.
Figure 8-3:
The Edit
Properties
dialog box.
90
Part II: Universes 

Doing things automatically
If you want to use the drag-and-drop approach, you can always add an object
automatically in Designer. This involves dragging a table column from the
Structure pane and dropping it into a class in the Universe pane.
You do have to pay attention if you use the automatic option. Make sure 
you drop the object exactly where you want it to appear. Designer takes the
liberty of assigning the newly created object to the class closest to which you
dragged the column. So, if you’re not paying attention or aren’t fully awake
when creating an object, be sure to verify that your object is exactly where
you expected it to be! Don’t worry too much if you accidentally drop your
object into the wrong place; you can always move it again via drag-and-drop!
Don’t forget that by creating an object automatically, Designer also automati-
cally names your object, using the column name. Keeping the column 
name as the object name might confuse users who aren’t used to seeing 
the schema and column-name conventions. We recommend giving the object
a more user-friendly name. You’re simply creating a representation of the
actual data-source data, which isn’t always user-friendly.
The advantage of adding an object manually automatically sets the default
object properties for you. In addition to naming the object, Designer also sets
the default data type based on the column data type. 
To create an object in Designer automatically, follow these steps:
1. Select a column from a table in the Structure pane.
2. Drag the column under a class in the Universe pane.
Figure 8-4:
The SQL
editor.
91
Chapter 8: Adding Dimensions to Your Universe

3. (Optional) Double-click the class to open the Edit Properties dialog
box and make any changes to the object name, data type, or strategy
that you need.
Creating a Measure
Creating a measure is really quite easy! Simply drag and drop a column from
the table and your dimension is automatically created. Figure 8-5 shows a
measure defined as Number of Customers and displayed by country.
Figure 8-6 shows the same measure Number of Customers displayed 
by region.
Depending on the associated dimension, the value of the measure is 
different. To implement this feature inside Designer, you have to use an SQL
aggregation function in the SELECT clause of the object and set the Object
type to Measure. Most common SQL aggregation functions are Sum, Count,
Count (Distinct), Max, Min. For more aggregation functions, see the 
documentation for your particular database.
Creating Classes
Your classes are essentially groups and subgroups into which your objects
are organized. Just as with objects, you can create classes either manually 
or automatically in BusinessObjects Designer, using your table and 
Universe pane.
Figure 8-6:
Customers
by region.
Figure 8-5:
Customers
by country.
92
Part II: Universes 

Before you start creating groups, spend some time organizing your data and
thinking up logical categories that would make appropriate group names.
For simplicity and better organization, you can also create subclasses for
your objects. This allows you to arrange objects into subsets for a specific
class — another way to facilitate the user experience for your colleagues.
When working with a large body of data, it’s essential that you maintain as
tidy a house as possible.
Creating a brand, spankin’ 
new class manually
Is one way of creating a new class inherently better than another? That all
depends! If you took our advice in the previous section and decided to think
up a hierarchy of classes with user-friendly, appropriate names, then you are
probably better off creating classes manually. You save the time and hassle of
having to edit all the default properties. Instead, you can create and set the
properties without having to backtrack.
To create a new class manually, follow these steps:
1. In BusinessObjects Designer, verify that you are in the Universe pane
and click Insert Class. 
Alternatively, you choose Insert➪Class.
The Edit Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7:
Adding
classes.
93
Chapter 8: Adding Dimensions to Your Universe

2. Enter the name of the class in the Class Name box.
Class and subclass names should be unique in the universe. If you have 
a Location class for your Human Resources department, you cannot
create another Location class for your product line. On the other hand,
you can have multiple objects using the name in the universe; the unique-
ness of an object name is only limited to the same class. Along those
lines, the class name and object name pair should have unique names.
3. (Optional) Add a description in the Description box.
4. Click OK if you are done.
Clicking Apply saves your changes without closing the dialog box. 
You cannot add multiple classes; you can only update the current class.
To add multiple new classes, you must start over with Step 1.
The Universe pane displays your new class, ready for use (as shown in
Figure 8-8).
Creating a class automatically
Creating a new class automatically is very similar to creating a new object
automatically. You simply select the table you want and drag it to your
Universe pane in Designer. 
This way of creating a class has the same drawbacks as creating an object
automatically. Designer uses the table name as the default class name. It’s
possible that the table names in your table schema aren’t very user-friendly
and they’re not readily understandable to all users. For that reason, you
should make it a point to edit the new class name right away.
Creating a class automatically also does one other little thing: It creates new
objects for the class. In addition to modifying the class name, you can also
edit the newly created objects and their properties.
To create a new class automatically, follow these steps:
1. Select a table in your table schema.
Figure 8-8:
The
Universe
pane shows
your new
class.
94
Part II: Universes 

2. Drag the table to the Universe pane and drop it where you want it to
appear in relation to the existing class hierarchy.
The new class appears in the Universe pane, within the hierarchy, using
the default table name (as shown in Figure 8-9). It also contains an
object for every table column included in the drag sequence; if you
dragged a table and included five columns, the new class contains 
five objects.
You can always modify your class by double-clicking its corresponding folder
or by right-clicking it and choosing Edit➪Class Properties.
Using subclasses
Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that you can use subclasses to better
organize your objects within a class. Why stop there? You can even plan on
using subclasses within your subclasses if it’s really necessary.
To create a subclass, follow these steps:
1. Click an existing class folder or name in the Universe pane.
2. Choose Insert➪Subclass.
3. Add a name and a description for the subclass.
4. Click OK.
The subclass appears in the Universe pane under the selected class, as
shown in Figure 8-10.

95
Chapter 8: Adding Dimensions to Your Universe

Creating a List of Values
For each object, you can create a corresponding list of specific values that
you associate with the object — various specific names the object can have;
the result is called (wait for it) a list of values (LOV). So, if you create a query
that has (say) a City object, that object would have a list of values — say,
Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Sfax — associated with it. 
If you do nothing, which is the default behavior for dimensions and details, a
list of values is created on the fly. In this case, all cities are displayed.
You can use a list of values in several ways. If you’re using WebI, you can 
use the “show list of values” operand that is displayed when you run your
query and apply a condition. If you apply any sort of restriction to the 
values associated with an object, a list of values (LOV) is displayed, showing
the available options to the user.
Lists of values require one of two types of data source: either a database file
or an external file (such as Microsoft Excel or a text file). 
96
Part II: Universes 
Searching for an object
You have two choices when searching for your
object in all the classes and objects that you cre-
ated. The first option is to use the Find/Replace
dialog box. This feature is the same as searching
a table as demonstrated in the previous chapter.
The dialog box provides some advanced search
features (you can search in names, descriptions,
or SQL) and lets you replace some characters
with others. For example, if you created an object
using the word Employee but the correct word
is really Collaborator, you can replace
Employer with Collaborator.
The second way, which is easier and more 
low-tech, is to use the Find text box at the bottom
of the Universe window. Type the name of 
your object or class in this text box, and
BusinessObjects selects it in the list, as shown
in the following figure.

The data in the external file is not dynamic and cannot change, while the
opposite is true for database files. If you are using an external file, you can’t
share it with other users or WebI.
If you are the universe designer in your operation, you have some pretty
heavy responsibilities here. It’s your job to define the query setting’s 
conditions on a new query called SELECT DISTINCT. Objects use this 
query to return the list of values. You also have to specify when the 
list should be refreshed — or even how the list of values should appear 
on-screen.
To define these properties and options for the LOV file, follow these steps:
1. Double-click an object in the Universe pane.
2. Click the Properties tab in the Edit Properties dialog box (as shown in
Figure 8-11).
3. Select the Associate a List of Values checkbox.
4. (Optional) If you want to share your list of values with others, check
the Export with Universe checkbox (refer to Figure 8-11).
5. Click Edit.
A Query Panel appears. 
6. (Optional) Modify it but leave your object in first position.
For example, you can add the State objects and apply an ascending
sort on the State object by clicking the Sort button on the toolbar, as
shown in Figure 8-12.

Using Your
Desktop for
Reporting

In this part. . .
I
t seems that everything these days is Web-based; it’s
almost a surprise to stumble across any software that
still runs using an icon and is found on your C:\ drive.
Okay, perhaps that’s a slight exaggeration, but it’s still
true that BusinessObjects lets you create queries and 
documents from a desktop application called Desktop
Intelligence (aka DeskI). 
The chapters in this part show you everything you need
to know to keep BusinessObjects a desktop tool. In addi-
tion to the basics (Chapter 9), you find out about queries
and how to create them using either the Report Wizard or
manually (Chapter 10). Stick around and you even create
your first BusinessObjects document in Chapter 11.

T
he term reporting is frequently used in business intelligence; in
BusinessObjects, reporting is the process of viewing, analyzing, and 
sharing data. The BusinessObjects reporting features are what most users
will spend the most time using.
You can use BusinessObjects’ reporting capabilities with either of two 
different applications: 
 Desktop Intelligence: This is a thick-client application that resides on 
a full-featured desktop computer and works in familiar ways.
 Web Intelligence: Lovingly referred to as WebI, this application resides
on the network server. You access such thin-client (or lean-client) 
applications as a client, usually via a Web browser. 
No, thick-client and thin-client have nothing to do with an application’s weight
problem. Thick-client, or fat-client applications, are installed on a desktop
computer in the traditional manner (usually by clicking a setup.exe file)
and then connected to a network. Conversely, thin-client, or lean-client,
applications are server-based, which means that you access them as a client,
usually via a Web browser. 
In this chapter, we show you how to get started with Desktop Intelligence.
(We cover WebI in Part IV.) Both reporting tools have their advantages and
disadvantages. Ultimately, the answer to “which is better?” is answered by a
user’s specific needs. One major advantage to using WebI in your organiza-
tion is that a company’s IT guy doesn’t have to maintain a hundred different
desktop application installations. On the other hand, WebI doesn’t have all 
of the features that Desktop Intelligence provides, such as OLAP.

If you’re working remotely, WebI may be more convenient; you don’t have to
be at your work computer to access your reports. If you travel extensively
and require immediate access to BusinessObjects reporting, you may want to
use WebI. If you work with reports primarily at your office, then Desktop
Intelligence is a perfect way to get things done.
Getting Yourself Connected
After someone with administrative network privileges (it could be you) 
creates a universe and fills it with information from the chosen metadata
source, you can get down to working with Desktop Intelligence. (Of course, 
if you have not yet created a universe, you can also use one of the bundled
universes that are available for inclusion during installation.)
Yes, a universe fits on a disc. For more about universes as business-intelli-
gence entities that contain business metadata (but no stray asteroids), see
Chapter 5.
To start using Desktop Intelligence, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪
BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Desktop Intelligence.
The BusinessObjects Login dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-1.
If you’re not quite sure how to log in to BusinessObjects, contact your
BusinessObjects administrator. Don’t take the risk of locking yourself
out by entering the wrong combination repeatedly (and don’t feel it’s
necessary to use all three attempts!)
2. Select your system from the System drop-down list.
This is the name of the machine hosting your BusinessObjects 
application.
3. Enter your user name and password in the User Name and Password
text boxes.
4. Select your authentication mode from the Authentication 
drop-down list.
Most likely this is Enterprise. You can select Work in Offline Mode if
you’re not currently connected to the Internet. The Offline Mode is
useful if you’re not connected to the Internet or your Enterprise net-
work; this means that you don’t have repository access.
102
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

5. Click OK.
When you’ve successfully logged in to Desktop Intelligence, the New Report
Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Your user name must have appropriate privileges set in order to use 
Desktop Intelligence. For example, if you’re not authorized to create a new
report, the File➪New command is dimmed. If you’re responsible for your
BusinessObjects environment, you can always choose Tools➪Login As and
log in as the Administrator.

Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

Interfacing the Desktop 
Intelligence Interface
Before you can start working with the reporting features available in Desktop
Intelligence, we recommend spending a few moments becoming familiar with
the interface (shown in Figure 9-3). While it may seem somewhat unintuitive
the first time you use the program, BusinessObjects is very helpful — it
almost always has a wizard available to help you get going quickly. If the
wizard appears and you want to jump right in to Desktop Intelligence, cancel
the wizard and you’ll be on your own!
Figure 9-3:
The Desktop
Intelligence
interface.
104
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 
Switching to a different user name
Sometimes you may need to log in to Desktop
Intelligence as a different user. For example,
perhaps your account doesn’t have ample rights
to perform certain tasks. Or perhaps you’re
logged in using your personal account but need
to perform other tasks as an administrator.
Instead of having to waste time by logging out of
Desktop Intelligence and then logging in as
another user, you can save time by simply
switching user accounts.
You can use the Desktop Intelligence Login As
feature to change user accounts on the fly.
Desktop Intelligence quickly logs out your cur-
rent user name and then logs you in again, using
the desired account.
To use this feature in Desktop Intelligence,
choose Tools➪Login As. Log in with the User
Identification dialog box (refer to Figure 9-1), this
time supplying the user name and password you
want to change to. Desktop Intelligence loads
again, using those account settings as if you just
launched the application.

When you log in to Desktop Intelligence, the New Report Wizard appears by
default. To bypass the wizard, deselect the Run This Wizard at Startup option
on the wizard’s first screen (refer to Figure 9-2).
Until you start tinkering with reports (discussed later in this chapter), 
the interface displays only a portion of what you can do with Desktop
Intelligence. Don’t be misled; that’s just the tip of the iceberg! You can 
perform some fairly hefty tasks without even touching the report:
 You can import any existing universes that aren’t in your machine’s 
universe folder.
 You can create or modify lists of values or in your universes.
 You can create or modify user objects in your universes.
The list of values is a list of data values for an object; a user object is a
combination of two or more objects in a universe. (More about those in
an upcoming section.)
Importing a universe
DeskI will automatically import the universes you need when you log on; the
universes are also refreshed when necessary. However, you can manually
import a universe with DeskI.
To import a universe in to Desktop Intelligence, follow these steps.
1. In Desktop Intelligence, choose Tools➪Universes.
The Universes dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:
The
Universes
dialog box.
105
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

2. Select the name of the universe you want to import.
To find out which universes can be imported, look in the Status column
for any universe set to To be imported. A universe that is Up to
date or has a blank status cannot be imported.
Click the Refresh button so you’re certain you have the freshest data
available to you. 
3. Click Import.
A dialog box appears, stating that the import was successful (as shown
in Figure 9-5). The status of the universe changes from To be
imported to Up to date.
4. Click OK and then, in the Universes dialog box, click Close.
The Universes dialog box closes.
If an error occurs, try importing the universe again. We also recommend look-
ing for any error message that indicates the source of the problem; even if a
solution isn’t provided, the error message may be sufficiently clear that you’ll
have a good idea as to how to correct the problem.
Feeling the LOV (list of values)
The list of values (LOV) is a list of numbers that describe aspects of a given
object in your universe. In Desktop Intelligence, you can use the LOV to
select a data source or personal file, edit its role using the Query Panel (as
detailed in Chapter 10), select a view for your list of values, or even purge
values. The primary use of the LOV is with prompts and the Query Panel
Quick filter feature.
The List of Values window shows only classes that have objects with lists of
values. You can create and change those objects and values in various ways.
Follow these steps to work with the LOV in Desktop Intelligence:
1. In Desktop Intelligence, choose Tools➪Universes.
The Universes dialog box appears (refer to Figure 9-4).
Figure 9-5:
A
successful
universe

106
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

2. Select the name of the universe whose LOV you want to edit.
You can modify the list of values for any universe you’ve imported. (If
haven’t imported a universe yet, see the previous section.)
3. Click the List of Values button.
The List of Values dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-6.
4. Expand the desired class from the collapsible menu, and then select
an object.
5. In the Properties section, select whether the List of Values uses 
corporate data or personal data.
Your choices look like this:
• Corporate Data: This option is the default. Leave the Corporate
Data radio box selected if you’re using metadata from a universe.
• Personal Data: If the data source is a personal data file, select this
option. If you do so, a dialog box appears, letting you know that
you’re about to change data types.
If you make any changes to the LOV directly in DeskI, these changes are
only available on your DeskI instance. In other words, your changes
won’t be available to other users via WebI, nor can you share your
changes with other users. If your universe designer modifies the LOV
that you have changed and then updates the universe, all of your
changes are lost.
6. Click Edit.
The Query Panel opens, showing a list of objects available in your 
universe (it’s a collapsible menu, as in the List of Values window).
7. Drag and drop objects into the Query Panel.
Figure 9-6:
The List of
Values
dialog box.
107
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

This is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10. 
8. Click Save and Close to go back to the List of Values dialog box.
The List of Values window reappears.
9. Click Display.
The List of Values of X appears (Here X is a placeholder for the name of
the selected object.) Figure 9-7 shows the List of Values of Month Name.
10. Choose whether to display the values with a tabular or hierarchical
view.
The tabular view displays the values similar to how a table is displayed,
while the hierarchical view displays the values in hierarchical order.
To see the most recent list of values, click the Refresh button. You can
also choose Show Selected Only if you want to show only the objects
selected in your query.
11. Click OK to go back to the Lists of Values dialog box.
12. (Optional) Click Purge to delete any obsolete values that are no longer
in the universe.
By purging your data, you can be sure that unauthorized people won’t
be able to see values that they should not see.
13. Click OK to go back to the Universes dialog box.
14. Click Close when you’re done modifying the List of Values in all your
universes.
Don’t forget that if you used a personal data file, WebI has an empty LOV and
you’re not able to refresh it.

Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

User objects (users in the universe)
You can also create, modify, or delete user objects — the organized metadata
describing each user in your universe — from Desktop Intelligence. From the
User Objects window, you can add, edit, or remove user objects. However,
you cannot modify or remove universe objects.
The following steps show how to add a new user object to your universe:
1. In Desktop Intelligence, choose Tools➪Universes.
The Universes window appears (refer to Figure 9-4). This feature is also
available from the Query Panel.
2. Select the name of the universe whose user objects you want to edit.
You can use or modify the list of values for any universe you’ve
imported, otherwise it will be imported automatically. (If you haven’t 
yet imported a universe and its accompanying list of values, see the 
previous section.)
3. Click the User Objects button.
The User Objects dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-8.
4. Click Add.
The User Object dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-9. The window
features two tabs: Definition and Formula. 
Don’t be confused by the similar names. The User Objects and User
Object dialog boxes are two different dialog boxes.
Figure 9-8:
The User
Objects
dialog box.
109
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

5. On the Definition tab, set the appropriate options.
Your choices are as follows:
• Name and Description: Set a name and description for the 
user object.
• Type: Select whether your user object’s data type is character,
date, or numerical (from the Type drop-down list).
• Qualification: You can declare your user object as a dimension
(numerical data that is a result of previous calculations), detail
(data such as customer names and addresses), or a measure
(data on a single object).
By default, the user object is declared as a Dimension. If you opt 
to define the user object as a Measure, a Measure drop-down 
list appears that allows you to select a function to be used with 
the measure (Sum, Max, Min, Avg, and Count). Likewise, if you
declare your user object as a Detail, you can select an associated
dimension for which the Detail object provides information.
6. On the Formula tab, create a formula.
The Formula tab lets you create or edit user-object formulas, as shown
in Figure 9-10.
a. Double-click a value in the Classes and Objects section.
b. Select a function from the Functions section.
c. Select an operator from the Operators section. 
d. Test your formula by clicking Test.
A dialog box appears, indicating whether the formula is properly
assembled.
Figure 9-9:
The User
Object
dialog box.
110
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

7. Click OK.
The User Objects dialog box reappears, displaying the name of your new
user object (as shown in Figure 9-11). The new user object can now be
used like another universe object in the Query Panel.
If you are unable to launch the Query Panel, check in your universe folder
and make sure that you have an UDO (user-defined object) file named
MyUniverse.udo with a 0K file size. Delete this file to launch the Query
Panel. UDO objects are stored locally in the MyUniverse.udo file. Every
time you open the Query Panel, an empty UDO file is created, but is 
occasionally left behind by BusinessObjects.
Figure 9-11:
The new
user object.
Figure 9-10:
The 
Formula tab.
111
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

To remove a user object from your universe, click the user object’s name and
then click Delete in the User Objects dialog box. The selected object disap-
pears; the list of user objects is then updated in real time.
To edit a user object, select its name and then click Edit in the User Objects
dialog box. The User Object (singular!) dialog box appears. There you can
edit the properties you set when you initially added the object.
Before we move on to the next section, there’s more that you should know
about user-defined objects (UDOs). These are local objects, which means
that they cannot be shared with other users and other computers. In some
cases in InfoView (for example, when SQL is regenerated), you may have
some SQL generation issues, so use this kind of object carefully.
Should you need to share your UDOs, integrate them inside your universe.
You can ask your universe designer to do this using Designer. If you’d like 
to do it yourself, choose Insert➪UserObjects in Designer, and select the
Myuniverse.udo file. Your user objects are now part of the universe with 
all the advantages of sharing and portability!
Setting the (default) style
Before you can start creating and editing reports, you have to set up how they
appear in Desktop Intelligence. You can set eye-catching (or purely practical)
visual aspects for your reports such as display formats, borders, shading, and
other minutiae that give your report an authoritative appearance.
Tweaking your reports can take a decent (or indecent) amount of time. Don’t
be afraid to keep modifying your style settings until you feel you have it 
right! Even if you’re new to BusinessObjects, if you’ve worked with Microsoft
Excel, adapting to BusinessObjects reports is pretty quick; they have some
Excel-like features.
Follow these steps to customize your report styles:
1. In Desktop Intelligence, choose Tools➪Standard Report Styles.
The Standard Report Styles window appears, as shown in Figure 9-12.
The window is neatly organized, which makes customizing your report
styles relatively easy:
• The Report Components section takes most of the left side of the
screen. It features five distinct components and their subcompo-
nents, all of which can be set.
• The right side of the screen contains the various tabs that are
available for a particular component or subcomponent. Depending
on what you select in Report Components, the tabs change 
on the fly.
112
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

2. Expand a component from the Report Components section and use
the various tabs to set preferences.
Each component has a distinct set of preferences, represented by tabs.
The components also have various subcomponents, each with its 
own settings.
3. Click OK.
You set all the features in the Standard Report Styles window in a similar
manner using radio buttons and checkboxes. For example, Figure 9-13 shows
the settings for the Alignment tab of any subcomponent.
Don’t worry if you feel that you’ve already specified a similar setting. It’s
likely you have — but now you can apply that setting somewhere else 
in your report.
Figure 9-13:
The
Alignment
tab.
Figure 9-12:
Standard
Report
Styles.
113
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

So far we’ve shown just a small sample of the many different features you can
set. We recommend you take a closer look at these:
 Create additional breaks or sections: The Standard Report Styles
window provides a single sublevel. If you need a second or third 
sublevel, select the component (or one of its Level 1 subcomponents)
and then click Add. A new subcomponent, named Level 2, appears 
in the hierarchical menu. This subcomponent is the spitting image of 
the higher-level component — Level 2, by default, has exactly the same
properties as Level 1. If you’ve changed the initial Level 1 settings at 
all before creating Level 2, those changes appear in both levels.
You can always click a subcomponent and click Delete if you find a 
subcomponent is no longer necessary.
 Work with values: If you select Boolean in the Category section, you
have two options:
• Existing values: The text boxes in the Properties section automati-
cally fill up with the existing values. Simply change the content of
the text boxes as necessary and click Add.
• Creating new values: If you want to create new values, you have
two options. Fill in the empty text boxes in Properties. If you click
Add or OK, the new values appear in the Format section. 
You can always remove a customized value by clicking the value in 
the Format section. Just remember that you can’t delete a default value,
even if you have additional value sets available.
Changing Your Password
For security reasons, it’s a good idea to change your password regularly. In
Desktop Intelligence, you can change your user password that affects your
account across the set of BusinessObjects applications.
Your BusinessObjects administrator most likely applied a setting that
requires you to change your password after a certain period of time.
The first time you log on to BusinessObjects, you should change your 
password for security reasons (if you’re not prompted automatically to 
do so). If you’re unable to change your password, it’s possible that your
BusinessObjects administrator disabled password changing for your 
user account.
If you change your password, your Enterprise password changes. Changing
your password doesn’t change your password if you log on to
BusinessObjects using any other kind of authentication.
114
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Follow these steps to change your password in Desktop Intelligence:
1. In Desktop Intelligence, choose Tools➪Change Password.
The Change Password dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-14. 
2. Enter your current password, your new password, and then confirm
the new password by entering it again.
Creating a password for BusinessObjects means following the same
security rules as when you create a PIN for your bank card. Don’t use 
a password so long that you’re likely to forget it — or, for that matter,
one so short that it’s easy to guess. Avoid using personal information
that people familiar with you might be able to guess, such as birthdays,
children’s names, favorite sports (or teams), and so on.
3. Click OK.
The new password goes into effect. You must use the new password the
next time you log in to BusinessObjects.
If you cancel the Change Password dialog box, you risk disabling (locking)
your account. A warning screen appears, telling you as much; if your account
locks so you can’t log in, contact your BusinessObjects administrator and ask
him or her to unblock your account.
You should keep in mind a few rules when creating your password. By follow-
ing these rules, you will save yourself a lot of frustration and headaches by
avoiding an invalid password warning:
 Your password must contain at least 5 characters and no more than 20.
 The first character of the password must be alphabetic.
 An ideal password contains at least one special character (such as punc-
tuation marks) and two alphabetic characters.
 Typically the following characters can be used when creating a pass-
word (but check with your administrator): 
• A small range of symbols (@ # $ % ^ & + = -)
• Letters a through z and A through Z
Figure 9-14:
The Change
Password
dialog box.
115
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

• Numbers 0 through 9
• Space (except as the initial character).
Of course, your BusinessObjects administrator may establish different rules.
The best way to be clear is to check directly with your administrator!
Exploring Your Options
Before you get swept away into using reports, we’d be remiss if we didn’t
explain a few nuts and bolts of Desktop Intelligence — in particular, the 
application-related settings that let you determine how it performs.
The Options dialog box has seven tabs, where you can set such features as
the user-interface language, file locations for templates and universes, and 
so on. (See Figure 9-15.)
When you click a tab in the Options dialog box, BusinessObjects provides a
one-line description of the tab’s purpose. In the following sections, we take a
look at each tab.
As you go through the tabs, keep in mind that you don’t need to regulate
every aspect of Desktop Intelligence. (It’s a bit smarter than that.)
Figure 9-15:
The Options
dialog box.
116
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

General
On the General tab, you can take care of three primary tasks: set the interface
language, designate the location of a graphics editor, and set start-up options.
In the Start-Up Options section, we recommend selecting Show Welcome
Wizard and Notify Document Reception. It’s helpful in several ways:
 If you’re new to Desktop Intelligence, the wizard offers a cheery greeting
that helps you get your bearings.
After you’re comfortable with Desktop Intelligence, you can always
come back to Options and deselect this option.
 The Notify Document Reception option is helpful when you send a
report to someone; this feature contacts you and lets you know when a
report has been received. 
 The Reopen Last Open Documents option opens the last-viewed report
by default when you log in to Desktop Intelligence.
The Settings section of the General tab lets you set individual preferences for
the application. For example, you can
 Set how many entries to show in the recent file list.
 Tell Desktop Intelligence to use an older BusinessObjects format when
printing reports.
 Set a graphics editor for working with graphic files.
More specifically, this tab allows you to
 Automatically Import Universe: Universes are automatically 
imported in Desktop Intelligence. This is the option that makes it 
so; we recommend leaving it enabled by default.
 Print as BusinessObjects 4.1: This prints your documents using the
standards of the 4.1 release. Unless you need this, we recommend 
leaving it disabled.
 Always Ask Before Opening Documents with Macros: This is enabled
by default for security purposes. We recommend leaving it, just as 
you probably do in other applications that have a similar feature (for
example, Microsoft Word).
 Show Recently Used File List: This is enabled and set to 5 by default. We
see no real reason to change it other than personal preference.
117
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

The most interesting aspect of this tab, however, is the Language section.
BusinessObjects contains an impressive list of installed languages. You can
select a language using the Language drop-down list; then click the button to
the right of the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 9-16.
Save
The Save tab, not surprisingly, determines how Desktop Intelligence saves
your reports. We recommend these settings:
 Automatic Save As: It would be wise to save the file automatically every
five minutes. It’s very easy to get absorbed in your work and forget to
regularly save your work; this kind of oversight can prove to very costly
should anything go wrong, such as a power failure. 
 Automatic Open After Save As: Automatically open your document
every time you use the save as command.
 Refresh Document When Opening: Refresh a document automatically
every time it’s opened. By selecting this option, you can be certain 
that you’re always working with the freshest data — a crucial part of
reporting! 
Refreshing data can take up to 30 minutes. You may want to schedule
your report every night at a “off-peak” time if you have a lot of data. 
 Protection Password and Write Reservation Password: If you’re worried
about compromising the security of your reports, you can require a pass-
word in order to open the document or to modify the document. This fea-
ture only works with Desktop Intelligence; it doesn’t work if you are using
InfoView to display your document.
Figure 9-16:

118
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Display
The Display tab offers settings you can tweak to fit your style of working; for
example, you can select which toolbars to display in Desktop Intelligence, set
measurement units for the application, and determine window appearance
(deciding whether to include such features as scrollbars). The right side of
the Display tab involves report settings. If you’ve already been using reports,
you can include delimiters, grids, or outlines.
The available options include:
 Status Bar: Selected by default, this option displays the status bar in
Desktop Intelligence.
 Formula Bar: This option allows you to display the Formula bar in
Desktop Intelligence. If you plan on working with your documents in
DeskI, we recommend enabling it.
 Measurement Units: This option allows you to display measurements 
in metric or imperial standard.
 Horizontal Scroll Bar: This option, selected by default, allows you to
display horizontal scroll bars in your window.
 Vertical Scroll Bar: Also selected by default, this option allows you to
display vertical scroll bars in your window.
 Report Tabs: Also selected by default, this option allows you to display
report tabs in your window.
 Report Options: This option lets you set a number of options for 
viewing your report in DeskI, including alerts, outlines, cell or section
delimiters, or grid features.
 Height: This option lets you set the height of the grid if you selected the
grid options in Report options.
 Width: This option lets you set the width of the grid if you selected the
grid options in Report options.
Drill
The Drill tab provides a number of options for when you work with reports.
Working with reports is discussed in Chapter 11; however, we recommend
using the default settings.
The Drill tab provides a number of options relating to pop-up menus, drilling,
and display options. These include:
119
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

 Popup Menus: This section lets you set the number of entries in the
Explore List (Explore List Up to X Entries). You can also select whether
to show the number of data rows for variables (Show Number of Data
Rows for Variables).
 Drill Toolbar: Select the Confirmation Message Before Closing option to
display a dialog box confirming that you wish to close the application.
 Display Options: This section lets you change your cursor (Change
Cursor to Magnifying Glass), show the next dimension as a tooltip
(Tooltip to Show Next Dimension to Explore), or add sums and percent-
ages on measures (Add Sum on Measures, Add Percentage on Measures).
Select the Tooltip to Show Next Dimension to Explore option and click
the Format Tooltip button to set the appearance of your tooltip.
 Drill Mode: This section lets you set how you should drill your reports,
either by creating a new report (Create New Report), keep an existing
report (Keep Existing Report), or by prompting the user (Prompt User).
 Drill Through: Select the Apply Drill Filters option to drill through 
a document.
File Locations
The File Locations tab lets you set default file locations for documents, 
templates, universes, add-ins, XML sources, and filters. To change a file loca-
tion, simply click the file type and then click Change. The Browse for Folder
window appears; simply click the desired folder location and then click OK.
The file locations are:
 User Documents
 User Templates
 Universes
 Add-Ins
 XML Sources
 XML filters
Unless you have a compelling reason to change the default locations, we 
recommend leaving these file locations as they are.
New Document
The New Document tab determines how Desktop Intelligence prepares new
documents.
120
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Be careful with the options in this tab; changing these settings can have an
impact on the File➪New menu.
You can instruct Desktop Intelligence on how to create a new document: 
 Open a blank report when you create a new document: Select the
Systematically Create a Blank Document option. Desktop Intelligence
takes it from there whenever you create a new document.
 Launch the New Report Wizard: Select the Invoke the New Report
Wizard with the Following Settings options. Then specify the settings
you want Desktop Intelligence to use.
The best option for you depends on your level of experience with Desktop
Intelligence. If you’re comfortable working without the wizard, there’s no
reason not to start with a blank document. 
This tab also lets you determine the initial report layout:
 Use a specific template: Choose the Select a Template option. 
 Run as a standard report: Select the Use a Standard Report option. We
recommend using this option unless you explicitly want a specific tem-
plate. This displays the report in its default format.
You can also specify the default data-source settings: 
 Select a Universe: Documents use a particular universe automatically.
 Use a Different Date Provider: Documents use a different data source
than the default provider when you create a new document.
Macros
On the final tab, Macros, you create and apply macros to Desktop
Intelligence; you run macros that you can run from the toolbar. A macro is
similar to a shortcut; it’s a recorded command that performs a series of
actions. For example, you could create a macro that lets you create a new
document in Desktop Intelligence and then save it — all in a single action.
To use macros, follow these steps:
1. Select one of the five available macro spaces in the Macros tab.
2. Enter a tooltip name in the Tooltip text box.
This name appears in the toolbar to identify your macro.
3. Click the button to the left of the Tooltip text box.
The Macros dialog box opens as shown in Figure 9-17.
121
Chapter 9: Reporting Live from the Desktop

4. Select, apply, create, or delete macros. 
Should you opt to create a macro, you must already be familiar with
Visual Basic. Macro authoring in Desktop Intelligence is done using a
Visual Basic Editor.
Creating a macro is beyond the scope of this book. If you want to try your
hand at a macro, check out Visual Basic 2005 For Dummies, by Bill Sempf
(published by Wiley).

Chapter 10
Building Queries
In This Chapter
 Using the Query Panel
 Creating a new query
 Using multiple data providers
I
n the previous chapter, you find out how to define a business object in
Universe Designer. In the business intelligence world, a business object is
an entity that has a meaning for you or your organization. It’s much easier for
you to work with entities, such as country, product, or sales rather than
using the technical SQL definition. In this chapter, you discover how to use
the business objects to build your documents. 
For example, say you own a clothing store and need to order inventory from
the warehouse. You need 20 large red shirts and 15 Hawaiian shirts (size XL),
and 30 pairs of black pants (36-inch waist). As the store manager, you don’t
care about the details, you just want the merchandise quickly so that you can
package it nicely and present it to customers.
BusinessObjects works in a similar fashion. You want to package your data
nicely in a document, through blocks and charts. Before you can display 
the data, you must request them from your universe, perhaps even using 
multiple data providers.
This leads to the word query, which has to be one of the most versatile words
in the business intelligence language, especially when you’re working with
BusinessObjects. Just think about it. It can mean many things and take several
forms, as a noun or a verb. In earlier chapters, you created a universe; now it’s
time to use the objects that make up that universe and put on your hard hats.
You build a query, which eventually you use to create a document.

If you’re having a difficult time trying to figure out what a query is, you can
think of it like the brick and mortar that connects the house (your report) 
to the foundation (the universe). The query really is the building block(s)
that comprise your document. In this chapter, you use the query as a data
provider to set BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence up for generating
reports. 
Queries are really the most interactive part of your BusinessObjects experi-
ence. If you don’t have a query, you don’t have a reporting tool — and
where’s the fun in that? Even if you’re just one of a hundred BusinessObjects
users in your office, queries are the one chance you get to be the boss and
decide what to use, and how much. 
You build queries in this chapter using the Query Panel. Don’t worry; 
that’s just a fancy name for the window that you use. The BusinessObjects
Query Panel is something like a Burger King. You walk in, have it your 
way, and then, in theory, are given a made-to-order product that is to your
satisfaction.
But enough of these bad analogies; get working with queries!
Using the Query Panel
As with most tasks in BusinessObjects, there is more than one way to use the
Query Panel. By now, you probably have a pretty good idea that whatever
you can do in Web Intelligence, you can also do in Desktop Intelligence. If so,
that’s a very astute observation. In the following sections, we first take a look
at the DeskI Query Panel, and then the WebI Query Panel.
The DeskI Query Panel
The easiest way to access the Query Panel in Desktop Intelligence is by 
using the New Report Wizard (see Chapter 9). This ensures that you haven’t
overlooked any important steps as you’re creating a new query. For example,
you wouldn’t want to, say, forget to select a universe!
After you’ve run the New Report Wizard, you find yourself face to face with
the Query Panel, as shown in Figure 10-1.
124
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

The Query Panel is neatly broken into the following sections:
 Toolbar: The toolbar is a very helpful area of the Query Panel that lets
you take care of an amazing amount of features: 
• Show/Hide All Classes: Though we’re hard-pressed to find a reason
why you’d want to hide these; it’s much easier to have them neatly
displayed for you, 
• Show/Hide Help on Selected Item: You can choose to display a con-
textual help feature with the Query Panel.
• Wrap Result Objects: You can choose to wrap result objects, which
are the objects included in a query. You can make these objects
appear in rows and columns instead of a single, long row.
• Simple Condition: More pragmatically, if you’ve already selected at
least one object, the simple condition and sort buttons become
enabled.
• Sort: Sort the results of your query, in ascending or descending
order.
• Default Scope of Analysis: In the middle of the toolbar is a drop-
down list that allows you to set your scope of analysis; this is a
fancy way of asking how deep into the data do you want to explore.

125
Chapter 10: Building Queries

• Scope of Analysis: Related to the Default Scope of Analysis feature,
the Scope of Analysis feature lets you manually set the scope or
drilling details using the Alerts dialog box.
• Manage Sorts: Verify the sorts that are associated with your query
or manage multiple sorts.
• View SQL: You can verify or analyze the SQL statements in your
query using this feature.
• User Objects: You can add new objects (user objects) based on the
information in your universe using this features.
• Combine Queries: This feature lets you add a new tab to the Query
Panel so that you can combine queries, usually via the UNION
operator.
• Help: You can access the online help provided by Business Objects.
 Lest you think we went through this way too fast, not to worry, we 
discuss the toolbar in ample detail in the following sections.
Instead of using multiple queries, we recommend combining multiple
queries. Only one query is sent to the database. Multiple queries are
sent when you have Join or Synchronization in your SQL statement 
(multiple measures, different context involved).
 Classes and Objects: This box displays a hierarchical list of classes and
objects (basically a representation of your universe’s data) that you can
use to add to the query as either an object or a condition. Every element
is preceded by an icon indicating whether it’s a dimension, measure,
predefined condition, or detail.
 Result Objects: This large area is where you drag-and-drop your classes
and objects. Along with the Conditions area, this is where you make up
or determine your query’s content.
 Conditions: This area is used in conjunction with the Results Objects
area, where you drag-and-drop conditions to apply in your query.
In the Conditions area, you create your query filtering conditions by
dragging and dropping predefined conditions, or by creating your own
conditions by dragging and dropping dimensions and then defining your
own parameters
 Options: This feature lets you set options for the current query.
 Save and Close: Perhaps you want to create a query, but aren’t quite
ready to run it yet and generate your report. Click this button to save
your progress and then exit the Query Panel.
If your query takes time to execute, you can save your query and set up
your report: define your block formulas, tables, sections, and so on.
 View: Perhaps you are ready to generate your report, but you’re con-
cerned about how it’s going to look once you’ve created it. Rather than
126
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

go through the hassle of creating a query and then having to get rid of it,
click this button, which works like the Print Preview function in a word
processor.
View allows you to execute the query but you don’t have access to the
report part. It’s useful when you want to check your query result and
see which rows are returning by the query and if they fit your expecta-
tions.
 Run: When you’re ready to go and nothing can dissuade you, click this
button to create your query.
 Cancel: If it all seems too much, you can click Cancel to abandon your
work and quit the Query Panel. Don’t forget that once your query is can-
celled, you’re not getting it back. If you click this button within the New
Report Wizard, you go back to the Select Universe page of the wizard.
If you’re not sure of what each class or objects represents in the Query Panel,
click the Help button on the Query Panel toolbar. A frame appears across 
the bottom of the Query Panel, displaying a descriptive text for whatever 
element you click in the Classes and Objects area, as shown in Figure 10-2.
The WebI Query Panels
The Query Panel in Web Intelligence is simply a nightmare. Don’t get us
wrong; there are plenty of things to like about it, once you figure out what
you want to use.
For starters, you have three different ways of using the Query Panel:
 The Query — HTML version is a purely HTML version of the Query
Panel. While it’s quick to load and respond, it also has less versatility
than the next option, which is the Java Report Panel. 
 The Java Report panel is Java based, which means that it can be slow
and that some browsers might not enjoy the experience. On the upside,
it is quite robust and offers more features. 
 The HTML — Report Panel version is a no-nonsense Query Panel that
lets you walk step by step (or, in this case, tab by tab) through query
creation.
Figure 10-2:
The Classes
and Objects
help.
127
Chapter 10: Building Queries

Deciding which version of the Query Panel to use depends largely upon 
your administrator’s preferences. In this chapter, we use the Query — HTML
version. If you are comfortable with BusinessObjects, you may want to use
the more powerful applet instead as it provides a number of features the
Query — HTML version doesn’t, such as combined queries, subqueries, and
ranking. This can prove useful when developing a report using test data and
then putting it into production.
The Query — HTML Query Panel is very similar to the DeskI Query Panel, as
shown in Figure 10-3.
It contains the following:
 Toolbar: This toolbar lets you 
• Add a Query: You can scrap what you’re doing and start a new
query. This allows you to create more than a single query, much
like a muti-data provider in DeskI.
• View SQL: View the SQL for the query.
• Query Properties: View the query properties.
• Run Query: Run the query.
• Cancel: Cancel the query.
 Universes: This portion of the Query Panel displays the available
classes and objects that you can use to create your query. You can
either choose to display by objects or by hierarchies from the 
drop-down list.
 Result Objects: As in DeskI, this is where you drag-and-drop your
objects to be used in creating the query.
 Query Filters: As in DeskI, this is where you drag-and-drop your objects
to be used as filters in creating the query.
Figure 10-3:
The

Panel in

128
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Creating a New Query
Now that you’ve made your acquaintance with the Query Panel, you can
jump right in and actually create a query. This is the first step to creating
your own Desktop Intelligence and Web Intelligence documents.
Querying in DeskI
If you’re used to working with Desktop Intelligence, follow these steps to
create a query:
1. Open Desktop Intelligence, and choose File➪New.
The New Report Wizard appears.
2. Click Begin and then Next.
The Select a Universe page appears.
3. Select an available universe and click Finish.
The Query Panel appears.
4. Expand the Objects and Classes menus and drag and drop objects
from the hierarchy menus to the Result Objects area. 
You have to select at least one object; however, keep in mind that your
document only provides as much data as you request. For example, if
you select the Period object, the document displays the data set for that
specific selection, as shown in Figure 10-4.
5. Select any objects to act as filters and drag it to the Conditions area.
Conditions are rules that you can apply to the Query Panel when it gen-
erates your reports. For example, of all the returned data, you are only
interested in seeing products that are blue. You can select Color and
drag it to the Conditions area.
Figure 10-4:
The Query
Panel with
objects and
classes.
129
Chapter 10: Building Queries

6. Follow the instructions that appear as a highlight in the Conditions
object.
Here we added Color, double-clicked an operator from the list of opera-
tors, and then selected an operand type. For example, you can decide to
click Show list of values and select Blue.
7. Click Run.
We don’t blame you for thinking that you’re done with the query at this point.
After all, it seemed pretty straightforward, didn’t it? To be honest, that’s 
all there is to creating a query, but we’d be remiss if we told you there was
nothing else to know about the Query Panel. 
There’s an important difference between filtering in the Query Panel and
applying a report filter — and it has an effect on how long your document
takes to load:
130
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 
Using SQL through the Query Panel
In addition to creating queries, you can use the
Query Panel as a tool if you’re designing a uni-
verse or developing a document — but you have
to know a little bit more about SQL to get the
most out of that capability. When you define your
query by putting objects in the Results pane (or
by defining conditions using the Conditions
pane), the tool builds an SQL query for you auto-
matically. To see the SQL generated, click the
View SQL button on the Query Panel toolbar. 
The window that shows you the SQL looks much
the same whether you’re viewing it in DeskI or in
WebI:
 On the left side, a tree view represents all
database queries generated by the applica-
tion. The query engine may decide (accord-
ing to your universe design) to build more
than one SQL query. 
In general, if you put more than one measure
into your Results pane, the query engine 
creates one query per measure. 
 Within Web Intelligence, you have a list of
the different queries you’ve designed: 
On the right side, you can see the SQL gen-
erated for each statement. That way you
know which SQL query is sent to the data-
base, and whether it’s correct.
You can also copy the query and execute it to
check the data returned. This option is very
useful when you’re using a tiered SQL query
tool.
Advanced users can also modify their SQL
queries online in one of two ways:
 In DeskI: Check the Do Not Generate SQL
Before Running option.
 In WebI: Use the Custom SQL option.
Either way, you end up working with the data
returned by your query.

 When you apply a filter in the Query Panel, you retrieve a very limited
amount of data — in our case, only Blue products — such that a 10,000-
row query takes maybe a second to run. In the resulting document, you
can access only the data concerning Blue products.
 If you’re using a report filter, your query returns data for all products;
a 200,000-row query may take 10 seconds to execute. In the resulting
document, you have access to all the data for all the products — in this
case, all 200,000 rows — which makes the document 20 times bigger.
Such a monster document takes a lot longer to open because the engine
has a lot more rows to process.
Querying in Web Intelligence
To be honest, there aren’t a lot of differences between performing a simple
query in DeskI and in WebI. In fact, the only differences are menu names!
Here’s how to prepare your query in WebI:
1. Log on to InfoView.
2. Choose New➪Web Intelligence Document.
3. Double-click the universe that you wish to use in the New Web
Intelligence Document window.
4. In the Query Panel, select the desired objects and filters by dragging
and dropping them into either the Objects or Filters area.
5. Click Run Query.
Looking under the Query Panel’s hood
Creating a new query was easy enough, but you’ve really just scratched the
surface of what BusinessObjects XI Release 2 can do! In this section, we show
you how to use the basic features that are available and may be of great use
to you as you create your own queries.
After you create your query, you find yourself looking at a nice new docu-
ment, like the one in the HTML — Query Panel, as shown in Figure 10-5.
What might you want to do with this report? Here are a few ideas:
 Edit your report: Perhaps the report doesn’t have the level of detail you
need. Click the Document button and select Edit Query to go back to the
query panel and make changes to the selected objects and classes.
131
Chapter 10: Building Queries

 Filter your data: Perhaps you’ve ended up with too many store states
and just want to see stores in California. Right-click the State column
and select Quick Filter and then select California. (For more about Quick
Filter, see the next section.)
Limiting the results you get
Suppose you end up with results showing stores in too many states, and you
only want to see the stores in California. You can do this operation at the
report level or at the query level.
 If you’re limiting results at the report level, right-click the State
column and select Quick Filter. Doing so creates a block, section, or
report filter — with no impact on your query. The resulting document
still has data for all states stored inside it. If your document has many
reports, your filter won’t impact others reports, and they display data
for all states.
 If you’re limiting results at the report level by using the Quick Filter
mode in the report, select your objects in the Result Objects panel, and
then click the yellow icon. You are prompted to select a value from the
Universe Objects list of values. From there you can limit your results.
 If you’re limiting results for your entire document, display it at the
query level. You start by creating a new condition [State equals
California], and then run the query. Now all data displayed from this
data provider is California.
The Quick Filter has a few limitations that are important to keep in mind:
Figure 10-5:
The new
report in the
HTML —
Query
Panel.
132
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

 The Quick Filter filters only the report; it has no effect on the query, and
it doesn’t appear in the Query Panel.
 If you have a document with multiple reports, your Report Quick Filter
filters only the current report, not the entire document.
 Quick Filter is only available if you’ve deployed ASP.NET with interactive
HTML viewing.
Drilling through your document
There are many features available with BusinessObjects and its Query Panel,
but the most important feature is undoubtedly the Drill feature.
After you start analyzing your new query results, it’s likely you’ll want to take
an even closer look at what you find. Using the Drill feature, you can descend
level by level to the root of the information you seek.
For example, Figure 10-6 displays stores listed (among other criteria) by
state. There are stores in Colorado, but just by looking at the report, you
can’t tell where in Colorado the stores are. By clicking the Drill icon (it looks
like a magnifying glass) in the Query Panel, you can go to the Colorado link
and see the relevant city, as shown in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7:
The State
column,
drilled one
level.
Figure 10-6:
The list of
available
stores, 
pre-drill.
133
Chapter 10: Building Queries

At this point, you have two options:
 Drill up to your initial state by clicking the upward arrow that appears in
the header of the drilled column.
 Drill down another level by clicking the link of the corresponding city.
In this case, the drill displays the name of the store in that city. If you’re not
sure whether to drill to the next level, simply hover your mouse over the link
in Drill mode and a message appears indicating the next drill level.
When a link no longer appears in the data, no more levels of data are available
for drilling.
Here’s a rundown on how Drill Through works:
 In DeskI — and by default in WebI — when you drill out of the existing
scope (for instance, by clicking Colorado State and going from the State
level to the City level), the tools add City in the Result Objects list. After
you run your query, you still have access to the other states; you can
navigate from one to another through the top-level list box.
 WebI has another option, however: Query Filter. To find it, go to the 
document properties (in an HTML viewer); Query Filter is hidden on the
Document menu in the toolbar, in the Java applet.
 To display the report properties in the General section, you select
Document properties; the document properties panel appears at the
right side of the applet.
Using the Drill Through option, drilling from the level of (say) Colorado state
creates a Query condition [State = Colorado]. Thus, after drilling down
below Colorado in your report, you have access to only “Colorado” data —
but there’s an advantage here: If you retrieve less data, then you only have to
look at (say) Cities of the Colorado state, and not all cities. Clearly, how you
use this option depends on the amount of data you’re managing.
Drill Up/Down has some significant differences from Drill Through:
 Drill Through is more explicit in Desktop Intelligence than in Web
Intelligence. In particular, the Drill Up/Down option displays New Query,
as in Drill Up (New Query).
 After your query executes, your document stores the resulting data.
Then, when you drill up or down, you navigate inside this data without
generating any further queries against the database.
 Drill Through allows you to extend your scope and add some more
data in your query. For instance, in your query you have tour sales 
revenue by Country, State.
134
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Here’s an example: To navigate from Country to State (or vice versa),
you use the Drill Up/Down feature, but if you’re working from the State
level and you want to analyze the County level, you have to extend your
query by using the Drill Through feature.
Handling Multiple Data Providers
WebI and DeskI use essentially the same concepts to deal with data — in
much the same way the manager of a furniture store deals with furniture: 
The manager asks different service providers for items to sell (query), the
providers send her what she’s ordered (execution), she stores the furniture
in her shop (storage), and finally she uses what she has in stock to arrange
her shop nicely and bring in all those happy customers (filtering).
BusinessObjects handles data in the same straightforward way: When you
create a document, the first step is to choose your providers (in this case,
deciding which universes to use). Then you use the Query Panel to create
your query, execute it (in effect, asking your data provider for the data you
need), store the resulting data in your document; even if what you get isn’t
always visible, it’s always tucked away in the microcube (where data from the
data provider is stored for use in reports), and then use the reporting feature
to display a portion of what you have in tables, sections, and charts. When
you’re formatting the data in your document, you aren’t taking in any more
data from your provider; you simply work with the data stored in your
microcube. In DeskI, you can see what you have by using the View Data
dialog box (choose Data➪View Data).
When you create a query with Desktop Intelligence, you need to select a data
provider. That data provider can come in many forms — for example, it could
be one of your universes, or an OLAP server, a VB procedure, various XML
files, or even a personal data file.
Sometimes your queries may require several different sources to get the job
done. To use the store manager analogy, imagine a shop that stocks several
different kinds of merchandise — say, garments, furniture, and computers.
The stock has to be supplied from several different sources. Well, Web
Intelligence and Desktop Intelligence documents offer the same capability in
terms of data: You can access various sources — in the BusinessObjects
vocabulary, different data providers — to get results for your query.
From the BusinessObjects point of view, all data providers have the same
purpose: feeding data to your microcube.
Both DeskI and WebI can access multiple data providers, but each presents
you with a different panel as a starting point, and each has its own way to
handle the multiple providers.
135
Chapter 10: Building Queries

Using multiple data providers in DeskI
DeskI offers several different ways to add new data providers. In general, 
you create the first one by using the DataProvider Wizard. Then, if you need
to add more data providers, you simply use one of these methods:
 Adding a provider while inserting a new block: Choose
Insert➪Table/Crosstable or Chart (depending on the block type you
want to insert). The New Table Wizard opens, offering four ways to
select your data (see Figure 10-8).
The first of these options, Use Existing Data from the Document, doesn’t
generate a new query; it uses your existing query. The other three
options are ways to create a new data provider.
 Creating from scratch: You can insert a new data provider without
inserting a new report component. Simply choose Data➪New
DataProvider; a wizard offers you the same three options.
 Using the Data Provider dialog box: In your document, you can access
the content of your microcube by using the Data Provider dialog box:
1. Choose Data➪View Data.
From here you can see the data returned by your query.
2. Give your query a more meaningful name.
For example, you could rename the query from Query1 from
myUniverse to Sales of blue shirts.
Figure 10-8:
Select your
data.
136
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

3. Choose from among the ways you can manage the information about
your data, from whichever provider, in this window.
You can review historical statistics of how often you’ve refreshed
your data, export the result of your query to another database 
(or even to an Excel sheet), and synchronize data from several
providers. 
Adding data providers in WebI
You can also manage different data providers in Web Intelligence — but 
WebI only lets you access universes. If you need to access personal data,
don’t use Web Intelligence for this purpose.
To add a new query to your document in WebI, follow these steps:
1. Select Edit Query in the document.
You are now in the Query Panel.
2. Click the Add a Query button on the toolbar.
Web Intelligence creates a new query.
3. Select a universe based on your new query, and then build your
query as usual.
This feature is not available from the HTML report format.
If you really need access to personal data through Web Intelligence, one way
to get it is to create a universe based on (say) your Excel file and then export
it to the repository. You can use the resulting universe as you would any
other BusinessObjects universe.
If a single data provider isn’t enough to get you the information your organi-
zation requires, you can add a second data provider to your query — or 
more — in Web Intelligence. 
Linking your data sources
However, before you can use data from multiple various sources together,
you must link them so that they can be synchronized. What this does is
create a bond between common fields between the two data sources. For
example, one data source may have an Employee ID field while the other
has an ID field that has similar purposes. If you use a join to synchronize
these fields, the data is linked. 
137
Chapter 10: Building Queries

You can synchronize your data providers using either Desktop Intelligence or
Web Intelligence — but each program uses different wording to describe the
process. Web Intelligence talks about Merged Dimensions and Queries;
Desktop Intelligence refers to Linked Dimensions and Data Providers.
Here are a few rules to keep in mind when linking: 
 You must link your data otherwise BusinessObjects returns skewed data
that doesn’t accurately reflect your data. 
 You can only link dimension objects. 
 You can link an unlimited number of dimension objects. 
 Objects don’t have to have the same name.
In DeskI
If you’re working in DeskI, you use a tool called the Data Manager to link the
dimensions. The workflow to link together dimensions is similar to Web
Intelligence:
1. Create a query in DeskI.
2. Highlight the desired object, and click the Link button.
3. Select which dimension from the other data provider you want 
to link to.
4. Select the other object to link in the new window. 
5. Close the Data Manager, and generate your query!
In WebI
By default, you have to synchronize similar objects. If you’ve used the 
same object in two queries, you see a third object created when you choose
the Available Objects view in the left panel. This third object combines the
two objects that come from the two different original queries — that’s the
default behavior, anyway. But if you have two different objects with the same
meaning (say, Employee Id and id) and you want to synchronize them 
with Web Intelligence, you have to go to the Java Applet. Here’s how that
process looks:
1. Edit your document in the applet and then click the Merge Dimension
button on the toolbar.
If you are working in InfoView, make sure that you’re using the Query —
HTML panel or the Java Applet in InfoView using the Web Intelligence
tab of the Preferences page. 
The Merged Dimensions dialog box appears (as shown in Figure 10-9): 
138
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

• Available Dimensions: This part shows all the dimensions from
your different queries that are not part of a merged dimension. 
• Merged Dimensions: This part shows the merged dimensions.
2. Merge your desired dimensions by choosing them in the upper 
part of the dialog box and then clicking the Merge button.
3. Type a name for your newly merged dimension.
You can use this merged dimension with data from both queries.
BusinessObjects requires the use of merged dimensions when you’re
using multiple queries or multiple data providers. BusinessObjects
won’t let you use unmerged dimensions that come from different data
providers; you must either merge or link them.
Changing a Query to a BusinessObjects
Universe
If you’re using BusinessObjects at the corporate level, you may have to
develop a document based on a development environment, migrate the docu-
ment to a test environment, and only migrate it to a production environment
when you have the bugs worked out. In such a situation, you might have two
databases with the same structure but with radically different sizes — say, a
small set of data in the test database and millions of rows in the production
database. What this situation calls for is changing a query into a
BusinessObjects universe.
Figure 10-9:
The Merged
Dimensions
dialog box.
139
Chapter 10: Building Queries

Here’s an overview of how that process unfolds in WebI:
1. Develop your document based on the small database.
The idea here is to create a small-scale model of the universe you want,
limiting response time so you can tweak it (using some BusinessObjects
magic) the way you want. That way you won’t have to re-create your
document using production data. 
2. Create a copy of your document.
This is a standard precaution in informatics: Always work with a copy
instead of the original. You never know what might happen to your 
document before you can deploy it.
3. Edit your query on the Property tab by clicking the small button close
to the name of your desired universe.
A dialog box appears, in which you can choose the new universe for the
query. 
4. Choose the universe based on your production data, 
5. Close the dialog box and map the objects in your test universe to
those in the production universe. 
6. Run the query. 
You’re done — you have a document based on your production data.
To do the same thing with Desktop Intelligence, you have to edit the data
provider, which involves fewer basic steps:
1. Select your data provider.
2. On the Definition tab, click the button close to the name of your
desired universe.

Documents in BusinessObjects
In This Chapter
 Understanding documents and reports
 Creating a document
 Opening a document
 Working with a document
M
any users have confused two elements of BusinessObjects for 
years: the difference between Business Objects (the company) and
BusinessObjects (the product) and — oh, yeah — the difference between
reports and documents. You can find out about the former in Chapter 1; we
talk about the latter in this chapter.
Also in this chapter, we show you how to work with documents with Desktop
Intelligence (Desktop Intelligence, or DeskI, is a desktop application installed
on your computer that lets you create queries and generate documents). 
We show you the basics of working with Desktop Intelligence to create a new
document or open an existing document — and just to cover all the bases, 
we explain what a document is in BusinessObjects.
This chapter works specifically with Desktop Intelligence. If you plan on 
using WebI, see Chapter 13. Both DeskI and WebI have distinct advantages
that make both a viable option as a query and reporting tool. However, if
you’re looking to simply access documents created by your colleagues or
create a report without using advanced features that are available in DeskI,
then you might prefer using WebI. 
Reporting is the key element of BusinessObjects for most users. If you use
BusinessObjects, most of your involvement includes generating, refreshing,
and broadcasting reports that are based on data someone else in your 
organization has provided.

Knowing the Difference between
Documents and Reports
The whole question of documents versus reports is curiously stubborn.
Despite Business Objects’ best explanations and user documentation, people
still seem confused about this terminology and often use the two words 
interchangeably.
On the surface, the words seem to refer to the same thing — but getting a
handle on the differences will help you avoid any potential confusion when
you’re working with other users.
The notion of a report is something that is more closely affiliated with Crystal
Reports instead of BusinessObjects. A report can be any of several things:
 In InfoView: If you create a graphic representation of your data using
InfoView, it’s saved as a document. Your document can contain any
number of reports.
 In Desktop Intelligence: If you create a document in Desktop Intelligence,
a report is a tab inside the document. The difference is that you can use
data coming from multiple data sources in your report.
 In BusinessObjects generally: A graphic representation of your 
data-source data.
A document is less ambiguous, even if DeskI creates documents the same way
as WebI. In Desktop Intelligence, you use your data sources’ data to create a
document. This document can contain multiple reports.
In short (and as a rule), a document is the larger entity that can contain a
number of individual reports. 
Creating a New Document
The quickest way to create a document in Desktop Intelligence is by using 
the New Report Wizard. Undoubtedly, the easiest way to create a document
or report in Desktop Intelligence is through the New Report Wizard. If you 
or your administrator keep the default Desktop Intelligence settings, getting
to the New Report Wizard is as easy as launching Desktop Intelligence.
142
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

We recommend that you use the New Report Wizard until you feel you’ve
mastered document creation with Desktop Intelligence. The wizard walks you
through the creation process step by step; there’s no chance of inadvertently
forgetting a step (as you might if you’re manually creating a document).
To create a new document in Desktop Intelligence using the New Report
Wizard, follow these steps:
1. Open Desktop Intelligence by choosing Start➪All Programs➪
BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪BusinessObjects Enterprise➪
Desktop Intelligence.
2. Log on to Desktop Intelligence using your user name and password.
The application launches; the New Report Wizard appears, as shown in
Figure 11-1.
3. Select a report layout and then click Next.
Check with your BusinessObjects administrator and see whether your
company has a template that you should use when creating a document;
if so, choose the Select a Template option. If not, you can choose to
create a standard report.
4. If you opt to select a template, select a template from the available list
in the Available Templates section, and then click Next.
A preview of the template appears when you click a template in
Available Templates.
Figure 11-1:
The New
Report
Wizard.
143
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects

To select a template that’s stored somewhere else on your computer,
click the Browse button.
If you’re satisfied with a particular template, you can define it as the
default template by selecting the Default Template checkbox.
5. Choose the data source that you will use to create your report.
A report needs a data source from which to pull data that is included 
in your report.
If you select Universe, select one of the available universes in your
BusinessObjects environment from the drop-down list.
If you don’t want to use a universe, Desktop Intelligence lets you 
choose from one of five different data sources — including an XML data
provider, stored procedures, or even an Excel file. Whichever data
source you use is entirely up to you. You should use the appropriate
data source that exists for your organization.
6. If you selected a universe, click Next. If you selected another data
source, click Next or Finish, depending on your choice of source.
If you selected another data source, select the file or source and make
the necessary configurations. For example, if you chose a personal data
file, you click the Browse button to find the file, and then set a delimiter
and select any desired settings as shown in Figure 11-2.
7. If you clicked Next in the previous step and you’re working with
another data source, click Run. If you’re working with a universe,
click Finish.
If you’re working with another data source, for example, a text or Excel
file, the report displays using the file’s contents.
If you’re using a universe, the Query Panel appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-2:
Choosing a
personal
data source.
144
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

8. If you’re using a universe, select the desired classes and objects from
the expandable and collapsible menus.
The classes and objects represent the contents of your universe, which
are neatly organized in hierarchical menus: 
a. Select an object, drag it to the Objects window, and drop it there, as
shown in Figure 11-4.
b. Click the Filter icon (which represents conditions) and the list of 
pre-defined conditions in your universe is displayed. 
c. Drag any necessary predefined conditions to the Conditions window
and drop them there. You can also double-click the pre-defined 
condition for the same affect.

145
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects

9. Decide what you want to do with your report:
• Click View to preview the report in its current state prior to being
run.
• Click Save and Close to save your report-in-progress in DeskI.
• Click Run to run your report.
Your report appears, depending on your selected objects or conditions,
as shown in Figure 11-5.
Saving Your Document
After you complete your report, you may want to save it as a document for
later. If you’re creating a personal report, you can simply save it to your hard
drive. However, most likely you want to save it to a repository, which is part
of the BusinessObjects administration database system that includes space
for documents that can be shared among users.
If you plan to make your document available to other members of your team,
save your document to the repository so it’s easily accessible.
First, choose File➪Save and save the document to your userDocs folder.
From there, you can upload it to your repository:
Figure 11-5:
Your new
report.
146
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

1. When your document is saved, choose File➪Export to repository.
The Export window appears, as shown in Figure 11-6.
2. Select where to export the document.
You can either select an existing folder in the repository, or you can
create a new folder by clicking New and entering a folder name.
3. In the Document(s) to Send window, select the document to add and
click Add.
You can always remove the document by clicking its name and then
clicking Remove. If the document you’re looking for isn’t displayed, look
for it by clicking Browse.
4. Select the desired category for your document.
Click the Categories button to select an appropriate category for your
document. Click the Manage button in the Select Categories dialog box
to create or edit categories in your repository, as shown in Figure 11-7.
There is a difference between folders and categories: A document
belongs to a single folder but can belong to multiple categories.
5. Click OK twice.
When you’ve successfully exported your document, a dialog box
appears and indicates that success.
Figure 11-6:
The Export
window.
147
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects

Opening a Document
If you’ve already created a document, you can always open it with
BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence. 
If you saved your new document to your local hard drive, choose File➪Open
in Designer. However, if you or another user saved a document to your 
repository, you can import the document.
To import a document that you’ve saved to a repository, follow these steps: 
1. In Designer, choose File➪Import from Repository.
The Import window appears, as shown in Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-8:
The Import
window.
Figure 11-7:
Working
with

148
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

2. In the Browse Folders section, click the folder containing the desired
document. If you are using Categories, select the category; if browsing
through folders, select a folder. 
The documents that are in the folder appear in the primary window.
3. Select the name of the desired document.
4. Retrieve the document by clicking it, which returns the most recent
version of the document. 
In addition to retrieving your document, you can do other things:
• Click the Properties button to find out more about the document
(such as file size, source, and a timestamp).
• Click the Retrieve Inst button to return an earlier version of the
document.
• Click the Delete the Document button to delete it.
5. Select a location to save the document and then click Save.
The document is now imported from the repository and is available on
your hard drive.
If you need to send a document to a colleague, choose File➪Send to Mail.
149
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects
Open your eyes
If you have a well-fed repository, you may have
some difficulties finding your document. Don’t
worry, you don’t have to add spring cleaning to
your already long To Do list at work — just use
the Find feature to track down what you’re look-
ing for.
1. Click the Find Documents box at the bottom
of the Import window.
The Find options appear, as shown in the
following figure.
2. Select the directory to search by clicking
its name in the Browse Folders area. 
You can’t perform a search from the root
(top-level) directory; you must select at
least a subfolder.
3. Select or enter criteria for your search in
from the Where drop-down boxes.
4. Click Search.
Your document appears in the document list
if it’s found. 

Making Your Document Work for You
Great — you’ve created your first document. Of course, you’ve barely
scratched the surface of what you can do with BusinessObjects Desktop
Intelligence. You can do some pretty simple stuff, for example, give your
report a name, but you can actually perform some neat tricks with your 
data so the data works for you. For example, you can change how the data
appears graphically, as well as how it appears within the actual table.
Naming your document
Why leave your document hanging with a generic title? Not only does it look
bad, but your audience probably will have trouble understanding what the
document is all about.
To rename your new document, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the title in the box at the top of the new document.
The current title is selected and a cursor appears; this is your sign that
you can simply rename the document.
2. Type the new name in the box.
Be sure you’re actually just renaming the document and not the report
in your document! Choose your fields carefully when editing!
3. Click outside the title box.
Even though you’re done working with the title box, you’re not necessar-
ily finished with it. For example, now is the perfect opportunity to make
changes to the report title font or size.
4. (Optional) To modify the title box attributes, right-click inside the 
title box.
From here, the world is your playground as you can do several things,
including:
• Formatting the title
• Apply a standard style to your title
• Work with variables in your report
We discuss each of these in the next sections. 
150
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Naming your report
If you simply want to name the report (which is nothing more than renaming
the tab), double-click the tab or choose Tools➪Rename. You might also want
to make your report more readable with some simple formatting.
Dressing up your report title
When you right-click your report’s title and choose Cell Format, you can work
with basic text attributes in the Cell Format dialog box. 
On the Appearance tab, shown in Figure 11-9, you can apply basic text-editor
features such as font, font style (italic, bold, and so on), font size, color, or
even apply effects. As with most text editors, a preview window is available
so you can view considered changes in real time before committing.
You can do more than play around with the title’s font. You can also choose
the correct alignment, border, and shading you’d like on your report title:
 Alignment: The Alignment tab lets you do things, such as centering or
left-justifying your report title, or even determining how it should appear
in the title box — perhaps you want your vertical alignment centered, or
at the top? Other interesting features include word wrap, which wraps
your title onto a second line if necessary, and a feature that allows you
to display the report title on every page of your report.
 Border: The Border tab, as you might imagine, lets you set properties
for the border of the title box. Perhaps you’d like the border to be
slightly more pronounced or in magenta; in that case, you can do that
here in several mouse clicks.
Figure 11-9:
The Cell
Format
dialog box.
151
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects

If you find a border unnecessary for your report, you can remove it here
by clicking on the offending border, much like you do in Microsoft Office
applications.
Shading: The Shading tab lets you apply any shading or fills to your title
box. If you want to add a gradient, so your title box has a slight blue tint
to it, you can use the Shading and Background Color areas of this tab to
do just that.
Don’t get too carried away with shading; applying a colored background can
often get in the way of your text. As nice as a colorful report may be, make
sure it doesn’t hinder the message of your report, which is best conveyed by
its content.
When you’re done customizing your report title, click OK to return to 
your report.
Applying standard styles
In Chapter 9, we discuss how to create standard report formatting styles in
the BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence Options page. This is where you
can finally put that hard work to good use.
Imagine you spruced up your report title and then heard from the boss that
you need to keep it simple and use the defined corporate style. If you worked
with the Options page to create a standard style that would be applied
throughout the document, you can quickly revert to that standard.
Right-click the title box, and select the Apply Standard Style option to revert
to the standard. Your title once again has the predefined style.
Working with variables
You can also work with the title box through the use of variables; while the
actual report title is a constant — its name or value doesn’t change unless you
change it — you can still edit it through the Variables page.
To do so, right-click the title box and choose Variables. Under the Constants
menu, you can see the name of your report. If you click Edit, you can modify
the formula (your report title) and then click OK and then Replace.
Setting the table
The report table is the meat and potatoes of the report. This is the physical
representation of the portion of data selected from your data source. This
table displays the information that you requested in the Query Panel; in
other word, it’s a cross section of your data source.
152
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

Data is presented in a simple table, as shown in Figure 11-10. There are many
ways to work with the data presented in your document; however, if you’re
using BusinessObjects at work, it’s more likely that you’d work with docu-
ments using Web Intelligence instead of Desktop Intelligence. Nevertheless,
it’s still a good idea to know how to work with your report’s tables.
So, what exactly can you do? There are the basics, such a formatting your
table, or performing a calculation. There are also the more advanced tasks:
flipping, charting, and drilling down the data.
Flipping your data
You can change how your columns appear, specifically their direction. For
example, take a look at how the table appears in Figure 11-10. If you click the
top of the header of a column, a black arrow appears, as in Figure 11-11. The
column appears with a black background, which indicates that the entire
column is selected. Right-click the column and select Rotate Table. Your table
changes and appears as shown in Figure 11-12. You can flip the table by
selecting a cell inside the table.

The black
arrow
means

selected the
column.
Figure 11-10:

153
Chapter 11: Documents in BusinessObjects

Charting your data
Perhaps displaying a table isn’t that hot of an idea; maybe you need some-
thing that gives a better indication of your data. If you have a measure in the
Y-axis and a variable in your X-axis (which you can set in the Query Panel),
you can magically change your table to a chart.
Simply click anywhere in your table and then right-click a cell. Select Turn to
Chart and the table appears as a chart, provided your table has a variable on
the X-axis and a measure on the Y-axis, which you can set back in Desktop
Intelligence. If you don’t have the right information in your axes, a warning
box appears, as shown in Figure 11-13.
Drilling your data
Perhaps you want to take a closer look at your data; in that case, you can use
the Drill feature, which lets you dig deep and examine individual bits of data.
The following steps show you how to get an up-close-and-personal look at
your database data:
1. Click the cell containing the data that you wish to drill and then click
the Drill icon or choose Analysis➪Drill.
A new report is created, which is in drill mode.
2. Right-click a cell in your table and select Scope of Analysis or choose
Analysis➪Scope of Analysis.
The Scope of Analysis lets you set the range of your drill down; in other
words, you can set the boundaries for your drill by selecting which
dimensions to include, as shown in Figure 11-14.

warning for

require-
ments.

154
Part III: Using Your Desktop for Reporting 

3. Right-click anywhere within the table and select Drill Through.
4. Select an object, such as year, and then click OK. 
This indicates on which object to drill and return precise, individual
data. The drilled data is displayed, as shown in Figure 11-15.
You can always move up or down a level by right-clicking inside the table and
selecting Drill Up or Drill Down.
If you mouse over your table, a magnifying glass cursor appears if you’re able
to drill down. Double-click the cell to drill down (or use the contextual
menu). If a text label appears and tells you to right-click, it’s telling you that
you can’t drill down any farther.

Making Web
Intelligence 
Work for You

In this part. . .
S
ometimes a full-client application isn’t always the
most convenient way of going about things; fortu-
nately, BusinessObjects lets you handle most everything
Desktop Intelligence does using Web Intelligence (WebI).
WebI lets you perform query and reporting tasks using a
browser-based interface. This is perfect if you’re a road
warrior who travels with a laptop that might not be pow-
erful enough to fully run BusinessObjects locally. Simply
connect to your Virtual Private Network and fire up your
Web browser. Before you know it you’ll be admiring
Kansas City’s Q3 results.
Chapter 12 shows you how to work with InfoView and make
it your own by customizing it. You also discover how to
perform queries and create reports (Chapter 13). If you
need to share your reports with colleagues to prep for an
upcoming meeting, you can even find out how to export or
send reports to others in your BusinessObjects environ-
ment and beyond (Chapter 14).

Chapter 12
Getting Your Hands Dirty 
with InfoView
In This Chapter
 Logging on to InfoView
 Customizing your InfoView
 Using My InfoView
I
n this chapter, you get started with what is basically the rock star of
BusinessObjects: InfoView! InfoView is the Web-based application that
allows you to do what BusinessObjects Desktop Intelligence does and then
some! For example, you can perform queries, create and update documents,
and save them to a repository, just as you can with Desktop Intelligence. 
But you can also do more — such as schedule reports to be refreshed or
choose formats for displaying your documents.
If you’re using BusinessObjects at your place of business, it’s very likely 
that you’re using InfoView to handle your reporting needs. Even though
Desktop Intelligence is a very capable product, InfoView has some distinct
advantages. For example, using InfoView means that
 Everyone on your network can access InfoView, no matter where they
are (assuming they can access the network).
 Your system administrator doesn’t have to install BusinessObjects 
software on every network computer.
 You can work with the familiar Internet Explorer browser, instead of
having to familiarize yourself with the look and feel of a new piece of
software.

BusinessObjects officially supports only specific versions of Internet Explorer
(versions 5 through 7). However, it is likely that you can use other commonly
used browsers, such as Firefox, with few difficulties in InfoView. There 
may be rendering issues using other browsers, but you should be able to 
get what you need done. However, Firefox doesn’t work with Performance
Management due to compatibility issues with SVG.
Before you can start creating documents, you need to feel comfortable find-
ing your way around InfoView, accessing it, and customizing its look and feel.
After you discover the basics of using InfoView and WebI (short for Web
Intelligence) as it is affectionately referred to by BusinessObjects users, 
you’ll find that querying and reporting can be fun! Before we get ahead of 
ourselves, this chapter simply focuses on getting your feet wet with InfoView.
If you’re looking to make a quantum leap and jump right in with query and
reporting, flip ahead to Chapter 13.
InfoView and WebI aren’t interchangeable terms to throw around lightly!
InfoView is a business intelligence portal that allows you to manage various
kinds of documents (DeskI documents, WebI documents, Crystal reports, and
so on) and perform tasks, such as scheduling and publishing. WebI is a report
engine and is the equivalent of a Web-based DeskI.
Logging On to InfoView
As you can imagine, logging on to InfoView is the first step you’ll take to 
getting started. Before you can log on to InfoView, make sure that
 You’re connected to your network, either directly or via VPN.
A virtual private network (VPN) is a networking system that uses 
encryption to create a secure path through the Internet so you can log
on to your network remotely. It’s used primarily for corporate networks
rather than home networks. 
 You have the URL, or Web address, of your InfoView installation. If
you don’t know the URL, contact your system administrator.
When you have these two issues squared away, you’re ready to get started!
Follow these steps to log on to InfoView:
160
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

1. Open your Web browser.
We recommend using Internet Explorer or Firefox. If you’re using a differ-
ent Web browser, visit the Business Objects Web site and make sure that
your browser is compatible with this release.
2. Enter the URL, or Web address, for InfoView.
If you don’t know the URL, contact your system administrator. Usually, it
will look similar to this: 
http://servername:8080/businessobjects/enterprise115
The InfoView logon page appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
3. Enter your user name and password in the text boxes.
Do not modify the System or Authentication fields unless instructed to
do so by your system administrator. If you modify these settings without
system administrator approval, you most likely won’t be able to access
InfoView. If you are used to desktop products, use the same user name
and password.
4. Click Log On.
When your logon is validated, the InfoView Home page appears, as
shown in Figure 12-2. 
In the next section, we show you how to change which page is displayed
at logon.

Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

Customizing InfoView
The first time you log on to InfoView, you see its bare-bones default configu-
ration. This may be perfectly fine for many users, but you can liven things up!
For example, you can change the opening page to display a preferred report
instead of the default Home page. 
You do all InfoView customizing through the Preferences page. You can
access Preferences in two ways:
 Click the Personalize InfoView Now link on the Home page (refer to
Figure 12-2).
 Click the Preferences icon (located on the right side of the InfoView 
toolbar), as shown in Figure 12-3.
The Preferences page is composed of seven tabs; each tab represents a 
different aspect of InfoView.

In the My Initial View section, you can tell InfoView which page to open when
you launch the application:
 Home: By default, InfoView opens the Home page. 
 My InfoView: This view (discussed later in this chapter) reflects your
preferences. If you decide to display InfoView with multiple columns 
displaying specific documents, this button displays the defined layout.
 Favorites: This opens the Favorites folder, which is a list of any docu-
ments that have been saved as favorites, much like a bookmark in your
Web browser.
 Inbox: This opens your Inbox, which contains any documents received
or stored in this location.
 Folder: Choose a folder from the folder hierarchy displayed in the
Folders panel, on the left side of the screen. These are the folders in
which you store your documents.
 Category: Choose either the Personal or Corporate category; when
saving a document, you can apply a category to the document.
The Default Navigation View Is section allows you to set how you want to
navigate InfoView; you can navigate by folder (a hierarchical format) or by
category. There is no particular advantage to either approach; use whichever
feels right to you.
The On My Desktop option lets you determine how many objects appear on 
a single page. By default, the maximum is set to 10. There isn’t a real reason
to change this setting unless you feel that you can comfortably fit additional
objects on your screen without rendering the page too busy to read.
Figure 12-4:
The 
General tab.
163
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

The For Each Document, Show Me option lets you determine what informa-
tion to display for a document listing. By default, all available options 
are selected. Unless you feel that your screen is too busy with all this 
information, we recommend leaving the selected options as is.
You can determine how you wish to view documents in InfoView using the
View My Documents option. For example, you can tell InfoView to display 
the document in the same browser window as InfoView. You can also choose
to display all documents one at a time in a separate browser window or to
display each document individually in multiple browser windows. By default,
this is set to display documents in the InfoView portal.
The General tab also lets you instruct InfoView on what to do when you close
the browser window using the When I Close My Browser Window option. You
can tell InfoView to automatically log you off of InfoView, to never log you 
off of InfoView, or to ask if you want to log off. For security reasons, we sug-
gest that you tell InfoView to either log you off or to ask you about logging 
off when shutting your browser window. This, coincidentally, is also the
default setting.
Failure to log off could result in other users accessing your InfoView session.
It is imperative that you opt to log off of InfoView (and not to ask your 
permission) when closing your browser window if you are using a computer
where others may have access or if you are using a public computer.
The My Interface Locale option lets you set the browser locale — you specify
the country you’re in. The selected locale determines which formatting rules
(such as number and date/time settings) to apply to InfoView. The locale also
determines the language of the application; you can display menus in English,
French, Spanish, and so on.
The My Current Time-Zone Is drop-down list lets you select any time zone in
the world or opt to use the time zone settings of your BusinessObjects
server. You should set this option before you schedule anything because the
default time zone depends on the server that is running the BusinessObjects
environment and not the time zone of your computer!
Be sure to click Apply before moving on to the next tab!
Desktop Intelligence
The Desktop Intelligence (DeskI) tab lets you choose the display format for
documents (by default, HTML is the selected display format). You may opt to
use PDF (assuming you have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed) or to open as a
Desktop Intelligence document in Desktop Intelligence if you’re using
Windows.
164
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

You must have DeskI stored locally on your machine to use the Desktop
Intelligence format.
We recommend using the PDF format if you only intend to view a report, 
print your document, or to save it locally to your computer. If you plan to
work with report prompts (queries that require you to enter a value) or 
to drill through data, then you must work in HTML.
Web Intelligence Document
The Web Intelligence (WebI) Document tab is similar in nature to the Desktop
Intelligence tab. This tab lets you determine how to display documents 
created using InfoView for viewing in InfoView. Unlike the previous tab, it 
lets you go far beyond display formats, as shown in Figure 12-5.
On this tab, you can select the desired display format, such as HTML or PDF,
from the Select a View Format section. You can use a third type of document
format, Interactive (which is similar to HTML), to work with prompts, 
perform sorts, and modify data formatting.
The Select a Report Panel section lets you select what kind of report panel to
use when building reports. InfoView lets you choose between the Query —
HTML panel and the Java Report Panel, which is the default option (shown in
Figure 12-6). The Java Report Panel lets you work with a more graphics-
oriented panel; you can also drag and drop objects into your query. The
HTML panel has the advantage of being HTML-based (which means no poten-
tial third-party application errors can affect performance) and has a wizard-
like interface, which is ideal for inexperienced users. (Our normal preference 
is to use the Java Report Panel, which has more reporting, formatting, and
querying options available than the HTML panel.)
Figure 12-5:
The Web
Intelligence
Document
tab.
165
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

In the For Each New Drill Session section, you can choose how you want 
to drill reports — directly in an open report or (if you feel more comfortable)
in a copy of the report in another window instead of drilling into your 
original report. 
If you’re worried about making changes to your document and not finding
your way back to the original, change the default option and work with a
report duplicate.
The For Each New Drill Session options appear just below the Select a 
Report Panel option. These options let you decide whether to be prompted 
if additional data is required. For example, when you’re drilling down a level,
InfoView may require you to run a new query. (Should that occur, and you
have selected this option, InfoView lets you know.) 
There are three General drill options: 
 Prompt if Drill Requires Additional Data: Displays a prompt if your
document requires extra info before carrying on. 
 Synchronize Drill on Report Blocks: If you drill down on a table, 
the table and chart for your data displays drilled values if this option 
is selected. If selected, your table continues to display drilled data 
values, but your chart won’t because it hasn’t been synchronized. 
 Hide Drill Toolbar: Lets you hide the drill toolbar.
Figure 12-6:
The Java
Report
Panel.
166
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

The Select MS Excel Format option lets you set priorities for Microsoft 
Excel. There are two choices in this section, though their titles are somewhat
ambiguous! Basically, you can display data as either an Excel spreadsheet 
or as a text file. Again, this is a question of personal preference, as well as
perhaps network performance. (We prefer working with reports as Excel
spreadsheets, though this is not the default option.)
The Select a Format Locale drop-down list lets you pick which country’s 
display formats to use. The default option, Use Interface Locale, is sufficient
for most users. This selection uses the country/language combination of 
your application and applies the display rules (for date, time, currency, 
numbers, and so on) for that locale. To apply a different standard, select
another locale from the drop-down list.
The When Viewing a Document option lets you select which locale to use
when formatting document data. The default option (Use the Document
Locale to Format the Data) lets you use the formatting locale to dictate the
formatting rules to apply. The other option (Use the Document Locale to
Format the Data) lets you apply the formatting rules that were applied 
to the document when it was created.
The Select Default Universe section lets you select a default BusinessObjects
universe to use when creating reports. By default, no universe is defined 
as the default. Click the Browse button and select an available universe, as
shown in Figure 12-7.
OLAP Intelligence
One of the great things about business intelligence is all the great terminol-
ogy you’ll encounter — OLAP, ROLAP, LDAP, and so on. In this particular
case, this tab helps you select a display format when working with OLAP.
Figure 12-7:
The list of
available
universes.
167
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

OLAP, otherwise known as Online Analytical Processing, quickly performs
dynamic multidimensional analysis of information in a relational database.
This tab has but a single option — View My Reports Using — and you can
choose one of two: the ActiveX or DHTML (default) viewer. Either option 
is fine; it comes down to a question of priorities. This DHTML viewer, shown
in Figure 12-8, uses a Web browser window and provides considerably more
options than ActiveX, while offering fewer security vulnerabilities than
ActiveX. On the other hand, ActiveX offers better performance than its 
Web-based counterpart.
Crystal Report
You use the Crystal Report tab (see Figure 12-9) when you’re viewing Crystal
Reports documents in InfoView. We cover the features of this tab, but stop
short of covering how to use Crystal Reports. For that information, we 
suggest Crystal Reports 2008 For Dummies by Allen Taylor (Wiley Publishing).
Figure 12-9:
The Crystal
Report tab.
Figure 12-8:
The DHTML

168
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

The View My Reports Using The section lets you choose your viewer 
of choice: 
 ActiveX: If you plan on using the ActiveX viewer, you must make sure
that your Web browser supports ActiveX controls. Your Web browser’s
options or preference pages allow you to set security settings, including
whether or not to allow the use of ActiveX in your Web pages.
 DHTML: The DHTML viewer lets you work with a browser-based window
for viewing and working with reports. This is the default choice.
 Advanced DHTML: The Advanced DHTML viewer has the same features
as the DHTML viewer, but also has an integrated search feature. Frankly,
if you’re leaning toward the DHTML viewer, we recommend using the
Advanced DHTML viewer instead.
 Java: Java is a viable option if your Web browser supports Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).
The “best” viewer is the one you’re most comfortable working with.
The DHTML Viewer Printing Uses The section lets you determine how to
print documents or reports if you’re using the DHTML Viewer. The default
option (ActiveX Printing Control) lets you print from a control (button). 
The other option (Acrobat Reader Printing Control) lets you print from the
Adobe Acrobat Reader (once the report is exported to PDF format). We 
prefer using Adobe Acrobat because we’re comfortable with it.
You only need to set the DHTML Viewer Printing Uses The and Rendering
Resolution (DHTML Viewers) sections if you plan to use one of the DHTML
viewers. Otherwise you can leave the default settings in place.
The Preferred Measuring Units for Report Page Layout section lets you
decide if you want to use a metric or Imperial unit of measurement. Whether
to use inches or millimeters is purely a question of comfort.
The Rendering Resolution (DHTML Viewers) section is solely for users 
working with the DHTML viewer (see — there’s a reason that it’s the default
viewer!): You can send page-rendering DPI, which means you must set the
print level for the DHTML viewer. If you’re comfortable reading a smaller font,
you can use 96 DPI; if you prefer a larger font, we recommend using 120 DPI.
Password
The Password tab is a rather straightforward tab that leaves little to the
imagination. This is where you can change the password that you use to 
log on to InfoView. 
169
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

Should you forget your password, you can contact your BusinessObjects
administrator who can help you reset your password. If you’re the
BusinessObjects administrator and you’ve forgotten your password, you’re 
in trouble.
To change your password, follow these steps:
1. Click the Passwords tab in InfoView Preferences.
2. Enter your old password.
3. Enter your new password.
4. Enter your new password again for confirmation.
5. Click Submit.
While changing your password is easy, picking a good password can be a
trying exercise. For security reasons, do not pick a password that others 
are likely to guess based on your personality or hobbies. At the same time, 
be practical — you’re likely to forget a password like %4@fsK8. Because 
writing down a password makes as much sense as being a Disney fan and
selecting MickeyMouse as a password, it’s better to find a compromise
between the two!
What’s it all about?
The final tab, About, provides copyright information and other legalese. 
It doesn’t offer much information that can help you with InfoView.
I Did It MyInfoView’s Way
If the Preferences page is where you customize your InfoView, then
MyInfoView is where you put it all together and show off. Okay, if you’re more
modest than that, MyInfoView lets you “build your own InfoView” and specify
not only the content but where it should appear.
The MyInfoView page lets you display frequently used elements, such as
InfoView folders and reports, or even Web sites in frames. You can pick the
layout of your frames that accommodates all the content you want to display.
The MyInfoView page is one of the potential Home pages you can define. 
You can customize your content and tell InfoView to load this page when you
170
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

open it so your customized content appears straightaway. We recommend
using MyInfoView to save you time and effort; instead of hunting around for
InfoView content, you can put it at your fingertips.
When you browse the MyInfoView page for the first time, it’s pretty barren, as
shown in Figure 12-10.
Click the Resize buttons at the top-right of the MyInfoView frame to maximize
viewing space.
Contemplating your template
Before you start worrying about content, think first about your MyInfoView
layout. It’s like building a house; first you establish your foundation. In this
case, the MyInfoView template is your foundation.
MyInfoView gives you six different template options. Follow these steps to set
up your template:
1. Log on to InfoView and click MyInfoView.
The MyInfoView page appears; at the top of the page (above the 
Define Content window) is a series of six templates that resemble
column layouts.
2. Click the desired template from the list of available templates.
You can hover your mouse pointer over the template to find out its
name.
A dialog box opens, warning you that you’re about to overwrite any
existing changes.
Figure 12-10:
MyInfoView.
171
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

3. Click OK in the dialog box.
4. Click Save back in MyInfoView.
Your template is saved to MyInfoView. If you log out of InfoView and
come back to MyInfoView, MyInfoView appears on-screen using the 
template you saved.
If you decide that you’re tired of the selected template, you can apply a 
new template by repeating these steps.
If you’ve already defined content and try to change templates, you lose any
existing frame content.
Defining content or being 
happy with MyInfoView
After you select the right template for MyInfoView, you can define the content
for each of the frames. Before doing so, however, familiarize yourself with the
five buttons found in your frame, as shown in Figure 12-11.
Split Vertically

Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

 Reopen in New Window: Opens the frame in a new browser window.
This is a useful button because once populated, you may find that you
don’t have enough room in the frame to actually view all of the content. 
 Split Vertically: Splits the existing frame vertically into two columns of
equal size.
 Split Horizontally: Splits the existing frame vertically into three
columns of equal size.
 Properties: Displays the Dashboard Properties window. We show you
how to change the properties in the upcoming steps.
 Close: Closes the relevant frame. The remaining frames are resized to
use the space vacated by the deleted frame. Note that this button only
appears once you’ve selected one of the other buttons first.
Follow these steps to define content for your MyInfoView frame:
1. Once you have put your template in place, click Define Content.
The Dashboard Properties window appears. 
You can also access the Dashboard Properties window by clicking the
Properties button.
2. Select either a Web Address or an Object to display in the frame. If
you opt to use a Web address, enter a valid URL. If you prefer an
Object, select a folder or a report to display.
3. (Optional) In the Header section, enter a header name.
If you entered an URL in Step 2, you can give it a name for easy reference
by entering it in the Caption field. If you choose an object in Step 2, the
name of the selected folder or file automatically appears in the Caption
field. For both Web addresses and objects, you can add an URL that
makes the header clickable. Also, be sure that the Header check box is
selected!
4. (Optional) In the Footer section, enter a footer name.
The Caption field is empty by default. You can enter a footer text in the
text area as well as an URL. (This section works exactly the same as the
Header section.)
5. Select which borders to apply in the Border section.
By default, all borders — top, bottom, left, and right — are selected, as
shown in Figure 12-12.
173
Chapter 12: Getting Your Hands Dirty with InfoView

6. Click OK.
The updated My InfoView page appears, as shown in Figure 12-13.
7. Save your changes by clicking Save.
If you want to display MyInfoView as your Home page, you can go to the
Preferences pages and change the Home page (see the section “Customizing
InfoView” earlier in this chapter). When you launch MyInfoView and decide
that it’s time to make changes to your page, you can click the Edit link 
(as shown in Figure 12-13) and repeat the steps.

I
f we’ve said it once, we’ve said it a million times: If you’re using
BusinessObjects, you may be almost destined to use WebI — for lots of
tasks, including report creation. 
It’s not hard to see why: Creating documents and reports in WebI is easy.
One reason is that WebI (and InfoView) nestles nicely into the framework of
your favorite Web browser. And here’s another: It has a very user-friendly
design that doesn’t overcrowd screen real estate.
This chapter extols the virtues of WebI. Exclusively. If you plan on using
Desktop Intelligence instead, see Chapter 9.
In this chapter, we show you how to create a new document. It’s all about
making choices. To create a document (for example), you must select one 
of your available universes — an important decision, because the universe
you pick contains the data you use as you create your reports. We also 
offer pointers on using prompts (fields that let you add a unique values for
particular objects) to build your document, so you can zero in on the precise
data you need. You can even use multivalue prompts, too, so you can add
several countries, for example!
Then we show you how to save your document and even print it for good
measure! There are many ways, as well as many places, for you to save your
documents.

Creating a Document
Using InfoView, you can create many different types of documents — 
including Desktop Intelligence documents, publications, WebI documents,
hyperlinks, analytic reports, and so on; you can even add a Microsoft 
Office document through InfoView. What you are allowed to create depends 
solely on the access given to your user account from the BusinessObjects
administrator. For example, you may be able to add a Microsoft Office 
document through WebI but are unable to create a WebI document.
In this section, we show you how to create a Web Intelligence document. 
For more information on creating a Crystal Report in InfoView, refer to Crystal
Reports 2008 For Dummies by Allen G. Taylor (published by Wiley).
The following steps walk you through the creation of a document in InfoView:
1. Choose New➪Web Intelligence Document from the InfoView toolbar.
The list of available universes appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
2. Select the name of the desired universe.
Web Intelligence launches and the report panel appears; what it looks
like depends on the type of panel you selected in InfoView Preferences.
(For these steps, we selected Java Report Panel.)
You can change your report panel by clicking the Preferences icon on
the InfoView toolbar and selecting the Web Intelligence Documents tab.
3. On the data tab, expand the menus; then drag and drop the desired
objects into the Results Objects pane (shown in Figure 13-2).
Figure 13-1:
The list of
available
universes.
176
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

4. (Optional) If you’re finished, click Run Query to display your report
on-screen, or you can add filters in Step 5.
5. Add filters (represented by a gold filter icon) by dragging and 
dropping them into the Query Filters pane.
Alternatively, you can add an object and make it a customized filter. 
6. Click Run Query.
WebI generates a report based on the selected objects and filters you
applied in the Query Panel. Either the report appears or a prompt
appears, as shown in Figure 13-3. (A later section, “Using Prompts,”
explains how to fill in prompts.)
Figure 13-3:

177
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

Creating Other Types of Files
In the previous section, we showed you how to create a Web Intelligence doc-
ument. In this section, we show you how to create other things in InfoView.
Log in to InfoView and click the New button on the toolbar to reveal the
extensive list of document types:
 Desktop Intelligence: Just in case you missed Desktop Intelligence,
selecting this option launches it so you can create a report using your
desktop-based application.
 Publication: This option creates a new instance (including a title, 
keyword, and category) that then appears in the selected folder.
 Web Intelligence Document: You can use this option to create a new
report in InfoView through the Query Panel. We discuss the Query 
Panel in Chapter 10.
 Hyperlink: This option stores a link to a frequently visited site in your
BusinessObjects environment. Simply provide title, description, key-
word(s), location, and (oh yes) a valid URL.
 Analytic: Creates a dashboard that graphically represents system 
metrics, using the Performance Manager Analytics Tools (an application
that is part of BusinessObjects Enterprise since BusinessObjects XI R2).
 OLAP Intelligence Report: Creates a new OLAP (Online Analytical
Processing) Intelligence Report.
 OLAP Intelligence Connection: Sets up a new OLAP connection; an
OLAP connection is required if you want to create a new OLAP
Intelligence Report.
 Single Dashboard: Creates a single dashboard, or framework, much like
that you can set up in the My InfoView page.
 Crystal Report: Creates a Crystal Report.
 Report Data Source: Sets up the data-source connection for your
Crystal Report.
 Document from local computer: This neat little option lets you add
third-party documents to your BusinessObjects environment. For exam-
ple, you can add a Microsoft Office document (Word, Excel, PowerPoint),
or even Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and text files, as shown in Figure 13-4.
 Folder: If you have the right permissions, you can use this option to
create a new folder in your BusinessObjects environment.
178
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

Using Prompts
Prompts are interactive conditions that are useful when you want to change
your conditions at refresh time. Otherwise, you can use static conditions if
such interactivity is not necessary. For example, if you’re the manager of the
Chicago outlet, you can set Chicago as a static condition and products
as a prompt. By doing that, you can choose different products for your outlet
every time you refresh your document.
Prompts give you an interactive role in document creation; they give you on-
screen places to enter specific values that affect the data you want returned.
In effect, prompts are conditions you can impose that define the environ-
ment, other conditions, or whatever else is required to produce the 
desired data.
The three report panels (Query HTML, Java, and HTML) all work much the
same. If you’re new to filters and prompts, we recommend using the Query
HTML report panel, which has a particularly easy interface. In this section,
we use the Query HTML report panel, which you can select by choosing
Preferences➪Web Intelligence Document. 
The following steps show how to set up a prompt:
1. Log in to InfoView, and choose New➪Web Intelligence Document.
WebIntelligence launches and the Query HTML panel appears (if it 
doesn’t, change it in InfoView’s Preferences).
2. Select a universe.
In this example, select the eFashion universe.
3. Expand the Time period menu; drag the objects you want into the
Result Objects window.
We selected three objects: Year Quarter, and Week now appear in the
Result Object window.
4. Expand the Store menu and drag the objects you want into the Result
Objects window.
We selected two objects: City and State. These two objects now appear
in the window, next to the Time Period objects, as shown in Figure 13-5.
Figure 13-4:
Add a file
from your
computer.
179
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

You can remove an object at any time prior to running the query by
dragging it out of the Result Objects or Query Filters windows. You can
also select the object and press the Delete key.
5. Under the Time period menu, drag the filters you want into the Query
Filters window.
Your selection appears in the window (we selected the Year filter).
If you use a predefined filter, you don’t have to set any additional 
parameters. Predefined filters are already specific about the detailed
information they filter from the data and provide in your report.
6. Expand the Product menu, and drag and drop the objects you want to
the Query Filters window.
Your selection appears in the Query Filters window (we selected the
Category object, shown in Figure 13-6).
Notice that in this step, you bring an object — not a filter — into the
Query Filters window. Because the object isn’t already a filter, you have
to adjust it a bit to get it in shape for use. Figure 13-6 shows how the
Query Panel changes appearance to accommodate an object used 
as a filter.
7. Decide whether you want to create a filter or a prompt, using the
Filter or Prompt radio buttons.
A filter grabs specific values as data passes through it. A prompt does
the same thing, except you can enter a value to specify what’s grabbed. 
If you decided to use Java Report Panel instead of the Query — HTML
Panel, the Prompt radio button doesn’t appear. You must add the object
as a filter and select Prompt from the drop down list on the right side of
the object. 
Figure 13-5:
The Query
Panel with
objects.
180
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

8. Select an operator from the Select an Operator drop-down list.
The operator list contains a list of 16 operators, such as the equals (=)
or greater-than (>) signs. These operators help you create the 
conditions for the values that your report’s users will enter.
9. In the Prompt Text 1 text box, enter a question for your prompt.
A default text is provided, but you can replace it with more descrip-
tive text in the form of a question. We suggest putting a different 
prompt name.
10. Click the Properties button.
The Properties window appears (as shown in Figure 13-7), where you
can specify additional settings. 
Figure 13-7:
The
Properties
window.
Figure 13-6:
The object

181
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

11. Leave the default settings in place for now; if you wish to provide a
default value for your prompt, enable the Set Default Value(s) option.
Click OK to go back to the Query Panel.
The default settings provide users with a list of values from which to
choose a prompt value; the value last used remains if the report’s users
decide to keep it unchanged.
If you enable the Select Default Value(s) option, you can type a default
value (or click Values to select a value from a list).
12. Click Update Filter.
The prompt is now established for your report. When you generate your
document, or refresh your data, the document asks you to submit a
value for the filter.
Save a Document, Save a Life
After you’ve created a document, you’ll probably want to save it for future
use. BusinessObjects provides you with a number of options for saving your
reports. Fortunately, the software doesn’t assume that everyone who needs
access to your report has access to BusinessObjects to be able to read it.
First you have to decide where this document is going to be needed. You
have two general options:
 If your document is a personal document created for your own use, save
it somewhere in My Folders.
 If your document is a corporate document that you want to make avail-
able to several groups or users, store it somewhere in Public Folders.
You may also want to save your document to your computer, in one of vari-
ous formats that don’t require BusinessObjects, such in Adobe PDF format,
text (CSV), or Microsoft Excel. This is particularly helpful if you’ve created a
document that may contain one to many reports.
Another concern is how to categorize your document. BusinessObjects lets
you create various categories, brief descriptions or keywords that you can
apply to your document for easy access. 
Saving your document
The following steps show how to save your document as a personal or 
corporate document:
1. Click the Save icon on the document’s toolbar.
182
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

The Save Document window appears.
2. Enter a document name for the title, a description, and any appropri-
ate keywords.
3. Select whether to refresh the data when the document is opened.
We recommend selecting this option. 
We don’t recommend checking the Permanent Regional Formatting
check box in case users are in multiple countries.
4. Select a folder location for your document.
Use My Folders for a personal document; use Public Folders if you’re
creating corporate documents.
5. Select a category for your document.
Depending on the nature of the document, you can expand either the
Personal or Corporate categories and then select an existing category,
as shown in Figure 13-8.
6. Click OK.
Your document appears in the location to which you saved it, as shown in
Figure 13-9.

Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

If you save a document to your desktop, you haven’t yet saved it to your
repository (see the upcoming section, “Making Saved As documents avail-
able”). Be sure to do a standard save if you want to store the document in
either My Folders or Public Folders.
Adding new categories
It’s likely that your initial categories were set up by your BusinessObjects
administrator or perhaps another colleague. As your repository (the place
where your documents are stored) grows over time, you’ll probably have to
add more categories to your repertoire.
To add new categories, follow these steps:
1. In InfoView, go to the Folders panel and click the Categories icon.
The Categories panel appears, as shown in Figure 13-10.
2. Select an existing category type (Personal or Corporate), and in the
toolbar, choose New➪Categories.
You can’t create a new category if you haven’t already selected a 
category.
The Create a New Category window appears, as shown in Figure 13-11.
3. Add a category name, a description, and any relevant keywords.
Be sure to provide as much information and detail as possible so other
users know when to use this category.
Figure 13-10:
The
Categories
panel. 
184
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

4. Click OK.
The new category appears in the Categories panel, as shown in 
Figure 13-12.
Saving documents in other formats
You don’t necessarily have to save your document as a Web Intelligence 
document. You can also save the document in a third-party format so other
people can access it.
InfoView lets you save the document in any of four formats: Microsoft Excel,
PDF, CSV, and CSV (with options).
If you opt to save your document as a Microsoft Excel, PDF file, or a CSV
(text) file, InfoView converts your document on the spot and displays a Save
As dialog box. All that’s left for you to do is to save the document as you
would any other file in Windows. 
Figure 13-12:
The new
category
appears.
Figure 13-11:
The Create
a New
Category
window. 
185
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

If you opt to save the document using the CSV (with options) format, there 
is one slight change. The Save as CSV–Options dialog box appears (as shown
in Figure 13-13); there you can configure your formatting settings. You can 
set text qualifiers, column delimiters, character sets, or add a new character
set. If you’re satisfied with the settings, you can designate them as your new
default values. After you’ve made your changes and clicked OK, the standard
Save As dialog box appears.
Data displayed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet isn’t the same content as 
displayed in an Adobe PDF file or a CSV file. In Microsoft Excel and Adobe
PDF format, you have the full WebI document with charts, multiple docu-
ments, formula results from document filters, and so on. In CSV format, the
database query results appear and data comes directly from the database
without any document formatting, filtering, or any reporting features.
If you opt to use any of these formats, other users can’t modify the document
content. Any changes made are reflected only in the file modified; if the docu-
ment has also been saved to the repository, any changes aren’t saved there. 
Which format option you choose depends on your personal preferences and
document compatibility. If you plan to use the Microsoft Excel or PDF formats
(for example), anyone viewing the document has to use Microsoft Office or
Acrobat Reader to view the files.
Making Saved As documents available
Say you’ve created a document for someone in Microsoft Excel format; your
colleague liked it so much that she wants you to put it in the repository,
specifically in the Corporate folders.
Figure 13-13:
The CSV
(with
options)
dialog box.
186
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

If you’ve saved the file to your desktop, you can save it to the repository by
choosing New➪Document from Local Computer➪Microsoft Excel from the
InfoView toolbar.
A Find File dialog box appears; select your file and then supply the other
pieces of information requested, such as a title, description, keywords, and
location. After you select your file, the rest of the process is the same as
saving a document for the first time. When you’ve done that, the Microsoft
Excel file appears in the desired location, as shown in Figure 13-14.
Printing Your Document
Printing your document in InfoView can be a lesson learned the hard way if
you’re not careful. An open document in InfoView isn’t necessarily the easiest
way to print your document; we’ll show you how to make this process go a
little more smoothly.
If you’re looking to print a document that was created in one of the other for-
mats, you can simply open the file and print it in the usual way. If you want to
print a document in InfoView, things are done a little differently.
Plain and simple, if you want your document to print properly, it must first 
be in PDF mode. If your document is in HTML, you must change the view. 
If you try to print your document in HTML format, it doesn’t print properly.
Figure 13-14:
The Excel
file in its
new home. 
187
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Documents

The following steps show you how to print your document as a PDF 
document:
1. If your document in InfoView appears in HTML format, choose
View➪PDF mode in the document toolbar.
The document appears in PDF format.
2. Click the Adobe print icon located in the Adobe toolbar within the
document, as shown in Figure 13-15.
A Print dialog box appears. 
You can also save your document to your hard drive using the Save
button in the Adobe toolbar.
3. Choose the printer you want to print to, specify how many copies 
you want, and click Print.
Your document prints as a PDF document.
You really don’t want to print your document any other way. If you attempt 
to print as HTML, the rendering almost certainly won’t be to your liking 
and it can be near impossible to decipher. Printing your document as a PDF
guarantees readability.

Chapter 14
Working with Your Completed
Documents
In This Chapter
 Accessing saved documents
 Viewing documents
 Sending documents
 Exporting documents
U
p to this point, most of this book has been about reports and docu-
ments. We’ve covered how to create them, how to maximize your data
to find what you’re looking for, we’ve even looked at mundane tasks like
saving and printing your documents. 
What we’ve not covered concerning documents — until now — is how to
communicate with your documents. 
Not every InfoView user is responsible for creating reports and documents —
but every InfoView user is a pretty sure bet to access reports and documents
and eventually share them with colleagues.
One of the most important aspects of business intelligence is the capability
to share or broadcast data. InfoView gets you to the heart of this capability
through a very user-friendly, Web-based environment. This chapter discusses
what to do with your documents after you’ve created them — you didn’t
think you were finished, did you? 
Accessing Saved Documents
Reporting in BusinessObjects is a two-way street. As much as you might
enjoy using the Query Panel and create informative reports and documents
in minutes, sometimes you’re going to have to share the fun with your 
colleagues — and then make use of their documents.

Fortunately, you’re never more than a few mouse clicks away from accessing
documents in InfoView. Your documents are almost always in one of two
places: My Folders and Public Folders, which are shown in Figure 14-1. 
Logically speaking, you can access documents created and saved by others
using the Public Folders. The My Folders folder contains documents that you
have explicitly saved to this folder, be they your own documents or others’
documents, in either the Inbox or Favorites.
Finding a saved document
If you’ve been using BusinessObjects long enough, you may have so many
documents at your disposal that finding what you’re looking for is a real 
challenge. Like most applications, InfoView has a search feature to quickly
find the document(s) that you’re looking for.
The Search Title box is built right in to the InfoView toolbar, as shown in
Figure 14-2. Type either the entire report title or part of the document title
you’re looking for in the text box and then click the search icon.
Even though you can enter partial titles in the Search Title box, you cannot
use wildcards. For example, if you want to find a document with the word
“Analytic” in the title, you can use “Analytic”, “aly”, and so on; however, if you
type “Ana*” or “Analy*.*”, your search yields no results.

title feature.

190
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

If you enter a document title or letter combination that matches a document
that is in either My Folders or Public Folders, it appears as shown in Figure
14-3. From here, you can perform a number of important tasks using the 
document, such as open, send, or print the report.
Going straight to the man
Perhaps you’ve grown overly accustomed to all the documents that are 
available in your BusinessObjects environment. In that case, you can go
straight to the saved document that you seek. The ease with which you 
find the desired document depends largely on how well your colleagues or
administrator have maintained a tidy set of folders.
If care has been taken to maintain appropriately labeled folders or perform
regular maintenance or spring cleaning, you should be able to find a specific
document relatively quickly.
As we discussed in Chapter 13, you can create or designate which folders 
to use when saving documents. To access these documents, expand the
Public Folders hierarchy in the Folder pane. When you find the appropriate
subfolder, expand it so that the list of documents for that subfolder appears
in the main InfoView window.
The contents of Public Folders vary by BusinessObjects environment
because its content layout is entirely up to you or your organization. 
Figure 14-3:
The Search
title results. 
191
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

Getting the Lowdown on Your Document
Whether you know it or not, the page that appears when you open a sub-
folder in either My Folders or Public Folders, or when you perform a title
search, is extremely important. Sure, this page may look a little bare, but it
actually lets you find some very important information about your document
and lets you perform some equally important tasks.
The folder display, as shown in Figure 14-4, shows basic information, such 
as the type of document in the folder (is it a Webi document? A Crystal
Report?), the document title, owner, number of instances, as well as the last
time the report was run.
What’s more important is the set of links located below the document title. If
these links aren’t displayed, click the downward arrow located between the
document type icon and the document title. The arrow now appears upward
and four links appear for the document: History, Schedule, Modify, and
Properties.
Knowing your history
If you click the History link, a History page appears featuring a number of
buttons and options. The History page displays any historical instances 
and provides information about such events — for example, the time the
instance occurred, the instance title, who ran the instance, its status, and 
any reschedule information.
If you’re just starting out with InfoView, it’s highly likely that you won’t have
any historical instances. If this is the case, InfoView definitely calls this to
your attention, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Figure 14-4:

Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

I’ll put it on my calendar
The previous section mentions features that only occur when you schedule
an instance. The options available to you on the Schedule page vary, depend-
ing on the type of document you’re working with in InfoView. If it’s a Web
Intelligence document, the Schedule page looks like the one shown in 
Figure 14-6.
The following steps show you how to set up and schedule an instance in
InfoView:
1. Click Schedule from the list of documents.
The Schedule page opens.

Schedule
page for 
a Web
Intelligence
document.
Figure 14-5:

193
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

2. Enter a title in the Instance Title text box.
Be sure to give the instance a name that clearly represents it so you
don’t have to guess later on.
3. Expand the When menu and select when to run the document.
This drop-down list features a pretty extensive range of time options.
Pick the one that suits your needs; this is when the document will be re-
generated or run.
4. Expand the Destination menu and select the destination location.
Three options are available in the drop-down menu; for each option,
additional settings appear. 
We recommend using the default settings — that is, the Job Server set-
tings — if you’re using either the Inbox or Email Recipients fields (shown
in Figure 14-7). That way you don’t have to type details that you might
not know. See the section, “Sending Documents to Colleagues” for more
information.
5. Expand Format and select a format to generate.
If you’re creating a Web Intelligence document, you can save the
instance as a Web Intelligence document, a Microsoft Excel worksheet,
or a PDF.
6. Expand Caching Options and select the appropriate option.
This option lets you decide which document formats to cache, or store
(Microsoft Excel, Standard HTML, and Adobe Acrobat). You can also
cache formatting locales that will be used during scheduling; locate the
desired language and use the arrows to select the locale.
You can use the Locale feature to select a language spoken in a specific
country. For example, if you’re looking for a French locale, keep in mind
that the language has separate entries for France, Canada, Switzerland,
and so on.
Figure 14-7:
The E-mail
Recipients
field.
194
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

7. Expand Server Group and select which server to use for generating
the instance.
We recommend using the default setting, which uses the first available
server.
8. Expand Events and select any available events.
You can use the arrows to switch events between windows.
9. Expand Prompts and click Modify Values.
The Query Panel appears (as shown in Figure 14-8); there you can
modify the values of your prompts. Make your changes and then click
Apply. The selected values are used when the document is refreshed 
(a mandatory step) before being sent to its destination.
10. Click Schedule.
The scheduled instance appears in the History window, as shown in
Figure 14-9.
At the top of the window, two checkboxes are designed to do two specific
functions: 
 Show Only Instances Owned By Me: Check this box to display only the
instances owned by you.
 Filter Instances By Time: Check this box to filter instances that
occurred during a specific time frame. If checked, you can set the spe-
cific time period using the drop-down menus and set the specific date(s)
using the pop-up calendar located next to the text boxes. When you’re
finished, click Apply Filter to set it in motion.
Figure 14-8:
Modifying
prompts
during
scheduling.
195
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

Below the checkboxes, and above the column headers for the list of inci-
dents, is a toolbar with these handy capabilities:
 Pause and Resume: If you have an instance that is scheduled, you can
pause or resume it.
A scheduled instance must have a Pending or Recurring status or these
two buttons don’t work.
 Delete: You can delete an instance regardless of status by clicking the
checkbox next to it and then clicking Delete. 
 Show All Instances: Decide whether to show all instances (regardless of
status) or to only display completed instances.
 Refresh: Refresh your list of historical instances.
Viewing the properties
If you ever need to find information related to your document, document, or
application, the Properties window provides that information. In your Inbox
(or any other folder, for that matter), you can do so by clicking Properties.
The Properties window (shown in Figure 14-10) displays basic-but-important
information about your file.
You can view, but not modify, the following information:
 Title: The title you’ve chosen for the instance.
 Description: Any descriptive text that may have been added when
saving the document.
 Keywords: Any keywords that may have been added when saving the
document; these are helpful for searching for the document.
Figure 14-9:
The
scheduled
instance.
196
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

 Created: The date the instance was first created. 
 Last Modified: The date the instance was last updated and saved.
 Last Run On: The date the instance was last generated.
 Locale: The formatting language and country applied to the instance.
 Categories: Whether the document is saved under the Personal or
Corporate categories.
Making changes
The final option available to you for your document is the Modify feature.
This feature lets you modify your document. To get started, click Modify for
your document in your folder.
The default Report Panel appears and lets you modify the document in much
the same way you would have created it. (For more about how to use the
Report Panels, go to Chapter 13.)
Viewing Documents
There’s actually more to viewing documents than you may think. While it’s
true that being able to consult documents is a primary use of InfoView, 
you can do that in multiple ways — viewing, exporting, or sending your 
documents along to colleagues.
Figure 14-10:
The
Properties
window.
197
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

You can define how you view documents with InfoView Preferences, as 
discussed in Chapter 12.
Follow these steps to pick your document and view it (in several ways):
1. Go to your Inbox or whatever folder your document is located.
The list of available documents appears.
2. Click the document title.
The document appears according to your default settings, as shown in
Figure 14-11.
cal menu under the document title in the navigation map.
At this point, you can do a number of things with the document, depending
on your needs. As shown in Figure 14-11, a toolbar just above the document
provides options you can use to make full use of your document.
Your documents, please
You can use the first option — Close — on the Document menu to close 
the document. You can also (more importantly) edit your document. 
Choose Document➪Edit and the Java applet viewer opens the already open
document, where you can add objects to it via drag-and-drop, as shown in
Figure 14-12.
Figure 14-11:
An InfoView
document.
198
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

You have two ways to edit your document: Either click Edit Report or click
Edit Query from the Report window (so you can modify your document
query in the Query Panel). You can modify a single document query; the
query can belong to all documents in a Web Intelligence document.
Back in the HTML viewer, the Documents menu also has three distinct
options for saving your document: 
 Save: This option saves the document, using its initial save settings, to
the location where it was initially saved.
 Save As: This option changes where to save the document. You can also
modify the title, applicable keywords, and the description. 
 Save to My Computer As: This option saves the document to your docu-
ment in various formats (explained in greater detail in Chapter 13).
A document with a view
The View menu provides three different modes (ways of viewing your 
document), as well as two additional display options.
The three modes are
 Page: The Page mode is ideal if you want to adjust your document’s
appearance and formatting. For example, if you decide you want to
include charts or specify table colors, this is the ideal view to use.
Figure 14-12:
Adding 
an object 
to your
document.
199
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

 Draft: This mode doesn’t look very different from the Page mode — 
but this is the view you work in if you’re getting your hands dirty with
your data. For example, if you want to add formulas or sort the data 
in a table, this is the mode for the job.
 PDF: Using the PDF mode displays your document in the main window
as a PDF document. When you finish modifying your PDF or decide to
view it in HTML, click View in HTML format.
The advantage of using PDF mode is that you can save locally and print
to any printer (local or network) with minimal hassle — exactly as you
would in Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Reader.
You can use the remaining two options in the View menu to toggle between
displaying the Left Panel (at the left of your document, where you can modify
prompts or other aspects of your document) and the Status Bar (located
beneath your document). Both are selected by default. We recommend leav-
ing them selected unless you have compelling reasons to disable them.
The other, lesser menus
The toolbar has a number of other buttons you can choose. Most of these
work just like Microsoft Office features. 
Here’s a rundown of what they do:
 Save: This Save button works just like the Save option on the Document
menu.
 Find: The Find button works like any other Find feature; it works in your
current document. You can match cases, or search for whole words
based on your text.
 Undo/redo: You can undo or redo your latest task(s) for up to two
actions.
 Zoom: Increase or decrease the magnification of the document. 
 Next/Previous Page: The next buttons let you move forward or back a
page (assuming your document has multiple pages). If you have more
than one page, you can also enter the page number of the document.
 Refresh Data: Refresh your document with your default settings. This
button automatically refreshes the data in your data source; you don’t
even have to refresh your prompts. If you are using multiple data
providers, you can either refresh all data providers or just one.
 Drill: You can drill down or zoom in to take a closer look at the details 
of your data, as shown in Figure 14-13.
200
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

Sending Documents to Colleagues
As we’ve mentioned on several occasions throughout this book, InfoView lets
you send your documents over e-mail. This feature is particularly helpful if
you have to send a document to someone outside the office (for example, a
client) who may not have access to your BusinessObjects environment or
office network.
You can send a document or documents to others in four ways:
 InfoView Inbox
 E-mail
 FTP
 Specifying a file location
Your BusinessObjects Administrator must configure these options, with the
exception of the InfoView Inbox. If these features aren’t enabled and config-
ured, you can’t use them. The same configuration is needed when you 
schedule a document instance.
Before sending a document, you must first go to the folder where the docu-
ment is located. The following sections show you how to send a document
for each option, starting from the Inbox.
Sending to the Inbox
Sending your document to the InfoView Inbox is just another way of saying
that you’re transferring the document to another folder.
The following steps show you how to do this.
Figure 14-13:
A drilled-
down
document.
201
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

1. Select the desired document by finding it in your Inbox and clicking
the checkbox.
You can select as many documents as you like.
2. From the InfoView toolbar, choose Send➪To BusinessObjects Inbox.
The Send window appears.
3. Select Inbox from the Destination drop-down list.
4. Select the Use the Job Server’s Defaults checkbox.
If you can’t use the Job Server’s default settings (or if you want to 
customize those settings), deselect this option.
The window expands, as shown in Figure 14-14.
5. Select Users or Groups from the Choose drop-down list. 
The Available Recipients box fills with your selections.
6. Select the users or groups to whom you want to send the document,
using the Available Recipients box.
Your document(s) appears in the Inbox of the selected users or groups.
7. Select a target name.
You have three naming options:
• Let BusinessObjects name the document automatically (that name
appears in the Inbox).
• Select a placeholder (such as a title, e-mail address, ID, and so on).
• Type a specific name.
8. Select whether to actually copy the document to the Inbox or provide
a shortcut instead.
Figure 14-14:
The
expanded
Send
window.
202
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

If you decide to create only a shortcut, the document remains in its orig-
inal location and acts as a link that the recipient can access to view the
document. In that case, the document isn’t literally sent.
9. When your changes are complete, click Submit.
The document appears in the recipient’s Inbox, as shown in Figure 14-15.
Sending an e-mail
You can also e-mail a document (or any other type of document stored in
your folders or Inbox) to another user.
We recommend using the Job Server’s configuration when you use this fea-
ture; otherwise you may find it difficult to enter your server details manually.
Use the Job Server configuration unless you have a good reason (a really
good reason) not to use it. If you’re using BusinessObjects in the context of a
large corporation, it’s likely that you won’t have the Job Server details handy
or won’t have access to these configurations.
When you send an e-mail using the default configurations, you can send your
document to any e-mail recipient that is saved on the job server. The security
upside is that you can’t send anything you shouldn’t to outside users. The
downside is that you can only send to the number of people who can actually
receive the document.
If your system administrator is feeling nice, this is one of those good reasons
not to use the default Job Server configuration. If you manually enter the
domain and server information, you can also enter your e-mail recipient’s
Figure 14-15:
The
document
appears in
the Inbox.
203
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents

address manually: Simply select your document, fill in the necessary informa-
tion, not to mention your recipient, any message for the recipient, and so on,
and send!
Sending over FTP
Using the FTP option, you can transfer a document (or any other type of 
document stored in your folders or Inbox) to another user by storing it on an
FTP server. We recommend using the Job Server’s configuration to use this
feature; otherwise you may have a hard time entering your server details.
When you send a document using the default configurations, you can send
your document to an FTP server that is already set up through the Job Server.
If you opt not to use the Job Server default configurations, you can type the
name of an FTP server.
Sending to a file location
The File Location option is handy for transferring a document (or any other
type of document stored in your folders or Inbox) to another user by storing
it to somewhere on your hard drive. Here, too, we recommend using the Job
Server’s configuration to save yourself some fuss.
When you send a file using the default configurations, you can send your 
document to a file location that is already set up as an unmarked portion of
your hard drive through the Job Server.
If you opt not to use the Job Server default configurations, you can specify
where you want to store your file(s) by typing the path to that location.
Exporting Documents
If you use BusinessObjects at work, you may hear colleagues ask about
exporting documents — but they may actually be referring to sending (rather
than exporting) them.
You can actually go about exporting a document in three ways:
 Send a document: You can transfer it to the Inbox, e-mail it to someone,
transfer it to FTP, or send it to a specific file location. (See the earlier
section, “Sending Documents to Colleagues.”)
204
Part IV: Making Web Intelligence Work for You 

 Save your document: You can save your document to your computer or
a network drive using the Save to Computer As option. You can save it in
one of several formats, including Microsoft Excel, PDF, or CSV (if you want
a plain-text file). See the earlier section, “Viewing Documents,” for details.
 Import your document: Using the Import Wizard, you can export uni-
verses and documents from one BusinessObjects repository to another.
This option, which we discuss in this section, is only for advanced
BusinessObjects users and administrators.
Follow these steps to use the Import Wizard to transfer documents:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects XI Release 2➪
BusinessObjects Enterprise➪Import Wizard.
The Import Wizard appears.
2. Click Next.
The Source Environment screen appears, as shown in Figure 14-16.
3. Enter the login and password for the source CMS (BusinessObjects
environment) and click Next.
The Destination Environment screen appears.
4. Enter the login and password for the destination CMS (BusinessObjects
environment) and click Next.
The Select Objects to Import screen appears. You can choose a BIAR 
file as a source or destination environment. However, for a XI Release 2
or older environment (BO 6.5, Crystal Reports 10) it can only be for a
source.
5. Deselect all options and then select Import Users and Users Groups;
click Next.
205
Chapter 14: Working with Your Completed Documents
BIAR files
Even though BIAR files are potentially a big topic
all by themselves, it’s handy to know about their
purpose in case you encounter these often-used
files at the office. You can create BIAR (Business
Intelligence Application Resource) files in
BusinessObjects for easy importing and export-
ing. A BIAR file collects folders, universes, doc-
uments, categories, and so on and saves them in
a single file that can be installed in another
BusinessObjects environment with minimal work
on your end. 
Note, however, BIAR files are pretty advanced
stuff; we recommend getting thoroughly familiar
with using BusinessObjects before you try using
them. In fact, Business Objects recommends
contacting its support staff to help determine (a)
where to find your BIAR file(s) and (b) whether
you should use this feature.

The Import Scenario screen appears.

Part V
Keeping Track of
How Your
Organization 
Is Doing

In this part. . .
T
his part helps you take your use of the BusinessObjects
XI Release 2 Enterprise suite to the next level.
In these following chapters, you move on from the simple
reports you build with WebI and DeskI to find out how 
you can use the suite’s Performance Management tools to
create dashboards, metrics and analytics to keep track of
how your organization is doing.
Chapter 15 is all about dashboards: what they’re for, how
to create one, and how to make them more visible by
putting one right on your home page.
In Chapter 16, you discover how to make effective use of
analytics in conjunction with Business Objects technology.
Chapter 17 introduces you to the final weapon in your per-
formance management arsenal: metrics. We walk you
through creating your own metrics and goals, and help
you see where they fit into the big picture and appreciate
the value they add to a business intelligence suite.

I
f you need to analyze specific data on a particular subject, the usual
approach is to search for a document whose name you already know 
in your list of available documents in InfoView, open the document, and
browse through it for the data you’re looking for. Alternatively, you could
build this data into the report itself, or you could create a new report from
the universe you’re using. In any case, you already know what information
you’re looking for.
It’s also quite possible, however, that what you need is an at-a-glance macro
view of what’s going on in your business. That’s where a dashboard comes in
handy.
A dashboard is a portal made up of pages and tabs that organizes data accord-
ing to the information it contains. This portal can be secured in such a way as
to customize what users can see depending on their role in the company. A
CEO, for instance, might have access to the whole dashboard, while a sales
manager would see sales data (perhaps filtered geographically) but would
not have access to worldwide HR information.
Each page in a dashboard contains analytical tools and interactive charts,
which display and highlight key performance indicators — such as trends
over time, comparison with goals, strategy maps, alerts, and such. They also
contain links to reports so you can drill down on information, always going
from a macro view of your data into more and more detail.

Accessing Dashboard Manager
Dashboards are designed to provide you with a consistent view of your busi-
ness data and alert you about critical information, allowing you to monitor
your company’s activity more effectively. The BusinessObjects tool that 
lets you do this is Dashboard Manager.
The supported environment for Dashboard Manager is less complete than for
the BusinessObjects XI Enterprise Release 2 platform as a whole. In particu-
lar, the .NET version of BusinessObjects XI Enterprise is not supported.
Specific features (such as dynamic viewers) may require you to install
browser plug-ins. Check the Business Objects Web site for details.
To get started, you first need to open the Dashboard Manager tool:
1. Log in to InfoView.
2. Click the Performance Management icon, as shown in Figure 15-1.
The Performance Management area opens.
If you can’t see the Performance Management icon, make sure that the prod-
uct has been correctly installed by clicking License Keys in the CMC (Central
Management Console, see Chapter 3) and checking to make sure you have a
key for BusinessObjects Dashboard Manager.
Creating a Dashboard
Basically, there are two kinds of dashboards. Corporate dashboards exist to
share information company-wide; personal dashboards are designed for your
own individual work needs.

Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

This section shows how to create a corporate dashboard, and then how to
create a personal dashboard.
Constructing a new corporate dashboard
When you open Dashboard Manager for the first time, you’re presented with
the default demo dashboard that contains different tabs for each activity
(Sales, Marketing, Products, and others) of a fictional company called Total
Electronics, as shown in Figure 15-2. We’re guessing, however, that you might
be more interested in creating a dashboard that displays data for your
company.
To create a new, empty dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Click Dashboard Builder in the Dashboard Manager top toolbar.
The Dashboard Builder page opens. 
2. Click Add, and then select New Dashboard.
3. Enter the name of your dashboard in the Name box on the right side
of the page.
4. Click Save, browse to the location in the repository where you want to
save your new dashboard, and then click OK.
The new dashboard name has been added to the Dashboard structure.
Figure 15-2:
The default
dashboard.
211
Chapter 15: A Different Kind of Dashboard

Constructing a personal dashboard
In Part V, we showed you how in InfoView you can save a document in the My
Folder and Corporate Folder areas. Well, dashboards follow a similar logic.
A Corporate Dashboard is an enterprise application, made by business intelli-
gence specialists, secured and published through the company according 
to users’ activities. In this case most users have read-only access to this
dashboard.
If you want to give users more autonomy, you can allow individuals to make
their own dashboard from reports and data they can access according to
their profiles, using the My Dashboard area, which provides a simplified way
to build dashboards. Personal dashboards can’t be shared with other users.
To create a personal dashboard, follow these steps:
1. From the Performance Management toolbar, click the My Dashboards
icon.
The My Dashboards Information page appears.
2. Click the Add link to create tabs in the My Dashboard area. 
Your dashboard is now saved in your Favorites folder in InfoView
(instead of a public folder).
After you’ve created menus, you have the same workflows and features as a
corporate dashboard for customizing content and layout.
Filling Up Your Dashboard
So you have a new dashboard — but it’s looking pretty bare. Your next step is
to decide the structure of your dashboard and start filling it with content.
Adding a menu
In Dashboard Builder, the first stage of adding content to your dashboard is
to add tabs (called menus in the Dashboard Manager) so you can organize
your dashboard in line with the main activities of your organization that you
want to monitor. Next, you structure each menu (remember, that’s what
Dashboard Manager calls tabs) by adding windows and links that lead to
other windows and pages. Here’s how that process looks:
212
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

1. Select your new corporate dashboard in the Structure panel.
2. Click Add.
3. Choose New Menu from the list of available options, and give it a
name.
A new menu is added to your dashboard. Figure 15-3 shows a dashboard
with four menus: Sales, Marketing, Products, and Performance.
Adding a submenu
A menu can contain several first level pages, called submenus. To add a sub-
menu, follow these steps:
1. Select a menu from your corporate dashboard in the Structure panel.
2. Click Add.
3. Select New Submenu from the list of available options, and give it a
name.
A new submenu is added to your dashboard menu. (Refer to Figure 15-3
where the Sales menu has a submenu with five items.)
Inserting an analytic
In order to add content to this new page, click Customize. Your page opens in
edit mode across two tabs: Content, the default tab that allows you to add
content to the page; and Layout, which allows you to modify what the page
looks like.
Figure 15-3:
A dashboard
with four
menus:
Sales,
Marketing,
Products,
and
Performance.
213
Chapter 15: A Different Kind of Dashboard

You might as well start with some useful business tools called analytics, which
help you analyze and interpret data by showing a macro-view of data at a
glance. From the Content tab (see Figure 15-4), you can drag and drop any 
elements from the Analytics list on the left. These elements are organized in
different directories:
 Analytic Catalog: A list of analytics delivered with the product, based on
the default demo data.
 Analytics Services: The interfaces used to create dashboard content —
pages, metrics (measurements), analytics, and so on — as described in
more detail in Chapters 16 and 17.
 Corporate Analytics: All corporate documents in InfoView.
 Existing Analytics: A list of analytics already in use in an existing dash-
board, which helps enable their reuse.
 List of Analytics: All documents and components in InfoView, including
personal documents.
 New Analytic: A catalog of analytics templates.
Figure 15-4:

Content tab.
214
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

To add a component to your page, follow these steps:
1. Open the folder that contains the analytic you want.
For example, if you want to add the Speedometer analytic based on the
demo data, you open the Analytic Catalog folder, the Metric Analytics
folder, and then finally the Alerts & Monitoring folder.
2. Place your cursor over the analytic, click, drag the analytic to your
page, and then release the cursor to drop it into place.
Your page now contains the analytic you choose. Figure 15-5 shows a
Speedometer with the default data Net Sales All Old, in a resizable
window.
We show you how to create new analytics in Chapter 16.
Adding free text and Web pages
Instead of using predefined analytics, you can also choose to insert free text —
or even a Web page — into a window on your dashboard:
1. Open the New Analytic folder in the Analytics list.
2. Click Text Analytic, and then drag it into an existing window on your
page. 
A new window called Text Analytic is added into your page
3. To edit the text, click Edit.
The same tabs appear as when customizing your window (Content and
Layout). 
Figure 15-5:
Adding a
Speedom-
eter to your
dashboard.
215
Chapter 15: A Different Kind of Dashboard

4. Type the text you want to display directly in the text area.
You can customize the style in which it is displayed by entering your
text using HTML tags to format the style, as shown in Figure 15-6. If you
want to add a logo or other image, copy it into the images subdirectory
on your server; by default, if you’re using the Tomcat server, this is 
$Tomcat Directory\webapps\businessobjects\enterprise115\
desktoplaunch\images
Alternatively, you can ask your administrator to do it for you. Then,
using a text analytic, insert it as an HTML image tag. For example
<img src=” ../images/myDummyLogo.png”>
5. To add a Web page, add the Web Page Analytic into a window, edit the
analytic, and then enter the URL in the content panel. 
This feature can be useful if you need easy access to applications on
your company intranet, or to a site on the Internet that can help you
analyze your data more effectively.
Adding BusinessObjects reports 
or other documents
If you want to add BusinessObjects reports (either WebI or DeskI reports), or
indeed any other documents, just drag them from the Corporate Analytics 
or List of Analytics in the Analytics List and drop them into your page as you
would for any other analytic.
You can only add BusinessObjects reports and other documents to your
dashboard if you’ve published them to InfoView first!

216
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

Defining Your Layout
After adding content to your dashboard page, you can now think about defin-
ing a layout for the whole page or for each window independently. A window
is only the default container of each analytic component. You can personalize
each window, modify their styles, turn them into hyperlinks or buttons, or
display their content directly into the main page. This section describes how
to define a dashboard layout.
Applying a predefined style 
to your dashboard
By default, the application provides six styles. You can choose any of them
for your full dashboard or for a specific window: 
 At the page level, you can manage (for example) the dashboard pages
background color. The style defined at this level becomes the default
values for all new analytics added to it. For existing analytics, you have
to modify the style manually.
 At the window level, you can manage (for example) each window’s title
bar style and background. You can select the same style for your page
style and then dress up windows in completely different styles if you
choose. You can also transform a window into a link to a new page or
display it like a simple part of your main page.
To apply a style to your component, follow these steps:
1. At the page level, select the Customize link; at the window level, click
the Edit button. 
In each case, the page or the window opens with the Content tab showing.
2. Click the Layout tab.
3. Add a title and a description.
The title is displayed at the top of the window. 
4. Specify the kind of display of the window content:
• Hide window borders: Using the Display As radio buttons, you can
hide window borders. In this case the analytic is displayed as a
simple part of the page, without interactivity.
• Transform the window into a link to a new page: In this case, the
main page displays a hyperlink with the title text opening a new
page containing the window content. Associating an image to this
hyperlink adds a button to the hyperlink.
217
Chapter 15: A Different Kind of Dashboard

5. Select your style from the Style Sheet drop-down list.
An overview of the style appears on the right.
Adding a custom style
If you don’t like the predefined styles that come with the dashboards, you
can define your own style. 
You need some Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) knowledge. You may want to
have your administrator on speed-dial because you’ll need to modify files 
on the server.
Here’s how to create your own style:
1. Define a name for the new style. 
You need a business name (for example, BO for Dummies) and a folder
name (for example, dummies). 
2. Modify the following properties file with your business and folder
names: 
$Business Objects Dir$\Performance Management 11.5\server\conf\style.xml
3. Go to your Web application directory at 
$Tomcat Dir$\webapps\businessobjects\enterprise115\desktoplaunch\styles
4. Add a new folder with the folder name from Step 1.
5. Copy all files from an existing sample.
From the Windows folder, for example.
6. Modify style.js with your new folder name.
7. Define your own style by modifying the style.css file and add dif-
ferent image files.
Figure 15-7 shows a customized dashboard.
Organizing Your Dashboard
After you fill your dashboard with the content you want to monitor, you may
also want to organize this content, in such a way that makes it easier for you
to see whatever information is most important to you first.
218
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

You can organize how your content is displayed in several ways:
 Move windows: Click somewhere in the window you want to move, drag
it to where you want to move it to, and then release the mouse button.
 Resize windows: Click the arrow button in the bottom-right corner of
the window, stretch or shrink the window to its new size, and then
release the mouse button.
 Use a preconfigured template: Choose one from the Template drop-down
list in the toolbar. Figure 15-8 shows the 2-2 template, which gives you
four equal-size windows in which to drag and drop content from the
Analytics list.
 Remove a window: Click the X at the top-right of the window.
When shuffling and resizing your windows, check the Snap to Grid checkbox
to ensure your dashboard retains at least a semblance of order!

Chapter 15: A Different Kind of Dashboard

Viewing Dashboards
After you build your dashboard and stuff it full of useful content, you may
want to see what the finished result looks like.
Opening your dashboard
To view your dashboard, go to the Performance Management home page.
There you can find your corporate dashboard and the menus it contains
listed by application in the Access Corporate tiered dashboard section. To
open a page of your dashboard, simply click the relevant link.
To view your personal dashboard, go to the Performance Management home
page and click the My dashboards section. To open a page of your personal
dashboard, simply click the relevant menu.
Making sense of a window
Your dashboard is an interactive application made up of different pages, win-
dows, and links.
To improve visibility and ease of use, you can maximize or minimize each
window independently.
Figure 15-8:
The 2-2
template

220
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

Each analytic contains interactive features specific to its type. In the
Speedometer, for instance, you can
 Place your mouse pointer over the Information icon to display the most
recent refresh date and time.
 Move the slicer along the Time axis to observe how your Net Sales value
varies for each month over the period you’re interested in.
 Use the color-coding of the gauge and the needle to track trends over
time. 
The default format for analytics is Adobe SVG, but you can choose to display
some analytics in Flash format by browsing to the Preference page, clicking
the Performance Management tab, and then checking Use Macromedia Flash
When Available.
Making a Dashboard Your Home Page
So you’ve created beautiful dashboards that provide you with quick and easy
access to key information about your organization’s activities. Fine. But there’s
no point creating them if you never take the time to look at them.
If you want your dashboard to help you deal with potential issues before they
occur, it must be one of the first applications you consult every day. And the
best way not to miss what it has to offer is to make your dashboard the home
page of your portal.
To make a dashboard your home page, follow these steps:
1. Log on to InfoView.
2. Click Preferences on the Header panel toolbar.
3. On the General tab, select a dashboard from the My Initial View Is 
section:
• Corporate: Click Select to browse in the Dashboard builder direc-
tory structure.
• Personal: Choose a personal dashboard from the drop-down list, as
shown in Figure 15-9.

Chapter 16
Making Better Decisions 
through Analytics
In This Chapter
 Appreciating and making effective use of analytics
 Basing a new analytic on a measure from a BusinessObjects universe
 Using analytics with BusinessObjects technology
Just as the previous chapter compares reports and dashboards — with
dashboards providing an at-a-glance macro view of what’s going on in
your business, and reports providing specific, more detailed data — so this
chapter makes a similar comparison: In this case, charts inside reports pro-
vide the specifics, and analytics inside dashboards help shape the macro
view of your data.
While a chart in a report displays detailed data in a particular area, the aim of
an analytic is to highlight an indicator or trend in order to allow you to moni-
tor it more effectively.
Understanding the Value of Analytics
In BusinessObjects, an analytic is a logical tool for visualizing data in a specific
way. Creating an analytic involves selecting the template and data to use, and
then personalizing how it’s rendered, tailoring it to the data you want to ana-
lyze (trends, history, or whatever).
A major difference between analytics and charts is that analytics are 
interactive — inside an analytic, you can monitor the time dimension. Analytics
can show, for instance, whether your sales are going up or down, identify those
countries where business is increasing significantly, or reveal which product 
is contributing the most to your bottom line.

Analytics are classified in several groups:
 Trend analysis analytics monitor trends over time, such as interactive
metric trends, or Raw versus Smoothed and Dual metric comparisons,
which are based on WebI documents.
 Alerts and monitors warn you about an issue or give a global view of
the health of an indicator and include gauges, alerts, metric lists, and
metric trees.
 Comparison analytics like Pareto charts, or Kiviat and radar diagrams
based on WebI documents.
 Performance management analytics measure achievement against
goals, such as goal analytics or strategy maps.
Depending on their function, you can build some analytics using data from a
BusinessObjects universe, a metric, or a goal; others may come specifically
from a metric; and still others may come from a goal. (We go into more detail
about metrics and goals in Chapter 17.)
To help understand the value of analytics, this section takes a look at three of
those most commonly used: barometers, traffic lights, and Pareto charts.
Barometer
In the physical world, a barometer is a tool designed to measure atmospheric
pressure and (based on the result it obtains) predict trends in the weather. In
a similar way, the barometer analytic shows trends in a measure by display-
ing its variation over time.
The barometer is one of the six gauge analytics, which are found in the Alerts
and Monitors folder. 
The barometer analytic that appears in the default demo is made up of three
colored areas, each equal in size:
 Red: Contains the lowest values in the key performance indicator.
 Green: Contains the highest values.
 Orange: Contains the values that fall in the medium range.
For a satisfaction index (such as the example shown in Figure 16-1), the closer
a value is to 100%, the better — so the colored areas of the barometer have
been defined to match this requirement. The highest and lowest values for
the time range defined on the slider (67% and 78% in our example) are indi-
cated on the boundaries of the chart.
224
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

The slider underneath the barometer lets you position the arrow for a given
period of time. The bold needle represents the value for the selected period;
the thin needle shows the previous period. The tooltip tells you the percent
change in comparison to the previous period and gives an indicator of the
trend.
Figure 16-1 shows that the index value is 73% on December 1, 2007. Although
this value only falls in the medium area (compared to the time-range data),
the previous month’s value was in the red area, so the percentage change
between November and December is 4.29% and the trend indicator is up.
Traffic light
As every good driver knows, a traffic light tells you whether to go ahead,
exercise caution, or stop immediately — with the aim of preventing “prob-
lems” farther down the line.
Similarly, the traffic-light analytic (shown in Figure 16-2) — which is another
type of gauge analytic, and found in the Alerts and Monitors folder — provides
an indicator of the health of a particular measure for the current period,
based on predefined criteria that determine what is “good” and “bad.”
Figure 16-1:
This
barometer

Customer
Satisfaction
Index, a key
performance
indicator.
225
Chapter 16: Making Better Decisions through Analytics

Pareto chart
A Pareto chart displays the best contributors of a category for any given mea-
sure. It is one of the comparison analytics and is found in the Comparison
folder.
In a Pareto chart, solid bars represent the value of each item in the category,
sorted in descending order. The cumulative curve (the thin, red line) shows
the overall total for the category as each contribution is added. The number
of bars is limited — with five bars being typical — and the final bar repre-
sents the value of all the other items in the category.
Pareto charts provide a visual representation of the 80–20 percent rule — a
classic business rule stating that 80 percent of any effect is caused by 20 
percent of the contributing factors.
The Pareto chart shown in Figure 16-3 indicates that the net sales of the PC
Components product line accounts for almost half of all sales: around $12
million out of a total of $23 million. Click the cumulative curve for bar B and a
tooltip appears, revealing that the net sales generated by the PC Components
and Electronics product lines have a combined value of $16.9 million.
Notice that not every possible product line is specifically represented in this
chart. When you create an analytic, you explicitly define the number of bars
it is to contain. In this example, the number of product lines and the number
of bars is the same: five. If there had been more than five product lines, the
fifth bar would have shown the sum total of net sales for all the other product
lines.

Creating Analytics Based 
on Universe Measures
You start creating an analytic from (no surprise here) the Create New
Analytic page. You can access that page in two ways:
 In InfoView, choose New➪Analytic (as shown in Figure 16-4).
 In the Performance Management application, click the Create New
Analytic link in the Dashboard Manager tab. 
By default, the most commonly used analytics are displayed when the appli-
cation opens.
When you’ve chosen the analytic you want, you go into Edit mode, which is
where you define the data you want to measure and set the parameters for
how the results are to be rendered.

227
Chapter 16: Making Better Decisions through Analytics

Each analytic’s dialog box contains at least two parts: the settings for data
definition and the settings for visualization. 
Depending on the specifics of the analytic you choose, the way in which you
select data or the visualization settings may differ.
Figure 16-5 shows a Speedometer (see Chapter 15), along with the Pareto
Chart and Barometer. It also features an Interactive Metric Trends analytic,
which — as its name suggests — is generally a metric-based analytic (see
Chapter 17); a Map to show how values change over a geographic area; and a
Thermometer, which is another kind of gauge analytic that we show you how
to build in the next section.

Building your own Thermometer
To show how analytics work, we show you how to create a new Thermometer
analytic that shows monthly profit by product line. The Thermometer ana-
lytic works similarly to other analytics.
To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Thermometer template on the Create New Analytic page.
2. Select the data you want to display in your analytic. 
You have a choice: You can display metrics, goals, or data from the uni-
verse. For this example, we selected Universe Query from the Select
Data to Display drop-down list, as shown in Figure 16-6.
3. Click Define Query to open the Query Panel to define the data from a
universe.
Although a Thermometer analytic displays only one value of a measure
at a time, the interactivity of the analytic allows you to delve into one or
two dimensions to track variations in the measure. To do so, you have to
associate dimensions with the measure when you define the query.
4. To view profits on a time and product line axis, select the following
objects from the Sales universe: Year-month, Line, and Profit.
You can add objects by selecting them in the Universe Objects list, and
then moving them to the Result Objects and Query Filters lists by click-
ing the >> button, as shown in Figure 16-7.
5. Click OK to close the Query Panel.
Figure 16-6:
Select the
data you
want to
display 
in your

from a drop-
down list.
229
Chapter 16: Making Better Decisions through Analytics

6. Select the objects defined in your query to be displayed in the 
analytic:
• Measure To Display: Select Profit.
• Dimension for X-Axis and Slider: Select Year-Month.
• Dimension for Slice’s List: Select Line.
7. Select a template from the Render Style section.
For the thermometer analytic, choose the Thermometer template.
8. Set the color-coding rules according to data trend in the Graph
Properties section.
By default, three zones are defined: green, orange, and red. They’re split
in equal sizes that are automatically calculated from the values of the
measure.
9. (Optional) Customize the default configuration and adapt it to suit
your data:
Set global boundaries
• To define fixed min and max values of the global data range, select
the boundaries manually. 
• To set minimum and maximum values equal to the minimum and
maximum values of the measure, check the Calculated
Automatically Based on Measure Value radio button.
Figure 16-7:
Setting
Profit as one
of the Result
Objects to
display.
230
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

Set boundaries for each zone
• To fill fixed boundaries for each zone, select Zones Entered by
Value from the Zone drop-down menu, select a colored zone, and
fill the boundaries values manually.
• To use the same workflow to fix a percent for each zone, select
Zones Entered Manually, by % from the Zone List drop-down menu.
Set color zones
• To increase or reduce the number of zones, click the + or – buttons.
To modify the default color of each zone, select a colored zone and
use the palette to change it.
• To give a correct range to profit measure, change the color of the
three predefined zones. For instance, you could make the first
zone, which corresponds to the lowest levels of profit, red, and
make the third zone, which corresponds to the highest levels of
profit, green. See Figure 16-8.
10. Add a title to your analytic in the Graph Option section. 
The metric name is used by default; in the case of a universe-based ana-
lytic, you have to add a metric name. 
11. Set the display options:
• Un-check the Dimension Slider box to remove the slider from the
analytic.

Adding a symbol can be a useful way of displaying the currency of
the displayed measure or marking a measure as a percentage, if the
measure doesn’t have a symbol already attached in the universe.
To add a symbol, simply type it in the Symbol field.
The profit measure of the Sales universe already has the $ cur-
rency attached, so it’s displayed with the value in the analytic
automatically.
12. Improve interactivity of the analytic by defining hyperlinks:
• To set a hyperlink to a report or any document from the analytic title,
from the Navigation Option section, click Browse to select a docu-
ment from the InfoView list.
• To set multiple links from the analytic with the Multiple Links dialog
box, click the Multiple Links button to open the Edit Navigation
Link Menu dialog box (see Figure 16-9). Click the Add button, and
for each hyperlink, click the Browse to select a document from the
Infoview list.
• Click the Move Up and Move Down buttons to order your 
hyperlinks.

Viewing your data
When you move the slider position to April 2007, the analytic shows that for
the computer-software product line, the profit for this period (with a value of
$93,748) was in the orange zone — but with significant growth from the previ-
ous month (shown in the middle of the red zone).
To visualize the profit for another product line, click the List icon or the text
itself to display the list of product lines and select a different value, as shown
in Figure 16-11.
To refresh the date you’re seeing, hover your mouse pointer over the Infor-
mation icon: A tooltip displays the date of the last refresh of the analytic, as

You can choose from these display modes:
 SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Interactive default format of many ana-
lytics (such as gauges).
 Applet: To get the analytic into editing format, some analytics propose
SVG as snapshot and Applet for interactive display.
 CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Save your analytic in this format if you
expect to export the data of the analytic.
 Flash (Macromedia) used for more interactivity and zero footprint. This
display format is not available for all analytics. 
 HTML: For 508-compliancy (the standard for disabled people — for more
information, see www.access-board.gov/508.htm).
After you’ve chosen a display mode, you can access your analytic from the
InfoView folder (as you would any other type of document). InfoView identi-
fies your analytics by displaying the icon shown in Figure 16-15.

A word about formats
By default, the format in which gauges appear
on-screen is Adobe SVG. If the Abode SVG 3.x.
component is not installed on your computer, the
product proposes that you install it from the Web
(recommended for MS Internet Explorer users).
If you want to display your gauges in Flash
format, the Macromedia plug-in (Adobe Flash
Player 9) has to be installed first. Otherwise your
analytics won’t be displayed properly.
To set Flash format as your default display
format, go to the Preferences page; from
Performance Management tab, check the option
labeled Use Macromedia Flash when available. 
Users of the Firefox browser normally prefer to
use the Flash rendering for designing analytics.

Inserting an analytic into a dashboard
From the analytic page, click the Add to My Dashboard link to add the analytic
to the personal dashboard. From there, you can either add the analytic into an
existing page of your personal dashboard or into a new page. The analytic is
placed into the dashboard at a default location. You can customize the page to
modify its settings. Figure 16-16 shows what this looks like.
To add the analytic into a corporate dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Save your chosen analytic in the public folder tree.
2. Customize a page of your dashboard.
3. Drag and drop the analytic from the Corporate List to your dashboard
page.
Figure 16-17 shows an analytic added to a corporate dashboard.
You can also create a new analytic directly from the Dashboard Design page.
Here’s the drill:
1. Drag and drop the analytic template of your choice from the New
Analytic folder. 
The analytic opens in Edit mode.
2. Add the content of the analytic.
In this case, type its data and rendering characteristics.

Creating a Map Analytic 
Based on a Universe
A map analytic displays how the results of a measure break down geographi-
cally. It lets you drill into each area to get more detailed data. The map analytic
shown in this section contains common geographical levels: World/continent/
countries and specific levels for each country. For instance, it contains state
and county levels for the United States, and a region level for France.
In this section, you create a map analytic based on the geodata universe
that comes with BusinessObjects. 
To create a map analytic from your own data, you must create a universe that
has the same characteristics as the geodata example. To verify it has been
configured properly, check out Chapter 17.
The characteristics of the geodata universe are pretty basic.
 It contains one geo class with geographical dimensions and one sales
measure, as shown in Figure 16-18.
 The geohierarchy table defines relationships between each level. 
 The three lookup tables give both the name and the long name for each
code defined in the relationship table.
Figure 16-17:
You can add
analytics 
to the
corporate
dashboard 
if they’ve
been saved
in a public
folder.
238
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

 Data relationships and hierarchies are used for navigation from level to
level within the analytic.
Maps use the values for Country, level1, and level2 — so use the
same values in your own universe as those defined in the maps’ 
properties.
 From the geo_fact fact table, the following auto-join has been defined
on the date object: 
geo_fact.date between @Prompt(‘BEGIN_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free) AND
@Prompt(‘END_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free)
 BEGIN_DATE and END_DATE are keywords used by the BusinessObjects
engine. Don’t change the case; don’t translate them because the end
user doesn’t use them.
This auto-join defines the time period to display in the analytic. If it is
not defined in the universe, the Time Window section isn’t available in
the map analytic properties.
Additionally, the universe contains three hierarchies that define the parent-
child relationships between objects (see Figure 16-19):
 Geo Code with objects: Country Code, Level1 Code, Level2 Code
 Geo Name with objects: Country Name, Level1 Name, Level2 Name.
 Geo Long Name with objects: Country Longname, Level1
Longname, Level2 Longname.
 Level1 is the child of the Country level, such as state for United
States and region for France. 
 Level2 is the child of Level1: so county for the United States
and departement for France.

To create your map analytic, follow these steps:
1. In InfoView, choose New➪Analytic and then open the Map template
on the Create New Analytic page.
The analytic’s template opens in Edit mode.
A map analytic requires very specific settings for data definitions but
accepts settings for rendering properties that are common to most other
analytics.
2. Select the map to be displayed as first level, the highest level from the
Select Data to Display section.
3. Check the Use a Universe radio button.
You can use data from a universe or a metric. For the purpose of these
steps, we’ve based this map analytic on a universe.
4. Select Map from the Map drop-down list, and Longname from the
Match Object By drop-down list.
5. Click the Select Objects button.
The Select Objects dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16-20.
6. From the Subject Area drop-down menu, choose a universe class.
For a map analytic, select Geo as the subject area.
7. From the Measure drop-down menu, select the measure to display.
For a map analytic, select Sales as the measure.
8. From the Classification list, choose the higher dimension to display.
For more accuracy, choose Country Longname.

9. Select the aggregation to apply on measure from the Aggregation
Method drop-down menu.
For a map analytic based on a universe, choose Sum.
10. Select the hierarchy corresponding to your chosen classification type
from the Dimension Hierarchy drop-down menu.
For a map analytic, choose Geo Longname as the hierarchy for your
dimensions.
11. Depending on the type of classification object you want — code, name,
or long name — choose the appropriate match from the Match Map
Object By drop-down menu.
The idea is to identify the retrieved data for the map engines in order to
ensure good matching.
If you use other data from this universe (instead of the data shown
here), you may end up with data missing from your map because the
geodata default database is not complete.
12. Adjust the visualization settings according to the Sales measure. 
• Define the number of ranges to use in order to define the number
of color zones. For each zone, define a color and boundaries:
Boundaries can be calculated automatically with equal values. For
example if you define four zones, the boundaries cover the values
from 0 to 25 %, 25 to 50%, 50 to 75% and 75 to 100%.
To specify custom boundaries, check the Manually Set Ranges
radio button and select a specific percent for each zone.
• Define a title using Map name or typing some text.
• Choose to show the legend by checking the Show Legend box.
• Set hyperlinks by clicking the Browse button and selecting a docu-
ment from the InfoView list.

13. Select all periods proposed in the Time Period section.
Choose this option because the default database doesn’t have data for
the current period.
The map is now displayed, as shown in Figure 16-21.
The World map is colored according to sales volume ranges displayed in the
legend. If you hover your mouse pointer over a country, a tooltip displays its
long name and its total sales. Click the country and the analytic displays the
map of the selected country, along with detail on a secondary level, as shown
in Figure 16-22.

Using Performance Manager to
Set Goals and Track Achievement
In This Chapter
 Fitting metrics and goals into the big picture
 Creating your own metrics and goals
 Adding value through metrics, goals, and analytics
I
n the two previous chapters, we looked at how reports compare to dash-
boards, and how charts compare to analytics. In this chapter, we look at
the differences between a universe measure and a metric.
Chapter 15 described how to create a dashboard containing a speedometer
gauge based on a metric — that’s business-speak for a named value used to
evaluate performance — for example, net sales by month for a given time
range. To get a handle on this metric, you can use a Speedometer gauge to
compare current sales with the previous period’s sales (or other such values)
over the time range you specify, comparing the values you get when you run
the analytic from time to time.
To get the sales history, we took three general steps:
 We defined a specific indicator as a metric: the one showing net sales
(based on a universe measure). 
 We defined as metadata the aggregation function over time, the time
range, and the trend.
 We stored the values for the specified time range in system tables.
The Performance Management catalog comes with a series of analytics that
compare metrics and goals, enabling you to monitor the value of data (both
forecast and actual) over time. To access the Performance Management cata-
log, select the Performance Manager Analytics page from the Performance
Manager Menu.

In this chapter, we show you how to set up your analytics to compare metrics
with the goals of your company.
Configuring Your Environment 
to Build Metrics
A metric shows the measure obtained after you’ve run an analytic to examine
some aspect of your company’s performance. In BusinessObjects, you
choose from three to five components for each metric you create: a measure,
an aggregation function, a filter, a calendar, and a slicer.
A measure is a specific numerical value obtained at a specific time; its mean-
ing is pretty limited unless placed in context. (The same is true when you
create an analytic.) When you choose a measure, you must always choose a
dimension — at the very least, the time axis. Simple measures with few
dimensions can be adapted to just about any data context, but if you want
the measure to serve as a performance indicator, it’s better to freeze its defini-
tion: You must define your measure not only as a value, but also as belonging
to a specific context — for example, net sales by month (value) over the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008 (context).
When you accumulate instances of a BusinessObjects measure over a speci-
fied time period, what you get is a metric — a time-based aggregation of a
246
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 
You got a license for that?
Dashboard Manager is the tool you use to create
and measure your dashboards, analytics, and
metrics. Using goals requires the specific license
of the Performance Manager module. While
Dashboard Manager is the basis of the
Performance Management Business Objects
Suite and can be used alone, Performance
Manager is an additional part of this Suite that
offers more advanced capabilities like use of
goals and goals analytics.
Even if both modules are automatically installed
at the same time, one more license key is
required for Performance Manager. To make
sure that you can use the goal-setting capabili-
ties of Performance Manager, check your
BusinessObjects installation to make sure that
the appropriate product key has been added in
the Central Management Console (CMC); this
capability is not part of the standard installation.
From the CMC, open the license keys page and
check that BusinessObjects Performance
Manager is added. If your license allows you to
use Performance Manager, the Performance
Manager tab is visible to the right of the
Dashboard Manager tab.
After you’ve ensured that you have the appropri-
ate licenses in place, you can access metric
tools from the Dashboard Manager tab and goal
tools from the Performance Manager tab.

measure. You can also filter the measure to track it on a particular dimension
(for more about dimensions, see Chapter 8), or slice the measure through a
dimension to detect a trend — such as whether the metric is going up or down.
Typical metrics include some detailed specifications — for example, average
revenue per customer profile for each month over the last two years or net sales
by region for the last four quarters. Each metric comes with its own history,
showing the value for each period over its associated time range.
A slicer is a dimension used to subdivide the values of a particular metric, or
even of a particular measure. If you define (say) the Product Line dimension
as a slicer, what you get is a sliced metric — in this case, a value for each
product line. The user interface shows an individual value for each product
line independently (say, convertible sales and sedan sales instead of the more
general car sales).
You have to define four parameters for your metric — measure, filter, calen-
dar, and slicer — before Dashboard Manager provides you with the needed
aggregation functions. The following sections describe what you need to do
to make the interface ready for creating metrics.
Setting up a universe to build metrics
Measures, filters, and the fact table (a table in which measures are stored)
containing the fact date must be available before you can create metrics in
specific universes. Each such universe has to be declared in the Setup appli-
cation of Performance Management.
Your first step, then, is to open the compuwarehouse metrics universe,
which is shown in Figure 17-1, that comes with BusinessObjects.
Here are some points to keep in mind about building metrics:
 In the Classes and Objects panel, you define one or more classes.
When you define dimensions and metrics in Performance Management,
you see data displayed by classes and not by universe. This sample uni-
verse contains one Metrics class with measures, dimensions, and pre-
defined filters. While you’re creating and managing your metrics, you
see the Metrics class — but not the compuwarehouse metrics uni-
verse name — on-screen. 
Several universes have classes with the same name; in this case, the uni-
verse name is displayed between parentheses after the class name.
247
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

 In your chosen universe, you define your dimensions, predefined filters,
and measures in their relevant classes.
 To configure the time dimension, you must give every fact table (in this
universe, the OrderDetails and SupplierOrders tables) the follow-
ing auto-join on its date column. The metric engine uses this join; it has
the following syntax:
between @Prompt(‘BEGIN_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free) AND
@Prompt(‘END_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free)
‘BEGIN_DATE’ and ‘END_DATE’ are variables used by the metric
engine. Remember: They are case-sensitive.
Declaring a universe
When you have your main properties set up in your universe, you have to
declare your universe in the Setup Application installed with Performance
Management.
During this process, the metric engine reads and stores the metadata from
the universe in its database — which is different from the CMC repository.
The Performance Management repository has to be set in the System Setup
tab of the Setup application.
Figure 17-1:
Using the
demo
universe 
to build 
a metric.
248
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

To declare an object in a particular universe as a source for a metric, follow
these steps:
1. In Performance Manager, click the Setup button and then, in the Setup
application that opens, click the System Setup tab.
The Repository page opens, which contains information about CMS and
repository database connections.
2. Click the Universes link on the System Setup tab.
The Universes page opens.
3. Click the Add Universe button.
The Add a Universe dialog box opens.
4. Select a universe from the Measure Universe drop-down list. 
5. Click OK.
The dialog box closes.
6. To upload the universe metadata in the Performance Management
repository, select your universe from the Universe Definition box and
click the Update button.
The universe content, measures, dimensions, and filters with their defin-
itions appear in the lower area of the page, as shown in Figure 17-2.
This area shows the SQL definition of each object.
Figure 17-2:
The
Universes
page.
249
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

If you want to build a metric over time, make sure its SQL statement contains
a time filter on the fact table and the date in its WHERE clause. You can check
it selecting your measure in the Available Objects list of the Universe Content
section. The SQL of your measure must contain the following filter:
between @Prompt(‘BEGIN_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free) AND
@Prompt(‘END_DATE’,’D’,,mono,free)
The metric engine stores metadata in its own repository. If you’ve changed the
universe metadata and you want to update the existing metric definition auto-
matically, check the Update Metric and Control Chart Definitions checkbox.
Declaring dimensions 
After you update the universe you’re using, your next step is to set up the
dimensions of the metric. To do so, follow these steps:
1. On the System Setup tab, click the Dimensions link.
The Dimensions page appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
2. Click Add to add a new dimension.
The Create Dimension dialog box appears.
A sliced dimension is made up of two main fields: 
Figure 17-3:
The
Dimensions
page.
250
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

• Slice Name defines the slicer’s purpose as a brief, functional name
that shows up on the user interface.
• Slice Code is for query purposes. Taking the example of the geogra-
phy dimension, viewing United States, for instance, is better
than simply displaying its code.
3. Enter an explicit name and place a check mark next to “Yes, I want to
create sliced metrics on this dimension.”
This process maps the chosen dimensions of the universe as names and
codes, organized by class.
4. Select the universe class from the Subject Area drop-down list, and
then map the code and display fields with their universe counterpart. 
• From the Object for Dimension Name list box, select the object to
be displayed as dimension values.
• From the Object for Dimension Code list box, select the object to
query on (generally the code associated to the dimension display).
• Fill the Global Sliced Name field to set the name you want displayed
on-screen to identify the full dimension.
5. Click the Next button.
The dimension values appear in the second panel.
6. From this new panel, click the Refresh button to get the dimension
values from the database.
The list box now contains two columns; each has a dimension name and
code values.
7. Click the Next button to define the level of security you want to set on
this dimension. 
In this area, you can add secured dimensions by user. If you don’t want
to do that yet, choose None for Now.
8. Click End to exit the wizard.
Your dimension is created and now appears in the list of dimensions on the
Dimension page.
Creating a calendar
Calendars are the last part to configure in the System setup.
Calendars contain all the periods for which a metric can be computed. For
example, the Speedometer analytic’s time slider represents the periods of the
calendar on which the metric has been defined.
251
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

You can create several kinds of calendars:
 A calendar based on a default interval (for Day to Year).
 A custom calendar where you define weekends or skip days. For exam-
ple, if you have no business on weekends, you can skip them in your
analytics. Monday will be the next day after Friday, and your chart will
be continued without any discontinuity.
 An imported calendar (defined in a CSV file saved in InfoView).
To create a calendar, follow these steps:
1. From the Setup application, click the Time Config tab.
2. Select the Calendar page.
For each calendar you want to set up, you need to define the different
parameters.
3. Click the Add button to create a new calendar.
The Add a Calendar dialog box appears. as shown in Figure 17-4.
4. Give your calendar a name and a description in the Name section.
5. In the Type of Periods section, check one of the three radio buttons to
define the calendar type: Calendar, Custom, or Imported.
6. Define your calendar depending on the type you chose in Step 5:
If you selected the Calendar option
a) Select an interval from the Interval drop-down list. You select the
period. In this case, a level of the Gregorian calendar: Day, Weekly,
Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly.
Figure 17-4:
The Add a
Calendar
dialog box.
252
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

The interval you choose determines the date values for which the
metric will be computed. For example, if you choose Quarterly,
your calendar gets one value by quarter, so any metrics using this
calendar get one value by quarter too.
b) In the Calendar Span section, set the first period with the From drop-
down list. Set the last period of your calendar with the To drop-down
list.
Notice that in each case, the calendar component to the right can
help you to select a date.
If you select the Custom radio button
a) Specify the period frequency of your calendar from the Period Every
drop-down list. You can define custom periods based on days,
weeks, months, quarters, or years. For example, if you select 2
Months from the Period Every drop-down list, the calendar has
one value every two months.
If you select the default selection — 1 Day(s) — you can skip week-
ends by checking the Skip Weekend Days box, and define your days
off by checking the Skip checkbox and select the Days Off link. The
Select Days Off dialog box opens. Select a date for the calendar com-
ponents and click the Add button to add it as a day off. Your
selected date is then added into the Days Off list.
b) In the Calendar Span section, set the first period with the From drop-
down list. Specify the total number of periods you want for your cal-
endar. The last period is then defined based on this number of
periods.
If you select the Imported radio button
a) Click Browse to select it from the InfoView document or type the URL
directly if the calendar is stored on the server file system. The
imported file must contain one row per period, and this period
must be a date.
b) Specify the format of the dates of the imported file, and specify whether
the first row of this file contains a column header. In this case, no
boundaries have to be set because the imported file contains all
periods. So the Calendar Span section is empty.
c) Define the display of the calendar periods to be rendered in the ana-
lytic from the Period Display section. For the Gregorian or custom
calendars, you can choose to display the first date of the end date
of the period. For example, for a monthly period, the analytic
shows the first date or the end date of the month.
d) Choose to show the period name (if the first row of the imported file
contains a header).
e) To choose the display format of the date, select a format from the
Format drop-down list.
253
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

7. When you’re done defining your calendar, click OK to build it.
Technically, each period of the calendar is being stored in the
Performance Manager repository. If your calendar contains a high
number of periods, computation can be long so this action may take
some time.
When the Add a Calendar dialog box closes and your new calendar is
added into the calendar list, you’ve built your calendar properly.
To define calendar properties for all calendars, click the Option button at the
top right of the calendar list to set the first day of the week, the first day of
the year, and weekends. Define those options at the beginning, before creat-
ing any calendars, because you won’t be able to modify them later once 
calendars exist with the previous definition.
When you have the measures, filters, fact date, dimensions, and calendars set
up, you’re ready to build a metric.
Creating a Metric
You can define three types of metrics: 
 Metric without a filter, such as the sum of sales by month, which has one
value per month.
 Metric filtered on a dimension, such as the sum of sales by month for
European area.
 Sliced metric, such as a sum of sales by month for each product line that
has one value by month and product line.
You can create a metric in two ways:
 Building a metric from a computation of your detailed corporate data
like sales volume or salary average stored in databases.
 Entering data manually to create an indicator from a macro and external
data like customer satisfaction, which contains one value by month
and doesn’t come from corporate IT systems but external surveys.

The three-step New Metric Wizard starts.
3. On the first screen of the wizard, choose a measure in the Select a
Measure drop-down list.
Selecting multiple measures creates multiple metrics based on those
measures with same characteristics.
When a measure in selected, the Select an Aggregation Function
becomes active.
4. Select an aggregation. If you want to create a sliced metric, select the
dimension as slicer from the Select a Dimension drop-down list.
You choose a dimension declared in the dimension area of the System
Setup application.
5. Click Next to go to the next screen.
The Filter screen appears.
6. Select a filter from the filter list. If you don’t want to set a filter for the
metric, choose None.
None is the default selected value.
You cannot create two different metrics with the same measure and the
same filter.
7. Click Next to go to the next screen.
The Attributes screen appears.
8. Fill in the metric name, description, and associate a calendar.
All calendars you defined in the setup application are available here.
9. Set the parameters of your metric:
• Refresh Type: Select Independent to refresh the metric from the
metric engine.
• Parameters: Set a trend for the metric from the Trend Is Good When
drop-down list to get predefined color-coding when you create ana-
lytics from it.
For example, you probably want to see the sales trend when the
value moves upward from one period to the next.
• Storage Options: Choose whether to store the complete metric his-
tory or only its last value. If you check the Store All Metric Values
radio button, define the metric history interval you want stored.
255
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

To change the default interval boundaries, change the start date
(set by default as the first date of the calendar) and check the Stop
Metric Calculation option and select an end date.
Check the Stop at Current Period checkbox to force the computa-
tion at the current period to avoid building empty periods until the
end of the calendar.
10. To populate your metric, click the Refresh button.
When the refresh is being performed, a dialog box appears, showing the
period being refreshed. When the metric refresh is done, the values of
the start date and last date have a gray background in the metric’s his-
tory (see Figure 17-5). (If the start and last date don’t have a gray back-
ground in your metric, you haven’t properly populated the metric. See
the “Finding errors” sidebar if this happens to you.)
Creating a metric manually
You can also create a metric by entering data manually. To do so, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Dashboard Manager tab of the Performance Management
Application.
The Metrics page opens. This is the page where you create your metric.
Figure 17-5:
A newly
created
metric,
showing its
properties.
256
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

2. Click Add and then New Manual Entry Metric.
The Create Metric Wizard opens with different options.
3. Fill in the name of your metric, a description, and a trend; then select
a calendar and fix the boundaries of the metric’s history.
4. Click Next.
The second screen displays the field to fill each period defined.
5. For each period defined during the calendar selection, enter the
metric value manually.
For instance, you can create a metric named My metric so that it
shows one value every 10 days from Nov 1 for the next 20 weeks, after
you define a custom calendar based on this time range. Figure 17-6
shows what that looks like in the user interface.
6. Click Finish.
257
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager
Finding errors
If a metric is not generated properly, it’s usually
because the SQL wasn’t generated properly.
This can happen as a result of incorrectly
defined objects in the universe(s) providing the
data, or incorrectly generated metadata in the
Performance Management repository.
To localize errors, you need to look at the gen-
erated SQL in the logs file. To activate the trace,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Setup application.
2. Click the Parameters tab.
3. Open the Trace page.
4. Choose the log file location by checking
Log to Folder and modifying the default
path if you want.
To define which trace you want to activate,
check whatever you want to trace in the
Select the Information to Log To and Enable
Logs to These Modules sections.
In the case of a metric, check the SQL
Queries and Metric Engine options.
In the Performance Management repository,
which is the Repository page of the System
Setup tab, the following tables are used most
often to generate SQL:
 ci_probe table contains a list of met-
rics definitions 
 ci_probe_value contains all values of
all metrics 
 ci_probe_dim contains a list of dimen-
sions values 
 ci_probe_dim_value contains the
metric values by dimension.

Creating a Goal
Knowing where your company is at any given time is pretty meaningless if
you don’t know where you want your company to be. Accordingly, when you
have your metric in place, your next step is to define a goal for the metric to
be based on.
To create a goal, follow these steps:
1. In the Performance Management application, from the Performance
Manager tab, select the Goals Management page. 
The Goal Management page displays a list of goals that already exist in
the repository.
2. Click the Add button.
The New Goal Wizard opens with the Name and Metric screen, as shown
in Figure 17-7.
3. Define a name and metric with which a goal is to be associated.
• Goal Info: Fill in the goal name. You can also give it a type to cate-
gorize your goal.
• Metric Info: By definition, a goal must be associated to a metric. To
set the associated metric, click the Select a Metric link to choose a
metric from the list of all the metrics stored in the repository.
Figure 17-6:
Creating a
metric using
manual
entries.
258
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

• Goal Span: Depending on the metric selected, adjust the goal
boundaries using the metric-based calendar.
4. Click Next.
5. On the Auto-fill and Tolerance screen (shown in Figure 17-8), define
the way the goal values will be generated and a tolerance on which
the metric status will be calculated.

Edit Wizard.

259
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

You can choose from four auto-fill methods: 
• Constant Value: Use this method if your goal will always have the
same value over time. In this case, you can set a constant or define
this value from one of the metric values for a given period. Constant
values are especially useful with an On-Target trend.
• Period to Period Change: This option increments the goal with a
fixed value from one period to the next. You can either define the
value for the first period and the last value of the goal — the incre-
ment is defined automatically, according to the number of periods
you set — or you can define the value for the first period and set
an explicit increment. You can fill in a constant or define your
desired values from the metric’s history. The goal of the period N is
defined by Gn=G(n-1)+(constant).
• Period to Period % Change: This option uses a fixed percentage of
the goal value (in comparison with the previous goal value) as the
increment. In this case, the line isn’t straight but an exponential
curve. The goal of the period N is defined by 
Gn=G(n-1)*(1+constant/100).
• Year to Year Change and Year to Year % Change: These options use
a fixed value or a fixed percent of the goal value (in comparison
with the value of the same period from the previous year) as the
increment. These methods are especially useful if you’re monitor-
ing indicators that follow seasonal trends.
You can also define tolerance in three zones (based on the goal value) if
you overshoot the expectation, meet the expectation, or don’t meet the
expectation. Tolerance boundaries can be based, for each goal value, on
constants or percentages of the goal value.
6. Click Next.
The Edit Values screen (shown in Figure 17-9) shows goal values gener-
ated for all periods, according to the auto-fill rules you set up in Step 5.
7. (Optional) If you want to modify some of the goals values for some
specific periods, check the Manual Entry radio button. 
Goal values of each period then become editable, so you can modify any
one you want.
8. Click Finish to compute your new goal and close the wizard.
The goal is created; you can visualize it in the analytic in the right panel
of the page. 
Figure 17-10 shows an analytic with two curves: the regular one display-
ing the goal values and the second one displaying the metric values.

When you select a goal in the left list, the corresponding goal analytic is dis-
played on the right with this default rendering.
You can modify the analytic, save it in the repository, or add it to your per-
sonal or corporate dashboard.

Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

Creating a Metric-Based Analytic
When you have a metric and a goal, you can now use them to create an ana-
lytic. In the following section, we show you how to create three of the more
popular analytics: the Interactive Metric Trend, the Metric tree, and the
Strategy Map.
Interactive Metric Trend
One of the most-used analytics is the Interactive Metric Trend. It offers pow-
erful interactivity and visualization capabilities that allow you to analyze a
metric over time. 
To create an Interactive Metric Trend analytic and examine the result, follow
these steps:
1. In the Performance Management application, click the Dashboard
Manager tab, and then, from the toolbar, select the Create New
Analytic link.
2. From the metric template list, select the Interactive Metric Trend 
analytic.
The analytic template opens in Edit mode, as shown in Figure 17-11.
3. Choose which data to display from the Select Data to Display drop-
down list:
• Performance Data: Defines a list of metrics to display in the ana-
lytic. This is the default.
• Top Metric: Sets a top of metrics to display according to their varia-
tion from the last period.
Figure 17-11:
Interactive
Metric Trend
properties,
shown in
Edit mode.
262
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

• Set Data: Relates to the Set Analysis module. The Set Analysis tool,
which enables you to study population segmentation, requires a
separate license and is beyond the scope of this book.
• Goal Only: Selects the goals to display.
• Universe Query: Defines data from a universe.
4. From the empty list, click the Add button. 
The Add a Metric dialog box displays a list of available metrics. They are
listed according to the universe class on which the source measure is
based.
For example, the Metric class lists all metrics of this class, whether fil-
tered or sliced.
5. Select your metrics and click OK.
You can select several metrics by Shift+clicking.
The metric you have selected is added. 
6. For each metric, set characteristics:
• For a sliced metric, you can specify slices to display in the analytic.
Select a sliced metric, click the Slices button, and set values for the
metric (as shown in Figure 17-12).
• To define the color of each metric in the chart, click the Color
button. 
• To allow the user to select a metric directly from the analytic, click
the Add a Prompt button (the one with the ?). 
Figure 17-12:
Slicer
choice.
263
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

7. From the Time Window drop-down list, select a specific time range. 
The default range is All Time Values for Which Metrics Are Computed.
8. (Optional) In the Graph and Legend section, specify the rendering
characteristics:
Metric Type: Here you can define how the data is displayed:
• Raw shows the metric values for each period.
• % of Origin and % of Change of Origin show, as a percentage, the
comparison between the metric value and its initial value for each
period.
• Change and % Change show the variation in the value and as a per-
centage from one period to the next.
• Cumulative Sum shows, for each period, the metric value added to
the values of all values of previous periods.
• Month to Date, Quarter to Date, and Year to Date show the variation
from the beginning of the period.
Compare To: Select From Previous Year to display a curve for the last year
and a curve for the previous year, to compare data of both years for the
same period (the same time axis is used for both curves in this case).
Chart Type: Select the type of chart of the analytic. Stacked bars are
useful to display sliced metrics. 
Specifying any rendering characteristics is optional because you can
also let the user select the type of display dynamically according to the
type of analysis being performed from within the analytic itself.
When you’re viewing the analytic, you can hide the comparison from the
previous year by toggling the Show/Hide Comparison button. 
9. From the Navigation and Legend Options section, set links from the
title, legend, and data point of a chart. 
For example, you can define from the chart line a sum of profit
metric, and link to a report that includes profit detailed data. If this
report has a date prompt, you can set link a URL as a parameter on the
date. The report displays data for this time range, according to the time
period that the user selects on the graph.
The sidebar “Linking to another document from an analytic” has more
details on setting links.
10. From the Customize Columns section, define the information to dis-
play in the analytic table.
264
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

11. From the Customize Tooltip section, define any information to display
in the tooltip,
12. Check the Display Mode option to define the level of the analytic
interactivity.
13. Click OK to set those options and open the analytic.
By default, you can visualize one line per metric for the entire time range.
The table below the chart shows information about the metric: color coding,
trend, first and end values, the previous-period value, and so on.
For example, Figure 17-13 shows an analytic that contains three metrics: sum
of profit, net sales sliced by regions, and net sales sliced by product line.
For the two sliced metrics, the analytic displays by default the value for all the
slices. The value of net sales by product line is not shown, because this is 
the same line as net sales by region. 
265
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager
Linking to another document from an analytic
To include a link to another link from your ana-
lytic, click the Browse button and select a doc-
ument from the list. To have something more
dynamic, you can use some parameters. For
example, in an interactive analytic that shows a
metric’s trend in terms of the date, the metric,
and even the slice, you may want to open a dif-
ferent document.
The syntax that does this job looks like this:
“/apps/jsp/openAnalytic.jsp?
RepositoryName=Document&
RepositoryType=C&Document
Ext=rep&DocumentName=The
Doc&nbPrompts=x&Prompt1=
value1&Prompt2=value2 “
where
 RepositoryName: The domain where
you have saved the analytic
 RepositoryType: C for corporate and
P for personal
 DocumentExt: Document suffix, REP for
Full Client, WID for WEBI and AFD for 
analytic
 DocumentName: The document that you
wish to display
To pass prompts you need to add the following
extension syntax: -&nbPrompts=x&Prompt
1=value1&Prompt2=value2 and so on
With this syntax, you can use the following vari-
ables: $METRIC_NAME$, $SLICE_CODE$,
$SLICE_NAME$, $BEGIN_DATE$, $END_
DATE$, $CURRENT_DATE$.
For more information, see http://www.
forumtopics.com/busobj/
viewtopic.php?t=41556.

When you have your analytic, you can change the way it’s displayed:
 Hide metrics: To hide a metric, click the Color symbol of this metric in
the table. To hide all metrics except one, select the metric you want to
keep and click the Show Selected Metric Only button.
 Remove metrics from the analytic: Select them and click the Trash Bin
button.
 See values for each slice of a sliced metric: Click the small arrow before
the sliced metric name and you get one line per slice. You can also hide
some selected slices.
In Figure 17-14, the lines show the values of the Net Sales M by region:
Asia-PAC, Central South America, EMEA, Europe, and North
America.
 Improve visibility: Click the Legend button to display the legend.

 Reduce the time range: By default the analytic shows the entire periods
of the metric. To reduce the entire period from the beginning, move the
slider from the first period to the period you want to set as the first
period. To reduce the entire period from the end, move the slider, and
repeat the step but from the last period of the slider.
 Change the chart style: Click the arrow in the Change Style button (the
first button on the left behind the chart). From the pop-up menu, select
one of the four styles: Line, Bar, Stacked Bar, and Stacked Bar
Percentage.
 Change the scale and the metric type: Change the type from the Metric
Type drop-down list. For example, if you select the Percent of Origin
View, you can compare the trend of each metric (see Figure 17-15).
 Visualize the trend quarter by quarter: Select Quarter to Date from the
Metric Type drop-down list. Figure 17-16 shows the Net sales trend for
each region from periods of the same quarter.
Metric Tree
Another interesting analytic that’s based on a metric is the Metric Tree.
The Metric Tree analytic presents metrics — and relationships between 
metrics — as a tree view. The top levels of the tree represent high-
level metrics — for instance, strategic metrics for the whole company. 
From the top, the Metric Tree can branch by domain; each domain can

Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

have several branches, and so on until you get to the leaf level that repre-
sents metrics for more detailed scope. This kind of visualization shows at a
glance which lower-level data explains the results of a higher level. Causes
and effects become clearer.
The Net Sales Metric Tree that comes with BusinessObjects (shown in 
Figure 17-17) has only two levels: The worldwide net sales at top level, which
is then broken down for each world region. Displaying metrics information,
this analytic shows the following:
 The yellow worldwide status, even if the trend is good, can be explained
by the bad performance of Asia PAC, which is below objectives. 
 The symbol representing status shows that the goals have been associ-
ated to metrics. 
 The status color is the difference between the expected and the
achieved values. 
 To get details of each item, a link to a detailed report has been defined
as a part of the Metric Tree’s definition. The document symbol indicates
a link is available; click the symbol to open the document.
To create a Metric Tree, follow these steps:
1. From the Dashboard Manager application, click the Metric Tree link.
2. Click the Add button.
The Create Metric Tree dialog box opens. 
3. Drag and drop metrics from the left list into the right panel divided
into several levels.
Figure 17-17:
The Net
Sales
Metric Tree.
268
Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

4. Define branches between each metric by clicking from a metric to the
other one.
5. Add the Metric Tree to a dashboard, customize the dashboard, and
select the Metric Tree template from the New Analytic drop-down list.
The template opens in edit mode.
6. Select a Metric Tree, and define the rendering.
To define the rendering, you add a title, a background image, links to
documents, the data you want to display in tooltips, the data you want
to display in each metric container, the unfolded levels, and the number
of levels per page.
Figure 17-18 shows a metric tree that represents the gross margin at the higher
level that is divided into two branches: one for cost and one for gross sales.
Each of them is divided by product lines.
Strategy Map
A Strategy Map has two axes: the high-level goals and the cause-and-effect
relationships between them. Clicking an object on a Strategy Map allows you
to analyze any causes and effects related to this object.
In contrast to the Metric Tree, the Strategy Map analytic is based on goals,
and the ways of building links between goals are completely free. They don’t
require any tree view organization.
To look at the Strategy Map that comes with BusinessObjects (shown in
Figure 17-19), choose the Performance Manager tab, open the Performance
Manager Analytics page, and then open the Strategy Map analytic.
Figure 17-18:
The 
Metric Tree.
269
Chapter 17: Using Performance Manager

This analytic gives an example of the implementation of a BI application based
on the Balanced Scorecard method, which uses the Strategy Map analytic.
Balanced Scorecard is a management system that enables an organization to
clarify its vision and strategy and translate these relatively abstract things
into action (for more information, go to www.balancedscorecard.org).
The balanced scorecard allows you to view the organization from four per-
spectives that shape corporate strategy: Financial, Customer, Internal, and
Learning & Growth. Implementing the balanced scorecard requires the trans-
lation of the vision into operational goals, which means you define goals for
each perspective indicators.
This Strategy Map provides a view of those four perspectives. For each of
them, strategic goals based on metrics are defined; you can view them
through a series of boxes — linked between them and linked in depth to more
detailed information — similar to a Metric Tree, WebI documents, and analyt-
ics. In this way, the Strategy Map can support a cascading application that
requires the Balanced Scorecard implementation.
To create a strategy map and include it in a dashboard, follow these steps:
1. In the Performance Management application, click the Dashboard
Manager tab, and then, from the toolbar, select the Create New
Analytic link.
Figure 17-19:

Part V: Keeping Track of How Your Organization Is Doing 

2. Drag and drop the strategy map template into your dashboard. 
The template is added into your dashboard, and you can now edit it to
build your analytic.
3. Drag and drop goals from the left list to the right panel to design your
strategy map.
4. To define relationship between goals, add arrows by selection from a
goal to another one.
5. Click the Add Item link and add text for your strategy map.
6. Click the Add Help Item link and to add help items.
7. Click on the Options link to customize the rendering.
8. Define the properties in the Graph Properties section:
• To change the shape of a goal’s boxes, select a shape from the
options available in the Box Outline list box.
• To modify the size of a goal’s boxes, set a value in the Box Width box.
• To add a background image from the server directory, check the
Show a Background Image check box and enter the path to where
the image is stored in the field. Images must be set in the images
directory of the application.
• To define the icons places, select a value from the Display Icon on
List box.
• To define links to metric trees or corporate documents, click Attach
an Analytic to Each Goal and click Browse or Multiple Links to add
documents from InfoView’s list of documents.
9. From the Box Content section, define data to be displayed in the goal
boxes:
• To choose goals, click the Add button to open the Customize View
dialog box. Select the goals you want to display from the corporate
list of goals and click OK. The selected goals are now displayed in
the Box Content Section box.
• To order your goals, click the Move Up and Move Down buttons on
the top right of the List of Goals box to set their order in goal boxes.
10. Define what you want to be displayed in the tooltip in the Box Tooltip
section:
• To customize the view, click the Add button to open the Customize
View dialog box. Select characteristics relative to the goals selected
from the list and then click OK. The selected indicators are now
displayed in the Box Tooltip Section list box.
• To change the order of the goals, click the Move Up and Move Down
buttons at the top right of the list of Goals Indicators list to set
their order in the tooltips.

11. To define the time period to display, use the Time Window section:
• To display the last period, check the radio button with the same
name.
• To display another period, check the Select Specific Period radio
button and use the calendar to select a period. Don’t forget that
the metric goal is based on a calendar so select a period within the
calendar.

Getting the Best
Possible Data 
with Data Marts

In this part. . .
T
his part provides a brief introduction to the world of
data marts, a specialized kind of data warehouse that
allows you to ensure the data you use to build your reports
is as accurate, up-to-date and auditable as possible.
Chapter 18 takes a look at Data Integrator, the Business-
Objects tool that helps you prepare and integrate your
data in a data mart or data warehouse for use with
BusinessObjects.
In Chapter 19, we go on to examine where data warehouses
(and data marts in particular) fit in to your BusinessObjects
system.

Chapter 18
Putting Data Integrator 
to Work for You
In This Chapter

B
usinessObjects is a tool for more than just creating reports and sharing
them among your work buddies. At the end of the data, BusinessObjects
is all about data — how to access it, how to work with it, and how to make it
count. Of course, it’s not all glamour! Someone’s got to get down and dirty so
your “report in a couple of mouse clicks” is feasible!
To that end, BusinessObjects uses a data warehouse to store its data for you
to access. It’s literally the primary repository that your organization uses to
store raw data. As discussed in earlier chapters, you can go data mining,
which is just a fancy way of saying that you’re going to dig in and perform
some important analysis using BusinessObjects!
BusinessObjects uses the CMS repository to store its metadata (universe,
security, documents); it doesn’t use any data warehouse to store it. It can use
a data warehouse or any production database to query data and make useful
reports. The data you eventually use in your universes — all pulled from the
data warehouse — has to get there somehow! It doesn’t just happen overnight!
Data can come from different sources; for example, HR data might come from
PeopleSoft, while stock files may come from your production database.
BusinessObjects has a different tool, called Data Integrator, that is designed
to help you prepare and integrate your data into any kind of data warehouse
so it can be used in BusinessObjects.
You most likely don’t need to worry about the Data Integrator if you’re a
beginning BusinessObjects user. Asking a novice BusinessObjects user to be
responsible for preparing data is like asking a surgeon in residency to per-
form open-heart surgery in the first week!

Figuring Out Data Integrator
Admittedly, Data Integrator can be difficult to understand simply because it’s
several applications or components rolled into one! If you want to find out
about each part of the Data Integrator application, we recommend consulting
the Data Integrator Core Tutorial guide, which is available from
BusinessObjects.
It’s still important to understand what this helpful tool is — an essential part
of the data-mart concept — and how it works. In this section, we discuss 
the three applications you’re most likely to use: Repository Manager, Data
Integrator Designer, and Data Integrator Web Administrator.
What is the Repository Manager?
The Repository Manager has but one purpose in life: to help you set up your
Data Integrator repository.
The Data Integrator repository is different from your CMS repository.
There is some business to be dealt with before you can create your Data
Integrator repository. For starters, you need a database account with some
basic rights. Your organization’s database administrator (DBA) can provide
you with this information. 
Do not use the MySQL database provided in the BusinessObjects XI Release 
2 setup. If you used the default setup configuration, it would have been for
naught as MySQL is not a supported repository in Data Integrator.
After you have your database account, as well as the database connection
parameters, you can launch the Data Integrator Repository Manager. Flip
ahead to the “Getting on to Designer and getting started” section, to find out
how to do so.
What is the Data Integrator Designer?
The Data Integrator Designer — shown in Figure 18-1 — is probably the clos-
est thing to an actual end-user Data Integrator application. The Designer is
designed to work with jobs in the data warehouse. For example, you could
envision creating and configuring objects or even data mappings (for exam-
ple, workflows) for your application.
276
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

Most frequently, you create flows that illustrate ETL (Extraction, Transfor-
mation, and Loading) — the process of extracting raw data from its original
source, transforming it into usable data, and then loading it into your data-
base or data warehouse for use with BusinessObjects.
To get your flow to (ahem) flow, you create jobs and projects. We discuss
both of these concepts, as well as how to create them in the “Getting the
Hang of Data Integrator Designer” section later in this chapter.
What is the Data Integrator 
Web Administrator?
Like BusinessObjects itself, Data Integrator has a Web-based administrator
panel that allows you to manage everything related to it. This panel is to Data
Integrator what the Central Management Console (CMC) is to BusinessObjects
Enterprise.
The Web Administrator application, as shown in Figure 18-2, is really for
advanced users who are comfortable with Data Integrator and working with
jobs, repositories, and such tasks as working with batch jobs, services, users,
and adapters. 
The Data Integrator Web Administrator is a completely separate application
from Data Integrator!

Before you start working with the Data Integrator Designer, it’s important to
understand the two key concepts around which Data Integrator Designer
evolves: 
 The project: You can create objects, and one such object is a project.
This entity is where you store your jobs for organizational purposes.
Projects are single-user objects; you can’t share them with any other
user in your organization, and you can only work with a single project 
at a time. If you’re the multitasking type, sorry, it’s just not possible 
with projects. 
 The job: A job is also an object; one which you can execute or run. Jobs
can be as complex or as simple as you like, but it’s best to try to keep
them from becoming too complex. When creating a flow, you’ll create
several steps using icons (connected objects) to create a job diagram.
What we cover in this section won’t make you an instant expert on Data
Integrator Designer, but it does give you a good idea of how to get started
using the application effectively.
Getting on to Designer and getting started
Getting on to Data Integrator Designer isn’t as easy as clicking a menu item
and digging right in. In fact, you have to perform a number of perfunctory
steps before you can even launch Data Integrator Designer!

First, you set up your repository. And then you can log on to Designer.
Setting up your repository
Though you probably created a repository when you installed Data Integrator,
you can always create another one. This repository is saved in your database
account (see your database administrator). The Data Integrator repository is
created in a database; for more information, see the “What is the Repository
Manager?” section earlier in this chapter.
To create a repository, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects Data Integrator 11.5➪
Repository Manager.
The Repository Manager window opens, as shown in Figure 18-3.
2. Enter the information for each field:
• Database Type: This drop-down list lets you set the type of data-
base you are using, for example, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2.
• Database Server Name: This is the name of the server that hosts
your database.
• Database Name: This is the name of the database being hosted by
the database server.
• User Name: This is the login for your database account.
• Password: This is the password for your database account login.
This information is found in your database account provided by your
organization’s database administrator.

Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

3. Click Create.
The status of the repository is displayed at the bottom of the Repository
Manager.
4. Click Close.
Logging in
After you create a local repository, you can log on to Data Integrator. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects Data Integrator 11.5➪
Data Integrator Designer.
The Data Integrator login window opens, as shown in Figure 18-4.
2. Select the database type from the Database Type drop-down list; then
enter the database server name and database name. 
3. Identify yourself using the credentials you established creating your
Data Integrator repository (database account) in the Repository
Manager.
4. Click OK.
This, of course, presumes that your database is up and running! Simply creat-
ing the repository isn’t enough. After you’re logged on, you can use the Data
Integrator Designer to start working with your objects, including projects and
jobs.

Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

The Data Integrator Designer can be broken into several different pieces. The
left side is divided into two different windows or panes. The majority of the
screen includes the work area. The top window contains three tabs: Designer,
Monitor, and Log. The bottom window concerns the repository and its work-
flow. This window contains a number of tabs, most of which you will not use.
We discuss the more important ones in the following sections.
Creating jobs for your project
After you log onto your repository, it’s now time to start working with your
objects. Before you start creating jobs, you need a place to store them. Any
ideas? How about in a new project? Actually, all objects are physically stored
in the database to which you are connected!
Even if you can put a job in any project, you may want to use an existing pro-
ject and add a new job to it, or start fresh and create your very own project.
To create a new project, follow these steps:
1. Choose Project➪New in Data Integrator Designer.
If you want to add a new job to an existing project, choose Project➪Open.
2. Choose whether you want to create a new job within the project area
of Data Integration Designer or in the object library:
• If you want to create a new job in the project area, continue with
Steps 3 and 4.
• If you want to create a new job in the object library, skip to 
Steps 5–8.
3. To create a new job in the project area, right-click and select the type
of job you wish to create. 
4. Enter a name for your new job.
Blank spaces and hyphens are not allowed. You can use numbers, letters,
and underscores for naming jobs.
5. To create a new job from the object library, click the Jobs tab. 
6. Right-click either Batch Jobs or Real Time Jobs and select New to
start creating a new job, as shown in Figure 18-5. 
7. Edit the name. 
8. (Optional) Drag your new job from the object library to the project
area if you want to include it.

Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

Creating workflows
With a basic knowledge of projects and jobs in your head, you can create a
workflow. If you’ve ever worked with a diagramming application such as
Microsoft Visio, then you’re probably familiar with workflows.
If you’re not familiar with workflows, here’s the gist: They are roadmaps that
detail the logic and thought process for executing your data. These are
important documents because they allow you to study your system and make
sure your planned executions are properly laid out. If necessary, you can
always call another workflow into your current workflow — or even have it
call itself for use in the same workflow (confusing but effective). There are
very few limitations to workflow usage!
Workflows are graphic-oriented documents that use icons as part of the work-
flow diagram (see Figure 18-6). When reading a workflow, remember that
everything is in its proper place for a reason. These should be read left-to-
right because that’s the way that workflows are executed. Each box has a
single entry point and a single exit point. You can connect an exit point with
only one entry point and one entry point is connected with only one exit
point. To read the flow, follow the line.
You can create a workflow in Data Integrator Designer in two ways: either from
the tool palette or the object library. Keep in mind that a workflow is an inde-
pendent entity. You can create it from the object library but then it is only 
created — you need to insert it into a job by dragging it in the Job diagram.
Figure 18-5:

282
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

From the object library
To create a workflow from the object library, follow these steps:
1. Click the Workflow tab at the bottom of the object library, as shown in
Figure 18-7.
2. Right-click anywhere in the tab and select New.
The job diagram opens. 
3. Drag your new workflow to the diagram.
4. Add any other information, such as data flows and conditionals.
See the nearby sidebar “Expanding your workflow” for more about data
flows and conditionals.

Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

From the tool palette
To create a new workflow from the tool palette, follow these steps. 
1. Click the Workflow tab at the bottom of the object library (refer to
Figure 18-7).
2. Right-click anywhere in the tab and select New.
The job diagram opens. 
3. In the tool palette, select the Workflow icon, as shown in Figure 18-8.
4. Click the area where you want to create your workflow.
5. Right-click anywhere in your workflow and choose Properties. 
The Properties window opens, as shown in Figure 18-9.
6. To allow your workflow to execute one time, check the Execute Only
Once option. If you want your workflow to re-execute if the execution
fails for any reason, leave the option unchecked.
However, should your workflow be successful, it won’t re-execute. 
We don’t recommend enabling the feature if the workflow is a recovery
unit.
7. Click OK.
Jobs contain workflows, each workflow contains dataflows and conditionals.
Each dataflow contains transformations. These require the knowledge of SQL,
so if you’re interested, we recommend picking up SQL For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Allen Taylor.

Playing Administrator 
with Data Integrator
As you probably guessed, the Data Integrator Web Administrator application
is the brains of the operation. As with the Central Management Console, the
Administrator is a Web-based application — you can use it on any computer
connected to the Web, not just one that has Data Integrator installed.
Figure 18-9:
The
Properties
dialog box
for your
workflow.
285
Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You
Expanding your workflow
As we’ve mentioned in this chapter, you most
likely won’t need to master the creation of work-
flows. If you’re curious, however, you can con-
tinue your research with workflows. For example,
you may want to get a handle on these concepts:
 Conditionals: These are individual objects
that use IF/THEN/ELSE statements in a
workflow. To set up a conditional, you must
designate a condition and two logical
branches.
 While loops: This is used to repeat a series
of steps within your workflow. The only
requirement is that the condition is true.
 TRY/CATCH blocks: This is not an offered
option, but rather a combination of objects
(one is a try object, the other is a catch
object) providing a backup workflow in case
yours doesn’t work.
 Scripts: These are individual objects that set
values for variables or call functions within
your workflow.

The Data Integrator Web Administrator is the central location where you can
handle managerial tasks such as setting up users and roles, scheduling batch
jobs to be executed, and working with Access Servers and Job Servers. Of
course, this tool can handle plenty more tasks, but we just want to get you
familiar with the application for now. (Expertise comes later.)
Logging on
Even though Data Integrator Web Administrator is a Web-based application,
you can still access it from the Start menu. Before you try and log on, you
should take a quick look and make sure that the Data Integrator Web Server
service is on. If the service isn’t on, turn it on — otherwise you’ll never
manage to get in. To do that, choose Start➪Control Panel➪Administrative
Tools➪Services➪Data Integrator Web Server. If the entry is set to Stopped,
right-click the service name and select Start.
Don’t forget that as with any Web application, you can connect to it from any
machine that is on your server. To log on to Data Integrator Web
Administrator, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪BusinessObjects Data Integrator➪
Web Administrator.
2. Enter the user name and password.
If you don’t have a user name or password, you can use the default
logon and password, which is pretty simple: admin/admin.
3. Click Log In.
The Data Integrator Web Administrator appears, as shown in Figure 18-10.
Figure 18-10:

286
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

Adding repositories
Adding a repository to the Data Integrator Web Administrator is one of the
first things you’ll do once you’re up and running. Sure, you may want to rush
ahead and start scheduling jobs, but you need to add a repository connec-
tion in order to even see the jobs you have!
You can add a repository through the List of Repositories page in the Web
Administrator. This applies to any kind of repository — local, central, or 
profiler.
To add a repository connection, follow these steps:
1. In Data Integrator Web Administrator, use the navigation tree to locate
Management➪Repositories.
2. Click Add.
The page to enter your repository information appears, as shown in
Figure 18-11.
3. Add the necessary information:
• Repository Name: The name of the repository that you created.
• Database Type: Select the type of database, for example, Oracle,
DB2, SQL.
• Windows Authentication: Check this box to apply Windows
Authentication for validating your logon. 
Figure 18-11:
The Add
Repository
Connection
data.
287
Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

• Machine Name: This lets you enter the name of the machine host-
ing your repository.
• Database Port: This is the port number for the database on your
machine.
• Database Name: This is the name of the database on your machine.
• User Name: This is the name of the login for your repository.
• Password: This is the password for your repository login.
4. (Optional) Click Test to verify that your connection works.
5. Click Apply.
Your repository connection appears in the List of Repositories, as
shown in Figure 18-12.
Setting up a repository
Setting up a repository depends on how your database is set up, which goes
beyond the scope of this book. This can be a pretty complicated procedure,
especially if you’re not used to working with databases.
For example, if you are using a SQL Server database, you need to know how
to work with MS SQL Server Management Studio Express in order to create
and set up your database. (See Microsoft SQL Server 2008 For Dummies for
more help with SQL Server). We use MS SQL in this book as it is arguably the
easiest type of database to work with, and the kind that you are most likely to
use in a small to medium sized deployment. If you are using BusinessObjects
in an enterprise setting, you likely all ready have the requisite database
knowledge.
Figure 18-12:
The new
repository
connection
in the List of
Repositories.
288
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

The central repository should be a secured central repository. When you’re
creating the repository with the Data Integrator Repository Manager, check
the Enable Security checkbox. Users can connect to the central repository
using the Data Integrator Designer. You must activate the repository before
anyone can use it by filling in the user settings in the Central Repository
Editor.
Accessing your repository
If you are using MS SQL Server, there are two different ways to access your
repository. If you are using Windows Authentication, you can do it via ODBC
DSN (Start➪Administrative Tools➪Data Sources (ODBC) and create your
data-source connection). Enter your ODBC DSN name in the repository con-
nection. If you are not using Windows Authentication, but rather Enterprise
SQL Server Authentication, enter your database connection parameter in the
interface and no ODBC DSN is required.
Managing your roles
Data Integrator Web Administrator allows you to create users and roles for
use with Data Integrator. The process is similar to creating users and roles in
the CMC with InfoView. Note that these users and roles are not used within
Data Integrator Designer; they are used to log in the Administration console
and in the report metadata tool, which is accessible using Data Integrator
Designer.
Roles set boundaries and permissions for users so you can protect your
system from inadvertent changes or other “accidents” caused by unautho-
rized access.
To create a user account and assign a role, follow these steps:
1. In Data Integrator Web Administrator, choose Management➪Users.
The User Management page appears, as shown in Figure 18-13.
2. Click Add.
3. Enter a new user ID in the corresponding text box.
4. Enter a password for the user name.
5. Set a display name for the user.
This could be a full name or nickname that makes recognizing the log
easier for you.
289
Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

6. Select a role from the Role drop-down menu (as shown in Figure 18-14).
7. Set the current state of the new account, for example, active or 
suspended.
8. Go to the Profiler repository list and select the desired profiler reposi-
tory for your users.
9. Click Apply.
Working with users and groups
You can use Data Integrator Web Administrator to add groups and users
through a central repository. To do that, first you add a central repository.
(We discuss adding a repository connection earlier in this chapter, in the
“Adding repositories” section.)
When you have a central repository, follow these steps to add a group:
1. In Data Integrator Web Administrator, expand the Central Repositories
menu in the hierarchical tree.

290
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

2. Click Users and Groups; make sure you’re on the Groups tab.
3. Click Add.
4. Enter a name for your new group.
Choose a name that will be largely self-evident to all users who work
with your groups.
5. Add a brief description of your group name in the Description 
text box.
6. Click Apply.
Your group now appears in the list of Groups in the Groups tab.
To add a user account, follow these steps:
1. In Data Integrator Web Administrator, expand the Central Repositories
menu in the hierarchical tree.
2. Click Users and Groups; make sure you’re on the Users tab.
3. Click Add.
4. Enter the requested information, such as a user name, password, dis-
play name, default groups, status, and so on (as shown Figure 18-15).
The user name is the name of the user to be used with Web Administrator,
while its display name is the name that you will actually see when
logged in. The password is for logging in. Default groups are the initial
groups that the user is affiliated with by default. The status shows the
current state of the user.
Even though it is optional, be sure to add a password for the user
account, otherwise the user cannot connect through the Data Integrator
Designer application to the central repository. Even though the interface
allows you to keep an empty password, the system really doesn’t like
that too much.

Chapter 18: Putting Data Integrator to Work for You

5. Click Apply.
The new user account appears in the Data Integrator Web Administrator,
showing the new user as a member of the list, as shown in Figure 18-16.
Scheduling batch jobs
When you create a scheduled event, you’re actually using the Job Server
(another component of Data Integrator). Therefore, in this section, we cover
the easiest way to schedule an event. In addition, if you need to schedule a
batch job, you can do so using third-party schedules and the Data Integrator
job launcher.
To create a scheduled batch job in the Web Administrator, follow these steps:
1. Choose Data Integrator➪Batch and then select the repository.
2. Open the Configuration tab.
3. Select the job that you want to schedule and choose Action➪Add
Schedule.
4. Configure your job schedule.
5. Click Schedule.

Working with Data Marts
In This Chapter
 Getting smart about data marts
 Speeding up with BusinessObjects Rapid Marts
B
ack in the good old days, the first data warehouses (the ancestors of
today’s data marts) were heralded as a wonder solution, set to usher in
a glorious new age in which everyone in an enterprise would have all the data
they could ever need right at their fingertips — and all at exactly the same
time, thus ensuring that a company’s whole workforce would all be on the
same page . . . and all would be well in the world.
Well, as we know, it didn’t quite work out like that!
A data mart is a specialized kind of data warehouse that’s been around since
at least the 1980s. However, in the current business environment — where
having credible and trustworthy data has moved beyond being an opera-
tional advantage to become a legislative requirement for many — the
improved data quality that data marts help provide is more relevant today
than ever before.
This chapter takes a brief look at how data marts fit into your BusinessObjects
system — and how they enable you to ensure that you always have the most
accurate, up-to-date and auditable information available.
Choosing Between a Data Warehouse
and a Data Mart
In truth, data warehouses are good to have: Everyone having access to the
same data — all of it as accurate and up-to-date as possible — can only be a
good thing, right?

In practice, data warehouses had a tendency to become somewhat unwieldy
behemoths, packed so full of data — everything you ever wanted to know
about absolutely anything to do with your company (but were afraid to ask) —
that they quickly proved impossible to manage. Indeed, if you’ve ever had the
misfortune of having to search for information stored away in the dark, dingy
corners of a data warehouse, needles and haystacks are two words that may
well spring to mind when you’re describing the experience.
A data mart, in its contemporary form, provides a snapshot of the data in a
database at any given time. Where data marts differ from the larger, more
unwieldy data warehouses is that they focus solely on meeting a previously
identified need for a specific subset of data.
It soon became apparent to the creators and administrators of enormous data
warehouses that — much to their surprise — not everyone needed to know
everything about everything. Most users, as it turns out, only need access to
specific subsets of data. The sales team doesn’t always need to keep track of
company head count, for instance; a Human Resources manager may not be
interested in the current levels of stock at the production plant.
So why not just tell people what they need to know? That, in theory, is the
job of the data mart.
If extracting information from a data warehouse is like scanning over the
aisles of an entire supermarket with a security camera, imagine a data mart
as being like a camera trained on a single aisle — or even a single shelf — 
and sending you time-stamped photographs of that aisle at regular intervals.
Which of these two methods do you think would be more effective as a
means of stock control?
Although its narrow focus gives a data mart a big advantage — namely, that
you can be sure the information it contains is relevant to the subject at hand —
this information (say, the time-stamped photograph in our example) may not
be completely up to date. After all, it’s a snapshot rather than a live stream of
data. Performance issues dictate how, and how often, your data is updated.
Figure 19-1 shows the relationship of a typical data warehouse and data mart.
The data warehouse versus data mart debate has two main schools of thought.
One proposes that data marts should be created first and then joined together
to create a data warehouse; the other thinks that the data warehouse should
come first and then be broken down into smaller units. 
We take a look at each approach in the following sections. Both have advan-
tages and disadvantages; your company’s circumstances dictate which is
most appropriate for you.
294
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

Starting with data marts
The so-called Kimball School proposes a bottom-up approach: A data ware-
house is nothing more than a series of small data marts grouped together
into one larger whole.
The advantage of this bottom-up approach is that it is much quicker to imple-
ment in the first instance because it allows you to start small and grow 
incrementally.
The disadvantage of stringing together data marts is that you have to take
care of metadata consistency (making sure that each department calls a spade
a spade and all have consistent terminology) or it can lead to integration
problems further down the line.
This approach works best when you want to focus on individual business
processes or business groups as separate entities.
Starting with a warehouse
The Inmon School believes that a top-down approach is best: Deal with meta-
data consistency problems first by conceiving the data warehouse as a single
repository that feeds the separate data marts.

Chapter 19: Working with Data Marts

The advantages of a top-down approach are
 It makes it easier to handle data that is common across different business
groups.
 Taking care of metadata consistency up front helps prevent unexpected
integration issues later on.
However, breaking down a data warehouse into data marts is not without its
disadvantages:
 Doing everything from the start obviously requires a much greater finan-
cial investment.
 The time it takes to implement may not be acceptable to many enterprises
in today’s fast-moving business world.
If you can afford the time and cost involved, a top-down approach to manag-
ing data is best if you want to focus on the bigger picture, and if there is a
sizeable amount of data that is common across different business groups.
BusinessObjects Rapid Marts
Clearly, any tool or system that deals with data cannot exist in a vacuum: The
data has to come from somewhere — preferably fast.
The data you want to query, report on, and analyze most likely already exists
somewhere in your company, be it stored in an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system such as
the SAP R/3 and SAP BW, PeopleSoft, and J.D. Edwards applications commonly
used in many organizations.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are designed to unify an organiza-
tion’s data and processes into a single, integrated system. An example of
such a system could be a software package that combines accounting, pay-
roll, and other human resource management functions. Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) is a business strategy that aims to increase profitability
and customer satisfaction, and is supported by a range of tools and technolo-
gies that enable you to capture and store information about your organiza-
tion’s customers, suppliers and partners.
Typically, in order to work with such data, you (or your Database Administra-
tor) are obliged to jump through a series of hoops. Here’s an equally typical
short list of them:
296
Part VI: Getting the Best Possible Data with Data Marts 

 Ask yourself and/or your colleagues exactly what (type of) data you
need to access.
 Create the new target database in which you’re going to store the data
you need.
 Study the ERM/CRP system and decide from which tables and columns
you can take the data you’re going to use to populate your new database.
 Map the contents of your source database to your target database —
and then either write some custom code or use a commercial tool to
actually perform those mappings.
 Write some more code to tidy it all up in the target database afterward.
Sound like fun? We thought not. Fortunately, help is at hand: BusinessObjects
Rapid Marts.
Built principally with the BusinessObjects Data Integrator (which has a star-
ring role in Chapter 18), Rapid Marts provide an off-the-shelf data-integration
package for a whole range of enterprise applications, making it quicker and
easier for you to get your hands on the data they contain.

The Part of Tens

In this part. . .
H
opefully, this information doesn’t come too late in
the game, but this part includes information that is
good to know before you start implementing Business-
Objects XI Release 2 at your place of work. Preparing a
migration or installation of a new enterprise software
package takes some preparation. Just as Rome wasn’t
built in a day, neither will your BusinessObjects environ-
ment be complete right out of the box.
Chapter 20 provides important tips and other helpful
information about preparing your IT environment for wel-
coming BusinessObjects XI Release 2. Chapter 21 features
some helpful online resources that help make installation
and integration easier!

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Prepare for
BusinessObjects Integration
G
etting ready for BusinessObjects XI Release 2 is no easy task. It’s a lot
like preparing for the holidays. It involves a lot of thankless work ensur-
ing that everything is exactly where it should be and as it should be. Of
course, your job is a lot easier than that of the poor guy or girl who actually
has to install BusinessObjects for your company. Those poor folks have to
think about server configurations, processors, and Web servers.
However, that doesn’t leave you off the hook. You need to take into account a
number of considerations before you start using BusinessObjects — or even
installing it on your own machine. By laying the groundwork and doing your
homework ahead of time, you can (potentially) save yourself a lot of time and
avoid a lot of headaches.
Now, don’t get us wrong. BusinessObjects XI Release 2 isn’t some sort of
scary monster. Still, large applications can often require a rather time-
consuming installation; you’ll definitely want to make sure your computer 
is up to speed — and that you’re actually ready to use BusinessObjects —
before launching headlong into the installation (ahem) adventure. This 
chapter helps you prepare both mentally and physically for integrating
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 to make it a positive experience.
Do Your Research!
We’re sorry to have to give you work to do, but what did you expect? Would
you go out and buy a new car or a new flat-screen TV without doing a little
research into what you’re buying? (We thought not.)
Software is the same way. Even if it’s a corporate decision to go with Business-
Objects XI Release 2, you still need to do some research to find out what
you’re using — and if you’re reading this book, you’re on the right track. Still,
your research needs to go a little further than that.

Business intelligence is a hot topic these days; in fact, it’s bandied around
quite a bit by marketing types who might not fully understand everything the
term really means. That’s why the glossary in this book helps you get famil-
iare with frequently used jargon; some entries might actually ring a bell from
the office if your administrator has already installed BusinessObjects XI
Release 2.
Check Out businessobjects.com
As obvious as it might seem, we recommend visiting the Business Objects
Web site to find out more about the application. While the documentation
line is quite robust (and may be confusing to a number of readers), they 
definitely have a few manuals that are worth checking out if you’re new to
BusinessObjects.
Also, if you’re preparing to do your own local installation, consult the instal-
lation or deployment documentation as a roadmap. These guides have more
detailed information concerning installation — especially in terms of mini-
mum requirements for both your computer and network.
The Business Objects Web site also has valuable information such as forums
and a knowledge base that can provide quick answers to some of your more
frequently asked questions. The forum, which is available to any registered
user, is at http://technicalsupport.businessobjects.com/cs/
forums/default.aspx.
Pick the Right Computer
This section applies to anyone who is planning to install BusinessObjects
locally or who isn’t planning on running the installation on a dedicated 
computer. 
Ideally, we recommend hosting BusinessObjects XI Release 2 only on a dedi-
cated server. BusinessObjects should run on a powerful computer whose sole
mission is to run BusinessObjects for your organization.
Some situations may warrant installing BusinessObjects XI Release 2 in “less
than ideal” hardware situations, but that doesn’t mean that you have to
shortchange the software. For example, if you’re looking to test the software
in a live environment before buying a brand-new computer to host it or putting
it on an enterprise-wide server, it’s totally plausible that you install it on a
test machine.
302
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

If that’s the case — or if you’re a small to mid-size company looking to install
BusinessObjects on a spare PC — you can do so, but you’ll want to stack the
computer in your favor.
Okay, you’ve heard this before, but take the necessary precautions to guaran-
tee that your installation will work. Here’s a quick checklist:
 Make sure that you’re using a powerful processor that is in line with
BusinessObjects’ minimum requirements. See Chapter 2 to find out
what the minimum requirements are.
 Keep extra RAM on board to ensure better performance. If you’re
buying a new computer these days, the standard seems to be 2GB. We
recommend having that amount available if you’re installing Business-
Objects, even if the minimum requirements are significantly lower. You
can never have too much memory.
 Keep a significant amount of hard-drive space free for your installa-
tion. For example, when we install large applications or need to serve,
we keep an entire hard drive available for that application. For example,
if we were installing BusinessObjects XI Release 2 on a spare PC, we’d
buy an extra disk (even an external USB drive works) and dedicate it to
BusinessObjects. 
You’ll have to store all of the documents that your users create, too!
 Make sure that you have the proper malware applications, as well as
an active firewall. To cover your malware protection, we recommend an
antivirus and anti-spyware combination for complete coverage. Our
standard approach is to use several different anti-spyware applications
to cover all our bases.
 Use a computer that you can leave turned on continually. Business-
Objects XI Release 2 requires continual uptime so others can access
applications — such as InfoView — so you’ll want to use a computer
that not only can be left on continually but also has a continual broad-
band Internet connection. Otherwise, when your host computer is off,
your colleagues can’t use BusinessObjects.
Are You Upgrading?
Are you an existing BusinessObjects user that is simply new to XI Release 2?
If so, you’ll have some extra concerns that you should think about prior to
integrating BusinessObjects XI Release 2. Here’s our short list:
 Everyone in your organization who runs Desktop Intelligence locally
must upgrade to BO XI R2. Migration is an all-or-nothing deal — either
everyone upgrades or things get ugly fast.
303
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Prepare for BusinessObjects Integration

 If you’ve saved any BusinessObjects or Web Intelligence documents,
you need to upgrade them (in DeskI or WebI) to BO XI R2. You can do
this using the Import Wizard tool.
After you upgrade a document, it cannot be used retroactively with any
earlier version of BusinessObjects.
 If you’re administrating the upgrade, think about upgrading every-
one’s personal documents and InfoView Inbox documents. Neither of
those groups migrates automatically; each requires your guidance in
order to happen correctly.
If InfoView, WebI, and DeskI are similar to previous versions, there are no sim-
ilarities with XI Release 2. You go from a BusinessObjects 6.0 repository,
which is located in different relational databases, to a CMS structure. If you
are coming from BusinessObjects 6.0 environment, the security management
changes completely as well. The Import Wizard helps you with this; however,
if you are coming from Crystal Reports 9, use the Repository Migration tool.
Though there are many similarities between this release of BusinessObjects
and earlier releases, throw out your preconceived notions of how the upgrade
should occur. To make the most out of BusinessObjects XI Release 2, remain
flexible and be prepared to adapt with the application.
Back Up Your System
Before you attempt to install BusinessObjects XI Release 2 on any computer,
be sure to perform a full backup of your entire computer. Even if you’re per-
forming a full installation on a new hard drive on your computer, perform a
backup of all other media drives and their files.
You certainly don’t want to take any unnecessary risks of data loss; computer
backups are relatively quick and easy to perform. In fact, we’ll go one step
further and urge you to perform a full backup even before adding another
hard drive or more memory to your machine.
Any type of “operation” on your computer is sufficient reason for backing up
your data. If you’ve been a conscientious PC user, you’re likely already per-
forming regularly scheduled backups to be safe. Don’t worry — we’re not
impugning the reliability or stability of BusinessObjects XI Release 2, but
rather offering a universal piece of advice that’s appropriate to any sort of
software installation.
304
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Organize Your Computer
As you get ready for your first steps using BusinessObjects XI Release 2, you
can make your life easier by organizing your computer accordingly. As men-
tioned earlier, we recommend installing BusinessObjects on a new partition —
or disk — to keep things clean and organized.
You can take that concept a step further by organizing your My Documents
folder in Windows XP with the specific purpose of storing your 
BusinessObjects documents or queries. While this might not prove instantly
valuable, you will see the benefits as you save more reports and your 
repository increases in size.
Organize Your Organization
In the previous section, we suggested organizing your computer for ease of
use with BusinessObjects XI Release 2 — especially when working with large
numbers of documents or queries. You can also apply that bit of advice to
your organization.
Before your organization gets busy creating document after document, orga-
nize your folders in InfoView so all users can easily and clearly understand
where they should be storing documents.
How you choose to organize your folder structures is entirely up to you or
the administrator, but keep in mind that the structure should make sense to
your organization. For example, you might want to separate documents by
universe — or perhaps create folders for each user and have each user store
documents in their respective organizations.
The important thing here is to clearly communicate the naming structure and
make sure that all BusinessObjects users are certain where to save documents
and where they can find others.
Verify Troop Readiness!
A good friend once said that if you want to make sure something is done right,
you should do it yourself. A little cynical perhaps, but also sage advice, espe-
cially when working with lots of people who are frequently under the gun and
might not always have time to cross every t and dot every i.
305
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Prepare for BusinessObjects Integration

If you’re responsible for BusinessObjects integration, take a few minutes to
make sure your colleagues are ready for installation. If your office is running
relatively new computers, the minimum requirements shouldn’t be an issue —
but you might want to verify that everyone is running a compatible Web
browser. Because every Web browser renders HTML slightly differently, it’s
important to make sure that you’re using Internet Explorer or Firefox.
If you plan to install BusinessObjects XI Release 2 manually on multiple com-
puters in your office, you may want to consider a checklist of compliance
requirements — and be sure you can verify them one by one. This checklist
might include (for example) adequate memory and disk space.
If any of your colleagues are working from home, you might want to send a
memo on compatibility so they can check whether they can use InfoView.
Most users probably won’t have DeskI access on home computers, so hard-
ware requirements per se aren’t a pressing concern. If users do need to
access DeskI from home, make sure your company has Virtual Private
Network (VPN) access so remote users can connect securely to their office
computers over a high-speed Internet connection.
As you check each computer, have each colleague sign off on compliance or
provide some sort of written acknowledgment that the computer is ready 
for BusinessObjects integration.
Check for Any Service Packs or Hot Fixes
BusinessObjects is no different from any other software application in its need
to be regularly maintained and updated. As is often the case with most large
software companies, larger clients tend to find important bugs or software
glitches — and the developer quickly issues a fix or patch to resolve the issue.
Before you install BusinessObjects XI Release 2 either on a sever or locally
for DeskI use, we recommend that you or your administrator consult the
Business Objects support Web site and verify that no service packs were
released since your software CDs were released.
It’s very important to check for updates whenever you install new software;
the actual installation CDs or executables are not regularly updated with bug
fixes. When you’re installing BusinessObjects XI Release 2, it’s safe to assume
that some updates are available for your application.
A number of release-specific hot fixes and patches are publicly available for
download on the Business Objects Web site. Some service packs are also
available via download; others may require a valid support plan in order to
306
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

access the downloadable file. For information on your support plan, check
with your administrator, whoever purchases the software from Business
Objects in your company, or your Business Objects account representative.
After you complete the BusinessObjects installation, you can install any ser-
vice packs or product updates manually, one at a time. These updates must
be performed manually for each local installation of BusinessObjects. Once
the hosted edition is updated, any authorized users who log on to the server
to use InfoView can be sure they’re using the updated version.
Be Patient!
Finally, the last tip for preparing for BusinessObjects integration is to be
patient. There’s certainly a lot of ground to cover as you get ready for using
BusinessObjects. You may not be surprised to learn that there’s still a lot of
ground to cover even after you’re actually up and running.
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 greatly simplifies data mining and report cre-
ation to help you get easy-to-understand answers to often complicated busi-
ness questions. It will take some time before you finally understand all the 
ins and outs of the software. That shouldn’t dissuade you from enjoying 
the many benefits that it can offer your organization.
Hopefully this book has taught you enough to feel confident in your first
steps — and has whetted your appetite for learning and using some
advanced features in BusinessObjects XI Release 2.

Ten Resources to Help You
A
lthough this book aims to be a handy reference for you to have by 
your side as you start to delve into the BusinessObjects XI Release 2
Enterprise suite, we’re modest enough to recognize that we can’t claim to 
be the only source of information on such a vast topic.
With this in mind, this chapter points you in the direction of a few useful Web
sites that you should bookmark and consult regularly.
The Business Objects Web Site
www.businessobjects.com/
When you’re looking to learn more about any product, be it a piece of software
or a car or a washing machine, one of your first ports of call should undoubt-
edly be the manufacturer’s Web site.
From the Business Objects Web site you can download official product docu-
mentation (http://support.businessobjects.com/documentation/
default.asp), find out how other people are using Business Objects prod-
ucts, discover more about the different aspects of business intelligence, and
(if all else fails) even contact customer support (http://technical
support.businessobjects.com/cs/forums/default).
Needless to say, the main aim of the site is to sell Business Objects products,
but it also contains some useful information underneath the marketing sheen.
Diamond Community
http://diamond.businessobjects.com/
One particularly useful section of the Business Objects Web site is the
Diamond Community, which is the official Business Objects “community”
site. It features forums, developer resources, product news, tips and tricks,

together with a series of specific portals for some of the company’s main
products (including Web Intelligence).
When you sign up for the Diamond Community, you also have the opportunity
to participate in Beta programs that give you early access to new versions of
the products.
Insight Blog
http://insight.businessobjects.com/bi-blog/
Despite the fact that two of the three authors on this collaborative blog are
Business Objects employees and it’s hosted on the Business Objects Web
site, it still manages to provide some good . . . insight (sorry) into why
Business Intelligence matters — beyond simply trotting out the company
line.
BOB: BusinessObjects Board
http://www.forumtopics.com/busobj/
If you don’t want the official word, but would rather ask questions and share
information with other users of the BusinessObjects suite who aren’t afraid
to point out when (and why) things are going wrong, and who can often pro-
vide ways around even the thorniest of problems, then the BusinessObjects
Board is the place for you.
As it says on its home page, the lively BOB forum is “a community of people
with a common interest: getting the most out of their investment in Business
Objects products.” This is a great place to learn from other, more experienced
Business Objects users.
GBS — Business Objects Admin 
and Security Solutions
http://www.gbandsmith.com/
Dealing with the complexities of the Business Objects security model, as in
Part II, is no easy task. GBS provides a handy, Web-based tool enabling you to
implement, manage, and document your BusinessObjects XI Release 2 secu-
rity more effectively.
310
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Business Intelligence.com
http://www.businessintelligence.com/
The Business Intelligence.com Web site provides a host of material covering
the many facets of business intelligence as a whole, rather than focusing
solely on the products in the BusinessObjects suite.
The site features numerous short articles, opinion pieces, and news stories,
and also offers more in-depth white papers for download (although to access
these you have to register with the site).
ITtoolbox Business Intelligence
Knowledge Base
http://businessintelligence.ittoolbox.com/
Like Business Intelligence.com, the BI corner of the ITtoolbox Knowledge Base
(one of the Web’s most successful IT knowledge-sharing sites) is a gold mine
of information on every aspect of the field of Business Intelligence. One of its
strengths lies in the way it breaks down its information by topic, and the fact
that it includes a specific BusinessObjects section, making it much easier to
find stuff that is of direct relevance to BusinessObjects.
Business Intelligence Network
http://www.b-eye-network.com/
If you can get past the packed home page, and the cutesy URL, the Business
Intelligence Network is one of our favorite sites on the Web for Business
Intelligence news, thanks to the sheer mass of information it provides about
the world of BI.
The Interop Vendor Alliance — 
Business Objects
http://interopvendoralliance.org/blogs/Business_Objects/
Default.aspx

Chapter 21: Ten Resources to Help You

Hidden away on the Web site of the Interop Vendor Alliance — which describes
itself as “a community of software and hardware vendors working together 
to enhance interoperability with Microsoft systems on behalf of our mutual
customers” — is this Weblog that contains a series of links to case studies,
data sheets, news stories, presentations, and even podcasts on Business
Objects and its products.
Admittedly, this is all information that can be found on the Business Objects
Web site — which is where most (if not all) of the links point — but we find
that the blog format makes it easier to keep up to date with the freshest 
content.
Crystal Reports Links
http://www.kenhamady.com/bookmarks.html
This page contains a list, breathlessly described by its creator as “unique on
the Web,” of what he claims is “virtually every” third-party Crystal Reports–
related software product on the market. Certainly, the list is impressively
long. Now, if only something similar existed for the rest of the Business
Objects product range . . . .
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 For
Dummies Companion Web Site

We couldn’t provide a list of Web sites without mentioning our own — the
companion site to this book, where we provide tips and tricks for using
BusinessObjects XI Release 2 more effectively.

Appendixes

In this part. . .
A
s we finished writing this book, we thought hard to
see whether we might have forgotten something.
After all, BusinessObjects XI Release 2 is a pretty robust
piece of software; there’s a lot to learn! In fact, we’ve really
just scraped the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with
the application. So, is there any parting advice or wisdom
that we should impart to you?
You bet there is! This part includes two appendixes.
Appendix A features an overview of Crystal Reports and
some of its key features. Though it is the subject of its
own For Dummies book, we provide you with some infor-
mation to help get you started.
Appendix B is a glossary of commonly used terminology
in this book and in business intelligence in general. It’s not
a complete list, but it can get you started with words that
you’ll encounter more than once as you explore the 
application.

Appendix A
Reporting on Crystal Reports
In This Appendix
 Getting a clear look at Crystal Reports
 Comparing Crystal Reports and WebI
I
n case you missed it, the title of this book is BusinessObjects XI Release 2
For Dummies. (Hey, we’re just staying focused here.) However, Business-
Objects XI is not the only query-and-reporting tool on the market — and not
even the only such tool that Business Objects offers. And thereby hangs a
tale: Back in December 2003, Business Objects acquired Canadian company
Crystal Decisions, and with that acquisition, the company added Crystal
Reports to its range of business-intelligence software.
This appendix provides a brief overview of Crystal Reports, especially with
regard to how the software compares to and complements Web Intelligence.
For a more detailed guide to the workings of Crystal Reports, we recommend
Crystal Reports 2008 For Dummies, by Allen Taylor, also published by Wiley.
What Is Crystal Reports?
Crystal Reports is a software tool that allows users to obtain rows and
columns of data from compatible data sources — including most common
databases, spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, XML files, and even text
files — and then arrange and format that data in the manner most appropri-
ate to creating a report.
Sound familiar?
The people who build Crystal Reports reports (is there an echo in here?) are
called report designers. These stalwarts share the fruits of their labor with
others, who can then look at the finished result using a range of report-
viewing tools. Some of those viewers are produced by Business Objects itself,
others are third-party tools. 

A quick Web search for “Crystal Reports viewer” gives you an idea of the
range of viewers available. (Plethora wouldn’t be overstating matters.)
Crystal Reports is often the first name that springs to mind when people are
asked to name a report-writing tool. The product has gained considerable
market share by being bundled in with many other applications, including
Microsoft Visual Studio.
Crystal Reports versus WebI
We wanted to set up this comparison as a heavyweight bout: “In the red
corner, we have the mighty Web Intelligence; and in the blue corner, that
young pretender to the throne, Crystal Reports. Who will win this clash of 
the titans as they both bid to become heavyweight champion of the enter-
prise reporting world?”
The truth, however, is that WebI and Crystal Reports — although they are
both report-creation tools — are not really in competition with each other.
They each address different markets; which one is right for the job at hand
depends largely on what you want to do and how you want to work, and to 
a certain extent on the size of your business as well.
Building the report
One of the first — and major — differences between Crystal Reports and Web
Intelligence lies in who actually builds the report. Whereas WebI is designed
to make it easy for ordinary business users to generate ad-hoc reports in a
jiffy, using common business terms instead of arcane database/IT terminology,
report creators in Crystal Reports still need a certain level of special knowl-
edge (and, okay, some arcane language) — as a result, they’re mostly IT staff
(or business power-users at the very least).
Put plainly, if you want to use Crystal Reports for anything other than simply
viewing reports created by others, you have to know your way around a data-
base in far more detail than you do if you’re using WebI.
Crystal Reports is much more of a top-down tool in its conception, built around
the idea that one expert creates pixel-perfect reports that are then to be
viewed and admired by many.
316
Part VIII: Appendixes 

Making your report pretty
Our use of the term “pixel-perfect” in the previous section was deliberate. One
area where Crystal Reports arguably has an advantage over Web Intelligence
concerns the level of control that report creators have over how the finished
output looks. Formatting is far more important in Crystal Reports. Specialist
users can take the time to create perfect-looking reports (see Figure A-1).
WebI, on the other hand, is all about empowering business users to create
their own reports with minimum fuss (see Figure A-2). The fact that you can
build your reports yourself, rather than having to rely on the IT department
to take care of it for you, means greater independence and flexibility. If you’re
working with Crystal Reports and your needs change or you want to analyze
a specific problem that crops up, you have to ask IT to do it for you, which
takes time — and because business users and IT don’t always speak the same
language, you may not even get exactly what you’re looking for when it finally
does arrive. With WebI, on the other hand, you can be sure that the document
matches your specific needs — because you will have created it yourself!
Use Crystal Reports if you want canned reports built by IT and distributed to
a large user base, or if you need your reports to be pixel-perfect in their pre-
sentation. Use WebI (or DeskI, of course) for creating your own ad-hoc reports,
and for better analysis.
Figure A-1:
Crystal
Reports lets
you create
“pixel-
perfect”
reports.
317
Appendix A: Reporting on Crystal Reports

Mass reporting
Another strength of Crystal Reports over WebI lies in the area of mass report-
ing. By tweaking the parameters of the different reporting elements, you can
send out a single report to a large audience, but users can view a tailored
subset of the overall data — and, best of all, they’ll get it more quickly than
they would using WebI.

ODBC: See Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).
Offline mode: Working only with BusinessObjects items stored directly on
your local computer (such as DeskI documents, local universes, and imported
universes) without any connection to your CMS. You can still access the
remote database but you can’t import/export universe, or publish and
retrieve document from your CMS.
OLAP: See Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP): A category of software tools used to
analyze data stored in a database by looking at multiple dimensions of con-
solidated data.
Online mode: In BusinessObjects, the default way of working by connecting
to the repository and use all the repository content; the repository need not
be stored on your local computer.
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC): A standard database-access method
that acts as a middle layer (called a database driver) between any application
and any database-management system.
Operand: In a query filter or condition, an operand explains with what the
object will be compared. For example, perhaps a constant, a constant coming
from a LOV, or a prompt.
Operator: An item in a filter query, a condition, or in the formula language
that describes how the object relates to the operand. Examples include 
Equal To, Less Than, Between, Matches Pattern, Both, and Except.
324
Part VIII: Appendixes 

Outer join: While a join combines records from two tables in a database into
a temporary, “joined” table, the peculiarity of an outer join is that it does not
require matching records in both joined tables.
Parse: In the processing of a SQL statement, the checking of syntax and object
validation before retrieving the relevant information. In BusinessObjects, this
operation is used to check the validity of your SQL from Query Panels, uni-
verse objects, and universe joins.
PDF: See Portable Document Format (PDF).
Performance Management: A suite of tools that is used in BusinessObjects
to create and edit dashboards, metrics, analytics, goals, and so on.
Personal document: A document you save in your personal document-storage
area on the server, to be used only by you.
Portable Document Format (PDF): A file format that enables you to read a
document on any computer platform using Adobe Acrobat.
Portal: A Web site that typically aggregates information from a range of sites
and other sources. The BusinessObjects portal is InfoView.
Portlet: A user-interface component that includes markup code from an
external source (often another Web page) in a Web portal.
Prompt: The point in a query condition or filter at which you enter or select a
value in order to advance the query. A prompt can be filled at every document
refresh.
Proxy: A server that handles requests from its clients by forwarding them to
other servers.
Publish: Saving a document to make it available to other users.
Purge: Deleting the data returned by a List of Values or a query, without
deleting the List of Values or query itself.
Query: A type of data provider used to obtain information from a database.
You build queries containing objects from a universe, and then run them to
create a document. A term used in Web Intelligence, this is the same as a 
condition.
Query result: The data returned by a query. See also Result object.
RDBMS: See Relational Data Base Management System.
325
Appendix B: Glossary

Refresh: Updating the data returned by a document’s query.
Relational Data Base Management System: This is the most-known database
system where the main vendors are Oracle, MySQL, SQL server, Teradata,
and Sybase.
Report: A graphical and textual rendering of data from one or multiple sources,
produced and distributed for viewing, analysis, and formatting.
Report Panel: Java applet or ActiveX control that you use to build your
queries and format your documents.
Repository: A central place where metadata (such as universe and security
information) is stored and maintained.
Resource: Any data that can be accessed over the Web, including text, images,
and executable files.
Result object: The object included in a query. See also Query result.
Schema: A collection of tables, indexes, views, and so on in a database.
Semantic layer: Patented by Business Objects in 1990, this networking layer
shields you from the complexity inherent in many database structures by let-
ting you come up with names for tables and columns that are meaningful to
you — which are then superimposed on the real structure of the database.
Shortcut join: Used in a schema with redundant joins that lead to the same
result.
Skin: A predefined look and feel for software features. You can choose skins
for InfoView, Web Intelligence, and Dashboards and change how your reports
appear.
Slice and Dice mode: A way of working by changing the structure of each
block inside your report so you can examine the data from different view-
points to understand it better. You cannot move, add, or remove a block from
the slice and dice; you can transform a table to a crosstab, but not remove it.
Sort: Forcing the data obtained from objects in queries and in different report
blocks to appear in ascending or descending order, or ordering documents
by name, author, date, or size.
SQL: See Structured Query Language (SQL).
Standalone setup: An installation of BusinessObjects that requires no network
connections, enabling you to work in offline mode if you choose.

Part VIII: Appendixes 

Structured Query Language (SQL): The syntax that lets you define and
manipulate data from a relational database.
Subquery: A query nested inside a main query.
Synchronization: A way of combining data when a data provider executes
more than one query (multiple measures or context in the same data
provider). This method occurs when all queries don’t have the same dimen-
sion. See also Join.
Table: A type of block that displays data in columns and rows.
Thin-client document: A document created when you generate reports in
Web Intelligence, called thin-client because it requires less software installed
on your local machine. See also Full-client document.

into standard subdivisions such as Year, Quarter, Month, or Day or monitor-
ing time data in EPM modules.
Timeout: The length of time a user has to connect, read, or write to a network
before the attempt to complete the transaction is stopped.
Uniform Resource Locator (URL): An address that specifies where to find a
resource, such as an Web page or an image, on a network. Often, this may
simply be the address of a Web page, such as http://www.dummies.com.
UNION: In SQL, an operator that combines the results of two queries into a
single result.
Universe: In BusinessObjects, the semantic layer between a user and a data-
base, made up of classes and objects. Objects in a universe correspond to
items of data in the database and are used by users to build their queries.
Universe designer: The user responsible for creating and maintaining 
universes.
URL: See Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
User account: An individual account created within the repository that dictates
what each unique user is authorized to do.
User group: A group of users who have access to a specified document domain
in the repository, as defined by the Supervisor.
Variable: A document element that corresponds to a formula based on objects
returned by a data provider, as well as other variables and functions.
