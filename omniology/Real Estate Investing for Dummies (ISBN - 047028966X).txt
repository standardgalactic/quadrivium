About the Authors
Eric Tyson, MBA, is a best-selling author and syndicated columnist. Through 
his counseling, writing, and teaching, he equips people to manage their 
personal finances better and successfully direct their investments. Eric is a 
former management consultant to Fortune 500 financial service firms and has 
successfully invested in real estate for more than two decades.
Eric earned his Bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business. Despite these handicaps to clear think-
ing, he had the good sense to start his own company, which took an innova-
tive approach to teaching people of all economic means about investing and 
money.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of 
the national bestsellers Personal Finance For Dummies and Investing For 
Dummies, coauthor of Home Buying For Dummies and Taxes For Dummies, 
and was an award-winning columnist for the San Francisco Examiner. His 
work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of national and local publica-
tions, including Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Kiplinger’s Personal 
Finance Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, and Bottom Line/Personal; and 
on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, CBS 
national radio, Bloomberg Business Radio, and Business Radio Network. He’s 
also been a featured speaker at a White House conference on retirement 
planning.
Despite his “wealth” of financial knowledge, Eric is one of the rest of us. He 
maintains a large inventory of bumblebee-colored computer books on his 
desk for those frequent times when his computer makes the (decreasing 
amount of) hair on his head fall out.
He’s on the Web at www.erictyson.com.
Robert S. Griswold, MSBA, is a successful real estate investor and hands-on 
property manager with a large portfolio of residential and commercial rental

He is the author of Property Management For Dummies and Property 
Management Kit For Dummies and the real estate expert for NBC San Diego, 
with a regular on-air live-caller segment since 1995. Robert was the host of 
a live weekly radio talk show, Real Estate Today!, for nearly 15 years, and 
he’s also the columnist for the syndicated “Rental Roundtable” and “Rental 
Forum” columns. These popular features are published in dozens of major 
newspapers throughout the country, and Robert has been recognized twice 
as the #1 real estate broadcast journalist in the nation by the National 
Association of Real Estate Editors.

Robert’s educational background includes having earned BS and master’s 
degrees in finance and business economics, real estate finance, international 
finance, real estate and urban land economics, and real estate develop-
ment, all from the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern 
California. His real estate investing and managing professional designations 
include the CRE (counselor of real estate), the CPM (certified property man-
ager), the CCIM (certified commercial investment member), the GRI (gradu-
ate, Realtor Institute), and the PCAM (professional community association 
manager).
Robert has been retained on over 1,000 legal matters as an expert in the stan-
dard of care and custom and practice for all aspects of real estate ownership 
and management in both state and federal cases throughout the country. 
He’s the president of Griswold Real Estate Management, Inc., managing resi-
dential, commercial, retail, and industrial properties throughout Southern 
California and Nevada.
On a personal level, Robert enjoys travel (particularly cruises), sports, and 
family activities. He truly enjoys real estate and tries to keep life in perspec-
tive through humor!

Dedication
Eric: To my wife, Judy; my family — especially my parents, Charles and 
Paulina; my friends; and to my counseling clients and students of my courses 
for teaching me how to teach them about managing their finances.
Robert: I dedicate this book to my wife, Carol, who has been there for me with 
her love, support, patience, and persistent attempts to bring the proper bal-
ance to my life. Of course, I am eternally grateful to my parents, my father Wes 
(who passed away while I wrote this book) and my mom Carol, for their uncon-
ditional love and infinite encouragement. Finally, I want to praise and thank 
God for the wonderful gifts and incredible opportunities He has given me.

Introduction
W
elcome to Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition! We’re 
delighted to be your tour guides. Throughout this book, we empha-
size three fundamental cornerstones that we believe to be true:
 
✓ Real estate is one of the three time-tested ways for people of varied eco-
nomic means to build wealth (the others are stocks and small business). 
Over the long-term (decades), you should be able to make an annualized 
return of at least 8 to 10 percent per year investing in real estate.
 
✓ Investing in real estate isn’t rocket science but does require doing your 
homework. If you’re sloppy doing your legwork, you’re more likely to 
end up with inferior properties or to overpay. Our book clearly explains 
how to buy the best properties at a fair (or even below-market value!) 
price. (Although we cover all types of properties, this book concentrates 
more on residential investment opportunities, which are more acces-
sible and appropriate for nonexperts.)
 
✓ Although you should make money over the long-term investing in good 
real estate properties, you can lose money, especially in the short-term. 
Don’t unrealistically expect real estate values to increase every year. As 
many folks experienced in the late-2000s, they don’t! When you invest 
in real estate for the long-term, which is what we advocate and practice 
ourselves, the occasional price declines should be merely bumps on an 
otherwise fruitful journey.
How This Book Is Different
If you expect us (in infomercial-like fashion) to tell you how to become an 
overnight multimillionaire, this is definitely not the book for you. And please 
allow us to save you money, disappointment, and heartache by telling you 
that such hucksters are only enriching themselves through their grossly 
overpriced tapes and seminars.
Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, covers tried and proven 
real estate investing strategies that real people, just like you, use to build 
wealth. Specifically, this book explains how to invest in single-family homes; 

2
Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
detached and attached condominiums; small apartments including duplexes, 
triplexes, and multiple-family residential properties up to 20 to 30 units; com-
mercial properties, including office, industrial, and retail; and raw (undevel-
oped) land. We also cover indirect real estate investments such as real estate 
investment trusts (REITs) that you can purchase through the major stock 
exchanges or a real estate mutual fund.
We’ve always relied on tried-and-true methods of real estate investing and 
our core advice is as true today as it was before the real estate downturn in 
the late-2000s. Our book is an especially solid reference in a down economy 
and will help you position yourself for the rebound.
Unlike so many real estate book authors, we don’t have an alternative agenda 
in writing this book. Many real estate investing books are nothing more 
than infomercials for high priced DVDs or seminars the author is selling. 
The objective of our book is to give you the best crash course in real estate 
investing so that if you choose to make investments in income-producing 
properties, you may do so wisely and confidently.
Here are some good reasons why we — Eric Tyson and Robert Griswold — 
are a dynamic duo on your side:
Robert Griswold has extensive hands-on experience as a real estate investor 
who has worked with properties of all types and sizes. He is also the author 
of Property Management Kit For Dummies (Wiley) and is the author of two 
popular syndicated real estate newspaper columns. He has appeared for over 
15 years as the NBC-TV on-air real estate expert for Southern California. And 
for nearly 15 years, he was the host of the most popular and longest run-
ning real estate radio show in the country — Real Estate Today! with Robert 
Griswold on Clear Channel Communications.
Robert also holds the titles Counselor of Real Estate (CRE), Certified 
Commercial Investment Member (CCIM), Professional Community 
Association Manager (PCAM), and Certified Property Manager (CPM) des-
ignations. He earned a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees in real 
estate and related fields from the University of Southern California’s Marshall 
School of Business.
Eric Tyson is a former financial counselor, lecturer, and coauthor of the 
national bestseller Home Buying For Dummies (Wiley), as well as the author 
or coauthor of four other bestselling books in the For Dummies series: 
Personal Finance; Investing; Mutual Funds; and Taxes.
Eric has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of personal finance, 
investment, and real estate quandaries and questions. A former management 
consultant to Fortune 500 financial service firms, Eric is dedicated to teaching

people to better manage their personal finances. Over the past 25 years, he 
has successfully invested in real estate and securities and started and man-
aged several businesses. He earned an MBA at the Stanford Graduate School 
of Business and a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale.
Foolish Assumptions
Whenever an author sits down to write a book, he has a particular audience 
in mind. Because of this, he must make some assumptions about who his 
reader is and what that reader is looking for. Here are a few assumptions 
we’ve made about you:
 
✓ You’re looking for a way to invest in real estate but don’t know what 
types of properties and strategies are best.
 
✓ You’re considering buying an investment property, be it a single-family 
home, a small apartment complex, or an office building, but your real 
estate experience is largely limited to renting an apartment or owning 
your own home.
 
✓ You may have a small amount of money already invested in real estate, 
but you’re ready to go after bigger, better properties.
 
✓ You’re looking for a way to diversify your investment portfolio.
If any of these descriptions hit home for you, you’ve come to the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve organized Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, into five 
parts. Here’s what you find in each:
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up 
Against Other Investments
In this part, we explain how real estate compares with other common invest-
ments, how to determine whether you’ve got what it takes to succeed as a 
real estate investor, how much money you need to invest in various types 
of real estate, and the tax advantages of real estate. We also cover how to 
fit real estate investments into your overall financial and personal plans. 

4
Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
We discuss the range of real estate investments available to you — not only 
common ones (such as single-family homes and small apartments) but also 
the more unusual (such as foreclosures and probate sales). An entire chapter 
is devoted to passive real estate investments, including real estate invest-
ment trusts, tenants in common, triple net properties, notes and trust deeds, 
limited partnerships, and tax lien certificate sales. We also cover the allure of 
property flipping and buying with no or little money down. Finally, you want 
to work with the best professionals that you can, so we also detail how to 
interview and secure top agents, lawyers, and other real estate pros.
Part II: How to Get the Money: 
Raising Capital and Financing
You can’t play if you can’t pay. This part details how and where to come 
up with the dough you need to buy property. We also explain the common 
loans available through lenders and how you may be able to finance your real 
estate investment through the seller of the property. Finally, we share all of 
our favorite strategies for finding and negotiating the best deals when you 
need a mortgage.
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties
This section gets down to the brass tacks of helping you decide where and 
what to buy. We explain how to value and evaluate real estate investment 
properties: From choosing the best locations to projecting a property’s cash 
flow, we have you covered. Finally, we walk you through the negotiation pro-
cess, plus all of the ins and outs of purchase agreements, inspections, and 
closing on your purchase.
Part IV: Operating the Property
After you own a property, you have lots of opportunities to improve its value 
and manage it well. For starters, this important part covers how to be a land-
lording genius, find and keep the best tenants, and sign solid lease contracts. 
We also reveal many proven methods for boosting (legally, of course) a prop-
erty’s return and value. We don’t let tax headaches get you down as we walk 
you through how to account for the annual cash flow on your property and 

5
 Introduction
how the tax advantages of depreciation allow you to legally pay lower taxes. 
Last but not least, we share strategies for deciding when and how to sell, 
including how to defer taxation on your sales’ profits while expanding your 
real estate holdings if you so desire.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part contains other important chapters that didn’t fit neatly into the rest 
of this book. Topics that we cover in this section include ten steps to real 
estate success and ten ways to increase a property’s return.
Appendix
This book is comprehensive, but it isn’t a book of forms. The purchase and 
sale of real estate is complicated, and specific legal issues and practices 
vary throughout the country. We do include a purchase agreement in the 
appendix to illustrate some of the key points. However, we recommend that 
you contact local real estate professionals for the forms that are specifically 
drafted for your area.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you can find friendly and useful icons to enhance your 
reading pleasure and to note specific types of information. Here’s what each 
icon means:

eal estate is just one of many available investment 
options, so in this part, we compare and contrast 
real estate investing with alternatives you may consider. 
We discuss the realities of investing in and managing 
rental properties (both the pros and the cons) and how to 
fit real estate into your overall personal financial plans. 
We also cover the gamut of real estate investments you 
have to choose from and how to begin to assemble a team 
of competent professionals to assist you with the process.

W
hen Robert first entered the real estate field while attending college 
decades ago, his father, a retired real estate attorney, advised that he 
use his monthly income primarily to pay day-to-day living expenses and allo-
cate money each month into long-term financial investments like real estate. 
This solid advice has served Robert well over the years.
It’s never too early or too late to formulate your own plan into a comprehen-
sive wealth-building strategy. For many, such a strategy can help with the 
challenges of funding future education for children and ensuring a comfort-
able retirement.
The challenge involved with real estate is that it takes some real planning to 
get started. Contacting an investment company and purchasing some shares 
of your favorite mutual fund or stock is a lot easier than acquiring your first 
rental property. Buying property isn’t that difficult, though. You just need a 
financial and real estate investment plan, a lot of patience, and the willing-
ness to do some hard work, and you’re on your way to building your own real 
estate empire!
In this chapter, we give you some information that can help you decide 
whether you have what it takes to make money and be comfortable with 
investing in real estate. We compare real estate investments to other invest-
ments. We provide some questions you need to ask yourself before making 
any decisions. And finally, we offer guidance on how real estate investments 
can fit into your overall personal financial plans. Along the way, we share

Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
our experience, insights, and thoughts on a long-term strategy for building 
wealth through real estate that virtually everyone can understand and 
actually achieve.
Understanding Real Estate’s Income- 
and Wealth-Producing Potential
 
Compared with most other investments, good real estate can excel at produc-
ing current income for property owners. So in addition to the longer-term 
appreciation potential, you can also earn income year in and year out. Real 
estate is a true growth and income investment.
 
The vast majority of people who don’t make money in real estate make easily 
avoidable mistakes, which we help you avoid.
The following list highlights the major benefits of investing in real estate:
 
✓ Tax-deferred compounding of value: In real estate investing, the appre-
ciation of your properties compounds tax-deferred during your years of 
ownership. You don’t pay tax on this profit until you sell your property — 
and even then you can roll over your gain into another investment prop-
erty and avoid paying taxes. (See the “Tax advantages” section later in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Regular cash flow: If you have property that you rent out, you have 
money coming in every month in the form of rents. Some properties, 
particularly larger multiunit complexes, may have some additional 
sources, such as from coin-operated washers and dryers.
 
 When you own investment real estate, you should also expect to incur 
expenses that include your mortgage payment, property taxes, insur-
ance, and maintenance. The interaction of the revenues coming in and 
the expenses going out is what tells you whether you realize positive 
operating profit each month.
 
✓ Reduced income tax bills: For income tax purposes, you also get to 
claim an expense that isn’t really an out-of-pocket cost — depreciation. 
Depreciation enables you to reduce your current income tax bill and 
hence increase your cash flow from a property. (We explain this tax 
advantage and others later in the “Tax advantages” section.)
 
✓ Rate of increase of rental income versus overall expenses: Over time, 
your operating profit, which is subject to ordinary income tax, should 
rise as you increase your rental prices faster than the rate of increase 
for your property’s overall expenses. What follows is a simple example 
to show why even modest rental increases are magnified into larger 
operating profits and healthy returns on investment over time.

11
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
Suppose that you’re in the market to purchase a single-family home that you 
want to rent out and that such properties are selling for about $200,000 in 
the area you’ve deemed to be a good investment. (Note: Housing prices vary 
widely across different areas but the following example should give you a 
relative sense of how a rental property’s expenses and revenue change over 
time.) You expect to make a 20 percent down payment and take out a 30-year 
fixed rate mortgage at 6 percent for the remainder of the purchase price — 
$160,000. Here are the details:
Monthly mortgage payment 
$960
Monthly property tax 
$200
Other monthly expenses (maintenance, insurance) 
$200
Monthly rent 
$1,400
In Table 1-1, we show you what happens with your investment over time. We 
assume that your rent and expenses (except for your mortgage payment, 
which is fixed) increase 3 percent annually and that your property appreci-
ates a conservative 4 percent per year. (For simplification purposes, we 
ignore depreciation in this example. If we had included the benefit of depre-
ciation, it would further enhance the calculated returns.)

Now, notice what happens over time. When you first buy the property, the 
monthly rent and the monthly expenses are about equal. By year five, the 
monthly income exceeds the expenses by about $200 per month. Consider 
why this happens — your largest monthly expense, the mortgage payment, 
doesn’t increase. So, even though we assume that the rent increases just 3 
percent per year, which is the same rate of increase assumed for your non-
mortgage expenses, the compounding of rental inflation begins to produce 
larger and larger cash flow to you, the property owner. Cash flow of $200 per 
month may not sound like much, but consider that this $2,400 annual income 
is from an original $40,000 investment. Thus, by year five, your rental property 

12
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
is producing a 6 percent return on your down payment. (And remember, if 
you factor in the tax deduction for depreciation, your cash flow and return are 
even higher.)
In addition to the monthly cash flow from the amount that the rent exceeds 
the property’s expenses, also look at the last two columns in Table 1-1 to 
see what has happened by year five to your equity (the difference between 
market value and mortgage) in the property. With just a 4 percent annual 
increase in market value, your $40,000 in equity (the down payment) has 
more than doubled to $94,370 ($243,330 – $148,960).
By years 10 and 20, you can see the further increases in your monthly cash 
flow and significant expansion in your property’s equity. By year 30, the 
property is producing more than $1,400 per month cash flow and you’re now 
the proud owner of a mortgage-free property worth more than triple what 
you paid for it!
After you get the mortgage paid off in year 30, take a look at what happens 
to your monthly expenses (big drop) and therefore your cash flow in year 31 
and beyond (big increase).
Recognizing the Caveats 
of Real-Estate Investing
Despite all its potential, real-estate investing isn’t lucrative at all times and 
for all people — here’s a quick outline of the biggest caveats that accompany 
investing in real estate:
 
✓ Few home runs: Your likely returns from real estate won’t approach the 
home runs that the most accomplished entrepreneurs achieve in the 
business world.
 
✓ Upfront operating profit challenges: Unless you make a large down 
payment, your monthly operating profit may be small or nonexistent 
in the early years of rental property ownership. During soft periods in 
the local economy, rents may rise more slowly than your expenses or 
even fall. That’s why you must ensure that you can weather financially 
tough times. In the worst cases, we’ve seen rental property owners lose 
both their investment property and their homes. Please see the section 
“Fitting Real Estate into Your Financial Plans” later in this chapter.

13
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
 
✓ Ups and downs: You’re not going to earn an 8 to 10 percent return every 
year. Although you have the potential for significant profits, owning real 
estate isn’t like owning a printing press at the U.S. Treasury. Like stocks 
and other types of ownership investments, real estate goes through 
down as well as up periods. Most people who make money investing 
in real estate do so because they invest and hold property over many 
years.
 
✓ Relatively high transaction costs: If you buy a property and then want 
out a year or two later, you may find that even though it has appreciated 
in value, much (if not all) of your profit has been wiped away by the high 
transaction costs. Typically, the costs of buying and selling — which 
include real estate agent commissions, loan fees, title insurance, and 
other closing costs — amount to about 15 percent of the purchase price 
of a property. So, although you may be elated if your property appreci-
ates 15 percent in value in short order, you may not be so thrilled to 
realize that if you sell the property, you may not have any greater return 
than if you had stashed your money in a lowly bank account.
 
✓ Tax implications: Last, but not least, when you make a profit on your 
real estate investment, the federal and state governments are waiting 
with open hands for their share. Throughout this book, we highlight 
ways to improve your after-tax returns. As we stress more than once, 
the profit you have left after Uncle Sam takes his bite (not your pretax 
income) is all that really matters.
These drawbacks shouldn’t keep you from exploring real estate investing as an 
option; rather, they simply reinforce the need to really know what you’re get-
ting into with this type of investing and whether it’s a good match for you. The 
rest of this chapter takes you deeper into an assessment of real estate as an 
investment as well as introspection about your goals, interests, and abilities.
Comparing Real Estate 
to Other Investments
Surely you’ve considered or heard about many different investments over 
the years. To help you appreciate and understand the unique characteristics 
of real estate, we compare and contrast real estate’s attributes with those of 
other wealth building investments like stocks and small business.

14
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Returns
Clearly, a major reason that many people invest in real estate is for the 
healthy total returns (which include ongoing profits and the appreciation of 
the property). Real estate generates robust long-term returns because, like 
stocks and small business, it’s an ownership investment. By that, we mean 
that real estate is an asset that has the ability to produce income and profits.
Our research and experience suggest that total real estate investment 
returns are comparable to those from stocks — about 8 to 10 percent annu-
ally. Interestingly, the average annual return on real estate investment trusts 
(REITs), publicly traded companies that invest in income producing real 
estate such as apartment buildings, office complexes, and shopping centers 
has been about 10 percent. See our discussion of REITs in Chapter 4.
And you can earn returns better than 10 percent per year if you select excel-
lent properties in the best areas and manage them well.
How leverage affects your real estate returns
Real estate is different from most other invest-
ments in that you can typically borrow (finance) 
up to 70 to 80 percent or more of the value of 
the property. Thus, you can use your small 
down payment of 20 to 30 percent of the pur-
chase price to buy, own, and control a much 
larger investment. (During market downturns, 
lenders tighten requirements and may require 
larger down payments than they do during good 
times.) So when your real estate increases in 
value (which is what you hope and expect), you 
make money on your investment as well as on 
the money that you borrowed. That’s what we 
mean when we say that the investment returns 
from real estate get magnified due to leverage.
Take a look at this simple example. Suppose 
you purchase a property for $150,000 and make 
a $30,000 down payment. Over the next three 
years, imagine that the property appreciates 
10 percent to $165,000. Thus, you have a profit 
(on paper) of $15,000 ($165,000 – $150,000) on 
an investment of just $30,000. In other words, 
you’ve made a 50 percent return on your invest-
ment. (Note: We ignore cash flow — whether 
your expenses from the property exceed the 
rental income that you collect or vice versa, 
and the tax benefits associated with rental real 
estate.)
Remember, leverage magnifies all of your 
returns, and those returns aren’t always posi-
tive! If your $150,000 property decreases in 
value to $135,000, even though it has only 
dropped 10 percent in value, you actually lose 
(on paper) 50 percent of your original $30,000 
investment. (In case you care, and it’s okay if 
you don’t, some wonks apply the terms positive 
leverage and negative leverage.) Please see 
the “Understanding Real Estate’s Income- and 
Wealth-Producing Potential” section earlier 
in this chapter for a more detailed example of 
investment property profit and return.

 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
Risk
Real estate doesn’t always rise in value — witness the decline occurring in 
most parts of the U.S. during the late 2000s. That said, market values for real 
estate don’t generally suffer from as much volatility as stock prices do. You 
may recall how the excitement surrounding the mushrooming of technology 
and Internet stock prices in the late 1990s turned into the dismay and agony 
of those same sectors’ stock prices crashing in the early 2000s. Many stocks 
in this industry, including those of leaders in their niches, saw their stock 
prices plummet by 80 percent, 90 percent, or more.
Keep in mind (especially if you tend to be concerned about shorter-term 
risks) that real estate can suffer from declines of 10 percent, 20 percent, or 
more. If you make a down payment of say, 20 percent, and want to sell your 
property after a 10 to 15 percent price decline, you may find that all (as in 
100 percent) of your invested dollars (down payment) are wiped out after 
you factor in transaction costs. So you can lose everything.
 
You can greatly reduce and minimize your risk investing in real estate through 
buying and holding property for many years (seven to ten or more).
Liquidity
Liquidity — the ease and cost with which you can sell and get your money 
out of an investment — is one of real estate’s shortcomings. Real estate is 
relatively illiquid: You can’t sell a piece of property with the same speed with 
which you whip out your ATM card and withdraw money from your bank 
account or sell a stock with a phone call or click of your computer’s mouse.
We actually view this illiquidity as a strength, certainly compared with stocks 
that people often trade in and out of because doing so is so easy and seem-
ingly cheap. As a result, many stock market investors tend to lose sight of the 
long-term and miss out on the bigger gains that accrue to patient buy-and-
stick-with-it investors. Because you can’t track the value of investment real 
estate daily on your computer, and because real estate takes considerable 
time, energy, and money to sell, you’re far more likely to buy and hold onto 
your properties for the longer-term.
Although real estate investments are generally less liquid than stocks, they’re 
generally more liquid than investments made in your own or someone else’s 
small business. People need a place to live and businesses need a place to 
operate, so there’s always demand for real estate (although the supply of 
such properties can greatly exceed the demand in some areas during certain 
time periods).

Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Capital requirements
Although you can easily get started with traditional investments such as 
stocks and mutual funds with a few hundred or thousand dollars, the vast 
majority of quality real estate investments require far greater investments — 
usually on the order of tens of thousands of dollars. (We devote an entire 
part of this book — Part II, to be precise — to showing you how to raise capi-
tal and secure financing.)
 
If you’re one of the many people who don’t have that kind of money burn-
ing a hole in your pocket, don’t despair. We present you with lower cost real 
estate investment options. Among the simplest low-cost real estate invest-
ment options are real estate investment trusts (REITs). You can buy these 
as exchange traded stocks or invest in a portfolio of REITs through an REIT 
mutual fund (see Chapter 4).
Diversification value
An advantage of holding investment real estate is that its value doesn’t 
necessarily move in tandem with other investments, such as stocks or 
small-business investments that you hold. You may recall, for example, the 
massive stock market decline in the early 2000s. In most communities around 
America, real estate values were either steady or actually rising during this 
horrendous period for stock prices.
However, real estate prices and stock prices, for example, can move down 
together in value (as happened in most parts of the country during the 2007–
2008 stock market slide). Sluggish business conditions and lower corporate 
profits can depress stock and real estate prices.
Opportunities to add value
Although you may not know much about investing in the stock market, you 
may have some good ideas about how to improve a property and make it 
more valuable. You can fix up a property or develop it further and raise the 
rental income accordingly. Perhaps through legwork, persistence, and good 
negotiating skills, you can purchase a property below its fair market value.
Relative to investing in the stock market, persistent and savvy real estate 
investors can more easily buy property in the private real estate market at 
below fair market value. You can do the same in the stock market, but the 
scores of professional, full-time money managers who analyze the public 
market for stocks make finding bargains more difficult. We help you identify 
properties that you can add value to in Part III.

 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
Tax advantages
Real estate investment offers numerous tax advantages. In this section, we 
compare and contrast investment property tax issues with those of other 
investments.
Deductible expenses (including depreciation)
Owning a property has much in common with owning your own small busi-
ness. Every year, you account for your income and expenses on a tax return. 
(We cover all the taxing points about investment properties in Chapter 18.) 
For now, we want to remind you to keep good records of your expenses in 
purchasing and operating rental real estate. (Check out Chapter 17 for more 
information on all things accounting.) One expense that you get to deduct 
for rental real estate on your tax return — depreciation — doesn’t actually 
involve spending or outlaying money. Depreciation is an allowable tax deduc-
tion for buildings, because structures wear out over time. Under current tax 
laws, residential real estate is depreciated over 27
1⁄ 2 years (commercial build-
ings are depreciated over 39 years). Residential real estate is depreciated 
over shorter time periods because it has traditionally been a favored invest-
ment in our nation’s tax laws.
Tax-free rollovers of rental property profits
When you sell a stock or mutual fund investment that you hold outside a 
retirement account, you must pay tax on your profits. By contrast, you can 
avoid paying tax on your profit when you sell a rental property if you roll 
over your gain into another like-kind investment real estate property.
The rules for properly making one of these 1031 exchanges are complex and 
usually involve third parties. We cover 1031 exchanges in Chapter 18. Make 
sure that you find an attorney and/or tax advisor who is an expert at these 
transactions to ensure that everything goes smoothly (and legally).
If you don’t roll over your gain, you may owe significant taxes because of how 
the IRS defines your gain. For example, if you buy a property for $200,000 and 
sell it for $550,000, you not only owe tax on that difference, but you also owe 
tax on an additional amount, depending on the property’s depreciation. The 
amount of depreciation that you deduct on your tax returns reduces the origi-
nal $200,000 purchase price, making the taxable difference that much larger. 
For example, if you deducted $125,000 for depreciation over the years that 
you owned the property, you owe tax on the difference between the sale price 
of $550,000 and $75,000 ($200,000 purchase price – $125,000 depreciation).
Deferred taxes with installment sales
Installment sales are a complex method that can be used to defer your tax bill 
when you sell an investment property at a profit and you don’t buy another 
rental property. With such a sale, you play the role of banker and provide 

18
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
financing to the buyer. In addition to collecting a competitive interest rate 
from the seller, you only have to pay capital gains tax as you receive pro-
ceeds over time from the sale. For details, please see Chapter 18.
Special tax credits for low-income housing and old buildings
If you invest in and upgrade low-income housing or certified historic build-
ings, you can gain special tax credits. The credits represent a direct reduc-
tion in your tax bill from expenditures to rehabilitate and improve such 
properties. These tax credits exist to encourage investors to invest in and fix 
up old or run-down buildings that likely would continue to deteriorate other-
wise. The IRS has strict rules governing what types of properties qualify. See 
IRS Form 3468 to discover more about these credits.
Determining Whether You Should 
Invest in Real Estate
We believe that most people can succeed at investing in real estate if they’re 
willing to do their homework, which includes selecting top real estate profes-
sionals. In the sections that follow, we ask several important questions to 
help you decide whether you have what it takes to succeed and be happy 
with real estate investments that involve managing property.
Do you have sufficient time?
Purchasing and owning investment real estate and being a landlord is time 
consuming. If you fail to do your homework before purchasing property, 
you can end up overpaying or buying real estate with a mess of problems. 
Finding competent and ethical real estate professionals takes time. (We guide 
you through the process in Chapter 6.) Investigating communities, neighbor-
hoods, and zoning also soaks up plenty of hours (information on performing 
this research is located in Chapter 10), as does examining tenant issues with 
potential properties (see Chapter 11).
As for managing a property, you can hire a property manager to interview 
tenants and solve problems such as leaky faucets and broken appliances, but 
doing so costs money and still requires some of your time.
 
If you’re stretched too thin due to work and family responsibilities, real estate 
investing may not be for you. You may want to look into the less time-intensive 
real estate investments discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.

19
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
Can you deal with problems?
Challenges and problems inevitably occur when you try to buy a property. 
Purchase negotiations can be stressful and frustrating. You can also count on 
some problems coming up when you own and manage investment real estate. 
Most tenants won’t care for a property the way property owners do.
If every little problem (especially those that you think may have been caused 
by your tenants) causes you distress, at a minimum, you should only own 
rental property with the assistance of a property manager. You should also 
question whether you’re really going to be happy owning investment property. 
The financial rewards come well down the road, but you live the day-to-day 
ownership headaches immediately.
Does real estate interest you?
In our experience, some of the best real estate investors have a curiosity and 
interest in real estate. If you don’t already possess it, such an interest and 
curiosity can be cultivated — and this book may just do the trick.
On the other hand, some people simply aren’t comfortable investing in rental 
property. For example, if you’ve had experience and success with stock 
market investing, you may be uncomfortable venturing into real estate invest-
ments. Some people we know are on a mission to start their own business 
and may prefer to channel the time and money into that outlet.
Can you handle market downturns?
Real estate investing isn’t for the faint of heart. Buying and holding real estate 
is a whole lot of fun when prices and rents are rising. But market downturns 
happen, and they test you emotionally as well as financially.
Consider the real estate market price declines that happened in most com-
munities and types of property in the late 2000s. Such drops can present 
attractive buying opportunities for those with courage and cash.
None of us has a crystal ball though so don’t expect to be able to buy at the 
precise bottom of prices and sell at the precise peak of your local market. 
Even if you make a smart buy now, you’ll inevitably end up holding some 
of your investment property during a difficult market (recessions where 
you have trouble finding and retaining quality tenants, where rents may fall 
rather than rise, where your property falls in value). Do you have the finan-
cial wherewithal to handle such a downturn? How have you handled other 
investments when their values have fallen?

Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Fitting Real Estate into 
Your Financial Plans
For most nonwealthy people, purchasing investment real estate has a major 
impact on their overall personal financial situation. So, before you go out to 
buy property, you should inventory your money life and be sure your fiscal 
house is in order. This section explains how you can do just that.
Ensure your best personal financial health
If you’re trying to improve your physical fitness by exercising, you may find 
that eating lots of junk food and smoking are barriers to your goal. Likewise, 
investing in real estate or other growth investments such as stocks while 
you’re carrying high-cost consumer debt (credit cards, auto loans, and so on) 
and spending more than you earn impedes your financial goals.
 
Before you set out to invest in real estate, pay off all your consumer debt. Not 
only will you be financially healthier for doing so, but you’ll also enhance your 
future mortgage applications.
Eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending; analyze your monthly spend-
ing to identify target areas for reduction. This practice enables you to save 
more and better afford making investments including real estate. Live below 
your means. As Charles Dickens said, “Annual income twenty pounds; annual 
expenditures nineteen pounds; result, happiness. Annual income twenty 
pounds; annual expenditure twenty pounds; result, misery.”
Protect yourself with insurance
Regardless of your real estate investment desires and decisions, you abso-
lutely must have comprehensive insurance for yourself and your major 
assets, including
 
✓ Health insurance: Major medical coverage protects you from financial 
ruin if you have a big accident or illness that requires significant hospi-
tal and other medical care.
 
✓ Disability insurance: For most working people, their biggest asset 
is their future income-earning ability. Disability insurance replaces a 
portion of your employment earnings if you’re unable to work for an 
extended period of time due to an incapacitating illness or injury.

21
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
 
✓ Life insurance: If loved ones are financially dependent upon you, term 
life insurance, which provides a lump sum death benefit, can help to 
replace your employment earnings if you pass away.
 
✓ Homeowner’s insurance: Not only do you want homeowner’s insur-
ance to protect you against the financial cost due to a fire or other 
home-damaging catastrophe, but such coverage also provides you with 
liability protection. (After you buy and operate a rental property with 
tenants, you should obtain rental owner’s insurance. See Chapter 16 for 
more information).
 
✓ Auto insurance: This coverage is similar to homeowner’s coverage in 
that it insures a valuable asset and also provides liability insurance 
should you be involved in an accident.
 
✓ Excess liability (umbrella) insurance: This relatively inexpensive cover-
age, available in million dollar increments, adds on to the modest liabil-
ity protection offered on your home and autos, which is inadequate for 
more-affluent people.
Nobody enjoys spending hard-earned money on insurance. However, having 
proper protection gives you peace of mind and financial security, so don’t 
put off reviewing and securing needed policies. For assistance, see the latest 
edition of Eric’s Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley).
Consider retirement account funding
If you’re not taking advantage of your retirement accounts (such as 401(k)s, 
403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs), you may be missing out on some terrific tax 
benefits. Funding retirement accounts gives you an immediate tax deduc-
tion when you contribute to them. And some employer accounts offer “free” 
matching money — but you’ve got to contribute to earn the matching money.
In comparison, you derive no tax benefits while you accumulate your down 
payment for an investment real estate purchase (or other investment such as 
for a small business). Furthermore, the operating profit or income from your 
real estate investment is subject to ordinary income taxes as you earn it. To 
be fair and balanced, we must mention here that investment real estate offers 
numerous tax benefits, which we detail in the “Tax advantages” section ear-
lier in this chapter.
Think about asset allocation
With money that you invest for the longer-term, you should have an overall 
game plan in mind. Fancy-talking financial advisors like to use buzzwords 
such as asset allocation, a term that indicates what portion of your money 

22
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
you have invested in different types of investment vehicles, such as stocks 
and real estate (for growth) or lending vehicles, such as bonds and CDs 
(which produce current income).
 
Here’s a simple way to calculate asset allocation: Subtract your age from 110. 
The result is the percentage of your long-term money that you should invest in 
ownership investments for appreciation. So, for example, a 40-year-old would 
take 110 minus 40 equals 70 percent in growth investments such as stocks and 
real estate. If you want to be more aggressive, subtract your age from 120; a 
40-year-old would then have 80 percent in growth investments.
As you gain more knowledge, assets, and diversification of growth assets, 
you’re in a better position to take on more risk. Just be sure you’re properly 
covered with insurance as discussed earlier in the section “Protect yourself 
with insurance.”
 
These are simply guidelines, not hard-and-fast rules or mandates. If you want 
to be more aggressive and are comfortable taking on greater risk, you can 
invest higher portions in ownership investments.
As you consider asset allocation, when classifying your investments, deter-
mine and use your equity in your real estate holdings, which is the market 
value of property less outstanding mortgages. For example, suppose that 
prior to buying an investment property, your long-term investments consist 
of the following:
Stocks 
$150,000
Bonds 
$50,000
CDs 
$50,000
Total 
$250,000
So, you have 60 percent in ownership investments ($150,000) and 40 percent 
in lending investments ($50,000 + $50,000). Now, suppose you plan to pur-
chase a $300,000 income property making a $75,000 down payment. Because 
you’ve decided to bump up your ownership investment portion to make your 
money grow more over the years, you plan to use your maturing CD balance 
and sell some of your bonds for the down payment. After your real estate 
purchase, here’s how your investment portfolio looks:
Stocks 
$150,000
Real estate 
$75,000 ($300,000 property – $225,000 mortgage)
Bonds 
$25,000
Total 
$250,000

23
 Chapter 1: Evaluating Real Estate as an Investment
Thus, after the real estate purchase, you’ve got 90 percent in ownership 
investments ($150,000 + $75,000) and just 10 percent in lending investments 
($25,000). Such a mix may be appropriate for someone under the age of 50 
who desires an aggressive investment portfolio positioned for long-term 
growth potential.
Become your own landlord
Many real estate investors are actually involved 
in other activities as their primary source of 
income. Ironically, many of these business 
owners come to realize the benefits of real 
estate investing but miss the single greatest 
opportunity that is right before their eyes — the 
prospect of being their own landlord. Robert 
has advised many business owners that they 
should purchase the buildings occupied by their 
own businesses and essentially pay the rent to 
themselves. If you own a business that rents, do 
yourself a favor — become your own landlord!

▶ Looking at residential properties
▶ Getting to know commercial real estate
▶ Studying undeveloped land
I
f you lack substantial experience investing in real estate, you should avoid 
more esoteric and complicated properties and strategies. In this chapter, 
we discuss the more accessible and easy-to-master income-producing prop-
erty options. In particular, residential income property, which we discuss in 
the next section, can be an attractive real estate investment for many people. 
Residential housing is easier to understand, purchase, and manage than 
most other types of property, such as office, industrial, and retail property. If 
you’re a homeowner, you already have experience locating, purchasing, and 
maintaining residential property.
In addition to discussing the pros and cons of investing in residential income 
property, we add insights as to which may be the most appropriate and prof-
itable for you and touch on the topics of investing in commercial property as 
well as undeveloped land.
The Various Ways to Invest in 
Residential Income Property
The first (and one of the best) real estate investments for many people is a 
home in which to live. In this section, we cover the investment possibilities 
inherent in buying a home for your own use, including potential profit to be 
had from converting your home to a rental or fixing it up and selling it. We also 
give you some pointers on how to profit from owning your own vacation home.

26
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Buying a place of your own
During your adult life, you’re going to need a roof over your head for many 
decades. And real estate is the only investment that you can live in or rent 
out to produce income. A stock, bond, or mutual fund doesn’t work too well 
as a roof over your head!
 
Unless you expect to move within the next few years, buying a place prob-
ably makes good long-term financial sense. (Even if you need to relocate, you 
may decide to continue owning the property and use it as a rental property.) 
Owning usually costs less than renting over the long haul and allows you to 
build equity (the difference between market value and mortgage loans against 
the property) in an asset.
Under current tax law, you can also pocket substantial tax-free profits when 
you sell your home for more than you originally paid plus the money you 
sunk into improvements during your ownership. Specifically, single taxpayers 
can realize up to a $250,000 tax-free capital gain; married couples filing jointly 
get up to $500,000. In order to qualify for this homeowner’s gains tax exemp-
tion, you (or your spouse if you’re married) must have owned the home and 
used it as your primary residence for a minimum of 24 months out of the 
past 60 months. The 24 months doesn’t have to be continuous. Additionally, 
the IRS now provides for pro-rata (proportionate) credit based on hardship 
or change of employment. Also note that the full exemption amounts are 
reduced proportionately for the length of time you rented out your home 
over the five-year period referenced above.
Some commentators have stated that your home isn’t an investment, 
because you’re not renting it out. We respectfully disagree: Consider the fact 
that many people move to a less costly home when they retire (because it’s 
smaller and/or because it’s in a lower cost area). Trading down to a lower 
priced property in retirement frees up equity that has built up over many 
years of homeownership. This money can be used to supplement your retire-
ment income and for any other purpose your heart desires. Your home is an 
investment because it can appreciate in value over the years, and you can 
use that money toward your financial or personal goals. Home Buying For 
Dummies (Wiley), which Eric cowrote with residential real estate expert Ray 
Brown, can help you make terrific home buying decisions.
Converting your home to a rental
Turning your current home into a rental property when you move is a simple 
way to buy and own more properties. This approach is an option if you’re 
already considering investing in real estate (either now or in the future), and 

27
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
you can afford to own two properties. Holding onto your current home when 
you’re buying a new one is more advisable if you’re moving within the same 
area so that you’re close by to manage the property. This approach presents 
a number of positives:
 
✓ You save the time and cost of finding a separate rental property, not to 
mention the associated transaction costs.
 
✓ You know the property and have probably taken good care of it and per-
haps made some improvements.
 
✓ You know the target market because the house appealed to you.
 
Some people unfortunately make the mistake of holding onto their current 
home for the wrong reasons when they buy another. This situation often 
happens when homeowners must sell their homes in a depressed market. 
Nobody likes to lose money and sell their home for less than they paid for it. 
Thus, some owners hold onto their homes until prices recover. If you plan to 
move and want to keep your current home as a long-term investment (rental) 
property, you can. If you fully convert your home to rental property and use it 
that way for years before selling it, after you do sell you can either take advan-
tage of the lower long-term capital gains rates or do a tax deferred exchange. 
For tax purposes, you get to deduct depreciation and all of the write-offs 
during the ownership and you can shelter up to $25,000 in income from active 
sources subject to income eligibility requirements. (Please see Chapter 18 for 
more details.)
Turning your home into a short-term rental, however, is usually a bad move 
because:
 
✓ You may not want the responsibilities of being a landlord, yet you force 
yourself into the landlord business when you convert your home into a 
rental.
 
✓ You owe tax on the sales’ profit if your property is classified for tax pur-
poses as a rental when you sell it and don’t buy another rental property. 
(You can purchase another rental property through a 1031 exchange to 
defer paying taxes on your profit. See the discussion in Chapter 18.)
Effective tax year 2009, you lose some of the capital gains tax exclusion if 
you sell your home and you had rented it out for a portion of the five year 
period prior to selling it. For example, if you rented your home for two of the 
last five years, you may only exclude 60 percent of your gain (up to the maxi-
mums of $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for married couples filing 
jointly), whereas the other 40 percent is taxed as a long-term capital gain. 
Also be aware that when you sell a home previously rented and are account-
ing for the sale on your tax return, you have to recapture the depreciation 
taken during the rental period.

28
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Investing and living in well-situated 
fixer-uppers
Serial home selling is a variation on the tried-and-true real estate investment 
strategy of investing in well-located fixer-upper homes where you can invest 
your time, sweat equity, and materials to make improvements that add more 
value than they cost. The only catch is that you must actually move into the 
fixer-upper for at least 24 months to earn the full homeowner’s capital gains 
exemption of up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for married 
couples filing jointly (as we cover in the “Buying a place of your own” section 
earlier in this chapter).
 
Be sure to buy a home in need of that special TLC in a great neighborhood 
where you’re willing to live for 24 months! But if you’re a savvy investor, you 
would’ve invested in a great neighborhood anyway.
Here’s a simple example to illustrate the potentially significant benefits of 
this strategy. You purchase a fixer-upper for $275,000 that becomes your 
principal residence, and then over the next 24 months you invest $25,000 in 
improvements (paint, landscaping, appliances, decorator items, and so on) 
and you also invest the amount of sweat equity that suits your skills and 
wallet. You now have one of the nicer homes in the neighborhood, and you 
can sell this home for a net price of $400,000 after your transaction costs. 
With your total investment of $300,000 ($275,000 plus $25,000), your efforts 
have earned you a $100,000 profit completely tax-free. Thus, you’ve earned 
an average of $50,000 per year, which isn’t bad for a tax-exempt second 
income without strict office hours. (Note that many states also allow you to 
avoid state income taxes on the sale of your personal residence, using many 
of the same requirements as the federal tax laws.)
 
Now, some cautions are in order here. This strategy is clearly not for everyone 
interested in making money from real estate investments. We recommend that 
you bypass this strategy if any of the following apply:
 
✓ You’re unwilling or reluctant to live through redecorating, minor remod-
eling, or major construction.
 
✓ You dislike having to move every few years.
 
✓ You’re not experienced or comfortable with identifying undervalued 
property and improving it.
 
✓ You lack a financial cushion to withstand a significant downturn in your 
local real estate market as happened in numerous parts of the country 
during the mid- to late-2000s.
 
✓ You don’t have the budget to hire a professional contractor to do the 
work, and you don’t have the free time or the home improvement skills 
needed to enhance the value of a home.

29
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
 
One final caution: Beware of transaction costs. The expenses involved with 
buying and selling property — such as real estate agent commissions, loan 
fees, title insurance, and so forth — can gobble up a large portion of your prof-
its. With most properties, the long-term appreciation is what drives your 
returns. Consider keeping homes you buy and improve as long-term invest-
ment properties.
Purchasing a vacation home
Many people of means expand their real estate holdings by purchasing a 
vacation home — a home in an area where they enjoy taking pleasure trips. 
For most people, buying a vacation home is more of a consumption deci-
sion than it is an investment decision. That’s not to say that you can’t make 
a profit from owning a second home. However, potential investment returns 
shouldn’t be the main reason you buy a second home.
For example, we know a family that lived in Pennsylvania and didn’t particu-
larly like the hot and humid summer weather. They enjoyed taking trips and 
staying in various spots in northern New England and eventually bought a 
small home in New Hampshire. Their situation highlights the pros and cons 
that many people face with vacation or second homes. The obvious advan-
tage this family enjoyed in having a vacation home is that they no longer had 
the hassle of securing accommodations when they wanted to enjoy some 
downtime. Also, after they arrived at their home away from home, they were, 
well, home! Things were just as they expected — with no surprises, unless 
squirrels had taken up residence on their porch.
 
The downsides to vacation homes can be numerous, as our Pennsylvania 
friends found, including
 
✓ Expenses: With a second home, you have the range of nearly all of the 
costs of a primary home — mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, 
maintenance, utilities, and so on.
 
✓ Property management: When you’re not at your vacation home, things 
can go wrong. A pipe can burst, for example, and the mess may not be 
found for days or weeks. Unless the property is close to a kind person 
willing to keep an eye on it for you, you may incur the additional 
expense of paying a property manager to watch the property for you.
 
✓ Lack of rental income: Most people don’t rent out their vacation homes, 
thus negating the investment property income stream that contributes 
to the returns real estate investors enjoy (see Chapter 1). If your second 
home is in a vacation area where you have access to plenty of short-
term renters, you or your designated property manager can rent out 
the property. However, this entails all of the headaches and hassles of 
having many short-term renters. (But you do gain the tax advantages of 
depreciation and all expenses as with other rental properties.)

30
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
✓ Obligation to use: Some second homeowners we know complain about 
feeling forced to use their vacation homes. Oftentimes in marriages, one 
spouse likes the vacation home much more than the other spouse (or 
one spouse enjoys working on the second home rather than enjoying the 
home itself).
 
Before we close out this section on vacation homes, we want to share a few 
tax tips, as found in the current tax code:
 
✓ If you retain your vacation home or secondary home as personal prop-
erty, forgoing the large income streams and tax write-offs for deprecia-
tion and operating expenses associated with rental properties, you can 
still make a nice little chunk of tax-free cash on the side. The current tax 
code permits you to rent the property for up to 14 days a year — and that 
income is tax-free! You don’t have to claim it. Yes, you read that right. And 
you can still deduct the costs of ownership, including mortgage interest 
and property taxes, as you do for all other personal properties.
 
✓ If you decide to maintain the property as a rental (you rent it out for more 
than 14 days a year), you, as the property owner, can still use the rental 
property as a vacation home for up to 14 days a year, or a maximum of 10 
percent of the days gainfully rented, whichever is greater, and the prop-
erty still qualifies as a rental. Also, all days spent cleaning or repairing the 
rental home don’t count as personal use days — so that’s why you paint 
for a couple of hours every afternoon and spend the morning fishing!
Before you buy a second home, weigh all the pros and cons. If you have a 
spouse or partner with whom you’re buying the property, have a candid dis-
cussion. Also consult with your tax advisor for other tax-saving strategies for 
your second home or vacation home. And please see Chapter 18 for more tax 
related information on rental properties.
Paying for condo hotels and timeshares
Timeshares, a concept created in the 1960s, are a form of ownership or right 
to use a property. A more recent trend in real estate investing is condo 
hotels, which in many ways are simply a new angle on the old concept of 
timeshares. A condo hotel looks and operates just like any other first-class 
hotel, with the difference that each room is separately owned. The guests 
have no idea who owns their room.
Both timeshares and condo hotels typically involve luxury resort locations 
with amenities such as golf or spas. The difference between the traditional 
timeshare and condo hotel is the interval that the unit is available — condo 
hotels are operated on a day-to-day availability, and timeshares typically rent 
in fixed intervals such as weeks.

31
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
Some of the most popular projects have been the branded condo hotels such 
as Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Trump, W, Westin, and Hilton located in the 
high profile vacation destinations like Hawaii, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago, 
and Miami. You can also find many foreign condo hotel properties in the 
Caribbean and Mexico, and the concept is expanding to Europe, the Middle 
East, and Asia.
Two types of individuals are attracted to investing in condo hotels and time-
shares. One group is investors who believe that the property will appreciate 
like any other investment. The other group is people who use the condo 
hotel or timeshare for personal use and offset some of their costs.
From an investment standpoint, the fundamental problem with timeshares 
is that they’re overpriced, and like a condominium, you own no land (which 
is what generally appreciates well over time). For example, suppose that a 
particular unit would cost $150,000 to buy. When this unit is carved up into 
weekly ownership units, the total cost of all those units can easily approach 
four to five times that amount!
To add insult to injury, investors find that another problem with timeshares 
is the high maintenance or annual service fees. Is it worth buying a slice of 
real estate at a 400 to 500 percent premium to its fair market value and pay 
high fees on top of that? We don’t think so.
Many owners of timeshares find that they want to vacation at a different 
location or time of year than what they originally purchased. To meet this 
need, several companies offer to broker or sell timeshare slots. However, 
timeshare availability and desirability have so many variables — including 
location, time of year, and quality of the particular resort — that it has been 
difficult to fairly value and trade timeshares. As a result, resort rating sys-
tems have been developed (Resorts Condominiums International and Interval 
International are two of the most well known) to compare resort location, 
amenities, and quality.
The developers and operators of condo hotels love the concept because 
one of the most consistently successful principles of real estate is increasing 
value by fractionalizing interests in real estate. As with timeshares, the devel-
opers are able to sell each individual hotel room for much more than they 
could get for the entire project.
Condo hotel operators are able to generate additional revenue from service 
and maintenance fees to cover their costs of operations. Often the owners’ 
use of their own rooms doesn’t negatively impact the overall revenues of the 
property because the rooms would have sometimes been vacant anyway. 
Condo hotels allow their owners to stay in their units but often impose limits 
on the amount of personal usage.

32
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
The purchaser of the condo hotel unit sees this type of investment as an 
option to direct ownership of a second home and likes the ability to gener-
ate income. The professional management is another one of the attractions 
to investors. The owners don’t pay a management fee to the hotel operator 
unless their room is rented, and then the collected revenue is split.
Still interested in a timeshare? Read on.
Timeshares are packaged in a multitude of 
ways — some resorts offer fixed units where 
you vacation at the exact same unit every year 
either on set dates or set numbered weeks 
(though the actual calendar date may vary. 
Some timeshares are available as biennial 
(every other year) so you can have some vari-
ety. Some offer fixed weeks, where you have 
the same week every year but may be in a dif-
ferent unit.
Timeshares aren’t just a one-time purchase; 
they also have monthly or annual service or 
maintenance fees. These funds are established 
each year by the homeowner’s association or 
resort management company. There are differ-
ent types of ownership for timeshare interests, 
with fee simple, right of use, and leasehold 
being the primary options:
 ✓ Fee simple ownership is an estate in real 
estate that provides the absolute owner-
ship subject to state and local laws and 
government powers such as taxation, emi-
nent domain, police power, and so on.
 ✓ Right-to-use are occupancy rights for a 
given number of years but no actual owner-
ship interest in the property. Some states and 
many foreign countries don’t allow the fee 
simple ownership of timeshares so they offer 
long-term lease or right-to-use agreements 
that can be from 20 to 99 years. The actual fee 
simple title of the real estate remains with the 
resort developer or management company. 
The day-to-day operations of timeshares are 
typically handled by the homeowner’s asso-
ciation or a resort management company.
 ✓ Leasehold is an agreement between the 
lessee (tenant) and lessor (owner or land-
lord) specifying the lessee’s right to use the 
leased property for a given purpose and 
given time at a specified rental payment.
If you’re interested in buying a timeshare, 
you can talk with the developer directly; this 
method may make sense if you’re looking for a 
particular time of the year in the high season. 
The timeshare industry typically uses a color-
coded pricing system to denote the seasonal 
demand for a particular timeshare property. 
Although the concept is pretty consistent, the 
designation of particular colors can vary from 
one resort to another. In general, the demand is 
broken down into three categories:
 ✓ Red for the prime or high demand
 ✓ Yellow or white for intermediate or medium 
season
 ✓ Green or blue for off-season or low 
demand
If you’re looking for a week in the green or blue 
season, you can often find much better pric-
ing from reputable resellers. The reputable is 
a key and elusive term here. Among compa-
nies to consider for reselling timeshares are 
RCI, Interval International, and Trading Places 
International

 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
These properties are often hyped, and the expectations of the condo hotel 
investor are often much greater than the reality. Investors are lured to condo 
hotels by the potential for appreciation and cash flow as well as professional 
management. Many investors find themselves being pressured into pre-sale 
offering presentations even before the units are built. These events can be 
tempting, but savvy investors need to do their own due diligence. So when 
you hear a sales pitch indicating that your proposed investment in a condo 
hotel unit will provide significant income from hotel rentals and cover most 
or all of your mortgage and carrying costs, that’s the time to grab your wallet 
and find the nearest exit.
Many investors’ first experiences with timeshares are tempting offers of a 
free meal, a great discount offer to a theme park, or even a free one or two 
night stay at the resort, with the catch that they have to spend some time 
listening to an informational presentation. These offers usually come from 
individuals contacting you in known tourist locations or when you check into 
a hotel that just happens to offer condos as well. Robert remembers his first 
exposure to timeshares was as a child in the early ‘70s on a family vacation 
to Florida, when his parents got a free camera just for attending a seminar on 
timeshares near Orlando. Even as a teenager, Robert didn’t like the obvious 
pressure sales tactics he observed.
 
However, timeshares may make sense for you if you like to vacation at the 
same resort around the same time every year and if the annual service or 
maintenance fees compare favorably to the cost of simply staying in a compa-
rable resort. Remember, though, that if the deal seems too good to be true, it 
is too good to be true. As with timeshares, the only folks who generally make 
money with condo hotels are the developers, not the folks who buy specific 
days of ownership.
Surveying the Types of Residential 
Properties You Can Buy
If you’ve been in the market for a home, you know that in addition to single-
family homes, you can choose from numerous types of attached or shared 
housing including apartment buildings, condominiums, townhomes, and co-
operatives. In this section, we provide an overview of each of these properties 
and show how they may make an attractive real estate investment for you.
 
From an investment perspective, our top recommendations are apartment build-
ings and single-family homes. We generally don’t recommend attached-housing 
units. If you can afford a smaller single-family home or apartment building 
rather than a shared-housing unit, buy the single-family home or apartments.

34
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
Unless you can afford a large down payment (25 percent or more), the early 
years of rental property ownership may financially challenge you: With all 
properties, as time goes on, generating a positive cash flow gets easier 
because your mortgage expense stays fixed (if you use fixed rate financing) 
while your rents increase faster than your expenses. Regardless of what you 
choose to buy, make sure that you run the numbers on your rental income 
and expenses (see Chapter 12) to see if you can afford the negative cash flow 
that often occurs in the early years of ownership.
Single-family homes
 
As an investment, single-family detached homes generally perform better in 
the long run than attached or shared housing. In a good real estate market, 
most housing appreciates, but single-family homes tend to outperform other 
housing types for the following reasons:
 
✓ Single-family homes tend to attract more potential buyers — most 
people, when they can afford it, prefer a detached or stand-alone home, 
especially for the increased privacy.
 
✓ Attached or shared housing is less expensive and easier to build and 
to overbuild; because of this surplus potential, such property tends to 
appreciate more moderately in price.
 
Because so many people prefer to live in detached, single-family homes, 
market prices for such dwellings can sometimes become inflated beyond 
what’s justified by the rental income these homes can produce. That’s exactly 
what happened in some parts of the United States in the mid-2000s and led 
in part to a significant price correction in the subsequent years. To discover 
whether you’re buying in such a market, compare the monthly cost (after tax) 
of owning a home to monthly rent for that same property. Focus on markets 
where the rent exceeds or comes close to equaling the cost of owning and 
shun areas where the ownership costs exceed rents.
Single-family homes that require just one tenant are simpler to deal with 
than a multiunit apartment building that requires the management and 
maintenance of multiple renters and units. The downside, though, is that a 
vacancy means you have no income coming in. Look at the effect of 0 percent 
occupancy for a couple of months on your projected income and expense 
statement! By contrast, one vacancy in a four-unit apartment building (each 
with the same rents) means that you’re still taking in 75 percent of the gross 
potential (maximum total) rent.
With a single-family home, you’re responsible for all maintenance. You can 
hire someone to do the work, but you still have to find the contractors and 
coordinate and oversee the work. Also recognize that if you purchase a 

35
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
single-family home with many fine features and amenities, you may find it 
more stressful and difficult to have tenants living in your property who don’t 
treat it with the same tender loving care that you may yourself.
 
The first rule of being a successful landlord is to let go of any emotional 
attachment to a home. But that sort of attachment on the tenant’s part is 
favorable: The more they make your rental property their home, the more 
likely they are to stay and return it to you in good condition — except for the 
expected normal wear and tear of day-to-day living. (We discuss the proper 
screening and selection of tenants in Chapter 15.)
 
Making a profit in the early years from the monthly cash flow with a single-
family home is generally the hardest stage. The reason: Such properties usu-
ally sell at a premium price relative to the rent that they can command (you 
pay extra for the land, which you can’t rent). Also remember that with just one 
tenant, you have no rental income when you have a vacancy.
Attached housing
As the cost of land has climbed over the decades in many areas, packing 
more housing units that are attached into a given plot of land keeps housing 
somewhat more affordable. Shared housing makes more sense for investors 
who don’t want to deal with building maintenance and security issues.
In this section, we discuss the investment merits of three forms of attached 
housing: condominiums, townhomes, and co-ops.
Condos
Condominiums are typically apartment-style units stacked on top of and/or 
beside one another and sold to individual owners. When you purchase a con-
dominium, you’re actually purchasing the interior of a specific unit as well 
as a proportionate interest in the common areas — the pool, tennis courts, 
grounds, hallways, laundry room, and so on. Although you (and your ten-
ants) have full use and enjoyment of the common areas, remember that the 
homeowner’s association actually owns and maintains the common areas as 
well as the building structures themselves (which typically include the foun-
dation, roof, plumbing, electrical, and other building systems).
One advantage to a condo as an investment property is that of all the attached 
housing options, condos are generally the lowest-maintenance properties 
because most condominium associations deal with issues such as roofing, 
gardening, and so on for the entire building and receive the benefits of quan-
tity purchasing. Note that you’re still responsible for necessary maintenance 
inside your unit, such as servicing appliances, interior painting, and so on.

36
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Although condos may be somewhat easier to keep up, they tend to appreci-
ate less than single-family homes or apartment buildings unless the condo is 
located in a desirable urban area.
Condominium buildings may start out in life as condos or as apartment com-
plexes that are then converted into condominiums.
 
Be wary of apartments that have been converted to condominiums. Although 
they’re often the most affordable housing options in many areas of the coun-
try and may also be blessed with an excellent urban location that can’t easily 
be re-created, you may be buying into some not so obvious problems. Our 
experience is that these converted apartments are typically older properties 
with a cosmetic makeover (new floors, new appliances, new landscaping, and 
a fresh coat of paint). However, be forewarned: The cosmetic makeover may 
look good at first glance, but the property probably still boasts 40-year-old 
plumbing and electrical systems, poor soundproofing, and a host of economic 
and functional obsolescence.
Within a few years, most of the owner-occupants move on to the traditional 
single-family home and rent out their condos. You may then find the property 
is predominantly renter-occupied and has a volunteer board of directors 
unwilling to levy the monthly assessments necessary to properly maintain 
the aging structure. Within 10 to 15 years of the conversion, these properties 
may well be the worst in the neighborhood.
Townhomes
Townhomes are essentially attached or row homes — a hybrid between a 
typical airspace-only condominium and a single-family house. Like condo-
miniums, townhomes are generally attached, typically sharing walls and a 
continuous roof. But townhomes are often two-story buildings that come 
with a small yard and offer more privacy than a condominium because you 
don’t have someone living on top of your unit.
 
As with condominiums, you absolutely must review the governing docu-
ments before you purchase the property to see exactly what you legally own. 
Generally, townhomes are organized as planned unit developments (PUDs) in 
which each owner has a fee simple ownership (no limitations as to transfer-
ability of ownership — the most complete ownership rights one can have) of 
his individual lot that encompasses his dwelling unit and often a small area of 
immediately adjacent land for a patio or balcony. The common areas are all 
part of a larger single lot, and each owner holds title to a proportionate share 
of the common area.

37
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
Co-ops
Co-operatives are a type of shared housing that has elements in common 
with apartments and condos. When you buy a cooperative, you own a stock 
certificate that represents your share of the entire building, including usage 
rights to a specific living space per a separate written occupancy agreement. 
Unlike a condo, you generally need to get approval from the co-operative 
association if you want to remodel or rent your unit to a tenant. In some 
co-ops, you must even gain approval from the association for the sale of your 
unit to a proposed buyer.
 
Turning a co-op into a rental unit is often severely restricted or even forbid-
den and, if allowed, is usually a major headache because you must satisfy not 
only your tenant but also the other owners in the building. Co-ops are also 
generally much harder to finance, and a sale requires the approval of the typi-
cally finicky association board. Therefore, we highly recommend that you 
shun co-ops for investment purposes.
Apartments
Not only do apartment buildings generally enjoy healthy long-term appreciation 
potential, but they also often produce positive cash flow (rental income – 
expenses) in the early years of ownership. But as with a single-family home, the 
buck stops with you for maintenance of an apartment building. You may hire 
a property manager to assist you, but you still have oversight responsibilities 
(and additional expenses).
 
In the real-estate financing world, apartment buildings are divided into two 
groups based on the number of units:
 
✓ Four or fewer units: You can obtain more favorable financing options 
and terms for apartment buildings that have four or fewer units because 
they’re treated as residential property.
 
✓ Five or more units: Complexes with five or more units are treated as 
commercial property and don’t enjoy the extremely favorable loan 
terms of the one- to four-unit properties.
Apartment buildings, particularly those with more units, generally produce a 
small positive cash flow, even in the early years of rental ownership (unless 
you’re in an overpriced market where it may take two to four years before 
you break even on a before-tax basis).

38
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
One way to add value, if zoning allows, is to convert an apartment building 
into condominiums. Keep in mind, however, that this metamorphosis requires 
significant research on the zoning front and with estimating remodeling and 
construction costs.
Considering Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate is a generic term that includes properties used for 
office, retail, and industrial purposes. You can also include self-storage and 
hospitality (hotels and motels) properties in this category. If you’re a knowl-
edgeable real estate investor and you like a challenge, you need to know two 
good reasons to invest in commercial real estate:
 
✓ You can use some of the space if you own your own small business. Just 
as it’s generally more cost-effective to own your home rather than rent 
over the years, so it is with commercial real estate if — and this is a big 
if — you buy at a reasonably good time and hold the property for many 
years.
 
✓ Your analysis of your local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy. 
We discuss more on this point in a moment.
Easy fixes can yield big bucks
Avoid shared housing units in suburban areas 
with substantial undeveloped land that enables 
building many more units. Attached housing 
prices tend to perform best in fully developed 
or built-out urban environments.
For higher returns, look for property where 
relatively simple cosmetic and other fixes may 
allow you to increase rents and, therefore, the 
market value of the property. Examples of such 
improvements may include but not be limited to
 ✓ Adding fresh paint and flooring
 ✓ Improving the landscaping
 ✓ Upgrading the kitchen with new appliances 
and new cabinet/drawer hardware that can 
totally change the look
 ✓ Converting five-unit apartment buildings into 
four-unit buildings to qualify for more favor-
able mortgage terms (see the “Apartments” 
section earlier in this chapter)
Look for property with a great location and good 
physical condition but some minor deferred 
maintenance. Then you can develop the punch 
list of items with maximum results for minimum 
dollars — for example, a property with a large 
yard but dead grass, a two- or three-car garage 
but peeling paint or a broken garage door. You 
can also add a garage door opener to jazz up 
the property for minimum cost. You can also 
really add value to a property with a burnt-out, 
absentee, or totally disinterested owner who is 
tired of the property.

39
 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
 
We want to be clear, though, that commercial real estate isn’t our first recom-
mendation, especially for inexperienced investors. Residential real estate is 
generally far easier to understand and also usually carries lower investment 
and tenant risks.
With commercial real estate, when tenants move out, new tenants nearly 
always require extensive and costly improvements to customize the space 
to meet their planned usage of the property. And you usually have to pay for 
the majority of the associated costs in order to compete with other building 
owners. Fortunes can quickly change — small companies can go under, get 
too big for a space, and so on. Change is the order of the day in the business 
world, and especially in the small business world.
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real estate 
market? You must check out, over a number of years, the supply and demand 
statistics. How much total space (and new space) is available for rent, and 
how has that changed in recent years? What’s the vacancy rate, and how has 
that changed over time? Also, examine the rental rates, usually quoted as a 
price per square foot. We help you cover this ground in Chapter 8.
 
One danger sign that purchasing a commercial property in an area is likely 
to produce disappointing investment returns is a market where the supply of 
available space has increased faster than demand, leading to higher vacan-
cies and falling rental rates. (This is called negative absorption, and what you 
naturally want is a track record and projections showing positive absorption — 
when the supply of space isn’t keeping up with the demand.) A slowing local 
economy and a higher unemployment rate also spell trouble for commercial 
real estate prices. Each market is different, so make sure you check out the 
details of your area.
Buying Undeveloped Land
For prospective real estate investors who feel tenants and building mainte-
nance are ongoing headaches, buying undeveloped land may appear attrac-
tive. If you buy land in an area that’s expected to experience expanding 
demand in the years ahead, you should be able to make a tidy return on your 
investment. This is called buying in the path of progress, but of course the trick 
is to buy before everybody realizes that new development is moving in your 
direction. (Check out Chapter 8 for a full discussion on the path of progress.)
You may even hit a home run if you can identify land that others don’t cur-
rently see the future value in holding. However, identifying many years in 
advance which communities will experience rapid population and job growth 
isn’t easy. Land prices in areas that people believe will be the next hot spot 

40
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
already sell at a premium price. That’s what happened in most major cities 
with new sports facilities (especially because these decisions often are dis-
closed well in advance of the municipality leadership vote or the ballot initia-
tive). You don’t have much opportunity to get ahead of the curve — or if you 
guess wrong, you may own some costly land for a long time!
 
Investing in land certainly has other drawbacks and risks:
 
✓ Care and feeding: Land requires ongoing cash to pay the property taxes 
and liability insurance, and to keep the land clear and free of debris 
while it most likely produces little or no income. Although land doesn’t 
require much upkeep compared with tenant-occupied property, it 
almost always does require financial feeding.
 
✓ Opportunity costs: Investing in land is a cash drain, and of course, pur-
chasing the land in the first place costs money. If you buy the land with 
cash, you have the opportunity cost of tying up your valuable capital 
(which could be invested elsewhere), but most likely you will put down 
30 to 40 percent in cash and finance the balance of the purchase price 
instead.
 
✓ Costly mortgages: Mortgage lenders require much higher down pay-
ments and charge higher loan fees and interest rates on loans to 
purchase land because they see it as a more speculative investment. 
Obtaining a loan for development of land is challenging and more expen-
sive than obtaining a loan for a developed property.
 
✓ Lack of depreciation: You don’t get depreciation tax write-offs because 
land isn’t depreciable.
The dangers of downzoning
Robert owned raw land for many years in an 
area where a recent government action effec-
tively downzoned his property from 4 acres to 
2 acres. The multi-species conservation act 
designated huge swaths of undeveloped land 
as mitigation habitat for “endangered plant and 
animal species.” This ordinance mandated that 
every parcel that wasn’t already fully devel-
oped was subject to a development limitation 
of 2 acres.
Luckily for Robert, he had subdivided the origi-
nal 20 acres into 4 smaller parcels of 4 to 5 
acres each or the entire 20 acres would’ve only 
been allowed usage of 2 acres. Still, Robert’s 4- 
to 5-acre parcels are now limited to 2 acres of 
development unless Robert pays a “mitigation 
fee” which is currently over $50,000 per acre! 
This story illustrates the dangers of buying and 
owning vacant real estate in areas where con-
servation activists are prevalent.

 Chapter 2: Covering Common Real Estate Investments
On the income side, some properties may be able to be used for parking, 
storage income, or maybe even growing Christmas trees in the Northwest or 
grain in the Midwest! (After you make sure you’ve complied with local zoning 
restrictions and have the proper insurance in place.)
 
Although large-scale land investment isn’t for the entry-level real estate inves-
tor, savvy real estate investors have made fortunes taking raw land and getting 
the proper entitlements and then selling (or better yet, subdividing and then 
selling) the parcels to developers of commercial and residential properties 
(primarily home builders). If you decide to invest in land, be sure that you:
 
✓ Do your homework. Ideally, you want to buy land in an area that’s 
attracting rapidly expanding companies and that has a shortage of 
housing and developable land. Take your time to really know the area. 
This isn’t a situation in which you should take a hot tip from someone 
to invest in faraway property in another state. Nor should you buy raw 
land just because you heard that irresistible opening bid price adver-
tised on the radio for the government excess land auction down at the 
convention center this Saturday.
 
✓ Know all the costs. Tally up your annual carrying costs (ongoing owner-
ship expenses such as property taxes) so that you can see what your 
annual cash drain may be. What are the financial consequences of this 
cash outflow — for example, will you be able to fully fund your tax-
advantaged retirement accounts? If you can’t, count the lost tax benefits 
as another cost of owning land.
 
✓ Determine what improvements the land may need. Running utility, 
water, and sewer lines; building roads; landscaping; and so on all cost 
money. If you plan to develop and build on the land that you purchase, 
research these costs. Make sure you don’t make these estimates with 
your rose-tinted sunglasses on — improvements almost always cost 
more than you expect them to. (You need to check with the planning or 
building department for their list of requirements.)
 
 Also make sure that you have access to the land or the right to enter 
and leave through a public right-of-way or another’s property (known as 
ingress and egress). Some people foolishly invest in landlocked proper-
ties. When they discover the fact later, they think that they can easily 
get an easement (legal permission to use someone else’s property). 
Wrong!

42

✓ Understand the zoning and environmental issues. The value of land is 
heavily dependent on what you can develop on it. Never purchase land 
without thoroughly understanding its zoning status and what you can 
and can’t build on it. This advice also applies to environmental limita-
tions that may be in place or that may come into effect without warning, 
diminishing the potential of your property (with no compensation).
 
 This potential for surprise is why you must research the disposition of 
the planning department and nearby communities. Attend the meetings 
of local planning groups, if any, because some areas that are antigrowth 
and antidevelopment are less likely to be good places for you to buy 
land, especially if you need permission to do the type of project that you 
have in mind. Through the empowerment of local residents who sit on 
community boards and can influence local government officials, zoning 
can suddenly change for the worse — sometimes you may find that 
your property has been downzoned — a zoning alteration that can sig-
nificantly reduce what you can develop on a property and therefore the 
property’s value. See the sidebar “The dangers of downzoning” in this 
chapter for more details.

M
any real estate investors actually start their real estate portfolio con-
ventionally by buying a home for their own use for a number of years 
and then purchasing a new home and renting out their first home. Other folks 
have found that the best way to quickly become a real estate investor is to 
purchase income-producing properties in a more unconventional manner.
In this chapter, we take a brief look at some of the most common of these 
methods of acquiring real estate investment properties or participating in the 
real estate market, and we tell you what we think about whether you should 
pursue these options. We start off with foreclosures, REOs, and lease options. 
We also cover some other, even more unusual ways to acquire real estate at 
below-market prices, such as probate sales and auctions. And besides REITs 
(discussed in Chapter 4), other avenues allow you to passively invest in real 
estate, including triple net properties, notes and trust deeds, and limited 
partnerships, which we also discuss.
Finding Foreclosures and REOs
Would you rather buy real estate at retail or at wholesale prices? Obviously 
the answer is “wholesale!” Just like in the stock market, the concept of buy 
low, sell high also applies to real estate.

One of the best ways to maximize your chances of earning a good return on 
your investment is to buy a property at foreclosure or as an REO. Such invest-
ments are generally a better value than a conventional purchase (but not with-
out some increased risk)!
And of course, other real estate investors are also scouring your local real 
estate market for great deals. Clearly, real estate investors flush with cash 
aren’t going to miss this opportunity. As an individual looking to buy just one 
or two foreclosure homes in your local market, you may be surprised to find 
that you’re competing with very large and sophisticated Wall Street venture 
funds with tens of millions of dollars that are buying pools of bad loans or 
foreclosed properties.
Foreclosures are simply properties for which the owner has failed to meet 
his loan payment or other loan term obligations, forcing the lender, if they 
want to get some of their money back, to take over legal ownership and con-
trol of the property (or foreclose and take title). Although more formal in a 
legal sense and more time consuming, a real estate foreclosure is similar to a 
lender repossessing the car from an owner who fails to make her monthly car 
payments.
After completing the foreclosure process, the lender takes title, at which 
point it owns the property. The lender has to maintain and manage the prop-
erty, so it turns the property over to asset managers in the lender’s in-house 
real estate owned (REO) department. The asset managers may keep the day-
to-day property management in-house as well, but most lenders hire local 
property management firms to inspect the property, repair any emergency 
items, and essentially operate the property until the lender can sell it — usu-
ally within a few months unless the borrower has redemption rights (see the 
“Redemption period” section later in the chapter). Some major lenders, like 
Bank of America, call the department holding their repossessed properties 
owned real estate operations (OREOs). No matter what the name, the savvy 
real estate investor willing to do the extensive due diligence required to find 
the rare diamonds in the rough will be rewarded.
Typically these properties are spruced up and then sold quickly for as close 
to the appraised value as possible. However, with the number of foreclosures 
so significant in certain areas of the country, unloading these properties will 
really hit lenders hard. Robert is seeing a growing trend towards lenders 
holding on to these properties and hiring local property management firms 
to not only spruce up the properties but also rent them for one to three years 
with the expectation that the market will improve and the lenders will recoup 
much of their loan values. This trend is particularly true with private lenders.
Public lenders, like most banks, don’t always have the flexibility of keeping 
these nonperforming assets on their books for regulatory reasons, but this 
is a solid strategy. Real estate investors may find fewer fire-sale bargains in 

45
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
the short run, but actually the recovery will be spread out over several years, 
and thus there will be a steady supply of reasonably priced rental properties 
as various lenders spin off some of these held assets.
 
When considering foreclosures and REOs, be sure to perform the necessary 
research:
 
✓ Inspect the property and determine the physical condition and the cost 
of any needed work. Be careful to rule out environmental concerns.
 
✓ Review a preliminary title report to see whether the property has any 
unpaid tax liens or encumbrances.
 
✓ Appraise the property and establish your target price and a firm maxi-
mum bid so that the emotions of bidding don’t lead you to overpay.
Foreclosures
The term foreclosure actually describes a process by which a lender takes 
title to a property on which a loan is in default. The two most common high-
risk mistakes homeowners make that lead to foreclosure are
 
✓ Failing to make the mortgage payments as required: For example, 
homeowners who overstretched and bought their homes using up to 
100 percent financing (they made little or no down payment towards the 
home’s purchase price) and were, in effect, living on the edge.
 
✓ Borrowing too much when refinancing: Low interest rates combined 
with the tremendous increase in real estate values in most parts of the 
country in the early- to mid-2000s led many homeowners to refinance 
their properties. Although there’s nothing wrong with refinancing, as 
long as you don’t borrow too much, some lenders promoted 110 to 120 
percent loans that tempted homeowners to pull all of their equity — and 
more — out of their homes. The recent trend towards no-documentation 
or stated-income loans also greatly contributed to the real estate mess 
of this period.
 
 The flawed theory was that real estate values only increased, so these 
folks were simply tapping their future equity. However, one slight stum-
ble with a loss of a job or a drop in income, a serious illness, death, or 
divorce can lead to a missed mortgage payment or two and ultimately, 
foreclosure. That’s what happened to millions of property owners who 
were overextended with mortgage debt when the real estate market 
turned against them in the late-2000s. Although some folks couldn’t 
afford to keep up with their payments, others chose to walk away from 
properties worth less than their outstanding mortgage balance.

46
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
But properties can also be subject to foreclosure for other reasons:
 
✓ Owners fail to meet other loan requirements. Examples include not 
maintaining proper insurance coverage or not keeping the property in 
good physical condition.
 
✓ Absentee owners are unable to effectively manage the property. Good 
property managers regularly visit and inspect their properties. This 
level of involvement isn’t practical from a distance.
 
 This category of foreclosures is extremely prevalent in many of the most 
popular real estate investment markets for out-of-town speculators such 
as Las Vegas and Phoenix. If you’re in these markets you may be able 
to pick up some great bargains, but don’t make the same mistake that 
the earlier investors made when they purchased properties out of their 
comfort zone.
 
✓ Owners walk away from serious problems. Some properties fall into 
foreclosure because the property has serious and irreversible problems 
that are so bad that the current owner chooses to walk away rather than 
deal with them. Environmental hazards and serious physical problems 
where the cost of repair can exceed the value of the property (such as 
cracked slabs) often top the list. (In Chapter 12, we cover research you 
can perform to help avoid these types of problems.)
Many foreclosure properties also fall into this category because some real 
estate investors felt that the market was so strong that literally any property 
they bought would increase in value. Although this may have been true to a 
certain extent in some markets for a couple of years, the reality is that inves-
tors who bought properties without conducting proper due diligence often 
found that they had purchased white elephants, or properties that they can’t 
sell for what they paid for them (or even rent out to cover their carrying costs).
More mortgage monkey business
Leading up to the mortgage crisis of 2008, lend-
ers often pushed borrowers toward piggyback 
loans, which are two or more loans (usually 
from different lenders) used to purchase a 
property. The three most popular piggyback 
loan programs are the 80-20-0; the 80-15-5; and 
the 80-10-10 loans. In each of these loan pro-
grams, the first number is an 80-percent first 
mortgage, the second number is the amount of 
the second mortgage, and the last number is 
the percentage of the purchase price the buyer 
paid in cash. The 80-10-10 loan (80 percent first, 
10 percent second, and 10 percent down) was 
especially popular because it was designed to 
save the borrower the added cost of private 
mortgage insurance (PMI).

47
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
 
Before you pursue foreclosure properties, determine the type of foreclosure 
process commonly used in your state. Check with your favorite lender, real 
estate agent, real estate attorney, or title company representative to find this 
information. Your state falls under one of two categories:
 
✓ Deed of trust state: When a loan is placed in a deed of trust state, the 
property title is held in the name of a third party or trustee. If the loan 
payments aren’t made as promised or the loan is in default for another 
reason, the trustee can foreclose or take back the property. No court 
action is necessary, so a foreclosure in a deed of trust state can happen 
in 60 to 120 days. This process is referred to as nonjudicial foreclosure.
 
 Be sure to check that you have the latest information on federal, state, 
and even local efforts by legislators and courts that have been quite 
aggressive in extending the timelines to give borrowers more time to 
avoid foreclosure.
 
✓ Mortgage state: In a mortgage state, no trustee or third party is named. 
When a mortgage goes into default for nonpayment or other breach, the 
holder of the mortgage must go to court and seek legal remedies includ-
ing judicial foreclosure, which can take much longer than a nonjudicial 
foreclosure.
 
Foreclosure properties aren’t that hard to find. Whether you’re in a deed of 
trust state or a mortgage state, the filing of a Notice of Default (NOD) or a 
judicial foreclosure lawsuit are matters of public record. An additional public 
notice announcing a pending foreclosure sale must be published in a local 
legal newspaper. The timing of the publication prior to the sale varies by state. 
Many title companies and real estate firms track the Notices of Default and all 
the steps right through to the actual foreclosure. This information is public 
record and filed with the county recorder or equivalent, but subscribe to one 
of the local services offering this information via daily or weekly e-mails or 
faxes, because gathering this information on your own is time consuming.
Technically, there are four steps, and thus four buying opportunities, for a 
property subject to the typical foreclosure process. Knowing these steps, 
which we outline in the following sections, and the techniques or negotiating 
points necessary at each step to motivate the owner or lender is essential to 
mastering one of the best strategies of buying real estate at below market or 
wholesale prices.
Preforeclosure
Every potential foreclosure begins when the owner misses a payment on her 
debt service or is notified in writing by the lender that a condition or term of 
her loan isn’t being met. The preforeclosure stage is the period of time before 
the lender formally files the Notice of Default, which triggers the legal foreclo-
sure process.

48
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
The period of time before the formal foreclosure begins is an important buying 
opportunity: You can get in ahead of competing investors to identify proper-
ties on which the owner is delinquent on mortgage payments or violating 
other conditions of her loan. The key is to track and locate these defaulting 
owners.
This is the time when you want to offer a solution to the owner that’ll get her 
out of the property and preserve her credit status so she can purchase prop-
erty in the future. Also, every owner facing a mortgage delinquency needs 
some cash to pay for moving and relocation costs. Understanding the motiva-
tion of the owner and lender can allow you to formulate an investment strat-
egy that meets everyone’s needs and allows you to own a property before it 
becomes heavily exposed on the local multiple listing service!
Notice of Default
The first formal legal action in the foreclosure process is the filing of a Notice 
of Default. If the owner wasn’t concerned when he first began missing loan 
payments, the filing of the Notice of Default should be a real wake-up call.
An owner who has received the Notice of Default is likely to be motivated to 
sell because she knows that the lender has begun the formal steps toward 
repossessing her property. But not all owners facing foreclosure are aware 
that the late charges, penalties, and hefty legal fees further erode their shaky 
financial position. They may not understand the logic that if they can’t make 
their regular monthly payments, they’re unlikely to catch up and pay all of 
the additional costs, which can literally double the delinquent amount.
 
The 60 to 90 days following the filing of the NOD are a great time to offer solu-
tions to an owner facing a foreclosure. Most owners truly believe that their 
financial problems are temporary, so make your offer sensitive to the fact 
that preserving the owner’s credit record is a key consideration: If you can 
buy the property quickly at a discount and then cure the default or pay off 
the delinquent mortgage, the seller only has the slow payments on his credit 
report rather than a foreclosure (or possibly a bankruptcy, which is often the 
only alternative for owners who are unwilling to voluntarily resolve their cash 
flow problems). Preserving credit has always been a key motivator to owners 
who are delinquent on their mortgage payments. However, legislative efforts 
in 2008 to forgive defaults have changed the dynamics significantly, and many 
homeowners are simply walking away with little concern that their credit will 
be an obstacle to entering the homeownership ranks at a future date.
Determine the loan balance and the value of the property to ensure that the 
owner has equity. Generally, the more equity the better, because this equity 
allows you to provide the owner with some quick cash so he can cover the 
costs of vacating the property and finding a new place to live. It’s also this 

49
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
equity in the property that provides you with a profit potential after all of 
your costs of acquisition plus the required repairs and upgrades to maximize 
the resale value of the property.
 
Some real estate gurus recommend that you simply offer a nominal amount of 
cash to the owner facing a default and then begin making the payments on the 
existing loans or, in other words, purchase the property subject to the current 
loans. Be wary that the lender may not allow you to just step into the shoes of 
the original borrower and may still declare the loan to be in default. Have your 
legal advisor (see Chapter 6) look for an assumption clause in the loan docu-
ments that would allow you to properly assume the loan. Usually this process 
requires a loan application and a fee. You may also want to watch out for a 
due on sale clause that accelerates the entire loan and makes it due immedi-
ately upon the transfer of the property to a new owner. Foreclosure transac-
tions aren’t risk free; your legal advisor can tell you the potential downside of 
your proposed transaction with a defaulting buyer.
 
Many of the problems that occur in buying foreclosures can be avoided by 
structuring the purchase offer to require the owner to vacate the property 
immediately. It’s difficult for an owner to lose her home, and it’s often even 
more difficult for her to accept the fact that she’s no longer the owner when 
she’s still living in the property.
Foreclosure sale
Although the foreclosure process varies from state to state, the main differ-
ence is whether the loan is secured with a mortgage that requires a judicial 
foreclosure or by a deed of trust, in which case the nonjudicial process is 
used (for an introduction to these two types of states, see the beginning of 
this section).
 
✓ Judicial foreclosure: In a judicial foreclosure, the lender files a lawsuit 
against the borrower to get the property. Like any other lawsuit, it begins 
with the serving of a summons and complaint upon the borrower (along 
with any other parties with junior liens or encumbrances against the 
property). If the borrower responds, the court holds a hearing and rules 
that either the borrower has presented a legitimate issue (and alternate 
payment terms are arranged) or the lender is permitted to foreclose.
 
 The most common scenario is that the borrower doesn’t respond and 
the lender receives a judgment by default and can proceed to have a ref-
eree appointed by the court. The lender then advertises the sale for four 
to six weeks and then, if full payment hasn’t been made, a public sale is 
held, typically on the courthouse or town/city hall steps. The time frame 
for this entire judicial foreclosure process is usually between 4 and 6 
months, although the process can take as little as 3 months to as long as 
12 months.

50
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
✓ Nonjudicial foreclosure: In a nonjudicial foreclosure state, lenders are 
allowed to foreclose without a lawsuit, using the power of sale provi-
sions of the deed of trust. The deed of trust actually has three parties 
to the original loan agreement — the borrower (grantor), the lender 
(beneficiary), and the trustee who actually holds title during the term of 
the loan. In the event the borrower defaults, the trustee files a Notice of 
Default and a Notice of Sale in a legal newspaper.
 
 As with the judicial foreclosure, if the loan in a nonjudicial foreclosure 
isn’t fully reinstated prior to the date and time of the trustee’s sale, the 
public auction or sheriff’s sale occurs on the steps of a prominent public 
location in town such as a courthouse. If no one bids, the lender bids 
the amount of its loan plus accrued penalties and fees and takes title to 
the property. This is the most common scenario unless the property is 
desirable and has equity, in which case many interested bidders may 
compete in a free-for-all.
 
Bidding on and purchasing properties at the foreclosure sale can be exciting 
and even profitable if you do your homework and know everything about a 
property before you bid. But getting a little lazy or going with your gut feeling 
can lead to a disaster, and it often takes quite a few home runs to offset even 
one disaster. Something as simple as an unrecorded tax lien or latent physical 
problems like a cracked slab or expansive soil can turn your lemonade back 
into a lemon! Be sure to get a title report showing clear title and an owner’s 
title insurance policy.
Redemption period
Some states allow the borrower the right to redeem her property after the 
sale during a redemption period in which she can pay the full amount owed, 
including the loan balance, late charges, legal fees incurred by the lender, 
and all of the costs of sale, and get title to the property back. The length 
of the redemption period varies from state to state. This period is also an 
opportunity to reach an agreement with the borrower for her deed. If suc-
cessful, the purchaser then essentially obtains the borrower’s redemption 
rights and has the right to redeem the property.
 
Even if you’re the successful purchaser at the foreclosure sale, you still have 
to give the borrower the opportunity to redeem the property per the state-
required redemption period. Don’t make significant improvements only to 
have the borrower redeem the property and then thank you for renovating his 
distressed property from the worst on the block to the model home!
Because the majority of properties at a foreclosure sale end up with the 
lender (because most properties aren’t desirable investment properties at 
this time due to foreclosure risks and limited due diligence, as we discuss 
in this section), you have a great opportunity to make a deal with the lender 
just after the foreclosure sale and before they’ve incurred the expense of 
hiring an agent to market and sell the property.

51
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
 
You may also be able to make a better deal if the property has significant 
deferred maintenance or code violations, because the local building inspector or 
code enforcement departments know when a deep-pocketed lender has title to 
the property, and they expect all citations for substandard conditions or code 
violations to be corrected immediately. You may be able to relieve the lender 
of this liability while allowing yourself to negotiate a favorable transaction.
Lender REO (Real Estate Owned)
Because titles to the majority of foreclosed properties end up with the 
lender, you may find that your next opportunity to purchase the property 
is from the lender’s real estate owned (REO) department that specializes 
in handling foreclosed properties. Some investors have found that this is 
one of the best times to buy a property because they’re not dealing with an 
emotional or unreliable owner. Discovering the ins and outs of the lenders’ 
policies and procedures of disposing of these foreclosed properties can be 
invaluable to your goal of buying real estate at below market prices.
The days of stealing prime REO properties from the Resolution Trust 
Corporation (RTC) are gone. The RTC was a quasi-federal government entity 
established by congress to dispose of the tremendous number of foreclosed 
assets of the major lenders during the real estate market downturn in the 
early ’90s. Due to the numbers of properties and the relative inexperience of 
and limited due diligence by the RTC in some areas of the country, a once-in-
a-lifetime real estate investment opportunity did fall into the lap of savvy real 
estate investors who had large amounts of cash, could act quickly, and then 
had the financial horsepower to ride out the market downturn.
Lender REOs remain one of the favorite strategies for the late-night infomer-
cial gurus, but the reality is that the lenders are neither foolish nor benevo-
lent. Although these nonperforming loans are a negative on their balance 
sheet, they’re not going to sell a property below its market value just to get it 
off their books.
The ethics of foreclosures
One of the most difficult moral dilemmas facing 
real estate investors is the ethics of negotiat-
ing with an owner facing a foreclosure. Are you 
helping her or are you a vulture seeking to profit 
upon the misfortune of another? You must walk 
a fine line in many of these situations.
Although there’s some value to a distressed 
seller in a quick transaction that provides 
needed cash, pushing too hard for a bargain 
can be unethical. Robert uses the “pillow test” 
to guide his conscience: Can you fall asleep at 
night and not feel guilty about your moral and 
ethical conduct?

52
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
The disposition specialists in the REO department are professionals who 
understand the real estate markets well and are usually wired into the 
best real estate brokers in the market. These real estate brokers are often 
compensated as a percentage of the sales price and thus also motivated to 
achieve the highest value as is reasonably possible.
The only angle a real estate investor usually has with an REO is financing and 
the continued operating losses that often occur because the lender is merely 
holding the property and isn’t willing to invest the time and money necessary 
to enhance the property physically and reposition it to perform better in the 
market.
 
Sales are as-is, and lenders are often exempt from the standard disclosure 
rules.
When lenders have an excessive number of REOs, they become more flexible, 
but they’re often limited by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a govern-
ment agency that oversees many savings banks and savings and loan associa-
tions and routinely audits their loan portfolio and their REOs.
Getting a Jump On Foreclosure and 
REO Competition with Short Sales
Savvy real estate investors know that the best properties are the ones that 
aren’t exposed to the open market where the competition has a chance to drive 
up the price. They also know that the best deals can be made with motivated 
FHA/VA repos
Government agencies such as the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guarantee 
loans made by lenders to qualified individuals. 
When these home buyers fail to make their pay-
ments, the lender goes through the foreclosure 
process and ultimately repossesses the house. 
The government pays the lender the guaran-
teed loan amount and then takes possession of 
the property.
These FHA and VA repos are then listed for sale 
through real estate agents approved by the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD). Typically, real estate investors don’t find 
these properties as attractive as some other 
real estate investment opportunities, because 
they’re usually offered at or just a shade under 
market prices. Qualified first-time home buyers 
should look for these FHA/VA repos, because 
they’re often available with favorable financing, 
including low, or no, down payments.

53
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
sellers — and there’s not much stronger motivation for a house seller than to 
know that they’ll soon lose their property to foreclosure and find their credit 
ruined.
These homeowners don’t have any equity, and the existing debt on the prop-
erty exceeds the current loan balance. If the owners were to sell the prop-
erty, they would owe the lender more money than they’d receive from the 
sale. In the late-2000s real estate market downturn, this was true for increas-
ing numbers of properties. This is the concept and strategy behind short 
sales. A short sale occurs when you buy a property from the owner and have 
an agreement with the lender or lien holder that it will accept an amount that 
is less than its loan balance as payment in full.
Recognizing seller benefits
With the advent of subprime and zero-down-payment loans in the mid-2000s, 
combined with the decline in home values, many owners found that they had 
negative equity in their homes in the late-2000s; they literally couldn’t afford 
to sell the properties because the sale proceeds wouldn’t cover the loan bal-
ance (a situation known as being upside down).
Many of these owners had other financial challenges and little savings to fall 
back on, so they were unlikely to be able or willing to continue making their 
debt service payments on the upside down property. An owner in this situa-
tion is a prime candidate for a short sale.
The current owner or seller receives no proceeds from a short sale but will 
find it a quick exit strategy from a troubling situation, with the goal of mini-
mizing damage to his credit (because he will likely want to be a homeowner 
again someday). Another benefit to the current owner is that the real estate 
investor is likely looking for a great tenant, and who would be a better tenant 
than the current occupant of the property? The current owner may no longer 
own the property, but he can at least continue to live there and not disrupt 
his life completely. Being able to remain in the property also avoids some of 
the stigma of losing the house. Plus, immediately having a tenant can help 
you get a loan for the property.
Comparing short sales to other properties
Many real estate investors find that buying foreclosures or REO properties 
can be challenging. With foreclosures, the public sale is published and read-
ily known to all interested real estate investors, but there is limited informa-
tion and rarely an adequate opportunity to conduct proper due diligence. 
Foreclosure properties can be full of surprises!

54
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
You often find that the best properties at the foreclosure auction attract the 
attention of other (often sophisticated) buyers who are prepared to pay more 
for the property than you are if they know they can make a good deal down 
the road. You also need to have 10 percent of the purchase price in cash and 
immediately have to find a loan for the balance within 30 days, whereas with 
the short sale you can usually negotiate for a sale closing date that gives you 
more time to find financing. A short sale also helps you avoid the complica-
tions of a borrower redemption possible with a judicial foreclosure.
Tracking down the property information for REO properties can be challeng-
ing, and the lenders or their agents may not be cooperative with requests 
for inspections or details about the condition of the property. Though the 
reputation for REOs is that lenders are anxious to sell these properties at any 
price, the reality is that they often go for pretty close to the full market value 
when discounted for the condition and quick sale terms that they require.
 
Find properties that are in preforeclosure — that is, properties where the 
owner is delinquent on her debt service payments — and make a deal to buy 
the property from the owner before she loses it anyway and ruins her credit. 
These situations became more common with the excessive use of highly lever-
aged financing where borrowers had loans that were equal to (or even greater 
than) the full value of the property when it was acquired. Some borrowers took 
out second loans, and the combined debt exceeded the value of the property.
Finding short-sale opportunities
The concept sounds much easier than it is to actually execute. The main 
problem is trying to identify the properties where the owner of the property 
is behind on payments but the lender hasn’t filed a Notice of Default.
With foreclosures, you can generally find lists available from real estate 
agents and even the lenders themselves, or you can drive through the neigh-
borhoods that appeal to you and find signs that say “bank owned”. But with 
preforeclosure properties that are still owner-occupied and candidates for 
a short sale, there may not be an indication that anything is wrong. This is 
particularly true with many lenders now being asked to be extra patient with 
borrowers who are a little behind on their mortgage payments.
If you’re looking for these opportunities, there are many ways to find them. 
Some companies specialize in assisting homeowners who know they’ll have 
difficulty in making their mortgage payments; they work with the owners and 
the lenders to try and make loan modifications or alternative payment plans. 
These attempts may be successful, but many times they aren’t, and they pro-
vide one source for identifying owners who are short-sale candidates.

55
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
Another way to identify potential short sale properties is when the mortgage 
holder sends a Notice of Default. But this document is public information, so 
many other real estate investors may be in contact with the owner seeking to 
arrange a short sale.
Just like in a regular foreclosure, you can find this information, and in the 
early days of the preforeclosure period many buyers may be willing to con-
sider a short sale. Of course, you need to convince the lender and not just 
the current owner.
 
Note that lien holders may have purchased the underlying loan at a discount, 
and they may be more willing to negotiate with you to accept less money, 
which will enhance the prospects of a sale of the property. Your research will 
often reveal whether the loan that is in default has recently been sold; this is 
important information that can assist you with your negotiating strategy.
 
The concept of short sales often comes up if you have foreclosures in your 
area, but be careful: You need to check out the property just as thoroughly. 
You actually should have a better opportunity and better access to the prop-
erty. It’s not as bad as with foreclosure properties, but it has been our experi-
ence that short sale properties can also be properties that the owner is willing 
to walk away from for a reason. So be very careful because what may seem 
like the deal of the century may actually be a money pit.
Convincing a lender to agree 
to a short sale
In addition to the difficulty inherent in finding an opportunity for a short sale, 
you may also have a difficult time convincing the lender to agree to a short 
sale. The recent trend by the federal government has been to require lenders 
to work with borrowers at an unprecedented level of patience and coopera-
tion. Some lenders become overwhelmed with the large numbers of nega-
tive equity loans and the thousands of requests they receive to restructure 
financing. On one hand, lenders are motivated to consider short sales, but 
they’re also under pressure to formulate a workout strategy with the current 
borrower. This trend may actually reduce the motivation for lenders to coop-
erate with short sales.
The viability of short sales is really a function of the lenders and their busi-
ness strategies to minimize their losses. The lenders know that the payments 
aren’t being made and it’s inevitable that they’ll complete the foreclosure, 
have to hold the property for some period, and incur costs before they ulti-
mately sell it.

56
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
If they have a large number of nonperforming loans on their books, they may 
be motivated to quickly make a few short-sale deals. However, our experi-
ence has been that some lenders with few delinquent loans are actually more 
willing to agree to a buyer proposing a short sale because they want to cut 
their losses quickly and not risk government intervention or negative public-
ity. Lenders that participate in short sales are always secretive about it too.
One recent legislative change that has really helped owners of properties 
who want to work out a short sale is the Mortgage Forgiveness Act of 2007. 
Previously, mortgage debt that was forgiven or canceled by a lender had to 
be included on the borrower’s tax return as taxable income. Under this new 
law, any loan that was used to buy, build, or substantially improve the bor-
rower’s principal residence (not second homes or investment properties) 
qualifies for the exemption from taxation as ordinary income. A refinance 
loan for the same purposes also qualifies. The lender is required to report 
the debt cancellation to the IRS on Form 1099-C, and the borrower must file 
Form 982. This law is scheduled to expire as of January 1, 2010, but may be 
extended. Be sure to seek the advice of your tax professional before agreeing 
to any short sale.
You need to send the lender a short sale package with the following 
information:
 
✓ A hardship letter or proof from the borrower that he is unable to con-
tinue to make mortgage payments.
 
✓ Copies of the borrower’s income tax returns.
 
✓ Information on the current condition of the property with contractor 
estimates or proposals to make any needed repairs property.
 
✓ The estimated value of the property and your offer for the property.
Short sales in Hollywood
The short-sale concept has received a lot of 
notoriety, and late-night gurus promote semi-
nars touting that they can teach you every-
thing you need to know about short sales. Even 
Donald Trump has gotten into the game. Trump 
made the headlines when he proposed a short 
sale to help retired TV host Ed McMahon and 
his wife from losing their home in Beverly Hills. 
The McMahons were apparently $643,597 
behind in payments on their $4.8 million loan. 
The Donald offered to buy the house, with 
Countrywide Home Loans taking a discounted 
payoff, and allow the McMahons to continue to 
live in the property as renters. Ultimately, the 
parties reached another solution, but this was 
a well-known example of how the short sale 
process works.

57
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
The lender will want to verify current market conditions where the loan 
balance is greater than the current value of the property. They’ll obtain a 
Broker’s Price Opinion (BPO) or quick appraisal of the property. This figure 
acts as the basis for their negotiations with you, with the goal of achieving as 
close as possible to the BPO.
The one common denominator to short sales with all lenders is that short 
sales require a lot of phone calls and investigative legwork to even find out 
whether the lender is open to receiving an offer for less than the current 
loan balance. Each lender has a different organizational structure for various 
individuals or departments that handle non-performing loans. Some lenders 
have automated phone systems that can be helpful and allow you to get right 
through to people you need; others are best described as “voice mail jail.” 
Live operators are probably already familiar with what you’re looking for, 
and you just need to describe that the purpose of your call is to find some-
one in charge of loss mitigation or foreclosures. If all else fails, you should 
contact the customer service department and ask to speak to someone who 
is authorized to make sales on preforeclosure properties. Have the property 
address and the borrower name and loan number (if available).
These transactions aren’t likely, and are a sure bet to take at least 30 to 90 days 
(or even more) because most lenders are now much more inclined to work 
with the current borrower if at all possible. Our advice is that short sales can 
be effective in limited circumstances and only if you have the ability to reach a 
decision-maker at a lender that is inclined to participate. The real estate inves-
tor looking for just one property may find that the effort exceeds the return 
and that there are better ways to locate and purchase rental properties.
 
Don’t forget that with short sales, you need to have some cash as well as be 
preapproved for loans so that you can make deals quickly. Lenders that are 
willing to agree to short sales are going to require all cash and won’t be will-
ing to offer any sort of financing. Lenders that are likely to be sources of funds 
for your loan on a short sale are going to be selective about making loans on 
non-owner-occupied rental properties. Your credit worthiness and having 
an established banking relationship is helpful if you’re going to be successful 
with buying short sales.
Looking Into Lease Options
A lease option is an excellent way to control and eventually purchase a prop-
erty without the significant cash investment in a down payment. A lease 
option is essentially two different types of contracts combined into a single 
agreement. You have a lease (rental agreement), which has all of the usual 
terms, but the tenant also has the unilateral right to buy the property under 
certain terms and conditions in the future.

58
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
A lease option obligates the owner to sell the property but doesn’t obligate 
the tenant to buy. This is a unilateral contract until the tenant exercises the 
option and a bilateral contract is created. One of the key issues with lease 
options is the option price (purchase price) that the buyer must pay. This 
figure can be a fixed price based on current market value, but often it’s a 
future projected value based on anticipated appreciation with set time limits 
for exercising the option. For example, a home valued at $200,000 today 
may be offered as a lease option with an option price of $210,000 that can be 
exercised anytime in the next 12 months in a market where the seller expects 
appreciation of 5 percent per year. Of course, a savvy buyer doesn’t exercise 
the option if the option price exceeds the market value of the property.
Lease options are much easier to find, and much more favorable deals can be 
made, when there are limited buyers, and sellers are anxious to sell. Lease 
options are most commonly used with single-family homes and condos, but 
the concept can be used with any type of property. Overall, in virtually all 
areas of the country, the demand for lease options is greater than the supply.
Remember that lease options aren’t just a great way for real estate inves-
tors to buy property; they’re also an opportunity for many first-time home 
buyers to ease into home owning. They’re often in high demand relative to 
their supply, so lease options are rarely advertised; you may even need to 
run your own ad seeking lease options. Another way to track down a possible 
lease option is to respond to ads for “house for rent.” When you own a prop-
erty that you want to use a lease option to sell, a small ad often brings a large 
response. Check out Chapter 16 for more information on using a lease option 
as an exit strategy.
Probing Probate Sales and Auctions
A discussion of the more unusual real estate investments must include pro-
bate or sales of properties in estates. Also, auctions are becoming a more 
popular way to dispose of real estate, particularly because of the continued 
expansion of the Internet.
Probate sales
Even more reliable than taxes, death creates opportunities for the purchase 
of good real estate at attractive prices. Every day someone in your area dies 
and leaves behind real estate that his heirs may not have any desire to retain. 
These properties are sold in probate sales by executors of the estate with the 
assistance of probate attorneys (or by the public administrator if the owner 
dies without a trust or will).

59
 Chapter 3: Considering Foreclosures, REOs, Probate Sales, and More
Know the laws and rules regarding probate sales in your area, because wait-
ing periods and even court confirmation may be required before the sale is 
finalized. Also, these sales are often subject to overbids. A potential buyer 
can use the overbid process to appeal directly to the court (before the court 
issues the order approving the probate sale) to outbid you and purchase the 
property for more than the current offer under consideration. Generally, the 
right to overbid requires an offer that exceeds the existing offer by at least 5 
percent. Be aware that this possibility exists, and be prepared to raise your 
bid. Just be careful not to get caught up in a bidding war and overpay for a 
property. Set a maximum price for yourself before you begin bidding.
Robert has a friend who bought a one-of-a-kind beachfront property in San 
Diego at significantly below market value from the estate of an elderly gentle-
man who died and left the property to his son. Apparently, the son had no 
interest in living near the ocean because of the noise and traffic that accompa-
nies beachfront properties. So, the son contacted a real estate broker. He was 
anxious to sell the property, including the house and two rental units, for not 
much more than the value of the land alone. The real estate broker and Robert’s 
friend were surfing buddies and because the broker owed Robert’s friend a 
favor, the broker was glad to give him the first shot at this once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity!
Real estate auctions
Real estate auctions, in which companies claim to be selling prime real 
estate at below-market prices, have become one of the most popular ways 
for builders and investors to market their excessive inventory of properties 
in some areas. Don’t confuse these auctions with the foreclosure sales that 
are referred to as auctions in some regions. We’re talking about public auc-
tions where antiques or collectibles may also be sold on the same afternoon. 
In strong real estate markets, even new home builders have turned to pri-
vate auctions to sell their new homes in an attempt to generate interest and 
excitement in areas where demand is low.
Private individuals, government entities, and companies that specialize in 
auctions all use this method of selling real estate to the public. You can 
often find real estate auctioneers listed in your local yellow pages. Like any 
auction, the goal is to generate interest and competition among potential 
purchasers in order to drive up the sales price. Often a minimum or reserve 
price is set to protect the seller from giving the property away too cheaply.
These real estate auctions are promoted heavily in newspapers, on radio and 
television, and on the Internet with sample prices that sound enticing. They 
claim to have all types of properties and usually promote a few irresistible-
sounding properties — like 10 acres of pristine land for only $5,000. Of 
course, who knows how far out into the boonies the property is located?

60
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
Our experience is that auctions are rarely great opportunities for investors, 
because too many people compete for the unusual, quality property. Plus, the 
reserve or minimum prices are set so close to the actual market value of the 
property that the buyer essentially pays retail under the illusion that she’s 
buying at wholesale. But some good opportunities do arise now and then, so 
check out these auctions to see if you can find anything worth pursuing.
If you do find a property of interest in an auction, follow the same thorough 
due diligence process that applies to foreclosures and REOs (see “Finding 
Foreclosures and REOs” earlier in this chapter).
Unfortunately, proper due diligence isn’t always possible due to the short 
time frame available before the sale or because the auctioneer doesn’t pro-
vide enough information. For example, the best way to minimize the possibil-
ity that the property contains some costly environmental hazards is to have 
a professional firm prepare a Phase I environmental report (see Chapter 12). 
But you’re unlikely to be able to afford one for every property that interests 
you at an auction. This is just one example of the dangers in buying proper-
ties without a thorough and exhaustive due diligence investigation, so don’t 
be rushed. Real estate is one investment that you can’t easily get out of if you 
make a mistake. Remember — you don’t want any surprises!
If you’re the lucky buyer, you must immediately produce a certified funds 
check for at least 10 percent of the purchase price. Your final closing date 
usually falls within the next 30 days.
 
The Internet is the preferred method of promoting real estate auctions. As 
with many Internet opportunities, great care should be taken to ensure that 
you’re dealing with a reputable firm. Never even consider buying any real 
estate sight unseen no matter how good the deal seems!

Taking the Passive Approach

▶ Researching real estate investment trusts (REITs)
▶ Considering tenants in common realty investments
▶ Exploring triple net properties
▶ Understanding tax lien certificate sales
▶ Looking at limited partnerships
M
any investors want the diversification and solid returns offered by 
real estate but aren’t qualified for or interested in actively managing 
their real estate holdings. These real estate investors often look for invest-
ment opportunities that require no management or even minimal interaction 
with a property manager. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are probably 
the easiest to understand and access, but other avenues allow you to pas-
sively invest in real estate, including tenants in common, triple net proper-
ties, notes and trust deeds, tax lien certificate sales, and limited partnerships.
Current federal tax laws favor real estate investments in which the real estate 
investors qualify as active investors, and this book focuses on real estate 
investment strategies that qualify as active activities in order to garner the 
full tax benefits. If you’re seeking a passive investment, though, this chapter 
is for you.
Using Real Estate Investment Trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are for-profit companies that own and 
generally operate different types of property, such as shopping centers, 
apartments, offices, warehouses, hotels, and other rental buildings (see 
Figure 4-1). These property-holding REITs are known as equity REITs. Some 
REITs, known as mortgage REITs, focus on the financing end of the business; 
they lend to real estate property owners and operators or provide credit indi-
rectly through buying loans (mortgage backed securities).

Equity REIT managers typically identify and negotiate the purchase of prop-
erties that they believe are good investments and manage these properties 
directly or through an affiliated advisory and management company, includ-
ing all tenant relations. Thus, REITs can be a good way to invest in real estate 
for people who don’t want the hassles and headaches that come with directly 
owning and managing rental property.
Distinguishing between public 
and private REITs
We recommend that investors not be shy about asking for full disclosure of 
the relationship between the REIT, its advisors, and the management com-
panies. REITs often involve conflicts of interest that aren’t clearly disclosed 
or pay significant above-market fees that ultimately lower the cash flow and 
return on investment available for distribution.
Public REITs are traded on the major stock exchanges and thus must meet 
strict SEC reporting requirements:
 
✓ Liquidity: Public REITs trade every business day on a stock exchange and 
thus offer investors the ability to buy and sell as they please. Of course, as 
with other similarly liquid investments (like stock in companies in a vari-
ety of industries), liquidity can have its downside. More-liquid real estate 
investments like REITs may inspire frequent trades caused by making 
emotional decisions or trying to time market movements.
 
✓ Independent board of directors: A public company must have direc-
tors, the majority of whom are independent of its management. 
Shareholders vote upon and elect these directors.
 
✓ Financial reporting: Public REITs, like other public companies, must file 
comprehensive financial reports quarterly.

63
 Chapter 4: Taking the Passive Approach
 
We recommend that you stay away from private REITs unless you’re a sophis-
ticated, experienced real estate investor willing to do plenty of extra research 
and digging. Because they’re not publicly traded, private REITs don’t have the 
same disclosure requirements as public REITs. This difference means an 
investor in a private REIT had better carefully scrutinize the prospectus and 
realize that the private REIT has the ability to make changes that may not be 
in the investor’s best interests but that reward the private REIT sponsors or 
their affiliates.
Taking a look at performance
So what about performance? Over the long term, REITs have produced total 
returns comparable to stocks in general. In fact, over the past 35 years, REIT 
returns have actually been higher. In the context of an overall investment 
portfolio, REITs add diversification because their values don’t always move 
in tandem with other investments.
 
For investments that move perfectly in lock step, their beta or correlation 
to the overall stock market is 1. For investments always moving in opposite 
directions, the correlation is 0. Over the long term, the correlation between 
stocks and REITs has been about 0.6 (which is about the level of correlation 
between foreign stocks and U.S. stocks).
One final attribute of REITs we want to highlight is the fairly substantial divi-
dends that REITs usually pay. Because these dividends are generally fully tax-
able (and thus not subject to the lower stock dividend tax rate), you should 
generally avoid holding REITs outside of retirement accounts if you’re in a 
high tax bracket (for instance, during your working years).
 
In case you care, and you may well not, the reason for the high dividends is 
the legal requirement in REIT charters that they have to distribute 95 percent 
of their income. In other words, REITs can legally only retain a maximum of 5 
percent of their net income; they must distribute everything else to the 
shareholders.
Investing in REIT funds
 
You can research and purchase shares in individual REITs, which trade as 
securities on the major stock exchanges. An even better approach is to buy a 
mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that invests in a diversified mixture of 
REITs. Some of the best REIT mutual funds charge 1 percent per year or less 
in management fees. Vanguard’s REIT index fund charges just 0.20 percent per 

64
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
year in fees and has produced average annual returns of 12.3 percent since 
its inception in 1996. (An exchanged-traded version of this index fund offers 
an even lower-cost approach to investing with a wafer thin 0.1 percent annual 
operating fee.)
In addition to providing you with a diversified, low-hassle real estate invest-
ment, REITs offer an additional advantage that traditional rental real estate 
doesn’t. You can easily invest in REITs through a retirement account such 
as an IRA or Keogh. As with traditional real estate investments, you can even 
buy REITs and mutual fund REITs with borrowed money (in nonretirement 
accounts). You can buy with 50 percent down, known as buying on margin, 
when you purchase such investments through a brokerage account.

tax statements for each and every REIT you’re invested in.
Tenants in Common
Tenants in common (TIC) real estate investments have been heavily promoted 
as the common man’s opportunity to own a piece of institutional-grade, (com-
monly known as trophy) properties that the average investor could never 
acquire on her own. Due to a March 2002 IRS real estate tax ruling, tenants in 
common real estate ownership has been gaining momentum.
Tenants in common ownership is arranged by sponsors that form a TIC 
investment group for each property; each individual investor actually 
receives a title deed for an undivided fractional share in a large institutional-
grade property. The TIC sponsors either already have purchased or at least 
control these properties. TIC sponsored properties available for investment 
include regional shopping malls, large luxury apartment buildings, or even 
class A (with the best-quality locations, construction, and finishes) high-rise 
office buildings in major metropolitan areas.
These TIC investments do have some limitations: For instance, there are 
often limits on the number of investors (usually 35, and married couples 
count as a single investor) and their financial strength; each investor is 
proportionately responsible for the debt on the property, if any; and each 
owner must actually hold a specific fractional deeded interest in the prop-
erty. All owners must share and pay all profits and losses proportionately, 
and the TIC sponsor can’t advance funds to cover any expenses. The IRS also 
requires each owner to have a vote equal to his percentage of ownership.
 
Don’t feel too confident about your voting rights, because you probably own 
only a small percentage (sometimes as little as 1 or 2 percent of the total prop-
erty); you may find that the majority make decisions about management and 
leasing. Plus, the IRS requires unanimous approval of all co-owners to borrow 
against the property or sell — which may or may not coincide with your goals 
and needs.

66
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
Our advice is that although TICs provide some advantages for real estate inves-
tors seeking passive tax-sheltered income, new real estate investors and those 
with modest assets who may need to liquidate or sell their interest should 
avoid this investment for now because the current TIC offerings are typically 
overpriced retail investments with extremely high sales commissions and 
costs. We believe that this relatively new product will evolve and, with more 
offerings from additional market players, the properties will become more 
competitively priced and the commissions and costs will fall significantly.
Paying for 1031 availability and 
“hassle free” management
These investment vehicles can be right for certain investors with significant 
net worth and no desire to directly own real estate — as long as they fully 
understand the benefits and drawbacks. The minimum investment for most 
TICs is measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, although some TIC 
sponsors offer fractionalized ownership for as little as $50,000.
Traditionally, owners with significant equity can use a tax-deferred exchange 
(also known as a 1031 exchange) to either sell or exchange into a larger prop-
erty, or simply continue to hold and refinance the highly appreciated prop-
erty to generate cash for additional real estate investments, which also offer 
additional tax benefits. But TIC candidates are usually real estate owners cur-
rently in or contemplating a tax-deferred exchange that are facing the strict 
time limits and haven’t been able to find a suitable property on their own. 
(See Chapter 18 for a discussion of the tax-deferred exchange.)
 
If you’re considering a TIC as an alternative for your tax-deferred exchange, 
verify in advance with your tax advisor that your transaction qualifies. A tax-
deferred exchange is limited to like-kind property with specific rules about 
how you hold title of both the relinquished and replacement properties. If the 
property being sold is directly owned, the transaction most likely meets the 
requirements and isn’t taxable at the time of sale as long as the TIC property 
is a direct ownership of real estate and not a security. But many investors may 
find that the property they’re selling is a partnership interest in real estate 
and doesn’t qualify for the tax-deferred treatment because the two invest-
ments aren’t like-kind. Obtaining competent legal and tax advice in advance is 
essential, or you may have a very unpleasant surprise when the IRS declares 
that your transaction is fully taxable.
However, the TIC sponsors have targeted these owners of highly appreciated 
properties who are considering a tax-deferred exchange but are at a stage in 
their lives in which they’re not interested in expanding their real estate empire. 
Or they may have used all of the tax benefits of depreciation (see Chapter 18) 
and really should sell their property and simply pay the capital gains.

67
 Chapter 4: Taking the Passive Approach
A downside of these TIC investments is that they’re often extremely expen-
sive. Because the majority of the potential purchasers for these real estate 
investments are coming out of a tax-deferred exchange, they’re subject to 
tight time limits. The IRS requires 1031 exchanges to identify the replacement 
property within 45 days of the close of escrow of the property being sold. 
And the replacement property transaction must be completed within 180 
days. Please see Chapter 18 for more details.
Thus, the syndicators of the tenants in common product are always stand-
ing by with a pending real estate acquisition for those buyers whose time 
limits are running short and who need to identify and close on a property 
within the time limits imposed by the IRS. If the owner is unable to meet the 
deadlines, they lose all of the tax deferral benefits, so they’re often willing to 
overpay. The TIC sponsors know that many real estate investors panic and 
commit to real estate investments that aren’t prudent or suited to them just 
to avoid paying the capital gains tax.
In exchange for this flexibility and readily available product, the syndicators 
have prepurchased these properties and roll them over to the tenants in 
common investors at a higher price. Further, the syndicators usually asso-
ciate with financial advisors who receive hefty sales commissions of 3 to 5 
percent and even as high as 10 percent of the investors’ initial investment, 
plus a spread to the TIC sponsor to cover their internal marketing and admin-
istration costs. Then many TIC sponsors have separate “advisory firms” that 
are closely held by the principals of the sponsor, and they commonly charge 
upfront, plus ongoing, consulting fees. Thus, the purchaser of a tenants in 
common real estate investment is paying top dollar for the property and is 
only receiving the benefit of as little as 90 percent of her gross investment 
because of commissions and fees paid upfront.
The TIC sales pitch also places a heavy emphasis on the desirability of elimi-
nating the trials and tribulations often associated with an owner trying to 
manage his own property. TIC sponsored properties are professionally man-
aged by the sponsor or a property manager of their choice.
Asking the right questions: 
Are TICs for you?
Be aware that TIC sponsors often provide attractive teaser rates of return 
that are guaranteed only for the first couple of years. For example, a review 
of the private placement offering may indicate that investors will receive a 7 
percent cash distribution per year for the first two years only. This rate may 
potentially entice investors who have built up significant equity in their real 
estate holdings but haven’t seen their cash flow increase as fast.

68
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
Also, like many other financial products, a lot of effort goes into the promotion 
and sales of TICs, often through independent investment advisors, which 
translates to a lot of overhead to cover. You typically get slick marketing mate-
rials and are referred to fancy Web sites or supposedly free seminars reminis-
cent of the late-night infomercial gurus. These promotional efforts are high on 
fluff and scarce on details.
You need to determine whether TICs are right for you by asking your invest-
ment advisor and the TIC sponsor for written answers to some basic ques-
tions before sending them your money:
 
✓ Who’s receiving commissions and how much? The TIC sponsor 
receives a commission or spread right off the top, plus the investment 
advisors (broker) who refer their clients get a piece of the action, too.
 
✓ Was the offered property recently acquired and at what price? Many 
TIC investors purchase the properties and then resell them within days 
or months at full retail or top of the market pricing, so it may be informa-
tive to know how much the TIC sponsor has made on the investment in 
addition to the commissions.
 
✓ How much of my net investment is actually invested in the property? 
At the end of the day, after everyone has been paid, how much of my 
investment actually is invested into the property?
 
✓ What’s the amount and timing of the cash distributions? If based on a 
certain percentage rather than actual operating results, are the distribu-
tions guaranteed, and if so, for how long and by whom? Many TIC spon-
sors use an above-average cash distribution as a hook to entice new 
investors, but property performance may not generate enough cash to 
cover the distributions, and investors may actually be required to cover 
operating losses. Where’s that fact in the fancy brochure?
 
✓ What are the charges for property and asset management? Most TIC 
sponsors have affiliated property management firms that handle the 
day-to-day management — but at fees toward the high end of reason-
able. Also, there may be another layer for an asset manager or advisory 
firm that supervises the property management company, and they’re 
also often controlled by or associated with the TIC sponsor. You have 
no guarantee that the asset or property management is qualified or com-
petent, so be sure to ask questions about their experience and creden-
tials; excellent management is extremely important. Remember that this 
is a passive investment, so you have little say in making any changes if 
they don’t meet your expectations.
 
✓ How liquid is my investment, and does the sponsor offer a buyback 
or loan program? Currently, there’s no viable secondary market for 
TIC investments, so you’re at the mercy of the TIC sponsor or possibly 
another investor who’d be willing to buy you out. Anyone buying a frac-
tional ownership is going to expect and receive a significant discount 
from the actual asset value. Have you ever tried to sell a timeshare inter-
est at the price you paid originally from the developer?

 Chapter 4: Taking the Passive Approach
Of course, many investors are attracted to the fact that someone else (all 
TIC sponsors claim to be experts) is tracking down the properties and doing 
all of the due diligence, and you definitely pay a price for these benefits. So 
follow the money and make sure you’re comfortable with this investment, 
because it isn’t easy to sell should your needs change.
The evolving TIC industry is in its infancy and is trying to set standards that 
should address some of the concerns about these investments and raise the 
level of the sponsors. You can find more information on TICs at the Tenant-
In-Common Association Web site at www.ticassoc.org.
Triple Net Properties
Triple net property is a common term for a type of net lease where the tenant 
pays some or all of the property operating and repair and maintenance 
expenses in addition to the rent. Many investors are attracted to the minimal 
property management and maintenance requirements of triple net properties 
because the tenant is responsible for the majority of all operating costs and 
maintenance.
Triple net properties are often promoted as another real estate option for 
investors looking to avoid the headaches of day-to-day management. These 
investments may seem like real estate investments, but they’re primarily an 
investment in the net cash flow (after debt service) from a lease to a credit 
tenant, and they’re promoted based on the cash-on-cash rate of return or 
cap rate (see Chapter 12 for information on these measures of investment 
return).
For years, these properties have been the favorites of real estate inves-
tors who like the steady income stream and safety usually associated with 
bonds. But net leases come in all varieties, and though all net leases are often 
referred to generically as triple net leases, the reality is that there is no stan-
dardization of terms or definitions. So the challenge is always to determine 
exactly which responsibilities belong to the landlord and which are the ten-
ant’s, and it’s those vagaries that often make it difficult to precisely evaluate 
these investments.
Thinking ahead about landlord/tenant 
division of duties
There are several different types of triple net properties. All net leases have 
some aspect of the tenant paying for operating expenses, taxes, insurance, 
maintenance, repairs, and even capital improvements. These investments 
(sometimes referred to as bond leases) include net leases where the total 

70
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
responsibility rests with the tenant. In a bond lease, the tenant is fully 
responsible for the repairs, maintenance, and operating expenses (including 
taxes and insurance) of the entire property without any limitations.
The net net net leases (or NNN leases) are similar to the bond lease, with the 
tenant being responsible for all operating and fixed costs of the property, but 
often come with limitations on capital improvements or upgrades that the 
landlord can pass on to the tenant.
Another type of net lease is the net net lease (or NN lease), which is an 
investment where the tenant pays most operating expenses but the landlord 
retains responsibility for the structural components such as the foundation, 
bearing walls, and roof. Sometimes a net net lease also includes a property 
where the owner is also responsible for major building systems such as 
HVAC equipment, electrical, plumbing, and driveways and parking areas.
 
If you’re considering an investment in any type of net lease, you must carefully 
review the lease to determine exactly who is responsible for all components of 
the building. You should also be very specific on your requirements or expec-
tations about the quality of the maintenance of the property as well as the 
details of the insurance coverage, including making sure you’re named on all 
polices as an additional insured. If you’re a novice, be sure to use the services 
of a real estate attorney or lease expert to prepare a lease abstract, which is a 
summary of the pertinent information from the lease.
A triple net lease typically involves a fast-food franchise, restaurant chain, 
local chain drugstore, or similar retail outlet. The owner buys the building, 
which is built precisely to the tenant’s specifications, and the tenant then 
enters a long-term fixed-rent lease in which she pays for almost everything, 
including the property taxes, insurance, utilities, and most of the mainte-
nance. Many companies rely heavily on the sale/leaseback of their newly 
built locations. The advantage to the tenant is that they free up capital to 
expand and grow their primary business, which isn’t actually real estate.
Originally, these investments were offered by developers who worked exclu-
sively with such companies, but now many brokers specialize in the market-
ing and sale of triple net properties.
 
The owner should regularly inspect the property under any type of net lease 
that isn’t a bond lease because she retains ultimate control — and thus the 
liability — if the tenant fails to properly maintain the building. Robert has 
seen a litany of litigation between the owner and tenant over issues of exactly 
what type of net lease exists, with the key dispute being an interpretation of 
who is responsible for the repair and maintenance of building components. 
These lawsuits often result from third-party injuries, with the landlord and 
the tenant each accusing the other of failing to properly inspect, maintain, 
and/or repair the property.

 Chapter 4: Taking the Passive Approach
Minimizing the risks of triple 
net investments
Lately, the returns available on these triple net properties have been low due 
to the perception that they’re essentially a risk-free investment. However, 
should the tenant find that the location isn’t profitable, you may find yourself 
owning a customized taco stand that requires a lot of modifications to be a 
viable location for another business.
 
Triple net real estate investments are suitable for some, but stay away from 
them unless you’re really comfortable with the tenant and the location and are 
willing to accept relatively low rates of return. Also, look closely at the rent 
structure because most leases have many years of flat, fixed rental income 
with an occasional upward adjustment that’s likely to be lower than the future 
market rent. Triple nets may make some sense if you can consistently earn a 
return that’s higher than a comparable bond investment. But you always run 
a risk with any single-tenant investment property, and fast-food and drugstore 
chains can (and do) go out of business. We advise investors interested in this 
type of investment to consider the diversification and lower risk associated with 
purchasing REITs (discussed earlier in this chapter) that hold triple net proper-
ties (among others) rather than a direct purchase of a triple net property.
 
Robert is aware of many triple net properties that probably seemed like great 
deals at the time buyers purchased them with a national credit tenant (an 
expanding company that has a very solid financial balance sheet) on a long-
term lease. What could go wrong? A lot. With leases as long as 50 years and 
set rents that are modestly adjusted over time, you run a serious inflation risk 
unless the rents can adjust to fair market rent at least every 5 to 10 years. The 
more specialized the use of the building by the tenant, the more challenging 
your life can be if the tenant vacates, so consider whether the tenant improve-
ments are suitable or can be modified at a reasonable cost to suit the needs of 
a replacement tenant.
Notes and Trust Deeds
Although the vast majority of real estate loans for purchasing or renovating 
properties comes from conventional lenders, some private sources of money 
make loans backed by notes or trust deeds. Real estate investors have found 
that they can benefit from the strong demand for real estate in their area by 
acting as a lender. They purchase notes and trust deeds that are backed by 
pledged real estate. Pledged real estate is the collateral or security interest 
provided to the investors to protect them from nonpayment by giving them 
the ability to foreclose on the real estate. Besides the interest earned on the 
investment, the note or trust deed holder has the collateral of the underlying 
real property if the borrower defaults on the loan.

72
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Real estate investors who buy and sell trust deeds are also often interested 
in making private hard money loans (loans on top of the first mortgage made 
by a traditional lender) to property owners or other real estate investors. 
These hard money loans are secured by the owner’s equity in the property 
and offer potentially favorable returns for the lender willing to make loans 
to borrowers that often have poor credit. Although your risk increases when 
the borrower has credit issues, the terms can be quite attractive — typically 
above-market interest rates ranging from 10 to 15 percent, plus loan fees of 3 
to 5 points (a point is 1 percent of the loan amount and is essentially prepaid 
interest), plus prepayment penalties that lock in the high interest rates or 
require a hefty payment for the privilege of refinancing.
Your loan is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust against the property, so 
it’s extremely important to be conservative with the loan-to-value ratio or the 
amount of money you actually lend the borrower versus the fair market value 
of the property. At times, borrowers damage or neglect the property if they 
fall behind on the payments, so we advise real estate investors to limit their 
exposure to no more than 50 to 60 percent of the value of the property.
 
Although making and purchasing real estate notes and trust deeds can be a 
lucrative investment vehicle, acting as a real estate lender can be risky for the 
novice. Properties with latent problems or unrecorded tax liens are just some 
of the potential pitfalls. Should you decide that lending money on real estate 
offers you the high returns you’re looking for without the headaches of owner-
ship, proceed with caution. Also be sure that you have an experienced real 
estate advisor and/or your real estate attorney review the documents before 
making an agreement or advancing any funds (see Chapter 6).
The safest approach to making secured loans on property is to thoroughly 
evaluate the pledged collateral to protect your investment and determine the 
fair market value if you had to foreclose. Never make a loan on a property 
that you wouldn’t be willing to own if that becomes your best way to protect 
your investment. Some lenders actually hope that the borrower does default 
so they can obtain the property for a fraction of its market value.
However, don’t forget that you’re responsible for legal fees and foreclosure 
costs in addition to the unpaid balance of your loan and accrued interest in 
the event that the borrower defaults.
Tax Lien Certificate Sales
Real estate owners who fail to pay their property taxes in a timely manner 
find that the local county files a lien on their property. A lien is any legal 
claim or charge against real or personal property for the satisfaction of a 
debt or duty that includes the right to take the property if the obligation isn’t 

73
 Chapter 4: Taking the Passive Approach
discharged. The county ultimately sells the property in a tax lien certificate 
sale auction to generate the funds necessary to satisfy the unpaid real estate 
property taxes, along with the accrued penalties and fees.
But local municipalities don’t want to foreclose or wait for payment because 
they need the funds today to pay the costs of government, so they auction off 
these tax lien certificates to investors.
Tax lien certificates can be a good investment regardless of the economic 
cycle, because some property owners will always be unable to pay their 
property taxes. When you buy a real estate tax lien, you’re simply providing 
the government entity with the funds for the delinquent taxes and buying the 
rights to collect those taxes from the property owner (plus penalties and a 
fixed rate of interest that can range from 12 to 24 percent per year).
 
The property owner can’t sell or pledge her real estate without paying the out-
standing tax liens, so over 90 percent of the tax lien certificates are redeemed 
within 24 months (or the maximum allowable redemption period set by each 
state or county). Look for tax lien certificates in certain types of real estate, 
such as owner-occupied properties, because these tend to have nearly a 100 
percent redemption rate. You may ultimately have to give the required legal 
notices and foreclose on the underlying real estate to achieve your return of 
capital and realize your return on investment, so always limit your purchase 
of tax lien certificates to properties that you’re willing to own.
Tax lien certificates aren’t available in every state, and you don’t have any 
way to control the timing of the redemption. Savvy real estate investors that 
have done quite well with tax lien certificate sales generally buy multiple 
liens to spread out their anticipated payoffs. Also, they read the fine print of 
the government rules and regulations concerning these sales, because the 
rules vary greatly from state to state — and each county within a state may 
have different rules. Contact your county tax collector to see whether real 
estate tax lien certificates are a viable investment alternative in your area.
 
You have to devote the time necessary to really find out about the underly-
ing properties even though finding information is difficult. The conventional 
sources of local real estate knowledge — brokers and agents — don’t work in 
this market because they offer no opportunities for them to earn commissions.
Limited Partnerships
Unlike a general partnership, in which every partner has full management 
authority and accountability, a real estate limited partnership is an investment 
program in which general partners manage property and accept unlimited 
liability, and the limited partners don’t participate in management decisions 

74
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
and their liability for losses is limited to their investment. A limited partner-
ship offers advantages to real estate investors who want to participate in the 
market while limiting their day-to-day involvement and liability.
The disadvantage of limited partnerships is that limited partners don’t have 
any authority, so limited partnerships are passive investments.
In a limited partnership, the general partner makes all the decisions of man-
agement and even decides when to sell the property. Upon disposition, many 
limited partnerships provide for the general partner to receive a portion of 
the appreciation (usually from 10 to 25 percent) right off the top — prior to 
distributions to the limited partners who get a share of the remaining real-
ized appreciation based on their ownership percentage. This equity kicker 
for the general partner is typically in addition to brokerage fees upon acqui-
sition and disposition, plus market rate or higher fees for property manage-
ment and asset management.
 
Although some limited partnerships are formed by general partners who treat 
each partner as an equal, the majority is structured by general partners with 
the perspective of “Heads: I win! Tails: You lose!” Some limited partnerships 
are nothing more than a pure profit play for the general partner in which they 
get their money upfront — often while the limited partners are held captive 
and can only hope to see the return of their capital and some appreciation in 
the distant future.
Limiting the scope of limited partnerships
Limited partnerships have been available for 
many years. Prior to the extensive overhaul of 
the federal taxation of real estate investments 
in the 1980s, they were a common method of 
real estate investing. Up until that time, all 
losses from real estate were fully deductible, 
and these loopholes created opportunities for 
aggressive tax management to avoid legal tax 
liabilities.
In 1986, Congress passed new tax regulations 
that eliminated the favorable tax treatment of 
most losses unless the real estate investor was 
an active participant. To qualify as an active 
participant, an individual must be involved in 
direct management decisions of the property, 
although the day-to-day rental activities of col-
lecting rent, overseeing repairs, and paying bills 
can be delegated to a property manager.
Further, the federal tax code limits the deduct-
ibility of your passive losses against your 
earned income (salary, dividends, and inter-
est) to a maximum of $25,000, as long as your 
adjusted gross income doesn’t exceed $100,000. 
The maximum $25,000 passive loss deduc-
tion phases out at a ratio of $1 for every $2 in 
adjusted gross income between $100,000 and 
$150,000. For real estate owners with adjusted 
gross income exceeding $150,000, any passive 
losses are carried forward to future years or 
until the property is sold.
However, we discuss an extremely valuable 
exception for real estate investors who qualify 
as real estate professionals in Chapter 18.

Payments and Property Flips
In This Chapter
▶ Debunking no-money-down strategies
▶ Choosing the best fast-money strategy
▶ Uncovering those buy-and-flip properties
T
he only thing better for a small-time investor than getting rich is getting 
rich quickly. Entire books have been written about hitting the real estate 
big time with little money to invest through buying and flipping properties to 
turn quick profits.
Does this scenario sound too good to be true? Of course it does! In some 
cases, these strategies have proven profitable — but those success stories 
are few and far between. That’s why we warn you about the realities and 
truths of the get-rich-quick-and-with-little-money sales pitches in this chap-
ter, and we offer our best advice to guide you in case you choose to walk 
these dangerous paths despite our persistent warnings!
Purchasing with No Money Down
If you’ve ever had insomnia and turned on the television in the middle of the 
night, you’ve likely seen the late-night infomercial real estate gurus who claim 
to possess the true secrets of buying real estate significantly below market 
value — and they don’t even use their own money! They tell viewers that 
anyone can buy real estate tomorrow using their no-money-down strategies. 
And it gets even better — they tell you that you can actually receive money 
from the seller to buy her property.

76
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
Although we do believe it’s possible to find a buyer who is so motivated that 
she’ll actually pay you to take a property off her hands, the reality is that the 
vast majority of such properties don’t prove to be profitable for you in the 
long run. Ask yourself — why would anyone give away a property unless it 
had some really serious problems?
Understanding why we recommend 
skipping these investments
 
The concept of buying real estate without using any of your own money is 
clearly dependent on finding an extremely motivated seller. A motivated seller 
is one who faces circumstances that don’t allow him the flexibility to achieve 
full market value for his property. For sure, a certain number of motivated sell-
ers exist in any market.
The late 2000s downturn in the real estate market may seem a perfect oppor-
tunity to explore the benefits of putting less money down to purchase a prop-
erty. The reality is that most lenders are no longer in the creative financing 
business after being burned by the stated income or “no doc” and similar 
subprime loans in which the buyers have no vested interest and were count-
ing on unsustainable appreciation to create equity.
There are also fewer sellers with significant equity in their properties so the 
margin for seller financing is diminished. Low money down and/or install-
ment sales are much more likely and feasible when you have a seller with 
plenty of equity. However, many of the most motivated current sellers are 
owners of properties in which they owe as much or more than the property’s 
current market value.
The stock market is a relatively liquid market where buyers and sellers can 
enter or leave the market quickly with broad knowledge of current pricing. 
In contrast, real estate assets are illiquid — it can take a relatively long time 
The birth of the no-money-down movement
The popularity of no-money-down investing 
peaked in the early-1980s when most real estate 
loans were assumable — the buyer of the 
property essentially took over or assumed the 
payments on the current loan from the seller. 
Properties weren’t appreciating that quickly in 
that time frame, so many owners didn’t have 
significant equity in their homes and were will-
ing to take small down payments or carry seller 
financing as part of the transaction. The advent 
of the due on sale clause in many mortgages 
virtually eliminated the ability of buyers to 
assume the sellers current loan.

77
 Chapter 5: Fast Money: Small Down Payments and Property Flips
to enter or leave the real estate market. Real estate is also unique: A share 
of your favorite stock always represents the same investment; not so with 
real estate. This creates the opportunity to profit from pricing inefficiencies 
between one property and another. Also, the ability to complete a real estate 
transaction quickly provides an additional factor that can affect the price.
The following are examples of motivated sellers who may be willing to accept 
a no-money-down offer:
 
✓ A seller who’s relocating and needs to sell in a hurry: An owner who’s 
leaving the area may need to quickly sell his home so he can buy a 
replacement home in his new location. In order to complete the sale in a 
timely manner, he may be willing to lower the price to somewhat below 
the full market value (the price he could have received if he were not in 
such a hurry).
 
 Finding a seller in a hurry is one of the most reliable ways to buy real 
estate with little or no money down.
 
✓ A seller who’s desperate to sell and exasperated by the effort: The 
owner of a property that has been vacant for an extended time period 
or that requires extensive renovation may be desperate to sell. The 
property may have a deadbeat tenant, or maybe it’s vacant after being 
destroyed by the last tenant and the owner lacks the cash to make the 
significant investment in repairs. This type of seller may be willing to 
offer generous seller financing terms or even pay you to remove him 
from his liability.
But even when sellers find themselves in such positions, who will stamp 
“Desperate to Sell” on their forehead? Trying to determine a seller’s motiva-
tion always takes work. Check out Chapter 13 for more on the subject.
 
Although, clearly, such real estate owners exist, they’re not as common as 
some of the real estate investment gurus would have you believe. There are 
always anecdotal stories about an amazing success story, but there are many 
more untold stories of cocky novice real estate investors who found out the 
hard way that you get what you pay for.
Finding no-money-down opportunities 
(if you insist)
 
No-money-down sellers are in greater abundance in a weak real estate market 
(or buyer’s market) because sellers have fewer options. The target market for 
no-money-down deals is a real estate market environment with highly moti-
vated sellers facing dire consequences (including foreclosure, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 3) unless they dispose of their property. Usually, sellers that 
need to sell quickly are in one of the following situations:

78
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
 
✓ A seller who has had some unfortunate circumstances such as an ill-
ness, a death in the family, a divorce, a job loss, or a significant loss 
of income such that she can no longer afford to make the payments 
and handle the ongoing expenses of the property — this situation is 
often the one that leads to a no-money-down offer. Because of her com-
promised situation, such a property seller may not readily qualify for 
new or additional loans that would allow her to handle the cash flow 
dilemma she faces. Although home equity loans may be available in 
these circumstances, the owner may be so financially overwhelmed that 
she prefers to sell her property and downsize her financial obligations 
to a more manageable level.
 
✓ A seller with significant equity but limited options to tap that equity is 
likely to have cash flow problems, but the overall equity in the property 
can allow her to act as a lender to you (see Chapter 8 for seller-financing 
strategies).
 
The two most common good candidates (as opposed to the classic definition of 
folks who would be flexible out of desperation) for no-money-down scenarios are
 
• Folks at or approaching retirement age who would prefer a steady 
income stream to a lump sum.
 
• Individuals who inherited the property and are looking for monthly 
income without the hassles of being a landlord.
In order to know whether the candidates you’re considering fall into one of 
the preceding scenarios, you need to assess their motives. Chapter 13 helps 
you do that.
Buying, Fixing, and Flipping 
or Refinancing
 
In a solid real estate market, you often find properties appreciating at an 
annual rate of 3 to 5 percent — a solid and sustainable rate of appreciation 
that rewards investors with long-term investment horizons who take the buy-
and-hold approach with their real estate assets. This buy-and-hold strategy 
works and should always be the foundation of your wealth-building.
But in some areas, the demand for housing has been so great that the limited 
supply of new and existing properties available in the market is insufficient to 
meet the demand. It’s in these markets of high demand and rapidly escalating 
prices that real estate speculators with a buy-and-flip strategy appear.

79
 Chapter 5: Fast Money: Small Down Payments and Property Flips
 
There’s nothing wrong with the buy-and-flip strategy, but we prefer the more 
conventional and lower-risk strategy of buy, fix, and hold.
The buy-and-flip strategy
The buy-and-flip strategy can also work with existing homes that the investor 
can purchase from a motivated seller at a wholesale price that is below the 
market value. The investor may not even have to close escrow before finding 
a buyer willing to pay a retail price. There may be some minor cosmetic work 
or simple improvements needed before reselling, but typically, buy-and-flip 
investors really make their money when they buy at a discount and then 
locate a buyer at full market value. This approach is risky, but it can also be 
rewarding.
 
This high-risk strategy requires a rapidly rising real estate market with higher 
than normal appreciation rates to allow for profits on short term investments. 
Not only do you have to have excessive demand driving up the prices of real 
estate, but you also have to cover all of the costs of real estate. With online 
stock trading firms, you can buy shares of your favorite company in minutes 
with relatively low transaction costs. But with real estate, the costs of buying, 
holding, and selling a property are much higher and unknown, and generally 
include
 
✓ Acquisition costs: Due diligence and inspection fees plus loan fees/costs 
and points
 
✓ Transaction costs: Closing and escrow fees
 
✓ Repair or upgrade costs: Costs to renovate or fix property to make it 
more desirable and generate the highest resale price (unless the prop-
erty is brand-new)
 
✓ Holding costs: Property taxes, insurance, and any negative cash flow 
while the property sits vacant or if the rental income doesn’t cover the 
carrying costs
 
✓ Sales costs: Commissions and title insurance from the sale of the property
Even during the weak real estate market in the late-2000s, you see late-night 
infomercials promoting the flipping strategy, but they often cite examples 
with just limited information. These ads feature an average Joe who invests 
his excess income in a fixer-upper down the street — he pays $150,000 for it 
and then sells it for $200,000 after replumbing the property and installing all 
new flooring, window coverings, and appliances. The infomercials imply that 
he just made a quick and effortless $50,000.

80
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
But what they don’t say is that he has $3,000 in acquisition costs, $2,000 more 
in transaction costs, $15,000 in repairs and upgrades, and $10,000 in sales 
costs for a total of $30,000. That brings the theoretical profit down to $20,000 
before factoring in holding costs. Even if everything works out well for Joe, his 
property likely sits empty for at least six months while he renovates it, puts 
it on the market, and shows it to prospective buyers. So by the time Joe has 
completed this investment cycle, he’s quite possibly spent another $6,000 in 
mortgage interest payments, plus $2,000 in property taxes and insurance. His 
pre-tax profit is now $12,000 if everything goes well. But wait — there’s more. 
Because he only held this investment for less than one year, he pays income 
tax at his nominal ordinary earned income tax rate of, say, 30 percent, which 
brings his amazing $50,000 profit down to a measly $8,400.
But what if there are some additional problems with the property when Joe 
opens up the walls to replumb his new investment gem? Maybe there are 
termites or roof leaks or problems with the foundation. What if the demand 
for this property diminishes and he has to hold the property for 12 months? 
(Some folks got burned in the late-2000s when the demand for housing sud-
denly evaporated.) Even in the best scenario, where Joe has accurately esti-
mated the repair and upgrade costs and there are no surprises, he finds that 
just owning the property for six months longer than he expected doubles the 
holding costs from $8,000 to $16,000, reducing the pre-tax profit to $4,000. By 
the time he is done paying 30 percent of that in taxes, Joe has just $2,800 to 
show for his efforts.
You may be located in a market that has experienced rapid housing price 
increases, but be careful. If there is too much excess demand for new housing in 
the area, real estate speculators — not long-term investors or homeowners — 
can make up the majority of the purchasers. This tendency can be dangerous 
when the majority of buyers in the market are looking for the quick profit rather 
than a long-term, stable real estate investment. When enough of these specula-
tors head for the exits (as happened in some areas in the late-2000s real estate 
market decline) and don’t return, prices can quickly turn tail. The speculators 
are then forced to mitigate their losses by renting out their properties (some-
times for years) until the real estate market rebounds and they’re able to sell 
the property to break even.
But we’re pragmatists — we know that lightning may strike and you may run 
into a property that turns out to be a buy-and-flip candidate. So in Chapter 
13, we detail how to keep this possibility open by using an assignment clause 
when completing a purchase agreement. And we also cover possible tax draw-
backs of losing the advantages of lower capital gains taxes in Chapter 18.

The buy, fix, and refinance strategy
With the buy, fix, and refinance strategy, you invest in properties where value 
can be added to the property through repairs, upgrades, and improvements 
that take a distressed property and turn it into a solid and well-maintained 
property. Over the years, with increased equity in the property and as long 
as interest rates are attractive, you could refinance the property if you so 
choose and use some of your equity towards other real estate investments.
We strongly prefer this method because it has proven throughout the years 
to be the lowest risk, highest probability way to make money in real estate. 
You can think of it as the tortoise in the old tortoise-and-the-hare story, 
where the hare is the fast-money, high-risk, high-return strategy. The tortoise 
may be slow and steady, but he ends up winning in the long run. As an exam-
ple, Robert is a conservative person by nature, yet he has acquired a signifi-
cant real estate portfolio by simply purchasing well-located-but-distressed 
properties and renovating, filling them up, and then refinancing.

T
here are some investments — called passive investments — where you 
can simply turn your money over to professional money managers or 
financial advisors who then act on your behalf and make the day-to-day 
investment decisions, buying and selling investment assets within the portfo-
lio. Mutual funds are an example of this type of passive investment. You send 
your money to your favorite mutual fund firm and periodically evaluate how 
your fund’s managers are doing.
Investments in real estate that you’re directly involved in managing are the 
norm, because passive investments in real estate aren’t readily available 
(except for REITs and TICs, which we discuss in Chapter 4). And for most real 
estate investors, real estate investing is hands-on and complicated enough 
to require the services and knowledge of a team of professionals. Although 
you may be skilled in your chosen field, it’s unlikely that you possess all of 
the varied and detailed skills and knowledge necessary to initiate and close a 
good real estate transaction.
Evaluate proposed real estate investments carefully and methodically before 
you make the ultimate purchase decision. The uniqueness of each potential 
real estate opportunity requires the investor to patiently critique the pend-
ing investment. You should understand the economic climate and potential 
for growth, the current physical condition of the property, the tenants, and 
the value of the property in the marketplace. Then you should ensure that 
you’ve got a solid negotiating strategy to orchestrate a deal, that the financ-
ing comes through, and that the transfer of real estate is handled properly. 
This requires a team approach.

84
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
In this chapter, we discuss the different real estate professionals and service 
providers that you should consider teaming up with as you search for real 
estate investment opportunities and proceed with the purchase of property.
Knowing When to Establish Your Team
 
Some real estate investors make the mistake of looking for a property to buy 
without spending enough time upfront thinking about and identifying the pros 
whose help should be hired. We recommend that you have your team in place 
before you begin your serious property searching, for two reasons:
 
✓ You can move quickly. The speed at which you can close a transaction is 
an advantage in any type of market. In a soft or buyer’s market, some sell-
ers are desperate for cash and need to close quickly. In a rising or seller’s 
market, sellers typically don’t tolerate having their property tied up in 
a long escrow with a buyer who doesn’t understand the current market 
conditions or how to properly evaluate the property. Sellers may be miss-
ing out on a better deal with a more qualified buyer. In a buyer’s market, 
although less property may be selling overall, there is always demand for 
the most appealing properties that are priced right and well located. These 
properties often attract multiple offers, so being organized and efficient 
can make the difference between securing and losing a desirable property.
 
✓ You can effectively research the property before making an offer. 
Prudent investors conduct research and gather information before they 
buy, so they know which property or properties are worthy of an offer. 
Typically, the real estate industry describes due diligence as the period of 
time after you place a property under contract (see Chapter 14). But you 
really need to perform due diligence even before making an offer. You don’t 
want to waste time or money on a property that can’t meet your goals.
 
 Some real estate investors like to make an offer and get a property under 
contract before they begin due diligence. We believe that this is a mis-
take and can lead to a reputation with sellers (and agents) that you’re 
not a serious buyer (see the “Working with Real Estate Brokers and 
Agents” section later in the chapter). We recommend only making offers 
when you have done enough due diligence to feel comfortable that your 
further, thorough review of the property interiors and books probably 
won’t reveal any surprises that will lead to canceling the purchase.
 
 The most effective research is done with the assistance of real estate 
professionals to give you the advice and information you need to make an 
intelligent decision. This pre-offer period is critical; it’s the one real oppor-
tunity for a prospective buyer to investigate a property while retaining the 
ability to terminate the transaction without a significant monetary loss. 
You may invest time and several hundred to several thousand dollars to 
perform the necessary due diligence, but this is a small amount compared 
to the potential losses from the purchase of a bad property. (We cover 
this prepurchase research in Chapters 10 through 12.)

 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
Adding a Tax Advisor
A tax advisor may not be the first person that you think to consult before 
making a real estate transaction. However, our experience is that a good tax 
advisor can highlight potential benefits and pitfalls of different real estate 
investment strategies. Of course, make sure that your tax person has expe-
rience with real estate investing and understands your needs and specific 
goals in regard to your property investments. (We cover the ins and outs of 
real estate accounting and taxation in Chapters 17 and 18.)
 
Although you may pick up a lot of information about real estate and discover 
some of the advantages of property investing speaking with some tax people, 
don’t rely on generic information (“investing in real estate offers a terrific tax 
shelter,” for example). You need specific feedback and ideas from a tax expert 
regarding your unique financial situation and which types of real estate invest-
ments work best for you.
Based on your age, income, and other important factors, the benefits you 
seek from real estate may be entirely different from other investors. Many 
real estate investors are looking for immediate cash flow from their proper-
ties. But others have sufficient income currently from other sources and 
prefer to look at real estate as a wealth builder for their retirement years. 
And almost all real estate investors are looking for tax benefits.
The role of your accountant is to evaluate and recommend investments and 
tax strategies that maximize your financial position. Remember the old adage 
that says, “It’s not what you make that matters but what you keep.”
A good tax advisor with property investment experience can tell you whether 
your best real estate investment is the direct ownership of properties or per-
haps owning triple net leased properties with lower returns but fewer man-
agement headaches. An accountant can inform his clients as to whether they 
can still meet the active participation required for certain tax benefits while 
hiring a property management company to handle the bulk of the day-to-day 
tenant/landlord issues.
You may also want to find out whether you qualify for the added tax benefits 
that are available for some investors who qualify as real estate professionals. 
Achieving such qualification isn’t easy, and the IRS may someday audit you. 
Meet with your tax advisor and get to know the benefits and pitfalls of your 
proposed real estate investments before you start making offers.
Finding a Financial Advisor
Over the years, Eric has written extensively about the financial planning pro-
fession and how individuals can best navigate important personal financial 

86
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
decisions with and without the help of such planners. In theory, everyone 
entering into major investments like real estate should seek holistic financial 
advice from a financial advisor who charges an hourly fee.
Avoiding financial conflicts of interest
Here are a couple of stories that highlight the 
conflicts of interest you may be subjected to 
when working with a financial advisor.
 ✓ While serving as an expert real estate wit-
ness, Robert had a case where a retired 
couple was given some self-serving advice 
by their financial planner. This couple 
owned their principal residence plus three 
other rental homes valued at $1 million. All of 
their real estate was owned free and clear, 
and the rentals were in great condition with 
good long-term tenants. The properties pro-
vided a nice monthly income stream that 
was mostly tax-free due to their deprecia-
tion deduction (see Chapter 18). Although 
the real estate was clearly their largest 
asset and completely debt-free, they also 
had nearly $500,000 in liquid assets such as 
stocks, bonds, and IRAs and seemed to be 
fairly set. That was, until their new financial 
advisor told them that their retirement was 
at risk because they had too much invested 
in real estate. The planner’s recommenda-
tion was to keep their own home as their 
real estate investment, but sell the three 
highly appreciated rental properties and 
invest the proceeds in mutual funds and 
other financial products from companies 
affiliated with the planner.
 
 The planner failed to disclose his relationship 
with the sponsors of the new investments and 
also failed to warn them about the significant 
capital gains taxes that would be due upon 
sale. By the time they met with their accoun-
tant, it was too late — two of the three rental 
properties had been sold and over $200,000 in 
taxes was due. The accountant advised the 
couple to contact an attorney and file a law-
suit against the financial advisor. Although 
the couple prevailed, they recovered only a 
small portion of what they paid in taxes. Even 
worse — they lost the benefits of cash flow 
and appreciation on their real estate while 
now owning fully taxable investments.
 ✓ In Eric’s previous work as an hourly-based 
financial advisor, he often had clients 
come to him who were disappointed with 
the biased and confusing advice they got 
from various so-called financial planners. 
In one typical case, a widow had been told 
by an advisor to sell her two investment 
properties because he believed that the 
stock market would produce better returns. 
She set the wheels in motion to unload the 
properties but put the brakes on at the last 
minute after deciding she needed a second 
opinion. She met with Eric. The first thing 
that she noticed working with him was that 
he was far more thorough in examining her 
overall financial situation, including all of 
her investments, insurance, and resources 
for retirement. She also realized that she 
was happy with her real estate holdings 
and really didn’t have any motivation to sell 
them. Furthermore, she found out from Eric 
that over the long-term, the returns from 
stocks and real estate were quite com-
parable. She thus decided to keep her life 
simple and stable and hold onto her nicely 
performing rental properties.
Don’t get us wrong, selling real estate can 
make sense at times. However, you must ask 
a lot of questions and run any proposed invest-
ment strategies by good independent advisors 
before you make the decision to liquidate your 
real estate and shift your investments to other 
opportunities.

87
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
 
In reality, many financial consultants sell investment and insurance products 
that provide them with commissions or manage money for an ongoing per-
centage in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the like. Such salespeople and 
money managers can’t provide objective, holistic advice, especially on real 
estate transactions. When you buy property, you spend money these people 
want to manage. Check out the “Avoiding financial conflicts of interest” side-
bar in this chapter for more information.
 
If you’ve worked with or can locate a financial advisor who sells her time and 
nothing else, just as a good tax advisor does, consider hiring her. A true finan-
cial advisor can help you understand how real estate investment property 
purchases fit with your overall financial situation and goals. (Chapter 1 dis-
cusses all the variables that affect the way your investments mesh with your 
situation and goals.)
Lining Up a Lender or Mortgage Broker
 
Before looking at specific real estate opportunities, you need a budget. And 
because your budget for real estate purchases is largely a function of how 
much you can borrow (in addition to your cash available for a down pay-
ment), you need to determine the limits on your borrowing power. If you can’t 
afford a property, it doesn’t matter what a great deal it is.
Postpone making an appointment to look at investment properties until after 
you examine the loans available. You have two resources to consult:
 
✓ Lender is a generic term for any firm, public or private, that directly loan 
you the cash you need to purchase your property. This type of lender is 
often referred to as a direct lender. Most often, your list of possible lend-
ers includes banks, credit unions, and private lenders (including property 
sellers). Lenders tend to specialize in certain types of loans.
 
✓ A mortgage broker is a service provider that presents your request for a 
loan to a variety of different lenders in order to find the best financing for 
your particular needs. Just like real estate or insurance brokers, a good 
mortgage broker can be a real asset to your team (we cover mortgages 
in detail in Chapter 8, along with the advantages and disadvantages to 
working with mortgage brokers versus direct lenders in Chapter 9).
Protecting yourself by understanding 
lending nuances
Lenders and mortgage brokers are in the business of making loans. That’s 
how they make money. Their product is cash, and they make money by 
renting it to people and businesses that pay them the money back plus 

88
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
interest, which is the cost of renting the money. Money is a commodity just 
like anything else and its availability and pricing are subject to an assortment 
of variables.
 
Lenders and mortgage brokers want to find you money for your next real estate 
purchase, but they’re not objective advisors to provide counsel for how much 
you should borrow. They’re trained to calculate the maximum that you may 
borrow. Don’t confuse this figure with the amount that you can truly afford or 
that fits best with your overall financial and personal situation. Because they 
only are paid when they make loans, many borrowers have learned the hard 
lesson that some lenders and mortgage brokers are willing to make any loan.
 
So why is getting a loan so difficult at times? Because lenders want to make 
loans to those investors who are a good credit risk and who they think have 
a high probability of repaying the loan in full plus the interest. This concern 
became more pronounced in the late-2000s as real estate prices fell and 
defaults and foreclosures escalated. The lender has costs of doing business 
and needs to make a profit. Because the money they lend often belongs to 
their depositors, lenders need to be careful and selective about the loans they 
make. (See Chapter 9 for more information on the necessity of a good credit 
rating when investing in real estate.)
On the upside, we’ve found that lenders can also serve a valuable role by pre-
venting you from making serious mistakes. Particularly in overheated seller’s 
markets where prices are irrationally climbing with little fundamental eco-
nomic support, your lender and the required appraisal from a competent pro-
fessional appraiser can keep you from getting caught up in a buy-at-any-price 
frenzy. (Of course, this isn’t always the case; look no further than the subprime 
loan debacle that came to light in the late-2000s.) In these markets, lenders 
tend to be a little more conservative, limiting loan amounts and requiring 
larger down payments. These factors provide the lender with additional pro-
tection should market prices fall, but they’re also a signal that the lender feels 
the loan exceeds the intrinsic value of the property that they’ll be stuck with if 
you default. Smaller loan offers with higher down payments are a clue that you 
may be paying more than a property is worth or buying at the market’s peak.
The lender requires collateral to protect them if the borrower doesn’t make 
the debt service payments as required. Collateral is the real or personal 
property that’s pledged to secure a loan or mortgage. If the debt isn’t paid as 
agreed, the lender has the right to force the sale of the collateral to recover 
the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. Typically, the property 
being purchased is the pledged collateral for real estate loans or mortgages.

89
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
Building relationships with lenders
 
Relationships with lenders can take time to build, so begin looking for lenders 
that specialize in the types of properties within the geographic area that you 
have targeted. They can help you understand your financial qualifications or 
how much you can borrow before you begin your search for an investment 
property. Although lenders only make money by making loans and some lend-
ers seem to be willing to lend money on any property at any price, the type of 
lender you should associate with is one who understands real estate cycles 
and your local real estate market. Not all lenders and mortgage brokers were 
hit by the subprime lending mess, and it does matter that you develop a rela-
tionship with a lender that’s likely to be there when you want to acquire addi-
tional properties.
When you get together with your lender or mortgage broker, provide them 
with your latest personal financial statement, which includes your income 
and expenses as well as your assets and liabilities and net worth. The days of 
“no documentation” or “stated income” loans are hopefully over.
 
Always be truthful with your lender. One way to sabotage a relationship with a 
lender is to exaggerate or stretch the truth about your current financial situa-
tion or about the potential for your proposed property acquisition. Most lend-
ers require supporting documents for your income and assets and will obtain 
a current credit report. When you don’t oversell yourself or your proposed 
property, lenders are often more willing to work with you and even offer 
better terms.
Working with Real Estate 
Brokers and Agents
Your investment team should include a sharp and energetic real estate 
broker or agent. All real estate brokers and agents are licensed by the state 
in which they perform their services. A real estate broker is the highest level 
of licensed real estate professional, and a licensed real estate sales agent is 
qualified to handle real estate listings and transactions under the supervi-
sion of a broker. The vast majority of real estate licensees are sales agents. 
Throughout this chapter, we refer to both real estate brokers and agents 
simply as agents.
A real estate agent must have his license placed under a supervising broker 
who’s ultimately responsible for the actions of the sales agent. Real estate 
brokers often begin their careers as real estate agents, but it’s possible to 

90
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
meet the more stringent qualifications and immediately qualify as a broker. 
Brokers and agents can perform the same functions; many real estate agents 
actually have more practical experience and hands-on market knowledge 
than the brokers they work for. Brokers that have many agents reporting to 
them often spend most of their time educating, supervising, and reviewing 
the transactions presented by their agents. So, if you have a problem with an 
agent, contact the broker — the buck stops with her!
 
Generally, you deal with real estate agents, but the added experience and 
dedication of a broker can be beneficial to you if you’re involved in larger and/
or more complicated transactions. Real estate agents are fine to handle the 
majority of real estate transactions, including the typical purchase or sale of 
an owner-occupied single-family home or condo. However, many owners of 
investment real estate don’t want the disruption that can occur with openly 
listing the property. The management company and employees begin to worry 
about their jobs, and tenants become concerned that rents will be raised. 
These problems can be avoided by quietly talking to one or two top brokers 
in an area with the understanding that the potential transaction is to be kept 
confidential. This leads to some great opportunities for the top brokers and 
their clients.
Whether you use a broker or an agent, make sure that this person has a 
solid track record with investment property transactions in your area. And 
although having a real estate agent on your team is an excellent strategy that 
gives you a competitive edge, don’t completely ignore the Multiple Listing 
Service or in-house listings of brokers. Such sources often include properties 
that other investors overlooked because they didn’t have the vision or the 
right team members to see a potential opportunity.
Seeing the value of working with an agent
In many metropolitan areas, looking at the properties on a Multiple Listing 
Service (MLS) or in the newspaper or online listings isn’t enough. The best 
deals are often the ones that don’t make it into these sources. This is where 
the insider information from real estate sales agents can make you the bride 
and not the bridesmaid. (Of course, many brokers are themselves interested 
in investing in income producing properties, and they have the first chance 
at the best deals.)
You want to be the first one contacted about the best properties coming 
on the market rather than one of many when everyone knows about the 
property from the MLS. The MLS is a service created and maintained by real 
estate professionals per guidelines established by the National Association 
of Realtors (NAR). This service gathers all of the local property listings into 
a single place so that purchasers may review all available properties from 
one source. The MLS also deals with commission splitting and other relations 
between agents.

91
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
For many years the MLS dominated the markets, but the Department of 
Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit that was settled with NAR in 2008, agree-
ing that other listing services would be given access to the same listings. 
Now there are several investment real estate listing services that are gaining 
market share and offering instant access to an incredible database of infor-
mation on all types of properties from single-family homes and condos to 
large commercial, industrial, and retail properties. Two of the most popular 
listing services for investment properties are Loopnet (www.loopnet.com) 
and CoStar (www.costar.com).
Understanding the implications of agency: 
Who the agent is working for
When you deal with a real estate agent, you need to know who she repre-
sents. Real estate investors need to understand the concepts of dual agency 
and single agency and the implications of each:
 
✓ Single agency: This is when an agent only represents the buyer or the 
seller. The other party either represents herself or is represented by 
an agent who doesn’t work for the same broker as the other agent. For 
example, a buyer’s agent only has a fiduciary relationship with the buyer. 
The buyer’s agent has a duty to promote the interests of the buyer and 
keep all information confidential unless legally required to disclose. 
The buyer’s interest should be first and foremost, and no information is 
passed to the seller without your knowledge other than that information 
that directly affects your ability to perform on the contract as written.
 
 We strongly recommend that you work with an agent who operates as a 
single agency representative. A lot of money is involved in income prop-
erty transactions, and you want to have someone looking out for your 
interests whether you’re buying or selling an investment property.
 
✓ Dual agency: A situation in which the same individual agent represents 
both the seller and the buyer or when two different agents represent-
ing the seller and buyer are from the same firm (with the same broker). 
With any transaction, each agent involved owes a fiduciary duty of loy-
alty to each client he represents, but this is nearly impossible for one 
agent who is representing both the buyer and seller in the same transac-
tion (and difficult as well if two agents work for the same broker).
 
 Avoid the inherent conflict of interest found with dual agency and estab-
lish a relationship with a single agency agent who represents only your 
interests. Dual agency makes it extremely challenging for one agent, 
or two agents working for the same broker, to be loyal to clients with 
opposing interests. For example, an agent may hear confidential infor-
mation from sellers about what their minimum acceptable price is, and 
the same agent or another agent from the same firm hears from buyers 
that they’re willing to pay more than what they first offered.

92
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
Agents, and especially their brokers, prefer dual agency — they generate 
more commissions by representing both sides of the transaction. That’s why 
many agents start out showing their clients only properties that are listed by 
their firms. However, this desire to capture a bigger share of the real estate 
commission has led to some serious conflicts of interest. Now most states 
either prohibit dual agency or at least require the agent to disclose the exact 
nature of the agency relationship prior to commencing the representation of 
a client by taking a listing, showing a property, or making an offer.
Getting a feel for compensation
Real estate agents are generally motivated to see the transaction go through 
because they’re compensated when a sale is made. Compensation for agents 
is typically calculated as a percentage of the sales price paid for a property. So 
the agents actually have an interest in the property going for a higher price. 
Commissions vary based on the property and the size of the transaction:
 
✓ Individual residential properties, such as single-family homes and 
condos, have commissions of 5 to 6 percent of the sales price.
 
✓ Small multifamily and commercial properties are often in the 3 to 5 per-
cent range.
 
✓ Larger investment properties have commissions of 1 to 3 percent.
 
✓ Raw land (in its natural state with no grading, construction, or improve-
ments) is usually at 10 percent, unless the acreage is large. Subdivided 
or finished developable lots in suburban areas typically draw a lower 
commission.
These commissions are typically split between the firm listing the property 
for sale and working with the seller and the agent representing the buyer. 
The actual proportion of the split varies, with the listing agent sometimes 
taking a smaller percentage than the buyer’s agent if the commissions aren’t 
evenly split. The commission actually is paid to the broker, and the agent 
receives his share based on his employment or commission agreement, 
which also often calls for the agent to cover some of his own expenses and 
overhead.
Real estate commissions can be a significant cost factor for real estate inves-
tors. Most listing agreements acknowledge that commissions aren’t fixed by 
law and are negotiable. Traditionally, the seller “pays” the commission to the 
real estate agents involved in the transaction, although because the buyer is 
the one paying for the property, we say that both the buyer and seller ulti-
mately pay for the agent’s commissions.

93
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
Real estate agents do add to the cost of purchasing property, but a good 
agent, like a good property manager, can justify the cost of her services by 
introducing you to properties that you would not otherwise have an opportu-
nity to purchase. A good agent earns her commissions other ways as well — 
as a good negotiator and through her other marketplace knowledge.
Some real estate investors get a real estate license so that they can eliminate 
paying at least one-half of the real estate commission to agents. And there are 
times when you’ll be able to use your sale’s or broker’s license to effectively 
reduce your transaction expenses and investment requirement by represent-
ing yourself in a transaction. This is particularly helpful when you’re looking 
to sell a property in a strong seller’s market.
But as a licensee you need to be very careful to follow all real estate dis-
closure laws about your licensing status to all parties in the transaction. 
Generally, a real estate agent is expected to have more knowledge in a real 
estate transaction than others without such credentials. Thus, you must be 
very careful when you act as an agent and a principal in a purchase or sale 
transaction.
Although you may often have superior knowledge of market values and 
opportunities in the marketplace, you need to make sure that you’re not self-
dealing or taking advantage of insider information that would have a material 
impact on the value of the property. A real estate agent who buys properties 
for the long-term for his own account is not likely to be challenged, but such 
an individual that uses his knowledge to flip properties for a quick profit may 
be subject to claims by the seller that he withheld information. For example, 
you may find yourself named in a lawsuit if you bought a property at a low 
price when you knew that a new road was going to be built that would greatly 
enhance the property value in the next year or so.
Robert has seen many allegations against licensed real estate profession-
als who have been accused of self-dealing or failing to act properly in real 
estate transactions when they buy the property for an entity that they have a 
financial interest in or have a straw man or secret partner. This situation can 
happen even if you disclose your real estate license status and your financial 
interest in the buyer entity, but it is illegal and likely to be considered more 
egregious if you conceal this information from the seller. Agents have also 
been accused of illegal activity when they sell their own property (for exam-
ple, as a tenants in common or triple net investment opportunity) at a much 
higher than market value.
One recent example from Robert’s litigation consulting practice involved a 
real estate agent who advised an elderly owner to sell a residential rental 
fourplex where the apartments were contiguous but each rental unit was on 
a separate lot. The agent advised this unsophisticated owner to sell all four 
units as a single property to a business associate of the agent. Then the new 

94
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
owner turned around and within less than 12 months had sold each of the 
four individual properties separately at a gross profit of over $1 million. The 
agent clearly knew that real estate sold in smaller increments generates a 
higher overall value. The aggrieved elderly owner filed suit against the agent.
Finding a good broker or agent
 
The key to finding a good broker or agent to assist you in the purchase of 
investment real estate is to narrow the field down to those individuals who are 
the best. Look for folks with the following qualifications:
 
✓ Full-time professional: Because the commissions earned on the sale of 
a large income property can be so great, you’ll find that almost every 
broker or agent will claim that she can represent you. But you want 
to eliminate those brokers or agents who are greedy, incompetent, or 
simply mediocre. Although many part-time real estate professionals sell 
single-family homes and condos, you’ll quickly find that the most quali-
fied real estate investment property agents are full-time.
 
✓ Expert in the geographic market and specific property type: Find 
someone who knows your market and the specific property type you’re 
seeking. This knowledge is especially important if you don’t live nearby. 
Avoid brokers who aren’t experts in your specific property type. For 
example, don’t use a broker who specializes in single-family homes and 
condominiums unless that’s your target market. Likewise, a commercial 
property broker is unlikely to have the best investment opportunities 
for your consideration with single-family investment property.
 
Some real estate investment books advise you to contact every broker or real 
estate agent who targets your preferred geographic area. Although casting 
a bigger net has some inherent attraction, our experience is that you should 
only work with one broker or agent at a time in a given market area.
Real estate agents can be a key source for new investment opportunities and 
general market information. This is where our advice about finding an experi-
enced agent who specializes in the types of properties you’re looking for and 
knows the local market pays off. These agents know buyers and sellers and 
also possess contacts for other services and products that you need as your 
real estate investment portfolio expands.
After narrowing down the candidates, many standard screening techniques 
can then be applied to pinpoint the top three that you should interview:
 
✓ Verify the professional’s license status: Most states have an online 
broker and agent database, so this step is simple. Confirm that their real 
estate license is current with no citations or disciplinary action for past 
or pending violations. If you’re using a real estate agent, check both the 
license status of the agent and her supervising broker. If the broker or 

95
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
agent has been disciplined by the state, inquire further to understand the 
relevance to your transaction. A suspension or temporary revocation of a 
license can be a serious issue — even if it was reinstated. The facts of the 
case may be material to your choice of a real estate professional.
 
✓ Check references: Get the names and numbers for at least three clients 
(in the geographical area where you’re seeking property) that the broker 
or agent has worked with in the past year. Investment real estate trans-
actions tend to be fewer than owner-occupied property transactions, so 
speaking with three or more clients from the last year maximizes your 
chances of speaking with clients other than the agent’s all-time favorites.
 
 Don’t just ask for the references; call them. And don’t just ask generic 
questions about whether the client was happy with the broker or agent. 
Dig deeper — find an agent who you can work with on investments that 
are critical to your long-term wealth-building goals. Ask questions about 
the types of properties and the geographic locations involved. Ask ques-
tions like, “Did the broker or agent assertively represent you and take 
charge of the transaction or did you have to initiate conversations?”
Consider these traits when investigating potential brokers and agents as well:
 
✓ Willingness to communicate with you: The number one complaint 
about real estate professionals is that they don’t keep their clients 
informed during transactions. You’re looking for someone with experi-
ence who isn’t necessarily the top producer, because you want someone 
who can take the time to communicate regularly with you.
 
✓ Interpersonal skills: A broker or agent needs to get along with you and 
with a whole host of others involved in a typical real estate deal: other 
agents, property sellers, inspectors, lenders, and so on. An agent needs 
to know how to put your interests first without upsetting others.
 
✓ Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotia-
tion, so you want a broker or agent with negotiating skills and lots of 
experience in larger transactions. Is your agent going to exhaust all 
avenues to get you the best deal possible? Most people don’t like the 
sometimes-aggravating process of negotiation, so they hire someone 
else to do it for them. Be sure to ask the agent’s former clients how the 
agent negotiated for them.
 
✓ Reputation for honesty, integrity, and patience: When it comes to the 
brokering of investment properties, the reputation of your representa-
tive can be critical. Brokers or agents with a track record of dealing 
fairly with their clients and their peers can greatly assist in gaining the 
cooperation of an adversarial seller. And gaining such cooperation is 
often needed to close a complicated transaction. Some strife is almost 
guaranteed when buying investment real estate — there are several 
opportunities where the transaction can unravel and only the trust-
worthiness, perseverance, and patience of the real estate professionals 
involved can keep the transaction on course.

Making the most of your agent
To get the best deals, timing is critical. You want your broker or agent to 
think of you first. To do this, you need to build a solid rapport with your 
agent, which you can do by building a track record of not wasting the time 
of your professional team. Because agents only get paid for deals they close, 
they’re not interested in investing time and energy with numerous potential 
buyers. They want serious buyers who will close the deal. Plus, if you garner 
a reputation of tying up properties and then renegotiating the deal or cancel-
ing the escrow, you’ll find that your offers won’t be accepted in the future. 
Sellers and their brokers don’t want to waste time with phantom buyers.
 
If you’re not interested in or not able to purchase a property at the time, 
explain your situation and thank them for thinking of you. A handwritten thank 
you note or simple gift also lets them know you appreciate their efforts — and 
keeps you at the top of their lists for the next opportunity.
Considering an Appraiser
Many real estate investors know appraisers solely in the role of providing the 
property valuation report required by lenders. And it’s generally in this role 
that investors can find appraisers to be a source of aggravation rather than a 
potential resource. However, an appraiser can be an effective team member 
if your real estate investment strategy involves buying and selling properties 
with somewhat-hidden opportunities to add value. Appraisers sometimes 
possess insight into real estate opportunities that others miss.
 
Appraisers can help you by telling you the current value of a property, but 
they bring real value as part of your real estate investment team by
 
✓ Providing insight into the factors that can lead to an increase in the 
market value of a property.
 
✓ Assisting you in maximizing the return on your investment in upgrades 
to distressed or fixer-upper properties.
 
✓ Giving you useful information on the demographics of the area and help-
ing to identify those properties that are distressed but have plenty of 
upside potential (properties requiring work in good neighborhoods).
One of Robert’s partners, a highly successful real estate investor in foreclo-
sure properties, has even hired an appraiser as an in-house member of his 
real estate investment team. Virtually every property that appears on the 
weekly Notice of Default list from the title company is reviewed first by the 
appraiser, who looks for properties that are located in the path of progress 

97
 Chapter 6: Building Your Team
and with some real upside potential if brought to marketable condition physi-
cally and aesthetically. (For more on Notice of Default, see Chapter 3; for 
information on getting in front of the path of progress, see Chapter 10.)
The appraiser is also able to assist in determining the as-is value and the cost 
of making the necessary repairs and upgrades to the property. This informa-
tion helps the investor establish the maximum price she should pay for the 
property, based on comparable sales in the market.
As many have learned from the debacles of the real estate collapse in the 
early-1990s and the late-2000s subprime disaster, appraisals are often an art 
and can be very subjective. You need to make sure you find an appraiser that 
has a comprehensive education and training in proper appraisal techniques 
and complies with USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice) set out by the Appraisal Foundation. The appraiser you use should 
have extensive product knowledge of your target property type (residential, 
commercial, and so on.) along with significant experience and market knowl-
edge in your area. Contact the local American Society of Appraisers and the 
Appraisal Institute for referrals. Like many of the top professionals you seek 
for your team, you should not simply look for the lowest price, because you 
may end up with inferior value.
Finding an Attorney
You may think that adding an attorney to your real estate investment team 
seems like an expensive luxury that you can’t afford. Indeed, you may be able 
to purchase properties when you’re just starting out as a real estate inves-
tor without consulting an attorney, because buying a small rental property 
is often not much different from purchasing your own home. The process is 
relatively simple with preprinted forms that seem so easy to complete. And 
you usually have an experienced real estate agent to guide you through the 
process. (See Chapter 13 for information on locating forms.)
For simple transactions, the retention of an attorney is strictly a function of 
whether attorneys are traditionally involved as the intermediary or closing 
agent. If you live in an area where attorneys aren’t usually involved in real 
estate transactions, an attorney may not be necessary. In some states, it’s 
essential to have an attorney actually handle the transaction and closing.
 
But we strongly suggest that you consult with an experienced real estate attor-
ney as your investments increase in size and complexity. With more compli-
cated transactions, have the attorney review the documents — even in states 
where the title or escrow company handles the paperwork and serves as the 
independent intermediary or closing agent. A good real estate attorney can 

98
Part I: Stacking Real Estate Up Against Other Investments 
help you structure proposed transactions. Particularly if you’re looking into a 
large transaction where you assume loans or you’re attempting to secure spe-
cial financing, a competent real estate attorney can be invaluable.
Robert’s late father, a real estate attorney, taught him early in his real estate 
investment career that the best time to consult with an attorney is before 
you finalize the proposed transaction. There is nothing your attorney can do 
to avoid legal snafus and expensive litigation if he isn’t hired to draft, review, 
and negotiate the terms of your proposed transaction in advance. Although 
such a review may cost you some money up front, it’s definitely much more 
economical than having to hire an attorney to get you out of a bind.
 
Seek an attorney who specializes in real estate purchasing and lease transac-
tions. Ideally, you’ll find one attorney or law firm that can assist you not only 
with your transactions but also with the drafting and review of other docu-
ments as you operate the property. In particular, look for attorneys who have 
specialized knowledge of tenant-landlord laws and the complicated issues sur-
rounding commercial leases.
Check references and find an attorney who has excellent communication 
skills and can explain complicated legal terms and documents in terms you 
understand. As with any professional, the old adage that “You get what you 
pay for” holds true more often than not. So remember that the lower hourly 
rate attorneys aren’t necessarily your better option, because more expen-
sive, yet more experienced, attorneys are your best bet when you’re invest-
ing in large real estate transactions.

How to Get the Money: 
Raising Capital and 
Financing

In this part . . .
I
n this important part, we detail the amount of money 
you need to have in hand for various real estate invest-
ments, as well as where you can go to borrow the rest 
(because few real estate investors buy property with 100 
percent cash). In addition to discussing traditional lend-
ing sources, we also cover seller financing of properties. 
Last but not least, we explain how to save money and get 
the best loan for your situation.

Chapter 7
Sources of Capital
In This Chapter
▶ Moving beyond the no-money-down myth
▶ Knowing what you need to get going in real estate
▶ Locating cash
F
or many people, the trouble with real estate investing is that they lack the 
access to cash for the down payment. The old adage that “it takes money 
to make money” is generally true in our experience. Most real estate invest-
ing books make one of two assumptions. Some assume that you have plenty 
of money and just need to figure out how to buy, add value to a property, and 
then sell. Of course, it would be great if that were true, but not everyone is flush 
with cash. The other common assumption is that you have no money and must 
resort to scouring the real estate market in search of sellers so desperate to sell 
that they or their lenders don’t require any down payment. We assume neither.
So how do you get started in real estate if you don’t want to own distressed 
properties in the worst neighborhoods, and you don’t have a six-figure bal-
ance in your checking account to pay top dollar in the best neighborhoods? 
You muster all the patience you can and embrace a long-term vision. You don’t 
have to be wealthy or have great savings to begin making attractive real estate 
investments. In this book, we present a wide range of investment options, so 
there’s something for virtually everyone’s budget and personal situation. Our 
method of building real estate wealth over time is to create investment returns 
that are sustainable and provide generous returns on your investments.
Calculating the Costs of Admission
 
At some point in your life, you’ve surely had the experience of wanting to do 
something and then realizing that you don’t have sufficient money to accom-
plish your goal. Perhaps it was as simple as lacking the pocket change to buy 
a chocolate bar as a child. Or maybe it happened on a vacation when you ran 
low on funds and tried to do business with a merchant who only took Visa 
when you only carried American Express. No matter — the world of real estate 
investing is no different. You can’t play if you can’t pay.

102
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Forgetting the myth of no money down
The title of this chapter says it all: To invest in real estate, you need capital, 
and likewise you need a source from which to gather said capital. On late-night 
infomercials, at seminars, on audiotapes, and in books, you may hear many 
self-appointed real estate experts tell you that you can invest in real estate with 
literally no money. And if that’s not enticing enough, you may hear that you 
can buy properties where the seller will put cash in your hands.
 
Have such no-money-down situations ever existed among the billions of com-
pleted real estate transactions in the history of the modern world? Why, yes 
they have. Realistically, can you find such opportunities among the best real 
estate investing options available to you? Why, no you can’t.
Think of the people you know who still haven’t found the perfect mate after 
decades of searching. Mr. and Ms. Perfect don’t exist. Ditto the ideal real estate 
investment. If you use our sensible criteria when seeking out properties that’ll 
be good real estate investments and then add the requirement that you can 
only make such investments with no money down, you’ll probably waste years 
searching to no avail. We’ve never made a no-money-down real estate invest-
ment because the best properties simply aren’t available on that basis.
 
Our experience is that the no-money-down properties we have seen aren’t 
properties we want to own. And if you receive cash out of escrow upon clos-
ing on a property, you’re either buying a severely distressed property that will 
soon require major cash infusions or you’ve overleveraged the property. If it 
sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true! For a more complete dis-
cussion of no money down, please see Chapter 5.
Getting in the door with good credit
Don’t underestimate the importance of estab-
lishing good credit, because the best returns on 
real estate rely upon the use of credit to obtain 
the leverage of using OPM (other people’s 
money). Lenders, property sellers, potential 
partners, and so on all prefer to deal with you if 
you’ve established a reputation for paying your 
bills. Good to great credit is essential. Why pay 
more for money when you can show the ability 
to handle it properly and be rewarded with a 
lower price?
Both of us began building our credit through 
the responsible use of credit cards in our 20s 
(paying monthly bills in full), and to this day, our 
high FICO scores have allowed us to borrow 
at favorable rates and terms and save tens of 
thousands of dollars per year in financing costs. 
And that difference will sometimes enable you 
to make a deal work that otherwise won’t. We 
cover the importance of good credit and ways 
to remove unsightly blemishes on your credit 
history that may keep you from getting solid 
interest rates in Chapter 9.

103
 Chapter 7: Sources of Capital
Determining what you need to get started
 
Most of the time, real estate investors make a down payment and borrow the 
majority of the money needed to complete a purchase. That is the conven-
tional way to purchase real estate investment properties and will be the most 
successful method for you in the long run (as it has been for us).
In order to qualify for the most attractive financing, lenders typically require 
that your down payment be at least 20 percent of the property’s purchase 
price. The best investment property loans sometimes require 25 to 30 per-
cent down for the most favorable terms. Lenders tend to be more conserva-
tive and require larger down payments during periods of falling real estate 
prices such as most areas experienced in the late-2000s.
For most residential investment properties, such as single-family homes, 
attached housing such as condos and townhomes, and small apartment 
buildings of up to four units, you can get access to the best financing terms 
by making at least a 20 to 25 percent down payment. (Mortgages on non-
owner-occupied property tend to be 1/4 to 1/2 percent higher). You may be 
able to make smaller down payments (as low as 10 percent or less), but you’ll 
pay much higher interest rates and loan fees, including private mortgage 
insurance. (We cover the topic of financing in Chapter 8.)
You won’t find such wonderful financing options for larger apartment build-
ings (five or more units), commercial real estate, and raw land. Compared 
with residential properties of up to four units, such investment property gen-
erally requires more money down and/or higher interest rates and loan fees. 
Please see Chapter 8 for more details.
Determining how much cash you need to close on a purchase is largely a 
function of the estimated purchase price. Suppose you’re looking to buy 
some modest residential housing for $100,000. For a 25 percent down pay-
ment you need $25,000, and adding in another 5 percent for closing costs 
brings you to $30,000. If you have your heart set on buying a property that 
costs three times as much ($300,000 sticker price), you need to triple these 
amounts to a total of about $90,000 for the best financing options.
Rounding Up the Required 
Cash by Saving
Most successful real estate investors that we know, including us, got started 
building their real estate investment portfolio the old-fashioned way — 
through saving money and then gradually buying properties over the years. 

104
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Many people have difficulty saving money because they don’t know how to 
or are simply unwilling to limit their spending. Easy access to consumer debt 
(through credit cards and auto loans) creates huge obstacles to saving more 
and spending less.
Investing in real estate requires self-control, sacrifice, and discipline. Like 
most good things in life, you must be patient and plan ahead to be able to 
invest in real estate.
As young adults, some (but not most) people are good savers out of the gate. 
Those who save regularly are often folks who acquired sound financial habits 
from their parents. Other good savers have a high level of motivation to 
accomplish goals such as retiring young, starting a business, buying a home, 
having the flexibility to spend time with their kids, and so on. Achieving such 
goals is much harder (if not impossible) when you’re living paycheck to pay-
check and worried about next month’s pile of bills.
 
If you’re not satisfied with how much of your monthly earnings you’re able to 
save, you have two options (and you can take advantage of both):
 
✓ Boost your income: To increase your take-home pay, working more 
may be a possibility, or you may be able to take a more lucrative career 
path. Our main advice on this topic is to keep your priorities in order. 
You shouldn’t put your personal health and relationships on the back 
burner for a workaholic schedule. We also believe in investing in your 
education. A solid education is the path to greater financial rewards and 
leads to all of the great goals we discuss here. Education is key not only 
for your chosen profession but also for real estate investing. Consider 
getting a real estate license or learn to be an appraiser or property man-
ager — skills that not only help you with your property investing but 
that also may allow you to take on part-time work to supplement your 
income.
 
✓ Reduce your spending: For most people, this is the path to increased 
savings. We have both routinely generated cash flow for investments 
by living well beneath our means. Start by analyzing how much you 
expend on different areas (for instance, food, clothing, insurance) each 
month. After you’ve got the data, decide where and how you want to 
cut back. Would you rather eat out less or have a maid come less often? 
How about driving a less expensive (but not less safe) car versus taking 
lower cost vacations? Although the possibilities to reduce your spend-
ing are many, you and only you can decide which options you’re willing 
and able to implement. If you need more help with this vital financial 
topic, consult the latest edition of Eric’s bestseller Personal Finance For 
Dummies (Wiley).

 Chapter 7: Sources of Capital
Overcoming Down Payment Limitations
Most people, especially when they make their first real estate purchase, are 
strapped for cash. If you don’t have 20-plus percent of the purchase price, 
don’t panic and don’t get depressed — you can still own real estate. We’ve 
got some solutions — you can either change your approach, allowing you 
more time to save or lowering your entry fees, or you can seek other sources 
of funding. In the following section, we lay out your options.
Changing your approach
Some ways you can alter your approach without having to find money else-
where are as follows:
 
✓ Seek low money down loans with private mortgage insurance: Some lend-
ers may offer you a mortgage even though you may be able to put down 
only 10 percent of the purchase price. These lenders will likely require you 
to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) for your loan. This insur-
ance generally costs several hundred dollars per year and protects the 
lender if you default on your loan. (When you do have at least 20 percent 
or higher equity in the property, you can generally eliminate the PMI.)
 
✓ Delay your gratification: If you don’t want the cost and strain of extra 
fees and bad mortgage terms, postpone your purchase. Boost your sav-
ings rate. Examine your current spending habits and plan to build up a 
nest egg to use to invest in your first rental. Often real estate investors 
get started by actually buying a new home and simply keeping their old 
home as a rental. For more information, see the section “Make saving a 
habit” later in the chapter.
 
✓ Think smaller: Consider lower-priced properties. Smaller properties and 
ones that need some work can help keep down the purchase price and 
the required down payment. For example, a duplex where you live in 
one unit and rent out the other is also a cost-effective way to get started.
 
✓ Turn to low entry cost options: For the ultimate in low entry costs, real 
estate investment trusts (REITs) are best. These stock exchange traded 
securities (which can also be bought through REIT-focused mutual 
funds) can be bought into for several thousand dollars or less. REIT 
mutual funds can often be purchased for $1000 or less inside retirement 
accounts. (See Chapter 4 for more on investing in REITs.)
 
 Lease options represent another low cost (although more complicated) 
opportunity. With these, you begin by renting a property you may be 
interested in purchasing down the road. In the interim, a portion of your 
monthly rental payment goes toward the future purchase price. If you 
can find a seller willing to provide financing, you can keep your down 
payment to a minimum. Turn to Chapter 3 for more on lease options.

106
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Tapping into other common cash sources
Saving money from your monthly earnings will probably be the foundation 
for your real estate investing program. However, you may have access to 
other financial resources for down payments. Before we jump into these, we 
offer a friendly little reminder: Monitor how much of your overall investment 
portfolio you place into real estate and how diversified and appropriate your 
holdings are given your overall goals. (Please see Chapter 1).
Dipping into your retirement savings
Some employers allow you to borrow against your retirement account bal-
ance, under the condition that you repay the loan within a set number of 
years. Subject to eligibility requirements, first-time homebuyers can make 
penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from IRA accounts. (Note: You 
still must pay regular income tax on the withdrawal, which can significantly 
reduce the cash available.)
Borrowing against home equity
Most real estate investors that we know began building their real estate 
portfolio after they bought their own home. Conservatively tapping into 
your home’s equity may be a good down payment source for your property 
investments.
 
You can generally obtain mortgage money at a lower interest rate on your 
home than you can on investment property. The smaller the risk to the lender, 
the lower its required return — and thus, the better rates for you as the bor-
rower. Lenders view rental property as a higher risk proposition and for good 
reason: They know that when finances go downhill and the going gets really 
tough, people pay their home mortgage to avoid losing the roof over their 
heads before they pay debts on a rental property.
 
Unless your current mortgage was locked in at lower rates than are available 
today, we generally recommend refinancing the first loan and freeing up 
equity that way versus taking out a home equity loan or line of credit.
A variation on the borrowing-against-home-equity idea uses the keep-your-
original-home-as-a-rental strategy. You build up significant equity in your 
owner-occupied home and then need or want a new home. Refinance the 
existing home (while you still live there, for the best owner-occupied rates) 
and then convert it into a rental. Take the tax-free proceeds from the refi-
nance and use that as the down payment on your new owner-occupied home.

107
 Chapter 7: Sources of Capital
Before you go running out to borrow to the maximum against your home, be 
sure that you
 
✓ Can handle the larger payments: In the previous edition of this book, 
we said,
“We don’t recommend borrowing more than the value of your home, as you 
may be enticed to do with some of the loan programs that pitch borrowing 
upwards of 125 percent of the value of your home. We hear these programs 
being routinely touted as not only a way to free up equity and pay down 
consumer debt, but also encouraging people to borrow in excess of the 
current value of their home so they can invest in more real estate. This 
excessive leveraging is dangerous and could come back to haunt you!”
 
 We’re proud to have provided this sage advice before the real estate 
crisis hit home in the late-2000s. Please see Chapter 1 for the big picture 
on personal financial considerations.
 
✓ Understand the tax ramifications of all your alternatives: Borrowing 
more against your home at what appears to be a slightly lower rate may 
end up costing you more after taxes if some of the borrowing isn’t tax 
deductible. Under current tax laws, interest paid on home mortgages 
(first and second homes) of up to $1 million is tax deductible. You may 
also deduct the interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000.
 
 Be careful to understand the tax-deductibility issue when you refinance 
a home mortgage and borrow more than you originally had outstanding 
on the prior loan. If any of the extra amount borrowed isn’t used to buy, 
build, or improve your primary or secondary residence, the deductibil-
ity of the interest on the excess amount borrowed is limited. Specifically, 
you may not deduct the interest on the extra amount borrowed that 
exceeds the $100,000 home equity limit.
 
✓ Fully comprehend the risks of losing your home to foreclosure: The 
more you borrow against your home, the greater the risk that you may 
lose the roof over your head to foreclosure should you not be able to 
make your mortgage payments. That’s exactly what happened to too 
many folks during the late-2000s real estate market decline.
Moving financial investments into property investments
As you gain more comfort and confidence as a real estate investor, you may 
want to redirect some of your dollars from other investments like stocks, 
bonds, and mutual funds into property. If you do, be mindful of the following:
 
✓ Diversification: Real estate is one of the prime investments (the others 
being stocks and small business) for long-term appreciation potential. 
Be sure that you understand your portfolio’s overall asset allocation and 
risk when making changes. Please see Chapter 1 for more details.

108
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
✓ Tax issues: If you’ve held other investments for more than one year, you 
can take advantage of the low long-term capital gains tax rates if you 
now want to sell. The maximum federal tax rate for so-called long-term 
capital gains (investments sold for more than they were purchased for 
after more than 12 months) is now just 15 percent. Investors in the two 
lowest federal income tax brackets of 10 and 15 percent enjoy a 0 per-
cent long-term capital gains tax rate. Try to avoid selling appreciated 
investments within the first year of ownership. Be sure to check on the 
latest tax laws because there’s no guarantee these rates will continue in 
the future.
Separating investments from cash value life insurance
You may own a cash value life insurance policy — one that combines a life 
insurance death benefit with a savings type account in which some money 
accumulates and on which interest is paid. In addition to being a costly cash 
drain with its relatively high premiums, cash value life insurance investment 
returns tend to be mediocre to dismal.
 
You’re best off separating your life insurance purchases from your investing. If 
you need life insurance (because others are dependent on your income), buy 
a term life policy, which is pure, unadulterated life insurance. But don’t cancel 
your current cash value policies before replacing them with term if you do 
indeed need life insurance protection.
Robert had a $500,000 whole life policy that he was sold when he was much 
younger and more naive — and before he knew of Eric and his financial 
advice! He ultimately decided to cash out the policy, the proceeds from 
which he used to invest in an apartment deal. So rather than earning a 
meager few percent per year in a cash value life policy, Robert has since 
enjoyed double-digit annualized returns in a good real estate investment.
Capitalizing on advanced 
funding strategies
Sophisticated investors who develop an extensive real estate investment 
portfolio can employ more complicated strategies. In this section, we outline 
those along with our advice for how to make them work.
Leveraging existing real estate investments
Over time, if the initial properties you buy do what they’re supposed to do, 
they’ll appreciate in value. Thus, you may be able to take extra tax-free cash 
from your successful investments to make more purchases. This tactic is 

109
 Chapter 7: Sources of Capital
called hypothecating your real estate. As we discuss in the section “Borrowing 
against home equity” earlier in this chapter, many investors begin by employ-
ing this strategy with their owner-occupied home. They buy a home, it appre-
ciates over the years, and then they tap that equity to fund other real estate 
purchases. By the same token, as you acquire more properties and they then 
appreciate, you can tap their equity for other purchases.
 
As you build a real estate empire, you must exercise care not to overextend 
yourself. The downside to continually pulling equity out of appreciated prop-
erties is that your fortunes may change. If the local real estate market or econ-
omy hit difficult times as happened in some areas in the late-2000s, you may 
find yourself with vacancies and falling rents. In the worst cases, excessively 
leveraged real estate investors have ended up losing some properties or even 
bankrupt.
Bringing in partners or other investors
If smaller, lower-priced properties don’t satisfy your desires, you may be 
able to find a partner. For example, find a duplex and get a partner where you 
both initially occupy the property and make the payments, because duplexes 
are typically more cost-effective per unit than unattached properties. 
Especially to accomplish larger deals, you may need or want to invest with a 
partner or other investors for the sake of diversification and risk reduction. 
Bringing in a partner can also provide additional financial resources for down 
payments and capital improvements as well as greater borrowing capability.
 
Partners can be either the best thing or the worst thing that ever happened 
to you. Although the additional financial resources are essential when you’re 
starting out in real estate, attempt to find partners with complementary skills 
to really take advantage of the potential of real estate investment partnerships.
For example, Robert has focused on establishing partnerships where each 
partner brings a needed skill to the table. One partnership consisted of a 
top local real estate broker who identified properties along with a partner 
who was a real estate lender and knew the ins and outs of lending. Robert’s 
company provided the property and asset management to reposition the 
property and create value. This team used their complementary skills to suc-
cessfully purchase, renovate, and later resell a 48-unit apartment building 
while providing cash distributions to the partners during the holding period.
 
With the assistance of a good attorney, prepare a legal contract to specify 
(among other issues) what happens if a partner wants out. A buy/sell agree-
ment makes a lot of sense because it outlines the terms and conditions in 
advance for how partnership assets can be redistributed. With life events 
(death, divorces, new marriages) constantly changing partnerships, having a 

110
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
buy/sell agreement in place at the time the partnership is initially established 
prevents bickering down the road. Partnership disputes often enrich attor-
neys and accountants, rather than the partners or their intended beneficiaries.
Family members sometimes make good partners. Parents, grandparents, 
and perhaps even siblings may have some extra cash they want to loan or 
invest. But some families aren’t suited for partnering to buy and operate real 
estate. Disputes over management style, cash distributions versus reinvest-
ing in the property, and how and when to sell are difficult in any partnership 
but particularly in families where there may be different goals based on the 
age or personal desires of the family members. If you already don’t get along 
well at family gatherings, throw in a real estate partnership to really get the 
fireworks going! To minimize the potential problems, we strongly suggest 
documenting any real estate investment or lending relationship in writing 
just as diligently as you would with a non–family member. When working 
with family, you may be better off borrowing money with a promissory note, 
a repayment plan, and interest payments. Check out Chapter 14 for more on 
partnerships.
Seeking seller financing
You may be able to find some properties that your research suggests offer 
potentially attractive investment returns and for which the seller may be will-
ing to extend financing. Some property owners or developers may finance 
your purchase with as little as 10 percent or even less down. This method 
can be an extremely beneficial way to buy real estate when your cash posi-
tion is limited. You can often set up the transaction as an installment sale so 
that the seller has the added benefit of stretching the reporting of income 
over a period of time and thus reducing her tax liability. You conserve your 
cash; the seller reduces her taxable income.
The drawback with seller-financed properties is that you can’t be as picky 
about what you get; a limited supply is available, and many properties 
offered with seller financing need work or haven’t yet sold for other reasons. 
Often these are reasons that only become apparent after you’re the owner!
 
Avoid properties that are distressed (have major problems and flaws). Don’t 
get sucked in by great financing alone; only consider purchasing a property 
with seller financing that you would be willing to buy conventionally. The 
seller financing should just be an extra benefit, not the only benefit! Please see 
Chapter 8 for details.
Taking on margin debt
In the section “Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments” earlier in 
this chapter, we cover selling some of your non–real estate investments in 
order to raise capital for property purchases. If you own stocks and other 

111
 Chapter 7: Sources of Capital
securities in a brokerage account, you can actually borrow funds against 
those investments. For example, if you’re the proud owner of $100,000 worth 
of so-called marginable securities in a brokerage account, you may be able to 
borrow up to $50,000 at attractive interest rates, typically a little lower than 
on fixed rate mortgages for a home.
In addition to providing you with a relatively low-cost source of funds, utiliz-
ing margin debt for real estate purchases also enables you to hold onto more 
securities, which can better diversify your real estate holdings.
 
Be careful when using margin debt. Stocks, bonds, and other investments 
can drop in value, sometimes sharply. When that happens as it did in 2008, 
you may face what is known as a margin call, where you have to increase the 
equity in your brokerage account, either by adding cash to it directly or by 
selling some of your securities. Having to sell during tough times can force 
you to liquidate shares at low prices. To add insult to injury, a significant 
stock market decline like the ones that occurred in 2008 or in the early-1990s, 
can coincide with a slumping real estate market.

W
e know property investors who spent dozens to hundreds of hours 
finding the best locations and properties only to have their deals 
unravel when they were unable to gain approval for needed financing. You 
can’t play if you can’t pay.
This chapter covers the financing options you should consider (and high-
lights those that you should avoid). We explain how to select the mortgage 
that is most appropriate for the property you’re buying and your overall 
personal and financial situation. In Chapter 9, we cover the actual process of 
applying for and locking up the specific loan you want.
Taking a Look at Mortgage Options
Although you can find thousands of different types of mortgages (thanks to 
all the various bells and whistles available), only two major categories of 
mortgages exist: fixed interest rate and adjustable rate. Technically speaking, 
some mortgages combine elements of both — they may remain fixed for a 
number of years and then have a variable interest rate after that. This section 
discusses these major loan types, what features they typically have, and how 
you can intelligently compare them with each other and select the one that 
best fits with your investment property purchases.

114
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Fixed-rate mortgages
Fixed-rate mortgages, which are typically for a 15- or 30-year term for single-
family properties, condos, and one- to four-unit apartments, have interest 
rates that remain constant over the life of the loan. Because the interest rate 
stays the same, your monthly mortgage payment stays the same.
Examining the pros and cons
For purposes of making future estimates of your property’s cash flow, fixed-
rate mortgages offer you certainty and some peace of mind because you 
know precisely the size of your mortgage payment next month, next year, 
and ten years from now. (Of course, the other costs of owning investment 
property — such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on — 
still escalate over the years.) But this piece of mind comes at a price:
 
✓ You generally pay a premium, in the form of a higher interest rate, 
compared with loans that have an adjustable interest rate over time. If 
you’re buying a property and planning to improve it and sell it within 
five to ten years, you may be throwing money away by taking out a fixed-
rate loan to lock in an interest rate for decades.
 
✓ If, like most investment property buyers, you’re facing a tough time 
generating a healthy positive cash flow in the early years of owning a 
particular investment property, a fixed-rate mortgage is going to make it 
even more financially challenging. An adjustable-rate mortgage, by con-
trast, can lower your property’s carrying costs in those early years. (We 
discuss adjustable-rate mortgages in the next section.)
 
✓ Fixed-rate loans carry the risk that if interest rates fall significantly after 
you obtain your mortgage and you’re unable to refinance, you’re stuck 
with a relatively higher-cost mortgage. For example, you may be unable 
to refinance if you lose your job, your employment income declines, the 
value of your property decreases, or the property’s rental income slides. 
Also remember that even if you’re able to refinance, you’ll probably 
have to spend significant time and money to get it done.
Making a point of comparing fixed rates
In addition to the ongoing, constant interest rate charged on a fixed-rate 
mortgage, lenders also typically levy an upfront fee, called points, which 
can be considered prepaid interest. Points are generally a percentage of the 
amount borrowed. To illustrate, 1.5 points are equal to 1.5 percent of the loan 
amount. So, for example, on a $200,000 mortgage, 1.5 points translate into a 
$3,000 upfront (also known as prepaid) interest. Points can add significantly 
to the cost of borrowing money, particularly if you don’t plan to keep the 
loan for long.

115
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
 
Generally speaking, the more points you pay on a given loan, the lower the 
ongoing interest rate the lender charges on that loan. That’s why you can’t 
compare various lenders’ fixed-rate loans to one another unless you know the 
exact points on each specific mortgage, in addition to that loan’s ongoing 
interest rate.
The following are two approaches to dealing with points, given your financial 
situation and investment goals:
 
✓ Minimize the points: When you’re running low on cash to close on a 
mortgage, or if you don’t plan to hold the loan or property for long, you 
probably want to keep your points (and other loan fees discussed in the 
next section) to a minimum. You may want to take a higher interest rate 
on your mortgage.
 
✓ Pay more points: If you’re more concerned with keeping your ongoing 
costs low, plan to hold the property for many years, and aren’t cash con-
strained to close on the loan now, consider paying more points to lower 
your interest rate. This is known as buying down the loan rate and can 
be an excellent strategy to lower your overall costs of borrowing and 
increase the property’s cash flow and equity buildup.
 
To make an easier apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages from different 
lenders, get interest rate quotes at the same point level. For example, ask each 
lender for the interest rate on a particular fixed-rate mortgage for which you 
pay one point or two points, for example. You may also compare the annual 
percentage rate (APR), which is a summary loan cost measure that includes all 
of a loan’s fees and costs. However, please remember that the APR assumes 
that you hold the mortgage for its entire term — such as 15 or 30 years. If you 
end up keeping the loan for a shorter time period, either because you refi-
nance or pay off the mortgage early, the APR isn’t valid and accurate (unless 
you recalculate based on the changed term and payoff).
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) carry an interest rate that varies over time. 
An ARM starts with a particular interest rate, usually a good deal lower than 
the going rate on comparable length (15- or 30-year) fixed-rate mortgages, 
and then you pay different rates for every year, possibly even every month, 
during a 30-year mortgage. Because the interest rate on an ARM changes over 
time, so too does the size of the loan’s monthly payment. ARMs are often 
attractive for a number of reasons:

116
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
✓ You can start paying your mortgage with a relatively low initial inter-
est rate compared with fixed-rate loans. Given the economics of a typi-
cal investment property purchase, ARMs better enable an investor to 
achieve a positive cash flow in the early years of property ownership.
 
✓ Should interest rates decline, you can realize most, if not all, of the ben-
efits of lower rates without the cost and hassle of refinancing. With a 
fixed-rate mortgage, the only way to benefit from an overall decline in 
the market level of interest rates is to refinance.
ARMs come with many more features and options than do fixed-rate mort-
gages, including caps, indexes, margins, and adjustment periods. The follow-
ing sections help you to understand these important ARM features.
Start rate
The start rate on an ARM is the interest rate the mortgage begins with. Don’t 
be fooled though: You don’t pay this tantalizingly low rate for too long. That 
is why it’s often called a teaser rate. The start rate on most ARMs is set arti-
ficially low to entice you. In other words, even if the market level of interest 
rates doesn’t change, your ARM is destined to increase as soon as the terms 
of the loan allow (more on this topic in a minute). An increase of one or two 
percentage points is common. The formula for determining the future inter-
est rates on an ARM and rate caps is far more important in determining what 
a mortgage is going to cost you in the long run.
Future interest rate
The first important thing to ask a mortgage lender or broker about an ARM 
you’re contemplating is the formula for determining the future interest rate 
on your loan. ARMs are based on the following formula:
Future Interest Rate = Index + Margin
The index is a designated measure of the market interest rate that the lender 
chooses to calculate the specific interest rate for your loan. Indexes are gen-
erally (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press. The margin is 
the amount added to the index to determine the interest rate that you pay on 
your mortgage.
For example, suppose that the loan you’re considering uses a one-year trea-
sury bill index, which is currently 4 percent, and the loan you’re considering 
has a margin of 2.75 percent (also often referred to as 275 basis points; 100 
basis points equals 1 percent). Thus, the following formula would drive the 
rate of this mortgage:
One-Year Treasury Bill Rate (4 percent) + Margin (2.75 percent)

117
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Do the math and you get 6.75 percent. This figure is known as the fully 
indexed rate (the rate the loan has after the initial rate expires and if the 
index stays constant). If this loan starts out at just 4 percent, you know that 
if the one-year Treasury bill index remains at the same level, your loan can 
increase to 6.75 percent. If this index rises one percent to 5 percent during 
the period that you’re covered by the ARM’s start rate, that means the loan’s 
fully indexed rate goes to 7.75 percent (5.00 + 2.75), which is three percent 
higher than the loan’s start rate.
 
Compare the fully indexed rate on an ARM you’re considering to the current 
rate for a comparable term fixed-rate loan. You may see that the fixed-rate 
loan is at about the same interest rate, which may lead you to reconsider your 
choice of an ARM that carries the risk of rising to a higher future level.
Understanding ARM indexes
The different indexes used on ARMs vary mainly in how rapidly they respond 
to changes in interest rates. If you select an adjustable-rate mortgage tied 
to one of the faster-moving indexes, you take on more of a risk that the next 
adjustment may reflect interest rate increases. When you take on more of the 
risk that rates may increase, lenders cut you breaks in other ways, such as 
through lower caps (the maximum rate increase possible over a given time 
period; see “Future interest rate adjustments” later in the chapter), lower 
margins or lower points.
Should you want the security of an ARM tied to a slower-moving index, you 
pay for that security in one form or another, such as a higher start rate, caps, 
margin, or points. You may also pay in other, less-obvious ways. A slower-
moving index, such as the 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI, discussed 
later), lags behind general changes in market interest rates, so it continues 
to rise after interest rates peak and goes down slower after rates have turned 
down. The following list covers some of these indexes.
 
✓ Treasury bills (T-bills) are IOUs that the U.S. government issues. Most 
ARMs are tied to the interest rate on 6-month or 12-month T-bills (also 
referred to as the one-year constant maturity Treasury index). This is a 
relatively rapidly moving index. Some investment property mortgages 
are tied to the rate on ten-year Treasury Notes. Being a somewhat longer-
term bond, a ten-year index doesn’t generally move as rapidly as the 
shorter-term indexes.
 
✓ Certificates of deposit (CDs) are interest-bearing bank deposits that lock 
the depositor in at a set interest rate for a specific period of time. ARMs 
are usually tied to the average interest rate that banks are paying on six-
month CDs. Like T-bills, CDs tend to respond quickly to changes in the 
market’s level of interest rates.

118
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
✓ London Interbank Offered Rate Index (LIBOR) is an average of the rate 
of interest that major international banks charge each other to borrow 
large sums of U.S. dollars, which is commonly referred to by real estate 
lenders as an index for their adjustable loans. LIBOR tends to move and 
adjust quite rapidly to changes in interest rates and is at times even 
more volatile than the U.S. Treasury or CD index rates.
 
✓ Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is a relatively slow-moving 
index. Adjustable-rate mortgages tied to the 11th District Cost of Funds 
Index tend to start out at a higher interest rate. A slower-moving index 
has the advantage of moving up less quickly when rates are on the rise. 
On the other hand, you have to be patient to benefit from falling interest 
rates.
 
 In a relatively low-interest rate environment, such as in the early-2000s, 
few lenders offer COFI loans. This illustrates the point that lenders don’t 
always offer the same choice of indexes. Rather, each lender offers one 
or typically no more than two indexes, and borrowers should specifically 
look at the index as part of their overall decision on choosing a lender.
Future interest rate adjustments
After the initial interest rate ends, the interest rate on an ARM fluctuates 
based on the loan formula. Typically, ARM interest rates change every 6 or 
12 months, but some adjust every month. In advance of each adjustment, the 
lender sends you a notice telling you your new rate. Be sure to check these 
notices because on rare occasions, lenders make mistakes.
Almost all ARMs come with a rate cap, which limits the maximum rate change 
(up or down) allowed at each adjustment. This limit is usually referred to as 
the adjustment cap. On most loans that adjust every six months, the adjust-
ment cap is 1 percent; the interest rate charged on the mortgage can move 
up or down no more than one percentage point in an adjustment period.
Loans that adjust more than once per year usually limit the maximum rate 
change that’s allowed over the entire year as well — known as the annual 
rate cap. On the vast majority of such loans, 2 percent is the annual rate cap. 
Likewise, almost all ARMs come with lifetime caps, which represent the high-
est rate allowed over the entire life of the loan. Lifetime caps of 5 to 6 percent 
higher than the initial start rate are common for adjustables.
 
Taking an ARM without rate caps is like heading out for a weeklong outdoor 
trek without appropriate rain gear. When you consider an adjustable-rate 
mortgage, you must identify the maximum payment that you can handle. If 
you can’t handle the payment that comes with a 10 or 11 percent interest 
rate, for example, don’t look at ARMs that may go that high. As you crunch 
the numbers to see what your property’s cash flow looks like under different 
circumstances (see Chapter 12), consider calculating how your mortgage 
payment changes based on various higher interest rates.

119
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Avoiding negative amortization ARMs
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe 
is gradually reduced or amortized. Negative amortization (when your loan 
balance increases) is the reverse of this process. Some ARMs allow nega-
tive amortization. How can your outstanding loan balance grow when you 
continue to make mortgage payments? This phenomenon occurs when your 
mortgage payment is less than it really should be.
 
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment amount but don’t cap 
the interest rate. Thus, the size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all 
the interest that you currently owe on your loan. So, rather than paying the 
interest that you owe and paying off some of your loan balance (or principal) 
every month, you end up paying off some, but not all, of the interest that you 
owe. Thus, lenders add the extra, unpaid interest that you still owe to your 
outstanding debt.
Negative amortization is similar to paying only the minimum payment that 
your credit card bill requires. You continue to rack up finance charges (in 
this case, greater interest) on the balance as long as you only make the arti-
ficially low payment. Taking a loan with negative amortization defeats the 
whole purpose of borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals.
 
Avoid ARMs with negative amortization. The only way to know whether a 
loan includes negative amortization is to explicitly ask. Some lenders and 
mortgage brokers aren’t forthcoming about telling you. If you have trouble 
finding lenders that will deal with your financial situation, make sure that 
you’re especially careful — you find negative amortization more frequently 
on loans that lenders consider risky.
Reviewing Other Common Fees
Whether the loan is fixed or adjustable, mortgage lenders typically assess 
other upfront fees and charges. These ancillary fees can really amount 
to quite a bundle with some lenders. Here’s our take on the typical extra 
charges you’re likely to encounter and what’s reasonable and what’s not:
 
✓ Application fee: Most lenders charge several hundred dollars to work 
with you to complete your paperwork and see it through their loan eval-
uation process. Should your loan be rejected, or if it’s approved and you 
decide not to take it, the lender needs to cover its costs. Most lenders 
credit or return this fee to you upon closing with their loan.
 
✓ Credit report charge: Most lenders charge you for the cost of obtaining 
your credit report, which tells the lender whether you’ve repaid other 
loans, including consumer debt (such as credit cards, auto loans, and 
so on), on time. Your credit report should cost about $50 for each indi-
vidual or entity that will be a borrower.

120
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
✓ Appraisal fee: The property for which you borrow money needs to 
be valued. If you default on your mortgage, a lender doesn’t want to 
get stuck with a property that’s worth less than you owe. The cost for 
appraisal typically ranges from several hundred dollars for most resi-
dential properties to as much as $1,000 or more for larger investment 
properties. (On particularly large properties, this fee can be more sig-
nificant — on a 30,000-square-foot office building, an appraisal may run 
around $5,000; on a 300-plus-unit apartment building, it is more in the 
$10,000 range.)
 
✓ Environmental assessment or phase I: Virtually all lenders making loans 
on residential properties with five or more units or, especially, com-
mercial property, require a qualified engineering company to perform a 
site assessment and overview of the entire area in which the property 
is located to identify possible environmental issues. This type of report 
is commonly referred to as a phase I environmental report, and the cost 
directly correlates to the location, type of property, size, and even the 
prior use of the property and the surrounding area. Phase I reports can 
run from $300 to as much as tens of thousands of dollars. (We include 
more details in Chapter 14.)
 
✓ Third-party physical inspection: Depending on the property being 
financed, lenders often require third-party inspections by competent 
professionals. For example, an inspection report from a licensed pest 
control firm documenting the property condition and specifically the 
presence of termites and/or wood-destroying organisms is required in 
virtually all transactions, including single-family homes and commercial 
properties. Again, the cost of these reports varies depending on the 
property. (More details to come in Chapter 14.)
No-point mortgages aren’t no-brainers
Some property buyers are attracted to no-point 
or zero-cost mortgages (which also some-
times have no other loan fees or costs either). 
Remember that if a loan has no points, it’s sure 
to have a higher interest rate. That’s not to say 
that no-point loans are better or worse than 
comparable loans from other lenders, but don’t 
get duped into a loan because of a no-points 
sales pitch. The lenders who heavily promote 
these types of loans rarely have the best mort-
gage terms.
Consider a no-point/no-fee mortgage if you 
can’t afford more out-of-pocket expenditures 
now or if you think that you’ll only keep the loan 
a few years. But if you’re that cash constrained, 
you may want to consider whether you can 
truly afford to buy investment property (see 
Chapter 1).

121
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Request a detailing of other fees and charges in writing from all lenders that 
you’re seriously considering. You need to know the total of all lender fees 
so that you can accurately compare different lenders’ loans and determine 
how much closing on your loan will cost you. For residential and commercial 
income properties, the lender usually asks for a deposit that the lender uses 
to cover the types of fees and charges outlined here.
 
To reduce the possibility of wasting your time and money applying for a mort-
gage that you may not qualify for, ask the lender for any reasons it may not 
approve you. Disclose any problems on your credit report or with the prop-
erty. Don’t expect the lender to provide you with a list of credit or property 
problems that may conceivably put the kibosh on a mortgage.
Making Some Mortgage Decisions
You can’t (or at least shouldn’t) spend months deciding which mortgage may 
be right for your situation. So, in this section, we help you zero in on which 
type is best for you.
Choosing between fixed and adjustable
Choosing between a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan is an important deci-
sion in the real estate investment process. Consider the advantages and dis-
advantages of each mortgage type and decide what’s best for your situation 
prior to going out to refinance or purchase real estate. This section covers 
the key factors to consider.
Your ability and desire to accept financial risk
How much risk can you handle in regard to the size of your property’s 
monthly mortgage payment? If you can take the financial risks that come 
with an ARM, you have a better chance of saving money and maximizing your 
property’s cash flow with an adjustable-rate rather than a fixed-rate loan. 
Your interest rate starts lower and stays lower with an ARM, if the overall 
level of interest rates stays unchanged. Even if rates go up, they’ll likely 
come back down over the life of your loan. If you can stick with your ARM for 
better and for worse, you should come out ahead in the long run.
ARMs make more sense if you borrow less than you’re qualified for. If your 
income (and applicable investment property cash flow) significantly exceeds 
your spending, you may feel less anxiety about the fluctuating interest rate 
on an ARM. If you do choose an adjustable loan, you may feel more financially 

122
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
secure if you have a hefty financial cushion (at least six months’ to as much as 
a year’s worth of expenses reserved) that you can access if rates go up.
Some people take ARMs when they can’t really afford them. When rates rise, 
property owners who can’t afford higher payments face a financial crisis. If 
you don’t have emergency savings that you can tap into to make the higher 
payments, how can you afford the monthly payments and the other expenses 
of your property?
 
If you can’t afford the highest-allowed payment on an ARM, don’t take one. 
You shouldn’t take the chance that the rate may not rise that high — it can, 
and you can lose the property.
Ask your lender to calculate the highest possible monthly payment that your 
loan allows. The number the lender comes up with is the payment that you 
face if the interest rate on your loan goes to the highest level allowed, or the 
lifetime cap. (For more on caps, see the “Future interest rate adjustments” 
section earlier in the chapter.)
 
Don’t take an adjustable mortgage because the lower initial interest rate 
allows you to afford the property that you want to buy (unless you’re abso-
lutely certain that your income and property cash flow will enable you to meet 
future payment increases). Try setting your sights on a property that you can 
afford to buy with a fixed-rate mortgage.
Length of time you expect to keep the mortgage
Saving interest on most ARMs is usually a certainty in the first two or three 
years. An adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than a fixed 
one. But, if rates rise, you can end up repaying the savings that you achieve 
in the early years of the mortgage.
If you aren’t going to keep your mortgage for more than five to seven years, 
you pay more interest to carry a fixed-rate mortgage. A mortgage lender takes 
extra risk in committing to a fixed-interest rate for 15 to 30 years. Lenders 
don’t know what may happen in the intervening years, so they charge you a 
premium in case interest rates move significantly higher in future years.
 
You may also consider a hybrid loan, which combines features of fixed- and 
adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may hold constant 
for three, five, seven, or ten years and then adjust once a year or every six 
months thereafter. Such loans may make sense for you if you foresee a high 
probability of keeping your loan seven to ten years or less but want some 
stability in your future monthly payments. The longer the initial rate stays 
locked in, the higher the interest rate. Don’t confuse these loans with the 
often-unadvisable balloon mortgage (which we discuss in the “Mortgages 
That Should Make You Think Twice” section later in the chapter).

123
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Selecting short-term or long-term
Most mortgage lenders offer you the option of 15-year or 30-year mortgages. 
You can also find 20-year and 40-year options, but these are unusual. So how 
do you decide whether a shorter- or longer-term mortgage is best for your 
investment property purchase?
To afford the monthly payments and have a positive cash flow, many invest-
ment property buyers need to spread their mortgage loan payments over a 
longer period of time, and a 30-year mortgage is the way to do it. A 15-year 
mortgage has higher monthly payments because you pay it off quicker. At a 
fixed-rate mortgage interest rate of 7 percent, for example, a 15-year mort-
gage comes with payments that are about 35 percent higher than those for a 
30-year mortgage.
 
Locking yourself into higher monthly payments with a 15-year mortgage may 
actually put you at greater financial risk. If your finances worsen or your prop-
erty declines in value, odds are you’ll have trouble qualifying for a refinance. 
You may be able to refinance your way out of the predicament, but you can’t 
count on it.
Don’t consider a 15-year mortgage unless you’re sure that you can afford 
the higher payments that come with it. Even if you can afford these higher 
payments, taking the 15-year option isn’t necessarily better. You may be 
able to find better uses for the money. If you can earn a higher rate of return 
investing your extra cash versus paying the interest on your mortgage, for 
instance, you may come out ahead investing your money rather than paying 
down your mortgage faster. Some real estate investors, including Robert, are 
attracted to 15-year mortgages to get their loans paid off by retirement age.
 
If you decide on a 30-year mortgage, you still maintain the flexibility to pay 
the mortgage off faster if you choose to. You can choose to make larger-than-
necessary payments and create your own 15-year mortgage. However, you can 
fall back to making only the payments required on your 30-year schedule when 
the need arises. The only situation in which you can’t pay off your 30-year mort-
gage faster is if the loan has a prepayment penalty (a penalty for paying off your 
loan before you’re supposed to), which we dislike. Normally, prepayment penal-
ties don’t apply if you pay off a loan because you sell the property, but when 
you refinance a loan with prepayment penalties, you have to pay the penalty.
Borrowing Against Home Equity
Home equity loans (or a derivative called a HELOC — home equity line of 
credit) enable you to borrow against the equity in your home. Because such 
loans are in addition to the mortgage that you already have (known as the 
first mortgage), home equity loans are also known as second mortgages.

124
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
A home equity loan may provide a relatively low-cost source of funds for an 
investment property purchase, especially if you’re seeking money for just 
a few years. You can refinance your first mortgage and pull cash out for an 
investment property purchase, but we don’t advise doing that if your first 
mortgage is at a lower interest rate than you can obtain on a refinance.
Home equity loans generally have higher interest rates than comparable first 
mortgages because they’re riskier to a lender. The reason: In the event that 
you default on the first mortgage or file for bankruptcy protection, the first 
mortgage lender gets first claim on your home.
Interest paid of up to $1 million on home mortgages for primary or second-
ary residences is tax deductible (on loans taken out after October 13, 1987). 
The tax deduction for home equity loans is limited to the interest paid on up 
to $100,000 of home equity debt. See Chapter 7 for a discussion of borrowing 
against home equity in the context of finding down payment money.
Getting a Seller-Financed Loan
Not every seller needs or even wants to receive all cash as payment for 
his property, so you may be able to finance part or even all of an investment 
property purchase thanks to the property seller’s financing. The use of seller 
financing is the cornerstone of most no-money-down strategies.
Seller financing is a transaction in which the seller accepts anything less than 
all cash at closing. One form of an all-cash transaction to the seller is the buyer 
literally paying all cash, but typically it’s a transaction in which the buyer uses 
a conventional loan (money to purchase the property from a lender other than 
the seller) so that the seller effectively receives all cash at closing.
Some sellers are financially well off enough that they don’t need all of the 
sales proceeds immediately for their next purchase or are buying a property 
for less money — or maybe not buying a replacement property at all — and 
prefer to receive payments over time. They may be looking for the payments 
to replace their income in retirement or they may prefer to receive the funds 
over time so they can reduce their taxable income.
 
Any seller with equity can offer seller financing, but usually private individuals 
are the best sources. The best candidates for seller financing are sellers with 
significant equity or, best of all, folks who own their property free-and-clear 
(without any debt on the property at all). Many seniors have owned their 
properties for years and may be more willing to extend a loan.

125
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Sometimes sellers offer this option, but in other cases, you need to pop 
the question. We can think of two good reasons to ask for the seller to help 
finance an investment property purchase:
 
✓ Better terms: Mortgage lenders, which are typically banks or large 
monolithic financial institutions, aren’t the most flexible businesses in 
the world. You may well be able to obtain a lower interest rate, lower 
or waived fees, and more flexible repayment conditions from a prop-
erty seller. There are also many expenses with conventional loans that 
a property seller may not require: loan points, origination fees, and an 
appraisal. Some sellers may not even require a loan application or credit 
report, but they’d be wise to go through due diligence (including a per-
sonal financial statement) on the buyer.
 
✓ Loan approval: Perhaps you’ve had prior financial problems that have 
caused mortgage lenders to routinely deny your mortgage application. 
Some property sellers may be more flexible, especially in a slow real 
estate market or with a property that’s challenging to sell. A seller can 
also make a decision in a few days, whereas a conventional lender often 
takes weeks.
Be careful when considering a property where a seller is offering financing as 
part of the deal; this act may be a sign of a hard-to-sell property. Investigate 
how long the property has been on the market and what specific flaws and 
problems it may have.
 
Some of the reasons why sellers may offer their own financing are listed below:
 
✓ They’re attracted to the potential returns of being a mortgage lender. 
This reason shouldn’t concern the buyer as long as the terms of the 
seller financing are reasonable and avoid the issues raised earlier in the 
chapter about balloon payment or interest-only loans.
 
✓ The seller has significant equity. This situation creates another win-win 
opportunity for both the buyer and seller to use seller financing.
 
✓ The current financing has prepayment issues. This road can be a prob-
lem for the buyer; if the underlying financing has a due-on-sale clause 
and the lender becomes aware of the sale, it can demand the full pay-
ment of the outstanding loan balance on short notice.
 
✓ They’re seeking a price that exceeds the normal conventional loan 
parameters, or the property doesn’t qualify for a conventional loan for 
some reason. Examples of qualification issues include a cracked slab, 
environmental issues, improvements done without permits, and so on. 
This scenario is risky for the buyer and may be an indication that they’re 
over-reaching or pursuing a property that’s not a good investment.

126
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
Be sure that your seller financing agreement is nonrecourse (as discussed 
later in the chapter) and doesn’t contain a due-on-sale clause prohibiting you 
from selling the property without paying off the loan in full. If the seller 
requires a due-on-sale clause, you have to pay off the full balance owed to the 
seller when you sell the property. Most sellers wisely ask for the due-on-sale 
clause so that the property can’t be sold to another owner.
Mortgages That Should Make 
You Think Twice
You may come across other loans such as balloon loans and interest-only 
mortgages. We also want you to know the potential risks associated with 
recourse loans. The following section presents our thoughts on these options.
Balloon loans
One type of loan that is sometimes confused with a hybrid loan is a balloon 
loan. Balloon loans start off just like traditional fixed-rate mortgages. You 
make level payments based on a long-term payment schedule, over 15 or 30 
years, for example. But at a predetermined time, usually three to ten years 
after the loan’s inception, the remaining loan balance becomes fully due.
Balloon loans may save you money because they have a lower interest rate 
than a longer-term fixed-rate mortgage. Sometimes, balloon loans may be 
the only option for the buyer (or so the buyer thinks). Buyers are more com-
monly backed into these loans during periods of high interest rates. When a 
buyer can’t afford the payments on a conventional mortgage and really wants 
a particular property, a seller may offer a balloon loan.
 
Balloon loans are dangerous for the simple reason that your financial situa-
tion can change, and you may not be able to refinance when your balloon 
loan is due. What if you lose your job or your income drops? What if the value 
of your property drops and the appraisal comes in too low to qualify you for 
a new loan? What if interest rates rise and you can’t qualify at the higher rate 
on a new loan? We recommend balloon loans only when the following condi-
tions apply:
 
✓ Such a loan is your sole financing option.
 
✓ You’ve really done your homework to exhaust other financing options.
 
✓ You’re certain that you can refinance when the balloon comes due.
If you take a balloon loan, get one with as much time as possible, preferably 
seven to ten years, before it becomes due.

127
 Chapter 8: Financing Your Property Purchases
Interest-only loans
In the early years of such mortgages, your monthly mortgage payment is 
used only to pay interest that is owed. Although this helps to keep your pay-
ments relatively low (because no money is going toward repaying principal), 
the downside is that you’re not making any headway to pay down your loan 
balance.
Usually, after a preset time period, such as five or seven years, your mort-
gage payment jumps substantially so that you can begin to pay down or 
amortize your loan balance. Our experience and observation has been that 
many people don’t really understand or investigate how this increased pay-
ment affects them, which is why we’ve long advised against taking these 
types of loans.
The main attraction that we see for interest-only mortgages for investment 
property purchases is that the low initial payments help you achieve more 
positive cash flow early on. Our concern, however, is seeing some property 
buyers attracted to interest-only loans to afford purchasing high-cost prop-
erty that is difficult to realize positive cash flow from.
 
If the only way for you to invest in an income property is to use an interest-
only loan, perhaps you shouldn’t invest. Investing in rental real estate is risky, 
and you can lose your entire investment if the market turns and you don’t 
have the staying power to ride through the real estate cycles.
If you consider an interest-only mortgage, be sure that you understand 
upfront exactly how high your payment will be after the loan moves out of 
the interest-only payment phase. And be sure that you’ve surveyed the mort-
gage marketplace and understand how the terms and conditions of interest-
only loans stack up versus other types of mortgages.
Recourse financing
The goal of most real estate investors is to accumulate wealth over time 
while not taking any unreasonable risks. That’s why we discourage using 
interest-only loans or loans with balloon payments. But there is another 
factor to explore before agreeing to any loan: Is the loan nonrecourse or 
recourse?
 
✓ Nonrecourse financing: In the event you fail to fulfill the terms of your 
loan, this type of loan limits the lender to only foreclosing on the under-
lying property. Foreclosure is the full and complete satisfaction of the 
loan, and the lender can’t seek a deficiency judgment or go after your 
other assets.

128
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
 
✓ Recourse loans: These loans lower the lender’s risk because they offer 
additional protection. The lender has the legal right to seek a deficiency 
judgment against you personally or pursue other assets to cover any 
shortfall should the property value not fully cover the lender’s outstand-
ing debt balance. Remember that after a loan is in default, the interest 
penalties and legal fees can add up quickly. If you’re already in default 
on the loan for your rental property, the last challenge you need is to 
have a lender looking to take your home or other viable rental proper-
ties to satisfy their deficiency judgment.
As long as you’re not too aggressive and don’t overleverage your rental 
properties, real estate investing can be relatively safe, and the chances are 
you won’t be faced with losing your property by defaulting on your loan. But 
there are limits to your ability to control all of the diverse factors that can 
affect your property. For example, your cash flow will definitely suffer if the 
major employer in your area suddenly leaves.
Nonrecourse financing has more stringent qualification standards, such as 
higher debt coverage ratios (see Chapter 6), and generally results in a lower 
loan amount. But just as with borrowers who utilize interest-only loans so 
that they can borrow as much money as possible, the closer you live to the 
edge, the more likely you’ll regret it.
Many of the loans you consider will be nonrecourse, but if you’re seeking 
financing for an unstabilized property (a property whose cash flow is uncer-
tain due to vacancy or unusually high expenses) or a property requiring 
major renovation, you may find that lenders are willing to provide the funds 
you need only with a full recourse loan.
 
Typically you’re evaluating different loan proposals with either full recourse 
or full nonrecourse financing. But lenders can also offer a partial recourse 
loan. A partial recourse loan allows the lender to seek a deficiency judgment up 
to a certain limit if you default. Again, there may be great real estate invest-
ment options where such a loan makes sense, but be very careful before 
agreeing to such terms, and include the consequences to your overall financial 
status in a worst-case scenario in your overall analysis.
 
No matter what type of loan you use, we strongly recommend that you only 
use nonrecourse financing. You’ll sleep better at night!

I
n Chapter 8, we discuss how to choose among the many loan options 
available to select the one that best suits your personal and financial situ-
ation. In the process of delving into the different types of real estate invest-
ment financing, you may have already begun the process of speaking with 
different lenders and surfing Web sites.
In this chapter, we provide our top tips and advice for shopping for and ulti-
mately securing the best financing that you can for your real estate invest-
ment purchases and refinances. We also cover common loan problems that 
may derail your plans.
Shopping for Mortgages
Financing costs of your real estate investment purchases are generally the 
single biggest expense by far, so it pays to shop around and know how to 
unearth the best deals. You may find that many, many lenders would love to 
have your business, especially if you have a strong credit rating. Although 
having numerous lenders competing for your business can save you money, 
it can also make mortgage shopping and selection difficult. This section 
should help you simplify matters.

130
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Relying on referrals
Many sources of real estate advice simply tell you to get referrals in your quest 
to find the best mortgage lenders. Sounds simple and straightforward — but 
it’s not. For instance, loans for commercial investment properties and residen-
tial rental properties with five or more units have different lender underwriting 
requirements and terms compared with residential one- to four-unit loans (see 
Chapter 2 for explanations of these types of investments).
 
Good referrals can be a useful tool for locating the best lenders. Here are a few 
sources we recommend:
 
✓ Start with a bank or credit union that you have a relationship with cur-
rently and then seek referrals from it if it’s not interested in making the 
specific loan you have in mind.
 
✓ Collect referrals from people who you know and trust and who have 
demonstrated some ability to select good service providers. Start with 
the best professional service providers (tax advisors, lawyers, financial 
planners, real estate agents, and so on) you know and respect, and ask 
them for their recommendations.
 
✓ Contact associations of real estate investors, especially those in your 
state. (You can find a comprehensive list organized by state at the Web 
site www.realestateassociations.com.) Networking with local 
investors is a great way to learn about the local real estate market and 
to benefit from other people’s experiences.
 
Don’t take anyone’s referrals as gospel. Always be wary of business people 
who refer you to folks who have referred business to them over the years. 
Whenever you get a recommendation, ask the person doing the referring why 
they’re making the referral and what they like and don’t like about the service 
provider.
Mulling over mortgage brokers
 
You don’t need to use a mortgage broker unless you’re trying to get a loan for 
a property that has some challenges or you as the buyer have less than stellar 
credit or want to put the minimum down. Thus, we recommend going directly 
to lenders for simple deals (a relatively small price tag, a property that’s in 
good condition and enjoys a good location, and so on) and using mortgage 
brokers for bigger, more complicated, or more difficult deals.
But many property buyers get a headache trying to shop among the enor-
mous universe of mortgages and lenders. Check out the following sections 
when deciding on whether you want to use a broker.

131
 Chapter 9: Securing the Best Mortgage Terms
Counting a broker’s contributions
A good mortgage broker can make the following contributions to your real 
estate investing team:
 
✓ Advice: If you’re like most people, you may have a difficult time decid-
ing which type of mortgage is best for your situation. A good mortgage 
broker can take the time to listen to your financial and personal situa-
tion and goals and offer suggestions for specific loans that match your 
situation. Brokers do work on commission, which unfortunately can 
temper the objectivity of their advice, so tread carefully. Don’t blindly 
accept a mortgage broker’s advice, which may be nothing more than a 
commission-driven sales pitch masquerading as counsel.
 
✓ Shopping: Even after you figure out the specific type of mortgage that 
you want, dozens (if not hundreds) of lenders may offer that type of 
loan. (You’ll find fewer lender options for five-plus-unit residential prop-
erties and commercial properties.)
 
 Thoroughly shopping among the options to find the best mortgage 
takes time and knowledge you may well lack. A good mortgage broker 
can probably save you time and money by shopping for your best deal. 
Brokers can be especially helpful if you have a less than pristine credit 
report or you want to buy property with a low down payment — like 10 
percent of the value of a property. Purchasing a multifamily residential 
property with five or more units or a commercial, industrial, or retail 
property is difficult with less than a 20- to 30-percent down payment.)
 
 Be careful, when selecting a broker, because the worst among them get 
in the habit of repeatedly using the same lenders — perhaps because of 
the lofty commissions those lenders pay out. (More on understanding 
mortgage broker’s commissions in the “Keeping up with commissions 
and other contingencies” section.)
 
✓ Paperwork and presentation: An organized and detail-oriented mort-
gage broker can assist you with completing the morass of forms most 
lenders demand. Mortgage brokers can assist you with preparing your 
loan package so that you put your best foot forward with lenders.
 
 Have your personal financial statement prepared in advance so that it 
can be easily updated. Each time you seek a loan for an investment 
property, you have to provide a current financial statement to the 
broker (and, actually, all potential loan sources).
 
✓ Closing the deal: After you sign a purchase agreement to buy a real 
estate investment property, you still have a lot to do before you’re the 
proud new property owner (see Chapter 14 for all the details). A compe-
tent mortgage broker makes sure that you meet the important deadlines 
for closing the deal.

132
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Keeping up with commissions and other contingencies
A mortgage broker typically gets paid a percentage, usually between 0.5 to 1 
percent, of the loan amount. This commission is completely negotiable, espe-
cially on larger loans that are more lucrative. (In case you’re interested, the 
commission on larger deals — say, on a loan of $25 million or more — is 0.25 
to 0.5 percent.)
 
Be sure to ask what the commission is on every alternative loan that a broker 
pitches. Some brokers may be indignant that you ask — that’s their problem. 
You have every right to ask; after all, it’s your money.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what bro-
kers say they can get for you. Again, be careful. Some brokers tell you what 
you want to hear — that is, that they can beat your best find — and then 
aren’t able to deliver when the time comes. Some mortgage brokers promise 
fantastic terms to get you in the door; then, when you’re just about ready to 
close on your loan, they come up with a last minute problem with your credit 
report, appraisal or some other issue that prevents them from delivering on 
the loan as quoted. This bait-and-switch tactic often works because most 
borrowers have some blemish or negative on their loan application or credit 
report. So make sure you find a mortgage broker who doesn’t overpromise 
and underdeliver.
If your loan broker quotes you a really good deal, make sure you ask who the 
lender is. Most brokers refuse to reveal this information until you pay the 
necessary fee to cover the appraisal, credit report, and required environmen-
tal reports. But after taking care of those fees, you can check with the lender 
to verify the interest rate, the points, the amortization term, and the prepay-
ment penalties (if any) that the broker quotes you, and make sure that you’re 
eligible for the loan.
Web surfing for mortgages
You can shop for just about anything and everything online, so why should 
mortgages be any different? Mortgage Web sites often claim that they save 
you lots of time and money.
 
In our experience, the Internet is better used for mortgage research than for 
securing a specific mortgage. That’s not to say that some sites can’t provide 
competitive loans in a timely fashion. However, we’ve seen some property 
purchases fall apart because the buyers relied upon a Web site that failed to 
deliver a loan in time.

133
 Chapter 9: Securing the Best Mortgage Terms
Here’s a short list of some of our favorite mortgage related Web sites that 
you may find helpful:
 
✓ HSH Associates: The folks at HSH Associates (www.hsh.com) publish 
mortgage information for most metropolitan areas. For $20, you can 
receive a list of dozens of lenders’ rate quotes, but you need to be a real 
data junkie to wade through all the numbers on the multipage report 
that features lots of abbreviations in small print.
 
✓ Government-related sites: The Web sites of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (www.hud.gov) and the Veterans 
Administration (www.va.gov) provide information on government loan 
programs and feature foreclosed homes for sale.
 
 Fannie Mae, which stands for the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (www.fanniemae.com), and Freddie Mac, which is the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (www.freddiemac.com), 
have worked over the years with the federal government to support 
the mortgage marketplace.
 
✓ Mortgage Bankers Association: The trade association for mortgage 
lenders, the Mortgage Bankers Association (www.mbaa.org), has arti-
cles and data on the mortgage marketplace. Its Web resources page also 
includes links to state and local mortgage banker associations.
 
 This group is an excellent source of information on loans for residential 
properties with five or more units and commercial, industrial, and retail 
properties.
 
✓ E-LOAN: One of the first major online lenders, E-LOAN has stood the 
test of time and continues to offer competitive loans (www.eloan.com). 
This well-organized site can give you a quick overview of competitive 
mortgage pricing. Of course, you’re under no obligation to use one of its 
mortgages just because you survey the options available.
 
✓ Journalistic sites: Numerous Web sites feature news and information 
about the real estate markets around the country. Several journalistic 
sites worth perusing include www.realtytimes.com, www.deadline
news.com, www.inman.com, and www.erictyson.com.
 
✓ Legal research sites: Legal issues certainly raise their ugly heads on 
many a real estate deal. The Web site of self-help legal publisher Nolo 
Press (www.nolo.com) offers some free resources as well as details on 
all of the company’s legal books.
 
 Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute (www.law.cornell.
edu/topics/mortgages.html) includes legal information on mort-
gages, including hard-to-find links to federal- and state-specific statutes.

Solving Potential Loan Predicaments
In Chapter 8, we discuss the different types of mortgages and how to select 
the one that best fits your situation. But remember that just because you 
want a particular mortgage doesn’t mean that you’re going to get approved 
for it.
 
The best defense against loan rejection is avoiding it in the first place. To head 
off potential rejection, disclose anything that may cause a problem before you 
apply for the loan. For example, if you already know that your credit report 
indicates some late payments from when you were out of the country for an 
extended period or your family was in turmoil over a medical problem, write a 
letter to your lender that explains this situation. Or perhaps you’re self-
employed and your income from two years ago on your tax return was artifi-
cially much lower due to a special tax write-off. If that’s the case, explain that 
in writing to the lender.
Lenders who understand investment property
Al, an investor Robert knows, had an interest-
ing experience when a lender initially indicated 
that he had insufficient income to support the 
purchase of four brand-new rental condos 
he was buying. (This situation is also a real-
world example of a potential quick buy-and-flip 
scenario — the properties in question appreci-
ated about 12 percent from a purchase agree-
ment in six months.)
The lender had trouble understanding a basic 
concept of real estate ownership — it offers the 
benefits of depreciation to shelter other income 
for real estate professionals. So much of Al’s 
income was sheltered through real estate hold-
ings that his tax returns showed only about 20 
percent of his actual income, which wasn’t 
sufficient to qualify for the loan. Al had to actu-
ally educate the loan underwriters by showing 
them the various real-estate limited-liability 
corporation tax returns with the significant 
amounts of depreciation and how they flowed 
through to his personal tax return.
Real estate investors need to be aware that 
when they’re looking to purchase additional 
real estate, they need to work with a lender 
that understands that depreciation is a noncash 
item that allows real estate investors to actually 
keep more of their income. Al asked the mort-
gage broker who was a better risk — someone 
who makes $100,000 and has no tax benefits 
from depreciation and thus pays 40 percent in 
taxes with a net income of $60,000, or someone 
who makes several hundred thousand dollars 
but only reports $50,000 and thus pays taxes at 
a lower rate. Remember the old adage, “It’s not 
what you make but what you keep that really 
counts.”

135
 Chapter 9: Securing the Best Mortgage Terms
Even if you’re the ideal mortgage borrower in the eyes of every lender, you 
may encounter financing problems with some properties. And of course, not 
all real estate buyers have a perfect credit history, lots of spare cash, and no 
debt. If you’re one of those borrowers who must jump through more hoops 
than others to get a loan, don’t give up hope. Few borrowers are perfect from 
a lender’s perspective, and many problems aren’t that difficult to fix.
Polishing your credit report
Late payments, missed payments, or debts that you never bothered to pay 
can tarnish your credit report and squelch a lender’s desire to offer you a 
mortgage loan. If you’ve been turned down for a loan because of your less-
than-stellar credit history, request a free copy of your credit report from the 
lender that turned you down.
 
Getting a report before you even apply for a loan is advisable and no longer 
costs you any money. Once a year, you’re entitled to obtain a free copy of 
your credit report from each of the three credit bureaus. The contact informa-
tion for the credit bureaus is
 
✓ Equifax: 800-685-1111; www.equifax.com
 
✓ Experian: 888-397-3742; www.experian.com
 
✓ Transunion: 800-916-8800; www.transunion.com
If problems are accurately documented on your credit report, try to explain 
them to your lender. Getting the bum’s rush? Call other lenders and tell them 
your credit problems up front and see whether you can find one willing to 
offer you a loan. Mortgage brokers may also be able to help you shop for 
lenders in these cases.
 
Sometimes you may feel that you’re not in control when you apply for a loan. 
In reality, you can fix a number of credit problems yourself. And you can often 
explain those that you can’t fix. Some lenders are more lenient and flexible 
than others. Just because one mortgage lender rejects your loan application 
doesn’t mean that all the others will.
As for erroneous information listed on your credit report, get on the phone 
to the credit bureaus. If specific creditors are the culprits, call them too. 
They’re required to submit any new information or correct any errors at 
once. Keep notes from your conversations and make sure that you put your 
case in writing and add your comments to your credit report. If the customer 
service representatives you talk with are no help, send a letter to the presi-
dent of each company. Getting mistakes cleaned up on your credit report can 
take the tenacity of a bulldog — be persistent.

136
Part II: How to Get the Money: Raising Capital and Financing 
Another common credit problem is having too much consumer debt at the 
time you apply for a mortgage. The more credit card, auto loan, and other 
consumer debt you rack up, the less mortgage you qualify for. If you’re 
turned down for the mortgage, consider it a wake-up call to get rid of this 
high-cost debt. Hang on to the dream of buying real estate and plug away at 
paying off your debts before you make another foray into real estate. (See 
Chapter 8 for more information.)
Conquering insufficient income
If you’re self-employed or have changed jobs, your income may not resemble 
your past income, or more importantly, your income may not be what a mort-
gage lender likes to see in respect to the amount that you want to borrow. A 
simple (although not always feasible) way around this problem is to make a 
larger down payment.
If you can’t make a large down payment, another option is to get a cosigner 
for the loan — your relatives may be willing. As long as they aren’t overex-
tended themselves, they may be able to help you qualify for a larger loan 
than you can get on your own. As with partnerships, make sure that you put 
your agreement in writing so that no misunderstandings occur.
Dealing with low property appraisals
Even if you have sufficient income, a clean credit report, and an adequate 
down payment, the lender may turn down your loan if the appraisal of the 
property that you want to buy comes in too low. This is a relatively rare situ-
ation that happens more in rapidly appreciating markets; it’s unusual for a 
property not to appraise for what a buyer agrees to pay.
 
With the decline in real estate values in the late-2000s, many sellers are still 
unrealistic about the value of their property and need a reality check. 
Assuming that you still like the property, use the low appraisal to renegotiate 
a lower price from the seller.
 
You may be the owner of a property in need of refinancing because the loan is 
coming due or the terms are unfavorable and the appraisal is too low. In this 
case you obviously need to follow a different path. If you have the cash avail-
able, you can simply put more money down to get the loan balance to a level 
for which you qualify. If you don’t have the cash, you may need to forgo the 
refinance until you save more money or until the property value rises.

A
s the most well-known saying in real estate goes, “The three most 
important factors to success in real estate are location, location, and 
location!” There is a strong correlation between the location of your real 
estate investments and your financial success. And we firmly agree that the 
location of your real estate investment is critical in determining your success 
as a real estate investor. But we prefer the phrase coined by Eric: “Location, 
location, value.” This revised adage clearly emphasizes location but also 
stresses the importance of finding good value for your investment dollar.
Merely owning real estate isn’t the key to success in real estate investing; 
acquiring and owning the right real estate at the right price is how to build 
wealth! As you gain experience in real estate, you’ll develop your own strat-
egy, but to make any strategy succeed, you need to do your homework and 
diligently and fairly evaluate both the positive and negative aspects of your 
proposed real estate investment. That’s where we come in.
In this chapter, we cover important aspects of regional and local demograph-
ics, how to analyze the economy, and which factors are most important 
to real estate investing. We also discuss barriers to entry and the supply/
demand equation. Then we show you where to find this information and how 
to interpret the numbers to determine your local areas with the most poten-
tial. Finally, we discuss real estate cycles and timing.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Deciding Where to Invest
If you’re going to invest in real estate, you need to decide on a location. Most 
real estate investors initially — and wisely — look in their local communities.
 
We give you the tools to evaluate properties anywhere, but you have an 
inherent advantage if you begin your search close to home. Unless you really 
know another real estate market and regularly find yourself there for other 
reasons anyway, we recommend that you stay close to home with your real 
estate investments — no more than one to two hours by your favorite mode 
of transportation.
 
Robert has had success with a real estate investment strategy that limits his 
potential markets to cities where he had personal management experience 
when he worked for a large national real estate firm. He also limits himself to 
areas that are no farther than a one-hour, nonstop flight on Southwest 
Airlines.
Although we strongly advise that you cut your teeth on an income property 
or two in your local market, establish parameters that meet your specific 
needs. For example, maybe you have family responsibilities that limit the 
amount of time you can devote to overseeing and managing your real estate 
investments. The one-hour-flight rule that Robert uses would likely be too 
taxing in that situation, and could be replaced by something like a 30-minute-
drive rule.
Although virtually everyone lives in an area with opportunities for real estate 
investing, not everyone lives in an area where the prospects are good for 
real estate in general. That’s why it’s important to broaden your geographic 
investment horizon as long as you don’t compromise your ability to effec-
tively manage and control your property.
Even if you decide to invest in real estate in your own locale, you still need 
to do tons of research to decide where and what to buy — extremely impor-
tant decisions with long-term consequences. In the pages that follow, we 
explain what to look for in a region, a community, and even a neighborhood 
before you make that investment decision. Keep in mind, though, that you 
can spend the rest of your life looking for the perfect real estate investment, 
never find it, never invest, and miss out on lots of opportunities, profit, and 
even fun.

141
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
The dangers of investing out of your area
In many regions of the country, real estate 
prices escalated in the early- to mid-2000s to 
the point that it was difficult for entry-level real 
estate investors to buy. If you lived in such an 
area, it was tempting to go far afield in search 
of reasonably priced property. Recently, the 
decline in prices in some areas is equally entic-
ing, but you need to exercise caution.
Regardless of whether prices are up or down, 
there always seem to be a proliferation of 
seminars that promise real estate investment 
opportunities in other areas of the country. In 
California and other areas (where even with 
the recent price adjustments many proper-
ties are still relatively high-priced), seminar 
sponsors target owners and wannabe real 
estate investors, touting the great investments 
that can be found in other, often unnamed, 
parts of the country. They claim that you can 
buy rental real estate for a fraction of your 
local prices and achieve high returns on your 
investment. They even provide pictures of these 
properties — but there are always tiny little 
disclaimers somewhere on the page!
We strongly advise against investing blindly 
in areas that you don’t know personally. And 
never consider these investments unless you 
have the proper local contacts such as a great 
property manager, contractors and suppliers, 
and competent legal and accounting advice. In 
the greater Las Vegas area alone, an estimated 
40,000 non-owner occupied rental homes are 
primarily owned by out-of-state real estate 
speculators that bought new homes as invest-
ments to flip but got stuck with them when the 
market turned.
Robert routinely serves as an expert witness 
and recently had a case where an out-of-state 
owner saw a great investment opportunity for 
an upscale four-bedroom executive home. Even 
though he worked over 3,000 miles away, what 
could go wrong with such a beautiful rental in a 
dynamic and prosperous suburb of San Diego? 
It looked like a good investment in a great 
neighborhood, and the property manager found 
a respectable renter in just a few days.
Unfortunately, what seemed so good sud-
denly turned south when the initial check for 
the security deposit and first month’s rent was 
returned, marked “account closed.” Later that 
week, the owner got a long-distance call from 
a disgruntled neighbor complaining about the 
barking dog and that many more people were 
occupying the home than just one family. Six 
months later, after paying hefty legal bills for 
the eviction plus making several cross-country 
airline flights, the owner finally regained pos-
session of his now-trashed executive home. 
Aside from the lost rent for six months, the 
damage to the home was in excess of $50,000. 
In the subsequent lawsuit against the broker, 
it came out that the broker had recommended 
an unlicensed property manager who never did 
any screening of the tenant.
One experience like this, and you may stick to 
money market accounts. So when you read 
about great real estate opportunities in faraway 
places, remember that it’s better to be safe than 
sorry. Our experience indicates that if it sounds 
too good to be true, it is too good to be true! Risk 
and return are truly related. It’s better to have 
a more solid and easy-to-manage property in 
your own community than to try and hit a home 
run in a different time zone.

142
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Understanding the Goal: Finding 
Properties Where You Can Add Value
So you’re looking for properties that allow you to lower the cap rate, which 
is essentially lowering the required rate of return. You want to buy when 
you determine that the property has a strong likelihood of producing future 
increases in NOI and cash flow. So you should look for properties where your 
analysis shows that the income for the property can be increased or the 
expenses reduced.
However, certain clues indicate whether a property really has rents that are 
below market. Properties with no vacancies and a waiting list are prime can-
didates. Other telltale signs are properties that have low turnover and then 
have multiple applicants for those rare vacancies. Economics 101 says that if 
demand exceeds supply, the price is too low.
Some owners actually market their real estate investment properties at a 
below-market price. These are motivated sellers, probably with a variety of 
personal reasons for their need to sell more quickly and cheaply than they 
would if they had more time and patience. Health reasons, family dissolu-
tions, financial issues, and so on are all likely reasons that a seller will agree 
to a quick sale at a below-market price.
However, some sellers don’t achieve the top value in the market for other 
reasons. For example, some owners despise the whole process of selling their 
rental properties so much that they knowingly underprice the property to 
ensure a quick and clean transaction and retain the ability to reject any and 
all contingencies that a buyer would typically require in a market deal. The 
elimination of hassling and haggling is paramount to these sellers; they just 
want to get the sale done, so they’re willing to give the buyer such a good 
deal that the buyer takes the property essentially as is.
Some sellers are truly ignorant of the actual market value of the property 
they’re selling. There really is no excuse (save laziness) for a seller in a 
major metropolitan area to not know the true value of the property he owns, 
because there are many real estate professionals who can inexpensively 
assist sellers in determining the estimated value of their property. Simply 
ask a real estate broker for a comparative market analysis (CMA) or hire an 
appraiser, and you’ll get a detailed report determining the current as-is value 
of the investment property.
 
The most common question Robert hears from real estate investors is “How 
do I find these underpriced properties?” Our experience indicates that under-
priced investment properties typically have older owners with no mortgage 
who have exhausted the possibility of taking depreciation deductions on their 
tax returns.

143
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Look for properties where you can increase value. These value-added prop-
erties are properties that allow you to either increase the NOI or decrease 
the rate and thus create value. As we point out in the “Income capitalization 
approach” section earlier in this chapter the value of a property is increased 
with an increase in NOI or a decrease in the capitalization rate. The capital-
ization rate is directly correlated to the anticipated risk of the investment, so 
stabilizing properties through long-term leases and more financially viable 
tenants can reduce risk and lead to a lower cap rate.
A simple example of how to increase the value of a building is to find a residen-
tial rental property in a high demand area where all rental rates are the same 
for similar floor plans. In reality, the rents should reflect the fact that, say, not 
all two-bedroom units have the same location benefits. For example, a unit 
overlooking the pool is often more desirable than a unit on the main street, so 
raising the rents for the more desirable units increases rental income.
Evaluating a Region: The Big Picture
 
Though we advise you to think local, any decision about where to invest 
should start with an evaluation of the overall economic viability and trends of 
the surrounding region. If the region isn’t economically sound, the likelihood 
for successful real estate investments within that area is diminished. 
Understand how to evaluate important economic data so that you can invest 
in the areas that are poised for growth.
We define a region as a concentrated population base (rather than an entire 
state or section of the country). Data for any larger geographic area would 
be difficult to use for the types of real estate investments you’ll be making. 
For example, data for the state of Texas isn’t as important as vital economic 
trends for your proposed investment in the Houston area.
Gathering and analyzing the relevant economic data has never been easier, 
thanks to the Internet. The most important data for population growth, job 
growth, and economic trends is available online, and there are numerous 
entities tracking this information. From the federal government, to state 
and local governments, to universities and business groups, information on 
regional economic trends is readily available.
 
In addition to the academic and governmental agencies that provide broader 
economic indicators, several private firms specialize in providing specific data 
on occupancy, availability, and rental rates for different types of real estate for 
many of the major cities throughout the country. These services offer limited 
information to non-subscribers. For example, two of our favorites with a 
national perspective are the CoStar Group (www.costar.com) and Real 
Estate Research Corporation (www.rerc.com). There are many smaller firms 
that specialize in specific geographic areas, like MarketPointe Realty Advisors, 

144
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
which focuses on Southern California (www.marketpointe.com). Check with 
real estate investment professionals that hold the Certified Commercial 
Investment Member (CCIM) designation in your area, because they have 
access to the excellent CCIM Institute’s Site to Do Business (STDB).
 
You can find the vital economic data you need for your evaluation through 
your local economic development department, chamber of commerce, or 
public library. Real estate lenders often have in-house economists that collect 
information concerning areas where they lend money, and these folks are 
often the first to detect weaknesses in the market. So if your lender isn’t par-
ticularly enamored about the location for your proposed real estate invest-
ment, it probably knows something that you should heed. Also, contact a 
professional appraiser in your area, because they routinely collect this infor-
mation for their appraisals.
These sources collect, record, analyze, and report information accord-
ing to specific geographic boundaries as established by the federal gov-
ernment. The U.S. government divides urbanized areas of the country 
into Standardized Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA). SMSA’s are large 
areas that consist of one or more major cities. For example, the entire San 
Francisco Bay Area, the combined areas of Dallas and Fort Worth, Greater 
Los Angeles, and Greater New York City are each a single SMSA.
If your proposed investment isn’t in an area tracked as part of an SMSA, much 
of the same information is available, but you have to do a little more digging.
 
You’re looking for more than just numbers. Attitude and leadership are impor-
tant as well. Many neighboring cities are working together with regional plan-
ning boards and economic development agencies. Their goal is job creation, 
and they possess great powers to make important economic decisions regard-
ing regional airports, mass transportation, and the reuse of surplus military 
installations. Clearly, such regional governance can have a major impact for 
better or worse on your real estate investments.
You’re looking for a region or area that is growing and has a diverse eco-
nomic base with strong employment prospects. In the following sections, 
we cover some of the more significant factors that can impact real estate 
demand and values.
Population growth
 
Population growth is one of the cornerstones upon which demand for real 
estate is based. An area with a steady growth in population soon needs more 
residential and commercial rental properties. More people mean more 
demand for housing, retail shopping, and offices and service providers. In 
other words, people use real estate, so the demand for real estate is enhanced 
as the population increases.

145
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Increases or decreases in population are the result of three activities: births, 
mortality, and people moving into or out of the area. In most areas, births 
exceed deaths, and thus most areas experience moderate growth. So the real 
impact comes from a dynamic and mobile society. We’ve seen tremendous 
shifts in population from northern states to the more temperate climates of 
the Sunbelt. Immigration has also been a major factor in many parts of the 
country.
 
How does population growth affect your real estate decisions? Simply put, 
economists find that a new household is needed for every increase in popula-
tion of three persons. Of course, these numbers can vary based on average 
household size. So if you’re considering investments in rental homes or small 
apartment buildings in a certain area, the overall net population growth can 
be a factor in determining current and future demand for rental housing.
But knowing the increase in population for the entire SMSA or region isn’t 
enough because population growth isn’t evenly spread and can vary. As you 
get down to the next level in your research (see the “Investigating Your Local 
Real Estate Market” section later in the chapter), you need to determine 
the communities and even neighborhoods where the increased population 
will want to live, work, and shop. Real estate developers, and their lenders, 
look closely at net population growth in specific submarkets to forecast the 
demand for their proposed developments.
Job growth and income levels
Job growth is another fundamental element in determining demand for real 
estate. Economists generally predict that a new household is needed for 
every 1.5 jobs created. So if a new employer moves into the area and brings 
150 new jobs, the local real estate housing market will need approximately 
100 new dwelling units. Of course, these new jobs also positively impact the 
demand for commercial, industrial, and retail properties.
 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles job growth and other economic 
data by SMSA as well as by county. This info is available at the Bureau’s Web 
site (www.bls.gov). Other great sources for economic data are local colleges 
and universities and good local libraries.
But you need more information about the types of jobs before you can esti-
mate their effect on the demand for each type of real estate. Although job 
growth is critical, so are the following factors:
 
✓ Income levels: Without stable, well-paying jobs, an area can stagnate. 
Even with positive growth in population and jobs, a lack of income can 
stifle the demand for additional residential and commercial properties.

146
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Level of employment diversification: If the local economy is heavily 
reliant on jobs in a small number of industries, that dependence 
increases the risk of your real estate investments. Some areas of the 
country have plenty of jobs, but they’re lower- rather than higher-paying 
jobs. Ideally, look to invest in real estate in communities that maintain 
diverse job bases.
 
✓ Industries represented: Consider which industries are more heavily 
represented in the local economy. If most of the jobs come from slow-
growing or shrinking employment sectors, such as farming, small retail, 
shoe and apparel manufacturing, and government, real estate prices are 
unlikely to rise quickly in the years ahead. On the other hand, areas with 
a greater preponderance of high-growth industries, such as technology, 
generally stand a greater chance of faster price appreciation.
 
✓ Types of jobs: The specific types of jobs available can be important 
depending on the target market for your income property. If you’re 
buying a class A office building in an urban area, look for statistics on 
current and future employment levels for professional employment. 
For example, owning an office building across the street from the new 
regional courthouse gives you a real advantage in attracting law firms 
and legal support firms. Of course, you also want to make sure that the 
area boasts a good mix of nearby retail and food services to complement 
and support the tenants in your building.
 
In addition to job growth, other good signs to look for include the following:
 
✓ Stable-to-increasing wages: The demand for real estate clearly cor-
relates to income levels, so local jobs with strong underlying demand 
are key. With many jobs being outsourced to other parts of the country 
and world, it’s important that the local jobs aren’t only secure but also 
unlikely to see an erosion in purchasing power.
 
✓ A recession-resistant employment base: Traditionally, jobs that enjoy 
stability are in the fields of education, government, and health care. 
Even areas renowned for strong demand and limited supply of real 
estate can slow down if the economy is hit hard, as shown by the col-
lapse of some technology firms in the early-2000s.
 
✓ Employment that’s highly unlikely to be outsourced: Jobs can flow to 
another area of the country or overseas to the latest low-cost manufac-
turing base.
 
✓ Declining unemployment: Examine how the jobless rate has changed 
in recent years. You wouldn’t want to invest your entire savings into a 
rental property located adjacent to the large typewriter factory!

147
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Investigating Your Local 
Real Estate Market
Although everything starts at the regional level, you need to fine-tune your 
perspective and look at your local real estate market, too. All of the same 
types of economic data that you collect on a regional basis are important in 
evaluating your local real estate market.
 
With real estate investing, deciding where to invest is frequently more impor-
tant than choosing the specific rental property. You can have a rental prop-
erty that meets the needs of the market, but if it’s located in a declining area 
where the demand is weak or an area with overbuilding and an excess of avail-
able properties, your investment won’t perform financially. (These are the 
properties that perform the worst over time but are typically the types of 
properties highly touted by the infomercial gurus who love to brag about how 
much real estate they control but rarely tell you about their long-term invest-
ment returns.)
Likewise, you need to determine the areas that may be too richly priced, 
because your cash flow and future appreciation will be hurt if you overpay 
for a property. Often properties in the best neighborhoods in town are so 
overpriced that there is little appreciation potential and thus we advise you 
to seek other properties unless you’re content with low returns similar to 
investing in safe and low yielding bonds.
The problem with forecasting the future
No one can precisely predict the future. And 
with due respect to our friendly economists, 
forecasts of population and job growth can 
go awry. For example, the impact of 9/11 was 
widely predicted to present a crushing blow 
to local economies that relied heavily on tour-
ism. A significant decrease in tourism would 
then ripple through the economy and result in 
heavy job losses and lead to lower real estate 
demand.
There was a short-term impact, and some 
people were adversely affected. However, 
Robert figured that everyone needs a vacation, 
and if folks can’t feel safe traveling abroad, 
then they’re going to travel domestically. So 
he invested in Las Vegas apartments in 2002 
at a time when the major hotels were still lim-
iting their employees to part-time work in an 
effort to stem losses. Within three years, most 
tourism-dependent cities saw a record number 
of visitors — Americans fundamentally shifted 
their travel patterns and habits to travel domes-
tically, where they felt safe.

148
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
In many local real estate markets, the demand for real estate is impacted 
more by the regional economy than by the local economy. For example, 
bedroom communities have high demand for rental homes and apartments 
even though they may only have service sector jobs in the immediate area, 
because the higher income professional and manufacturing jobs are concen-
trated in other areas of the region.
 
In the sections that follow, we help you research quantitative issues to con-
sider when deciding where to invest in real estate. But you also must consider 
other factors, for instance, the weather or recreation and entertainment 
options — all key factors in the livability or quality of life for citizens. All of 
these criteria contribute to the overall desirability of a local market area and 
should be important considerations for the real estate investor. And don’t 
underestimate the image or reputation of an area.
Supply and demand
The supply and demand for real estate in a given market has a direct impact 
on the financial performance of your income property. And although we 
firmly believe that the overall economic prospects for a region or community 
are vital, you must also find supply and demand information about the spe-
cific type of real estate that you plan to purchase.
Obviously, the best environment for investing in real estate is one with 
strong demand and limited supply. When the demand exceeds supply, short-
ages of available real estate push up prices.
Both sides of the equation — supply and demand — have indicators that you 
should evaluate in forming your consensus about the strength of the local 
real estate market. In the sections that follow, we take a close look at each 
indicator in detail. Supply-side indicators include building permits, the rate at 
which new properties have been rented or absorbed into the market, and the 
availability of alternatives for similar real estate. Demand indicators include 
occupancy and rent levels.
The overall relationship between supply and demand determines the market 
conditions for real estate. For example, a large number of pending or recently 
issued building permits, weak absorption or rental of new properties, and 
an excess of income property listings that have been on the market for an 
extended time are all indicators that the supply of a specific product type is 
greater than the demand. Such market conditions soon result in lower occu-
pancy, lower rents, and often rental concessions like free rent or lower rental 
rates early in the lease, which mean lower cash flow and smaller appreciation 
potential. These aren’t the markets you should be seeking.

149
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
When the demand for real estate is high, there are few vacancies and, 
property owners raise rents and eliminate or minimize any concessions. 
In commercial properties, landlords cut back on the tenant improvement 
(TI) allowance and require the tenants to take the space as-is and make any 
upgrades or changes to the space at their own expense.
Building permits and absorption
Building permits are often the first tangible step outlining the intent of a 
developer to build new real estate projects. Therefore, knowing about the 
issuance of building permits is an essential leading indicator to future supply 
of real estate.
 
The trend in the number of building permits tells you how the supply of real 
estate properties may soon change. A long and sustained rise in permits over 
several years can indicate that the supply of new property may dampen future 
price appreciation. Many areas experienced enormous increases in new build-
ing during the late-1980s, right before prices peaked due to excess inventory. 
Conversely, new building dried up in many areas in the late-1970s and early-
1980s as onerous interest rates strangled builders and developers. In the 
early-2000s, despite the record low-interest-rate environment, most parts of 
the country weren’t overbuilding, but by the late-2000s, there was neverthe-
less an excess of supply. Though building levels were in equilibrium with 
demand, the problem was that the demand was artificially inflated. This infla-
tion was the result of governmental pressure to increase home ownership by 
offering creative financing to individuals who were unqualified to borrow such 
large amounts, as well as speculation by some real estate investors. The crazy 
and irresponsible speculation was particularly pronounced in certain Sunbelt 
areas like Las Vegas, Phoenix, and many parts of Florida.
Absorption, the rate at which new buildings are rented and occupied, can be 
useful to determine the potential for the market to become saturated, or over-
supplied with certain types of real estate. A healthy real estate market is one 
in which the available new properties have rented in a relatively short period 
of time — typically measured in months. Absorption is measured in housing 
units for residential properties and in square footage for all commercial types 
of properties.
Absorption can be either a positive or negative number and is usually 
tracked on a quarterly and annual basis:
 
✓ Positive absorption: More space is rented or occupied by owners/
users during the measured time period than was built or taken out of 
the rental housing supply by demolition or even conversion to owner-
occupied condominiums.
 
✓ Negative absorption: The new supply of a given type of real estate is 
being built faster than users can or want to use it.

150
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
You can obtain information on building permits from your local planning or 
building department. Absorption statistics aren’t as easy to find, but absorp-
tion is tracked by local real estate appraisers and real estate brokers. For 
example, professional real estate brokers holding the CCIM (Certified 
Commercial Investment Member) designation specialize in the sale of income 
properties and often have that information. See Chapter 6 for many other rea-
sons to have an appraiser on your real estate team.
 
Building permits and absorption are property-type specific, and an oversupply 
in industrial properties generally has no bearing on other types of commercial 
income properties such as retail or office. The only exception is when the use 
of a property can be changed. For example, many industrial properties have 
been upgraded to add office space for manufacturing firms so they can have 
their administrative functions and operations in the same facility. This type of 
hybrid usage is more difficult to track — but extremely important to note if it’s 
occurring in your proposed investment market.
Another noteworthy trend for residential real estate investors is that new 
construction favors single-family homes rather than multifamily apartments. 
This discrepancy can have a significant impact on your decision whether to 
invest in single-family rental properties or multifamily properties, because 
multifamily properties benefit from the reduced competition. There are sev-
eral reasons for this phenomenon, and we discuss some of them in the sec-
tion “Considering barriers to entry” later in this chapter.
Availability of alternatives — renting versus buying
 
When the cost of buying is relatively low compared with the cost of renting, 
more renters can afford to purchase, thus increasing the number of home 
sales and lowering demand for rentals. A key indicator you can use to gauge 
the market is the number of property listings:
 
✓ Increase in property listings: Increasing numbers of property listings 
or a significant increase in the time the average property is unsold is an 
indication of future trouble for real estate price appreciation. However, 
as property prices reach high levels, some investors decide that they 
can make more money cashing in and investing elsewhere. When the 
market is flooded with listings, prospective buyers can be choosier, 
exerting downward pressure on prices.
 
✓ Decrease in property listings: A sign of a healthy real estate market 
is a decreasing and low level of property listings, which indicates that 
the demand from buyers meets or exceeds the supply of property for 
sale from sellers. At high prices (relative to the cost of renting), more 
prospective buyers elect to rent, and the number of sales relative to 
listings drops.

151
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Occupancy levels
 
Before you invest your hard earned money, determine the current occupancy 
levels for your proposed type of income property.
The market occupancy rate is another way to gauge the supply and demand 
for a given property type in the local market. The market occupancy rate for 
a particular type of property is the percentage of that type of property avail-
able for occupancy that’s currently rented. For example, you may find data 
telling you that there are 2,312 total residential rental units in apartment 
buildings in a local market, and the occupancy rate is 97 percent (or 2,242 
are occupied), which would mean that 3 percent (or approximately 70) of the 
units are vacant. For commercial, industrial, and retail properties, the occu-
pancy level is calculated based on square footage.
With commercial, industrial, and retail properties, determining the occu-
pancy levels is relatively easy. A quick look at the directory or a walkthrough 
of the property can give you a lot of information.
 
The true occupancy rate is actually much more difficult to determine with 
apartment buildings. With apartments, the vacancies aren’t as obvious, and 
obtaining accurate information can be challenging — most professionally man-
aged properties don’t advertise their occupancy levels or volunteer this info 
(nor do they post tenant directories anymore due to safety and privacy con-
cerns). But fear not, we have some suggestions:
 
✓ Trade organizations and industry service providers: Some of these 
groups track this data. For example, the local affiliates of the National 
Apartment Association (www.naahq.org) and the Building Owners and 
Managers Association (www.boma.org) often publish vacancy and rent 
surveys for apartments and office buildings, respectively.
 
✓ The do-it-yourself approach: You can contact owners of comparable 
properties and offer to collect this data and give them a copy of the 
results.
After you acquire the info, here’s how to use it:
 
✓ Low vacancy rates: When combined with a low number of building per-
mits, low vacancy rates generally foretell future real estate price appre-
ciation. If you find minimal vacancy in your market, it’s a landlord’s 
market with higher demand from tenants for existing units, which is a 
good sign for real estate owners. And good for real estate investors, if 
the market prices remain reasonable.
 
✓ High vacancy rates: High rates indicate an excess supply of real estate, 
which may put downward pressure on rental rates as many landlords 
compete to attract tenants.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
Concessions, which typically include free rent, often indicate weakness in the 
rental market. However, some types of real estate and rental markets almost 
always have concessions, no matter how strong the rental market. This prac-
tice is very common in larger professionally managed apartment communities 
where a prospective tenant’s first question when calling to inquire about a 
potential rental unit is inevitably “What’s your special?” Apartments in 
Phoenix and many other areas of the Sunbelt may be able to raise their rents 
and maintain occupancies at or above 95 percent, but they can’t eliminate the 
rental concessions or their rental traffic will simply evaporate. In commercial 
properties, the TI or tenant improvement allowance is similar, with many mar-
kets requiring certain levels of dollars per square foot in custom build-outs or 
upgrades when the rental rate is actually less negotiable. (Check out Chapter 
12 for more information on concessions.)
Rental levels
The trend in rent levels, or rental rates, that renters are willing and able to pay 
over the years also gives a good indication as to the supply/demand relation-
ship for income properties. When the demand for real estate just keeps up 
with the supply of housing and the local economy continues to grow, rents 
generally increase. This increase is a positive sign for continued real estate 
price appreciation.
Of course, you need to be careful to make sure that you’re getting the true 
and complete story on rents. Owners and their property managers are very 
smooth and savvy and don’t allow their quoted rental rates to fall when the 
market shows some signs of softening. This strategy is logical because other 
tenants may have recently leased at a higher rate and would be upset to see 
the new tenants getting a better deal. So owners and property managers offer 
concessions or other perks to make sure that they’re competitive in the cur-
rent market while maintaining the perception of stable rents.
 
As a prospective rental property owner competing against these owners, you 
need to evaluate the current rent levels on a level playing field, so you want to 
calculate the effective rental rate. For example, if you see a comparable rental 
property available at $1,200 per month, but the owner is offering a concession 
of one month free rent on a 12-month lease, the effective rent is really $1,100 
per month (the $1,200 loss spread out over the rest of the year).
 
An advantage of investing in commercial real estate is that there are few gov-
ernmental regulations and controls, and the relationship between tenants and 
landlords is essentially a free market. However, residential rent control or rent 
stabilization (local laws regulating how much rents may increase) is an issue 
in some cities and towns. Investing in markets with rent control, or even with 
a pro-tenant environment where a landlord has difficulty terminating a lease, 
may not provide adequate returns on investment, and appreciation will be 
more limited. Although occupancy levels are usually strong in such areas, 

153
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
your overall cash flow may be threatened because the property’s expenses 
may rise faster than you can legally raise the rents. In these communities, 
landlords who invest in major upgrades or capital improvements to a rental 
unit may not be able to raise rents or recover their costs because any rent 
increases must be approved by the local rent control board. Then, even if 
allowed at all, the approved capital improvements are amortized or spread 
over many years. Don’t put your real estate future in the hands of others!
Path of progress
 
Buying real estate in up-and-coming areas with new development or renovated 
properties not only greatly enhances the ease of finding and keeping good ten-
ants but also leads to higher occupancy, lower turnover, and higher rates of 
appreciation.
In virtually all major cities, some areas are experiencing new construction 
and growth — and have the reputation of being the area to live in. But by the 
time most folks feel this way, you’ve lost an opportunity to get in when prices 
have more appreciation potential. So, here are a few indicators to use to stay 
ahead of the game:
 
✓ Follow the retailers: You can often take a clue about where you should 
invest by looking for major retailers who do extensive research before 
making a decision to open in a given neighborhood. For instance, maybe 
a new Costco or Sam’s Club is anchoring the new shopping center.
 
✓ Follow the highways: One of the best and most obvious indicators of 
where new development is headed is transportation. But make sure that 
the roads or mass transit projects actually get built. With so many fund-
ing and environmental challenges today, it can be extremely risky to 
invest in real estate based on proposed transportation projects. But after 
they’re built, you’re sure to find real estate investment opportunities.
But the path of progress isn’t limited to new development. Many cities have 
areas that have seen better days and local leaders are doing their best to 
revitalize these tired and even blighted sections of town. A key component 
can be redevelopment districts that are formed with the property tax rev-
enues being diverted to a special redevelopment agency that promotes new 
projects through a streamlined approval process and financial assistance. 
Often, the traditional downtown areas are being redeveloped with many 
incentives for developers and owners willing to be among the first ones in.
 
Although redevelopment areas can be great opportunities, significant risk is 
associated with investing in areas that are dynamic and changing. Like trans-
portation projects, sometimes the best intentions of local leaders and redevel-
opment agencies can hit a snag.

154
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Considering barriers to entry
 
Investing in real estate in an area that has strong demand and limited supply 
is likely to enhance your profitably. One of the trends to follow is the creation 
of more roadblocks to new development and thus severe limitations on the 
construction of additional buildings to meet even the increasing demands for 
real estate from natural population growth.
For example, maybe your chosen area has inhabitants with strong anti-
apartment sentiments or concerns about the environment. If you currently 
own or quickly invest in existing apartments in such areas, these factors 
can actually work to your benefit, because they make the addition of more 
housing units (competition) difficult.
Stepping in the path of progress
One of Robert’s best real estate investments 
was a 30,000-square-foot, two-story medi-
cal center complex on three acres in Santee, 
California, a suburban bedroom community 
of San Diego. The building had been a hub of 
activity before the large medical group that 
occupied the property disbanded. The building 
was foreclosed on by the lender and was virtu-
ally vacant for several years, because the area 
didn’t easily attract new tenants due to the lack 
of nearby sit-down restaurants and shopping.
However, Robert found out that major redevel-
opment was planned around the new trolley and 
transportation center located within a half mile. 
Besides a multiscreen cinema as the anchor 
tenant, the brand-new center would include 
everything from clothing stores to bookstores, 
plus several new restaurants. Robert was con-
fident that the new center would be a catalyst 
for the entire area, so he quickly purchased the 
rundown and neglected two-building center for 
less than the assessed value on the property tax 
rolls. His investment plans included significant 
renovation — including complete exterior 
painting, parking lot repairs, installation of a 
large monument sign for tenant promotion, plus 
cleaning and upgrading the vacant suites. He 
also renamed the complex Santee Professional 
Center to improve its image, build identity in the 
community, and attract nonmedical tenants.
Lest you think that Robert made the perfect 
investment that had no snags, soon after his 
purchase the national cinema chain filed bank-
ruptcy and the developer halted plans. But a 
new developer came in and signed the national 
department store Target as the anchor tenant, 
and within 18 months, they had built and fully 
leased the new 500,000-square-foot shop-
ping center. Now there are several other new 
office buildings completed or planned, as well 
as major upgrades to the other buildings in the 
area. The Santee Professional Center has been 
running at high occupancy and was recently 
appraised at nearly three times the acquisition 
price!

155
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
 
We suggest that you look for markets where natural and even man-made barri-
ers to entry exist.
The popular board game Monopoly taught most people from an early age 
about the importance of location and barriers to entry. When you control the 
playing field and prime properties, you dramatically improve your odds of 
successfully building wealth. In the following sections, we cover some of the 
more prominent factors that limit the supply of real estate and enhance cash 
flow and future appreciation for those who already own existing properties.
 
But, in the long term, the lack of buildable land in an area can prove a prob-
lem. Real estate prices that are too high may cause employers and employees 
to relocate to less expensive areas. If you want to invest in real estate in an 
area with little buildable land and sky-high prices, run the numbers to see 
whether the deal makes economic sense. (We explain how to do this in 
Chapters 11 and 12.)
Environmental issues
Individuals and organizations concerned about the environment aren’t a new 
trend. Environmental issues are now a key factor in the potential develop-
ment of real estate projects in just about every area of the country.
Those concerned about the environment are expressing their disapproval 
of new and proposed projects with more authority and success because fed-
eral and state laws require excruciating investigative reports on all aspects 
of proposed land development. It’s extremely difficult in most urban areas 
to find land suitable for development that doesn’t have some limitations or 
require remediation, such as the relocation or preservation of endangered 
species or plants. (Remediation can also include the cleanup and removal of 
contaminants.)
Many of these laws or guidelines find universal support — no one wants to 
live in a concrete world or destroy our beautiful countryside. And nearly 
everyone wants clean air, clean water, and the highest quality of living 
possible.
But preserving and protecting our environment comes at a cost: A large por-
tion of potential developable land is being taken out of production or even 
consideration for use. The land that isn’t available for development is being 
broadened and now includes much of the government-owned lands and virtu-
ally all land that can be classified as a hillside, wetland, or vernal pool (sea-
sonal or temporary wetland). In many areas, additional swaths of public and 
private land are being designated and set aside by governmental agencies to 
protect endangered plants and wildlife.

156
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
These man-made decisions to preserve land, combined with other factors, 
can lead to a shortage of buildable land.
Shortage of buildable land
Economics 101 teaches that strong demand and a limited supply lead to 
rationing through higher pricing. Well, that is exactly what’s happening 
over the decades in many of America’s major metropolitan areas as people 
exhaust the supply of buildable land (notwithstanding the general decline in 
real estate prices in the late-2000s).
Upward pressure on real estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little 
buildable land. This characteristic was one of the things that attracted Eric 
to invest in real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area when he moved there 
in the mid-1980s. If you look at a map of this area, you can see that the city 
of San Francisco and the communities to the south are on a peninsula. The 
ocean, bay inlets, and mountains bound the rest of the Bay Area. More than 
80 percent of the land in the greater Bay Area isn’t available for development 
because state and federal government parks, preserves, and other areas pro-
tect the land from development, or the land is impossible to develop. Of the 
land available for development in San Francisco and the vast majority of it in 
nearby counties, virtually all of it had already been developed.
CANES: Citizens Against Nearly Everything
Many cities are now putting more authority into the hands of local and even 
neighborhood planning boards that exercise their influence and control over 
proposed new developments. Although many of the representatives on these 
local planning boards are just interested in maintaining the aesthetics or 
compatibility of proposed developments with the existing land uses, some 
are motivated by another agenda.
The term CANES — Citizens Against Nearly Everything — was coined by then-
San Diego Padres President Larry Lucchino, whom Robert interviewed on his 
weekly radio show many times while the baseball team proposed and fought 
for the development of a new ballpark. Various groups claiming to represent 
taxpayers, citizens, and environmentalists objected at every opportunity. 
Ultimately, after years of delays and dozens of lawsuits, the ballpark finally 
opened in downtown San Diego.
This trend isn’t unique to San Diego. Across the country, those opposed to 
growth seek to avoid increased traffic, congestion, and overcrowding of their 
schools and parks. In many communities and neighborhoods, homeowners 
are expressing their disapproval of new multifamily development. (If you 
want a big turnout at city hall, just announce that 300 new low-income apart-
ments are being built across the street from the new for-sale housing tract.)

157
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
 
Such resistance to new development or even redevelopment isn’t new. But it 
does seem to be a trend that should be considered by even a real estate inves-
tor with a duplex or a couple of rental homes. Unbridled growth isn’t the 
answer (nor are stagnation and decline), but our point is that you need to 
evaluate the impact of such attitudes on your income properties. Barriers to 
entry are a reality that you shouldn’t overlook.
For example, increased demand in a community opposed to growth results in 
higher prices, so investing in these areas certainly enhances your prospects 
for appreciation. However, well-planned or smart growth can also lead to a 
higher quality of living and greater long-term returns on your investment.
Condo conversion and construction defect lawsuits
 
Carefully evaluate the impact of the condominium market in your area 
because it can have a material effect on the overall supply of rental housing. 
Apartments converted to condos often result in fewer rental units because 
condo conversion units are typically purchased by owner-occupants that find 
such housing to be a financially viable entry-level opportunity. But the reverse 
trend is also a concern because many areas have a significant number of failed 
condo conversion projects where only a portion of the units are sold; the 
remaining units are in foreclosure or bankruptcy and are being sold in bulk to 
owners who rent them until the market improves. New condominiums are 
often purchased by investors to use as rentals that will compete for tenants. 
Some of these projects were financially unsuccessful and are in the hands of 
court-appointed receivers or lenders. These are supply and demand factors 
that can affect your real estate market and should be part of your real estate 
strategy.
Many apartment buildings in urban areas were originally built as condomini-
ums, but market weakness or the threat of construction defect legislation 
(discussed later in this section) led to a business decision by the developers 
to operate these condos as rental units. There isn’t much controversy about 
the ultimate conversion of these rental condos to owner-occupied units; it’s 
just a function of market timing, with most remaining as rentals in the current 
market environment.
However, a dilemma faced by many cities is the excessive number of conver-
sion projects of apartment rental communities into condominiums. On one 
hand, the severe shortage of affordable entry-level housing in many cities 
made the conversion of apartments to condominiums an excellent opportu-
nity for first-time home buyers. The concern was that conversion of apart-
ments to owner-occupied condos reduced the supply of rentals.
How are condo conversions typically handled? The most common game plan 
for a conversion of an existing apartment community to a condominium proj-
ect almost always consists of extensive exterior renovation, including painting, 

158
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
landscaping, and other cosmetic items. Occasionally, local ordinances require 
some structural repairs or upgrades, but the exterior work is primarily limited 
to the cosmetic issues. In other words, rarely do developers spend a lot of 
money on a new roof!
The unit interiors also receive a complete overhaul and upgrade — new floor-
ing, window treatments, new and often upgraded appliances, and solid coun-
tertops and other decorative touches to really make the unit shine. These 
converted condos can be quite attractive as reasonably priced investments 
that look great and are well located, many times in areas where new devel-
opment is difficult because the area is completely built-out and the cost to 
acquire the land would be prohibitive. But you need to look deeper than the 
smoke and mirrors that create the attractive façade of quality construction.
 
The problem is that in most cases, the existing building systems, such as the 
roof, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC, haven’t been upgraded or replaced. So 
you may have a brand-new interior that looks sharp, but the major structural 
systems are quite old. Also, properties built under the code requirements in 
effect at the time of original construction usually have lower standards for 
weatherproofing, insulation, and noise reduction. If you buy one of these con-
verted apartments as a rental property, you may not know that your tenants 
can hear everything (and we mean everything) that goes on in the adjacent 
unit. That is, until they call to complain!
This conversion of apartments to condominiums can impact the rental 
market in one of two ways.
 
✓ Some of the condos are purchased by individuals that intend to live 
there personally. In this case, that reduces the rental housing stock, 
which means less competition for apartments.
 
 Further, a good balance of owner-occupied housing units (with their 
inherent increased pride of ownership) can be healthy for the overall 
rental market. We strongly advise real estate investors to purchase 
rental homes in areas that are predominantly owner-occupied.
 
✓ Other converted condos aren’t owner occupied, with many investors 
snapping up the reasonably priced units, speculating that they’ll enjoy 
good returns. These units will be rented out, so there is no reduction in 
the rental housing stock.
 
In the long run, we believe that investing in condominiums that began life as 
apartments isn’t wise. In the early years, when the appliances and surface 
interior and exterior cosmetic finishes are relatively new, not much can go 
wrong. But after the true age of the building begins to show through increased 

159
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
repairs and maintenance, the volunteer association board of directors will 
face a real challenge. Will it be willing and able to dramatically increase the 
monthly assessments to cover the increased costs and to accrue the funds 
necessary to handle major capital items? Robert has managed associations for 
30+ years, and his experience is that the assessments stay artificially low and 
the property condition declines over time. You don’t want to own a unit in an 
association with major physical problems and no reserves.
The construction of new, attached, for-sale housing (or condominiums) has 
been severely restricted since the 1990s in many parts of the country due 
to construction defect lawsuits. The building industry claims that such law-
suits are unnecessary and extremely wasteful, and the attorneys represent-
ing homeowners insist that litigation would be unwarranted if the builders 
simply didn’t build such shoddy and poorly constructed housing units. At the 
end of the day, the reality is that construction defect lawsuits are reducing 
the number of attached housing projects that are being built, because insur-
ance is virtually nonexistent for developers and subcontractors.
Government’s effect on real estate
This country offers many examples of the importance of state and local gov-
ernment on prospects for prosperity. The following are key governmental 
and quasi-governmental factors to consider when researching a prospective 
community in which to invest:
 
✓ Tax considerations: For decades, California had an unbeatable combina-
tion of great weather and job growth that attracted millions from around 
the world. In the early-2000s, California suffered from a declining economy 
and what some real estate investors and business owners felt was exces-
sive government regulation and taxation. After the recall of Governor Gray 
Davis in 2003 and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was a lot 
of reason for “Kali-fornians” to be optimistic. Unfortunately, the last few 
years have seen increasing tension between political factions and an ever-
increasing litany of pro-tenant, anti-investment, job-killing legislation poli-
cies that offset many of the natural attributes of California and are being 
exploited by other western states.
 
 California real estate investors and others with means are establishing 
legal residency in Nevada, Texas, Washington, Florida, and other states 
without state income taxes in increasing numbers. It can make a signifi-
cant improvement in a person’s overall income tax liability, and it may 
not even be that much of a sacrifice. For example, a California real estate 
syndicator that attended one of Robert’s property management courses 
found that living on the east side of beautiful Lake Tahoe (in the state of 

160
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Nevada) was just as nice as the west (or California) side, where the top 
income tax rate can add up to another 10 percent in addition to the fed-
eral income tax.
 
 You should also have a detailed understanding of the property taxation 
system and appeals process. Be sure to determine whether a proposed 
income property acquisition is in a special assessment district where 
additional taxes are assessed against properties. Such special assess-
ment districts may offer some advantages like better schools, parks, and 
fire and police services and may be well worth the additional annual 
investment. But you should know in advance how much the additional 
costs will be, how long you’ll be required to participate, and exactly 
what you’re getting in return so that you can properly evaluate whether 
you’ll be able to generate a commensurate increase in your rental 
income.
 
✓ Economic development incentives: The economic development groups 
for many of these states are advertising in business publications and 
major newspapers and aggressively encouraging employers to relocate 
with incredible real estate incentives such as virtually free land or lower 
property and/or income taxation. Besides lucrative offers of real estate 
and tax incentives, as the global economy becomes ever more competi-
tive, businesses are being lured to locations that can reduce their costs 
of labor, energy, and transportation.
 
✓ Community’s reputation: Your local chamber of commerce, tourism 
bureau, and city hall all work very hard to establish the right reputa-
tion and attract the top employers. These organizations can have a real 
impact on the market environment for businesses and thus create more 
jobs in the long run, which leads to increased population and higher 
demand for all types of real estate.
 
✓ Business-friendly environment: You can’t underestimate the impor-
tance of a probusiness attitude among state, regional, and local gov-
ernments to help create a vibrant economy where your real estate 
investments can prosper.
Comparing Neighborhoods
The reputation of particular neighborhoods can be based on many factors. 
Certain key or essential elements differentiate the neighborhoods with good 
reputations and positive trends from the areas that are stagnant or trending 
the wrong direction.

161
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Schools
 
If you don’t have school-age children, you may not initially be concerned 
about the reputation and test scores of the local schools. Think again. 
Whether you’re investing in residential or commercial income properties, 
schools matter. The demand for residential and commercial property (and the 
subsequent value of the property) is highly correlated to the quality of local 
schools.
Ask any real estate agent about the impact of schools on the demand and 
sales price for a home in a great school district. Likewise, employers use the 
quality of local schools in recruiting their key personnel — and sometimes 
even relocate company facilities to be near areas known for their schools.
The Internet can be a very useful tool in determining the quality of local 
schools. Most school districts have Web sites that include information on 
the test scores of their students for mandatory state and federal testing. 
Unfortunately, many people make snap judgments about school quality 
without doing their homework. Visit the schools and don’t blindly rely on 
test scores. Talk to parents and teachers, and discover what goes on at the 
school.
Crime rates
Crime can have a significant and sobering effect on the demand and desir-
ability of all types of income properties. No one wants to live in a high crime 
area, and commercial tenants and their customers neither work at nor 
patronize unsafe businesses. No areas are going to be crime-free, but you 
don’t want to find out after the close of escrow that you have purchased a 
rental property that is claimed by rival gangs. Before you make your invest-
ment decision, consult these sources:
 
✓ Local law enforcement: Contact local law enforcement and obtain the 
latest and historical crime statistics.
 
✓ Local newspapers: Newspapers often have a police-blotter section that 
provides information on major and even petty crimes in the community.
 
✓ Sexual-offender databases: Laws require certain convicted sexual 
offenders to register with local law enforcement. These databases 
allow you to identify the general locations of convicted sex offenders 
who have committed sexual offenses against minors and violent sexual 
offenses against anyone.

162
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
 These databases aren’t foolproof. The states haven’t been consistent 
in their efforts to maintain and make them available. Also, persons 
required to register don’t always follow the requirements, but at least 
you can find out about the known ones.
 
 Be sure to advise your tenants to check the database; this information is 
dynamic, and everyone needs to make their own decision about the 
safety of his or her family. You should always disclose any known regis-
tered individuals in the neighborhood (but that doesn’t mean that you 
need to do the research).
Pride of ownership
 
Pride of ownership is an intangible attitude that has tangible results. Pride of 
ownership also has no economic boundaries — even modest-income areas 
can really look sharp. Look for rental properties in neighborhoods that reflect 
pride of ownership — well-kept and litter-free grounds, trimmed plants, beau-
tiful flowers, fresh paint, and so on. This curb appeal helps you attract and 
retain your tenants.
Although everyone may have a different perception of exactly what consti-
tutes a well-maintained property, pride of ownership is readily apparent, and 
the effort made by business owners and homeowners to keep their proper-
ties looking sharp is important to real estate values.
You may find that some of the more aesthetically pleasing areas look that 
way for a reason. Homeowner’s associations and business parks typically 
have a board of directors and architectural review committees that routinely 
inspect the properties under their jurisdiction, as well as review and restrict 
improvements to meet certain standards.
Other areas may have informal committees of neighbors who band together 
to keep their properties in tiptop condition. This tendency is also true of mul-
tifamily residential and commercial properties, and these properties usually 
must also submit to local laws and regulations enforced by the building or 
code enforcement departments.
You can control the appearance, condition, and maintenance of your own 
property, but your options are limited if the properties surrounding it fall 
into disrepair. Your purchase of a fixer-upper and the investment of time, 
money, and sweat equity won’t be rewarded financially if the surrounding 
properties are in a state of disrepair and have owners that don’t really care.

163
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
 
Property values, occupancy, and rental rates all sag when property owners no 
longer take pride in their property. Avoid declining neighborhoods that dis-
play the red flags of dispirited owners — poorly kept properties, junk-filled 
vacant lots, inoperative cars in the parking lot or street, graffiti, vandalism, 
and deferred maintenance. Neighborhood deterioration is a blight that 
spreads from one property to another.
Role play: What attracts 
you to the property?
One of the best ways to evaluate the prospects for a particular neighbor-
hood is to play the role of a residential tenant looking for the best place to 
call home. Go back in time to when you made the decision to live in your 
neighborhood. What were the primary criteria you used to make that deter-
mination? You’re probably typical of many of your potential tenants. They 
prefer rental properties in close proximity to various amenities, all of which 
can be captured in a property knowledge sheet.
Property knowledge sheets
One of the best ways to have the answers to the questions that may be raised 
by your rental prospect is to prepare a property knowledge sheet for each 
of your rental property locations. A property knowledge sheet contains all the 
basic information about your rental property, such as the size and type of the 
rental unit and the unit number (for multiple-unit properties), plus the age, 
type of construction, and other important details about the unit.
 
A thorough property knowledge sheet also contains important information 
about the local neighborhood and general area. Like the chamber of com-
merce or visitor’s information bureau, you want to be able to answer ques-
tions about the area. Rental prospects are generally interested in knowing 
about employment centers, transportation, local schools, child-care, places of 
worship, shopping, and medical facilities. You can really make a positive 
impression on your rental prospect if you can tell them where the nearest dry 
cleaner or Thai restaurant is located.
With all this vital information from your property knowledge sheet at your 
fingertips, you can be ready to answer your rental prospect’s questions. The 
more you know about your property, the easier it is for you to offer impor-
tant reasons for a prospect to select your rental over the competition.

164
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Property knowledge sheets can definitely give you the edge over your compe-
tition. Because you’re often competing with large multifamily rental proper-
ties, you need to be prepared to answer important questions about the area. 
Often, immediately knowing a detail such as whether a certain child-care 
center is in your area can make the difference between success and failure.
Check out Figure 10-1 for an example of a property knowledge sheet.

Commercial property considerations
Looking at a property from a tenant’s perspective is also useful if you’re 
investing in commercial properties. Remember that your commercial tenants 
are in business to make money — and their location is often a key factor. 
Have you ever seen a small retail center that includes several vacant suites 
with butcher paper in the windows? That is the universal sign that a property 
is in financial trouble and in need of proactive ownership, management, and 
leasing — or the spiral toward foreclosure will continue.
Right down the street from a failing property, you may find another retail 
property with long-term leases and a waiting list, because successful retail-
ers almost always flock together. That explains the success of many regional 
shopping malls that command high rents. Sometimes, just getting the right 
anchor or primary tenant in a commercial, industrial, or retail income prop-
erty is all it takes to start the chain reaction toward the dream for any land-
lord — high occupancy, high rents, and low turnover!
Finding well-situated properties is easier when you’re considering investing 
in an area where you’ve lived your entire life, but not as easy for investing in 
other locales. Nonetheless, every area has potential if you know what you’re 
looking for and are willing to take the time to do the research.
Mastering Seller’s Markets 
and Buyer’s Markets
Some real estate investors make the mistake of not continuing to research 
the economics of their real estate markets after they’ve made their invest-
ments. Even if you plan to buy and hold, you need to pay attention to the 
market conditions. As we have seen, the criteria we advise you to consider in 
making decisions about which markets are the best for investing are dynamic 
and can fluctuate.
Savvy real estate investors monitor their markets and look for the telltale 
signs of real estate cycles. These cycles present opportunities for expanding 
your real estate portfolio or repositioning from weaker markets to stronger 
markets because not all areas experience peaks and troughs at the same 
time. That is why you need to know and track the timing of seller’s and buy-
er’s markets.

166
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Understanding real estate cycles
We believe that real estate is cyclical and that successful real estate inves-
tors always remain aware of the real estate cycles in their areas. First, we 
need to define what we mean by seller’s or buyer’s market:
 
✓ A buyer’s market occurs when current property owners are unable to 
sell their properties quickly and must be more flexible on the price and 
terms. This is a great opportunity to seek seller financing.
 
✓ A seller’s market is almost like the classic definition of inflation — “too 
much money chasing too few goods.” In this case, the goods are real 
estate properties, which are in high demand. When sellers are receiving 
multiple offers within 24 to 48 hours of a listing or you see properties 
selling for more than the asking price, you’re in a strong seller’s market.
Real estate traditionally experiences cycles as the demand for real estate 
leads to a shortage of supply and higher rents and appreciation. That leads 
to the building of additional properties, which, along with changes in demand 
due to economic cycles, usually results in overbuilding and a decline in rents 
and property valuation.
However, not everyone agrees that real estate cycles are relevant to residen-
tial real estate investors. Some of the real estate infomercial gurus claim that 
real estate investing in homes and apartments is recession-proof because 
people always need a place to live. Although that is partly true, we think that 
the economic base of the community where you invest does have a direct 
impact on all aspects of your operations — occupancy, turnover, rental rates, 
and even quality of tenant.
For example, when times are tough, residential tenants are the first to impro-
vise, with some finding that “doubling up” or even taking in roommates is 
palatable if it results in lower costs for housing. Some renters are even willing 
to move back in with Mom and Dad or another relative when their personal 
budgets don’t allow them to have their own rental unit.
Robert has managed all types of income properties throughout the western 
states and has observed a broad cross-section of economic activity. He has 
seen how real estate cycles may be similar in a particular region but often 
vary from region to region. For example, when some areas of the country 
were setting records for rents in the mid-’80s, landlords couldn’t give away 
their apartments in Texas. Even venerable California was a miserable place 
to own real estate in the early-’90s. In the late-2000s, areas where real estate 
speculation and condo converters went crazy have suffered.

167
 Chapter 10: Location, Location, Value
Can real estate investors who track these real estate cycles make investment 
decisions based on this information? Absolutely. That is where most success-
ful and knowledgeable real estate investors see potential for increasing their 
real estate investment returns by timing the real estate market.
Timing the real estate market
Although the length and depth of the real estate cycles vary, there are clear 
highs and lows that real estate investors need to consider.
In some real estate markets, the double-digit appreciation over the first 
half of this decade brought record prices for homes and income proper-
ties. In the mid-2000s, the most common question for Robert on his live 
Southern California NBC call-in feature was “Should I buy income properties 
in Southern California at these seemingly high price levels, or should I invest 
elsewhere?” These callers didn’t want to miss out on what they thought was 
almost guaranteed price appreciation. But what goes up must come down, so 
when the market corrected in the late-2000s with significant price declines in 
most areas of the country, the question Robert hears is “When will we reach 
the bottom of the market?”
No one-size-fits-all answer solves this critical question. A key factor is the 
investment horizon, or planned holding period for a particular investor and 
that specific investment. If the holding period is long enough, even purchas-
ing income properties in today’s overpriced markets will probably look good 
15 to 20 years from now.
The alternatives are to identify those markets with excellent economic fun-
damentals where prices have remained low and invest there. The concept is 
similar to the “buy low, sell high” truism for stocks, except you sell in over-
priced markets and reinvest in the lower priced markets. Such markets do 
exist, but the question is whether the properties in the lower priced markets 
are going to provide the same or better investment returns in the long run 
versus alternative markets.
 
Unlike the stock market, real estate transactions entail significant transaction 
costs (as a percentage of the market value of the property). That’s why selling 
and buying property too frequently undermines your returns.
It’s our contention that even in the few markets where such “bargains” exist, 
they aren’t really great opportunities. We are reminded of the business con-
cept that in the long run you usually get what you pay for! There is so much 
more than just the projected rent and the selling price. Without going into 

168
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
a detailed analysis of property condition, expenses, and other invaluable 
criteria, you should simply consider whether these areas pass muster after 
performing the economic analysis described earlier. Probably not.
Carleton Sheets, plus many other well-known infomercial gurus, have tra-
ditionally advised their followers that you should seek income properties 
where the projected gross monthly income is at least 1 percent of the pur-
chase price. This strategy would mean that if you acquire a rental property 
with a projected monthly income of $2,000, your acquisition costs should 
not exceed $200,000. The advice is sound, but there are fewer and fewer 
markets where such properties exist. You may remember from your reading 
on investments that risk and return are generally related. That is, the lower 
the risk you take, the lower your expected return. (That is why short-term 
government-backed bonds and federally insured money market accounts 
offer nominal rates of interest or return on investment, and investments with 
higher risk, such as real estate, demand higher rates of return.)
So the real question is, what are the risk-adjusted returns like for investing in 
these areas of the country with record high prices versus the risk-adjusted 
returns available in other, lower-priced real estate markets? You may find 
a rural property where the monthly rent exceeds 1 percent of the purchase 
price, but what about rent growth and appreciation? At the end of the day, 
you may find that your lower priced market with all of those “bargains” pro-
vided you with minimal cash flow and marginal appreciation.
Knowing when to sell and when to buy real estate is easier said than done. 
But if you follow the fundamentals of economic analysis, and remember that 
“location, location, value” is the key to successful real estate investing, you 
can do well.

Chapter 11
Understanding Leases and 
Property Valuation
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at leases and their terms
▶ Comprehending valuation
▶ Developing value benchmarks
L
ocation, as discussed in Chapter 10, is an important consideration when 
looking to invest in income property. But what you pay for the property 
and the cash flow it generates make a significant difference in the success of 
your investment. Leases generate the income stream you should base your 
real estate investment strategy on. All the quantitative analysis we guide you 
through in Chapter 12 is for naught if you don’t have a handle on the leases. 
Therefore, in this chapter, you start your research, analysis, and evaluation 
of specific properties by analyzing the leases.
We then introduce you to the concepts behind evaluating potential invest-
ment properties and explain the key principles behind property valuation 
that you need to be familiar with. We also provide you with a few quantitative 
tools you can use to size up prospective properties and determine whether 
you should move on to other properties or investigate further.
The Importance of Evaluating a Lease
A lease is a contractual obligation between a lessor (landlord) and a lessee 
(tenant) to transfer the right to exclusive possession and use of certain real 
property for a defined time period for an agreed consideration (money). A 
verbal lease can be enforceable, but it’s much better to have a written lease 
that defines the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and the tenant.

170
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
Owning a nice rental property with attractive and well-maintained buildings 
may give you a sense of pride of ownership, but what you’re really investing in 
are the leases. Successful real estate investors know that an excellent opportu-
nity is to find properties with leases that offer upside potential in the form of 
higher income and/or stability of tenancy.
Regardless of the type of property you’re considering as an investment, make 
sure that the seller provides all of the leases. And don’t accept just the first 
page or a summary of the salient points of the lease — insist on the full and 
complete lease document along with any addendums or written modifica-
tions with the seller’s written certification that the document is accurate and 
valid. (Verbal modifications to the written lease aren’t generally enforceable.) 
Have your real estate legal advisor review the leases as well (see Chapter 6).
 
Existing leases almost always run with the property upon transfer of ownership 
and thus are enforceable. The new owner of the property can’t simply renegoti-
ate or void the current leases he doesn’t like. Because you’re legally obligated 
for all terms and conditions of current leases if you buy a property, be sure 
that you thoroughly understand all aspects of the property’s current leases.
You may find that you’re presented with the opportunity to purchase proper-
ties with leases that are detriments to the property and actually bring down 
its current and future value. For example, the leases may be so far above the 
current market conditions that you should discount the likelihood that the 
leases will be in place and enforceable in the future.
Other common problems with leases include
 
✓ The leases are preprinted boilerplate forms (as opposed to a custom-
ized lease tailored to the specific tenant-landlord agreement) that may 
or may not comply with current laws or issues relevant for the specific 
tenant.
 
✓ The charges for late payments, returned checks, or other administrative 
fees may not be clearly defined or may be unenforceable.
 
✓ The rules and regulations may not be comprehensive or enforceable.
 
✓ There is no rent escalation clause, which spells out future rent increases, 
or it isn’t clearly defined.
We’re not saying to bypass purchasing any properties with leases with these 
problems. Just be aware and factor the effect, if any, into your purchasing 
decision, or just simply note that you need to change the onerous terms 
upon renewal.

171
 Chapter 11: Understanding Leases and Property Valuation
Reviewing a Lease: What to Look For
 
A seller should be honest and disclose all material facts about the property 
he’s selling, but most states don’t have the same written disclosure require-
ments that are mandated for residential transactions. So even though your 
broker or sales agent and other members of your due diligence investigation 
team (see Chapter 6) may be assisting you with inspecting the property and 
reviewing the books provided during the transaction, remember that at the 
end of the day, you need to be the one who cares the most about your best 
interests.
Note the expiration dates of the leases, because any lease that’s about to 
expire should be evaluated based on current market conditions. Future 
leases may not be at the same rent level, plus you must consider the conces-
sions or tenant improvements necessary to get the lease renewed:
 
✓ Residential lease renewals may require a monetary concession or pos-
sibly a perk for the tenants, such as cleaning their carpets or installing 
microwaves or ceiling fans.
 
✓ Commercial lease renewals can require significant tenant improvements 
or rent concessions.
 
Factor these costs into your analysis because renewing a tenant, even with the 
associated costs, is typically much more cost effective than losing the tenant.
Comprehending a residential lease
The analysis of current leases for residential properties is usually fairly 
straightforward, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do your homework! 
Review each and every residential lease to make sure that no hidden sur-
prises are awaiting you, such as future free rent, limits to rent increases, or 
promises of new carpet or other expensive upgrades. Some sneaky sellers of 
residential properties know that some buyers don’t thoroughly review each 
lease, so they load the leases with future rent concessions in exchange for 
higher rents up front, which they use to make the property’s financial state-
ments look more desirable. The net effective rent is what you’re looking for 
to make your payments. An above-market lease isn’t really above market if 
you’re giving away free rent or promising to replace the carpet upon lease 
renewal.

172
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Making sense of a commercial lease
 
Commercial leases are much more complicated than residential ones. Thus, 
the commercial real estate investor must have a thorough understanding of 
the contractual obligations and duties of the lessor (landlord) and lessee 
(tenant).
The analysis of commercial leases is typically called lease abstraction. A 
lease abstract is a written summary of all the significant terms and conditions 
contained in the lease and is much more than a rent roll. Although a good 
rent roll covers the lease basics — rent, square footage, length of lease, and 
renewal date or options — a good abstract covers other key tenant issues 
such as signage, rights of expansion and contraction, and even restrictions 
or limitations on leasing to other tenants that offer similar products and ser-
vices. Have written lease abstracts prepared for any commercial property 
you’re considering to ensure that you understand all the terms.
When obtaining financing for commercial properties, lenders typically 
require a certified or signed rent roll along with a written lease abstract for 
each tenant. However, because the income of the property is critical to the 
owner’s ability to make the debt service obligations, most lenders don’t 
simply rely on the buyer’s numbers but independently derive their own 
income projections based on information they require the purchaser to 
obtain from the tenants. This information includes
 
✓ Lease estoppel: A lease estoppel certificate is a legal document completed 
by the tenant that outlines the basic terms of his lease agreement and 
certifies that the lease is valid without any breaches by either the tenant 
or the landlord at the time it’s executed. These estoppel certificates also 
benefit the purchaser of the property; you should seriously consider 
requiring estoppels from all tenants when you purchase a commercial 
building — regardless of the requirements of any lender.
 
 Although tenant or lease estoppel certificates are rarely required by lend-
ers or purchasers for residential transactions, there is a strong argument 
that the benefits of the estoppel certificate also apply in the residential 
setting. Residential tenants are more likely to dispute the amount of the 
security deposit or claim that they were entitled to unwritten promises by 
the previous owner — free rent, new carpet, or waived late charges.
 
✓ Financial statements: The rent provided in the lease is a concern, but 
the amount you actually collect determines the profitability of your real 
estate investment. Because of this, many leases require the commercial 
tenant to periodically provide (or present upon request) a recent financial 
statement.

173
 Chapter 11: Understanding Leases and Property Valuation
 
✓ Recent sales info: Most retail leases have provisions for percentage 
rents, in which the tenant pays a base rent plus additional rent based 
on a percentage of sales. The percentage rent is often on a sliding scale: 
The percentage paid by the tenant increases as its sales increase. Be 
sure that you receive and review recent sales information and ensure 
that the tenant is current on its percentage rent payments.
 
Reviewing the financial strength or sales figures for your commercial and 
retail tenants can be an excellent indicator of the future results of your prop-
erty. Many of your best tenants in the future will be your small tenants that 
have successful businesses and need to expand. Also, look at the personal 
guarantees provided to see whether they’re backed by sufficient resources. 
The compatibility of the tenant mix is also important.
 
One of the best ways to make money in real estate is to find commercial leases 
where the person in charge of the property isn’t collecting the proper rent due 
under the terms of the lease. For example, you may find that the rent roll from 
the seller of a property you’re considering for purchase hasn’t implemented 
rent increases when due. Even more common is the failure of landlords and 
their property managers to correctly calculate and collect the common area 
maintenance charges or ancillary fees and reimbursements due from the tenant 
(see Chapter 12). Of course, you may also find that the landlords are actually 
overcharging the tenants, and thus you never want to purchase a property 
relying on phantom income that you don’t have the legal right to collect.
Understanding the Economic Principles 
of Property Valuation
Knowing certain economic principles can be useful when seeking to evalu-
ate the current and future value of potential real estate investments. In this 
section, we supply you with some background information to help you deter-
mine which properties are likely to have strong demand.
Have you ever traveled to a foreign country and observed miles of beautiful 
coastline that you know would be worth a fortune at home? A few years ago, 
Robert returned from Costa Rica, where he saw dozens of faded “For Sale” 
signs on mile after mile of unimproved oceanfront property with spectacular 
water views. Local folks told him that these properties rarely sell and are 
available at low prices. The weather is humid but not much different than 
similar weather along the Florida coast, where property is expensive. So what 
are the factors behind such wide disparities in pricing and value?

174
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Well, you need to consider several important economic principles when 
evaluating the potential value of a property. The basis of value for any piece 
of real estate is grounded in the following four concepts:
 
✓ Demand: The need or desire for possession or ownership backed by the 
financial means to satisfy that need.
 
✓ Utility: The property’s ability to satisfy its intended purpose. For exam-
ple, a very inaccessible location isn’t suitable for a retail property.
 
✓ Scarcity: Similar properties are finite, and substitution doesn’t indicate 
that other properties can meet the same needs. Substitution is the idea 
that an investor won’t pay more for a property than the price of another, 
similar property.
 
✓ Transferability: The relative ease with which ownership rights are trans-
ferred from one owner to another.
In the earlier example, the oceanfront land in Costa Rica wasn’t in high 
demand, was relatively inaccessible (the closet major airport was in the 
capital city of San Jose — nearly 100 miles away), the availability of so many 
similar properties made the scarcity a nonissue, and the complications of 
the government requirements for foreign ownership may limit the ability to 
transfer the property to non–Costa Ricans.
An understanding of the current value and future potential of real estate 
investments is based on these four concepts. But three other important eco-
nomic principles can affect the value of real estate now and in the future:
 
✓ Regression: A property’s value is negatively impacted by surrounding 
properties that are inferior, of lower value, or in worse condition. In 
other words, don’t buy the best property in a bad neighborhood.
 
✓ Progression: A property’s value is positively impacted by surround-
ing properties that are superior, in better condition, and have a higher 
value.
 
 This concept is one of the most important for the real estate investor 
looking for long-term success. Seek a well-built but neglected and 
poorly maintained property located in a good neighborhood. You then 
add significant value by repositioning the property up to the level of 
the surrounding properties through proper maintenance, repairs, and 
upgrades.
 
✓ Conformity: Property values are optimized when a property generally 
conforms to the surrounding properties, and negatively impacted when 
it doesn’t. Higher or optimized value through conformity is what you’re 
seeking when you purchase the distressed property and renovate it to 
enhance its appearance and utility. This is also the economic principle 
that cautions against overimproving the property.

175
 Chapter 11: Understanding Leases and Property Valuation
Determining highest and best use
All of these economic principles are based on the premise that the maximum 
value of real estate is achieved when a property is being utilized in its highest 
and best use. Highest and best use is the fundamental concept that there is 
one single use that results in the maximum profitability by the best and most 
efficient use of the property. (This concept focuses solely on financial issues. 
For example, it says nothing about the impact that a significant, dense prop-
erty development has on traffic and the local environment.)
The highest and best use of a specific property doesn’t remain constant over 
time. Zoning of a property can eliminate certain possible uses of a property 
at the time of evaluation. However, particularly for properties in the path 
of progress, time can create new opportunities. For example, agricultural 
land in the middle of a rapidly expanding commercial and resort area isn’t 
the highest and best use (financially speaking) of the property. (Check out 
Chapter 10 for more on zoning issues.)
This was the case for the strawberry fields that bordered the west side of 
Disneyland in Anaheim for several decades. The long-time owner of the prop-
erty wasn’t interested in selling at any price, so the property wasn’t utilized 
to its highest and best use. However, after the owner passed away, his heirs 
quickly sold the property, and the Disney resort developed the property.
Comparing fair market value 
and investment value
When discussing real estate values, most people immediately think of fair 
market value — basically, the price that the buyer and seller can agree to 
for a real estate transaction. Determining the fair market value of real estate 
often seems like an elusive concept much like the old adage “Beauty is in the 
eye of the beholder.”
A bit more specifically, the fair market value is the most likely price a buyer 
is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept for a property at a given time. 
This definition is based on three assumptions:
 
✓ The market for similar real estate is open and competitive.
 
✓ The buyer and seller are both motivated, acting prudently and with 
knowledge.
 
✓ The buyer and seller aren’t under any undue influence or affected by 
unusual circumstances.

176
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
However, real estate investors encounter another type of value — investment 
value. Although the market value is the value of a property to a typical inves-
tor, investment value is its value to a specific investor based on his particular 
requirements, such as the cost of capital, tax rate, or personal goals.
Someday, you may find yourself competing against another buyer for a prime 
investment property only to be surprised that she seems willing to pay much 
more. If you’ve carefully analyzed the property, and the seller provided the 
same information about the property to all potential purchasers, the other 
buyer is likely basing her offer on the property’s investment value to her.
Maybe the other buyer needs a replacement property for a 1031 exchange 
and has the strong motivation of potentially losing the deferral of significant 
capital gains unless she buys property of equal or greater value within cer-
tain defined time periods (see Chapter 18). Such buyers are often willing to 
pay a premium for a property to avoid losing the tax deferral benefits avail-
able under federal and many state tax codes.
 
You don’t want to get into a bidding war for a property and overpay, so 
remember that market value and investment value are two different concepts. 
Investment value can be higher or lower than market value. For example, an 
investor who can’t use the tax benefits of depreciation would be willing to pay 
less for a property that would generate large annual depreciation than would 
an investor that has other passive income and can use the deferral of taxation 
to reduce his current income tax obligations.
Reviewing the Sources of 
Property-Valuing Information
As a prospective buyer, you may find that quite a few folks have an idea of 
what a piece of property is worth:
 
✓ Professional appraisers: Owners and lenders hire these property valu-
ation specialists to formulate the value of a property at a given point in 
time. Sellers rarely consult appraisers unless the sale is the result of liti-
gation or probate, or a government entity is the buyer or seller.
 
✓ Brokers and agents: A Competitive Market Analysis (CMA) or a Broker 
Price Opinion (BPO-V) is an estimate of market value that is gener-
ally available from brokers or agents active in the local area where the 
property is located. Some lenders also use the term Broker Opinion of 
Value (BOV). Because brokers and agents routinely track the listing and 
sale of comparable properties, they offer this information to owners 
with the goal of getting a listing on the property. Their valuation may be 
fair and reasonable; however, a buyer should remember that the real 

177
 Chapter 11: Understanding Leases and Property Valuation
estate agent isn’t a disinterested third party, but rather only paid if he’s 
involved in a sales transaction — and then he’s compensated more for a 
higher sales price.
 
✓ Sellers: Many sellers also do their own informal or anecdotal research 
by obtaining information about recent sales of properties they know in 
the area. Ultimately, the seller must make the final critical decision as 
to the asking price for a property. Because the valuation of real estate 
has many variables, inefficiencies in the pricing of income properties 
are common.
As a prospective buyer, the values these folks come up with are merely start-
ing points for your analysis. Much more research is required. We spend the 
balance of this chapter, and Chapter 12, helping you do your research.
 
Many real estate investors find that becoming real estate appraisers can be 
helpful to their success in investing in real estate. You may want to get a certi-
fication in real estate appraisal while making your real estate investments. 
Another benefit of this choice is that you qualify for the favorable tax treat-
ments offered to real estate professionals (as described further in Chapter 18). 
Or you may just want to have a better understanding of the techniques used 
by appraisers for evaluating your own properties. For more information on 
professional appraisers and their education and training, please refer to www.
appraisalfoundation.org or www.appraisalinstitute.org.
Establishing Value Benchmarks
The proper analysis of real estate requires due diligence and research, 
which starts with evaluating the existing leases (see the “The Importance 
of Evaluating a Lease” section earlier in this chapter) and continues with 
crunching the numbers (see Chapter 12). However, almost more than any 
other investment, the real estate industry has relied for years on value 
benchmarks to set prices and evaluate potential purchases.
One of the reasons value benchmarks are so widely used is that they can 
easily be calculated by using basic information available on a property. 
Virtually all properties you encounter for sale include this information in the 
listing brochures or offering packages provided by sellers or their brokers or 
sales agents.
 
These value benchmarks are general guidelines only, and they can be mislead-
ing, especially to the novice real estate investor. When you first hear them, 
they sound impressive, but they’re only quick and simple indicators of value. 
Don’t make investment decisions without calculating the Net Operating Income 
(NOI) (which we cover in detail in Chapter 10). The measures in this section 
shouldn’t be the sole basis for the purchase of income-producing real estate.

178
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Some professional appraisers may perform these calculations as a verifica-
tion test to ensure that their results are in the ballpark and even include 
them in their appraisal. However, these numbers aren’t as accurate at indi-
cating value as the traditional methods of appraising the value of real estate 
(the cost approach, market approach, and income capitalization approach 
discussed in Chapter 12). Neither are they formally recognized and man-
dated by the professional appraisal institutes or federal lending guidelines as 
approved methods of appraising real estate.
In the following sections, we cover the standard value benchmarks that apply 
to all types of real estate, as well as some that are unique to a specific sector.
Gross rent/income multiplier
Two important value benchmarks include
 
✓ Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM): GRM is most commonly used for resi-
dential income properties, such as single-family rental homes and small 
apartment buildings, because virtually all of their income is in the form 
of rent payments from tenants.
 
✓ Gross Income Multiplier (GIM): GIM includes rent plus all other sources 
of income and therefore is more widely used to quickly evaluate com-
mercial or industrial real estate investments.
The monthly rent or income is used in some areas of the country, but typi-
cally the GRM and GIM are calculated by using annual numbers. Both the 
GRM and GIM are calculated by dividing the proposed acquisition price by 
the annual rent or total income. For example, the GRM for a rental home that 
can be acquired for $100,000 with a monthly rent of $750 ($9,000 annualized):
  
GRM =
Proposed acquisition price
Annual rent
=
$100,000
= 11.1
$9,000
Likewise, an industrial building that sells for $250,000 with an annual gross 
income of $20,000 has a GIM of 12.5.
 
These formulas require little information and are a simple way to quickly com-
pare similar properties. Savvy real estate investors glance at the GRM or GIM 
on a listing sheet and may either eliminate some properties from or earmark 

179
 Chapter 11: Understanding Leases and Property Valuation
them for further consideration, but they don’t write an offer to purchase just 
because the ratio seems attractive. Experienced investors know that much 
more analysis is needed because these formulas don’t consider future appre-
ciation, financial leverage, the risk of the investment, or operating expenses. 
They focus on gross income only, which can be deceptive.
Here’s how relying on these formulas can be tricky: If the GRM and GIM ratios 
seem high, you need to check further to see whether the price is too high — 
in which case you should pass on this property. Or maybe the rents are below 
market value and the price is reasonable. Conversely, you may see a low GRM 
and think that you found your next investment prospect only to discover that 
the property is really overpriced because the seller has projected unrealistic 
rents based on seasonal rentals for dilapidated furnished studio apartments in 
a beach community.
Because both GRM and GIM only consider the income side of the investment, 
these formulas don’t differentiate between the operating and capital expense 
levels of each property. The income is important, but what you’re left with 
after paying the expenses makes your mortgage payment and provides 
you with cash flow. As we discuss in Chapter 12, the operating and capital 
expense levels can make a tremendous difference in the overall cash flow and 
the value of the property.
For example, compare two small apartment communities — both available 
for $1 million and each with an annual gross income of $100,000. On each, 
the GRM is 10. But which is the better investment? The GRM doesn’t give any 
indication, but further analysis gives you the answer because expenses for 
each property probably differ.
One apartment building is over 40 years old and has only month-to-month 
rental agreements with a high turnover of tenants. The property has interior 
hallways, is poorly maintained, and has an elevator that has never been mod-
ernized. This property suffers from above-average annual operating expenses 
of $85,000. The other potential investment is also an older property but 
caters to seniors on long-term leases who rarely move and do little damage. 
The building is a two-story, garden-style walk-up with annual expenses of 
$45,000. Clearly, assuming you use the same financing for each property, the 
second property (with $40,000 less in expenses) should result in greater cash 
flow to the owner.
Price per unit and square foot
For apartment investors, the asking price per unit can provide a general feel 
for the reasonableness of the seller’s pricing. Price per unit is calculated by 
simply dividing the asking price by the number of units. For example, a six-
unit building priced at $240,000 works out to $40,000 per unit.

180
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Like the GRM calculation, the price per unit does have its limitations. The cal-
culation doesn’t account for the location or age of the property, the quality 
of construction or amenities, or the unit size and condition. You should only 
use it as a quick indicator of relative value when comparing similar proper-
ties in the same market area.
The price per square foot is a widely used yet simple calculation most often 
associated with commercial, industrial, and retail properties (and sometimes 
used for residential properties). To find this number, take the asking or sales 
price of a property and divide it by the square footage of the buildings. It’s 
only a ballpark gauge of relative value and can be limited because it doesn’t 
factor in the location or quality of the improvements or other important 
issues like the parking ratio or the occupancy level and rent collections.
For example, a 5,000-square-foot building going for $250,000 may seem 
like a good value at $50 per square foot in your market until you find that 
it hasn’t been occupied for years and is in a distressed area of town. Or a 
10,000-square-foot building for $1.25 million may seem overpriced at $125 
per square foot until you discover that the U.S. Postal Service just signed 
a 20-year net lease at full market rent with generous annual cost-of-living 
increases.
Replacement cost
Replacement cost is another factor that real estate investors should consider 
prior to making a real estate investment. The replacement cost is the current 
cost to construct a comparable property that serves the same purpose or 
function as the original property. The calculation of replacement cost is usu-
ally done by comparing the price per square foot to an estimate of the cost 
per square foot to build a similar new property, including the cost of the land.
 
If you buy an investment property below its replacement cost, you can gen-
erally know that a prudent builder probably won’t construct a similar new 
product. This fact minimizes the chance that overbuilding will result in excess 
supply. It isn’t until resale value (minus depreciation) of existing properties 
equals the cost to construct new properties that a builder will find it finan-
cially feasible to build an additional product.
Especially when considering investing in a real estate market that seems 
overpriced, avoid buying investment properties where the cost for new con-
struction is equal to or lower than the replacement cost of a similar building. 
When prices rise to the point that it’s more economical to build a new prod-
uct rather than buy existing investment properties, builders know that they 
can build an additional product and sell it at a profit. And you then have addi-
tional properties to compete with.

W
ith the help of your real estate team, you need to narrow your real 
estate investment opportunities down to just those properties that 
seem to have the best chance to produce financially in the long run. In 
Chapter 11, we cover the basics of property valuation and provide you with 
the information you need to examine the leases of prospective properties.
In this chapter, we get down to the business of running the numbers. We 
cover the essential elements of understanding and arriving at a property’s 
income and expenses and Net Operating Income — and we explain what that 
is! We then take these important numbers a step further and show you the 
best valuation tools traditionally used by appraisers and commonly used by 
lenders to determine what a property is worth.
But after you’ve done all of your research and analysis, the reality is that 
you still need to establish whether a proposed property has the potential to 
be a good investment opportunity. Overpaying for a good property isn’t any 
better than getting a deal on a bad property. Neither will meet your goals. So 
we close the chapter by putting it all together to help you decide how much 
you should consider paying.

182
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Understanding the Importance 
of Return on Investment
 
The purchase of an investment property is really the purchase of a future 
income stream or cash flow. Although pride of ownership or the satisfaction of 
being the owner of a rental property may be an important issue for some 
people, most real estate investors focus primarily on the investment returns 
that they can generate from a given property.
Four elements determine the return you see on your investment:
 
✓ Net cash flow: Net cash flow is money generated by the property 
after deducting all costs and debt service from the income. See the 
“Calculating Cash Flow” section later in this chapter.
 
✓ Tax benefits of depreciation: Many investors are able to use these tax 
benefits to shelter other sources of income (we cover this subject in 
Chapter 18).
 
✓ Buildup of equity: If you acquired the property with debt, the equity 
buildup from paying down the debt over time is a factor.
 
✓ Appreciation: True wealth is created through appreciation (buying prop-
erty and selling it years later for much more than you paid). Significant 
estates and generational wealth are created through appreciation.
 
The key to generating a profitable real estate portfolio is finding and purchas-
ing properties that exhibit the potential for high occupancy and growth in 
income while keeping expenses and turnover reasonable. Success in real 
estate investing depends on purchasing a property for the right price so that 
you have the ability to use your management skills to increase the value over 
time. Don’t base your investment decision on emotions. Falling in love with a 
property can lead to overpaying.
You also need to determine what work needs to be done to the property to 
correct any deferred maintenance or functional obsolescence. Even if you 
simply hold the property and look for cash flow and appreciation, you want 
to be able to evaluate the holding costs during your ownership period.
Then you need to determine the future value of the property to calculate the 
likely disposition price and determine your return on investment.

183
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Figuring Net Operating Income
Knowledgeable real estate investors begin a serious analysis of a potential 
property acquisition by deriving the projected Net Operating Income, com-
monly abbreviated as NOI. We find it surprising how many real estate inves-
tors don’t make the effort to calculate the NOI before buying a property. 
Instead, the quick-and-easy nature of the benchmarks we cover in the previ-
ous chapter seduces unwitting investors into a false sense of security.
The calculation of Net Operating Income is simply
NOI = Income – Expenses
 
NOI is the most critical factor in determining the potential for return on your 
investment in real estate. Determining the NOI of a property is one of the fun-
damental building blocks to analyzing real estate investments. Any decision — 
to buy, hold, or sell — should only be made after a careful analysis of the 
actual current and projected future NOI for a given real estate investment. 
Arriving at a reasonable estimate for future NOI is the key to determining the 
value parameters for your real estate investment. We recommend that you 
value a property based on the projected NOI for the next year, or preferably 
next few years.
The current NOI is fairly easy to obtain and is often provided by the seller 
(although in the rest of this section, we explain common problems with this 
seller-provided data). Deriving the projected NOI is a more time-consuming 
and in-depth process. The forecasting of a property’s NOI is more of an art 
than a science. Many times, the estimation of NOI is based on a number of 
assumptions or projections about future events that are anything but certain. 
Will your tenants renew their leases (and at what rates)? Will the tenants 
make their rent payments and other contractual requirements as agreed in 
their leases? Will expenses stay within the expected range, or will there be 
significant world or local events that lead to a spike in costs (like the avail-
ability and cost of property insurance after the 9/11 terrorist attacks or a sig-
nificant increase in the price of oil)?
 
Whether you receive current or projected NOI estimates from a seller, be care-
ful to verify the numbers. Some sellers, and many real estate brokers and 
agents, prefer to provide a pro forma NOI (a projection of future financial per-
formance of the property) that uses higher rents and lower expenses. These 
fictitious numbers are based on the theory that the new owner will raise the 
rents to market level and simultaneously lower the costs of operating the 
property. These assumptions are rarely valid. Unless the property has leases 
that renew at higher rates or below-market leases that are expiring while the 
demand is high, you seldom find a professionally managed property with 
below-market rents. If it were that easy to increase income, wouldn’t the cur-
rent owner do it? Expenses are also unlikely to decrease significantly.

184
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Have you ever seen a projection from a seller, her broker, or her sales agent 
that projects a lower NOI for an investment property on the market? They act 
as if the only way for NOI to go is up. Although you want to invest in proper-
ties where that is the likely result, the reality is that real estate is a cyclical 
business, and supply and demand factors have a major impact.
 
“Garbage in, garbage out” holds true for your projections of your future NOI. 
Therefore, make a careful and detailed analysis of the property you’re consid-
ering. Real estate investing isn’t something you should do by the seat of your 
pants. Develop your own operating pro forma prior to purchasing any prop-
erty. And any evaluation or projection of the income stream for a property 
should begin with an analysis of each lease or rental agreement (which we 
cover in Chapter 11).
Evaluating income: Moving from 
fiction to useful figures
 
To evaluate the income side of your budget, we advise that you painstakingly 
record and verify all income by using a zero-based budget concept. A zero-
based budget is where you start with a blank piece of paper (or spreadsheet, if 
you enjoy computer software) and individually, tenant by tenant, create the 
projected rents and income stream for the property. (A similar zero-based 
budget concept is useful for determining your likely or expected expenses and 
is discussed in further detail later in the chapter.)
 
Sellers may provide or be asked to sign a certified rent roll or similar docu-
ment verifying the accuracy of the tenants and rents listed. Although this doc-
ument may be a great exhibit in your lawsuit against the seller for fraud, we 
advise that you use this document cautiously and only as a tool in developing 
your own independent analysis of the current and future rent payments due 
under the terms of the existing leases. Don’t just gather static data and num-
bers on your current tenants; you must be able to interpret the data. Evaluate 
the strength of each tenant. The lease may give you the legal right to future 
rent payments; however, a tenant who is unable or unwilling to meet his lease 
obligations won’t be good for your rental collections.
You want a property that has tenants who not only have the current financial 
strength to meet their obligations under the lease but who will also enhance 
or increase your income in future years. For example, you may determine 
that one of your commercial office building tenants will be looking to expand 
and will probably replace a tenant that is barely surviving and unlikely to 
renew their lease.

185
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
It’s truly amazing how little some commercial landlords know about the 
needs of their current tenants. Be sure to actually talk to your prospective 
tenants (in addition to getting the estoppel certificates discussed in Chapter 
11). Tenants are the key to your future success, and you want to make sure 
that you can provide the proper environment so their businesses can grow 
and prosper while you benefit from their rental payments, which ultimately 
pay for the building you plan to own free-and-clear in the future.
 
But the income side of the equation involves more than just estimating rents. 
The typical income and expense statements for reporting in real estate include 
standard terminology that all real estate investors should know:
 
✓ Gross potential income or GPI is the maximum gross income that would 
be generated from the rent if the property were at 100 percent occu-
pancy and all money owed were collected in full. (This is sometimes 
referred to as gross possible income.)
 
✓ Effective gross income or EGI is essentially the money that is actually 
collected. EGI is calculated by taking the GPI and then subtracting the 
vacancies, concessions, delinquencies, and collection losses and then 
adding the other income from late charges, returned checks, and all 
other secondary sources.
In the sections that follow, we provide the details on what to subtract and 
add to work your way from GPI to EGI.
Accounting for vacancies
The real estate investment community seems to be locked on using 5 percent 
as the vacancy factor; brokers and even lenders typically use a 5 percent 
vacancy factor without any regard for the actual market conditions. This 
number may or may not be the right number to use; we advise that you care-
fully determine the most accurate estimate of future vacancy rather than use 
a standard figure such as 5 percent.
 
The issue of vacancies is particularly applicable to many new real estate inves-
tors who begin either by retaining their current homes as investment proper-
ties when they move up to larger homes or by purchasing rental properties as 
investments. Novice investors often simply compare the monthly rental rate 
that they plan on charging to the monthly costs for paying the mortgage and 
any other recurring expenses (property taxes, utilities, homeowner’s dues, 
and so on). This practice can be dangerous if you don’t have sufficient cash 
reserves for the unexpected — like being unable to find or retain tenants or 
having to evict a tenant who stops paying.

186
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
If you have a single-family rental home, the property is either occupied or 
vacant. With the average length of residential tenancies in many parts of the 
country at less than one year, using a 0 percent vacancy factor is unrealistic. 
Our suggestion for your pro forma for a single-family rental home is to antici-
pate a loss of income equivalent to one month per every 12 months, which 
reflects an 8.3 percent vacancy rate. This rate may represent a vacancy, a 
delinquency, or a concession (see the following sections), but our experience 
indicates that, one way or another, you’re likely to lose at least one month’s 
income every year, and you should allow for this prospect in preparing your 
pro forma to determine the potential income before making your investment 
decision.
Calculating concessions
A concession is any benefit or deal-sweetener offered by the landlord to 
entice the tenant to enter into a lease or rental agreement. Concessions 
can be anything of value that motivates the tenant, but most commonly 
include free or reduced rent or additional features (a ceiling fan, microwave, 
upgraded finishes, extra parking, and so on). In many areas, concessions are 
a significant factor in estimating future income. Remember that a concession 
of one month’s free rent is essentially an 8.3 percent discount of the annual 
rent. A free month’s rent for a simple residential tenancy with a monthly rent 
of $1,000 means that you’ll only collect $11,000 in the first year, or an effec-
tive rental rate of $916.66, or a concession rate of 8.3 percent. This swing is a 
significant factor when added to your expected vacancy rate and allowance 
for collection loss (see the next section).
Deducting delinquencies and collection losses
The industry standard for collection loss (rent or other charges that the land-
lord must write off as uncollectible) is typically 0.5 percent of rental income. 
This is another number that seems to be acceptable as a general rule; how-
ever, savvy real estate investors make their own analyses of the actual col-
lection loss they may experience based on the strength of the tenant, the 
strength and depth of the local job market, the average turnover of the area 
overall, the amount of security deposit they hold, and the nature of local 
tenant/landlord laws. For example, collection losses for residential proper-
ties in the Las Vegas area often exceed 2 to 4 percent, and the continued 
advent of pro-tenant legislation in California and other major metropolitan 
areas foretells increased losses to landlords because of the inability to evict 
nonpaying or disruptive tenants. In a weak economic environment, collection 
loss can be even more significant, and prudent landlords take steps to make 
sure that they have financially sound tenants who can pay rent. The competi-
tion for these qualified tenants means that you may have to lower the rent or 
offer concessions, which are better options than trying to get top dollar from 
an unqualified tenant.

187
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Adding in additional income streams
In addition to rent, other types of payments are essential elements to your 
income stream. Other income items can consist of late charges, returned 
check charges, and various ancillary income items. The ancillary items 
depend on the type of investment property, but for residential properties, 
they can consist of laundry, parking, vending, Internet services, storage, con-
cierge service, and so on. Examples for commercial properties can include 
sources similar to those for residential properties, plus items like common 
area maintenance charges (CAM), supplemental HVAC (heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning) charges, special security requirements, and telecom-
munications.
Tallying operating expenses
Just as you did with your income, use a zero-based budget concept to fore-
cast the projected operating expenses for your property. Although historical 
expenses are worth reviewing and sometimes can be quite accurate in fore-
casting future expenses, we recommend that you question every expense. 
Who knows, you may find that the current landscaper is actually willing to 
charge you less just to keep the account.
 
The income and expense information presented by most owners or their real 
estate agents doesn’t accurately reflect the current financial results. 
Inevitably, they claim that the rents are too low and they underestimate the 
operating expenses to show the maximum NOI. As the potential purchaser of 
this property, you want to deal with reality, so be sure to require the seller to 
provide you with a copy of her federal tax return Schedule E for each year of 
her ownership — or at least the last several years. Rarely does the tax return 
overstate the income or understate the expenses of a rental property — and 
you want to base your decisions on fact, not fiction.
Utilities
Evaluate your utility costs as soon as you can, because this expense is typi-
cally one of the larger costs of operating your property and is also subject to 
significant increases. Determine the current and projected rates for the utili-
ties by contacting the service providers for electricity, natural gas, water and 
sewer, telephone, cable, waste removal, and any other utilities that are pro-
vided at the property. Virtually all of these utilities are regulated locally or at 
the state level and must file future rates well in advance.
Thus, determining the future cost for utilities is relatively easy if your usage 
remains the same. But seriously consider any energy and resource efficiency 
improvements that you can make, such as lighting, low-flow toilets, auto-
mated sprinkler systems, and other ways to dramatically reduce the con-
sumption and provide incentives for your tenants to conserve.

188
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
One sure way to get tenants to conserve is to make them responsible for their 
utility usage. This approach can dramatically improve your NOI, and it’s often 
a win/win situation because many tenants make long-delayed energy-efficient 
changes to improve conservation practices. You can make these changes in a 
number of areas:
 
✓ Electric usage: Robert dramatically improved the NOI for one of his cli-
ent’s commercial office buildings by over $100,000 per year simply by 
installing separate electric meters and requiring the tenant to pay for its 
own electricity. The significant improvement in NOI occurred even after 
the tenant was given a reduction in the rental rate based on the utility 
company’s estimate of a reasonable monthly expense for electricity for 
that suite. The tenant was a food broker and had 12 large, inefficient 
freezers that helped to generate a monthly electric bill of over $15,000 — 
paid by the landlord. Surprise, surprise — when the tenant began paying 
for its own electricity, it quickly cut the number of freezers in half and 
invested in new energy-efficient models.
 
✓ Water usage: Across the country, individual water meters are being 
retrofitted for each residential tenant. An EPA-sponsored three-year 
study recently concluded that billing residents for their water usage by 
direct metering can reduce annual water consumption by an average of 
15 percent.
 
✓ Waste collection and disposal: This category is quickly becoming the 
next major cost item that landlords are passing on to tenants because 
these costs are rising rapidly in most areas of the country.
 
We recommend you limit your investments to those residential buildings with 
separate meters for water, sewer, and electricity (see the “Surveying Lease 
Options that Affect Your Cost” section later in the chapter).
Management fees
A common mistake made by many investors is failing to incorporate the value 
of their time if they self-manage their property. Your estimate of operating 
costs should include a management fee even if you self-manage. Your time is 
worth something, and there is an opportunity cost (whatever other productive 
activity you could be doing with that time) as well. Also, you may decide in 
the future to hire a property manager so that you can focus on the acquisition, 
improvement, and disposition of your real estate holdings. Including a compa-
rable management fee now saves your projections from taking a hit later. See 
Chapter 15 for more on hiring a property management firm.

189
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Insurance
Like utilities, property-casualty insurance is another major operating expense 
for which you need to get a specific quote for future projections instead of 
relying on historical data provided by the seller. Insurance coverage and 
rates can vary widely from one insurance company to another and there are 
also many opportunities to benefit from package or volume purchases of 
insurance. See Chapter 16 for the scoop on risk management.
Other operating costs
Don’t forget all of the other operating costs for your property, including your 
outside vendors that provide services. You may have landscaping, pest con-
trol, parking lot sweeping, cleaning and janitorial, and other services. Contact 
each firm for pricing — and put these services out for competitive bids when 
you feel that the pricing and services offered aren’t the best values.
Be sure to get current bids for all of the other expenses of owning and main-
taining your property. For maintenance, you can look at historic numbers, 
but you want to keep the age and condition of the building in mind when set-
ting your budget for upkeep.
 
Almost every real estate investor at some point considers purchasing a prop-
erty that the seller claims has been fully renovated. The seller implies that the 
required maintenance expenditures are nominal and your expenses will be 
lower. Our experience is that even properties that have been recently reno-
vated still have ongoing maintenance needs. Don’t cut back on, or fail to allow 
sufficient funds for, ongoing maintenance and repairs when you crunch the 
numbers.
Calculating Cash Flow
As you begin to look at various properties that you may want to acquire, 
you discover that the real estate investment community always refers to the 
NOI of a given property and commonly uses that number to set the value or 
asking price of a property. The NOI is the number that tells you what you can 
afford to pay for the property. We show you the calculations in the “Figuring 
Net Operating Income” section earlier in this chapter.
 
However, don’t confuse the NOI with cash flow, which is NOI minus debt ser-
vice and capital expenditures. In the example in Table 12-1, the Net Operating 
Income is $600,000, but the actual cash flow before taxes to the investor is 
$150,000.

After you have your NOI, you can project your annual cash flow. The formula 
is straightforward:
NOI – Debt Service – Capital Improvements = Pretax Cash Flow
Servicing debt
The broker information sheet (or sales flyer) on an available property may 
provide proposed financing. However, make sure that the debt service projec-
tion in your income and expense pro forma relies on a firm financing commit-
ment that you have received.
 
Although the annual debt-service payments are a direct result of the amount 
of the purchase price borrowed, for most conventionally financed properties, 
the debt service will be 80 to 90 percent of the NOI. If you have fixed-rate 
financing, the debt service is going to be an easy number to plug into your 
income and expense pro forma.
Making capital improvements
In developing their estimates or pro formas of projected financial results for 
a proposed investment property, many investors neglect to account for, or 
seriously underestimate the need for, capital improvements to the property. 
Capital improvements are the replacement of major building components or 
systems such as the roof, driveways, HVAC, windows, appliances, elevators, 
and floor coverings. Real estate investing requires planning and the alloca-
tion of funds to protect and preserve the asset in the long run.

191
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Often sellers indicate that the property had been fully renovated and imply 
that the purchaser won’t incur any capital improvements for many years to 
come. But buildings age and things break — especially in rental properties. 
Just as homeowner’s associations often are wise to put aside funds each year 
in a reserve account for capital improvements, you should allocate a portion 
of your income to reflect the fact that certain components of your property 
are deteriorating over time and will need to be replaced. Otherwise, you may 
find that your roof needs to be replaced and you don’t have the funds to 
cover the expense.
 
Capital improvements are also an essential component of the repositioning or 
renovation plans that lead to improved financial performance for investment 
real estate. As an investor, always look for those properties that owners have 
neglected to properly maintain and upgrade. This category is one of the best 
target markets for investing, and your pro forma income and expenses should 
contain a realistic capital improvement budget.
Your due diligence should include a detailed walk-through of the property by 
a qualified contractor who can identify health and safety issues that should 
be addressed immediately — either during escrow by the seller or by you 
as the new owner. A leasing broker or someone knowledgeable about the 
competitive properties in the market should then compile a prioritized list of 
needed work and cost-effective upgrades that will position your property to 
outperform the rental market.
This important feedback should be documented with written summaries by 
suite or unit number, plus a detailed evaluation of all common areas to bring 
the property into consistency with your overall marketing plan. Then contact 
the appropriate suppliers and contractors to formulate a capital improve-
ments budget by month or year.
 
Even with the most diligent walk-throughs and cost estimates, the reality of 
property renovation and repositioning is that the costs always exceed your 
expectations and the timelines are rarely met.
The capital improvements or reserves for replacement vary based on the 
age, location, and condition of the property, as well as the tenant profile. 
The higher the turnover of tenants (and the less money the prior owner has 
invested in properly maintaining the property over the years), the higher the 
capital expenses. A location impacted by climatic conditions can also be a 
significant factor in the life span of building components. Properties located 
in a marine climate require more frequent painting and replacement of items 
affected by moisture and corrosion.
 
Capital expenses are subjective. Our advice is to be conservative and esti-
mate toward the high side of a range. If you don’t have to spend the funds, 
your real estate investment results are enhanced. But you don’t want to plan

maintenance is more costly to address in the future, plus it ultimately nega-
tively impacts on your income if your property doesn’t attract financially 
strong and stable tenants.
Surveying Lease Options 
that Affect Your Cost
Leases for rental properties come in three basic forms:
 
✓ Gross lease: In a gross lease, the landlord pays for almost all of the oper-
ating expenses of the property.
 
✓ Modified gross lease: Modified gross leases pass some of the expenses of 
owning and operating the building directly to the tenants. Examples of 
modified gross leases include leases where the landlord pays all operat-
ing expenses except for certain items such as utilities, parking, or janito-
rial expenses.
 
✓ Net lease: The term net lease can have an unlimited range of variables 
but typically provides for the tenant to pay for the majority of the costs 
of operating the building, including property taxes, insurance, and main-
tenance costs. Those leases in which the tenant pays virtually all costs 
associated with operating the building are called triple net leases.
You shouldn’t include the cost of any tenant-paid services as an expense of 
the property. The leases for a commercial property can be gross leases, mod-
ified gross leases, or net leases, but residential properties are almost always 
leased on a gross basis, except utilities.
Comparing some of the options
There are different thoughts about which type of lease is best. Many investors 
believe that net leases reduce the owner’s management of the property, but 
this assumption isn’t necessarily true. The owner must still ensure that the 
property is properly maintained. One argument against net leases is that the 
tenant may skimp on the maintenance of the property, which is why you typi-
cally don’t see net leases in residential properties. Can you imagine a residen-
tial tenant being responsible for all of the maintenance of his rental home?
 
We find that modified gross leases in which the tenant pays for expenses that 
she can control are a good balance for all types of properties. The following 
shows essentially how the relationship is structured in most apartment 
buildings:

193
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
 
✓ The landlord retains control of the property maintenance and makes 
the necessary repairs and upgrades inside and out to ensure the long-
term integrity of the building instead of allowing it to be compromised 
by thrifty tenants. The landlord is also able to ensure that the assessed 
value is kept low and the property taxes are paid on time, plus make 
sure that proper insurance coverage is in place.
 
✓ However, the landlord doesn’t control certain expenses that are better 
suited to be paid directly by the tenant. For example, tenants have a 
direct impact on the utility usage and are more careful to conserve if 
they pay that expense. This is why we recommend you limit your invest-
ments in residential property to those buildings with separate meters 
for water, sewer, and electricity. Likewise, some commercial tenants can 
live with weekly janitorial service rather than daily if they’re paying the 
cost directly.
As the potential purchaser of a commercial property, carefully evaluate the 
leases and determine what operating expenses, if any, are paid by the ten-
ants. You need to understand whether the property is using gross or net 
leases. Otherwise, you may be deceived regarding the actual NOI and cash 
flow that you will receive for the property.
Clearly, the rent charged for commercial properties with net leases, where 
the tenants are directly responsible for making the property tax and insur-
ance payments and where they handle their own maintenance, will be lower 
than a similar property with a gross lease. But the end result may be similar 
because the higher rents received on the gross lease property will go toward 
those same expenses and costs that the tenant is paying at the net leased 
property.
Accounting for common area maintenance 
charges for commercial buildings
Costs in multitenant commercial buildings that are passed on to the tenant 
are called common area maintenance charges or CAM charges. Paid propor-
tionately by each tenant for the upkeep of areas designated for the use and 
benefit of all tenants, CAM charges include items such as parking lot main-
tenance, security, snow removal, and common area utilities. These charges 
are part of the tenant’s rent and can be due in advance or paid in arrears; 
the lease establishes the terms. Some tenants negotiate that they don’t have 
CAM charges. For accounting purposes, CAM charges are typically reflected 
in the cash flow as “CAM reimbursement” (see Table 12-1). Although they’re 
indicated as an income item, they’re essentially offsetting the corresponding 
expense items included in the operating expenses for the property.

194
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
The most common method is to use an estimated annual budget for the 
property as a basis for the collection of a monthly CAM charge. At the end of 
a previously agreed upon time period (usually annually), you calculate the 
actual expenses incurred for the common area items and reconciled against 
the amount actually paid by the tenants, billing the tenants for any shortfall 
or refunding any excess payments.
 
Handle the CAM reconciliation as soon as possible after the accounting is com-
plete for the relevant time period in order to quickly collect any funds due, as 
well as to provide feedback in case the future estimates need modification.
Visiting the Three Basic 
Approaches to Value
Professional real estate appraisers traditionally use three basic valuation 
techniques to arrive at an accurate estimate of current value: the market data 
(or sales comparison) approach, the cost approach, and the income capital-
ization approach.
Typically, each valuation method arrives at a slightly different estimate of 
value, and the appraiser reconciles or weighs the different results based on 
the applicability or reliability in determining the final estimate of value. The 
appraiser’s derived estimate of value may be greater or lower than the price 
a particular investor is willing to pay — the investment value. But lenders 
require appraisals to protect their position and show that the property has 
sufficient equity so that if they’re suddenly forced to foreclose and sell, they’re 
less likely to suffer a loss. In the following sections, we guide you through each 
process and then show you how to reconcile the different results.
Market data (sales comparison) approach
The market data or sales comparison approach takes the economic concept 
of substitution and applies it to real estate. In real estate, the substitution prin-
ciple essentially states that the value of a given property should be approxi-
mately the same as a similar or comparable property that provides the same 
benefits. This method is very much like what you may do yourself when 
purchasing a major item for your home — you compare similar items at vari-
ous stores to assist you in determining what price to pay. Likewise, you don’t 
want to pay more for one property than a similar property would cost.
You’ve seen this concept at work in housing tracts in your area. When you 
see two similar homes built by the same builder at the same time on com-
parable lots, you expect them to sell for approximately the same price. (Of 

195
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
course, no two homes are identical, and adjustments in the price may need to 
be made for deferred maintenance, upgrades, terms of sale, and the specific 
supply and demand at the time of the proposed sale.)
 
The accuracy of the market data approach relies on a sufficient number of 
recent sales of comparable properties. This approach to valuation is primarily 
used for single-family homes, condos, and small apartment buildings because 
they’re typically more plentiful and offer many recent sales.
If there is a shortage of completed sales, an appraiser may look at current 
listings and pending sales, but they typically discount such potential transac-
tions because they’re not finalized transactions, and many things can happen 
before the sale.
Typically, appraisers look for at least three comparable properties in close 
proximity to the subject property. Of course, the usage and type of real 
estate should be the same and a good comp is similar in age, size, amenities, 
and condition of the property. The timing of the sale is also important.
Appraisers strive to find several comparable properties, but the reality is that 
every property is unique, and there are no truly comparable sales or listings. So 
appraisers need to make either positive or negative adjustments to account for 
the differences. They then factor all of these variances into an adjustment to 
the price then calculate an indicated value for the subject property.
For example, you want to buy a duplex (that you can rent as an investment 
property) in your own neighborhood. You see one listed for $205,000 that 
is 2,500 square feet with two three-bedroom, two-bath units that are 1,250 
square feet each. The property is about ten years old, in good condition, and 
has a great location on a corner lot. Using the market data approach, you 
contact a local broker and gather the recent sales data for comparable prop-
erties sold on the open market in your neighborhood. Table 12-2 contains the 
information you’ve collected for recent sales of duplexes.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Because each property is different, you need to make some adjustments 
to formulate a price for the proposed property. The adjustments are made 
for items or features that typical buyers and sellers in that area feel have a 
material impact on value either positively or negatively. For example, in the 
Phoenix area, a rental home with a swimming pool is more desirable than one 
without, and property condition and corner lots tend to be important in all 
markets.
After researching the local market to figure out what factors are important to 
buyers and sellers, you determine that adjustments should be made for the 
subject property based on its age, location on a corner lot, its condition, and 
the fact that it offers a swimming pool (see Table 12-3).
 
✓ Property A is comparable in age to the subject property but is clearly 
inferior — it doesn’t have the corner lot or the swimming pool and 
is only in fair condition. The property sold ten months ago, and your 
research shows that prices for comparable properties in the neighbor-
hood have risen 5 to 6 percent over the last year. So overall, you expect 
that if this property was being sold today in good condition, and had the 
corner lot and the swimming pool, it would’ve sold for approximately 
$30,000 more than the actual sale ten months ago, or an adjusted sales 
price of $200,000. You made adjustments for the corner lot ($5,000), con-
dition ($5,000), the swimming pool ($15,000), and market timing ($5,000) 
for a total of $30,000 in adjustments to bring the property in line for 
comparison to the subject property.
 
✓ Property B is a little older, but because it’s been well-maintained and is 
in good condition, no adjustment is necessary for that factor. It’s also on 
a corner lot and sold just last month, so no adjustments are necessary 
for these factors. However, it doesn’t have a swimming pool, which you 
have determined is worth at least $15,000 in value. With the swimming 
pool, this property would have likely sold now for $215,000.
 
✓ Property C is brand new, has a swimming pool, and sold within the last 
two months. The only disadvantage when compared to your proposed 
investment is this property’s location in the middle of the block. Overall, 
your research indicates that the price difference for brand-new proper-
ties is $15,000 higher than a ten-year old property like the subject prop-
erty. But comparable properties located in the middle of the block sell 
for $5,000 less. Therefore, you need to adjust the Property C price lower 
by $15,000 for age and higher by $5,000 for the inferior location, which 
is a net downward adjustment of $10,000 and leads you to an adjusted 
value of $210,000.
In reviewing the results of your analysis and adjustments in Table 12-3, 
you feel that the asking price is right in line with (if not slightly below) the 
current market price for comparable properties in the neighborhood. You 
decide that you have a good investment if you can purchase the property for 
$205,000 or less.

Cost approach
The cost approach to real estate valuation is a variation on the market data 
approach that’s useful when you don’t have a lot of comparable sales data. It’s 
more commonly used, and even the preferred method, for proposed construc-
tion, brand-new properties, and unique properties that typically don’t generate 
an income (including schools, hospitals, public buildings, or places of worship).
 
Real estate investors find that this method can be useful for establishing 
replacement cost. As we cover in Chapter 11, the replacement cost of a prop-
erty can often be an indicator of barriers to entry that exist in the market. 
Owning real estate in high demand with high barriers to entry for competing 
properties is one of the best ways to ensure the success of your real estate 
investments.
In determining valuation with the cost approach, evaluate each segment — 
the land and the improvements (buildings) — separately. Here are the steps 
an appraiser follows in applying the cost approach:
 
1. Estimate the value of the land if vacant and being used in its highest 
and best use (see Chapter 11).
 
 The appraiser looks for sales of comparable vacant land in the area.
 
2. Estimate the current cost to reproduce the existing building as new, 
before depreciation.
 
3. Estimate all forms of accrued depreciation and deduct that amount 
from the calculation in Step 2 to arrive at the approximate cost to 
reproduce the building in its current condition.
 
 Accrued depreciation can be caused by three sources:
 
• Physical deterioration: Normal wear and tear that occurs from 
use over time. For example, a 12-year-old roof that can normally be 
expected to last 20 years.
 
• Functional obsolescence: Decline in the usefulness of a property 
due to changes in preferences by consumers. For example, a rental 
home with three bedrooms and only one bathroom.

198
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
• External obsolescence: Loss in value resulting from external forces. 
For example, the major employer in town closes down the factory 
and the closest comparable jobs are in a city 25 miles away.
 
4. Combine the value of the land and the value of the depreciated 
improvements to arrive at the total value of the property.
Using the duplex example from the previous section, you determine that the 
cost of a comparable vacant lot would be $40,000. Checking with local build-
ers in your market indicates that the cost to build a new property would be 
$80 per square foot; however, because the building is ten years old, there 
is some wear and tear. You therefore estimate that the cost to rebuild the 
property in its current condition is $70 per square foot (this isn’t an exact sci-
ence). The property is 2,500 square feet, so the total value of the depreciated 
improvements is $175,000.
Adding the land value of $40,000 to the $175,000 value for the depreciated 
improvements gives an overall value of the property of $215,000 under the 
cost method of valuation.
Income capitalization approach
 
This method of valuation is primarily used for larger income-producing prop-
erties but can be useful for small income properties as well. (It’s not used for 
valuing owner-occupied properties or properties whose primary purpose isn’t 
income producing.)
The income capitalization method is based on the principle that the greater 
the income generated, the more an investor is willing and able to pay for the 
property.
Our discussion of the income capitalization approach to valuation must start 
with the fundamental building block of determining value for this method — 
the direct capitalization or IRV formula. Here are the players in this formula:
 
✓ Value (V): With this method, you’re looking to determine the value of 
a given property by examining the relationship between Net Operating 
Income (NOI) and the capitalization rate (R).
 
✓ Net operating income (NOI): Yes, it’s back. Check out the “Figuring Net 
Operating Income” section earlier in this chapter to determine this piece 
of the puzzle.
 
✓ Capitalization rate (R): Also called the cap rate and overall rate, this 
number is based on the market or the buyer’s objectives. It’s the rate of 
return most investors seek for similar properties in a similar market at a 
given time.

199
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Put it all into equation form and you get
  
V (value) =
NOI (Net operating income)
R (Capitalization rate)
To illustrate, take the example of the proposed acquisition of a duplex in 
your neighborhood. The seller provides you with financial information on the 
property for the past two years and after a careful analysis, using the tech-
niques discussed earlier in this chapter, you determine that the projected 
NOI for this property in the next 12 months is $19,500 per year.
Based on discussions with real estate brokers and your local county asses-
sor, an analysis of recent comparable sales indicates that conventional sales 
of similar properties in the same area have sold for a cap rate of 10 percent.
  
V =
NOI
R
=
= $195,000
$19,500
.10
Therefore, you calculate the as-is value of this property at $195,000.
 
The cap rate can be subjective, but it’s a measure of the risk-adjusted return a 
particular investor would expect to receive if he purchased a similar property 
at a similar price. Real estate brokers and agents often have information on 
current cap rates in the local market. You can actually derive the cap rate 
yourself by examining recent sales prices for similar properties as long as you 
have reliable info on the Net Operating Income. The formula is simply
  
R (Capitalization rate) =
NOI (Net operating income)
V (value)
You can use this formula to determine the capitalization rate or investment 
performance based on a given NOI and a purchase price. If the property were 
available for $190,000, what would the rate be?
  
R =
NOI
V
=
= 10.26%

You’ve increased your return by just over a quarter percent.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
The direct capitalization method has some distinct advantages over the 
value benchmarks like the GRM or GIM (discussed in Chapter 11) because it 
includes operating expenses, but it still doesn’t objectively consider potential 
appreciation, financial leverage, or the risk of the investment. Each investor 
needs to consider these important variables or investment criteria and factor 
them into her cap rate calculations to determine the investment value of a 
given property. For example, properties with high appreciation potential, the 
ability to use positive leverage to increase overall return on invested capital, 
and low risk require a lower capitalization rate or expected rate of return.
Use future NOI projections in your income capitalization calculations 
because the historic numbers aren’t relevant to your potential ownership 
except for financing. However, most lenders are sophisticated and discount 
unusually positive financial results or give you the benefit of a pro forma 
income-and-expense projection when determining the terms of your loan.
A pro forma budget is one in which the budget for next year or a given period 
of time is projected based on an analysis of the current data available for the 
building. For example, the historic operating reports for a commercial office 
building don’t include the new lease with a major anchor tenant, but a pro 
forma operating budget does.
Games sellers play to inflate NOI
The NOI used in the IRV calculation should be 
the projected Net Operating Income. However, 
sellers often price the property based on the 
historic or most recent NOI for the past 12 
months because they can support that number 
with their financial records. As a buyer, you 
should be aware that some sellers plan the sale 
of their property only after operating it in a soon-
to-be-for-sale mode for at least 12 months — 
making sure that they maximize income and 
minimize operating expenses. Although maxi-
mizing the NOI is common sense and something 
that all owners should do all the time, some 
owners can be very sneaky about the numbers 
they report in the period before they make the 
property available for sale. For example, they 
may defer income or collect lump sum pay-
ments that artificially inflate the income; they 
may make considerable improvements to the 
physical aspects of the property so they can 
defer normal ongoing maintenance and report 
abnormally low operating expenses for the 12 
months leading up to the sale. Or they may claim 
that many of the normal operating expenses of 
the property are capital items and not part of 
the NOI calculation.
Our advice is to use the zero-based budget 
method of projecting the income and operating 
expenses to arrive at a realistic NOI for your first 
year of ownership. Developing your own num-
bers minimizes the possibility that you will make 
your investment decision on artificial numbers. 
And don’t stop with the NOI. Especially if the 
property operations have been manipulated by 
deferring maintenance and repairs, you want 
to formulate a detailed and thorough capital 
expense budget from what you observe during 
your due diligence walk-through(s). Remember 
that the only numbers you should trust are 
the ones that you have independently verified 
yourself.

201
 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Reconciling the Three Results 
to Arrive at a Single Value
An appraiser takes the numbers derived from the market data approach, the 
cost approach, and the income capitalization approach and reconciles them 
to determine a single estimate of market value at a specific time. However, 
the appraiser doesn’t simply take an average of the three estimates of value, 
because all three methods may not be equally valid or reliable for the subject 
property.
 
Rather, the reconciliation process takes into consideration the relative merits 
of each approach, with more weight given to the most applicable approach. 
For appraisals of income-producing real estate, appraisers and real estate 
investors generally rely most heavily on the income capitalization approach 
because the property is being acquired as an investment.
In the proposed investment in the example duplex, you’ve determined the 
following values:
 
✓ Market data: $205,000
 
✓ Cost: $215,000
 
✓ Income capitalization: $195,000
You’re pursuing this property as a real estate investment rather than an 
owner-occupied property, so give the most weight to the value suggested 
by the income capitalization method. The next most relevant valuation 
method is the market data approach, which indicates a value of $205,000. 
Consider the value indicated by the cost approach, but don’t give it that 
much emphasis — the building is existing and isn’t going to be rebuilt. 
Thus, by placing the most weight on the income capitalization indicated 
value of $195,000 and also factoring in the $205,000 from the market 
approach, you determine that $198,000 sounds about right for an offer.
 
You can then compare this value to the asking price for the property of 
$205,000. Although the seller may not be willing to accept an offer at $198,000, 
remember that you don’t become wealthy in real estate by paying retail for 
properties. You’re looking for a property that is available at a below-market 
price, such as a motivated seller may offer, or a property where you have the 
opportunity to add value.
Remember that the appraisal process isn’t an exact science, but the principles 
of valuation are important for real estate investors and the concepts should be 
understood. You want to be able to estimate value so you don’t overpay for a 
property. Your lender requires an appraisal to determine how much you can 
borrow. These same appraisal techniques can help you determine the appro-
priate asking price when you look to sell your real estate investment.

202
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
More sophisticated valuation techniques
Although the traditional valuation methods 
used by appraisers are important for real estate 
investors to understand, additional investment 
analysis tools used by professional real estate 
brokers and investors analyze the cash flow 
generated by a property over several years to 
estimate the value. These methods don’t take 
just a single year’s NOI and estimate value 
based on an overall capitalization rate. Rather 
they use the following methods:
 ✓ Discounted cash flow (DCF): The dis-
counted cash flow technique takes the 
annual projected cash flows for the pro-
posed investment property and uses a dis-
count rate to determine the present value. 
This method acknowledges the concept of 
time value of money, or that cash received 
in the future isn’t necessarily as valuable 
as cash received today (for example, due 
to inflation).
 ✓ Net present value (NPV): Net present value 
is a commonly used measure of value that 
uses discounted cash flows to evaluate an 
investment considering the time value of 
money, plus the size and risk of an invest-
ment. Easily handled by software programs 
or a financial calculator, NPV is a calcula-
tion where each estimated future cash flow 
is discounted back to the present value by 
using the appropriate discount rate or target 
yield. This discount rate for individual inves-
tors is typically their opportunity cost, or the 
interest rate they can earn in a comparable 
investment that is similar in size, risk, and 
duration. Corporate investors generally use 
their cost of capital (the weighted sum of 
their cost of equity and their cost of debt).
 
 The NPV can be a positive number, a nega-
tive number, or precisely zero. An NPV of 
zero means that the proposed investment 
exactly met the discount rate; a positive 
NPV indicates that if the investment per-
forms as anticipated, the return will exceed 
the target yield. A positive NPV is also an 
indicator of how much more the investor 
can pay to acquire and improve the prop-
erty, or it can be considered as a cushion 
or safety factor against shortfalls in future 
cash flows. Conversely, a negative NPV 
reflects that the property will fall short of 
the target yield by the amount of the NPV. 
The investor should lower her offer to pur-
chase by the amount of the negative NPV, 
or she needs to increase the net projected 
cash flows or simply accept a lower than 
desired rate of return for this particular 
investment.
 ✓ Internal rate of return (IRR): The IRR is the 
most popular and widely quoted of the 
advanced valuation techniques for evalu-
ating and comparing investment returns. 
The IRR is the percentage rate earned on 
all dollars invested for the specific periods 
each is invested. IRR doesn’t measure the 
return of the equity dollars invested but 
only those additional dollars earned on the 
invested capital, so an IRR requires that 
the total dollars received exceed the dol-
lars spent on the investment. The return on 
invested dollars is dependent on both the 
amount of the excess and when the excess 
is received. Bottom line: The IRR and NPV 
are related because the IRR is simply the 
interest rate at which the NPV for an invest-
ment is equal to zero (0). The IRR is useful 
to compare real estate opportunities with 
alternative investments such as money 
market accounts, mutual funds, stocks, 
bonds, and commodities.
Figuring the results for each of these meth-
ods has been simplified by the advent of soft-
ware programs that can perform complicated 
calculations.

 Chapter 12: Valuing Property through Number Crunching
Putting It All Together: Deciding 
How Much to Pay
After you’ve done all of your research and calculations, the reality is that you 
still need to determine whether a proposed property is a good opportunity — 
and at what price? You don’t want to pay retail, but the typical properties you 
see are based on unrealistic representations by most sellers.
 
You want to buy when you project that the property has a strong likelihood of 
producing future increases in NOI and cash flow. So you should look for prop-
erties where your analysis shows that the income for the property can be 
increased or the expenses reduced.
In this chapter, we’ve covered NOI, cash flow, and the valuation techniques 
used by the professionals. Using those techniques can help you to determine 
the maximum price that you should pay for a property.
But sellers are also using similar techniques to set the maximum price they 
think they can squeeze out of the most generous buyer in the market. You 
need to understand how they may bend and twist the facts to present their 
property in the best light. The following examples demonstrate how being 
able to properly value investment real estate before making a purchase offer 
is essential.
Examining the seller’s rental 
rate and expense claims
Virtually every seller of an investment property claims that the rents are 
below market. Sellers imply that instantly, and almost magically, upon pur-
chasing the building the buyer will be able to enhance the value of her new 
investment property and improve her cash flow by merely (yet significantly) 
increasing rents.
Of course, you may be wondering: If I can make money by simply raising the 
rents, why doesn’t the current owner increase the rents and then sell the 
building at a much higher price? After all, sellers know that buyers will base 
their offer on NOI. The answer is that they usually do raise rents before put-
ting the property on the market. But sellers (and their real estate agents) still 
go ahead and claim that the buyer can raise the rents even more. And if a 
buyer hasn’t done her homework and carefully evaluated the current rental 
market, she may well fall for the seller’s tricks.

204
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
The same scenario is found with expenses. The seller typically cuts back on 
spending to show artificially low expenses, or claims that the buyer can cut 
expenses through an energy conservation program or some other seemingly 
sensible method. This mindset assumes that the current owner hasn’t taken 
advantage of legitimate ways to cut down on expenses.
Of course, you can find exceptions where an owner has truly been too nice 
or lazy to keep the rents at market level or conduct an energy conversion 
to lower expenses. But we suggest that even if these claims are true, the 
buyer shouldn’t pay an inflated price based on the assumption of being able 
to make these changes because she’ll have to pony up to make the changes 
herself. If you’ve ever given out a rent increase to full market value, you 
know that it’s generally unpleasant, and you should be compensated for 
your efforts — not the seller (who lacked the fortitude to implement the rent 
increase).
Deciding which set of numbers to use
When you look at listings of properties for sale, you find that many sellers 
and their brokers or agents develop a pro forma, or future estimate of the 
NOI. From this artificially high NOI, they then derive an above-market asking 
price for the property. They also use the unrealistic pro forma NOI to show 
all of the various value indicators such as GRM and cap rate. In reality, the 
NOI would even drop if you were to unexpectedly lose some of your key ten-
ants or be faced with a major unanticipated expense. So remember that this 
pro forma is an estimate of future operations of the property. The future is 
uncertain, so none of the numbers are truly right or wrong. And you’ll be 
amazed by how universally optimistic sellers are about how much more 
money you’ll make than they did when you buy their property!
Although the IRV formula uses the future NOI and the value of the building is 
determined based on those numbers, we suggest that you find a seller who 
calculated his asking price based on actual historical operating income and 
expenses. You want to anticipate the future and pay for the present. You 
need to set your offering price based on your own calculations as to the NOI 
you truly expect to earn in the year after your purchase. (For more on IRV, 
see the “Income capitalization approach” section earlier in this chapter.)
The other key component to the IRV formula is the capitalization rate. We 
demonstrate that if you lower the capitalization rate or required return, you 
can dramatically increase the value of the property. A lower rate of return is 
required when the risk associated with the cash flow of a property is lower. 
The risk is lower when the property is competitive with or superior to other 
comparable properties, has minimal deferred maintenance, and has solid 
tenants with leases in place that are at market.

Y
ou and your real estate team log many hours in locating and valuing 
property. Then comes the moment when you must decide whether you 
want to try and buy a particular property or keep looking for a more attrac-
tive opportunity. In this chapter, we discuss how to negotiate a deal that 
meets your needs as well as the seller’s. Finally, we cover the all-important 
details of real estate investment contracts.
Negotiating 101
 
You make money in real estate when you purchase your investment property. 
If you buy a well-located and physically sound property below market value 
and replacement cost, the property will provide you with excellent returns for 
many years. This is why smart negotiating is so important to being successful 
with your real estate investments.
Superior knowledge combined with superior negotiating leads to superior 
returns. This section explains how to be a champion negotiator.
Starting with the right approach
 
Although everyone approaches negotiating from their own perspective, we 
think that it’s important to understand that the real estate community in most 
areas is actually a close-knit group of professionals who network. Thus, word 
of mouth referrals and a reputation for honesty and integrity are critical ele-
ments to your long-term success. Patience, vision, and perseverance are also 
great virtues when it comes to making the best real estate deals. Hard driving, 
one-sided transactions may make you some extra money in the short-run, but 
word travels fast.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
A university study indicates that people who have a favorable experience 
share their positive feelings with an average of four others. However, those 
who’ve had a negative experience go out of their way to tell more than 20 
people how they feel about you. Human nature also indicates that they likely 
embellish the story with each conversation.
Here’s what we don’t recommend:
 
✓ A take-it-or-leave approach: Even in a weak market with few buyers and 
many potential sellers, the my-way-or-the-highway style is a short-term, 
dangerous strategy. It may work if you plan to purchase only a single 
property in a geographic area, but we believe you need to be active 
in the same market for many years and build a positive reputation. 
And this bare-knuckles strategy doesn’t always work even just once, 
because even the weakest sellers sometimes have alternatives and 
choices. They may decide life is better if they don’t sell their property 
to an inflexible jerk.
 
✓ A lowballing approach: Making patently frivolous offers in an attempt to 
get lucky is another technique recommended by some real estate gurus. 
Our experience is that sellers aren’t stupid, and they quickly eliminate 
further offers, even reasonable ones, from such greedy bottom-fishers.
 
The problem with many aggressive negotiating techniques is that you can get 
so wrapped up in just making the deal that you forget what you’re doing. You 
can make some serious mistakes and buy properties that you should’ve elimi-
nated during your pre-offer due diligence. Don’t get emotionally involved in 
any potential property. You’re buying investment real estate and not your 
dream house. You simply want to have someone else pay rent and make your 
mortgage payments so that you can build wealth and cash flow.
Building a solid foundation of knowledge
 
The most important negotiating tool in an investment property purchase is 
superior knowledge — if you’re unwilling to do the homework necessary to 
justify the right price, you’re almost guaranteed to overpay for real estate. 
Your goal as an investor is to set the maximum price that you can pay and still 
receive a solid return on your investment in light of the associated risks.
In order to achieve this goal, you need to know more about your proposed 
property acquisition than anyone else, especially the seller. You need to 
know about the property, neighboring properties, local and state laws, and 
all of the economic data we discuss in Chapter 10 that can help foretell which 
properties are in the path of progress versus those that have already seen 
their best days. Although an occasional seller dramatically underestimates 
the true market value of the real estate, the vast majority of properties you 
see offered for sale are overpriced. That is amazingly still true in many parts 

207
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
of the country, even with the market correction of the late-2000s. You may 
encounter some sellers who enjoyed significant price appreciation over the 
preceding years but stubbornly refuse to accept that demand for their prop-
erty has fallen and that prices must adjust to the current market reality. Of 
course, some of these sellers aren’t really motivated and are just hoping to 
find an uninformed buyer. Don’t let that be you!
Becoming intimately familiar with the local economy
We don’t suggest that you mislead anyone, but an amazing number of cur-
rent property owners just don’t pay attention to even the most basic pub-
licly available information. Nothing is immoral or illegal about having vision 
to upgrade and renovate a property to achieve its full value because your 
research with local agencies indicates that a major new employer is moving 
into the area, dramatically increasing demand for half-vacant and tired com-
mercial properties — like the one you’re considering for purchase.
You’ll be extremely successful in negotiating great real estate deals if you not 
only know the right people and have a good real estate investment team but 
also know the important factors that affect supply and demand in the local 
market.
Maybe you’re seeing local companies growing rapidly and hiring lots of 
new workers. You know that because of a local housing shortage, the many 
new families moving into the area will be unable to afford a new home and 
will need to rent instead. That’s a good sign that rents will increase and the 
demand will be high for nice three- to four-bedroom rental homes located in 
quiet cul-de-sacs near the best schools. Clearly, you can use this information 
to properly negotiate the purchase of prime rental homes in such a market.
Or perhaps the final approval by the local transit district to extend a new 
light rail line into and through a rundown area of the community may really 
be a catalyst for positive change. So you do your homework and find an older 
couple who has lost interest in their commercial property in that area. You 
purchase and renovate this small retail strip center across from the new sta-
tion because you know it’s an attractive location for retail tenants targeting 
commuters.
Determine the current supply and demand in the marketplace so you know 
whether it’s a buyer’s or seller’s market. That doesn’t mean you can’t still 
make some great real estate investments, but you need to be realistic. Buying 
in a seller’s market at prices above replacement cost can be dangerous. Don’t 
even consider it if your goal is a short-term hold on the property.
 
As the potential purchaser, you must discover as much as you can about the 
property and the owner before making an offer. How long has the property 
been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the owner selling? The more 
you know about the property you want to buy and the seller’s motivations, the 
better your ability to make an offer that meets everyone’s needs.

208
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Infomercial negotiating strategies don’t pan out
We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but 
those late-night TV infomercial gurus don’t tell 
the full story when they and their testimonials 
say how easy it was for them to start with noth-
ing and suddenly own vast real estate holdings 
that all seem to magically be worth millions and 
provide great cash flow. If it were really that 
easy, the gurus wouldn’t be telling you about 
it — they would be busy making great deals just 
for themselves. (Only the multi-tasking and for-
ever money-hungry Donald Trump seems to be 
able to make some of his own deals and sell you 
books and tapes at the same time!)
There are times when you buy just before the 
market takes off and you can’t lose. But those 
infomercials claim that the buyers who follow 
their advice can leave the closing table with 
checks (you can buy a property with no money 
down and actually have the seller pay you at 
closing). They’re not telling the full story that the 
funds are proceeds from a loan or other debt 
that was assumed or placed on the property. 
Or maybe the funds represent the seller’s pro-
rated share of the large property tax installment 
that you’ll have the pleasure of paying in full 
next month!
Do you get excited and think you’ve found 
money when you withdraw cash from your 
bank account at an ATM? Of course not, and so 
you aren’t fooled by receiving cash at a close 
of escrow if you’re really just borrowing more 
against the property. Being able to borrow 
against real estate is one of its greatest bene-
fits, but one that should never be confused with 
receiving free money!
The old adage “If it sounds too good to be true, 
it is too good to be true” applies to real estate 
and particularly the thought that the best real 
estate is available to the average person at 
unbelievably favorable terms. There’s so much 
capital available to owners of real estate that 
even truly desperate sellers have the ability 
to borrow against the value of the real estate. 
The interest rates and terms may be horren-
dous, but money is almost always available for 
any property that isn’t a toxic waste dump, so 
there’s no need for an owner to give his prop-
erty away unless it has no equity. If the property 
has no equity, you may indeed be able to pay 
little or nothing down to the current owner, but 
that doesn’t mean you’re getting a great deal. 
Rather, you’re simply stepping into the shoes of 
the seller and either assuming or placing new 
debt on the property for the full value without 
having any equity yourself. Remember, there’s 
no free lunch — you usually get what you 
pay for.
The only way you can get these unbelievable 
terms as a buyer purchasing property dramati-
cally below its market value is if the seller has 
a lot of equity and is overwhelmed, extremely 
motivated, and out of time. But if the seller has 
a lot of equity in a truly great property, he could 
simply borrow money against that equity, con-
tinue to own the property, and use its cash flow 
to pay off the loan. He wouldn’t sell it to some-
one who listened to a CD in her car and made a 
ridiculously low offer.

209
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
Most real estate investors utilize the services of a real estate agent, who 
usually carries the burden of the negotiation process. Even if you delegate 
responsibility for negotiating to your agent, you still should have a plan and 
strategy in mind. Otherwise, you may overpay for real estate.
Figuring out the seller’s motivations
 
Some listing agents love to talk and will tell you the life history of the seller. 
Encourage this free flow of information. The goal for you and your agent is to 
get the seller or his agent to reveal helpful information (without sharing any 
pertinent or strategic information about yourself). Always seek the answer to 
the most important question: “Why are you selling?”
The more you know about the seller’s needs and motivation, the better you 
can structure your offer to best meet the needs of the seller while still provid-
ing yourself with a great investment opportunity. You can also avoid wasting 
your time negotiating with a fake seller who isn’t motivated to sell. Some sell-
ers are really just testing the market or only willing to sell if they can get a 
price well over the market value.
Figure out how to spot these fake sellers early on. Look for the warning signs 
such as unexplained delays in responding to offers or questions, a reluctance 
to answer questions or give you access to the property, and a generally unco-
operative attitude. If you see these signs, don’t make an offer on the property.
 
Information is a two-way street. Don’t give out any information about your 
motivations that gives the seller added negotiating leverage. The less you say 
about how much you like the property or your reasons for making the offer, 
the better. For example, many sellers are able to stick to their full price terms 
and as-is condition of the property if they know that the buyer is in a tax-
deferred exchange (see Chapter 18) with its tight time restrictions. A buyer 
facing the possibility of paying significant capital gains taxes if she doesn’t 
close the transaction within 180 days may suddenly be agreeable to almost 
any reasonable condition requested by a seller if she’s down to her last week.
Bringing property-related data to the table
Information is the heart of negotiating. Bring facts to the bargaining table. 
Get comparable sales data to support your price. Too often, investors and 
their agents pick a number out of the air when they make an offer. If you were 
the seller, would you be persuaded to lower your asking price? Pointing to 
recent and comparable investment property sales to justify your offer price 
strengthens your case. Rarely do you find a seller of investment-grade real 
estate who doesn’t have access to plenty of market data. But sellers often 
don’t select the right comparable properties — preferring to creatively use 
just those comps that provide for the highest possible asking price.

210
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
If the property needs repairs, never rely on bids provided by the seller. You 
must independently verify the numbers with licensed professional contrac-
tors. You can also use these written proposals to support your position 
regarding the true cost to make needed repairs instead of just making verbal 
representations. Always leave yourself a little cushion or wiggle room. We 
have found that even with the most comprehensive bids from the top industry 
professionals, any significant renovation or remodeling project is likely to take 
longer and cost more than is estimated.
Assembling attractive and realistic offers
In this chapter, we cover and hopefully dispel many of the negotiating theo-
ries or fallacies of the get-rich-quick gurus. We don’t want to just tell you what 
not to do, so here are some examples of realistic and creative ways to negoti-
ate and structure a real estate offer that accurately reflects the value of the 
property but also provides you with a reasonable return on your investment.
Factoring in fix-up costs
Say you come across an opportunity to buy a great three-bedroom, two-bath 
house. You live close by, and you know the area is terrific. The house would 
be an ideal rental because it’s two blocks from a new school. You estimate 
that the property will rent for $1,750 per month, and there’s strong demand 
for rental homes. The seller is asking $200,000, which appears to be its 
market value — based on the home having no deferred maintenance. But you 
know that no rental property has no deferred maintenance, so you call your 
home inspection contractor. His report indicates that overall, the property is 
in decent condition, and the big-ticket items of appliances and flooring have 
recently been replaced. But also has some bad news: The roof needs to be 
replaced before the next winter. You contact three reputable roofing con-
tractors, and the best value bid for a roof replacement that’ll last 20 years is 
$8,000. You also estimate that you’ll need about $2,000 in minor repairs and 
upgrades to the landscaping and the irrigation system.
What should you pay? If you said $190,000, you aren’t necessarily wrong, but 
you’re not providing any room for unforeseen events — or any compensa-
tion or reimbursement for your time and the risk involved in overseeing and 
coordinating this work. We suggest that you take your actual conservative 
estimates for all repairs and add at least 50 percent. Cover those surprises 
that are likely to occur, plus compensate yourself for the time, effort, and 
risk associated with renovations. Contractors and other professionals 
always allow for contingencies, overhead, and profit when they present their 
bids, so why should a real estate investor who invests her sweat equity uti-
lizing her own handyman or contracting skills not be equally compensated? 
This is one of the biggest (and most avoidable) mistakes that novice real 
estate investors make.

211
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
Creatively meeting the seller’s price
 
Price is only one of several negotiable items, but it’s the first clause the seller 
reviews in a purchase offer. Because many sellers fixate on the price they 
receive for the property (perhaps they want to get at least what they paid for 
it themselves several years ago), you can offer the full price but seek other 
concessions in order to reduce the effective cost of buying the property. 
These creative offers allow you to pay what the property is worth, and the 
seller can feel satisfied that he held firm and received his full asking price:
 
✓ Get the seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements. The buyer 
should always look for the seller to correct all health and safety items 
and required pest control repairs before closing escrow. But other items 
can also be negotiated. For example, you can often entice the seller to 
provide a credit in escrow for the replacement of old worn-out carpet-
ing, window coverings, or appliances. Likewise, rather than have the 
seller patch that 30-year-old roof that you’ll be replacing anyway, have 
him take the cost of the repairs off the purchase price.
 
✓ Seek attractive seller financing. For example, you may find a small, 
well-maintained commercial property on the market for $200,000 that 
you believe is really worth no more than $195,000. But the seller is deter-
mined not to sell for less than his asking price. You can structure your 
offer at $200,000, with the seller agreeing to lend you some money at a 
below-market interest rate for ten years that essentially saves you much 
more than $5,000.
The time that you need to close on your purchase is also a bargaining chip. 
Some sellers may need cash soon and concede other points if you can close 
quickly. And the real estate agent’s commission may be negotiable too. 
Finally, try as best you can to leave your emotions out of any property pur-
chase. This is easier said than done, but try not to fall in love with a property. 
Keep searching for other properties even when you make an offer — you may 
be negotiating with an unmotivated seller.
Preparing to Make Your Offer: 
Understanding Contract Basics
The purchase and sale of real estate are always done in writing. The most 
critical document in any transaction is the sales contract, which is referred 
to as the purchase agreement in real estate transactions. After you have found 
a property that meets your investment goals, have your real estate agent pre-
pare a real estate contract for presentation to the seller or her agent.

212
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
A real estate contract is a legally binding written agreement between two 
or more persons regarding an exchange of some sort. These contracts are 
legally enforceable sets of promises that must be performed and that rely 
on the basics of contract law. (Contracts may also be oral, but as we dis-
cuss later in the section “Elements of a contract,” oral contracts should be 
avoided.)
Bilateral versus unilateral contracts
Real estate contracts can be either bilateral or unilateral:
 
✓ Bilateral: Most real estate contracts are bilateral, meaning that each 
party to the contract promises to provide some consideration (some-
thing of value) and adhere to the terms of the contract. For example, the 
seller gives the buyer title to the property in exchange for cash and/or a 
promissory note (a written document promising to pay the holder of the 
note a certain sum of money at some given time in the future).
 
✓ Unilateral: A unilateral contract is a one-sided agreement in which only 
one party promises to do something. An example is an option agree-
ment in which the seller (optionor) gives a potential buyer (optionee) an 
unconditional purchase option for a certain period of time. The option is 
enforceable only by the optionee. If the option isn’t properly exercised, 
the optionor’s obligation and the optionee’s rights expire.
Elements of a contract
A legally binding contract is valid because it contains all of the necessary ele-
ments that make it legally enforceable. In the following list, we outline the 
basic elements of a legally binding and enforceable real estate contract. The 
terms may sound a bit technical, but you need to be familiar with them.
 
✓ Legally competent parties: Every party to the transaction must have 
legal capacity, which is defined as being of legal age (18 in most states) 
and having the mental capacity to understand the consequences of its 
actions. Convicted criminals and certain mentally ill persons may not 
have legal capacity. Be careful when dealing with older persons if they 
seem to have any difficulty understanding or communicating. Politely 
inquire whether they have anyone who is acting on their behalf in a rep-
resentative capacity. Many states have passed strict elder abuse laws, 
and you wouldn’t want to find yourself in court defending allegations 
that you defrauded a kindly widow out of her home.
 
✓ An offer: An offer to purchase real estate is a written communication 
to the current owner of the buyer’s willingness to purchase a specific 
property at the terms indicated. The seller can continue to market the 

213
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
property while considering the offer. Unless an expiration clause is 
included, an offer may be accepted by the seller at any time before it’s 
rescinded by the buyer.
 
 Virtually all offers have a specific expiration time. (“This offer is valid 
until Friday, June 19th at 5 p.m. EST only.”) Follow suit to prevent the 
seller from using the offer as a negotiating tool with other interested par-
ties, shopping your offer around, or trying to entice another buyer to 
raise her offer. Also, if the offer is open-ended, the buyer has to affirma-
tively rescind the offer, which is more work and trouble than simply 
having the offer expire after some passage of time.
 
✓ Acceptance: Acceptance is a positive written response in a timely 
manner to the exact terms of an offer. Acceptance legally requires that 
the buyer must be given legal notice of the acceptance. Commonly, the 
seller doesn’t accept the offer as presented but proposes changes in the 
terms or conditions — which is a counteroffer.
 
✓ Counteroffer: This is legally a new offer; the original offer is rejected and 
is void. Counteroffers can go back and forth until both buyer and seller 
have agreed and the final accepted offer becomes the binding agreement 
between the parties. Just like offers, counteroffers must be in writing 
and can also be rescinded at any time prior to acceptance.
 
✓ Consideration: Consideration is basically the exchange aspect of the 
deal: The buyer offers payment of money or something of value to the 
seller, who agrees to give over the property in return. A real estate con-
tract isn’t binding if each party doesn’t offer at least some consideration 
to the other party.
 
✓ Clearly and uniquely identified property: This identification is 
required so there’s no uncertainty about precisely which property is 
being sold and transferred to the buyer. Typically, a legal description of 
the property is used.
 
✓ Legal purpose: The real estate contract must be for a legal purpose and 
can’t be for an illegal act or an act so immoral that it’s against public 
policy. For example, a buyer purchasing a single-family home with the 
intent to run his property management company there would want to 
cancel the purchase if during the due diligence process he discovers 
that such use violates local prohibitions against operating a business in 
a residentially zoned area.
 
✓ Written contract: A written contract is required for all enforceable 
transfers of real estate. All terms and conditions of the purchase agree-
ment or sales contract must be set forth in writing, even for minor items 
that may not seem consequential. Generally, the written contract helps 
ensure that there is no confusion about what is included in the sale. For 
example, if you want to make sure that the supplies in the maintenance 
shop for a commercial or apartment building are included and not taken 
before the sale, you must specify it in the contract. Remember that if 
something isn’t in writing, you won’t prevail.

214
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
Agreements for the sale of real estate must be in writing or they’re unenforce-
able. Never make an oral agreement of any type regarding real estate no 
matter how convenient, expedient, or reasonable it may seem at the time. The 
Statute of Frauds is a legal concept that requires all transfers of real estate to 
be in writing to be enforceable in a court of law. Real estate–related contracts 
that must be in writing include sales contracts or purchase agreements, leases 
for more than one year, real estate loans secured by a mortgage or note, list-
ing contracts and commission agreements with agents, and an employment 
agreement with an agent to locate property.
A failure to meet all of these essential elements can lead to the contract being 
declared void. A void contract has no legal force or effect and is unenforce-
able in a court of law. A voidable real estate contract is one that may be treated 
as legally unenforceable at the option of a party (usually the injured party) 
but remains enforceable until that party exercises her option. An example is a 
real estate contract with a minor that is voidable only by the minor.
Besides all the legal elements, real estate sales contracts specify the sale price 
and the terms and conditions as well as any contingencies (see the “Using 
contingencies effectively” section later in the chapter). The contract must be 
Unequal “standardized” contracts
Some real estate seminar promoters, info-
mercial mavens, and authors (such as Robert 
Shemin), recommend that you create your own 
standardized contracts — one for buying a 
property and a different form for selling a prop-
erty. A quick review of his sample contracts 
reveals why he makes this recommendation: 
The terms and conditions of each contract are 
clearly one-sided. For example, the “standard-
ized” contract that he suggests you use for 
buying a property contains a provision for a 120-
day escrow, a litany of contingencies that give 
you essentially an unlimited ability to cancel 
the escrow without penalty, a broad assign-
ment clause, a stipulation that the seller pays 
all costs, and no mention of an earnest money 
deposit.
The contract you’re to use when you sell your 
property requires a ten-day escrow, provides 
the buyer no contingencies and no access to 
the property, states that the buyer pays all the 
costs, and demands a nonrefundable earnest 
deposit. Further, this author advises that the key 
to pulling this off is that you actually have these 
forms printed with the words Standardized 
Contract. Then, if the other party questions any 
of the terms, you simply say that it’s a standard-
ized contract and you can’t make any changes.
This is the type of advice that has given the late-
night real estate investment information gurus 
such a questionable reputation. Of course, 
many of these items are negotiable, and there 
is absolutely nothing wrong with demanding dif-
ferent terms based on legitimate market factors. 
Maybe you need to close on another property, 
so you require a 60-day escrow instead of 90 
days. That is a justifiable business reason, but 
we strongly encourage you to treat everyone 
you deal with in an equitable manner. If you plan 
on having a long and successful career invest-
ing in real estate in your local community, your 
reputation as a straight shooter is extremely 
valuable to you, and you should never engage 
in such practices.

215
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
signed and include a standard statement that “time is of the essence,” which 
ensures that all dates and times of day noted in the contract are important 
and can’t be ignored by any of the parties without the written consent of the 
other party; otherwise, there is a breach of the contract. If the contract is 
breached, the other party may be entitled to monetary damages.
Addressing Key Provisions in 
the Purchase Agreement
The purchase agreement is the legal document that outlines the details of the 
transaction for your proposed purchase of the subject property. Depending 
on where you live, there are other terms for a contract for the purchase of 
real estate, such as a sales contract, an offer to purchase, a contract of purchase 
and sale, an earnest money agreement, and a deposit receipt.
No matter what you call it, the purchase agreement is the most important 
document in the sale of real estate. It includes the basic info — the names 
of the sellers and buyers, a description of the property, and the proposed 
financing terms — and indicates how much you pay, when you pay, the terms 
and conditions that must be met to close the transaction, and the condi-
tions under which the agreement can be canceled and the buyer’s deposit 
returned.
Don’t let a real estate agent tell you that your offer must be on a certain form, 
because although many purchase agreement forms are available, none are 
required. Which form you use is up to you — we recommend that you use a 
purchase agreement form that’s easy to read and understand. The more com-
plicated the language, the more likely it is that the parties get confused or 
disagree on the meaning of the terms of the offer.
 
To find forms to use in your real estate investment activities, look to local title 
and escrow companies and your local association of realtors. However, most 
of these firms and realtor boards don’t offer their proprietary forms to the 
public. California real estate attorney James McKenney owns a company that 
specializes in plain-language forms used throughout the country by real estate 
investors and property managers. The sample purchase agreement in the 
appendix was provided by Professional Publishing Company, 365 Bel Marin 
Keys Boulevard, Suite 100, Novato, CA 94949; phone 415-884-2164; Web site 
www.profpub.com or www.trueforms.com.
Go over the form in detail with your real estate broker or agent and carefully 
consider the terms that you want to offer in each paragraph. Don’t leave any 
blank spaces, and have your attorney mark through any clauses that you feel 
aren’t appropriate. Just because a certain clause is preprinted doesn’t mean 
that you can’t cross it out or modify the language to suit your needs. Make 

216
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
sure that you clearly initial any changes and require the other party to also 
initial every single change and the bottom of each page to ensure that you 
agreed on the specific terms.
Some of the terms are at your discretion, but your real estate agent can 
advise you as to the local custom and practice concerning issues such as 
the standard for earnest money deposits (see the next section) or the length 
of contingency periods for inspections of the property, books, and records. 
Your agent can also inform you about local standards for prorating the clos-
ing agent costs and the other miscellaneous costs of the transaction.
The following sections cover other key provisions you should carefully 
evaluate, because you must make many decisions about your offer before 
the purchase agreement is ready for your signature.
Showing intention with an 
earnest money deposit
Right after the purchase price, one of the most important terms that can set 
the emotional tone for further negotiations is the amount of the earnest money 
deposit you’re willing to submit with your purchase offer. The earnest money 
deposit is usually fully refundable for a defined time period. Your deposit is 
held in trust by either the seller’s agent or a title or escrow company. Never 
make an earnest money deposit payable directly to the seller.
The purpose of the deposit is to show good faith by the buyer and the inten-
tion to follow through with the terms of the purchase agreement. The amount 
of the deposit varies in different areas depending upon local custom or the 
specific needs of a particular transaction. Also, depending on state law, the 
earnest money deposit may or may not pay interest. If you can, always insist 
that your earnest money be placed in an insured trust account that bears 
interest and that the purchase agreement clearly spell out that you (the 
buyer) are credited with all interest earned.
 
Some psychology is involved because the size of the deposit has an effect on 
the desirability of the offer. An offer with no earnest money or a nominal 
amount may be interpreted by the seller as coming from a buyer who isn’t 
serious about the transaction or lacks the cash to make a meaningful deposit.
 
A lousy recommendation suggested by some real estate investment gurus is 
for the buyer to offer a promissory note with her offer. That’s a sure way for a 
seller to identify that you’re not a serious buyer. Such no-money-down semi-
nar graduates may be classified as bottom-feeders or opportunists who are 
really only interested in properties with desperate and uneducated sellers.

217
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
When determining the earnest money deposit, remember that if you don’t live 
up to the agreement or don’t cancel it within the allowed time frames, you 
forfeit the deposit to the seller. The forfeiture of the earnest money deposit for 
nonperformance is called liquidated damages, which is essentially the payment 
for any and all damages incurred by the seller as a result of you not completing 
the purchase as proposed. Under the terms of most purchase agreements, a 
seller who keeps the earnest money deposit can’t sue for any further damages.
 
To avoid any expensive lessons about earnest money, follow this advice:
 
✓ As a buyer, make sure you know the exact date upon which your earnest 
money goes hard, which is the real estate industry term meaning it’s 
nonrefundable and passes to the seller regardless of whether you com-
plete the purchase of the property.
 
✓ Don’t wait until the last few days to cancel your purchase agreement. If 
you’re still unsure of your interest or ability to complete the transaction 
as proposed, send a written cancellation of the purchase agreement and 
then try to renegotiate additional time.
 
✓ Both buyer and seller must agree to any changes in writing. Never rely 
on any verbal representations as to any extensions or changes of terms 
or conditions.
Assigning your rights
 
Many purchase agreements specifically include a clause giving the buyer the 
ability to assign his interests to another party. Assignment is the transfer of the 
right or duties under a real estate contract by the buyer to a third party. This 
is an extremely important clause for buyers, and we strongly encourage you to 
include the right to assign the contract as a term of your purchase offer. In the 
contract, simply include the language “or assignee” after the name of the legal 
entity indicated as the purchaser. Of course, if the preprinted purchase offer 
has a clause that prohibits assignment, you need to cross out that language 
and have both parties initial the change.
Leaving the buy-and-flip door open
Even though we’re not ardent promoters of the buy-and-flip strategy, the 
ability to assign or transfer your purchase agreement to another real estate 
investor gives you the opportunity to realize a profit without ever having to 
close on the deal yourself. When the real estate market is appreciating rap-
idly, some real estate investors have found that the property has increased in 
value so significantly that they can sell their contractual position.
In the early- to mid-2000s in certain really hot housing markets, some real 
estate speculators went to new housing tracts and signed contracts with 
builders — up to a year or more before the property was built. Then, during 

218
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
the extended contract and escrow period, the value of the property being 
built went up, so the buyer was able to merely transfer their contractual 
rights to buy the property at the locked in price and terms to another buyer 
for a profit.
 
The reality is that profiting from speculating on new housing tracts isn’t guar-
anteed or easy. Builders aren’t naïve, and many don’t allow the assignment of 
the purchase agreement — so the buyer must actually complete the sale and 
then resell the property to earn their profit, if they actually turn a profit after 
deducting the costs of two transactions. Also, many builders specify that they 
don’t sell to buyers from out-of-state or who won’t occupy the homes. Some 
simply require larger earnest money deposits for speculators, and others actu-
ally require the buyer to contractually agree to not sell the property for at 
least one year. If housing prices fall rather than rise (as they did in the late-
2000s in Las Vegas, where over 40,000 homes were previously purchased in 
this manner), the buyer may have to complete the purchase or lose his ear-
nest money deposit. These facts haven’t stopped many of the late-night info-
mercial kings from promoting the idea that fantastic returns can be achieved 
by simply placing nominal deposits on homes to be constructed. We’ve even 
heard of some charlatans who hold seminars to attract investors willing to 
fund these speculative ventures. Often they’re a form of scheme and should 
be avoided. Our advice is to never invest in real estate with partners that you 
just met at a real estate seminar!
Installing an emergency exit
The ability to assign your interests in a purchase agreement can be a life-
saver in another scenario. Many savvy investors have gotten into a real 
estate transaction in which the due diligence time frames have passed and 
their earnest money is at risk — and they’re unable or unwilling to complete 
the transaction. This situation typically happens because the buyer has 
second thoughts, doesn’t have enough money to close, finds a better deal, or 
doesn’t have the capability to handle the problems with the property. In this 
scenario, an assignment would allow the buyer to potentially recover his ear-
nest money deposit or even his due diligence costs from another interested 
buyer rather than walk away and let the seller take the earnest money (and 
then turn around and sell the property to another party). The buyer who has 
the property under contract controls the property and can make a deal with 
other parties.
Setting the closing date
An important term of your purchase offer is the proposed closing date for the 
transaction, which determines the anticipated escrow period (see Chapter 14 
for escrow information). The length of the escrow period is a matter of nego-
tiation between the buyer and seller, with consideration given to the length 
of time needed to obtain financing and the amount and complexity of due 

219
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
diligence necessary to complete the sale. A complicated financing transac-
tion, a property in need of a zoning change, or possible environmental issues 
require a much longer escrow period than a simple transaction.
Of course, the seller is usually interested in selling the property as soon as 
possible and wants a short escrow period and a fixed closing date; the buyer 
generally wants as much time as the seller will allow, some flexibility on the 
closing date, and the unilateral right to close the transaction earlier if he’s 
completed his work. But the lack of a specific time line can create problems 
for the seller, particularly if she’s trying to buy another investment in a tax-
deferred exchange (see Chapter 18) or has tenants in place who need to be 
vacated.
The more time for the buyer, the better opportunity he has to make sure he’s 
not making a mistake — and the seller knows that. But, the seller also knows 
that many buyers aren’t serious about purchasing the property and use an 
extended due diligence period to find problems with the property and try to 
wear down the seller into granting concessions or lowering the purchase price.
Some buyers also use a long escrow period to tie up the property, hoping to 
find another investor who will pay more for it. If they find one, they can then 
close escrow and immediately flip the property in a double escrow, which 
is actually two separate transactions done at the same time. The investor 
purchases the property from the original owner and simultaneously sells the 
property to a new buyer, usually at a profit, without really even taking pos-
session of the property other than for possibly a matter of seconds or min-
utes between the recording of the two transactions.
Ultimately, what you agree on in the purchase agreement is legally bind-
ing, but it’s really just an estimated closing date because so many different 
moving parts can affect when you close the sale. The closing date should be 
met unless both parties agree to an extension with a written addendum or 
escrow instruction (see “Ironing out straggling issues” later in the chapter).
Using contingencies effectively
A contingency in a real estate purchase agreement is simply a condition that 
must be fulfilled or an event that may or may not happen in the future before 
a contract becomes firm and binding. Contingencies can be for the benefit of 
either the seller or the buyer; if the contingencies aren’t met, the deal doesn’t 
go through. The seller of an estate property, for example, may require a con-
tingency that the probate court approves the sale. Buyers often have contin-
gencies for financing, physical inspections, and other items. Naturally, sellers 
attempt to eliminate unreasonable contingencies. For instance, most purchase 
agreements include contingencies that ask for 10 to 30 days to conduct the 
physical inspection and/or approve the books and records. If you request 60 
days to conduct these items, the seller may reject your offer as unreasonable.

220
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Contingencies are escape clauses that can protect the buyer from purchasing 
a property that doesn’t meet his needs. Without contingencies, purchasing 
a property would be extremely risky because you’d have to be sure that you 
had all of the financing in place and that the property was in good condition, 
met your needs, and the terms and conditions were acceptable before you 
even made the offer. Few buyers would be willing to do this, or they’d do it 
but discount their offer to account for the additional risk.
Although legally different from an option, contingencies can have a similar 
effect by allowing a prospective buyer the exclusive opportunity to buy the 
property in a limited time frame but not obligating the buyer to complete the 
transaction.
The terms of most purchase agreements provide that by certain defined 
dates, all of the contingencies must be resolved one way or another by the 
beneficiary, or party that stands to gain from the contingency. After it’s in 
place, a contingency has one of three outcomes:
 
✓ Contingencies can be satisfied. This means that the pending sale is no 
longer subject to cancellation or modification for that particular item. 
For example, the buyer can comply with the financing contingency upon 
receiving a written loan commitment at acceptable terms.
 
✓ The beneficiary of the contingency can unilaterally agree to waive or 
remove the contingency. For example, the seller may have asked for a 
contingency to identify a replacement property as part of an IRS section 
1031 tax deferred exchange. If the seller decides not to do an exchange, 
then she may simply notify the buyer in writing that she’s waiving that 
condition or contingency.
 
✓ A contingency can be rejected or fail. The beneficiary of the contin-
gency is then no longer obligated to perform under the contract. For 
example, the buyer may receive a termite inspection report indicating 
that there’s extensive damage and infestation and then decide that he’s 
no longer interested in completing the purchase. Under this scenario, 
the buyer typically receives the return of his earnest money deposit 
(and is glad that he diligently conducted a physical inspection).
 
Although the list varies depending on the property type, size, and location, 
here are contingency clauses that we recommend:
 
✓ Marketable title: Obtain a preliminary title report with full and complete 
copies of each and every exception and have your attorney review these 
documents.
 
✓ Financing: Outline the specific terms (type of loan and maximum 
acceptable interest rate) of a new loan required in order to complete the 
purchase. Require copies of the current loan documents and the most 
recent loan statement if you’re taking over existing financing.

221
 Chapter 13: Preparing and Making an Offer
 
✓ Appraisal: This condition demands that an independent professional 
appraisal of the property arrive at a value equal to or greater than the 
proposed purchase price. This requirement may be a necessary part of 
the financing or simply a safeguard to prevent you from overpaying for 
the property.
 
✓ Physical inspection: Most purchase agreements include an inspec-
tion clause mandating that you have unlimited access to the property 
for a certain amount of time to inspect the interior and exterior of the 
property. Hire qualified property inspectors, including specialists in 
key areas such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical systems, to conduct 
a thorough inspection of all rental units or suites. The results of the 
inspection can be used to negotiate with the seller by giving her the 
opportunity to make the necessary repairs, adjust the purchase price, or 
simply terminate the purchase agreement.
 
✓ Books and records inspection: If you’re purchasing a large residential 
or commercial property, another important contingency is the oppor-
tunity to review and inspect the income and expense statements and 
the leases. Ask for a copy of the seller’s Schedule E (filed with the IRS) 
to ensure that the income and expenses for the property are consistent 
with what the seller has been reporting. If the seller refuses to provide 
these tax documents, there is nothing you can do — but simply making 
the request sends a signal that he better not be misrepresenting the 
actual numbers. If litigation ever ensues, these documents can be sub-
poenaed and used as a basis to prove fraud and misrepresentation. A 
review of the leases should also include estoppel agreements. (These 
are covered in Chapter 10.)
 
✓ ALTA property survey: This survey shows the property boundaries or 
parcel map along with the site plan for all existing improvements, plus 
any easements and restrictions. It may be required by the lender, par-
ticularly if the loan is from an institution.
 
✓ Contracts: Make sure you receive copies of all service agreements and 
contracts currently in place at the property. Ideally, the seller should 
be required to cancel or terminate all nonessential contracts (unless 
they’re especially attractive in the current market conditions) at the 
close of escrow so you have the option of bringing in your own pre-
ferred vendors.
Ironing out straggling issues
In addition to the contingency clauses, many buyers negotiate a separate 
clause giving them the unilateral right to extend the closing date under certain 
conditions. For instance, the lender may require an environmental report, 
which when received indicates that further investigation is necessary before 

222
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
it can make a loan commitment. Or you may need legal action to get access to 
a stubborn occupant’s property. A well-written purchase agreement provides 
for an extension of the closing date under such circumstances. Be sure that 
all parties agree to any such extension in writing prior to the closing date indi-
cated in the purchase agreement to avoid any potential disputes.
Be sure that your purchase agreement clearly indicates what personal prop-
erty is included. The personal property can be a significant factor in large 
apartment buildings because it can include the appliances and window cover-
ings, plus common area furnishings and fixtures.
Depending on your plans for the property, you may want the property trans-
ferred with or without tenants. If the tenants aren’t on valid and enforceable 
long-term leases, and you can increase the property value by renovation and 
gaining new tenants, requiring the seller to deliver the property vacant and 
what’s called broom clean (free of debris, dirt, personal property, furniture, 
and so on) at the close of escrow can be prudent. This is also true if you buy 
a seller-occupied property. Either include a clause requiring that they vacate 
prior to the close of escrow or negotiate a lease with them for continued ten-
ancy at mutually agreeable terms.
Presenting the Purchase Agreement
 
After you and your agent are comfortable with the purchase agreement you’ve 
prepared, insist that the offer be presented by your agent in person. Although 
much business today is transacted electronically, the best negotiation is done 
eyeball-to-eyeball, and your agent can get a much better sense of the other 
party’s personality and needs and wants through an in-person meeting.
Your offer should include a set time limit for response. Depending on the 
type of property and the size of the transaction, give the seller 24 to 72 hours 
to respond to the offer. The larger and more complicated the transaction, the 
more time the seller needs to evaluate your offer. As we discuss in the sec-
tion “Preparing to Make Your Offer: Understanding Contract Basics” earlier 
in this chapter, the seller can accept your offer as presented, respond with 
a counteroffer, or even outright reject the offer or simply let it expire. After 
your offer for the property is accepted, you control the property and you 
have it under contract.

our work is just beginning when you have an accepted offer for your 
proposed acquisition, the property is under contract, and an escrow 
account has been opened. You control the property and can begin to deter-
mine whether it has been accurately represented by the seller.
In Chapters 11 and 12, we cover the pre-offer due diligence, which is essen-
tial in weeding out properties that clearly fail to meet your investment goals. 
Now the formal due diligence period begins. Due diligence is the pre-escrow 
process you (or your representatives) perform to investigate the property’s 
physical and fiscal condition.
Only complete the transaction if the property physically and fiscally meets 
your needs and the financing is satisfactory. But the property may actually still 
be worth pursuing if the seller is willing to correct deficiencies or give you a 
monetary credit to cover your costs to complete the necessary work yourself.
In this chapter, we focus on some of the important issues in opening an 
escrow, conducting formal due diligence, performing property inspections, 
handling credits in escrow, the various methods of taking title, and ultimately 
closing the transaction and taking over your new property.

224
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Opening Escrow
Escrow is a method of completing a real estate transaction in which a disinter-
ested third party acts as the intermediary to coordinate the closing activities. 
The first step after the buyer and the seller sign the purchase agreement is for 
the earnest money funds (the money you give the seller upfront as partial pay-
ment and confirmation of your intent to close the deal) to be deposited with 
the escrow holder and put in an escrow account in the name of the buyer.
A real estate transaction for even small investment properties can be compli-
cated, because the buyer and seller have different interests that need to be 
fairly represented. The escrow holder acts as a neutral third party who han-
dles the details of the transaction and often serves as the referee when dis-
agreements develop between buyer and seller. In some parts of the country, 
the role of the escrow officer is much more limited. Your real estate agent 
can guide you as to the custom and practice in your area.
An escrow officer at an escrow company or a title company can handle 
escrow. Although escrow officers handle most escrows, in some areas of the 
country attorneys act as the intermediary throughout the transaction. We 
refer to escrow officers, escrow agents, and real estate attorneys who handle 
the closing simply as escrow officers throughout this chapter.
 
Our good friend Ray Brown (and coauthor with Eric of Home Buying For 
Dummies [Wiley]) recommends that you remember that the escrow officer is a 
human being. Pick up the phone and introduce yourself. Ask if she has every-
thing she needs for the transaction to progress efficiently. Also let her know 
how she can reach you at various times of the day or week. Although the pro-
fessional escrow officer remains an unbiased and fair intermediary, this per-
sonal touch never hurts and may make things easier if your escrow doesn’t 
proceed smoothly.
Escrow instructions
The escrow officer prepares the escrow instructions that guide the transac-
tion between the parties. The escrow instructions are derived from the specific 
terms found in the purchase agreement and in any other written documents 
mutually agreed upon by both the buyer and seller.
The escrow instructions are critical. To minimize surprises, carefully review 
the instructions before you sign them, because that’s the document that the 
escrow holder relies upon exclusively to determine what to do in the event of 
a dispute. Unless allowed in the escrow instructions, the escrow officer can’t 
make any changes or respond to any requests without a written agreement 
signed by all parties.

225
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
The escrow officer only performs items that are mutually agreed upon, in 
writing, by both the buyer and the seller. If the escrow officer receives con-
flicting information or requests, nothing happens until all parties reach an 
agreement or obtain a court order instructing the escrow officer. If something 
isn’t allowed in the escrow instructions, both the seller and the buyer must 
present a fully executed change order to the escrow officer modifying the 
agreement. In other words, make sure that the escrow instructions meet your 
expectations.
Preliminary title report
Soon after the escrow instructions have been signed, your title company 
should send you a copy of the preliminary title report (or prelim). Have this 
extremely important document reviewed by an attorney unless you have a lot 
of personal experience and the prelim contains relatively few indicated items.
The preliminary title report indicates the current legal owner of the property 
and any mortgage liens, unpaid income tax liens, property tax liens, judgment 
liens, or other recorded encumbrances against the property. It also shows 
any easements, restrictions, or third-party interests that limit your use of the 
property such as the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (C, C, and Rs) 
commonly found with planned unit developments, community associations, 
or condominiums.
 
Obtain and review copies of the detailed backup materials for each item so 
that you know exactly what’s encumbering the property. The approval of the 
preliminary title report by the buyer is one of the basic contingencies in most 
real estate transactions (see Chapter 13 for more on contingencies). You have 
the right to cancel the purchase if the preliminary title report contains unac-
ceptable items. Of course, you can also require the seller to have unaccept-
able items removed or renegotiate the price and terms in order to continue 
with the transaction.
The preliminary title report gives you a good idea as to whether the seller 
can provide you with marketable title to the property, but it isn’t the same 
thing as title insurance, which we cover later in this chapter.
Removing contingencies
As we discuss in Chapter 13, the purchase agreement should contain a 
number of contingencies that allow the buyer and seller the opportunity to 
cancel the transaction if certain items aren’t satisfactory. It’s the escrow offi-
cer’s job to track these contingencies and receive and follow the instructions 
from the buyer and seller. One of three things happens with contingencies:

226
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Contingencies can be approved or satisfied.
 
✓ The beneficiary of the contingency can unilaterally agree to waive or 
remove the contingency.
 
✓ A contingency can be rejected or fail.
Contingencies create a sort of option and are critical elements that can make 
or break a transaction. The purchase agreement and escrow instructions 
usually contain deadlines — the parties have certain rights pertaining to con-
tingencies for a limited period of time. For example, the physical inspection 
contingency may provide only ten days to make the inspection; after that the 
contingency is considered approved (or satisfied) and the seller has the legal 
right to refuse access for a physical inspection.
 
The holder of the contingency option must notify the escrow officer at once if 
the contingency is rejected or fails. Also, it isn’t the escrow officer’s responsi-
bility to attempt to negotiate or mediate a resolution of any rejected contin-
gencies or other deal-threatening issues that arise during the escrow. It’s up to 
the buyer and seller and their respective agents to come up with solutions and 
keep the deal alive.
Estimating the closing date
After all of the buyer’s and seller’s contingencies pertaining to items such as 
the financing, appraisal, books and records, and the physical inspection have 
been met or waived, the escrow officer advises the parties of the estimated 
closing date for the transaction.
 
Our experience is that when buying real estate, the process generally takes 
longer than planned. Therefore, if you’re intent on keeping your efforts to pur-
chase your investment property from going awry because of unanticipated 
delays, make provisions upfront that provide the additional time to properly 
close the transaction.
This suggestion doesn’t mean that the escrow should be allowed to drag on 
indefinitely, but the more costly the property in escrow, the more likely you 
are to encounter unexpected challenges in satisfying or removing contingen-
cies. Nonresidential property transactions tend to take longer to complete 
because the leases are more complicated to analyze and the buyer wants 
estoppel certificates from each tenant. (See Chapter 11 for more on estoppel 
certificates.) For example, lenders, with their layers of approvals and particu-
lar requirements, often cause unforeseen delays, including phase I reports 
(discussed later in the chapter) on potential environmental issues (particu-
larly for non-residential properties). Also, when the real estate market is 
active, appraisers can be backlogged and your appraisal delayed; your loan 
application won’t go far toward approval before the appraisal is complete.

227
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
No matter the size of your deal, negotiate the right to extend escrow. Some 
local Realtor boards have even developed a separate addendum that provides 
for extensions under certain conditions in order to enhance the likelihood of 
the transaction’s completion. These extensions usually provide for an initial 
14-day extension at no cost if the closing is delayed due to issues beyond the 
buyer’s control. However, additional extensions are typically only allowed if 
the buyer compensates the seller for the equivalent of the seller’s mortgage 
payment and/or her lost rental income if the property is vacant.
Conducting Formal Due Diligence
 
The formal due diligence period (the time period between the acceptance of an 
offer and the close of escrow or completion of the sale), is the time to ask 
those tough questions. Don’t be shy. Talk to the tenants, the neighbors, any 
homeowner’s or commercial association, governmental agencies, and the con-
tractors or suppliers to the property, and be sure that you know what you’re 
getting. Communicate regularly and work closely with the seller and his repre-
sentatives, but only rely on information provided in writing. This time period 
may be your best or only opportunity to seek adjustments, if important issues 
have been misrepresented. After the property sale is completed, it’s too late 
to ask the seller to fix the leaky roof.
Practical examples of due diligence include collecting economic data about 
the region and neighborhood, calling competitive properties for current 
market rental rates and concessions, verifying the accuracy of the financial 
information and leases presented by the seller, and conducting a thorough 
physical inspection of the property by a licensed general contractor or prop-
erty inspector. Although you may have completed some of these items before 
presenting your initial offer (see Chapter 12), some of the information may 
have only become apparent from a review of the seller’s actual books and 
records plus the unlimited access to the property that’s generally only avail-
able during the formal due diligence.
 
Don’t underestimate the importance of this step — this review of the books 
and records, along with the physical inspection, reveals the actual operations 
of the property and allows you to determine whether the property is suitable, 
fairly priced, and meets your financial goals. The due diligence period is your 
last chance to decide whether you should complete the transaction or cancel 
the escrow, get your money back, and search for a new possible acquisition.
Reviewing the books and records
Although savvy real estate investors conduct pre-offer due diligence and 
often receive a copy of a pro forma operating statement, you likely won’t 
have an opportunity to review the actual books and records until you’re 

228
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
formally under contract and in the due diligence period. Here are some 
things to make sure you have on hand before the deal is final:
 
✓ Seller-verified income and expense statement for at least the past 12 
months: The actual income and expense history reveals any surprises 
that may not have been obvious from the pro forma statement you 
received from the seller. The best source of this information is the seller’s 
Schedule E from her federal tax return — you can be fairly comfortable 
that she’s unlikely to overstate income or understate expenses to the IRS! 
After you have the most accurate numbers, you may find that the prop-
erty has a serious problem with collections, or your anchor tenant’s suite 
has several large refrigerator units tied to your common electric house 
meter. This statement also gives you a good idea of where to look for 
opportunities to improve on the financial performance of the property.
 
✓ Seller-verified rent roll: A rent roll is a list of all rental units with the 
tenant name, move-in date, lease expiration date, current and market 
rent, and the security deposit. Also, get a seller statement that no undis-
closed verbal agreements, concessions, or side agreements have been 
made with any tenant regarding the rent or security deposits.
 
✓ Seller-verified list of all tenant security deposits on hand: When 
acquiring a new rental property, follow state or local laws in properly 
handling the tenant’s security deposit. Many state laws require the seller 
and/or purchaser of a rental property to advise the tenants in writing of 
the status of their deposit. The law usually gives the seller the right to 
either return the deposit to the tenant or transfer it to the new owner.
 
 If the seller refunds the security deposits, you have the challenge of col-
lecting deposits from tenants already in possession of the rental unit or 
suite, which is never easy. For this reason, strongly urge the seller to 
provide you a credit for the full amount of the security deposits on hand 
in escrow and have each tenant agree in writing to the amount of the 
security deposit transferred during the sale. This strategy streamlines 
the process and prevents you from having to recollect security deposits 
from current tenants. To avoid problems at the time of move-out, send 
your tenant a letter confirming the security deposit amount.
 
✓ Copies of the entire tenant file of each current tenant: Make sure you 
have the rental application, current and past leases or rental agree-
ments, all legal notices, maintenance work orders, and correspondence 
for every tenant. Also, insist that the seller advise you in writing about 
any pending legal action involving your tenant’s occupancy.
 
✓ Copies of every service agreement or contract: Review all current con-
tractors and service providers the current owner uses (maintenance, 
landscaping, pest control, boiler maintenance, and so on). If you plan to 
terminate the services of a contractor or service provider, the seller may 
be willing to send a written conditional notice of termination indicating 
that, if the property sells as planned, that contractor’s services will no 
longer be needed as of the close of escrow. You can then find new contrac-
tors or maybe even renegotiate better terms with the current company.

 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
✓ Copies of all required governmental licenses and permits: In many 
areas, rental property owners are now required to have business 
licenses, certificates, or permits. Contact the appropriate governmen-
tal office in writing and make sure that they’re properly notified of the 
change in ownership and/or billing address. Often these governmental 
entities have stiff penalties if you fail to notify them of a change in own-
ership in a timely manner. And they’ll eventually discover the change in 
ownership, because they usually monitor the local recording of deeds 
and receive notification of changes in billing responsibility from local 
utility companies. Make sure that you have current copies of all state 
and local rental laws and ordinances that affect your rental property.
 
✓ Comprehensive list of all personal property included in the purchase: 
This inventory may include appliances, equipment, and supplies owned 
by the current property owner. Remember: Don’t assume anything is 
included in the sale unless you have it in writing.
 
✓ Copies of the latest utility billing: Get all of the account and payment 
information for every utility provider, which may include electricity, 
natural gas, water/sewer, trash collection, telephone, cable, and Internet 
access. Prior to the close of escrow, contact each company and arrange 
for the transfer of utilities or a change in the billing responsibility as of 
the estimated escrow closing date. If provided with sufficient advance 
notice, many utility companies can have the meters read and/or the bill-
ing cutoff coincide with the close of escrow, preventing the need to pro-
rate any of the utility billings between the owners.
 
 Also find out whether the seller has any deposits on hand with the util-
ity company and whether you need to place a deposit for service. You 
may be able to simply handle the transfer of the deposit through escrow 
with a written deposit transfer acknowledgment from the utility.
 
 If a review of the property expenses indicates that utility costs are 
unusually high, you may want to insist on reviewing copies of the actual 
historical bills in order to determine whether there was a one-time vari-
ance or whether the property may benefit from conservation efforts.
 
✓ Copy of the seller’s current insurance policy (if available) and the loss 
history: One of the most important steps in the takeover of your new 
rental property is securing insurance coverage. Make sure that you have 
the proper insurance policy in place at the time that you legally become 
the new owner. Most lenders won’t fund your loan until they have writ-
ten evidence that the property is adequately insured with policy limits in 
excess of their loan amount. Although the seller’s policy can’t protect you, 
request a copy of her policy or declaration of coverage and the loss his-
tory, because this information can be helpful to your insurance broker or 
agent when analyzing the property to determine the proper coverage.
 
When you receive this information, verify the accuracy of all records. Most 
sellers are honest and don’t intentionally withhold information or fail to dis-
close important facts; but the old adage “buyer beware” is particularly true in 

230
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
the purchase of rental real estate. Questions and issues that are resolved at 
this time can eliminate unpleasant and contentious disagreements with your 
tenants in the future. The takeover of your new rental property can be chaotic, 
but don’t fall into the trap of just verbally verifying the facts. Verify all infor-
mation in writing and set up a detailed filing system for your new property. 
Ultimately, the best proof of the expenses is to insist on receiving copies of 
last year’s invoices to verify operating costs such as utilities.
 
With experience, you’ll be able to evaluate a property with surprising accu-
racy just by looking at the actual income and expenses. Look for discrepancies 
between the pro forma operating statement given to you during pre-offer due 
diligence and the actual income and expense numbers provided by the seller 
during escrow due diligence. There are many tricks that sellers and their bro-
kers try to get past the unwary buyer. For example, watch for property tax 
numbers that will significantly increase upon a sale of the property if such 
taxes are based on the market value of a property or sales price. Also, be care-
ful if the rent roll lists vacant units at higher market-rent rates that exceed the 
actual rental rate for the occupied units.
Inspecting the property
 
The condition of a property directly affects its value. The prudent real estate 
investor always insists on a thorough physical inspection before purchasing 
an investment property even if the property is brand new.
Your new investment property may look good on paper and your pre-offer 
due diligence may reveal no legal or financial issues or concerns. But your 
investment is only as good as the weakest link, and a physically troubled 
property is never a good investment (unless you’re buying the property for 
the land and plan to demolish the current buildings).
 
You’re probably making one of the biggest financial purchases and commit-
ments of your life. Though real estate investors by nature tend to be frugal, 
never try to save money by foregoing a proper physical inspection by quali-
fied experts. Unless you have extensive experience as a builder and contrac-
tor, you probably have no idea what you’re getting into when it comes to 
evaluating the condition of most building systems. But even if you have experi-
ence, never rely on your own inspection entirely or try to save money by cut-
ting corners. Even experienced and fully qualified real estate investors can 
find their judgment tainted by an emotional attachment to the property.
Our experience shows that an inspection usually pays for itself. Inevitably, 
you’re going to find items that the seller needs to correct that are greater in 
value or cost to repair than the nominal sum you spend on the inspection. 
This value isn’t just a marketing ploy by inspection firms, but it also isn’t a 
game that you “win” if you can offset the inspection cost by finding enough 
items that the seller must correct or provide credit in escrow for — as some 

231
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
real estate gurus seem to believe. Instead, the inspection is a serious matter 
and not just a way to squeeze more from the seller.
The best result is if the inspection reveals no problems. Although you’ve 
spent money, what a great relief to know that your property (at least at the 
time of the inspection) is in good condition. That doesn’t mean there won’t 
be items in the future, possibly the very near future, that need attention. 
In Robert’s early days in real estate investing, he worked for an apartment 
developer whose favorite saying was “To own is to maintain!”
 
Virtually all real estate purchase contracts provide that the transaction can be 
canceled without penalty or loss of the earnest money deposit if the buyer’s 
physical inspection isn’t satisfactory. But often, additional negotiations 
between the buyer and seller result. It’s this competently prepared written 
inspection report that provides the information you need and serves as the 
basis to go back and ask the property seller to fix the problems or reduce the 
property’s purchase price (see the “Negotiating Credits in Escrow” section 
later in the chapter).
Savvy real estate investors actually have a two-step inspection process 
with their initial pre-offer walk-through of the property as a prelude to even 
making the offer. If the offer is made and accepted, the professional inspec-
tion is to identify any deal-killer problems with the property or any items that 
warrant renegotiation. You’re looking for two types of defects:
 
✓ Patent defects: Defects that are readily visible by simply looking at the 
property. Patent defects may be a broken window or a leaking faucet.
 
✓ Latent defects: Hidden and hard-to-see defects that require intrusive 
or even destructive testing. Examples include corroding copper pipes 
underneath the slab or ceiling or window leaks that the owner has cos-
metically repaired through patching and painting to hide from potential 
buyers. That is why disclosures are so important.
Disclosure requirements
With purchases of a residential rental property with four or fewer units, 
many states have seller disclosure requirements: Sellers must provide the 
buyer with a written transfer-disclosure statement that outlines all known 
structural and mechanical deficiencies. In many areas, sellers must also com-
plete a comprehensive information questionnaire. The agents, if any, for both 
parties also complete a written disclosure indicating that they’ve made a rea-
sonably diligent visual inspection of the interior and exterior of the property.
 
However, investors purchasing residential investment properties with five or 
more units or any type of commercial property typically don’t have the same 
legislative protections. This discrepancy is based on the premise that these 
buyers and sellers and their respective agents are more sophisticated and 
don’t need the mandatory protections of a formal written transfer disclosure 
statement (commonly abbreviated as TDS form).

232
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Whether the transfer disclosure statement form is legally required or not, 
sellers in some states still have a legal duty to disclose any and all material 
facts that could impact the value or intended use of the property. For exam-
ple, if the property had severe roof leaks last winter and the roof hasn’t been 
competently repaired, the seller must disclose this fact. Even if the roof had 
major leaks and was professionally repaired, an ethical seller will disclose 
this fact and provide you with a copy of the invoice outlining the specific 
work done and the individual or firm that performed the repairs.
The as-is gambit
Some sellers attempt to avoid any disclosures by proposing that their property 
is being sold to you strictly on an as-is and where-is basis. The theory (which is 
supported by many late-night real estate gurus when they’re the seller) is that 
an as-is sale means that the seller isn’t required to correct any deficiencies in 
the property before the completion of the sale and they’re not responsible for 
any issues that arise after the sale. They erroneously believe that such terms are 
legally enforceable under all conditions and act as a blanket disclaimer against 
claims of misrepresentation, fraud, or negligence. However, in most areas of the 
country, the as-is strategy only offers minimal protection to the seller.
 
Be extremely careful if considering the purchase of a property offered on an 
as-is basis. An as-is property is a major red flag; you should sincerely consider 
whether it’s worth the increased risk. Although the seller may simply be 
Tactics sellers use to avoid inspections
Unscrupulous sellers use several tricks to avoid 
the scrutiny of a thorough and detailed prop-
erty inspection. One angle is to offer the buyer 
a warranty or property protection plan that 
provides repair services for the major systems 
and appliances of the property. These options 
are typically only offered for rental homes 
and condos or small residential properties 
and aren’t acceptable in lieu of an inspection. 
Actually, these plans don’t make much sense 
at all, because even for a single rental unit or 
home they cost several hundred dollars upfront, 
plus there is a deductible of $25 to $100 every 
time you make a claim.
Or some sellers tell you that they’ve already had 
an inspection report prepared — so you don’t 
need to take this step. This assertion is the 
seller’s attempt to control the inspection pro-
cess while claiming to be interested in saving 
you time and money by providing you with a 
copy of an inspection report that they autho-
rized through an inspector of their choice. It 
doesn’t hurt to review this report and give a 
copy to your inspection team, but never accept 
a seller’s inspection report as your only source 
of information. When a seller hires an inspector, 
she may hire someone who isn’t diligent or criti-
cal of the property. Also, beware of inspectors 
who are popular with real estate agents. They 
may be popular because they fail to document 
all the problems.

233
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
following the ill-advised recommendations of their broker or seminar speaker, 
some sellers are dishonest and hide significant issues that reduce the proper-
ty’s true value. A property offered on an as-is basis significantly below the 
expected market value is rarely a good deal.
Likewise, when you’re selling your investment property, don’t attempt to 
hide behind the as-is language. This technique isn’t effective and hurts 
your reputation as a real estate investor. Our advice, regardless of any legal 
requirements, is to disclose, disclose, disclose. Fully document all disclosures 
in writing, with copies of any invoices or reports, because failure to disclose 
material facts that affect the value or use of the property is a serious issue 
and one that often finds its way to the courthouse for resolution.
Types of inspections
If you can get full access to the property, go ahead and conduct your own 
brief physical inspection before making your offer. This initial overview 
doesn’t cost anything other than your time and keeps you from wasting 
further time on properties that have obvious major problems. But this walk-
through is no substitute for a professional inspection.
 
Don’t rush the inspection process. The seller must give you complete and 
unfettered access to the entire property. Don’t agree to any unreasonable time 
or access limitations. We’ve seen sneaky sellers who unrealistically limit 
access to the property, particularly if it’s occupied. Make sure that the tenants 
have been properly notified, as required by law and/or their lease agreements, 
with a liberal access time period so that you can thoroughly conduct all of 
your inspections without interference or interruptions.
There are generally three types of professional inspections performed 
during the due diligence period while your property is in escrow, and we just 
happen to cover them in the following sections.
Physical or structural inspection
Naturally, you as the buyer want to have all of the physical aspects of the 
structures on your property inspected. However, your lender may also 
require you to pay for a separate physical inspection report by a firm of its 
choice. This stipulation is typical only for large residential and commercial 
types of properties.
 
You can also have your architect inspect the property and determine any 
changes of use or modernization that will enhance the property. Because the 
key to success in real estate is in creating value, a professional architect can 
be an invaluable team member who can offer many suggestions. Of course, 
she can also quickly tell you that your plans aren’t structurally or fiscally fea-
sible, and you can move on to another potential property.
Areas that you want to hire people to help you inspect include

234
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Overall condition of property
 
✓ Structural integrity
 
✓ Foundation, crawl space, basements, subflooring, and decks
 
✓ Roof and attic
 
✓ Plumbing systems, including fixtures, supply lines, drains, and water 
heating devices
 
✓ Electrical systems, including all service panels and ground-fault circuit-
interrupters (GFCI)
 
✓ Heating and air conditioning
 
✓ Landscaping, irrigation, and drainage
 
✓ Doorways, walls, and windows
 
✓ Moisture intrusion
 
✓ Seismic, land movement, or subsidence (sinking) and flood risk
 
✓ Illegal construction or additions and zoning violations
 
Some specific telltale signs indicate the property may have serious structural 
issues and require further investigation:
 
✓ Cracks: Look at the entire property, including foundation, walls, ceilings, 
window and door frames, chimney, and any retaining walls, for cracks. 
Don’t let the seller or her agent tell you these cracks are merely settle-
ment cracks; let your qualified property inspector or other qualified pro-
fessional make that determination. A few isolated hairline cracks may be 
naturally occurring settlement of the structure over time, but if you can 
stick a screwdriver into the crack, something else is going on.
 
✓ Unleveled or squishy floors: As you walk through the property, pay 
attention to any slant or sloping of the floors. Also watch for any soft 
spots in the flooring on upper levels, including the ground floor if the 
property has a raised foundation with a crawl space or basement.
 
✓ Misaligned structure: Buy one of those handy laser levels and walk 
through the property looking for floors, walls, and ceilings that are 
uneven or out of plumb. Another sign of misalignment is when doors 
or windows stick and don’t open or close easily (although that can also 
happen from being painted shut).
 
✓ Soil issues: Excess groundwater, poor drainage, or cracked/bulging 
retaining walls or concrete hardscape can be signs of soil issues such 
as slope failure or ground subsidence that requires inspection by a civil 
or soils engineer. Be sure that the property drains properly and that all 
drains are properly installed and maintained.
 
✓ Moisture intrusion: Look for current and historical indications of leaks 
such as discoloration and stains on ceilings, walls, and particularly 

235
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
around window and door frames. Musty odors or the smell of mold may 
be merely stale air or poor housekeeping, or they may indicate ongoing 
moisture issues. Sump pumps anywhere on the property are a red flag 
that should be explored in detail.
 
✓ Plumbing leaks: Have a qualified plumbing contractor or other expert 
check all possible sources of leaks or moisture — under sinks, supply 
lines for faucets, toilets, dishwashers, and washing machines, plus roofs, 
windows, sprinklers, and drainage away from the building.
 
 Don’t buy a property with the polybutylene domestic water supply sys-
tems (Qest was the most widely known brand). The track record for 
these products hasn’t been acceptable. Many properties experienced an 
extremely high rate of failure that resulted in class-action lawsuits and 
settlement funds for redoing these plumbing-affected properties.
 
Carefully inspect for any signs of water intrusion. Allegations of property 
damage and serious negative health effects from resulting environmental 
toxins and mold are a real problem for both residential and commercial rental 
property owners throughout the country.
And to minimize the chance of having to deal with unpleasant calls from 
tenants in the middle of the night, we strongly advise that you immediately 
install steel-braided supply lines on all water sources — including sinks, toi-
lets, and washing machines. Also, make sure to check that sink and bathtub 
overflows are properly connected.
Pest control and property damage
Pest control firms are the natural choice for this type of inspection, but what 
they inspect is actually more than just infestations by termites, carpenter 
ants, powder post beetles, and other wood-destroying insects. A thorough 
pest control and property damage inspection also looks at property damage 
caused by organisms that infect and incessantly break down and destroy 
wood and other building materials. These conditions are commonly referred 
to as dry rot, but ironically they’re actually a fungus that requires moisture to 
flourish.
The report you receive from your pest control and property damage inspec-
tor usually includes a simple diagram of the property with notations as to 
the location of certain conditions noted. Some require attention immediately; 
others are simply areas to watch in the future:
 
✓ Part I items: The most serious problems are infestations or infections 
that must be dealt with at once to protect the structure from serious 
damage. These recommendations may also include the repair and 
replacement of compromised structural elements. Unless otherwise 
agreed, the seller is virtually always required to pay for this work. Your 
lender won’t fund the property loan until a professional pest control 
firm and/or licensed contractor completes such required work.

236
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Part II items: These items are recommended but not required work; as a 
prudent real estate investor, you’ll address them yourself right after the 
close of escrow or will require the seller to take care of them before com-
pleting the purchase. These items may not be a current structural defi-
ciency that endangers the property or occupants, but if not corrected, 
they may cost substantially more to repair in the future. If not resolved 
now, these conditions will continue to fester and develop into required 
items that must be addressed when you sell the property later on.
Environmental issues
For commercial and residential rental investment properties with five or 
more units, a lender usually requires a phase I environmental report, which 
reviews the property records for the site, including all prior uses of the prop-
erty and aerial photographs.
 
Review the report prepared for the lender at your expense, and make sure 
that there are no surprises. Only purchase properties if they have a clear envi-
ronmental report, regardless of the price. The downside of environmentally 
challenged properties is so significant that you should obtain the phase I envi-
ronmental report even if you’re purchasing the property for cash.
Most properties don’t have problems, and the phase I report is all that is 
required. But Robert has had clients whose purchase came to a complete 
halt over something as simple as crankcase oil in the dumpster area of an 
apartment building. Such a condition results in a negative phase I report, 
making further investigation and remediation necessary. Problems found in 
the phase I report can be ridiculously expensive and cause delays of several 
weeks or even months while additional testing and analysis takes place, a 
phase II report is prepared, and contractors complete the required work per 
the specifications outlined by the environmental engineers.
 
Also be extremely careful when purchasing commercial, retail, and industrial 
properties, particularly if they have certain types of tenants, such as dry 
cleaners, photographers, and any industrial tenants that use petroleum sol-
vents. Watch out for any property, and especially vacant spaces, sporting the 
ubiquitous 55-gallon drums.
Have an environmental engineer check drains that connect to the storm 
drain system or sewer to ensure that toxic or hazardous materials haven’t 
been disposed of through your proposed property. If the EPA or comparable 
state agency later determines that the source of the contaminants was your 
property, you could face a budget-busting cleanup bill. The governmental 
agencies don’t care that these violations occurred under prior ownership.
Lenders are extremely concerned about making a loan on a property with 
the potential for environmental hazards. They know that many buyers would 
simply walk away from the property and leave them with the devastating cost 

237
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
of cleaning up the property. That’s why most lenders now require buyers to 
remain personally responsible for environmental issues even if the loan is 
nonrecourse (the lender can only foreclose on the underlying property in the 
event of a default). This provision is commonly referred to as a carve-out and 
is designed to protect the lender from owners who may be tempted to bail 
out and leave the lender on the hook for a contaminated property.
Qualifying the inspectors
Just like selecting the closing agent, many real estate investors pick inspec-
tors as an afterthought or simply take the recommendation of their real estate 
agent. But inspect the property inspectors before you hire one. As with other 
service professionals, interview a few inspectors before making your selection. 
You may find that they don’t all share the same experience, qualifications, 
and ethical standards. For example, don’t hire an inspector that hesitates or 
refuses to allow you to accompany her during the inspection.
 
The inspection is actually a unique opportunity for most property owners and, 
because you’re paying, we strongly recommend that you join the inspector 
while he’s assessing your proposed purchase. What you learn can be invalu-
able and may pay dividends throughout your entire ownership. When an 
unscrupulous contractor later tries to tell you that you need to completely 
replumb your property, you can tell him to get lost if your property inspection 
revealed only isolated problems that can be resolved inexpensively.
 
There is virtually no governmental licensing or supervision of inspectors. 
Every real estate investor needs to look out for his or her own interests and 
look for telltale signs of potential problems. Red flags include inspectors that 
are affiliated with a contractor, offer a special discount if you call who they 
recommend, or credit their inspection fee toward work.
Only consider full-time, professional inspectors. Hire an inspector who per-
forms at least 100 comprehensive inspections per year and carries errors and 
omissions insurance. Such coverage isn’t cheap and is another key indicator 
that the person is working full-time in the field and is participating in ongoing 
continuing education.
 
Many inspectors are licensed general contractors, but not all home inspectors 
have designations or credentials specifically relating to inspecting real estate. 
One of the best certifying trade associations for professional property inspec-
tors is the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). In addition to home 
inspections, many ASHI members are qualified and experienced enough to 
assist you with your due diligence physical or structural exterior and interior 
inspection of multifamily residential properties and all types of commercial 
properties. You can find certified inspectors and more info about the inspec-
tion process including tips and checklists at www.ashi.org.

238
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
Some individuals or companies adopt names that at first glance may indicate 
adherence to certain professional practices. For example, a fictitious but 
potentially misleading name is “Professional Property Inspection Association.” 
Do some research to find the best state or regional association and one whose 
qualified members adopt a code of ethics. For example, in California, the 
California Real Estate Inspection Association (CREIA) is the group that offers 
education and designations for real estate inspectors.
Review a copy of inspectors’ résumés to see what certifications and licenses 
they hold. A general contractor’s license and certification as a property 
inspector are important, but also find out whether they’ve had any special-
ized training and whether they hold any specific sublicenses in areas such as 
roofing, electrical, or plumbing. These can be particularly important if your 
proposed property has evidence of potential problems in any of these areas. 
For example, if a property has a history of roofing or moisture intrusion prob-
lems, an inspector who’s a general contractor and roofer is an extra plus.
The inspection report must be written, and to avoid surprises, request a 
sample of one of the recent inspection reports that have been prepared for 
a comparable property. This simple request may eliminate several potential 
inspectors but is essential so that you can see whether an inspector is quali-
fied and how detailed a report he will prepare for you. A simple check-the-
box form may suffice for a single-family rental home or condo, but for larger 
properties, the more detail, the better. Check out Figures 14-1 and 14-2 for a 
sample interior inspection checklist.
 
The advent of digital photography is a boon to property inspectors and makes 
their sometimes mundane and difficult-to-understand reports come to life. 
Select a technologically savvy inspector and require her to electronically send 
you her report, including digital photos documenting all of the conditions 
noted. With the report in the electronic realm, it’s a simple process to e-mail 
this information as needed.
Although the cost of the inspection should be set and determined in advance, 
the price should be a secondary concern because inspection fees often pay 
for themselves. Just like many other professional services, there is a direct 
correlation between the pricing of your inspection and the amount of time 
the inspector takes to conduct the inspection and then prepare the report. If 
the inspector only spends a couple of hours at your new 20-unit apartment 
building, whatever you pay her is too much.
Finally, require the finalists to provide the names and phone numbers of 
three people who used the company’s services within the past six months. 
Make sure that these clients were satisfied and that the inspector acted pro-
fessionally and ethically.

 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
Negotiating Credits in Escrow
Most purchase agreements require the seller to deliver the property in good 
physical condition with all basic systems in operational order unless oth-
erwise indicated. But the inspection process often reveals deficiencies that 
need to be corrected. For example, the physical and structural inspection by 
the property inspector may indicate the need to repair a defective ground-
fault circuit-interrupter (GFCI), or the pest control and property damage 
report may show evidence of drywood termites that need to be eradicated.
So with your inspection reports in hand, preferably with digital photos, 
you’re prepared to contact the seller’s representative(s) and arrange for the 
seller to correct the noted items at his expense. The seller may debate some 
of the items and claim that the property is being sold as-is even if he didn’t 
previously indicate any such thing. Be prepared to refer him to the warranty 
of condition clause in your copy of the purchase agreement; hopefully he 
takes care of the problems without any further grumbling or delay.
 
Some sellers and buyers actually prefer to handle deficiencies through a mone-
tary credit in escrow in favor of the buyer so that the buyer can make the 
needed repairs on his or her own. This route is particularly beneficial if you 
plan on making significant renovations to the property or the item is one of a 
personal nature — like the type and color of replacement carpet for a rental 
house. In that case, giving you a credit that you can use to pick the type, grade, 
and color of carpeting or even an entirely different type of floor covering that 
suits your needs is a sensible approach. The seller shouldn’t be concerned as 
long as the amount is equal or less than his cost to do the work; plus, the seller 
doesn’t have the hassle of coordinating the work or making payments.
 
Negotiating for repairs or monetary credits can be challenging, and knowing 
where to draw the line can be difficult. Requiring the seller to make needed 
repairs or give a credit in escrow is common in most transactions and fully 
accepted in the industry. But some buyers use the due diligence period to 
completely renegotiate the purchase agreement. They make a virtually full-
price offer with long contingency time frames for the physical inspection so 
they can keep the property off the market for an extended period. Then they 
have their inspection team scour the property looking for every single item 
that’s wrong so they can demand that the seller significantly lower the price. 
Because the buyer has the property tied up, the seller is unable to cancel 
escrow and move on to another, more reasonable buyer. This strategy may 
work once or twice but will quickly earn you a negative reputation among sell-
ers and agents. You may soon find it difficult to buy additional properties.

242
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
A buyer who receives a credit in escrow is often anxious to get started on 
making improvements to get the property in rent-ready condition immedi-
ately upon the close of escrow. Although tempting, you should be wary of 
making significant renovation or repairs to the property before the close of 
escrow. If the sale of the property doesn’t go through, you may have spent 
considerable sums to upgrade the seller’s property without any recourse.
 
As a buyer, use the escrow time period to your advantage and obtain all of 
your bids and proposals so that you’re ready to begin as soon as the escrow 
closes. We recommend that you formulate your renovations and marketing 
plan in advance, but only sign contracts that contain a contingency clause that 
the proposal is null and void if your transaction doesn’t go through, and only 
begin the actual work after you legally have title to the property.
Determining How to Hold Title
You must bear many issues in mind when deciding how to take title to your 
new investment property. Maintaining your privacy, minimizing your tax 
burden, and protecting your assets from claims and creditors are critical ele-
ments to most real estate investors. Take the time to evaluate and decide the 
most opportune way to take title to your property.
 
Don’t allow the form of ownership to be made as an afterthought! Many real 
estate investors don’t take this decision seriously and by default take title on 
the advice of their real estate agent or the closing agent. Sometimes the first 
discussion about how title will be taken is when it’s time to sign the docu-
ments and close escrow.
Of course, there’s no one single right answer to the question of how to hold 
title, because each real estate investor or investment group has different per-
spectives and needs. The legal forms of ownership vary from state to state, so 
check your options with the assistance of legal, accounting, and tax advisors. 
To make the best decision, you need the assistance of your real estate team 
(see Chapter 6). Consult with your tax advisor and attorney to understand the 
current ramifications as well as consider the impact on your estate planning 
needs and goals.
 
After reviewing the options of taking title and deciding which one is best for 
your proposed real estate investment, make sure that you inform your escrow 
officer so that the deed is properly prepared for your signature just before 
closing your escrow.
In the following sections, we review some of the basics of each form of 
ownership — including privacy, taxation, and protection considerations — 
so you can build a working understanding of the pros and cons of each of the 
primary alternatives available.

243
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
Sole proprietorship
 
A sole proprietorship is certainly the easiest and cheapest form of ownership 
and requires no special prerequisites. Simply have title to the property vested 
in the name of an individual person on the deed, and you have a sole propri-
etor. Other advantages include the following:
 
✓ Exclusive rights of ownership: You have sole discretion over the use of 
the property and the right to sell, bequeath, or encumber the property 
any way you see fit.
 
✓ Simple record keeping: That can be a negative if you aren’t disciplined.
 
However, sole proprietorship also has its downsides, including the following:
 
✓ Unlimited liabilities: You have absolutely no protections against law-
suits or other claims, and your name is easily obtained through public 
records. Other forms of ownership can create a barrier between you and 
claimants and creditors.
 
✓ No real tax advantages: Sole proprietorships offer no real advantages 
in the area of death and taxes! All income and expenses are reported 
directly on your personal tax return, and there is no preferential tax 
treatment or avoidance of the probate courts in the event of your death.
 
✓ Possible marriage complications: A sole proprietorship can become 
complicated if you’re married or later get married and intend to keep 
your investment property as a separately held asset. Check with your 
tax advisor before making any significant changes in your marital status 
because you need to keep detailed accounting records to avoid any 
commingling of funds from community property that could create an 
interest for a spouse in the real property.
Joint tenancy
Joint tenancy is a way in which two or more individuals may hold title to a 
property together where they own equal shares of the property. Joint ten-
ancy is only available to individuals (not legal corporate entities) because a 
unique feature of holding title in a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. 
Upon the death of one of the joint tenants, the entire ownership automati-
cally vests in equal shares to the surviving individual or individuals without 
going through the probate process.
In order to form a joint tenancy, there must be unity of time, title, interest, 
and possession. Unity of time means that all joint tenants must take title 
by the same deed at the same time. Another requirement is that each joint 
tenant own an equal interest or percentage of the property — so if you have 
two joint tenants, they each own 50 percent, whereas four joint tenants 

244
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
would each own 25 percent of the entire property. Any ownership of a prop-
erty in disproportionate shares can’t be a joint tenancy.
Each joint tenant is legally entitled to the right of possession and can’t be 
excluded by the others. Some states specifically require the joint tenancy 
deed to include the wording “joint tenants with right of survivorship.”
One concern is that joint tenants can sell, bequeath, or encumber their por-
tion of the property without the consent of the other owners. It’s possible for 
the joint tenancy to be terminated in the event of a judgment lien or bank-
ruptcy. Likewise, a new joint tenant can only be added by executing a new 
deed. Income and expenses from operations of the property are reported on 
each individual’s tax return.
 
Another unique advantage to joint tenancy, besides the right of survivorship, 
is that you get a stepped up basis on your deceased joint tenant’s portion of 
the property. Receiving a stepped up basis means that the taxable basis is 
increased for the portion of the property owned by the deceased joint tenant 
to the current market value at the time of death. This ability can be a tremen-
dous benefit for the surviving joint tenants and allows them to sell the prop-
erty with significantly lower taxes.
For example, suppose two joint tenants buy a property for $200,000. Many 
years later, one of the joint tenants dies, and the property is appraised at 
$300,000. The new adjusted basis for the surviving joint tenant is $250,000 rep-
resenting the original basis of $100,000 plus $150,000 (one half of $300,000) for 
the deceased joint tenant’s interest. This basis is important when calculating 
the gain or loss upon sale of the property, so having the basis increase can dra-
matically lower your taxable capital gain (see Chapter 18 for details).
Although marriage isn’t a requirement to use this method of holding title, tra-
ditionally, joint tenancy has been the most common way for married couples 
to hold title to investment properties. One of the primary advantages of joint 
tenancy is that the death of one spouse can result in a complete step up in 
basis to the fair market value at the time of death rather than just a step up 
for the portion owned by the deceased joint tenant. Depending where you 
reside, states have additional options for married couples, such as commu-
nity property or tenants by the entireties. See the “Community property and 
tenancy by entireties” sidebar in this chapter.
Tenancy in common
One of the most common forms of co-ownership is tenancy in common (also 
known as tenants in common or TIC). A tenancy in common is the ownership 
of real property in which several owners each own a stated portion or share 
of the entire property. In most states, if the deed is silent as to the form of 
ownership, tenancy in common is the presumed method of holding title.

245
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
Unlike joint tenancy, in a tenancy in common, each owner can own a differ-
ent percentage, can take title at any time, and can sell his interest at any 
time. Another distinguishing characteristic is that each owner has complete 
control over her portion of the property and can sell, bequeath, or mortgage 
her interest as she personally decides without any feedback from or recourse 
for the other owners. Further, upon her death, her share becomes part of her 
estate and can be willed as she sees fit.
Tenants in common products are now being aggressively touted by financial 
advisors as an investment product of choice for the owners of appreciated 
real estate who are looking for a more passive investment without the chal-
lenges of property management. These investments offer the investor a way 
to own fractionalized interests in real estate and can be structured as direct 
ownership of property with a deed for their interest, or many are actually 
security interests. The sponsored tenants in common products usually have 
a management agreement or governing document to address issues of con-
trol and avoid the problems discussed later in this chapter.
 
Tenancy in common is a popular way to hold title for real estate investors but 
can be a problem unless there are clear understandings, preferably in writing, 
as to the asset and property management decisions of operating the property. 
But even then, problems and challenges are possible:
 
✓ Death of an owner: You may find that a co-owner has left his interest in 
a property you partially own to someone that you don’t get along with.
Community property and tenancy by the entireties
Some states offer married couples an addi-
tional way to take title. The main advantage 
with community property is that both halves of 
your rental property receive a stepped up basis 
upon the death of one spouse. Also, because 
each community property spouse owns 50 per-
cent of the asset, they have the right to transfer 
their interest, by will or otherwise, to whom-
ever they want. Community property is avail-
able in Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and 
Wisconsin. Several of these states (Arizona, 
California, Nevada, and Wisconsin) are now 
offering a modified form called community 
property with right of survivorship, which adds 
the benefit of avoiding probate upon the death 
of a spouse.
The late real estate columnist Bob Bruss wrote 
about the benefits of another form of owner-
ship that applies only to husband and wife — 
tenancy by the entireties. It’s essentially the 
same as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship 
but can’t be terminated by one spouse alone 
and isn’t subject to a partition action. Tenancy 
by the entireties must be specified on the 
deed and is only allowed in Alaska, Arkansas, 
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, 
Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, 
New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, 
Virginia, and Wyoming.

246
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Sale by an owner: Because each owner has equal rights of control over 
the property, serious conflicts may arise when one owner wants to sell 
or borrow against the property. Or an owner may decide to sell to an 
individual or entity, which disrupts the spirit of cooperation among the 
various owners.
 
✓ Financial problems of an owner: You’re financially tied to your co-
owners for better or worse even in their activities other than the jointly 
owned property. A judgment against one of the co-owners could lead to 
the creditor foreclosing on that co-owner’s interest in the property to 
satisfy a monetary judgment. Or a bankruptcy by one co-owner could 
lead to the bankruptcy court ordering a forced sale of the property to 
satisfy the bankruptcy creditors unless the other co-owners were willing 
to pay off the creditors and buy out the financially challenged co-owner.
 
✓ Different plans: Each co-owner may have a different plan for the prop-
erty or the way it should be managed. With tenancy in common owner-
ship, absent a written governing document, there’s no majority rule or 
simple way to arbitrate differences in opinions and goals. Because a 
single owner can thwart the plans of all the others, disagreements about 
whether to borrow money by using the property as collateral or whether 
to sell the property can result in a legal action. Robert has served as a 
referee in several of these actions (called partitions), and they can be 
quite stressful for the parties — who can’t seem to agree on anything!
 
Income and expenses from operations of the property are reported on the 
individual’s tax return, but a problem with tenants in common is that new 
investors acquiring a TIC interest may not qualify for the tax-deferral benefits 
generally associated with a 1031 like-kind exchange. The promoters and spon-
sors of the TIC programs often portray these investments as the answer to all 
your needs, but in reality, they don’t always give you the full story. Buyer 
beware — before making any move, consult your tax advisor about the tax 
ramifications of selling appreciated real estate and investing the proceeds into 
a tenants in common or fractionized interest. Liquidity (ability to sell your 
interest) is also a concern because there are currently no public secondary 
markets for tenants in common interests. See our comments in Chapter 4, and 
remember: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!
Partnerships
A real estate partnership is a form of business enterprise in which two or 
more persons join together to pool their capital and talent to purchase, 
manage, and ultimately sell real estate. Investors in a real estate partnership 
don’t have actual title or ownership interest directly in the property but actu-
ally own a partnership interest.

247
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
Although a partnership interest technically is transferable, a partner seeking 
to sell will find few, if any, ready buyers and will likely have to severely dis-
count his asking price below its intrinsic value. The best option is to negotiate 
a buy/sell agreement in which the terms are thoroughly discussed and each 
partner has the ability to leave at any time based on predetermined criteria. 
Often, such agreements call for the other partners to purchase the outgoing 
partner’s share.
A partnership isn’t a corporation, and generally takes one of two forms:
 
✓ In a general partnership, each partner has the right to fully participate 
in the management and operations of the property and each partner is 
fully responsible for the debt, legal obligations, and any business losses 
incurred. General partnerships are easy to establish, but a serious con-
cern is that each individual partner is able to contract on behalf of the 
partnership and all partners are then legally liable for these actions. 
Another disadvantage of a general partnership is that the death, bank-
ruptcy, or withdrawal of one of the general partners may require the dis-
solution and complete reorganization of the general partnership.
 
✓ A limited partnership consists of one or more general partners along 
with one or more limited partners. The general partner (who can be an 
individual or a corporation) handles management and operations and has 
unlimited liabilities. The limited partners are restricted from participating 
in management and operations of the property and only have their actual 
cash investment at risk. Limited partnerships have been popular because 
they allow folks to invest relatively small amounts into larger real estate 
deals. Also, a limited partnership can continue on even if one of the part-
ners dies, files bankruptcy, withdraws, or sells his partnership share.
Partnerships have been a common and successful way for individuals to 
work together to purchase larger real estate investment properties. Often, 
they bring together individuals with complementary resources and skills. 
For example, a good partnership may include a real estate broker, a property 
manager, a real estate financial analyst, and a real estate lender. The comple-
mentary skills of this partnership offer insight into each phase of the invest-
ment. Often, one of the partners doesn’t have any real estate expertise or 
acumen, but instead provides a significant portion of the investment capital.
The expertise of the general partner can be an advantage of real estate partner-
ships over TICs, where the TIC governing documents typically provide that 
each owner can vote their proportionate share and the majority makes the 
decisions. The problem is that a collective majority in a TIC may not have the 
real estate experience to make the best decision. In a real estate partnership, 
the owners of minority interests often find they have little input into the major 
decisions of the partnership (such as refinancing and selling or exchanging the 
property). But this hands-off approach can actually be beneficial and a lot less 
stressful if the general partner is competent and knows what she’s doing.

248
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
From a taxation standpoint, real estate partnerships must prepare an IRS 
form 1065 tax return and pass through the respective share of all profits and 
losses and depreciation to each individual partner. Each partner then reports 
these numbers on her personal tax returns. At the time of death of a partner, 
there are several tax related issues concerning the handling of the partner-
ship interest, so consult a tax advisor.
Limited Liability Company
 
Now available in all 50 states, the Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a rela-
tively new hybrid form of doing business that combines characteristics of a 
partnership and a corporation. This setup is an unbeatable combination for 
many real estate investors and a great way to hold title to real estate hold-
ings. LLCs have essentially replaced corporations and partnerships as the 
Examining private placement partnerships
Most real estate partnerships that seek a 
broader participation abide by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, 
which outline and control the process of raising 
capital through solicitation. In order to avoid the 
stringent public disclosure regulations required 
of public offerings, real estate partnerships 
are often organized under the simpler private 
placement rules, and are thus known as private 
placement partnerships.
An offering to invest in a real estate partnership 
would qualify as a private placement as long as 
the organizers follow the requirements of the 
SEC’s Regulation D. Each state also has specific 
legal requirements about raising money from 
investors located in that state, with detailed 
provisions to qualify for a Blue Sky exemption 
that allows the sponsor of the private place-
ment to avoid the strict formation requirements 
and ongoing reporting of public offerings. One 
example is that there may be limits to the total 
number of investors, or requirements that the 
sponsor have a preexisting relationship with the 
investor. Also, there are different rules for each 
of the proposed participants who meet the cri-
teria to qualify as an accredited investor, which 
means that they have significant net worth. The 
SEC wants to make sure that the individuals 
being solicited for these private partnerships 
have the experience and skills available to 
evaluate these complicated and essentially 
illiquid investments. When raising money from 
multiple investors, consult with legal counsel 
and tax advisors who are familiar with both 
federal and state laws concerning private and 
public offerings.
We strongly advise novice real estate investors 
to avoid any attempt at forming private place-
ment partnerships for investing in real estate. 
Should you be successful investing at a smaller 
scale, you may find such investment alternatives 
attractive. But there are many pitfalls for the 
inexperienced; you should only consider larger 
partnerships when you’re able to make the full-
time commitment to real estate investing, and 
then you should consult with experienced real 
estate and legal experts at every step.

249
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
most common way to hold title to real estate because they offer the advan-
tages of allowing each member to have a say in the management while 
extending limited liability to all members, without the burden of double taxa-
tion (where the profits of the corporation are first taxed at the corporate 
level, and then the profits distributed to individual shareholders are taxed 
again on their personal returns).
An LLC is a separate entity like a corporation and therefore carries liability 
protection for all of its members, but it can be structured like a partner-
ship so that the taxation flows through to each member individually. This 
feature simply requires the LLC to declare itself a joint venture with the IRS 
and indicate how it wants to allocate the taxation of income and expenses. 
Like a partnership, an LLC is required to prepare and file an IRS Form 1065, 
Partnership Tax Return, unless it makes the joint venture election.
 
Check with your own tax advisor, but many advisors recommend that their 
clients use a Limited Liability Company because it offers the best of both 
worlds — limited liability plus favorable and simplified tax treatment. Every 
state has its own requirements. Contact an attorney to have her prepare the 
Articles of Organization and an Operating Agreement (which are usually filed 
with the secretary of state).
The owners of an LLC are called members and can be virtually any entity, 
including individuals, partnerships, trusts, corporations, pension plans, or 
even other LLCs. Typically, LLCs have multiple members that can own differ-
ent percentages; however, virtually all states permit single-member LLCs (but 
not without some potential issues with the IRS that you should discuss with 
your tax advisor in advance). Fortunately, a husband and wife are considered 
two members when forming an LLC.
 
Despite all these advantages, seek the counsel of an attorney who specializes 
in the formation of LLCs to give you help with the following issues:
 
✓ IRS limitations: IRS regulations have some limitations on the charac-
teristics of the LLC. An attorney can advise you on the best structure 
to establish — one that emphasizes the importance of limited liability 
and centralized management while foregoing continuity of life and easy 
transferability of interests. In addition to filing a partnership tax return 
with the IRS, most states also require an annual report of activity along 
with filing fees, withholding, or even franchise fees; however, most 
states don’t have any minimum charges.
 
✓ Costs: The costs can be much greater than for other forms of ownership. 
Be sure to consult with a local tax advisor for details on the typical costs 
for operating an LLC in your state. Currently, the highest base cost for 
an LLC is found in California: a minimum franchise tax fee of $800 per 
year plus additional taxes based on gross receipts.

Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
Corporations
A partnership consists of people, but a corporation is a legal entity owned by 
one or more shareholders. The most well-known form that corporations take 
is that of public corporations like General Electric and Microsoft, which have 
shares traded on a stock exchange. Real estate investors can also create their 
own private or closely held corporations to own real estate.
A real estate investor can establish a corporation by filing articles of incor-
poration and bylaws with the appropriate state agency, usually the secretary 
of state’s office. Corporate requirements vary from state to state, so consult 
your tax and legal advisors prior to implementing a corporate form of owner-
ship for real estate assets. Nevada and Delaware are two of the more popular 
states in which to incorporate, but your legal and tax advisors can tell you if 
these states provide any advantages for your personal situation. Typically, 
you’re best off to incorporate in your state of residence.
 
The appeal for real estate investors to form a corporation is that there is lim-
ited liability for shareholders. The owners of a corporation actually own stock, 
which is personal property. Thus, when corporations own real estate, the 
shareholders don’t actually own the real estate. They own shares of stock in 
the entity that legally owns the property. Therefore, the most a shareholder 
can lose is her equity investment.
 
A disadvantage for many real estate investors is the initial expense to have an 
attorney draft the organizational documents. Then there are the costs to 
cover the rather extensive reporting requirements at both the state and fed-
eral level to maintain their corporate status. If the corporation isn’t sufficiently 
capitalized or fails to meet all of the detailed organizational and reporting 
requirements, creditors or lien holders can pierce the corporate veil and seek 
personal liability for individual shareholders.
There are two types of corporations available:
 
✓ C Corporation: Although C Corporations (the most well-known and 
popular type of corporation) have the advantage of continuity of life in 
the event a shareholder dies, their downside is the double taxation of 
profits. Another negative is that if the corporation has losses, it has to 
carry them over to the next tax year because the shareholders can’t use 
C Corporation losses on their personal returns.
 
✓ S Corporation: A primary benefit of this type of corporation is the abil-
ity to avoid double taxation by passing through the profits and losses 
directly to the individual shareholders. But S Corporations are rarely 
used in the ownership of real estate because their primary disadvantage 
is that a liquidation of the S Corporation is a taxable event. So even if 
the shareholders of the S Corporation can agree to an equitable distri-
bution of the assets, the IRS deems the liquidation as taxable and the 
shareholders must pay capital gains taxes and possibly sell some of the 

251
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
assets. (Note that in a liquidation of an LLC, the assets may be distrib-
uted to the members without a taxable event occurring.) There is also 
difficulty for shareholders that aren’t involved in the day-to-day opera-
tions. The IRS requires material participation (an IRS term that indicates 
whether an investor worked and was involved in a business activity on a 
regular basis) for the realization of tax benefits.
 
Only consider using a corporation to hold your real estate assets if you’re 
willing to pay for the professional, legal, and accounting advice upfront and 
on a continuing basis to make sure that the protections of limited liability 
can’t be violated. Although corporations have some inherent advantages, the 
drawback of double taxation and the ongoing technical requirements and 
expense to maintain the corporate status make corporations unsuitable for 
the average real estate investor.
Closing the Transaction
The closing of escrow is the consummation of the real estate transaction and 
the goal of the buyer, the seller, the brokers, and all the other professionals 
who were part of the effort. It’s the culmination of numerous individual acts 
and of often constant negotiation right up until the last moment. The closing 
of escrow occurs only when all conditions of the escrow instructions and 
purchase agreement are fulfilled, including any funding of the loan. Quite a 
few details must come together before the escrow officer can actually close 
the transaction and record the deed.
The actual process or formalities of closing the escrow are handled in differ-
ent ways throughout the country. Some areas bring all the parties together; 
an attorney acts as the closing agent, and funds are transferred among the 
parties after all the documents have been signed and notarized. Your escrow 
officer is at the center of activity as the essential elements come together to 
make your goal of purchasing an investment property a reality. Your team of 
inspectors, appraisers, lenders, and attorneys all have roles in completing 
the due diligence required to ensure that there are no surprises with your 
potential new property acquisition.
 
However, there are still a few more fundamental items and details that need to 
be addressed as you wind down the escrow before you can call the property 
your own. Snags are still possible, so keep an eye out for the following:
 
✓ Lender requests: You need to make sure that you’re in contact with 
your lender to avoid any last minute snafus. Lenders are notorious for 
needing just one more signature or asking questions at the last minute 
about the source of your down payment. These questions aren’t as 
random as they may seem and are usually brought up by the loan com-
mittee or final person who must sign off on your loan.

252
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
✓ Document errors: Don’t assume the documents are correct. Robert com-
pleted a large refinance loan of a commercial property, and while proof-
reading the lender-prepared documents, he noted that they contained 
several mistakes, including an incorrect loan amortization term.
 
✓ Availability of parties and busy periods: You need to be available to 
review and sign the loan documents, so let the lender or your mortgage 
broker know if you’re planning any trips around closing time. But during 
certain times of the year, things just take a lot longer. The December 
holidays are the worst, but spring break and major three- or four-day 
weekends can also be times when your favorite property inspector, loan 
officer, or escrow officer may be planning to be out of the office.
 
Eleventh-hour issues are bound to arise, so don’t leave important details to 
the last minute or you may have your back to the wall, particularly if there is a 
penalty clause to extend your escrow. You can almost guarantee lost docu-
ments and other unexplained communication breakdowns that occur any time 
you have so many moving parts. Anticipate logistical delays and allow time for 
anything and everything to take twice as long as it should.
Estimated closing statement
Several days before the projected date for the close of your escrow, both the 
buyer and the seller receive a copy of the estimated closing statement with 
the various charges. You may receive this statement at the time you sign 
some or all of the documents, or it may be sent to you separately. This is 
an extremely important document because this is the best time to raise any 
issues or concerns if you feel that an error has been made.
The estimated amounts can, and usually do, change slightly. Often the 
escrow officer or closing agent estimates these expenses a little on the high 
side because any shortage of funds prevents the escrow from closing, but 
any overage can easily be credited or refunded back to the buyer or seller.
The buyer should pay particular attention to the estimated closing state-
ment because it indicates the funds expected to be received from the lender 
or credited from the seller if there’s seller financing. It also indicates the 
amount of additional cash funds that the buyer needs to deposit in the form 
of a wire transfer, cashier’s check, or other certified funds. The buyer must 
provide these good funds in plenty of time for the escrow to close — your 
personal check will take up to a week to clear and credit cards and PayPal 
aren’t accepted! Remember: If you have a large sum of money deposited in 
escrow, arrange for the escrow company to place the funds in an interest-
bearing account.

253
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
Title insurance
Title insurance has evolved to become a vital element in most real estate 
transactions. Title insurance companies track all recorded documents and 
transfers of interests in real estate so that they can issue title insurance — 
policies that assure the purchaser that the title to the property being 
transferred is legally valid and unblemished. This kind of title is commonly 
referred to as a clean and marketable title. Title insurance is like any form of 
insurance in that it defends and pays the claims made against the insured. 
There are two types of title insurance policies issued in most transactions:
 
✓ The seller provides one to the buyer to protect herself against claims 
that the purchase of the property wasn’t a marketable title. For example, 
maybe the heir to a former owner may suddenly claim that there was a 
fraudulent transfer of the property years ago. If you bought title insur-
ance when you purchased the property, the title company defends any 
legal action or compensates you in the event that the claim is valid and 
you lose the property.
 
✓ Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else 
claiming legal title to your property. The lender provides funds toward 
the purchase of the property and wouldn’t be protected if the property 
ownership were to change based on a claim of an improper transfer of 
title. There are many ways that a title can be transferred improperly — 
for instance, when a husband and wife split up and the one who remains 
in the home decides to sell and take off with the money. If the title lists 
both spouses as owners, the spouse who sells the property (possibly by 
forging the other’s signature) has violated the law. The short-changed 
spouse can reclaim rights to the home even after it has been sold. In 
this event, both you and the lender can get stuck holding the bag in the 
absence of title insurance.
Most state insurance departments monitor and regulate title insurance compa-
nies because a company’s ability to pay claims is always important. Although 
title insurers rarely fail, and most states do a good job shutting down finan-
cially unstable ones, check with your state’s insurance department if you’re 
concerned. Title insurance companies receive ratings from insurance-rating 
companies, so you can ask the insurer for copies of the latest report.
Don’t simply use the company that your real estate agent or lender suggests — 
shop around. Because many title companies provide escrow services, you 
need to watch out for companies that quote very low prices on one service and 
make up for it by overcharging in other areas. When you call around for title 
insurance and escrow fee quotes, get a handle on all the charges; there may 
be miscellaneous or hidden administrative fees that can sneak up on you and 
become major items — document preparation, courier fees, and express mail. 
If you find a company with lower prices, consider asking for an itemization in 
writing so that you don’t run into any surprises.

254
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
 
Check with your title insurance company for special riders (clauses) that save 
you money if you’re buying a distressed investment property with the inten-
tion of quickly renovating and selling the property in less than 24 months. 
(That’s two title insurance policies — you pay for a lender’s title insurance 
policy as the buyer and then a seller’s title insurance policy when you sell the 
property.) These special policies typically cost you 10 to 20 percent more 
upfront but can be a real bargain if you can avoid having to purchase a brand-
new title policy for a short holding period.
Property insurance
You must have insurance, often one of the larger expenses for investment 
properties. Unless you purchase the property entirely for cash, you can’t 
close the transaction and take over the property until you have a certificate 
of insurance in place. Your lender, or even the seller if he’s providing any 
financing of your purchase, will prudently insist that you have adequate 
insurance coverage with policy limits that effectively protect your financer’s 
collateral or financial interest in the property.
In accounting terms, property insurance is a fixed expense (like your property 
taxes), which means that although you may be able to turn off the natural gas 
(a variable expense) when your property is unoccupied, you must have insur-
ance coverage — even if your property is vacant. In fact, insurance is likely 
more important if your property is vacant for an extended time frame.
 
In order to avoid surprises in your cash flow, determine the cost of insurance 
while you’re still in your due diligence phase of the transaction. At this point, 
you retain the ability to cancel without penalty if you find that proper insur-
ance coverage is either not available or priced way too high.
Another benefit of getting your insurance early in the due diligence process 
is that your insurance agent or an underwriter from the insurance company 
may even inspect the property before providing you with a quote. Of course, 
any inspection by the insurance company is limited in scope and is never 
a substitute for your own inspection or the detailed written inspections 
you need from your property inspector and other industry professionals or 
experts (see “Inspecting the property” earlier in the chapter). But it can be 
important to know whether the insurance company is going to require any 
upgrades or changes to the property as a condition of offering insurance.
For example, many companies no longer write policies for multifamily resi-
dential properties that have balcony- or pool-fence wrought-iron railings with 
pickets spaced greater than 4 inches apart, due to the potential hazards to 
small children. The cost to correct this condition can be expensive, and you 
would want to include such costs in your negotiations with the seller or at 
least include the amount in your capital budget. (We discuss the role of insur-
ance in an effective risk management program in Chapter 16.)

255
 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
You may trust your insurance broker or agent, but don’t allow your escrow to 
close until you have written documentation confirming that your coverage is 
in force. It may seem improbable, but many properties have suffered a cata-
strophic loss or liability claim in a matter of hours after the property changed 
hands and the new owner’s insurance coverage wasn’t yet in place. Robert 
was an expert witness in a case where an owner thought his insurance agent 
had placed earthquake coverage on his new apartment purchase only to dis-
cover a few days after a devastating earthquake had substantially destroyed 
his building that the request for coverage was never sent in!
Final closing statement
Just before your transaction is complete and escrow is closed, you receive a 
closing statement from the escrow officer. Besides the actual purchase price, 
there are several expenses incurred in the process of purchasing real estate 
that must be worked out between the buyer and the seller. For example, the 
seller may have paid the property taxes for the balance of the year, and the 
buyer should reimburse him for the amount attributable to his ownership 
period after the close of escrow.
There are also expenses that the buyer and seller need to pay, such as 
escrow and recording fees. Who pays what is usually outlined in the escrow 
instructions and is determined by a combination of the purchase agreement 
negotiations between the parties and custom and practice in the local real 
estate market. Table 14-1 contains a breakdown of the allocation of expenses 
that are typical in the purchase of investment properties.

 Chapter 14: Due Diligence, Property Inspections, and Closing
 
The day before you close on the property, take a brief walk-through to make 
sure that everything is still in the condition it was before and that all the fix-
tures, appliances, window coverings, and other items the contract lists are 
still there. Sometimes, sellers ignore or don’t recall these things and conse-
quently don’t leave what they agreed to in the sales contract.
The importance of conducting a final property inspection prior to closing 
escrow is illustrated by one of Robert’s expert witness cases. The buyers of 
a single-family home failed to close escrow as planned because they decided 
they didn’t want to put the 20 percent down payment in cash but instead were 
negotiating with their mortgage broker to arrange a second loan that could be 
combined with their first trust deed to give them 100 percent financing. The 
seller had moved out on the original estimated closing date, and the home 
sat vacant for several weeks until the buyers were able to arrange and fund 
the second loan. With the transaction dragging on past the expected close 
of escrow, the anxious buyers failed to inspect the home that one last time 
before finally closing escrow. Unfortunately, sometime between when the 
seller moved out and the buyers first saw the property after they had closed 
escrow and taken title, the property experienced a severe water leak that com-
pletely flooded a good portion of the home and created a serious mold issue. 
The remediation cost was in the tens of thousands of dollars, and litigation 
ensued because the insurance companies for both the seller and buyer refused 
coverage on the basis that no one could determine precisely when the damage 
occurred. Ultimately, the buyers’ insurance covered much of the out-of-pocket 
repair costs, but the matter wasn’t resolved for over two years, and the buyers 
didn’t have loss of rent coverage to make up for rent lost during that period.
The escrow officer or closing agent usually processes the mandatory report-
ing of the real estate transaction to the Internal Revenue Service and the 
state tax authorities, if required. If she doesn’t file the required 1099-S form, 
the brokers or the buyer and seller may be required to handle the reporting, 
which includes the identity of the property transferred, the sales price, and 
the Social Security numbers of the buyer and seller.
 
Be sure to keep a copy of the closing statement, because this document estab-
lishes your initial cost basis when you go to sell the property and need to 
determine your capital gain. Also, some of the expenses paid at the close of 
escrow may be deductible on your tax return, such as prepaid interest or 
points on your loan and property taxes and insurance.
Deed recording and property takeover
Although the escrow officer may have all of the signed documents, and funds 
have been transferred to the proper accounts, you aren’t the proud owner 
of your investment property until the deed is recorded. The procedure for 

258
Part III: Finding and Evaluating Properties 
recording the documents varies throughout the country but is becoming 
more standardized. Nearly every county utilizes a county recorder to record 
documents like real estate deeds, mortgages, deeds of trust, and other real 
estate documents as a public notice. Typically, there is an office of the 
county clerk and recorder, sometimes in the county courthouse in smaller 
jurisdictions.
Electronic document processing technology has made great strides in 
improving the efficiency in recording and retrieving documents at virtually all 
recorders’ offices. Now documents can be retrieved by computers in a matter 
of seconds and are usually indexed by grantor and grantee.
 
After you receive word that the deed has been recorded, the transaction is 
finalized; you’re the new owner, and you begin the property takeover process. 
There are several steps that you should take in the first few days of owner-
ship, including
 
✓ Conducting a final walk-through to make sure that the property hasn’t 
been damaged prior to the close of escrow.
 
✓ Verifying that all items indicated on the personal property inventory list 
are present.
 
✓ Making sure that all keys were received (if the property is vacant, you 
should change the locks as an added precaution).
 
✓ Checking the utility meters to make sure that the utility company has 
switched the billing as of the close of escrow so you don’t get billed for 
the former owner’s usage.
 
✓ Meeting with tenants and assuring them that you’re a responsive and 
concerned property owner who wants to cooperatively resolve issues.
 
Another issue to address right after the closing is the possession and control 
by the former owner. Because the escrow closing and recording can often 
happen during the day without any specific notice, it’s best to wait until the 
following calendar day and personally verify that only the tenants that should 
be there are occupying the property. If the owner is still residing on the prem-
ises or is using some of the property for his own use, you need to immediately 
ask that he turn over full possession unless you’ve made other formal written 
arrangements in advance. To minimize this prospect, we suggest that you 
include significant daily monetary damages in the purchase contract for any 
unauthorized holdover usage by the seller.
Congratulations! You’re now ready to begin managing your property and 
increasing value as you build the foundation of your real estate portfolio.

eing a good landlord requires knowledge, training, 
and experience. Although we can’t guarantee you 
that this part provides everything you need, it can help 
you avoid the mistakes of the many who have come 
before you. In addition to attracting and retaining good 
tenants, being a wise landlord also boosts the value of 
your property — if you follow our time-tested strategies of 
property management. But should the unexpected or 
unfortunate occur, all your hard work can go for naught if 
you don’t have the proper insurance and risk manage-

t the moment that you close the deal on buying a rental property, 
you’ve probably already put in dozens, if not hundreds, of hours. Now, 
however, the real work begins. To maximize the value of your investment, 
you’ve got to attract and retain excellent tenants, stay on top of government 
regulations, keep your eyes open for ways to cost-effectively improve your 
property, and handle contracts and money flowing in and going out. This 
chapter shows you how to be the best landlord that you can be.
First Things First: Deciding Whether 
to Hire Management Help
A property manager can be responsible for all operations of a property, includ-
ing marketing, tenant selection, rent collection, maintenance, and accounting. 
Many beginning real estate investors do all the work themselves — painting, 
cleaning, making repairs, collecting rent, paying bills, and showing the rental 
units. However, after a while, most investors delegate jobs that they aren’t 
suited for or don’t enjoy. Some new owners, of course, do just fine managing 
their own rental units. But others discover firsthand that on-the-job property 
management training can backfire with some costly lessons.

262
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Evaluating your situation and the 
possibility of self-management
If you have the right traits for managing property, have the time, and live 
close to your property, consider doing it yourself. Among the advantages of 
self-management are
 
✓ You save the monthly property management fee. Property managers’ 
fees can be significant, so a potential advantage for the do-it-yourself 
approach is that you can save yourself a good deal of money. However, 
as we discuss in a moment, you must examine the bigger picture of the 
value of your time and realistically assess how much of your time prop-
erty management takes up.
 
✓ You can save on maintenance costs. By keeping direct control of the 
management, you decide who does the repair work and mows the lawn. 
If you’re qualified and have the time, doing your own maintenance or 
yard work is usually a good idea; if you hire someone else to do it for 
you, the cost can devour your monthly cash flow in a hurry — especially 
in the early years of ownership when cash flow is often tight. Develop a 
list of reliable fix-it and landscape personnel who are licensed, do good 
work, and charge fair rates.
 
Some owners who self-manage can tell you exactly how much money they 
“saved” by not hiring a property manager, but the one factor that many real 
estate investors overlook is the value of their own time in dealing with man-
agement issues.
If you earn your living regularly from something other than managing rentals, 
managing your investment property may not be worth your valuable time. 
If you’re a higher-income, full-time professional, rushing off on weekdays to 
handle some minor crisis at your rental unit isn’t only impractical, it may be 
downright damaging to your career.
 
As a jobholder, look at your annual income and figure out approximately what 
you earn per hour. Do the same for the cash savings you generate by manag-
ing your own property. Unless your management efforts produce significant 
cash savings compared to your job, you may be better off hiring a property 
manager for your rental units.
The same guidelines hold true even if you’re an independent business owner 
or self-employed. Your schedule may be more flexible than that of a nine-
to-five employee. But if you’re earning $50 an hour, it doesn’t make sense to 
devote hours of your productive work time to managing rental units, which 
may only amount to cash savings of $25 an hour.

263
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Assessing your personal 
skills and interests
To fill the position, you have to possess the corresponding basic skills. But 
you don’t need a degree or a lot of experience to get started, and you’re sure 
to pick up ideas of ways to do things better along the way.
 
Use the following questions to examine your own personality and skills to see 
whether you’re cut out to be your own property manager:
 
✓ Are you a people person? Serving as a landlord is a labor of love. You 
must enjoy people and solving problems — while often being unappreci-
ated yourself.
 
✓ Do you have the temperament to handle problems? Responding to 
complaints and service requests in a positive and rational manner is 
key.
 
✓ Are you comfortable with numbers and basic accounting skills? And 
meticulous with paperwork?
 
✓ Do you have maintenance and repair abilities? Being able to work with 
your hands goes a long way, but if you’re adept at finding and managing 
good contractors, you’re still in the game.
 
✓ Are you willing to work and take phone calls in the evenings and on 
weekends? Who needs a weekend, right?
 
✓ Do you have sales and negotiation skills? You need to sell the space.
 
✓ Are you willing to commit the time and effort? Other important tasks, 
such as determining the right rent and becoming familiar with property 
management laws, take even more time.
 
If you’re impatient or easily manipulated, you aren’t suited to being a property 
manager. You need to convey a professional demeanor to your tenants. They 
must see you as someone who will take responsibility for the condition of the 
property and operational systems of the unit. You must also insist that ten-
ants live up to their part of the bargain, pay their rent regularly, and refrain 
from causing unreasonable damage to your property.
A rental property manager must be fair, firm, and friendly to all rental pros-
pects and tenants. You need to treat everyone impartially and remain patient 
and calm under stress. You must be determined and unemotional in enforc-
ing rent collection and your policies and rules. And you must maintain a posi-
tive attitude through it all. Not as simple as it looks, is it?

264
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
When you manage a rental property, you don’t just have to deal with your cur-
rent tenants. You also have to interact with rental prospects, contractors, sup-
pliers, neighbors, and government employees. People, not the property, 
create most rental management problems. Be prepared to be flexible and 
learn from your property management experiences. The really good property 
managers may have credentials, but they have also graduated from the school 
of hard knocks. Practice makes perfect.
Finding and Hiring Capable 
Professional Management
Management companies accept the responsibility for all operations of the 
property. The right property manager can make a big difference in the cash 
flow your rental unit generates by finding good replacement tenants quickly 
or making sure that maintenance is done in a timely manner without breaking 
your budget. You need a property manager who is committed to helping you 
get the optimum results from your rentals. Try to find property managers 
familiar with your kind of investment property. With a little research, you can 
find the right fit for your property.
A poor management company can cut into your profits, not only with their 
fees but also by providing improper maintenance and leasing to poor-quality 
tenants who may run your property into the ground. A bad property manager 
can leave you in worse shape than if you had managed the property yourself.
Doing the research
Visit the office of your management company and spend time interviewing 
the specific property manager that will have hands-on management of your 
rental property. Make a few extra phone calls to check references and don’t 
sign a management contract until you feel confident that the company you 
hire has a sound track record. Checking with the property management 
company’s chosen referrals isn’t enough. Ask for a list of all their clients and 
contact the ones with rental properties similar in size and type to your own. 
Make sure the rental owners you contact have been with the property man-
agement company long enough to have a meaningful opinion.
 
Make sure that the firm you hire manages property exclusively, particularly 
when selecting a management company for a single-family home, condo, or 
small rental property. Many real estate sales offices (as opposed to property 
management firms) offer property management services; however, this service 
is often more about obtaining the listing to sell the property later on. Many 

265
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
property managers in real estate sales offices don’t have the same credentials, 
experience, and expertise that an employee of a property management firm 
has. The skills required to represent clients in selling property are quite differ-
ent than the skills required to manage property.
 
Also, be sure to investigate these issues:
 
✓ Licenses: Most states require property managers to have either a real 
estate license or a property manager’s license or both. Call or use the 
Internet to verify that the property manager and the management com-
pany have a current license in good standing.
 
✓ Credentials: Also examine the property manager’s credentials. The 
Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM), an organization of profes-
sional property managers, provides professional designations, includ-
ing the Certified Property Manager (CPM) and Accredited Residential 
Manager (ARM) designations. A select group of management firms have 
earned the Accredited Management Organization (AMO) designation. 
Check out www.irem.org to see if your manager is IREM-approved.
 
✓ Insurance: The company should carry insurance for general liability, 
automobile liability, worker’s compensation, and professional liability 
(errors and omissions). The management company is your agent and 
will be collecting your rents and security deposits, so they should also 
have a large fidelity bond to protect you in case an employee embezzles 
or mishandles your money.
 
✓ Accounting: Look for a management company that keeps a separate 
accounting for each property managed rather than a master trust 
account where multiple clients’ funds are commingled.
Talking money
In most management contracts, property management companies have the 
ability and right to perform emergency repairs without advance approval 
from the owner. Of course, this arrangement allows the property manage-
ment company to take care of problems that occur unexpectedly. Most 
management contracts contain clauses that allow property managers to 
undertake repairs up to a specified dollar amount without the owner’s 
advance approval. The limit should be commensurate with the type and size 
of the property. Commercial properties and larger residential properties may 
have a $2,500 limit, whereas a small duplex may have a limit of $250.
 
When you’re in the early stages of working with a new management company, 
make sure you closely monitor their expenses. Even though they may have the 
legal right to use funds up to a certain amount, they should always keep you 
informed. Many management companies have in-house maintenance crews, 

266
Part IV: Operating the Property 
and keeping these workers busy making repairs at properties they manage can 
be a lucrative profit center. They may offer low management fees knowing that 
they can make it up by markups on (often unnecessary) repairs. Look for a 
property management firm that doesn’t mark up materials, supplies, or main-
tenance labor.
 
Typically, management companies receive a percentage of the collected 
income for managing a property; some management firms offer a flat fee per 
month or a dollar amount per unit per month for the entire property. Try to 
find a company that has a management fee that is a percentage of the col-
lected income; this kind of fee is a strong motivator to the management com-
pany to ensure that the rents are collected and kept at market rate. Generally, 
the larger the rental property, the lower the management fee percentage. 
Management fees for single-family homes, condos, and small rental properties 
typically run 9 to 10 percent; medium size properties 6 to 8 percent; and large 
residential properties of 200 or more units around 3 to 5 percent. Fees for 
commercial-type properties have a similar scale.
Additional fees for the leasing of vacant space are often justified, because 
the most time-intensive portion of property management is tenant turnover. 
When one tenant leaves, the rental unit or the commercial, industrial, or 
retail suite must be made rent-ready; then the property manager must show 
the property and screen the tenants. Charges for residential rentals can vary 
but are often either a flat fee of a few hundred dollars or a percentage of the 
rent, such as half of the monthly rental rate. Leasing commissions for com-
mercial, industrial, or retail properties are almost always a percentage of the 
gross rent with a declining scale where the longer the lease, the lower the 
percentage in the later years.
Having the Property Tested for 
Environmental Concerns
Take precautions to ensure that your rentals are a safe and healthy environ-
ment. Although legal implications and substantial liability for failing to meet 
required state and federal disclosures are also motivators, most owners 
simply don’t want to see their tenants get sick or injured. Check for the fol-
lowing issues:
 
✓ Lead: Some older buildings may still contain lead paint (which was 
banned in 1978). A lead test is the only way to verify the existence of 
lead. Often, the best solution is to manage the lead rather than remove 
it, because the removal processes can release large amounts of lead 
dust. As a residential rental owner, know the dangers of lead and the 
federally required disclosures for residential properties only (providing 

267
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
a lead paint pamphlet that you can get at www.epa.gov/lead). Most 
states have lead hazard reduction laws, some of which require testing 
and maintenance in addition to the federal disclosure requirements.
 
✓ Asbestos: Although there are currently no federal disclosure rules for 
asbestos in rental housing and no federal requirements to investigate 
or remove asbestos, check with local and state officials for possible dis-
closure requirements. Asbestos was added to a variety of products to 
provide strength, heat insulation, and fire resistance. In most products, 
asbestos is combined with a binding material so that it’s not released 
into the air. As long as fibers aren’t released, there are no known health 
risks. However, asbestos is dangerous if disturbed. Studies of people 
exposed to asbestos clearly show that breathing high levels of the fibers 
can lead to an increased risk of lung and other cancers. Don’t test for 
asbestos on your own. Hire a professional environmental testing firm 
because the act of breaking open potentially asbestos-containing mate-
rial to obtain samples can release asbestos into the air and create a dan-
gerous situation. See www.epa.gov/asbestos for more information.
 
✓ Radon: Radon is an invisible, odorless, radioactive gas, and a known 
cancer-causing agent, found in soil and rock in all parts of the U.S. Inside 
some buildings, high levels of radon gas have been found to cause 
lung cancer. But most radon found in buildings poses no direct threat 
because the concentration is generally within the safe level. No federal 
requirements to disclose or test for radon currently exist, but it’s poten-
tially a serious issue and one that’s receiving more attention. Conduct 
tests, which are cheap and simple to do, to determine radon levels in 
your rentals, and check with local authorities for more information 
about the prevalence and precautions to take. Visit the EPA Web site at 
www.epa.gov/radon for more information.
 
✓ Mold: Recently much has been made of alleged health problems caused 
by exposure to mold spores. Mold has been around since biblical times 
and is found everywhere, but allegations that exposure to certain types 
can be hazardous are rather recent with several well-publicized lawsuits. 
The city of New York developed guidelines and a protocol for remediat-
ing mold in the early 1990s, but the EPA didn’t generate any materials 
until March 2001. The EPA documents generally follow the New York 
City protocol, which has several levels of recommended responses 
depending on the size of the area where mold is found. Although a 
common claim is respiratory illness by some individuals while in direct 
contact with elevated mold levels, there are still no conclusive scientific 
guidelines as to acceptable limits for exposure. But rental owners should 
take claims of mold exposure seriously. Minimize the possibility of mold 
in your building by identifying and quickly repairing moisture intrusion. 
If there’s a claim of mold by your tenant, follow the EPA guidelines and 
protocol and consult with experts if the problem is severe and persis-
tent. Use qualified professionals and carefully document all communica-
tion to minimize the prospect of being sued by your tenants.

268
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Deciding On Rental Policies
As a landlord, you’ve got some important business decisions to make regard-
ing the terms under which you rent to tenants. Among other items, you 
should give plenty of thought to the length of the lease term and the amount 
of the monthly rent and security deposit, as well as some other important 
policies, all of which we cover in this section. 
Determining lease length
The lease or rental agreement is the legal document that specifies the terms 
and conditions of the agreement binding the property owner and the tenant. 
It’s a contract between the owner of the property and the tenant for the 
possession and use of the property in exchange for the payment of rent. 
Residential rental property owners commonly use one of two types of agree-
ments (for information on other aspects of leases, check out Chapter 11):
 
✓ Month-to-month agreement: More common with residential properties 
than commercial, industrial, or retail, a month-to-month rental agree-
ment is automatically renewed each month unless the owner or tenant 
gives the other proper written notice (usually 30 days) to terminate the 
tenancy. Month-to-month agreements give you much more flexibility 
than leases, because you can increase the rent or change other terms of 
the tenancy on 30 days’ notice.
 
 Some owners prefer the flexibility offered by a month-to-month rental 
agreement to a lease. Although the month-to-month rental agreement 
does allow your tenants the right to move at any time merely by giving a 
30-day written notice, the reality is that most tenants don’t like to move 
and often stay long-term. The majority of tenants only move because of 
a job transfer or another significant reason, or because the rental owner 
doesn’t properly maintain the property.
 
✓ Fixed-term lease: Commercial, industrial, and retail investment prop-
erty owners almost always use long-term leases exclusively. Fixed-term 
contracts obligate you and the tenant for a set period of time, and 
some owners like the commitment required from the tenant. The most 
common residential lease terms are for 6, 9, or 12 months and rarely 
exceed two years. With such a lease, you can’t increase the rent or 
change other terms of the tenancy until the lease expires. You can’t 
terminate or end the tenancy before the lease expires, unless the tenant 
doesn’t pay his rent or violates another term of the lease. And in court, 
you have the burden of proof, which means you’re the one who has to 
prove that the tenant didn’t live up to his part of the contract.

269
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Setting the rent
Establishing the rent is one of the most important yet difficult tasks for 
most investment property owners. If you set your rent too high, you’ll have 
a vacant rental unit. And if you set your rent too low, your profits will suffer 
or, worse, you won’t even cover your expenses. You can use two common 
methods for determining how much rent you should charge for your rental 
property — return on investment (which examines your costs) and market 
analysis (which looks at a comparable property’s rent).
Examining the return on your investment
The first step in determining your rent based on the return on your invest-
ment is to calculate your costs of owning and operating your rental property. 
You need to estimate costs for your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, 
maintenance, leasing, management, and a profit on your invested funds (for 
the details on this topic, please see Chapter 12).
Suppose that for a residential rental unit, your monthly mortgage, tax pay-
ments, and operating expenses come to $800, plus you want a $200 monthly 
return (10 percent per year on your original cash investment of $24,000 in 
this rental property). Thus, you need to generate a monthly rent of $1,000 
($800 + $200). (This simple calculation doesn’t take appreciation, increasing 
equity, or tax advantages of real estate into account.)
Although you may have calculated that you need $1,000 per month for your 
rental unit, if the rental market is such that comparable units are readily 
available for $900, you may not be able to fully achieve your financial goals 
at this time. With most real estate investments, the initial returns may not 
match your original projections; in the long run, rents often increase at a 
greater rate than your expenses, your debt service remains constant, and 
your return on your initial investment improves.
 
Many new investment property owners make the mistake of overestimating 
the potential income from their rental property while allowing for no rental 
discounts or concessions, and anticipating virtually no vacancy or bad debt. 
When reality strikes, they can be faced with negative cash flow, and ulti-
mately, they may even lose their rental property.
Setting the rent is particularly critical if you own single-family or condo rental 
units or other small residential or commercial rental properties, because the 
rent loss from an extended vacancy or one bad tenant can seriously jeopar-
dize your investment. Be conservative in setting your rents (along with being 
cautious in tenant screening and aggressive in maintaining your properties) 
to attract good, long-term tenants who pay on time. To avoid surprises, use a 
conservative budget for your rental property that anticipates rental income 

270
Part IV: Operating the Property 
at about 92 percent of the market rent for a comparable rental unit or suite, 
which is based on the assumption that you will have one month’s vacancy or 
collection loss each year.
Surveying comparable rents
 
Knowing how much money you need to break even is important for evaluating 
the potential return on your real estate investment. And setting your rents 
properly is an independent decision based on current market conditions. 
Unfortunately, the realities of the rental market may put limits on what rent 
you can reasonably charge for your rental unit or suite, regardless of your 
costs of owning and maintaining the investment property.
Evaluating the rental rates being charged for similar rental units or suites in 
comparable locations is a great way to gather information before setting your 
own rent. Make minor adjustments in your rent because of variations in the 
location, age, size, and features of the properties you’re comparing.
For example, if you own a residential investment property and one of your 
competitors has an available rental unit that is nearly identical to yours, your 
rent should be slightly higher if you also have a swimming pool. Of course, be 
honest and make downward adjustments for aspects of your rental property 
that aren’t as desirable as alternatives.
In order to determine the market rents in your area, do your homework and 
locate comparable rental properties, which are those properties that your 
tenants are most likely to also consider when looking for a rental unit or 
suite. They may be located right in the neighborhood or in other areas.
Deciding on security deposits
Rental property owners are permitted to collect a security deposit from ten-
ants upon move-in and hold it until the tenant leaves. The security deposit 
provides financial protection for the property owner in the event that the 
tenant falls behind in his rental payments or damages his rental unit or suite.
For residential properties, state laws often limit the amount of the secu-
rity deposit, require interest to be paid on the deposit, and detail what are 
lawful deductions. Check with the local affiliate of the National Apartment 
Association for your state’s security deposit laws. (Certain rental owners 
may be exempt from the rules.)
 
In most rental markets, typical security deposits are well below the maximum 
allowed by law. We recommend that you collect as large of a security deposit 
as the market can bear (staying within the legal limits). Don’t lower or waive 

271
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
the security deposit. If the required funds to move in are too high for a desired 
tenant, collect a reasonable portion of the deposit prior to move in and allow 
the tenant to pay the balance in installments.
Because the funds don’t belong to you, several states require that residential 
security deposits be held in a separate trust bank account. Some states require 
that owners provide tenants with a written notice indicating the location of this 
bank trust account at the beginning of the tenancy. All of these requirements 
and more are covered in Robert’s book Property Management Kit For Dummies, 
2nd edition, which includes a CD with links to all state tenant-landlord laws.
Creating policies and guidelines
Many owners of small investment property don’t worry about setting detailed 
policies and guidelines (often called house rules) because they think the lease 
or rental agreement covers it all. But setting up some basic rules in writing 
that can be modified as necessary upon proper written notice to the tenants 
is a good idea because it ensures that you and your tenants are on the same 
page and gives you flexibility as you manage your property. The rules you 
draft should be more informal and conversational in tone than your lease. Be 
clear, direct, and firm, yet not condescending. Make sure your policies and 
rules are reasonable and enforceable. They must not discriminate against 
anyone because of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, and so on. Be particularly 
careful to review your house rules to avoid any reference to children unless 
related to health and safety issues.
In addition to the lease, take care of these issues:
 
✓ Give your residential tenants a copy of the required environmental dis-
closure form and the EPA pamphlet for lead-based paint and lead-based 
paint hazards, which is required under federal law.
 
✓ Inform your new tenant of the importance of smoke detectors. You may 
even want to create a separate smoke detector agreement to be sure 
your tenants fully understand the importance of this vital safety equip-
ment and that they must take an active role in ensuring that the smoke 
detectors remain in place and operate properly.
 
✓ Have pet owning residential tenants complete and sign an animal agree-
ment, which outlines pet-specific policies and rules at your property. 
Retain control over the number, type, and size of the animals on your 
property. You can meet and photograph the animal so there’s no doubt 
as to what you have approved.

272
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Working with Existing Tenants 
Upon Property Acquisition
If you’re like most investment property owners, you’re acquiring property 
that’s already occupied. Tenants are typically full of apprehension when their 
rental unit ownership is changing, so it’s extremely important to begin your 
relationship with your tenants on a positive note.
Meeting tenants and inspecting units
When you first acquire a residential rental property, contact your tenants 
and reassure them that you intend to treat them with respect and have a cor-
dial yet businesslike relationship. Deal with tenants’ questions honestly and 
directly. The most common concerns usually include the following:
 
✓ Potential for a rent increase
 
✓ Status of their security deposit
 
✓ Proper maintenance or condition of their rental unit
 
✓ Continuation of certain policies, such as allowing pets
Just as you’re evaluating your tenant, your tenant is evaluating you during 
these initial contacts. Be open and honest. Failing to do so can result in a loss 
of credibility should you later implement changes that you didn’t acknowl-
edge up front. And don’t make any promises that you won’t keep. Unlike 
in politics, renters have plenty of choices and will move along if you lie to, 
deceive, or otherwise disappoint them.
If you’re investing in commercial investment properties, you should also 
meet with your tenants and listen to their concerns about the property. 
Although they typically aren’t as concerned about sudden rent increases 
(because they’re likely on a long-term lease), they’re interested in hearing 
about your plans to maintain and upgrade the property or make any other 
improvements that may increase their business. Also, it’s never too soon to 
begin courting your commercial tenants for a lease renewal.
 
Provide your tenants with a letter of introduction during this brief in-person 
meeting. This letter provides your tenant with your contact information, 
explains your rent collection policies, the status of their security deposit, and 
the proper procedures for requesting maintenance.

273
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Although you most likely had a brief chance to view the interior of the rental 
unit or suite during the due diligence period before escrow closed, walking 
through again with the tenant now that you’re the owner can be helpful. Pay 
special attention to the proper use of the space, particularly for commercial 
tenants where illegal activities such as the use or storage of hazardous mate-
rials may be a serious liability issue.
Don’t just knock on the door and expect to walk through your tenant’s rental 
unit or suite. But if you’re at your investment property delivering the letter 
of introduction, you can schedule a mutually convenient time to meet. Some 
tenants will be glad to meet with you right then, but others won’t. Giving your 
tenants time to think about any issues that they want to discuss is beneficial 
for both of you. In most states, tenants don’t have to let you enter their rental 
unit unless you have a legal reason and have given proper advance notice.
 
The former owner of the investment property may have had a policy of 
documenting the condition of the rental unit or suite at the time the tenant 
took possession. If so, compare the noted condition when you actually walk 
through the rental unit or suite. If proper documentation of the move-in con-
dition wasn’t made, consider preparing such information during your walk-
through. This practice allows you to establish some sort of baseline for the 
condition of the unit to use upon the tenant’s move-out, which can help you 
determine the amount of the security deposit to be returned to the tenant.
Entering into a new rental agreement
Although you may want to make some changes in the terms or policies, when 
you acquire an occupied rental property, your legal and business relation-
ship is already established by whatever agreement the tenants had with the 
former owner. Therefore, you need to wait until the expiration of the lease to 
change the terms — or provide the tenant with proper written notice of pro-
posed changes as required by state or local law.
Most new owners convert existing tenants to their own lease or rental agree-
ment as soon as possible.
 
✓ Single-family home, condo, or a small residential rental property: 
Implementing your own rental agreement as soon as legally allowed is rel-
atively easy and can be done upon the expiration of the lease or upon 30 
days written notice if the tenant is on a month-to-month rental agreement.
 
✓ Larger residential rental properties: You may want to gradually transi-
tion to a new agreement upon tenant turnover rather than require cur-
rent tenants to sign a new lease. It’s quite a significant project at a larger 
property to generate all the new leases and then meet with each tenant 
one-by-one to go over the new lease.

274
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
✓ Commercial properties: You really have no choice but to implement 
new leases upon tenant lease renewal or turnover as the existing leases 
are valid and binding until their expiration.
 
Consider the potential impact of making significant changes in the rental rates 
or policies immediately after you acquire the property. For example, although 
you may have strong feelings against allowing pets on your residential rental 
property, your new tenants may have pets already. Although you legally have 
the right to implement a no-pet policy upon lease renewal or upon giving 
proper legal notice, you’re almost guaranteed a vacant rental unit if you do so. 
Impose your policies over a reasonable time frame, but be sure you’re aware 
of the potential financial consequences in the short run.
 
For residential investment properties, the tenant information the seller pro-
vided you during escrow (see Chapter 14) may be outdated. One quick way to 
update your records is to have the tenants voluntarily complete your rental 
application form. In many states, you may not have a strong legal argument for 
requiring existing tenants to provide this information; however, many tenants 
may understand your reasoning and not mind. Other tenants may be reluctant 
to complete an entirely new rental application, in which case you may not 
require them to complete all sections of the form. However, even if you 
receive initial resistance, seek this updated information prior to renewing any 
lease. You need to assess the financial qualifications of your tenants, particu-
larly if you anticipate future rent increases.
Increasing rents
When you acquire an investment property, part of your research is to estab-
lish the fair market rental value of your new property. If the tenant’s current 
rent is below market value and he’s on a month-to-month rental agreement, 
one of your toughest decisions as the new owner of a rental property is how 
to handle rent increases.
As the new owner, you likely have much higher mortgage payments and 
expenses to make necessary repairs and upgrades to the property than 
the last owner did. Some tenants will be upset and antagonistic about rent 
increases, however, and there is little you can to do to appease them.
 
The majority of tenants reluctantly accept a rent increase as long as the rent 
isn’t raised beyond the current market rent for a comparable rental unit or 
suite in the area and you’re willing to make needed repairs or upgrades to 
their rental units or suites. Providing the tenants with information on compa-
rable rentals in your area should aid your increased rent request.

275
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Finding Stable, Trustworthy Tenants
Vacant rental units or suites don’t generate rental income, so fill your vacan-
cies with good, stable, rent-paying tenants quickly. To ensure that you do so, 
follow some precautionary measures on your own before beginning to assess 
potential tenants. 
 
Setting up a systematic screening process is particularly critical if you only 
own a single-family rental, rental condo, or a small, multiunit rental property. 
Deadbeat tenants who go from property to property causing damage and not 
paying rent are experienced and shrewd. They know that the novice property 
owner is more likely to be fooled and that the large, professionally managed 
properties have screening procedures to verify every single item on their 
rental applications. If certain items don’t check out, the professional property 
manager doesn’t just trust her feelings on the prospective tenant.
 
Sometimes the mere mention of the tenant screening process is enough to 
make the rental prospect fidget and then shift into the classic “I’m just look-
ing” mode. Don’t rush or allow a prospect to hurry you through the tenant 
screening and selection process. The wrong decision can be financially devas-
tating, particularly if you own just one or two rental units or a small commer-
cial investment property.
 
Over 90 percent of your residential rental applicants will be good tenants, pay 
their rent on time, take good care of their homes, and treat you and their 
neighbors with respect. You just need to carefully guard against those few bad 
apples; don’t hesitate to deny prospects who can’t meet your standards. 
Verifying information on prospective tenants’ rental applications takes a 
while, but it’s time well spent. Relying on your instincts is inaccurate, arbi-
trary, and illegal (see the next section).
Establishing tenant selection criteria
 
In order to increase your chances of finding a long-term, stable tenant — and 
avoiding charges of discrimination — your tenant selection criteria and 
screening process should be clear, systematic, and objective. Tenant selection 
criteria are written standards that you use to evaluate each prospective ten-
ant’s qualifications as a tenant for your property. Determine your minimum 
qualifications and adhere to them, applying them consistently and fairly to all 
rental applicants. Of course, your written criteria can’t be discriminatory or 
violate any federal, state, or local fair-housing laws.

276
Part IV: Operating the Property 
In order to establish your selection criteria, review what you’re looking for in 
a tenant. At a minimum, we suggest that you seek tenants who are financially 
responsible, pay their rent on time, and are likely to renew their leases, treat 
rental property with care, and be good neighbors. With commercial proper-
ties, you’re also looking for tenants with complementary businesses that 
enhance rather than compete with your current tenants.
You aren’t required to provide your rental prospects with a copy of your 
written tenant selection criteria, but there are potential benefits to doing so. 
Although you must offer all prospects a rental application and process each 
one received, there is an advantage to prospects making their own decision 
not to apply for your rental based on the criteria you’ve set up. The key is 
to follow the criteria without exception and have the information available if 
you’re challenged. Decide when you’re most comfortable discussing the cri-
teria — from the first inquiry call, when you actually receive the application, 
and so on — and once again, be consistent.
 
Always be thorough when you screen tenants, and use the same process with 
all applicants. You run the risk of a charge of illegal discrimination if you devi-
ate from your written standards for certain applicants. There are many legally 
acceptable reasons to deny a rental application. Be sure that your require-
ments are clearly understood and followed.
The fact that you carefully prescreen all prospects is a positive factor not 
only for you but also for your rental applicants, your current tenants, and 
even the neighbors. In fact, you have a responsibility to your current tenants 
to weed out the unqualified tenants with a track record of disrupting neigh-
bors everywhere they go. The good rental prospects will appreciate the fact 
that their neighbors had to meet your high standards, too.
If you’re in the rental housing business for long, you hear about six-figure or 
larger legal awards against rental property owners for violating fair-housing 
laws. Problems often arise when investment property owners are unaware 
that their policies or practices are discriminatory. Families, children, and 
folks with disabilities often suffer from this lack of knowledge. Federal and 
state laws prohibit discrimination, and these laws impact your advertising, 
tenant screening, and selection process.
 
The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and handicap (referred to 
as disability in many states). Check the state and local fair-housing laws in 
your area; some additional state and local protected classes include age, 
sexual preference, gender identity, occupation, source of income (govern-
ment assistance, Section 8), educational status, medical status, and even 
physical body size.

277
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Discrimination is a major issue for investment property owners and has seri-
ous legal consequences. If you don’t know the law, you may be guilty of vari-
ous forms of discrimination and not even realize it until you’ve been charged 
with discrimination. That’s why knowing the law is so important.
With residential rental properties, another form of illegal discrimination is 
steering — guiding a rental applicant toward living where you think he should 
live based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disabil-
ity or handicap, or any other protected class. Not showing or renting certain 
living units to a person in a protected class is one form of steering; however, 
so is the “assigning of any person to a particular section or floor of a build-
ing, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national 
origin.” Advertising or promotion that indicates or implies a preference is 
also discriminatory.
 
All commercial and residential rental applicants should receive information on 
the full range of vacant space or rental units available and be able to decide 
which suites or units they want to see.
Residential rental property owners often have good intentions when they 
suggest that a rental prospect with children see only rental units on the 
ground floor or near the playground. However, such practices are a viola-
tion of current federal fair housing laws as they restrict housing options and 
can be used by some unscrupulous landlords as an excuse or justification to 
cover up their intentional discriminatory actions.
Being fair to families and children
All residential rental properties must be offered to all applicants, including 
those with children, as federal and state legislation has virtually eliminated 
“adult only” residential housing except for certain HUD-certified seniors’ 
properties. However, because there’s less regulation of nonresidential prop-
erties, some commercial property owners may be within their legal rights 
to use their business judgment to refuse or discourage an applicant with 
plans to use the leased space as a daycare or other business that caters to 
children.
 
Some rental property owners are concerned about renting to families with 
children because of hazards on the property that may be dangerous for kids. 
For example, the property may not have any safe areas for the children to 
play. Although you may truly only have children’s best interests in mind, it’s 
the parent’s right to decide whether the property is safe for their children. Of 
course, you do need to take reasonable steps to make your property safe.
Charging rental applicants with children higher rents or higher security 
deposits than applicants without children may be found to be discrimina-
tory based on disparate impact, as is offering different rental terms, such as 
shorter lease terms, fewer unit amenities, or different payment options. 

278
Part IV: Operating the Property 
The property facilities must also be fully available for all tenants, regardless 
of age, unless there is a clear safety issue involved. For example, some states 
have laws allowing a policy that an adult must accompany children under 14 
when using the swimming pool.
 
As a rental property owner, you should welcome renters with children. 
Families tend to be more stable, and they look for safe, crime-free, and drug-
free environments in which to raise their kids. Along with responsible pet 
owners, who also have difficulty finding suitable rental properties, families 
with children can be excellent, long-term renters. And typically, the longer 
your tenants stay, the better your cash flow.
Dealing with tenants with disabilities
The federal fair housing regulations state that property owners must
 
✓ Make reasonable accommodations at the owner’s expense for tenants 
with disabilities, so they can enjoy the rental property on an equal basis. 
A common example would be providing a wider and more convenient 
parking space, when practical.
 
✓ Make reasonable adjustments to their rules, procedures, or services 
upon request.
 
✓ Allow disabled tenants the right to modify their living space at their own 
expense, under the following conditions:
 
• The modifications can only extend to what is necessary to make 
the space useful and comfortable.
 
• The modifications don’t make the unit unacceptable to the next 
tenant, or if they do, the tenant agrees to return the rental unit to 
its original condition upon vacating the property.
 
• The tenant must obtain your prior approval and ensure that the 
work will be done in a workmanlike manner, including obtaining 
any necessary government approvals or permits.
 
• The tenants must pay the funds necessary to perform the needed 
restoration into an interest-bearing escrow account to ensure that 
the work is actually completed and there will be no liens against 
the property.
Discrimination against people with disabilities in residential housing is cov-
ered in the federal Fair Housing Act. However, in July 1990, Congress passed 
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which has far-reaching impact on 
most commercial and retail real estate. The ADA has limited requirements for 
many rental property owners, because it applies only to the public areas and 
not the private or common areas of residential properties.

279
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Under the ADA, all areas of a property to which the public is invited must 
be accessible by individuals with disabilities. For example, a rental property 
with an on-site office (and other public amenities, like a clubhouse, rental 
unit models, or a pool and spa area) must be accessible to persons with dis-
abilities. The removal of existing physical barriers at the rental property own-
er’s expense is required whenever it’s “readily achievable and technically 
feasible.” The ADA also establishes parking requirements if the residential 
property provides public parking, such as prospective resident spaces.
The ADA applies to all residential properties, even those built prior to the 
passage of the law. Owners of residential properties occupied prior to March 
13, 1991, are required to remove barriers to accessibility, but they aren’t 
required to make changes that may cause undue hardship. Owners of proper-
ties occupied after March 13, 1991, must comply with ADA and should be in 
compliance with the federal Fair Housing Act, too. Professional complainants 
seek out ADA violations in both residential and commercial rental properties, 
so know what you’re responsible for accommodating.
Many local municipalities work closely with HUD to investigate ADA com-
plaints and handle enforcement. Also, local jurisdictions oversee and enforce 
handicapped parking requirements for multiunit rental properties. Check 
with your local building and code enforcement office for details.
If you have a “no pets” policy, keep in mind that Fair Housing law requires 
rental property owners to make “necessary and reasonable accommodation.” 
One specific common accommodation is not having any limitations or not 
discouraging occupancy by tenants who need a support animal. Companion 
or service animals that assist tenants with daily life activities aren’t pets; 
they’re exempt animals and must be allowed in all rental properties, regard-
less of any “no pet” policies. Fair Housing laws also prohibit you from requir-
ing an animal or pet deposit, or increasing the tenant’s security deposit 
because he has a support animal. Further, you can’t make any rules limiting 
the types or breeds of animals (for example, allowing German shepherds 
only) or an unreasonable size restriction. You can, however, establish rea-
sonable rules of conduct for the animals and should note that the tenant is 
still responsible for any damages done by the animal. Some tenants seek the 
accommodation of a companion animal based on their need for comfort or 
companionship, and federal law requires owners and managers to grant the 
request if the tenant’s claim is true and reasonable.
Advertising for tenants
Advertising is how you let people know that you have a vacant rental prop-
erty available. Money intelligently spent on advertising is money extremely 
well spent. But when it’s done poorly, advertising can be another black hole 
for your precious resources.

280
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Determine the most desirable features of your rental property for your target 
market by asking your current renters what they like about where they live 
or work. You can also ask people who look at your property — whether or 
not they agree to rent — what aspects of your property they found of inter-
est. Incorporate these selling points into your marketing efforts.
 
The best advertisement for your rental property is curb appeal — the exterior 
appearance. Properties that have well-kept grounds with green grass, trimmed 
shrubs, beautiful flowers, and fresh paint are much more appealing to your 
rental prospects. A well-maintained property often attracts a tenant who will 
pay more rent and treat your rental property with care.
Creating interest in your rental property used to be as simple as putting up 
a sign or placing an ad in the local newspaper. Although these tried-and-true 
methods of informing potential renters still often work, other options are 
available for you to consider. The target market for your rental property has 
a lot to do with which method of advertising works best for your rental unit. 
Referrals and property signs often give you good exposure to renters in your 
local area, whereas newspaper ads and real estate agents may let people or 
businesses relocating to your area know about your rental property as well. 
The Internet has become a powerful tool in reaching all segments of your 
target market.
Showing your rental
One of the most time-consuming aspects of owning and managing rental 
property is the time spent filling vacancies. Real estate investors with com-
mercial properties often use professional leasing brokers, and owners of 
large residential properties have onsite managers and leasing agents. But 
residential rental property owners with small properties usually take this on 
individually, and it can be a huge time trap.
Efficiently scheduling showings
 
The most efficient approach to showing your small residential rental is to hold 
an open house — which enables you to show your property to several inter-
ested rental prospects within a couple of hours. Select a two to three hour 
period for your open house that is convenient for you and most working 
people (preferably during daylight hours). Combining a weekday early evening 
open house with one on the weekend enables virtually all prospects to fit the 
rental showing into their busy schedules.
Another benefit of an open house is that many folks feel more comfortable 
touring a rental property when other prospects are around. They don’t have 
to be concerned about meeting someone they don’t know in a vacant rental 
property. This approach also aids your own personal safety.

281
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
 
A newspaper ad simply indicating the time of your open house isn’t a good 
idea, because you may end up with many unqualified renters walking through 
your property. But an open house where you invite all qualified prospects 
whom you have spoken with in response to your advertising is a good way to 
create a sense of urgency and competition, which often generates multiple 
applicants for your rental.
In a depressed rental market, or if you find that you need to fill a vacancy 
during the holidays, you may not be able to generate enough interest for 
an open house for multiple prospects. If you have to schedule individual 
appointments, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ Be prepared to show your rental units in the evenings and on weekends, 
when most of your prospects are available.
 
✓ Try to consolidate your appointments to a certain time frame, but don’t 
push this too far. Asking prospects to conform to your schedule may 
turn them off.
 
✓ Call each person to verify the rental showing before making a special 
trip to the property. By calling, you’re also reassuring the prospect that 
you’ll be there and aren’t going to be delayed. Exchanging cellphone 
numbers can be helpful here.
Showing vacant versus occupied rentals
When showing a vacant residential rental, be a tour guide but don’t be too 
controlling. Allow the prospects to view the rental in the manner that suits 
them. Some prospects go right to a certain room, which gives you a clue 
about the importance that they place on that aspect of your property. If the 
prospects hesitate or are reluctant to tour on their own, casually guide them 
through the rental property yourself.
 
As you begin to show the interior of your residential rental, avoid making obvi-
ous statements such as “This is the living room” or “Here’s the bathroom!” 
Instead, listen and observe the body language and expressions of your pros-
pects as they walk through the property. Don’t oversell if they seem pleased, 
but feel free to point out the benefits of your rental.
Commercial properties are typically shown vacant after the prior tenant has 
vacated, although you may be able to obtain the cooperation of the vacat-
ing tenant to show prospects through the suite while occupied. Because 
commercial tenants almost always require some specialized tenant improve-
ments, it can be more useful to work off of drawings of the space — rather 
than conduct a physical tour — and have a space planner show the prospect 
how the space will meet their needs. If you do show an occupied commercial 
space, just be sure not to disrupt the tenant’s business activities.

282
Part IV: Operating the Property 
In most states, if the current residential tenants are at the end of their lease 
or have given a notice to vacate, the owner is specifically allowed to enter 
the unit to show it to a prospective tenant. Of course, you must comply with 
state laws that require you to give tenants advance written notice of entry 
prior to showing the rental unit. Your tenant may agree to waive this require-
ment, but make sure that you have that agreement in writing.
Cooperate with the current tenants when scheduling mutually convenient 
times to show the rental — and respect their privacy by avoiding excessive 
intrusions. Although the current tenant may legally be required to allow you 
and your prospects to enter the rental unit for a showing, he doesn’t have to 
make any efforts to ensure that the property is clean and neat.
Showing a vacant rental unit is generally much easier, but touring your pros-
pect through an occupied rental property does have some advantages. Your 
current tenants can be a real asset if they’re friendly and cooperative and 
take care of the property. The rental prospects may want to ask the current 
tenant questions about their living experience at your property.
 
If you can, get copies of recent utility bills from your current tenant, in case 
your prospective renters have any questions about utility costs. Utility costs 
for electric, natural gas, water and sewer, and trash are becoming significant 
items in the budgets of many renters. You don’t want your tenants to be 
unable to financially handle the typical monthly utility costs, because that 
may impact their ability to pay your rent. Plus, you may also be able to use 
low utility costs as a marketing tool.
 
If your current residential tenant is being evicted, isn’t leaving on good terms, 
or has an antagonistic attitude for any reason, don’t show the rental unit until 
the property is vacated. Also consider this strategy if your current tenants 
haven’t taken care of the rental property or if their lifestyle or furnishings may 
be objectionable to some rental prospects.
Selling prospects
After you’ve qualified your residential rental prospect (see the “Establishing 
tenant selection criteria” section earlier in the chapter), convince her that 
you have the best rental unit available. People want more than just a place to 
live. Tenants want to feel they can communicate with you if a problem arises. 
They also appreciate it when someone shows an interest in their lives. By 
showing an interest, you set yourself apart from other property managers. 
Some prospects will take a rental unit that isn’t exactly what they’re looking 
for if they have a positive feeling about the rental property owner.
No matter how closely your rental unit meets the stated needs and wants of 
your prospects, they often hesitate and doubt their own judgment. Don’t be 
pushy, but convince the prospects that your property is right for them. After 
you succeed in this regard, you have to close the sale. This is one area where 

283
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
many rental property owners and managers suddenly get cold feet. They may 
do a great job handling the initial telephone rental inquiry, the preparation 
and showing of the rental property, and even objections, but become shy to 
ask the prospect to sign and commit money.
 
Your goal at the end of the showing is to receive a commitment from the pros-
pect to rent by having him complete your rental application and pay the credit 
screening fee, first month’s rent, and security deposit. But don’t forget that 
you still need to thoroughly screen the prospect and confirm that he meets 
your rental criteria before you sign a lease or rental agreement.
If, despite your best efforts, the prospect is still undecided, make sure that he 
gives you a holding deposit. Remind him that you may make a deal with the 
next prospect and he’ll be out of luck. If you have a lot of demand for your 
rental units or suites, you should develop a waiting list. (Note: Many appli-
cants may be an indication that you set your rent too low.)
Accepting applications and deposits
You must offer every interested prospect (age 18 and older) the opportunity 
to complete a written rental application. You want to avoid having a prospect 
accuse you of discriminating against him by not permitting him to fill out 
the rental application. And information provided on the application enables 
you to begin the screening process and select the best tenant for your rental 
property, using objective criteria and your rental requirements.
 
Rental property owners are legally allowed to choose among rental applicants 
as long as their decisions comply with all fair-housing laws and are based on 
legitimate business criteria.
Prior to accepting the rental application, carefully review the entire form to 
make sure that each prospective tenant has legibly provided all requested 
information. Pay particular attention to all names and addresses, employ-
ment information, driver’s license numbers, and emergency contacts. Make 
sure that the prospect has signed the rental application authorizing you to 
verify the provided information and to run a credit report. Finally, ask each 
prospective tenant to show you her current driver’s license or other similar 
photo identification so that you can confirm that she provided you with her 
correct name and current address.
 
If you go over the application with the prospect, only ask questions that are 
part of the form. Don’t ask the rental applicant about his birthplace, religion, 
marital status, children, or about a physical or mental condition — such ques-
tions may lead to accusations of discrimination. You can ask him if he has 
ever been convicted of a crime and whether he’s at least 18 years old.

284
Part IV: Operating the Property 
After you approve the rental prospect, you should have her sign the rental 
agreement. If the prospect still insists she needs additional time, she should 
agree to pay the daily rental rate or you should refund her holding deposit 
and continue your leasing efforts.
 
If you use a holding deposit, you must have a written agreement or you’re 
likely to encounter a misunderstanding or even legal action. State laws regard-
ing holding deposits vary throughout the country, yet they’re almost uni-
formly vague and can easily lead to disputes.
Verifying rental applications
Keep copies of all rental applications and corresponding verification forms, 
credit reports, and all other documents for both accepted and rejected appli-
cants for at least three years. That way, if anyone ever makes a claim that you 
discriminated against him, your best defense will be your own records, which 
will clearly indicate that you consistently applied legal rental criteria. Here 
are the key items to review on renters’ applications.
Adults’ identity
Require each prospective adult tenant to show you his or her current driver’s 
license or other similar (and official) photo ID so that you can confirm that 
the applicant is providing you with the correct name and current address. 
Advise each rental applicant that if his application is approved, you will need 
a photocopy of his ID to be kept in his tenant file. Ask about any discrepan-
cies between the application and the ID provided. Even if the explanation 
seems reasonable, be sure to write down the new information. Maybe an old 
address appears on the photo ID, which you can check out further through a 
credit-reporting agency. Having a photocopy of the ID for each adult tenant is 
vital if a dispute about the tenant’s identity arises in the future. In these situ-
ations, you need to be able to clearly show that you positively identified the 
tenant at move-in.
Rental history
When you first contact the rental applicant’s current landlord, listen to his 
initial reaction and let him tell you about the applicant. Some landlords wel-
come the opportunity to tell you all about your rental applicant, but some 
current and prior landlords may be
 
✓ Dishonest: A landlord may be upset with the tenant for leaving his prop-
erty or unwilling to say anything bad about a problem tenant so that he 
can get the tenant out of his property and into yours.
 
✓ Unforthcoming: Many landlords are concerned that they may have 
some liability if they provide any negative or subjective information.

285
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
When a current or prior landlord isn’t overly cooperative, try to gain his 
confidence by providing him with some information about yourself and 
your rental property. If you’re still unable to build rapport, try to get him to 
at least answer the most important question of all: “Would you rent to this 
applicant again?” He can simply give you a yes or a no without any details. Of 
course, silence can also tell you everything that you need to know.
 
Some applicants provide you with letters of reference from their prior land-
lords or even copies of their credit reports. Verify the authenticity of any doc-
uments provided by the rental applicant. Another useful screening tool is to 
request all tenants to provide copies of their water and utility bills for the past 
year. These documents can verify the tenant’s prior address and also give you 
an idea whether they pay their bills on time.
Employment and income
Independently verify the company information and phone number the appli-
cant puts on her application if you have any doubts about the authenticity of 
it. For example, you may have reason for concern if the employer is a major 
corporation and the telephone isn’t answered in a typical and customary 
business manner.
You also need to be careful that you confirm the sensitive compensation and 
stability of employment questions only with an appropriate representative 
of the employer. Be prepared to send letters requesting the pertinent infor-
mation and include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Be sure to tell your 
rental prospect that you may have a delay in providing her with the results of 
your tenant screening process.
In addition to the results of your verification calls, the applicant should 
provide you with proof of her employment and income such as recent pay 
stubs. But no matter how strong the information is, verify it directly with the 
employer or the source of the income. For prospective commercial tenants, a 
copy of the most recent tax return is your best method of verifying income.
Credit history
Obtain a credit report on each applicant. A credit report shows all current 
and previous credit cards and loans, timeliness of making payments when 
due, plus all public record entries such as bankruptcy and judgment. You 
can figure out whether an applicant has been late or delinquent in paying 
his rent or other living expenses. The three major credit reporting agencies 
are Experian (www.experian.com; 888-397-3742), Equifax (www.equifax.
com; 800-997-2493), and Trans Union (www.transunion.com; 800-888-4213). 
Credit information for commercial tenants can be found in the D&B database 
(www.dnb.com; 800-234-3867).

286
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
Carefully compare the addresses contained on the credit report to the infor-
mation provided on the rental application. If there is an inconsistency, ask the 
rental prospect for an explanation. Maybe the person was temporarily staying 
with a family member or simply forgot about one of her residences. Of course, 
be sure to contact prior landlords and ask all the questions on the rental 
application verification form just to make sure that the applicant didn’t 
neglect to tell you about that residence for a reason.
Information obtained in credit reports must be kept strictly confidential and 
can’t be given to any third parties. In some states, the rental applicant is enti-
tled to a copy of his own credit report upon request, and federal law allows 
anyone denied credit or housing on the basis of his credit report to obtain a 
free copy of the report.
 
Make sure that you’re reviewing the credit report of your actual applicant. 
People with poor credit or tenant histories have been known to steal the iden-
tity of others — particularly their own children — by using the child’s Social 
Security number. Many landlords no longer even ask for Social Security num-
bers, but if you do, one solution is to make sure that your credit reporting ser-
vice provides a Social Security search, which clearly indicates whether there 
are any inconsistencies in the use of the number provided.
All personal references
You will occasionally find someone who tells you that the rental applicant 
is her best friend but goes on to candidly tell you she would never loan the 
applicant money or let him borrow her car. Plus, if you call the references 
given and find that the information is bogus, you can use this information as 
part of your overall screening of the applicant.
Dealing with rental cosigners
If your rental prospect doesn’t meet the criteria outlined in your statement 
of rental policy, you may consider approving his application if he provides a 
cosigner or guarantor. A guarantor must be financially qualified and screened 
or the guarantee is worthless.
Require your guarantor to complete a rental application, pay the application 
fee, and go through the same tenant screening process as the applicant. Keep 
in mind that the guarantor won’t actually be occupying the commercial suite 
or living at your rental unit and thus will have his own housing costs. To 
ensure that the guarantor can meet all of his own obligations and cover your 
tenant’s rent in case of a default, deduct the guarantor’s cost of housing from 
his income before comparing it to your income requirements.

287
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
 
Although a lease guarantor can be very important and can give you the extra 
resources in the event of a rent default by your tenant, out-of-state lease guar-
antors aren’t as valuable as in-state ones. Enforcing the lease guarantee 
against an out-of-state party can be difficult or even financially unfeasible.
Notifying applicants of your decision
Regardless of whether your rental applicant is accepted or rejected, be sure 
to notify the applicant promptly when the decision is made. If you have 
approved the applicant, contact him and arrange for a meeting and a walk-
through of the rental unit prior to the move-in date.
 
Don’t notify the other qualified applicants that you have already rented the 
rental property until all legal documents have been signed and all funds due 
upon move-in have been collected in full.
One of the most difficult tasks for the rental property owner is informing a 
rental applicant that you’ve denied his application. You obviously want to 
avoid an argument over the rejection, but even more importantly, you want 
to avoid a fair-housing complaint based on the applicant’s misunderstanding 
about the reasons for the denial.
Notify your denied rental applicant in writing, and keep a copy of all rejec-
tion letters for at least three years. If you notify the applicant only by phone, 
you may have difficulty giving all of the details and required disclosures. The 
written notice-of-denial-to-rent form avoids a situation in which the applicant 
may form the opinion that you’re denying his application in a discriminatory 
manner, in which case he may file a complaint with HUD or a state or local 
fair-housing agency.
Using a notice-of-denial-to-rent form to inform the applicant in writing of your 
decision as well as outline the valid reasons is an excellent idea. This form 
helps you to document the various legal reasons for your rejection of the 
applicant. It’s a simple checklist that also allows you to provide the applicant 
with the required information per the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.
If you reject an applicant based on his credit report, you’re required by 
the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act to notify the applicant of his rights. 
Although it’s not required to be in writing, provide the denied applicant with 
a letter containing the mandatory disclosures so that you have proof that you 
complied with the law. You must also provide this information even if you 
have approved the applicant but have required him to pay a higher security 
deposit, higher rent, or provide a cosigner.

Part IV: Operating the Property 
Reviewing and signing documents
Tenants and property owners alike are usually aware of all the legal paper-
work involved in renting a property. And although sifting through all that 
legalese isn’t fun for anyone, it’s important. Rental property owners and ten-
ants each have specific legal rights and responsibilities that are outlined in 
these documents, and being aware of what you’re agreeing to — and being 
sure that your tenants know what they’re agreeing to — is crucial.
After you approve the rental prospect, you should have her sign the rental 
agreement. If the prospect still insists she needs additional time, she should 
agree to pay the daily rental rate or you should refund her holding deposit 
and continue your leasing efforts.
 
Be sure that your tenant understands that when he signs your rental 
agreement, he’s entering into a business contract that has significant rights 
and responsibilities for both parties. Be sure to have all adult occupants 
review and sign all documents — including any lease or rental agreement 
addendums — before taking possession of the rental unit. After the tenant 
has been given the keys and taken possession of the rental property, getting 
him to sign your required legal documents can be difficult, and regaining pos-
session of your rental unit can be a long and expensive process. (Even if the 
tenant failed to sign the lease or rental agreement, an oral tenant/landlord 
relationship is established when you give the tenant the keys, but oral agree-
ments often foster disagreements, so avoid the situation altogether.)
Collecting the money
In your meeting prior to move-in, be sure to collect the first month’s rent and 
the security deposit before you give the tenants the keys to the rental unit. 
Payment may be in the form of cash, a cashier’s check, or a money order. But 
don’t accept a personal check (because you have no way of knowing whether 
the check will clear). Provide a receipt for the payments.
 
Accept cash for the move-in or the monthly rent payment only when abso-
lutely necessary. Regularly collecting cash for your rents can make you a 
crime target. Most convenience stores offer money orders for a nominal cost 
and are open at all hours, so let your tenant take the risk of carrying the cash 
to the bank or convenience store to get a money order. Tell your new tenant 
that your policy is to accept only a bank cashier’s check or money order upon 
move-in. Also, let him know whether your rent collection policy allows him to 
pay his future monthly rent payments with a personal check.

289
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
Prior to giving the keys to your new tenant and allowing him to take posses-
sion, insist on having the cash in hand through good funds (as opposed to 
insufficient funds, where a person writes a check and doesn’t have the money 
to cover it). Most owners do this by requiring cash, a bank cashier’s check, 
or a money order. But many rental owners aren’t aware that both bank 
cashier’s checks and money orders can be stopped because they can be lost 
or stolen. However, the bank cashier’s check and money orders are superior 
to personal checks because they do represent good funds and at least won’t 
be returned to you because there was no money to cover them.
 
If, despite our strong advice, you accept a personal check, at least don’t give 
the tenant access to the property until you’ve called and verified with the ten-
ant’s bank that the check will be honored. Your best bet is to physically take 
the check to the tenant’s bank and cash it or at least have it certified. If the 
bank certifies the check, it’s guaranteeing that there are sufficient funds avail-
able and that it will actually put a hold on the funds. Of course, cashing the 
check is the only sure way to collect your funds, because a devious tenant can 
always stop payment on even a certified personal check.
Inspecting the property with your tenant
 
The number one source of residential tenant/landlord disputes is the disposi-
tion of the tenant’s security deposit. Many of these potential problems can be 
resolved with proper procedures before the tenant takes possession of the 
rental unit by using a move-in/move-out inspection checklist.
When properly completed, the inspection form clearly documents the condi-
tion of the rental property upon move-in by the tenants and serves as a base-
line for the entire tenancy. If the tenant withholds rent or tries to break the 
lease claiming the unit needs substantial repairs, you may need to be able to 
prove the condition of the rental unit upon move-in. When the tenants move 
out, you’ll be able to clearly note the items that they damaged or left unclean.
 
Complete the inspection form with the tenants prior to or at the time of move-
in. Walk through the premises with the tenants and agree that all items are 
clean and undamaged before they move in their stuff. Note the condition of the 
carpets and floor coverings — one of the most common areas of dispute upon 
move-out. Although tenants shouldn’t be charged for ordinary wear and tear, 
if they destroy the carpet, they should pay for the damage. Indicate the age 
of the carpet and whether it has been professionally cleaned as part of your 
rental turnover process. You can also take photos or videotape the unit before 
the tenant moves in for additional material to refresh the tenant’s memory or 
show the court if the matter ends up there.

290
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Adding Value through Renovations 
and Upgrades
 
For residential properties, almost every rental unit has the potential for reno-
vation or upgrades. Often this area is where the real value can be created in 
rental units: When you have a rental unit that is dated, you can renovate it and 
increase the rent. Pay particular attention to those items that would be quick, 
easy, and inexpensive to replace but that can really improve the overall look 
of your rental unit.
 
If you have an older investment property, renovating or making tenant 
improvements may be more difficult due to some of the hazardous materials 
used in your building’s original construction. Asbestos and lead-based paint 
were commonly used in construction of many older properties, and these 
materials can be quite costly to remove. Often, you’re better off just leaving 
them in place as long as they haven’t been disturbed. Consult with experts in 
these issues before doing any work. Also, check with your local building, code 
enforcement, or health department for its requirements regarding the proper 
handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
Again, if your chosen investment properties are residential, keep in mind 
what features and strengths your prospective renters can find in competitive 
rental units. For example, if most of your competition offers dishwashers but 
your unit doesn’t have one, you may want to install a dishwasher so that you 
remain competitive. Another simple upgrade is to replace your old electrical 
switches and outlets to create a more modern look.
Enhancing external appearances
Make sure that your rental prospects’ first impression of your residential or 
commercial rental property is a positive one, because if it isn’t, they’ll most 
likely never take the time to see the interior. Start at the street and carefully 
critique your property as if you were entering a contest for the best-looking 
property in your area.
 
To attract tenants who will treat your property properly and stay for a long 
time, be sure that your grounds and exterior areas are sparkling clean and the 
landscaping is well maintained. Renovating the grounds by removing trash, 
junk, and weeds is an inexpensive task. A nice green lawn, healthy shrubs, and 
shade trees enhance any investment property. Make sure that the building 
structure is presentable and inviting. Some specific exterior improvements to 
consider are ground level or hanging planters, brass address numbers, 
awnings, fresh paint, landscaping, and cleanup.

291
 Chapter 15: Landlording 101
First impressions are critical and one of the key areas seen by all prospective 
tenants is the front entry. Make sure the entryway is clean, well kept, and 
well lighted. The entry door should be cleaned or freshly painted or stained. 
Buy a new welcome mat. Remove or replace a broken screen door.
Improving what’s inside
The most qualified renters always have choices. You’re in competition for 
these excellent tenants, and you need to ensure that your rental unit stands 
out from the rest. The positive first impression of your rental property’s exte-
rior won’t matter if the rental unit’s interior is poorly maintained.
 
Don’t show your rental unit until it’s completely rent-ready. Although you may 
lose a couple of potential showing days by taking the time to get the unit 
ready, you benefit in the long run with a more conscientious tenant. Here’s a 
list of things to check:
 
✓ All plumbing and appliances are operating properly.
 
✓ Locks have been changed and are operational. Pay attention to all 
latches and catches, doorknobs and pulls, doorstops, and sliding doors.
 
✓ Windows, window locks, screens, and window coverings should be 
clean, unbroken, secure, and operating properly.
 
✓ Paint and/or wall coverings should provide proper coverage, without 
holes, cuts, scratches, nails, or bad seams.
 
✓ Floor coverings should be clean and in good condition.
 
✓ Thoroughly clean the toilet, tub, shower, sink, mirrors, and cabinets.
 
✓ Check all closets and storage areas. Rods, closet dowels, hooks, shelves, 
lights, floors, and walls should be clean.
 
✓ Counters, cabinets, doors, molding, thresholds, and metal strips should 
be clean and fully operational, presenting no hazards.
 
✓ Check smoke detectors, all lighting, and electrical outlets, including 
ground-fault circuit-interrupters (GFCI) and circuit breakers for proper 
operation.
 
✓ Patios, balconies, and entryways should be clean and the railings 
secure.
 
✓ Check the heating and air-conditioning for proper operation. Be sure the 
thermostat, filters, vents, and registers are all in working order.

292
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Using contractors
Particular maintenance and improvements are best handled by outside 
contractors. Use outside contractors for those trades that require special-
ized licensing or training. For example, it would be unwise for you to act as 
an exterminator or a contractor dealing with environmental hazards, or to 
attempt to recharge the coolant in an air-conditioning unit. Specific regula-
tions are in place and unique knowledge is required in these areas.
Your skill level, time constraints, and opportunity cost may help determine 
whether you do some chores yourself or hire a pro. For example, cleaning, 
painting, and light maintenance may be items that you feel qualified to handle 
and can complete promptly.
 
Every day your residential rental unit sits vacant is costing you rental income 
that you can never recover. If you decide to paint your own rental unit, it may 
take you six days working in the evenings and on weekends to completely 
paint a single-family rental home. If the rental market is strong and the daily 
rental rate is $50 per day, you’re actually losing money if you could have had 
the rental home professionally painted in one day for $200.
Regardless of how much work you choose to handle yourself, have on hand 
a list of competent and competitively priced service companies and sup-
pliers for those times when you need a quick response. Your local affiliate 
of the National Apartment Association (NAA), the Institute of Real Estate 
Management (IREM), or the Building and Owners Managers Association 
(BOMA) can often provide names of service companies. Carefully check the 
references and the status of any bonds or licenses with the appropriate gov-
ernmental agency, and ensure that they have the proper insurance in place 
before you allow them to commence any work on your property.

Protecting Your Investment: 
Insurance and Risk Management
In This Chapter
▶ Creating your risk management plan
▶ Looking into insurance options
A
fter years of accumulating resources, every investment property owner 
needs to be concerned about protecting her assets through insurance 
and risk management programs. After working and sacrificing to build your 
wealth through real estate, don’t be careless and lose it.
The concept of risk management includes much more than simply having an 
insurance policy. You need to take care to practice proper maintenance and 
recordkeeping and require that others provide you with coverage for their 
activities. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Developing a Risk Management Plan
Many people get into the world of rental real estate without knowing how 
much risk they’re exposed to just by owning real estate. You may read sto-
ries in the newspaper about lawsuits against deep-pocket defendants without 
much personal concern, but it’s a reality shock when you’re suddenly consid-
ered to be the one with those deep pockets.
 
Real estate investment property owners need a plan to minimize risks because 
they’re frequent targets of those who suffer a personal injury or whose prop-
erty is damaged. Many studies have shown that real estate rental property 
owners are sued more than any other single type of business entity.

294
Part IV: Operating the Property 
But you can take steps to reduce and control your risk. Consider the fol-
lowing suggestions as preventive actions to minimize the potential of being 
named in a lawsuit:
 
✓ Regularly inspect the property as part of a thorough maintenance pro-
gram. One of the easiest ways to minimize the potential of being named 
in a lawsuit is to routinely inspect your property and correct any noted 
deficiencies, such as health or safety problems. Make and retain copies 
of your inspections and document that all items were promptly and pro-
fessionally addressed.
 
✓ Listen to and address tenant complaints. Be open and responsive to 
feedback from your tenants and others expressing concerns. A track 
record of quick response to complaints is the best defense if you find 
yourself defending a claim or lawsuit alleging an injury or property 
damage due to your negligence.
 
✓ Transfer the risk to others. Transferring risk from the owner and prop-
erty manager to the vendor or supplier is sound policy for managing and 
minimizing risk. You can do this contractually by only using licensed 
and qualified contractors and suppliers who provide their own insur-
ance coverage. Require that they provide written evidence that they 
have proper insurance coverage in place naming you individually and 
the legal entity that actually holds title to your investment property as 
an additional insured prior to performing work or providing materials.
 
 If you use a management company to handle the property management 
for you, make sure that they require insurance declaration forms from all 
vendors and suppliers documenting $1 million minimum coverage limits 
prior to doing any work or even making deliveries to your property.
 
✓ Remove certain risks or never allow them in the first place. For exam-
ple, many owners and managers of residential properties have removed 
diving boards and pool slides. Commercial property owners have 
restricted access to the roofs of their buildings with emergency door 
hardware.
 
Although you can minimize your risks by taking some of these steps, you can’t 
eliminate all risks completely, and that’s why you need proper insurance cov-
erage. Insurance is a vital element in a risk-management program.
Getting the Insurance You Need
As the owner of investment real estate, insurance coverage is one of your 
best protections and an essential risk management technique to ensure that 
you hold on to the wealth that you create.

295
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Investment: Insurance and Risk Management
If you’ve ever sat down with a sharp and assertive insurance agent, you may 
know that some insurance companies sell you coverage against any possible 
danger or loss in the world. Experienced insurance agents seem to have mas-
tered the art of describing all sorts of horrible problems that may befall your 
investment property. But you need to sift through the sales pitch, do further 
research, and decide which coverage is right for you — and make sure you’re 
covered at a reasonable cost.
 
Your goal is to pay only for coverage for events and losses that can occur at 
your property. The right insurance coverage is worth a lot, but use resources 
wisely — hurricane insurance in Minnesota isn’t worthy of your precious 
insurance dollars.
You need to be concerned about lawsuits and having the proper insurance 
coverage to defend yourself and protect your assets. Insurance not only 
provides protection against actual losses but also provides a legal defense 
against the claims made against you as the owner of real estate. The expense 
of retaining competent legal counsel is what makes the threat of a lawsuit so 
devastating to many real estate investors.
 
Don’t assume that all potential losses are covered by your insurance cover-
age. Your best defense against losses is to properly manage your rentals and 
assertively eliminate, transfer, or control the inherent risks of owning and 
managing rental property.
Understanding insurance options
The proper insurance coverage can protect you from losses caused by many 
dangers, including fire, storms, burglary, and vandalism. A comprehensive 
policy also includes liability insurance, covering injuries or losses suffered 
by others as the result of defective or dangerous conditions on the property. 
Liability insurance also covers the legal costs of defending personal injury 
lawsuits — a valuable feature because the legal defense costs of these cases 
are commonly much greater than the ultimate award of damages, if any.
Common coverages
The following list describes the three levels of coverage available for primary 
policies, all of which include liability coverage. Many insurance companies 
offer competitive insurance packages especially designed to meet the needs 
of rental property owners, so remember to shop around.
 
✓ Basic coverage: Most companies offer a basic coverage package that 
insures your investment rental property against loss from fire, lightning, 
explosion, windstorm or hail, smoke, aircraft or vehicles, riot or civil 
commotion, vandalism, sprinkler leakage, and even volcanic eruptions.

296
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
 This coverage often doesn’t include certain contents, such as boilers, 
equipment, and machinery unless specifically added as an endorsement. 
Based on the type of property you have, you may need to consult with 
your insurance agent about additional coverage that may be beneficial.
 
 But just because you own a small retail strip center with a couple of 
plate glass windows doesn’t mean you need to have the special coverage 
that’s offered. Insurance companies often have minimum policy premi-
ums, so certain insurable items and acts aren’t worth insuring because 
the potential for a claim is minimal and the costs are high.
 
✓ Broad-form coverage: You get the basic package, plus protection 
against losses of glass breakage, falling objects, weight of snow or ice, 
water damage associated with plumbing problems, and collapse from 
certain specific causes.
 
✓ Special form: This coverage is the broadest available and covers your 
property against all losses, except those specifically excluded from 
the policy. It offers the highest level of protection but is typically more 
expensive.
An insurance company can pay owners for losses in two ways:
 
✓ Actual cash value: The coverage pays the cost of replacing property 
less physical depreciation. The standard policies most insurance com-
panies offer provide for actual cash value coverage only.
 
✓ Replacement cost: This coverage pays the cost of replacing the prop-
erty without subtracting for physical depreciation. You must specifically 
have an endorsement and pay extra for replacement cost coverage. 
However, we do encourage you to purchase it.
 
As with homeowners’ insurance policies, the location, age, type, and quality 
of construction of your property are significant factors in determining your 
insurance premiums. Be sure to get an insurance estimate before you buy 
your property to avoid unpleasant surprises (older properties with wood 
shake shingles located away from fire protection may not even be insur-
able, for example) and realize the benefits of lower risk properties. For 
example, newer commercial buildings, and even some residential proper-
ties, were constructed with fire sprinklers and alarms that reduce your 
insurance premiums — so do as monitored intrusion alarms).
Some insurance companies have a coinsurance clause that requires rental 
property owners to carry a minimum amount of coverage. If you carry less 
than the minimum amount of coverage, the insurance company imposes a 
coinsurance penalty that reduces the payment on the loss by the same per-
centage of the insurance shortfall. For example, if you carry only $1 million in 
coverage when you should have $2 million, you’re only carrying 50 percent of 
the minimum required insured value. If the building suffers a loss, the insur-
ance company pays only 50 percent of the loss.

297
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Investment: Insurance and Risk Management
 
Many rental property owners first become investors by renting out their 
former personal residences when they buy new homes. They may not realize 
they should immediately contact their insurance agent and have their home-
owners policy converted to a landlord’s policy, which contains special cover-
age riders that aren’t in the typical homeowner’s policy. Because of the 
increased liability risk for rental properties, some insurance companies may 
not even offer this coverage, whereas others specialize in this business. Either 
way, obtain proper landlord’s coverage for your rental property, or you may 
face the possibility of having your claim denied.
 
If you own multiple investment or rental properties, consider
 
✓ A single insurance policy that covers all locations: Rather than have 
separate policies for each rental property, you can get better coverage 
with a single policy. For example, if you currently have three properties 
each with a $1 million policy, you could get a single policy with a $3 mil-
lion limit at a more competitive cost.
 
✓ An aggregate deductible: An aggregate deductible is the portion of your 
loss that you essentially self-insure, because the losses at any of your 
three properties can go toward meeting the aggregate deductible.
Excess liability (umbrella) coverage
Excess liability (umbrella) coverage can be a cost-effective way to dramati-
cally increase your liability protection and is designed to supplement your 
main or basic policies. An umbrella policy provides both additional and 
broader coverage beyond the limits of the basic commercial general liability 
insurance and other liability coverage and this coverage is only available 
after the primary policy limits have been exhausted.
Your primary policy may have liability limits of $500,000 or $1 million, but 
an umbrella policy can provide an additional $1 million in vital coverage at 
a cost of $2,000 to $4,000 per year. Depending on the value of your property 
and the value of the assets you’re seeking to protect, buying an umbrella 
liability policy with higher limits may make sense. Umbrella policies are avail-
able in increments of $1 million with even lower rates per dollar of coverage 
as the limits go higher. The most common umbrella coverage amount for the 
owners of large investment properties now is $5 million at an annual cost of 
approximately $7,500 to $12,000.
 
Purchase your umbrella policy from the same company that handles your 
underlying primary liability insurance package. The reason: If you have two 
different insurers rather than just one, the companies may have different agen-
das if legal problems arise.

298
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Additional insurance options
A variety of other insurance coverages also make sense for most rental 
property owners:
 
✓ Loss-of-rents coverage provides income (enabling you to make mortgage 
and other payments) if your property is severely damaged by fire or 
another calamity.
 
✓ Workers’ compensation insurance pays employees and covers their 
medical expenses if they’re injured or become ill as a result of their 
job. There are workers’ compensation laws in all states; be sure to fully 
comply with them. This insurance coverage is often available through 
a government agency, whereas private insurance companies also offer 
coverage in other areas.
 
 Although some states may not require you to carry this coverage unless 
you have a minimum number of employees, we advise carrying workers’ 
compensation coverage even if you don’t have any employees. For exam-
ple, any contractor you hire to perform work on your rental property 
should have his own workers’ compensation insurance policy to cover 
all of his employees. However, if someone gets hurt and the contractor 
has limited or even no coverage, his injured employee may target you 
for compensation. Don’t take chances; this coverage can often be added 
to your standard insurance policy for little cost.
 
✓ Non-owned auto liability coverage protects you from liability for acci-
dents and injuries caused by your employees while working and using 
their own vehicle. Also, require them to provide proof of a valid driver’s 
license (with a clean driving record) and proof that they currently have 
their own auto and liability coverage with reasonable limits.
 
✓ Fidelity bonds provide reimbursement if you have a dishonest 
employee who steals your rents.
 
✓ Endorsement for money and securities covers losses caused by dishon-
est acts of nonemployees.
 
✓ Building ordinance insurance covers the costs of demolition and 
cleanup, plus the increased costs to rebuild if your rental property is par-
tially or fully destroyed and the property needs to meet new or stricter 
building code requirements. This coverage is extremely important if 
your property is built at a higher density (more units or square footage or 
beyond height limits) than current zoning allows; it compensates you for 
the lost property value if you can’t rebuild the same size building.
 
✓ Flood, hurricane, and earthquake insurance are examples of coverage 
available for a separate cost. This coverage can be critical in the event 
of a natural disaster. However, these policies often are expensive with 
extremely high deductibles, making them unattractive for the average 
small rental property owner. Get quotes nonetheless, and see whether 
it’s something you think you can afford.

299
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Investment: Insurance and Risk Management
Determining the right deductible
The deductible is the amount of money that you must pay out-of-pocket 
before your insurance coverage kicks in and is a form of self-insurance (cov-
ering the potential loss yourself). Typically, deductibles for small rental 
property owners range from $500 to $1,000; larger real estate portfolios have 
much higher deductibles of $5,000 to $10,000. The higher the deductible, 
the lower is your insurance premium. As your financial ability to self-insure 
grows, evaluate the possibility of having a higher deductible and using your 
savings to purchase other important coverage.
Selecting potential insurers
 
The coverage you can get as a rental property owner varies among insurers, 
with some firms specializing in real estate. Be sure to interview and select a 
qualified insurance broker or agent who understands your unique needs. The 
insurance professional can then provide you with information on the kinds of 
coverage worth considering. Insurance professionals are either independent 
brokers or exclusive agents who just write policies for one company.
Mold: The heir-apparent to asbestos
One coverage that’s becoming much more dif-
ficult to obtain is a type of environmental insur-
ance that specifically covers mold, fungus, and 
related issues. The number and magnitude of 
mold claims by tenants of both residential and 
commercial type properties have become a 
real challenge to the insurance industry, with 
some highly publicized lawsuits claiming huge 
property damage and severe personal injury 
claims. Although certain insurance companies 
still offer limited coverage for mold and related 
causes, specifically inquire as to the exact pro-
tection included in your policy. Some policies 
don’t cover actual damages for property and 
personal injury but do offer a legal defense.
The best way to avoid claims of property 
damage and personal injury from mold is to 
properly maintain your property and only turn 
over possession to the rental unit or suite in 
good condition that’s documented in writing. 
The challenge with most mold claims is that 
water intrusion and the subsequent concerns 
about mold typically occur within the tenant’s 
space in areas where the owner has no access 
or control. Or the tenant can even be the cause 
of the source of moisture through negligence or 
inadequate cleaning.
Thus, the rental property owner must rely on 
the tenant to minimize the likelihood of mold as 
well as report any concerns immediately. Many 
owners now use a lease addendum advising 
tenants of their responsibilities in this area. 
Rental property owners should respond to all 
tenant concerns promptly and professionally 
while routinely inspecting accessible areas.

Part IV: Operating the Property 
As with any competitive product or service, speak with multiple indepen-
dent insurance brokers and a couple of exclusive company agents to ensure 
that you receive the best value on desired insurance coverage. Keep in 
mind that the lowest premium is often not the best policy or value for your 
specific needs.
In addition to the price of a policy and the insurer’s reputation and track 
record for paying claims, an insurer’s financial health is an important consid-
eration when you choose a company. Insurers can go belly up. Major rating 
agencies that research and evaluate the financial health of insurance com-
panies include A. M. Best, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, Duff & Phelps, and 
Weiss. Each rating agency uses a different letter-grade system. Some com-
panies use AAA as their highest rating, and then AA, A, BBB, BB, and so on. 
Others use A, A–, B+, B, B–, and so on.
 
During the financial crisis of 2008, as well as during other times, you may have 
heard about some insurers getting into trouble despite prior high ratings. That 
happens, but don’t worry about an insurer going belly up and not paying 
claims. Insurers are regulated and overseen at the state (and federal) level and 
troubled insurers are merged into stronger ones.
Just as it’s a good idea to get more than one medical opinion, two or three 
financial ratings can give you a better sense of the safety of an insurance 
company. Stick with companies that are in the top two — or, at worst, three — 
levels on the different rating scales. You can obtain current rating information 
about insurance companies by asking your agent for a listing of the current 
ratings.
 
After you’ve made your decision as to which policies and insurers you want 
to do business with, be sure that you pay the premium, and insist on evi-
dence that the insurance company has provided coverage. Typically, you 
receive a written binder as soon as you have coverage; however, your best 
proof of coverage is a formal certificate of insurance. The certificate of insur-
ance is essential — prudent real estate owners never rely on verbal represen-
tations that they’re covered.
Talking with tenants about 
renter’s insurance
Renter’s insurance is secured by and paid for by your tenants and covers 
losses to the tenant’s personal or business property as a result of fire, theft, 
water damage, or other loss. As a rental property owner, you benefit from 

301
 Chapter 16: Protecting Your Investment: Insurance and Risk Management
renter’s insurance because it covers any claims in the event that the tenant 
starts a fire or flood. The tenant’s premiums go up rather than yours.
 
Most commercial tenants have this coverage, but residential tenants often 
think they don’t need renter’s insurance because they have few valuables. But 
renter’s insurance covers much more than just their personal possessions; it 
also protects against liability claims made by injured guests or visitors. The 
insurance also offers supplemental living expenses if the rental unit becomes 
uninhabitable due to fire or smoke damage. And it protects the tenant in the 
event that the tenant causes damage to another tenant’s property. You can 
suggest or even require that your tenants carry rental insurance, but be aware 
that in some areas your competitors may not follow your lead and you may 
find that you’d have trouble keeping your rentals occupied if you insisted that 
your tenants carry renter’s insurance.
Dealing with claims
 
Record all the facts as soon as an incident occurs on your rental property, 
particularly if it involves injury. Because one of the primary issues in conten-
tion is the property condition at the time of the incident, a digital camera is 
extremely helpful to document facts and minimize extensive disagreements 
or discussions at a later date or during litigation. You can also use a recording 
device if you have obtained permission in advance from those involved (pref-
erably the acknowledgment should be in writing).
Be sure to immediately contact your insurance company or your insurance 
agent. Follow up with a written letter to ensure they were notified and have 
the information on file.
Put a reliable filing system in place to keep documents handy because liti-
gation may not occur until years after the incident. For example, if a young 
child is hurt on your property, the statute of limitations doesn’t begin until 
the child has reached 18 years of age. In these cases, the tenancy records and 
maintenance records may be subpoenaed and be critical to defending your 
actions of up to 20 years ago.

Recordkeeping and Accounting
In This Chapter
▶ Putting your files in order
▶ Tracking the income and expenses for your rental activities
R
ecordkeeping and accounting may not be the most exciting aspects of 
real estate investment property ownership, but they’re among the most 
rewarding. Every real estate owner should be interested in knowing how 
much money she’s making on her properties and how much she’s spending. 
She should also know how she can potentially reduce her taxes.
Traditionally, the least favored aspect of owning real estate is keeping all of 
the required paperwork and doing the accounting. More property managers 
have gained clients because of these essential but tedious requirements than 
any other reason. But recordkeeping has roles in maintaining your assets as 
well as documenting performance. And the accounting is the report card or 
feedback that tells you just how well you’re doing.
Now, we can’t turn you into an accountant in the course of one chapter. 
Whole books are written on the subject! But what we can do is provide you 
with practical and useful information that you can use to organize your 
recordkeeping and accounting practices, and we can provide you with addi-
tional sources of information.
Organizing Your Records
If you have an aversion to details and keeping track of things, managing your 
own investment rental properties may not be for you. If you own rental prop-
erty, you need to prepare many important written records and keep them 
ready for prompt retrieval. Scanning and storing documents electronically is 
easier today than ever, so you may opt to keep many of these files and copies 
of all important documents on your computer.

304
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Keeping records up-to-date and accurate
Maintaining complete and accurate records of all transactions is extremely 
important in the world of property management. Having your records 
squared away is necessary on three fronts:
 
✓ Taxation: You have to report your income and expenses for each rental 
property on IRS Form 1040 Schedule E to determine whether you have 
a taxable profit (or loss). The IRS requires rental property owners to 
substantiate all income and expenses by maintaining proper records, 
including detailed receipts of all transactions. Never get into a situation 
where you can’t support the accuracy of your tax returns.
 
✓ Financial management: If you don’t accurately document all the income 
streams coming in and the expense payments going out, you won’t be 
a real estate investor for long. Check out the “Knowing What You Must 
Account For with Rental Property” section later in the chapter for tips 
and information on this key aspect of your rental property.
 
✓ Litigation: Courts typically take the stance that residential tenants (and 
even small commercial tenants) are merely consumers, so the burden is 
primarily on the owner to provide any documents outlining the relation-
ship or understanding between the parties. If the owner can’t provide 
the required records, the tenant almost always prevails.
 
Here are a few documentation tips (check out the “Filing made easy” section 
later in the chapter for ideas on how to store this info):
 
✓ Document your income on income journals: Income journals are also 
called cash receipt journals and consist of the master rental income data 
collection sheet and ledgers for each individual rental unit or suite.
 
✓ Keep all bank deposit slips: Although your bank may require a deposit 
slip with your transaction, make a duplicate to keep for your records in 
case there’s a discrepancy between your recordkeeping and the bank’s 
records.
 
✓ Get a written receipt for all expenses: Rental property expenses, even 
if you write a business check, must have a written receipt to fully docu-
ment the expenditure. The IRS may not accept a check as proof of a 
deductible property expense unless you have a detailed receipt as well.
 
 If you have multiple rental properties, develop and assign a one- or two-
character code for each property and mark each receipt accordingly. 
(Indicate the unit or suite number, if appropriate.) When you have infor-
mation for multiple properties on a single receipt, make photocopies 

305
 Chapter 17: Recordkeeping and Accounting
and store the receipts in the folders you’ve set up for your respective 
properties. This way, you can provide evidence of the expense for each 
property instead of having to wade through all your folders looking for 
the information you need.
 
If you use your vehicle for your rental property activities, be sure to keep a 
detailed written log of all your mileage. Your mileage is a deductible business 
expense as long as it’s directly related to your rental property and you have 
accurate records to document the mileage. This simple log should indicate 
the date, destination, purpose, and total number of miles traveled. You may 
be surprised at the number of miles you travel each year for your rental 
activities — the deductible expense can be substantial.
Here’s a general guide of how long to retain your records:
 
✓ Keep all records pertaining to your rental property for a minimum of 
three to five years. (The time period depends on the legal requirements 
of the state regulatory commission or department of real estate where 
you live and/or own property.)
 
✓ For tax purposes, records regarding the purchase and capital improve-
ments made during your ownership need to be maintained for as long as 
you own the property.
 
✓ Certain property records such as those concerning injuries to minors 
should be maintained essentially forever. Although even the IRS has a 
statute of limitations (except in the case of fraud), the statute of limita-
tions for injuries to minors typically doesn’t begin to run until the minor 
reaches the age of majority (usually 18).
Filing made easy
Every rental property owner should have a basic filing system with separate 
records kept for each rental property. You may opt to keep many of the 
accounting records and files on your computer, but for owners of one to sev-
eral rental units, a manual system works just fine. Your filing system can be 
a simple accordion filing box with dividers, which you can find at any office 
supply store. If you own more properties and outgrow the accordion filing 
box, moving up to a lockable fireproof filing cabinet makes sense.
 
Organize your records at the property level and the unit level. You’ll have 
some documentation overlap, but the benefit of having complete, easily 
retrievable records at your fingertips greatly outweighs the effort involved 
in making some photocopies. Start at the property level, and construct the 
following:

306
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
✓ Ownership file: From the moment you take your first steps toward 
purchasing an investment property, begin storing your paperwork in a 
property ownership file. Keep all the important documents of this trans-
action, including purchase offers and contracts, the closing statement, 
appraisals, loan documents, insurance policies, due diligence inspection 
and pest control reports, and correspondence. Also keep a photocopy of 
your deed in the property file, and place the original in a fireproof safe 
or bank safety-deposit box.
 
✓ Income and expense files: Each of your rental properties should have 
its own file section with separate folders for income reports like rent 
rolls, as well as a separate folder for each of the major property expense 
categories. Keep copies of all receipts in the expense folders, so that 
when tax time rolls around, you can easily locate the information you 
need. Start a new file for each tax year.
 
✓ Master maintenance file: We recommend keeping a master property 
maintenance file for the records and receipts for all maintenance and 
capital improvements for each rental unit or suite and the common 
areas. This one-stop source gives you the records you need for all 
repairs and maintenance during your ownership and can be helpful for 
your accountant in calculating your basis in the property when you ulti-
mately sell or exchange the property.
Moving on to the unit level, put these files together:
 
✓ Tenant file: Create a separate file for each tenant that contains all the 
important documents for each tenant, including her rental application, 
lease agreement, the tenant ledger showing all charges and payments, 
all legal notices, tenant maintenance requests, and correspondence. 
Always keep the original of each document and provide the tenant with 
a photocopy. You’ll need the signed originals of all pertinent documents 
should legal action ever become necessary. Individual tenant files are 
closed out and a new tenant file established upon turnover of a rental 
unit to a new tenant.
 
 When your tenants vacate, attach a copy of any paperwork from the ter-
mination of their tenancy and bind the entire tenant file together. 
Transfer it to a separate file for all former tenants, filed alphabetically by 
rental property.
 
✓ Unit maintenance file: We recommend keeping a separate maintenance 
file for each individual rental unit or suite with the records and receipts 
for all maintenance and capital improvements. This system gives you a 
history of the physical condition of each rental unit or suite throughout 
your ownership. This file remains open even when the tenants change.

307
 Chapter 17: Recordkeeping and Accounting
Use a system for recording all significant tenant complaints and maintenance 
requests. This will provide a valuable paper trail if a dispute ever arises 
regarding your conduct as an owner in properly maintaining the premises. 
Failing to have good records may well hurt your case should a dispute esca-
late and end up in court.
Knowing What You Must Account 
For with Rental Property
The financial management aspects of accounting for all the funds you receive 
and expend are critical elements of running your real estate rental property 
activities. After all, the ownership and management of even a single rental 
property is a business, and the government expects you to have proper finan-
cial records in order to prepare your tax returns.
 
But proper financial management isn’t just for the benefit of the government. 
With accurate and timely information, you can manage your rental investment 
more efficiently and effectively. And when you decide to sell or exchange your 
rental property, your property will often generate a higher price if you have 
complete and accurate records, because buyers feel more comfortable know-
ing exactly what they’re purchasing.
 
New technology in banking is particularly helpful to the rental housing 
industry and is simplifying and expediting the rental collection and report-
ing procedures.
 
✓ Some rental property owners now offer their residential and especially 
their commercial tenants the ability to make rent and other payments 
by credit card, automatic draft (automated clearing house, or ACH), 
or increasingly by electronic fund transfers to the property owner’s 
account on a predetermined date.
 
✓ Even the traditional payment by check is enhanced with the advent of 
electronic check truncation, where check readers or data entry software 
at larger residential properties can capture the salient information from 
the tenant’s check and immediately debit their account. This electronic 
processing shortens the collection time and eliminates checks or money 
orders being returned for nonpayment.
 
✓ Online banking can also provide rental property owners the ability 
to make their own payments to vendors and suppliers electronically. 
Additionally, online banking provides access to records that immedi-
ately reflect all receipts and disbursements and minimizes the chance 
of fraud by employees handling cash by making the tracking of daily 
activity easier.

308
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Documenting income and expenses
If your tenants pay by check, you can always let the cancelled check serve as 
the tenant’s receipt, but the best policy is to provide a receipt whenever pos-
sible, regardless of the method of payment. Likewise, track your expenses by 
using checks or credit accounts rather than making cash purchases for which 
you receive generic receipts, because the legitimacy of generic receipts can 
be challenged.
Keep your rental property activities separate from your personal transac-
tions. Although the IRS doesn’t require you to keep a separate checking 
account for each rental property that you own, you need to be able to track 
the income and expenses for each property individually.
As you add rental units or commercial properties, the accounting becomes 
much more complex and the recordkeeping more critical. That’s when you 
must seriously consider hiring a property manager with good recordkeeping 
and accounting procedures who will create detailed monthly reporting that 
can be given to your accountant for tax planning and reporting.
 
Hiring a good tax advisor is a wise investment for even small rental property 
owners because tax rules are various and complex. For example, certain 
expenses can be classified as operating expenses and deducted in the current 
year to reduce your taxable income, but some expenses are considered capi-
tal items and must be depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life 
of the improvement.
 
✓ One of the advantages to owning real estate is that you can deduct all 
operating expenses from your rental income. These operating expenses 
include payroll, maintenance and repair costs, management fees, utili-
ties, advertising costs, insurance, property taxes, and interest paid on 
mortgage debt. You also benefit from depreciation, which is a noncash 
deduction that reduces your taxable income in the current year but is 
recaptured in the future. Depreciation is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 18.
 
✓ Capital items typically include your building equipment or components 
that extend the useful life of the building and have a longer life span 
or are brand new, rather than routine maintenance or a repair. Your 
accountant is usually instrumental in providing guidance as to which 
items can be expensed versus the items that must be capitalized.
 
 Rental property expenditures for capital items must be accounted for 
separately and are capitalized when their cost basis is depreciated or 
amortized over multiple years rather than deducted as an operating 
expense in the current year. This means that you aren’t able to reduce 

309
 Chapter 17: Recordkeeping and Accounting
your taxable income by the full cost incurred but by a prorated amount 
over several years. Your accountant will generate depreciation or cost 
recovery schedules indicating the amount that can be deducted each 
year. Also, your accountant can keep you informed about changes in the 
federal tax code that affect depreciation deductions of certain capital 
expense items.
 
✓ Some costs of financing, such as loan fees or points paid at the time of 
the loan, can’t be taken as an operating expense and must be amortized 
or taken incrementally over the life of the loan. However, if you refi-
nance or sell the property and pay off the loan, then you can take a full 
deduction of remaining unamortized loan fees in that tax year.
 
Be sure you accurately record the payment of a tenant’s security deposit. 
These funds aren’t typically considered income; instead, they’re considered a 
future liability that is owed back to the tenant if the tenant honors the terms of 
the rental agreement. The security deposit may become income at a later date 
if you apply any portion of it to cover delinquent rent, cleaning, repairs, or 
other charges.
Creating a budget and managing 
your cash flow
Every rental property should have a budget, which is simply a detailed esti-
mate of the future income and expenses of a property for a certain time 
period, usually one year. A budget allows you to anticipate and track the 
expected income and expenses for your rental property.
 
Many rental owners neglect to allocate and hold back enough money for pro-
jected expenses, so when it comes time to make a repair, for example, they 
don’t have the money set aside to cover it. If you set up a budget, you’re 
better able to anticipate your expenses.
Although the budget for a single-family or rental condo is fairly simple, a 
proper budget for a newly acquired multiunit apartment or commercial build-
ing can require some careful planning. That planning includes a thorough 
review of past expenses and the current condition of the property. Trends in 
expenses, such as utilities, can also be important when estimating the future 
cash flow of a rental property, so be sure you don’t overlook them. Check out 
the income and expense categories we cover in Chapter 12 — the process 
is essentially the same whether you’re formulating a prepurchase income/
expense pro forma or the annual budget for ongoing operation of the property.

310
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
Many owners rely on cash flow from their rental properties not only to cover 
their expenses but also to supplement their personal income. But particularly 
if you’re a small rental property owner, you need to have a built-in reserve 
fund set aside before you start taking out any rental income funds for personal 
reasons. Maintain a reserve balance large enough to pay your mortgage and 
all the basic property expenses for at least one month without relying on any 
rental income. When you don’t have long term leases with stable tenants or 
the local rental market has low demand for your type of rental property, it 
may make sense to increase your cash reserves to an amount that allows you 
to sleep at night. Also, remember to allocate funds to cover semiannual and 
annual expenses such as your property taxes (if not impounded by your 
lender) and potential income tax due on your rental property net income.
 
Set up a bank account where you set aside money for anticipated major capi-
tal improvements. For example, you may own a rental property that will need 
a new roof in the next five years. Rather than see your cash flow wiped out for 
several months when it comes time to pay for that new roof, you can begin 
setting aside small amounts of money into a capital reserve account over sev-
eral years. Lenders on large residential and commercial type properties often 
require the monthly funding of a capital item reserve and replacement 
account. For large apartment projects, this expense can be from $150 to $250 
per unit per year. The owner can periodically submit requests (with copies of 
paid invoices) for reimbursement of qualified expenditures such as appli-
ances, floor coverings, roofing, exterior painting, and other capital items.
Doing Your Accounting Manually
Most rental property owners begin their real estate investing with a single 
rental home or condo. At this level, the accounting is extremely simple and 
can be done manually with pencil and paper in a simple spiral notebook or 
an accountant’s columnar pad. But when you expand to multiple rental units 
or commercial properties, you need to look for better and more efficient sys-
tems that are geared to the specific needs of rental property accounting.
 
The classic manual accounting system for rental properties is a peg board set 
up for a one-write system (each transaction is entered once, using stacked 
carbon documents). A single entry records information needed for a consecu-
tively numbered rental receipt, the tenant’s individual ledger card, a bank 
deposit ticket, and the daily cash receipt journal that provides a master 
record of all transactions. This popular rental accounting system is still used 
by some rental property owners and managers and is available from 
Peachtree Business Products (800-241-4623 or www.property.pbp1.com).

311
 Chapter 17: Recordkeeping and Accounting
Using Software
When you own several properties, consider using a computer with a spread-
sheet or general accounting software program. Spreadsheet programs, such 
as Microsoft Excel, can handle a few rental properties. Somewhat better are 
the general business accounting packages, such as the entry-level Quicken, 
and the more advanced QuickBooks or Peachtree Accounting. These programs 
can handle and streamline all the basic accounting requirements of managing 
a handful of rental properties.
Recognizing the value of professional 
accounting software
 
However, as good as these programs are, they lack the specific rental prop-
erty features and reporting that are invaluable to effective property manage-
ment. If you have more than five rental properties, we strongly recommend 
purchasing a professional rental accounting software program. These pro-
grams typically offer the following:
 
✓ Complete accounting (general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts 
payable with check writing, budgeting, and financial reporting)
 
✓ Tenant and lease management, including many standard rental manage-
ment forms
 
✓ Tenant service requests, maintenance scheduling, and reminder notes
 
✓ Additional services such as electronic payments, tenant screening, pay-
roll, and utility billing
Another advantage to using the computerized rental property account-
ing software packages is the ability to have your mortgage and other bills 
deducted electronically. Or you can work with these software packages to 
pay your bills online. If your tenants pay their rent electronically as well, you 
can decrease the time you spend handling rent collection and accounting.
 
Many property management accounting packages are available for a nominal 
investment, but don’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Many of the less 
expensive systems may work in the short run, but if something goes wrong, 
you may be left stranded without technical support or help. If a software firm 
has only a few systems in place, you’re in for a much higher risk of program 
errors or incorrect results. The software may not even be updated or sup-
ported years down the road. Your financial investment, and all the timesaving 
and other significant benefits of computerized accounting, may be lost if the 
software package isn’t backed by a solid company.

312
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
When you use a management company, you typically receive several impor-
tant accounting reports within a couple of weeks after the end of each 
accounting month. If you review these reports regularly, they can provide 
you with a good understanding of your rental investments and give you the 
opportunity to inquire about or suggest changes in the operations. But if you 
manage your own property and do your own accounting, it’s important to 
actually review and analyze the financial reports in the same manner as you 
would if you had entrusted your investment to a property manager. You may 
think that you know everything you need to know about your rental property, 
and setting aside those monthly reports until tax time may seem harmless, 
but they’re great tools for improving your management results if you use 
them properly.
You can customize the financial reporting offered by software programs to 
meet your needs. Monthly reports often contain income and expense infor-
mation compared to the monthly budget as well as year-to-date numbers.
Identifying some of the better programs
Each of the many program types available has its own strengths and weak-
nesses. Following are a few programs that we highly recommend:
 
✓ Quicken Rental Property Manager (RPM): This entry-level program is 
from Intuit, the company that dominates the tax preparation and basic 
accounting software market. Unfortunately, it’s essentially just a rent- 
and expense-tracking tool, not a comprehensive, integrated accounting 
software package like the next three that we recommend.
 
 The main benefit to Quicken RPM is that you can print out income and 
expense information for your tax accountant, or you can easily export 
data if you use the companion Quicken TurboTax software.
 
 One major drawback (which may be addressed in future releases) is 
that Quicken RPM doesn’t integrate with Quicken personal financial 
software or QuickBooks. Also, it doesn’t have useful features like check 
register or online rent receipts/bill pay. You may want to start with 
Quicken RPM, but only if you’re looking for a basic program at a very 
affordable price (under $100) that can keep you organized and better 
prepared at tax time.
 
 RentRight: If you want a more-advanced, fully integrated, built-in 
accounting package and own fewer than 50 rental units, we recommend 
you use RentRight. This software package, from Domin-8 Enterprise 
Solutions, has many features of the more robust TenantPro (featured 
next) but at an affordable price range that starts at $250. Visit www.
rentright.com for more details.

313
 Chapter 17: Recordkeeping and Accounting
 
 Tenant Pro: We recommend using Tenant Pro, an advanced, compre-
hensive, Windows-based rental accounting software package offered 
by Domin-8 Enterprise Solutions, if you own between 50 and 500 rental 
units. It combines a property management database and a complete 
accounting system with general ledger, accounts receivable, and 
accounts payable modules, eliminating the need to enter data twice. 
This is powerful yet easy to use property management software that 
tracks information on owners, properties, units, tenants, and vendors.
 
 The additional features — which are available for purchase and deal 
with tenant background screening, electronic rent collection and credit 
card payments, maintenance request tracking, payroll, online payments, 
and rental insurance — offer an advantage. Another great feature avail-
able is the module for utility metering and billing that simplifies charging 
tenants for their individual utility usage.
 
 Tenant Pro is available in different versions depending on the number of 
units you own or manage, and pricing ranges from $595 to $2,195. This 
program is perfectly suited for rental owners with both residential and 
commercial properties. Tenant Pro is also an excellent choice for small 
property management companies, particularly due to a new feature 
that exports tenant payments to the general ledger in Intuit’s popular 
QuickBooks program.
 
 Its reporting capabilities are impressive, with more than 120 customiz-
able financial and property management reports. You can generate 
reports in Microsoft Excel or export them to an alternate electronic 
format for e-mailing to clients or posting on an internal Web site. Tenant 
Pro is also integrated with Microsoft Word and includes more than 45 
property management letters and agreements. When you outgrow your 
current module, you can upgrade to the next level by paying the differ-
ence in price rather than losing your initial investment. Tenant Pro is an 
excellent accounting package for rental owners who want to have the 
benefits of efficient accounting and recordkeeping. Go to www.tenant
pro.com for more information and to download a free demo.
 
✓ Yardi Systems Property Management Solutions: For rental property 
owners or property management companies with portfolios of at least 500 
or more rental units, we recommend the Yardi Voyager asset and prop-
erty management software suite. Robert’s property management com-
pany uses this industry-leading, browser-based software, and been very 
impressed with its ability to provide real-time daily and weekly report-
ing needed to effectively manage properties. Yardi Voyager also offers 
detailed monthly financial reports, which allows his company to provide a 
greater level of service to clients and outperform the competition.

314
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
 For smaller property owners and managers, Yardi also offers a fully inte-
grated, Windows-based product, Yardi Genesis, with much of the same 
functionality of Voyager, but with less sophisticated reporting capabili-
ties and more limited accessibility. Yardi Voyager is accessible anywhere 
via the Internet, whereas Yardi Genesis is accessible only through a 
local network. Both of these software solutions include all of the basics 
features of prospect and tenant management, fully integrated accounts 
receivable and accounts payable, general ledger, and cash management. 
As a bonus, they also allow ready access to information, elimination of 
duplicate entries, and spontaneous delivery of reporting.
 
 Yardi has annual service fees, which range from $1,700 to $5,000 
per year for Yardi Genesis and $17,000 to $100,000 per year for Yardi 
Voyager, depending on the number of users, modules, and hosting 
options. Yardi is also a leader in the Application Service Provider (ASP) 
arena, where it hosts and maintains your database on redundant servers 
and performs all IT functions, including automatic software upgrades. 
This offering can save any size organization tremendous costs on both 
staffing and hardware, and it’s becoming an increasingly popular option. 
Although the initial ASP users are typically larger real estate owners and 
property managers, increasing numbers of owners and managers with 
small to medium rental property portfolios are implementing this tech-
nology for competitive and cost-saving reasons.
 
When evaluating different software packages, gather as much information as 
possible. Be sure to talk to actual product users, preferably people in your 
area with comparable rental properties and similar accounting needs. 
Determine what features a program offers, how easy it is to operate, its com-
puter hardware requirements, the availability and cost of technical support, 
and the strength and reputation of the company backing the product. Obtain a 
demo or trial version of the software that you can use before you buy, just to 
make sure it’s truly what you want.

Tax Considerations and 
Exit Strategies
In This Chapter
▶ Mastering the tax advantages of real estate investing
▶ Exploring tax-deferred exchanges
▶ Looking into other exit strategies
R
eal estate is a great investment that offers you the opportunity to leverage 
a small cash investment to own and control large holdings that generate 
cash flow and can appreciate significantly over time. But cash flow, leverage, 
and appreciation aren’t the only advantages of real estate. Utilizing current real 
estate tax laws has always been a key benefit for real estate investors.
Applying tax strategies properly allows rental real estate investors the ability 
to shelter income and even to eliminate — or at least defer — capital gains. 
Success in real estate, like all investments, is generally determined by how 
much money you keep on an after-tax basis. Real estate offers the potential to 
minimize taxation, so real estate investors need a thorough understanding of 
the best techniques to optimize their financial positions.
 
We discuss tax advantages in this chapter, but don’t let tax considerations 
drive your decisions. Purchasing real estate should always be an economic 
decision. Only when a deal makes economic sense (both at time of purchase 
and after sale) should you consider the tax aspects. Also, real estate taxation 
is a constantly changing, complicated area. Although this chapter covers the 
key concepts, it isn’t a substitute for professional tax advice. Every real 
estate investor needs a competent accountant or tax advisor (who special-
izes in real estate) on her investment team. We recommend that you meet 
with your tax advisors regularly throughout the year, rather than only just 
before the tax filing due date.
Because the subject is so entwined in tax considerations, we also cover real 
estate sales — also known as exit strategies. The tax implications of various 
exit strategies are important to understand so that the real estate investor 
can minimize the tax consequences of selling real estate holdings.

Understanding the Tax Angles
The tax laws regarding investment real estate are unique and far more complex 
than those regarding homeownership. For example, a homeowner can’t deduct 
his costs of operating and the repairs and maintenance of his home — but as 
the owner of a rental property, you can deduct such costs. Also, the benefits of 
depreciation apply only to rental real estate and aren’t available for property 
held as a personal residence.
 
Tax laws change frequently, so check with your tax advisor before taking any 
action. Use a certified public accountant (CPA), an enrolled agent (EA), or a 
tax specialist to prepare your tax returns if you have investment real estate. 
In the sections that follow, we discuss some important rental real estate tax 
concepts that you should understand if you want to make the most of your 
property investments.
Sheltering income with depreciation
Depreciation is an accounting concept that allows you to claim a deduction 
for a certain portion of the value of a rental property because the building 
wears out over time. Depreciation is an expense, but it doesn’t actually take 
cash out of your bank account. Instead, you treat the depreciation amount as 
an expense or deduction when tallying your income, which decreases your 
taxable income and allows you to shelter positive cash flow from taxation. 
Depreciation lowers your income taxes in the current year by essentially pro-
viding a government interest-free loan until the property is sold.
 
The use of depreciation by real estate investors can be used to defer, but not 
permanently eliminate, income taxes. The annual deduction for depreciation 
is a reduction in the basis (calculated as your original cost in the property 
plus capital improvements) of the rental property, which is recaptured (added 
to your taxable profit) in full and taxed upon or sale. Currently, all deductions 
taken for cost recovery are recaptured and taxed at a rate not to exceed 25 
percent when you get rid of the property.
 
Depreciation is only allowed for the value of the buildings and other improve-
ments, because the underlying land isn’t depreciable. The theory is that the 
buildings and other improvements ultimately wear out over time but the land 
will always be there. Because the amount of your depreciation deduction 
depends on the highest portion of the overall property value being attribut-
able to the buildings, it’s advantageous to allocate the highest fair market 
value of your rental property value to the improvements to increase your 
potential deduction for depreciation.
To determine the appropriate basis for calculating depreciation, many 
real estate investors have traditionally used the property tax assessor’s 

317
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
allocation between the value of the buildings and land. But the IRS doesn’t 
allow the assessor’s allocation. It does accept an appraisal, which can be 
quite expensive unless you have a recent one available. But a more cost-
effective method that the IRS accepts is the Comparative Market Analysis 
(CMA) that most brokers offer at a nominal charge or even for free.
 
Before 1993, depreciation could be accelerated in the early years of rental 
property ownership. This option led to poor decision making on real estate 
deals that were motivated by the significant tax shelter offered by real estate, 
with only a secondary concern about return on investment or appreciation. 
See the “How depreciation and tax shelters have changed” sidebar in this 
chapter for more information.
But under current tax laws, recently acquired rental properties can only use 
straight-line depreciation. Straight-line depreciation reduces the value of the 
rental property by set equal amounts each year over its established depre-
ciable life. The period of time during which depreciation is taken is called 
the recovery period. For properties placed in service or purchased on or after 
May 13, 1993, the IRS requires straight-line depreciation with the following 
recovery periods:
 
✓ Residential rental property: The recovery period is 27.5 years (or a cost 
recovery factor of 3.636 percent each year). A property qualifies as resi-
dential if the tenants stay a minimum of 30 days or more and no substan-
tial services are provided, such as medical or health care.
 
✓ Commercial properties: The recovery period is 39 years (or an annual 
cost recovery of 2.564 percent). Mixed-use properties are classified as 
commercial unless the income from the residential portion is 80 percent 
or more of the gross rental income.
The cost recovery deductions for both the year of acquisition and the year 
of sale must use the midmonth convention requirement, which means that 
regardless of the actual day of sale, the transaction is presumed to have been 
completed on the 15th of the month. Thus, the depreciation deduction is pro-
rated based on the number of full months of ownership plus ½ month for the 
month of purchase or sale.
 
Commercial property owners typically modify vacant spaces to get potential 
tenants to sign a lease. The IRS requires that the cost of those improvements 
be depreciated over 39 years even though the lease and the actual useful life 
of the improvements are much shorter. This topic is a constant source of lob-
bying by commercial real estate interests seeking depreciation schedules that 
more closely coincide with the actual length of lease. The tax laws were 
changed temporarily to a 15-year cost recovery from 2004 through 2009. You 
can take a deduction in the current year for the full remaining undepreciated 
portion of the tenant improvements that was torn out as a result of one tenant 
vacating and new tenant improvements being installed for the next tenant. For 
example, if you replace carpet that hasn’t been fully depreciated, you can 
deduct the remaining unamortized value in that tax year.

318
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Minimizing income taxes
Taxpayers generally have two types of income:
 
✓ Ordinary income: This category includes wages, bonuses and commis-
sions, rents, and interest and is taxed at the federal level at various rates 
up to 35 percent. The taxable income you receive from your rental prop-
erty is subject to taxation as ordinary income.
 
✓ Capital gains: These are generated when investments (such as real 
estate and stock) are sold for a profit. The income you realize upon the 
sale of your investment property is subject to taxation as a capital gain. 
Capital gains are classified as short-term and long-term:
 
• Short-term: For property held for 12 months or less, capital gains 
are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
 
• Long-term: For property held for longer than 12 months, gains are 
taxed at lower rates than ordinary income with a current rate of 
0 percent or 15 percent, depending on your overall tax bracket. 
(These rates are set to expire in 2010 and may change with a major 
Congressional tax bill likely sometime in 2009 or 2010.
But you can’t pay taxes until you figure out exactly what part of your income 
will be taxed. To do that, you need to perform a cash-flow analysis. The cash 
flow from a property — positive or negative — is determined by deducting 
all operating expenses, debt service interest, capital improvement expenses, 
damages, theft, and depreciation from rental income.
Calculating the cash flow of a property follows the format shown in Table 
18-1. We provide the details for most of these items in Chapter 12. Here, we 
provide a quick summary and then factor in the taxman.
 
1. Start with the Gross Potential Rental Income (GPI) for the property.
 
 This figure is the hypothetical maximum rent collections if the property 
were 100 percent occupied at market rents and all rents were collected.
 
2. Add the other income affected by occupancy (laundry income at an 
apartment building would be one example) and then deduct the rent 
that isn’t collected due to vacancy or the failure of tenants to pay to 
arrive at the Effective Gross Income (EGI).
 
3. Add the other income not affected by occupancy (for instance, the 
income from the rental of a cellphone tower on the roof) to the EGI to 
establish the Gross Operating Income (GOI).
 
4. Subtract the operating expenses from the GOI to calculate the Net 
Operating Income (NOI).

319
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
 
 As we discuss in Chapter 12, the NOI is the essential number used in the 
income capitalization method of determining the value of the property.
 
5. Subtract the capital improvements and interest paid on the debt ser-
vice from the NOI to arrive at the before-tax cash flow.
 
6. Subtract the straight-line depreciation (which is merely a noncash 
accounting deduction that reduces your tax liability without requiring 
an actual cash expenditure) from the before-tax cash flow.
 
 The result is the taxable income.
 
7. Multiply this year’s taxable income or reportable loss by your ordi-
nary marginal income rate to determine your tax liability or savings.
 
8. Deduct the tax liability (or savings, if the taxable income is negative 
and the loss can be used in the current tax year) and the annual debt 
service principal payments from the net taxable income and then add 
the noncash deduction for the straight-line cost recovery.
 
 You now have the after-tax cash flow.

Understanding passive and active activity
In 1986, Congress enacted passive income and loss provisions to eliminate 
the abuse of real estate tax shelters that were structured primarily to provide 
considerable tax benefits for investors.
 
Rental owners often start out with their real estate activities serving as second 
incomes. The majority of their income often comes from professions and 
sources totally unrelated to real estate. The taxation rules that apply to these 
part-time real estate investors are different from the ones that apply to real 
estate professionals. Unless you qualify as a real estate professional (dis-
cussed later in this chapter), the IRS classifies all real estate activities as pas-
sive and sets limits on your ability to claim real estate loss deductions.
A special IRS relief provision exclusively for rental real estate activities may 
permit a moderate-income real estate investor to offset other income with up 
to $25,000 in excess losses from rental real estate. The potential deduction 
is limited to a maximum of $25,000 per tax year for all real estate investment 
properties combined. Real estate investors can take a rental property loss 
deduction of up to $25,000 against other income in the current tax year as 
long as their adjusted gross income doesn’t exceed $100,000. If the adjusted 
gross income exceeds $100,000, the real estate investor will be denied 50¢ of 
the loss allowance for every dollar over $100,000, so that the entire $25,000 
loss allowance disappears at an adjusted gross income of $150,000. In order to 
be able to take this deduction, the following four requirements must be met:
 
✓ The properties must qualify. Certain types of properties don’t qualify, 
including net leased properties and vacation homes in a rental pool.
 
✓ The taxpayer must own a minimum of 10 percent of the property 
based on value. Interestingly, the IRS allows a taxpayer to include the 
interests held by his or her spouse even if they don’t file a joint return.

321
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
 
✓ The taxpayer must actively participate in the management. This 
rule doesn’t mean the real estate investor can’t utilize a management 
firm. A real estate investor can meet the active participation require-
ment by simply communicating with his management company about 
the approval of new tenants, determining the rental terms, approving 
repairs or capital improvements, or making other similar decisions.
 
✓ The taxpayer must file her tax return as an individual. Corporations, 
certain trusts, and other forms of ownership aren’t allowed to take this 
special deduction.
Any losses disallowed in one year are called suspended losses and can be 
saved and applied to reduce rental or other passive income in future years. 
If the suspended losses can’t be used in this manner, the real estate inves-
tor will be able to use them when she sells the rental property to effectively 
reduce the taxable gain. Thus, the losses ultimately benefit the investor, but 
the time value of money concept (which shows that money becomes worth 
less over time due to inflation) indicates that the ability to use the losses now 
is worth more than some time in the future.
Qualifying as a real estate professional
The IRS passive loss rule states that all real estate rental activities must be 
treated as passive income with only two possible exceptions:
 
✓ The maximum of up to a $25,000 deduction for some taxpayers as dis-
cussed in the “Understanding passive and active activity” section earlier 
in the chapter
 
✓ The relatively small number of individuals that can meet the IRS require-
ments to be classified as real estate professionals
For a taxpayer meeting the eligibility requirements relating to his real estate 
activities, the rental real estate activities in which he participates aren’t sub-
ject to the $25,000 limitation. Real estate investors who can be classified as real 
estate professionals are permitted to deduct all of their rental real estate losses 
from their ordinary income, such as current employment income (wages, com-
missions), interest, short-term capital gains, and nonqualified dividends.
The IRS has defined a real estate professional as an individual who materially 
participates in rental real estate activities and meets both of the following 
requirements:
 
✓ More than 50 percent of her personal services or employment were 
performed in a real property business or rental real estate activities, 
including acquisition, operation, leasing, management, development or 
redevelopment, construction or reconstruction, and brokerage.

322
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
✓ These activities represented at least 750 hours per tax year. (Work 
hours as an employee don’t qualify unless the taxpayer is at least a 5 
percent owner of the employer.)
These individuals are considered active investors and are allowed to claim 
all their real estate loss deductions in the year incurred, to offset positive 
taxable income or offset gains at the time of sale. But the IRS considers each 
interest of the taxpayer in rental real estate to be a separate activity, unless 
you choose to treat all rental real estate interests as one activity. This choice 
is an important step. Consult with a tax advisor to determine whether aggre-
gating your rental real estate activities is advantageous and, if so, to make 
sure you properly make the required election when filing your tax return.
But qualifying as an active investor is complicated. The IRS now allows the 
taxpayer to qualify as a real estate professional by combining hours spent 
on rental and nonrental real estate activities. For example, even a part-time 
real estate broker or property manager may be able to demonstrate over 
1,000 hours in a typical year in qualified real estate activities such as listing 
and selling, leasing and managing rentals, and renovation or construction. 
So meeting the 750 hours isn’t a problem, but the 50 percent test requires 
that the 1,000 real estate activity hours be more than 50 percent of all work 
hours in a year. This threshold can be a problem if you have other extensive 
nonqualified work activities, and a new calculation must be made each year. 
If you do qualify, carefully document your activities and the hours spent in 
each through appointment books, calendars, or narrative summaries.
 
A potentially useful real estate investment strategy for some married couples 
is to have the stay-at-home spouse become an active real estate agent or prop-
erty manager and accumulate at least 50 percent of his or her employment or 
business time with a minimum of 750 hours per year selling and managing the 
family rentals. With the real estate professional qualification met, their rental 
activities are now active, and they can deduct all of their rental real estate 
losses. However, lawyers can’t get a break, because the IRS has specifically 
ruled that real estate attorneys can’t qualify.
 
Material participation, which requires the real estate investor to be involved 
“in a regular, continuous, and substantial manner,” shouldn’t be confused with 
active participation (which we define in the “Understanding passive and active 
activity” section earlier in the chapter).
Exit Strategies
A successful investment strategy doesn’t simply involve buying and oper-
ating properties. The disposition or exit strategy has a significant impact 
on overall success. What good is a real estate wealth-building plan if you 

323
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
put little or no thought into the end game? Begin your exit-strategy plan-
ning while you’re acquiring property. That is, develop a game plan to work 
towards before you buy the asset. You can always change or modify your 
plans, but knowing your exit strategy prior to acquisition is good practice.
You do your homework, buy the right property at the right price, and add 
value by maintaining and improving the property and obtaining good tenants. 
So, why undo your good work by selling the property for less than it’s worth 
or paying too much in taxes because you failed to explore ways to defer your 
capital gains (which can keep more of your money working to keep your port-
folio growing)?
 
When you’re looking to buy rental real estate with appreciation potential, seek 
those properties that have deferred maintenance and cosmetic problems that 
allow you to buy them at a good price. When you go to sell your property, you 
want to get full value, so before you begin to list or show your available prop-
erty, scrutinize the curb appeal and physical condition, looking for those 
items that need attention. Don’t rely on your own eye; ask a trained, profes-
sional real estate agent or property manager who isn’t familiar with the prop-
erty to give you some feedback. Some individuals and companies offer 
services called staging (placing temporary furniture and other items in the 
dwelling to make it more appealing) to reduce the required marketing time 
and maximize the value of the property being sold.
 
We thoroughly cover the purchase agreement and other issues involved in a 
real estate transaction in Chapter 13. Because we firmly believe that the 
proper and ethical way to conduct business in real estate is to use standard-
ized forms and practices, there’s no need to present new forms or tactics that 
are slanted to favor your position as the seller. In the long run, you benefit by 
treating people fairly in your real estate transactions. If you build a reputation 
for being ethical, you receive many more opportunities than if you use one-
sided methods designed to take advantage of others.
When it’s time to sell the property, you have several options, but not all of 
them have the same tax consequences.
Selling outright
One exit strategy is to simply sell the property and report the sale to the IRS. 
As long as capital gains tax rates are low, this strategy may work for taxpay-
ers who are nearing the end of their prime real estate investing years and are 
looking to slow down and simplify their lives.
In an outright or all-cash sale, you simply sell the property, report the sale to 
the IRS, and determine whether you have a taxable gain or loss. If it’s a gain, 
taxes are due; if you’ve held the property for at least 12 months, the low 

324
Part IV: Operating the Property 
capital gains tax rates of 0 percent or 15 percent apply. (Seller financing isn’t 
considered an all-cash sale, nor is an installment sale, which we cover later.) 
Don’t forget the 5, 15, or 25 percent tax rate on cost recovery deduction 
that’s triggered on the sale.
Although an outright or all-cash sale is fairly straightforward, real estate 
investors are often interested in postponing the recognition of their gain on 
sale so that they can postpone the payment of taxes due. This situation is 
where an installment sale or an exchange (discussed later) can be useful.
 
Although the sale of a property can make sense, remember that refinancing an 
investment property with substantial equity is another great way to free up 
additional cash for real estate acquisitions, other investments or purposes.
Calculating gain or loss on a sale
 
As we indicate in Chapter 17, it’s extremely important to prepare and retain 
accurate records from the initial purchase of your rental property and 
throughout the ownership because the sale of a real estate investment prop-
erty must be reported to the IRS.
Several factors go into the required calculation to determine whether there’s 
a gain or loss on the sale which can either increase or reduce the overall 
income:
 
✓ The sales price is a major factor.
 
✓ Any capital improvements made to the property should be included.
 
✓ Accumulated depreciation taken during the holding period increases 
your taxes when it’s recaptured.
 
✓ Also, if the property had operating losses that couldn’t be taken in prior 
tax years, those suspended losses increase the adjusted basis and lower 
the potential taxable gain (or increase the loss available to shelter other 
income).
Table 18-2 outlines the following gain (or loss) on sale calculation.
Step 1: Determine the net sales proceeds
The net sales proceeds are the gross sales price minus the selling expenses 
(see Table 18-2). The selling expenses are all costs incurred to complete the 
sales transaction such as real estate commissions, attorney and accountant 
fees, settlement and escrow fees, title insurance, and other closing costs.

Total gain (or loss) on sale
$750,000
Step 2: Determine the adjusted basis for the property
When the property is just acquired, the basis is simply the original cost of the 
property (the equity down payment plus the total debt incurred to finance 
the property plus closing costs, appraisal, and environmental reports). If the 
owner didn’t purchase the property, the basis is one of the following:
 
✓ The fair market value at the time of transfer for property received as an 
inheritance
 
✓ The carry-over basis if the property is received as a gift
 
✓ The substituted basis if the property was acquired in a tax-deferred 
exchange.
However, the basis isn’t static — it changes during the ownership period. To 
adjust the original basis, take three factors into account (see Table 18-3 for 
the sample calculations):
 
✓ Capital improvements: During the holding period, owners often make 
some capital improvements or additions to the property. Capital 
improvements are money spent to improve the existing property or con-
struct new property. These capital improvements are added to the origi-
nal acquisition cost to determine the adjusted basis.
 
 Routine and normal repairs required to keep the property in good work-
ing order over its useful life are deductible expenses during the tax year 
in which they’re incurred. They’re not capital improvements for the 
purpose of the adjusted basis calculation. For example, replacing a few 
shingles or even re-roofing a portion of the property is a repair, but com-
pletely replacing the roof is a capital improvement. A newly constructed 
addition that increases the rentable square footage of the rental prop-
erty is a capital improvement. The capital improvement includes all 
costs incurred such as contractor payments, architect fees, building 
permits, construction materials, and labor costs.

326
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
✓ Depreciation: At the same time, the straight-line depreciation taken 
each tax year is accumulated and reduces the adjusted basis of the 
property. Note that the total accumulated depreciation is included in the 
overall calculation of the gain or loss upon sale as part of the adjusted 
basis but is reported separately and is taxed at a different rate on the 
taxpayer’s tax return.
 
✓ Casualty losses taken by the taxpayer: Casualty losses can result from 
the destruction of or damage to your property from any sort of sudden, 
unexpected, or unusual event such as a flood, hurricane, tornado, fire, 
earthquake, or even volcanic eruption.

Step 3: Determine the total gain or loss on the sale
The total gain or loss is determined by taking the net sales price and sub-
tracting the adjusted basis (see Table 18-2).
Step 4: Factoring in accumulated cost recovery and suspended losses
If you have suspended losses reported on the taxpayer’s tax returns during 
the ownership period, deduct them from the net sales proceeds (see Table 
18-4). The suspended losses are those losses that the taxpayer couldn’t use in 
prior tax years because he didn’t meet the strict IRS requirements. See the 
“Understanding passive and active activity” section earlier in the chapter for 
more info. That figure is the capital gain from appreciation.

327
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
Step 5: Determine total tax liability
The net gain on sale is taxed as ordinary income unless the property was 
held for more than 12 months. Fortunately, most real estate investors do 
hold the property for more than 12 months and can qualify for the lower 
long-term capital gains tax rates. In fact, if the property has been held less 
than 12 months, all depreciation that has been taken is recaptured as ordi-
nary income.
For tax purposes, the net gain on sale must be allocated between the capital 
gain from appreciation and the recapture of the accumulated depreciation. 
The seller doesn’t automatically get the benefits of the lower flat 0 or 15 
percent maximum capital gains tax and may even have to pay the maximum 
depreciation recapture tax rate of 25 percent if she’s in a higher income tax 
bracket as is the investor in our example. (The depreciation recapture rate is 
based on your ordinary income tax bracket but won’t exceed 25 percent.)
In Table 18-4, the total gain on sale of $750,000 is reduced by $100,000 in 
accumulated depreciation and suspended losses of $75,000 for a gain from 
appreciation of $575,000. In Table 18-5, we break the taxation of the capital 
gain down between capital gain from appreciation and depreciation recap-
ture. The accumulated depreciation is recaptured at 25 percent, resulting in a 
tax liability of $25,000. The gain from appreciation was taxed at the maximum 
capital gains flat rate of 15 percent, resulting in a tax liability of $86,250. So, 
the total tax liability is $111,250.

If the sale of the property results in a net loss, the loss must first be applied 
to offset net passive-activity income or gains. If there are none, or after 
they’re exhausted, the net loss can be applied to reduce the income or gains 
from nonpassive activities such as earned income or wages.

328
Part IV: Operating the Property 
Selling now, reaping profits later: 
Installment sale
An installment sale is the disposition of a property in which the seller 
receives any portion of the sale proceeds in a tax year following the tax 
year in which she sells the property. The time value of money indicates 
that it’s generally better to have the use of money today than in the future. 
Knowledgeable real estate investors seek ways to minimize or defer the taxes 
that they need to pay. One way to accomplish this goal is by using the install-
ment sale method — within specified IRS limits, the sellers of real estate can 
report their receipt of funds as actually received over time rather than as a 
lump sum at the time of the sale.
 
A taxpayer who sells his property on the installment method is able to report 
only the pro rata (proportionate) part of the proceeds actually received in that 
tax year. The advantage is that the taxable gain is spread over several years 
and can be reported in years in which the taxpayer may have a lower tax 
bracket. This technique is ideal for property sellers who don’t need to take 
their equity at the time of sale because they have other sources of income or 
want to minimize taxes or both.
This scenario includes transactions in which the seller provides the financing 
and received payments over time. When financing is difficult for buyers to 
obtain, sellers may offer to take a mortgage note from the buyer for some (or 
even all) of their equity in the property. As discussed in Chapter 5, having the 
seller take a note for equity is a common no-money-down strategy.
 
An installment sale can be an effective way for a seller to assist the buyer in 
making the purchase as well as to defer the recognition of income and thereby 
reduce the capital gains tax.
Here’s how it works: A real estate investor sells a property for $1.5 million 
that has an adjusted basis of $700,000. The buyer makes a down payment of 
$250,000, assumes the current loan balance of $500,000, and accepts seller 
financing of $750,000. The terms of the installment sale require the buyer 
to pay the principal balance of $750,000 owed to the seller at $250,000 each 
year over the following three years, plus interest. The buyer reports the gain 
according to the timing of the principal payments.
The amount of the gain that must be reported in a given tax year is equal to 
the total principal payment multiplied by the profit ratio. The profit ratio is 
calculated as follows:
Profit Ratio = Gross Profit ÷ Contract Price

329
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
The gross profit is the sale price minus the selling costs and adjusted basis.
Sale price
$1.5 million
Minus costs
$50,000
Minus adjusted basis
$700,000
Gross profit
$750,000
The contract price is the sale price minus the current loan balance.
Sale price
$1.5 million
Minus loan balance
$500,000
Contract price
$1 million
Therefore, in this example, you figure the profit ratio as follows:
Profit Ratio = Gross Profit ÷ Contract Price
Profit Ratio = $750,000 ÷ $1 million
Profit Ratio = 75 percent
With the profit ratio, you can compute the gain that must be reported each 
year.
Year of sale: $250,000 × 75% =
$187,500
Year two: $250,000 × 75% =
$187,500
Year three: $250,000 × 75% =
$187,500
Year four: $250,000 × 75% =
$187,500
Thus, the seller reports $187,500 as the gain in the year of sale, plus $187,500 
for each of the next three years. The interest paid by the buyer to the seller 
on the deferred principal payments is reported by the seller as ordinary 
interest income.
If this example were an outright sale, the seller would report the entire 
$750,000 gain in the year of sale, but the installment sale allows her to report 
the gain as the principal payments of $187,500 are received each year for four 
consecutive years. There’s no difference in the total gain, simply the timing 
of the reporting of the gain.
 
Although there are many proponents of the buying-and-flipping real estate 
investment strategy, they often overlook the fact that flipping properties for a 
quick profit can have significant and expensive tax implications. If the IRS sees 
that you routinely buy and flip properties, it classifies you as a dealer — a tax-
payer who buys property (called inventory in this case) with the intention of 

330
Part IV: Operating the Property 
selling it in the short run — as opposed to an investor, a person who purchases 
properties seeking appreciation and income from long-term ownership. It’s 
possible for real estate investors to simultaneously hold some properties for 
long-term investment and other properties the IRS classifies as inventory, 
making the owner a dealer. The dealer label comes with two drawbacks:
 
✓ Dealers aren’t allowed to use the installment sales method to spread the 
recognition of their gain over multiple tax years. The entire profit must 
be reported and fully taxed in the year of the sale.
 
✓ Profit from the sale of a property is considered earned income and is 
taxed as ordinary income at your personal income tax rate — even if 
you hold the property for longer than 12 months. (If you hold a property 
for longer than 12 months, it’s typically eligible for the long-term capital 
gains tax rate, and a dealer would thus lose this benefit.)
Transferring equity to defer taxes
The concept behind a tax-deferred exchange is that an investor can transfer 
the built-up equity in one property to a new property and maintain, essen-
tially, the same investment except that the physical asset is different. The IRS 
considers a qualified tax-deferred exchange to be one continuous investment 
and thus no tax is due on the profit from the sale of the relinquished asset as 
long as the investor invests all proceeds into the replacement property.
Tax-deferred exchanges are often referred to as 1031 exchanges — the name 
comes from Section 1031 of the IRS Code that covers them. And there are 
actually three different types of tax-deferred exchanges:
 
✓ A straight exchange in which two parties trade properties of approxi-
mate or equal value.
 
✓ A three-party or multiparty exchange, which involves three or more par-
ties buying, selling, or exchanging properties. This situation happens 
when one party in an exchange doesn’t want a property owned by the 
other party but prefers the property currently owned by a third party. 
These transactions can actually involve any number of owners and can 
be quite complex. They should only be done with the ongoing advice 
and consultation of an experienced tax professional.
 
✓ A delayed exchange — sometimes also referred to as a Starker exchange — 
which allows the sale of the relinquished property and the purchase of 
the replacement property to occur at different times as long as strict 
rules are followed. This exchange is by far the most used 1031 exchange. 
(Reverse Starker exchanges can also be completed when an accommoda-
tor, on behalf of the taxpayer, acquires a replacement property first and 
then sells the relinquished property at a later date.)

331
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
 
The capital gains tax is deferred, not eliminated. If you sell your property 
during your lifetime and don’t qualify for a tax-deferred exchange, you pay tax 
on both the capital gain and the recapture of the total depreciation taken 
since the original investment.
Meeting your goals
A tax-deferred exchange is an important tool if you’re looking to increase the 
size of your real estate holdings. Tax-deferred exchanges can be effective tools 
to postpone the recognition of a gain on real estate investments. They allow 
the investor to transfer equity to a larger property without paying taxes. Plus, 
there’s no limit to how often or how many times that a taxpayer can use an 
exchange. Therefore, you can keep exchanging upward in value, adding to your 
assets over your lifetime without ever having to pay any capital gains tax.
 
The tax-deferred exchange is particularly useful for real estate investors who 
specialize in buying and renovating properties and want to reinvest their prof-
its into a larger property rather than sell the property and run the risk of being 
classified by the IRS as a dealer. A tax-deferred exchange can also help you 
achieve other goals such as
 
✓ Trading for a property in a better location.
 
✓ Acquiring a property with better cash flow.
 
✓ Making better use of the significant equity that can exist in properties 
held for many years. Plus, those properties have typically exhausted 
their depreciable basis, and an exchange can enhance that.
Following the rules
As with any transaction that involves those three letters — IRS — you must 
play by the rules for the 1031 exchange:
 
✓ The relinquished property and the replacement property must both 
be investment real estate properties located in the United States. 
Actually, the majority of all tax-deferred exchanges involve properties 
domestically, but the IRS does allow a tax-deferred exchange of a foreign 
property for another foreign property. The key is that both properties 
must be domestic or foreign — no mixing and matching is allowed!
 
✓ You must trade only like kind real estate. Like kind real estate means 
property held for business, trade, or investment purposes. The broad 
definition of like kind doesn’t mean same kind. It allows real estate inves-
tors to use a 1031 exchange, for example, to defer taxes when they sell 
an apartment building and buy raw land, or vice versa; exchange a sin-
gle-family rental home for a small office building; and so on. But neither 
your personal primary residence nor property held as inventory where 
the investor is defined as a dealer (see the “Installment sale” section ear-
lier in the chapter) qualifies.

332
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
✓ An exchange must be equal to or greater in both value and equity. 
Any cash or debt relief received is considered to be boot (any receipt 
of money, property, or reduction in liability owed) and is taxable. For 
example, if you want to complete a tax-deferred exchange and the 
property you relinquish is valued at $1 million with a loan balance of 
$500,000, you must purchase the replacement property for more than $1 
million, and its equity has to be equal to or greater than $500,000.
 
✓ A neutral third party should be involved. This neutral third party, 
called a facilitator, exchanger, or accommodator, should be appointed 
prior to the closing of any escrow. An exchange agreement must be 
signed, and the neutral third party must hold the proceeds unless the 
properties close simultaneously.
 
✓ The potential replacement property must be clearly and unambigu-
ously identified in writing within 45 days from the close of the relin-
quished property. The IRS has limitations on how many replacement 
properties may be designated, or taxpayers would simply identify a 
long list of potential replacement properties. There are three specific 
tests to meet this requirement; they can get quite technical, but the 
most-commonly used is the three property rule. Under this rule, you 
can designate a maximum of three replacement properties of any fair 
market value, and you must purchase one or more of those properties.
 
✓ The closing of the replacement property must occur within 180 days 
of the close of the relinquished property. Meeting this requirement 
isn’t as easy as it may sound, as we detail in the next section.
Counting (and countering) complications and risks
The tax-deferred exchange has some complications and risks. Our experience 
is that the identification of the replacement property within 45 days can be 
a real challenge, especially because only a limited number (usually three) of 
properties can be identified. In a tight or competitive real estate market, the 
real estate investor can quickly find himself unable to actually complete the 
purchase of the replacement property within the 180-day limit, in which case 
the sale becomes a taxable event.
 
Real estate owners looking for a replacement property (commonly called an 
upleg) are often tempted to chase a property and overpay. They rationalize 
that the capital gains deferral is so valuable that they can justify overpaying 
for the property because they’d otherwise have to pay taxes of the recognized 
gain. But such investors should realize that this isn’t a tax-free exchange, only 
a deferral of a gain that may be taxable in the future.

Don’t use commingled 1031 accounts
Leading 1031 exchange accommodator Land-
America’s November 26, 2008, bankruptcy filing 
should alert all real estate investors to the real 
perils regarding what firm they choose for han-
dling their 1031 exchange and holding their 
funds. In the case of LandAmerica’s Exchange 
Services Company, the company held hundreds 
of millions of dollars from more than 400 real 
estate investors. Unfortunately for real estate 
investors using LandAmerica’s 1031 Exchange 
Services (LES), their funds were placed into a 
pooled or commingled account and got caught 
up in the parent company’s bankruptcy filing. 
LandAmerica got itself into trouble by investing 
this commingled money in 20-year maturity auc-
tion rate securities backed by student loans. In 
the past, there was an active liquid market for 
these securities, so LandAmerica was able to 
pocket millions of dollars in interest investing its 
1031 customers’ money. Because of the turmoil 
in the financial markets during 2008, the market 
for auction rate securities dried up and pushed 
LandAmerica into bankruptcy. LandAmerica 
could have avoided this by having all its cus-
tomers use separate or so-called segregated 
accounts titled something like “for the benefit 
of Joe Property Investor” in an FDIC insured 
bank. This precaution would have protected the 
customers’ money from bankruptcy, lawsuits 
against the exchange accommodator or parent 
company, and so on. 
LandAmerica isn’t the first 1031 exchange 
company to take client money down with the 
company. 1031 Tax Group, a Richmond, Virginia–
based 1031 accommodator, and Southwest 
Exchange of Henderson, Nevada, both went 
under in 2007 with possible fraud involving 
more than $200 million missing between these 
two companies. 
So how could this kind of thing happen, 
especially after Fortune magazine named 
LandAmerica its number one most admired 
company in the mortgage services industry in 
2007? 1031 companies are unregulated, and 
few people understood the risks of companies 
like LandAmerica putting customers’ funds into 
commingled accounts. Plus, some 1031 accom-
modators quote lower transaction-handling fees 
and then make up for that lower fee by gaining 
investment interest on a customer’s funds. 
You can take a few steps to help ensure you 
don’t end up in this kind of situation. First and 
foremost, conducting your 1031 exchange with 
an intermediary who uses segregated accounts 
for each customer. Also make sure that the full 
value of your account is protected at the bank 
you use. FDIC insurance is generally limited to 
$250,000 per account holder. Last but not least, 
some 1031 customers may not realize when an 
accommodator company they’re using isn’t in 
compliance with tax rules. Remember: 1031 
exchange companies don’t generally provide 
tax advice unless they employ tax experts on 
staff.

334
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
In 2000, the IRS issued new guidelines that clarify the proper use of the reverse 
1031 exchange. A reverse 1031 exchange can be complicated and should only 
be done with the guidance of an experienced tax advisor. Essentially, it allows 
real estate investors to have an accommodator purchase and hold their new 
investment properties while they then follow the 1031 guidelines to sell the 
relinquished property. The advantage is that the real estate investor is sure to 
have the replacement property in hand; one of the major challenges to a 1031 
exchange is the risk involved in having to identify the replacement property 
within 45 days and complete the acquisition within the 180-day limitation. You 
should have a written exchange agreement, and title to the replacement prop-
erty must be taken in the name of the accommodator until your relinquished 
property is sold.
Calculating the substituted basis
The calculation of the basis of the new property can be quite complicated 
if anything other than the property is exchanged. In an exchange, the tax is 
deferred and the potential gain is carried forward by calculating the substi-
tute basis for the new replacement property. An example of a substitute basis 
calculation without any boot is shown in Table 18-6. This substitute basis 
would be used in the event you sell the property during your lifetime without 
doing a tax-deferred exchange and have a taxable transaction. See your tax 
specialist to deal with any additional variables in the transaction.

Using the capital gains exclusion 
to earn a tax-free gain
 
Another great tax benefit available for homeowners and real estate investors 
alike is the capital gains exclusion under Internal Revenue Code 121. Many 
investors have found that the principal residence capital gains exclusion can 
be the core of a profitable (and tax-free) investment strategy known as serial 

335
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
home selling. (For more information on this topic, see Chapter 2.) Simply buy 
and move into a property that can be renovated and sell it after a minimum of 
two years, and you can earn a tax-free gain of up to $500,000.
The gain on the sale of a principal residence is tax free up to $250,000 for 
individual taxpayers and up to $500,000 for married taxpayers who file jointly 
if they meet some simple requirements:
 
✓ You must own and have occupied or used the home as your principal 
residence for a total of 730 days (24 months) in the last 60 months — 
ending on the date of sale or exchange. The occupancy doesn’t have 
to be continuous, and the home doesn’t need to be your principal resi-
dence at the time of the sale or exchange. Only one spouse needs to 
legally hold title, but both must meet the use test.
 
 The factors considered by the IRS to determine whether a property 
meets the principal residence use test include
 
• Is the residence used as the address of record for driver’s license, 
tax returns, utilities, credit card bills and other billed items, and 
employment purposes?
 
• Is this residence where you actually reside and where you keep 
your furniture, furnishings, and clothes?
 
✓ Generally, the seller can only use the exclusion once every two years. 
Vacations and short absences count as usage for the two-year use test.
The IRS provides partial principal residence exemptions for sellers who don’t 
qualify for the full exemption. The partial exemption is based on the number 
of actual months the seller qualified divided by 24 months. A partial exemp-
tion is allowed for
 
✓ Work reasons: For instance, a change in employment where the home 
seller’s new job location is at least 50 miles farther away from the old 
principal residence than the former job location.
 
✓ Health reasons: For instance, the need to move to care for a family 
member or a broad range of health-related reasons. Consult with your 
tax advisor, because you can meet this requirement in many ways — 
particularly if the move is recommended by a physician.
 
✓ Unforeseen circumstances: Examples run the gamut and include a 
divorce or legal separation, engagement break-up, death, incarceration, 
multiple births, large increase in assessment dues, lost job or demotion, 
becoming ineligible for unemployment compensation, and so on. Many 
circumstances can qualify as unforeseen circumstances, so see your tax 
advisor for more information about your specific situation.

The taxation of real estate is complicated and constantly changing, so we 
have just covered the tip of the proverbial iceberg here. If you want in-depth 
details and advanced real estate tax strategies, we strongly recommend 
Vernon Hoven’s The Real Estate Investor’s Tax Guide (Dearborn Financial 
Publishing). Vern has a master’s degree in taxation and teaches accounting 
and tax professionals all the new laws at his popular seminars. This excellent 
book has more than 300 pages dedicated to explaining all the ins and outs of 
real estate taxation with many examples that bring the material down to an 
understandable level.
Selling as a lease-to-own purchase
The typical lease option combines a standard lease with a separate contract 
giving the tenant a unilateral option to purchase the rental property during a 
limited period of time for a mutually agreed upon purchase price. The rental 
property owner has agreed to sell the property during a limited period of 
time; however, the tenant isn’t required to exercise the option. (For more on 
lease options, see Chapter 3.)
 
Investors can use the lease option to increase cash flow and also sell their 
properties without paying the usual brokerage commissions. A lease option is 
really a real estate rental transaction combined with a potential sales transac-
tion and financing technique. The seller can generate additional cash flow 
because a lease option generally consists of a monthly rental payment that’s 
higher than the market rent, with a portion of the additional payment being 
applied to the option purchase price. Both parties can realize a savings on the 
brokerage commission because the transaction is usually completed without 
the full services of real estate brokers. But it’s a good idea to have either an 
experienced broker or real estate attorney review the transaction documents, 
which is a minor (but worthwhile) expense.
Working through an example
Each lease option is unique, but here’s an example of how a deal may be 
structured: An investor owns a rental home with a current market rent of 
$1,000 per month and a current market value of $120,000. Real estate fore-
casts indicate that appreciation will be 4 percent, or approximately $5,000, in 
the next 12 months.
The tenant signs a 12-month standard lease and agrees to pay $1,200 per 
month with $1,000 in rent and $200 as a nonrefundable option fee that applies 
to the down payment. The investor and tenant also enter into an option-
to-purchase agreement that offers the tenant the right to buy the property 
within 12 months of the lease for $125,000 (the agreed upon estimated fair 
market value of the property by the end of the option period).

337
 Chapter 18: Tax Considerations and Exit Strategies
The investor receives an additional cash flow of $200 per month. If the tenant 
exercises the option, the tenant receives a credit toward the down payment 
of $200 per month for each month that he paid the option fee. If the investor 
has used her standard lease form and the lease option documents are drafted 
properly, she still has the right to evict the tenant for nonpayment of rent or 
any other material lease default.
 
In most cases, tenants don’t exercise the purchase option because they 
haven’t accumulated the money required for the down payment and their 
share of the closing costs. In the meantime, you’ve increased your monthly 
rental income by $200 and had a good tenant. At the end of the option, the 
tenant is aware that he has paid an additional $2,400 in rent that would’ve 
been applied to the down payment or purchase price if he’d exercised his 
option. You can either renegotiate an extension of the purchase option with 
the tenant or you can negotiate a new lease without the purchase option.
Proceeding with caution
 
Avoid long-term lease options. Real estate appreciation can be unpredictable. 
Don’t provide a set option purchase price for any longer than one or two 
years, or include a clause that the purchase price will increase by an amount 
equal to the increase in the average median home price in your area.
If you’re interested in using a lease option, have a real estate attorney with 
extensive experience in lease options review the lease and option contract in 
advance. Lease options can have serious business and even ethical problems 
if not properly drafted. If not structured properly, your lease option may be 
considered a sale with the following negative consequences:
 
✓ A lease option may trigger the due-on-sale clause with your lender, who 
may force you to pay off the entire outstanding loan balance.
 
✓ If the property is deemed a sale by the IRS, you can no longer use your 
tax benefits of depreciation and deductible expenses.
 
✓ Your property may be reassessed for property taxes. In many parts 
of the country, reassessment is based on a change in ownership. 
An aggressive tax assessor can use the lease option to increase the 
assessed value. Investigate local reassessment policies in advance.
 
✓ You may be liable for failure to comply with seller disclosure laws. 
There are severe penalties if you don’t make the legally required disclo-
sures, including those found on the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) 
discussed in Chapter 14.
 
✓ You may not be able to evict the tenant even if he defaults on the lease. 
The courts may consider that the tenant is really a buyer and that a 
traditional eviction action doesn’t apply because the lease option is 
essentially a contract to purchase real estate. This situation may require 
expensive and lengthy court proceedings.

338
Part IV: Operating the Property 
 
Ethically, keep the nonrefundable option fee reasonable, so if the value of the 
property declines or your tenant doesn’t exercise her option for any reason, 
you can feel comfortable that the tenant has been treated fairly. Or you may 
want to renegotiate or consider offering an extension.
Transferring your property 
through a gift or bequest
 
A property given as a gift carries the same tax basis from the seller to the new 
owner. For example, if the tax basis of the property is $100,000, even though 
the fair market value at the time of the gift is $500,000, the recipient’s tax basis 
remains $100,000. If the recipient were to immediately sell the property, he 
would have a taxable gain of $400,000. Thus, gifting property to heirs during 
your lifetime may not be the best strategy.
But death provides a tax-free transfer of real estate. Some investors are deter-
mined to avoid paying tax completely and have adopted a strategy of buy and 
hold for life. They use the tax-deferred exchange for years to rollover their 
gains into larger and larger properties and then completely avoid paying tax 
by never selling. Real estate transferred to your heirs upon death receives 
a full step up in basis. So in the example above, the party inheriting the real 
estate with a fair market value of $500,000 now has a tax basis of $500,000 
and will only owe taxes on any future gain. So, if you want to make your real 
estate wealth creation strategy span multiple generations, consider taking 
advantage of these tax benefits!

a Property’s Return
In This Chapter
▶ Increasing cash flow
▶ Encouraging equity build-up
▶ Taking advantage of tax benefits
▶ Appreciating appreciation
A
s we cover in Chapter 12, there are essentially four basic ways that you 
can receive a return on your real estate investments — cash flow, equity 
build-up from loan paydown, tax benefits, and property appreciation. A great 
aspect of real estate is that you can buy properties according to your particu-
lar financial and personal needs. Different properties are geared more toward 
achieving one of these types of return than another. For example, an investor 
with significant earned income may focus on properties with tax benefits and 
not worry as much about cash flow. Investors nearing retirement prefer prop-
erties with cash flow. And all investors look forward to appreciation.
Successful real estate investors continually ask themselves, “How can I 
improve the returns on my real estate investment in each category?” In this 
chapter, we highlight more than ten of the best ways that you can enhance 
your return on investment with rental properties.
Raise Rents
Although most rental properties have other sources of income, the largest 
source is almost always the rents. Real estate investors wisely begin with an 
understanding that rent increases lead to greater cash flow.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
However, setting the proper rent and maintaining the optimum market level 
rents upon turnover of tenants is one of the most common challenges faced 
by property owners. Many rental property owners are reluctant to raise rents 
because they’re concerned that their good tenants may leave. This is a valid 
concern, but it shouldn’t prevent you from getting rents to market level — 
one of the fastest and simplest ways to improve your cash flow. Of course, 
you should always look for cost-effective ways to improve the property and 
make sure that your rents are competitive and a fair value.
 
We recommend raising the rental rate modestly each year rather than wait-
ing for two or three years and then hitting your tenants with a major increase 
all at once. Tenants are less likely to move as a result of this slower strategy; 
they understand that the costs of operation are rising slightly each year. 
Most commercial leases contain annual rent adjustments tied to a consumer 
price index or set rental rate increases. Use this effective strategy for all 
types of rental property.
If your rents are already at market levels, look to make upgrades to the prop-
erty to justify higher rents. Maybe the addition of a combination microwave/
exhaust vent unit above the stove or the installation of a deck or awning can 
provide an improvement that justifies higher rent. Any improvements that 
enhance the quality of living or bring the property to a level similar to higher 
priced properties in the area can lead to increased market rents.
Reduce Turnover
The single most important factor in determining the expenses of most rental 
properties is turnover. In both residential and commercial properties, tenant 
turnover is simply bad for the bottom line. A tenant moving out almost 
certainly means a loss in rental income, plus you’re hit with the increased 
expenses (maintenance and repairs and capital improvements) to make the 
rental unit or suite available to show a prospective tenant. Signing long-term 
leases with qualified tenants, continually maintaining the property in top con-
dition, and being responsive to the tenants can help reduce tenant turnover, 
which directly improves the Net Operating Income and cash flow.
Another effective tool to reduce the loss of rent during tenant turnover is 
to prelease the rental unit or tenant suite. If you can prelease the rental to 
a new tenant only a few days or weeks after the current tenant vacates, you 
dramatically reduce your lost rent and increase your cash flow. After you 
receive a tenant’s notice to vacate, immediately seek permission to enter 
and determine what you need to do to make the property ready for the next 
tenant. Also begin advertising for a new tenant and gain the cooperation of 
the departing tenant to show the property.

343
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus) Ways to Increase a Property’s Return
Consider Lease Options
A lease option is an agreement that allows the tenant the right to purchase 
the leased property at a predetermined price for a certain period of time. 
Sellers typically use lease options in slow real estate markets to create addi-
tional interest in the property — even a potential buyer currently without a 
down payment has the opportunity to eventually become a homeowner.
There are many other benefits to the rental property owner willing to offer 
a lease with an option to purchase the property. You can often sell the 
property for a value above the current market, and the lease option usually 
requires a one-time option fee that you can keep if the buyer can’t exercise 
the option. Also, the renter/buyer typically pays a higher monthly rental 
payment with a lease option because a portion of the payment is applied to 
the ultimate purchase price. The higher monthly payments can be beneficial 
to you if the cash flows for the property are currently negative. Check out 
Chapter 3 for more on lease options.
Develop a Market Niche
Rental properties catering to seniors have always been popular, and the 
demographics clearly support continued attention to this dynamically grow-
ing market niche. Some senior properties are targeting those in need of 
special care and food services, and that is difficult for many landlords. But 
there is a growing need for properties with activities and social programs 
that appeal to active seniors and don’t require specialized skills or significant 
capital investments.
Robert has had success in Las Vegas (of all places!) with smoke-free apart-
ments. After a long day at work in a smoke-filled environment, a health-
conscious nonsmoking resident doesn’t need to have smoke wafting into her 
rental unit from her neighbor’s. Although there are additional costs upfront 
in thoroughly cleaning, completely repainting, and installing all new flooring 
and window coverings, the demand (and thus the occupancy) for these units 
is high.
According to a study by the National Multi Housing Council (NMHC), student 
housing is also a great opportunity, with Generation Y (those born between 
1982 and 2001) coming of age and going to college in record numbers. Some 
real estate investors find the market ripe for renovating rental units; college 
students nowadays would rather have a private rental unit with their own bath-
room facilities and a high-speed Internet connection than a traditional dorm.

Maintain and Renovate
The curb appeal or first impression that your property gives is critical to 
your overall success. Far and away the easiest way to increase cash flow and 
increase value is to simply clean up and address the deferred maintenance 
found in most properties. One of the fundamental rules of real estate is 
simple supply and demand. If your property really stands out and looks much 
better than comparable properties, you generate high demand; your rental 
will stay occupied at top market rents. That’s what cash flow is all about.
Besides the simple deferred maintenance, another great way to increase cash 
flow (and value) is to renovate the property. The key here is to spend money 
only on items that enhance the property and provide a quick payback.
 
For residential rentals, the best return on investment inside the units is found 
in updating the baths and kitchens. Access control for parking and building 
entry can also be a positive enhancement in urban areas, because crime is a 
concern for many tenants. For commercial properties, upgrading dated inte-
rior common areas with higher-quality materials and fixtures generally offers 
the greatest return.
One of the most cost-effective ways to increase the aesthetics and curb 
appeal of any type of property is through landscaping improvements. Often 
you can simply replace dead plantings. If you want to do more, have your 
landscaping maintenance firm make suggestions or contact a landscape 
architect. With the water becoming more expensive every day, be sure to 
look into the installation of an automated, water-conserving, drip irrigation 
system.
Cut Back Operating Expenses
One of the first steps to take after you purchase a rental property is to evalu-
ate current operating expenses. You want to see whether there’s room for 
improvement, particularly without negatively impacting your tenants.
Asking the local utility companies to perform an energy audit can pinpoint 
ways for you to reduce expenses. New technology is making the use of solar 
energy and hydronics systems extremely attractive. The rapidly increasing 
costs for water and sewer services in many areas of the country have made 
the installation of individual submeters cost effective for allocating and 
recouping the cost from each tenant based on her actual usage. The best way 
to achieve conservation of resources at your properties is to make your ten-
ants directly responsible for their cost. This not only saves you money but 
also has many positive societal benefits!

345
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus) Ways to Increase a Property’s Return
 
Another great way to reduce your operating costs without any reduction in 
value is to combine your various rental properties under one insurance policy. 
Contact your insurance broker for details.
Scrutinize Property Tax Assessments
A review of the expenses for most rental properties indicates that the prop-
erty tax expense is often one of the largest costs in owning real estate. In 
many parts of the country, property taxes are tied to the value of the real 
estate. If that’s true for your area and real estate values decline, contact your 
local assessor and inquire about getting a reassessment. A lower assessment 
leads to a direct reduction in your property tax bill and a corresponding 
increase in your cash flow.
 
You may feel helpless against the bureaucracy, but remember that tax asses-
sors have been known to make clerical errors or to fail to take all factors into 
account when valuing rental property. If you feel that your assessment is too 
high, contact your assessor. She may be willing to make an adjustment if you 
back up your opinion with careful research and a good presentation. Or you 
may need to make a formal property tax protest. Protests are often first heard 
within the assessor’s office or a local board of appeal. If a dispute continues, 
appeals may be taken to court in many states.
Refinance and Build Equity Quicker
Although you may have little control over interest rates and are at the mercy 
of your lender unless you have a fixed-rate loan, don’t forget that refinancing 
to a lower rate can have a tremendous impact on your cash flow. Of course, 
going with an interest-only loan or a 40-year amortization can also reduce 
your debt service payment and increase your cash flow, but these options 
are extremely risky and not advised.
You can enhance your equity build-up through refinancing to a shorter-term 
loan. When you first purchase a rental property, your rental income to make 
your mortgage payments is typically very tight, and you need to use financ-
ing with 20-year or even 30-year amortization terms. But after you’ve owned 
the property for several years, you may find that the cash flow has improved 
to the point that the property can handle a higher mortgage payment. That is 
when you refinance your long-term mortgage to a shorter-term mortgage, so 
that the amount of principal reduction paid with each payment dramatically 
increases.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Another way to achieve similar results is to arrange to make additional pay-
ments designated as principal reduction. This strategy can significantly 
reduce the total amount of interest paid over the remaining life of the loan 
and bring the loan payoff date much closer because the interest paid on the 
loan is a function of the outstanding principal balance.
 
Before refinancing or making additional principal payments, make sure that 
your loan doesn’t have a prepayment penalty. Lenders count on a certain 
return on their money, and the early payoff of a loan results in additional 
costs, so they may include a penalty in the first few years of the loan. Also, 
some lenders waive prepayment penalties if they handle your refinance.
Take Advantage of Tax Benefits
The tax benefits received from real estate vary from investor to investor, but 
most rental property owners find tax benefits to be a boost to their return.
Even novice real estate investors can take advantage of the generous tax 
savings with the capital gains exclusion for their principal residences. This 
exclusion allows sellers to completely eliminate any income tax on their 
capital gain of up to $500,000 if they meet the simple requirements outlined 
in Chapter 18. For investors willing to live in the property during renovation, 
the serial homeselling investment strategy can be used every couple of years 
to produce tax-free profits.
Real estate investors in large residential and commercial properties routinely 
use a simultaneous or tax-deferred exchange, which allows them to keep 
their money working rather than paying taxes. The more money you have 
invested in real estate, the better your cash flow and your accumulation of 
wealth.
As we cover in Chapter 18, depreciation or cost recovery allows the owner to 
take a noncash deduction that reduces the taxable income from the property. 
Land isn’t depreciable, so the amount of depreciation is determined by the 
value of the buildings. One way to maximize real estate’s potential tax shelter 
is to be aggressive in allocating as much of the acquisition cost of the prop-
erty to the buildings to generate a larger deduction for depreciation.
Depreciation deductions are a noncash item, so they often result in a taxable 
loss even though the actual cash flow for the property is positive. Even if you 
can’t immediately use a taxable loss to offset other earned income, you can 
use it in years that you have passive income such as a profitable taxable sale 
of another rental investment property.

347
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus) Ways to Increase a Property’s Return
Be Prepared to Move On
When most people think about real estate, they correctly determine that 
appreciation is where the real money is made. Over time, real estate has 
proven to be an investment that retains and increases in value. Even an aver-
age annual rate of appreciation of 5 percent dramatically increases your net 
worth over time.
However, appreciation can be heavily influenced by outside forces, such as 
the condition of the neighborhood and the local economy. That is why real 
estate investors need to perform a thorough due diligence review as dis-
cussed in Chapter 14. But even after you buy a property, you can’t simply sit 
back and let the investment ride as the area deteriorates around you. If the 
neighborhood you’re in starts to take a downward turn, be prepared to sell 
and reinvest in a more dynamic area that offers more upside potential.
Add Value Through Change in Use
The entrepreneurial spirit of real estate investors is also rewarded when 
they’re able to increase the return from real estate by adding value through 
a change in use. A change in use is taking land that isn’t currently being used 
optimally or, as appraisers phrase it, for its highest and best use and reposi-
tioning the property in a manner that results in the highest value. There are 
several common ways to achieve this, including
 
✓ Entitlements: The process of gaining the necessary approvals to put 
land to a more productive use is an extremely powerful way to increase 
the value of real estate. In nearly every city or town in the country, 
some land uses — typically agricultural — become less productive (or 
inadequate) as the area is developed. Taking the steps to get this land 
approved as residentially or commercially zoned property can dramati-
cally enhance property value.
 
✓ Conversion of use: The conversion of real estate to another use isn’t a 
new idea, but real estate entrepreneurs have increasingly practiced the 
concept in recent years. Other examples of change in use include the 
conversion or redevelopment of apartment rentals to for-sale housing or 
the modification of old warehouses to residential lofts and offices.
 
✓ Lot split: Traditionally, this is the dividing of a larger parcel of raw land 
into several smaller parcels. The sum total received for the individual 
parcels is much greater than the value of the original parcel. Another 
strategy is to develop or locate a residential rental property that can 
be split into multiple lots with each parcel containing one to four units, 

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
because apartments with four or fewer units receive more favorable 
financing. You can then offer these investment properties to individuals 
at a price significantly higher than what the entire property would go for.
 
✓ Assemblage: The other side of the lot split strategy is assemblage — the 
purchase of two or more smaller parcels with the intent to combine 
them into a larger parcel that can be more efficiently developed. This 
method of adding value to real estate can be quite lucrative, particularly 
in older built-out areas that are ripe for redevelopment. This often hap-
pens in areas (like beach communities) where there’s high demand and 
increasing population. Real estate investors buy several individual con-
tiguous lots and then sell the property to a developer who builds a small 
multifamily apartment building.
Improve Management
 
Management is the one aspect of owning real estate that offers owners an 
advantage over other types of investments. You can’t call the CEO of a large 
company and tell him to change his company’s product or pricing, but supe-
rior management of your own rental properties can have a direct impact on 
your results.
The ability to control and immediately implement different management 
strategies can lead to more satisfied tenants and longer-term tenancies. Some 
owners are very hands-on with their properties, and others prefer to let a 
professional handle the day-to-day challenges, but a savvy investor knows 
that the best returns on investment go to owners that have top management.

M
any real estate infomercial gurus and seminar kings make it sound 
really easy for anyone to make a fortune in real estate overnight. 
Buying foreclosures or properties with no money down can provide hand-
some returns, and there’s no doubt that the acquisition of real estate below 
its intrinsic value enhances your chances of financial success.
This is simply the traditional sage advice (buy low, sell high) applied to real 
estate. And if you can do it routinely and without problems with title, devas-
tating physical problems, or the negative tax consequences of being declared 
a dealer by the IRS, this tack can be quite fruitful.
However, finding well-located, physically sound properties that are available 
at below-market prices isn’t simple. Our experience is that most sellers know 
property values and don’t simply give away their property. We often think 
that the old saying “You get what you pay for” was coined by a real estate 
investor who just bought a foreclosure only to find it has a large unrecorded 
tax lien or a cracked slab.
In our experience, successful real estate investors tend to be savvy, hard 
working, conscientious individuals who enthusiastically perform comprehen-
sive due diligence before buying a property. They don’t reinvent the wheel 
with each deal, because they know their market niche, personal skills, and 
available resources. They have a vision and use their tried-and-true game plan 
for each property. If you develop these talents, you can uncover unique prop-
erties with value-added potential that are often missed by your competitors.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Robert refers to this method of real estate investing as the get-rich-right 
strategy. The best news of all for new real estate investors is that this plan 
can be undertaken anywhere and initially can be done part-time. In this chap-
ter, we give you ten methods to achieve a real estate fortune by using the get-
rich-right method.
Build up Savings and Clean up Credit
We disagree with some who imply that you can begin your real estate invest-
ment career without any cash. Our experience is that the best opportunities 
and the most options are available to the real estate investors who have both 
cash and good credit. So don’t procrastinate — begin working on this step 
right now.
Sellers aren’t likely to provide financing to a buyer with a poor credit history; 
because the purchase of real estate virtually always necessitates the borrow-
ing of funds, make sure that your credit report is as accurate and as favorable 
as possible. Your credit score is a key element not only in qualifying for real 
estate loans, but also in getting the best terms to maximize your use of bor-
rowed capital.
Get a copy of your credit report and correct any errors — pronto! At the 
very least, ask the credit bureau to place a letter in your file with your ver-
sion of any disputes. If legitimate delinquent balances appear, formulate 
payment plans and send the credit reporting bureau updates showing the 
balance was paid.
The new real estate investor should also develop additional sources of 
income while holding or preferably even cutting current expenses; even if 
you can find properties where the seller provides all the financing, you can’t 
escape certain out-of-pocket expenses or the opportunity cost of lost income 
as you expend your time and energy tracking down properties and perform-
ing the due diligence. We have yet to find a top-notch real estate inspector or 
escrow company that works for free.
Most people generate wealth and achieve a higher standard of living through 
sacrifice and living below their means in the short-term. For ideas on how to 
track and reduce your expenses, pick up a copy of the latest edition of Eric’s 
Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley).

 Chapter 20: Ten Steps to Real Estate Investing Success
Buy Property in the Path of Progress
Locate properties that are in the path of progress — areas that will continue 
to improve through new investment and economic activity (see Chapter 10). 
You can’t realistically move your property, so your analysis of the location 
and its future potential is critical. After you locate the best cities or neighbor-
hoods, there are commonly two types of underachieving real estate assets to 
look for:
 
✓ Those income properties that are tired and worn and have extensive 
deferred maintenance
 
✓ Those that are physically sound but poorly managed
Your preference will depend on your specific talents and resources. Robert 
favors well-located, physically sound properties that simply have underper-
formed due to poor management. He’s able to use his skills and expertise 
as a property manager to upgrade the properties, bring in new tenants, and 
increase the rents. Particularly attractive properties are those where the cur-
rent owner or manager hasn’t kept rents at the market level.
Buy the Right Property at 
the Best Price Possible
Always buy property for the best possible price. This strategy is simple and 
makes a lot of sense, but may be easier said than done. We suggest following 
certain guidelines. As a general rule, most of your real estate acquisitions 
should be in the fixer-upper category and priced accordingly. You want to 
buy those properties that offer specific challenges that match your personal 
talents so you can use your skills to upgrade and enhance the value of the 
property and increase the Net Operating Income over time.
A real estate investor using the get-rich-right method doesn’t buy a new or 
fully renovated property, unless it’s in the path of progress or a prime loca-
tion, because the value-added or appreciation has already been taken by the 
current owner. These properties may be solid investments, but you’re limited 
to the market increases in rent and value only.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
However, in some special situations, buying a new or fully renovated prop-
erty is a good investment alternative. For example, buying a residential rental 
property in the first phase of an oceanfront community or another unique 
location that’s difficult to replicate may be a great investment in the long 
run. The pricing in first phases of new developments is often very favorable 
because the developer must presell a certain number of the units before his 
permanent loan kicks in.
 
Two important characteristics of successful real estate investors are disci-
pline and the ability to predetermine the maximum price they’ll pay for a 
property to ensure plenty of room for appreciation potential. You don’t want 
to simply lower your purchase price by the cost of the repairs, because the 
value you add to the property should be significantly higher than your out-of-
pocket expenses. See Chapter 12 for advice on property valuation.
Renovate Property the Right Way
The get-rich-right strategy depends on finding properties that are well 
located in the path of progress and then renovating them to increase cash 
flow and value. But don’t overspend on physical improvements. You only 
want to make those renovations or upgrades that increase the desirability of 
the property to your target market. Your property is a rental unit, not your 
own home. You may want to put premium countertops and appliances in 
your home, but you can’t get a good return on your investment if you overim-
prove your rental property.
 
Improvements should allow you to increase the rent or add to the property 
value so that you receive a return of $2 for every $1 spent on the improve-
ments. The best fixer-upper properties for most novice real estate investors 
are those with simple fixes: Painting, landscaping, and minor repairs generally 
offer excellent results for only minor costs. These simple repairs are also 
within the skill set of most real estate investors, who may have developed and 
perfected their talents by maintaining and upgrading their own homes.
Although doing the work yourself is typically cheaper, don’t forget to look at 
the time factor. It makes no sense to have a rental property off the market for 
three weeks while you spend evenings and weekends painting in a misguided 
attempt to save the $1,000 that a contractor would charge for painting that 
would take two days.
 
If you use contractors, get three comparable bids from licensed, competent 
professionals. However, if you already know you have a competitive bid, you 
can expedite the process by asking the contractor whether she can lower the 
price by 10 percent — then you don’t have to go out and get additional bids.

353
 Chapter 20: Ten Steps to Real Estate Investing Success
Whether you do the work yourself or hire a contractor, make sure to obtain 
all required permits and meet the applicable building and occupancy codes 
for all improvements.
Keep Abreast of Market Rents
One of the biggest challenges for most rental property owners is determin-
ing the proper rent to charge tenants for newly renovated rental units. This 
aspect of property ownership and management simply requires some home-
work and research. Every property is unique, but your best indications of 
the market value of your renovated property can be found through a market 
survey of comparable properties.
 
After you’ve acquired and upgraded your new rental property, immediately 
test the new rental rate structure by offering your vacant rental units or space 
at the higher market rates you determined in your rental survey. The response 
you receive from prospects will let you know whether you’re asking too much 
or whether you still have some room to give on your rents. After you install 
new tenants paying the higher rents, you can then make similar improvements 
for existing tenants and increase their rents to similar levels.
We recommend that you keep the rent level slightly below the full market 
rent for existing long-term tenants to show your appreciation for their long-
term tenancy and to encourage them to stay. For more on this topic, check 
out Robert’s Property Management Kit For Dummies, 2nd edition (Wiley).
Recover Renovation Dollars 
through Refinancing
One of the key elements of the get-rich-right strategy is to keep your capital 
working and use leverage reasonably while maintaining sufficient equity to 
weather the ups and downs of real estate cycles and local economic chal-
lenges. Acquiring and renovating your rental property required cash, but you 
also have increased the income, which has created additional value. You can 
now use this increased value to refinance the property to cover your initial 
costs of acquisition and renovation.
Although we’re always quick to advise against borrowing too much and over-
leveraging your real estate investments, you also don’t want to be too con-
servative and underestimate your cash needs. The cost of refinancing is such 

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
that you don’t want to refinance the property more than once, and if you 
suddenly need cash to overcome some unanticipated problems, the costs of 
short-term funds can be high. Borrow extra money or have an untapped line 
of credit available (which some lenders offer at no carrying cost to their best 
customers) to allow for reserves.
 
It can be extremely tempting in a strong real estate market to leverage over-
aggressively, but don’t get carried away. Don’t borrow all of the equity in your 
own personal residence to go out and buy investment real estate. These indi-
viduals are really real estate speculators (people who gamble on real estate) 
and not to be confused with real estate investors.
You should always own your own home and have (and always maintain) a 
good cushion of equity before looking to acquire investment real estate. As 
has been evident in the late-2000s, the lessons of a falling real estate market 
are difficult for all investors but are totally devastating to those few investors 
who borrow too much against their own homes.
Remember that real estate markets have and will continue to have cycles, 
and you don’t want to be too aggressive and find that your real estate empire 
collapses to the point that you yourself can’t even afford to rent one of the 
apartments you used to own!
Reposition Property with Better Tenants
 
One of the best ways to increase the income and value of your newly reno-
vated real estate investment is to reposition the property with new, more 
financially qualified tenants. So look to upgrade your tenants by marketing to 
a new target tenant profile and re-leasing the property.
Often your renovation efforts displace your current tenant anyway, but you 
probably don’t want to renew the current tenants’ leases even if you’re able 
to work around them. The current tenants may be the reason that the previ-
ous owner sold the property (and that it’s in need of a complete renovation)! 
Such tenants aren’t likely to suddenly change their ways and will continue to 
use and abuse the property without any regard for your investment.
 
Robert advises not to renew the lease of (but to provide brand-new carpeting 
in a rental unit occupied by) a tenant with a pet that destroyed the current 
flooring. Likewise, you don’t want to continue the tenancy of a tenant who 
won’t be able to comfortably pay the higher rent that your fully renovated 
property is now worth.

355
 Chapter 20: Ten Steps to Real Estate Investing Success
This is often one of the toughest challenges for rental property owners — 
having to stand up to the current marginal tenant and not renew his lease. 
Although you may occasionally find that the current tenants are financially 
qualified and will treat the property as their own, the harsh reality is that 
most repositioned properties should start with a clean slate of tenants. At a 
minimum, require the current tenants to complete a rental application. Go 
over the lease renewal exactly as you would for a new tenant and use the 
same financial criteria.
 
Another way to improve the stability of your cash flow and minimize the 
chance of problems with your tenants is to increase the security deposit as 
long as you stay within the legal maximum. However, remember that market 
conditions usually restrict the amount you can charge for the security deposit.
Become or Hire a Superior 
Property Manager
Superior management makes the difference between average and excellent 
returns in the long run. After you renovate and reposition a property with 
new tenants at higher rents, you need to retain the tenants and minimize 
turnover. You can also further enhance net operating income by effectively 
and efficiently controlling expenses.
Even if you have just acquired your new rental property, you need to consis-
tently work your long-term investment strategy by operating and managing 
the property effectively to achieve maximum value as if you were going to 
refinance or were preparing the property for sale.
Your target buyer is going to be someone that wants to buy a turnkey property 
(one that’s operating optimally and doesn’t require renovation or a change 
in tenants) for personal use or as a prime rental unit or coupon clipping 
investment (steady, highly predictable stream of income like bond investors 
receive). Real estate appraisers will determine a higher value for properties 
with a strong track record of solid net operating income. Remember that to 
achieve maximum value, you need to have consistent income with rents at 
market rates, stable tenancy, and reasonable expenses. But don’t go for lower 
expenses at the risk of decreasing curb appeal due to deferred maintenance.

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Refinance or Sell and Defer Again
Notwithstanding the decline in property values in most areas in the late-
2000s, many rental property owners find that they have a considerable 
amount of equity tied up in their property because of the appreciation that 
has occurred over the decades throughout much of the country. Having 
some equity in the property is good and keeps you from faltering should the 
local real estate economics take a hit, but too much equity just sitting in a 
property lowers your overall returns.
Our get-rich-right strategy recommends that you use the equity in your cur-
rent properties to expand your real estate holdings by investing in additional 
properties with a view toward diversifying to reduce your overall risk. You 
can access that equity to generate the cash you need in one of two ways: 
Either conservatively refinance your rental property or look to sell the real 
estate investment in a tax-deferred exchange.
The best option depends on market conditions. We suggest that you take 
advantage of favorable financing terms when available to refinance your stabi-
lized long-term properties. You can use the proceeds to restock your capital 
account in order to invest in additional rental real estate or even make other 
investments. The best news of all is that you can pull the cash equity from your 
properties tax-free. Borrowing isn’t dangerous if done in moderation.
Or you can sell the property and use the 1031 tax-deferred exchange to keep 
your equity working. Besides excess or lazy equity, some owners prefer the 
tax-deferred exchange option because they can enhance their use of depre-
ciation to shelter their real estate income. A competent accountant or tax 
advisor can assist you in making the right choice between refinancing and a 
tax-deferred exchange. See Chapter 18 for more on tax-deferred exchanges.
Consolidate Holdings into 
Larger Properties
Fortunately, many real estate investors are able to master the concepts of 
buying and renovating rental real estate. However, they often become so 
successful that their real estate empire begins to control their lives.

357
 Chapter 20: Ten Steps to Real Estate Investing Success
Although owning a diversified portfolio of rental properties has some inher-
ent advantages, the day will come when your extensive real estate holdings 
create management burdens. Most long-term real estate investors find that 
they reach the point where their management responsibilities and duties no 
longer conform to the lifestyle that they can afford. They often decide to sim-
plify their lives and hire professional property managers so that a property 
manager can deal with tenants, turnover, toilets, and trash.
 
But finding and paying for a qualified property manager for a diversified port-
folio of small rental properties isn’t easy or cost-effective. Instead, look to the 
tax-deferred exchange and consolidate your real estate holdings into one or a 
handful of larger properties that can be professionally managed. You will still 
enjoy the benefits of real estate ownership without having to deal with the 
day-to-day challenges of management.

building long-term wealth 
through real estate 
Want to be a successful real estate investor? Eric Tyson and 
Robert Griswold present their proven strategies, along with 
updated tips for easily riding out downturns in the real 
estate market. From homes and apartment buildings to 
duplexes, commercial properties, and real estate investment 
trusts (REITs), you’ll master every aspect of investing in and 
financing properties, and see how to increase their value.
•  Build a foundation for investing success — get your finances in 
order, weigh your investment options, understand the risks, and 
work with real estate pros
•  You have to pay to play — raise capital, finance your purchases, 
and secure the best mortgage terms
•  Find and evaluate properties — choose the best locations, 
understand leases, project a property’s cash flow, and decide 
how much to pay
•  Master the negotiation process — assemble attractive offers, 
complete the purchase agreement, conduct formal due 
diligence, and close the sale
•  Manage your property — be a top-notch landlord (or hire help), 
get the insurance you need, know the tax angles, and decide 
when and how to sell
