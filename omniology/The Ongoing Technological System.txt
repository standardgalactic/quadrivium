Introduction 
A major technological transformation is disrupting the world more than 
ever. How can this pressing movement be understood? Through the analysis 
of the organization of the technological space of society in a given period, 
which is characterized as a technological system and which designates a 
conceptual framework that not only allows for the understanding of the 
technological organization but also of the nature and forms of the innovation 
flow that it generates. 
How then does the contemporary technological system relate to 
contemporary innovation dynamics? Two major historical phases help 
establish this relationship. The first phase corresponds to a considerable 
technological change noticeable around 1975, accompanied by an economic 
and energy crisis which has been generally designated as the “third industrial 
revolution”. The second movement is a very powerful current of innovation 
that has existed since the mid-1990s, commonly known as the “digital 
revolution”, sometimes combined with the notion of environmental 
transition which now appears to be a major factor for technological 
recomposition. 
The period of emergence of this system, characterized as the third 
technological revolution, inaugurated a new technological system which is 
also called the third technological system. It is characterized by the 
dominance of new generic technologies, such as information technology 
whose nature had changed with the development of the microprocessor in 
1975 and with the emergence of new transformation principles of 
biotechnologies, based on a whole series of discoveries in the field of 
genetics. The third field of generic technologies is in the field of materials, 
with the development of composite problems. Finally, in the face of the 

x     The Ongoing Technological System 
energy crisis, the diversification of energy technologies and the emergence 
of renewable energies reshape this generic technology, that is, energy. 
Since then, this technological system has continued to deploy itself, 
undergoing a large number of mutations at the turn of the century, more 
precisely new combinations within information technologies, because of the 
double movement generated by digitalization and generalized connection. 
This era of “convergence” has provided new products such as the smart 
phone, networks and in particular the Internet, driven by progress in 
knowledge of genetics and new materials. How can we apprehend and 
understand the powerful current of innovation of the past 20 years, which 
resulted thereof, if not in terms of a global evolution of the technological 
system which we were confronted with? It is therefore by facing the 
challenge of the intensity of the technological mutation in particular, which 
we are observing at the moment, that we begin the task of presenting and 
analyzing this contemporary technological system. 
In order to achieve this task, we will outline its conceptual framework, 
which is the approach of technological systems [GIL 78], and which we have 
contributed to formalize [AÏT 89, AÏT 02, AÏT 14, AÏT 15] and whose 
principles of construction and analysis in addition to the explanatory 
efficiency for the current period are presented in the first chapter. 
The current technological system is the culmination of a historical 
evolution, marked by ruptures, technological revolutions and by a historical 
succession of these systems. This historical perspective, from the middle 
ages, includes the great pre-industrial technological system followed by the 
first industrial technological system, known as the English Industrial 
Revolution at the end of the 18th Century. It will constitute the second 
chapter. 
It is important to present this second industrial technological system, 
because it is therefrom that the contemporary technological system has 
emerged through a technological crisis, which has enabled its deployment. 
We will present this original framework and its rupture in the third chapter. 
Once this third system is structured by new generic technologies, two 
organizational processes of the new system in use will be identified, the 
deployment of the new technological applications and the restructuring of 
traditional technologies of the old system. This double movement has often 
been characterized as the “microelectronic revolution”, because of its major 
transformation operator, the “chip”. This background technological 

Introduction     xi 
movement will produce transformative interactions with productive and 
corporate structures and even forms of knowledge production. The fourth 
chapter will be dedicated to describing and analyzing this initial phase of the 
third technological system. 
The second wave of innovation, which is a genuine qualitative leap of 
technological development, will be the subject of the fifth chapter which will 
aim to highlight its components, performance jumps in generic technology, 
the generation of new processes, systems and new products creating new 
functions. 
This powerful innovation movement has significant effects on the 
economic and social organization and its dynamics. The challenges in these 
different areas, as well as organizational reforms and emerging social forms, 
will be analyzed in the sixth and final chapter. 
In order to understand and forecast, it is important to answer the ultimate 
question that this analysis raises, that of the nature of the last technological 
transformation. Is the latter only a new development, be it exceptionally 
powerful and transformative, within the continuity of the third technological 
system? Or are we in the presence of a new technological revolution, which 
would lead society into a new technological system [SCH 17]? These are 
questions that we will deal with in the conclusion.

How Can a Technological System be 
Understood and Analyzed? 
1.1. Introduction 
Understanding the contemporary technological system does not simply 
involve a factual description of technologies, technical objects, products and 
services, but an understanding of this aggregate as an organized system. The 
technological approach as a system is built on the principle that the 
technological universe, this portion of human activity consisting of the 
appropriation of the laws of nature to transform nature and society, can be 
analyzed as an aggregate of specific laws of composition and evolution, 
forming an order and an organization, and further generating momentum and 
dynamics. This form has existed in the entire history of human technology, 
which allows it to be exposed as a succession of technological 
macrosystems, having their specific characteristics and specific evolutionary 
laws for a given historical period. The purpose of this chapter is to show 
what the foundations and the characteristics of an in system approach are and 
how it has made it possible to explain, in an orderly manner, the succession 
of historic technological systems up to the contemporary system. We will 
then focus the presentation on the technological dynamic and on the 
instruments used for the analysis of the movement of the technological 
system, i.e. the innovation momentum.

2     The Ongoing Technological System 
The concept of a technological system thus appears as an operative 
concept, which is useful for interpreting the contemporary technological 
movement in its entirety. Such an approach will provide us with the tools to 
understand the structure of our technological universe and the technological 
evolution that we are currently experiencing. 
1.2. The construction of technology analysis models in systems 
Physical “objects” and activities in which technology specifically 
crystallizes, namely material objects such as tools, machinery, diverse 
consumer objects and intangible objects such as expertise and technical 
language are not elements isolated from one another. They form an order, 
within the different meanings of this word; they are inter-related and united, 
“forming a system”. This system, even though it maintains strong 
relationships with other spheres of social system, possesses autonomy, by 
means of the specificity of its composition and evolutionary laws [GIL 78]. 
Technology generates, due to this autonomy, dynamics of motion and 
change, the main component of technological innovation is driven by the 
permanent recomposition of technical and technological systems. 
1.2.1. The ontological approach of the technological system, a 
vision of structure 
The theory of technological systems is based on the idea that technology, 
at any level whatsoever, is organized into structured aggregates whose 
elements are interconnected and interactive. The founding proposal is thus 
expressed by Bertrand Gille: “It amounts to also state that, ultimately as a 
very general rule, all techniques are, to varying degrees, dependent on each 
other and that a certain consistency is necessarily needed between them … 
This aggregate of consistencies at the different levels of all structures, of all 
aggregates, and all constituent parts comprises what can be called a technical 
system” [GIL 78, p. 19]. 
The technological system is always an ordered aggregation of 
interconnected and interdependent technologies, a multilevel hierarchical 
system. Unitary technologies are aggregated into technical sets of increasing 
complexity that have their functional unity and architectural order. The 
technological system can thus be seen as a system of systems. 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     3 
It can nevertheless be observed that this system-wide organization 
includes two types of elements and relationships: a system of technical 
systems and a hierarchized organization of technological understanding, 
knowledge and applications. 
1.2.1.1. The technological system as an organized aggregate of 
technical systems 
A technological system can be represented as an organization of 
subsystems as the real operating and even physical systems, which we can 
call technical systems, have an organic structure with strong interactions 
based on real flows of matter, energy and information. 
1.2.1.1.1. The structuring unit: the unitary technical principle 
B. Gille, who undertook this technological separation, states that the most 
basic technical unit, the technical process, physically implemented in the 
tool, is already a combination of physical actions, at least, the mandatory 
energy–matter pair or rather the matter–energy–information triple. 
1.2.1.1.2. The organization of technical aggregates of increasing 
complexity 
These technical units will be integrated into technical combinations 
which have increasing levels of complexity, which Gille calls technical 
structures, technical aggregates and technical sectors. 
Technical devices (which Gille [GIL 78] calls “technical aggregate”) are 
technical systems, which are combinations of several technical processes, 
implemented by humans and organized by specific knowledge and 
information systems to carry out a complex transformation operation of 
matter or a complex functionality. The example of production blast furnace 
smelting, although seemingly elementary, shows the level of complexity 
attained. This is a case where a technical device is located in the production, 
hence a factory, for example, is a technical device such as a sector. 
The level of aggregation and complexity is thus variable; it is not the 
point here to more precisely distinguish between the different possible levels 
of a technical device. 

4     The Ongoing Technological System 
Figure 1.1. An example of a technical aggregate:  
the blast furnace B. Gille [GIL 79] 
These technical aggregates can reach the size and complexity level of 
technical networking macrosystems and constitute technological aggregates 
which are often heterogeneous in terms of the skills implemented and often 
based on informational networks. We will thus refer to the latter as technical 
systems. Electrical systems studied by Hughes [HUG 83], transport systems, 
in particular rail systems, and especially nowadays the world wide web are 
illustrations of them. They represent specific objects of study because of 
their relative functional unity, despite their technical heterogeneity and their 
very large interdependence, thus turning them into concrete coherence 
vectors of the technological system as a whole. 
All these systems have a specific organization, an architecture (they 
always have an organization within the sense of systems). All these systems 
are finalized in the sense that they perform functions. They can be 
represented as systems of functions. 
1.2.1.2. The macro technological system, the supreme instance of 
technological organization 
The superior form of system, which Gille calls “technical system” and 
which we prefer to designate technological system to differentiate it from 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     5 
concrete technical systems, represents an abstract hierarchical organization 
of all systems comprising it, a system of a more general level and order, a 
meta-system with more abstract links and interactions. Technological 
macrosystems such as global, national and branch technological systems, or 
even that of a technological field, come under this category. 
Nonetheless, moving to this level introduces a rupture which consists of 
the idea that all the previous levels organize real and concrete technical 
systems, whereas the technological macrosystem is an assembly of more 
abstract relationships between technological levels. The purpose of the 
technological macrosystem is to formalize the entire structure of 
technologies and their relationships at the level of a given society and to 
build historical periodizations [GRA 97]. 
1.2.1.2.1. An informational and cognitive hierarchical organization 
Not all technologies have the same significance with respect to the 
influence that they exert on the aggregate system. This makes it possible to 
bring forward the idea of a hierarchy between technological levels in the 
system, according to their impact on the coherence of the whole. 
Today, it is established that this hierarchy ought to be addressed in the 
form of a conceptual distinction between three major types of technologies: 
generic technologies, application technologies and products, and end usage 
technologies. 
Generic technologies are the technologies that implement a great 
transformation mode of matter. They are materialized in the form of 
scientific concepts and principles or those related to science. Their unity is 
based on the main process implemented, the material transformed or the 
general function taken into account, they are not specific to a particular 
product–market line. Generic technologies can be classified as, for example: 
electronic information processing technology, hydrocarbon chemistry and 
fermentation engineering. They assume a concrete existence by means of 
large sets of technical processes unified under a single concept (this 
categorization has a closeness with the notion of technological paradigm 
[DOS 82]). 
 

6     The Ongoing Technological System 
As a result, generic technologies have, due to their higher degree of 
generality, a wider network of interrelations and therefore a more massive 
influence over the aggregate system.

Application technologies: these generic technologies radiate and are 
broken down into groups of particular technological applications, in the form 
of processes and transformation mechanisms that will combine into 
industrial applications of technical systems and products, to the point of fine 
adaptation to a product–market couple. This then corresponds to the third 
type of technology which is located a long way downstream from the system 
and is responsible for solving more focused application problems. 
1.2.1.2.3. Technical system – technological macrosystem: a 
conceptual continuum 
Despite the difference in perspective of the analysis expressed above, all 
of the division or aggregation levels that we have described are governed by 
a principle of continuity. Fundamental invariants of composition and motion 
of artifacts (interdependence, coherence, self-saturated growth, etc.) are the 
same, regardless of the level of scale and aggregation. It is certainly 
necessary to produce the composition laws specific to each scaling level but 
in the context of the general invariants of this type of system. 
Here, we come across one of the foundations of technological systems, 
that of the additivity of systems or their fractal composition. 
1.2.2. Interdependence and technological coherence: the 
systemic principle of dynamics of technological systems 
Furthermore, the network of interdependencies that merges and operates 
technical 
and 
technological 
systems 
generates 
a 
plurality 
of 
interdependencies [GIL 78, ROS 82]. 
1.2.2.1. Quantitative and qualitative interdependencies 
Interdependency can be broken down; it is both quantitative and 
qualitative and may represent a combination of the following two links: 
– Link between qualities: “the work of a given material requires tools of a 
given quality”. For instance, underwater work in deep waters, in order to 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     7 
achieve the necessary communication between the surface and the divers, 
requires control of the respiratory physiology and gas mixtures in addition to 
the application of a signal processing technique capable of correcting the 
acoustic distortions introduced by great depths. 
– Link between quantities: it relates to the connections between physical 
characteristics, yields and sizes in particular, to illustrate an old but well-
known example, the power of steam engines depends on the pressure level of 
boilers, which itself depends on the resistance of the materials that they are 
made of. 
However, there is also interaction between quantity and quality, the 
production of given quantities requires a specific quality of the instruments 
destined to implement it. There are many examples of this type of cohesion 
throughout the 18th and part of the 19th Century, for example the dialectic 
between machine powers and the nature of metals needed to transmit 
increasingly more powerful motions. 
1.2.2.2. Intra-technology and inter- technology interdependency 
Interdependency also takes place, in a kind of a dynamic system based on 
Forrester’s work [FOR 61], by means of feedback loops of various orders 
inside a technological field itself, this is intra-technology interdependency, 
between the different stages or different components of an aggregate or a 
branch. Let us consider the example of the evolution of electronic 
components where technical advances depend on the fine understanding of 
their architecture, itself depending on computational and computer-aided 
design, which itself depends on the power of its components. 
This interdependence takes place between the technical fields that 
converge to form technical aggregates, for example, between materials and 
energy, we will call it inter-technology interdependence. This technological 
interdependence may concern techniques dedicated to a given system, 
between container and content for example, between power generator and 
transmission organ. 
This is however not always the case. Through the interaction of cross-
cutting technologies, the interdependency of qualities and quantities takes 
place between apparently independent techniques, which may not have 
specific relationships between them. These cross-cutting or horizontal 
techniques are those that are present in most technical systems without being 
specific to any one of them: the gear and the piston, for example, power 
supply systems and, today, electronic components and software programs. 

8     The Ongoing Technological System 
Generalized to the whole system and interfaced with most of the other 
techniques, they contribute to disseminating a unifying system standard. 
Energy systems are particularly important in this regard to the extent that 
attempts at periodization of the technological systems have often been based 
on the name of the dominant energy in a given system (Mumford’s 
classification [MUM 65]). These coherences are not only linear but also 
comprise feedback and cross-cutting actions. 
A technological system tends to form a cohesive whole. 
It is important to distinguish between interdependence and coherence. 
Interdependence is what we might call the interaction and solidarity 
processor between techniques. The set of all of these interdependencies tends 
to generate a set of local coherences which tend toward a general coherence 
of the system. Coherence is the required common level of characteristics 
and performances of all the techniques for harmonious operation and 
development of the technological system. 
This implies that the level of maturity of a technological system can be 
defined by the extent of the space governed by this coherence. A mature 
technological system is a system in which all of the characteristics and levels 
of performance of the various techniques are coherent, with the exception of 
a few technical “isolates”. “These links can be established only if a level 
common to all of the techniques can be achieved, even if, marginally, the 
level of some techniques, more independent with regard to others, is 
maintained below or above the general level” [GIL 78, p. 19]. 
Coherence is thus a product of the interaction of interdependencies which 
tends to achieve harmonization between technical performance levels and 
qualitative characteristics. It is therefore also a condition since 
interdependencies can be established only with the condition that there exists 
a minimum compatibility of the convergent elements. This also explains that 
different technological systems, historically dated, could have been defined 
by a set of consistent performances such as: accuracy of the material 
transformation (millimeter, micron, etc.), precision of the measurement of 
time required for the speed of transformation (from the hour in Roman times 
to the nanosecond today) and adaptive variety of materials. 
The interplay of interdependencies in the search for this consistency 
generates a motion because the trend will be to fine-tune technologies with 
each other to the greatest possible extent, as shown in the very elaborated 
text by Tinland who defined technology as a “complex and coherent 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     9 
aggregate of objects, skills, representations”. He states, “Whether therefore 
referring to a technical-type evolution through the successive forms of the 
same ‘lineage’ of tools or relationships that unite material objects, revenues, 
production or usage standards, awareness of requirements, etc., the technical 
sphere contributes in every way with evolutionary pressures and internal 
regulations that confer it with a wide autonomy” [TIN 90, p. 106]. 
A technology progressing more rapidly at a point, or another being 
instead blocked, is sufficient to bring about a motion of “seismic” 
readjustment. Hughes has formalized this phenomenon with the notion of 
reverse salient [HUG 87], as has Sahal in his analysis of the differential 
growth of technical components of a technical or technological system [SAH 
81], which can gradually affect the entire system. The location where such a 
rupture occurs is not indifferent, and if such a movement applies to generic 
technologies, this rupture can cause a major technological crisis: the rupture 
of a technological system rupture that some call a “Technological 
revolution”. 
1.3. The representation of the movement: the technological 
lifecycle, the discontinuity of the technical movement 
1.3.1. The technological lifecycle 
The technological lifecycle is based on the idea that every technology has 
a limited development space. A new technology often arises from the 
inability of a previous technology to satisfy an increasing function, it grows 
with an increase in performance over time, until it meets a limit where: 
“…no growth is possible: dimensions, performance, costs, each necessarily 
related to others imposes a limit that it is unthinkable to cross” [GIL 78,  
p. 33]. It is this notion of technological limit that accounts for disruptive 
innovations, which we refer to further on as substitutions, and technological 
crises at different levels of the system. The technological lifecycle will make 
it possible to describe organization and form invariants of technical systems, 
according to their degree of maturity. In general, four phases of the lifecycle 
can be distinguished: emergence, growth, maturity and limits [FOS 86]. The 
limit of a technology resides in the exhaustion of the potential of progress 
that is reflected by the principle of matter transformation which mainly 
animates it. It can be met due to external limitations, such as a shortage of 
raw materials [ROS 76]. 

10     The Ongoing Technological System 
This limit is a system limit of the self-saturation type, the limit of a 
technical principle will cause interaction by the complete saturation of the 
system. 
1.3.2. The formalisms of the lifecycle: the S-curve 
1.3.2.1. Technological momentum and S-curve 
Empirical studies have shown that when the time series of the 
performance of a technical system is graphically represented, a sigmoidal 
curve is obtained, which corresponds to the logistic curve known as the  
S-curve [GIL 78, SAH 81]. This is the regular shape of the rhythm of 
occupation by a technique that we call technological expansion space. This 
curve is a formalization of a self-saturation process [BER 73]. 
The problem then lies in its effective construction, which presupposes the 
refinement of the evolutionary model of the technical system under 
consideration, its determinants and also the forms of insertion of this 
technical system in the global technological movement. 
 
Figure 1.2. The evolution of the performance  
of a technology over time [AÏT 02] 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     11 
1.3.2.2. Technological substitution modeling 
The saturated technical system will see the emergence of a set of 
concurring techniques likely to exceed the boundary that it cannot overcome. 
Several technical principles are generally candidates for this substitution. 
Often a single technique reaches the substitution, sometimes several. These 
will be involved in the technical proliferation of the following emerging 
phase. 
The curve below shows how this saturation process generally creates a 
process of technological substitution. 
 
Figure 1.3. Technological substitution after  
saturation of a technical system [AÏT 02] 
1.3.3. The conditional stability of the S-curve: interaction 
between the individual lifecycle and the global technology 
movement 
Because of its regularity observable in most techniques, these successions 
of phases have been called the “technological lifecycle”; this designates the 
lifecycle of an isolated technical system. In order to account for its dynamics  
 
 
 

12     The Ongoing Technological System 
of evolution, it must be inserted into the dynamics of the technological 
macrosystem in which it is found, along with the potentialities and 
constraints that this environment generates [AÏT 02]. 
When it reaches its boundaries, it is possible that a technology may see 
these limits be shifted and experience a new lease of life because 
technological breakthroughs in other areas of the technological macrosystem 
will have changed some of its central conditions for evolution. The 
consequence is that the S-curve is stable only in a stable technological 
environment. Conversely, in a technological system in transition, all unit S-
curves are likely to be modified. The validity limit of the S-curve results 
from the reasoning “all things being equal”, that is to say that this 
technological path will be all the more stable as the global technological 
environment is stable. 
This resorting to “doping” the S-curve cannot be performed in the top 
level of a technological macrosystem, because generic technologies at their 
limits cannot undergo technical doping. Technological system theory thus 
provides us with a basis for understanding crisis as a technological 
revolution. This relates to a blockage of a number of generic technologies, 
which has generated a crisis in the whole technological system, which had in 
turn fed one hundred years of development and contributed to the 
development of a new technology system based on a set of other generic 
technologies, so-called “new technologies”. 
1.4. Model for the internal restructuring of technology systems 
by means of the three components: technique–architecture–
function 
1.4.1. A formalization of the technical system components: the 
technique–architecture–function articulation 
The technical system (or the macro technological system) is analyzed as a 
reality that can be read from three articulated levels: 
– The technical system as an ordered and inter-connected function space. 
This is a form of reading the interaction and coherence that we mentioned 
previously. This form of representation expresses the logical network of 
requirements exclusively in terms of what all the technical system levels and 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     13 
operators do. This approach provides a theoretical status to functional 
analysis and a fairly considerable universalization of its field. 
– The system technology as a coherent space of technical processes. 
 
Figure 1.4. Graphical representation of the process– 
function–architecture interaction model [ABE 88] 
This is the most technical reading of the technical system, the analysis of 
the way in which to perform functions. The functions of a given system can 
be realized only because it controls certain types of means of control of 
nature. These processes may be different to control the same function, 
especially when they must do so in different conditions and contexts. 
– The technical system as an architecture of architectures. 
The execution of these functions by given processes is not carried out in a 
direct way due to the combined nature of the processes for the realization of 
a function. In all the cases, it involves specific and stable process 
combinatorials that are commonly referred to as technical architectures. 
According to their level of complexity, these architectures are organized into 
architectures of architectures. 
 

14     The Ongoing Technological System 
The technical architecture is a strictly technological dimension which is 
often forgotten in favor of the process; perhaps it is the most technological, 
because it constitutes the central link of the technological order. 
This system construction structure is also a factor of movement since the 
technological movement will take place on the articulation and the 
harmonization of the three levels, as has been analyzed by G. Simondon in 
his process of “realization of the technical object” [SIM 59]. 
1.4.2. The dynamics of interaction by the function–architecture–
principle relation 
1.4.2.1. From the stimulation of the function to the readjustment of the 
functional architecture 
The interaction between the performance growth, made possible by the 
field of technological potentials, and the growth of social expectations have 
contributed to increasing the main function of a technical system in terms of 
scale, diversity and precision. The laser, for instance, was originally 
developed as a measuring tool and has gradually extended its functional 
space (cutting, dental care, welding, etc.). 
This change, which induces a positive imbalance, is reflected within the 
technical system, by forcing a large part of the intermediate functions to 
evolve in turn. 
However, as has been analyzed by Simondon, this evolution of the 
functions of the technical system does not happen in a homothetic way, it 
comprises a phenomenon of rearrangement of the functional architecture by 
means of decomposing secondary functions, to better adapt itself to the 
principal function. 
1.4.2.2. 
Recomposition 
of 
the 
functional 
architecture 
and 
recomposition of the technological architecture 
Designers of technical systems are then faced with a double requirement, 
on the one, to respond to the need for increased levels of functional 
performance, and on the other, to adapt the technological architecture to the 
functional 
restructuring 
that 
accompanies 
it. 
Due 
to 
proximity,  
and with coherence in mind, this forces all technical components to  
 
 

How Can a Technological System be Understood and Analyzed?     15 
evolve. Thus, the emergence of the airplane technical system, and even more 
generally of artificial flight, if it has generated new usage functionality, has 
in the course of the growth of this function created new technical functions 
such as the necessary measurement of altitude, then the function of 
automatic piloting as well as the function for flight without visibility. 
This modification will stabilize if existing techniques are able to respond 
to these changes. If they reach boundaries which do not allow them to 
respond to increases in demand or to integrate into the new architecture, this 
induces a blockage of the system’s evolution. This then creates a situation in 
which new technical principles appear and which, because of their potential 
surplus or new requirement for compatibility, will restart the process of 
motion (which may well not happen, causing “isolates” of technology locked 
inside a technological macrosystem in evolution). 
As a result, this general growth, brought about by the functional system, 
not only causes the technical system performance to increase but also its 
complexity and diversity. 
This crossing between the logic of growth of technical systems in their 
expansion space and the logic of functional–architectural–technical restructuring 
represents the main foundations where the understanding and modeling of 
technological dynamics can be built upon. 
1.4.3. 
Technological 
systems, 
waves 
of 
innovation 
and 
technological revolutions 
The diffusion of progress in certain technologies in the system, such as 
the limits of some of them being exceeded, generates a permanent 
innovation momentum. Depending on the importance of the generic 
technologies involved in the process, this innovation movement will lead to 
more or less intense waves of innovation of greater or lesser magnitude. 
We shall thus see, concerning the contemporary technological system, 
that it has been carried by two successive waves of innovation. The first was 
brought about by the “microelectronic revolution” and the second by a 
current of technological convergence initiated by a generalized digital 
movement. 
 

16     The Ongoing Technological System 
The large-scale transformation, the so-called technological revolution, of 
which several instances were known to appear around 1780, 1875 and 1975, 
is the replacement of a technological system by another and the replacement 
of previous generic technologies, having reached their limits, with new 
generic technologies, structuring and carrying this new system. 
1.4.4. Dynamics of the technological system and social system 
The technological dynamics generated by the structure and dynamics of a 
technological system requires the development of the specific productive, 
economic and social organization that surrounds it. The technological 
evolution creates organizational needs to manage and regulate the scale 
effects induced by innovations. Such is the case of the industrial 
organization of “big industry”, shaped by the technological capabilities 
required to provide the mass production emerging in the 2nd industrial 
technological system. This organizational harmonization can relate to the 
need for institutions that will be responsible for the new activities generated 
by the technological evolution. Let us quote, for example, training 
institutions generated by the need for skills in the implementation of 
technology that has become more scientific, particularly with the 
developments of electricity, chemistry and mechanics. This institutional 
development manifested itself through the creation of engineering schools, 
and also through the generalization of primary education in all of the 
industrialized world by the end of the 19th Century; the objective of this 
institutional creation was to provide basic knowledge and also the types of 
behavior expected from the workers of the new industrial forms. A similar 
development can be mentioned in the evolution of research with its 
systematization and institutionalization in business, with the creation of the 
new concept of research center by the end of the 19th Century. In other 
cases, it is the development of a new technology that will allow for the 
emergence and the development of a new form of organization made 
necessary by the complexity or the scale that the developing technological 
system generates. The clearest example of this interaction is that of the 
generalization of electricity supply in factories, around the 1920s, which 
created the condition (the freedom of positioning machines inside the 
industrial space) for the creation of methods for the so-called “scientific 
organization of work”. We will come across these transformations or 
organizational innovations, generated in the contemporary technological 
system, later in the book.

The Historical Dynamics  
of Technological Systems: Putting  
the Contemporary Technological  
System into Historical Perspective 
In order to put the contemporary technological system into historical 
perspective, it is important to present the dynamics of historical 
technological systems as early as the pre-industrial period, with the first 
significant force driving technological change appearing in the Middle Ages 
[GIM 75]. This in turn initiated the development of a large technological 
system that would endure until the end of the 18th Century. At this point, 
being a system that had reached its “limits”, it gave rise to a new 
technological system that is referred to as the first industrial revolution. 
2.1. The great pre-industrial technological system 
From the 12th to until the end of the 18th Century, the first pre-industrial 
technological system was put in place, bringing increasing complexity and 
innovation. Its constant characteristic was to base innovation trends on a 
process of increased scales, complexified relationships and repositioning 
traditional technical foundations that remained unchanged: water and wind 
as energy sources, wood, stone and hemp as materials, etc. This system thus 
underwent three development and innovation waves that we will discuss in 
the following sections.

20     The Ongoing Technological System 
2.1.1. The industrial revolution of the 12th Century. The medieval 
wave of a permanent innovation movement 
The technical momentum that took place in the 12th Century was 
transformed into three main areas. First, it transformed agriculture and to 
paraphrase Gimpel accordingly [GIM 75], the medieval technological 
revolution was from the outset of an agricultural revolution. In turn, this 
revolution initiated a momentum in mechanics centered around the most 
important machine, which, at that time, was the hydraulic mill. This current 
innovation is also marked by a significant leap in the architectural field 
which was reflected in the drive to build cathedrals as well as networks of 
fortresses and the fortification of new towns. 
These three movements and their interaction constituted the first complex 
technological system of which we present the general picture below: 
 
Figure 2.1. General table of the medieval  
technological system, 12th–14th Century [AÏT 02] 

The Historical Dynamics of Technological Systems     21 
2.1.1.1. Agriculture 
The first big innovation thrust concerned agriculture, which underwent a 
large number of convergent innovations regarding plowing, animal traction, 
and the selection of species and crop rotation [CON 83]. A driving, if not 
triggering, factor was the actual ending of slavery [BON 91], the relaxation 
of the feudal bond, the role of the Church and the increase in trade. 
The first and probably the most direct transformation of the technical 
changes in agriculture was the generalization and the improvement of the 
moldboard plow, replacing the traditional araire. 
The use of the plough was conditioned and enabled by a considerable 
increase in traction power [HAU 87], which was made possible by using 
horses: as powerful as oxes, but one and a half times faster and more 
enduring. This substitution was made possible by the generalization of a new 
form of hitch, organized around the horse collar, which considerably 
increased the individual pulling power of the horse, previously strangled by 
the old system based on neck traction. At the same time, the possibility of 
inline hitching, that this device allowed, increased the overall power thereof. 
This was by all means a whole new technical system that revolutionized the 
usage of the horse with the parallel adoption of the horseshoe, making the 
horse independent of field conditions and the saddle and stirrups as well as 
the selection of new breeds of horses suitable for labor [WHI 69]. 
The third wave of innovations deeply impacted farming methods with the 
three-year crop rotation, which had gradually replaced the traditional 
biennial system from the 11th Century [GIM 75]. Operating as a positive 
feedback loop [FOR 61], the three-year crop rotation also promoted the 
production of oat necessary to feed horses: this was the energy supply 
necessary for the production tool (the plow-hitch system) which was at the 
root of the increase in the performance of the agricultural system. 
2.1.1.2. A first Golden Age of machinery and mechanical innovation 
This period was also probably the first “mechanical” age, with the 
development of energy technologies, making use of water and also wind 
power [WHI 69]. “The large-scale use of hydraulic energy represented 
without any doubt the great medieval innovation,” B. Gille emphasized. 
Water mills utilized the most effective design, namely with a vertical wheel 
and supply from the top [DAU 62]. This motion generation system would be 
combined with various transmission systems: gearing, to multiply the 
movement or transform a horizontal movement into a vertical movement, 

22     The Ongoing Technological System 
and camshafts, to transform a continuous circular motion into an alternating 
movement. 
This resulted in a very large functional diversification of types of mills, 
within the agricultural field: grain and oil mills, known since antiquity, and 
then beer mills, mustard mills and bark mills, grindstones, windmills and 
watermills or wind pumps. Since mills were now using the “cam”, the main 
mechanical innovation of the period, “industrial” transformation mills were 
appearing, namely iron and copper mills, tread mills, paper mills, and 
especially sawmills [CON 83]. 
The “mill revolution” had already represented a huge contribution of 
mechanical power in other technical fields, such as that of wood, textiles and 
metal transformation. The mill became, because of its central position, a 
privileged place for accumulating technical experience and innovation 
research, in the areas of hydraulics, energy transformation, movement 
transmission and transformation functions that it implemented (metallurgical 
blow molding, textile fulling, etc.). 
A new technology for the measurement of time had started with the 
mechanical clock, one of the areas where progress would be the most fertile 
for centuries to come, with the first mechanical clock by Giovanni de Dondi 
in 1364. Mechanical watchmaking marked a break with the previous 
technique of time measurement: the clepsydra (water clock). This break 
came from the specific functional requirements of its implementation in 
Northern Europe, where it was subjected to frost which prevented the use of 
this device. 
The innovative dimension of watchmaking technology resided in the 
development of metal mechanical parts, – iron and copper – which 
represented, during the three following centuries, a very strong potential for 
increased levels of precision, finesse and mechanical miniaturization. This 
further culminated in being considered the true matrix of what would 
become precision mechanics [LAN 87]. 
2.1.1.3. Architecture 
Two major construction trends were developed during this period. The 
construction of cathedrals, which reflected a great impulse of Gothic 
construction from the 12th Century, had resulted in the constitution of the 
first major modern projects and an initial synthesis of the technological 
system during the formation process. The construction of castles and 

The Historical Dynamics of Technological Systems     23 
fortifications in cities constituted another major area of technical 
concentration. These achievements themselves were representative of a new 
technological era, first in terms of size and also in the integration of 
mechanical devices corresponding to the level consequently attained: 
involving gates, chicanes, portcullis and drawbridges. The high technical level 
attained by these accomplishments was perceptible at the level of working 
sites themselves, which were designed and directed by high-level designers 
and architects who gathered significant groups of men, comprising almost 
50% of what we would today call a qualified or highly qualified workforce. 
2.1.1.4. Feedback loops in establishing and strengthening the 
medieval technical system [GIM 75] 
First, the quantitative development of mills allowed for their steady 
improvement, driven by an increase in energy potential and a diversification 
of usages, especially for metallurgical purposes. As iron tooling became 
more available, wood became more easily exploitable; however, wood was 
no longer needed for metal fusion. Since there were more efficient 
windmills, wood could be processed in sawmills in larger quantities, and 
satisfy, among other things, construction, transportation, carts and boats 
needs. As more wood was necessary, it became possible to extract more of it 
resulting in more reduced forests and thus increasing the cultivable surface 
and causing a strong growth in the need for tooling.

24     The Ongoing Technological System 
2.1.2. The rebound in the “Renaissance” – is there a 
technological and innovative specificity of the Renaissance? 
Can we identify in the technological field, a notion of Renaissance 
comparable to what this period represented in the areas of thought and art? 
Did the period from the middle of the 15th Century (what the Italians call the 
Quattrocento) until the very end of the 16th Century represent a period  
of significant technological change in the continuity of a technological  
system? 
The answer is nuanced. Whereas it can be said that at the technological 
level, the true Renaissance, of Europe at least, was located during the 
medieval period, the historical period known as the Renaissance represented 
a significant change, a change of “regime” as it would be referred to today, 
but in the context of a technological system with a constant framework. This 
period was a phase of economic recovery for Europe, after the terrible crisis 
in the 14th Century. It was also a period of demographic regrowth which 
would be sustained until the 18th Century [BRA 79]. Technological 
development occurred in a situation of workforce shortage, technological 
innovation here continued its activity of substitution of living work by 
machines. 
The constitution of states had a significant impact on the scale of 
technological development by means of the constitution of larger spaces of 
organization, decision and funding which were incommensurate with the 
feudal space. The role of these factors turned to be structuring at the 
technological level and would become manifest in the following three areas 
of special emphasis: 
War was raging during this whole period, on a large scale and with whole 
new technical imperatives. This pervasiveness of warfare would orientate 
technological development towards the developments of fire artillery 
symmetrically with the issue of fortifications. 
2.1.2.1. Planning 
The new power and the dominant role of states led to the important 
development of a building activity, related to symbolic considerations of 
power, control space, and the stimulation of economic activity or 
development: princely architecture, urbanism [BRA 79], transport networks, 
and especially hydraulic development programs: canals, ports and 
dewatering works. 

The Historical Dynamics of Technological Systems     25 
2.1.2.2. Remote exploration and expansion of the known world 
During this period, remote exploration created requirements for 
exploitation and space control, requirements in the capacity of maritime 
transportation as well as naval supremacy. These concerns led indirectly to 
advances in naval technology, which gave rise to what has been called the 
“caravel revolution.” In this context and under these constraints, from the 
15th Century, a new wave of technological system was structured that 
nonetheless relied on the foundations established at the end of the Middle 
Ages. Unlike the previous phase, agriculture was no longer for this period, a 
driving domain of technological change. 
Due to all of the new social needs, the technological movement of the 
Renaissance initiated a significant breakthrough in machine technology. This 
movement concerned large construction machines, the hoisting machinery 
used for major construction and development works: Francesco di Giorgio’s 
hoisting machine, water draining machines in mines, large norias, Leonardo 
da Vinci’s machine for digging channels, etc. [GIL 64]. It also concerned the 
development of production machines: the textile industrial machinery, wood 
and early metal work machinery, with an extraordinary expansion of lathes 
and dedicated machines such as filing machines or machines to cut 
gemstones. The Renaissance led to progress in transportation machines with 
various innovations: the mobile front axle, suspension systems, the 
generalization of shoeing wheels; in another area, the channel lock which 
had considerably promoted the development of river transport networks and 
also essential architectural innovations concerning the boat which allowed 
the size to be increased as a result of the development of the sternpost rudder 
[GUI 73]. 
Regarding energy machines, innovation, already well underway in the 
medieval period, continued with hydraulic mills; however, this period 
witnessed in particular the emergence of the windmill, or more exactly its 
dissemination in Northern Europe, as a generalized machine of economical 
use [DAU 65]. Frequently, in analyses of the transformation of the 
Renaissance, printing is always presented as a major change. It was certainly 
so in terms of its social impact through its mass dissemination, by creating a 
new universal ground for the book. At the strictly technical level, it mostly 
consisted of a functional and architectural innovation involving bringing 
together existing and known techniques. It was the reproduction system 
employing types, related to the dissemination of paper, which would turn 
printing into a mass production technology. On the contrary, this 
transformation was not only quantitative, but also qualitative through the 

26     The Ongoing Technological System 
capacity for “identical” reproduction, without the inevitable degradation of 
the information by the copyist; this had a great impact on the diffusion 
capacities of formalized technology and science [FEB 99]. 
Another technology, watchmaking, contributed to a surprisingly fast 
process of miniaturization along with the accompanying development, from 
the beginning of the 15th Century, of portable domestic clocks and then of 
individual watches at the beginning of the 16th Century [LAN 87]. 
 
Figure 2.3. Table of the Renaissance technological system (Author’s diagram) 
The technology of mechanical systems was mainly stimulated by the 
improvement of system performance, because technological progress could 
not be brought by new breakthroughs in the understanding of materials. The 
source of technical progress then resided in continuously improving the 
performance of systems which remained stable in their energy sources and 

The Historical Dynamics of Technological Systems     27 
their component materials. Progress involved improvements in capturing 
known energies, mainly water, hence several works on paddle wheel and 
turbine systems, and on movement transmission that allowed performing 
new functionalities. The result thereof was the major invention of this period 
which was the crankshaft system, probably at the origin of part of the 
expansion of machinery, of lathes in particular [GIL 78]. 
The principal innovation of the technological system of the Renaissance 
compared to that of the medieval period was the scale. Relative to the 
medieval system, the Renaissance system achieved great things in terms of 
development, military technology and urban planning given that there was 
already a system of large machines: it was thereby also a power system. 
2.1.3. Stabilization and classical maturity 
The third wave of this technological movement spanned the 17th and 
18th Centuries, during the so-called classical age, that ended with the 
materialization of the changes begun in the 12th Century. This final period 
was the phase of slowdown in innovation and technological saturation, 
formalized in the French Encyclopedia. It ended around 1780 with the 
beginning of a period of disruptive innovation, initializing a radically new 
technological system, known as the industrial revolution. 
A phase of mechanical improvements lead to saturation: “During these 
two hundred years, without major innovations, the machine still held a vital 
role. Whether in small mechanics and watchmaking, or concerning the 
‘heavy’ mechanics of mills, a large number of improvements could be seen 
which, although minor, had enabled it to achieve a real maturity.” [JAC 90, 
p. 206] This was the case of the windmill which did not change, except in 
terms of scale. The technical system became stuck because of the lack of 
opportunities to improve mechanical yields due to transmission components, 
in particular cogwheels, still manufactured in wood. This was also the case 
for the water mill, which was an older and the most widespread energy 
source [GIL 64]. 
Finally, the recurring problem of water exhausting mines re-emerged in a 
critical manner. It had already been largely solved by Agricola in the 16th 
Century, since it had been the subject of slow and continuous progress in 
traditional wheels, norias and pump systems. This issue would remain, for 
200 years, one of the most powerful vectors of innovation, and all the more  
 

28     The Ongoing Technological System 
as mining exploitation developed, to the point that it would be at the origin 
of the development of the steam engine in the second half of the 18th 
Century. 
The overall conclusion is given by Paul Gille: “At that moment in the 
18th Century, when industrial development and especially its extensions into 
the 19th Century, required new and more powerful facilities for energy 
production, water mills, as they were designed based on the traditional 
mode, were unable to meet the demand for energy.” [DAU 68] 
Maturity and technological limits are the words that define this period of 
maturation which did not change any of the machines and techniques that 
were implemented since the 12th Century. The pre-industrial technological 
system had occupied its entire space and refined the systems which it was 
made of. It was ready for grafting new materials and the important artificial 
energy source, steam. 
2.2. The English Industrial Revolution and the first industrial 
technological system 
The general blockage in the technological world at the end of the 18th 
Century had led to a technological revolution often called “the Industrial 
Revolution”. It resulted from the necessary overcoming of local bottlenecks 
resulting in the emergence of new generic technologies. This is how the 
production of artificial energy, in the form of the steam engine, was born of 
the need to overcome the performance limitation of pumping mining water 
which had until then been taken care of by the hydraulic energy of paddle 
wheels. The economic growth in this period and the metallurgical and coal 
demands that it had caused resulted in an increase of both mining depths and 
scales accompanied by a considerable increase in the volumes of seepage 
water that had to be extracted. The first steam engine, Newcomen’s 
atmospheric steam engine, was initiated around 1712, its first activity in the 
collieries of British mines, coupled to a pump. Since its operation was not 
satisfactory, it was quickly replaced by the Watt steam engine, developed 
between 1780 and 1787, which was used for the same function [FER 80]. 
However, this type of machine possessed such a reserve of power and 
potential for generating miniaturization that it became the main technology 
for energy generation. This technology revolutionized land transport with the 
railroad, maritime transport with steam ships, and became the dominant form 
of industrial energy generation for factories and lifting. The alternative Watt 
steam engine thus represented the first generic technology of this first 

The Historical Dynamics of Technological Systems     29 
industrial technological system. It underwent further progress and 
considerable development until its own saturation towards the end of the 
19th Century. 
 
Figure 2.4. Diagram of the first industrial  
technological system, 1789–1875 (Author’s diagram) 
The increase in powers and transformation scales would generate, at the 
same time, the lack of a dominant material, a role that wood assumed, 
together with its large-scale replacement by ferrous materials such as iron. 
This was created and made possible by means of radical advances in 
metallurgy at the end of the 18th Century, particularly with blast furnace 
technology. This is why we have a monument dating from the Industrial 
Revolution, the famous Iron Bridge on the River Severn built by the 
Wilkinson brothers in 1779. This new metallurgy, producing iron of better 
quality and in abundance, was at the origin of a widespread innovation 
movement that materialized in the first development of iron mechanization. 
The latter, in turn, generated mechanical developments, which, for example, 
contributed to the development and improvement of the Watt steam machine 
including the ability to bore large-sized cylinders by using, for example, the 
Wilkinson boring machine from 1775 [DAU 68]. 
The third generic technology is the textile transformation technology, 
which contributed to the technological and industrial progress of this period. 
This was stimulated by the abundance of raw materials, such as wool and 
cotton, as well as by expanding markets, at the domestic level due to 

30     The Ongoing Technological System 
economic growth and at the external level due to the expansion in colonial 
markets. The English textile industry experienced a transformation driven by 
a current of innovation which at this point also marked the emergence of the 
industrial machine on a large scale. It was the succession of the machines 
created by Arkwright, Cartwright, as well as John Kay’s flying shuttle, and 
Vaucansson’s and Jacquard’s machines, which maintained a of innovation 
inside an industrial chain. Furthermore, technological breakthroughs is 
spinning had caused such an increase in yarn production in weaving that 
innovations became mandatory. Once materialized, they created in turn, 
because of their scale of productivity, a shortage of wire, which had forced 
progress in this area [ROS 76]. 
This system had to meet a series of limitations which the steam engine 
was particularly representative of, being decisive to the crisis of the 
technological system combined with that of the materials of the moment 
such as iron and cast iron. Alternative steam engines experienced a gain of 
power in addition to permanent and regular performance due to an increase 
of steam pressures obtained in boilers, which at one time was limited by the 
materials available. The limitation in the development of iron caused  
the limitations to the performance of the steam machine. At the same time, 
the mechanical reserve for increasing the performance of the alternative 
steam engine through successive levels of steam relaxation, known as the 
“compound” system, was reaching its exhaustion point. 
These limitations made it impossible for the steam-textile iron machine 
system to continue generating a continuous current of innovation and 
improvement in performance. New technological avenues such as the 
generalization of steel and machinery, new energies, such as electricity and 
thermal energy, new areas of activity such as chemistry would carve the 
features of the new technological system, namely that of the second 
Industrial Revolution. 
This is the system that we will briefly describe in the following chapter to 
focus on its crisis in the 1970s, which was responsible for the emergence of 
the third technological system, the current technological system.

The Contemporary Technological System 
Emerges from the Previous One or the 
Third Technological Revolution 
3.1. The second industrial technological system 
The second Industrial Revolution, whose initial developments originated 
between the 1870s and the 1890s, has only recently been identified as a 
major moment of technological advancement [LAN 75]. It was a period of 
change, transition and development of a wave of new generic technologies, 
generating new industries initially creating a whole range of new products 
that we refer to as the “mechanical-electro-chemical” system, or second 
technological industrial system, and which would last until the end of the 
1970s. 
3.1.1. The new generic technologies at the origin of this second 
system 
The new technological universe that emerged at the end of the 19th 
Century was structured by four currents of new generic technologies: a 
current of new materials initially centered on metallurgy, a revolution in 
mechanics, the birth of chemistry, as well as new forms of energy including 
the very transformative electric power.

Figure 3.1. General diagram of the second  
techno-industrial system, 1873–1975 
3.1.1.1. The new materials 
“If the most important feature of technical activity in the last third of the 
19th Century had to be identified, it would be the substitution of iron by steel 
and the concomitant increase in the consumption of this metal per person” 
[LAN 75]. This revolution of steel was especially that of new processes – 
Bessemer, Martin, Thomas-Gilchrist – which were going to completely 
transform the production of this metal to the extent of bringing down its cost 
by 80–90% between 1860 and 1890, in addition to achieving a near total 
substitution over iron, as well as an increase in steel production by a factor 
of 83 between 1860 and 1913. 

The Third Technological Revolution     33 
The development of steel was only the beginning of a metallurgical 
revolution that came to life due to a considerable development, dependent on 
electricity, in the industrial production of new metals, not only for copper, 
aluminum, chromium and nickel in particular, but also for alloys derived 
from them. 
This creative current of new materials would quickly go beyond the 
metallurgical field. It also concerned cement that transformed construction 
and civil engineering as well as artificial resins such as Bakelite, the field of 
cellulosic materials such as celluloid, viscose and fibranne, as well as the 
appearance during the last period of this system of synthetic materials such 
as the first plastics and nylon. 
This disruption shows a trend observed in every change in technology 
systems: the significant diversification of the range of materials available 
and the increased creative freedom resulting from such a change. 
3.1.1.2. A new mechanics 
The proliferation of a new generation of machine tools and the 
development of mechanical machines destined for general public use would 
consist of another powerful source of technical renewal and innovation. 
These new machines, mainly machine tools, were brought about by the 
development of steel metallurgy and from electric propulsion. They had the 
effect of considerably increasing the speed and precision of work as well as 
decreasing human intervention in the work process leading to a continuous 
movement that introduced mechanical and electromechanical automation 
into these machines [BUR 63]. 
This evolution in machine tooling areas would have a consequence in 
terms of the capacity to manufacture and to market complex machines to be 
used by the general public such as bicycles, repeater firearms, typewriters 
and sewing machines and then automobiles. The second technological 
revolution was also a revolution in consumption through the proliferation of 
new mechanical objects appearing during this period [LAN 75]. 
Nonetheless, this mechanical revolution did have an effect on internal 
acceleration by means of the new constraints of controlling the friction that it 
generated as a result of the increase in speeds and powers. It has led to the  
 
 
 

34     The Ongoing Technological System 
fine resolution of problems related to controlling these contact and motion 
issues through the invention of new devices such as the ball bearing or the 
revolution in lubrication with the introduction of mineral lubricants derived 
from hydrocarbons. 
3.1.1.3. A new industrial activity: chemistry 
It is also during this period that a new industrial activity, chemistry  
[DAU 78], came about, originating from new technology and relying on a 
science in full development. However, this development was going to  
be driven, both for mineral chemistry and organic chemistry, by the 
requirements of the textile industry and by the technological saturation of the 
production processes of basic chemicals required for textiles. 
First of all, it concerned the need for alkali, the soda of today, the 
substance necessary for the bleaching of cotton textiles. Alkali had 
experienced such growth in demand that the traditional production process, 
the Leblanc process, could no longer satisfy it, being replaced by the Solvay 
process, which was less polluting and provided a product three times 
cheaper. The maturity of this mineral chemistry was brought about by the 
electrolytic process that produced both soda and chlorine [LAN 75]. 
A development of the same order took place in organic synthesis 
chemistry, which was also driven by the requirements of the textile industry: 
the need for new dying sources due to the inadequacy of natural dyes to meet 
the very strong demand. The rise of this technology started in 1856 with the 
development of the first artificial aniline dye, mauveine, which would come 
to be followed by a whole series of synthetic dyes. These first creations 
opened the whole new field of organic chemistry to cellulose chemistry: 
explosives such as the fulmicoton, lacquers and photographic plates, 
celluloid, and artificial fibers such as rayon, fibranne and viscose. At the 
beginning of the 20th Century, the chemistry of synthetic resins such as  
Bakelite appeared. This new chemistry was introduced by large German 
companies, Badische Anilin, Agfa, Hoechst and the Swiss Ciba and Geigy, 
on the valleys of the Rhine and the Rhône [ROS 98]. 
3.1.1.4. Energy, new sources and new machines 
In terms of energy-based machines, the transition to a new technological 
system would focus on overcoming the performance bottleneck of the 
alternative steam engine. The steam machine was regenerated by the  
 
 

The Third Technological Revolution     35 
emergence of the steam turbine developed by the engineer Parsons in 1884 
[BUR 63]. The new device exceeded the limitations of the old steam engine 
by reusing all the gains of boiler technology, which were then coupled with a 
transformation of the ancient water turbine. The result could be seen in the 
evident advantage of producing energy directly under a rotary movement 
adapted to the new world of rotating machines. Subsequently, the first ranks 
of these innovations were then taken by naval propulsion and especially 
power generation, which had thus found its productive machine, still 
relevant nowadays. 
On the other hand, the alternative steam system would become the basis 
for a new technology of internal combustion engines that would experience a 
fantastic development with automotive and aviation industries. They 
appeared as a consequence of the mastery of a new source of energy, 
hydrocarbons, in addition to electricity as the essential support for generating 
a spark for igniting those engines [CON 83]. 
This leap in energy machines, constitutive of the second technological 
system, represented a fine example of technological transition in which the 
old technology was regenerated through its combination with inputs from the 
new technological system being built. Therefore, radically new technical 
systems were created by rearranging the former technical devices within the 
logic of the new system. 
Electricity would represent a major component of this technological 
revolution, contributing two combined features: its flexibility or capacity to 
transform itself into motion, heat and light in addition to its ability to 
transmit energy at great distance, particularly with the use of high voltage. 
Its transformative power originated from its transportability, in other words, 
its ability to be brought everywhere and to be distributed to a variety of users 
[HUG 83]. 
Electricity as a real new generic technology promoted the development of 
new areas of activity. The first which was to transform the lives of a large 
number of people was the electric light which came about as a result of the 
invention of the incandescent electric lamp around 1880. The second area 
was electrochemistry and heavy electrometallurgy: the manufacturing of 
aluminum and the Martin-Siemens process for the production of steel with 
electricity as well as the Castner process for the production of sodium and 
chlorine. 
 

36     The Ongoing Technological System 
Electricity became the almost universal energy source of industrial 
machinery with significant transformations in the architecture of plants and 
of the organization of work. The domain of rail transports was also 
transformed by electric energy traction, particularly in urban areas, with 
subway and streetcar lines appearing at the end of the 19th century. Electric 
railway traction became widespread after WWII. 
3.1.2. The formation of the second technological system 
The implementation of a new technological system not only meant the 
appearance and development of new technologies to replace and outperform 
the previous saturated technological system, but also consisted of the 
establishment of the interaction network between these new and old 
technologies which had thus been regenerated into a set of new technical 
systems in consistent interaction. 
This structuring of the technological universe created, in turn, new 
requirements in terms of knowledge production, work organization and more 
generally social organization, as well as a new way of relating to the natural 
environment. 
3.1.2.1. Technological structuring and the formation of a new 
coherence 
The relationship network being constituted between new technologies 
promoted not only the innovating possibilities that these brought about but 
also the constraints of change that they required, tending towards an overall 
coherence of technical and functional performance precisely at the level that 
the new technological system allowed for. This was observed throughout the 
entire structuring of the new technological system, as a permanent race for 
adjustments between the working speeds of machines, material resistance, 
machining and transformation precision, and the ability for addressing 
chemical bodies increasingly active, at the growing level of temperatures and 
pressures. In addition, it also involved the precision of measurements, 
namely in dimensional measuring, in the measurement of weights for the 
mixture industry, in measuring time, etc. [GIL 78]. This was the technical 
system which was going to become that of metrology, of paramount 
importance in order to control the precision level required by the new 
technological world. 

The Third Technological Revolution     37 
3.1.2.2. The implementation of a new industrial organization 
It was during this period, which took place at a rather late stage because it 
occurred in the 1910s, that a new organization of work was implemented 
based on formalized methods and better known as the scientific organization 
of labor. It was the completed and codified expression of the search process 
for maximal productivity particularly in what would become the great 
manufacturing industry. 
This approach was based on the division of workplaces and the 
introduction of time measurement. It concerned the last phase of a 
decomposition process of the workplace which was completely dependent on 
the development of machinery, as Karl Marx had already analyzed in the 
mid-19th Century, showing that the machine could only take into account 
the most simple gestures of a work activity, thus requiring the decomposition 
and division of the complex activity of the pre-industrial craftsman. Isolating 
a unitary work action, besides creating possibilities for mechanization, had 
the advantage of optimizing a simple gesture in order to increase its 
effectiveness in addition to also being able to measure it, to time it, creating 
a normative reference that could be imposed on the whole of the production 
process [MAR 67]. 
This reorganization of work places, leading to the creation of an activity 
for measuring and regulating labor, would thus integrate itself into new 
technical services specialized in measuring, controlling and coordinating 
tasks, making the production process open to being analyzed and controlled 
and thus to a continuous improvement of its performance [TAY 11]. 
This new form of work organization had been made possible by the 
electrification of the production apparatus, which gave a new freedom to the 
spatial organization of machines where the old pulley-belt energy 
transmission system of the central steam machine enclosed the factory 
organization inside a rigid spatial framework. Its development required a 
physical and spatial reorganization of the whole apparatus of production, so 
as to achieve coherence with the new form of direct labor management, by 
optimizing the flow of flux. This implementation assumed the form of the 
“assembly line” work organization in major manufacturing industries, 
inaugurated by Ford around 1920 in the United States. 
 

38     The Ongoing Technological System 
The complement of this process involved the harmonization of machine 
devices and workshops opening up the possibilities of industrial machinery 
such as maintenance machines and internal and external communication 
systems, centered on the telephone and the teleprinter that enabled the fast 
flow of data. 
The establishment of a new coherence could thus be observed between 
material and technical developments, enabling a new management of 
factories and promoting the implementation of a new organization of labor 
which would best exploit the potentials for productivity of the new 
technological system. This organization of labor reached its apex in the 
1920s and would spread throughout the production system until the 1970s 
when it faced a crisis with the technological system which carried it. 
3.1.2.3. The new relationship with the environment: the invention of 
new raw materials, the widespread use of fossil fuels 
The first industrial revolution was limited in terms of raw materials to the 
intensification of the exploitation of coal and metal mineral ores. The 
technological system that succeeded it multiplied sources and the volume of 
raw material that the productive system at the time would require. 
Initially, it concerned the “invention” of new raw materials through the 
implementation of processes allowing them to be used, such as the tenfold 
increase in resources of iron ores made possible by the capability that the 
Thomas-Gilchrist process offered in utilizing phosphorous iron deposits that 
were previously unusable. A similar process was initiated with bauxite, until 
then likely to be exploited as metal aluminum only. These new raw materials 
originating from new transformation processes included a whole range of 
non-ferrous metals such as copper, nickel or chrome. Waterfalls of large 
dimensions were now regarded as valuable because of the emergence of 
turbines for hydroelectric utilization. Owing to the abundance of accessible 
electricity, hydropower would in turn drive the development of the 
aluminum industry. 
Nevertheless, it was with the beginning of the exploitation of oil that this 
huge source of energy and raw material would become specific to this 
technological system. Oil gradually became a dominant energy, raising 
overall issues with regard to the environment which would become one of 
the components of its crisis [MAR 92]. 

The Third Technological Revolution     39 
3.1.2.4. A technology related to science 
The primary characteristic of most of the technology developed in the 
second technological system, especially metallurgy, chemistry and 
electricity, was their strong scientific component, in contrast to the first 
technological system based on still empirical technologies. 
The result was the establishment of an increasingly more organic 
relationship between technology and science, in the sense that the 
technological development of these areas was conditioned by the advances 
of science and also that the implementation of technical systems required 
personnel trained in and by science both at the engineering and at the 
management level as well as at the operational level [COR 76]. The 
productive apparatus thus transformed itself with the systematic 
development of both scientific and technical production instances [BOW 
88], research laboratories, the unprecedented development of scientific and 
technological training in universities and engineering schools in particular 
[CAM 71] and, finally, universal and compulsory primary education which, 
simultaneously, tended to be widespread in the 1880s. 
3.1.3. A technological system for one hundred years 
This technological system of which we have exposed both its 
characteristics and implementation processes would structure not only the 
technological but also the economic and world social space over the next 
hundred years. It led to an extraordinary development comprising of three 
successive phases. 
The great characteristic of the change in the first development phase was 
the differentiation and the ramification of the applications of generic 
technologies which took place from 1870 to 1880. The areas of this 
development were essentially mechanical, electrical and chemical and would 
lead to the emergence of the main technical systems that structured this 
system: industrial machinery, automobiles, etc. This phase continued until 
after the First World War, itself marked by this new technical system in the 
area of weaponry. 
As a whole, the second phase of the period, between the two world wars, 
was a deepening phase: “These were decades of development and 
achievement rather, in which the discoveries of the pre-war generation 
technically and commercially flourished” [LAN 75, p. 575]. 

40     The Ongoing Technological System 
 
Figure 3.2. Frequency of the great technical  
discoveries of the second technological system 
A few new products and technologies would be the driving force of the 
momentum. At the forefront was the automobile which was to become a 
mass product and a mass industry from the 1920s onwards as well as 
aeronautics, which in the same period initiated a real commercial life 
originating almost exclusively from military and sports utilizations. 
Nonetheless, electric technologies were the ones to provide the basis for a 
powerful development of products and markets. First of all, this included all 
electric and electromechanical domestic equipment products: washing  
 
 

The Third Technological Revolution     41 
machines, irons, vacuum cleaners, etc., which would further lead to a 
multiplication of electrical household circuits, distinguishing light and force. 
The personal home radio, originating from work on diode lamps dating back 
to 1906, was actually the main new product of widespread dissemination 
during the interwar period, as the first consumer product of electronics. A 
very large development followed thereof due to both its diffusion among the 
public and the decrease in professional and military usages. 
The last phase of the mechanical-electro-chemical technology system, 
1945–1975, was marked by the industrial and commercial exploitation of 
prior technological innovations. This was mainly due to the fact that in the 
years following the Second World War, all the great discoveries and 
applications ensuing from the principles of metallurgy, mechanics, 
electricity, electronics and chemistry were already achieved and were 
undergoing a phase of exploitation and improving innovation. 
However, this last system phase also involved the formation, in the aging 
technological system, of technological bases which would convey the 
replacement system. 
From the fifties onwards, the new wave of synthetic materials, nuclear 
power, space expansion and especially advanced electronics and computing 
appeared [LAN 75]. 
3.2. The electromechanical technological system crisis 
With the first oil embargo in 1973, a process of crisis which would bring 
15 years of economic decline, low growth and technological turbulence was 
initiated. This crisis had its origin and permanent basis in a technological 
revolution comparable to that of the end of the last century, and which has 
been called the third technological revolution. It began, like all those that 
historically preceded it, with a depletion phase of the major technologies and  
the decreasing performance of the original system causing a crisis in the 
whole economic, social and cultural body. This is what we have experienced 
since the beginning of the 1970s with the collapse of the “electric-
mechanical-chemical” technological system, whose origin and peak have 
been described earlier. 
 

42     The Ongoing Technological System 
The concern is now to analyze the ensuing crisis, which was based on 
three levels: 
– first of all, an internal system crisis originating in the exhaustion of 
generic technologies that created direct effects of industrial crisis and also of 
depletion in the production of knowledge and new technologies; 
– this decline in efficiency generated economic effects in terms of 
lowered productivity, depletion of the flow of new products and crisis in 
industrial organization; 
– this situation exacerbated the contradictions that were starting to be 
seen between this declining technological system and the social framework, 
the labor organization and model of consumption into which it had 
developed. 
 
Figure 3.3. General outline of the second  
technological system crisis [AÏT 89] 
3.2.1. The saturation of generic technologies and its direct 
manifestations 
3.2.1.1. A general situation of technological limitation: the disruptive 
process 
The electromechanical technology system reached its internal limitations 
in the 1970s. This means that most of the major technologies that contributed 
to the development of society for around 100 years faced a saturation phase;  
 

The Third Technological Revolution     43 
in other words, these technologies were no longer able to generate massive 
performance gains without generating increasing constraints and nuisances 
at various levels: gigantism, complexity, regulation and pollution problems, 
etc. [MEN 79]. This saturation, by way of the degradation of the 
advantages/nuisances ratio that it generated, contributed in turn to degrade 
the social acceptability of the technologies implemented and to damage the 
relationship of the system with its ecological context. 
The consequence of this evolution was that productive systems organized 
around these technologies were no longer able to massively provide, and 
under the best conditions, the goods and services which were sources of 
wealth. Consequently, the result was the exhaustion of both market 
opportunities and productivity gains. 
3.2.1.1.1. The inability of traditional technologies to meet economic 
and social requirements 
One of the more meaningful cases in this area was that of 
electromechanical technologies. These technologies, which had acquired a 
dominant role in processing and transporting information, had reached their 
limit, mainly due to their inability to follow the increase in the volume and 
diversity of information to be processed and transported, leading to them 
being massively replaced by electronics in the 1960s–1970s. Along with the 
gradual disappearance of devices for processing information by means of 
punch cards, or the replacement of so-called “crossbar” electromechanical 
telephone exchanges saturated by the increase in traffic, a general process 
for the substitution of electronics for these electromechanical devices had 
begun. 
3.2.1.1.2. The most evolutionary devices of the declining system 
require technological leaps 
At the height of the electromechanical technological system, 
sophisticated technical systems had been developed in the form of high-
performance technical objects such as computers or advanced devices such 
as space telecommunications networks. The technical developments of these 
objects and devices had saturated the possibilities of the generic technologies 
available, which were then no longer able to provide the massive increase in 
performance required. Solutions had to then be searched in totally new 
concepts, in completely different technological designs. This was one of the 
driving forces of technological disruption. 

44     The Ongoing Technological System 
Whether it concerns materials or engineering systems, the degree of 
sophistication reached by the end of the 1960s in aerospace, supersonic 
aircrafts, rockets and space shuttles saturated some of the engineering 
systems and required a technology leap achieved in particular by CAD 
(computer-aided design). A particularly striking example of this type of 
problem was caused by the saturation of wind tunnel engineering systems 
thanks to the growing complexity of “flying machines” being developed. 
These ruptures also related to the field of electronic components where the 
precision of engineering, given the dimensions, made direct human 
architectural engineering impracticable and required the use of computer 
designing. 
In fact, we are here at the very heart of the changeover process between 
technological systems. The development of the new one, based on the 
previous system, was achieved in two ways: 
– the technological foundations of change have matured within the old 
system: microprocessor, discovery of DNA, etc.; 
– products and devices, created during the old system but already too 
sophisticated for the technology solutions that it was able to implement, 
created contradictions between the constraints for controlling complexity, for  
achieving precision, or of the reaction speed and the potential of the system 
implemented. The disruption became inevitable. 
In other words, we could say that certain technical systems age with the 
generic technology upon which they rely, that others survive it because they 
are regenerated by the technological solutions of emerging systems and, 
finally, that others by means of the power of their development dynamics 
generate needs for new processes or new technological concepts. These will 
be the key areas for the development and implementation of solutions 
provided by new generic technologies; they will create functionalities that 
require resorting to a new system. 
3.2.1.2. The decreasing performance of research – the exhaustion of 
the capacity for innovation 
A large consequence of the depletion of generic technologies and more 
generally of the “scientific paradigm”, which were the basis for the previous 
technological system, was the growing ineffectiveness of research systems, 
observed in the early 1970s. The most elaborated presentation of this theory 
making use of the best argumentation can be found in a small book by  
 

The Third Technological Revolution     45 
O. Giarini and H. Loubergé, La civilisation technicienne à la derive  
[GIA 79], with the subtitle: les rendements décroissants de la technologie 
(“the decreasing returns of technology”). 
In summary, the authors’ thesis is the following: in view of the 
relationship between economic growth and technical progress, the stagnation 
of growth is reflected by a likely slowdown of technical progress and, given 
the organic relationship established between technical progress and the 
research apparatus, the decrease in effectiveness of the research apparatus 
should be regarded as one of the major causes of the crisis. In the authors’ 
synthetic formulation: “Our theory is that, in a given historical context, the 
incorporation of technical progress to the production sphere allowed for a 
period of strong growth. But the impact of this contribution has  
gradually decreased to become negligible today... The overall marginal 
productivity of any investment in Research and Development would today 
tend to zero, which would explain the slowing down and the end of growth”1 
[GIA 79]. 
This significant cause was reflected by a decrease in research profitability 
and an increase in the risks of this activity. It was magnified by the feedback 
from resource allocation cuts, which intensified and deepened the crisis. 
3.2.1.2.1. The increase in research costs and of the time between 
scientific discovery and economic effect 
Most of the argumentation consists of refuting the theory of the 
acceleration of technical progress such that it was at the end of the 1960s. 
For the authors, this was due to an illusion, to the confusion between two 
distinct phenomena: the technical phenomenon of industrializing a discovery 
and the socio-cultural phenomenon of the awareness of innovation. “Until 
recent years, cultural acceleration has been stronger than technical 
slowdown: entrepreneurs became increasingly more aware of technical 
advances and exploited all the inventions that could be used in the public 
domain... the delay time between research and innovation could give the 
illusion of a narrowing” [GIA 79]. 
                                        
1  An American author, Fred. M. Scherer, has shown that, among the seven developed 
countries, all accepted that Japan had experienced a “height” in the amount of patents filed 
which occurred between 1967 and 1971. “The world productivity growth slump”, August 
1984, International Institute of Management, Berlin (Multigr). 

46     The Ongoing Technological System 
Thus, a period of incompressible maturation, probably growing due to the 
increase in scientific and technical complexity, opposed the idea of 
accelerating technical progress; systematic undervaluation errors in 
technological forecasting and futurology exercises are the proof that 
confirms this trend. 
 
Figure 3.4. Overall diagram of the R&D crisis in the 1970s [AÏT 89] 
On a purely technical level, science-based technological progress always 
requires lengthy periods of time first because “a discovery is rarely the result 
of an illumination. Most often, it is a long journey that requires decades to 
progress by small steps and great leaps”. However, also because “even when a 
new technology has been developed until the prototype stage, its 
industrialization often requires several years before it is presented to the 
public” [GIA 79, p. 66]. The resulting economic effects include an increase in 
costs and risks causing enterprises to turn away from this activity, which will 
contribute – due to resource scarcity – to further reducing its effectiveness. 
3.2.1.2.2. A consequence: the general and regular slowdown of 
research expenditures in developing countries 
Data cited in the above-mentioned book highlight, in the case of the 
United States, that the growth rate of actual R&D expenditures (after 
showing a significant decline in the 1961–1967 period compared with the 
1950–1960 period) further decreases by a factor of 2 in the 1967–1975 
period, both for federal spending and for private spending2. This widespread 
                                        
2 Source: National Science Foundation, p. 59 in [GIA 79]. 

The Third Technological Revolution     47 
phenomenon across Western developed countries is confirmed by all of the 
OECD studies at the beginning of the 1980s. Focusing on industrial research, 
the OECD study, “Technical change and economic policy” highlights that 
“since the end of the 1960s, industrial R&D has stopped increasing at the 
same rate as the late 1950s and early 1960s”3. This regression, at least 
relative, particularly concerns industrial R&D dedicated to the production of 
basic knowledge. Figures in data tracing the evolution of this item of 
expenditure (in percentage of R&D expenditures for natural sciences and 
engineering) for twelve countries of the OECD including the United States 
show a significant regression from 1967 to 1975. The decline appears 
comparable for public R&D, in particular “the expansion rate of university 
research has significantly declined” points out the previously cited study as 
part of a summary of tendencies. 
Nevertheless, this general quantitative stagnation of the research effort 
is accompanied by a qualitative change, as can be interpreted from the 
above-mentioned trends. The OECD study previously cited defines it as 
“the decline in long-term exploratory research” and “the tendency to take 
fewer risks”, stressing, especially for the United States, that “the time 
horizon of research and development in the United States has significantly 
shrunk, and efforts are focusing more and more on improving existing 
products”. 
This decrease in investment in research probably in turn caused a 
slowdown in innovation production without excluding the possibility, during 
the same period, of an increase in the productivity of the research apparatus 
that nobody had expected. 
 
                                        
3 Paris 1980, pp. 37–38, as well as the quotes below pp. 40–41 and p. 65 refer to “Science 
policy for the years 1980”, OECD 1981. This is a report that, in a more “normative” and 
forward-looking form, focuses “...on a period in which the pace of innovation experiences, it 
seems, a certain decline”. A table shows in particular, among the countries of the OECD, 
“...that throughout the 1970s, the volume of R&D funded and implemented by the industrial 
sector (expressed as a percentage of GNP) has remained, at most, stationary in the majority of 
the countries of the OECD (with the exception of Germany and some smaller industrial 
countries)” p. 35. 

48     The Ongoing Technological System 
3.2.1.2.3. The research crisis worsened by the general crisis 
The depressive impact of these increasing risks on the research effort has 
been, from 1975 onwards, magnified by the crisis itself and in at least three 
ways: 
– By means of an increased caution on the part of industrialists to engage 
financial resources that became increasingly scarce in research programs, 
which turned out to be even more random due to the instability of markets 
and technological turbulence. 
– Through a more pronounced distortion of resource allocation in solving 
massive problems that at the time appeared as fierce challenges, such as the 
issue of energy and the technical response to the soaring costs of production 
caused by the energy crisis. 
– Finally, by the reduction in public resources which, besides its effect in 
terms of immediate activity, created distortions in the human structure – 
aging and non-renewal – of the research apparatus [OCD 80]. 
It has been necessary to wait for the shining domination of new areas by 
means of advances in information technology, biotechnology, etc., the 
withdrawal of funding bodies in former areas, the profound crises of some 
research institutions – and in particular the disappearance of the large 
traditional companies that supported them – the renewal of generations of 
researchers or the slow cultural revolution of some of them, to witness a 
reemergence, in the 1980s, of a new powerful research and discovery 
current. The large mobilizing programs such as Eureka, Esprit or 
Prometheus in Europe are symptomatic of this evolution. 
3.2.2. Some of the indirect and global manifestations of the 
technological system crisis 
The limitations of the declining technological system are revealed in 
three economic manifestations: exhaustion of the ability to generate 
powerful lines of new products, lower productivity and decreasing 
performance of industrial systems. In all cases, we can find an original 
cause: the depletion of the resource deposit initially opened by the 
technological paradigm of the second industrial revolution that had supplied 
a hundred years of economic growth. 

The Third Technological Revolution     49 
3.2.2.1. The exhaustion of the renewal of consumer products 
The great waves of consumption which, by means of a sharp increase in 
the end demand, have maintained this economic growth have always relied 
on new products themselves, created by the development of technological 
resources and by the dissemination of innovations. At the end of the 1960s, 
the wide range of consumer products – automobiles, household goods, 
television and consumer electronics – approached a saturation of the 
equipment market. This area of sustainable consumption entered a phase of 
market renewal only. It then clearly appeared that the major technologies of 
the moment, mechanics, electromechanics and a first generation of 
electronics were not able to either generate new concepts of mass products 
nor sufficiently renew the functionalities of existing products in order to 
open new mass markets or accelerate the renewal cycles [OCD 83]. 
In this first technological transition phase, development addressed the 
slow integration of the first spin off of the new technological system. In the 
automotive industry, insertion of composites, control electronics in engines, 
form improvement and weight reductions made by CAD, are significant 
examples of this evolution. Prior to that and in areas where such an 
improvement was not possible, minor innovations took place, called pseudo-
innovations. This was the case with television in which the real 
developments expected concerned high-definition and flat screens; in the 
meantime, waiting for these real changes to happen, subsequent innovation 
had consisted in the development of square corner screens which, despite 
improving ease of use, did not upgrade the degree of precision of the image 
received whatsoever. It was necessary to wait, for instance, for the 
microcomputer, the CD and the CD player, the computer-guided vehicle, the 
domestic robot and high-definition television to witness new major mass 
markets. Nevertheless, we have already addressed the contributions of the 
new technological system. 
3.2.2.2. Productivity slowdown 
The crisis saw a decline in all productivity indicators. It is remarkable 
that this decline affected not only the global productivity of the economic 
apparatus but also that of the manufacturing industry, which had played a 
leading role in terms of productivity in the whole growth period. 
 

50     The Ongoing Technological System 
3.2.2.2.1. A trend prior to the triggering of the general crisis 
What is even more remarkable is that this decline in productivity was 
prior to the rupture of 1974. It is striking to observe that the productivity 
growth rate reached its peak during the 1964–1969 period in all major 
industrialized countries, with the exception of the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom, which could no longer reach the high productivity levels 
of growth in the sixties [CET 84]. 
This inflection highlights, through the technological dimension of 
productivity, the technological nature of this crisis. 
3.2.2.2.2. A sign of the weakness of technical progress 
Productivity strongly depends on the increase in the technical 
effectiveness of the capital incorporated into production. The inflection of 
productivity thus meant that, by the mid-1960s, more and more capital was 
needed to obtain a given production increase. 
For this period, in the face of an ever significant investment movement 
and a growth movement which was still strong, the problem of the continuity 
of the rate of technical progress should be raised. The main assumption is 
that the loss of momentum of technical advances incorporated in capital was 
manifested by the decline in effectiveness, which it transmitted to the 
productive apparatus [CLE 85]. 
3.2.2.2.3. Two social factors: the increase in the portion of the tertiary 
sector and the labor organization crisis 
The last period of growth, which corresponded to the decade of the 
1960s, was marked by a massive increase in the contribution of the tertiary 
sector to economic activity [FOU 79], from 29% in 1930 to 54% in 1962. 
The global effect of this transfer was a general productivity decrease, since it 
involved transferring the active workforce of an industrial activity with a 
relatively high productivity to a tertiary activity having a low and stagnant 
productivity. This was especially the case since the development of this 
tertiary sector resulted, in part, from the supported management of the costs 
of inefficiency in an industrial sector which had been especially concerned 
with technical efficiency in the field of material production. A certain 
generalization of computing, and particularly of the advances in information  
 
 
 

The Third Technological Revolution     51 
technology, constituted without any doubt a somewhat late powerful 
response to what was becoming an inevitable limit of productivity growth.  
This decline in productivity is also explained by a crisis in the organization 
of labor, which is a topic that we will address in more detail further in  
the text. 
3.2.2.2.4. Stalling in growth and production decline after 1974 in turn 
caused falling productivity 
Productivity downturn was significant after 1974. This movement was 
totally mechanical or simply arithmetic: the slump in production that 
accompanied the brutal decline in growth could not have been followed by a 
similar reduction in capital and labor. In the specific case of capital, the 
indivisibilities of facilities designed for mass production and to take 
advantage of economies of scale did not allow, in many cases, for a flexible 
adaptation to a reduction in production. 
3.2.2.3. The economies of scale crisis 
At the end of the 1960s emerged the phenomenon that a famous article in 
the magazine Economia called in 1977 “the end of cathedrals” [BAR 77]. 
This concerned the awareness of the increasing inefficiency of very large 
industrial estates. However, it was common in the previous twenty year to 
design and build huge industrial aggregates in processing industries (steel, 
chemicals, petrochemicals) but also in assembling industries (automotive, 
shipbuilding, electronics). Everyone can still remember the gigantic 
industrial concentrations of Pittsburg, Detroit or Osaka, the huge BASF 
chemical complex, 120,000 people in Ludwigshafen in Germany or in 
France and the large car factories confined to the middle of the beet fields of 
Flins and Poissy. 
The proliferation of this type of industrial concentration is justified by the 
theory, unanimously accepted in the 1960s, of economies of scale. Its main 
idea was that an industrial plant was all the more efficient at the technological 
and economic levels if this installation was large. Plants at the time required 
powerful integrated infrastructures. These were all the more profitable when 
the scale of production was large. The consequence therefore was that, even if 
very large-sized plants were obtained with considerable investment amounts, 
the production level per monetary unit invested or per employee was higher 
and the cost correlatively low. 
 

52     The Ongoing Technological System 
This obvious truth suddenly proved false in most of the industries at the 
end of the 1960s. The failure of the Fos-sur-Mer complex in France during 
this period is indicative of the death of the “dinosaurs”. This term dinosaur is 
used here on purpose because it can be assumed that the phenomenon of 
economies of scale is the sign of an advanced maturity of technologies of 
this period, truly reflecting that these technologies had no more performance 
reserves such that highly increasing levels of productivity could be obtained 
from facilities without increasing sizes. 
This reversal of effectiveness constitutes a process that combines three 
developments: 
– The saturation of the unit performance of processes, a situation of 
technical limit, which we have already explained. 
– The freezing of performance in technical systems and industrial plants, 
in the global sense, by generating exponential needs for coordination and 
regulation. Large industrial units are thus overwhelmed by the information 
systems needed for their management. The increase in the coordination cost 
becomes a decisive expense from certain size levels onward. In this case, we 
encounter a phenomenon of increasing entropy, of which we will see a 
manifestation comparable and symmetrical to the limits of Taylorism. 
Briefly and in other words, it turns out that similar disorganization has been 
created when concurrently aiming for too ambitious designs in industrial 
apparatus and pushing fragmentation in the organization of labor too far. 
– Absolute effects of size, which we could call extra costs of 
infrastructure, congestion or concentration. They are a priori independent of 
the performance level of the facilities; they appear due to the fact that the 
gigantism of facilities generates very strong nuisances in terms of pollution, 
congestion and travel. 
Finally, a last problem which has been little understood should be 
outlined, that of the cost of the maintenance and renewal of these types of 
facilities, which is itself proportional to the size. The relative inefficiency of 
these industrial complexes was a problem: oil crises, the decline in 
production following the start of the first crisis, and the inflation which 
accompanied it conferred on it a catastrophic turn, sufficient to explain the 
collapse of whole industry areas.

schematic representation of the process [AÏT 89] 
3.2.2.4. The crisis of the relationship with the natural environment 
This crisis exhibited a double component: on the one hand, a tendency for 
the depletion of the resources upon which the expansion of the system was 
based and, on the other hand, the accumulation of waste that threatened the 
global balance of this system with its ecology. The Club of Rome had, as 
early as 1970, drawn attention to the dangers of these trends. 
3.2.2.4.1. The issue of raw materials and energy 
Each technological system develops a special relationship with the 
natural environment. It can even be said that the notion of natural 
environment is related to the modes of production and of the uses that a 
technological system implements. The limits of the natural and the artificial 
worlds and the nature, form and volume of the components that can be used 
as raw materials finally depend on both the destined technical usage  
 
 
 
 

54     The Ongoing Technological System 
and on the technical capability to do so. The abundance or scarcity of raw 
materials depends on the intensity of their use as well as on the techniques 
that allow accessing them. The term “techno-nature”, designed by Ph. 
Roqueplo [ROQ 83], refers to this form of historical relativity of the natural 
environment. Thus, oil, known since ancient times as a curiosity or deployed 
for marginal uses, becomes an essential raw material, due to the potential of 
its use that emerges, especially with the automotive industry and because of 
the new technical abilities to extract it effectively and massively. 
However, this technological system saturates in turn the type and the 
heritage of relationships that it had established with nature: it erodes the 
natural external operating conditions that it had itself introduced. For  
the technological system that is being abandoned, the limit will come from 
the risk of exhausting non-reproducible raw fossil materials, upon which its 
expansion was achieved more than others [CLU 72]. 
This relationship is evident in the field of energy and raw materials. Up 
until the end of the first Industrial Revolution, earlier systems had extracted 
everything they could from the power of the wind and water as energies, 
from wood as fuel and, also as basic materials in construction, from salt in 
food preservation. Analogously, the electromechanical system saturated the 
possibilities offered by almost exclusive utilization of oil as a source of 
primary energy and minerals as a raw material. This perspective of shortage 
would cause the sharp increase in the price of major energy, oil and, to a 
lesser extent, other raw materials which, in turn, had accelerated or at least 
expanded the technological crisis [CHE 73]. 
3.2.2.4.2. The issue of pollution 
The second form of this crisis saw the technical and economic system 
threatening to break the balance with the environment due to the impact of 
its discharges. Regardless of their nature, these become polluting by 
accumulation effect. 
The notion that pollution was an invention of the end of the 1960s has 
long prevailed. This is a wrong notion for everyone who recalls the darkness 
of all major Western cities suffering the effect of coal fumes, the poisoning 
of the local population caused by the chemical consequences of the Leblanc  
 
 
 

The Third Technological Revolution     55 
process, and the indelible – and sometimes dangerous – traces left in the 
landscape by waste sites, heaps of coal and metallurgical areas. 
When all of the produced pollutants manifested by oil, nuclear and 
chemical disasters raised awareness that the technological system in place 
threatened the relationship of humanity with the biosphere, the legislative 
pressure, as of opinion, quickly had the same effect as the increase in prices 
on the sustainability of certain technical devices. The most striking example 
is probably that of nuclear fission, for which this inability to find a technical 
and economic solution satisfactory to the real or assumed dangers that this 
form of energy exposes to surrounding populations doomed it to finally 
become dormant as a false new technology. 
3.2.3. The technological system and organization crisis 
The technological system crisis has manifested itself, at the organization 
level, by a main syndrome: the labor organization crisis. 
3.2.3.1. The scientific organization of labor crisis 
At the end of the 1960s, the system of the organization of work, a major 
mechanism of the Western socio-economic system, suffered an endemic and 
violent crisis. It assumed various forms, from the large general strike of May 
1968 in France, up to some types of working-class protest, unheard of until 
then; permanent and growing malfunctions (absenteeism, turnover, 
manufacturing defects), a violent criticism of the “Taylorist system” that 
even reached business circles. Thus, the Taylorist system proved to be 
dysfunctional during this period as it implemented a cancellation of the 
contributions of this form of organization by the extra costs it generated. 
3.2.3.1.1. Rapid inventory of some socio-cultural causes of the 
Taylorism crisis 
The general assumption that such a presupposed approach consisted of 
expressing the idea that all of the requirements in terms of values, behaviors 
and organization, which the S.M.L (Scientific Management of Labor) 
implied, became increasingly inconsistent with the standards that, in these  
 
 
 
 

56     The Ongoing Technological System 
areas, the rest of society emits. Let us quote some of the contradictions that 
have been analyzed in this regard: 
– the growing contradiction between the growing school and cultural 
level of the working population and the low level of mental, psychological, 
intellectual and social requirements of Taylorist functions; 
– the growing contradiction between an authoritarian hierarchical 
relationship, a very prevalent and dehumanizing organization, and an 
ambient social tendency promoting the exaltation of democracy and actors 
empowerment in their immediate living and action conditions; 
– a certain “desacralization” of work strongly felt among young people 
but diversely disseminated throughout the whole of society. It had its origins 
in a specific demand for overall meaning of life, self-realization ideal, 
reinforced by the exaltation of promised material enjoyment and recreation, 
massively conducted by the consumption system and advertising 
mechanisms. 
3.2.3.1.2. The decrease in the technical effectiveness of the system, 
as a disruptive factor of labor organization 
All the reactions and malfunctions that had challenged the operation  
of the system of work organization had, in part, their origins in a kind of 
human rupture created by a considerable deterioration of working 
conditions, by a massive acceleration of working paces and workloads. 
During this period, as we have seen above, the level of work per worker 
continued to increase massively. Given that, at the same time, productivity 
increased only slightly, this shows that the increase in productivity could 
only be achieved by a considerable increase in the pressure on the pace and 
intensity of work. 
Thus, it was the collapse of the technical effectiveness of means of 
production, due to the pressure that it transferred to the pace of work, which 
somehow led the system of organization of labor to its breaking point. In this 
sense, the S.M.L. crisis proceeded from the technological systems crisis, in 
the sense that it was partly the product of this system. 
 
 

The Third Technological Revolution     57 
3.2.3.1.3. The S.M.L. crisis due to its internal limits 
The causes presented and discussed above surely have an obvious 
responsibility in the technological systems crisis, but they only had such an  
impact because the former was reaching limits that generated increasing 
entropy. 
A number of analyses have shown that the principles themselves were 
originally the strength of the Taylorist system generated, once a certain level 
of generalization and deepening was reached, complexity effects and 
exponential regulation problems. 
The exclusive object upon which the S.M.L. was based was the workflow 
and its main purpose was to isolate the unit form and to maximize the 
effectiveness. To this end, the development of a Taylorist method, over time, 
led to the multiplication of unit workflows that were extremely efficient in 
terms of performing the sequence of individual productive actions. However, 
this evolution held the worker back from a growing mass of liaison, of 
necessary ancillary functions – the achievement of the global productive 
action – supply, handling, adjustment, etc. These functions, which were 
“naturally” performed as part of less fragmented work, had at the time to be 
designed, organized and managed by specialized services, with very fine 
coherence constraints and therefore with very onerous levels of complexity 
and organizational costs. This complexity was magnified by the problem of 
time. The S.M.L. isolated and transformed productive operations that had 
different completion times. Then arose, in a very acute manner, the issue of 
the temporal regulation of the overall process [FRI 63]. 
The management of this new complexity in turn required increasingly 
complex regulatory functions with the creation of new functions, new 
services and, thus, the inflating of a tertiary industrial sector whose extra 
cost resulted in largely offsetting the savings obtained, theoretically, based 
on a greater efficiency of manufacturing operations. With the law of entropy, 
the S.M.L. was also confronted to a sort of “Parkinson” syndrome. 
The atomistic approach of the Taylorist method destroyed a set of 
spontaneous micro-regulations that it transformed into the same quantity of 
organizational problems, whose growing number created a complexity 
difficult to control. The apparent simplicity of the Taylorist approach was 
challenged by a “paradox of global quantities”, which led to entropy. Thus, 
the S.M.L. crisis was an integrating part of the technology dimension of the 
contemporary crisis, by nature, if we accept that the S.M.L. was a techno-

58     The Ongoing Technological System 
organizational method, consistent with a certain technological mode. We 
have seen how the efficiency crisis of this technical material device 
somehow puts the system of organization of work which emerged thereof in 
a state of “overvoltage”. The S.M.L. crisis provided a component specific to 
the technological crisis, bringing forward the limits of the technological 
paradigm characteristic to this period [COR 79]. 
3.2.3.2. The transformation of consumer requirements and behaviors 
Long-term economic growth has led to changes in consumption, such as 
the quantitative saturation and deformation of the structure of demand in this 
area. 
3.2.3.2.1. The slowdown in consumption 
It has been extensively studied by economists as one of the factors of the 
crisis, known in particular as “the exhaustion of the consumption standard”. 
It has two components: 
– On the one hand, there is a general saturation of the demand for 
products for individual private consumption, especially regarding durable 
and semi-durable goods. These include clothing and furnishings but 
especially home appliances and cars. These sectors, which had represented 
in post-war years and until the mid-sixties one of the driving forces of 
growth and key sectors of the production and trade apparatus, were 
confronted to a level of equipped households that nearly brought the pace of 
demand growth to that of the renewal of a nearly completely installed stock 
[LOR 80]. 
– The stabilization of individual consumption is related to the saturation 
of the need for collective equipment. This concerns first of all the household 
which, although being private, can be practically included with 
infrastructures and is in turn accompanied with collective urban amenities. It 
covers in the 1970s the major infrastructure programs, such as the massive 
programs of telephone equipment, as well as extensive road and highway 
investments that automotive consumption required. 
This point confirms, on the demand side, our previous hypothesis, 
namely that the industrial society of that period was somehow facing a 
“creativity breakdown” in its own productive and technological universe. It 
proved to be unable to renew the “system of objects” upon which it had 
based a powerful growth momentum, because it had saturated the population 
of developed countries with it (at least its broad solvent part). 

The Third Technological Revolution     59 
 
Figure 3.6. The saturation of equipped households between  
1964 and 1984 [CPE 83] 
3.2.3.2.2. The emergence of new demands regarding material 
consumption 
The saturation that we have talked about manifested itself not only by the 
rejection of buying in a situation of relative satiety, but also by refusing to 
buy just anything. From this perspective, a failure can be observed in 
addressing all the consequences of the movement which, from 1968 
onwards, assumed the somewhat naive form of the rejection of the 
“consumer society”. 
 

60     The Ongoing Technological System 
Two points persist in this area: 
– A requirement for product authenticity and differentiation. It reflects 
the end of a certain form of public acceptance of mass production. From the 
renewed taste for old things, for the “unrepeatable” to the full bloom of all 
crafts and the sometimes somewhat naive enthusiasm for “natural” things, 
signs are ever present of the rejection of this uniform and functional mass 
consumption [CAT 85] of nylon, chrome and Formica. This is seldom 
consistent with the logic of huge series upon which the former industrial 
system had based its prosperity. 
– Increased demand for technical quality and rejection of nuisances. The 
food industry has represented a fertile ground for this kind of manifestation. 
This is the requirement that, beyond apparent qualities, the proposed product 
is reliable and in particular non-hazardous. The consumer who meanwhile 
became quite curious and informed has realized that this last characteristic 
was not necessarily acquired. Hormones in meat, as well as conservatives 
and dyes, have been frequently on trial campaigns have started, such as those 
animated by the famous Vance Packard in the United States about the 
dangers of certain cars. 
This trend has become apparent in three forms: through demonstrations 
of collective defiance, ranging from mere hysteria to boycotts, the 
establishment of consumer organizations to which the generic name of 
“consumerism” has even been given, and finally, the development of public 
regulation. These three types of movements, but especially the latter, will 
result in strengthening and making more complex the technical standards 
that can be imposed on products. It can easily be seen that, while such a 
requirement may sometimes result in beneficial creativity and innovation 
effects, it will more regularly have an effect of increased costs, of decrease 
in the overall productivity and of worsening conditions for capital growth. 
3.2.3.2.3. The change in the consumption structure: moving to the 
immaterial 
This is again a phenomenon sufficiently known for us to be fairly brief on 
this point, while emphasizing the significance. 
As incomes increase, consumption shifts to the service industries. Leisure 
and health are the two engines of consumption. The explosion of services of 
all kinds in the United States shows that demand is infinite in its volume and 
its differentiation. 

The Third Technological Revolution     61 
This reorientation is thus generating three different problems: 
– a necessary reorientation of technical progress to make the productivity 
of this sector compatible with the intensity of demand and with labor costs; 
– an increase in the socialized portion of this demand, especially the 
consumption of health services. It endangers the budgets of states which had 
endorsed them as accompanying growth and that no longer know how to 
stop this exponential growth; 
– the shift of a potential tertiary demand towards free leisure and not 
work, causing the much larger problem of the relaxation of integration 
mechanisms into monetary economics. 
Therefore, the technological system that had prevailed for a century no 
longer finds opportunities for the activity for which it had created the best 
skill: the low-cost production of standardized hardware products. Consumers 
want less and less products; they want differentiated ones; they mostly want 
intangible services and sometimes prefer free leisure to consumption that 
involves paid work in exchange.

Formation of the Third Technological 
System and First Wave of the New 
Technological System 
In the 1970s, wehile the second technological system was suffering a 
crisis, after a century of major development and transformation, magnified 
by a major economic crisis and a major energy crisis, a number of 
technological disruptions occurred. Transforming the technological universe 
in a radical way1, a wave of technological breakthroughs also appeared in the 
1970s, often after a long period of maturation. These included the 
development of the microprocessor in 1971, or the early days of mastering 
genetic biology, along with the discovery of DNA and the first intervention 
techniques on the genetic chain. These technological breakthroughs 
constituted the generic technologies that structured the new technological 
system, by generating new applications, and recomposed conventional 
technologies such as metallurgy or mechanics, giving rise to new activities, 
objects, products and services [LAR 83]. 
This technological change would have transformative, productive, 
economic, scientific and organizational effects on the technological and 
economic space on a global scale. 
                                        
1 Two Nobel Prizes, in 1975 for the microprocessor and in 1976 concerning works on DNA, 
resulted from this, which are now considered the starting dates of the constitution of the third 
technological system.

64     The Ongoing Technological System 
The deployment of the new technological system, which would take 
place in a first phase of two decades from the mid-1970s until around 1995, 
will be the subject of this chapter. 
4.1. Emergence of new generic technologies 
The birth of the new technological system first of all involved the 
emergence of new generic technologies. The inventory of these large generic 
technologies constitutes the first step in characterizing the new technological 
system. Five major sectors emerged as new dominant technologies, namely 
information technologies, new materials and biotechnologies; light-based 
technology known as photonics can also be integrated as generic technology, 
and finally, energy, in which truly new technologies still remained relatively 
marginal, but where the management of a new diversity constraint is in itself 
a disruptive factor. 
 
Figure 4.1. Simplified diagram of the third technological  
system in its first phase (Author’s diagram) 
4.1.1. From computing to information technologies 
Along with its physical electronic media, computing originated in the 
previous technological system. The extraordinary developments of unit 
processing power introduced by the discovery of the microprocessor turned  
 

Formation of the Third Technological System     65 
it into a new technology, in the sense that it introduced a radical rupture from 
previous conditions. 
4.1.1.1. The microprocessor: miniaturization, power explosion and 
some of its effects 
The event that changed everything was the development of the 
microprocessor in 1971. These silicon chips, with a surface area of 1 cm2, 
were able to concentrate the processing power of several tens of thousands 
of previous transistors, close to that of a first-generation computer. Owing to 
this capability to multiply processing powers on a gigantic scale, and to 
concentrate them within a limited physical volume, this breakthrough 
actually turned electronic technology for information processing into a new 
dominant technology, by quickly enabling integration into most machines, 
and eventually transforming most technological devices. As a result, it 
opened a new technological field, to the extent that a number of 
contemporaries concentrated all the technological revolution within the 
possibilities created by this emergence of the “chip”, referring to it as a 
“microelectronic revolution” [LA 88]. 
The microprocessor initiated a process of miniaturization and exponential 
development of computer processing power, which would be formulated as 
“Moore’s law”: the processing capacity of an electronic processor doubles 
every 18 months. This development is reflected in Figure 4.2. 
This explosion in storage capacity, associated with miniaturization, 
generated the appearance of microcomputers, which underwent, after a 
proliferation of models, devices and producers, stabilization over two 
alternative technological design standards, from Apple and IBM, allowing 
for the universal dissemination of these machines between 1980 and 1990. 
This universalization of the microcomputer definitely constituted the most 
powerful movement of technological transformation of society by the third 
technological system, being at the same time its most powerful vehicle for 
dissemination [ADE 81]. 
The increase in processing power was such that it allowed for processing 
very large files in large administrations or big companies, but also  
for a whole series of new functions for information technology to  
be devised. Large computational powers enabled the implementation of  
 
 
 

66     The Ongoing Technological System 
information technology in areas which required computational solutions 
from very complex models, such as in meteorology or economic forecasting, 
sometimes in real time, including devices for spacecraft piloting or for 
controlling nuclear power plants, for addressing military situations, or for the 
adjustment of foreign exchange markets. 
 
Figure 4.2. Evolution of computer performance:  
Graphical representation of Moore’s law [DYA 84] 

Formation of the Third Technological System     67 
Applications in scientific research have now emerged with very powerful 
so-called “data analysis” methods. These methods, whose usage was 
unthinkable without the support of very strong processing powers, have 
revolutionized research in fields as diverse as epidemiology, animal ecology 
or marketing. 
Another of these revolutionary application areas, which appears among 
the most promising, is simulation, primarily complex physics simulation 
such as fluid flows or seismic analysis, or the simulation of real situations, 
such as for piloting aircrafts. It can also be employed for managing low 
occurrence, mostly undesirable, probability events such as incidents in 
nuclear power plants. 
This simulation of reality, in the strict sense of the term, is combined with 
the use of digitized image and sound. Very quickly, devices have appeared 
that can store, and possibly transform and render images or sounds by means 
of digital signals. Such devices are very greedy in terms of processing and 
memory power and, in this case, the widespread use of these processing and 
storage mechanisms depends on the multiplication of powers, which will 
condition its generalization for a long time2. 
The same path was followed by the field of what has started to be 
referred to as “artificial intelligence”, which includes both “expert systems”, 
machine translation and pattern recognition. Expert systems, whose 
development has expanded into a whole range of scientific and technical 
areas, require very large data storage capacities, since all characteristic 
events concerning the phenomenon have to be input into the machine. They 
also require a strong processing capability that allows for the implementation 
of a true revolution in software caused by the replacement of algorithmic 
programs, by programs reproducing human reasoning: “chains of 
inferences”.
                                        
2 It is this generalization of universal digitization, enabled by a given state of computing 
powers that will constitute one of the triggers of the second wave of technological 
transformation of the third technological system, at the middle of the nineties which we will 
deal with in the next chapter. 

 
 
Figure 4.3. Generic technologies and applications in the  
information processing industry [GES 86, p. 204] 
68     The Current Technological System

This increase in the units of power also enabled miniaturization. It is this 
that ultimately promoted the general dissemination of computing. It was the 
main driving engine that helped computing to come out of the large air-
conditioned rooms where the great monsters of the 1960s reigned, thus 
opening new avenues for “embedded” computing. As a result, since then, 
emergency medical technology as well as military tactics have undergone a 
complete transformation. This proliferation of computing devices, 
accompanied by an explosion of functionalities and usages, has implied that 
these systems must be massively mastered and ensured by non-professional 
users. This opened specific areas for improvement of the “user friendly” 
man–machine interaction, a field of research and development of 
conversational software functionalities, on the readability of outputs, and 
more generally on all that facilitate the speed and sustainability of learning, 
comfort and even enjoyment. 
The improvement of processing power has also required, in many cases, to 
take into account users who do not always know how to operate technology 
very well and who should be, much more than before, guided in its utilization. 
4.1.1.2. The explosion of applications: the proliferation of computer-
aided technologies 
The microprocessor has made it possible to move away from the computer 
itself and to introduce modules for information processing in most other 
technical devices, mechanical devices among others. A major aspect of the 
information technology revolution has thus consisted in the increasingly general 
control of various technical devices by an information processing system.

on the information technology [AÏT 89]

70     The Ongoing Technological System 
4.1.1.2.1. CAD 
Computer-aided design (CAD) is a field of design that has been 
transformed at two levels: at the computational level and at the design level. 
We discussed earlier the effects of considerable increases in computing 
power, which of course has had an effect on the amount and speed of 
calculations. Furthermore, it has also enabled the development of new 
computational modes; this has been the case in calculations of structures 
with the “finite elements” method, which allows for very fine calculations, 
thus generating considerable savings in terms of resources. CAD has 
completely changed design methods in engineering. These devices have 
generated savings in design: for instance, in the making of multiple physical 
models, reducing hours of wind tunnel; they also have represented 
considerable savings in terms of production and archiving plans, not to 
mention the savings in workforce that the productivity gain introduced by 
CAD/CAM/CAE represents through the direct connection of such design 
systems to manufacturing systems. 
4.1.1.2.2. Computer-integrated manufacturing 
Owing to the computer revolution, production has undergone a 
transformation not only of its devices but also of its concepts. 
This first started after the emergence of numerical control. Developed 
during the Second World War and initially existing as a cabled facility 
intended to provide machine-tools with a series of commands, this system 
would become centralized at the end of the 1960s, when machines started to 
be controlled by central control systems. The microprocessor generated 
decentralized systems, in which every machine had its own programmed 
control system. 
Another major area where digital electronics was introduced in 
production processes involved programmable logic control units. At this 
point, electronics replaced the electromagnetic relay cabinet intended to 
manage sequences of repetitive operations that did not require the use of real 
computer programming, while memory could be accessed in which loaded 
automation and microprocessor instructions are responsible for managing 
applications. Their success was then due to their robustness, which notably 
allowed for their direct use in workshop environments, as well as in their 
ability to manage a large number of inputs–outputs. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     71 
4.1.1.2.3. Robotics 
These 
two 
types 
of 
systems, 
CAD 
and 
computer-integrated 
manufacturing, were limited to the installation of programming code on 
conventional machines. The robot is another matter. Being a new machine, 
regarded as an offspring of the computer, the robot represents a direct 
replacement of human actions in production activities. Originally, they were 
simple manipulators; however, the complexity of gestures that they are 
capable to achieve has increased, as has the number of “degrees of freedom” 
similarly due to the possibilities of electronics but also to the new mechanics 
of this type of system [NEV 80]. 
The culmination of the development of information technologies in the 
production area is known as “the flexible workshop”, which manages 
manufacturing, designing, finishing, cleaning and maintenance, under the 
control of integrated systems for control transmission, production 
management as well as in designing parts and whole items. 
4.1.1.2.4. New electronic objects 
The final aspect of the revolution in microelectronics involves the 
transformation of objects. It concerns the ability to create new concepts of 
objects thanks to the introduction of electronic power and “chips”, such as in 
the case of the quartz watch, substituting mechanics by an electronic power 
and display device that transformed watch markets. The history of the pocket 
calculator is also interesting in this regard [FOS 86]. 
Quickly enough in the development of the new technological system, the 
new dominant technology would no longer be electronics, as it had been 
originally identified, but information processing in the broad sense of the 
term. It is obvious that the success of this technology has been made possible 
due to the development of electronic technology; however, a significant 
change can already be seen emerging that would emancipate information 
technology from its connection with electronics. 
4.1.1.3. An accompanying electronic technology: telecommunications 
Since the electric telegraph, the capability of transmitting information via 
long distances experienced a new revival, with the possibility of direct 
transmission of speech allowed by the invention of the telephone, and also 
by overcoming the constraint of the cord with the development of wireless 
communication, which would go on to become radio in the 1930s. 

72     The Ongoing Technological System 
Today, remote communication enjoys a series of developments in close 
relationship with information technologies of which they represent an 
important part. First is “computerization”, still called in the 1980s 
“digitalization” of telecommunications, which strengthened the organic bond 
that this area maintained with information processing and storage 
technologies. This digitalization was linked to several types of constraints: 
the technological limit encountered by electromechanical dispatching 
systems which led at the end of the 1960s to the generalization of electronic 
systems in addition to the greater speed and reliability obtained by digitally 
based transmission systems, and finally, the growing importance of data 
transmissions having a directly digital nature. 
So-called “telematics” is another intersection of information technology 
and telecommunications, which experienced extraordinary expansion, at 
least in France, already globally relayed by the contribution of space 
technology of satellite communication. 
Telecommunications are representative of contemporary technological 
developments in the sense that their function consists of transporting a 
digital abstraction, appearing as a universal support for a wide variety of 
concrete information: sound, images and data and also where they make use 
of a multitude of technological solutions, conventional cables, fiber optic, 
microwave and satellites. 
They have thus contributed to universalizing the concept of a network, to 
achieve its implantation and use, which would transform and take a new 
impetus with the Internet. 
4.1.1.4. A technology of the future: light technology 
Referred to as photonics but most commonly optronics during this period 
and optoelectronics when there is combined usage of light and the electron, 
light technology assumes an increasing significance in information 
processing technologies, and also in problems related to energy and to the 
physical transformation of matter. 
One of the areas where this optical technology has appeared is the field of 
information transmission. Transporting an increasing amount of signals by 
cable has led to the development of the optical fiber. This has enabled for 
increasing the quantity of transportable signals, but also allowed for safer 
transmission. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     73 
A technical mastery of the conservation of light within a transparent 
medium had to be acquired. This was also where optoelectronics developed 
as a technology for the transformation of light into electronic signals and 
vice versa. It is required by the need to make this optical signal usable by a 
computer in the form of an electronic signal. 
Nonetheless, information transportation and processing are only the main 
possibilities for light technology, which is also used for many other things. 
This capability to use light as a “message carrier” has been made possible by 
means of the mastery of a source, a source of ordered light, the coherent 
light which gave rise to the “laser”. However, the latter is not used for this 
purpose only, but also has a place as an investigative tool and furthermore as 
a machine for transforming matter, in the form of power laser, whose 
utilization ranges from cutting metal to medicine and dentistry, including 
warfare. Warfare has more broadly stimulated the bulk of research in 
optoelectronics and optronics, since infrared detection systems, as well as 
laser systems for guiding missiles and night vision systems using 
“concentration of light”. 
Finally, “photovoltaic” technology that enables the direct conversion of 
solar energy into electrical energy, by means of light excitation of a silicon 
plate, is an integrating part of the technology of light. This process, which 
had initially been developed as an energy technology for space activities, has 
begun to be included in massive applications into more commonly used 
energy devices: primarily for domestic supply or that of isolated facilities. 
The development of this energy technology would later be strongly 
stimulated by the deepening of the environmental constraint. 
4.1.2. The hyper choice of materials 
4.1.2.1. The nature of the mutation 
The succession of technological systems represents an increase in 
technological freedom in terms of materials, by means of the increase in 
variety of materials that successive systems have made available to 
operators, and by the growing control of their internal complexity [POU 86]. 
It is thus possible to identify three stages: from the stage of suffered 
complexity, where impurities in metals and alloys are limitations due to the 
hardiness of their development, to the stage of complexity under control, in 
which we are able to exploit to our advantage the complexity of this 

74     The Ongoing Technological System 
microstructure, to manipulate it and even to create new ones such as 
composite materials or loaded plastics. “It is tempting today to say that we 
are entering the civilization of the composite, of the ‘made on measure’ 
material perfectly satisfying the requirements of the demand”3. 
This is probably the epicenter of contemporary developments in terms of 
materials: we do not simply add to the range of available macro-materials, 
we now control interactions between molecules or atoms, which enable us to 
build the materials that we need (and we need them because we are able to 
design them). 
4.1.2.2. The composite world 
4.1.2.2.1. Composites 
The idea of a composite is relatively old and began with reinforced 
concrete, as a combination of a binder: concrete, and a metal structure. Here 
again, we come across the principle and the structure of all composite 
materials: the combination between a material – known as reinforcement – 
which can be any fiber (mainly aramid polymers, of which the most well 
known is kevlar, the most conventional: glass fibers, or the most advanced: 
carbon and boron) able to provide resistance to traction in one, two or three 
dimensions and a matrix of ductile material known as “binder” (phenolic 
resins, epoxy, imides and also ceramics and metals), which ensures the 
cohesion of components, the transmission and the distribution of constraints. 
A third product is generally essential as it is the treatment, or so-called sizing 
material, which will establish the bond between reinforcement and binder. In 
general, the development of composites requires a high level of scientific 
knowledge on the issue of the compatibility of materials. 
The main contribution of composites consists of an additive and 
sometimes multiplicative combination of characteristics, such as, for 
example, resistance to high temperatures and weight gain. In some cases, it 
results in the maximization of performance, including the elimination of the 
corresponding limitations that a conventional material used to create. This is 
the case of offshore equipment, in which composites used exhibit a 
characteristic of mechanical resistance comparable to steels, including the 
elimination of risks of corrosion. 
 
                                        
3 See [PRO 05] and [ECO 87, p. 127]. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     75 
The particular characteristics of composites are their anisotropy, that is, 
the possibility of organizing the internal structure of the material according 
to the particular structure of the constraints that the part will endure. It is 
clear that this characteristic maximizes performance, while allowing a non-
negligible gain in weight. The latter originates from the hyper specificity of 
the composite solution. A composite is designed only as a particular 
combination destined to satisfy the design of a specific part [POR 85]. 
Two types of composites have been developed with various applications. 
The first composites, namely high-performance composites, were very 
expensive materials – carbon–carbon was then 400 times more expensive 
than stainless steel for the same weight – and therefore limited to top-end 
applications: aerospace, aviation, surgical implants, etc. As for mass-market 
composites, the two major application areas are, from the outset, automotive 
and sports. 
It should be noted here how significantly the appearance of composites is 
related to the advanced state of the developing technological system, both at 
the level of the requirements that it develops towards materials, which is a 
requirement for the parallel development of several characteristics, and at the 
level of the technical possibilities that can be employed for the production 
and the use of these new materials: chemical technologies as well as 
computer technologies. 
4.1.2.2.2. From composites to composite spirit 
As a matter of fact, apart from the very important phenomenon of the 
development of composite materials that we have quickly outlined and 
classified above, it is now the concept of composite itself which tends to 
become generalized. This concept can be defined by the following 
characteristics: namely the search for the optimization of performances until 
obtaining 
instantaneously 
contradictory 
performances 
through 
the 
combination of heterogeneous materials, and using combination techniques 
without intimate fusion of present materials. 
4.1.2.3. The vitality of plastics 
A first spectacular change has been observed in the field of plastics, with 
a new development of their market along with a new response capacity to 
high and various constraints: namely corrosion inhibition or resistance  
to chemical aggressions, etc. The first resulted in the generalization of 
plastics in automotive bumpers, and the second in the development  
 

76     The Ongoing Technological System 
of fluorinated plastics; these materials have been all the more popularized 
through the well-known material Teflon, also used for its low friction 
coefficient. 
When good thermal resistance is added to these qualities, allowing high-
temperature sterilization, certain plastics can compete with glass in some 
medical applications. Some elements necessary to this activity, which have 
been made in polyester sulfone, prove resistant to radiation, to contact with 
ethylene oxide, up to a temperature of 190°C and a pressure of 25 bars. 
Another amazing development in plastics redefines boundaries believed 
to be consubstantial with this type of material: those of insulation 
characteristics. Some plastics – such as polyacetylene – have the property of 
electric conductivity, to the extent that it is now possible to consider 
designing batteries made of plastic, but this property could even drive up to 
superconductivity. 
From these developments, a number of techno-economic consequences 
follow: namely, a new material–structure interaction, since materials are now 
“built” according to a part structure, conversely to what had been done until 
then. A strong interaction with information also results thereof (a material 
becomes in turn a conceptual solution), a great flexibility in product design, 
a shortening of production phases, since certain transformation phases of the 
material are integrated into its design itself and a change in formation, 
transformation and repair methods. 
4.1.3. Biotechnologies 
These have regularly been the focus of attention, as a result of a number 
of “chimeras” being created, such as new vegetables or unknown animals, 
also as a result of specific cloning or in vitro fertilization medical 
experiments. Biotechnologies are most often identified by the general public 
as genetic engineering, and in an even more restrictive manner, to what some 
may refer to using the unfortunate expression “genetic manipulation”. The 
reason is that they are part of a certain technical sensationalism. 
Yet biotechnologies are ancient practices. One of the oldest technologies, 
fermentation, still constitutes the most important form of biotechnology: 
bread, wine, beer, cheese, yogurt, sake, nuoc-mam, etc.; the list of basic 
staples that all civilizations derive from the mastery of this technology would 
be extensive. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     77 
4.1.3.1. Biotechnology: concept unity 
Biotechnology can easily be defined by two elements: life, which 
distinguishes it from all the other technologies based on the manipulation of 
inert elements and the infinitely small, which precisely distinguishes it from 
more traditional technology related to living organisms: agriculture and 
rearing. It is the latter that explains that, while the use of certain forms of 
biotechnology can date very far back in time, microorganisms that were at its 
origin had only been identified in the middle of the 17th Century by 
Leuvenhoek, giving rise to what would mature two centuries later with 
“Pasteurian” biology. Therefrom, it then follows for its progress, a deep and 
permanent relationship with basic sciences such as biology, biochemistry, 
microbiology, enzymology and genetics. 
This unity is reflected by the capability to qualify biotechnology based on 
an overall definition, extracted from “Les promesses de la bio-industrie”, a 
report to the French Economic and Social Council of January 1983: 
“Biotechnologies include techniques that make use of the potentials of 
microorganisms, that is, of plants or animal cells or of derived biochemically 
active fragments”. The field of biotechnology represents the heart of a 
complete chain, from biosciences to bio-industry. 
4.1.3.2. Biotechnologies: products and processes diversity 
Biotechnologies basically include three major types of processes whose 
emergence correspond to a certain state of science, or for the last two, to 
scientific breakthroughs that have suddenly opened a new field of industrial 
applications [PAD 85]. 
The first has already been mentioned, because historically, it is the oldest: 
this concerns fermentation engineering, which despite significant advances 
is still classified as first-generation bio-industry. Owing to its age, it is the 
field of biotechnology that yielded the highest number of applications and 
which has had the widest impact on economic and daily life. 
Fermentation has helped biotechnologies to recently develop themselves 
in two specific areas: by refining metals by means of bioleaching, which is a 
method for mineral biological leaching, and by providing a means to 
enhance poor minerals or residues from mining extractions. In the United 
States, about 15% of the total production of copper was obtained in the early 
1980s through this biological mechanism and the disposal of waste by the 
use of fermentation in sewage water treatment plants, as well as for the 
treatment of agricultural, urban and industrial wastes. 

78     The Ongoing Technological System 
Fermentation engineering experienced a new lease on life in its 
traditional areas of application, agriculture and agri-food. In agriculture, this 
technique allows, for example, for the manufacturing of bio-insecticides, 
through the selection and the culturing of bacteria that produce toxins having 
selective effects on insects. Thus, the insecticidal bacterium Bacillus 
thuringiensis (BT) produces a crystal that, inside the intestine of certain 
insects, disrupts digestive functions, to the extent that the insects stop eating 
and quickly die. Another technique enables the development of bacteria that 
fix nitrogen from the air. If associated with plants, they can advantageously 
replace fertilizers in fertilization. 
Fermentation engineering also makes it possible to use the biochemical 
principle of certain microorganisms. This is the principle itself of antibiotics: 
microbes develop chemical compounds, which are toxic to other microbes 
only. It is used for the production of enzymes, which establishes the 
connection with another area of biotechnology. 
Second-generation bio-industry involves not only more elaborated forms 
of fermentation engineering, but also the process of coupling a biological 
action with a chemical reaction by means of a particular microorganism, 
whose main role is that of a powerful catalyst: the enzyme. For this reason, 
second-generation bio-industry and enzyme engineering are assimilated. 
4.1.3.2.1. Enzyme engineering 
In 1897, Büchner showed that by grinding the yeast of beer, a liquid 
devoid of cells could be extracted, but which was nonetheless still capable of 
fermenting sweet juice. The enzyme was isolated and the principle of its 
industrial use drafted. Enzymes are large proteins that perform catalytic 
functions; in other words, they are able to significantly speed up a 
spontaneous chemical reaction or to trigger a chemical reaction that could 
not have occurred without their presence. Their power is extraordinary 
because they are capable of magnifying a reaction several million times. 
Enzyme engineering consists of “putting enzymes to work” outside of living 
cells that gave them life. Therefore, 30 grams of amylase can turn 60 tons of 
starch into sugar. 
As enzymes are hyper-specialized, they prove to be powerful and also 
capable of extraordinary precision; thus, an enzyme can be so specialized 
that it only knows how to cut one type of bond between atoms within a 
molecule. Enzyme engineering also has an advantage in terms of economy, 
since enzymes can be used to obtain, at temperatures between 30°C and 

Formation of the Third Technological System     79 
70°C, reactions whose scope would have otherwise required considerable 
energy expenditures, using conventional chemical methods. 
Any living organism is an extraordinary chemical plant, and therefore, 
the variety of enzymes is considerable. More than 2,000 enzymes have been 
identified, but only 20 have been used in industrial applications. Two main 
obstacles explain the difficulty of this development. The first relates to the 
vast extent of this area, because each microorganism has thousands of 
enzymes and, for this reason, the extraction of a particular enzyme is not 
easy. The second obstacle concerns the relative fragility of enzymes, having 
a low tolerance to temperature variations and a characteristic that maintains 
their effectiveness only if their physical configuration is retained. If the 
spatial form of an enzyme is modified, its action may in turn be altered, if 
not canceled. This is the reason why one of the main areas of research is the 
“fixation” of enzymes on a medium, such as to avoid their physical alteration 
and so that they can be recovered for new uses, mainly because they are 
expensive and impossible to recover in a liquid solution. 
Enzyme engineering is employed in the food industry for the production 
of various sugars – glucose, fructose, etc. – from various substrates – starch, 
cellulose, lactose, etc. – and for the production of proteins, such as lactose. 
Enzyme engineering is at the heart of biotechnology, since enzymes are 
most often originating from microbial cultures, that is, from fermentation 
engineering; enzymes are in turn able to magnify or regulate fermentation. 
The effectiveness of the production of enzymes depends greatly on advances 
in genetic engineering. 
4.1.3.2.2. Genetic engineering 
Third-generation biotechnology – genetic engineering – is deeply bound, 
in its establishment, if not in its emergence, to a fundamental discovery in 
the 1970s: the genetic code and its support, i.e. the DNA/RNA system. 
Biotechnology has always required microorganisms that possessed specific 
characters, since the goal was to make them accomplish what they could not 
under natural conditions. These factors are obtained through selection. The 
novelty introduced by genetic engineering consists in our ability to achieve 
this specific result through the lasting insertion of a character, of a particular 
instruction in the genetic code of an organism. 
 

80     The Ongoing Technological System 
Genetic engineering brings together two main techniques: genetic 
recombination and cell fusion. The latter involves the merging of two 
individuals’ genes, as in conventional fertilization, however, reaching far 
beyond the natural barriers of species. It is this particular technique that has 
yielded famous chimeras such as the pomato, which is a hybridization of 
tomato and potato, or sheep-goats, recently developed in laboratories. The 
full limitless power of hybridization is thus accessible to humanity. More 
specifically, it is the potential to develop very specific antibodies with 
monoclonal antibodies: namely hybridization between an antibody carrier 
cell and a cancerous cell that ensures its reproduction. 
Another technology of genetic engineering is still more widespread, 
genetic recomposition in vitro, commonly called “genetic manipulation”. 
The operation involves, through the introduction of additional information 
about the DNA, infusing individual cells having one or more additional 
properties. In this manner, it is thus possible that essential hormones be 
produced by bacteria, such as interferon, a powerful immunizing agent 
against cancer and infections, or the well-known insulin, indispensable for 
diabetic people and that was previously obtained by extracting it from a 
pig’s pancreas. 
Still at the laboratory technology stage at the time of the emergence of 
the third technological system, the range of potential applications for genetic 
engineering is tremendous, at the measure of the power that knowledge gives 
to humans on the reproduction mechanism itself, at the measure also of the 
fears that it arouses. As an example of diversity, let us consider: the direct 
development of food proteins by cell culture, the biological fixation of plant 
nitrogen which can be used instead of fertilizers, the biological 
transformation of solar energy, etc. 
As the series of examples above indicates, the list of areas in which 
biotechnology is involved – or may be involved – is impressive, which 
includes: agriculture, agri-food, health, energy, new areas in pollution and 
waste treatment, chemical industries and even metallurgy. 
Biotechnology clearly represents the very close connection between 
science and technology. They help develop a logic of the system because 
their principle of operation, by nature, is based on reproducible raw 
materials, those of life, and thereby, are energy efficient [LA 87]. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     81 
4.1.4. Energy: originality in diversity 
If the previous technological system did not disappear because of energy, it 
has presented all symptoms between 1974 and 1981, that it had been killed by 
energy. In any case, what had died was the single-source energetic solution, at 
least as the largely dominating primary energy source, a role that oil was 
assuming during the last period. However, the dream did not vanish, that of 
finding a new source of inexhaustible energy as an alternative to oil, upon 
which humanity could rely for decades. Nuclear power has played this role for 
some time, violently contested by the supporters of renewable energies. 
4.1.4.1. The issue of hydrocarbons 
This has resulted today in finding the multi-energy solution that probably 
emerges as a mode for sustainable operation. As in other areas, a 
phenomenon of abstraction can be observed in which the problem to be 
solved is that of energy, free from a single material solution; this problem 
can be solved by means of multiple solutions adapted to situations and 
specific requirements. This is not exclusive of the expectation that through 
research new “inexhaustible” mass sources of energy, such as nuclear fusion, 
will be found. Presumably, it may be wise to consider that for some time 
there will be not a unique solution but several solutions to energy 
requirements, which will remain diverse and adapted. 
 
Figure 4.5. Types of alternatives to oil [LAR 83, p. 71] 

82     The Ongoing Technological System 
From the experience acquired during the seventies, it has been shown that 
oil – and hydrocarbons in a more general way – still have a durable and 
strong energy role, in particular due to the fact that they were irreplaceable 
in a number of uses: automotive and domestic heating among others. At 
some point, expectations that hydrogen or electric propulsion would replace 
conventional automotive propulsion proved that the former were confronted 
to still unsolved technical issues. On the other hand, the continued 
importance of hydrocarbons has generated, along with a system of high 
costs, a massive technological development between off-shore and EOR 
(enhanced oil recovery). This importance of hydrocarbons in the world 
energy balance was sensitive to the volatility of oil prices during the three 
last decades. 
4.1.4.2. Alternative energy technologies originated from the oil shock 
Nuclear power assumed an important role in the energy balances of 
various developed countries, without actually becoming the ultimate energy 
source that so many expected. 
Nuclear power, in its current fission form, remains a potentially 
dangerous industry, thus generating social resistance. The great expectation 
lies then in mastering controlled fusion, which requires significant  
scientific resources but still remains an expectation, for the middle  
of the 21st Century. 
The threat to oil has given its value back to a declining fossil energy 
source: coal. Nonetheless, the huge variation in relative prices has not 
eradicated the technical reasons that had caused its decline in face of 
hydrocarbons: namely its solid, cumbersome and dirty characters. In the 
future, coal will be, in addition, limited by its characteristics of high 
production of CO2 and particles, incompatible with new environmental 
requirements. 
The expectation at the moment lies in the possibility of transforming this 
fossil material that remains by far the most abundant in liquid or gas form. 
Advances in carbochemistry are expected, and in the long run, in greater 
depth in-situ gasification, so as to see coal becoming a major source of 
energy again. 
 

Formation of the Third Technological System     83 
Another paradoxical energy resource exists: energy efficiency. As a 
response to the increase in oil price, it has become an integral part of 
designing consumption objects, in engine performance, weight gains, 
improving car aerodynamics, in addition to integrating industrial processes 
that thus slowly eliminate processes too greedy in terms of energy. This 
energy saving can be implemented by means of recovering waste energy 
from effluents, along with the use of heat pumps. Such devices increase the 
profitability of overall facilities. 
A whole range of possible renewable energy sources has been mentioned: 
wind energy, geothermal energy and the use of biomass in order to produce 
gas or alcohol and even tidal energy. The development of these sources of 
energy has been very limited, because either the deposits are scarce, its 
energy production is very irregular, or, finally, because their implementation 
faces too many technical problems and thus lacks reliability. 
Nevertheless, solar energy occupies a very special place. Whether the 
direct use of the sun as heat meets the same limitations as other forms of 
renewable energy, the same cannot be said of its photovoltaic form, which 
consists of directly transforming solar energy into electric energy, first, 
because this process has provided quite reliable technical solutions for small 
isolated installations or for supplying power to calculators. 
The four large technology areas that form the pillars of the new 
technological system suggest a name that could be used to refer to it, namely 
I.P.B.M. (Information, Poly materials, Biotechnologies, Multi-energy). Their 
implementation and the links between them is a dimension of its constitution 
as a system. This is not the only dimension of this technological transition, 
traditional technologies are themselves also included in this network of links 
and regenerated by this “new norm” technology. At the same time as this 
network establishes itself, the lines and the specific characteristics of this 
technological system that is taking place become apparent. 
4.2. The structuring of the new technological system 
The implementation of the new technological system cannot be reduced 
to the formation of large generic technologies; it becomes tangible through 
the network of relationships that is established within these generic  
 
 
 

84     The Ongoing Technological System 
technologies and also between them, and even more through the slow 
generation of applications, functions, objects and new systems. This 
deployment of the technology system also takes place, mostly due to the 
recomposition of traditional technologies. 
 
Figure 4.6. The network of inter-technological  
relationships in the new technological system [AÏT 89] 
4.2.1. The formation of the technological network 
4.2.1.1. The increasing interaction both within and between generic 
technologies 
Intra-technological cohesion increases, often in the form of an 
amplification loop, during the course of its deployment; therefore, the 
increase in computational power in computers has been used to calculate 
increasingly complex architectures which will in turn contribute to increases 
in power. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     85 
A similar process operates between generic technologies because they 
interact in common applications. In order to remain within the same kind of 
examples, this evolution can be illustrated by the electronics/materials 
relationship: the level of miniaturization of electronic components depends 
on the precision in processing materials (mastery of not only materials such 
as indium sulfide, but also thin film technology), which has thus a feedback 
effect on the quality and the power of these components. 
4.2.1.2. The recomposition of traditional technologies 
New generic technologies do not fill the whole of the space of the new 
technological system. They do not eliminate conventional technologies, here 
mechanics, chemistry, electricity, etc., but regenerate them by enhancing 
them, combining them with new technological devices. They operate this 
transformation, through competition, by compelling old technologies to 
regenerate themselves based on new scientific breakthroughs, as in the case 
of steels and alloys, or by means of new technological combinations between 
ancient and modern technology, as in the case of mechatronics, or of 
mechanics with new materials. 
This transformation can be achieved by the new means of computerized 
design such as CAD and finite elements computations. These design 
methods allow new solutions to be produced in terms of structure, form, 
saving weight and making the optimization of these complex objects 
possible. 
It may also concern new objects with renewed functions, structures and 
forms contributing to reconfigure the old technology. Just as mechanics, 
during the second technological system, was structured around rotating 
machines, modern mechanics is transformed due to the need to adapt itself to 
the problem of robots. Consequently, it must conceive kinetic configurations 
much closer to the movements of the human body. This system must be able 
to perform complex movements, with several degrees of freedom, 
cantilevered, thus requiring the development of complex articulations. This 
type of machine must adapt to the discontinuous nature of the movement due 
to the high torques that the action of the robot causes when suddenly starting 
and stopping. Thus, new functions and new machine concepts generate 
major changes in operation, motion transmission and overall architecture 
which transform mechanics as a renewed technology.

4.2.1.3. The generation of objects and new devices 
One of the interaction movements is the generation of new systems and 
products resulting from new technologies shifting towards applications. 
Some, such as the multitude of electronic and computerized systems and 
objects, may originate from a major generic technology. Others can be 
objects originating from the coming together of new technologies, such as 
gliding sports objects, windsurfing, delta-planes and ultralight aviation, 
which were created in the 1980s, mainly due to ultralight materials and 
CAD. 
These systems and objects issued from the union of new technologies 
will thus replace conventional devices by performing and improving the 
functions of these systems, such as scanners and MRI substituting 
conventional radiography. 
4.2.1.4. Access to new environments  
This is the characteristic of a new technological system, to provide access 
to new environments. “Only properly invented objects that, in order to be 
viable, require an associated environment; they cannot be created one part at 
a time during the phases of a successive development because they can exist 
only as a whole or not at all” by referring to the environment of extreme 
technologies4. Just as the second technological revolution made access to 
flights and to the underwater world possible, the third technological system 
has allowed the beginning, or at least the confirmation of human activity in 
space, as well as the ability for deep underwater submarine action. 
The first access to these two environments had been initiated in the fifties 
with what has been referred to as “space exploration”. However, this access 
had been restricted, until the exploration of the Moon in 1969, to an 
exploratory activity in the proximity of our planet. The third technological 
system enables a development of this activity with the long-term presence of 
humans in space, in reliable facilities including the safe return to earth. 
Similarly, underwater activity had begun in the early 1900s with the 
submarine and the diving bell, but this activity remained limited for most of 
it in the order of 100 m in depth. In the 1980s, new technical systems 
allowed diving and working up to a depth of 500 m. 
 
                                        
4 [SIM 69, p. 57]. 

88     The Ongoing Technological System 
The access to such limits has required the mastering of extreme 
temperatures to which a spacecraft is subjected to upon its return into the 
atmosphere, as well as the living conditions at great depths or in zero 
gravity. These technical devices must implement the technological 
capabilities provided by new generic technologies, which are informational 
for designing then for management, those from obtaining the reliability 
required by such systems, namely of materials to withstand the extreme 
conditions of these activities and of mastering human biology to adjust the 
capacities of human survival in these environments at their boundaries. The 
intrusion of these boundary areas implies systems in perfect internal 
coherence between their different technological components, at a common 
performance level. The Challenger shuttle disaster in 1986, whose origin had 
appeared to be the failure of a simple rubber tank seal, shows that all the 
techniques implemented in these extreme activities are subject to the same 
degree of perfection and technical reliability, including apparently simpler 
components and as more technical ones. 
The development of new extreme activities through a new technological 
system, demonstrating the possibilities of new technologies implemented to 
achieve it, embodies the cohesion of the systems that they form, to perform 
these functions and the common performance requirement that they 
generate. 
4.3. Societal and epistemological transformation 
4.3.1. A technical and economic transformation 
4.3.1.1. From the product to the function 
Characteristic of the new logic of the new technological system: the 
function outweighs the object. The growing complexity of technical objects 
leads to a high complexity of functions carried out, which results in not 
being necessarily satisfied or fully realized by the satisfactory functioning of 
the supporting system. This trend is magnified, through interrelation with the 
previous, by the increase in end-user requirements and reinforced by the 
competition that takes place with these emerging and developing functions. 
In addition, the complexity of these hardware systems implies that their sales 
and their usages must often be supported by complementary services. A 
concept of functionality then becomes autonomous and prevails on the 
device that implements it, whether it is a hardware device or a living service 
activity. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     89 
The role of information technologies, precisely dedicated to the 
automation of this service dimension, implies that this function dimension be 
identified and formalized through the implementation of software. 
4.3.1.2. A new way of producing 
Technological change has transformed the nature of products, from their 
components, materials and renewed assembly modes. They have deeply 
transformed the technical cycles of production, of CAD-based design, and 
also its integration with automated production processes, through 
CAD/CAM/CAE and flexible workshops. These physical processes are built 
around new modes of management of the life cycle of the product, such as 
“Just In Time” methods of integrated logistics, resulting from an already 
largely computerized management. The process chain has become integrated 
under the provision of information technologies. 
 
Figure 4.8. The new production logic 

90     The Ongoing Technological System 
This new bundle of processes and control devices integrates to meet new 
requirements, namely products with growing diversity and rapid renewal. 
This corresponds to an evolution in user-customer requirements, for 
diversity, specificity and quality, to flexibility requirements, in order to 
produce low-cost and high-quality products in short scalable series. 
The rupture with the production logic of standardized mass, of a 
repetitive production unit following a Taylorian organization, is then 
consumed. 
4.3.1.3. A new logic of the system, the replacement of material and 
energy by information 
We are probably facing a key characteristic of the new technological 
system. It follows the logic of substituting information to matter or energy. 
This represents a radical break with the previous systems that followed the 
logic of substituting artificial energy to human strength, by means of a 
material transformation. 
This logic has an historical origin, the big energy crisis of the 1970s, 
which itself showed the limitations of previous systems in their use of 
energy and matter. The “Meadows Report” on the limits of growth  
[MEA 72] has thereof been a global and explicit expression. 
This tendency is registered in the nature itself of the new technological 
system since new technologies are primarily information-based technologies, 
whether concerning, by nature, information technologies, but also 
biotechnologies. 
There are numerous implementation examples of this new logic. In the 
case of information technologies, this is reflected namely through the 
implementation of motor electronic controls on cars that permanently 
optimize its operation and thus reduce energy consumption. At the structural 
level, the action of computer-based design technologies such as finite 
element computational methods have allowed, for example, to reduce the 
thickness of plastic bottles of mineral water, thus generating considerable 
savings in terms of material. Using simulation in design is providing means 
for savings in the material production of models, prototypes and multiple 
material tests, for example, contributing to considerably reduce the wind 
tunnel testing time for aeronautical and space vehicles. Simulation has  
 

Formation of the Third Technological System     91 
comparable effects on learning, especially for piloting aircrafts, thus in being 
able to considerably limit expensive flying lessons. 
This substitution can be found in the field of new materials where the 
existence and the possibility for industrial use of materials tailored exactly to 
the functions to achieve and to their constraints constitute, through this 
optimization, a saving of material and energy. Still more obviously, this is 
also a characteristic of organic devices, which make use of the specific 
energy of life, for replacing transformation processes based on strength, heat 
and pressure. 
4.3.2. A scientific and epistemological transformation 
4.3.2.1. New technological context and scientific revolution 
The context and technological imperatives generated by the third 
technological revolution are clearly disruptive with those of previous 
periods. In general, the purpose is therefore to act less directly on material 
and inert natures, which implies a dominant activity focused on the 
understanding of the laws of this nature, to design devices and machines that 
can transform it. The major trend generated by technological change is then 
to design and control transformation devices, organized by information, and 
designed and regulated by humans, as in the case of computerized devices, 
or more autonomous ones, as in the case of biological devices. The concern 
is thus to develop mechanisms for transforming nature directly controlled by 
complex self-organizing “media” and possessing their own operational logic 
which needs to be adjusted to the purposes driving the engineering of such 
devices. 
Subsequently, the areas to which the new system technology has given 
access, such as life, complex information and the devices that are being 
manipulated, namely supercomputers, genetics, space exploration, extreme 
marine activities, etc., all require a change in scientific paradigm [KUH 62]. 
4.3.2.2. Framework and component of the new science 
4.3.2.2.1. Shift of dominant sciences and disciplinary boundaries 
One of the manifestations of this scientific revolution has been reflected 
in the shift from the centers of interest of society towards new disciplines. 
The ancient sciences related to matters such as physics and chemistry, the  
 

92     The Ongoing Technological System 
logical deductive modes of reasoning or of traditional mathematical 
formalization, have lost their reference functions of the entire scientific field. 
They have been dethroned by information sciences, quantum and high-
energy physics, biology, cognitive science and neuroscience. 
At the same time, the limits and boundaries of traditional scientific 
disciplines have been noticeably challenged by new interdisciplinary 
crossbreedings, consistent with new technological recompositions: chemistry 
and biology, electronics and optics, neurology and information theory, etc. 
However, these new reconfigurations have led to wider effects resulting 
in building a new epistemology, a new approach to reality, a new 
representation of the world and a new understanding of knowledge 
constituting the new paradigm. 
4.3.2.2.2. The complexity and systemic design approach 
This concept, which started emerging after the Second World War [BER 
73], has introduced a radical disruption with regards to Cartesian–Newtonian 
science. It has provided a means for a global understanding of the world as 
an ordered system and for the formalization of its complexity by allowing 
for the monitoring of its dynamics [FOR 61], and, for example, immediately 
providing an efficient mechanism for simulation sciences [CAN 09]. 
It combines with self-organizational models promoted by life sciences, 
which have led, since the 1970s, to challenging the sharp separation between 
order and disorder, the research on “order through noise” and the capability 
for modeling seemingly erratic phenomena by the new approach of 
“deterministic chaos”. This scientific paradigm becomes complete with two 
challenges, on the one hand, represented by the thermodynamic reversibility 
paradigm questioned in the 1980s through an approach of irreversibility 
more consistent with life sciences [PRI 86], and on the other hand, through 
the ending of the “objective world”, with the introduction of the observer’s 
point of view and the idea that reality can be approached only through a set 
of convergent perspectives [CAP 81]. 
This questioning of the scientific view of a material world is also 
reflected by the interest shown in the process of thought generation, from the 
analysis of both the functioning of the brain and the organization of 
knowledge and ways of learning. These investigations are obviously not 
unrelated to the concerns about the automation of thought, the extraction and 
storage of knowledge initially developed as “expert systems”. 

Formation of the Third Technological System     93 
Therefore, this change of paradigm consists of a renewed manner of 
expressing scientific problems and in a transformation of the conceptual 
apparatus which will be in accordance with the technological paradigm that 
is taking place [DOS 82]. This change has a much wider scope due to a 
much more general transformation of representations, through which people 
in the broadest sense of the term represent the world, science and 
technology, preparing it to accompany the current technology movement. 
Since the great crisis of 1975, which created the conditions for the 
transformation between the two technological systems, a coherent movement 
of the implementation of new generic technologies, of the reconfiguration it 
brought of previous traditional technologies, has led to developing a great 
amount of applications. This development has completely renewed not only 
the production and consumption worlds, but also our way of understanding 
and transforming the world; all these factors constituted a powerful wave of 
transformation throughout the 1990s. 
Halfway during its course, qualitative leaps largely related to Moore’s 
law triggered a bifurcation initiating a second major wave of innovation of 
the third technological system.

The Second Wave of the  
Third Technological System 
As early as the mid-1990s, the contemporary technological system 
underwent 
powerful 
transformations, 
which 
have 
generated 
an 
unprecedented movement of innovations due to their number and scale, a 
movement that still lasts. 
This innovation movement is based on four components. First, it is driven 
by the performance growth of the main generic technologies, Information and 
Communication technologies (ICT), materials and photonics. It is significantly 
enhanced by convergence and technological recombination phenomena related 
to the maturity reached by the technological system, particularly in the field of 
information technology. This convergence extends to other generic 
technologies, allowing for the emergence of a large amount of new technical 
systems, products and services that implement this innovation movement. The 
transformation of the system is amplified by a renewal and technological 
diversification 
movement, 
particularly 
in 
the 
energy 
field, 
called 
environmental transition. It has been brought about by the threat of global 
warming, which has also become apparent since the 1990s. 
This technological change is so massive that it has led to a number of 
observers investigating its nature to speak of a third industrial revolution 
currently taking place [RIF 12]. Another observer analyzed and described 
what he refers to as the fourth industrial revolution [SCH 17]. Furthermore, 
two research leaders from MIT described and analyzed this technological 
shift in its predominant “digital” field, in what they think is a secular 
mutation of human technology. They called it the “Second Machine Age” 
[BRY 14].

96     The Ongoing Technological System 
In this chapter, we will analyze what we call the second wave of the third 
technological system before reflecting on the intensity of the disruption that 
it introduces in the organization and the technological movement, and as a 
result on the nature of this bifurcation.

5.1.1. 
Continuation 
of 
the 
development 
of 
information 
technology 
5.1.1.1. The second phase of exponential growth of computing power 
The first development phase of the third technological system has been 
described as a “microelectronics revolution”. Since then, it has experienced 
continuous growth in processing power within a steady miniaturization 
trend. This trend has been designated “Moore’s law”, which formalizes the 
relationship mentioned above: the number of transistors contained in circuits 
doubles every 18 months, at constant prices. A symmetrical formulation 
presents it in terms of performance: the power of computer chips doubles 
every 18 months. This means that the increase in computer performance is 
governed by an exponential law that has now reached gigantic development 
capabilities1. 
5.1.1.2. The continued search for power in information technology: 
the nanoelectronics era 
Nonetheless, it appears that this movement, which has structured the 
evolution of electronic components for 50 years, is about to reach its limits. 
These are mainly performance limits related to the dimensional boundaries 
of its tendency for miniaturization, today reaching the nanometer level 
(approximately 28 nm). This dimensional level generates malfunctions in 
operating processes, related to the quantitative limits of the trajectory of the 
electron and to a critical heat concentration related to the very high density 
of the components. Cooling devices are becoming the sizing factor of 
computer systems [COL 02]. 
 
                                        
1 What Brij refers to as “the second part of the chessboard”. 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     97 
The progress movement in the field of microelectronics mainly focuses 
on exceeding that number of limits; this is a movement known as “More than 
Moore”. It concerns new architectures for positioning transistors in 3D 
integration in order to minimize the area that they occupy and thus to reduce 
leakage currents. The emerging technology of this FINFET principle is 
currently being developed by Samsung and Global Foundries. 
Another modification at the architectural level consists of “integrating 
new heterogeneous nano-components on a chip: microprocessors, 
microsensors, 
static 
and 
dynamic 
memories, 
electro-mechanical 
microsystems, radioelectric interfaces or optoelectronic components to 
enhance circuit functions, manage their increasing complexity and enable 
them to adapt to their environment”2. 
This research focusing on overcoming boundaries also relies on 
substituting conventional engraving technology, namely photolithography, 
which itself has an operational limit of approximately 10 nm, with the 
process known as extreme UV; however, no prospects indicate that it will be 
possible to go below the 28 nm threshold, which would show a slowdown of 
Moore’s law. Here follow the innovations still under development to extend 
the boundaries of what have become nanoelectronics. 
The level of complexity of the development of these new technological 
pathways, their risky characteristics, drives research for a much more radical 
development in nanoelectronics. 
This limit in electronic information processing technology obviously 
constitutes the blocking threshold, which Hughes referred to as “reverse 
salient” [HUG 87, p. 73] and which is likely to lead to a major shift within 
this generic technology, being the most central of the current system and 
which could validate the notion of the advent of a new technological 
revolution. 
5.1.2. The second age of materials 
For any technological system, materials constitute a major generic 
technology. It is therefore the specific nature of materials over a period that  
 
 
                                        
2 [MIN 16, p. 596]. 

98     The Ongoing Technological System 
characterizes a technological system and that contributes for a large part to 
its potential of innovation. It is their evolution to a large extent that 
conditions the overall technical progress. 
Beyond traditional materials that are being continuously produced, 
ranging from steel and conventional polymers to Portland cement, the 
technological transformation around 1975 initiated a new era for materials, 
especially with the “composite paradigm” as well as with the innovative 
response of metallic materials, superalloys in particular, but also of ceramics 
and carbon-based materials. These bases have contributed to generating a 
wave of new materials designated today as high-performance materials 
which are mechanical, thermal and corrosion resistant [GAY 15], that is, 
composites materials whose applications have been extended to space, 
aeronautics and automotive and wind power technologies. 
A new class of functional materials, active materials, are materials that 
develop active functions, antibacterial, de-polluting and self-cleaning, with 
the ability to convert one form of energy into another such as piezoelectric 
materials. A variant of these materials based on nanotechnologies has been 
developed with nano-powders, nano-carbons and nano-fibers, as well as 
based on thin-film technology [CAR 14]. 
These advanced materials, originating from the development of metal 
alloys, from the fields of polymers, ceramics and composites and whose 
dynamic began at the start of the third technological system are also bringing 
a new wave of innovation. Furthermore, it involves the whole productive 
system and supports its innovation: more precisely, luminous textiles and 
phase-change materials for homes, composites for parts with a large demand 
for aeronautics or lighter vehicles and biocompatible materials constituting 
implants in the field of health care. 
An intense technological movement is again supported and stimulated by 
a constant flow of new high-performance materials, able to satisfy great 
functional diversity. 
5.1.3. Development of photonics 
Photonics is the technology of generation, processing, conversion and 
transmission of light, which began to be developed in the 1970s on the basis 
of three major devices: optical fibers for information transmission by light, 
lasers and the photovoltaic conversion process of solar energy. 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     99 
5.1.3.1. Laser technology 
These generic technologies described in the first phase of the 
contemporary 
technological 
system 
have 
experienced 
important 
development and progress. A considerable development in laser technology 
has resulted from the first phase of the third technological system in the 
widespread technological dissemination through multiple applications of 
telemetry, industrial cutting and surgical action as well as involving the 
reading of signals in sound and image technology [BRE 16]. 
5.1.3.2. Sensors 
The second largest dissemination area is that of sensors, where the CCD 
sensor, which has revolutionized the field of photography, ought to be 
mentioned; it has enabled the replacement of the silver-based photographic 
medium by the digital sensor, which is nowadays a generalized process. 
Photonics has invested in the area of imagers that modify vision, such as 
zoom lenses, microscopy or telescopes, with the development of lens-less 
devices coupling diode and electronic sensors. 
The newest and most widespread breakthrough in photonics technology 
has involved the development of light technology by means of light-emitting 
diodes, which generate light through the activation of a semiconductor. This 
process is becoming pervasive in luminous devices because of its lifespan 
and energy-savings [ZUP 11]. 
Light technologies, which occupied a restricted niche within generic 
technologies during the early days of the contemporary technological 
system, have become an important technological part of the system by 
investing in wide activity areas and transforming whole sectors of activity 
such as photography and lighting. 
5.1.4. The rise of biology 
The third technological revolution began with the development of a new 
biology based on genetics. As we have previously seen, during the first 
phase of the third technological system, it underwent limited development 
only, probably due to not only the difficulties in accessing the nanometer 
level that is required by operating technologies in this area, but also ethical,  
 

100     The Ongoing Technological System 
cultural and social reluctance facing the development of what has been 
referred to as “genetic manipulations”. 
The effective development of a new generation of genetics-based 
biological technologies has first focused on a multi-dimensional analytical 
technology of biological systems called metaomics. This technology allows 
us to understand complex biological systems in their entirety and their 
dynamics. It includes four analytical techniques: the analysis of genome 
sequencing, the so-called transcriptomic RNA analysis, the analysis of the 
so-called proteomic proteins and metabolic analysis known as metabolomics. 
The first three result in characterizing the expression of genes, and 
metabolomics is a means to identify biomarkers through the simultaneous 
analysis of a large number of metabolites (sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, 
etc.), screening, diagnostic biomarkers, accelerating efficiency predicting 
biomarkers and refining techniques for the study and development of new 
drugs. They provide techniques for the analysis of not only disturbances of 
complex organic systems such as the cardiovascular and neurological 
systems but also in use in oncology. 
This 
metabolic 
technology 
has 
contributed 
to 
advancing 
the 
understanding of the nutritional domain, providing a possibility for a more 
detailed characterization of the nutritional quality of foods as well as for a 
better understanding of the epidemiology of metabolic diseases (obesity, 
type-2 diabetes, etc.). This last area of metabolomics is the newest and most 
promising field of innovation of all these technologies, as it opens the way to 
predictive biology. 
Another area, genomics as a science, has established the foundations of 
genome engineering, which consists of intervening in the genetic material of 
living entities, and modifying this genetic material in order to obtain 
selective mutations or therapeutic effects. This generic technology provides 
new methods for the selection of complex living organisms. It mainly 
focuses on the research for a particular characteristic that will be obtained 
through natural selection assisted by biological markers or by direct 
modification, obtained through transgenesis, which consists of the 
introduction of a foreign gene to an organism [MIN 16]. 
Nonetheless, the more structured development pathway resulting thereof 
is gene therapy, which now allows for the treatment of genetic diseases by 
neutralizing a failing gene and replacing it with a functional gene. It also 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     101 
enables microorganisms to be modified so as to turn them into therapeutic 
agents [BUS 17]. 
These biological technologies pave the way for regenerative medicine, 
based on restorative biological engineering as a means to regenerate tissue, 
using cell therapy, leading to the re-construction of organs, based on stem 
cells techniques3. 
This myriad of primarily analytical and therapeutic technologies leads to 
revolutionary opportunities in synthetic biology by creating new avenues for 
enzyme production. It also allows for the modification of species for 
agricultural purposes and the generation of new molecules on the basis of 
genetically modified biomass or the provision of genetically modified 
microorganisms such as de-polluting agents. However, it primarily opens 
new pathways for re-constructive engineering, which is transforming human-
related medicine. 
5.1.5. Deepening energy diversification 
Energy diversification, which is the trademark of the third technological 
system, along with the big energy crisis of the 1970s, has been the subject of 
in-depth study at varying degrees according to the type of energy. 
5.1.5.1. The nuclear, a technology at limits 
Nuclear energy, which reached its maturity between the 1970s and 1980s, 
has not actually undergone any major transformation or breakthrough since 
then. Attempts at more advanced technology such as the breeder reactor 
have come to a standstill and resulted in the stopping of programs in the 
early 1980s because of the difficulty in mastering its extreme operating 
conditions. The new generation of EPR technology, although recovering 
most of PWR technology, is experiencing major difficulties in development. 
These developments show a relative stagnation of nuclear technology in 
the past 30 years. The causes of this paralysis lie in the weight of the security 
constraint, continually magnified by social pressure, which became acute 
due to recent accidents resulting from this technology. This major constraint 
quickly brought this industry to its limits. These limits of a technological 
                                        
3 The first manufactured drug based on stem cells, capable of treating the rejection of bone 
marrow transplants, Prochymal, was marketed in Canada in May 2012. 

102     The Ongoing Technological System 
nature, reinforced by this growing social distrust, have led to stopping the  
use of this energy, in Germany for example, and to the project for the 
reduction of the percentage of nuclear power in French energy production. 
Distrusts concerning nuclear energy then shifts, most probably as a result 
of the increasing age of nuclear installations, onto controlling the end of life 
of power plants with the development of techniques for dismantling 
facilities, as well as the end of life of nuclear fuel that raises re-processing 
and mostly ultimate storage issues, which in this case still require extreme 
conditions: high storage with reliability on the timescale of millenia. These 
are highly demanding technologies that will cause stimulation in other areas 
of the technical system. 
Therefore, it then seems that nuclear fission has not been an enabling 
generic technology and that its contribution to energy production has 
remained limited, all the more due to its incapacity for internal technological 
development and to the social mistrust that it still provokes. This form of 
energy only represented 4.8% of the world’s energy in 20124. 
On the contrary, fusion, another major production process of nuclear 
energy, is still experiencing sustained development, driven by concerns for 
energy transition in the face of climate change and stimulated by the launch 
of the ITER project. This is a whole series of experiments conducted by 
start-ups, MIT or Lockheed Martin, involving small reactors that exhibit 
have reduced very promising development. For most of them, they have 
reduced the deadline for operational energy to 2020 and 2025, which is 
abundant and more efficient in terms of raw material as well as environmentally 
neutral production [DUP 16]. Fusion would represent the ultimate form of 
energy production, the unlimited capacity for energy production, which would 
then actually translate into a change of technological system. 
5.1.5.2. Renewable energies 
5.1.5.2.1. Solar energy 
The production of energy from the Sun mainly relies on the photovoltaic 
process based on semiconductors to directly produce electrical energy. This 
device has been stimulated during its development by the extreme conditions 
of its implementation in the space industry, of which it has been the main

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     103 
energy source, and it is now solicited on a large scale, required by the 
increase of the percentage of solar energy within the total energy production; 
despite all of these facts, the central device of the photovoltaic 
transformation has not recently experienced any major innovation. 
The evolution and improvement that photovoltaics has experienced has 
no longer been located in its generic dimension – the transformation of solar 
radiation into electricity – stabilized in the early 1980s. It is rather rooted in 
the periphery of the technical system of electrical energy generation, namely 
by means of sensor supports, including flexible supports in particular, which 
enable extending the area of application or the electronics associated that can 
be used in control devices such as for tracking the Sun or in manufacturing 
technology through the use of thin-film technology. 
Photovoltaic technology is a mature power generation technology, 
however it exhibits the capacity to support a very important quantitative 
development of this energy source, for example, 25% growth on a global 
scale, between 2014 and 20155. It has reached the level of technological 
performance that would turn it into one of the major components of the 
energy transition. 
5.1.5.2.2. Wind power and hydrokinetics 
Wind power, consisting of the capture and transformation of wind power 
and its sister hydrokinetics for hydraulic power, represent generic  
technologies in the sense that they constitute energy production 
technologies; however, they are not technologies at the strictly technical 
level because they depend on mechanical technology for capturing natural 
energy, from wind and water, and on electronic control and information 
technologies, thus constituting mechatronic systems. Their ability to 
progress is actually dependent on the potential for the development of 
mechanical and mechatronic systems, such as the capture of wind speed data 
by laser, enabling computerized management of the orientation of the nacelle 
and of the incidence angle of rotor blades to optimize its operation. It is also 
found in remote maintenance management with automatic information 
transmission, fault-recovery and remote re-start control in 85% of cases 
[DES 16].

104     The Ongoing Technological System 
5.1.5.3. Hydrogen 
Hydrogen is a fast-growing energy source, and regardless of the 
possibilities to use it directly as gas [CAT 15], the major aspect of its 
development has focused on the fuel cell that produces electricity through 
the catalysis of the hydrogen–oxygen mixture. At its origin, the catalyst of 
the fuel cell is platinum, whose scarcity and price represent a hurdle and 
limitation to the development of this form of energy production. Therefore, 
at present, several processes are competing to overcome this constraint by 
means of using a cheap and easily available catalyst. It consists of employing 
a polymer electrolyte membrane, a ceramic electrolyte or a combination of 
phosphoric-carbonate acids. These various devices operate at temperatures 
ranging from 180 to 1,000°C [BLU 09]. 
The fuel cell consists of a promising source of energy for an energy 
system centered on electrical energy. It potentially provides the autonomous 
and mobile process of power generation for transport but also for the 
powering of mobile products, such as cell phones and laptops. An important 
effort of miniaturization is still required to achieve this objective6. 
5.1.6. A new dimension of generic technologies: nanometric 
properties 
A large field of innovation relies on the transformation of some of these 
generic technologies – electronic, materials or mechanical – in line with a 
tendency for miniaturization that has reached the molecular or atomic level. 
Therefore, at this infinitely small level, it is possible to consider the use of 
“phenomena that are surprising at this scale, very simply because material 
properties (mechanical, optical, magnetic or thermal) depend on their size: 
some disappear, others emerge, others are improved, others still no longer 
respect the laws of classical physics or even of quantum physics” [DEV 06]. 
We are thus witnessing the emergence of a technological field enabling a 
radical level of innovation, originating from known generic technologies 
which nonetheless are initiating a new paradigm, a number of radical 
emerging properties, mainly due to a size effect. These emerging properties, 
because of the radical nature of their functional possibilities should unfold in 
a powerful and “pervasive” manner, in other words, spread throughout 
multiple 
areas: 
electronics, 
telecommunications, 
energy, 
medicine, 
construction, textile, armaments, and so on, and similarly to other

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     105 
technologies before them, nanotechnology should develop “potentials that 
only reveal themselves gradually, accompanying the extension of reality that 
supports them” [KAH 12]. 
5.2. Applications re-composition and development 
This second wave of innovation will come to fruition by means of a wave 
of new applications. Considering that this movement is driven, as we have 
seen, by the powerful development of the performance of electronic 
information technology, it is also driven by advances in other generic 
technologies. Nonetheless, this movement has been extraordinarily enhanced 
by the convergence of previously independent and isolated technologies. 
This convergence is allowed and favored by the performance level of 
information technologies that generates generalized digitization and 
connecting, as well as in material processing technology through the access 
at the nanometric level to the atom and the molecule, which makes, at this 
level, the large fields of material processing compatible and capable of 
synergy. 
5.2.1. A movement driven by technology convergence: the five 
re-composition forces of the technological system 
Our technological system has initiated a maturity phase that enables, as 
demonstrated by the lifecycle model7, the diversification of technologies 
according to their functional precision and especially the creation of 
applications and new systems through the combination of technologies 
previously separated from the so-called convergence or fusion of 
technologies [DUB 93]. This mechanism started very early in the third 
system, with the frequent migration of microelectronics devices in systems 
of a different nature, such as mechanics, in particular. The emergence, in the 
1980s, of CNC machines, of the so-called mechatronics, is already one of the 
manifestations thereof. The phenomenon has taken on a whole new 
dimension from the end of the 1990s onward with generalized digitalization, 
which has given rise to a host of new technical systems and which represents 
in our perspective a major source of innovation for decades to come, because 
it enhances the inherent potential for the progress of each major 
technological field by that of a very strong combinatorial possibility. The 
dynamics of this great technological innovation movement that this second 
                                        
7 See Chapter 1. 

106     The Ongoing Technological System 
wave of the third technological system represents may be schematized 
similarly to the following diagram. 
A fundamental and powerful force is the exponential increase of 
computing power, expressed by Moore’s law. This movement, underway 
since the beginning of the 1970s, has reached the massive levels of an 
advanced exponential movement. 
 
Figure 5.1. Five innovation forces of the second  
wave of the contemporary technological system 
The level reached by these computing performances will allow us to 
generalize the digitalization of analog peripheral technologies. In doing so, 
generalized digitalization enables the convergence of these technologies 
within a single system, generating multiple new applications (smartphone 
effect). This digitalization will contribute to the extension of the effect of 
Moore’s law to other technological fields. 
The level of computing power will transform communication 
technologies to the extent of launching a generalized connection movement, 
enabling the increase of the power effect as well as greater technological 
recombination (Internet effect). 
 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     107 
In the field of generic material technology, namely materials and 
biotechnology, it is the nanometric miniaturization movement that has 
become a factor of performance increase, due to a feedback effect on 
information technology processors, a flow of innovation and the maturation  
of genetic technologies. This level of nanometric technology in turn  
promotes convergence because it makes possible interaction and fusion at 
the molecular or even atomic level, between nature transformation modes 
that were previously independent (bio-info effect). 
Finally, the system is “shaken”, not only in the sense of re-composition, 
substitution and renewal of energy technologies in particular, but also 
potentially of all transformation technologies, by the environmental 
transition. 
These are the five driving forces that are striving to orientate what is 
probably the largest technological shift in the history of humanity. 
This mechanism creates new objects, and most will have a very wide 
public use. The most emblematic is the smartphone that becomes in turn the 
support and the vector of a new wave of functional innovations. This 
movement shifts the boundaries and limits of objects by combining a 
multitude of functions. However, this causes it to generate new functions, 
such as personal text-based phone voicemail and social networks, which will 
in turn lead to architectural re-arrangement, new functions and technological 
recombinations. 
This development through convergence is also very powerful at the 
professional level, whose practices are modified thereby. The case of 
assisted surgery is a striking example, as is the widespread use of drones and 
robots of any kind in numerous areas of activities [OUD 14]. In the end, 
these come to occupy increasingly complex system areas and to generate 
sophisticated objects of totally new forms that can explore action fields 
previously inaccessible, such as underwater robots or operating “spiders” 
able to work vertically or on inclined surfaces and thus employing 
convergence with bionics. 

108     The Ongoing Technological System 
5.2.2. New applications through convergence 
5.2.2.1. Innovation through technological convergence is particularly 
powerful in the field of information and communication technologies, 
for instance, generalized connectivity in the Internet 
From a certain level of computing and digitalization power, a number of 
telecommunication technologies have emerged, driven by a military impulse 
related to the Cold War, in the form of a global communication network 
device that has become widespread in most activities and designated as the 
Internet. It has in turn opened up a substantial number of innovations in 
software applications supporting totally innovative services. 
In the 1960s, initial works and early studies appeared in the United States 
on networks and on the technical device which optimizes massive network 
operations: packet switching technology. The first network, Arpanet, was 
developed by the DARPA and the RAND Corporation, in order to create, in 
this period of nuclear war risks, a universal communication network that was 
indestructible because it was free from any hierarchy and infinitely re-
configurable. 
The considerable increase in processing power has made it possible to 
integrate into digital operation areas of activity that have emerged from 
analog technologies. It has contributed to making technologies compatible 
and unifying their operation, which, by their convergence, will generate a 
multitude of applications. Image- and sound-related areas have been 
particularly transformed by this digitalization, resulting in the appearance of 
integrated multimedia devices [CAS 02]. 
It was the convergence of a series of technological developments at the 
end of the 1980s that resulted in the maturation of this device. First, by 
means of the fast generalization of computerized equipment through the 
widespread use of the PC and individual computer workstations, the 
microelectronics revolution has established the sufficient density of 
terminals and users of this network. The constant increase in computing 
processing powers has provided the bases for an ever-increasing efficiency 
and a growing use of this network. It was also from the convergence 
between computing and telecommunication technologies that this universal 
digital network obtained its robustness and potential for expansion. This  
 
 
 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     109 
digital network has also reached its full service capacity through the 
generalized digitization that took place in the early 1990s, with its ability to 
convey text, as well as data, sound and image. 
Figure 5.2. Internet representation as a non-hierarchical universal network 
Figure 5.3. Growth of the number of internet users in the world 

110     The Ongoing Technological System 
From the 1990s the Internet developed on a global level and became a 
universal medium for human activity. According to the International 
Telecommunications Union, at the end of 2016, the number of Internet users 
was about 3.9 billion (about 47% of the world population) compared to a 
little more than 100 million in 1998. While 24 million servers were 
identified in 2000, there were more than 230 million in 2010 and 966 million 
servers were counted in 2016. 
5.2.2.2. The convergence toward a universal component, sensors 
Sensors are a great example of development based on convergence and 
which themselves constitute factors of dissemination or convergence for 
technical systems and applications in which they are integrated. 
A sensor captures different physical data – thermal, chemical or 
biological – and transforms it into a digital signal8. Thus, a biosensor is a 
sensor for which the detection processor is a biological molecule. Nowadays, 
three major technological families of sensors can be identified: MEMS 
(Micro-Electronic, Mechanical Systems), CMOS (Complementary Metal–
Oxide–Semiconductors) and optronic sensors. 
Therefore, sensors today are technical systems based on technological 
convergence; they are also the vectors of this convergence for an integration 
of technologies at the level of larger-dimension technical systems. They 
constitute an essential component in all automatic and autonomous systems, 
because they constitute the source of feedback information from which these 
systems are guiding themselves and adapt. Sensors are the basic components 
of devices in areas as diverse as mechatronic systems, including, in 
particular, robotic systems, driving automation and energy process controls. 
These sensors provide data for predictive maintenance and risk management. 
A category of them, biosensors, are dedicated to controlling physiological 
parameters, in health care, and in the environment, for the detection of 
chemical and biological risks; the list is by no means exhaustive [ROM 17]. 
5.2.2.3. Mechatronics 
Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics; it has 
nowadays expanded to information-based and even intelligence-based 
mechanics.

Figure 5.4. The different fields of mechatronics 
Mechatronics is the combination of mechanics and electronics, 
automation, real-time computing and now intelligence. It constitutes the 
evolved form of the re-composition of this traditional technology by a new 
technology: mechanics by information technologies. 
Mechatronics, which emerged in the 1970s along with the early 
developments of electronic automatic systems and robotics, has today 
become generalized and increased its area of action, notably through 
enhancing regulatory capacities and increasing automation mechanisms with 
the development of intelligence, and of pilotage at a distance such as by 
remote control mechanisms [BIR 16]. 
Applications can be found in cars, with devices such as ABS, power 
steering and instrumented roller bearings, in the field of aeronautics, with 
autopilot, in computing technologies with hard disk drives and in 
photography techniques, with autofocus mechanisms. This involves all areas 
of intelligent machines, robotics and dronautics and even telesurgery  
[ORB 17] and, at a technological extreme, robots used to explore Mars and, 
more generally, robots devoted to extreme tasks [PAS 17]. This list is not 
exhaustive for this technology, which has become universal. 
5.2.2.4. From the rise of the technical system to the convergence of 
the application of high-performance computing: artificial intelligence 
Artificial intelligence owes its development to the extraordinary 
processing capability of contemporary computing. From a capability of  

112     The Ongoing Technological System 
1 million operations per second in 1970, 160 billion operations per second 
with an Intel Paragon supercomputer was possible during the mid-1990s, and 
nowadays processing capability is measured in petaflops, 1015, which 
corresponds to a million billion operations per second. The 10 most powerful 
supercomputers in the world in 2016 had a computational performance 
ranging from 8 to 93 petaflops9. 
Artificial intelligence is a technology that has recently expanded on the 
basis of scientific works that date back to the 1940s with Turing’s works. 
Furthermore, it has developed itself by relying on algorithmic tools and 
cognitive sciences, neurosciences and linguistics, whose developments are 
obviously driven by the information processing capability that we have 
mentioned above. Artificial intelligence has developed itself in a number of 
sub-fields: 
automatic 
reasoning 
and 
knowledge-modeling, 
pattern 
recognition leading notably to artificial vision and speech recognition, 
natural language processing leading to machine translation, multi-agent 
systems and the more recent and more elaborate ramification of automated 
training (machine learning). These applications of AI have resulted in 
artificial diagnostic and decision support systems. AI has thus fertilized the 
field of robotics with the development of advanced, autonomous robots and 
self-learning robots [ANR 12].

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     113 
The field of artificial intelligence has been combined with that of big data 
and massive data processing, which when combined with artificial reasoning 
can be used to perform correlations and draw conclusions, a field known as 
deep learning. 
Therefore, AI, which is able to develop very powerful deductive models, 
tends to combine and create synergy with the potentials of the powerful 
inductive processing of large amounts of data, from which it is possible to 
generate elaborated and predictive knowledge. It allows trend analysis and 
forecasting (climate-related, socio-political, etc.) and risk management 
(commercial, insurance, industrial and natural). It can also be used for 
advanced analysis and powerful modeling in biological and medical fields, 
in the field of genomics in particular. This combination is at the root of 
dynamic meteorology methods in view of the analysis of the climate system 
and ecological systems and for the management of complex systems such as 
energy networks and security management. 
Bots, or conversational agents, are an interface that mimics human 
conversation and constitute a widespread application of artificial 
intelligence, a rather old application, which appeared in 1964 with the first 
“Chatter bot”, Eliza, from MIT. However, their widespread mass usage and 
development are recent. We should note the implementation of a platform 
that can create bots, part of a large Chinese social media application, namely 
WeChat with 700 million users. The bots field is currently being developed 
by the four big names in digital technology (Google, Apple, Facebook and 
Amazon), able to rely on excellent natural language processing engines: 
“The phenomenon is an indicator of a future trend: an integration of 
applications and third party services within the same product whose unique 
facade will replace conventional search engines with major breakthroughs 
achieved in speech synthesis and recognition, text-to-speech is only a matter 
of time and will be effective by 2020” [BER 16]. 
5.3. The wave of new technical systems, new objects and new 
functionality 
Undergoing a powerful evolution, these applications have constituted the 
basis for the development of a new world of objects and new technical 
systems, as generators of new functionalities. It is impossible to present all 

114     The Ongoing Technological System 
of these system objects and functions here; we will focus on the most  
representative and at the same time the more structuring of this technological 
system in motion. 
For instance, information technology obviously appears to be fertile again 
for dynamic applications both at the level of pure computing technological 
systems and in the multitude of technical systems connecting computer 
technology to various operating processes, and mainly to the set of all the 
devices said to be intelligent and networking. We will see further that they 
are animated by a technological dynamic based on a prevailing architectural 
and functional transformation. 
Beyond the “process” aspect, the computing power available today is 
going to help develop information processing resources toward modeling 
and hyper-complexity processing as well as the development of simulation 
and “virtual science”. 
5.3.1. The system of networks and connections 
5.3.1.1. Development of the Internet: from the generalization of e-mail 
to social networks, to e-commerce, to the Internet of things 
5.3.1.1.1. A reconfiguration of information systems on the network 
model: cloud computing 
Cloud computing is an information processing device deployed on 
remote servers and within a network, in which the user has the possibility to 
only use these infrastructures or to also use software applications in addition 
to the platform. The “clouds” are servers accessible through the Internet and 
use technologies such as computer hardware virtualization, grid computing 
and service-oriented architectures. A cloud can be public, private or part of a 
community. 
The promotion of cloud computing has been made possible by 
widespread access to the Internet (with 75% of French households equipped 
with the Internet at home, according to data from 2011 from the Credoc) and 
businesses. The phenomenon has also benefited from the significant increase 
in computer performance, which has allowed hosts to offer increasingly 
more attractive prices. In this sense, cloud computing takes advantage of the 
considerable increase in server performance (the frequency of server 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     115 
operation has been multiplied by a factor of 10 between 1998 and 2008, 
processors comprise between 4 and 10 cores) and from the reduction in 
storage costs (for the price of a 1.2 GB hard drive in 2000, we could 
purchase a 1,000 GB hard drive in 2013)10. 
5.3.1.2. Mobile telephony: wireless networks and transmission 
infrastructures 
Mobile telephony has been developed and implemented from the 1990s, 
with the new generation of network infrastructures, the so-called 2G GSM 
network. Driven by the increase of its information flow, which reached  
9.6 kb/s, it supported and corresponded to the widespread dissemination of 
the first generation of mobile phones, which allowed calling and 
communicating by SMS with 80 characters or less. This volume of usage 
saturated transmission infrastructures and led to the emergence of the 3G 
network, from the early 2000s, based on the UMTS standard (the Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications System). The main requirement of this network 
was to increase the information flow, from 2 Mb/s to 42 Mb/s, required by 
the generalized digitalization. It also allowed image transmission and video 
telephony in mobile phones as well as an increase in the volume of use such 
as e-mail and the Internet. The implementation of the 3G network and the 
performance level of this type of network infrastructure have corresponded 
to the appearance of the smartphone. It represented a new generation of 
mobile phone terminals, which could possibly be designated as universal 
communication terminals because these new devices allow the transmission 
of all communication types, such as voice, text, images, data or M2M 
(machine to machine), on both telecommunication and Internet media. 
Access to the Internet e-mail services has gradually moved into users’ 
habits. Terminals have improved (smartphone, etc.) allowing for a more 
comfortable utilization of high-speed connections. Thus, 4G emerged as the 
successor to 3G based on the LTE standard (Long-Term Evolution) and 
especially on advanced LTE, which primarily appears as a technical 
disruption with a new radio interface and the modification of the existing 
network architecture in order to provide an all IP connection. It makes it 
possible to achieve an information flow of 1 Gb/s. 
There should be a shift to a 5G infrastructure that can reach or exceed the 
10 Gb/s level. 
                                        
10 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing 

116     The Ongoing Technological System 
5.3.1.3. The Internet of things 
The Internet of things is now the most complete system of networks: “A 
network of networks that enables, through standardized and unified 
electronic identification systems and wireless mobile devices, directly and 
unambiguously identifying digital entities and physical objects and thus 
continuously retrieving, storing, transferring and processing between 
physical and virtual worlds, data related thereto” [BEN 12]. 
The Internet of things has thus introduced communication continuity 
between connected objects and communicating terminals. It has been called 
WEB 3.0. 
5.3.2. Virtual reality 
This is first of all based on digital visualization, which has been possible 
to combine with smart processing and networking. It is implemented in two 
major applications: immersive technologies and simulation. 
5.3.2.1. Multimedia and immersive technologies 
It was also from the mid-1990s onwards that virtual reality and 
immersive technologies were developed. The first hypermedia creations 
appeared in the 1970s, such as the first virtual reality helmet or the 
production of the simulation of an American city or even the implementation 
of the first flight simulators for the US Air Force. Nonetheless, these 
creations could not experience large-scale development because of the lack 
of computing support and the still unclear nature of image and sound 
digitization techniques. 
It was initially based on the combination of reproduction techniques of 
image and sound in what is known as multimedia, but then relied on the 
recombination of a real-time sensory environment and the interaction with 
the end-user. This device was based on augmented-reality and mixed- 
reality technologies, such as holography, combined with 3D sound 
immersion, location sensors, motion and force-feedback sensors, with the 
latter allowing the user to communicate with the system to control it and 
issue commands. 
 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     117 
The terminals used may be booths such as in large simulators, 
workstations, virtual reality helmets, computers, tablets or smartphones, or 
even glasses. These systems have had multiple uses, the first and most 
popular have been in interactive video games and connected networks; a 
large conventional application of this immersive virtual reality technology is 
the training simulation of operators for aircraft, ships, land vehicles, nuclear 
power plants and industrial facilities and, more recently, for surgical 
operations. These devices have been developed and used in digital building 
mock-ups for architectural simulation or planning devices as well as for 
virtual tourism activities, including the possibility for virtual tours of 
touristic sights, museums and monuments [MIN 16]. 
Nowadays, assisted driving devices have been developed by means of 
glasses that directly display driving data and provide artificial vision for 
blind spots. A major use of this type of technology, moreover, combined 
with robotic technology, has been developed in the medical field and in 
particular in surgery by working from a 3D representation of the patient. 
Immersive reality techniques are increasingly used not only for the 
design, modeling and simulation of production activities, but also for 
maintenance in industrial environments. Large automotive or aeronautical 
manufacturers have created virtual reality centers or equipped their assembly 
lines with augmented reality devices. 
Augmented reality is also employed in the development of an application 
originating from e-commerce that provides potential consumers with the 
ability to visualize the product in 3D within its usage environment or even to 
try it. It represents a medium that tends to become widespread in training 
and, moreover, by transforming its practice. This is a medium that provides a 
means to materialize real phenomena and situations, to simulate actions  
and control, such as in site operations, to implement a complex system  
and so on. 
5.3.2.2. Digital engineering and simulation 
One of the new fields of computing potentialities, the body of digital 
engineering, also known as computer-assisted engineering, allows for the 
design, simulation and validation of new products, initiated by CAD and 
modeled industrial systems and simulated by CAM. This engineering 
discipline is based on the computer modeling of systems, which can be used 
to simulate behaviors and changes with behavior simulation software 
systems (static, kinematics, dynamics, etc.). Originally initiated for areas 

118     The Ongoing Technological System 
such as mechanics, materials or fluid flows, its application has been 
extended to complex systems such as energy and telecommunication 
systems, allowing them to be optimized, or the climate system, for which its 
purpose consists of understanding its complex and long-term operation. This 
digital engineering and its culmination and simulation, have provided the 
means to achieve and represent abstract or infra-perceptual systems such as 
nano-technological or biological systems. 
Similarly in design, the development of the system to be built can be 
represented within a representation and simulation tool, which is the digital 
mockup11 and has become a very powerful design support process, 
particularly for collaborative design. 
5.3.3. Smart objects 
The in-depth deployment of information technologies, their confluence 
and their combination in what we have referred to as integral digitalization, 
combined with networking, has led to a shift to a new level of information 
processing that has been commonly referred to as artificial intelligence or 
intelligent systems [BRY 14]. 
This emergence is sometimes the result of a significant increase in power, 
capture power, storage power, sorting power and processing power, resulting 
in these knowledge-generating devices called “big data”. 
Also driven by miniaturization, these smart devices cannot substitute 
human action but enhance it by strengthening its perception capacities, its 
cognitive abilities and even those of physical action, forming the augmented 
reality or even the enhanced human. 
The increased performance of computer systems has also generated a 
whole range of capabilities by means of complex recognition, evolutive 
memorization, procedural processing and decision-making, which will 
produce robots capable of a large autonomy of action. These have not only 
contributed to renewing the robotics industry, but also generated domestic 
robotics, search software robots, drones and so on. This movement is in the 
process of enabling the complex automatic steering of vehicles as well as 
that of technical systems previously exclusively human-driven.

5.3.3.1. A new world of robots: autonomous robotics 
Autonomous technical systems and operating systems have appeared and 
been developed in multiple domains, such as robots and vehicles, which 
have become autonomous systems known as “smart”. 
The autonomy of these systems designates not only the type of autonomy 
gained since their appearance in the 1980s, namely the autonomy of 
movement and action, but also that controlled by decision and operation 
mechanisms of the programmed automatic type. This refers to a new 
generation of autonomy in the sense of information acquisition for purposes 
of adaptive and evolutive decision-making, programming and action. This 
autonomy is extended for self-training of these systems, which makes it a 
specific characteristic of this new generation [LUC 16]. 
These systems operate on the basis of the integration of devices capable 
of perceiving their environment, by integrating heterogeneous data through a 
system of data fusion to produce structured information enabling, in a 
robotics operating system, decision-making and action control. 
These autonomous robots are now implemented in agriculture, with 
robots for milking cows, for field cultivation maintenance and assistance to 
harvesting. Households are also a development area for robots, especially 
with the already popular model of the autonomous vacuum cleaner robot. 
Within this same field of activity, evolutionary versatile robots are under 
development, constituting a platform of services for home interior 
maintenance. 
This type of robotics finds a specific application in the industry. Unlike 
conventional robotics, based on the programming of repetitive actions and 
intended for mass production industry, the application specificity is that of 
the capability of performing complex, fine, adaptive and evolutionary tasks, 
intended for unit or short-series industrial production, as in aeronautics for 
example. Robots destined to be used in extreme environments such as 
nuclear, space or underwater are also under development [PAS 17]. 
As a result, a key device determines the evolution of this type of new 
generation of industrial robot. This is the gripping device, which has to be 
refined in terms of the perception, grip accuracy, precision and versatility of 
gesture. 

120     The Ongoing Technological System 
The drone is a form of autonomous robot particularly well known and 
visible in the contemporary technological system, which constitutes the 
autonomous robotization of an air-, water- or land-based object. The most 
widely and rapidly developed ones have been unmanned aerial vehicles 
capable of carrying out a mission by adapting themselves to the environment 
and ensuring their autonomous steering. Its main applications are 
observation, surveillance and photography drones. However, we are also 
witnessing the development of active underwater exploration drones, parcel 
delivery drones, combat drones and so on, ranging to drones and robots for 
space exploration such as in the case of the exploration robots on Mars or on 
meteorites. 
An additional application appears today with the inter-connection of 
these drones able to operate in swarms; this is a development originating 
from the Internet of Things, which has implemented its main developments 
in the field of defense and in naval weaponry systems in particular  
[ROB 10]. 
A rapid and widespread application form of autonomous robotics is the 
current development of the autonomous vehicle capable of controlling itself, 
particularly inside a complex urban world of fine maneuvers such as 
parking, and able to ensure safety maneuvers in a much safer manner than 
automatic braking. 
5.3.3.2. Cobotics 
This type of autonomous robotics is generating a particular robot whose 
purpose is not to be able to operate on its own but rather to collaborate with 
human operators and thus to provide them with assistance in their more 
demanding, difficult or specialized chores. It is named cobotics from 
“collaboration” and “robotics”. This form of robotics consists of autonomous 
robotic systems capable of exhibiting synergistic behavior with the human 
operator and has the ability to enhance and strengthen human action in areas 
[DEV 12]: 
– concerned with the strength that these systems bring to human action, 
such as in enhancing effort and lifting loads; 
– concerned with accuracy in fine technical operations; 
– related to enhanced perception in the visual, auditory and tactile 
domains; 
– concerned with high-complexity operations in the field of cognition. 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     121 
For example, cobotics is not only used in the production of exoskeletons 
for industrial maintenance tasks, but also in smart and energized orthotic 
systems to compensate for the loss of motricity in limbs. It covers the entire 
field of autonomous prostheses, including devices such as artificial hearts 
and retinas. Cobotics is also a component of healthcare technologies, namely 
in remotely operated surgery and microscopic surgery. These supports for 
dexterity, strength or perception acuteness are integrated in synergy with 
human action. Therefore, an integration of this type of cobots is being 
implemented in the aviation industry to deal with the finest and most 
complex actions. In general, the development of cobots such as exoskeletons 
is necessary to increase the performance of human action by minimizing the 
risk of musculoskeletal injuries that some tasks may cause. 
This technological contribution, which could be described as an enhanced 
human technology, is developing in the field of defense with cobot-like 
systems being designed to enhance the action of the fighter12. 
Thus, autonomous robotics clearly highlights how new functions are 
developed, such as major enhancements of the potentialities of previous 
robots and automata, by implementing new features through the convergence 
of new generations of digital technology, connection, sensors, intelligence 
and so on. They show two things in terms of technological system dynamics: 
first, the fact that the combination and synergy of several technologies reveal 
innovative emerging functions; second that these new functions stimulate 
new internal innovations due to the increased qualitative and quantitative 
performance requirements that they demand from systems. 
5.3.4. A new world of production 
5.3.4.1. A new phase of integration of intelligent production and 
logistic systems 
The innovation movement has transformed production methods with new 
digital management and flow control systems in addition to the intelligent 
control of transformation processes [MOL 06]. It enhances and deepens the 
re-composition of production and logistics processes, which had been largely 
initiated in the first phase of the contemporary technological system.

122     The Ongoing Technological System 
5.3.4.2. Additive manufacturing 
Additive manufacturing was originally a rapid prototyping device that 
appeared at the MIT in the 1990s. A manufacturing process transforms a 3D 
model into a physical object, by assembling successive layers of the same  
material, and operates by adding material, whereas all mechanical 
manufacturing technologies throughout the history of technology have been 
based on removing material. 
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is based on the 
principle of material being deposited in successive layers by means of 
various processes, namely extrusion, jets of material, liquid-phase photo-
polymerization, powder bed fusion or material deposited via a beam of 
energy. Additive manufacturing can produce parts in materials as diverse as 
plastics, metal or ceramic materials or wood. 
The device operates under numerical control from CAD formalization. 
Three-dimensional printing enables the production of complex parts, whose 
design reduces and simplifies parts, and which also makes it possible to 
eliminate assembly phases. It is therefore dedicated to manufacturing parts 
customized in small series. Additive manufacturing is particularly used in 
electronics, aeronautic, spatial, bio-medical and luxury industries [MIN 16]. 
By its disruptive nature, this industrial process contributes to re-
composing the production cycle [MOR 16] and evolving so as to expand its 
field of action, by adapting itself to the production of large or multi-material 
parts and by further tending toward improving the surface of parts produced 
with the aim of eliminating finishing treatments. In addition, additive 
manufacturing requires a finer specification of the characteristics of raw 
materials used. By providing feedback to design, additive manufacturing 
results in adapting CAD software to integrate therein mechanical constraints 
specific to this type of production. 
5.3.5. Bio- and nanotechnology systems 
5.3.5.1. Bio-systems 
Similarly, the large pool of innovations expected in biotechnology 
through genetic engineering since the beginning of the new technological 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     123 
system is currently proving to be successful, particularly with developments  
in gene therapy, in regenerative medicine, through the use of stem cells, 
transgenesis and GMOs. These latter have opened new production 
approaches not only in agriculture or agri-food, with the production of 
functionalized nutrition, in the whole of bio-sourced industry, but also in 
energy sectors relying on “microorganisms and genetically modified plants 
capable of producing bio-fuels more easily and at a lower cost than the 
plants currently used” [DES 12]. The mapping of the human genome has 
created pathways expanded to genetic recombination, in the field of 
healthcare as it has been conducted in the field of agriculture. Nevertheless, 
these two areas collide and their development is slowed by sustained 
psychological resistance and constant ethical obstacles. Moreover, these may 
also sometimes be overcome, as in the case of stem cells, which can now be 
obtained from differentiated adult cells, and which therefore no longer 
require the use of human embryos. 
5.3.5.2. Nano-objects and systems 
It seems that biotechnology at the same time experiences a bifurcation 
toward a “more integrated concept of living entities: the latter are perceived 
as a looped system in which genes, RNA and proteins are in constant 
interaction” [PAP 13], all this while not abandoning the molecular 
development pathway. 
The projection of the structure and of the dynamics of innovation thus 
appears to structure itself on at least four bases. In the future, innovations 
will continue to be enabled by generic technologies operating in the current 
system, even if it means that this level of development reveals emerging 
properties. In this context, innovations will mostly tend to be formed through 
the convergence and combination of technologies accompanied by the 
appearance of new functions. The general tone of the innovation movement 
in the system will be marked in the long term by the environmental 
dimension. Finally, the complexity of constraints will result in focusing 
innovation on a new type of versatile incremental innovation. 
5.3.6. Versatile incremental innovation 
In the contemporary system, the maturity of some areas no longer allows 
for significant advances in the search for unit performance maximization 
while a growing number of constraints are imposed thereupon, including, but 
by no means least, that of the environment and its techno-economic impacts. 

124     The Ongoing Technological System 
A significant illustration of this process is the civil aircraft for passenger 
transportation. The Concorde experience has shown that the search for the 
highest unit speed reached its limits and that, under the complex conditions 
of civil transportation, Mach 2 was not sustainable in the long term. Thus, 
the speed of 900 km/h that civil jet propulsion aviation attained in the 1960s 
has remained the same and will most likely for the foreseeable future, until 
the development of the distant space plane. 
However, since this period, innovation has shifted according to the 
solution of all the constraints and projects that burdened this activity, such as 
the reduction of fuel consumption or the minimization of greenhouse gas 
emissions and especially the reduction of noise with a strong pressure on 
silence constraints. A structuring constraint of the aircraft system is the 
safety that is currently transforming the network logic of the expanded air 
traffic system and finally constraints of internal space and passenger flow 
management, which gave rise to the architectural developments of the 
Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. What is expressed here for the airplane is 
present in all transport systems and particularly in the automotive system. 
This mode of evolution will most likely remain the same without any 
major foreseeable process disruption; these systems subjected to a set of 
complex and growing constraints can only continue to develop this versatile 
innovation system. It shows the interaction of the Abernathys model with 
architectural and functional dominants and the search for a set of 
complementary and environmental functionalities. 
5.4. Environmental pressure, a source of change in the trajectory 
of innovation 
The awareness of environmental limits is a recent concept with the 
advent of a new technological system in the 1970s, with the great oil crisis 
and the report from the Club of Rome [MEA 72]. This physical constraint 
and its awareness on a global scale have not stopped technology from 
expanding and becoming more complex despite structural shortages of not 
only raw materials and particularly oil, but also raw mineral materials such 
as rare earths. Industrial and transportation activities, intensive agriculture 
and urban concentration generate a high level of air, land and water 
pollution. The world has also discovered, since the beginning of the 2000s, 
the consequences of global warming due to greenhouse effects and linked to 
the growth of anthropogenic activity generating huge quantities of carbon 
monoxide released into the atmosphere [KAN 10]. Furthermore, this scale 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     125 
limit is even encountered in the exploitation of normally renewable 
resources such as fish or forests. 
These different forms of environmental limits assumed by national and 
global authorities, as by opinion movements and organizations that have 
been created on this subject, also causing distortions of prices, exert pressure 
on activities generating environmental problems by contributing to eliminate 
certain materials or technologies that are found aggressive or destructive to 
the environment. On the contrary, the need to find alternative solutions to 
our traditional means of production is in the process of enabling a permanent 
flow of innovations. 
In a renewed manner, this concerns the alternative energies movement 
[PHI 11]: solar or wind energy, which have undergone exponential 
development, supported in the solar case in particular by flexible 
photovoltaic solutions and decentralized production configurations. This 
search for new alternative energy solutions is extended to non-conventional 
forms such as the capture of energy from swells or the regeneration of 
ancient devices such as the marine turbine, which is a transposed resurgence 
of the medieval “tide mill”. 
Because of the universality of some of its aspects, the environmental 
constraint will stimulate innovation in a large number of activities through 
the growing problematic of energy for the minimization of CO2 emissions 
and reaching now objectives of autonomy and energy self-sufficiency. This 
set of constraints can weigh on virtually all types of human activity and 
contribute to changing the types of constructions; the means of production, 
transport and consumption; the types of architecture, material solutions and 
supply chain organization; and so on. The scale of these phenomena, the 
magnitudes of transformations and their responses, is in the process of 
contributing to a bifurcation of innovation on an environmental basis, by 
bringing in new technological trajectories and to some extent the 
construction of new paradigms, such as, for example, the shift in thinking 
concerning cultivation patterns in agriculture. 
This environmental constraint also comprises the need for correcting and 
repairing the damage created by pollution accumulated over the centuries. 
Versatile multi-sector and multi-technological innovation is thus developed, 
because innovation is more devoted to satisfying a functional necessity than 
driven by technological development. This innovation does not originate 
from the interaction of technologies in motion, by stimulation of a generic 

126     The Ongoing Technological System 
technology or other converging technologies but by the search for achieving 
this global particular functionality: a lifecycle that is compatible with the 
environment. 
This will induce both the condemnation and reduction of environmentally 
degrading technologies because these are consumers of energy and raw 
materials or producers of discharges that are harmful to the environment as 
well, as a symmetric movement of compensation by the generation of new 
solutions that eventually redirects the technological movement. A movement 
of this kind had occurred at the end of the 1980s with the elimination of CFC 
(chlorofluorocarbon) refrigerant gases found responsible for the degradation 
of the ozone layer and their replacement by more neutral gases, which have 
become generalized to all refrigeration systems. 
We should note today in this area: 
– The substitution of the electric solution to combustion engines and at 
the same time a whole series of innovations in electric energy storage, the 
development of solar power and the fuel cell. 
– The search for technologies alternative to the productions and uses of 
energy sources using carbon fossil resources such as coal and oil or nuclear 
energy from fission. This therefore reflects not only the will for withdrawing 
from thermal power plants and the development of solar, wind and 
geothermal production energy sources, but also the search for energy-
savings with decentralized and distributed production systems. 
– The regeneration of households. The pressure of global warming – 
one-third of the rejected CO2 into the atmosphere on French soil comes from 
household losses – will focus environmentally oriented innovation on the 
habitat with its new constructive and regeneration techniques. The purpose 
of these technical solutions is not only achieving energy efficiency, but also 
minimizing their carbon footprint, resource-savings and considering its 
deconstruction, up to an integral eco-design of buildings and housing 
projects. 
The production of this type of buildings is based on another technological 
area, that of digital technologies, such as sensors, simulation systems and 
control automation devices [JEU 12]. 
 
 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     127 
Constructive techniques have recourse to materials with low 
environmental impact lifecycles, notably bio-sourced materials, to a multi-
materials 
construction 
optimizing 
their 
specific 
qualities 
through 
combination. Building construction is enhanced too by the use of pre-
fabrication. One of the keys to this highly environmental quality habitat is 
the energy system that it incorporates, relying on renewable energy, such as 
photovoltaics and biomass, and which combines them with conventional 
energies by means of intelligent control devices of domestic automation 
system. These construction technologies with environmental purposes not 
only structure new housing projects but are also implemented within the 
huge conventional housing market. 
In the fields of de-pollution and water treatment, the domain of water 
treatment begun with the treatment of municipal wastewater and agricultural 
and industrial effluents. This developing technological area consists of a 
converging multi-technological area, centrally combining chemical and 
biological treatment technologies, metrology systems, supported by sensors, 
fast and real-time diagnosis systems thus often supported by artificial 
intelligence devices and interconnected into an Internet-of-things-type of 
network. The acute character of the water problem combined with the 
processing power that is taking place has led to expanding devices to the 
whole water cycle, as shown in the diagram below. 
 
Figure 5.6. Environmental management of water cycle 

128     The Ongoing Technological System 
This integrated device becomes able to manage a whole range of water 
issues, in “intelligent water management” devices13 from the control of its 
pollution, up to that of the detection and correction of leaks and losses, and 
the optimization of resource taking, by integrating consumption, anticipation 
and planning. 
Similarly, today’s complex devices can be deployed for environmental 
regeneration operations of magnitude such as for the regeneration of polluted 
soils [ERN 14]. Also in this case numerous land treatment devices, such as 
physicochemical (suction of gases by depression, up to capturing pollutants 
in a material, oxidation or chemical reduction, etc.), thermal (incineration, 
volatilization or vitrification) or biological (biolixiviation, microorganisms 
insertion, etc.) ones must be centrally implemented. The choice of treatment 
technology to be implemented is complex, and, as for water treatment, is 
dependent on intelligent and interconnected analysis devices. 
5.4.1. Capture, storage and re-use of CO2 [CLO 16] 
The increase of the greenhouse effect has resulted, since the early 1990s, 
in developing techniques for capturing CO2 from factories and power plant 
fumes; these discharges having an industrial origin represent 20% of global 
CO2 emissions. 
Three capture technological pathways have emerged: post-combustion 
amine scrubbing capture with CO2 extraction, the pre-combustion pathway 
and the forced oxygen-based combustion pathway. The most advanced is the 
former but all these technologies have an implementation cost in terms of 
degradation of the energy efficiency of facilities. 
In the end, the captured CO2 must be stored or fixed. Two avenues are 
being developed today. The first consists of geological storage; CO2 is 
injected into oil fields, for the forced extraction of oil in deposits at the end 
of their operational lives. It can also be stored in deeper saline aquifers or in 
unmineable coal seams. These forms of storage possess a highly reliable 
prognosis. 
 
                                        
13 See [MIN 16], pp. 507–514. 

The Second Wave of the Third Technological System     129 
Nonetheless, the most interesting storage method is that of its use as 
industrial raw material, because it involves the dynamic recovery of CO2. 
Industrial achievements have already been developed such as CO2 synthesis 
for the production of polycarbonate-based polymers. In the field of energy, 
methanation transforms carbon dioxide into fuel gas. The third method 
consists of the use of CO2 as nutrients for micro-algae to obtain, through 
photosynthesis, molecules of interest for human biology (omega 3, 
antioxidant) or the massive production of bio-sourced hydrocarbons. 
Another method is its recovery in the food industry using CO2 for beverage 
carbonation or in food-freezing processes. 
It is probably the latter form of recovery of CO2 that is the most 
“sustainable” because it involves re-using it as raw material, thus taking an 
active part in recycling technologies. 
A new field for repairing and correcting the aggression of our activity on 
the environment through recovery and recycling is also under development; 
it concerns almost all materials and requires the development of specific 
transformational methods. 
Therefore, the effect of the pressure of ecological and climate limits on 
the development of human activity involves the search for an environmental 
transition of technologies, consisting in the substitution of technologies 
compatible with environmental constraints to polluting or toxic technologies, 
expensive in carbonated energy and material. This general trend is already a 
major factor of technological renewal and constitutes a powerful driver of 
innovation today. 
Because of its intensity and universality, the second wave of 
technological innovation reflected in the contemporary technological system 
has a requirement and a transformation effect of social forms and of the 
functioning of different areas of society. It is the economy that is 
transformed; in its reality and functioning mechanisms, it is the production 
and transmission of knowledge that is in the process of transformation. The 
object is finally the governance of our society that needs to be re-thought, 
including ethics rules to be developed for previously unexplored areas.

The Second Wave of the Technology 
System Transforms and Reorganizes  
the Economy and Social Systems 
The great technological transformation and its very deep innovation 
movement have generated a proliferation of new products and services, 
which in turn have generated new forms of consumption in unprecedented 
market mechanisms. This configuration is in the process of changing means 
of production, productivity rhythm, the structure of prices, costs and profits; 
it brings about new business models, which strongly accelerate the 
accumulation of capital. At the same time, this powerful technological 
movement has disrupted the relative contributions of capital and labor and 
has challenged workers’ skills and trade structures, inducing, in parallel, the 
erosion of salary employment for the benefit of precarious forms of activity. 
Nevertheless, this transformational movement is at the moment challenging 
the current forms of globalization and the international division of labor, as it 
leads to cancel out the relative cost advantage, mainly in terms of wages, of 
emerging countries, which may jeopardize the tendency for sustained growth 
that many emerging countries have experienced for the past two decades. 
However, this social transformation induced by this technological 
innovation movement is not limited to the economic sphere; it is re-shaping 
the process of knowledge production, with the alteration of forms of research 
and development. At the same time, the profound disruption of training and

132     The Ongoing Technological System 
teaching activities can be noted, and even forms of governance or ethical 
requirements are renewed by this intense movement of technological 
innovation. 
It is this range of results of the technological transformation on economic 
and social operations, together with the requirements that they generate, 
which we will explain in the following. 
6.1. New markets, new industries, new business models 
6.1.1. New products, re-composition of products and functions, 
new markets 
This technological innovation wave challenges the range of products and 
services offered, and this is achieved in several different manners. 
6.1.1.1. Creative destruction and disappearance of traditional 
products and markets 
Goods originating from a condemned technology disappear within the 
“creative destruction” process identified by Schumpeter [SCH 39] and 
observed in every major technological transformation. Thus, for example, 
digital storage media, that is, the floppy disk, the CD, which had constituted 
the external storage and transmission media for files until the late 1990s, 
disappeared quickly thereafter. Their transmission function became partly 
useless due to generalized networking, and their storage and backup 
functions were replaced by a single hardware mobile medium, based on new 
flash memory technology, the USB stick, whose usage is today much more 
partial than previous physical media, because data backup is based on cloud 
storage systems. 
A parallel disruption has impacted audio-visual leisure media for the 
general public. Music, video or even games, which have long been available 
by means of physical media, are now made available online through  
download, causing the collapse of the market for these products. Often 
illegal, the generalization of free access to these services raises questions 
about producers’ remuneration and thereby about the sustainability of  
this activity. This problem has even resulted in several countries  
establishing repression legislation for pirate downloads and the defense of 
copyright law [NAU 16]. 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      133 
6.1.1.2. Creation of new products and services, functional 
deployment, new uses 
Totally new services and products have appeared on the market, 
introducing new features in new markets; we identified and described them 
in the previous chapter. 
In a recent French advertising clip for a new vehicle, the central slogan 
translates to “invent the way of living that goes with it”. The characteristic of 
the recent technological deployment, to a larger extent than in previous 
periods, is to generate new functions and transform uses. One of the major 
forms of innovation, particularly in the past 10 years, is the generation of 
these new functionalities taken into account or recombined by new 
technological configurations. 
New products and services recombine themselves due to this convergence 
phenomenon, which is a feature of this innovation movement. The most 
complete example is obviously the cell phone, which has become the 
smartphone, the mobile form of the telephone as well as of the Internet 
terminal, and has therefore become the medium for text creation, music and 
video terminals and an access point to all Web services. A complete 
redefinition of the range of digital terminals between the PC, tablet and 
smartphone is also underway. 
One of the examples of this is geolocalization which itself makes the 
dynamization of networks possible. Another new highly technical function is 
remote surgery, an extreme form, because it is enabled by automation and 
intelligence, teleworking or working at a distance, which had started  
to develop as early as the 1980s. This transformation of functions and uses  
through technological innovation is found in areas related to personal life 
with the real-time collection of individual physiological data. This process 
has an impact on medical practice, which is able to support medical 
therapeutic apparatus by making a massive database of patients’ personal 
health information available. 
6.1.1.3. A new combination of products and services 
It may also consist of the combination of hardware products with a 
service environment, itself digitalized, which are referred to as augmented 
products. These products and services are now enhanced with computerized 
functions such as connectivity, interactivity and data exchange that allow for 
operational optimization and remote maintenance. 

134     The Ongoing Technological System 
This reconstruction massively concerns services; a multitude of “living” 
services are now in a number of areas such as sales, rentals or even 
employment, performed by digital media, platforms and software 
applications. 
The expansion of new forms of markets in computerized networks, 
replacing traditional commercial networks, is particularly lively, and its 
efficiency is recognized in the second-hand market and even in some forms 
of management of the employment market. 
It also involved the appropriation of certain banking activities by 
technological operators, including the entire development of online banks, or 
forms of concentrated monetary circulation, into a new converging one, on 
the smartphone. 
During this last period, technological innovation has introduced functions 
in service activities to the complex sector of transportation. This was 
achieved through the deployment of self-organizing collective transport by 
means of computer applications for the management of carpooling or for the 
reorganization of taxi activity with the management of the activity of a fleet 
of private cars as a public transport fleet. The latter resulted in a process 
called “uberization” derived from Uber, the name of the company that 
implemented it. 
6.1.2. A sectorial re-composition of economies 
The massive combination of products and services induces a questioning 
of conventional sectorial boundaries and of the nature of dominant operators 
in a number of areas. The technical systems produced make use of different 
key technologies, resulting in the providers of these new technologies 
assuming control of a sector. 
Thus, the computer electronics industry was managed in the entire first 
period of the third technological system by major electronics hardware 
manufacturers such as IBM and Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. This 
dominance has been completely replaced today, except for Apple, by major 
producers of software and digital applications such as Google, Amazon and 
Facebook. 
 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      135 
The dominance of computerized technical systems connected in a certain 
number of large products and systems results in the fact that the operators of 
these areas are the ones who take control of traditionally mechanical sectors, 
such as shipbuilding. For instance, BAE and Thales have become the prime 
contractors of French–British naval constructions. The dominant IT firms are 
gradually taking control of the car industry, of which the design of a new 
generation of cars, often electric and automated, is starting to be dominated 
by the major organizations such as Apple and Google. 
6.1.3. New consumption patterns, new marketing methods 
More and more, trade tends to be achieved through new distribution 
modes without intermediaries (based on a digital platform) which will 
constitute a distribution service that adjusts supply and demand, by 
increasing the degree of availability of the product, as well as the 
information about it. This new type of distribution, for example, contributes 
to bringing products and services that were not previously available or no 
longer there back into the market, such as out-of-print books and antiques 
that were impossible to commercialize so generally. These platforms can be 
general, such as the large and well-known Amazon platform, or a multitude 
of platforms specialized in the distribution of music for example, including 
media such as YouTube, Spotify, second-hand platforms such as “Le bon 
coin” in France, platforms for the exchange of services such as Airbnb for 
the exchange of housing and the numerous carpooling platforms. 
This type of market achieves a very fine adjustment between supply and 
demand; in a way it realizes the optimal market of “perfect competition” 
dear to traditional economists. 
This renewal of services will result in the transformation of acquisition 
modes which will evolve from hardware purchases to function acquisition by 
rental; this no longer concerns the purchase of the product but that of the 
function, often measured by its functional unit (kilometers traveled, number 
of landings, etc.). Cloud computing reflects this shift of trend in information 
technology: because instead of acquiring computing power through the 
acquisition of hardware and software, consumers utilize capabilities made 
available to them, rented by a supplier via networks. 

136     The Ongoing Technological System 
6.1.4. New business models 
This product renewal widely re-structures the functioning of markets for 
companies. With information technology, an activity can generate several 
forms of joint value for different users, apart from the main user, such as the 
value of advertising space or of the supply of additional data. Therefore, the 
payment of the total value will be ensured by the different users of this value 
and pricing will thus be distributed over the various beneficiaries of 
components of this value. In this new business model, the user is no longer 
the exclusive payer, as in traditional customer–supplier systems, and users of 
the central value eligible for free goods or services are even now 
remunerated by beneficiaries of ancillary services. Several convergent 
operators will thus contribute to financing the activity, which is consequently 
fully capitalized, therefore contributing to easier finance and increased 
profitability. 
In addition, these markets are fine-tuned by companies on the basis of the 
greater importance of customer orientation. It is based on a detailed and real-
time analysis of segmentation, of knowledge of customer expectations and 
their satisfaction feedback. This new operational marketing method relies on 
massive data collection and processing to build customer loyalty, refine the 
demand, optimize its supply, increase customer proximity and even better 
understand their clients’ intentions or those of other companies (B2B, B2C) 
in order to provide new services and products at the right time. 
Business strategy is therefore transformed with the new generation of 
strategic models in terms of “business models” that take this new business 
ecology complexity into account [MOO 01]. 
6.1.5. New form of competition, new concentration 
Despite a competitive opening of markets due to information technology, 
which we presented previously, a very strong concentration can be observed 
in new markets as can be seen in the four major markets of the digital 
economy. Each one is an extremely dominant operator in its market: Apple 
on digital devices, Amazon on sales platforms, Facebook on social networks 
and Google, which having started as a search engine became dominant on a 
global scale and has now become a universal information technology 
operator with 197 companies producing software, Android mobile 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      137 
applications and sites as well as support for computer security or even smart 
products1. 
Before the advent of computing, when markets were segmented and  
the viscosity of the economy was higher, the relative differences in 
performance between different suppliers often structured their market share 
proportionally. Through information technology, a company can reach 
billions of consumers, by means of multiple channels and multiple versions. 
As a result, the relative advantage of the former compared to competitors 
becomes gigantic, creating the “winner-takes-all” phenomenon, which might 
be an excessive expression, but one which has made a fortune [FRA 96]. 
Because of the dissemination and notoriety effect, the largest part of demand 
focuses on the leader and quickly collapses for second-order producers. 
This position is strengthened and enhanced by the production and 
reproduction conditions of the digital economy. The latter allows a “zero 
marginal cost” massive reproduction of the product or service concerned 
[RIF 14], or more precisely a low marginal cost, which means that the once 
fixed costs have been covered and each marginal unit costs almost nothing to 
produce [BAK 00]. This considerably strengthens the profitability conditions 
of the leader and reinforces its position. Google represents a fine example of 
this mechanism. 
Therefore, the productive and competitive conditions originating from the 
ongoing technological transformation have a tendency to reinforce the 
concentration of the economy, despite the inverse movement of the 
multiplication of startups created to avail the niches generated by this wave 
of innovation. 
6.2. Disruption of the production system 
6.2.1. The evolution of productivity 
Productivity growth during the period 2000–2015 is comparable to that of 
the second technological system, in its second phase, whereas in its initial 
phase, the rate of increase was lower because of a gap observed between the

138     The Ongoing Technological System 
implementation of new generic technologies, the first to change and to cause 
the global technological transformation, and complementary application 
technologies whose development takes longer. 
 
Figure 6.1. Productivity growth compared between  
the second and third technological system [BRY 14] 
Their generalized implementation is accompanied by the re-structuring of 
the organization, making it coherent with the new technological system2. 
This is the culmination of this adjustment process, which recent works 
evaluate with a duration of 5–7 years, which will then generate a massive 
increase in productivity [BRY 14]. This process is currently at work with the 
computerized transformation of the productive activity. 
6.2.2. Productivity and employment 
Despite the new innovation wave raising productivity levels globally, it 
strongly disrupts the structure of activities and thus that of employment.  
The wave of new computer technologies, automates activity phases  
or even whole professions, ERPs, accounting and organizational  
 
 
                                        
2 In the technological system of electricity, it is the scientific organization of work permitted 
by the electrification of the factory and the transformation of the machine into an autonomous 
electric unit, which has allowed for the re-composition of the productive system as shown in 
Chapter 3. 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      139 
processing software solutions, as well as the digitalization of documents, 
drastically minimize administrative staff. Within the same perspective, the 
automation of factories and logistics reduces the number of industrial jobs. 
However, the specific transformation introduced by the current wave is the 
development of smart digital devices able to perform analytical work 
previously essentially human, such as, for example, maintenance or 
intermediation (real estate agents, experts in insurance, etc.). The new wave 
of digitalization of the economy threatens and replaces intermediate 
qualification jobs [SCH 17]. 
On the contrary, these new technologies, through the new activities that 
they will be able to create, generate new skilled or highly qualified jobs 
(computer system engineers, multimedia engineers, big data processing 
specialists, environmental engineers, etc.). In addition, as has been 
highlighted by the “surplus theory”, productivity gains generate an economic 
surplus that is re-used in the creation of new types of previously non-existing 
jobs [SAU 80]. 
Consequently, the ongoing technological transformation polarizes the 
structure of employment, in skilled and highly qualified jobs, by removing a 
lot of average qualification jobs, continuing and enhancing the automation of 
routine tasks. On the contrary, it re-assesses complex human tasks of 
regulation and social support – direction management, doctors, psychologists 
and so on [FRE 13]. 
6.2.3. A polarization of the distribution of income 
This new distribution of jobs contributes to generating a very polarized 
distribution of unemployment and income according to these types of 
professions and skills. In addition, the generalized digitalization of the 
economy increases the weight and importance of capital in the face of work. 
The distribution of income is affected for several years: the share of wages 
that reached nearly 50% of the GDP in the United States in the 1980s fell to 
43% in 2012, while the share of profits increased, during the same period, by 
3.5%, from its lowest point in 1987 to 11% in 2012 [BRY 14]. 
This second wave of innovation is thus generating a massive increase in 
income inequality. 

140     The Ongoing Technological System 
6.2.4. A globalized technological system, a possible bifurcation 
The technological transformation of the past three decades had favored, 
through a broad globalization movement of the economy, a massive influx of 
industrial relocation toward emerging countries. This movement of industrial 
migration was related to an uncoupling of the phases inside the productive 
chain between the upstream conception, the understanding of customer 
relationships and its distribution phase [COH 06], resulting in “the middle 
stage, that of manufacturing becoming obsolete and capable of being 
externalized” [MAU 01]. A new division of labor had been established with 
a number of countries and economies able to capture this new necessity in 
more developed economies, to find operators capable of providing this 
industrial production at the lowest cost. Since the late 1970s, a whole series 
of geographical areas and countries have become specialized in these types 
of industrial activities. This international specialization has provided the 
basis for the considerable economic expansion that this extrovert 
industrialization produced, based not only on low wages but more generally 
on the low cost of labor originating from its extensive exploitative 
conditions. South-East Asia, of which primarily China, Taiwan, South Korea 
but also the Indian subcontinent countries and now Indochinese and 
Malaysian regions, Latin America, and part of North Africa have seen their 
economy completely re-configured by this type of development. 
However, the latest wave of technological transformation, in particular 
new massively automated forms of production make these productions less 
sensitive to the differential wage cost. Tighter coupling between design, 
production, distribution and adaptation phases to increased requirements of 
demand and especially tighter quality requirements and enhanced 
environmental standards, shortened product lifecycles and the multiplication 
of varieties and seasonal variations are all factors increasingly less 
compatible with a distant production. This leads companies to repatriate this 
production phase to developed countries as part of a “relocation” process 
[PIP 13]. This study evaluates, in the case of France, 10% of companies 
having delocalized, the portion of them to have recently relocated part of 
their production. This relocation is also, during the period in question, 
reinforced by at least three linked economic factors: the increase in wage 
costs in emerging countries, especially in China, strong growth in domestic 
demand and consequently the absorption of part of the production exported 
by domestic consumption. The increase in transportation costs also has its 
share [EL 14]. 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      141 
Technological change may therefore be likely to rule out industrial 
benefits acquired by emerging and developing countries, significantly 
reducing, if not draining, the open industrialization movement that had 
helped them and altering the international division of labor, causing 
numerous young industrialized countries, such as China recently, to re-focus 
on their domestic market. 
Another transformation of the new technological evolution, the tendency 
toward energy re-composition driven by the environmental transition, may, 
at the same time, dramatically re-shape the economy of countries that have 
based their development on the massive supply of fossil fuels and oil in 
particular. 
Therefore, the productive changes brought about by the technological 
transformation movement, such as the re-configuration of the energy 
structure of the activity that accompanies it, will probably reorganize the 
international division of labor, which had been structured in the first phase of 
the technological system, dissociating the industrial growth in emerging 
countries from that of developed countries. The growth of these countries 
might then become restricted to the rate of growth of the satisfaction of their 
domestic demand by their domestic industry. This is true, provided that these 
economies are not in turn invaded by the production of developed countries 
made again competitive by their technological advantage. A revival of 
protectionism may result thereof, which, in this case, would not originate 
from developed countries. 
6.3. New modes of economy 
6.3.1. Growth paradoxes 
6.3.1.1. The apparent failure of growth 
Despite the powerful generation movement of new goods and services 
made available to users, and the creation of new activities that allow for their 
production and distribution, economic growth and the increase of 
productivity are not experiencing a sustained trend [SCH 17]. Some analysts 
have developed a structural interpretation according to which the current 
technological movement, especially due to its immaterial nature, would have 
weak effects in terms of increase in wealth creation, and in any case much 
less than previous technological transformations. They have established the 
thesis that these phenomena are structural, generating what economists call 

142     The Ongoing Technological System 
“a secular stagnation phase” resulting from the “depletion of technical 
progress” [GOR 16]. 
6.3.1.2. The hypothesis of a transitional technological adjustment 
However, this can also be explained as being a transitory phenomenon, as 
it was known in each technological revolution, and which, first, has led to an 
economic crisis. This is mainly because the effect of this technological 
transformation starts by producing negative results, namely the destruction 
of part of the former activities, and the implementation of the positive effects 
of the new technological system takes time. It is likely that negative 
developments currently observed in terms of both growth and employment 
are related to this technical economic transitional process. 
6.3.1.3. The interpretation by the loss of exchange value 
Several explanations are given for this paradox, particularly because 
much of the actual value of new products and services have a decreasing cost 
and are often free of charge; they therefore are not integrated into economic 
accounting. Therefore, it is not material growth or increased productivity 
that is declining, but monetary accounting in terms of conventional national 
accountability. In fact, innovative goods and services “... have much better 
functionality but they are situated in markets radically different from those 
that are usually measured” [SCH 17]. The specific forms of new activities 
generated by the technological wave generate usage values that are not 
recorded as exchange value. The conjunction of the expansion of products 
and services in informational form, new modes of production having zero 
marginal cost [RIF 14] and the sharing economy are largely the source of 
this loss of value. Subsequently, the failure of the measuring system would 
then more easily explain this slowing growth phenomenon, since this 
development rather reflects the inadequacy of our economic accounting 
system than an effective decrease of activity. 
6.3.2. The issue of value, the GDP crisis, the renewal of the 
accountability of the economy 
Because of the growing de-materialization of supply, the opportunities 
for the reproduction of such goods at zero marginal cost contribute to a 
significant decrease in the price of these goods, namely music, press and 
publishing-related, or for intermediation services. Furthermore this 
mechanism is partly accompanied by free access to these goods, such as 
through downloads, or the appropriation of their price by a user of a joint 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      143 
value of that product or service – data, advertising space and so on; 
therefore, a large portion of consumption, or even of investment, escapes its 
traditional evaluation as a price. A large part of the value created in the 
economy is no longer expressed as a price. The value that the consumer can 
access – the usage value – is no longer in correspondence with its exchange 
value, or with the economic value expressed as price. This is probably one of 
the reasons behind the stabilization observed in the growth of developed 
countries. The growth represented by the trend of the GDP no longer takes 
most of the value generated in the economy into account. 
This relative decrease in economic growth is also due to these new 
processes and services – including control and optimization hardware or 
software, up to carpooling platforms – which result in reducing material 
consumption and thus tend to indicate a reduction of the effective activity. 
Apart from the apparently “depressive” effect of this phenomenon, this 
retraction corresponds in fact to taking into account the energy and material 
efficiency of the operation of the economic apparatus, a dimension that was 
relatively ignored in the traditional economic system, which was only 
concerned with factor productivity. 
This new mode of economic functioning, with this crisis of GDP, initiates 
a reflection on how to account for economic activity. It also opens up the 
possibility of developing a method for economy accountability that 
integrates the measure of its material and energy efficiency made necessary 
by the current situation of strong environmental constraints [STI 10]. 
6.4. Interaction with social dynamics 
6.4.1. Upheaval of the organization and in work relationships 
6.4.1.1. Transformation of the organization: major changes in work 
and knowledge relationships 
This deployment of new ways of doing things, conditioned by new 
technical and functional systems, will transform work relationships and 
therefore organizational and legal forms of human activity. In the production 
sector, for example, a major innovation current is based on 3D printing, or 
additive manufacturing, which makes it possible to extend the opportunities 
for personal manufacturing of objects in very small quantities. 

144     The Ongoing Technological System 
6.4.1.2. Change in work relationships, the disappearance of 
intermediation, the questioning of the wage system, uberization 
We have already referred to these transformations in the field of market 
and business relationships. We are currently witnessing the partial 
replacement of employment relations by service provider relations within a 
customer–supplier relationship adjusted to the activity of the firm. The 
digital revolution considerably promotes the development of on-demand 
work as part of a customer–supplier relationship with independent workers, 
which are now required to perform extremely fragmented tasks obeying 
some kind of externalized Taylorism. 
This is a new transformation of work toward extreme flexibility, because 
it allows the labor market to be accessed by anyone who possesses an 
Internet terminal. This is done under a customer–supplier relationship free of 
any long-term commitment. This formula can be favorable to the 
profitability and competitiveness of companies; however, it can generate 
precarious working conditions and correlated decrease in income. This is 
also accompanied by the atomization and de-contextualization of the task for 
these workers, in addition, there is not a sustainable work community, which 
should ensure a sense of belonging and meaning to the work. 
6.4.2. Renewal and reorganization of R&D 
The current technological movement is also in the process of 
transforming methods of knowledge production. These are new means that 
the digital revolution provides, such as new forms of collective mobilization, 
the re-orientation of research trajectories, especially under pressure from 
environmental constraints, toward new paradigms. 
First, the digital revolution has considerably expanded the possibility of 
understanding reality, for the generation of new knowledge and 
technologies, through the simulation of reality, through systemic, dynamic 
and interactive mechanisms of reproduction of reality, and enabling visions 
and knowledge that previously had been impossible. In addition, simulation 
devices have the advantage of significantly reducing the cost of R&D 
processes. 
 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      145 
The explosion of computing performance has created another leap 
forward in knowledge methods, through the ability to capture, store and 
process huge amounts of data. This opportunity that we have previously 
described as being inherent to so-called big data or processing of massive 
data adds to traditional scientific methods a new approach and a new 
mechanism for the mass production of knowledge, through inductive 
knowledge obtained from processing data. 
These new means of scientific and technical discovery, implemented for 
the creation of new devices, are later supported, through interconnection, by 
feedback from users such that they either allow for the optimization of the 
system, by means of correcting the deficiencies observed in duty, or by its 
enhancement by the permanent acquisition of real-time situation data. 
Research has also expanded by means of interconnection in the form  
of “crowdsourcing”, or as what is known in another sector as “open 
innovation”. Therefore, the example of Innocentive, an American online 
exchange center specializing in scientific issues, mentioned by Brynjolffson 
for the case of NASA, which in this way has been able to improve its ability 
to predict the evolution of solar eruptions, of which it had no tangible results 
despite 35 years of research. Nonetheless, a particular characteristic of the 
result, the ability to forecast Solar Particle Events with 85% reliability from 
an 8 h window and 75% accuracy from a 24 h window, is that it was found 
by an engineer fascinated by this problem but specialized in radio. This form 
of mobilization of means for research finds significant resources in 
consultation with a broad community, providing diversity and relying on the 
idea that discovery is not necessarily achieved by a scientist or an expert 
inventor in the domain of the problem addressed. “The more we work on it, 
the more powerful the combinations that we find will be”, reveals this 
second characteristic of the system: “They have also discovered that the best 
solutions were more likely to be found by people whose area of expertise 
was distant from the field under consideration” [BRY 14]. This capability of 
open mobilization of different expertise turns it into a generator of diversity, 
making it possible to engage this powerful innovation, recombination 
engine, which Koestler has conceptualized as bissociation [KOE 64]. 
 

146     The Ongoing Technological System 
6.4.3. The educational model crisis and new ways of training 
If the “digital revolution” is the origin of multiple resources and 
innovative training materials, it is at the basis of a profound crisis in 
traditional teaching that somehow underlies its in-depth transformation. This 
crisis is initially manifested by the resistance from learners to the traditional 
action of teachers and the rejection of its educational forms: lectures, vertical 
transmission of knowledge and monopolistic transmission mode of 
undisputed knowledge. Even the possibilities offered by new communication 
technologies – especially the Internet – are challenging the masterful and 
discursive predominance of knowledge transmission. 
This challenge originates typically less from a disruption of the training 
process by information technology-based teaching resources now made 
available for training, than from the fact that the learners’ population is itself 
familiarized with the digital world. As a result, these learners are accustomed 
to another more immediate and more active way for accessing information 
[LAR 16], thus disqualifying traditional training methods that previous 
generations accepted and to which they had actively adhered. 
In turn, this disruption in adhesion decreases the effectiveness of the 
system: “Activating among many teachers fears of failure, rejection, or 
obsolescence, these technologies struggle to find their place within 
educational practices while digital content and tools available to the general 
public are booming” [BEL 10, p. 35]. 
Furthermore, a profound transformation takes place with MOOCs3, 
networked learning, multimedia support or immersive technologies that 
allow for the parallel usage of several learning channels. However, the 
introduction of these educational technologies requires and supports an 
upheaval in educational practices and doctrines. The new ways are based on 
the learner’s activity and autonomy, the collaborative practice of learning 
and reverse pedagogy and the teacher’s intervention as a guide and facilitator 
rather than provider of formed knowledge [PAQ 09]. Because of the  
 
 
 
 
 
                                        
3 Although MOOCs could be regarded as a transitional form of support enhancing the 
effectiveness of a discursive and masterful method for knowledge transmission. 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      147 
complex nature of this process, the organization supporting the diversity of 
practices in a transformative education becomes more than ever a 
pedagogical component. 
This transformation is all the more imperative as the need for the training 
of the entire population has increased 10-fold due to the necessities of the 
regeneration competences needed by the technological transition. 
6.4.4. Governance crisis and search for new rules 
6.4.4.1. Governance crisis and requirements for new regulation 
The new world of technology and its societal consequences call into 
question the traditionally accepted forms of public governance. Several new 
conditions are generated by current upheavals. The novelty in these 
situations means that states and governments are relatively unprepared when  
confronted with developments or unforeseen events of which governments 
have no far superior insight than most of their citizens; these citizens are 
more than ever able to access information and organize themselves with the 
help of digital platforms in particular. At the same time, this relative 
powerlessness partly explains both the political crisis and the political form 
of response that we are witnessing more and more, often from the 
generalized digital consultation of citizens by political authorities to produce 
any relevant analyses to facilitate efficient policy measures. Nevertheless, 
contemporary states are subject to a decrease of their transformative capacity 
on society due to the multiplication of new micro-powers of organized 
citizens, who contest the action of states and are capable of hampering it 
[GAR 16] or even of partially assuming the regalian right of money creation, 
through the creation of electronic currency such as “bitcoin” [CEN 16]. 
In addition, this situation is worsened by an acceleration of the 
informational time and of the pressure for immediate reaction, which creates 
a tendency for ill-prepared hasty political responses, often incomplete and 
generally inadequate. 
Yet states have already showed a tendency to rely on the possibilities of 
digital technology to improve the functioning of their administration by 
reforming structures toward greater efficiency, responsiveness and 
simplicity, accompanied by a considerable reduction of costs. In addition, 
this action is currently increasing the transparency of the functioning of these 
states with respect to citizens. At the same time, through the controlling of 

148     The Ongoing Technological System 
digital technologies at the internal level, these states have a considerable 
surveillance and control capacities which make them likely to preserve their 
power. 
And yet, because of its economic consequences for employment, income 
distribution and the concentration of wealth, where the role of the state as a 
regulator must be renewed, this second massive innovation phase is the 
perfect time to build new ways of governance. These should be fully 
supported by the digitalization of the economy and must promote the 
development of innovation. They must favor interventionist action to correct 
employment and income distribution distortions, in order to harmoniously 
sustain social transitions induced by technological transformation. 
6.4.4.2. Ethical issues, new realities and new rules 
This massive wave of innovation leads us to master three fields that it 
pushes to the limits, namely that of information, artificial intelligence and 
life. It is mainly with these three areas that new ethical issues are concerned: 
– The ethics of information: 
The possibility of acquiring and processing massive data, to track 
individuals, invade their privacy as well as disclose it massively raises the 
problem of defending the private space [ISA 16]. Yet this new information 
system is at the origin of two contradictory trends: that of universal 
knowledge centralized by central authorities capable of enforcing 
generalized surveillance and, at the same time, the capability, more powerful 
and generalized than ever, of individuals to access information on all levels 
of social life, as the phenomena of whistleblowers has demonstrated. It 
should be noted that numerous cases raise the question of ethics in 
information and surveillance on behalf of states and powers and that of 
ethics regarding personal freedom and privacy when facing uncontrolled and 
imposed transparency [BRU 01]. 
– The ethics of intelligence: 
Now related to the transformation of information into more or less 
advanced forms of intelligence, concerning robotic systems capable of 
autonomy, self-learning or even self-programming, the problem there arises 
of the limits of this intelligence and of the awareness of these risks that 
artificial intelligence can at some time escape human control. 
 
 

Transformation and Reorganization of the Economy and Social Systems      149 
– The ethics of life: 
Finally, we are reaching extraordinary performance to now modify the 
course of life, including opportunities for genetic engineering but also with 
the perspective opened to us to recreate life, to create artificial life. 
Nowadays, this poses such ethical problems that regulations have been taken 
about genetically modified organisms (GMOs), such as stem cells, and the 
creation of artificial life. Nevertheless, subsequent exploration and 
discussions are still ongoing for the construction of action rules to govern 
situations that are at the boundary of our social and self-conscious awareness 
[KAH 04]. 
As a result of a huge technological change, it is possible to measure the 
effects of such a change first on society, then on the national and global 
economy and finally on several levels of society, from education to political 
regulation. The conclusion will introduce the ultimate question of this 
analysis: how can this major transformation be characterized? Is it still, as 
we have presented it throughout this work, a deployment phase of the third 
technological system, or is it a real new technological revolution? 

Conclusion 
The Future of the  
Contemporary Technological  
System: Continuity or Disruption? 
Is the major technological movement currently in place a new 
deployment of the contemporary technological system, or is it the beginning 
of a major technological disruption, and consequently, the end of the third 
technological system, in other words, a true technological revolution giving 
rise to a new system? 
Theses of a technological revolution 
The wave of technological change that intervened in this first decade of 
the 21st Century sparked a series of work on its characterization. Oddly 
enough, this movement has been defined by Jeremy Rifkin as the emergence 
of the third industrial revolution in a book of the same title [RIF 11].  
This revolution would occur now, according to Rifkin, because the 
predominant use of fossil fuels, which is a characteristic of the second 
industrial system, has only recently been disputed and reduced. The other 
area characterizing the old technological system is the slow and centralized 
communication system which would have been only partially transformed. 
The stability of what the author calls the energy–communication system 
would have kept the world within the second industrial system, formed at the

152     The Ongoing Technological System 
end of the 19th Century, which would have continued to the present day. At 
present, it is the emergence of a new system of energy–communication 
relationships characterized as the “junction of Internet communication and 
renewable energies which creates a third industrial revolution” [RIF 12,  
p. 57]. 
This classification leads to much ambiguity as it is characterized by the 
use of the notion of industrial revolution, imprecise and referring to second-
order activities with respect to the structure and to the technological 
development of society. In addition, the notion of industrial revolution, 
which has been considered as the first English technological revolution of 
the 18th Century and then by analogy the formation of the second 
technological system at the end of the 19th Century, are particularly unsuited 
to the contemporary technological and productive system. This latter has 
somehow marked the end of the industrial system itself, characterized by an 
essentially material mass production, developing within a hierarchical and 
centralized organization. The reflection of this bifurcation can again be seen 
in the appearance, at the beginning of the 1970s, of the concept of  
post-industrial society1, to describe the new productive society, which  
began a radical disruption with the production methods, Taylorist and  
Fordist systems2 that had been developed during the two previous 
technological systems. In addition, this presentation characterizes the  
big technological transformation of the 1970–1980s as being part of the 
second technological system, contributing to perpetuate it by modernizing it. 
This thesis minimizes and ignores the character of technological disruption 
of this period, which precisely ended this second technological system. 
Another more recent essay, The Fourth Industrial Revolution by Klaus 
Schwab [SCH 17], also considers this period of revolution3. Analyzing the  
technologies of that era, Schwab expresses disruption by stating: “It is their 
always increasing complexity and their integration that moves away from the 
third revolution industrial, and which transforms companies and the global 
economy”4. This notion of revolution differs from Rifkin, because it

industrial system, see Chapter 3.

revolution.

Conclusion     153 
recognizes the specific character of the third system, from the 1970s up until 
today. Nonetheless, this notion of revolution also focuses analysis on the 
forms of implementation of the technology, on the transformation of the 
productive system and other levels of society. The big objection to the 
relevance of this characterization of a new technological revolution is that 
these large current transformations always rely on the cluster of generic 
technologies – information technologies, biotechnologies, new materials, or 
multi-energies – which had opened way for the third technological system of 
the 1970s, and which continue to organize our current technological system. 
The thesis of a continuation of the third technological system 
Hence, the thesis, which these transformations so numerous, powerful 
and structuring of society that we are observing in the current period, forms 
a continuity and a new deployment of the third technological system that 
appeared 40 years ago. This movement constitutes a fantastic acceleration 
and enhancement of an innovation stream permanently supported by the 
sources of technological progress still brought by the generic technologies of 
this technological system. At the heart of which we find information 
technology, which despite predictions about the “end of Moore’s law”, 
continues its exponential performance progression now at considerable 
scales. 
Finally, the theory of the continuity of the contemporary technological 
system is based on two simple assertions: if the generic technology of the 
system does not change, the system persists; if it is able to push forward the 
technological limits of its generic technologies, the system persists. 
This would radically support that the current powerful innovation 
movement always constitutes the second wave of the third technological 
system, of the contemporary technological system. 
Signs of new generic technologies 
Nonetheless, it can be observed that there are signs that might signal a 
technological revolution, due to reaching the limits of generic technology of 
the contemporary technological system. 

154     The Ongoing Technological System 
Limit and replacement of generic information processing 
technology 
However, a major disruption has been anticipated within information 
technology, which is driven by the exhaustion of the capacity for evolution 
of microelectronics for information processing, somehow reflecting the 
effective implementation of “the end of Moore’s law” [COL 02]. Without 
calling into question the status of information technology and even probably 
by allowing its growth, microelectronics will have to give way to other 
alternative information processing technologies. Several technologies have 
successively appeared as candidates to its succession. As early as the 1990s, 
photonics emerged as a possible support for the creation of the “light 
computer”; however, the inability of this technology to store information in 
optical form has resulted in the process being abandoned. At present, it is a 
quantum-based technology that appears the new most likely relevant 
information technology to succeed microelectronics [MON 16]. 
The hypothesis of fusion energy 
Fusion energy is another technology that could completely disrupt the 
energy sector, by creating a new generic technology; despite the fact that its 
mastery has been sought after for several decades, it is beginning to show 
signs of promising development (see Chapter 5). 
On the contrary, these technologies are still under development in very 
limited numbers, with a time frame far too remote to generate a 
technological system metamorphosis. 
The hypothesis of a technological revolution, the shift towards a 
new synergistic technology system, by qualitative leaps 
We have identified the set of five forces of technological transformation 
that constitute the drivers of the current technological movement: namely 
computing performance, generalized digitalization, universal connection, 
nanometric transformation and the environmental transition. These forces are 
at the same time structuring forces which generate a movement of 
convergence and synergy between technologies, especially the generic 
technologies of the contemporary system. 

Conclusion     155 
It is easy to imagine that at a certain development level, a qualitative leap 
is triggered, involving the constitution of generic mega-technologies and 
thus achieving the grouping, the interconnection and the structural synergy 
of several original technologies. It can already be seen to be emerging with 
the massive complex of intelligence-related technologies, as with 
increasingly more inter-connected biology and intelligence complexes. The 
latter could ultimately be generalized, thus creating a new type of 
technological system, no longer organized on unit technologies representing 
ways of transforming nature and society, but by means of synergistic 
aggregates of technologies performing complex functions. As a result, its 
power would increase tenfold. 
However, despite development conditions already being perceived, this 
assumption is still far from reaching its production start. We are still in the 
third technological system; it still shows the potential for innovation and a 
surprising transforming power. The last factor for a tenfold increase in 
power of the contemporary technological system is its global character. The 
contemporary technological system is the only historical system to be 
deployed on a global scale. This globalization of technological development 
is an accelerator of technological innovation, as a result of its effect of 
diversity and the variability of the classes of technological problems to be 
solved according to diverse development areas, as shown, for example, by 
the dramatic intensity of the environmental problems generated by the rapid 
industrialization of developing countries. Globalization could play a role of 
accelerator by scale effect, through the massive multiplication of operators 
of technological development on a global level. 
If there is a new fourth technological system, accompanied by a 
qualitative technology leap, or renewed development of the third 
technological system with new combinations of existing technologies, such 
is the question that only the future can answer.
