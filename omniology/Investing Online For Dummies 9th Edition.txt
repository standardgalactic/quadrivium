ou might be wondering why you need a book like this one to help you 
invest online. After all, if you’re looking for information about investing 
online, you can certainly type investing online into a search engine and get 
thousands of search results.
But that’s the problem. You’ll get thousands of search results. Some of the 
sites you’ll find using a search engine might have secret agendas and push 
financial products hazardous to your goals. Yet other sites offered up by a 
search engine might be filled with bad information, causing you to unknow-
ingly make poor investment decisions. Worse yet, you might stumble on 
fraudulent websites determined to steal your identity or money. Sure, you 
might find some good websites through a web search, but how can you tell 
the good from the bad when you get hundreds, if not thousands, of results?
Along came Investing Online For Dummies, 9th Edition. This book is here to 
act as a down‐to‐earth guide for getting started with online investing. I steer  
you clear of unnecessary investing gobbledygook, and I point you to resources 
that you can trust. I’ve already done all the mucking through the thousands of 
investing websites to find good ones — you shouldn’t have to do so as well!
About this Book
Investing Online For Dummies has been updated and refreshed in this ninth 
edition to be your intelligent guide through this often‐confusing and con-
stantly changing world of investing online. As the author, I can share the 
tricks, tips, and secrets I’ve learned from a career writing about online invest-
ing for readers just like you. This book can save you the trouble of fumbling 
through the Internet looking for the best online resources.
In this edition, you’ll find online sites that may be even more relevant to you 
now if you were scared to death by the vicious financial crisis that raged in 
2008 and 2009. After watching stocks lose more than half their value between 
October 2007 and March 2009, you’re probably more aware than ever of the 
risks of investing. Sadly, some investors allowed their fear to convince them 
to bail out of stocks at just the wrong time. Investors who pulled the ripcord

Investing Online For Dummies 
in March 2009 missed out on a monster rally through 2015 that would have 
more than doubled their money from the trough.
And that’s why this book is so important. If you don’t have a strategy, the 
emotions of fear and greed take over and short‐circuit your reasoning. 
Investing based on emotion is typically a good way to lose money and miss 
opportunities. The Internet can help you keep emotions out of investing, 
and make you a smart and skilled investor. This book shows you how to use 
the information you find online to become a more informed investor who is 
better able to stomach the market’s ups and downs.
Foolish Assumptions
No matter your skill or experience level with investing, you can get something 
out of Investing Online For Dummies. I assume that some readers haven’t 
invested in anything other than baseball cards or Pez dispensers and have 
no clue of where to even start. If that describes you, the first part of the 
book is custom‐made for you and takes extra care to step through all the key 
points in as much plain English as possible. (When I have no choice but to 
use investing jargon, I tell you what it means.) But I also assume that more 
advanced investors might pick this book up, too, looking to discover a few 
things. The book takes on more advanced topics as you progress through it 
and carefully selects online resources that can add new tools to your invest-
ing toolbox.

Investing Online For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a new investor or just getting started investing online, you might 
consider starting from the beginning. That way, you’ll be ready for some of 
the more advanced topics I introduce later in the book. If you’ve already been 
investing online, have a strategy you think is working for you, and are pleased 
with your online broker, you might skip to Part II. And if you’re dying to know 
about a specific topic, there’s nothing wrong with looking up those terms in 
the index and flipping to the appropriate pages.

Part I
Getting Started  
Investing Online
Visit www.dummies.com/extras/investingonline to learn how to choose 
the right brokerage account for online investing, how capital gains are taxed, how to 
open your brokerage account, choosing how to hold your online investments, how online 
investment trading works, how to trade in stocks online, and how to sell stock short.

In this part . . .
The idea of investing online is irresistible to most investors. Low 
trading commissions, cutting out high‐priced brokers, and gaining 
tremendous financial control are all possible with online investing. 
What’s not to like, right?
The trouble, though, for many investors is how to get started. 
Investing online is laden with enough jargon and websites to send 
some beginners running. Consider this part to be your user’s man-
ual on how to get started investing online. You discover everything 
you need to know to get yourself and your computer or other 
device ready to pick, buy, and sell investments online. I go over all 
the key terms you need to know to set up investment accounts, 
pick a broker, and get started. Even more importantly, you discover 
the main ways to invest online and quickly gain the wisdom of 
more experienced investors. You also find the answers to two of 
the most commonly asked questions investors ask me: “How do I 
get started investing online?” and “How much money do I need to 
invest online?”

efore doing something risky, you probably think good and hard about 
what you stand to gain and what you might lose. Surprisingly, many 
online investors, especially those just starting out, lose that innate sense 
of risk and reward. They chase after the biggest possible returns without 
considering the sleepless nights they’ll suffer through as those investments 
swing up and down. Some start buying investments they’ve heard that others 
made money on without thinking about whether those investments are 
appropriate for them. Worst of all, some fall prey to fraudsters who promise 
huge returns in get‐rich‐quick schemes.
So, I’ve decided to start from the top and make sure that the basics are cov-
ered. In this chapter, you discover what you can expect to gain from invest-
ing online — and at what risk — so that you can decide whether this is for 
you. You also find out how to analyze your monthly budget so that you have 
cash to invest in the first place. Lastly, you find out what kind of investor you 
are by using online tools that measure your taste for risk. After you’ve gotten 
to know your inner investor better, you can start thinking about forming an 
online investment plan that won’t give you an ulcer.
It’s only natural if you’re feeling skittish when it comes to investing, espe-
cially if you’re just starting out. After all, it’s been a brutal couple of decades 
even for veteran investors. First came the dot‐com crash in 2000, then the 

8
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
vicious credit crunch in 2008 that threatened to drop‐kick the economy, and 
then a nasty bear market in 2008. The stock market then proceeded to soar 
starting in March 2009, roughly doubling in value through mid‐2012. But even 
that rally wasn’t painless, as the stock market short‐circuited in May 2010, 
due in part to computerized trading, causing its value to plunge and largely 
rally back in just 20 minutes. And in 2015 there’s been a Greek debt crisis and 
fears of a major economic slowdown in China.
Some think all this chaos is just too much to bear and choose to avoid 
stocks altogether. That’s a mistake, though. Prudent investing can be a great 
way for you to reach your financial goals. You just need an approach that 
will maximize your returns while cutting your risks. And that’s where this 
book comes in.
Why Investing Online Is Worth 
Your While
Investing used to be easy. Your friend would recommend a broker. You’d 
give your money to the broker and hope for the best. But today, thanks to the 
explosion of web‐based investment information and low‐cost online trading, 
you get to work a lot harder by taking charge of your investments. Lucky you! 
So, is the additional work worth it? In my opinion, taking the time to figure 
out how to invest online is worthwhile because
✓
✓Investing online saves you money. Online trading is much less expen-
sive than dealing with a broker. You’ll save tons on commissions and 
fees. (Say, why not invest that money you saved?)
✓
✓Investing online gives you more control. Instead of entrusting someone 
else to reach your financial goals, you’ll be personally involved. It’s up to 
you to find out about all the investments at your disposal, but you’ll also 
be free to make decisions.
✓
✓Investing online eliminates conflicts of interest. By figuring out how to 
invest and doing it yourself, you won’t have to worry about being given 
advice that might be in your advisors’ best interest and not yours.
Getting Started
I can’t tell you how many investors just starting out write me and ask the 
exact same question. Maybe it’s the same question that’s running through 
your head right now: “I want to invest, but where do I start?”

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
Getting started in investing seems so overwhelming that some people get 
confused and wind up giving up and doing nothing. Others get taken in by 
promises of gigantic returns and enroll in seminars, subscribe to stock‐picking  
newsletters, or invest in speculative investments like the Facebook initial 
public offering (IPO), hoping to make money overnight, only to be disap-
pointed. Others assume that all they need to do is open a brokerage account 
and start madly buying stocks. But as you’ll notice if you look at the Table 
of Contents or flip ahead in this book, I don’t talk about picking a broker and 
opening an account until Chapter 4. You have many tasks to do before then.
But don’t let that fact intimidate you. Check out my easy‐to‐follow list of 
things you need to do to get started. Follow these directions, and you’ll be 
ready to open an online brokerage account and start trading:
1.	Decide how much you can save and invest.
You can’t invest if you don’t have any money, and you won’t have any 
money if you don’t save. No matter how much you earn, you need to set 
aside some money to start investing. (Think saving is impossible? I show 
you computer and online tools later in this chapter that can help you 
build up savings that you can invest.)
2.	Master the terms.
The world of investing has its own language. I help you to understand 
investingese now so that you don’t get confused in the middle of a trade 
when you’re asked to make a decision about something you’ve never 
heard of. (Chapter 2 has more on the language of online investing.)
3.	Familiarize yourself with the risks and returns of investing.
You wouldn’t jump out of an airplane without knowing the risks, right? 
Don’t jump into investing without knowing what to expect, either. Luckily, 
online resources I show you later in this chapter and in Chapter 8 can help 
you get a feel for how markets have performed over the past 100 years. 
By understanding how stocks, bonds, and other investments have done, 
you’ll know what a reasonable return is and set your goals appropriately.
I can’t stress enough how important this step is. Investors who know 
how investments move don’t panic — they keep their cool even during 
times of volatility. Panic is your worst enemy because it has a way of 
talking you into doing things you’ll regret later.
4.	Get a feel for how much risk you can take.
People all have different goals for their money. You might already have a 
home and a car, in which case you’re probably most interested in saving 
for retirement or building an estate for your heirs. Or perhaps you’re 
starting a family and hope to buy a house within a year. These two sce-
narios call for very different tastes for risks and time horizons — how 
long you’d be comfortable investing money before you need it. You need 

10
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
to know what your taste for risk is before you can invest. I show you 
how to measure your taste for risk later in this chapter.
5.	Understand the difference between being an active and a passive 
investor.
Some investors want to outsmart the market by darting in and out of 
stocks at just the right times or by picking the “best” stocks. Others 
think doing that is impossible and don’t want the hassle of trying. At the 
end of this chapter, you find out how to distinguish between these two 
types of investors, active and passive, so that you’re in a better position 
to choose which one you are.
6.	Find out how to turn your computer into a trading station.
If you have a computer and a connection to the Internet, you have all 
you need to turn it into a source of constant market information. You 
just need to know where to look, which you find out in Chapter 2.
7.	Take a dry run.
Don’t laugh. Many professional money managers have told me they got 
their starts by pretending to pick stocks and tracking how they would 
have performed. It’s a great way to see whether your strategy might 
work, before potentially losing your shirt. You can even do this online, 
which I cover in Chapter 2.
8.	Choose the type of account you’ll use.
You can do your investing from all sorts of accounts, all with different 
advantages and disadvantages. I cover them a little in this chapter and 
go into more detail in Chapter 3.
9.	Set up an online brokerage account.
At last, the moment you’ve been waiting for: opening an online account. 
After you’ve tackled the preceding steps, you’re ready to get going. This 
important step is covered in Chapter 4.
10.	Understand the different ways to place trades and enter orders.
In Chapter 5, I explain the many different ways to buy and sell stocks, 
each with very different end results. (You also need to understand the 
tax ramifications of selling stocks, which I cover in Chapter 3.)
11.	Boost your knowledge.
After you have the basics down, you’re ready to tackle the later parts of 
the book, where I cover advanced investing topics. This involves pick-
ing an asset allocation (covered in Chapter 9), researching stocks to buy 
and knowing when to sell (covered in Chapter 13), and evaluating more 
exotic investments (the stuff you find in the chapters contained in the 
bonus chapters on the web).

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
Measuring How Much You Can  
Afford to Invest
Online investing can help you accomplish some great things. It can help you 
pay for a child’s college tuition, buy the house you’ve been eyeing, retire, 
or travel to the moon. Okay, maybe not the last one. But you get the idea. 
Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation. And by investing 
online, you can profit even more by reducing the commissions and fees you 
must pay to different advisors and brokers.
One thing online investing cannot do is make something out of nothing. To 
make money investing online, you have to save money first. Don’t get frus-
trated, though, because you don’t need as much to get started as you might 
fear. If you have a job or source of income, building up ample seed money 
isn’t too hard.
The danger of doing nothing
After reading through the 11 steps for get-
ting started, you might be wondering whether 
you’ve taken on more than you bargained for. 
Stick with it. The worst thing you can do now 
is put this book down, tell yourself you’ll worry 
about investing later, and do nothing.
Doing nothing is extremely costly because you 
lose money if you don’t invest. Seriously. Even 
if you stuffed your cash under a mattress and 
didn’t spend a dime, each year that money 
becomes worth, on average, 3 percent less due 
to inflation. Suppose you won $1 million in the 
lottery and stuffed it in a hole in your backyard 
with the plan of taking it out in 30 years to pay 
for your retirement. In 30 years, all 1 million 
greenbacks would still be there, but they’d only 
buy $400,000 worth of goods.
Even if you put your extra cash in a sav-
ings account, you’re not doing much better. 
Because savings accounts usually give you 
access to your money anytime, they pay low 
levels of interest, usually around 1 percent. 
Even high‐yield savings accounts and certifi-
cates of deposit (CDs) typically pay only slightly 
higher interest than the level of inflation or usu-
ally below, meaning that you’re barely keeping 
up if not falling behind. If you want your money 
to grow, you need to move money you don’t 
need for a while out of savings and into invest-
ments. Investments have the potential to gener-
ate much higher returns.
Note: The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 
offers a free calculator that tells you how much 
something you bought in the past would cost 
today (www.minneapolisfed.org). The 
calculator is located on the right side of the 
website (you’ll probably need to scroll down a 
bit to see it).

Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Turning yourself into a big saver
If you want to be an investor, you must find ways to spend less money now 
so that you can save the excess. That means you must retrain yourself from 
being a consumer to being an investor. Many beginning investors have trou-
ble getting past this point because being a consumer is so easy. Consumers 
buy things that they can use and enjoy now, but almost all those objects 
lose value over time. Cars, electronic gadgets, and clothing are all examples 
of things consumers “invest” their money in. You don’t even have to have 
money to spend — plenty of credit card companies will gladly loan it to you. 
Consumers fall into this spending pattern vortex and end up living paycheck 
to paycheck with nothing left to invest.
Investors, on the other hand, find ways to put off current consumption. 
Instead of spending money, they invest it into building businesses or goods 
and services that can earn money, rather than deplete it. The three main 
types of investments are stocks, bonds, and real estate, although I cover 
others in the later chapters.
Here are a few things you can do now to help you change from being a con-
sumer to an investor:
✓
✓Start with what you can manage by putting aside a little each month.
✓
✓Keep increasing what you put aside. If you do it gradually, you won’t 
feel the sting of a suddenly pinched pocket.
✓
✓Hunt for deals and use coupons and discounts. Put aside the saved  
money.
✓
✓Buy only what you need. Don’t be fooled into buying things you don’t 
need because they’re on sale.
Using desktop personal finance software
The word budget is a real turnoff. It conjures up images of sitting at the 
kitchen table with stacks of crumpled‐up receipts, trying to figure out where 
all your money went. As an investor who prefers to do things online, this 
image probably isn’t too appealing.
It’s worth your while to find other ways to see how much money is coming in 
and how much is going out. There are many ways to get help now, including 
personal finance desktop software, apps, and websites.
Traditionally, the best way to track your spending and investments was 
­personal finance software. Even today, in a world of websites and apps for 
smartphones and tablets, personal finance software is one of the most power-
ful tools for investors who want to know where every penny is going.

13

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
There used to be two big names in personal finance software: Microsoft 
Money and Intuit Quicken. Microsoft made a surprise move in 2009 and dis-
continued Money, ceding the entire market to Quicken. You can still down-
load and use Money, as will be described later in this chapter, but it’s no 
longer supported by Microsoft. And Intuit in 2015 announced it was looking 
to sell Quicken to another company.
Still, Quicken remains the top choice for people looking for the most powerful 
software to help them measure how much money they can afford to invest. 
Quicken can help you determine how much money you spend, where it goes, 
and how much excess you accumulate each month that you can channel 
into investing. You can view the results in charts, such as the one shown in 
Figure 1‐1. Quicken can also create a budget for you, essentially at the click 
of a button. The software alerts you if you’re spending more on a certain cat-
egory than you budgeted for. The biggest gripe against the software is that 
you have to get your transactions into it first. You can type them in by hand, 
which is kind of a hassle, or you can download them from your credit card 
company, bank, or brokerage. Quicken also costs you $60 for the Deluxe edi-
tion. Intuit will refund your money if you don’t like the software after using it 
for less than 60 days, though. It’s also important to note that Quicken’s online 
features, including stock‐quote downloads, stop working unless you upgrade 
to the latest version every three years.
Quicken does more than help you set and stick to a budget. It helps you with 
more advanced topics, such as managing your portfolio and taxes — stuff 
I cover later in this book.
Scouring the web for savings help
Even fastidious savers have unavoidable basic 
expenses. Investors, though, find ways to be 
smart about even these routine costs. These 
sites can help you boost your savings:
✓
✓Feed The Pig (www.feedthepig.org) 
urges you to stop wasting money and offers 
tips to help you get out of debt by cutting 
excess spending. The site can calculate 
how to get out of debt and even how much 
you can save by packing a lunch instead of 
buying one.
✓
✓Get Rich Slowly (www.getrichslowly.
org) provides tips, calculators, and online 
tools to help you save more so that you can 
invest more. The site’s front page has daily 
entries of note to savers and investors. The 
site is a blog, or “web log,” which features 
posts offering suggestions on how to better 
manage your money.
✓
✓The Consumerist (www.consumerist.
com) offers tips to educate consumers. It 
explains how to play hardball with service 
providers, like cellphone companies, that 
sock you with monthly fees. This site is also 
a blog, providing a daily stream of posts 
with tips and suggestions for consumers.

14
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Quicken might be the big kid on the block, but it isn’t completely alone. 
Be sure to check out these other options (some of which are free!):
✓
✓Microsoft Money Plus Sunset (http://support.microsoft.com/
kb/2118008) is a free version of the software that was once a venerable 
competitor to Quicken. You can download the software completely free 
by following the directions on the website that comes up if you follow 
the link. The free software comes with all the powerful tools Money was 
known for, such as a portfolio tracker and budgeting tool. But as you 
probably suspected, because the software is free, there’s a hitch. Since 
the software isn’t supported anymore, it doesn’t include any online 
features. That means you can’t download transactions from your bank 
or brokerage accounts, nor can you download stock quotes. All these 
pieces of data must be entered manually.
✓
✓Moneydance (www.moneydance.com) comes in versions for Windows, 
Macintosh, and Linux. If you’re already using Money or Quicken, no 
worries — Moneydance can translate your files. It’s comparably priced 
at $50 and offers a trial that lets you use the software until you hit 100 
transactions.
✓
✓Money Manager Ex (www.codelathe.com/mmex) tries to make the 
power of software like Money and Quicken free. It’s open‐source personal 
finance software, programmed by hobbyists and offered to the public as 
Figure 1-1:  
Intuit’s 
Quicken

to slice and 
dice your 
budget and

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
a service. If you like it, you can donate to the programmers who have cre-
ated it. Money Manager Ex is also available for Android smartphones — 
showing how the line between personal finance software and personal 
finance mobile apps is blurring.
✓
✓GnuCash (www.gnucash.org) has one big thing going for it: It’s free. 
The software is updated and maintained by a host of freelance program-
mers, much like Money Manager Ex. Be warned, though, that GnuCash 
lacks the polish of some of the other personal finance software and is 
harder to navigate. Some versions of the software are considered “unsta-
ble” even by the programmers who coded them — at least until all the 
bugs are fixed.
✓
✓Buddi (http://buddi.digitalcave.ca/index.jsp) is another free 
option. But unlike the other personal finance software, Buddi is designed 
to track budgets and spending, not investment portfolios.
Some investors prefer creating a spreadsheet to track all their finances. 
Microsoft provides several helpful budgeting spreadsheets, which you can 
find by entering the word budget in the search field of the Microsoft Office 
Templates home page (http://office.microsoft.com/en‐us/ 
templates/default.aspx).
Perusing personal finance websites
Before you can put personal finance software to work, you often need to 
download and install it on your computer. You then need to spend some 
time figuring out how to actually use it. If that’s exactly the kind of thing 
that scared you away from making a budget in the first place, you might 
want to consider personal finance websites. Personal finance websites’ main 
benefits include the fact that they let you see your information from any PC 
connected to the Internet, and you generally don’t have to install software 
to make them work. Most of these personal finance websites have created 
mobile app versions, too, which will be discussed in the following section. 
But first, here are a few personal finance websites to check out:
✓
✓Mint.com (www.mint.com) built a loyal following with its simplicity. 
Mint was so successful, in fact, that Intuit bought the company in 2009, 
shut down its own Quicken Online site, and turned Mint into its online 
personal finance site. Mint pulls in all your bank and brokerage accounts 
and imports all your financial information. For users just looking to get 
up and running fast, Mint is tough to beat. It’s also free. Mint, however, 
lacks many of the powerful investment tracking features in Quicken, 
including the capability to precisely track how much you paid for cer-
tain investments — your cost basis — which is very important, as you 
discover later. And you’ll need to be comfortable handing over all your 
account numbers and passwords to a third party. There is also a version 
of Mint for mobile devices, which is worth paying attention to.

16
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
✓
✓Mvelopes for the Web (www.mvelopes.com) can be your spending 
cop that tells you you’re spending too much. Mvelopes is a web‐based 
spending tracker that tries to be the digital version of envelope‐based 
budgeting. Rather than stuffing cash in envelopes set aside for certain 
expenses, Mvelopes lets you decide before you get a paycheck how 
much you’re willing to spend in certain categories (such as dining out) 
and plan your spending for the month. As the month progresses, you 
download all your spending from banks and credit card companies and 
subtract each transaction from the envelopes you set aside. That way, 
if you’re spending too much on restaurants, for instance, you know to 
cut back or to skimp in other areas. It’s free to sign up for the basic ser-
vice, which limits you a bit. The free version will only track four banking 
accounts and only allow you to track 25 spending categories, or “enve-
lopes.” The Premier version allows you to track an unlimited number 
of accounts and envelopes. The Premier version is not a cheap tool, 
though, and will set you back $95 a year.
✓
✓MoneyStrands (www.moneystrands.com) tries to make saving your 
money hip, if that’s possible. The site is full of colorful diagrams, making 
it appear fun to use, which might make it seem less intimidating to some 
people. The site not only helps you track how you’re doing financially, 
but also compares you with others and provides savings tips.
✓
✓Personal Capital (www.personalcapital.com) was built by some 
former employees of Intuit. The site is best known for its powerful 
investment portfolio tools, which I discuss further in Chapter 8. But 
Personal Capital also allows consumers to download their banking trans-
actions and spot trends in their spending. Personal Capital provides 
what it calls a dashboard, which shows you where all your money is 
coming from and going to. There’s also a cash manager to help you keep 
a handle on your expenses.
Putting all your financial data online is simple and convenient, but it can 
be a bad idea for many investors. First, there are the security concerns 
with entrusting all your financial data to strangers over the Internet. Just 
ask anyone who signed up to use the adultery website — I know you would 
never do something like that — after the site was compromised in 2015 
and users’ personal information was stolen. But beyond that, if a website 
calls it quits one day, you might lose access to the historical financial and 
­investing records you kept on the site. Wesabe had been a leading online 
financial tracking site until it pulled the plug in July 2010. Cake Financial is 
another case in point. The investment tracking site was bought by E*TRADE 
in January 2010 and, without warning, shut down — leaving investors with-
out access to their financial information. Geezeo had been a leading online 
financial tracker website until in 2010 the company shut down its public 
website and moved to sell its products to banks instead. These examples are 
a big reason why personal financial software, like Quicken, may be preferable 
because your data is stored on your computer’s hard drive, where you can

always access it (unless it fatally crashes, and you failed to maintain a cur-
rent backup copy, of course).
If you’re not ready to trust your financial data to a website, you can still ben-
efit from the wisdom of the web. Personal finance information sites don’t track 
your transactions, but they’re still able to give you the big picture. The fol-
lowing sites are worth checking out:
✓
✓The Financial Planning Association’s Life Goals (www.fpanet.
org/LifeGoals) lets you click on financial goals, like “Saving for 
Retirement,” and get advice.
✓
✓SmartAboutMoney.org (www.smartaboutmoney.org) provides vari-
ous tips on how to save more and boost your financial strength.
✓
✓The Financial Literacy and Education Commission (www.mymoney.
gov) is a government‐run site that steps you through everything from 
saving more to avoiding frauds. It’s also a good directory of useful infor-
mation that’s available from other government agencies.
Capitalizing from personal finance apps
The rise of smartphones and tablets has given investors a whole new way to 
track their money. There’s a large and growing group of investors who see 
desktop personal finance software as being too powerful or complicated for 
them. Meanwhile, the poor performance of many websites on smartphone 
web browsers has led many investors to get into the habit of downloading 
personal finance apps to their devices to help them manage their lives. Most 
of the key players in personal finance apps are also leaders with personal 
finance websites. But because mobile apps are so important, they now 
deserve special treatment, with the key rivals being
✓
✓Mint.com (www.mint.com): Given the popularity of Mint online, it’s only 
natural it’s a leader in the app world, too. Mint makes sense for many 
consumers because it’s familiar; backed by a large company with the 
resources to update it; and available on many mobile devices including 
those running Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating system. Users 
of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system for computers, tablets, and 
smartphones can access their Mint information by using a browser. The 
app does everything you’d expect, such as downloading balances. It also 
works nicely with the web — allowing you to safeguard your data if you 
lose a mobile device.
✓
✓Mvelopes app (www.mvelopes.com) is the answer for you if you’re a 
fan of its envelope‐based budgeting system. It also captures receipt data 
so you can see if that pair of jeans you’re just about to buy will blow 
your budget. The app is available for Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.

✓
✓MoneyPoint (www.microsoft.com/en‐US/store/apps/MoneyPoint/ 
9WZDNCRFJCCD) is an innovative take on mobile apps that attempts 
to blend the power of Quicken with the convenience of an app. Unlike 
Mint and other apps that rely on your entering banking information and 
downloading the data, MoneyPoint allows you to enter the data yourself, 
and your data is saved on your computer. It’s available on any devices 
running Windows 10.
✓
✓Personal Capital (www.personalcapital.com) brings its personal‐
finance chops to the mobile app game. The app gives investors high‐
level and convenient access to their accounts, as well as the ability to 
track spending and monitor investments. Available for iOS and Android.
Saving with web‐based savings calculators
If personal finance software or sites seem too much like a chore or too Big 
Brotherish, you might consider these free web‐based tools that measure how 
much you could save, in theory, based on a few parameters that you enter:
✓
✓MSN Money’s Savings Calculator (www.msn.com/en‐us/money/
tools/savingscalculator) allows you to enter six assumptions to 
find out how much you’d have to save to meet a specific goal. You enter 
your initial deposit, annual savings amount, increase in contributions, 
number of years to save, what return you expect to get on your savings, 
and your tax bracket. The calculator does the rest of the work.
✓
✓Bankrate.com’s Savings Calculator (www.bankrate.com/calculators/ 
savings/saving‐goals‐calculator.aspx) asks you what you’re 
saving for, be it college or buying a car. It then breaks down your finan-
cial objective and tells you how much you need to save to meet said 
objective.
✓
✓Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA’s) Savings Calculator 
(http://apps.finra.org/Calcs/1/Savings) lets you enter differ-
ent combinations of variables, such as how much you’ve saved already 
and how much additional money you intend to save. It then gives you a 
realistic estimate of how much you can expect to save.
Relying on the residual method
Are you the kind of person who has no idea how much money you have until 
you take out a wad of twenties from the ATM and check the balance on the 
receipt? If so, you’re probably not the budgeting type, and the preceding 
options are too strict. For you, the best option might be to open a savings 
account with your bank or open a high‐yield savings account and transfer


 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
in money you know you won’t need. Watch the savings account over the 
months and find out how much it grows. That can give you a good idea of 
how much you could save without even feeling it. You can find out where 
you can get a high rate of interest on your savings from Bankrate.com (www.
bankrate.com/funnel/savings). The site lists rates on money market 
accounts (MMAs) based on how much money you’ve saved.
Using web‐based goal‐savings calculators
All the preceding methods help you determine how much you can save. But 
the following sites help you determine how much you should save to reach 
specific goals:
✓
✓Vanguard’s retirement calculator (https://personal.vanguard.
com/us/insights/retirement/saving/set‐retirement‐goals) 
helps you figure out how much you should save by measuring how 
much you will need. The site prompts you to enter how much you make 
and how long you have until retirement to help you figure out how much 
you need to save. Vanguard offers similar tools to help you decide how 
much you need to save for other goals, such as paying for a child’s col-
lege tuition.
✓
✓T. Rowe Price’s Retirement Income Calculator (www3.troweprice.
com/ric/ric/public/ric.do) uses advanced computerized model-
ing to show you how much you need to save no matter what the stock 
market does. It runs your variables through a “Monte Carlo simulation,” 
which simulates what happens to your savings no matter what and gives 
you the odds that you’ll have enough money.
✓
✓Nationwide’s On Your Side Interactive Retirement Planner (https://
isc.nwservicecenter.com/iApp/isc/rpt/launchRetirement 
Tool.action) asks you some questions and then rates your ability to 
retire when and how you plan to. It also suggests tips on improving your 
odds of saving as much as you hope.
✓
✓ESPlanner (https://basic.esplanner.com) helps you make many 
of the estimates you need to forecast your retirement needs in the 
future. Developed in part by Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of econom-
ics at Boston University, ESPlanner steps you through what your actual 
spending might look like when you’re retired and uses that information 
to help you set savings goals.
✓
✓Index Funds Advisors Retirement Analyzer (www.ifa.com/montecarlo/ 
home) uses a sophisticated analysis to give you a range of possible out-
comes in your retirement savings. Most retirement analyzers require 
you to make guesses at things such as the return you might get. The IFA 
Retirement Analyzer uses history to give you a good idea of what your 
best‐case and worst‐case scenarios might be.

Deciding How You Plan to Save
After you’ve determined how much you need to save and how much you 
can save, you need to put your plan into action. The way you do this really 
depends on how good you are at handling your money and saving. The differ-
ent methods are as follows:
✓
✓Automatic withdrawals: Ever hear the cliché “pay yourself first”? It’s 
a trite saying that actually makes sense. The idea is that before you go 
shopping for that big‐screen TV or start feeling rich after payday, you 
should set money aside for savings. Some people have the discipline to 
do this themselves, but many do not. For the latter group of people, the 
best option is to set up automatic withdrawals, which is a way of giving a 
brokerage firm or bank permission to automatically extract money once 
a month. When the money is out of your hands, you won’t be tempted 
to spend it.
✓
✓Retirement plans: If your goal is investing for retirement, you want to 
find out what retirement savings plans are available to you. If you’re an 
employee, you might have access to a 401(k) plan. And if you’re self‐
employed, you might consider various individual retirement accounts 
(also known as IRAs). When you’re starting to invest, taking advantage 
of available retirement plans is usually your best bet. I cover this in 
more detail in Chapter 3.
✓
✓On your own: If you have money left over after paying all your bills, 
don’t let it sit in a savings account. Leaving cash in a low‐interest‐bearing 
account is like giving a bank a cheap loan. Put your money to work for 
you. Brokers make it easy for you to get money to them via electronic 
transfers.
Being prepared for emergencies
When creating your budget and moving money 
from savings to an investment account, be sure 
to keep an emergency fund on hand. This is 
money that’s readily available in case of a per-
sonal financial crunch, stored in an account you 
can access immediately, such as a bank sav-
ings account. A decent guideline is to always 
have enough cash handy for at least six months 
of living expenses. Add up how much you spend 
each month on necessities, such as housing 
(rent or mortgage and property taxes), food, 
utilities, insurance (home, car, and health), and 
transportation. Multiply by six to get a general 
idea of how much you should have for emer-
gencies. During the 2008 financial crisis, some 
experts increased their recommendation for an 
emergency fund to 9 to 12 months of cash on 
hand. That’s not a bad idea even now that the 
crisis has subsided.

Want to Be a Successful Investor? 
Start Now!
The greatest force all investors have is time. Don’t waste it. The sooner you 
start to save and invest, the more likely you will be successful. To explain, 
take the example of five people, each of whom wants to have $1 million in the 
bank by the time he or she retires at age 65. The first investor starts when 
she is 20, followed by a 30‐year‐old, 40‐year‐old, 50‐year‐old, and 60‐year‐old. 
Assuming that each investor starts with nothing and averages 10 percent 
returns each year (more on this later), Table 1‐1 describes how much each 
must save per month to reach his or her goals.
See, youth has its advantages. A 20‐year‐old who saves less than $100 a month 
will end up with the same amount of money as a 60‐year‐old who squirrels 
away $12,914 a month or $154,968 a year! That’s largely due to the fact that 
money that’s invested early has more time to brew. And over time, the money 
snowballs and compounds, which is a concept I cover later in this chapter.
Learning the Lingo
Just about any profession, hobby, or pursuit has its own lingo. Car fanatics, 
chess players, and computer hobbyists have terms of art that they seem 
to learn through osmosis. Online investing is no different. Many terms, like 
stocks and bonds, you might have heard but not completely understood. 
As you read through this book and browse the websites I mention, you’ll 
probably periodically stumble on unfamiliar words.
Don’t expect a standard dictionary to help much. Investing terms can be so 
specialized and precise that your dusty ol’ Webster’s dictionary might not

be a big help. Fortunately, a number of excellent online investing glossaries 
explain in detail what investing terms mean. Here are few for you to check out:
✓
✓Investopedia (www.investopedia.com) has one of the most compre-
hensive databases of investing terms, with more than 5,000 entries. The 
site not only covers the basics, but also explains advanced terms in 
great detail. It’s also fully searchable so that you don’t waste time getting 
the answer.
✓
✓Yahoo! Financial Glossary (http://biz.yahoo.com/glossary/) is 
all about quick answers. The database, written by Campbell Harvey, a 
professor of finance at Duke University, explains most basic investment 
terms in one or two sentences.
✓
✓InvestorWords (www.investorwords.com) has a fully searchable data-
base of investment terms, but it also makes the dictionary a bit more 
interesting with unique features like a “term of the day” and a summary 
of terms that have recently rewritten definitions.

✓Investor Glossary (www.investorglossary.com) covers all the 
basics and also attempts to describe some slang terms in the industry, 
such as an investing philosophy known as the Dogs of the Dow.
Setting Your Expectations
Have you ever talked to a professional investor or financial advisor? One of 
the first things you’ll hear is how much experience he or she has. I can’t tell 
you how many times I’ve been told, “I’ve been on Wall Street for 30 years. I’ve 
seen it all.”
Some of that is certainly old‐fashioned bragging. But these claims are common 
because in investing, experience does count. It’s easy to say you could endure 
a bear market until you’re watching white‐knuckled and sweating bullets as 
your nest egg shrivels from $100,000 to $80,000 or $50,000. Experience brings 
perspective, which is very important.
But if you’re new to investing, don’t despair. Online tools can help you acquire 
the brain of a grizzled Wall Street sage. And don’t forget that I’m here to set 
you straight as well. In fact, I’m set to start talking about how much you can 
expect to make from investing. And you’ll be hearing a great deal about a 
little something called the rate of return.
Keeping up with the rate of return
Don’t let the term rate of return scare you. It’s the most basic concept 
in investing, and you can master it. Just remember that it’s the amount, 

23

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
­measured as a percent, that your investment increases in value in a certain 
period of time. If you have a savings account, you understand the concept 
already. If you put $100 in a bank account paying 4.5 percent interest, you 
know that by the end of the year, you will have received $4.50 in interest. 
You earned a 4.5 percent annual rate of return. Rates of return are useful in 
investing because they work as a report card to tell investors how well an 
investment is doing, no matter how much money is invested.
You can calculate rates of return yourself with the following:
✓
✓A formula: Subtract an asset’s previous value from its current value, 
divide the difference by the asset’s previous value, and multiply by 100. 
If a stock rises from $15 to $32 a share, you would calculate the rate of 
return by first subtracting 15 from 32 to get 17. Next, divide 17 by 15 and 
multiply by 100. The rate of return is 113.3 percent.
✓
✓Financial calculators: You can use the Hewlett‐Packard 12c that financial 
types always carry. If you have this calculator, you can find out how to 
crunch a rate of return with an easy‐to‐follow tutorial located at http://
h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/HP12Cpercents.pdf. 
(Look for Example 5.)
✓
✓Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software: This software, which is avail-
able on most computers, calculates rates of return fairly easily. You 
can download templates from within the software. When creating a 
new spreadsheet, you can search for templates that set everything up. 
Search for the “Portfolio analysis” template in the “Search for online 
templates” option after you click File and then New.
✓
✓Financial websites: Many handy sites can calculate rates of return for 
you, including www.moneychimp.com/calculator/discount_rate_ 
calculator.htm.
When you calculate the rate of return for a portfolio you’ve added money to 
or taken money from, you must take an extra step. I explain how to do that in 
Chapter 8.
The power of compounding
Famous physicist Albert Einstein once called compounding the most powerful 
force in the universe. Compounding is when money you invest earns a return 
and then that return also earns a return. (Dizzy yet?) When you leave money 
invested for a long time, the power of compounding kicks in.
Imagine that you’ve deposited $100 in an account that pays 4.5 percent in 
interest a year. In the first year, you’d earn $4.50 in interest, which brings 
your balance to $104.50. But in the second year, you’d earn interest of $4.70.  

24
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Why? Because you’ve also earned 4.5 percent on the $4.50 in interest you  
earned. The longer you’re invested, the more time your money has 
to compound.
You can enter your own information and see how powerful a force compound-
ing is at this site: www.dinkytown.net/java/CompoundSavings.html.
Compounding works on your side to fight against inflation. Calculator Pro has 
a web‐based calculator (www.calculatorpro.com/calculator/real‐
rate‐of‐return‐calculator) that tells you whether your rate of return 
is keeping you ahead of inflation. The calculator also tells you what your 
“real” rate of return is — in other words, how much of your return isn’t being 
eaten away by inflation.
Determining How Much You Can Expect 
to Profit
Why bother investing online? To make money, of course. But how much do you 
want to make? Understanding what you can expect to earn is where you need 
to start. Whenever you hear about an investment and what kinds of returns it 
promises, you should be able to mentally compare it with the kinds of returns 
you can expect from stocks, bonds, and other investments. That way, you 
know whether the returns you’re being promised are too good to be true.
How do you do this? By relying on the hard work of academics who have 
done some heavy lifting. Academics and market research firms have ranked 
investments by how well they’ve done over the years. And I’m not just talking 
a few years, but for decades — in many cases, going back to the 1920s and 
earlier. The amount of work that’s gone into measuring historical rates of 
returns is staggering, but if you’re using online resources, you’re just a click 
away from finding out how most types of assets have done.
What you expect to earn is a number that can affect most of your invest-
ment decisions, usually rather dramatically. The following table is a revised 
version of Table 1‐1 — the one that showed how five different people could 
expect to save $1 million. Table 1‐2 looks at how much they must save to 
make their goal changes based on how much they think they will earn from 
their investments.
The 20‐year‐old must save nearly $500 a month extra if she thinks she will 
earn only 5 percent a year from her investments instead of 15 percent. But 
even scarier, if she saves $15.28 thinking she’ll earn 15 percent a year, but 
earns only 5 percent, she’ll have just $30,963 instead of the $1 million she was 
counting on.

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
Studying the past
If someone asks you how stocks are doing, he often means how much they 
went up or down that day. Financial TV stations and websites reinforce this 
preoccupation with the here‐and‐now by scrolling second‐by‐second moves 
in stock prices across the bottom of the screen.
But, second‐by‐second moves in stocks don’t really tell you much. If a stock 
goes down a bit and a company didn’t report the news, did anything really 
change during that second? Watching short‐term movements of stock prices 
doesn’t mean much in the overall scheme of things.
To understand how investments behave, it’s more helpful to analyze their 
movements over as many years as you can. That way, recessions are blended 
with boom times to get you to a real, smooth average. Doing this requires 
the painstaking method of processing dozens of annual returns of stocks 
and analyzing the data. Luckily, some academics and industry pioneers have 
done much of the work for you, and you can access their findings if you know 
where to look. And I just happen to know a few places where you can start 
your search:
✓
✓Bogle Financial Market Research (www.vanguard.com/bogle_site/ 
bogle_home.html) is the website maintained by the founder of 
Vanguard, John C. Bogle. Bogle revolutionized the investment indus-
try by creating the world’s largest index mutual fund, the Vanguard 
500, which is designed to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 stock 
market index. Stock market indexes, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 
index and Dow Jones Industrial Average, are benchmarks that let you 
track how the market is doing.
Bogle’s site is invaluable because he explains that the market, on aver-
age, returns about 10 percent a year. That benchmark will be very 
important later as you evaluate different stocks. Indexes are covered in 
more detail in Chapter 8.

annual returns so that you can get a general feel for how markets behave over 
time. The idea here is for you to gain perspective, not cram for an econ Ph.D.
What the past tells you about the future
Exhaustive studies of markets have shown that stocks, in general, return 
about 10 percent a year. Through the years, 10 percent returns have been the 
benchmark for long‐term performance, making them a good measuring stick 
for you and something to help you keep your bearings. But long‐term stud-
ies of securities also show that, to get higher returns, you usually must also 
accept more risk. Table 1‐3 shows how investors must often accept more risk 
to get a higher return.

28
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that investing in stocks guarantees you 
a 10 percent return every year, like a savings account. That’s not the case. 
Stocks are risky and tend to move in erratic patterns, and they test your 
confidence with sudden drops. In fact, each year stocks typically posted a 
total return, including dividends, somewhere between a loss of 10 percent 
and a gain of 28.7 percent, according to the folks at the Index Funds Advisors 
website (www.ifa.com). And get this: Since 1926, the Standard & Poor’s 500 
index has gained between 10.0 percent and 10.9 percent only four times and 
returned 10 percent only once, in 1966. The market’s brutal decline in 2008, 
which chewed up a third of stocks’ value, is a good reminder of how violent 
stocks can be in the short term. Don’t let short‐term swings in stocks derail 
your long‐term plan, but do be aware ahead of time of the fact that markets 
move in violent ways. That way you won’t be tempted to do something that 
you’ll regret later. Volatility is the price you must pay to get returns.
Table 1‐4 shows you just how crazy the market’s movements can be in the 
short term, using the history of the popular Standard & Poor’s 500 index

Gut‐Check Time: How Much  
Risk Can You Take?
It’s time to get a grip — a grip on how much you can invest, that is. Most 
beginning investors are so interested in finding stocks that make them 
rich overnight that they lose sight of risk. But academic studies show that 
risk and return go hand in hand. That’s why you need to know how much 
risk you can stomach before you start looking for investments and buying 
them online.
Several excellent online tools can help you get a handle on how much of a 
financial thrill seeker you are. Most are structured like interviews that ask 
you a number of questions and help you decide what kind of investor you 
are. These are kind of like personality tests for your investment taste. I cover 
several of these in more detail in Chapter 9, where I discuss how to create an 
investing road map, called an asset allocation. For now, these questionnaires 
are worthwhile to take right away so that you can understand what kind of 
investor you are:
✓
✓Vanguard’s Investor Questionnaire (https://personal.vanguard.
com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) asks you ten salient questions to 
determine how much of a risk taker you are with your money. It deter-
mines what your ideal asset allocation is. Take note of the breakdown. 
The closer to 100 percent that Vanguard recommends you put in stocks, 
the more risk‐tolerant you are, and the closer to 100 percent in bonds, the 
less risk‐tolerant you are.
Why knowing the past is valuable
By studying how investments have done in the 
past, you get an idea, on average, of what to 
expect for the future. This gives you perspec-
tive that lets you not only decide whether an 
investment is worthwhile, but also gives you a 
“BS” meter. If you get a flyer in the mail talking 
up a “promising new company” that’s expected 
to generate 10 percent returns, walk away. Why 
would you take a chance on a shaky company if 
you can expect the same return by investing in 
a lower‐risk, diversified index fund? Similarly, a 
return that’s much higher than 10 percent must 
be much riskier, no matter what the flyer says. 
Also, investments that claim they return 10 per-
cent a year, guaranteed, are also suspicious 
because you should expect some major ups 
and downs to get that double‐digit return.

✓
✓Index Funds Advisors Risk Capacity Survey (www.ifa.com/
SurveyNET/index.aspx) offers a quick risk survey that can tell you 
what kind of investor you are after answering just five questions. You 
can also find a complete risk capacity survey that hits you with a few 
dozen questions. Whichever you choose, the survey can characterize 
what kind of investor you are and even display a painting that portrays 
your risk tolerance.
✓
✓Charles Schwab Investor Profile Questionnaire (www.schwab.com/
public/file/P‐778947/InvestorProfileQuestionnaire.pdf) 
gets you to think about the factors that greatly determine how you 
should be investing, such as your investment time horizon and tolerance 
for risk. The Schwab questionnaire can be printed so you don’t have to 
be in front of a computer to take it. At the bottom of the questionnaire is 
a chart that helps you see how aggressive or conservative you should be 
with your portfolio.
Passive or Active? Deciding What 
Kind of Investor You Plan to Be
Investing might not seem controversial, but it shouldn’t surprise you that 
anytime you’re talking about money, people have some strong opinions about 
the right way to do things. The first way investors categorize themselves is by 
whether they are passive or active. Because these two approaches are so dif-
ferent, the following sections help you think about what they are and which 
camp you see yourself in. Where you stand not only affects which broker is 
best for you, as discussed in Chapter 4, but also affects which chapters in this 
book appeal to you most.
How to know if you’re a passive investor
Passive investors don’t try to beat the stock market. They merely try to keep 
up with it by owning all the stocks in an index. An index is a basket of stocks 
that mirrors the market. Passive investors are happy matching the market’s 
performance, knowing that they can boost their real returns with a few tech-
niques I discuss in Chapter 9.
You know you’re a passive investor if you like the following ideas:
✓
✓Not picking individual stocks: These investors buy large baskets of 
stocks that mirror the performance of popular stock indexes like the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Standard & Poor’s 500 index so 
that they don’t worry about whether a small upstart company they 

31

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
invested in will release its new product on time and whether it will be 
well received.
✓
✓Owning mutual and exchange‐traded funds: Because passive inves-
tors aren’t looking for the next Microsoft, Google, or Apple, they buy 
mutual and exchange‐traded funds that buy hundreds of stocks. (I cover 
mutual and exchange‐traded funds in more detail in Chapters 10 and 11, 
respectively.)
✓
✓Reducing taxes: Passive investors tend to buy investments and forget 
about them until many years later when they need the money. This can 
be lucrative because by holding onto diversified investments for a long 
time and not selling them, passive investors can postpone when they 
have to pay capital gains taxes. (I cover capital gains taxes in more detail 
in Chapter 3.)
✓
✓Not stressing about stocks’ daily, monthly, or even annual movements: 
Passive investors tend to buy index or mutual funds and forget about 
them. They don’t need to sit in front of financial TV shows, surf count-
less financial websites, read magazines, or worry about where stocks are 
moving. They’re invested for the long term, and everything else is just 
noise to them.
Sites for passive investors to start with
One of the toughest things about being a passive investor is sitting still 
during a bull market when everyone else seems to be making more than you. 
Yes, you might be able to turn off the TV, but inevitably you’ll bump into 
someone who brags about his or her giant gains and laughs at you for being 
satisfied with 10 percent market returns.
When that happens, it’s even more important to stick with your philosophy. 
Following the crowd at this moment undermines the value of your strategy. 
That’s why even passive investors are well served going to websites where 
other passive investors congregate:
✓
✓Bogleheads (www.bogleheads.org) is an electronic water cooler for 
fans of Vanguard index funds and passive investors to meet, encourage, 
and advise each other. They call themselves Bogleheads in honor of the 
founder of Vanguard, John Bogle.
✓
✓The Arithmetic of Active Management (www.stanford.
edu/~wfsharpe/art/active/active.htm) is a reprint of an article 
by an early proponent of passive investing, William Sharpe, who explains 
why active investing can never win.
✓
✓Vanguard’s website (www.vanguard.com) contains many helpful sto-
ries about the power of index investing and offers them for free, even if 
you don’t have an account.

How to know whether you’re  
an active investor
Active investors almost feel sorry for passive investors. Why would anyone 
be satisfied just matching the stock market and not even try to do better? 
Active investors feel that if you’re smart enough and willing to spend time 
doing homework, you can exceed 10 percent annual returns. Active investors 
also find investing to be thrilling, almost like a hobby. Some active inves-
tors try to find undervalued stocks and hold them until they’re discovered 
by other investors. Another class of active investors are short‐term traders, 
who bounce in and out of stocks trying to get quick gains.
You’re an active investor if you . . .
✓
✓Think long‐term averages of stocks are meaningless: Active investors 
believe they can spot winning companies that no one knows about yet, 
buy their shares at just the right time, and sell them for a profit.
✓
✓Are willing to spend large amounts of time searching for stocks: 
These are the investors who sit in front of financial TV shows, analyze 
stocks that look undervalued, and do all sorts of prospecting trying to 
find gems.
✓
✓Believe they can hire mutual fund managers who can beat the market: 
Some active investors think that certain talented mutual fund managers 
are out there and that if they just give their money to those managers, 
they’ll win.
✓
✓Suspect certain types of stocks aren’t priced correctly and that 
many investors make bad decisions: Active investors believe they can 
outsmart the masses and routinely capitalize on the mistakes of the 
great unwashed.
✓
✓Understand the risks: Most active traders underperform index funds, 
some without even realizing it. Before deciding to be an active trader, 
be sure to test out your skills with online simulations, as I describe in 
Chapter 2, or make sure that you’re measuring your performance cor-
rectly, as I describe in Chapter 8. If you’re losing money picking stocks, 
stop doing it. Be sure to know how dangerous online investing can be 
when trying to be an active investor by reading a warning from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission here: http://sec.gov/ 
investor/pubs/onlinetips.htm.
Many investors try, but very few are able to consistently beat the market. 
Consider Bill Miller, portfolio manager for the Legg Mason Capital Management 
Value Trust mutual fund. Miller had beaten the market for 15 years and turned 
into a poster child for active investors and proof that beating the market was 
possible if you were smart enough. But even Miller’s streak came to an end in 

33

 Chapter 1: Getting Yourself Ready for Online Investing
2006. That’s when his Legg Mason Value Trust fund didn’t just trail the market, 
it lagged by a mile, returning just 5.9 percent while the market gained 15.8 
percent. The fund lagged the market by 12.2 percent in 2007 and again in 2008 
by 18.1 percent. While the fund beat the market in 2009, active investors had 
already lost their hero and even now, more than a decade later, there’s yet to 
be a mutual fund with an equivalent record. There will certainly be another 
hot manager to take Miller’s place, though.
Sites for the active investor to start with
Ever hear of someone trying to learn a foreign language by moving to the 
country and picking it up through “immersion”? The idea is that by just being 
around the language, and through the necessity of buying food or finding the 
restroom, the person eventually gets proficient.
If you’re interested in active investing, you can do the same thing by hitting 
websites that are common hangouts for active investors. By lurking on these 
sites, you can pick up how these types of investors find stocks that interest 
them and trade on them. These sites can show you the great pains active 
investors go through in their attempt to beat the market. A few to start look-
ing at include the following:
✓
✓TheStreet.com (www.thestreet.com) collects trading ideas and 
tips from writers mainly looking for quick‐moving stocks and other 
investments.
✓
✓TradingMarkets (www.tradingmarkets.com) explores the details of 
complicated trading philosophies. The site highlights stocks that have 
moved up or down by a large amount, which is usually something that 
catches the attention of traders.
✓
✓Seeking Alpha (http://seekingalpha.com) provides news and com-
mentary designed for investors of all skill levels who are trying to beat 
the market.

ou live in a do‐it‐yourself world. You’re expected to fill your own gas 
tank at the service station, refill your own soda at the fast‐food restau-
rant, and book your own airline tickets. It’s the same story with investing. If 
you want to reach your financial goals and retire comfortably, it’s up to you 
to make it happen. The age of employers looking after their workers’ futures 
with pensions is vanishing and being replaced with do‐it‐yourself retirement 
plans like 401(k)s.
If you ask for help, you’re almost always pointed to the Internet and told to 
look it up or do your own research. That sounds reasonable, except that 
the Internet is a massive collection of web pages, and you can find dozens if 
not hundreds of sources for investing advice, much of which is conflicting 
or, worse, wrong. No wonder many investors throw their hands up in utter 
frustration.
That’s where this chapter comes in. In Chapter 1, I fill you in on what it takes 
to prepare yourself to be an online investor. Here in Chapter 2, it’s time to 
prepare your computer, smartphone, or tablet for online investing and make 
it a tool that quickly provides you with the answers you need. This chapter 
helps you tweak your device until it’s like your personal investing worksta-
tion. It’ll feel as comfortable to you as an old leather chair. And by using 
mostly free online resources, you’ll save yourself some money in the process.

36
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
I escort you through the morass of financial websites and apps and show you 
which ones you need to know. You find out what types of investing informa-
tion are available online and how to access what you need from your com-
puter or other device. You also find out how to use online simulation sites 
that let you take a dry run investing with fake money to make sure that you 
know what you’re doing before using real money.
Turning Your Device into a  
Trading Station
When you think of a stock trading floor, you probably picture a room full of 
traders wearing brightly colored jackets, throwing papers around, and yell-
ing out market orders. Some of that drama still exists on the New York Stock 
Exchange floor and in the Chicago futures markets, but it’s largely a throw-
back from the old days.
Today, trading floors I’ve walked through look more like insurance offices. 
They have rows of desks with computers not unlike the one that’s prob-
ably sitting on your desk. Professional traders do have an advantage: Many 
have high‐end trading systems and software that cost thousands of dollars a 
month. That might be beyond your price range, but you might be amazed at 
how much market information you can get, for free or for little money, if you 
know where to go.
Mobile devices have become go‐to devices for checking mail — and yes — 
playing Angry Birds. There’s no question when you’re looking for a quick 
check on your portfolio or to see how stocks are doing, your smartphone is 
your trusty mobile companion. Because of the increased popularity of mobile 
devices, they are included in this section. But the emphasis, still, is on good 
ol’ fashioned computers. Why? Online brokers tell me that about 85 percent 
of trading still happens on PCs. The bigger screen, dedicated keyboard, and 
better tools still make the PC the tool of choice when it comes to investing.
Using favorites to put data  
at your fingertips
The easiest way to turn your computer into a market‐monitoring station is by 
bookmarking or creating favorites to key sites with data you need. Favorites 
(also sometimes called bookmarks) are links in your Internet browser that let 

37

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
you quickly reach a web page when you need it, without typing a long web-
site address. Most Internet browsers have this capability, and they all work 
slightly differently. But just so you have an idea, if you’re using Microsoft’s 
Edge browser in Windows 10, you can create favorites by doing the following:
1.	Navigate to the website you’re interested in saving.
2.	Click the Favorites icon (the one with the star) in the upper‐right 
corner of the screen. (You can see the star in Figure 2‐1.)
A menu opens.
3.	Give the favorite a name.
Choose a name that will quickly identify the site for you.
4.	In the Create In space, choose the Favorite folder you want to put the 
favorite into.
If you want to put this favorite in a separate folder, you can create a 
folder by clicking the Create New Folder option. If you’re not sure, just 
use the default Favorite folder.
5.	Click the Add button.
If you want to access that address again, click the “Hub” icon (the icon that 
looks like three lines) and scroll down until you see the title of the page 
you’re interested in.

Putting key mobile apps a touch away
Investors are increasingly looking to their smartphones and tablets as a way 
to keep up with the markets, especially when they’re away from the office. 
The computer is still the ideal place to do most of your work — given the 
spacious size of the screen, increased processing power, and greater storage. 
But some investors like the simplicity of the mobile device or use it to keep 
an eye on their money at all times.
All the major mobile platforms (Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android, and Microsoft’s 
Windows 10) provide an app store. That’s where you go to download the 
apps you’ll want to track your money. You probably already know how to do 
this — after all how else can you play Angry Birds — but for more on this, 
consult with iPhone For Dummies (Wiley, 2014), Android Phones For Dummies 
(Wiley, 2014), or Windows 10 For Dummies (Wiley, 2015).
To make it easier to find the apps you’re looking for, consider creating an app 
folder called “Investing” or “Money” and putting all your finance‐related apps 
in there. You’ll save yourself lots of wasted time scrolling through menus. In 
Windows 10 Mobile, do this by pressing down on an app on the Start screen 
and dragging it on top of an icon of a related app. A folder will be created to 
organize them.
Also, some tablets and smartphones allow you to make a button that quickly 
launches a favorite website. In Windows 10 Mobile, for example, launch the 
Edge browser and navigate to a website. Touch the three dots in the lower 
right‐hand corner and choose “Pin to start.” The website now appears as an 
app on the Start page.
Compiling a list of must‐watch sites
So you know how to create favorites and organize your mobile apps. But 
what sites are worth creating as favorites? My suggestion is to take a page 
from the professionals and try to replicate the data they’re most interested 
in. Most professional trading workstations are set up so that they can take on 
five distinct tasks:
✓
✓Tracking the market’s every move
✓
✓Monitoring news that has the potential to affect stock prices
✓
✓Checking in on Wall Street chatter
✓
✓Accessing company financial statements and regulatory filings
✓
✓Executing trades

39

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
The world between PCs and mobile devices is blurring every day. Microsoft’s 
Surface Pro is basically a tablet that’s also a computer. And Windows 10 is 
designed to give you the power of a desktop computer but with the ease and 
apps that smartphone users have gotten used to. Apple has followed with 
the iPad Pro — which still runs a smartphone operating system — but touts 
a larger screen and keyboard. Expect the distinction between computer and 
mobile devices to dissolve over time.
Tracking the Market’s Every Move
You’re probably hoping to study the market and find ways to score big and 
fast. Hey, everyone wants to get rich quick. Just remember that making 
money by darting in and out of stocks is extremely tough to do, and most 
investors, online or not, will be better off forming a long‐term investment 
strategy and sticking with it. The difference between long‐term investing (the 
in‐it‐for‐the‐long‐haul approach, called passive investing) and short‐term trad-
ing (the darting‐in‐and‐out way of doing things, called active investing) is dis-
cussed in Chapter 1, where I also give you the tools necessary for figuring out 
how to decide which approach is best for you.
No matter what kind of investor you plan to be, watching real‐time stock 
movements is fascinating. Watching rapid price moves with stock prices 
dancing around and flashing on the computer screen is a guilty pleasure and 
a source of entertainment for some investors.
You can find a great deal of overlap among online investing resources. Many 
of the following sites and apps do more than what I highlight here. Explore 
the different sites and see whether certain ones suit you best.
There’s no shortage of places where you can get stock quotes and see the 
value of popular market indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 
Standard & Poor’s 500 index, and NASDAQ composite index. That’s why you 
can afford to demand more from websites if they’re going to earn a posi-
tion as one of your favorites. In Chapter 6, I list multiple sites best suited for 
tracking specific parts of the market. But the next section in this chapter has 
a quick list that can help you get started creating general‐purpose online 
investing favorites or decide which apps are worthy of occupying space on 
your phone. The sites listed here make the cut because they not only provide 
stock quotes but also go a step further by being the best at a certain aspect 
of tracking the market.
When you look up a stock quote on many sites or in an app, you’ll usually 
see three quotes: the last sale, the bid, and the ask. The last sale is what you 
probably think of as the stock quote and is what is featured on most web-
sites. That’s the price at which a buyer and seller agreed to a transaction. 

40
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
The bid, though, is the highest price other investors are willing to pay for the 
stock. The ask is the lowest price investors who own the stock are willing to 
sell it for.
Getting price quotes on  
markets and stocks
Nearly any site or finance app can give you stock quotes for the day, includ-
ing the financial news websites discussed later in this chapter. But a few sites 
deserve special mention because they make it easy to get stock quotes for 
days in the past and even download them to your computer for further analy-
sis. And because they deserve special mention, they’re getting it right here:
✓
✓MSN Money (http://money.msn.com) is handy for looking up prices 
of stocks and market indexes because it’s fast and gives you everything 
you need, ranging from the stock’s closing price to how much trading 
activity there was when dividends (cash payments) were paid to inves-
tors. One nifty trick of MSN Money is that it has a companion app for 
Windows 10, iOS, and Android that remembers which stocks you’re most 
interested in. You can create this list by clicking the My Watchlist tab on 
the website or on the Watchlist menu in the app.
✓
✓Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) lets you download 
historical data, too, a feature that’s getting surprisingly scarce in non‐
professional tools. Enter a stock symbol and click the Look Up button. 
Then, in the left column, click the Historical Prices link. You’ll see a page 
with a table of dates and the stock’s prices on those dates. In the Set 
Date Range area near the top, you can pick a range of dates you’d like 
stock prices for. Below the table (scroll down a bit) is a link to Download 
to Spreadsheet. Yahoo! Finance also offers an app for several smart-
phones, making it a convenient choice.
✓
✓Google Finance (www.google.com/finance) does a solid job of sum-
marizing in one page many of the basics you need to know about a stock. 
You’ll find not only the stock price, but also a list of competitors, a sum-
mary of how Wall Street experts feel about the stock, and basic financial 
information. Google Finance also offers free real‐time stock prices.
✓
✓FreeStockCharts.com (www.freestockcharts.com) gives you great 
flexibility in creating stock charts, allowing you to add all sorts of dif-
ferent indicators that show you how a stock is doing. And unlike most 
other stock sites, FreeStockCharts lets you download the end‐of‐year 
values of investments. End‐of‐year data is helpful when you want to see 
how an investment has performed over the long haul.

Slicing and dicing the markets
Although quite a few market indexes exist — I discuss many of them in 
Chapter 8 — all online investors need to be familiar with some major market 
benchmarks. These are the ones so commonly discussed that they need 
to be part of your investor vocabulary. Table 2‐1 presents them in all their 
market‐dominating glory.
Knowing your exchanges
When you get a stock quote from most web­
sites, you also see what exchange the stock 
trades on. This is important information. Most 
stocks typically trade on one of three major 
exchanges in the United States: the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ, and the  
American Stock Exchange. The NYSE and  
the NASDAQ are by far the largest and are the  
exchanges for the biggest companies in 
the world.
Stocks trade other places besides the NYSE 
and NASDAQ. You find foreign exchanges 
(which I cover in more detail in Bonus Chapter 1 
on the web) and informal marketplaces such as 
the Pink Sheets and OTC Bulletin Board. Many 
beginning online investors are attracted to the 
Pink Sheets and OTC Bulletin Board stocks 
due to their low share prices and high volatil­
ity, which is why they’re called penny stocks 
or microcap stocks. But buying stocks on the 
Pink Sheets and Bulletin Board can be very 
risky. The Pink Sheets and Bulletin Board don’t 
have the same oversight of their stocks, making 
them popular with fraudsters. You can read the 
Securities and Exchange Commission warnings 
to investors about these stocks here: www.
sec.gov/investor/pubs/microcap 
stock.htm.
Table 2-1	
Key Market Indexes
Index Name
What It Measures
Dow Jones 
Industrial Average
Thirty big, industrial companies. When investors hear about 
“the market,” more often than not they think of the Dow.
Standard & Poor’s 
500 index
Big companies, including 500 of the nation’s most well‐known 
stocks. Moves very similarly to the Dow, even though it 
includes more stocks.
NASDAQ 
Composite index
Stocks that trade on the NASDAQ stock market. It tends to 
closely track technology stocks.
Wilshire 5000 Total 
Market index
The entire stock market. Contains all significant stocks from the 
largest to the smallest.
Russell 2000 index
Small‐company stocks. Tends to be more volatile than indexes 
that track large companies — the S&P 500, for example.

Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Nearly all financial websites let you track all the indexes listed in the table. 
Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com), though, makes it easy to 
monitor how different slices of the markets are doing, such as foreign stocks, 
specific industry sectors, and bonds. The Yahoo! Finance website offers a 
couple of different ways for you to dig beyond the market indexes, as the fol-
lowing list makes clear:
✓
✓Get a quick read on all U.S. market indexes. To see how most of the 
key U.S. market indexes are doing, start at Yahoo! Finance’s main page 
at http://finance.yahoo.com. Click the Stocks link that opens if 
you hover your cursor over the Market Data option at the left side of 
the page. You can then see many market indexes by clicking the dif-
ferent tabs, such as S&P, Dow Jones, and Other US Indices. The Other 
US Indices heading appears to the right of where you see the NYSE tab 
below the US & World Indices heading.
✓
✓Get a rundown of how foreign stocks are doing. Click the Stocks link 
that magically appears when you hover your cursor over the Market 
Data option on the left‐hand side. Change the drop‐down option on  
the right side, set to U.S. by default, to a different region, say “Europe.” 
The drop‐down box is located pretty far to the right of the page — just 
to the left of where you’ll probably see an advertisement. A new page 
opens that lets you monitor just about any foreign market you’d care 
to track. Bonus Chapter 1 on the web (www.dummies.com/bonus 
chapters/investingonline) tells you more about investing in 
­international stocks.
✓
✓Get a summary of industry performances. The Yahoo! Finance page 
allows you to track how different industries are doing, if you know where 
to look. The easiest way I’ve found is this link: http://biz.yahoo.
com/p/. Set it as a favorite, or you’ll never find it again.
How the Dow’s value is calculated
Market indexes, such as the Dow, are not priced 
by traders, but by calculators. Mathematical 
formulas analyze the movements of the stocks 
contained inside an index to arrive at the value 
of the index. To get the value of the Dow, for 
instance, the prices of the 30 stocks in the index 
are multiplied by a divisor and added together. 
The divisor is used to smooth out interruptions 
that would be caused if stocks were replaced in 
the index for different reasons. (You can always 
look up the divisor of the Dow here: www. 
djaverages.com.) You’ll need to register to 
get the divisor, but registration is free. You can 
read more about indexes in Chapter 8.

Don’t confuse stocks with indexes. Stocks are shares in individual companies, 
such as General Electric or Exxon Mobil. The prices of stocks reflect how much 
you would have to pay for a share of the stock. Indexes, on the other hand, 
are mathematical formulas that tell you how much a collection of stocks has 
changed in value. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which contains 
30 stocks, hits 16,000, that doesn’t mean you can buy it for $16,000. It’s just a 
number that represents relative value.
Your crystal ball: Predicting  
how the day will begin
Some investors like to get a jump‐start on the trading day by watching the 
futures market. The futures market is an auction for future contracts, which 
are financial obligations that allow their buyers and sellers to lock in prices 
for commodities and other assets in the future. The futures market allows 
investors to bet how much certain assets will be worth minutes, day, weeks, 
or years from today. Futures are commonly used with commodities, such as 
energy and food, as I describe in more detail in Chapter 6.
You can see what the futures market is saying about stocks, too. Bloomberg, 
a major financial news and data company, gives investors a sneak peek on 
how stocks could open the next trading day. On its Futures page (www.
bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/futures), you can see how traders 
who apparently don’t have anything better to do are betting after the stock 
market is closed and how major market indexes around the world will open. 
If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t like surprises, it’s an easy way to see 
how investors are behaving even when the market centers are closed.
Getting company descriptions
Professional investors like to bone up on what a company does, who’s in 
charge, and how profitable it is without pouring through dozens of industry 
reports. You can get the same kind of quick snapshot information with online 
company descriptions. All the main investing sites I discuss have sections 
that describe the business a company is in. Here are a few more sites worth 
checking out:
✓
✓Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks): This site offers in‐
depth profiles on companies. Just enter the name of the company you 
want to know about, click the Search button, and click the name of the 
company. The page that opens shows you all the vital information about 
the company, ranging from the names of its management team (if you 
click the People tab) to a description of what it does. You can also see a 

44
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
comprehensive rundown of company information on the right side of the 
page, including data on the company’s competitors and earnings.
✓
✓Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com): Offers a comprehen-
sive summary of a company’s information. From the site’s main page, 
enter the stock’s symbol in the Quote Lookup box located on the left‐
hand side of the screen and click the Go button. Click the Profile link on 
the left‐hand side of the page. If you click the Competitors link on the 
left‐hand side of the page, Yahoo! Finance identifies other companies in 
the industry.
Keeping tabs on commodities
I have more on the exciting world of commodities — such as the oil, lumber, 
and coal that companies use to make their products — in Chapter 6, but if 
you can’t wait until then, check out the following websites:
✓
✓Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities) has a 
professional‐grade site that lets you watch movements in just about any 
commodity that you can imagine, including gold, silver, and platinum. 
Interested in live cattle? Yes, you can see the price. This data is neces-
sary if you want to invest in commodities directly. Still, even if you don’t 
buy or sell commodities, they’re good to watch. For instance, if you 
own shares of Starbucks, wouldn’t you want to know what the price of 
coffee is doing?
✓
✓CME Group (www.cmegroup.com) lists prices on many of the major 
commodities such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and ethanol. I describe this 
site (and commodities‐centric sites) in more detail in Chapter 6.
Tracking bonds and U.S. Treasurys
A bond is an IOU issued by a government, a company, or another borrower. An 
owner of a bond is entitled to receive the borrowed funds when they’re paid 
back by a certain time in the future at a predetermined interest rate. Even if 
you have no interest in investing in bonds, you still should know what rates 
are doing. After all, if you could invest in bonds issued by the federal govern-
ment that come due in 30 years — bonds known as Treasury bonds — and get 
9 percent annual returns guaranteed, wouldn’t you be a bit less enthusiastic 
about a risky stock that you think will return only 10 percent? The U.S. govern-
ment sells other Treasurys, including Treasury bills (T‐bills), that generally 
come due in a year or less and Treasury notes (T‐notes) that come due in 
longer than a year but in ten years or less. I provide more details in Chapter 6 
on how bond yields affect stock prices, but a few sites to start you out with 
include the following:

45

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
✓
✓Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates‐bonds) makes 
tracking bonds very easy. Bloomberg lets you, at a glance, see the yields 
on just about any major bond or Treasury you can imagine.
✓
✓Federal Reserve Bank (www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/ 
openmarket.htm) is the online presence for “the Fed,” as it’s affection-
ately called. The Fed is in charge of strongly influencing short‐term inter-
est rates, including the federal funds rate. That’s typically the rate banks 
lend money stored at the Fed to other banks overnight. No, you can’t 
borrow at that rate, but it’s very important to watch this interest rate 
because it affects long‐term interest rates, which you can borrow at. You 
can see what the federal funds rate has been at the Fed’s site, as shown 
in Figure 2‐2. Traders buy and sell long‐term Treasurys and set interest 
rates based in large part on where short‐term rates are or where they’re 
expected to be.
If you’d like to find out more about how the Fed affects the nation’s money 
supply, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City maintains a useful and 
simple site on the topic — designed for teens and college students, but 
useful for any investor — at www.federalreserveeducation.org/
about‐the‐fed/structure‐and‐functions/monetary‐policy/.
Monitoring Market‐Moving News
Ever see a biotech stock skyrocket after the company announces a break-
through treatment? Tech stocks routinely jump in price on the debut of 
popular new gadgets or software. That’s the power of news — often called 
market‐moving news. Markets are constantly taking in and digesting all sorts 
of developments and changes, both good and bad. And to stay on top of 
Figure 2-2:  
The Fed’s 
website 
makes it 
easy to 
track 
­important 
interest 
rates.

46
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
these developments, you’ll want to set a few leading financial news sites as 
favorites. The following sections explore the different kinds of financial news 
sites in greater detail.
Financial websites
Many of the financial sites mentioned earlier in the chapter are also great 
places to get market‐moving news. Yahoo! Finance and MSN Money pick up 
stories written by wire services on the markets and on individual stocks, 
making them helpful resources. Bloomberg covers just about every type of 
traditional investment you can imagine, thanks to its network of reporters. 
Others I haven’t mentioned include the following:
✓
✓Google News (http://news.google.com) has a business section 
that pulls in important financial stories in one place. Its best feature is 
the capability to search for news based on very precise criteria, includ-
ing keywords, the date the story appeared, or the geographic location 
of the news.
✓
✓Bing News (www.bing.com/news) also searches the Internet for busi-
ness stories (if you click the Business tab). You can also set business 
as an “Interest” by clicking “Manage how you track this Interest” to get 
business news featured on the Bing mobile app.
✓
✓Briefing.com (www.briefing.com) is similar to the kind of data ser-
vices that professional investors use to follow news. See Figure 2‐3. In 
fact, most of Briefing.com’s service is for large traders and investors 
who pay for its platinum or trader services. Still, the site makes some of 
its content available, for free, to regular investors. You can find running 
commentary on market‐moving news and events. Briefing.com’s stock 
market update is a great way to find out what’s behind the market’s day‐
to‐day swings so that you can see how any random event can have a big 
effect on stocks.
✓
✓MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com) focuses on business stories 
that are clickable. The site attempts to separate itself from the compe-
tition by providing columns from various financial writers who opine 
about everything from companies’ accounting practices to technology. 
MarketWatch has a feature that lets you instruct it to email you articles 
of interest. You can also have it send you an email if a stock moves by a 
certain amount.
✓
✓BigCharts.com (www.bigcharts.com) is a service of MarketWatch 
that’s dedicated to serving up graphical information about the markets. 
The best aspect of the site is the set of BigReports lists that show you, at 
a glance, what the biggest movers on Wall Street were that day in terms 
of price or percentage price change.

47

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
✓
✓Motley Fool (www.fool.com) has a little something for everyone. You 
find content for the active trader, including stock tips galore, as well as 
tricks and techniques on how to deeply analyze companies’ financial 
statements. Passive investors, though, will appreciate the more general 
personal finance stories.
✓
✓Reuters (www.reuters.com) makes high‐end systems used by many 
professional traders. And it has put many of the same tools into your 
hands. If you enter a ticker symbol in the search box at the upper‐right 
corner of the page and then click the company’s name, you can see 
advanced statistics about the stock, including things like dividend 
yields and key ratios. (Don’t worry. I cover all this advanced stuff in 
Chapters 14 and 15.)
Many financial websites and news stories use the terms bullish and bearish. 
When investors are bullish, they think the stock market is going to go up. And 
when investors are bearish, they think stocks will go down.
Traditional financial news sites
Many of the financial news providers you might already be familiar with from 
newspapers, magazines, and TV also provide data that’s useful to investors 
online, including the following:
✓
✓USA TODAY’s Money section (http://money.usatoday.com) 
­delivers the business news that affects you. (Disclosure: I’m a full‐time 
reporter at USA TODAY.) You can find not only the breaking news stories 
from wire services, but also enterprise stories you won’t find anywhere 
Figure 2-3:  
Briefing.
com 
­provides 
many free 
resources to 
online 
investors.

else on beats ranging from markets to business travel and cars. You can 
find extensive personal finance and mutual fund coverage. And if you 
have any specific investing questions, check out my online column, Ask 
Matt, where you can email me questions and I’ll publish the answer. 
You can read the answer to questions Ask Matt readers have asked — 
and other stories I’ve written — at this archive: www.usatoday.com/
staff/1035/matt‐krantz.
The site also gives readers a quick summary of key statistics about 
stocks. Figure 2‐4 shows the summary page for General Electric.
Do you speak ticker symbol?
Nearly every financial website is centered on the ticker symbol. These are the one‐, two‐, three‐, or 
four‐letter abbreviations used to symbolize stocks or investments. Originally, ticker symbols were 
used so that brokers could quickly read a ticker tape, a scrolling printout of stocks and prices. But 
the symbol has taken on a new use in the online era, so much so that most sites have an empty 
text box at the top where you enter the symbol first, click a button, and then get sent to another 
part of the site where you’re handed all the information pertaining to that stock on a silver platter.
Ticker symbols have become so popular that investors sometimes use them instead of a company’s 
name. And sometimes companies have fun with their symbols to make them more memorable. In 
2006, for instance, motorcycle maker Harley‐Davidson changed its symbol from the boring HDI to 
the more exciting HOG, the nickname for its rumbling bikes. Other fun ticker symbols include the 
following:
Ticker
Company
CAKE
Cheesecake Factory
HOT
Starwood Hotels
LUV
Southwest Airlines
WOOF
VCA Antech (a veterinary company)
ZEUS
Olympic Steel (Get it? The Greek god)
EAT
Brinker (a restaurant company)
SAM
Boston Beer
Keep one other thing in mind regarding stock symbols. You used to be able to tell whether a stock 
traded on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange just by looking at the symbol. For many 
years, NASDAQ stocks traded with symbols with four letters, such as INTC for Intel and MSFT for 
Microsoft. But that changed in 2007 when NASDAQ began issuing symbols of one, two, and three 
letters to its member companies. Delta Financial was the first NASDAQ stock to have three letters, 
with its symbol DFS. Delta Financial, however, was ultimately delisted from the NASDAQ at the 
end of 2007 as the credit crunch got started. The DFS symbol is now held by Discover Financial.

✓
✓The Wall Street Journal Online (www.wsj.com) is a source of breaking 
financial news. You might be familiar with the print edition of the Wall 
Street Journal; this is the online version. This site charges for much of 
its content.
✓
✓Financial Times (www.ft.com) is a London‐based business publication, 
so it provides a unique spin on business events here. It’s a good source 
of merger announcements.
✓
✓CNBC (www.cnbc.com) routinely updates its website, and now the 
financial TV channel’s online presence offers many of the same things as 
other financial news sites. What makes it unique is that it lets you view 
segments that aired on CNBC that you might have missed. The segments 
are streamed to your browser, saving you the trouble of being in front 
of your TV.
✓
✓CNN Money (http://money.cnn.com) has a good mix of breaking 
financial news and general personal financial help. It contains special-
ized information on markets, technology, jobs, personal finance, and 
real estate.
✓
✓Investor’s Business Daily (www.investors.com) is largely geared for 
active investors and allows subscribers to read the next day’s paper 
early. The site also has tools to help you find stocks that are outperform-
ing the rest of the stock market.
✓
✓Barron’s (www.barrons.com) is a weekly publication written mainly 
for more advanced investors. Most of the features are available only to 
subscribers. Subscribers to the Wall Street Journal’s website get a price 
break on Barron’s online site because both are owned by Dow Jones.

Checking In on Wall Street Chatter
Rumor and innuendo are key parts to traders’ lives. Because stock prices 
are highly sensitive in the short run to what other traders and investors are 
saying about a stock, traders make it their business to follow any murmur. As 
an individual investor, you’re somewhat at a disadvantage in this department 
because you don’t have portfolio managers of giant mutual funds calling you 
and telling you what they’re hearing. But you can use what’s become known 
as “social networking” or social investing, which are online tools that allow 
investors to swap information with each other. Chat rooms were an early 
form of social investing, but the area has evolved to include online blogs and 
podcasts if you’re interested in the scuttlebutt. Twitter, an online messaging 
system used to share quick and short bits of information, has also become a 
new tool for investors. Several online brokers’ sites also let users communi-
cate with each other. I cover all these forms of communication in more detail 
in Chapter 7.
If you’re a passive investor, you probably couldn’t care less about rumors. 
Even so, you can take advantage of blogs and chat rooms that are dedicated 
to index investing. Just remember that these are casual and sometimes unre-
liable ways to keep up with the market chatter on various topics.
Beware of rumors
Investors can’t help themselves when it comes 
to rumors. And sometimes certain blogs and 
podcasts only feed your innate desire to get the 
inside scoop on an investment that’s about to 
explode in value. Investment rumors are kind 
of like celebrity gossip: You’re probably better 
off ignoring them, but sometimes it’s impossible 
to resist. Just remember that making invest­
ment decisions based on rumors is usually a 
very bad idea.
Even giant stocks can get swept up in rumors 
and result in pain for gullible investors. Here’s 
an example: On May 17, 2012, Facebook, the 
world’s largest social networking company, 
sold its stock to public investors for the first 
time for $38 a share. The website is so popu­
lar with consumers that quickly the rumor mill 
went into overdrive. Many people with little 
to no experience with investing thought they 
had to jump into the initial public offering of 
Facebook since it was bound to soar on its first 
day. But these rumors proved to be far wrong. 
Shares of Facebook barely moved on their first 
day of trading and the stock lost 22 percent of 
its value from the offering price by the end of 
May. Shares have since performed very well, 
but investors who bought on the rumor had to 
endure a long period of pain which might not be 
what they expected. That’s one rumor investors 
would have been better off ignoring.

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
Everyone is an expert: Checking  
in with blogs
Thanks to low‐cost computers, mobile devices, and Internet connections, just 
about anyone with an opinion and a keyboard or smartphone can profess his 
or her view of investments to the world. Some of these opinions are worth 
listening to, but many are not. One popular vehicle for sharing opinions is a 
blog (short for web log), which is a sort of an online journal. Blogs can vary 
greatly in quality. Some are the modern‐day equivalent of a crazy person on 
the street corner yelling at anyone who walks by, whereas other blogs are 
thoughtful and well‐informed. It’s buyer beware with blogs, and you have to 
decide whether the person is worth listening to. Ask yourself what the blog-
ger’s track record is and how the blogger makes money.
Finding blogs
With so many blogs out there, sometimes the toughest part can be finding the 
ones that are worthwhile. Here are several ways that you can locate them:
✓
✓General search engines: All the leading search engines, including 
Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, let you search much of the blogging world. If 
it’s a major blog, you’re likely to find it just by searching this way: Just 
enter the word investing blog in Bing.com, for example, and you can 
find general‐interest finance blogs. Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.
yahoo.com) also has a way to pull in relevant posts from financial blogs 
that makes the searching easier. Just enter a stock symbol and, when the 
page for that particular stock appears, click the Market Pulse link under 
the News & Info heading on the left side of the page. (I discuss how to 
turn search engines into your investment tools later in this chapter.) 
Enter a stock symbol into Google Finance (www.google.com/finance) 
and click News, and you can find blog posts mentioning the stock.
✓
✓Community sites: Facebook (www.facebook.com) is best known as 
an online place for friends to keep tabs on each other and for families 
to share photos with each other. But some financial blogs are also lurk-
ing there. To find them, just log on to the site and search for the words 
financial, money, investing, and stocks.
✓
✓Mainstream media: Almost all the news sites have some of their writers 
penning blogs as well. Many blogs are available from the mainstream 
media outlet’s website or via Really Simple Syndication (RSS), which 
I explain in the later section “Getting your computer to do the work: 
RSS feeds.”

52
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Getting in tune with podcasts
Next time you see someone listening to a smartphone with earphone cords 
dangling from his ears, don’t assume that he’s rocking out. He might be 
researching stocks or learning about investing. A podcast is an audio broad-
cast that’s transferred electronically over the Internet to your computer, 
smartphone, or MP3 player — they’re like radio shows for the Internet age. 
Like blogs, podcasts are often done by amateurs, so the same need for cau-
tion applies. But also like blogs, some podcasts are done by major media.
Finding podcasts
It’s easy to find a radio or TV station: Just turn on the radio and start flipping. 
But finding podcasts takes a little more doing. It’s not difficult, though, if you 
try these different methods:
✓
✓Podcast search engines: Most of the major online search companies 
have special online tools to help you pinpoint podcasts. You can also 
use a search engine dedicated to podcasts, such as PodcastDirectory.
com (www.podcastdirectory.com), which lets you enter search 
terms and then get a giant list of podcasts that meet your requirements. 
Stitcher Radio (www.stitcher.com) is another popular podcast 
search site.
✓
✓Audio software: Apple’s iTunes software (www.apple.com/itunes), 
for instance, has an excellent podcast search function as part of its 
iTunes Store, which you can access from the Store link. Click the 
Podcasts link and then click Business, and you can scroll through hun-
dreds of available podcasts, including some from mainstream outlets like 
Bloomberg Businessweek, CNBC, and National Public Radio. There are 
mobile apps with similar functionality. The Podcasts app for Windows 
Mobile allows you to type keywords and find podcasts that match.
Listening to podcasts
You can listen to most podcasts in three ways:
✓
✓Listen on the site. You can listen to most podcasts by clicking a link, 
usually labeled Listen, directly on the site.
✓
✓Download. Some podcasts let you click a Download button or, with 
Windows PCs, you can often also right‐click the Listen link and down-
load the podcasts.

53

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
✓
✓Subscribe. You can install special software that searches your favorite 
podcasts and automatically downloads new episodes when they’re avail-
able. An option for both Windows and Mac users is downloading and 
installing Apple’s iTunes software (www.itunes.com). iTunes handles 
all aspects of listening to podcasts, ranging from finding podcasts 
to subscribing to them so that they’re automatically downloaded to 
your computer.
Taming Twitter
Social media like Facebook and Twitter are increasingly the go‐to places to 
keep on top of real‐time business news from major outlets. Here’s the quick‐
and‐dirty of what you need to get set up: Download TweetDeck (tweetdeck. 
twitter.com). The app, which is available for computer and mobile devices, 
allows you to search for news outlets, bloggers, or other sources of market 
news and “follow them.” Once you follow these outlets, TweetDeck will moni-
tor Twitter and present you with all the news being “Tweeted out” so you 
won’t miss a thing. TweetDeck is the easiest way I’ve found to keep up with 
the action on Twitter. And it’s free; you just need to sign up for Twitter. You 
can get more detail on how to turn Facebook and Twitter into a treasure 
trove of investing information in Chapter 7.
Getting your computer to do the work:  
RSS feeds
If you want to read investing news, read blogs, or listen to podcasts, you can 
use the Favorites feature of your web browser to bookmark a bunch of the 
sites I mention in this chapter and then methodically make your way down 
your Favorites list at your leisure. But some online investors don’t have time 
for that, so many still rely on technology called RSS feeds, short for Rich Site 
Summary and often called Really Simple Syndication. RSS feeds are kind of 
like notices sent out by some blogs, podcasts, and news sites to let the world 
know that something new is available. If you use RSS feeds, you subscribe to 
a news website, blog, or podcast, and the news comes to you.
Yes, I know, Twitter is quickly replacing RSS as a source of real‐time news, 
but RSS is still worth being aware of because it’s still widely available. Many 
companies still use RSS to notify the public they’ve released new information.

54
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
It’s easy to get started. First you need to have a way to receive the RSS feeds. 
You have three main ways to do this:
✓
✓Use your web browser. If you’re like I am, you like to install as little 
software on your computer as you can get away with, and you don’t like 
signing up for all kinds of web services. If that describes you, you might 
consider checking to see whether your Internet browser supports RSS. 
The latest versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 10 and 11, 
make it pretty easy — and this is really the best option to get RSS feeds.
You’ll first need to turn on the command bar. To do this, right‐click on 
the Favorites star, a star icon located on the upper right‐hand corner of 
the browser window, and choose Command Bar. Next, go to the website 
you’d like to subscribe to and click the orange RSS Feed icon, located in 
the browser’s command bar below the right arrow in the upper left‐hand 
side of the page. You’ll see a list of all the available RSS feeds from the 
site, like the one shown in Figure 2‐5. Click the Subscribe to This Feed 
icon, which looks like a gold star with a green plus sign. A dialog box 
opens, letting you name the feed and click Subscribe. After you sub-
scribe, just click the Favorites icon (a gold star located on the left side of 
the browser’s menu bar) and select the Feeds tab, and you see a list of 
all the updates that were pulled in for you.
If you don’t yet have the latest version of Internet Explorer, you can 
download it here: www.microsoft.com/windows/internet‐
explorer/default.aspx. Keep in mind that whereas Edge is the 
preferred browser in Windows 10, Internet Explorer is still available. Just 
type Internet Explorer into the Cortana search box and click the link. 
Cortana, named after the artificial‐intelligence character in the “Halo” 
video game, is the Windows 10 search option. If you’re looking for any-
thing in Windows 10, you can type search terms into the Cortana search 
box — or get this — just literally ask your computer to find it (as long 
as it has a microphone). Cortana will then help you find what you were 
looking for.
✓
✓Install an RSS reader. An RSS reader lets you tell the computer what 
websites you’d like to subscribe to. The RSS reader software then pulls 
the feeds that contain articles from all the different news sites you’ve 
chosen and presents them all to you in one page. Because RSS read-
ers are software, the RSS articles the reader downloads are stored 
on your hard drive so that you can read them later, even if you’re not 
connected to the Internet. Given the rise of social media, many compa-
nies have stopped making RSS reader software. FeedDemon (http://
FeedDemon.com) is probably your best choice — it still works — but is 
no longer being supported with updates. There are other options such 
as RSS Reader Live (available in the Windows 10 store), which runs on 
computers and tablets.

55

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
✓
✓Subscribe to a web‐based RSS aggregator. An aggregator creates a 
tailor‐made page with all the RSS feeds you’ve requested. You can think 
of an aggregator as a web‐based RSS reader. So, instead of logging on to 
individual sites or downloading reader software, you log on to this one 
site that has dutifully pulled in all the RSS feeds you’ve subscribed to. 
Google abandoned its popular RSS aggregator, but Digg Reader (digg.
com/reader) has largely taken its place. There’s a catch to many of 
these RSS aggregators: You must be connected to the Internet to read 
your RSS feeds.
After you get your RSS software, web‐based reader, or browser set up, it’s 
easy to start getting RSS feeds. Just navigate to your favorite investing sites 
and look for links that say “RSS Feed” or “XML” and click them. Your reader, 
aggregator, or browser then gives you instructions on how to subscribe.
Keeping Tabs on the Regulators
Professional traders’ computers also keep close tabs on regulatory filings 
from companies. Regulatory filings are often the best, if not the only, data 
that investors get directly from a company. If companies make any signifi-
cant announcements, they’re required to notify the appropriate government 
watchdogs, which in most cases is the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I cover these important documents and what they contain in more detail 
in Chapter 12, but for now, it’s important for you to know how to monitor 
these documents and quickly find them online. You can get regulatory filings 
online through
✓
✓The company’s website: Most provide a section with their complete  
reports.
✓
✓Financial sites and portals: Most of the sites I list earlier in the chapter 
provide links to the documents.
✓
✓Aggregation sites: These sites parse the filings from companies and 
make them easy to find and download for free. SEC Info (www.secinfo.
com) sorts all the regulatory filings into easy‐to‐understand categories. 
Last10K.com (www.last10k.com) allows you to find quickly compa-
nies’ financial reports. You also can find fee‐based services, such as

might even send you an email the second a company files a report. 
Depending on your needs, those might be worth your money.

✓The Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov): For most 
investors, the free SEC site has as much info as any sane person would 
ever want, and it isn’t too difficult to navigate to boot.
In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission site is so easy to navigate 
that I’m going to show you how to do it right now. To find company regula-
tory filings, follow these steps:
1.	Point your web browser to www.sec.gov.
The SEC site makes an appearance.
2.	Hover your mouse over the Filings tab and choose the Company 
Filings Search link.
The Search the EDGAR Database page appears.
3.	Enter the company’s name or ticker symbol into the appropriate box, 
and then click the Search button.
You see a giant list of company filings in the order they were filed, as 
shown in Figure 2‐6.
It’s an intimidating list that’s hardly user‐friendly because the forms are 
distinguished only by their form, which is regulatory code for the types 
of information the documents contain. Table 2‐2 gives you the skinny 
on what the various form codes mean. I don’t include all the form codes 
because there are so many. Several of the form codes are for documents 
you don’t need to worry about or for data you can get more easily else-
where, including when officers of the company sell stock.

Table 2-2	
SEC Forms You Can Use
Form Code
What It Contains
8‐K
A news flash from the company. 8‐Ks can contain just about anything 
that’s considered “material” or important to investors, ranging from the 
resignation of a top official to news of the win of a new customer.
10‐Q
The company’s quarterly report. This form displays all the information a 
company is required to provide to investors each quarter. Here you can 
find the key financial statements, such as the income statement and 
balance sheet, which are covered in more detail in Chapter 12.
10‐K
The company’s year‐end report. This is one of the most important 
­documents a company creates. It gives you a summary of everything 
that happened during the year, including comments from management 
and financial statements that have been checked, or audited, by the 
company’s accounting firm.
DEF 14 
and DEF 
14A
The company’s proxy statement — a document that describes company 
matters to be discussed and voted on by shareholders at the annual 
meeting. Contains all the important company information that’s subject 
to shareholder approval and scrutiny. Most proxies contain everything 
that’s up for a vote at the shareholder meeting, ranging from board 
members up for election, pay packages and other perks, and pending 
lawsuits. If you’re going to read any document, make it this one.

Companies don’t make their regulatory filings easy to read. You have to be 
part lawyer, part investor, and part investment banker to read between the 
lines in these often‐cryptic statements (and, if you’re interested, Investment 
Banking for Dummies (Wiley), co‐authored by myself, goes into the nitty‐
gritty). I cover the basics in Chapter 12 and teach you how to pick apart  
10‐Ks, 10‐Qs, and DEF 14s. But other online resources can help, including
✓
✓Footnoted.org (www.footnoted.org), a business blog that studies 
proxies and pinpoints things that smell fishy.
✓
✓The Analyst’s Accounting Observer (www.accountingobserver.
com), which is published by well‐known accounting watchdog Jack 
Ciesielski, who is trained to find suspicious things in company filings.
✓
✓Major mainstream media also pick the proxy statements apart and find 
things that stand out. USA TODAY, for example, routinely analyzes proxy 
statements, looking for details about CEO compensation, including  
this story that found that the 12 top‐paid CEOs hauled in $654 million  
in pay — in just 2014 (http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/ 
2015/04/15/winners‐of‐ceo‐jackpot‐top‐12‐paid‐654m/).
Executing Trades
With all this talk about researching and analyzing, don’t forget what job No. 1 
is: buying or selling investments. You need to either log on to the website of 
your broker or download special software from your brokers that can handle 
the trades. I go over the dizzying number of choices you have for online bro-
kers in Chapter 4.
Searching the Internet High and Low
If you can’t find what you’re looking for by using the tips and techniques in 
the preceding sections, it might be time to hit the main web search engines. 
Some of the most popular search engines include
✓
✓Google (www.google.com): Definitely the biggest and most popular 
web search engine, so much so that investors often say they’ll google 
a stock. Because the site is so clean and Zen‐like, it has the benefit of 
being very easy to use.
✓
✓Bing (www.bing.com): Microsoft’s attempt to come up with a Google 
killer, Bing.com has a few niceties for online investors, including the 
capability to quickly pull up stock quotes and charts by entering stock 
and also the company’s name or ticker symbol. For example, to get a 
quick datasheet on General Electric, type stock GE. Clicking the informa-
tion box takes you to MSN Money for more analysis.

59

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
✓
✓Wolfram Alpha (www.wolframalpha.com): Is a lesser‐known search 
engine than the giants, but still has some valuable features. If you enter 
the ticker symbol of a stock, Wolfram Alpha generates an impressive 
page filled with all sorts of company information. Wolfram Alpha will cal-
culate some advanced statistical information, for instance, that shows 
you how well the stock has done over different time periods.
✓
✓Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo! remains the go‐to search place for 
many consumers. Yahoo! Finance has excellent resources for inves-
tors, as described earlier in this chapter, so it’s logical to try the site for 
searching, too.
Keeping the Bad Guys Out:  
Securing Your PC
If you’re going to use your computer to process your investing and banking 
tasks, you’d better lock it down. Cyber‐criminals have gotten sophisticated 
and have targeted online investors in hopes of gaining control of a person’s 
account and stealing money.
Please, don’t let such concerns scare you off from investing online. After all, 
cars get broken into and you still drive. It’s just that you must take certain 
precautions to make it harder for the bad guys to get into your PC, such as
✓
✓Installing antivirus software: If a sinister code designed to wreak havoc 
on your computer gets in your machine, it can be a real hassle. Viruses 
can corrupt system files and make your computer unreliable or unus-
able. Antivirus software is the easy solution. It runs in the background, 
looks at any program that tries to run on your computer, and stops the 
program if it tries to do something improper.
You can go to all sorts of great lengths to lock down your aging computer, 
but really, the best defense is upgraded equipment running a modern 
operating system. Windows 10 comes with built‐in security that’s good 
enough for you — unless you’re the Pentagon. Windows Defender, which 
is built into Windows 10 and also Windows 8, runs efficiently and is 
pretty much all you need.
But for those of you who are truly paranoid, many antivirus software 
programs are available, including
•	Free versions: If you’re still running Windows 7, just upgrade to 
Windows 10. If you just can’t bear to part with Windows 7, one option  
is to download and install a free antivirus software program. Microsoft  
offers its own free antivirus software, called Microsoft Security 
Essentials (www.microsoft.com/security_essentials), 
which has gotten good reviews for being effective without slowing­ 

60
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
your computer down. Other free options include AVG Free (http:// 
free.avg.com/us‐en/homepage) and Avast Free (www.avast.
com/free‐antivirus‐download).
•	Commercial: Antivirus programs from McAfee (www.mcafee.com), 
Symantec (www.symantec.com), Kaspersky (usa.kaspersky.
com), and TrendMicro (www.trendmicro.com/us/indexnight.
html) are popular. But these will cost you — and are most likely 
overkill for most users.
✓
✓Installing antispyware software: Spyware is software that attaches itself 
to your computer without your permission and runs behind the scenes. 
It’s especially sinister because it might forward personal information 
to a third party, usually for marketing purposes. Microsoft Security 
Essentials can automatically scan the computer and make sure that no 
spyware has hitched a ride on your computer. You can also find dedi-
cated software programs designed to sniff out spyware. Malwarebytes 
(www.malwarebytes.org) probably has the greatest name — and 
works well.
✓
✓Using firewalls: A firewall is an electronic barrier that (selectively) 
separates you from the Internet at large. A proper firewall is like a moat 
around a castle — only traffic that you lower the drawbridge for can get 
in. You can use the following types of firewalls:
•	Built‐in: If you have Microsoft’s Windows 7, Vista, Windows 8, or 
Windows 10, you have a firewall turned on by default.
•	Router: The other way to protect your computer with a firewall is 
to install a router. A router is a small box that sits between your 
computer and the wall jack that connects you to the Internet. Many 
routers work like a software firewall and can even make your com-
puter invisible to other computers. Depending on your router, you 
might need to enable the firewall. Check the router’s instructions 
to find out how.
•	Third‐party software: A number of companies make firewall soft-
ware, some of which is free. ZoneAlarm Internet Security (www.
zonealarm.com) is one option, which offers a free version and a 
more advanced version called ZoneAlarm Extreme that costs $45. 
Comodo Free Firewall (www.personalfirewall.comodo.com) is 
another option and it is — you guessed it — free.
✓
✓Installing all‐in‐one security: If you’re running Windows 10, 8, 7, or 
Vista with an antivirus program, you’re in pretty good shape against the 
bad guys. Just make sure that that your copy of Windows is up to date 
by selecting the Start button, typing Windows Update in the search 
box in the window that appears, and following the on‐screen prompts 
(it’s Check for updates in Windows 10). Windows 10 is designed to 
update itself anyway — eliminating this step. But if you’d prefer, some 

61

 Chapter 2: Getting Your Device Ready for Online Investing
software programs provide three different levels of security (antivirus/
antispyware/firewall). Symantec has Norton 360 (http://us.norton.
com/360), and McAfee offers McAfee Total Protection (www.mcafee.
com), but neither is free and for most common home users they don’t 
offer enough extra protection to warrant their costs.
Mastering the Basics with Online 
Tutorials and Simulations
Online investing is like Vegas in that you get no do‐overs. If you invest all 
your money in a speculative company that goes belly up, you lose your 
money. Period. Don’t expect the government to bail you out, like it bailed 
out several large banks during the financial crisis of 2008, and don’t think 
that you can sue the company to get your money back. It’s most likely gone. 
That’s why if you’re new to investing, you might want to try the tutorials and 
simulations I discuss in the following sections before using real money.
Online tutorials
Before you jump into any risky activity, it’s worthwhile to take a deep breath, 
relax, and make absolutely sure that you understand how the process works. 
Several excellent online tutorials can step you through the process ahead of 
time to make sure that you know what to expect. If you’re just starting out, 
it’s not a bad idea to run through one of the following:
✓
✓Investing Online Resource Center (www.investingonline.org): 
Here’s a site that all online investors should check out. Beginning inves-
tors should read through the materials and then read the Eight Things 
Every Investor Should Know section in the Online Investing tab. Don’t 
miss the site’s IORC Simulator Center, which lets you see what it’s like to 
invest online.
✓
✓Investing 101 at Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/university/ 
beginner): A great primer of what you can expect, it’s worth running 
through to make sure that you have all the basics down. Figure 2‐7 shows 
you what an Investopedia page looks like.
✓
✓The Investor’s Clearinghouse (www.investoreducation.org): Here 
you find links to online resources on all sorts of investing topics, ranging 
from ways to research investments to finding investing help. An affiliated 
site, Help For Investors.org (www.helpforinvestors.org), provides 
even more tips.

62

✓
✓American Association of Individual Investors (www.aaii.com): This 
site provides some free resources to investors, including a virtual 
Investor Classroom that teaches the basics (www.aaii.com/ 
computerized‐investing/article/aaiis‐investor‐ 
classroom).
Be careful about which online tutorials you read and pay attention to. Many 
so‐called tutorials are thinly guised pitches for investment professionals 
trying to get you to hire them. Some also promote specialized trading tech-
niques with the purpose of getting you to buy books, videotapes, and other 
materials.

What would Buffett do?
An interesting feature about the AAII’s site is 
that investors can find portfolios that mirror 
famous investors’ strategies and see how they 
turn out. One portfolio is designed to be similar 
to that of famed investor Warren Buffett using 
reports of his holdings. You can also find port­

famous money managers’ strategies. This part

Simulations
Online games, or simulations, let you buy and sell real stocks using only 
funny money. Online simulations are a good idea for investors because they 
let you get a taste for investing before you commit to a strategy.
A few simulators you can try out include
✓
✓Icarra (www.icarra.com) is a powerful portfolio tracking software 
program that’s so addictive, you might keep playing even after you 
set up an online trading account and invest for real. After download-
ing the software, you enter buys and sells. Icarra carefully tracks the 
performance of your stocks and tells you how you’re doing. Even more 
interesting, though, is that you can view other members’ portfolios and 
share your own.
✓
✓TradeStation Simulator (www.tradestation.com/trading‐
technology/tradestation‐platform/execute/simulator): 
TradeStation, an online brokerage I tell you more about in Chapter 4, lets 
you practice trading online with a pretend account. You’ll need to sign 
up for an account, which is free, but you don’t need to put in any real 
money to use the simulator. Figure 2‐8 shows the simulator home page 
of the TradeStation site.

O
 
nline investors tend to be do‐it‐yourself types, so it’s unlikely that 
they’ll have tax consultants on retainer just waiting to handle any tax 
issues they might have. No, many online investors are big on going it alone, 
which can be rewarding as long as such investors become tax savvy, espe­
cially when it comes to how taxes on the different accounts vary.
In this chapter, I explain how investments are taxed and discuss ways in 
which picking the right kind of account can cut your tax bill. You’ll want to 
understand the differences between the three main types of accounts — 
taxable, retirement, and education savings — before you sign up with an 
online broker. I also show how online tools can help you track and reduce 
your taxes. Finally, I step you through the different types of tax‐advantaged 
accounts that can help you reach long‐term goals, such as saving for your 
child’s college education or for your retirement.
Knowing How Different 
Accounts Are Taxed
Brokerage accounts might all seem the same; after all, they’re just holding 
tanks for investments. Different types of brokerage accounts, though, look 

66
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
very different to the government. Thanks to the unbelievable complexity of 
the tax code, you can use three main types of accounts to hold your invest­
ments: taxable, retirement, and education savings accounts.
Taxable accounts
Taxable accounts are the standard accounts that come to mind when you 
think about investing online. Taxable accounts are very liquid, meaning that 
you can easily access the money without paying special penalties. But that 
flexibility comes at a cost: taxes. When stocks you own in taxable accounts 
go up, or appreciate, and you sell them, you owe capital gains taxes on your 
profit for that tax year. (Capital gains are gains you’ve made on the capital — 
cash — you’ve invested. Pretty simple, huh?) And if the stocks issue you cash 
payments, or dividends, you owe tax on those, too. I discuss how capital gains 
and dividends are taxed in the section “Plain Vanilla: The Taxable Brokerage 
Account,” later in this chapter.
Retirement accounts
Retirement is one of the largest and most intimidating things you 
must save for.
The bright side is that special retirement accounts make saving easier. It’s a 
good thing, because company pensions are vanishing. That leaves retirement 
planning up to you. I explain the different types of retirement plans available 
to most people — and which ones could make the most sense for you — later 
in this chapter. The key retirement accounts to be aware of are
✓
✓401(k)s are typically retirement plans sponsored by a company. 
Oftentimes, the company matches the employee’s contributions. 401(k) 
plans allow you to delay when you must pay taxes on your contributions 
and investment gains.
✓
✓Traditional individual retirement accounts or arrangements (IRAs) 
are available to people under the age of 70½ who earn as much money 
as they wish to contribute to an IRA and want to delay when taxes 
are due on retirement savings. Your contributions might also be tax 
deductible if you’re not covered by a company retirement plan or don’t 
exceed income limits. You can look up the current limits on the Internal 
Revenue Service’s website by cutting and pasting the following link into 
your browser of choice: www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch01.
html#en_US_2014_publink1000230381.

67

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
✓
✓Roth IRAs are retirement savings accounts that let you put in money 
that’s already been taxed so that it can grow and never be taxed again.
✓
✓Other popular retirement plans include simplified employee pension 
(SEP) accounts, 403(b) plans for employees of tax‐exempt entities, and 
Keogh plans, and each have different advantages and disadvantages. I 
cover IRA‐like SEPs in more detail later in this chapter.
Check out the section “Retirement Accounts: Knowing Your 401(k)s from 
Your IRAs,” later in this chapter, for more on your retirement plan options.
Education savings accounts
The cost of a college education keeps soaring. For the 2015 school year, the 
latest data available at press time, the tuition and fees for a four‐year public 
college degree cost $39,400, on average, and private college costs were 
$134,600, according to Savingforcollege.com (www.savingforcollege.
com/tutorial101/the_real_cost_of_higher_education.php), citing 
data from The College Board. And it gets worse: Tuition prices go up faster 
each year, 5 percent on average, than prices on almost anything else you’d 
buy, including stamps, eggs, and milk. If you factor in the 5 percent annual 
rate at which tuition fees are increasing, in 18 years, the tab for a public col­
lege will hit $94,800, and it’ll reach $323,900 for a private one. Online inves­
tors can get help from two types of education savings accounts:
✓
✓529 plans are very financially attractive state‐sponsored education sav­
ings accounts. They can be used to shield money earmarked for college 
or to prepay college tuition fees to lock in today’s price.
✓
✓Coverdell Education Savings Accounts are more restrictive than some 
education savings accounts, but they have the huge benefit that the 
money can be used to pay for elementary and secondary school as well.
I explain the different types of education savings accounts and discuss 
how you can use online resources to maximize your tax savings in the 
section “Going Back to School with Education Savings Accounts,” later in 
this chapter.
Plain Vanilla: The Taxable  
Brokerage Account
If you want to talk intelligently about tax‐advantaged accounts — accounts 
that are sheltered in some way for some period or other from the Internal 

68
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Revenue Service — you would be well‐served if you boned up on how regular 
taxable accounts are handled. It’s hard to see why retirement accounts are 
such a boon for investors if you have no idea to what extent investments are 
usually taxed by Uncle Sam.
I give you online tools to help you crunch the numbers, but first, it’s impor­
tant to understand the basics of how the taxes work. Commit these basics to 
memory so that you can think about any tax consequences before you place 
a trade in a taxable account. Keep in mind that these are just the basics, and 
the rules can change slightly for people in different situations. If taxes are 
your primary concern with investing, consult with books on the topic or with 
a tax professional.
You have a taxable event in a taxable brokerage account when one of two 
things occurs:
✓
✓Capital appreciation: Imagine that you hit a veritable investing home 
run by buying a share of stock for $10 that soars to $100. When you 
sell the stock, that $90 per share gain is called capital appreciation or a 
realized capital gain. If you hold onto the stock and don’t sell it, it’s con­
sidered an unrealized capital gain. And with an unrealized capital gain, 
because you haven’t actually cashed in the stock, you haven’t profited 
in the eyes of the government and don’t owe taxes. But the second you 
sell, everything changes. Your gain turns into a taxable one subject to 
rules I discuss shortly.
✓
✓Dividends: You probably remember dividends from the Chance card in 
the Monopoly board game. Dividends are cash payments made by com­
panies when they’re making so much money they don’t know what to do 
with it. The only thing they can think of is returning it to the sharehold­
ers. That way, shareholders can reinvest the cash rather than letting it 
pile up in the company’s bank account.
I show you how to find out how much cash a company has on hand in 
Chapter 12, and in Chapter 13, I show you how to find stocks that pay fat 
dividends.
Capital appreciation is a fine thing to write about, and I do get to it eventually —  
right after the next section, to be precise — but dividends have that Somebody‐
Is‐Sending‐Me‐Money‐without‐My‐Really‐Understanding‐Why appeal, so I’m 
going to dive right in and talk about them first.
The importance of dividends
Dividends usually won’t make you rich overnight, but don’t think they’re just 
for widows and orphans. Dividends accounted for more than a third of the 

69

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s roughly 10 percent total return in its more than 
50 years of existence. Total return measures your percentage gain on a stock 
resulting from both stock‐price gains and dividends.
If you’re not getting dividends, you could be missing out. Table 3‐1 shows 
what stocks in the S&P 500 have returned each year since 2000 and the per­
centage that came from dividends. You’ll notice that dividends helped make 
up for losses in years when stocks declined in value. For instance, during 
the market bloodbath in 2008 when stocks lost 38.5 percent of their value, 
dividends were your only bright spot, albeit a relatively small one. And 
sometimes dividends are the only bright spot. In 2011, for instance, the stock 
market did nothing. But investors earned a 2.1 percent total return, thanks 
entirely to the dividends.
Dividends are paid based on how many shares you own. If a company 
declares a $1 per share dividend and you own 100 shares, you will receive 
$100. To help compare the sizes of dividends, investors generally talk about 
the dividend yield. A dividend yield tells you how much return you’re getting 
in the form of a dividend — in other words, how big the dividend is relative 
to what you’ve invested.

You can calculate a stock’s dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend by 
the stock’s price. But you can also get it from almost every financial website 
explained in Chapter 2. Reuters, for example, has an extensive database of 
dividend information. To get a company’s dividend yield using the Reuters 
website, follow these steps:
1.	Go to the Reuters stocks main page at www.reuters.com/finance/
stocks.
2.	Enter a ticker symbol in the Search Reuters field in the upper‐right 
corner of the screen and click the Search button (a magnifying glass 
icon).
Click the name of the company when it pops up.
3.	Select the Financials tab at the top of the screen.
In the new page that appears, scroll down to the dividends section. In 
the Dividends table, shown in Figure 3‐1 (using General Electric as an 
example), you can see what a company’s dividend yield is now and what 
it was on average over the past five years. You can also see what kind of 
dividend yields other companies in the industry pay.


 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
Table 3‐2 shows what kinds of dividends are typical in various industries.
Some online brokers and companies that sell their shares to investors directly 
allow you to use dividends paid by a stock to buy more shares of the stock. 
These programs are called dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). If you’re 
interested in these plans, keep them in mind when evaluating brokers, as I 
describe in Chapter 4.
How capital gains are taxed
When you sell a stock held in a taxable account that has appreciated in value, 
you usually have taxes to pay. Generally, such capital gains taxes, as they 
are referred to, are calculated based on how long you owned the stock — a 
period of time known as the holding period. There are two holding periods:
✓
✓Short‐term: That’s the type of capital gain you have if you sell a stock 
after owning it for one year or less. You want to avoid these gains if you 
can because you’re taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, which as I 
explain shortly, is one of the highest tax percentages.
✓
✓Long‐term: That’s the type of capital gain result you get if you sell a 
stock after holding it for more than one year. These gains qualify for a 
special discount on taxes, as I describe a little later.
You must own a stock for more than one year for it to be considered a long‐
term capital gain. If you buy a stock on March 5, 2015, and sell it on March 5, 
2016, for a profit, that is considered a short‐term capital gain. Also, an impor­
tant thing to remember is that the holding period clock starts the day after 
you buy the stock and stops the day you sell it. Selling even one day too soon 
can be a costly mistake.

The high tax price of being short‐term
If you’re interested in cutting your tax bill in a taxable account, you want 
to reduce, as much as possible, the number of stocks you sell that you’ve 
owned for only a year or less because they’re taxed at your ordinary 
income tax levels. You can look up your ordinary income tax bracket at this 
Internal Revenue Service website: www.irs.gov/pub/irs‐pdf/i1040tt.
pdf?portlet=3. At press time, the IRS provided 2011 tax brackets. But just 
to give you an idea, Bankrate provides the tax brackets for 2015 as shown in 
Table 3‐3.
Need an example? Remember the stock I mention earlier that went from 
$10 to $100 a share (for a $90 per share gain)? Say that the investor had 
$50,000 in taxable income that year and sold the stock after owning it for just 
three months. The investor’s gain would fall from $90 to $67.50 after paying 
$22.50 in taxes.
How long‐term capital gains are taxed
By owning stocks for more than a year, gains are taxed at what’s known as 
the maximum capital gain rate. The rate you pay on long‐term capital gains 
varies based on your normal tax bracket, but such rates are almost always 
much lower than your ordinary income tax rate, if not zero. Yes, that’s right, 
between the 2009 and 2015 tax years at least, some investors’ long‐term

capital gains were tax free. Long‐term capital gains rates, though, can change 
dramatically due to political pressure. Table 3‐4 shows the maximum capital 
gain rates for 2015 for typical investments such as stocks and bonds.
I’m trying to save you time (and money!) by providing you with all the IRS 
tax brackets. But you can look them up yourself online at www.irs.gov/
Forms‐&‐Pubs. And no, that 0 percent tax rate is not a typo. Keep reading 
and you’ll find out more about how some capital gains, for now, are escap­
ing taxation.
When you can win from your losses
If you’re like most investors, you beat yourself up anytime you sell a stock 
for a loss. Nobody likes to lose money when the whole point of investing is 
to make it. But if there’s a plus to suffering a loss, it comes at tax time. The 
IRS allows you to use capital losses to offset your capital gains and possibly 
your regular income. If your losses exceed your gains, you have a net capital 
loss to report on Schedule D, which can even cut your taxable income each 
year. This IRS rule presents several tax strategies that can cut your tax bill. 
The guidelines, when it comes to using losses to cut your capital gains taxes, 
include the following:
✓
✓Use losses to avoid short‐term gains. Make it your goal to never have 
a short‐term capital gain. If you sell a winning stock you’ve owned for a 
year or less, go through your portfolio, find a loser and sell it. (You can 
even use losses from stocks you’ve owned for more than a year to offset 
short‐term capital gains.) If your long‐term loss is greater than your 
short‐term gain, the gain vanishes, and you have a net long‐term loss 
instead. You can deduct up to $3,000 ($1,500 if you’re married and file 
separately) from your regular taxable income. Not a bad deal.
For example, imagine that you scored a $1,000 profit from a high‐flying 
stock you owned for a month. Normally, if you’re in the 28 percent tax 
bracket, you’d have to pay $280 in taxes because it’s a short‐term gain.

But you can pay no tax if you sell a stock at a loss of $1,000 by the end of 
the tax year. You get the entire $1,000 from the first sale, and you offload 
a bummer of a stock at the same time. Win‐win!
✓
✓Dump your losers. If you have losing stocks in your portfolio that you’ve 
lost hope in, sell them so that you at least get a tax break. Tax rules allow  
you to deduct up to $3,000 a year in capital losses from your regular 
income. It’s a decent way to get out of a stock you’re tired of and cut 
your tax bill.
✓
✓Don’t forget tax‐loss carryovers. What if your net loss is greater than 
the annual limit of $3,000? Do you lose the deduction? Not at all; you 
just have to spread it out. You can carry over capital losses to your 
future tax returns until you use up the losses. The IRS (www.irs.gov/
taxtopics/tc409.html) provides more information about how to 
carry over capital losses.
Don’t think you can sell a stock you’re losing money on, take the loss for tax 
purposes, and just buy it back. The IRS’s “wash sale” rule prohibits this. If 
you sell a stock or mutual fund for a loss, you’re not allowed to deduct the 
loss if you bought back that investment or one that’s “substantially identical” 
within 30 days before or 30 days after the sale. To avoid triggering the wash 
sale rule, you must wait 31 days after the sale to buy the investment back. 
Here are two sites that can help you understand the complexities of the wash 
sale rules:
✓
✓Fairmark (www.fairmark.com/capgain/wash) provides a detailed 
description of wash sale rules and describes ways to avoid getting 
tripped up by this tax trap. (See Figure 3‐2.)
✓
✓The Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/answers/
wash.htm) also provides guidance on wash sales.
What to do with your worthless stock
Selling your losers is usually pretty straightforward: You swallow your pride, sell 
the stock, and take your tax loss. But sometimes it’s not that easy. Periodically, 
companies crash so badly that their stocks are delisted from the exchange, 
such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, where they traded when 
you bought them. This happened to both General Motors, before it sold stock 
to the public again as an initial public offering in 2010, and fallen electronics 
seller Radio Shack in 2015. They become what’s called a worthless security.
You can still deduct the loss on a stock even if the shares aren’t available for 
trading anymore. But the IRS is pretty clear about what you need to do. In 
most cases, even when a stock is delisted, it still trades on informal ­markets 

75

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
such as the Pink Sheets. It’s best to sell the stock there so that you can rec­
ognize the loss and have a paper trail. It’s often best to sell this way, even 
though some online brokers charge slightly higher commissions because 
proving something is worthless without being able to sell it can be difficult. 
If you can’t sell the stock, you must prove it’s worth less than a penny per 
share. Additional rules say that you can deduct your loss from a worthless­ 
stock only in the year it became worthless. If you didn’t realize a stock wasn’t 
worth anything until the year after it lost its value, you have to file an amended 
tax return for the year the stock became worthless.

Pay no capital‐gains taxes?
It almost seems too good to be true. Could it be 
the government cut the capital gains tax to 0 
percent? The answer is yes and no. Congress 
in early 2008 approved a bill that cut long‐term 
capital gains taxes for many taxpayers. The 
long‐term capital gains rate for some investors 
fell to nothing from 5 percent. The lower rate 
affects only long‐term capital gains because 
short‐term gains are taxed at your ordinary 
income rate.
Before you start writing a thank‐you letter to 
the IRS, though, you should know that there 
are some heavy restrictions. The 0 percent 
long‐term tax rate applies only to people in the 
bottom two tax brackets, which means that 
in 2015 you’d have to have less than $37,451 
in taxable income as a single person or less 
than $74,900 for a married couple filing jointly 
to qualify.

Using technology to measure  
your capital gain
Taxes can have a dramatic effect on your online investing success, so you 
need to be aware of the rules. Most online brokerages won’t stop you from 
placing a trade that could hurt you when tax time rolls around. It’s up to you 
to manage your tax picture. And it’s also up to you to track your capital gains.
You might think “Easier said than done,” but keeping track of your capital 
gains isn’t that complicated. Essentially, if you know the following about all 
your investment transactions, you have what you need to keep tabs on your 
capital gains:
✓
✓The date you bought the investment.
✓
✓The amount you paid to buy it, which is known as your cost basis. 
You can calculate this by multiplying the stock price you paid times the 
number of shares you bought and then adding the commission you paid 
for the stock trade. All that added together is your cost basis.
For example, say you bought 100 shares of ABC Company for $50 and 
paid a $5 commission. Your basis is $5,005. You get that by multiplying 
the cost of the stock by the number of shares ($50 times 100 shares) and 
then adding the $5 commission.
✓
✓The date you sold the investment.
✓
✓The amount you received for selling it, or your proceeds. You can cal­
culate this by multiplying the stock price you sold at by the number of 
shares you sold, minus the commission you had to pay.
Imagine now that you sold your 100 shares of ABC Company for $100 
apiece and paid a $5 commission. The amount of your proceeds 
is $9,995. You get that by multiplying the price of the stock by the 
number of shares ($100 times 100 shares) and then subtracting the $5 
commission.
At tax time, you must then report all your capital gains on Schedule D. For 
more help on this, check out what the IRS says about sales and trades of 
investments at www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e9488.
Because you’re an online investor, you’re probably loath to actually use a 
pencil and paper to keep track of all this information. Luckily, you have sev­
eral alternatives:
✓
✓Personal finance software: Intuit’s Quicken (discussed at more length 
in Chapter 1) keeps track of everything you need to file Schedule D. It 
can also transfer all the data the government requires directly into tax‐
preparation software, such as H&R Block’s TaxCut or Intuit’s TurboTax. 
Quicken can also print out a capital gains worksheet that you can give to 
your tax preparer.

77

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
✓
✓Portfolio‐tracking sites: Several of the web‐based portfolio‐monitoring 
sites discussed in Chapter 8 can help you track everything you need to 
calculate your taxes.
✓
✓Online brokers’ websites: Such sites often track when you bought 
investments, how much you paid, and when you sold them. Nearly all 
online brokerages have a place on their websites where you can see 
your realized and unrealized gains. And at the end of the year, online 
brokerages provide a document that shows all your trades and your 
bases in many cases. Here’s why I say in many cases: If you bought a 
stock in 2011 or later, it’s your brokerage’s responsibility to track your 
cost‐basis information and report it to you at tax time. This is a big 
change for investors and it eliminates the hassle of tracking cost basis 
for any recently purchased stock. But the change also means your rela­
tionship with your brokerage is even more important, so you’ll want to 
make sure you read Chapter 4, which helps you choose the best broker­
age for you.
✓
✓Online capital gains calculators and sites let you enter your stock buys 
and sells and help calculate your net capital gains or losses and carry­
overs. One example of an online capital gains calculator is the one at 
MoneyChimp at www.moneychimp.com/features/capgain.htm.
✓
✓Specialized online sites dedicated to optimizing your tax strategy 
might make sense if you have a particularly complicated situation. For 
instance, GainsKeeper (www.gainskeeper.com) is a professional‐level 
online service that helps you track your trades, tally your cost basis in 
stocks, and find ways to reduce your taxes. (Figure 3‐3 shows the Gains­
Keeper site.) If you’re an extremely active trader, the tax rules and keep­
ing track of everything can get complicated, so software like this can 
be helpful. The system isn’t free; it’ll cost you at least $70 a year. Before 
signing up, though, check with your broker — some offer discounted 
subscriptions. Or some brokers, including TD Ameritrade, offer free 
access to GainsKeeper.
Measuring your capital gains  
if you’ve lost your records
I know you meticulously track all your investments and trading records. But 
in the off case that you just can’t find how much you paid for a stock bought 
prior to 2011, you can still figure out your basis by using the Internet, as 
long as you know when you bought it and that it’s still actively trading. 2011 
is the key year — it is your responsibility to track your basis for stocks you 
bought before that year. You can use the historical charting, as I describe in 
Chapter 2, to look back in time and see where the stock was trading the day 
you bought it.

Here’s how:
1.	Log on to Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com).
2.	Enter the ticker symbol of the stock you’re interested in and click the 
name of the company when it appears.
The page devoted to the stock you’ve chosen appears on‐screen.
3.	Click the Historical Prices option on the left margin.
4.	Enter the date you bought the stock in the Start Date field and the 
date you sold it in the End Date field, then click the Get Prices button.
You’ll see the price the stock traded at the day you bought it, under the 
Adjusted Close heading. Multiply that price by the number of shares you 
bought and add the commission you paid, and you have your cost basis.
The page also shows you the price of the stock for the day you sold it (as 
shown in Figure 3‐4). Multiply that price by the number of shares you sold 
and subtract the commission you paid, and you have your proceeds.
5.	Use the information and follow the previous instructions on how to

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
If the company you invested in underwent some major changes before you 
sold the stock, the previous method of calculating the cost basis does not 
work. For instance, the stock may no longer be trading, so no trading history 
will be available. You might also have obtained the stock indirectly and not 
actually bought it if the shares were distributed by a larger company as part 
of a restructuring.
In these cases, you’ll need a little more heavy‐duty technique. You could 
try to figure out the cost basis by digging through financial records most 
likely available at your library. If that sounds like too much work, an easier 
option is to use Intuit’s TurboTax Premier software. Using technology from 
GainsKeeper, TurboTax Premier can do some major historical research 
online, even if the stock no longer trades or if the company underwent some 
major restructuring. The software isn’t cheap — it’ll set you back about $100 
if you download the software to your computer — but it can also prepare all 
your tax forms for you.
For decades, it’s been up to you, the investor, to keep track of your capital 
gains and losses. Some online brokers would, as a courtesy, keep track of 
your cost basis on any mutual funds or stocks you bought while you were 
their client. You couldn’t always count on this service, though, because 
if you switched your account to another broker, poof, all your cost basis 
information was gone. All this changed, though, starting in 2011. From 2011 
on, brokers are required to keep track of the cost basis of any stocks you 
buy and provide necessary documentation to you at tax time. Brokers are 
also required to forward your cost basis information to your new broker if

you move your account. The rules were put in place to help the government 
crackdown on investors who didn’t report all their gains, and no, we’re not 
pointing any fingers here. But if there’s a benefit, it’s that the headache of 
cost basis is now your broker’s headache. Even so, it’s not a bad idea to 
know how to track your cost basis for tax planning during the year and also 
to make sure that your broker doesn’t make a mistake.
How dividends are taxed
Thanks to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, dividends 
caught a big‐time tax that were later extended by the American Taxpayers 
Relief Act of 2012. Dividends that meet certain criteria are considered quali-
fied and are taxed at the same favorable rate as long‐term capital gains, as 
discussed in the preceding section. That was a huge break, because prior to 
that, dividends were taxed at the typically much higher short‐term capital 
gains rate. But, to get the lower tax treatment, dividends must be:
✓
✓Qualified: Dividends from most companies that trade on U.S. exchanges 
are qualified. There are important exceptions, though, including some div­
idends paid by real‐estate investment trusts, or REITs, which typically own 
commercial real estate such as apartment buildings and strip malls. Also 
keep in mind that dividends paid by money market accounts and many 
bond funds don’t qualify either because they’re considered interest.
The Fairmark.com website (www.fairmark.com/mutual/ordinary.
htm) has a set of tools that can help you decide what kinds of dividends 
you have and how they’re taxed.
✓
✓Paid to a shareholder who holds the stock for the right amount of 
time: To qualify for the lower rates, you must own the stock for a long 
enough time. The IRS says you must own the stock for more than 60 days 
during the 121‐day period starting 60 days before the stock’s ex‐dividend 
date. The ex‐dividend date is the day a new investor who bought the 
stock is no longer entitled to dividends declared by the company. For 
more information on this, Fidelity.com (http://personal.fidelity.
com/planning/tax/distributions/qdi.shtml.cvsr) has a 
section that explains qualified dividends. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (www.sec.gov/answers/dividen.htm) explains the ex‐
dividend date.
The big tax break that dividends have enjoyed since 2002 may not last for­
ever. Some high earners have already lost it. A new 20 percent dividend tax 
rate was created for those of you lucky enough to be in the top tax bracket of 
39.6 percent. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also ushered in 
a new 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax that applies to dividends and 
capital gains for married taxpayers earning more than $250,000 and single 
taxpayers hauling more than $200,000. It’s just a reminder that taxes aren’t 
always low forever.

81

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
Investors who buy investments and hold them for a long time get a huge 
tax advantage over short‐term traders. By holding stocks, you can put off 
the time when you have to pay tax on your gains. That allows your entire, 
untaxed ball of cash to snowball tax deferred. But even long‐term investors 
have to pay taxes on dividends each year.
Retirement Accounts: Knowing Your 
401(k)s from Your IRAs
If you made your way through the preceding section, you have a pretty good 
sense of just how complicated taxes can get when dealing with regular tax­
able brokerage accounts. The tax burden creates bookkeeping work for you 
when you buy or sell a stock (bad enough) and it also eats into your profit 
(even worse). Being forced to pay taxes frequently means that the amount of 
capital you can invest gets whittled away, hurting your ultimate performance. 
That’s the beauty of retirement accounts. Just remember that the downside 
to retirement accounts is that you might get socked with penalties if you take 
money out before you retire.
Until death do you part: Ownership 
of taxable accounts
When you set up an online brokerage account, 
you’ll be asked whose name it should be put 
in. This seemingly mundane question can have 
serious tax consequences. Sorry to be morbid 
here, but death is the event that makes the way 
you possess an account very important. The 
following are the main types of accounts and 
describes how each affects your tax situation 
in the event of your (timely or untimely) demise:
✓
✓Individual accounts are the common stan-
dard account. You are named the owner, 
and on your death, the assets go to your 
estate.
✓
✓Joint tenants with rights of survivorship 
accounts give each owner an entire stake. 
That means if one owner dies, the assets 
transfer directly to the other owners.
✓
✓Tenants in common accounts let you slice 
up an account, by percentage, among dif-
ferent owners. When you die, your percent-
age of ownership passes to your estate.
✓
✓Community property accounts are a method 
of ownership available only in states that 
allow them. This allows a married couple to 
equally own assets. The Internal Revenue 
Service recognizes nine community prop-
erty states: Arizona, California, Idaho, 
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, 
Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaska resi-
dents can choose to have community prop-
erty treatment, but it requires taxpayers to 
take an election, as you can read in sec-
tion  25.18.1.1.2 (www.irs.gov/irm/
part25/irm_25‐018‐001.html).

In this section, I describe the main types of retirement accounts. The tax 
rules are complex and not exactly as fascinating as the latest Suzanne Collins 
novel. If you just want the bottom line, many financial advisors recommend 
doing the following:
1.	Open a 401(k) account if your employer matches your contributions.
Put in at least enough money to get the match.
2.	If you have money left over and qualify, open a Roth IRA.
Most online brokers, as I discuss in Chapter 4, can open a Roth IRA 
for you.
If you’d rather use online tools to help you decide what to do, check out the 
following sites:
✓
✓Morningstar (http://screen.morningstar.com/ira/

requires you to register with a username and password first.

✓Kiplinger.com (www.kiplinger.com/retirement) has a retirement 
center where you can determine what accounts are best for you. If 
you’re confused, some online brokers have financial advisors who can

on retirement savings with several helpful tools.
✓
✓FIRECalc (www.firecalc.com) uses an advanced computerized model 
to help you determine how much you must save to retire. It bases its 
forecasts on historical data.
The biggest downside to 401(k)s and most IRA accounts is that you get hit 
with a steep 10 percent penalty for taking money out before you turn 59½, 
unless you qualify for some exceptions. And you must start taking money out 
of a traditional IRA (not a Roth IRA) when you turn 70½ years old.

It’s important that you understand all the catches, so I recommend doing a

plete descriptions of the different types of retirement plans:

✓Vanguard (https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/iras) contains 
an easy‐to‐follow chart that explains the advantages and disadvantages 
of traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.
✓
✓Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) 
describes 401(k) plans in addition to a new type of 401(k) called the 
Roth 401(k).
When you use an account that lets you deduct contributions following the 
Don’t Pay Tax Now/Pay It Later principle — any 401(k) plan, for example — 
you have to pay the ordinary income tax rate when you withdraw cash. Don’t 
let this discourage you, though, because retirement accounts still provide tax 
savings to most investors.
401(k)s: A great place to get started
If your employer offers a 401(k) plan or the equivalent for public‐service 
employees called the 403(b), don’t pass it up. Thanks to the advantages that 
retirement accounts offer to employees and employers, the 401(k) has been 
extremely popular.

If your company offers a 401(k) and makes matching contributions, that’s the 
first account you should open. Passing up on a company match is like turn­
ing away free money. Just be sure that this is money you’re not going to need 
until you retire.
Most 401(k) plans let you contribute up to $18,000 for 2015. If you’re 50 years 
old or older, you can kick in an extra $6,000 as a catch‐up contribution. The 
IRS (www.irs.gov/pub/irs‐tege/cola_table.pdf) also provides a 
table that shows the current 401(k) contribution limits and what they have 
been in the past.
Managing your 401(k) plan online
Just because your 401(k) is tucked away and invested for your retirement 
doesn’t mean that you can’t manage it online. You have several ways to tune 
and tweak your 401(k), including
✓
✓The plan administrators’ site: Most 401(k) plans are easily accessible 
on a website. From there, you can set all the variables that matter most. 
You can instruct your company to withhold a set amount of money from 
your pay, decide which mutual funds you want to invest in, and shift 
money among mutual funds. You’ll need to contact your company’s 
human resources department to find out how to access the account.
✓
✓401(k) education sites: Sites such as 5 Ways for a Secure Retirement 
(www.5waysin5days.com) help you take a more active role in making 
sure that you’ll have enough dough for your golden years. If you click on 
the links to the five steps, you can see if you’re on track.
✓
✓Regulators’ sites: These sites let you know your rights and the employ­
er’s obligations. Most retirement plans are overseen by the Department 
of Labor, which maintains extensive resources at www.dol.gov/dol/
topic/retirement/typesofplans.htm.
✓
✓BrightScope (www.brightscope.com): Not all 401(k) plans are equal —  
and there’s a way to see how yours compares. Your plan might be charg­
ing lofty fees or offering lousy investment choices. This site helps you 
find out how your 401(k) plan stacks up against those at other compa­
nies. Choose the Research a 401k Plan option from the drop‐down menu 
on the front page. Enter the name of the company offering the 401(k) 
plan and click it. The site shows you how your plan stacks up and how 
much longer you’ll have to work to save as much as a worker at a com­
pany with a better 401(k) plan. If the plan is really bad, talk to your com­
pany’s plan administrator and consider only contributing enough to get 
your company match.

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
Most employers require that you work for them for at least a year and that 
you be 21 or older before you can sign up for their 401(k) plans. But other 
than that, 401(k) plans vary among companies. Some 401(k) plans let you 
borrow money and pay interest to yourself. And in 2006, a few employers 
began offering Roth 401(k) plans, which combine the benefits of 401(k)s with 
Roth IRAs, which you can read about in the next section.
Getting in tune with IRAs
Practically everyone can fund an IRA if he or she has the money. But IRAs are 
especially attractive if you don’t have access to a 401(k) at work (perhaps 
because you’re self‐employed) or if the 401(k) at your company doesn’t offer 
a match. IRAs, like 401(k)s, offer big benefits when you’re saving for retire­
ment. The Investor’s Clearinghouse (www.investoreducation.org/IRAs) 
provides links to online resources to help you decide whether an IRA will 
work for you.
Several types of IRA(s) exist, but you should really concern yourself only 
with the big three:
✓
✓Traditional IRAs are available to anyone. They’re a great place to save 
money for retirement because you can put away as much as $5,500 in 
2015, and $1,000 more if you’re over at least 50 years old.
Capital gains and dividends in a traditional IRA aren’t taxed until you 
take out the money. And, you might be able to deduct your contributions 
if you’re not covered by a company‐sponsored retirement plan. If you or 
your spouse is covered by a company plan, the amount you can deduct 
is reduced based on how much you earn. The rules get complicated, but 
Fidelity has an excellent primer at www.fidelity.com/retirement/
calculators/retirement‐calculators that explains how much 
you may contribute. Click the IRA Contribution Calculator link.
Even if you can’t deduct your contribution, a traditional IRA might still 
make sense for you. A nondeductible IRA can be a great place to stash 
investments that generate nonqualified dividends and interest, such as 
REITs and bonds.
✓
✓SEP IRAs are designed for owners of small businesses, employees of 
small businesses, and people who work for themselves. They’re easy 
to set up and allow employers — including self‐employed people — to 
contribute up to 25 percent of compensation to a limit of $53,000 in 2015. 
Vanguard provides more information about these plans at https://
personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/smallbusiness/
sepira.

86

✓
✓Roth IRAs are one of the best things going, and if you can open one, you 
should. With Roth IRAs, you pay now and play later. You can’t deduct 
contributions when you make them, but you can take out the money in 
the future tax‐free if you’re at least 59½ years old and owned the account 
for five years or longer. And unlike traditional IRAs, you’re not required 
to take out the money at a certain age, allowing you to pass the giant, 
tax‐free nest egg to your kids. Just imagine the power of compounding 
on an investment sitting untaxed for more than a lifetime. It doesn’t get 
much better than that.
Roth IRAs are generally best if you think your tax rate will be higher in 
the future when you retire. It’s impossible to know what Congress will do 
with tax rates in the future. That’s why many financial advisors say it’s 
better to go with a Roth, lock in the rates now, and protect yourself from 
the risk of higher tax rates later. But if you’re certain you’ll be in a lower 
tax bracket in the future, a Roth may not be for you.
Setting up an IRA
After you’ve made your decision about what type of retirement account 
you’re interested in — be it a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA — you 
need to find a broker to set it up. Nearly all the online brokers are equipped 
to set up all these accounts. But before signing up, make sure that there are
✓
✓No extra fees or higher commissions: In fact, online brokers might cut 
you special deals on your IRA accounts. This is something to look for 
when evaluating online brokers, as I describe in Chapter 4.
✓
✓Plenty of low‐cost investments to choose from: Most brokerages let you 
invest in both individual stocks and mutual funds with IRA accounts.
Okay, so you’ve decided on a plan for saving for retirement and you’ve 
picked the type of accounts best suited for that plan. But how much do you 
need to save? Most of the preceding sites help you answer that question. The 
Choose to Save site (www.choosetosave.org/ballpark) takes a simpli­
fied approach by giving you a Ballpark Estimate of how much you’ll need. 
And Analyze Now! (www.analyzenow.com) provides a Free Programs sec­
tion stuffed with spreadsheets that can help you answer many of the ques­
tions you need to be asking yourself. In fact, the site even has an Investment 
Manager spreadsheet that can help you choose the right kind of accounts for 
planning your retirement. Index Funds Advisors’ Retirement Analyzer (www.
ifa.com/montecarlo/home) uses an advanced statistical analysis to exam­
ine the range of possible outcomes for your retirement savings. Using its sta­
tistical model, the IFA Retirement Analyzer tells you how much to contribute 
based on whether the market does well, poorly, or something in between.

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
Should you turn your traditional IRA into a Roth?
Do you have a traditional IRA and wish you had 
a Roth? Taxpayers can choose to turn their 
traditional IRAs into a Roth. The tax rules sur-
rounding such “conversions” are extremely 
complicated, so you’d better understand the 
ramifications before making the move. Several 
online resources can help, including
✓
✓General sources, such as RothIRA.com 
(www.rothira.com/roth‐ira‐
conversion‐rules), provide guide-
lines about where a conversion would 
make sense.
✓
✓Comparison websites help you know what 
you stand to gain or lose from the transfor-
mation. The rules surrounding Roth and tra-
ditional IRAs are complex. If you’re not sure 
about anything, check out Vanguard’s com-
parison site at https://personal.

Going Back to School with Education 
Savings Accounts
Several special types of education savings accounts provide lucrative tax 
breaks, giving you a fighting chance to keep up with rising college costs. You 
need any help you can get because tuition costs rise at about twice the rate 
of most consumer goods.
The two main types of education savings accounts are the 529 plan and the 
Coverdell. Both 529s and Coverdell accounts work much like the Roth IRA, 
discussed in the preceding section, in that you put after‐tax dollars into the 
accounts and watch them grow tax‐free. You can take out the money, without 
paying any tax, as long as you use the cash to pay for qualified education 
expenses. The Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov/publications/
p970/ch08.html) describes qualified education expenses as “tuition, fees, 
books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance” to an 
eligible school. “Reasonable” room and board costs are also included for stu­
dents who go to school at least half‐time.
Three numbers you need to know: 529
When saving for college, it’s tough to beat the 529. These are college savings 
plans typically run by states or educational institutions. The plans have sev­
eral extremely positive attributes, such as
✓
✓Tax savings: As the earlier example describes, the tax savings from 529 
plans make them worthwhile. The tax savings can be even sweeter in 
some states that let you deduct your contributions to the state plan 
from your income.
✓
✓Control: Even though your child is the beneficiary of the money, you 
remain the owner. That’s an important distinction because it means if 
Junior decides to run off and join the circus, he can’t get the 529 money.
529 plans don’t just have to be used for a kid. Open one for yourself 
if you’re thinking about going back to school. And don’t worry, your 
money won’t be wasted if your child gets a scholarship. You can change 
the beneficiary to anyone else you want or even use the money to pay 
for more schooling for yourself. The downside is that you have penalties 
to pay if you take the money out and don’t use it to pay for college.
✓
✓Availability and flexibility: Unlike most other tax‐advantaged accounts, 
which are mired with complex rules and restrictions, anyone can have 
a 529 account. There are limits to how much you can contribute, but 
they’re generous, allowing you to contribute up to $14,000 a year in 
2015 without triggering estate tax issues. You can also make a larger 

89

 Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Account Type for You
lump sum contribution every five years. For information on the limits, 
Investopedia has a helpful description (www.investopedia.com/
university/retirementplans/529plan/529plan2.asp) as does 
Dummies.com (www.dummies.com/how‐to/content/529‐college‐
savings‐plan‐contribution‐limits.html).
✓
✓Lots of options: Every state offers at least one 529 plan, and you can 
invest in any state’s plan even if your child won’t go to school in that 
state. So even if you invest in Utah’s 529 plan, you can still use the 
money if your child wants to go to the University of California, Los 
Angeles. Go Bruins!
✓
✓Something for everyone: Some states, but not all, offer two types of 
529 plans: prepaid and savings. With prepaid plans, you transfer the 
investment risk to the state by agreeing to pay the current price of a 
college education and essentially locking in the price. Not all states 
offer prepaid plans. With savings plans, you contribute any amount you 
want and try to grow it by choosing wise investments. If you save and 
invest wisely with a 529 savings plan, you could make enough to pay for 
your kid’s college tuition and maybe part of a grandkid’s, too. In fact, 
you can save for anyone’s college using a 529, even for someone not 
related by blood.
Getting up to speed on 529 plans online
Some of the great things about 529 plans are that they’re easy to sign up for, 
you can fund them without worrying about tax laws for the most part, and 
the investments are pretty much preselected. The biggest decision you must 
make is whether you’ll opt for a plan offered by your state or go for one in 
another state.
Always evaluate and consider your own state’s 529 plan before looking else­
where. If your state lets you deduct contributions to its 529 plan, this might 
be a compelling feature you won’t want to miss out on.
Here are the primary ways to research and find out about 529 plans:
✓
✓College savings information sites: Savingforcollege.com (www.
savingforcollege.com) is a supersite when it comes to all things 
about college savings. You can find tutorials galore that show you how 
to pick a plan, decide which state’s 529 plan is best for you, compare 
different 529 plans and fees, and even provide links to the plans so that 
you can sign up. Figure 3‐6 shows you some of the information you can 
dig out from Savingforcollege.com. College Savings Plans Network (www.
collegesavings.org) helps you sort through the various options for 
saving for college. FinAid.org (www.finaid.org/savings) primarily 
deals with financial aid, but it also has resources on savings plans.

✓
✓The states’ 529 plan sites: Each 529 plan runs its own website that 
gives you all the details about how much you can contribute, what 
your investment options are, what the fees are, and other things you 
need to know. The best way to find links to states’ plans is through 
the Savingforcollege.com site, although Table 3‐5 contains links to 
some plans.

✓
✓Broker or mutual fund’s sites: Some states’ 529 plans are administered 
by large brokerage or mutual fund companies. In those cases, you can find 
out more about the plans directly from the administration companies. 
Vanguard, for instance, handles Nevada’s Vanguard 529 College Savings 
Plan and Iowa’s College Savings Iowa 529 plan. You can find out about 
both plans, and 529 plans in general, at Vanguard (https://personal.
vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college). Fidelity operates plans 
for Arizona, Delaware, and Massachusetts as well as offers a national 
plan. You can read about those plans at http://personal.fidelity.
com/planning/college/content/fidelity_managed_529_ 
plans.shtml.cvsr?refhp=pr&ut=A17.
Understanding 529 fees
As great as 529 plans are, you need to be familiar with their fees and charges. 
When evaluating plans, you want to see how the fee structures will affect your 
contributions and account balance to determine which are the best. The fees 
you need to know about include
✓
✓Enrollment fees are up‐front fees that some 529 plans charge to set up 
your account. Most 529s don’t charge these, and you should try not to 
pay them if you can help it.
✓
✓Account maintenance fees are charged on an ongoing basis just to track 
and handle your account. These fees are a little more common than 
enrollment fees.
✓
✓Program maintenance fees are charged by almost all 529 plans to cover 
the costs of running the 529. These fees generally run between 0.1 per­
cent and 1.1 percent of assets.
✓
✓Fees charged by funds owned by the 529 plan are also common. Say 
you invest in the Utah 529 plan, which invests in Vanguard funds. Those 
Vanguard funds themselves have fees that you must pay. These fees tend 
to be less than 1 percent of assets.
FINRA (http://apps.finra.org/investor_Information/Smart/529/
Calc/529_Analyzer.asp) maintains a website that can help you weigh all 
the different fees and choose the best plan for you.
You might worry that your child might have trouble getting financial aid if 
you stuff a ton of money into a 529 plan. Don’t worry. It’s not a big concern 
because the formula used for financial aid doesn’t heavily factor in 529 plans. 
All that means, though, is that 529s do count a bit. If you want to keep the 529 
completely out of the formula, you can legally name your child’s grandpar­
ent as the owner of the account. That way, the 529 won’t count against your 
child’s financial aid application.

Living in the 529’s shadow: The Coverdell
529s get most of the attention, and for good reason: They’re a great tax shel­
ter for money needed to pay for education. But Coverdell accounts have one 
giant advantage over 529s: You can use money from a Coverdell to pay for 
kindergarten, primary school, and secondary school, in addition to college. 
529s can be used only for college costs. Even so, Coverdell accounts have 
several drawbacks, including
✓
✓Contributions are limited to $2,000 a year.
✓
✓If you earn too much income, you won’t be able to make the full 
contribution.
✓
✓Contributions aren’t allowed after the beneficiary turns 18 years old.
You can find out about Coverdell accounts, and whether they fit your needs 
better than a 529, at www.savingforcollege.com/intro_to_esas. You 
can also read about the tax ramifications of the account at a site maintained 
by the IRS (www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310.html).

n this chapter, I dive through the offers from all the major online broker-
ages to pinpoint which ones could fit your needs. Why can’t I save you the 
trouble and just tell you which broker is the best? It’s not that easy. Choosing 
“the best” brokerage is like choosing the most beautiful painting in an art 
museum. Everyone has an opinion based on what is most important to him 
or her. When choosing a broker, if you’re most interested in dirt‐cheap com-
missions and don’t care much for service, you have one set of brokers to 
pick from. If you’re looking for access to physical branches staffed with live 
people who can help you choose stocks or navigate the website, you have an 
entirely different set of candidates.
You might think you don’t need this chapter because you like a certain 
broker’s ads on TV or have a cousin who swears by his online broker. But 
don’t underestimate the benefits that will accrue for you if you thoroughly 
research your broker options. Face it: Your broker is the gatekeeper to your 
money, and picking the right one will partly determine how successful you 
are as an investor.
Finding the Best Broker for You
People are constantly looking for the “best” of everything. Photography buffs 
pour through online reviews and websites looking for the best camera, com-
muters seek the best car, and parents search for the best stroller. Similarly, 
investors are on a constant quest for the best online broker. But just as differ-
ent cameras, cars, and strollers fit different people’s needs, the same is true 

94
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
with brokerages. As I explain in the previous three chapters, investors have 
different goals, taste for risk, and resources. And that’s why one person’s 
broker can be perfect for him or her, but completely wrong for you.
Not thoroughly researching your broker is a mistake. Your online broker 
is the most important member of your investing team, handling everything 
from tracking your portfolio to helping you buy and sell investments. It’s a 
relationship you need to be happy with in order to be a happy online inves-
tor. Above all, you want to make sure that your broker will be there for you if 
you run into any problems or have questions. When online investors run into 
problems, 79 percent of them go to their online brokerage firm for help, says 
rating service J.D. Power.
Main factors to consider
Brokers differ from one another in nine main ways. If you’re aware of these 
nine things and understand what you’re looking for, you can quickly elimi-
nate brokers that don’t fit your needs. The factors to consider are as follows:
✓
✓Commissions: Perhaps the most important consideration for many 
investors when evaluating brokers is the price charged for executing 
trades, known as the commission. I discuss fees at length later in the 
chapter. There’s good news here. Commissions charged by online bro-
kers have been steadily falling since the 1990s, with most taking a dive 
even lower during the price war that erupted in early 2010. Also, most 
brokers now offer flat‐rate commissions, meaning that all people pay the 
same commission no matter how many times they buy and sell or how 
many shares they trade. Some brokers have even started offering free 
commissions on certain trades.
✓
✓Availability of advice: One way brokers separate themselves is whether 
or not they give you any help picking investments. On one end of the 
spectrum are the full‐service traditional brokers that are all about giving 
you personalized attention. Not only can they pick stocks for you, but 
they’ll also pour you coffee and serve you donuts when you visit them 
in their fancy offices. If you’re not interested in paying for such niceties, 
the self‐service brokers are happy to oblige. Self‐service brokers give you 
the tools you need, and then you’re pretty much on your own. A few bro-
kers fit somewhere between full service and self‐service.
✓
✓Access to an office: Some brokers exist only online. It’s up to you to 
have your own computer and Internet connection. But others have 
branch offices in certain cities and allow customers to stop in, do some 
trading, and sometimes take classes and fraternize with other inves-
tors. You may not think that having access to a branch office will be 
important to you; after all, you’re an online investor. Still, rating service 
J.D. Power found that 31 percent of online investors who have access to 
branch offices tend to be happier with their online brokers. Go figure.

95

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
✓
✓Other banking services: A brokerage account doesn’t have to be a finan-
cial island. Some brokerage firms let you move money from your trading 
account into other types of accounts, such as checking accounts. Some 
also provide ATM cards or credit cards.
✓
✓Speed of execution: When you click the Buy or Sell button on the web-
site, it doesn’t mean that the trade is done. Your order snakes its way 
from your computer to other traders on Wall Street, where it is filled. 
Some brokerages have spent a great deal of effort giving you the fastest 
path to other traders. That’s generally beneficial because it means that 
you get a price that reflects the true value of the stock you’re buying 
or selling. Depending on your strategy, you might not want your orders 
piling up in a bin, waiting to get filled. Speed of execution is tracked by 
broker‐rating services, discussed later in this chapter, in the section 
“Finding Out What Reviewers Think.”
✓
✓Customer service: Do you have a question about your account or about 
making a trade? When you do, you’ll need to reach the broker and ask it. 
The levels of service vary wildly. Some brokers have customer service 
reps available at your beck and call either in offices or on the phone. 
Others let you email a question and wait for an answer.
✓
✓Site reliability: No one wants to be in the position of finding a promis-
ing investment only to discover that his or her online brokerage is down 
for repair. Some brokerages have focused on limiting system downtime, 
which might be important to you if you trade many times a day. Again, 
this is something brokerage‐rating services measure.
✓
✓Access to advanced stock‐buying tools: Some brokerage sites are pretty 
bare‐bones because they assume that the investors already have the 
software and tools they need. This is dramatically changing, however, as 
many third‐party investing websites are vanishing, scaling back, or start-
ing to charge for their services. Now, investors are increasingly looking 
to their brokerages to provide comprehensive tools that can track tax 
liabilities, help them go prospecting for stocks, or monitor market move-
ments or breaking news.
✓
✓Ease of use: Online brokers geared for people new to online investing or 
who plan to trade very infrequently are minimalists and have as few but-
tons as possible. They’re the Zen of trading. But those aimed for hyper-
active traders who click Buy and Sell so many times they have calluses 
on their fingers tend to give investors dozens of options allowing them 
to do some advanced stuff. Some sites targeting advanced traders pro-
vide trading tools aimed at helping investors flip stocks or other options 
quickly and at set prices. But that might be overwhelming if you just 
want to buy 100 shares of General Electric stock every couple of months.

“Gotchas” to watch out for
Brokerage firms often have confusing commission structures to fool you into 
thinking you’ll pay less than you ultimately do. Make sure that you check to 
see whether the firm charges extra for certain types of orders, such as limit 
orders (I discuss limit orders in Chapter 5) or mutual funds. Some brokers 
zing you with fees or inflate commissions if you don’t keep a balance of a 
certain size. Some brokers also charge you for switching to another broker. 
Always check before signing up for covert fees. The “Avoiding Hidden Fees” 
section, later in the chapter, can help you spot things to watch out for.
Separating the Types of Brokerages
Choosing a brokerage firm might seem intimidating, but it’s really no different 
than picking a restaurant. You can find fast‐food restaurants, where you have 
to walk up to the counter, place your order, put on your own ketchup and 
mustard, and find a place to sit. Then there are full‐service restaurants, where 
you’re seated and pampered by dressed‐up waiters who bring everything at 
your command and even clean the bread crumbs away when you’re done.
The same goes for brokerages. Self‐service brokers give you everything you 
need to get the job done and let you have at it. Because you’re doing much of 
the work yourself, unless you ask for help, self‐service brokers tend to have 
the lowest commissions. Self‐service brokers are commonly grouped into two 
baskets: deep discounters and discounters. Then you have the full‐service tra-
ditional brokerages, which hold your hand through the whole process, down to 
suggesting investments, analyzing your portfolio, and offering estate‐planning 
services. Remember that these are general brokerage types, and sometimes 
the lines blur a bit because some self‐service brokers, especially the discount-
ers and premium discounters, let you buy advice from them if you ask.
If you can’t find a page on the broker’s site that lists all its fees, commissions, 
and other charges in less than three mouse clicks from the home page, look 
elsewhere. I’ve found that brokers that bury fees do so for a reason.
How do you decide what you need? It’s really a matter of deciding ahead of 
time how often you intend to trade, what types of investments you plan to 
buy, and how long you’ll hold them. It’s difficult to know this in advance, but 
there are ways to figure it out. For instance, did you perform the trading sim-
ulations I mention in Chapter 2? If so, how often did you trade? Next, familiar-
ize yourself with the four types of online brokers: deep discount, discount, 
premium discount, and full‐service traditional. Read the following descrip-

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
Double‐check brokers’ fees before signing up — they change frequently. Also 
remember that some brokers might charge lower commissions if you pay 
a monthly subscription fee, meet certain balance thresholds, or hold other 
types of accounts in addition to the brokerage account.
Deep discounters: Trading for $5 or less
These are the Walmarts and Home Depots of the brokerage world. When 
you sign up for a deep discounter, you’re on your own. But if you know what 
you’re doing, that’s a good thing because you don’t have to worry about 
getting pestered by a financial advisor trying to pitch stocks you have no 
interest in. And you’ll get all the basics that you truly need, such as year‐end 
tax statements, company information mailed to your door (if you choose 
paper delivery), basic access to stock quotes and research, and the ability to 
buy and sell stocks and other investments. But the real beauty of these bro-
kers is their sweet, low price: Because they don’t offer niceties like branch 
offices, they can have the lowest commissions, usually $5 a trade or less. 
Leaders include
✓
✓Capital One Investing is trying to prove that deep discounters aren’t 
just for active traders. Capital One’s trades start at $6.95 each, but you 
can buy stocks for $4 as part of its “ShareBuilder Plan.” Capital One 
Investing caters to beginners, though. The site tries to keep things 
simple by allowing you to enter the dollar amount you want to spend 
buying stock, not the number of shares, as many brokerages do. You 
endure some sacrifices, though. The discounted $4 orders with the 
“ShareBuilder Plan”aren’t executed immediately, but rather, pooled and 
filled once a week (on Tuesdays). This is a deal killer if you’re a day 
trader — someone trying to jump in and out of stocks several times a 
day to make a quick profit. If you want to buy a stock immediately, the 
commission jumps to $7. And be sure that you’re not planning on selling 
much because the commission for sell orders is also $7.
✓
✓FolioInvesting offers a variety of pricing plans so that investors can 
choose which one works best. FolioInvesting’s Basic plan lets you trade 
stocks for a low price of $4 as long as you’re okay if the trades aren’t 
executed right away, but instead, during two “windows” during the day. 
If you’d like your trades to go through right away, you’ll be charged $10. 
You also pay a $15 maintenance fee per quarter if you place less than 
three trades in the quarter. If you pay a $290‐a‐year subscription fee, 
though, you get free delayed trades and a discounted rate of $3 to have 
trades go through right away.
✓
✓Loyal3 has most brokerages beat on price: It’s free. The brokerage firm 
allows users to buy and sell individual stocks for no commission at all. 
The site, which is built to attract newbie investors, requires only an 
initial deposit of $10 and will even let you buy partial shares of stock. If 
there’s a catch, it’s that not all stocks are available on Loyal3. But most 

98

of the biggies are, including Amazon.com, Walt Disney, Facebook, and 
Microsoft. Be sure to check the website at www.loyal3.com/stocks 
to see if the broker offers the stock you’re interested in buying. It’ll 
be interesting to see if Loyal3 can make a go with zero commissions, 
because other brokerages that have tried this have ultimately been 
forced to charge.
✓
✓OptionsHouse is trying to bridge the gap between discounters with 
advanced trading features and the deep discounters with low prices. 
This brokerage charges $5 a trade and doesn’t require any account mini-
mums. But it also offers a robust website with tools especially designed 
for advanced traders.
✓
✓Robinhood is the latest brokerage to try offering the ultimate lure: 
Free commissions. This brokerage launched in 2014 as the latest to 
provide $0 commissions. It’s different than other brokerages in that it 
is entirely focused on mobile devices. Instead of providing a website 
for investors to log into and place trades, Robinhood offers only apps 
for smartphones and tablets. You won’t find the rich data services that 
are available on the websites of other brokers — but you won’t pay for 
them, either.
✓
✓SogoTrade’s $5‐a‐trade is appealing not just for the low price. If you 
plan to be a serious trader, SogoTrade lets you download software to 
your computer — software similar to that provided by more expensive 
online brokers — which helps you track the market’s daily movements. 
You must open an account with at least $500, but you do not need to 
maintain a minimum balance going forward. There are ways to cut the 
commission further; the commission drops to $3 if you trade 150 times 
or more a quarter.
✓
✓TradeKing aims to give investors a few more niceties than other deep 
discounters, such as the ability to write checks against cash bal-
ances (for a fee), access to company news and research reports, and 
a straightforward flat‐fee commission of $4.95. It’s geared largely for 
active investors who want to focus on buying individual stocks and 
not exchange‐traded funds, which can be traded for free at some larger 
­brokerages like TD Ameritrade. (Exchange‐traded funds, or ETFs — 
mutual‐fund‐like baskets of investments that trade like stocks — can be 
great for many investors and are covered in more detail in Chapter 11.) 
TradeKing also targets investors interested in buying and selling options. 
The brokerage offers a tool on its website, called the Profit + Loss 
Calculator, that graphs an option’s strategy and helps determine its 
­success. I explain options in more detail in the next chapter, but for now, 
suffice it to say that they’re financial instruments that let investors either 
reduce risk or turbocharge their returns. No minimum account balance 
is required, but you’ll be charged a $50‐a‐year fee if you have less than 
$2,500 in your account and don’t trade at least once a year. You can view 
some of the tools TradeKing offers to options investors in Figure 4‐1.

Beginning investors always ask me how much money they need to start 
and where they can get started investing online. You can start with next to 
nothing with brokers that have no minimum deposit requirements, which 
includes most of the deep discounters. TradeKing even reimburses you for 
fees your old broker might charge if you switch. If you’re the kind of person 
who can’t seem to save money until you’ve sent your cash off to a bank or 
brokerage, these are great places to start.
Discounters: Trading for $5.01 to $10
If the thought of being completely on your own makes you nervous but 
you’re not willing to give up low‐cost commissions, the discount brokers sit 
in the sweet spot for you. These brokers suit most investors ranging from 
beginners to the more advanced because they generally offer some advice (if 
you ask for it), and many have offices in most major cities. Even if you’re not 
looking for advice, the discounters are still appealing because they load their 
websites with advanced tools to help do‐it‐yourself investors of all levels. 
Some provide access to advanced trading tools, real‐time stock quotes, or 
special computer programs that let you enter trades just as fast as the trad-
ers on Wall Street. These extras come with slightly higher commissions, but 
the difference isn’t all that significant anymore compared with the deep dis-
counters, and it might not be a deal‐breaker for you. Price wars have yanked 
commissions from the discounters down to between $5.01 and $10. Most 
discounters also offer price breaks if you’re a hyperactive trader. The names 
to know here are
✓
✓Bank of America might not be what you think of as a stockbroker, but 
it’s one of the large banks aggressively boosting its brokerage services. 
Traditionally, banks have targeted the well‐heeled with personal bankers 
who pick out investments like personal shoppers pick out ties for rich 
executives. But Bank of America’s Merrill Edge unit has added self‐
service brokerage fees with commissions starting at $6.95. And you can 
get 30 free trades a month if you keep at least $25,000 with the bank in 
a deposit account, such as a Bank of America savings account. As your 
account grows, you have access to the wealth management services 
offered by the bank. Bank of America makes its connection with Merrill 
Lynch clear on its website, as shown in Figure 4‐2.
✓
✓Charles Schwab tries to be the Toyota Camry of brokers: not flashy or 
exotic in any one area but practical and pleasing to the bulk of investors. 
Schwab kicked off the industry’s latest round of price cutting in early 
2010 when it lowered its online per‐trade commission to a flat rate of 
$8.95 from $12.95. It’s still at $8.95, keeping it very competitive among 
the other discounters. Schwab’s commissions still aren’t the cheap-
est, but for that price, the broker adds services that might be valuable, 
whether you’re looking for help or want to be left to your own devices. 
For instance, you can buy 200 exchange‐traded funds for no commission. 

101

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
Do‐it‐yourselfers might like Schwab’s Equity Ratings, a computerized 
system that evaluates stocks and assigns them letter‐grade scores from 
A to F. It also provides access to Wall Street research and a full suite of 
banking services, including high interest rates paid on cash sitting in 
your account. But if you decide later you need more help, Schwab offers 
mutual funds designed to fit very specific needs in addition to making 
consultants available to give you personalized advice. If you’re not going 
to use all these extra services, though, the higher commission might not 
be worth it. You can see the site in Figure 4‐3.

✓DittoTrade takes a very communal approach toward online invest-
ing. When you sign up for the brokerage service, you can also choose 
to “attach” your trades to the trades of other investors. Let’s say, for 
instance, you have a friend with a knack at picking great technology 
stocks. If you and your friend have an account at DittoTrade, you can 
choose to buy or sell any stock your friend is buying and selling. You’ll 
receive an email telling you your friend’s trade is going to be made, and 
you can choose to have the system carry out the trade for you, too. You 
can remove your “attachment” at any time. You will pay $6.95 per trade.
✓
✓E*TRADE has a reputation as being an innovator in the industry and 
seems to be always looking for ways to separate itself from others. 
E*TRADE has long targeted active traders with computer software such 
as E*Trade Pro, which is software that lets you find stocks and other 
investments that meet your criteria or test how trading strategies would 
have worked in the past. But E*TRADE has things for beginners, too, 
such as access to stock research from several providers and the capabil-
ity to shift cash to a checking or high‐yield savings account. The com-
missions range from $7.99 to $9.99, based on your account balance and 
how often you trade.
✓
✓Fidelity gets good marks for making its website easy to navigate and 
getting trades through quickly. Fidelity has also been a leader in adding 
functions outside of just plain‐old U.S. stock trading, including an 
advanced online system to buy bonds, invest in initial public offerings, 
and trade stocks outside the United States. For years, Fidelity was a 
premium‐priced online brokerage, but that changed in early 2010 when 
it answered Schwab’s price cut and slashed its commission even lower 
than Schwab’s, to $7.95 where it still is today. In addition, Fidelity is 
offering free commissions on select ETFs from iShares, which is one of 
the largest providers of these investments.
✓
✓Motif Investing is for investors who want to pick trends or themes, not 
necessarily individual stocks. Customers can choose from dozens of 
premade investing “Motifs,” which are broad ideas for investment, such 
as companies working on biotechnology developments, called “Biotech 
Breakthroughs,” or companies that get most of their revenue from the 
U.S., called “All American.” Investors can buy the Motif, and then Motif 
Investing will take the money invested and invest it in a group of up to 
30 stocks that are preselected as fitting the theme. This brokerage is 
convenient for investors who don’t want to choose individual stocks, 
but aren’t happy with the current selection of mutual funds or ETFs. 
Motif Investing charges a $9.95 commission to buy or sell a Motif. You 
can also buy and sell individual stocks for $4.95 per trade.
✓
✓OptionsXpress, as its name implies, is focused on investors who like to 
trade options. Options trades can get mind‐numbingly complicated, and 
some are best known by exotic names like butterflies, straddles, and 
strangles. OptionsXpress helps traders place these complex trades with 
easy‐to‐follow web screens and systems to help track the profit or loss.

This brokerage is clearly geared for active traders, based on the tools 
that are provided on the site geared to help investors find investments 
and act on them quickly. Stock trades cost a flat $8.95. The brokerage is 
owned by Charles Schwab.
✓
✓Scottrade tries to undercut the big three (Schwab, E*TRADE, and TD 
Ameritrade) on price but not service. Its $7 commissions are con-
siderably less than the other top players’, but you still get access to 
branches, and it also has a separate service for active traders. It even 
throws in access to banking services including ATM withdrawals and 
online bill pay, something you’d usually get only from more expensive 
brokers. Scottrade also offers various tools for investors, ranging from 
advanced day traders to more leisurely investors who buy and hold for 
the long term.
✓
✓TD Ameritrade’s earliest customers were active traders looking for 
low commissions. But the brokerage’s low‐cost roots are eroding, as its 
$9.99‐per‐trade commission is now more than what most of its major 
rivals charge. But TD Ameritrade tries to make up for its higher com-
mission by offering a variety of services that might save you money. 
Investors who trade frequently during the day also like TD Ameritrade’s 
bonus PC software trading tools, like the Trade Architect and thinkor-
swim, which let you see second‐by‐second stock price movements 
or test trading strategies and analyze how they would have done. TD 
Ameritrade is also a leader in offering consumers free trading in ETFs. 
Customers can choose from more than 100 best‐in‐class ETFs from sev-
eral leading providers, including iShares and Vanguard, and pay no com-
mission as long as they are held more than 30 days. (See Figure 4‐4.)

✓Vanguard gets bragging rights after consistently scoring high ratings 
from J.D. Power. Vanguard’s site wins fans for its speed, the quality of cus-
tomer service, and availability to help in navigating the site and making 
investment decisions. And thanks to aggressive price cuts in 2010, the 
brokerage can now compete with other discounters on price. Vanguard’s 
commission structure, though, is a little more complex than at other bro-
kers. The first 25 trades you make in a year are a competitive $7 if you 
have less than $50,000 in your account. After you trade 25 times, trades 
jump to $20. If you keep more than $50,000 in your account but less than 
$500,000, you can get unlimited $7 trades. If you have more than $500,000 
in your account, trades are discounted to $2, and trades are free if you 
have more than a million bucks in your account. Vanguard does provide 
free unlimited trading to all investors in its own family of well‐regarded 
ETFs. Remember, Vanguard’s stock brokerage offering is separate from the 
account that lets you buy and sell Vanguard mutual funds, which I cover 
later. Some investors may be charged a $20 annual account service fee.
✓
✓Wells Fargo is another bank that follows the model of using brokerage ser-
vices to tempt customers to put more money in its hands. Wells Fargo’s 
self‐service stock commissions start at $8.95. But if you keep at least 
$25,000 in your deposit accounts, you can get up to 100 free trades a year 
without paying the monthly service charge of $30. Wells Fargo also gives 
you 100 trades a year with no monthly service fee if you keep $50,000 with 
the bank and its brokerage. Wells Fargo’s free trading deal might be better 
for some since the $50,000 balance requirement doesn’t have to be sitting 
in a deposit account, like a savings account, but also includes the value 
of the stocks in your portfolio. But falling short of the $25,000 deposit bal-
ance or $50,000 total can be costly, resulting in a $30 a month fee.

Are free trades really free?
When anything claims to be “free” in online 
investing, your defenses should go up instantly. 
Loyal3, Robinhood, Bank of America, and Wells 
Fargo promise free trades to investors. Be on 
guard and evaluate all the stipulations, though, 
before assuming that these free offers are best 
for you. (See the section on hidden fees later in 
this chapter.) The first thing to remember when 
looking at free brokerages: Don’t overlook what 
interest rate will be paid on cash sitting in your 
account. Not paying attention to interest rates 
could wipe out any savings you think you’re 
getting from free trades.
Here’s what I mean. Say that you trade ten 
times a year and normally leave about $10,000 
of uninvested cash in your account. If trades 
are free, it’s true — your commission costs 
would be zero. But you still could be overpaying 
if you’re not getting a rate of return on your 
uninvested cash. In fact, you’d be $150 better 
off paying $9.99 a trade if you get 2.5 percent 
interest on cash sitting in your account. 
Granted these days you’re lucky if you get just 
1.0 percent on a “high yield” savings account, 
so it’s less important now. But if interest rates 
rise as many forecasters expect, then free 
trades will become less compelling.
I’ve come up with a formula that takes the 
guesswork out of “free” trades:
1.	 Multiply the number of trades you do 
each year by the commission. Save this 
number.
2.	 Multiply the amount of uninvested cash 
you expect to keep in your account by the 
interest rate you will collect. Divide this 
number by 100 and save the result.
3.	 Subtract the answer in Step 2 from the 
answer in Step 1.
This formula shows you how much the 
commissions each broker you’re considering 
are costing you after adjusting for the rate of 
return you’ll get on your cash: The lower the 
number, the better. If you’re choosing between 
a couple of brokers, crunch this formula and 
choose the broker with the lowest (or negative) 
number. Clearly, when interest rates are next 
to nothing as they are in 2015, missing out on 
interest isn’t as big a deal. But when rates rise, 
savvy investors should pay close attention to 
this hidden cost of free trades.

Full‐service traditional
Because you’re reading Online Investing For Dummies, chances are good that 
you’re a do‐it‐yourself kind of investor or one looking for minimal handholding. 
But maybe after reading the preceding descriptions, you’re looking for even 
more help. That’s when you might consider a full‐service ­traditional broker.
Full‐service brokers pride themselves on being part of your team of 
“people” whom you call on routinely for advice, like your real estate agent, 
housekeeper, and mechanic. The top full‐service traditional brokerages are 
the Wall Street firms you’ve probably heard of, such as Bank of America’s 
Merrill Lynch (shown in Figure 4‐5), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (www.
morganstanleyclientserv.com), Edward Jones (www.edwardjones.
com), Goldman Sachs (www.goldmansachs.com), and UBS (www.ubs.
com/us/en.html). Merrill Lynch, through Bank of America, competes with 
the discounters. But Merrill Lynch (www.ml.com) also provides full‐service 
brokerage services as part of its wealth management offering, geared for 
wealthy investors.
And by now, most full‐service traditional brokers can legitimately call them-
selves online brokerages because they have websites that let you view your 
accounts. Services that these firms provide include
✓
✓Constant stock recommendations: Most big Wall Street firms have 
famous strategists and analysts who think big thoughts and come up 
with stock tips. The brokers then spread those tips to you.
Figure 4-5:  
Merrill 
Lynch 
provides 
web‐based 
tools to 
investors as 
part of its 
online 
service.

107

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
✓
✓Access to initial public offerings: When companies go public, they first 
sell their shares to large Wall Street investment banks. Those shares, 
especially if the initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be popular, 
are often a sought‐after commodity because they have the chance to rise 
in value the first day. If you’re an active customer with these firms’ bro-
kerage divisions, you might get a shot at buying these shares at the IPO 
price. (You find more on IPOs in Bonus Chapter 2 on the website associ-
ated with this book.)
✓
✓Availability of other financial services: If you’re a customer with a 
full‐service traditional brokerage, you might get extra financial services, 
such as help with your taxes or estate planning.
But before you get too excited about the extra services that traditional full‐
service brokers may provide, you also have downsides to consider, such as
✓
✓High cost: Wall Street firms have to pay somehow for those fancy offices 
you’re enjoying. The fees tend to be higher, and you might pay a lofty 
commission for each trade or pay a percentage of your assets.
✓
✓Uneven treatment: Remember that it’s unlikely you’ll end up being 
Goldman Sach’s best customer, so don’t expect to get the real goods. 
For instance, when shares of the next truly promising IPO are doled out, 
if you’re not a top customer or famous, you probably won’t get shares 
anyway. (Fees and rates can vary, too, which is why I didn’t even bother 
coming up with a table comparing fee structures for the full‐service tra-
ditional brokerage crowd.)
✓
✓Potential for conflicts: Because brokers are often paid by commission, 
they might have an incentive to urge you to trade more frequently than 
you might like.
Be skeptical if a friend or family member recommends a broker to you. Many 
brokerage firms give customers bounties of $50 or more or dozens of free 
trades if someone they refer signs up. I’m not telling you that you can’t trust 
your friends. Just know that people who recommend their broker might have 
a motive other than telling you which broker is best for you.
Avoiding Hidden Fees
The stock trade commission is likely the fee you’ll pay the most often, so it’s 
wise to pay the most attention to it. But don’t think it’s the only fee. Brokers 
often charge a host of other fees, which, depending on your circumstance, 
can add up fast. These extra fees are increasingly important for online inves-
tors to monitor as brokers’ trading commissions get more comparable. 

108
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
You should look for a page that discloses these fees, like the one shown in 
Figure 4‐6. Here are some common hidden fees you should be aware of:
✓
✓Maintenance fees are monthly, quarterly, or annual fees that some bro-
kers charge you just to have an account with them. Don’t pay mainte-
nance fees. Period. If you’re paying them, you’re probably at the wrong 
broker. Most brokers exempt you from paying maintenance fees if you 
meet certain requirements. If you can’t meet them, switch to a differ-
ent broker.
✓
✓Inactivity fees are the ugly cousins of maintenance fees. These are fees 
a brokerage might charge if you don’t gin up enough commissions for 
the brokerage by trading. Don’t allow these fees to push you to buy and 
sell stock more than you’re comfortable with. Most brokerages that 
charge such fees offer exemptions for customers who meet other crite-
ria. TradeKing, for instance, charges $50 a year for investors who don’t 
place a trade in 12 months. But TradeKing won’t charge this fee, even if 
you don’t trade in a 12‐month period, if you have $2,500 or more in your 
brokerage account.
✓
✓Transfer fees are charged when you want to part ways with your broker. 
Expect to get nicked with a $50 or higher fee, which brokers charge sup-
posedly to cover their cost of shipping all your stock holdings and trans-
ferring cash to your new broker. One way to avoid this charge is to sell 
all the stocks in the old account and then write a check or electronically 
transfer the cash to the new broker drawn on your old account. But this 
might not work. Keep in mind that you’ll incur commissions for every 
stock you sell, and tax considerations might cost you well over $50. 
Refer to Chapter 3 for a refresher on capital gains taxes. Some brokers, 
including Scottrade, don’t charge a transfer fee. And some brokers will 
pick up the transfer fee tab if you move the account to them.
✓
✓Certificate fees are charged if you want your broker to mail you the 
physical stock certificates you own. It’s usually a $500 or higher charge. 
Some online brokers won’t help you get paper certificates at all.
✓
✓Check‐writing fees range dramatically from broker to broker. Some 
charge you an annual fee to have the privilege to write checks against 
your account. Others give you a certain number of free checks and 
charge only if you write checks that bounce.
✓
✓Special orders are added fees if you trade more than a set number 
of shares. Most brokers also charge extra for placing so‐called limit 
orders — trades in which you set the price you’re willing to accept. 
Limit orders are covered in more detail in the next chapter.
✓
✓Margin fees are interest charges that result from borrowing money from 
the broker to buy investments with. Buying on margin is only for the 
most risk‐ready investors, and I explain why in Chapter 5.

Finding Out What Reviewers Think
It can be overwhelming to parse through all the brokers’ commissions 
because there appear to be more moving parts than in a Swiss watch. 
Minimum requirements and fees vary, and it’s hard to know how fast a bro-

Is Your Money Safe? Checking 
Out Your Broker
When you’re about to hand over your life’s savings to a broker, especially 
one with no offices, you want to make sure that it’s a reputable outfit. As 
investors in the Bernie Madoff investment scam learned the hard way, it’s up 
to you to make sure that you’re dealing with a legitimate broker. Unlike bank 
savings accounts, brokerages have no government guarantee. But you still 
have some safeguards.

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
Your first layer of protection comes from the Securities Investor Protection 
Corporation (SIPC). The SIPC was formed by Congress in 1970 to protect 
investors by promising to help recover and return cash to investors if their 
brokerage closes due to bankruptcy. If cash or stock mysteriously goes miss-
ing in your account, the SIPC might help you recover the funds. The SIPC 
has provided $2.3 billion in funds and helped in the recovery of $134 billion 
in assets for 773,000 investors since it was formed in 1970 through 2014. If 
a brokerage fails and doesn’t have enough money to repay customers, the 
SIPC covers up to $500,000 per customer. You should always check whether 
a broker is an SIPC member by logging on to www.sipc.org. In addition, 
some brokers carry additional insurance to protect customer assets beyond 
$500,000. All the brokers mentioned in this chapter are SIPC members.
Next, make sure that your broker has the appropriate approval from regu-
latory bodies to buy and sell investments. You wouldn’t let someone who 
isn’t a doctor remove your appendix, right? You should also make sure that 
your broker is registered to be a broker. You can do this using the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) BrokerCheck at brokercheck.
finra.org. BrokerCheck tells you whether the brokerage is registered with 
this important regulatory body and whether the registration is current. Each 
state also keeps tabs on brokerages serving customers in its region. State 
regulators are coordinated by the North American Securities Administrators 
Association, which provides access to the public at www.nasaa.org.
Lastly, you want to know whether the broker you’re considering has been 
disciplined recently. You can access this info from FINRA’s BrokerCheck 
by downloading the broker’s regulatory report and checking the section 
that spells out disciplinary action. Information is also available from a 
system maintained by the New York Stock Exchange’s Disciplinary Action 
database at www.nyse.com/regulation/disciplinary‐actions. And 
the ultimate watchdog on Wall Street is the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which maintains records on brokers at www.sec.gov and 
provides tips to investors looking to check out their brokers at http://
sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm. The SEC leaves tracking routine 
disciplinary actions to FINRA, but does provide information when it pursues 
legal action against brokers. You can track SEC’s legal actions by using the 
search function at www.sec.gov.
Cutting the Cord: Mobile Trading
If the idea of checking up on your portfolio and placing trades while sipping 
margaritas by the pool appeals to you, get a life. Well, okay, sometimes you 
do need to check up on your account even when you’re not sitting behind 
a computer at your desk. To help, plenty of brokers are providing wireless 

112
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
access to account information so that customers can access their portfolios 
at any time, be it from a device running Google’s Android operating system, 
Apple’s iOS, Microsoft’s Windows 10, or other wireless devices. You have 
several ways to accomplish this:
✓
✓From a laptop: Most laptops are equipped with wireless capabilities. If 
your laptop is set up for wireless access, using popular Wi‐Fi technology, 
you can get online at thousands of locations that offer wireless Internet 
connections, called Wi‐Fi hotspots. Some hotspots available across the 
country are free to use, and you can find them by using this site: www.
wififreespot.com.
✓
✓From a smartphone or tablet’s web browser: Several online brokers 
reformat their web pages so that they appear correctly on the small 
screen of smartphones. This technology is usually called mobile web 
trading. Just open the wireless browser in your web‐enabled phone, 
Android, iPhone, or Windows 10 device and type the address of the 
broker. Most brokers can detect that you’re accessing them from a 
phone and reformat the pages automatically. Some, like Fidelity, work 
best if you go to a special website formatted for a mobile device. 
Fidelity’s mobile site is www.fidelity.mobi.
✓
✓From a smartphone or tablet (or computer) using an “app”: Most 
major online brokers are making special software, or so‐called apps, that 
you can download to your smartphone or tablet and use to check stock 
quotes or trade stocks. Once you download and install these apps, you 
start them up and you can enjoy an online trading experience that’s 
more engaging. Many investors prefer so‐called “mobile trading apps” 
over mobile web trading because the interface is spiffier and typically 
easier to use. Online brokerages have been rushing to offer mobile trad-
ing apps. TD Ameritrade, for instance, offers two apps: TD Ameritrade 
Mobile for most users and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader for more 
advanced traders. If mobile trading apps are important, you will want 
to check with the online broker to make sure it supports your specific 
smartphone.
The distinction between laptops and smartphones and tablets continues 
to blur. The best example is Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system 
released in 2015. Windows 10 runs on computers, laptops, and phones. 
That means if you’re on a device running Windows 10, you have the 
choice of going to your brokerage’s website or downloading an app from 
the Windows Store. More choice — it’s a good thing!

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
A word about wireless security
Security is a serious concern when dealing 
with your money, and I discuss how to keep 
your money safe in more detail in Chapters 2 
and 18. But when you access your stock data 
wirelessly, especially from a public area, you 
need to pay special attention to security. Here 
are three ways to do just that:
✓
✓Make sure that your data is encrypted.
Most Internet browsers let you know 
whether the data is being encrypted — 
scrambled, in other words. If you’re using 
Microsoft’s Edge browser, you can check 
by looking for the icon of a padlock. The 
padlock icon usually appears to the left of 
the address bar when a website asks for 
potentially sensitive information, such as 
account numbers, or when the website 
address begins with https (s stands for 
secure) rather than the usual http. When 
you see a padlock icon, that’s a signal to you 
that the data is being scrambled to make 
it harder for the guy sitting next to you at 
Starbucks to read your information. Your 
computer and Windows then scramble 
your data. The data is then decrypted, or 
unscrambled, by the website.
You can click the padlock icon to get more 
information about the security of the web-
site. Be sure to select the check box that 
pops up to confirm that the site’s cer-
tificate, or identification, lists the name of 
your brokerage firm. If the padlock doesn’t 
appear, that might mean that the site uses 
a different method of securing data, which 
is something you should ask your broker 
about.
✓
✓Use virtual private network (VPN) 
­software.
A VPN is a technology used to protect 
your data from snoops over the Internet. 
Some Internet service providers (ISPs) 
offer this service to customers, or if you’re 
using your work laptop, a VPN might be 
installed already. You might also consider 
installing VPN software on your computer. 
Some VPN software is free, like Hotspot 
Shield (www.hotspotshield.com) 
and OpenVPN (http://openvpn.
net), while others have a free trial version, 
such as LogMeInHamachi (https://
secure.logmein.com/products/
hamachi). PublicVPN.com (http://
publicvpn.com) charges $6.95 a month, 
and Hotspot.vpn (www.hotspotvpn.
com) charges $8.88 a month.
✓
✓Consider digital security key fobs.
Some brokers, such as E*TRADE, provide 
key fobs that digitally display a new  
6‐digit code every minute (https://
us.etrade.com/e/t/jumppage/
v i e w j u m p p a g e ? P a g e N a m e =​
secureid_enter). The idea here is 
that you’d then take that code and use it (in 
addition to your username and password) 
to log on to the website. The added wrinkle 
of an always‐changing code makes it 
extremely unlikely that a hacker could 
break into your accounts. E*TRADE also 
has an app that will provide the secret code 
to you on your smartphone.
Be sure to ask your broker what kind of 
protection it gives you if a hacker gets into 
your account. E*TRADE and TD Ameritrade, 
for instance, will cover the entire loss. Also, 
TD Ameritrade (www.tdameritrade.
com/security/index.html) pro-
vides a very detailed guide to all the things 
you can do to protect your computer when 
investing online. You don’t need to be a TD 
Ameritrade customer to use the site. The 
site also provides tips if you use browsers 
other than Internet Explorer.

Pay Attention to Where Your Cash Is 
Parked: MoneyMarket Funds
You’re an online investor, right? So why would you care about money that 
you haven’t invested? It turns out that one of the biggest secrets in the 
brokerage world is what happens to cash sitting in your account that’s not 
invested. Don’t underestimate how important this is. If you have $10,000 in 
cash in your account waiting to be invested, that’s worth $100 a year at a 
1 percent interest rate. And while rates have been historically low, if they rise 
to more normal levels, the interest rates earned by uninvested cash will be 
even more important.
This is my way of telling you that, before choosing an online broker, you want 
to be absolutely sure what rate of interest your uninvested cash will get and 
how it’s handled. Ideally, you want a sweep account. With a sweep account, 
idle cash is automatically scooped up and put into a savings or moneymarket 
account. It’s ideal because you don’t have to do anything, and you’re certain 
that your money is working for you. Just make sure that your money is being 
swept into a savings account or money market that pays an interest rate 
that is competitive with the going market rate. Savings accounts tend to pay 
higher interest rates than moneymarket funds do. Some brokers won’t auto-
matically sweep your uninvested cash into a money market fund, so it’s up 
to you to ask about having it done. Since interest rates have been at histori-
cal lows in 2015, don’t expect to get rich off your savings held at a brokerage 
site. Still, there’s usually no additional charge for sweeping cash to a money 
market fund, so it doesn’t hurt.
There’s a dirty little secret in the brokerage industry: Uninvested cash gets 
about 0% interest at nearly all brokers. Even many brokerage firm’s “sweep” 
accounts pay next to nothing on uninvested cash. Don’t leave cash sitting in 
a brokerage account long. Most brokerages allow you to transfer cash in and 
out of your account from an outside bank using Automated Clearing House 
or ACH technology. You can create an ACH link between your brokerage 
account and savings account so money earns interest when it’s not invested. 
Be sure to set up a savings account outside the brokerage that pays a decent 
amount of interest. Check Bankrate.com to find banks offering decent 
interest rates. Currently, decent rates are about 1% ‐ but in 2015 rates are 
very low – and expected to rise at some point.

Buying Stocks and Mutual Funds  
without a Broker
Can you be an online investor without a broker? Sure. Some investors want to 
buy stocks but don’t want to bother with a broker. There’s nothing that says 
you need to have a broker to buy and sell stocks or mutual funds.
Stocks: Direct investments
Direct investments are where you buy the stock straight from the company. 
Many large companies, such as Coca‐Cola, Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Walt 
Disney, allow you to buy and sell your stock with them and avoid a broker. 
Many direct investment programs are connected with dividend reinvestment 
plans (DRIPs), where the companies let you use dividend payments to buy, or 
reinvest, additional shares.
If you’re interested in going with a direct investment program, you can visit 
the investor‐relations section of the company’s website to see whether it 
offers one. Many companies allow you to participate in direct investment pro-
grams through their transfer agent — or a company with the responsibility of 
tracking ownership of shares.
P&G, for instance, has an elaborate Shareholder Investment Program that 
lets you buy as little as $250 in stock and will even reinvest the dividends. 
You can read about this program (shown in Figure 4‐8) at https://www‐
us.computershare.com/investor/3x/plans/planslist.asp?bhjs=
1&fla=1&planid=1390&state=eStateDisplayPlanSummary.

Gamble is 
one of many 
companies 
that allow

directly 
from their 
websites.

116
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
The other way to find direct investment programs is through directory 
services, such as The Moneypaper’s Directinvesting.com (www.direct 
investing.com). The site provides a search function so that you can see 
whether a company you’re interested in sells shares directly to investors. 
Just enter the symbol of the company you’re interested in, and you can see 
whether the company offers a direct investment plan.
Here are the upsides to direct investing:
✓
✓Potential commission savings: The fees charged by direct investment 
programs can be lower than what some brokers charge. P&G, for instance, 
charges $0 if you pay for it using an electronic transfer from your bank, 
and $2.50 if you send a check or money order to buy the stock.
✓
✓Dividend reinvestments: Dividends can often be reinvested for free. If 
you’re with a broker, you would often incur a commission to reinvest a 
dividend into the company stock.
As you might suspect, direct investing has some downsides:
✓
✓Not free for all transactions: Some companies even charge commissions 
that exceed what deep discount brokerages charge for certain services. 
For instance, P&G charges $25 if you want to sell the shares immediately 
and $15 if you’re willing to wait. There can also be loads of additional 
fees, including quarterly maintenance fees. Be sure to check the compa-
ny’s website, usually in a document called a direct stock plan prospectus, 
and understand all the fees that are charged.
✓
✓Setup fees: Although opening a brokerage account is usually free, some 
direct investment plans charge a fee to get started. Some plans also have 
minimum initial deposits. P&G, for instance, requires a $250 investment 
for a new account. Some charge setup fees.
✓
✓Limited universe: By using direct investment plans, you’re narrowing 
your universe of possible investments to the hundreds of the largely 
older, blue‐chip companies that offer these programs. That means you 
miss out on younger or smaller companies.
✓
✓Administrative hassles: With direct investment plans, you need to 
manage all your separate accounts, which could be a pain if you have 
ten or more investments. You also won’t get access to any of the tax 
assistance or research the brokers provide.
Mutual funds: Straight from the  
mutual fund company
Mutual funds gather money from many investors and use the cash to invest 
in a basket of assets. When you buy a mutual fund, you’re joining a pool with 

117

 Chapter 4: Connecting with an Online Broker
other investors that own assets, rather than owning the assets yourself. You 
can read more about mutual funds in Chapter 10.
Nearly all brokers let you buy and sell mutual funds in addition to stocks and 
other investments. And sometimes trading in mutual funds can make sense, 
especially if it’s free. Most brokers have a list of “transaction‐free” mutual 
funds you can buy and sell for no charge. Schwab, for instance, lets you buy 
and sell more than 2,000 mutual funds that are part of its OneSource Select 
program at no cost (www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/
accounts_products/investment/mutual_funds/no_load_mutual_
funds).
But, if you’re not going to buy from the transaction‐free lists, you’re wasting 
your money buying mutual funds this way. Schwab, for instance, charges $76 
to buy a mutual fund not on its list (selling is free). Don’t let your broker’s 
commission schedule determine which mutual funds you buy.
One of the best things about mutual funds is that you can buy them with no 
transaction fee if you deal directly with the mutual fund company. This can 
be a tremendous advantage, especially if you’re making frequent and regular 
investments into a fund. After you figure out what fund you want to buy, log 
on to the mutual fund company’s website, open an account, and buy it. You’ll 
save yourself some cash.
When opening an account with a mutual fund company to buy a mutual fund, 
be sure to open a mutual fund account, not a brokerage account. Several 
mutual fund companies, including Vanguard and Fidelity, offer brokerage 
accounts in addition to mutual fund accounts, and the fees are completely 
different.
Opening and Setting Up Your Account
After you’ve made the decision about which broker to go with, the hard 
work is done. All you need to do to get started is open an account and get 
your cash to the broker. You can do this online or through the mail. If you’re 
comfortable doing this online, which I imagine you are because you’re read-
ing Investing Online For Dummies, the online route is definitely the way to go 
because the cash can be transferred from your bank account and you can be 
up and running in a few hours or days. Signing up by mailing in a check and 
application, on the other hand, could take weeks.
Don’t be shocked by the seemingly endless number of questions you’ll be 
asked when setting up a new account. It’s common for the broker to ask for 
your social security number and other personal information. Given the sensi-
tivity of the information you’ll be sharing, that’s all the more reason to make 
sure that you understand online security by reading the previous sections.

118
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
The checklist of what you need to know
The biggest button on most broker’s website is the Open an Account or Start 
Now button, so you won’t have trouble finding it. Typically, that’s all you need 
to click to launch the area of the website that can set up your account. (If you 
want to sign up through the mail, click a link to download the necessary forms.)
Typically, you need to know three things to complete the application:
✓
✓The kind of account you want to create: This is usually a cash account 
or margin account. I cover margin accounts in more detail in Chapter 5.
✓
✓The number of people associated with this account: Is this just for you 
or for you and a spouse? This determines whether you create an indi-
vidual or joint account. You can review this in Chapter 3.
✓
✓The tax status of the account: Is this a taxable account or a tax‐deferred 
account, such as an IRA or a fund for college? You can review the differ-
ences in Chapter 3.
If you’re opening a retirement account, make sure the broker you’re consid-
ering doesn’t charge a monthly, quarterly, or annual maintenance fee. Most 
brokers waive maintenance fees if you’re opening an IRA account because 
they figure you’ll keep your money with them for quite some time. Many also 
waive the minimum deposits. For these reasons, if you’re just starting out 
with online investing, you might consider opening a retirement account first.
The checklist of what you need to have
You need these bits of info if you want to set up an account:
✓
✓Identification, such as a driver’s license or government‐issued ID card.
✓
✓A Social Security Number is necessary, of course. If you’re creating a joint 
account, you’ll also need the Social Security Number of the person you’re 
setting up the account with. This is used for tax‐reporting purposes.
✓
✓The bank statement of the financial institution from which you’ll 
transfer money. This contains the account and bank routing numbers 
you’ll need to instruct the broker to get your cash. Keep in mind that 
some brokers won’t let you open an account with electronically trans-
ferred money if you’re depositing less than $500. In those cases, you 
need to mail a check.
✓
✓The address of your employer if you’re an officer, director, or large 
shareholder of a publicly traded company.
See, that wasn’t hard. And here’s the best part: Now that you’ve entered all 
your information and funded your account, you’re all set to start investing.

A
 
ll the theory in the world about online investing won’t do you a bit of 
good if you can’t seal the deal and execute your trades. Trade execu-
tion is the process of logging on to your online broker and buying or selling 
investments. You might be wondering what’s so hard about buying a stock: 
Just log on to the online broker’s website and click the Buy button. And in 
some cases, you’re right. But sometimes you want to be a little more exact-
ing. You have ways to tailor your buys and sells so that your broker carries 
out the transaction precisely how you want it to be handled. For instance, 
you might want to buy a stock only if it falls below $25 a share, or you might 
want your broker to automatically sell shares if they fall below a certain 
price.
In this chapter, I start at the beginning and go over all the ways you can hold 
your stock and how that decision affects how your trades are executed. 
Then, I cover the main ways to enter orders — ranging from market orders 
to limit orders — and talk about the advantages and costs of each. For the 
adventurous types, this chapter examines buying investments using bor-
rowed money, called buying on margin, and also discusses the risks and 
returns of trading after hours. I then discuss the basics of options, which 
present unique ways for you to boost your returns or cut your losses, 
depending on how you use them.

Understanding How Stock Trades 
and Shares Are Handled
When you buy or sell a share of stock online, you click a few buttons and 
everything is done. In a few seconds, if even that long, you’ll often have a con-
firmation sitting in the messages section of your online broker’s website or in 
your email box. The confirmation is a memo that shows you what stock you 
bought or sold, the number of shares involved, and the price at which the 
trade was executed.
But perhaps unbeknownst to you, after you clicked the Buy button, your 
trade wiggled its way through countless computer networks where buyers 
and sellers competed for your order to buy stock until it was ultimately exe-
cuted, or filled. You might never need to know how this works, much like you 
might never need to know what’s going on under the hood of your car, but 
it’s an important part of investing online. So, the following sections describe 
a day in the life of a trade that’s on its way from being an order on your com-
puter screen to a done deal.
Ways you can hold your investments
The biggest factor that influences how your investments will actually make 
their way to Wall Street depends on how you hold your shares. The three 
main types are as follows:
✓
✓Street name ownership is the most common with most online brokers. 
It’s so common that unless you tell your online broker to do otherwise, 
your broker will assume that you want your shares owned in street name.
✓
✓Holding paper stock certificates is the old‐school way of owning stocks. 
It’s generally not a good idea for the reasons I outline in the section 
“Paper certificate ownership,” later in this chapter. If you insist on paper 
certificates, you just have to let your online broker know so that it can 
mail them to you. Generally, despite the few advantages, this isn’t a 
great idea.
✓
✓Direct registration is when the company that issues the stock holds 
your stock for you but lists you, not your broker, as the owner. If you buy 
stock through a direct stock purchase plan, as I discuss in Chapter 4, 
this is a common form of ownership.
Street name ownership
If you’re not sure how to hold your shares, street name ownership is prob-
ably your best bet. For most investors, the advantages of this form of owner-
ship outweigh the few negatives.

121

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
Shares kept in street name are listed on the books of the company in your 
broker’s name, not yours. The broker then lists you as the owner of the 
shares on its books. That might seem scary, I know, but you do have safe-
guards against broker fraud, as I describe in Chapter 4.
Street name ownership has several advantages:
✓
✓Easy handling of dividends: Dividends paid by companies you own 
stock in are sent directly to your online broker, which then deposits 
them to your account. For online investors used to doing almost every-
thing on a website, this is a huge advantage and saves you from having 
to deposit dividend checks in your bank’s ATM or mailing them to 
your broker.
✓
✓Central source of company documents: If you’re like most online inves-
tors, you probably own shares of several companies. When you own 
the stock in street name, all the paper correspondence sent out by the 
companies first goes to your broker. The broker then forwards it to you. 
This situation has a giant advantage, especially if you move often: You 
can just let your broker know where you live and not worry about miss-
ing important documents. If you’ve asked to only hear from companies 
electronically, rather than on paper, then your brokerage will email you 
links so you can read the materials.
Your broker can also help make sure that you get everything that’s due 
to you. Periodically, a company you invested in years ago is sued or 
forced by regulators to make payments to past investors. If you own the 
stock in street name, you can be certain to receive these old payments, 
even if you’re living somewhere else, because your broker will forward 
the checks.
✓
✓Security: It’s up to the brokerage to safeguard your stock. And that’s a 
good thing because getting paper stock certificates replaced, if you lose 
them, can be a hassle.
✓
✓Easy to sell: If your online broker has your shares on hand, you can sell 
them anytime you want without having to mail in a paper certificate 
first. That saves you time and postage, not to mention the worry about 
sending an important document through the mail.
Sounds great, right? But, street name ownership does come with a few 
­disadvantages:
✓
✓Potential delays in dividend payments: Some brokers are quicker about 
crediting dividends to your account than others. You might have to wait 
a few days to actually receive a dividend after it was paid by the com-
pany. Delays, however, are pretty rare now that much of these account-
ing matters are handled electronically.

122
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
✓
✓Hassle if your broker fails: Getting stock certificates transferred back 
to your name might be harder if your brokerage becomes insolvent. 
Some victims of the Bernie Madoff financial scam have found this out 
the hard way.
Paper certificate ownership
Maybe the cons of street ownership are enough to make you consider Route 
No. 2 — the paper certificate option. The advantages to paper certificate 
ownership include the following:
✓
✓Cutting out the middleman: Company materials come straight to you. 
This can reduce the time it takes to get some documents.
✓
✓Using certificates as loan collateral: When you have the actual cer-
tificates, you might have a little easier time using the stock value to 
secure a loan.
✓
✓Having actual certificates makes it easier to give them as gifts or for 
display: A paper certificate can be framed and given to young investors 
as a present. There’s something nice about having an item to wrap.
✓
✓Being in control: With the certificates in your possession, you know 
where they are and can decide who can have them.
In all honesty, though, I have to tell you that the main disadvantages to paper 
certificate ownership far outweigh the advantages. The disadvantages of 
paper certificate ownership include the following:
✓
✓Difficulty in selling: You might not be able to sell the stock as quickly 
as you’d like. Paper certificates must be mailed to your broker or to 
the company or a firm it hires to handle such matters so the stock can 
be sold. Nearly all online brokers charge significantly more to process 
paper certificates and strongly discourage investors from using them.
✓
✓Burden of keeping your contact information current with the com-
pany: It’s up to you to make sure that the company has your ­current  
address.
✓
✓Responsibility for safekeeping the certificates: It’s up to you to keep 
the paper certificates safe. You’ll probably have to spend money to get 
a safe deposit box or at least lock the paper stock certificates in your 
home somewhere. And when you send them through the mail, you will 
need to insure them in case they get lost. Some financial institutions rec-
ommend insuring mailed certificates for 2 percent of the market value, 
for reasons I explain later in this chapter.

If you decide to hold paper certificates rather than listing them in street 
name, don’t lose them. Getting lost paper certificates replaced can be a 
hassle and somewhat costly. If the unfortunate event does occur, though, 
here’s what to do to try to make it right:
1.	Call or email your broker or the company’s transfer agent and explain 
what happened.
Transfer agents are firms that companies hire to handle the processing 
of shares. The transfer agent will likely ask you to say how you lost the 
shares in a written report.
2.	Buy an indemnity bond with the help of your transfer agent.
An indemnity bond protects the company that issued the lost stock in 
case someone tries to cash it in later. Indemnity bonds usually cost up 
to 2 percent of the market value of the stock you lost.
For more details on what to do if you lose a stock certificate, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission maintains advice at www.sec.gov/answers/
lostcert.htm.
Direct registration
If all my talk about the hassles of losing paper certificates makes you long for 
another way of owning stock, you can always go for direct registration. You 
get several advantages from having direct registration, including
✓
✓Company correspondence coming straight to you
✓
✓Being able to sell shares without mailing certificates to your broker
✓
✓Not having to worry about keeping the certificates safe
Direct registration has two main downsides:
✓
✓Inability to sell shares immediately: Selling shares you hold in direct 
registration almost always takes longer than you might think. You may 
instruct the company to sell the shares, but your request is generally 
put into a pool and executed at set times in the future, such as later in 
the day, week, or month. You may also sell your shares by instructing 
the company’s transfer agent to electronically send the stock to your 
online broker. (A transfer agent is a firm hired by a company to track its 
shareholders and record transactions.) The transfer process can take 
a few days, so the price might change by the time you’re able to sell 
the stock.
✓
✓Pool of stock choices is somewhat reduced: Most companies offer 
direct registration, but not all. Many of the stocks you want to buy might 
not offer direct registration.

Buying paper stock certificates online
Because of the disadvantages listed elsewhere 
in this chapter, it doesn’t make much sense to 
hold paper stock certificates for the shares 
in your portfolio. Paper stock certificates, as 
a result, are quickly becoming extinct (some 
companies don’t even offer them). But the 
scarcity makes paper certificates even more 
attractive to some. A few investors still like to 
buy paper stock certificates for gifts. Yet other 
folks collect old stock certificates much like 
you’d collect stamps or coins. There’s even a 
word for the practice of collecting stock cer-
tificates: scripophily. If this interests you, check 
out these online services that let you buy paper 
stock certificates:
✓
✓GiveAShare (www.giveashare.
com) and Frame A Stock (http://
uniquestockgift.com) are single‐
share sales sites that understand the lost 
art and beauty of many stock certificates. 
Both let you buy a share of stock in 
companies which have certificates that are 
popular with individual investors. Both of 
these services even frame the certificates 
for you. The sites make it easy to find the 
perfect stock for the need. You can sort 
through the available certificates based 
on the occasion, recipient, or interest. For 
men, GiveAShare recommends Harley‐
Davidson and Boston Beer, and for women 
it suggests Tiffany and Starbucks. Some 
certificates are also popular because of 
the artwork on them, with Disney being the 
best example.
Just be forewarned that you’ll pay much 
more to acquire stock this way than 
through an online broker. In addition to the 
share price and framing fees, you also pay 
up to a $25 transfer agent fee to acquire 
the stock. A $38‐a‐share stock might easily 
cost more than $100 by the time all the fees 
are added.
✓
✓eBay (www.ebay.com), not surpris-
ingly, is a source for paper certificates. But 
because eBay isn’t licensed to sell securi-
ties like stocks, it has to be careful about 
what kinds of certificates its members 
sell; otherwise, eBay risks running afoul 
of securities law. Only two types of stock 
certificates may be sold on eBay. The first 
type concerns old or collectible certificates 
of defunct companies, such as old railroads 
or Internet companies. The other type that 
may be sold on eBay are single‐share stock 
certificates packaged as gifts and marked 
as being nontransferable. eBay requires 
that these certificates sell for at least twice 
the current market value of the stock as 
evidence that they’re priced based on their 
keepsake value.
✓
✓Certificate collection sites such as 
Scripophily.com (www.scripophily.
net) provide prices on some hard‐to‐find 
certificates. Even if you’re not a collector, 
it’s interesting to see what some of the 
certificates go for when they’re popular 
with collectors. Some Standard Oil stock 
certificates, personally signed by John D. 
Rockefeller, for instance, sell for $1,500 or 
more. Pixar stock certificates, decorated 
with characters from Toy Story like Buzz 
Lightyear, were a hot commodity when 
the company was bought by Disney. Old 
shares of Playboy were popular for their, 
um, artwork, because the company’s 
certificates used to display some, let’s say, 
assets. The old certificates have become 
even more sought after since Playboy’s 
new certificates were changed to be more 
PG. The old shares sell for $400 or more. 
And some infamous companies, like Enron, 
also have collectible value even though 
the companies themselves have largely 
vanished, as shown in the following figure.

A second in the life of a trade
When you buy or sell a stock on your online broker’s site, your order is usu-
ally filled in seconds. But, before that transaction is completed, in millisec-
onds your order snakes its way through an advanced security trading system 
that has taken decades to build. Just a few years ago, it could take about 12 
seconds for a trade to go from your desk to the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange and back. But now that most of the steps have been computerized, 
it takes less than a second. Using NASDAQ as an example, here’s what hap-
pens in the one second it takes to execute an online trade:
1.	You enter your order with your online broker.
2.	The order is placed in a database.
3.	The database checks all the different markets that trade the stock 
and looks for the best price. The different markets might include the 
NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange in addition to electronic commu-
nications networks (ECNs). ECNs are computerized networks that con-
nect buyers and sellers of stocks.

126
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
4.	The market that successfully matched the buyer and seller sends a con-
firmation to both parties’ brokers.
5.	The order and the price are reported to the regulatory bodies that over-
see trading activity so that they can be displayed to all investors.
6.	NASDAQ stores a record of the trade in case regulators want to study 
past transactions.
7.	NASDAQ sends a contract to the broker who sold the shares and the 
broker who bought them.
After all that is completed, the brokers have three days, called T+3, to actu-
ally exchange the cash and shares in a process called settlement. Then the 
money or shares are officially in your account.
ECNs: You have been assimilated
Back in the heyday of day trading in the late 1990s, many investors believed 
they could go toe to toe with the biggest trading houses in the world. That 
feeling stems from the creation of trading networks called ECNs and their 
approval by regulators in 1997. ECNs promised to level the trading field by 
letting individual investors trade directly with each other, rather than going 
through market makers on the NYSE or specialists on the NASDAQ. Market 
makers and specialists are middlemen of sorts. They’re traders that get 
special privileges to information in exchange for making sure that trading is 
going smoothly.
Several handfuls of ECNs cropped up to cut out the middlemen. The biggest 
were Instinet, Brut, and Archipelago. Day traders would sign up for these 
ECNs and trade with each other. But because ECNs were so efficient and fast 
at matching buyers and sellers, they also caught on with big institutional 
investors needing to move massive blocks of stock. ECNs got so popular that 
the exchanges began losing some trading volume. If you can’t beat them, buy 
them. The NYSE’s parent company, NYSE Euronext, bought Archipelago (now 
called NYSE ARCA) in 2005. NASDAQ bought Brut in September 2004 and in 
2005 acquired Inet, which was formed from the combination of Instinet with 
another ECN, called Island.
What does all this mean for online investors today? Now the distinction 
between the ECNs and the NYSE and NASDAQ is less, err, distinctive. Some 
ECNs have turned into full exchanges. BATS Global Markets started out as 
an ECN but converted into an exchange in 2008. Now BATS handles about 
a tenth of all daily trades. Traditional exchanges and these newer elec-
tronic trading venues are so closely tied that if you together enter a stock 
order online, your broker is required to check the prices everywhere to see 
whether that’s where it can get the best price. If you can get a better price 
through an electronic network rather than through a traditional exchange, 
that’s where your trade will occur. Some brokers let you choose where you 

127

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
want your order filled through something called direct routing. If your account 
is set up for direct routing, you can instruct the broker to execute the exchange 
or ECN of your choice, which is usually NYSE ARCA, Inet, or BATS.
Direct routing is a bad idea unless you’re a sophisticated online investor. 
Online brokers have computers that shop your order to all the top markets 
automatically. They’re required by regulators to get you the best available 
price. If you direct‐route your order, you lose this advantage and could wind 
up paying more.
Getting It Done: Executing Your Trades
If you’re buying something from a regular store, say a new computer, you can 
either buy it or not. End of discussion. But in more casual marketplaces, such 
as flea markets or garage sales, where prices are fluid and changing, there’s a 
strategy to buying and selling things. It might surprise you that buying stock 
is more like a flea market than shopping at your local Walmart, where prices 
are set. Because investments are priced in real time through active bidding 
between buyers and sellers, there are techniques to buying and selling.
Types of orders
When dealing with investments, you have five main ways to buy or sell 
them online:
✓
✓Market orders are the most common types of orders and the ones you 
will probably use the most. This is where you tell your broker to sell 
your shares at the best price someone is willing to pay right now or buy 
shares at the price currently being offered. Because these orders are 
executed almost immediately and are straightforward, they typically 
have the lowest commissions. (In Chapter 4, where I discuss different 
online brokers’ commissions, I concentrate on market orders because 
they’re the most common.)
✓
✓Limit orders let you be pickier about the price you’re willing to take for 
a stock you’re selling or the price you’re willing to pay if you’re buying. 
With a limit order, you tell your online broker the price you’re willing to 
take if you’re selling stocks and the price you’re willing to pay if you’re 
buying. The order will execute only if your price, or something better, 
is reached.
For example, imagine you own 100 shares of ABC Company, which are 
trading for $50 a share. The stock has been on a tear, but you’re con-
vinced it will fall dramatically soon, by your estimate to $30. You could 
just sell the stock outright with a market order, but you don’t want to 
because you’re a bit greedy and don’t want to miss out on any gains 

128
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
in case you’re wrong. A limit order could be the answer. Here, you’d 
instruct your broker to sell the stock if it fell to $45 a share. If you’re 
right, and the stock falls to $45 a share, your online broker will sell as 
many shares as possible at that price. You can also set a time limit on 
limit orders and tell your broker to let them expire after a few days or 
weeks. Limit orders can also protect you during market malfunctions. If 
there’s a flash crash — or a quick and dramatic drop in stock prices due 
to rapid‐fire trading — a limit order can save you from getting chewed 
up. Rather than entering a market order to sell (which would be exe-
cuted at a depressed price during a flash crash) putting in a limit order 
could avoid selling during the tumult.
The precision of limit orders can be a shortcoming, too. Limit orders are 
filled only at the price you set. If the stock falls further than the price 
you set, the broker might be able to sell only some of the shares, or 
none, at the price you set. If that happens, you’re stuck with the stock. In 
the preceding example, if ABC Company opened for trading and plunged 
straight to $25, never stopping at $45, you will still be holding the stock. 
This is a serious limitation that can give you a false sense of security.
✓
✓Stop market orders are similar to limit orders in that they let you set 
a price you want to buy or sell shares at. They have a very important 
difference, though, that addresses some of the shortcomings of limit 
orders. When a stock hits the price you designated, the order converts 
into a market order and executes immediately.
Imagine again that you have 100 shares of ABC Company, which are 
trading for $50 a share. But this time, you enter a stop market order for 
$45. And again, you wake up to find the stock plunged instantly to $25. 
This time, though, all your stock would have been sold. But, maybe not 
at $45. Your online broker will sell the shares at whatever the price was 
the moment your order converted to a market order, which in this case 
could have been $25.
✓
✓Stop limit orders are like stop market orders, but they’re designed to 
cure the danger that your shares will be blindly unloaded when a stock 
is moving. Stop limit orders are very customizable. First, you can set the 
activation price. When the activation price is hit, the order turns into a 
limit order with the limit price you’ve set.
Okay, ABC Company is trading for $50 a share when you enter a stop 
limit order with an activation price of $45 and a limit price of $35. It 
would work like this: Again, you wake up to find that the stock plunged 
instantly to $25. This time, your broker would turn your order into a 
limit order after it fell below $45. When the stock fell to $35, the broker 
would try to fill orders at that price if possible. Most likely, though, 
you’d still be stuck with shares. But unlike with the stop market order, 
you would not dump the shares when they fell as low as $25.

129

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
✓
✓Trailing stops are a way to keep up with the times. With regular limit 
orders, they’re either executed or they expire. Trailing stop orders get 
around this problem by letting you tell your broker to sell a stock if it 
falls by a certain number of points or a percentage.
If you’re buying and selling individual stocks, trailing stops can be a 
good idea. Even before you buy a stock, you should have an idea of how 
far you’ll let it fall before you cut your losses. Some investment profes-
sionals suggest never letting a stock fall more than 10 percent below 
the price you paid. If this sounds like a good idea to you, a trailing stop 
could work for you.
Costs of different orders
Market orders are the most straightforward orders, so it shouldn’t be that 
surprising that they’re also usually the least expensive. Limit orders, though, 
can help save investors from volatile markets. During the Flash Crash of 2010, 
prices of several stocks, including giants like Procter & Gamble, plummeted 
for about 15 minutes for no reason other than a system malfunction. Had you 
entered a market order to sell P&G during those 15 minutes, you would have 
sold at the current market price, which was 20 percent below where it was 
supposed to be. However, if you used a limit order that was close to the accu-
rate market price, your order would not have been executed. An increasing 
chorus of market experts are urging investors to use limit orders to protect 
themselves from such market malfunctions.
A few brokers charge extra for limit orders, so check the commission fees 
before you start trading.
Tailoring your trades even more
When you enter an order for a stock, you have a few other levers you can 
pull, including
✓
✓Designating lots: Many people buy the same stock many times. Each 
time you buy, that bundle of stock is called a lot. When you sell, your 
broker will assume you’d like to sell the lot that you’ve held for the 
longest time for recordkeeping purposes. This method, called first in, 
first out, or FIFO, is the standard and what the Internal Revenue Service 
expects. If, for tax reasons, you’d like to sell a specific lot that’s not the 
oldest, you can tell your broker which lot you’d like to sell.
✓
✓Setting time frames: You can enter an order for a stock that is active 
only for the day you place the trade. If it’s not filled — perhaps a limit 
order for the price you ask for isn’t reached — the order expires. That is 
called day only. You can also enter orders and let them stay active until 

130
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
you cancel them. That is called good till canceled. Good‐till‐canceled 
orders are generally active for up to six months after you enter the 
order, but that limit varies for each broker.
✓
✓Placing rules: When you issue an “all or none” restriction on your trade, 
your broker must completely fill the order or not fill it at all. Say you 
want to sell 100 shares of stock at a limit price of $45, but the broker can 
find buyers for only 10 shares at that price. If you stipulated all or none, 
none of your 100 shares would be sold.
Going off the Beaten Path with Different 
Trading Techniques
If all you could do was buy and sell investments, traders would get awfully 
bored. Investors looking for a little more excitement can dabble with some 
more advanced ways to enter online trades that go beyond everything I have 
discussed in this chapter so far. The most common ways to get a little fancier 
with your trades are
✓
✓Selling stock short: A way to make money even if a stock declines  
in value.
✓
✓Buying stock on margin: This method lets you bet big on a stock you 
think will go up. You borrow money to buy stock, which can magnify 
your returns if it rises in value.
✓
✓Trading after hours: Perfect for night‐owl investors who aren’t satis-
fied with the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST regular trading hours of the NYSE 
and NASDAQ.
Cashing in when stocks fall:  
Selling stock short
Most investors are pretty optimistic folks. When they go to a restaurant, see 
long lines, and enjoy the food, they rush home to buy stock in the company 
that owns the restaurant. These types of investors, who hope to profit from a 
company’s good times and rising profits, are called longs.
But there’s a whole other class of investors, called shorts, who do just the 
opposite. They search the Internet for news stories about diners getting food 
poisoning at a restaurant, for instance, and look for ways to cash in on the 
stock falling.

131

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
Investors looking to short a stock do it through four steps:
1.	They borrow the stock they want to bet against.
Short sellers contact their brokers to find shares of the stock they think 
will go down and they request to borrow the shares. The broker then 
locates another investor who owns the shares and borrows them with 
a promise to return the shares at a prearranged later date. The shares 
are then given to the short seller. Don’t think you’re getting to borrow 
the shares for nothing, though. You’ll have to pay fees or interest to the 
broker for the privilege.
2.	They immediately sell the shares they’ve borrowed.
The short sellers then pocket the cash from the sale.
3.	They wait for the stock to fall and then buy the shares back at the new, 
lower price.
4.	They return the shares to the brokerage they borrowed them from and 
pocket the difference.
Here’s an example: Shares of ABC Company are trading for $40 a share, 
which you think is way too high. You contact your broker, who finds 100 
shares from another investor and lets you borrow them. You sell the shares 
and pocket $4,000. Two weeks later, the company reports its CEO has been 
stealing money and the stock falls to $25 a share. You buy 100 shares of ABC 
Company for $2,500, give the shares back to the brokerage you borrowed 
them from, and pocket a $1,500 profit.
When you short a stock, you need to be aware of some extra costs. Most 
brokerages, for instance, charge fees or interest to borrow the stock. Also, if 
the company pays a dividend between the time you borrowed the stock and 
when you returned it, you must pay the dividend out of your pocket. You’re 
responsible for the dividend payment, even if you already sold the stock and 
didn’t receive it.
Tracking the short sellers
You might be interested to find out how many investors are shorting a stock 
you own, a statistic known as short interest. Some investors even incorporate 
tracking short interest in their strategies by seeking stocks that are heavily 
shorted, on the theory if the shorts are wrong the stock might surge higher 
in a short squeeze. A short squeeze is what happens when the short sellers 
get nervous that a stock they’re betting against will rise and they rush out 
and buy the stock back so that they can return it to the brokers they bor-
rowed it from. Short squeezes can cause a stock to skyrocket as the shorts 
buy shares.

132
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Exchanges release short interest data on stocks on the third Monday of each 
month. You can easily get the data online. A helpful source I’ve found is 
NASDAQ.com, shown in Figure 5‐1. You can look up the level of short interest 
on almost every stock, including those that trade on other exchanges such as 
the New York Stock Exchange. Here’s how:
1.	Point your browser to www.nasdaq.com.
2.	Enter the stock’s name or symbol in the Search field, and then either 
click the name of the company when it pops up or on the Search 
button.
3.	Choose Short Interest from the menu on the left side of the screen.
You see a detailed list that shows you the number of shares being 
shorted, as shown in Figure 5‐1. That number in itself doesn’t tell you 
much because different companies have different numbers of shares 
trading, or shares outstanding. So, to put the level of short interest in 
perspective, you also get to see the average daily share volume — the 
number of shares that usually trade hands in a given day. Lastly, you 
see days to cover, which is the number of days it would take, on average, 
for the number of shares that are being shorted to trade. Days to cover 
is calculated by dividing the number of shares shorted by the average 
daily share volume. The bottom line? The higher the days to cover, the 
greater the amount of real short interest in the stock.

Living on borrowed time:  
Buying stock on margin
The standard brokerage account is called a cash account. That’s where you 
deposit cold hard cash with the broker and use that pooled money to buy 
stocks. But when you set up your account, as I describe in Chapter 4, you can 
also request a margin account. This is an account type that lets you borrow 
money you can use to buy stocks.
Buying stock on margin isn’t for the faint of heart. Remember, if you borrow 
money, you must not only pay interest on that cash but also pay back the 
money you borrowed even if the stock goes down. Buying on margin is gener-
ally a good idea only if you’re a highly risk‐tolerant investor. You can deter-
mine your taste for risk by reading Chapter 1.
As is the case anytime you borrow to invest, buying stock on margin can 
boost your profit when you’re right and sting badly when you’re wrong. 
When you buy a stock that goes up, using margin, you can boost your 
returns. But if you bet wrong and buy one that goes down, margin magnifies 
your loss. To understand why, take a look at the following example.
Imagine buying 100 shares of a stock that goes from $15 a share to $32 a 
share. Your investment of $1,500 turns into $3,200. Assuming that you paid a 
$5 commission to buy and sell the stock, your rate of return, as explained in 
Chapter 1, is 112.3 percent and your profit is $1,690.
It’s calculated like this:
1.	Subtract the commission of $5 from the sale proceeds of $3,200. Write 
this down.
2.	Add the commission of $5 to the amount paid of $1,500. Write this 
down.
3.	Subtract the answer in Step 2 from the answer in Step 1 and divide 
that answer by the answer in Step 2. Multiply by 100.
That’s not bad. But if you bought on margin, your return would be even 
greater. Here’s what I mean. Say your broker has a 60 percent margin require-
ment, meaning that you must put up 60 cents of every $1 you invest. In this 
case, you’d have to put up $900 of your own cash because that’s 60 percent 
of the $1,500 purchase price. You then borrow the remaining $600 at 10 per-
cent interest. Your gain, thanks to margin, goes from 112.3 to 180 percent.

134
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
Here’s how your rate of return when using margin is calculated, using the 
previous facts as an example:
1.	Subtract the commission of $5 from the sale proceeds of $3,200.
Write this down: $3,195.
2.	Add the commission of $5 to the amount paid of $1,500.
Write this down: $1,505.
3.	Multiply the amount you borrowed, $600, by 0.10 to calculate the 
interest you owe.
You use 0.10 because that is 10 percent converted from percentage to 
decimal form. You get $60.
4.	Subtract the answer in Step 2 from the answer in Step 1.
Subtract that difference by the answer in Step 3. You get $1,630.
5.	Divide the answer in Step 4 by $905, which is the amount of your own 
money you put up plus the commission you paid to buy the stock.
Multiply by 100. The answer is 180.1 percent.
If the preceding is too much math for you, do it online. Most online brokers’ 
sites calculate your margin requirements. If you’re interested in buying on 
margin, make sure that the broker has margin‐tracking capabilities. Figure 5‐2 
shows Fidelity’s Margin Calculator.

The call you don’t want to get:  
The margin call
Most online brokers require investors to maintain a certain percentage of 
ownership of stocks relative to what has been borrowed. This is called the 
maintenance margin, and it’s typically 30 percent or higher at most firms. If 
a stock rises, this isn’t a problem because the value of the loan becomes a 
smaller slice of the position. But if the stock falls in value, the shareholder’s 
stake shrinks. If it falls below 30 percent, the broker requires the investor to 
put up more cash, or the shares will be sold.
Imagine that, when you bought the previous $15‐a‐share stock, you borrowed 
40 percent or $6 a share, meaning that your ownership stake is $9 a share 
or 60 percent. But say the stock falls to $7 a share. Because you borrowed 
$6 a share, you own only $1 of the $7‐a‐share price. That means you own just 
14 percent of the stock, violating the 30 percent margin requirement.
If you still have questions about investing on margin, Dummies.com provides 
an easy‐to‐follow description of margin at www.dummies.com/how‐to/
content/buying‐stock‐on‐margin.html.
Some online brokers can crunch the numbers for you automatically and let 
you know when margin calls will kick in. And you can be certain that online 
brokers won’t waste any time contacting you for a margin call. But if the pre-
ceding math seems too complicated to do yourself, you might want to steer 
clear of using margin.
The nightshift: Trading in the  
extended hours
One of the great things about stocks and bonds is they’re usually easy to sell. 
Unlike real estate, which usually requires hiring a Realtor who sprinkles air 
freshener through the house and invites prospective buyers to an open house, 
you can sell stocks pretty much instantly. The main stock exchanges are open 
every business day, for regular trading hours, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., EST.
But thanks to electronic trading networks, discussed previously in the “ECNS: 
You have been assimilated” section above, you can trade before 9:30 a.m. in 
what’s called premarket trading and after 4 p.m. in after‐hours trading. Here are 
several reasons why some investors pay attention to after‐hours trading:
✓
✓A chance to react to late‐breaking news: Some active traders believe 
they can use after‐hours trading as a way to profit from news companies 
that might report after the close. It’s common for companies to release 
important information, either good or bad, after 4 p.m. to give investors 

136
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
time to digest. But investors don’t have to wait and can place trades 
after hours.
✓
✓An indication of how late‐breaking news might affect the stock when 
regular trading hours begin: You don’t have to be a high‐profile online 
trader to get access to after‐hours quotes. Most online financial websites 
discussed in Chapter 2, including Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.
yahoo.com) as well as search engines like Bing (www.bing.com), let 
you see how stocks and indexes are trading in the after hours. Many of 
those sites — as well as Google Finance (http://finance.google.
com) — also show you the after‐hours volume, which is the number of 
shares trading hands. Volume is very important when looking at after‐
hours trading because the more shares that are trading hands, the more 
reliable the price is.
Trading after hours isn’t a good idea for most online investors for several  
reasons:
✓
✓Lower participation: Fewer buyers and sellers participate in after‐hours 
trading, so there’s a chance you’ll get a lower price for a stock you’re 
selling or pay more for a stock you’re buying than had you waited for 
regular trading to begin. After‐hours trading attracts very little interest. 
Only about 1 percent of the trades placed each day on the NYSE are con-
ducted after hours.
✓
✓Limit orders are required: Most online brokers accept after‐hours 
trades only if they’re entered as limit orders. Limit orders present their 
own shortcomings, as explained in the “Types of orders” section, earlier 
in the chapter.
✓
✓Unpredictable pricing: Sometimes stock prices set in the after hours 
aren’t necessarily harbingers for how things will open the next day. 
They can be a poor indicator of the next day’s trading if the after‐hours 
volume is low.
Knowing Your Options: Basic  
Ways to Best Use Options
If you’ve ever put down a deposit so that someone would hold something for  
you, you know what an option is. For instance, you might pay a landlord a $100 
nonrefundable deposit to hold an apartment so that it’ll be ­available for you if 
you decide to rent it. If you don’t rent the apartment, you’re out the $100.
Options are the financial version of that idea. If you own an option, you 
have the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an investment, includ-
ing shares of stock by a certain preset time in the future. Options can be 

137

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
extremely powerful in the right hands, and they can either help you boost 
your returns or reduce your risk, depending on how you use them.
I often describe options as the financial version of dynamite. If used pru-
dently and safely, options can remove perils in the way of your financial 
goals. But if abused, misunderstood, or used recklessly, options can blow 
your financial plan to smithereens.
When you own an option, you have the power to make someone follow 
through on a trade for an underlying asset, such as a stock, no matter what 
happens to the price. Options expire on the third Friday of every month.
Need an example? Say that ABC Company’s stock is currently trading for $30 
a share, and you own an option to buy it for $20 a share on its expiration date 
in one month. That option is worth $10 a share, the difference between $30 
and $20, which is its intrinsic value. If you own an option like this that lets you 
buy a stock for less than its current value, it’s in the money. But if the price 
you can buy the stock at, known as the exercise price, is higher than the cur-
rent price, the option is out of the money.
The different types of options
Option strategies can get pretty complex. If you’re serious about trading 
them, you can find out all the gory details in Trading Options For Dummies, by 
Joe Duarte (published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). But I’m perfectly willing to 
give you the basics.
Two types of options exist:
✓
✓Calls give their owners the right to buy a stock at a certain price (called 
the exercise or strike price) at a certain time (called the expiration date) 
in the future. One call contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares of 
the underlying stock.
✓
✓Puts give their owners the right to sell a stock at a certain price at a 
­certain time in the future. One put contract gives you the right to sell 
100 shares of the underlying stock.
Basic options strategies
The real beauty of both call and put options kicks in because you can either 
buy or sell them to other investors. That gives you four distinct strategies:
✓
✓Buying a call: When you buy a call, you have the right to force some-
one to sell you the stock at the exercise price you agreed upon ahead 
of time. You make money on a call when the stock price rises above the 

138
Part I: Getting Started Investing Online 
exercise price. This strategy is for investors who are convinced a stock 
will rise and want to bet big. Buying a call isn’t free. You must pay the 
seller for the option, in what’s called the premium.
Nothing says you must exercise an option. But, not exercising an option 
that’s worth something would be foolish. So foolish, in fact, that most 
online brokers will automatically exercise options that are worth some-
thing, or in the money.
✓
✓Selling a call: When you sell a call, you’re on the other side of the option 
strategy of buying a call. You get paid the premium and pocket the 
money. And it gets better: If the stock falls, you keep that money free 
and clear. But if the stock rises, you’re in trouble because you’ve agreed 
to sell the stock for the lower price. If you don’t already own the stock, 
you’re what’s called naked. That means you’ll have to go out and buy the 
stock you’ve already sold, no matter the price.
Buying trouble by buying calls
Buying calls is the best way to maximize 
returns if a stock is about to go up. And that’s 
why they’re perfect tools for investors who use 
illegal insider information about stocks for per-
sonal gain. Illegal insider information is impor-
tant information the public doesn’t know about 
yet but will move the stock when the news gets 
out. It’s illegal to trade using important and con-
fidential information you got from working for 
a company or being connected to people with 
such secret information. For just a little cash, 
these investors can post giant gains when the 
market‐moving news — news they already 
know about — hits the market.
Regulators are aware of this, too, though. 
Options activity is one of the first things the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
looks into following a big move of a stock, 
especially on news that a company is being 
acquired. A classic case came in August 
2005, when the SEC uncovered a ring of nine 
investors who allegedly made more than 
$6 million in illegal profits largely by buying call 
options ahead of the August 3 announcement 
that athletic apparel maker Adidas was buying 
Reebok. The case included lurid details of the 
illegal traders meeting with an exotic dancer 
to exchange tips as well as secret meetings 
inside Russian spas. A few members of the 
ring worked for investment banks and knew 
the deal was coming, giving them time to make 
the options trades. You can read all about it in 
one of the SEC’s complaints at http://sec.
gov/litigation/complaints/2006/
comp19775.pdf. Another high‐profile 
example came in 2011 connected with Walt 
Disney’s purchase of comic book empire: 
Marvel Entertainment. The SEC accused 
an individual of investing in call options on 
Marvel’s stock in 2009 based on a tip from a 
girlfriend who worked at Disney, and gaining 
3,000 percent on the allegedly illegally obtained 
information (www.sec.gov/news/
press/2011/2011‐166.htm).

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
You should never sell a call unless you know what you’re doing. If you 
sell a call and don’t own the underlying stock, that’s called writing a 
naked call. If the stock rises, your losses are unlimited because in theory 
the stock could rise hundreds of points.
If a call sounds like something you’d like to trade, here are places online 
where you can find out more:
•	The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Options Institute (www.
cboe.com/LearnCenter/cboeeducation/Course_01_02/
mod_02_01.aspx)
•	The Options Guide (www.theoptionsguide.com/call‐option.
aspx)
✓
✓Buying a put: When you buy a put, you have the right to make some-
one buy a stock from you for a prearranged price. You’re betting that 
the price of the underlying stock will fall. And like buying a call, it lets 
you make a big gamble with little up‐front money. It’s another way to 
bet against a stock, similar to shorting a stock, as described earlier in 
this chapter.
✓
✓Selling a put: This strategy places you on the other side of the person 
who is buying the put. When you sell a put, you’re usually betting that 
the price of the underlying stock will rise. But you might also sell a put 
if you’re willing to buy the stock at the current price but think it might 
go lower in the short term. That way, if the stock does fall, you must buy 
the stock at the higher exercise price but get to keep the premium.
Selling a put can be extremely risky. If the stock falls, you keep losing 
money until it hits $0. Don’t sell a put unless you know exactly what 
you’re doing.

how they work.

How to get option prices online
Most of the leading stock quote sites provide options prices. They’re usu-
ally called options chains because they show data on options for many 
exercise prices and for different expiration dates. Two helpful places to get 
options chains are NASDAQ.com (www.nasdaq.com) and Yahoo! Finance 
(http://finance.yahoo.com). Options quotes are also provided by most 
online brokers.
No matter where you look up options chains online, most providers give you 
a chart with the same basic information, including
✓
✓Premiums (or prices) of both call and put options at all price levels: 
The bid is how much you will get for selling the option, and the ask is 
how much you’d pay to buy one.
✓
✓Volume: This shows you how many contracts are being bought and sold.
✓
✓In the money and out of the money: You can see which options are in 
the money and which are out of the money. Remember, a call option is 
in the money if the stock price is higher than the option’s strike price. 
A call option is out of the money if the strike price is higher than the 
stock’s price.
✓
✓Prices for different dates: You can see how much options with different 
expiration dates are trading for.
✓
✓The trading symbol of the option: Stocks have ticker symbols, which 
are abbreviations to help investors communicate with each other and 
brokers. Options also have symbols that serve the same purpose. For 
more than 25 years, options had five‐letter symbols. But that changed in 
Insurance to protect you from losing money 
­investing online
You can buy insurance to cover yourself in case 
your house burns down or your car is stolen. 
But what about your online stock portfolio? 
Can you buy insurance to protect yourself from 
losing a catastrophic amount of money from 
investing online? Yes, you can, but instead of 
buying a policy from an insurance company, 
you can buy a put option.
Buying a put is normally a way to bet against 
a stock. But if you buy a put for a stock you 
already own, you have what’s called a pro-
tective put. Say you own 100 shares of ABC 
Company. The stock is trading for $30 a share, 
and you’re worried about a market meltdown. 
You can buy a put that would give you the right 
to sell ABC Company for $30. Even if the stock 
crashes and falls to $15 a share, you can still 
sell it for $30. You’ve essentially bought cata-
strophic insurance.

141

 Chapter 5: Getting It Done: How to Enter and Execute Trades
2010 when the Options Clearing Corporation, which handles the behind‐
the‐scenes processing of options, changed the way options are given 
symbols. Now, options symbols have four sets of data in a long string 
of letters and numbers. First you’ll see the security’s ticker symbol, 
say IBM. Next, comes the expiration date, followed by the strike price, 
and then a letter p or c, depending on whether it is a put or call option. 
Fidelity provides an in‐depth description of these symbols for all inves-
tors, not just Fidelity customers (http://personal.fidelity.com/
research/options/osi.shtml).
How to buy options online
Most of the mainstream online brokers allow you to buy and sell options. 
Some of the brokers are specialists with options and can help you calculate 
your gains and losses. Those specialty firms are listed in Chapter 4. You also 
need to pay a commission to buy or sell options, just as you pay to buy or 
sell stocks. The fees vary by broker. Table 5‐2 lists a few examples.
Entering an option order is very similar to placing a trade for a stock. You 
must follow these steps:
1.	Go to the option‐trading section of the online broker’s site.
2.	Enter an order to buy or sell a call or put option.
3.	Enter the number of contracts you want to trade.
One options contract controls 100 shares of the stock.
4.	Enter the option contract symbol.
5.	Select an order type, such as a limit or market order.
For more on limit and market orders, see the “Types of orders” section, 
earlier in the chapter.

Discovering more about options online
Options aren’t complicated, but they can be a little bewildering to novices. 
You need to make absolutely certain that you know what you’re doing before 
trying to play with options. These online resources can help:
✓
✓Your broker’s website: Most brokers have an education section, where 
options are explained in detail. Brokerages that specialize in options, 
like TradeKing (www.tradeking.com), have very comprehensive tuto-
rial information.
✓
✓The International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com): This options 
exchange provides great options tutorials. Just click the Education 
option under the Options tab. From the Education page, you’ll see a list 
of available tutorials, simulators, and calculators.
✓
✓The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Options Institute (www.
cboe.com/LearnCenter/Default.aspx): Online tutorials, courses, 
and educational webcasts step you through the options process before 
you risk inflicting some major damage on your portfolio. You can also 
find an OptionQuest game that attempts to make options fun. You can 
see the kinds of options tutorials CBOE provides in Figure 5‐3.
✓
✓The Options Industry Council (www.optionseducation.org/en.

nvestors often wonder why bad things can happen to shares of “good 
companies.” It’s common for a company to report seemingly solid news, 
like sharply higher profit, and its stock will fall anyway. It doesn’t seem right 
to many investors. This chapter answers the burning question you and many 
investors might have: “Why do stocks rise and fall?” It’s a two‐part answer 
because one set of forces causes stocks to move in the short term, and 
another set influences stock prices in the long term. I explain what moves 
stocks and show you online tools that can help you track market‐moving 
events.
How Stocks Get into the Public’s Hands
If you’ve ever seen the screen of a stock trader’s computer, on most days, it 
looks like a Christmas tree. Ticker symbols are flashing red and green, indi-
cating that stock prices are moving up and down during the day. But why are 
the stocks moving up and down so much? To understand that, it’s helpful to 
see how and why companies decide to sell stock to the public, allowing you 
to become an online investor. The following sections take a look at how the 
process works.

146
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
Step 1: An idea becomes a company
Clever entrepreneurs with an idea for a product or service form a ­company. 
Young companies usually pay for the equipment and materials they need 
by using private money. Let me clarify: They use their money. But, if it’s a 
promising concept that could sell on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs might 
hit up venture capital (VC) investors for cash. VCs are specialized ­investors 
who buy stakes in very young companies, most of which will fail, on the 
hope they hit just one future Facebook or Google and make a bundle. 
You can track trends in the VC industry at The National Venture Capital 
Association (www.nvca.org) and PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ MoneyTree 
Report (www.pwcmoneytree.com).
When a company finally sells its shares to the public in an initial public 
offering, you can see which VC firms were investors in the prospectus. The 
prospectus is a legal document that explains everything about the ­company 
selling shares to the public. You can find out how to access an IPO’s 
­prospectus in Bonus Chapter 2 on the website associated with this book.
Step 2: The company expands and grows
If the entrepreneur’s hunch is right and a demand exists for what the com-
pany sells, the business takes off. At this point, the company needs more 
money to grow. The company might remain private by finding large institu-
tional investors, like pension funds, insurance companies, or companies that 
invest in private companies. These private placement investments aren’t typi-
cally open to online investors. Private placements are very selective sales of 
investments usually to a small and savvy group of money managers, such as 
the aforementioned pension funds or insurance companies.
But the Internet is quickly changing who can get in on buying ownership 
pieces of these nascent companies. The key ways companies find public 
investors for ownership — before hitting the big exchanges — include
✓
✓Direct public offerings. Some private companies choose to raise money 
through direct public offerings (also known as DPOs) so that they can 
sell their private stock to their customers, who may end up being more 
patient than Wall Street. In a DPO, the companies raise money directly 
from investors instead of lining up a broker to dole out the shares. The 
regulatory hurdles are much lower with DPOs than with other forms of 
selling ownership to the public. You can read more about DPOs at Drew 
Field Direct Public Offerings (www.dfdpo.com), which is trying to allow 
more regular people to invest in private companies.
Although some direct public offerings might work out, they’re highly 
risky and are only for investors willing to lose their entire investment.

147

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
✓
✓Pre‐IPO stock marketplaces: Sites like SharesPost (www.sharespost.
com) and SecondMarket (www.secondmarket.com) are attempting to 
give investors a chance to buy shares of companies while the companies 
are still private. You can buy shares from other investors who own the 
shares, usually employees or founders of the companies. There are strict 
rules on who can use these sites, though, as a buyer must be ­considered 
an accredited investor. Just to give you an idea, the SEC describes accred-
ited investors as individuals with a net worth of more than $1 million 
or an annual income of $200,000 or more. These private exchanges are 
trying to broaden their appeal. SharesPost, for example, launched a 
mutual fund that allows investors to invest as little as $2,500 in a basket 
of companies that have not yet sold stock to the broad public.
✓
✓Equity crowdfunding sites: If you’ve used sites like Kickstarter, you 
have a pretty good idea about how crowdfunding works. The idea is that 
if lots of people donate a small sum to an inventor with an idea (but 
not enough money), the total amount can finance the development of 
the concept. Kickstarter contributions, though, are essentially dona-
tions. Equity crowdfunding looks to take this idea further by allowing 
the masses to buy small slices of ownership in very young companies. 
The rules allowing such financing to happen were just approved by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015, so it’s still very early. 
Some of the early players include OneVest.com, SeedInvest.com, and 
EquityNet.com. You can read the nitty gritty of the rules passed by the 
SEC here: www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015‐49.html.
Companies joining the crowd: Crowdfunding
Very young companies and entrepreneurs 
trying to raise money from the public have 
complained that the cost and regulations have 
made it onerous. The Jumpstart Our Business 
Startups Act, or JOBS Act, was signed into law 
on April 5, 2012 to address these complaints. 
The law includes a provision that loosens 
regulations surrounding companies looking to 
sell up to $1 million in securities to investors, 
in what’s called crowdfunding. Crowdfunding 
is when a person or group of people with an 
idea for a business promotes it, usually online, 
and attracts financial backers to contribute 
money to the project. Crowdfunding as a way 
for companies to raise money from investors is 
the next evolution of this online phenomenon. 
Originally, crowdfunding was a way for artists 
and philanthropists to raise money from back-
ers to fund pet projects. But over time, sites like 
Kickstarter.com (www.kickstarter.com) 
have increasingly been used by entrepreneurs 
to get financial backing for new products or 
services, not as owners, but as early custom-
ers. The JOBS Act will open up crowdfunding 
as a way for companies to raise money from 
investors, too. It’s still a very early concept and 
the risks and rewards aren’t clearly understood 
yet. It’s definitely something to watch. You can 
read what the SEC says about what crowdfund-
ing means for investors here: www.sec.gov/
divisions/marketreg/tmjobsact‐
crowdfundingintermediariesfaq.
htm.

148
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
Step 3: The company goes public
To raise money, the company sells a fraction of itself in an initial public 
offering, or IPO. The shares are first sold mostly to large institutional inves-
tors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and investment banks at the IPO 
price. When the large institutions and other initial investors sell their shares, 
they’re available for you to buy online. I cover IPOs in more detail in Bonus 
Chapter 2 on the website associated with this book, but great places to start 
researching IPOs include
✓
✓Renaissance Capital’s IPO Home (www.renaissancecapital.com/
IPOHome/Marketwatch.aspx) maintains all sorts of statistics about 
IPOs, ranging from how many there are to how well they do. You can 
also find research about upcoming IPOs and read their prospectuses.
✓
✓IPO Desktop Premium (www.ipopremium.com) provides detailed infor-
mation on the types of companies that are coming public as well as links 
to expert commentary on the deals.
✓
✓IPOScoop.com (www.iposcoop.com) is a collection of data and 
commentary about the IPO market from long‐time IPO expert John 
Fitzgibbon. You’ll find what companies have sold stock to the public and 
how the shares are performing.
Step 4: The new shares trade
After the IPO shares get into the hands of investors, the investors are free to 
buy and sell them at will on the exchanges. If you have a broker, as I describe 
in Chapter 4, you’re free to participate and bid for stocks you want to buy. 
After you buy, you can sell.
This constant buying and selling of shares creates a dynamic way to deter-
mine stock prices. The process of how shares trade hands on the exchanges 
is described at length in Chapter 5.
Why Stocks Move Up and  
Down in the Short Term
Shares of large companies generally gain about 10 percent a year on average, 
as I explain in Chapter 1. But getting there is far from a smooth ride. The ups 
and downs can be vicious as investors react to different news and corporate 
developments that trickle out randomly.

149

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
Stock prices are volatile in the short term because investors can either worry 
about or get excited about countless things. Stock prices reflect what inves-
tors know and expect from the company. But stock prices change the second 
there’s a bit of unexpected news that changes investors’ outlook for the 
stock. Investors instantly react to any news about the company, including the 
following:
✓
✓Movement by the rest of the stock market: If the entire market goes up 
or down, most stocks move in the same direction.
✓
✓Earnings reports: Such reports are released quarterly by companies to 
give investors a status report on the business. Investors usually react 
quickly and intensely to these reports.
✓
✓Industry developments: What’s happening to the industry as a whole 
can affect every company in the field. If one company, for instance, cre-
ates a new product that makes rivals’ offerings obsolete, a swift reaction 
can occur.
✓
✓Management changes: Who gets hired and fired at the top can be criti-
cal because such moves might signal a turn in the company’s direction 
or a power struggle in the executive suite.
✓
✓Raw materials: Changes in the price of raw materials can significantly 
affect companies that must buy basic ingredients to make their prod-
ucts. Higher raw material costs must be passed on to the company’s 
consumer, or profits will suffer.
✓
✓Trading momentum: When a certain stock gets its mojo going, it might 
seem as if there’s no stopping it. Many times, companies become dar-
lings with investors and can enjoy big rallies as everyone piles in.
✓
✓Merger chatter: When the buzz tells you that a corporate wedding is in 
the offing, that can be market‐moving information because companies 
are usually bought out for a premium to the existing share price.
✓
✓Bond yields: The yield on bonds determines how much stocks are worth 
to investors, so a move in yields has a swift effect on stocks.
✓
✓Economic reports: Official pronouncements about the state of the 
economy, including changes in short‐term interest rates by the Fed, help 
investors decide whether they want to own stocks at the time.
✓
✓Legal insider buying or selling: When corporate executives are doing a 
lot of buying or selling of their company’s stock, that’s worth watching 
closely. When the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) is buying, for 
example, investors assume that he knows what he’s doing and might 
want to go along for the ride. (Don’t confuse legal insider trading with 
illegal insider selling, which I discuss in Chapter 5. Illegal insider trading 
occurs when anyone with special connections to the company, including 
the management, uses important information not known by the public to 
unfairly make a profit.)

The preceding list just gives you a taste of all the things that can cause a 
stock that you own to go up or down. In the following sections, I expand on 
a few of these things and show you places online where you can track them 
insofar as they pertain to investments in your portfolio.
Tracking the market’s every move
Perhaps the biggest factor in the short‐term moves of stocks is the direction 
of the broader market. Investors generally watch stock market indexes — 
tools that track a basket of stocks — to find out what the market is doing. 
Popular indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor’s 
500 index, and the NASDAQ Composite index. You can find out how to track 
these indexes online in Chapter 2. Monitoring the broad market is telling 
because when market indexes are falling, it’s not uncommon for investors to 
dump all stocks, including those of companies that are doing well. Traders 
describe this phenomenon with an old cliché: “Investors are throwing the 
baby out with the bathwater.”
Getting in tune with earnings reports
Your stock’s ultimate value will be determined by how profitable the com-
pany is in the long term. But even the best market forecasters are unable to 
measure a company’s profits 10 years in the future, much less in 20 years. 
So, investors tend to overcompensate for their lack of long‐term vision by 
focusing on how companies are doing in the short term. Earnings reports tell 
you how much the company made during the quarter. Earnings reports also 
contain all the vital financial results for the quarter, including the net income 
(or total profit) as well as earnings per share, which is how much of the com-
pany’s profit you can lay claim to as a shareholder.
Investors and online databases usually use the shorthand term EPS when 
referring to earnings per share. If you see the abbreviation EPS TTM, that 
means earnings per share over the trailing, or past, 12 months.
All public companies that trade on major exchanges, such as the New York 
Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, are required to tell investors how they did 
during the quarter. These earnings reports can be incredibly important to 
investors in the short term. But stocks that trade on other markets, including 
the Pink Sheets, are often not required to make these important disclosures, 
adding a great deal of risk if you choose to invest in them. You can read more 
about the risks of investing in stocks listed on the Pink Sheets in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
Getting the goods
Here are several ways to get your hands on earnings reports the second 
they’re released:
✓
✓Financial news websites: Nearly all the financial news sites described 
in Chapter 2, including Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) 
and USA TODAY (www.usatoday.com/money), provide the earnings 
reports directly from the companies as soon as they’re published.
Earnings releases are easy to find because in the list of news stories, 
they’re usually tagged as being from one of two sources: PR Newswire 
(www.prnewswire.com) or Business Wire (www.businesswire.com). 
These reports are very formal and written in almost legalese language. 
They describe how the companies did, in exhaustive detail, and provide 
the quarterly financial statements. (I cover how to analyze financial 
statements in more detail in Chapter 12.)
If you don’t want to take the time to pick apart the company releases, 
look for earnings stories written by the wire services, such as Reuters 
and The Associated Press. These stories are analyzed by reporters 
trained to look for the important things and put their findings in plain 
English. Wire stories are also available on most financial news sites.
✓
✓Press release distribution services: Most companies hire one of two 
companies — either PR Newswire or Business Wire, mentioned in the 
preceding bullet — to electronically distribute their earnings press 
releases. Both these sites let you search press releases that might have 
been released by different companies.
✓
✓The regulators: You can get earnings reports, called 10‐Qs, directly from 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov). The 10‐Qs 
are the official reports, so they usually take a few weeks to be released 
following the end of the quarter. Prior to that, the company must file an 
8‐K report stating that it put out a press release with quarterly earnings 
information. If you’re interested in getting the information this way, I 
show you how to do that in Chapter 2. You can find out how to dig into 
a company’s regulatory filings in one of my other books, Fundamental 
Analysis For Dummies (published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
✓
✓Earnings calendars: Earnings calendars like the one maintained by 
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com/earnings/earnings‐ 
calendar.aspx) let you see what companies have reported their 
­earnings most recently. You can also see which companies are due to 
report their earnings. For some companies, you can also read brief 
­comments by Morningstar analysts on what investors should look for 
in the reports. (Figure 6‐1 shows you what the Morningstar earnings 
calendar looks like.) Other sites maintain solid earnings calendars, too, 
including Yahoo! Finance’s earnings calendar at http://biz.yahoo.
com/research/earncal/today.html and Bloomberg at http://
www.bloomberg.com/apps/ecal?c=US.

Stocks often react immediately to the release of earnings statements by com-
panies. However, you might be surprised at the counterintuitive reactions 
such news sometimes provokes. This can be one of the greatest riddles on 
Wall Street, and it reveals just how deeply investors pick apart everything 
a company says to determine the price of the stock. Oftentimes, a company 
will release sharply higher earnings, but the stock will fall. Pure perversity? 
An Alice‐in‐Wonderland kind of world? Not necessarily. It’s just a compli-
cated world, as the next section makes clear. (Hey, if it were easy, everybody 
would be rich.)
What’s so important about earnings reports?
To get into the heads of short‐term investors and understand how they read 
quarterly earnings statements, ask yourself the following questions:
✓
✓Were the company’s results better than expected? When a company 
releases its earnings per share, investors instantly compare those 
results to what Wall Street analysts who follow the stock expected. Even 
if a company’s EPS is just a penny short of expectations, the stock can 
get punished. But the stock can fall even if earnings per share are up, if 
they are not up as much as analysts expected. How do you find out how 
much the analysts thought the company would earn?
Figure 6-1:

­companies

earnings, 
but it also

the results.


 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
•	Financial wire stories: Most of the wire stories from financial web-
sites contain figures that detail what analysts were expecting and 
describe how the actual results compared with said expectations. 
Stories from the Associated Press, Reuters, and Bloomberg are 
especially good about this.
•	Zacks Investment Research’s earnings surprise summary (www.
zacks.com/research/earnings/today_eps.php): Here you 
can see how much analysts were expecting companies to earn and 
whether the actual results were a positive surprise or a negative 
surprise. Morningstar’s and Bloomberg’s earnings calendars also 
show what analysts expected companies to earn.
Yahoo! Finance also has an entire section dedicated to tracking the 
analysts. Just enter the stock’s ticker symbol in the Quote Lookup 
box on the left‐hand side of the screen. Click the company’s name 
to get the summary information. Click the Analyst Opinion and 
Analyst Estimates links on the left‐hand side of the page.
When looking up analysts’ expectations for earnings, be sure to find out 
how many analysts cover the stock and how many have provided an 
earnings estimate. If three or more analysts are on the stock, the esti-
mate is more meaningful than if there’s only one.
✓
✓What did the company say about the future? What the company says 
about the just‐completed quarter is practically ancient history. Investors 
spent all quarter anticipating the results and are usually pretty close in 
their estimates. But sometimes a company drops a bomb in its press 
release regarding what it expects in the future. Usually, though, com-
panies make comments about the future in so‐called investor confer-
ence calls — scheduled teleconferences between Wall Street analysts 
and other investors with the company’s top brass, where management 
discusses how the quarter went and what it expects to happen in 
the future.
You’re not likely to be on the To Call list for such investor conference 
calls, but you can still get the highlights from these calls from wire sto-
ries or earnings news stories. And, if you’re really curious, you can often 
access such investor conference calls yourself online from a variety of 
sources, including
•	The company’s website: Start here. You can usually find an Investor 
Relations link that you can use to access the feed for earnings 
calls. Most companies let you click a link to hear the calls as 
they’re being made, and many rebroadcast the call for 24 hours 
after it occurred.

154
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
•	Financial news sites: The major sites provide calendars of ­upcoming 
conference calls as well as the audio broadcasts from the calls 
themselves. Yahoo! Finance (http://biz.yahoo.com/cc) 
­provides a calendar of company conference calls and lets you 
listen to some as they’re ongoing and some that are over. Briefing.
com (www.briefing.com) offers a similar service under the 
Conference Calls option under the Calendar tab. Briefing.com 
requires a subscription to listen to some of the conference calls. 
Reuters presents a list of what conference calls are coming up: 
www.reuters.com/finance/markets/conferenceCalls? 
country=USA&viewBy=type.
•	Seeking Alpha (http://seekingalpha.com/tag/transcripts) 
provides text transcripts of conference calls, which are handy 
because you can skim them without listening to a CEO drone on 
for an hour. The site also provides a calendar of companies with 
upcoming conference calls.
✓
✓Are analysts changing their opinions on the company? The minute 
a company releases earnings, Wall Street analysts are already ­picking 
the results apart. They’re looking for anything that changes their 
­expectations for the company. Analysts publish their opinions on 
stocks in analyst reports, which I show you how to read and interpret 
in Chapter 15. But, for quick ways to find out whether analysts are 
­changing their expectations, here are some sources:
•	Zacks Investment Research (www.zacks.com) closely tracks 
­analysts’ opinions of stocks. If analysts change their opinion on a 
stock, you can find out immediately. Zacks helps you keep tabs on 
the analysts and closely track analyst revisions, which occur when 
researchers either increase or decrease their expectations for 
earnings.
From the Zacks Investment Research home page, just enter the stock’s 
symbol and click the Brokerage Recommendations link on the left side of 
the page. You’ll see a chart that plots the stock’s price and the Current 
ABR number, or average broker recommendation. This number averages 
all the recommendations made by the Wall Street analysts. A current 
ABR of 1 means that all the analysts covering the stock give it a “strong 
buy” rating, whereas an ABR of 5 means the analysts give it a “sell.”  
A 3 means “hold.” You can also see what the stock’s ABR was in the past 
so that you can tell whether analysts are getting more bullish or bearish.
Zacks also provides a Zacks Rank, which scores stocks from a low rating 
of 5 to a high of 1, which is located in the upper‐right corner of the 
page. But unlike the ABR number, which looks only at analyst ratings, 
the Zacks Ranks considers four factors: how much the analysts agree, 
how dramatically estimates have been increased or cut, how quickly 
the average estimate is rising, and how much the recent financials have 
­differed from the estimate.

155

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
You must subscribe to Zacks Premium to access all of the site’s informa-
tion; it costs $199 a year.
•	Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks) has a compre-
hensive database of analysts’ ratings on stocks so that you can see 
how Wall Street is reacting to an earnings release. Just enter the 
stock symbol into the Search Stocks text field of the Reuters Stocks 
home page, click the Search button, and then click on the company 
you’re interested in. Next, click on the Analysts tab. You’re greeted 
by a page that lets you look up what analysts have been expecting 
and also lets you track whether the company has the tendency to 
beat estimates in the past and by how much. You can view esti-
mates for both revenue and earnings.
•	Estimize (www.estimize.com) is taking a very different approach 
to earnings estimates. The site will show you what the official Wall 
Street analysts expect a company to earn during a quarter or year. 
But the site welcomes you and other investors to enter guesses, 
too. Estimize summarizes these crowdsourced estimates, giving 
investors another look at what’s expected.
In addition to tracking earnings reported by companies, it’s valuable to see 
how earnings from all the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index are 
coming in. S&P 500 earnings are closely watched by the pros because it gives 
them an idea of how healthy companies are. S&P Dow Jones’ S&P 500 page 
(http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp‐500) lets you see 
how much companies in the S&P 500 have earned each quarter for decades 
and also how much the companies are expected to earn. From the S&P 500 
page, click the Additional Info button and then click the Index Earnings link. A 
spreadsheet pops up with a treasure‐trove of earnings data.
Companies and the company they  
keep in their industries
Sweeping changes in an industry can have a tremendous influence on all 
the companies in it. A new product coming to the market can affect all the 
companies in its industry. Apple’s iPhone smartphone, for instance, shook 
up other electronics companies, software companies, and music companies. 
Other times, good news for one company, such as a change in regulation, 
can help other players in the industry. If you’re interested in keeping up with 
industry trends, here are several online sources:
✓
✓Specialized boutique research firms: These guys closely track an 
industry or a collection of related industries called a sector. These firms 
usually charge large sums for their research. Sometimes, though, they 
provide useful industry data on their websites for free. You can usually 

156
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
find them by searching for “research” and the name of the industry in 
most search engines. Table 6‐1 lists a few of the more prominent boutique 
research firms.
✓
✓Industry associations: Can you say “lobbyist”? Industry associations 
are usually groups paid by companies in the industry to represent them 
on Capital Hill. So, they’re certainly biased in favor of the industry. 
Still, most release helpful information that can tell you about industry 
trends. Typically, the easiest way to find such groups is by just enter-
ing the name of the industry and “association” into a search engine, as 
I describe in Chapter 2, and see what that turns up. The online encyclo-
pedia Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_ 
trade_group) keeps a list of many industry groups. Table 6‐2 lists a few 
of the larger industry associations.
✓
✓Pay services: Hoovers.com (www.hoovers.com/products/ 
100000859‐1.html) provides full reports on a wide range of ­industries 
to subscribers. S&P Capital IQ also publishes industry surveys (www.
spcapitaliq.com/our‐capabilities/our‐capabilities.
html?product=industry‐surveys#), but be forewarned, they can 
cost hundreds of dollars.

✓
✓The U.S. government: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (http://stats.bls.gov/iag/home.htm) maintains a set 
of comprehensive industry data that’s free to the public.
✓
✓Competitor information: Sometimes the best way to find out about a 
company is to find out what its rivals are saying about the industry. You 
can hear what companies are saying about each other with a two‐step 
process online:
a.	Find the competitors. You can get Yahoo! Finance (http://
finance.yahoo.com) to display the main rivals of any company. 
Just enter the stock symbol of the company you’re interested in 
into the Quote Lookup text field on the Yahoo! Finance home page 
and click the name of the company when it pops up. Next, select 
the Competitors option on the left side of the page. Reuters also 
provides a comprehensive list of competitors.
You might also want to see which companies in the industry are 
planning an IPO or recently have gone public. Regulatory filings 
from newly public companies contain great details about the 
industry. Renaissance Capital (www.renaissancecapital.com/
IPOHome/MarketWatch.aspx) provides a detailed list of recent 
IPOs and what industry they are in.
b.	Find the competitors’ filings. Regulatory filings published by 
rivals can be very revealing. Using the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s database, you can look up regulatory filings made 
by competitors. The annual reports, labeled 10‐Ks in the SEC data-
base, will usually have a section on the industry. And don’t miss 
the registration filings made by companies planning to go public, 
called S‐1s. You can usually find excellent industry information in 
those. (Chapter 2 tells you how to pull regulatory filings from the 
SEC’s website.)
✓
✓Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks) provides statistics 
that allow you to easily compare a company’s performance to that of 
its rivals. Enter the name or symbol of the company you want to learn 
more about in the Search Stocks blank and click the Search button. After 
selecting the company from a list, click on the Financials tab. When you 
scroll down, you’ll see how the company sizes up in the industry based 
on everything from sales to profit, as you can see in Figure 6‐2.
✓
✓S&P Dow Jones Indices (http://us.spindices.com/indices/
equity/sp‐500): This industry heavyweight provides detailed and free 
information on corporate profit growth of different sectors. Click the 
Additional Info button, and then click the Index Earnings. On the spread-
sheet that pops up, check out the Estimates & PEs tab for data on the 
sectors (available on the Sector EPS tab of the spreadsheet).

Monitoring the big cheese
Investors usually have a strong reaction to management changes. Stocks 
might fall when the chief financial officer (CFO) resigns because it might 
make folks wonder whether the company’s books are okay. But the opposite 
is also true — stocks might rise if a CEO who has worn out his welcome with 
investors decides to ride off into the sunset.
You can track management changes with the help of the following:
✓
✓Press releases: Regulators require that such releases be put out the 
moment a company announces a significant personnel change. The news 
sources described in Chapter 2 all have this information.
✓
✓AFL‐CIO CEO Pay Database (www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/
paywatch/ceou/index.cfm): This website provides data on the com-
ings and goings of corporate executives, with a keen focus on how much 
the people at the top are getting paid. Because the site is operated by 
labor groups, you find a not‐so‐subtle bias toward executive pay being 
too high. Even so, the data can be helpful.
Figure 6-2:  
Reuters 
shows you 
how a 
­company is 
performing 
in key areas 
relative to 
other 
­companies 
in its 
­industry.

✓MSCI (www.msci.com/esg‐integration): This provider of indexes 
tracks trends and data on executives. Most of the data, though, must 
be paid for and the charges can vary. You can view some of the indexes 
MSCI has created to attempt to capitalize on data it has collected about 
companies’ management.
Where it all begins: Tracking  
prices of raw materials
Companies can make more money in two main ways: Either sell more prod-
ucts or reduce costs. Most companies must buy certain raw materials includ-
ing commodities like coffee, copper, or oil to make what they sell. When the 
prices of these goods rise, that can be bad for the companies’ bottom lines. 
I have much more on how commodities are traded online in Chapter 11, but 
for just checking price information, you can track the pricing of key com-
modities at the following sites:
✓
✓Chicago Mercantile Exchange (www.cmegroup.com) is home for the 
trading of many financial instruments, including futures and options, 
making it a good place to see the prices of different foreign currencies. 
But it’s also home to many agricultural product trading, including pork 
bellies and live cattle.
The CME also bought the Chicago Board of Trade, so its website has 
data on everything from corn to soybeans, from oats to gold. To see 
prices, hover over the Agriculture and Energy tabs at the top of the 
page, which will open a pop‐up list of desired commodities.
✓
✓Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities) maintains 
a relatively easy‐to‐read and ‐understand table of most of the commodi-
ties you’re likely to care about.
Raw material costs and that morning cup o’ joe
Never underestimate how rising raw materials 
costs can jolt a company. For instance, early in 
Starbucks’ history, in June 1994, skyrocketing 
coffee costs posed a grave danger to the com-
pany as it weighed how to handle the higher 
costs. Another price shock came in September 
2004, after coffee and sugar prices spiked more 
than 35 percent in a year’s time. Starbucks 
reacted by boosting prices by 3 percent for all 
its drinks. It was the first time Starbucks had 
raised prices since August 2000. Starbucks 
increased prices again in some states in early 
2012, again citing higher coffee and energy 
costs, and again in 2015.

Getting with the mo’
Stocks, in the short term, often get what traders call momentum. There’s 
always a handful of darling stocks that short‐term speculators jump on due 
to the fact that they might have a hot product or simply because the stock is 
going up. Some speculators try to jump into these stocks and hope they can 
enjoy the ride higher and get out before the fall. The following sites highlight 
these high‐octane stocks:
✓
✓BigCharts.com (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com): This site 
has a BigReports tab that gives you access to all the stocks with the 
biggest moves, or those that are up the most or down the most over 
the past year. You can also see the stocks with the most short ­interest. 
Short interest is the number of shares being sold short by investors and 
is an indicator of how many investors think the stock will go down. 
(I describe stock shorting in Chapter 5.)
✓
✓Investors.com (www.investors.com): Scroll down on the home page 
of Investor’s Business Daily, and you will see a section called “Stocks on 
the Move.” This feature shows you the stocks other investors are making 
heavy bets on that day, or, stocks investors are dumping.
✓
✓Morningstar.com (http://screen.morningstar.com/Movers/
StMovPct.html?SelectView=1): This page of the Morningstar.com 
site provides an update on the market during the day. It shows you 
which stocks on all the major U.S. stock exchanges are rising or falling 
by the largest amounts. Bloomberg also provides a rundown of how 
30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are doing here: www.
bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/movers/dow.
Mania over merger chatter
It’s common for shares of a company being acquired to rise. That’s why 
investors love trying to predict takeover candidates.
Trying to guess what companies are buyout bait is not a great way to make 
money. Many of the merger‐and‐acquisition deals — M&A deals, for short — 
investors expect to happen don’t happen, and in rare cases, companies’ 
shares can fall if investors expected a buyer to offer more.
Most of the leading trackers of merger activity, including Dealogic and 
Thomson Reuters, sell their data only to institutional investors able to 

161

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
pay large sums. But some other places track merger activity, including the 
­following sites:
✓
✓mergermarket (www.mergermarket.com): These folks have compre-
hensive merger‐tracking information, ranging from scuttlebutt on what 
companies are in play and some summary data about merger activity. 
You must subscribe to get most of the information, but you can find a 
few free tidbits.
✓
✓FactSetMergerstat (www.factset.com/data/company_data/
mergers_acq): This website provides some free data about the 
merger‐and‐acquisition market if you register. Mergerstat’s quarterly 
updates are informative and give you an idea about the market.

✓Yahoo! Finance (http://biz.yahoo.com/topic/m‐a): Count on 
Yahoo! to summarize all its M&A news in one place.
Why bond yields aren’t boring
Stocks can be highly sensitive to changes in the yield on debt sold by the 
U.S. government, called Treasurys. Investors keep a close eye on two types 
of Treasurys: Treasury notes that mature in ten years or less and Treasury 
bills that mature in less than a year. The yield on Treasurys is very important 
because it indicates what return investors can expect in exchange for taking 
no or low risks.
Stocks and Treasurys have an interesting relationship with each other. When 
Treasury yields rise, stocks often suffer because there’s less impetus for 
investors to risk money on stocks. I discuss the basics about tracking yields 
online in Chapter 2 and give more advanced tips in Chapter 16. These sites 
help show the relationship between Treasury yields and stocks:
✓
✓StockCharts.com (www.stockcharts.com/charts/YieldCurve.
html): This page of the website has a Dynamic Yield Curve function, 
which shows you, graphically, how the yields for short‐term Treasurys, 
typically called bills, compare with yields for long‐term Treasurys, called 
notes and bonds. This graph is called the yield curve. But more impor-
tantly, it plots the yield curve against the stock market so that you can 
understand the relationship between bond yields and stocks.
✓
✓Fidelity’s Historical Yield Curve (https://fixedincome.fidelity.
com/ftgw/fi/FIHistoricalYield): This site plots the yield curve 
and also helps you understand it by explaining what it means if short‐
term rates are higher, lower, or equal to long‐term rates.

The heartbeat of the economy:  
Economic reports
If you can picture a patient at the hospital with probes and sensors on every 
inch of his body, you get the idea of how closely investors monitor the health 
of the economy. Investors are looking for any sign the economy is speeding 
up, slowing down, or going sideways. They rapidly buy or sell stocks if their 
opinion changes even a little. You can look in countless places for economic 
indicators, but the key sites are
✓
✓Conference Board (www.conference‐board.org): The Big Daddy 
of economic prognosticators, the Conference Board site, shown in 
Figure 6‐3, measures everything from manufacturing activity to unem-
ployment claims, from building permits to consumer confidence. Pay 
special attention to the U.S. Leading Economic Index, which falls when 
the measures it monitors predict an economic decline.
Although the Conference Board’s leading index is widely watched, it’s 
not always right. Investment pros like to joke that the leading index has 
predicted six of the last three recessions. For instance, the indicator fell 
in 1984 and 1987, but the economy didn’t contract either time.

ness, tracking a vast majority of the indicators investors focus on, 
including the following:
•	The Consumer Price Index, which measures how much prices for 
the things individuals buy are changing.
•	The Producer Price Index, which tracks prices paid by companies 
that create goods. When prices are rising, both bond and stock 
investors pay attention because that affects the value of their 
investments. Stock investors typically don’t like inflation because 
it drives up costs and makes their investments worth less.
•	Employee wages.
•	Unemployment.
✓
✓U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.
bea.gov): More government predictors at work. The Bureau of 
Economic Analysis monitors how fast the economy is growing, generally 
using a measure called the gross domestic product, or GDP. You can also 
look up how much individuals are spending on average, what personal 
income levels are like, and how corporate profits are doing.
✓
✓The Federal Reserve Board (www.federalreserve.gov): Investors 
look long and hard at the Fed for two reasons. First, the Fed sets short‐
term interest rates, which determine how much money is worth. Short‐
term rates affect every aspect of the economy, from how fast it grows to 
how much you have to pay to borrow money, and how much you earn 
from investments and savings. You can track the intended federal funds 
rate here: www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm.
Don’t confuse short‐term interest rates and long‐term interest rates. The 
Fed sets short‐term rates to steer the economy. When the Fed wants to 
slow the economy, it tightens credit by raising short‐term rates, making 
it more expensive for companies and people to borrow and spend. It can 
loosen credit by cutting short‐term rates, which boosts the economy. 
Long‐term interest rates are set by traders who guess the direction 
of the economy. The difference between short‐ and long‐term rates is 
known as the spread.
The Fed also publishes the Beige Book eight times a year. The Beige 
Book indicates the nation’s economic health. You can view the results 
at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook/
default.htm.

✓National Association of Realtors (www.realtor.org): The fate of the 
housing market has a major impact on the economy as a whole. The 
National Association of Realtors’ website releases closely watched data 
on both new‐ and existing‐home sales, data that investors can use to get 
a better sense of the health of the economy as a whole.

What they know that you don’t —  
Insider buying and selling
Some investors closely watch what the top officers and directors are doing 
when deciding whether they should buy or sell a stock. This is legal insider 
buying or selling, which is very different from the illegal insider trading that I 
describe in Chapter 5.
Investors assume that when officers of a company are buying the stock, it’s a 
sign the company is doing well. Some investors get bearish on a stock when 
executives are selling company stock.
When you see executives selling stock, it doesn’t necessarily mean that 
they’re bailing out. Executives might sell stock to buy a home, send a kid to 
college, or diversify their holdings. Diversification offers great benefits to 
investors, as I describe in Chapter 9, so it shouldn’t come as a big surprise if 
higher‐echelon types diversify as well.
Nevertheless, major sell‐offs or a run on stocks by executives might actually 
be saying something significant about the stock. If you’d like to track what 
officers are doing, the following sites can help:
✓
✓NASDAQ’s Ownership Summary (www.nasdaq.com): You get to this 
page on the NASDAQ site by entering a stock symbol in the Search 
text box and then clicking the name of the company or clicking on the 
search button. Scroll down the menu on the left side and then click on 
the Ownership Summary link under the Holdings heading. You get a list 
of what all the big investors, including officers, directors, and mutual 
funds, are doing. The Insider Trades section shows how many officers 
are buying or selling stock, how much, and when. You can view insider‐
trading data for stocks listed on the major exchanges, including the 
NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange.

✓
✓Morningstar (http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/
insider‐summary.action): The Morningstar Insider Trading Overview 
page lets you see trends of insider buying and selling over time. That’s 
useful because you can see whether the officers have an uncanny ability 
to buy and sell at just the right time. The page shows you overall trends 
in trading. You can also search for specific insiders or companies by 
scrolling down and entering search information in the Insider Search box.
✓
✓InsiderTrading.org (www.insidertrading.org) is designed to be 
an efficient way to see what the insiders are doing. The site’s design is 
sparse, but you can quickly search for insider buying and selling trans-
actions and InsiderTrading.org pulls the data from the regulatory filings.
✓
✓GradientAnalytics (www.gradientanalytics.com): GradientAnalytics 
is a well‐regarded research firm that looks at insider trading with great 
precision. The reports it produces are sold only to large investors and 
are very expensive. But the firm’s cofounder, Carr Bettis, has described 
some of his techniques in an academic paper, “Insider Trading in 
Derivative Securities,” available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/
papers.cfm?abstract_id=167189.
Many market pros who track insider trading don’t get too interested if just a 
few executives are selling. After all, CEOs might want to sell stock for many 
reasons, such as for buying a house, diversifying their portfolios, or sending 
a kid to college. But if you see executives at many companies in an industry 
dumping shares, you might want to take a closer look.
Knowing how investors are feeling: 
Tracking market sentiment
The way investors are feeling about stocks at the moment can greatly influ-
ence the market’s movements in the short term. Typically, during a brutal 
bear market, a period of time when stocks are falling in value, investors sour 
on stocks and want nothing to do with them.
When investors hate stocks, market sentiment is negative, and that can be a 
good time to buy them because you’ll likely pay less. The market’s downturn 
in the late 2000s was a classic example. Had you invested in the Standard & 
Poor’s 500 in March 2009 when other investors were panicking, you would 
have scored a 65 percent gain that year. Investors who buy stocks when 
they’re out of favor are called contrarians. It got even better. Those who held 
those stocks until 2015 had nearly tripled their money.

166
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
When stocks enter a bull market and start rising, more investors pile in and 
push markets higher. Eventually, sentiment becomes overly positive, and 
anyone who wanted to buy stock already has. When there’s a whiff of bad 
news, these investors bail out and send stocks lower. That’s what happened 
during the tech‐stock boom in the late 1990s. And, as you might remember, 
when investors were overly bullish in March 2000, that was a bad time to buy 
stocks. Investors, again, got overly optimistic in October 2007, just before the 
financial crisis that erupted in 2008 and 2009.
A number of online tools can help you monitor sentiment:
✓
✓Schaeffer’s Investment Research (www.schaeffersresearch.com): 
This site is a haven for investors who want to know what the crowd is 
doing, and then do the opposite. The News and Analysis tab contains 
posts that help you pinpoint stocks the herd likes the most and the ones it 
hates. The idea is that buying stocks no one else wants can be profitable.
✓
✓Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com/micro/vix/
introduction.aspx): This website maintains the CBOE Market 
Volatility index, a popular measure of how bullish investors are. (It’s 
referred to fondly as the VIX.) It’s also known as the “fear gauge” by 
investors because the higher the VIX, the more nervous investors are 
about the stock market, as defined by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. 
You can track the VIX much like you’d track any other index or stock, as I 
describe in Chapter 1. You can see what this page looks like in Figure 6‐4.

The site also shows you the put/call ratio, an indicator of how bullish 
investors are. The higher the put/call ratio, the more bearish investors 
are. You can access such put/call ratio data at http://www.cboe.

description of what puts and calls are in Chapter 5.
✓
✓Investment Company Institute (www.ici.org): This site tracks how 
much money investors are putting into mutual funds.
So what’s the big deal about mutual funds? It might seem insulting, 
but Wall Street pros closely watch fund flows as a measure of what the 
“dumb money” is doing. The idea is that if tons of cash surge into mutual 
funds, investors are getting overly optimistic, and it might be a good 
time to sell. You can track fund flows at www.ici.org/research/
stats. As for how effective mutual funds are at pointing out what not to 
do, check out Table 6‐3. Basically, the market doesn’t always work out 
the way the mutual fund investors want. Investors essentially played one 
of the most dramatic bear and bull cycles — completely wrong.

What Moves Stocks in the Long Term?
Almost anything can move stocks in the short term. Investors are so touchy 
on a minute‐by‐minute basis that they might even sell stocks if a Wall Street 
trader sneezes. Long term, though, the market is much more, well, sane. 
Several key factors affect stocks’ returns over the long term:
✓
✓Company fundamentals, such as how much the company generates 
in cash and earnings over its lifetime, is the major contributor to how 
its stock performs. I discuss how to analyze long‐term financial perfor-
mance in Chapters 12 and 13.
What doesn’t move stocks: Stock splits
My readers are always asking me to explain 
stock splits to them. For some reason, ­individual 
investors are fascinated by stock splits, ­perhaps 
because they think they’re getting something 
for nothing.
A stock split occurs when a company believes 
its stock price is getting high enough to scare 
off investors with sticker shock. Companies 
might consider a split if their shares get to  
$75 or higher. After a split, investors own more 
shares, but the stock price is cut. For instance, 
when a company does a 2‐for‐1 stock split, 
investors get twice the number of shares, but 
the stock price is cut in half. So if you had  
100 shares of a $10 stock, worth $1,000, after the 
split, you’d have 200 shares worth $5. There’s 
no change in the size of your stake; you still own 
$1,000 in stock.
Most financial websites show you whether a 
stock has split. Yahoo! Finance (finance.
yahoo.com), for example, places a hexagon 
on a historical stock chart to indicate when a 
split occurred. Here’s how to do it: Enter the 
stock symbol you’re interested in at Yahoo! 
Finance, click the name of the company when 
it pops up, and then click the Interactive option 
under the Charts header on the left side of the 
page. Choose the time period you’re looking for, 
and look for the "split" icon under the chart.
StockSplits.net (www.stocksplits.net) 
also tracks splits and has a free newsletter for 
people who are interested.
The value of stock splits is controversial. Some 
academic research shows that stock splits are 
early signals a company will perform well in the 
future. The theory is a company’s management 
wouldn’t split the stock unless it was fairly cer-
tain that the stock wasn’t likely to head lower.
Other research, though, finds splits to have 
negligible value for investors. Zacks Investment 
Research studied small and midsize companies 
going back to 1998 to see how splits of at least 
1.5‐to‐1 affected the shares of companies up 
to 12 months later. Zacks found no discernible 
­difference in the returns of companies that split 
their stock versus those that didn’t over the 
­following 12 months.

 Chapter 6: Why Stock Prices Rise and Fall
✓
✓Long‐term economic trends set the table for stocks. If a chronic prob-
lem with inflation or low economic growth exists, that can spell trouble 
for many investments.
✓
✓Valuations, as in how much you’re paying for a piece of a company. A 
stock’s valuation is a measure of how expensive it is based on how much 
the company is expected to earn in profit. This is pursued in more detail 
in Chapter 12.
✓
✓Risk is the price you pay for higher returns. If you own a piece of a 
risky asset, you should demand a higher return in exchange. Academic 
research discussed in Chapter 1 shows how shares of small companies 
and companies based in emerging markets tend to generate higher 
returns because they’re riskier. I describe the relationship between a 
stock’s risk and return in Chapter 3.
Going back to school with  
academic research
If you’re curious about what moves stocks in the long term, spend time read-
ing the research put out by academics. Because they’re not pressured to sell 
investments, academics have the time to sit down, study markets, and search 
for patterns. Some of the work that has come from academia has revolution-
ized investing and has greatly enhanced the understanding of why stocks 
do what they do. I mention several critical sources of academic research in 
Chapter 1. Other online resources worth checking out include the following:
✓
✓Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com): This particular arm 
of Google lets you search through millions of academic papers for those 
that match your search terms. You can follow the links to get access to 
view the research.
✓
✓Microsoft Academic Search (http://academic.research. 
microsoft.com): You can use this site to quickly locate academic 
works. The site also allows you to browse academic research based 
on topic areas. Microsoft Academic Search allows you to search by 
keyword, but also based on the name of the publication, conference, or 
organization. You can see what the search page looks like in Figure 6‐5.
✓
✓Social Science Research Network (http://papers.ssrn.com): Here 
you can find the primary database for published works by academics. 
The database is fully searchable by keyword and author. You can view 
some of the research for free, but you have to pay for other parts.

✓
✓Jeremy Siegel (www.jeremysiegel.com): Siegel, a professor at the 
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, is best known for his 
exhaustive market research. Some of Siegel’s data has led to important 
discoveries, including the concept that stocks become less risky the 
longer they’re held. You can read much of Siegel’s work and research 
at this site, but you’re assessed a charge to access most of it. Siegel 
has also cofounded a company, WisdomTree (www.wisdomtree.com), 
which sells investment products that take advantage of his research. 
I discuss Siegel’s work in greater detail in Chapter 11, where I explain 
exchange‐traded funds.
Learning from the wise men
Some investors have so much experience with markets that they’re 
very worthwhile listening to. No, they’re not always right, but you can 
learn from their mistakes. A few examples, in addition to those listed in 
Chapter 1, include
✓
✓Warren Buffett (www.berkshirehathaway.com): He’s perhaps the 
best‐known and most successful investor ever, so it’s worth your while 
to listen to him. Each year Buffett, CEO of a holding company called 
Berkshire Hathaway, releases the company’s annual report in ­addition 
to various letters to shareholders. Even if you’re not a Berkshire 
Hathaway shareholder, Buffett’s letters are some of the best reads in

but they also contain market insight you can’t find elsewhere. Berkshire 
Hathaway’s financial reports are available for free on the company’s 
website, shown in Figure 6‐6.
✓
✓Jeffrey Gundlach (www.doubleline.com): As chief investment officer 
at the bond fund management firm DoubleLine, Gundlach shares his 
insights on the economy and investments.
✓
✓George Soros (www.georgesoros.com): You may or may not agree 
with his outspoken political views, but George Soros, a long‐time (and 
successful) investor, offers his opinions on global markets and investing.
Another great way to see what famous investors are doing is to check the 
forms they must file with regulators. Money managers who oversee  
$100 million or more must file a Form 13F with the SEC. These forms must 
disclose what the investors own, how many shares they own, and the 
value of their holdings. These Form 13Fs can provide revealing glimpses into 
what large investors like Warren Buffett and other professional investors 
are doing. The SEC tells you more about the 13F forms and how to access 
them at www.sec.gov/answers/form13f.htm. You can also find more 
­information on digging up regulatory filings in Chapter 12.

nvesting used to be a solitary pursuit. Investors would analyze stocks, 
bonds, and other assets to decide which ones to add to their portfolios. 
Sometimes a financial advisor or a broker might be summoned for help or 
advice.
But all that’s changing as investors turn to the Internet for places to chat and 
compare ideas with others online. Online investors used to rely on stock mes-
sage boards, often called chat boards, to trade stock tips, gossip, and hunches 
with each other. Stock message boards are still a way for investors to con-
nect, but they’ve become marginalized by new types of social networking 
sites, including the increasingly popular Twitter and Facebook, which have 
distinct advantages. Many brokerages, too, are providing technology to allow 
investors to communicate with each other online. Additionally, some social 
investing sites apply the power of social networking just for investors.
In the first part of this chapter, I show you how to get online with stock mes-
sage boards, including how to contribute to them and what to watch out for. 
Later, I explore the dangers of penny stocks, which are some of the favorites 
on stock message boards and other online forums. And lastly, I explore the 
emerging area of Twitter, Facebook, and social investing sites.

Finding Kindred Investment 
Spirits Online
Whenever you’re about to try something risky, or at least something you’ve 
never done before, it’s comforting to talk to people with experience. That’s 
why many investors attempt to connect with each other. You have several 
ways to do this: through stock message boards, investment clubs, or social 
networking or social investing sites.
These are a few reasons why you might consider adding a social aspect to 
your investment strategy:
✓
✓Moral support: Many beginning online investors are bewildered by 
the things they need to remember. By connecting with other investors 
online who have already done what you’re thinking about doing, you can 
gain firsthand knowledge of the risks and rewards.
✓
✓A new perspective: You might think you know the best way to manage 
your money. But why not run your strategy by others first and make 
sure that you’re not overlooking anything?
✓
✓New ideas for investments: Members of online communities come from 
different professions and from all over the world. You can use this diver-
sity to your advantage, and you might even find out about investments 
you’ve never heard of.
Getting the Message with  
Stock Message Boards
When you think of connecting with other investors online, you probably 
think of Twitter and Facebook first. Social media is turning into the way 
of choice for online investors to connect. But before jumping into social 
media, it’s helpful to first check out stock message boards. These informal, 
anonymous forums were an early way for investors to chat with each other 
online. They give you an instant way to brag about your returns, promote a 
stock you own, or flame a stock you’ve sold for a loss. They’re easy to jump 
into — giving you a quick flavor of what you might gain from sharing ideas 
with complete strangers.

175

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
Stock message boards aren’t for everyone
Some investors, especially passive investors described in Chapter 1, might 
not care what other investors think about their stocks. They’ve formed their 
asset allocation — as I describe in Chapter 9 — and they’re going to stick 
with that no matter what.
But if you’re an active investor and you see online investing as a hobby, you 
might be very interested in the chatter that surrounds stocks you’re consid-
ering. Stock message boards are suited for you if you
✓
✓View investing as a form of entertainment: Some investors buy and sell 
stocks not so much to accumulate a nest egg, but for speculation. It’s 
almost like a trip to Las Vegas.
✓
✓Don’t want to hassle with sign‐up procedures: You can be up and run-
ning with most stock message boards in just minutes and usually don’t 
even have to identify yourself.
✓
✓Know the rules: Investors who understand that many of the things said 
on stock message boards are exaggerations, manipulations, or just plain 
wrong have a better chance finding worthwhile nuggets of information.
Blindly following what other investors are doing, generally speaking, isn’t 
a good strategy and can be dangerous. If you’re looking for stock mes-
sage boards for stock recommendations, you’ll likely be disappointed with 
your results.
Understanding the types  
of stock message boards
Although stock message boards have been around essentially since the 
start of online investing, they’ve morphed quite a bit through the past bull 
and bear markets. But currently, they’re available on a number of different 
platforms. The following sections explore the various corners of the Internet 
where investors congregate to swap info.
Using online stock message boards as the key to your investment strategy 
isn’t a good idea. Listening to so many other opinions might cause you to 
second‐guess yourself and prompt you to buy and sell stocks too often. But 
more importantly, you don’t know whom you’re chatting with, and such 
boards are havens for scammers. Consider Anthony Elgindy, an infamous 
stock picker who developed a strong following for some of his picks on the 
stock message board, Silicon Investor, as “AnthonyPacific,” in addition to 

176
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
promoting stocks on his own website. Elgindy was convicted in 2005 in fed-
eral court on multiple counts of securities fraud and extortion. Remember, 
always consider the source when using stock message boards to pick stocks.
The investing areas of general Internet portals
As message boards get pushed aside by Twitter and Facebook, most of the 
portals have dropped them. The last holdout that still offers them is Yahoo! 
Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com), which has become a top desti-
nation for the casual stock message board participant. Just enter a stock 
symbol of a company you’d like to hear about into the Quote Lookup text 
field and click the name of the company you’re interested in when it pops 
up. Click the Message Boards link on the left‐hand side of the new page that 
appears. You can scroll down through the messages and read them, but if 
you want to reply to messages, you’ll need a Yahoo! logon ID and password.
Specialized stock message boards
These boards are often the most popular sites with individual investors who 
see themselves as being more advanced than those using the general Internet 
portals’ boards. Examples include
✓
✓Raging Bull (www.ragingbull.com): One of the favorite spots for day 
traders and active speculators, here you can find a board on just about 
anything, ranging from individual stocks to specific industries. You can 
even trade investing jokes!
✓
✓Silicon Investor (www.siliconinvestor.com): This site tends to 
attract investors primarily interested in large and midsize publicly 
traded companies.
✓
✓Investors Hub (investorshub.advfn.com): Discussions here tend to 
focus on who’s hot (and who’s not) among smaller companies.
Stock message board aggregators
You can waste a great deal of time hopping between all the different stock 
message boards. Some sites, called aggregators, try to solve this problem 
by pulling the messages into one place. One source of this information is 
BoardCentral (www.boardcentral.com), shown in Figure 7‐1. BoardCentral 
offers a single place to get messages from Yahoo! Finance, Raging Bull, 
Silicon Investor, and others. It has also recently started scouring Twitter 
for messages about stocks, too. BoardCentral also ranks the stocks that 
are most talked about as well as those stocks that investors are most often 
searching for.

Knowing the ulterior motives of some 
online stock message board members
Although many of the people who use online stock message boards might be 
upstanding individuals just looking to help their fellow man, great caution is 
warranted. People can abuse online stock message boards for personal gain 
in several ways, including the following:
✓
✓Hyping stocks they own: Some members might exaggerate or even 
make up good news regarding a stock they own, hoping to fool others 
into buying the stock. This is commonly called a pump‐and‐dump scheme 
or ramping. Scammers first “pump” a stock by doing whatever it takes 
to artificially inflate a stock price, usually by spreading lies. Then they 
“dump,” or sell the stock before anyone catches on.
✓
✓Disparaging stocks they’re shorting: Investors can profit from a fall-
ing stock by shorting shares, as I describe in Chapter 5. Some investors 
might spread false rumors about a company with the hopes that such 
rumors will cause a panic and get others to sell.
✓
✓Promoting companies that pay them: Questionable companies can hire 
legions of stock promoters to stoke enthusiasm for their shares. These 
promoters might float a stream of positive press releases online, trying 
to create the appearance that the company has lots going on.

Determining what exchange  
or market a stock trades on
If you’re going to be using stock message boards, you need to know the dif-
ference between unlisted stocks and stocks listed on an exchange. Some of 
the most popular stocks discussed on stock message boards aren’t listed 
on an exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Instead, they trade on infor-
mal and lightly regulated electronic markets such as the OTC Pink or OTC 
Bulletin Board.
It’s important for you to know whether a stock trades on the OTC Pink, better 
known as the Pink Sheets, or OTC Bulletin Board, because if it’s trading 
there, it doesn’t have to meet the same listing standards that any stock on 
the exchanges needs to meet. That means the stocks have less oversight. For 
instance, stocks on the Pink Sheets aren’t required to file audited financial 
statements. And many stocks on these exchanges are abandoned shell com-
panies that can be used by fraudsters to create a pump‐and‐dump scheme. 
(These dangers are covered in greater detail in the next section of this chap-
ter.) But for now, you want to know how to find out where your stock trades. 
The following list shows you how to find out the primary market for a spe-
cific stock:
Stock message boards and the Enron debacle
Despite the many problems with stock message 
boards, sometimes they can contain very valu-
able pieces of information. You should carefully 
monitor the boards for comments that appear 
to be from informed employees. The stock 
message boards, in fact, were one of the only 
places where investors were warned about 
the coming collapse of Enron in 2001 — an old 
example, but a noteworthy one, since the col-
lapse of Enron was one of the largest bankrupt-
cies in U.S. history.
Between 1997 and 2001, ahead of Enron’s 
fall, more than 129 detailed posts were found 
on Enron’s stock message board on Yahoo!, 
according to James Felton and Jongchai Kim in 
their article “Warnings from the Enron Message 
Board.” These posts, many that appear to be 
from employees, indicated serious problems 
at the company, even while most Wall Street 
analysts rated the stock a “buy” or “strong 
buy.” In April 2001, for instance, an anonymous 
post read, “It will soon be revealed that Enron 
is nothing more than a house of cards that will 
implode before anyone realizes what happened. 
Enron has been cooking the books with smoke 
and mirrors. Enron executives have been oper-
ating an elaborate scheme that has fooled even 
the most sophisticated analyst.”
That post appeared online four months before 
Enron employee Sherron Watkins wrote the 
famous warning letter to Enron CEO Ken 
Lay. You can read Felton and Kim’s article at

A penny saved: Beware of penny stocks
If you spend much time looking at online stock message boards, you might 
notice that many of the messages are posted about stocks that trade for less 
than $1 — so‐called “penny” stocks. That’s partly because penny stocks, due 
to their tiny share prices, allow investors to buy large numbers of shares. 
Owning large chunks of stock is appealing to the same speculator‐types who 
flock to stock message boards to begin with.
But penny stocks can also be popular on stock message boards because 
they’re easily manipulated. Unlike giant stocks like Exxon and Microsoft, 
which are so valuable that you’d need billions of dollars to budge the stock, 
penny stocks can be nudged with just a few hundred bucks. Just a small 
amount of hype or negativity can have a large effect on a penny stock’s share 
price. A stock has to move only from one penny to two pennies to double a 
fraudster’s money.
Many penny stocks also trade on the generally unregulated Pink Sheets and 
OTC Bulletin Board markets, considered to be the Wild Wild West of online 
investing. It’s best to avoid investing in penny stocks, but if you can’t resist 
the urge, be sure you have
✓
✓Read the warnings from regulators: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) has released multiple warnings to investors about 
investing in penny stocks, including this must‐read guide: www.sec.
gov/investor/pubs/microcapstock.htm. You should also search 
for the company’s name and officers using the tools at the SEC’s main 
site (www.sec.gov) to see whether prior problems have occurred. The 
SEC outlines the unique risks of investing in Pink Sheet stocks at www.
sec.gov/answers/pink.htm.
✓
✓Checked the company’s level of disclosure: OTC Markets (www.
otcmarkets.com) rates companies with one of eight icons that 
indicate how much information they provide to investors. The 
highest‐quality rating is OTCQX, followed by OTCQB, OTCPinkCurrent 
Information, OTCPink Limited Information, OTCPink No Information, 
Grey Market, and then Caveat Emptor. You can read what all those 
ratings mean at www.otcmarkets.com/learn/otc‐market‐tiers. 
(Part of the website page is shown in Figure 7‐3.) Just enter the stock’s

Connecting with an Investment Club
If online stock message boards seem too wild and scary but you’d still like 
to connect with other investors, you might consider an investment club. 
Investment clubs are typically gatherings of investors in a certain geographic 
area who meet at a local restaurant or a member’s house to shoot the breeze. 
Members pitch stocks they think the group should buy or sell. Investment 
clubs also have a bit of a party feeling to them, because they’re usually 
designed to be fun, educational, and, oh yeah, profitable. If your city doesn’t 
have an investment club, or if meeting with people in person doesn’t fit your 
schedule, a few online investment clubs are cropping up. Whether the club 
you’re interested in joining is held in the local Moose club or online, you may 
be required to buy in by adding money to a pool of cash.
How to find an investment  
club that suits you
If you’re interested in an investment club, here are several (online) ways to 
get started:
Don’t be fooled: Starbucks wasn’t a penny stock
Some penny‐stock investors claim many suc-
cessful stocks like Starbucks and Microsoft 
started out as penny stocks. They look at long‐
term charts online, as I describe in Chapter 6, 
and say that those stocks started trading at less 
than $2 a share. That is simply not true, and it’s 
worthwhile to understand why.
Consider Starbucks. Some investors look at a 
long‐term chart and claim that the coffeehouse 
chain’s shares closed on their first day of trad-
ing on June 26, 1992, at $0.31 apiece. And if you 
look at a chart, that appears to be true. But it’s 
an illusion caused by stock splits. When a stock 
splits, as I describe in Chapter 6, the company 
cuts its share price and increases the number 
of shares. A stock split has no effect on the 
value of the stock or company, but changes his-
torical prices because most charting services 
split‐adjust historical stock prices. Starbucks’ 
shares have had six 2‐for‐1 splits since they 
debuted on the NASDAQ, most recently in 
March 2015.
To find out what the actual closing price of 
Starbucks’ stock was on June 26, 1992, you 
must undo the effect of the six splits that 
occurred after that date. You do that by multi-
plying the split‐adjusted stock price in 1992, or 
$31, by each split amount. For Starbucks, that’s 
0.31 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = $19.84. That means 
Starbucks’ actual price at the end of its first day 
of trading was $19.84, not 31 cents.

✓National Association of Investors Corporation, also known as 
BetterInvesting (www.betterinvesting.org), is one of the top asso-
ciations of investment clubs. BetterInvesting’s website lets you find 
investment clubs in your area. You can also take online classes to work 
on improving your investing success. And if no investment club is near 
you, you can find out how to start a club of your own or join an online

✓Bivio (www.bivio.com) is perfect if you’d like the friendly and personal 
nature of an investment club but don’t have time to attend monthly 
meetings. Bivio is a collection of online investment clubs. You can 
search through the club home pages and choose a club to join or even 
start your own.

group of members who pick stocks. You must apply to be accepted, and 
if you get chosen, you must submit two stock picks a year.

✓Meetup.com (www.meetup.com) provides an online way for people with 
common interests to connect in person. People interested in investing 
often create meetings or “Meetups” and provide the time and location 
on the site.
Understanding the drawbacks 
of investment clubs
Before you rush out and join an investment club, be aware of the potential 
drawbacks:
✓
✓Bad decisions by others can cost you. If the loudmouthed guy in 
the club talks the group into buying a stinker, you’re going to take a 
bath, too.
✓
✓They give an incentive to tinker. Many investment clubs consider 
themselves to be long‐term investors, or shareholders who hang onto 
a stock for at least a year and usually much longer. But an investment 
club wouldn’t be much fun if the members never actually bought or sold 
anything. That means there’s somewhat of an incentive to be constantly 
buying or selling investments.
✓
✓Compromise can hurt. Although nothing is wrong with agreement, 
having several people steering a portfolio sometimes means that there’s 
no single and coherent strategy.
✓
✓Members’ investing skill levels can vary. Some investment club mem-
bers are only there for the fun, food, and friends. That can leave much 
of the grunt work for the few members with the skill or desire to make 
money in the club.

Social Networking Comes of Age
Each year, Twitter and Facebook rapidly make message boards and other 
ways to connecting with other investors less relevant. Investors used to put 
up with the limitations of stock message boards because they had few other 
options. Investors who wanted to chat or trade ideas online had to deal with 
the ugliness of the anonymous forums in order to reach some legitimate 
investors online.
But both stock message boards and newsgroups are falling by the wayside 
as social networks have come to dominate online interactions. Online social 
networking sites, namely Twitter (www.twitter.com) and Facebook (www.
facebook.com), allow anyone with an Internet connection to share news 
and information — or just worthless random musings — with others.
Social networking is just a fancy term used to describe computer systems that 
help you connect directly with other people online. So far, social network-
ing is geared mainly for things other than investing, such as sharing family 
photos or setting up weekend plans with friends. You can create a Facebook 
page and let all your friends see photos of your amazing skateboarding dog, 
for instance.
But believe it or not, there are ways to harness these social networks for the 
purposes of investing online. And in the following sections, I show you how.
What’s the fuss about Twitter?
It’s probably easiest to understand the power of social networking by exam-
ining one of its poster children: Twitter. Twitter is essentially an online 
service that allows people to create names for themselves and dash out 140‐
character long statements, or tweets, about anything that’s on their minds. 
Photos and links to websites can be included in tweets, too. You, too, can 
sign up and send out these messages. You can view these messages on your 
computer using a browser, or using an app for your mobile device.
Twitter gets more powerful when people sign up to read and see all the 
tweets coming from people they’re interested in. You can sign up to read all 
Bill Gates’s tweets, for instance. You do this by following people on Twitter. If 
you sign up to get someone’s tweets, you are a follower.
Usually, tweets are banal and not very useful. The original use of Twitter 
was for people to dash out stream‐of‐conscience memos, such as, “I’m wait-
ing in line for my cappuccino now.” Who cares, right? But Twitter has grown 
up to such a degree that now investors are starting to use it as a source of 
information.

185

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
Ways you might use Twitter as an online investor include the following:
✓
✓Following the news: All the major investing news organizations 
maintain Twitter feeds. USA TODAY, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, CNN, 
and others routinely send out tweets immediately when they have a hot 
story. Best of all, these tweets usually include links that you can click 
and immediately get access to the story or video feed. It’s like having a 
real‐time news service from the sources you trust. And you don’t even 
have to sign up to view these tweets. Curious? You can read my online 
investing tweets without even signing up. Just go to www.twitter.
com/mattkrantz, and you can see what I’m tweeting about.
✓
✓Keeping up with the regulators: When regulators find new scams or 
scandals, they often send out tweets immediately. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission routinely sends out tweets with alerts and break-
ing news. You can read these at http://www.twitter.com/SEC_
News.
✓
✓Monitoring developments at online brokers: Most online brokerage 
firms maintain Twitter feeds, and they’re a great source for news about 
the company. TradeKing, TD Ameritrade, Scottrade, Schwab, E*TRADE, 
and Zecco are all on Twitter and use the system to give investors infor-
mation. Twitter is also a great way to open a public dialogue directly 
with an online brokerage or to get the brokerage’s attention by sending 
a tweet about the firm. You can also send direct messages to your broker-
age, which is a private message, almost like an email.
✓
✓Tracking trends as they’re happening: Some Wall Street traders and 
investment experts maintain Twitter feeds and make information avail-
able during the day. It’s a great way to see what’s on the minds of 
other investors as the day unfolds. Also, you might get some tidbits 
of information that are useful, but would have been lost in the past, 
because they aren’t substantial enough for an article, blog post, or news-
letter item.
Getting your tweet on
Before you can use Twitter, you first need to understand how to get access to 
the service. You can sign up using a mobile app or your computer. Because 
most online investors still count on their computers, the directions below are 
for the browser. It’s really just a few basic steps:
1.	Go to www.twitter.com and sign up for Twitter by registering your 
email address and choosing a Twitter name.
Your Twitter name is like your handle. It’s always preceded by an amper-
sand. In other words, if your Twitter handle is TheBestInvestor, on 
Twitter you’re @TheBestInvestor. It’s like your email address on Twitter.
It’s free to sign up.

186
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
2.	Find people to follow.
Clicking the Find Friends link at the left side of Twitter lets you search 
for people you know and have in your email address book. But if you 
already know the Twitter handle of a user, just enter www.twitter.
com/handle into the address bar of your browser of choice. So to find 
me, for example, you’d type in www.twitter.com/mattkrantz. You 
can also search for people or organizations you’d like to follow by enter-
ing their name into the Search Twitter field at the top of the page.
3.	Scan the Twitter feed and see whether you want to follow.
You can see on the page what kinds of things the person is tweeting 
about. If you want to get alerted whenever new tweets from that person 
are posted, click the +Follow button.
4.	Monitor your timeline.
When you log on to Twitter.com from now on, the first page you’ll see is 
your Twitter home, or a list of all the tweets being sent out by the people 
you are following. This is your source of what’s happening with people 
you’re interested in. These same people’s tweets will show up on your 
Twitter mobile app.
Being a good follower
Ready to start Tweeting? Now that you’ve created a Twitter account, the next 
thing you need to do to get going is to actually access the system. You have 
several ways to monitor your Twitter account, including the following:
✓
✓Twitter.com: The easiest way to jump onto the Twitter bandwagon is to 
just use the actual Twitter.com website, as previously discussed. On the 
website, you can do everything you’d need to start tweeting and reading 
others’ tweets.
✓
✓Twitter clients: One of Twitter’s unique features is that you can use the 
system without using Twitter.com. Twitter opens its network to other 
developers, who make software and websites, called clients, which make 
Twitter easier to use. Tweetdeck (www.tweetdeck.com) is software 
that you download to your computer that provides another way to 
read all your tweets. Another popular reader is HootSuite (http://
hootsuite.com), but it’s designed more for companies who are 
managing a number of Twitter accounts.
✓
✓Mobile Twitter apps: Some people get so addicted to Twitter, they can’t 
bear to be away. And that’s why some load Twitter apps onto their 
smartphones. Each smartphone can have its own applications designed 
to work best with its tiny screen. And many of the Twitter clients men-
tioned in the previous point have versions for smartphones, too. Twitter 
itself provides mobile apps for all the key smartphones and tablets, 
which can be downloaded at https://twitter.com/download.

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
Turning Twitter into an online investing tool
Because Twitter wasn’t really designed for investors, it takes a little effort 
for online investors to find useful information. The key to Twitter is finding 
people and news outlets that regularly tweet information you’re interested in. 
You have several ways to do this:
✓
✓Using Twitter.com’s search feature: You can see a Search Twitter field 
at the top of the Twitter.com login page. You can search for people 
by their name or organization. This is a great place to start, especially if 
you’re interested in a certain investing source.
✓
✓Searching Bing.com: The search engine has a nifty feature to help you 
find famous investors on Twitter. Enter the name of the investor in Bing 
and search. If the investor is on Twitter, there’s a good chance a Twitter 
link will appear on the right‐hand side of the page. Click that link and 
you will be taken to his or her Twitter page.
✓
✓Utilizing Twitter directory services: Some websites try to corral Twitter 
into a more organized place by grouping people who tweet into topic 
areas or based on the publication they work for. Muck Rack (www.
muckrack.com), for instance, categorizes all the writers and reporters 
of major publications who tweet so that you can find them. StockTwits 
(www.stocktwits.com) searches for tweets related to investing. 
StockTwits, for example, presents a list of all the ticker symbols at the 
top of the page that are being discussed most on Twitter.
✓
✓Understanding hashtags and dollar signs: Some tweets can easily get 
lost in the shuffle. To help tweets stand out, some include what are 
called hashtags, or keywords following a number sign. For instance, I 
might include #stocks or #investing in a tweet I send out. You can search 
for all tweets that have been tagged by typing #stocks or #investing into 
the search function at Twitter or by using the Twitter clients. Similarly, 
it’s become customary for investors to include a dollar sign followed by 
the ticker symbol of stocks they’re chatting about. You can search $GE 
on Twitter, for example, and see all the tweets about General Electric 
that other investors have designated using the GE with the dollar sign.
Getting a read on the market with Twitter
Whether you sign up for Twitter or not, just know there are millions of other 
investors who are on the service and constantly chattering about stocks. 
Other investors might be sharing information about stocks you own, and if 
you’re not part of the conversation, you might be missing out.
The problem with Twitter is separating the noise from truly useful information. 
And that’s why Twitter is increasingly becoming a tool for investors to take the 
temperature of the market and see what other people think about the market 
as a whole or individual stocks. Such aggregate data — or a summary of the 

188
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
bottom‐line wisdom of the crowd — can be even more useful than following 
individual people on Twitter.
Luckily, there are new services cropping up that allow you to get the bottom‐
line message on Twitter without doing much work.
Take Market Prophit (www.marketprophit.com) for example (see 
Figure 7‐4). The system scours Twitter and reads the millions of tweets 
about stocks and companies — so you don’t have to. Market Prophit has an 
algorithm that determines if a tweet is bullish or bearish and shows how the 
public is feeling about a particular stock or market. The service even sum-
marizes the stocks that the crowd on Twitter is most positive about — and 
the most negative on. You can also enter the name of a specific stock and 
get a rundown on what people are saying about it. You don’t need to follow 
the crowd when investing — usually it’s best if you don’t — but it’s handy to 
know what the vibe is.
Some online brokers, too, are trying to get into the action by adding tools 
that scan social media. TD Ameritrade (www.tdameritrade.com), for exam-
ple, added a Social Signals tab to its website that shows you recent tweets 
about stocks you own. TD Ameritrade’s Social Signals feature also tells you if 
investors on Twitter are positive or negative about a stock and which of the 
company’s brands are being discussed most.

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
It might be tempting to think Twitter is just a bunch of nonsense. And I’ll 
admit, much of it is. But increasingly much of the market’s banter, chatter, 
and discussion is moving to Twitter. And if you don’t pay attention, you can 
miss out on some valuable insights. Investors in Twitter stock, ironically, got 
a head’s up on a disappointing earnings release over Twitter itself. In April 
2015 at 3:19 p.m. ET, talk erupted on Twitter about the company acciden-
tally releasing a disappointing profit report. Shares of Twitter were trading 
for $50.06 when talk on Twitter erupted. Less than ten minutes later, trad-
ing in the stock was halted as regulators realized the company’s earnings 
release wasn’t released properly. Trading in Twitter shares was reopened 
at 3:47 p.m. and the stock dropped to $38.38. That means investors who 
caught the early warning on Twitter — and sold — saved themselves from a 
$7.6 billion loss.
Giving Facebook some face time
Like Twitter, Facebook is a general social networking site that was 
never designed as an online investing tool. But as the site develops and 
grows, more resources valuable to online investors are finding their way 
on Facebook.
Facebook is essentially a place for people and companies to tell the world 
a little about themselves. Everyone on Facebook gets a News Feed, which 
is a constantly updating lists of notes, photos, and music sent out by your 
friends. You can like other users on Facebook, or agree to share information, 
and then you’ll be notified of any new developments with them or be alerted 
of things they find to be of interest. You might choose to like other online 
investors so that you can trade tips and answers with them. You can also 
like different publications or companies like online brokerages, which will 
put new information that might be useful on your News Feed. You do this by 
indicating on Facebook that you like that particular publication or company, 
by clicking on the iconic Like button used by the site, which has the image of 
a thumbs up.
Getting your mug on Facebook
The best way to get started using Facebook is to sign up at the site’s own 
page, Facebook.com. Just go to the website (at, you guessed it, www.
facebook.com) and sign up. It’s free.
After you sign up, if you use your regular email address, odds are that 
some of your friends have already extended you invitations to friend them 
on Facebook.

Using Facebook for investing online
Facebook might not seem like a place where much business is taking place, 
and you’re largely right. Still, Facebook can offer some help to online inves-
tors, including the following:
✓
✓Keeping up with developments at your broker: It’s common for online 
brokerages to host a Facebook page, and if you indicate you like the 
brokerage, you’ll get a glimpse of what’s new at the firm. Some brokers 
make market commentary available to Facebook members who are its 
fans. Most of the major brokerages maintain pages on Facebook, includ-
ing Charles Schwab, Vanguard, E*TRADE, and TD Ameritrade.
It’s pretty easy to become a fan of a brokerage firm. After you’re logged 
on to Facebook, enter the online brokerage firm’s name into the search 
box at the top of the page and click the magnifying glass icon. You’ll see 
a link to the firm’s Facebook page. Just click the Like button, which has a 
thumbs up icon on it.
✓
✓Communicating with your broker and other customers: Sure, you 
could always pick up the phone and call your broker. But some online 
investors might want to connect in a more public and online way. For 
instance, you can either applaud or criticize items on the brokerage’s 
Facebook page and see whether any other customers agree with you.
✓
✓Having a conversation with other fans: Some online brokerages’ 
Facebook pages become a virtual water cooler for investors, usually 
those who are customers of that broker. Just look over the broker’s 
Facebook page, and you can see what others are chatting about, and 
even join the conversation.
The Brave New World: Social Networking 
Meets Online Investing
As the Internet grows up, it’s becoming clearer that the Internet is all about 
connecting people who might never have crossed paths in real life. Facebook 
has become the digital version of a backyard picnic and is the place for 
people to talk about what’s in and what’s not. YouTube lets anyone with a 
video camera film just about anything and share it with the world — making 
many a cat an overnight celebrity. Twitter allows everyone to share short 
bursts of information with a nearly unlimited number of people.
General social networking tools, like the ones discussed previously, have 
some applications for investors. But the technology of social networking 
continues to trickle into the investment world, and early signs seem promis-
ing. You find websites and services that apply social networking specifically 

191

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
to investors, in sites I refer to as social investing sites. Social investing sites 
answer some of the shortcomings of stock message boards and invest-
ment clubs.
Social investing sites as a higher form 
of stock message boards?
Social networking stands to be a major advance in how investors interface 
with each other. Unlike stock message boards, which cloak their users in ano-
nymity, social networking is based on posting actual trades and often even 
investors’ real names. And unlike simulations, which I discuss in Chapter 2, 
social investing sites are based on real trades with investors’ real money. The 
main advantages of this exciting new area of investing online are as follows:
✓
✓Showing what’s possible in the real world: Anyone can get lucky pick-
ing winning stocks with funny money. Social investing sites take away 
the fantasy aspect of simulations by encouraging users to disclose 
actual stocks they own and when they bought and sold them. You can 
use that information to determine who’s credible versus investors who 
talk a big game and those who might have ulterior motives.
✓
✓Separating the good from the bad: Social investing sites often let you 
know how often different members are right about their picks.
✓
✓Allowing investors to profit from others’ expertise: Social investing 
sites are designed to let investors who may not have the time to select 
investments to follow the moves made by investors who do.
✓
✓Providing some safeguards: Brokers operating social investing sites 
are overseen by securities regulators. Fraudsters know this and might 
avoid certain social investing sites because they could be easily tracked 
and monitored. It’s similar to how a bank robber might not target a bank 
that’s across the street from the police station.
Plugging into social investing sites
I discuss several popular social investing sites in the following list, but 
they all, at their core, work roughly the same. Follow these six steps to get 
involved in social investing:
1.	Pick a site.
Social investing sites are essentially gated communities of investors. You 
want to choose the site that fits you best and has a pool of investors you 
can identify with. I help you choose a site in the later section “Choosing 
a social investing site.”

192
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
2.	Register.
Most social investing sites require you to give more details about your-
self than some stock message boards do. That might be a slight burden 
at first, but it’s also one of the ways these sites eliminate users who 
insist on being cloaked in privacy.
3.	Create a profile.
Here you describe yourself, only giving details you’re comfortable shar-
ing with the rest of the social investing site. Typically, you might say 
how long you’ve been investing, what kind of investor you are, and what 
types of stocks you prefer.
4.	Enter your transactions.
The biggest thing that separates social investing sites from stock mes-
sage boards is that other users can see your real trades if you give per-
mission. That means you’ll need to import your trades or give the site 
permission to share them. Trades may be imported several ways, either 
manually by you or automatically when you enter an order to buy or sell 
shares with your online broker.
5.	Set your permissions.
Permissions are rules that tell the social investing site how much per-
sonal information you’re comfortable with sharing. You can choose to 
use a fake name, or handle, or reveal your real name. You can decide 
whether you’ll let other users look at your trades or send messages to 
you. This is an important step. The more information you reveal about 
yourself, the more credibility you’ll have on the site with other users.
Be careful about listening to stock tips and recommendations by social 
investing users who reveal very little personal information about them-
selves. These users might be cloaking themselves for the same reasons 
some investors are attracted to the anonymous world of stock mes-
sage boards.
6.	Look around.
After you’re set up with a profile, you can peruse the community to find 
people you might want to be “friends” with. These are investors you 
think are worthwhile listening to. You can also read other investors’ 
blogs (web logs), which are their personal narratives on how to invest.
Starting to get social: Trying social  
investing sites
Two types of social investing sites exist: stand‐alone sites and broker‐
operated sites. You need to decide which is better for you. The stand‐alone 
sites might appeal to you if you want to

193

 Chapter 7: Connecting with Other Investors Online
✓
✓Keep your social investing and brokerage accounts apart from 
each other
✓
✓Try out social investing with test trades before linking your real account
✓
✓Maintain your online accounts with traditional or discount online bro-
kerages that don’t offer social investing
✓
✓Use multiple online brokerage accounts and be able to pull in all your 
holdings and trades to one social investing site
You might think about signing up with your online broker’s social investing 
service for the following reasons:
✓
✓If you want to have your trades automatically shared with other users, 
after granting your permission
✓
✓If you don’t want to bother getting another username and password and 
trying to remember them
✓
✓If you feel that the other members of the brokerage firm have similar 
investing goals and styles as you do
Choosing a stand‐alone social 
investing site
After you’ve chosen whether you want to join a stand‐alone or broker‐
sponsored social investing site, it’s time to pick one. This is an emerging 
area, and new players will certainly be showing up, so be sure to search for 
new social investing sites that have started since this book was published.
Most online brokers don’t offer social investing capabilities, yet. If your 
broker hasn’t jumped on the social investing bandwagon yet, and you want 
to try it out, you might consider some of the dedicated social investing sites. 
These let you keep your existing brokerage account. Here are a few to try:
✓
✓Covestor (www.covestor.com): A stand‐alone social investing site 
that lets regular online investors follow the trades of experts. Covestor 
allows you to follow one of dozens of portfolio managers, who are pro-
fessional investors trading with actual money. Your money is invested 
along with the these portfolio managers’, so if he or she is successful, 
you’re successful. Be careful, though, because if your Model Manager 
hits a cold streak, your portfolio will suffer, too. Also, Covestor charges 
between 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent a year as a fee to participate.
✓
✓Collective2 (www.collective2.com): This site is like most other social 
investing sites in that it tracks and shares real trades. You can use the 
site to find a “trade leader," or one of tens of thousands of investment 
strategies. After you choose a trade leader you’re interested in, you 
hook it up to your actual online brokerage account. The system directly 

194
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
connects with a handful of brokers. When the traders running the 
system make trades, so do you. Fees vary wildly based on which system 
you choose and which brokerage you are using, but usually cost about 
$99 a month.
Turning to your broker for social investing
Online brokerages are in a strong position to take social investing to the next 
level because they can show when users put their money where their wallets 
are. If a user talks up a stock, the brokerage can show whether the person 
owns the stock. Two online brokerage firms, TradeKing and DittoTrade, have 
been the innovators in the area of social investing. Both offerings are very 
pioneering, and it will be interesting to see whether other online broker-
ages follow suit and add social networking to their sites, too. Here are the 
details on each:
✓
✓Ditto Trade (www.dittotrade.com): Unlike the brokers bolting on 
social investing capabilities, Ditto Trade was created at the beginning 
with the sole purpose of providing social investing capabilities. The site 
is organized around what Ditto Trade calls Lead Traders. Lead Traders 
are people running real portfolios that other investors can follow. If the 
lead trader makes a trade, with your permission, that same trade is made 
in the correct proportion in your account. You can either follow a Lead 
Trader or, if you’re a successful investor and others want to follow you, 
you can sign up with Ditto Trade to be a Lead Trader yourself. Keep in 
mind, though, that you’ll pay Ditto Trade’s $6.95‐a‐trade commission every 
time you, or your Lead Trader, makes a trade that you agree to follow.
Ditto Trade has a similar investment philosophy as Covestor, the idea 
that some investors want to lead and others follow. But each service 
charges its users very differently, as described previously. You need to 
figure out if you’ll get a better deal paying Covestor’s fees or if the com-
mission structure at Ditto Trade makes more sense for you.
✓
✓TradeKing (www.tradeking.com/why‐tradeking/online‐trading‐ 
network): TradeKing is an online brokerage that offers social investing. 
The online brokerage, discussed more fully in Chapter 4, lets its inves-
tors interact with each other. You can decide how much information, if 
any, you choose to share with other members. Oftentimes, you might 
just begin with a profile page and, after you get more comfortable, begin 
sharing more — including your trades. TradeKing makes it easy to find 
the honest investors by giving them Certified status. These are investors 
who are most forthright and open with their real‐life investing activity.
You don’t have to have a brokerage account to take advantage of the 
community site. But if you don’t, remember that other TradeKing users 
probably won’t take you all that seriously because they can’t see your 
real‐life trades. You can read more about how TradeKing ranks as an 
online broker in Chapter 4.

t’s surprising how many investors keep buying and selling stocks online 
even when they have no idea whether they’re beating the market. They’ll 
brag at cocktail parties about the winning stocks they’ve bought. But if you 
ask them what their rate of return is, they’ll look at you blankly. Most online 
brokers don’t help either, because many don’t have tools that accurately 
measure your returns.
To me, investing online without knowing how you’re doing is like driving 
with your eyes closed. As an online investor, it’s pretty much up to you to 
calculate your own returns. To help you get back in control, this chapter first 
shows you how to manually calculate your returns and how much risk you’ve 
taken to get those returns. In case you want more handholding, I then discuss 
online sites and software that do all the calculations for you. Either way you 
choose, you’ll be miles ahead of other investors who keep investing without 
knowing whether they’re successful.
The Importance of Tracking  
Your Performance
You learn from an early age to monitor your progress with most things. As a 
baby, your height and weight were plotted on charts to illustrate how quickly 
you were growing and how your size ranked with other infants. In school, 
your progress was constantly monitored using letter grades and tests. And 
at work, annual reviews and pay often reflect the job you’re doing and show 
what’s working and what’s not.

196
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
That’s why it’s so strange that many people don’t monitor their investment 
performance. Investors often look through their portfolios, see a few stocks 
that are up since they bought them, and assume that they’re beating the 
stock market.
Psychology plays a big part in investing. Many online investors tend to get 
overly confident if they’ve recently picked a few lucky stocks. That prompts 
them to take more uncalculated risks in the future, which might cost them 
dearly. Investors also tend to wipe out painful losses from their memories. 
They remember only the winners. And other investors beat themselves 
up for losing money on a stock, blaming something that had nothing to do 
with the loss. By measuring your performance, you can try to remove some 
of the emotion from investing. (Morningstar, the independent investment 
research outfit, has a great little lesson on how human nature can affect your 
success investing online; check out http://news.morningstar.com/
classroom2/printlesson.asp?docId=145104&CN=com).
I suspect most folks don’t bother monitoring their investment performance 
because it requires some math and a few scary‐looking formulas that most 
investors don’t understand. This chapter, though, demystifies how to track 
your portfolio’s risk and return. I start by showing you how to do the calcula-
tions yourself.
It’s important for you to understand how all the calculations are done so that 
you don’t blindly rely on websites to do it for you, but I also know that not 
everyone has the time or the willingness to crunch performance stats. And 
that’s why I include online tools that do the math for you. If you get confused 
at any point in this section about calculating performance manually, don’t 
dismay. Just skip ahead to the section “Using Online Tools to Calculate Your 
Performance.”
Why it’s worth the trouble  
to measure your returns
Studies have shown that people who regularly weigh themselves tend to have 
more success reaching their fitness goals. It’s similar with investing online. 
If you take the time to measure your results, you’ll likely be a better inves-
tor. After all, even if your investments aren’t doing well, if you track your 
performance, you might be able to adjust your strategy. Some investors, for 
instance, might find that constantly buying and selling stocks isn’t working 
for them. These investors can adjust accordingly and might find more suc-
cess being passive investors. (You can review the difference between active 
and passive investors in Chapter 1.)

197

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
If you take the time to measure your performance, you’ll be able to figure out 
whether you’re going to do the following:
✓
✓Reach your financial goals: When you invest, you typically estimate the 
rate of return you need to reach your goal, such as funding retirement or 
paying for college. By tracking your returns, you can see whether you’re 
on the right path. And if you’re not, you can consider ways to improve 
your results, including changing your asset allocation. I discuss how to 
design the right asset allocation for you in Chapter 9.
One of the first things you should do before you start investing is to 
decide how much risk you can tolerate and what rate of return you need 
to meet your goal. You can find out how to do this in Chapter 1.
✓
✓Hurt yourself more than help: If you’re an active investor who’s con-
stantly buying and selling stocks, you might be wasting your time and 
hurting your portfolio. If you find that your returns are lower than what 
you could get by just buying an index mutual fund, you might be better 
served by following a more passive approach.
✓
✓Find your mistakes: You might have a good investment plan that’s work-
ing, except for a few investments or stocks that are killing your perfor-
mance. By tracking your results, you can find what’s hurting you and 
make adjustments if needed.
Curious what the top mistakes investors make might be? Check 
out https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/investor/
Documents/twenty_common_mistakes.pdf, where the CFA Institute 
has posted a list of the 20 most common mistakes individual inves-
tors make. It was compiled by professional money managers. You can 
also find my own take on the top ten mistakes made by investors in 
Chapter 17.
Why you want to measure your risk, too
I can’t tell you how many investors ask me for “ten stocks to buy now.” 
Investors get so obsessed with the potential return for winning stocks that 
they forget the other side of the picture: the risk. After all, you can get a great 
return by putting all your chips on black at the roulette table. But are you 
willing to risk it all? By measuring how much risk you’re taking on with your 
investment, you’ll know whether you are
✓
✓Getting adequate returns: When you invest in a savings account, you’re 
not taking any risk, so you shouldn’t expect a giant return. But if you 
invest in a risky stock, you should demand to be compensated with a 
bigger return. If you’re not, you’re being shortchanged.

198
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓Invested properly: Some investors aren’t matched up with their invest-
ments very well. If you’re risk‐adverse and can’t stomach it when your 
portfolio falls just 5 percent in value in a year, you shouldn’t be invested 
in risky stocks that go up and down wildly. You might consider changing 
what types of investment you own so that you can smooth the bumps. 
This is done by creating your asset allocation. (You find out how to use 
online tools to create a portfolio that fits your personality in Chapter 9.)
✓
✓Prepared for volatility: If you know how risky your investments are 
ahead of time, you won’t be surprised when the value of your account 
swings up and down. That foresight can help stop you from doing some-
thing in haste you’ll regret, such as selling all your stocks in panic.
To get higher returns, you must accept more risk. Return and risk are tied at 
the hip. However, investing in a risky asset doesn’t always mean that you’ll 
get a higher return. As you find out in Chapter 9, many risky assets have 
generated poor returns over the years. You want to avoid these investments 
because they’re bum deals.
Calculating Your Performance Yourself
If websites and software programs can calculate your portfolio’s risk and 
return for you, why bother learning to do it yourself? I’ve found that many of 
the automated ways of calculating performance use slightly different meth-
ods, so you’re not always clear what’s going on. And with something this 
important, you don’t want to rely solely on a website that might or might not 
be accurate. If you know how performance is measured and can approximate 
your performance yourself, you’ll know whether you’re getting the right infor-
mation from the automated tools.
If you don’t care to know how portfolio returns are measured and just want 
to do it online, go to MoneyChimp’s Portfolio Performance Calculator (www.
moneychimp.com/features/portfolio_performance_calculator.
htm). It automatically calculates your portfolio’s return if you enter your 
portfolio’s beginning and ending balance and indicate whether you deposited 
or withdrew money.
The easiest way to calculate returns
If you haven’t deposited money into or taken any money out of your broker-
age account, it’s relatively easy to measure your rate of return for the year. 
Just follow these steps:

199

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
1.	Get your account balance at the end of the year and write it down.
You can get your year‐end balance from your online broker’s website or 
from a printed statement.
2.	Get your account balance at the end of the previous year and write it 
down.
Again, this information is available from your broker’s website or from a 
printed statement.
3.	Subtract the answer in Step 2 from the answer in Step 1. Divide that 
difference by the answer in Step 2, and then multiply by 100.
Say your portfolio was worth $10,000 on December 31, 2013, and it was 
worth $12,000 on December 31, 2014. You would subtract $10,000 from 
$12,000 and get $2,000. Divide $2,000 by $10,000 and multiply by 100, 
and the answer is 20 percent. You earned a 20 percent rate of return in 
that year.
Don’t worry about dividends and splits when using this approach. And don’t 
concern yourself if you’ve bought or sold stocks. As long as your dividends 
and sale proceeds go into the brokerage account, this way of calculating your 
return reflects all these things.
An easy way to calculate returns if you’ve 
deposited or taken out money
You’re probably already asking the logical question: What if you deposited 
money into or withdrew money from your brokerage account? It complicates 
things a bit, but it’s still not hard. There’s an easy way to calculate your 
return when you have deposits to or withdrawals from your account.
Say your portfolio was worth $10,000 on December 31, 2013, and it was worth 
$12,000 on December 31, 2014. But you made the following withdrawals and 
deposits to your account, as shown in Table 8‐1.

Okay, time to start crunching some numbers:
1.	Get your account balance at the end of the previous year.
Using my example, you’d write down $10,000, which was your balance 
on December 31, 2013.
2.	Get your account balance at the end of the current year.
You’d write down $12,000, which was your supposed balance at the 
end of 2014.
3.	Add all the money you’ve added to your account during the year.
In my example, you’d write down $2,000 ($1,000 from March 20 plus 
$1,000 from October 1).
Only include fresh money you’ve deposited into your account. Don’t 
include dividends that were paid.
4.	Add up all the money you’ve withdrawn from your account during 
the year.
In my example, you’d write down $500. That’s the only withdrawal you 
supposedly made.
Include just withdrawals from the account or checks you have written 
on the account. Do not include stocks you’ve sold if you left the pro-
ceeds in your account.
5.	Subtract the answer in Step 4 from the answer in Step 3. Divide the 
result by 2 and write down the answer.
In my example, you’d write down $1,500. You’d get that by subtracting 
the $500 in supposed withdrawals from the $2,000 in supposed deposits. 
Divide the answer, $1,500, by 2.
6.	Add the answer in Step 5 to the number in Step 1.
You’d write down $10,750. You’d get that by adding $750 to the number 
in Step 1.
7.	Subtract the answer in Step 5 from the number in Step 2.
You’d write down $11,250. That’s $12,000 minus $750.
8.	Subtract the answer in Step 6 from the answer in Step 7.
You’d write down $500. That’s $11,250 minus $10,750.
9.	Divide the answer in Step 8 by the answer in Step 6 and multiply 
by 100.
You’d get your 4.7 percent rate of return by dividing $500 by $10,750 
and multiplying by 100.

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
You might want to calculate how your portfolio is doing before the end of the 
year. For instance, in June, you might want to get your mid‐year performance. 
That’s no problem. Just use the value of your portfolio at any date in the year 
in Step 2. All the formulas remain the same.
The hardest way to calculate returns
The methods of calculating your returns described in the preceding sec-
tions can get you accurate measures of your rate of return. But, as you can 
imagine, there’s always a way to measure returns even more precisely. Some 
mutual funds, for instance, use a complicated calculation called the dollar‐
weighted return or internal rate of return. This requires advanced computing 
that’s beyond the scope of this book. I show you some websites in this chap-
ter, though, that have computerized performance tracking tools that can 
measure your internal rate of return for you.
You can find out more about different methods of calculating portfolio 
returns at the following sites:

Calculating How Risky Your Portfolio Is
The returns you get from investing online are only half of what you need to 
know. Just as important, if not more so, is how much risk you took on to get 
those returns. Measuring risk is a little more controversial. You find many 
ways to do it, and investors generally disagree on the best way.
Most investment professionals, though, acknowledge the value of measuring 
risk by studying its standard deviation. Yikes, that’s a scary term and one that 
might conjure up memories of statistics class. But by using readily available 
online tools, you can use standard deviation as a way to get a handle on how 
much risk you’re accepting in investing. Standard deviation is a mathemati-
cal way to determine how much your portfolio swings in value from its aver-
age return.
Just know this: When your portfolio’s standard deviation is a large number, 
you’ll probably see some big ups and downs in your portfolio’s value. And 
when the standard deviation is low, you have a good idea that your portfolio 
won’t keep you up at night.
Statistics tell us that 68 percent of the time, your portfolio should not rise by 
more than its average return (plus the standard deviation) or fall more than 
its average return (minus the standard deviation). And 95 percent of the time, 
your portfolio shouldn’t rise by more than its average return plus two times 
its standard deviation or fall by more than its average return minus two times 
its standard deviation.
For example, if you put your money in a five‐year certificate of deposit that 
pays 5 percent interest, the standard deviation of your return would be 0. In 
other words, you will get 5 percent a year no matter what. But if you invest in 
a risky stock that returns 15 percent a year on average, your standard devia-
tion might be closer to 40. That means 68 percent of the time you can expect 
your portfolio to be up 55 percent (the 15 percent average return plus the 
standard deviation) or down 25 percent (the 15 percent average return minus 
the standard deviation).
A simple way of calculating  
your average return
Before you can measure how risky your portfolio is, you must first calculate 
its average yearly return. Earlier in the chapter, you found out how to cal-
culate your portfolio’s annual returns. Next, you need to use those annual 
returns to measure your portfolio’s average annual return. You can do this 
easily by taking all your annual returns, calculated using the directions in the 
earlier sections, and analyzing them.

203

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
After you calculate your portfolio’s annual returns for each year, you should 
write them down or put them in a spreadsheet. I use the returns listed in 
Table 8‐2 as an example.
If the returns above look familiar, they should. Those are the annual returns 
of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which tracks large company stocks, over 
the past five years. Just look at those numbers. Can you say volatile? The fact 
that the market goes up or down so much in a year is why investors look at 
long‐term average returns to create a sane plan for their portfolios.
How do you measure your average return? You can’t just take a simple aver-
age by adding up all the returns and dividing by five. Doing that will give 
you the wrong answer. Instead, you must calculate the geometric mean. The 
geometric mean is the way to correctly measure stock return, trust me. I 
could explain the technical difference between simple averages and geomet-
ric means, but we’ll both get headaches for no good reason. If you’re truly 
curious, Deborah Rumsey does a nice job explaining it in her Statistics For 
Dummies (published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
If you don’t want to go to the trouble of measuring geometric mean as I 
describe shortly, the Average Return Calculator at Hugh’s Mortgage and 
Financial Calculators (www.hughchou.org/calc/areturn.php) can do 
it for you. Just enter your returns for each year, and the site calculates the 
geometric mean or what it calls the “true average return.” Easy Calculation 
(www.easycalculation.com/statistics/geometric‐mean.php) can 
also calculate the geometric mean.
You can calculate geometric means using a financial calculator or a spread-
sheet. But this is Investing Online For Dummies, right? So, I show you how to 
do it online by using the Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator that you see in 
Figure 8‐1 (available at www.graftacs.com/geomean.php3).

Before you rush and type in the returns from Table 8‐2 into Horton’s 
Geometric Mean Calculator, you need to follow an additional step. Horton’s 
Geometric Mean Calculator can’t handle negative numbers. I know you don’t 
think you’ll ever have a negative return, but just in case, I show you what to 
do. Just add 100 to each of the returns, giving you what you see in Table 8‐3.
Enter those returns into the blanks in Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator 
labeled Point 1, Point 2, and so on. After you have entered the returns, scroll

the geometric mean is 115.46. You just subtract 100 from 115.46, and you find 
out your portfolio has a geometric mean gain of 15.5 percent.
If you’d rather measure your portfolio’s geometric return in a spreadsheet, 
Microsoft Excel has a GEOMEAN function that can do it for you. And if you 
don’t have Microsoft Excel, you can download a fairly capable spread-
sheet program for free. It’s called OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org). 
And although it’s not as slick as Excel, it’s hard to argue with the price. 
(OpenOffice’sCalc spreadsheet program calls its function the GEOMEAN func-
tion as well.)
Calculating your risk
If you used Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator to measure your portfolio’s 
average return, you’ve also measured your risk. At the top of the page, right 
below the geometric mean, is the risk, or standard deviation. In this example, 
the standard deviation of the portfolio is 10.82 percentage points, as shown 
in Figure 8‐2.
Microsoft Excel has a function that measures risk. The STDEV function can 
measure the standard deviation of returns that you enter.
Standard deviation works best as a measure of risk if you have many years 
of data to study. If you’ve been investing for only a few months or years, 
you can convert your quarterly results into a yearly or annualized number. 
Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/articles/04/021804.asp) 
shows you how to do this. If all this seems like too much effort, just use the 
online risk‐measurement tools that I describe a little later in this chapter.

What does it all mean?  
Sizing up your portfolio
You did it. You measured your portfolio’s average return and risk. Now what? 
You can start by shopping for a new pocket protector. But then, you’ll need 
to compare your portfolio’s risk and return with another investment so that 
you can put it into perspective. You can see how your performance stacks 
up by comparing it with a benchmark called an index. An index is a basket of 
stocks used to measure your success. If your portfolio’s risk is higher than 
the index’s risk, make sure that you’re also getting a higher return.
Chapter 2 describes most of the popular market indexes. The Standard & 
Poor’s 500, due to its general acceptance and the fact it closely tracks the 
stock market, is the most common index used to size up investors’ returns. 
If you want to compare your portfolio’s risk and return to the S&P 500 for 
the same time period, you can download the S&P’s annual returns from 
Standard & Poor’s by first going to this page — http://us.spindices.
com/indices/equity/sp‐500 — and then clicking the blue Additional Info 
button. From the menu that appears, choose the Monthly and Annual Returns 
option. The site opens a spreadsheet. Click the Annual Total Returns tab and 
enter those returns into Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator. The result you 
get is the S&P 500’s risk and return for the same years.
If you want an easier way to compare returns, you can see how your portfolio 
fared relative to the long‐term returns of major types of investments, such as 
the ones shown in Table 8‐4.
Are your returns lower than the long‐term returns on the S&P 500? If so, make 
sure that your risk is lower too. You can read the definitions of corporate 
bonds — and different types of Treasurys called Treasury bonds, Treasury 
notes, and Treasury bills — in Chapter 16.

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
Finding other things to compare  
your returns to
You don’t have to compare your stock portfolio to the S&P 500. Investors 
commonly choose different indexes to compare their performance to. It’s 
important to rank yourself against the right index to get a good understand-
ing of how you’re truly performing. For instance, if you want to know how fast 
your sports car is, you’d compare it with another sports car, not an economy 
car. You can benchmark your returns against
✓
✓More specific indexes: If you’re investing mainly in small‐company 
stocks, you should compare your results against an index that tracks 
small‐company stocks. iShares’ Index Returns Chart (http://
us.ishares.com/tools/index_tracker.htm) is a colorful and 
easy‐to‐use way to find out how specific areas of the market have per-
formed. You can track stocks of different sizes, sectors, industries, 
regions, countries, and commodities. You can also measure different 
time frames, such as five days or five years.
Russell’s Index Returns Calculator (www.russell.com/Indexes/
performance/calculator/calculator.asp) can also help you do 
this. You can download a series of annual returns from many types of 
stocks, including large‐company stocks (measured by the Russell 1000) 
and small‐company stocks (measured by the Russell 2000) going back 20 
years. You can then enter those returns into Horton’s Geometric Mean 
calculator and see how your portfolio stacks up.
Some investors choose to slice the market even more finely when select-
ing a benchmark. For instance, if you invest mainly in large, undervalued 
stocks, you would want to compare your performance to a large value 
index that holds similar stocks. Undervalued stocks have share prices 
that are below what a company is really worth.
✓
✓A basket of index mutual funds: Index Funds Advisors (www.ifa.com/
portfolios) has created a number of portfolios of index mutual funds 
that can be used as benchmarks. The IFA portfolios are excellent bench-
marks because they are passive index funds designed to deliver the opti-
mum return for the risk taken. You can see where your portfolio would 
fit on the risk‐and‐reward chart. You also find a risk‐and‐return calculator 
(www.ifa.com/portfolios/PortReturnCalc/index.aspx) that 
you can use to see what the IFA portfolios have done between specific 
time periods. If you’re getting lower returns for higher risk, you might 
consider switching to a more passive investment strategy. Table 8‐5 
shows a sample of some of the returns over the past 20 years.

Using Online Tools to Calculate 
Your Performance
If you understand the inherent value of tracking your portfolio’s performance 
but maybe the math involved is just too onerous, you’ve come to the right 
section of this chapter. Here, I show you automated tools that can crunch 
your performance numbers for you. You find three main advantages to letting 
your computer do the heavy lifting in measuring performance:
✓
✓Ease: All you have to do is enter your trades, and the computer does the 
rest. You don’t need to look up formulas. You also don’t risk making a 
mistake in the calculations.
✓
✓Speed: The calculations are already programmed in, so after the data is 
entered, the system can spit out your performance. You don’t need to 
fire up a calculator.
✓
✓Customization: You can tinker and have the system calculate what your 
performance would have been, for instance, if you didn’t have that one 
stinker in your portfolio.
Completely relying on online tools to tell you something as important as your 
portfolio’s risk and return isn’t ideal. Different sites might use different meth-
odologies, and it might be difficult to find out what precisely is being mea-
sured. With that said, it’s better to rely on online tools than to not measure 
your portfolio’s risk and return at all.
Looking at online performance‐
measurement tools
Because many new investors are just now getting interested in tracking their 
performance, a flurry of new tools is now promising to do the job. They gen-
erally fall into these four categories:

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
✓
✓Financial software: This is software you install on your computer that 
crunches the math. It includes personal finance software (discussed in 
Chapter 1), which contains performance‐tracking capabilities. You also 
find specialized software designed just to track returns.
✓
✓Online stock simulations and social investing sites: Most of the stock 
simulation sites (discussed in Chapter 2) and social investing sites (dis-
cussed in Chapter 7) have adequate performance‐measurement capabili-
ties. I single out a few in this chapter.
✓
✓Portfolio‐tracking sites: These services allow you to enter your stock 
holdings and help measure your returns. Portfolio‐tracking sites are kind 
of like Swiss Army knives: They feature a variety of portfolio‐tracking 
tools in addition to measuring your portfolio’s returns. Many portfolio‐
tracking sites, for instance, alert you if a stock is about to pay a dividend 
or provide links to online news stories about stocks you own.
✓
✓Performance‐tracking websites: These websites are designed with 
the express purpose of tracking portfolio performance. Because 
performance‐tracking sites focus on performance tracking, they tend to 
give a great deal of information on your portfolio’s risk and return and 
are very precise and exacting.
Using personal finance and performance‐
tracking software
If you choose to go the software route, it stands to reason that you’re going 
to be buying and/or downloading software and installing it on your PC. This 
software runs on your computer and crunches your returns, and sometimes 
your risk, too. Examples include the following:
✓
✓Intuit’s Quicken (www.quicken.com): A major player in the financial 
software field, Quicken has advanced investing functions that moni-
tor all your portfolio returns. What makes Quicken unique is that it 
measures the expected risk, or standard deviation, of your portfolio in 
addition to returns. Quicken compares your portfolio’s risk with the 
risk of different benchmarks, including small and large stocks. You can 
access this feature within Quicken by choosing the Portfolio Analyzer 
feature on the Investing menu option. You may have to activate the 
“Classic Menus” first, which is located under the “edit” menu option. 
See Chapter 1 for more information on Quicken. There’s also a feature in 
Quicken that lets you put your portfolio online so you can check it from 
any computer with an Internet connection.

210

✓
✓Quant IX Software’s Investment Account Manager (www.
investmentaccountmanager.com): Quant IX’s entrant in the 
financial software market is an advanced software program designed to 
meticulously track your portfolio’s returns. You enter your transactions, 
and the software does the rest with a great level of precision. The 
software costs $109, which includes one year of online access to 
stock data.
✓
✓Analyze Now! (www.analyzenow.com): Technically, Analyze Now! 
doesn’t offer a software program; rather, it provides you with a collec-
tion of free spreadsheets that can help you calculate everything you 
need. The Estate & Investment Manager spreadsheet not only calculates 
your annual returns but also helps you optimize your tax strategy and 
pick the right type of brokerage account. The Free Return Calculator 
calculates your portfolio returns even if you moved money in and out of 
your account. Click the Computer Programs link on the left side of the 
website to download the spreadsheets.
✓
✓Spreadsheet plug‐ins: If you’re already a spreadsheet jockey and want to 
track your performance that way, you need a way to pull current stock 
quotes into your spreadsheet.
The QMatix XLQ plug‐in (www.qmatix.com/XLQ.htm) pulls both cur-
rent and historical stock quotes into Excel. But the QMatix XLQ Lite soft-
ware costs you $149, and other data‐access charges might apply.
Using stock simulation and social 
investing sites
Most stock simulation and social investing sites offer performance‐tracking 
tools. I describe stock simulations in Chapter 2 as a way to get your feet wet 
by choosing stocks and investing online. And I cover social investing sites 
in Chapter 7 as a way to connect with other investors. The performance‐
tracking capabilities of these sites are noteworthy, including the following:
✓
✓NinjaTrader (www.ninjatrader.com): This site’s trading simulator 
allows you to practice trading using digital funny money. But it also 
gives you access to the site’s performance section, which lets you 
see how your portfolio did during different timeframes. It’s definitely 
designed with very advanced active traders in mind and could very 
well be overkill if you just want to see how your buy‐and‐hold portfo-
lio is doing.
✓
✓Covestor (www.covestor.com): In addition to helping investors find 
professional investors who have performed well, Covestor also has an 
impressive performance‐tracking tool. It’s one of the few social investing 
sites that measures both risk and return.

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
Online brokers are so competitive that they often look at what others are 
doing and match it. Be sure to check with all the online brokers to see 
whether they have added any portfolio performance‐tracking tools.
Using portfolio‐tracking websites
Just about all the sites that track market information, which I describe in 
Chapter 2, contain portfolio trackers. These sites allow you to enter your 
holdings or transactions and then sit back, waiting for them to tell you how 
much your stocks are up or down for the day and year. Several, includ-
ing Yahoo! Finance, let you download your portfolio into a spreadsheet. 
Portfolio‐tracking sites do many things in addition to measuring performance. 
Still, some of these portfolio‐tracking sites can also have advanced capabili-
ties, including the following:
✓
✓Morningstar.com (www.morningstar.com): Morningstar has a stand-
out portfolio tracker because it tells you more than just whether your 
stocks went up or down for the day or year. You start by signing into 
Morningstar. Next, if you click the My Performance tab for your portfo-
lio, you can see how its value has changed over the past 12 months, as 
well as in each of the past 10 years. Morningstar can also email you each 
day, telling you how your portfolio did, or send you alerts when a stock 
moves up or down 10 percent in a day or a mutual fund you own got a 
new manager. The Portfolio X‐Ray feature applies advanced statistics 
techniques to see whether your portfolio fits your needs. Morningstar 
can import an existing portfolio you might have saved at Yahoo! Finance, 
or using personal finance software. The Portfolio X‐Ray feature, though, 
is available only to subscribers to Morningstar’s premium service, which 
costs $199 a year.
✓
✓Personal Capital (www.personalcapital.com): Personal Capital 
attempts to give online investors the same powerful portfolio track-
ing tools on the web that they’ve had in software, such as Intuit’s 
Quicken. In fact, Personal Capital was developed by several former Intuit 
employees. You can sign up for the service for free, and it will import 
all your portfolio information from various brokerage firms. Personal 
Capital’s performance tracking tools are some of the most powerful on 
the Internet. There are also mobile apps if that’s more your speed. You 
will, though, need to trust the site enough to provide your brokerage 
account’s log‐on information. Also, while the site is free, you may be con-
tacted by a financial advisor who works with Personal Capital to inquire 
if you’re interested in paying a fee to get some financial handholding.
✓
✓SigFig (www.sigfig.com): SigFig is trying to upgrade the experience 
of tracking stock portfolios online. The site’s Portfolio Tracker offers 
robust tools that allow you to enter your portfolio information yourself, 
or if you’re comfortable sharing your online log‐on information, to down

load your portfolio information from your brokerages. You can slice and 
dice your portfolio performance in a variety of ways to get a handle on 
how you’re doing. The service is free to use. It will make suggestions on 
ways that you might optimize your portfolio, and if you take the advice, 
the site may get fees from the service providers.
✓
✓StockSelector.com (www.stockselector.com): A free portfolio service 
for the more active trader, StockSelector.com provides ample links to all 
sorts of company news and other data designed to help you buy and sell 
stocks. StockSelector routinely spotlights specific stocks its members 
are paying attention to, such as the Top Ranked Stock, which is available 
near the top of its main web page.
✓
✓Mint.com (www.mint.com): Intuit’s online Mint.com website is geared 
mainly toward helping consumers save money. But you also find a basic 
portfolio‐tracking feature that can size up your portfolio and see how 
you’re doing relative to the broad stock market. Mint’s portfolio‐tracking 
features aren’t as powerful as Quicken’s, but the site is free.
✓
✓Yodlee MoneyCenter (https://yodleemoneycenter.com/apps/
mfaregistration.retailpv.do?_flowId=mfaregistration): 
Yodlee is the company that provides the heavy‐duty calculations that 
many online brokers use to power their sites. Yodlee MoneyCenter pro-
vides many of the same portfolio‐tracking tools to you, no matter who 
your brokerage firm is or even if you don’t have a brokerage. And it’s 
free. If you are with an online brokerage firm, Yodlee MoneyCenter can 
automatically download your portfolio so that you don’t have to type 
anything in.
Using performance‐analytics websites
Performance‐tracking websites focus on measuring how your portfolio is 
doing. These sites provide much more detail about your portfolio’s risk and 
return than general portfolio‐tracking websites. They take the mathematics 
seriously and explain exactly how they’re getting the numbers they are get-
ting. But best of all, their computers do the work so that you don’t have to. 
Sites to check out include the following:
✓
✓Macroaxis (www.macroaxis.com): If you want to put your portfolio 
through the paces and really see how it’s performing, this site is for you. 
The free site runs your portfolio through mean variance optimization, 
a complicated analysis that precisely measures how much risk you’re 
taking and what kind of return you’re getting as a reward. The site also 
tells you whether your portfolio is correctly constructed to make sure 
that you’re getting the payback you deserve for the risk you’re taking.

213

 Chapter 8: Measuring Your Performance
✓
✓Profitspi (www.profitspi.com): This site lets you enter your trades 
and quickly calculates your returns. You can sort your stocks to see 
which ones are performing the best and instantly compare your results 
to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and Standard & Poor’s 
500. You can also download the results to a spreadsheet.
✓
✓Icarra (www.icarra.com): Icarra is primarily a sophisticated 
performance‐tracking site that has social investing aspects. It’s one of 
the few free sites that can calculate your returns similarly to how mutual 
funds track their performance — by using the advanced internal rate‐of‐
return method that I describe earlier in this chapter. Icarra.com also lets 
you benchmark your performance against several major market indexes. 
You can share your performance with other users if you choose.
✓
✓Portfoliomonkey (https://www.portfoliomonkey.com): You can 
enter all your stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs, and Portfoliomonkey will 
analyze the portfolio. After some number crunching, the site tells you 
how risky your portfolio is and how well your different investments 
work together. The site is free, but asks users who like the service to 
donate to keep the lights on.
By measuring your portfolio’s risk and return, you’re already miles ahead 
of many other online investors. You have the know‐how to tweak and refine 
your investments to make sure that you get the optimal return for the risk 
you’re taking.

ou wouldn’t sail a ship without a map or bake a cake without a recipe, 
but so many online investors do the equivalent when they buy and sell 
stocks and other assets without understanding how they fit into a broader 
plan. That plan, in investment language, is called an asset allocation. Your 
asset allocation determines how much of your portfolio is placed into differ-
ent types of asset classes, or types of investments — typically stocks, bonds, 
and cash. By following this plan, you can make sure that you get the maxi-
mum return for the amount of risk you’re taking. One controversial study 
even claims more than 90 percent of a portfolio’s swings, on average, is due 
to the asset allocation.
In this chapter, I show you how an asset allocation plan can improve your 
success investing online. You also find out how to build your ideal asset allo-
cation using online tools to help you find an allocation that’s right for you.
The Recipe for Your Online Investing: 
Asset Allocation
Many investors make the mistake of chasing random stocks they hear about, 
buying them, and throwing them into their portfolios. They pick up stock 
tips from TV and neighbors and blindly invest. Some of these investors wind 
up owning so many stocks that they have an unmanageable portfolio, which 
generates disappointing returns. Others try to be more selective and invest 
in just a few stocks they think are promising, but they later find out that their 
portfolios are too risky for their taste.

216
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
The answer is simple: Approach investing like a chef with a recipe in hand. 
Rather than tossing all sorts of ingredients into your portfolio pot and guess-
ing what it will taste like, it’s best to know what needs to go into the pot to 
get what you want. In investing, this plan is called an asset allocation.
An asset allocation might be general and tell you what percentage of holdings 
to put in stocks, how much in bonds, and how much in cash. But it can also 
get more detailed and exotic, calling for a dash of large U.S. company stocks, 
a pinch of international stocks, and just a touch of bonds.
Asset allocations are designed to let all the investments in your portfolio 
blend together into a stew that will be most likely to generate the highest 
possible return for the lowest amount of risk.
The advantages of creating and sticking with an asset allocation include
✓
✓Diversification: Hands down, diversification is the biggest advantage of 
having an asset allocation. An asset allocation calls for certain percent-
ages of your portfolio to be in certain investments. For instance, you 
might put 70 percent in stocks and 30 percent in bonds. You want your 
investments to be spread into different investments that tend to move 
up and down at different times. That will hold the value of your total 
portfolio steady — and reduce risk — over time.
✓
✓Rebalancing: A great way to boost your returns without taking on 
additional risk, rebalancing pretty much does what the term implies. 
Periodically, one group of investments in your asset allocation will fall 
in value. Stocks might fall and bonds rally, for instance. When that hap-
pens, the percentage of your portfolio in stocks will fall below your plan 
and the percentage in bonds will rise. To stick to your allocation and 
maintain the percentages, you need to buy more of the investments that 
have fallen in value and sell those that have gained. And when you do 
that, you will be buying investments when they’re cheaper and selling 
them when they get pricier, which isn’t a bad strategy.
✓
✓Discipline: Staying in control is priceless with online investing. Because 
trading online is so inexpensive and easy, it’s tempting to chase after 
popular stocks that are in the news or new investments other inves-
tors are talking about. Many of those investments end up disappointing 
investors, though, because they’re overvalued. I explain how to measure 
a stock’s valuation in Chapter 13, but if you stick with your asset alloca-
tion, you can avoid this pain.
What’s so great about diversification?
If you were to design the perfect portfolio, you’d certainly want the maximum 
returns for the least amount of risk. The way you do this is by diversifying, 

217

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
or spreading your risk over a wide swath of investments. This certainly can 
reduce risk, which I define in Chapter 8 as standard deviation.
A high standard deviation means that the portfolio is riskier, and a low stan-
dard deviation means that it’s less risky.
The first aspect of diversification is the idea of safety in numbers. As you add 
more stocks to your portfolio, you reduce the odds that a vicious decline in 
any one stock will depth‐charge your portfolio.
Before you rush out and buy thousands of stocks, though, you need to be 
aware of two things. First, your portfolio’s risk falls by smaller amounts as 
you add stocks. For instance, the reduction of risk when you go from 30 
stocks to 40 is less impressive than when you go from one stock to two.
Also, before you start buying every stock you can get your hands on, remem-
ber that there are better ways to buy hundreds of stocks at a time: You can 
buy index funds and exchange‐traded funds. These single investments are 
baskets that own hundreds of stocks. So with just one trade, you get the 
same benefit of an investor who spends hundreds of dollars in commissions 
building a massive portfolio of stocks. That’s why for many investors, buying 
an index mutual fund or exchange‐traded fund is the optimum strategy. (I 
talk about index mutual funds in Chapter 10 and exchange‐traded funds in 
Chapter 11.)
Zig‐zag: The second element  
of diversification
Diversification isn’t just the result of owning many stocks. You can reduce 
your risk further by combining different types of assets that zig when the 
others zag. Stocks that move differently than each other are said to have 
little correlation with each other. Investors build asset allocations by piecing 
together investments from popular asset classes such as the following:
✓
✓Cash is typically parked in funds that buy short‐term IOUs, such as 
money market funds. Money market funds are discussed in Chapter 10.
✓
✓Bonds are generally longer‐term IOUs issued by governments and 
companies.
✓
✓U.S. stocks are the shares of the thousands of companies that trade on 
U.S. stock markets.
✓
✓Foreign stocks are shares in companies that trade on exchanges in other 
countries. Foreign investing is covered at more length in a bonus chap-
ter on international and emerging markets at the companion website for 
this book.

218
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓Emerging market stocks own pieces of companies in up‐and‐coming 
economies. The risk is very high, but the returns can be high, too.
✓
✓Real‐estate investment trusts (REITs) own commercial property such as 
strip malls, apartment buildings, or offices. They tend to have low cor-
relation with other asset classes, making them attractive in many asset 
allocations. REITs also tend to pay dividends that are higher than com-
panies in other industries.
TIAA‐CREF, a large investment manager that specializes in retirement plan-
ning for people in the education and medical fields, provides a helpful primer 
on the different asset classes at www.tiaa‐cref.org/public/advice‐
planning/education/saving‐for‐retirement/basics/asset_
classes/index.html.
Smart asset allocations put the asset classes together in optimal ways. For 
instance, foreign stocks and U.S. stocks don’t move in lockstep with each 
other, so they work together well in a portfolio. Bonds and stocks also move 
differently. Blending the right doses of these different investments together 
helps give you the perfect portfolio and is the very purpose of diversification.
The degree to which investments move together is called the correlation. 
It’s a complicated mathematical issue that is discussed at more length in 
Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah Rumsey (published by John Wiley & Sons, 
Inc.), and online at www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp.
Just know this: When an investment moves identically to the market, it has a 
correlation of 1 with the market. When an investment moves exactly opposite 
to the market, it has a low correlation, or –1. If you can find investments with 
a low correlation and add them to your portfolio, you might be able to reduce 
your portfolio’s risk.
The secret to creating a portfolio is a balancing act among three factors: 
expected returns, risk, and correlation. Most investors appreciate the 
importance of choosing investments with high returns and low risk. There’s 
another aspect of investing, though, that you might not think about. You 
want assets that don’t move in lock step with each other. The idea is this: If 
you own two investments, and if one is doing poorly at the time, it’s nice if 
the other investment is doing better. That way, the investment that is doing 
well offsets the lagging investment. The end result is a portfolio that’s a little 
more stable, giving you the best return and lowest risk possible. Designing a 
perfect asset allocation can require more higher math than a college physics 
final exam. To make things easy, later in this chapter, I show you websites 
that can do the number crunching for you.

219

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
But for now, just know that most asset allocations will recommend that you 
own a certain percentage of stocks, bonds, and cash. Some asset allocations, 
though, dissect some asset classes, especially U.S. stocks, with even more 
precision. U.S. stocks are generally sliced into the categories described in 
Table 9‐1.
Let me explain the boxes in Table 9‐1. Each box contains a size, such as large 
or small, and a style, such as value or growth.
Bigger isn’t always better:  
Understanding size
You’ll often see references to large‐cap, mid‐cap, small‐cap, and micro‐cap 
companies when you’re researching asset allocations. Those terms are criti-
cal to asset allocations and are the basis on how online asset allocation 
sites work.
When you hear a reference to large‐cap companies, for instance, it’s a way 
to describe the company’s total market value or market capitalization. The 
market cap is the total price tag the stock market places on a company and 
is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares the com-
pany has outstanding. Market cap is a valuable way for investors to look at 
stocks because studies show that companies with similar market values have 
similar returns, risks, and correlations. For instance, small companies tend to 
have higher returns than large companies, but they’re also riskier.
That begs the question: What’s a small company and what’s a large company? 
That changes over time as the stock market rises and falls, but Table 9‐2 
gives you a general idea of where the lines are drawn.

The definitions of large, medium, and small companies are constantly ­ 
changing as the stock market rises and falls. You can look up current defi-
nitions from Russell, a big name in index tracking (www.russell.com/
indexes/americas/tools‐resources/reconstitution/market‐ 
capitalization‐ranges.page).
Want to know whether a stock you own is a large or small company? Nearly 
all the quote services that I describe in Chapter 2 can give you the market 
value. You can type a stock’s symbol into the Search Quotes box at MSN 
Money (www.msn.com/en‐us/money), click the name of the company, 
scroll down a bit, and the market value appears on the right‐hand side of the 
page next to the Market Cap label. Just take that market value figure and see 
where it ranks in Table 9‐2.
Picking investments with the right styles
Companies’ market values aren’t the only things that matter when it comes 
to asset allocations. Some investors also pay attention to stocks’ styles, such 
as value and growth.
The definition of what makes a value or growth stock isn’t as cut and dried as 
market value. You find ways to decide whether a stock is considered to be a 
value stock or a growth stock in Chapter 13, but for now, just know that value 
stocks are those that are generally bargain‐priced. Value stocks tend to be 
cheaper relative either to their assets or the earnings and dividends they are 
generating than their rivals. Value stocks, though, are cheaper for a reason: 
They’re perceived as being risky because they are in trouble or in a mature 
industry. Growth stocks, on the other hand, generally command lofty prices 
relative to their assets and earnings because investors expect them to grow 
rapidly in the future.

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
When you put market value, style, and correlation together, you have every-
thing you need to construct a perfect portfolio. These are the building blocks 
that help you get the highest return for the amount of risk you’re taking on. 
Table 9‐3 shows the long‐term returns, correlation, and risk of some of the 
types of investments suggested by asset allocation sites.
You can read more about how asset allocations balance the three factors at 
the following sites:

Investors commonly make the mistake of thinking their portfolios are diver-
sified if they own shares of companies in many different industries, such as 
energy, financial, and technology. I hate to burst your bubble. But if you own 
only shares of a large energy company, large financial company, and large 
technology company, you might not be truly diversified.
How rebalancing steadies your portfolio
When you have an asset allocation, you’re given a recipe that you stick with. 
And doing this forces you to be a smart investor by buying more of certain 
asset classes when they’re down in price. It may seem counterintuitive to buy 
investments when they’re plunging in value. And, to be clear, buying individ-
ual stocks when prices are crashing can be hazardous. Individual stocks are 
a different animal, and are explained more fully in Chapter 12 and Chapter 13. 
But if you invest in index mutual funds or exchange‐traded funds that own 
large baskets of hundreds of stocks, buying when shares go on sale can be 
smart because you lower your cost. This approach, called the rebalancing 
bonus by respected financial historian William Bernstein, is described fully 
here: www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/rebal.htm.

223

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
Rebalancing is only advised when you’re buying diversified baskets of assets, 
such as mutual funds or exchange‐traded funds, which track sections of the 
market. Buying individual stocks is a completely different animal. Buying 
when a stock is nose‐diving is called “catching a falling knife” and can be haz-
ardous to your financial health.
How discipline can save your portfolio 
from getting spanked
When you have an asset plan, it gives you something to stick to if the markets 
get choppy. Sometimes that saves you from yourself and helps you resist the 
temptation to chase after the hot stock or an index your neighbors are talk-
ing about. And that’s a good thing because investing in last year’s winner is a 
good way to find this year’s loser.
Chasing after hot asset classes is kind of like jumping between different 
checkout lines at the grocery store trying to find the shortest one. You end 
up spending lots of effort — and often end up in the slowest line anyway.
For instance, large stocks were the rage between 1995 and 1998 and were the 
top performers in each of those years, with gains of between 23 percent and 
37 percent a year, according to IFA.com. But jumping into the hot asset class 
was a bad idea. Between 2000 and 2006, large stocks underperformed other 
stocks badly. And in 2009 and 2010, investors couldn’t get enough of emerg-
ing market stocks, including shares of companies based in China and India. 
Emerging market stocks soared 72 percent in 2009 and 22 percent in 2010. 
However, investors who piled on in 2011 were left disappointed as emerging 
market stocks were poor performers and fell 17 percent that year. Emerging 
markets continued to lag, falling 3 percent in 2013, making them the worst 
major asset class that year. Emerging markets fell another 2 percent in 2014. 
The IFA Style Drifters table (www.ifa.com/12steps/step6/) uses a color‐
coded chart that shows how asset classes rarely stay on top.
Using and Finding Your Perfect  
Asset Allocation
You have three main ways to design your asset allocation:
✓
✓Follow guidelines: These simple rules, available on websites I point out, 
are great if you just want to keep things simple.

224
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓Take a risk‐based approach: Calculate how much risk you can toler-
ate and select a blend of investments to give you the highest return for 
that risk.
✓
✓Take a return‐based approach: You can work backward and measure 
how much return you need to meet your goal and design a portfolio that 
can get you there.
In this chapter, I help you choose an asset allocation, which gives you a road 
map of the types of investments you should buy to get the returns you’re 
looking for. But an asset allocation doesn’t do you any good if you don’t act 
on it. In Chapter 10, I show you how to buy the investments your asset alloca-
tion calls for by picking the right mutual funds. Chapter 11 gives you the low-
down on exchange‐traded funds, and in Chapter 13, I show you how to find 
individual stocks that match your asset allocation.
This chapter is dedicated to helping you figure out which types of assets you 
should own. Remember, though, asset classes aren’t the same thing as invest-
ments. You can’t directly buy an asset class, but you can buy an investment 
that represents an asset class such as shares of a large company like General 
Electric, an exchange‐traded fund that owns large‐company stocks, or a 
mutual fund that owns large‐company stocks.
If you’re the kind of person who just wants to be told which investments 
you should buy, new online tools can do just that. A few online investing 
services not only generate an asset allocation for you, but also tell you which 
exchange‐traded funds (ETFs) to buy. If that’s what you’re interested in, feel 
free to skip to Chapter 11, where these services are described.
Determining your current asset allocation
If you own any investments now, you already have an asset allocation. It just 
might not be what you think it is, and it might not be designed to give you the 
returns and risk you want. It’s important to understand what types of invest-
ments you own currently and what your current asset allocation is.
To get this information, the best place to start is with your online broker’s 
website. Some brokerages provide tools that tell you which asset classes you 
are invested in. TD Ameritrade’s Portfolio Planner, available to customers of 
the brokerage, breaks down your holdings in pretty granular detail, show-
ing you how much is invested in large, mid, and small U.S. stocks, as well as 
international stocks and bonds, for instance.

225

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
But there are also downsides to looking to your online brokerage to track 
your asset allocation. Your brokerage may not offer an asset allocation tool, 
or you may not like the ways that the brokerage classifies the asset classes. 
You may have investment accounts with other brokers or mutual fund com-
panies and would like to see a complete view of your total asset allocation.
That’s why you might look to some alternatives to your online broker to 
track your asset allocation, such as the following:
✓
✓Personal finance software: The last big player here is Intuit’s Quicken. 
It can classify all the stocks, bonds, and mutual funds in your portfolio 
and tell you what percentage of your holdings are in each. You can read 
more about Quicken (quicken.intuit.com) in Chapter 1.
✓
✓Morningstar’s Instant X‐Ray (www.morningstar.com): This handy 
tool is free and accessible on the Tools tab of the Morningstar home 
page. (You might need to scroll down the Tools page to find the link for 
Instant X‐Ray.) Just enter the ticker symbols of all your current holdings 
and the dollar value of each holding. Click Show Instant X‐Ray, and your 
holdings are broken down into the major categories, such as cash, U.S. 
stocks, foreign stocks, bonds, and other. Cash is included in the analysis 
since some of the mutual funds you own may be holding cash that is not 
invested. You also see how much of your stocks are in value‐priced or 
growth stocks and also whether they’re large, mid‐sized, or small compa-
nies. There’s also a breakdown of what industries your holdings fall in. 
(You can see a sample in Figure 9‐2.)
✓
✓Personal Capital (www.personalcapital.com): If you want to find 
out how your assets are allocated, and don’t want to enter anything 
yourself, Personal Capital might be your friend. After you sign up for a 
free account, you enter your username and password for your broker-
age firm. Personal Capital downloads all your stock transactions. Then, 
if you click on the Investing tab and then the Allocation tab, Personal 
Capital will break down what percentage of your portfolio is which 
asset class. If you’re not comfortable giving your brokerage informa-
tion to Personal Capital, you can also enter your brokerage transac-
tions manually.
✓
✓David Grabiner’s home page (http://remarque.org/~grabiner/
assetalloc.html): Coming from a mathematics background, mathe-
matics professor David Grabiner came up with an advanced spreadsheet 
that analyzes your current portfolio and tells you how it’s currently allo-
cated. What makes this spreadsheet unique is that it considers the effect 
of taxes on your portfolio. And it’s a free download!

Using guidelines
If you’re the kind of investor who wants to have an asset allocation but 
doesn’t want to delve into all the complications, this method is for you. The 
resources covered in the next sections make asset allocation easy, either by 
suggesting a general‐purpose asset allocation that can work for most people 
or letting you choose from simple but effective allocations.
Intuit’s Quicken financial software
Quicken has a helpful Asset Allocation Guide that lets you choose from sev-
eral off‐the‐shelf asset allocations. You can look them over and decide which 
one gives you the level of return you’re interested in at the amount of risk 
you can tolerate, such as conservative, moderate, or aggressive.
Efficient Frontier
Efficient Frontier (www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/cowards.htm) 
is a site managed by well‐known and well‐respected market scholar and advisor 
William Bernstein. He suggests a Coward’s Portfolio, which he says is designed 
to be an easy way for investors to build a solid portfolio with international 
exposure. He also suggests which mutual funds to buy to match the portfolio.

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
AssetBuilder
Scott Burns, a former financial columnist for The Dallas Morning News, started 
a website (www.assetbuilder.com) to help investors find simple asset 
allocations that they can stick with. For years, Burns recommended a “Couch 
Potato portfolio,” the easiest‐to‐follow allocation you can find: 50 percent 
stocks and 50 percent bonds. Put half your money in an index fund that 
tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which I discuss in Chapter 10, and 
half in one that tracks the bond market, and you’re done. That’s it. You can 
find the “recipes” for several of Burns’s asset allocations on the site for free 
(www.assetbuilder.com/lazy‐portfolios). Burns describes his Couch 
Potato system at AssetBuilder (see Figure 9‐3) as well as offers to design an 
asset allocation tailored for you, for a fee.
MoneyChimp
Okay, MoneyChimp isn’t as big as Intuit, but the folks there know invest-
ing. The Asset Allocation page (www.moneychimp.com/articles/risk/
portfolio.htm) gives you a general breakdown of what types of assets you 
should own with a simple calculator.
Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System
Manifesting some good Midwestern common sense, the folks at the Iowa 
Public Employees’ Retirement System have set up a free and easy‐to‐use 
online tool that gives you an idea of what your dream allocation would be 
Figure 9-3:

228
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
(www.ipers.org/calcs/AssetAllocator.html). You tell the system 
how old you are, how much you have, how much you save, your tax rate, and 
your risk tolerance by moving a series of sliders back and forth. It then spits 
out your asset allocation.
Gummy Stuff
Coming straight from the Great White North, the Gummy Stuff site is chock‐
full of tutorials, spreadsheets, and financial tools, including an asset alloca-
tor (www.gummy‐stuff.org/allocations.htm). It lets you play with 
­different asset allocations and see how you would have done.
Most people mentally separate their taxable and retirement accounts when 
looking at their asset allocation. It’s better, though, to think of all your 
accounts as a whole. You don’t need one asset allocation for your 401(k) 
and another one for your taxable brokerage accounts. In fact, if your asset 
­allocation plan calls for bonds, you could own them in your retirement 
account. That way, when the bonds pay interest, you don’t have to pay the 
tax until you withdraw the money, which could be in 30 years. Meanwhile, 
your taxable accounts are good places for the stock portion of your asset 
allocation that doesn’t generate large dividends. Lastly, if you own risky 
investments with large expected returns, such as emerging market stocks, 
you should put them in your Roth IRA. That way, you may never have to pay 
tax if you score big returns in exchange for the large risk you’ve taken on.
Picking an asset allocation based  
on your risk tolerance
Some investors may decide they want to tailor their asset allocation with a 
bit more precision for their individual taste. And if you’re like most investors, 
the disappointment you feel when your portfolio falls more than you’d like 
is definitely greater than any happiness you might feel at eking out a slightly 
better‐than‐expected return. That’s why online tools that assess your appe-
tite for risk, and then design a portfolio, make sense for many investors. A 
few to try include the following:
✓
✓IFA.com (www.ifa.com/SurveyNET/index.aspx): The folks at 
Index Fund Advisors offer a Risk Capacity Survey — which I mention in 
Chapter 1 — as a way to determine what kind of investor you are. The 
survey asks you a battery of questions to assess how much risk you 
can take, which is the way it recommends a portfolio to you. The Quick 
Risk Capacity survey has just 5 questions, and a longer survey has  
25 questions. After you answer the questions, the website suggests one 
of several portfolios. The most risk‐tolerant investors are pointed to 
Portfolio 100, and risk‐adverse investors to Portfolio 5.

229

 Chapter 9: Choosing an Asset Allocation
IFA’s asset allocations are much more detailed than some of the sites 
that provide guidelines. For instance, rather than suggesting owning 
large‐cap stocks, IFA.com distinguishes between large‐cap stocks and 
large‐cap value‐priced stocks. The portfolios also recommend specific 
index funds sold by asset management firm Dimensional Fund Advisors, 
which you can buy through a financial advisor licensed to sell them.
✓
✓Vanguard’s Investor Questionnaire (https://personal.vanguard.
com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire): This section of the Vanguard 
site, shown in Figure 9‐4, asks you ten questions in an attempt to 
try and figure out how much risk you can stomach. At the end, the 
site ­recommends that you own certain mixes of short‐term reserves, 
stocks, and cash. You can view all the recommended portfolios at 
https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving‐
investing/model‐portfolio‐allocations. (Short‐term reserves 
are investments that aren’t very risky because they mature in a short 
period of time.)
✓
✓CNNMoney (http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/ 
assetallocwizard/assetallocwizard.html): CNNMoney steps  
you through four questions designed to figure out what kind of risk taker 
you are. It then generates a fairly basic asset ­allocation mix.

✓Asset‐Analysis (www.asset‐analysis.com/assetalloc/aaquest.
html): With a name like Analysis of Asset Allocation, you can’t go wrong, 
right? This section of the site steps you through five questions that 
­measure your appetite for risk. When you’re done, the site determines 
how much risk you can take and tells you how much of your portfolio 
should be invested in cash, bonds, emerging markets, domestic stocks, 
real estate, and international stocks.
If you’re constantly finding yourself worried about your portfolio when the 
stock market falls, that’s a pretty good indication your asset allocation is 
wrong. You’re probably taking on more risk than you can handle. If you’re 
constantly anguishing over your portfolio, you’re a prime candidate to use 
the tools in this chapter to make sure that your portfolio is right for you.
Picking an asset allocation  
based on your goals
The other way to figure out how to allocate your portfolio is to first deter-
mine what kind of rate of return you need to reach your goal and then pick 
an asset allocation designed to get you there. Several of the asset allocation 
sites take this approach:
✓
✓Fidelity.com’s Portfolio Review (www.fidelity.com/calculators‐
tools/portfolio‐review) helps you plan for a wide array of goals, 
ranging from retirement and education to more specific things like a 
vacation, wedding, or wealth accumulation. The Portfolio Review also 
studies how much risk you can stomach. The site can analyze your cur-
rent portfolio and make suggestions on ways to improve and suggest an 
asset allocation. You don’t have to be a Fidelity account holder to use 
the system; you can sign up for a free membership instead.
✓
✓Morningstar’s Portfolio Planner (www.morningstar.com/Cover/
Tools.html) is a serious asset allocation tool for serious investors. 
The Portfolio Planner examines your financial goals and helps you 
choose the blend of cash, stocks, and bonds that will make it happen. 
The tool isn’t free, though, so you’ll have to pony up for a subscription 
to Morningstar Premium, which costs $199 a year. A free 14‐day trial is 
available.
Want to calculate the rate of return you need to reach a goal? Try Money 
Chimp’s Return Rate Calculator (www.moneychimp.com/calculator/
discount_rate_calculator.htm). Just enter how much money you 
have now, how much you need to have, and when you need to have it, 
and the calculator tells you the rate of return you need.

✓TIAA‐CREF’s Asset Allocation Evaluator (https://ais4.tiaa‐cref.

it asks is what your investment goal is, ranging from just hanging onto 
the money you have or trying to get the biggest financial score you can. 
The site then asks you additional questions that are relevant to that 
­specific goal.
Some brokers and mutual fund companies provide asset allocation tools to 
their customers. Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, for instance, offers

nline investing isn’t just for individual stock pickers. The Internet can 
also be used to pick, track, and monitor investments in mutual funds — 
funds that pool money from many investors so that it can then be invested 
in stocks, bonds, or other assets. By pooling money, mutual funds give small 
investors some of the benefits that larger investors enjoy, especially the 
ability to spread money over many investments, or diversify. Mutual funds 
are the way most people invest. More than 90 million individual investors, 
and nearly half the nation’s households, own a piece of mutual funds either 
directly or through a retirement plan like a pension fund. U.S. mutual funds 
hold more than $16 trillion in investor assets, which they pool together and 
use to buy stakes in investments.
In this chapter, I explain how online tools can maximize your success invest-
ing in mutual funds. I also show you how to use online tools to pick the 
right investments for you and walk you through the process of setting up an 
account to buy or sell the funds.
The Feeling Is Mutual: Understanding 
Mutual Funds
If all the work it takes to pick individual stocks, which I describe in 
Chapters 12 and 13, sounds exhausting, mutual funds might be for you. 
By their design, mutual funds give investors what they’re looking for with 

234
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
­minimal work. Most mutual funds own large baskets of stocks, giving inves-
tors the benefit of diversification (as I describe in Chapter 9) right off the bat. 
And mutual funds come in many flavors, allowing investors to buy exactly 
what they want, such as specific types of stocks or industries. Want to own 
small value‐priced stocks? No problem — you can buy a mutual fund that 
takes care of it. Passive investors can also buy index mutual funds, which 
match market indexes and charge low fees. Active investors can choose from 
actively managed mutual funds that rely on human stock pickers who try to 
beat the market (although very few do).
There’s just one problem. The sheer number of mutual funds is so enor-
mous that it’s hard to know where to start. There were 9,260 mutual funds at 
the end of 2014, according to the latest data available from the Investment 
Company Institute (www.icifactbook.org/fb_ch1.html). That’s greater 
than the 5,903 stocks that trade on major U.S. stock exchanges, including the 
New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
Considering the pros of mutual funds
Just because mutual funds are so popular, though, that doesn’t mean they’re 
right for you. You might decide that buying individual stocks is more your 
speed. Even so, it’s worth first considering what you gain and lose by invest-
ing in mutual funds. First, what you gain:
✓
✓Instant diversification: If you buy just one mutual fund, you own a piece 
of dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks. Buying a share of a fund is more 
cost‐effective than buying and managing hundreds of stocks yourself.
✓
✓Easy asset allocation: As I explain in Chapter 9, it’s important to have an 
asset allocation that helps guide you in what kinds of stocks you should 
buy to get more return for the amount of risk you’re taking on. Some of 
these asset allocations get pretty specific, calling for a certain percent-
age of your portfolio to be in small value‐priced stocks or large stocks. 
You can easily gain the right exposure by buying mutual funds dedicated 
to these sizes and styles. Buying just five or more mutual funds can give 
you an easy‐to‐manage and completely diversified portfolio.
✓
✓Low fees: By pooling your money with many other investors’ money, 
you gain significant cost savings. Large mutual fund companies can 
save money on commissions, research, and other fees, which means 
that they pay less than what you’d have to pay if you were doing all 
this on your own. Mutual funds must also disclose their fees, so you 
can quickly find those that are the most efficient. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/investor/tools/mfcc/
mfcc‐int.htm) describes how fees can eat into your returns.

235

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
If you’re interested in keeping your costs down, index mutual funds have 
extremely low fees, sometimes less than 0.1 percent a year. If a fund 
charges 0.1 percent, that means if you have $1,000 invested, you pay just 
a $1 fee that year.
Drawbacks of mutual funds  
worth considering
Despite mutual funds’ advantages, they have some significant drawbacks that 
might be deal killers for you:
✓
✓Lack of control: When you buy a mutual fund, you’re putting your 
investment in the hands of an investment company. If you invest with 
an actively managed fund, which hires a professional portfolio manager 
to select stocks for the fund to buy, you don’t have much say in invest-
ment decisions. If the manager sells a stock — one you think is a good 
long‐term hold, for instance — you can’t do anything about it. This is 
the case with index mutual funds, too. If a stock is added to the S&P 
500, for instance, your S&P 500 index fund will buy the stock, too.
Capital‐gain distribution nightmare
Capital‐gain distributions are one of the big-
gest drawbacks of actively managed mutual 
funds. These distributions can be very large and 
unexpected, two things you don’t want when it 
comes to managing your taxes. Consider the 
whopper of a capital‐gain distribution paid by 
Fidelity’s once hugely popular Magellan mutual 
fund in 2006. After the fund changed portfolio 
managers, the new manager cleaned house 
and sold off giant chunks of stocks owned by 
the fund under the previous manager. That 
resulted in 19 percent of the fund’s assets, 
or more than $22 a share, to be distributed to 
shareholders. Making things worse, if a port-
folio manager sells stocks owned for a year or 
less for a gain, shareholders who own the funds 
in a taxable account can get hit with high short‐
term capital gains taxes.
Capital gains taxes are explained in detail in 
Chapter 3. They’re a real and serious issue for 
mutual fund investors. CapGainsValet.
com is dedicated completely to forecasting and 
warning investors of mutual funds which are in 
the “doghouse” for massive capital gains distri-
butions. You can see the list of funds in the dog-
house here: www.capgainsvalet.com/
in‐the‐doghouse. Some of these funds 
included the Eaton Vance Large‐Cap Value and 
Janus Forty funds in 2014.
✓
✓Index shadowing: The most sinister actively 
managed funds are those that pretend to 
be adding value by picking winning stocks 
but are actually just tracking or shadowing 
the market. It’s unfortunate when this hap-
pens because investors are paying for the 
expertise of a fund manager but not getting 
anything in return. These investors could 
get the same results, and save money on 
fees, by investing in low‐cost index funds.

✓
✓Tax inefficiencies: When mutual funds buy and sell stocks during the 
year, their actions often create results in tax bills you weren’t expecting. 
The most unfortunate type occurs when a fund sells a stock for a gain.
Yes, you have to pay tax when you sell an individual stock for a gain. 
But you can decide when to sell that stock. Mutual funds may sell stocks 
for gains anytime, including a time that’s not good for you. That gain is 
then distributed to you, the mutual fund owner, and you must pay tax 
on it. Capital‐gain distributions often come with no warning and can spoil 
a well‐thought‐out tax plan. This tends to be much less of an issue with 
index mutual funds because the turnover, or number of stocks bought 
and sold, tends to be lower than with actively managed funds.
Types of Investment Companies
Investment‐fund companies are usually structured in one of two ways. The 
structure dictates how the value of the fund is determined and how you buy 
and sell your shares. The main types of structures are as follows:
✓
✓Open‐end investment companies: These folks are all mutual funds, 
all the time. Open‐end investment companies — also known as 
fund ­companies — buy baskets of stocks and then sell pieces of the 
­portfolios they’ve assembled to outside investors. The price of a share 
of a mutual fund is set at the end of each day when the fund company 
adds up the value of the shares it owns and divides by the number 
of shares outstanding. The result, called the net asset value (NAV), is 
what one share of the mutual fund is worth. The NAV is how much the 
mutual fund company would pay you if you redeemed, or sold, your 
shares. You can redeem or purchase shares through most online  
brokers or directly from the fund companies.
How do you find a mutual fund’s NAV? Nearly all the sites that provide 
stock quotes, described in Chapter 2, provide the mutual fund’s NAV if 
you enter the fund’s symbol. Some sites provide additional information 
about the fund. For instance, Morningstar also tells you
•	Performance of the fund compared to other similar funds and the 
closest benchmark.
•	Long‐term returns going back three and five years.
•	Total assets invested with the fund. This is a tally of how much 
investor money is invested in the fund.
•	Portfolio managers’ names.
•	Dividend yield, if any.
•	Expense ratio, which is an important area that’s discussed more 
fully later in this chapter, in the section “Deciphering the morass 
of mutual fund fees.”

237

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
•	Purchase information. You find a link to the fund company to help 
you find out how to invest.
✓
✓Closed‐end investment companies: These are part mutual fund, part 
stock. Like open‐end investment companies, closed‐end funds buy 
portfolios of stocks. But closed‐end funds don’t redeem shares held by 
investors directly. Instead, shares of closed‐end funds trade on the stock 
market just like a regular stock. That means the price is set very differ-
ently than with mutual funds. Investors study the value of the stocks in 
the closed‐end portfolios and decide how much the basket is worth. The 
price of the fund moves during the day as buyers and sellers agree on 
a price. The fact that investors set the price on closed‐end funds often 
creates an interesting situation where the price of the closed‐end fund is 
less than the value of the stocks owned by the fund. When that happens, 
that means the closed‐end fund is trading at a discount.
You can find all the closed‐end investment companies that are trading  
for a discount by logging on to Morningstar’s closed‐end fund center 
(http://news.morningstar.com/CELists/CEReturns.html? 
fsection=CELists) and clicking the Premiums/Discounts column 
twice to sort by funds trading for a discount.
You can also find out more about closed‐end funds in general at the 
Closed‐End Fund Association (www.closed‐endfunds.com).
Categorizing Mutual Funds
Because you find more mutual funds than stocks, it’s probably not too sur-
prising that you also find many types of mutual funds. Mutual funds at their 
most basic level come in four basic flavors: those that invest in stock funds, 
bond funds, money market funds, and hybrid funds. But if you drill down, you 
find even more categories. The following sections give you a sense of how 
categories and subcategories branch off from each other.
Stock funds
Stock funds invest in shares of publicly traded companies. These funds typi-
cally go for large gains by pursuing one of a number of strategies:
✓
✓Growth funds are filled with shares of companies that investors gener-
ally expect to expand their earnings the fastest. Portfolio managers of 
actively managed growth funds are typically willing to pay higher valu-
ations for growth stocks because they think the companies are worth it. 
Growth index funds buy shares of companies that have the highest valu-
ations, often measured by the price‐to‐book ratio, a concept I explain in 
more detail in Chapter 13.

238
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
If you’re young and retirement is still years off, many experts advise to 
invest in growth funds. The trouble, though, is that academic studies 
have shown growth funds, including growth index funds, tend to own 
the most overvalued stocks. That means they tend to have lower future 
returns and higher risk than value funds that own less glamorous stocks.
✓
✓Value funds own companies that are generally out of fashion or consid-
ered to be ho‐hum and mature by Wall Street. Actively managed value 
funds are constructed by portfolio managers trained to look for under-
valued stocks, or stocks that sell for less than what they’re truly worth. 
Value index funds generally own stocks that have the lowest valuations.
✓
✓Income stock funds seek to invest in companies that pay fat dividends, 
such as utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Income stock 
funds aren’t looking for stock price appreciation alone.
✓
✓International funds invest 80 percent or more of their money in com-
panies located outside the United States. Some international funds 
concentrate on specific areas of the world, such as Europe or Japan. Yet 
others, called emerging market funds, focus on up‐and‐coming parts of 
the world.
✓
✓Global funds invest in companies in any part of the world, including the 
United States.
✓
✓Sector funds pick specific industries investors often like to invest in, 
such as technology, energy, and utilities.
Bond funds
Bond funds own diverse baskets of bonds, which usually have similar charac-
teristics. Bond funds are generally seen as a way to reduce risk because they 
collect income from a variety of borrowers. If one borrower defaults on the 
loan, you own many other bonds and aren’t wiped out. You find many types 
of bond funds, which I discuss in more detail in Chapter 16. The main ones to 
know about are the following:
✓
✓Government bond funds tend to invest in debt issued by the U.S. gov-
ernment. These funds usually invest in Treasurys that mature in the 
short term, intermediate term, or long term, or a blend of each.
✓
✓High‐yield bond funds, nicknamed junk bond funds, generate higher 
returns by investing in debt issued by companies with shakier finances. 
The overall risk is reduced by spreading the investment over many com-
panies’ debt.
✓
✓Corporate bond funds own bonds issued by large companies. Their 
yields are generally higher than those paid by government bonds but 
less than high‐yield bonds.

239

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
✓
✓Municipal bond funds invest in debt issued by state and local govern-
ments. These bonds can be attractive because they’re usually not taxed 
by the federal government.
Money market funds
Money market funds are a great place to park cash you might need at short 
notice. They invest in very low risk short‐term Treasurys issued by the 
federal government or IOUs from banks. Money market funds can be great 
places to get a decent return on cash you’ve set aside for emergencies. The 
SEC (www.sec.gov/answers/mfmmkt.htm) provides more information 
about money market funds.
Money market funds are supposed to be super‐safe places to park cash. The 
price of a money market fund is supposed to be rock solid and always $1 a 
share. But like many things that were supposed to be true, but weren’t, the 
financial crisis that erupted in 2007 and 2008 called into question the safety 
of money market funds. The Reserve Primary Fund, one of the largest and 
oldest money market funds, in September 2008 became the only mainstream 
money market to “break the buck,” or lower its price below $1 a share. The 
fund’s shocking problem resulted from its investment in Lehman Bros. debt, 
which crashed in value during the crisis.
Reforms were created in July 2014 to tighten the rules on what money market 
funds can invest in, but as a result, their yields are lower than they were, 
too. Some investors continue to question whether money market funds are 
relevant when interest rates continue to be very low well into 2015. Investors 
know money market funds don’t offer much higher interest rates — and 
sometimes lower — than what’s available from a savings account.
Hybrid funds
Hybrid funds blend aspects of all the types of funds in the preceding sections 
into a unique package that suits some investors. Some examples include the 
following:
✓
✓Balanced funds split their portfolios into a preset mix of bonds and 
stocks. Investors who want to diversify their holdings between stocks 
and bonds can in theory just buy one of these and leave it up to the 
portfolio manager.

240
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓Target date funds are an increasingly popular type of investment where 
you tell the mutual fund company how old you are and it determines the 
right mix of investments for you. You literally don’t have to do anything. 
These types of funds automatically split your money into a preset blend 
of stocks and bonds. As you age and your appetite for risk declines, the 
funds automatically shift your portfolio to be more weighted toward 
bonds and away from stocks. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
(www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/tdf.htm) provides additional 
information about these types of funds and can help you find some that 
might fit your needs.
✓
✓Fund of funds are mutual funds that buy other mutual funds. The idea is 
that these funds can assemble a collection of mutual funds so that you 
don’t have to.
What to Look for in a Mutual Fund
When you’re shopping for a fund, you want to have a checklist of all the 
things that are important to you. Pay attention to the following things:
✓
✓The fund’s style: If your asset allocation calls for investing in large value‐
priced stocks, you want to go with a fund that invests in large value‐
priced stocks. Sounds easy, right? Watch out, though, because the name 
of a mutual fund might make it sound like one thing, when in reality it’s 
something else.
How could this “what’s in a name” business affect you? Say you’re debat-
ing between two mutual funds that claim to invest in small stocks. Both 
have the words small stock in their names, but the funds might define 
small stock differently.
Finding out which one owns smaller stocks is easy. Log on to the site of 
mutual fund tracker Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), enter the 
first mutual fund’s ticker symbol, click on the name of the fund, and then 
click the Portfolio tab on the top of the new page that appears below 
the fund’s name. Scroll down and you’ll see the fund’s average market 
value, labeled Avg Market Cap USD, which measures how much the aver-
age stock held by the fund is worth. Do the same for the other fund and 
compare the results. If you want a small‐cap fund, make sure that the 
average market value falls in the small range in the chart in Chapter 9. 
Figure 10‐1 shows you what happens when you check the Vanguard 500 
Index Investor portfolio.

241

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
✓
✓Long‐term performance: It’s tempting to chase after mutual funds that 
did the best last year or in the last decade. But studies have shown 
explosive mutual funds are rarely able to maintain their streaks. You 
should concentrate on a fund’s five‐ or ten‐year track record, at the 
least. If you can get performance data going back further, that’s even 
better. And always compare a mutual fund’s performance to the compa-
rable index. If you’re looking to buy a mutual fund that invests in large 
value‐priced stocks, you should compare its performance to a large 
value index.
✓
✓Turnover: The amount of buying and selling a fund does is called its 
turnover. It’s important to keep turnover low because when your fund 
sells stocks, you can face serious tax consequences if it causes capital‐
gain distributions.
✓
✓Ratings: Mutual fund trackers Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) 
and Lipper (www.lipperleaders.com) rank mutual funds based on 
many dimensions of their performance. Although you can’t rely solely 
on these rankings, they’re worth paying attention to. Plus, they’re easy 
to understand.

✓
✓Size: You have a dilemma when shopping for actively managed mutual 
funds. When they get too large and have huge chunks of money to 
invest, performance usually suffers as they struggle to find enough 
investments to plow the money into. A general guideline on this is if you 
own an actively managed fund that invests in large companies, it might 
be getting too big when it has $50 billion in assets. You can find out how 
much money is invested in a fund by logging on to Morningstar.com, 
entering the fund’s symbol, clicking the name of the fund, and checking 
out the default Quote page. The amount invested in the fund is at the 
top of the page below where it says Total Assets.
Popular funds attempt to stop themselves from getting too bloated by 
closing to new investors. When this happens, if you were already an 
investor in the fund, you can add money, but you can’t buy the fund if 
you’re not already an investor.
Being too small can be a problem, too. If a fund doesn’t attract enough 
assets, it might be shut down.
✓
✓Fees: The fees are how much the fund charges you every year to invest 
your money. The fees charged by your fund are typically taken annually 
no matter what. That means even if the fund falls in value, you pay fees. 
That’s why fees are one of the most important things to pay attention 
to. They’re so important that the next section is dedicated to under-
standing them.
Actively managed mutual funds tempt investors with the promise that their 
portfolio managers are so smart that they can beat the market. The reality,  
though, is that very few beat the market consistently, and they wind up 
charging investors fees for a promise that’s never realized. A look at history 
shows how the odds are stacked against active mutual fund managers. Of 
the 355 funds that existed in 1970, only 32 percent were still around by 2009, 
according to information from John Bogle. Bogle is the founder of Vanguard, 
which pioneered the low‐cost index mutual fund. The other 68 percent of 
mutual funds no longer exist, most of which were shut down due to poor 
performance. Even if you picked one of the survivors, you didn’t necessar-
ily score. Of the funds that lasted, 37 percent lagged the stock market, and 
42 percent turned in performances that nearly matched the market. That 
means just 7 percent of the funds that existed in 1970 beat the stock market 
by more than one percentage point a year.
Newer data came to the same conclusion. More than 85 percent of active 
large‐cap mutual funds failed to beat their benchmarks in 2014, says S&P Dow 
Jones Indices. It gets worse. Nearly 90 percent of the actively managed funds 
underperformed in the past five years and more than 80 percent underper-
formed over the past ten! That’s why investing in a low‐cost index fund, for 
many investors, is often the best option.

243

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
Deciphering the morass  
of mutual fund fees
Mutual fund performance swings up and down, along with the stocks and 
bonds the fund is invested in. But one thing’s for sure: The mutual fund com-
pany will make sure to collect its cut.
If you’re not careful, mutual funds can sting you with all sorts of fees. The 
good thing, though, is that all fees must be disclosed ahead of time so that 
you can avoid expensive funds if you know what to look for. The short list of 
things to be on the lookout for includes the following:
✓
✓Front‐end loads are charged to investors immediately when they buy 
a fund. These fees are the most sinister because a bite is taken out 
of your portfolio even before you get started. Investor outcry helped 
to drive these fees on stock mutual funds from 3.9 percent in 1990 to 
0.9 ­percent in 2014, says the ICI (www.icifactbook.org/fb_ch5.
html). Regulators don’t allow funds to charge more than 8.5 percent. 
You can read more about how the regulators oversee fees from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/answers/
mffees.htm). You can usually spot a fund charging a front‐end load 
because it sells what are called Class A shares.
✓
✓Back‐end loads are essentially commissions charged when you redeem 
shares. They’re also called contingent deferred sales and are sometimes 
waived if you own the mutual fund shares long enough. For instance, 
you’ll be socked with a 5 percent fee if you redeem shares in a year or 
less and 4 percent if you redeem in two years, and the fee keeps falling 
until it vanishes after you own the fund for five years. Back‐end loads 
include so‐called 12b‐1 fees that the fund company charges shareholders 
to promote its fund. These fees cannot exceed 0.75 percent of the fund’s 
net assets per year to pay for marketing costs. Funds that charge back‐
end loads are designated as Class B shares.
✓
✓Redemption fees are charged when shareholders redeem, or sell, their 
shares. Redemption fees are technically different from back‐end loads 
because the fees go to paying the costs that arise from your redemption. 
But they sting just the same. Regulators prohibit redemption fees from 
exceeding 2 percent of the amount sold.
✓
✓Purchase fees are charged when shareholders buy shares of a fund. This 
fee might not be called a front‐end load fee, but it is still a fee you must 
pay up front, and it costs you money.
✓
✓Management fees are the ongoing fees the mutual fund charges you to 
run your money.

244
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓Other fees include exchange fees if you shift money into a different fund 
owned by the same mutual fund company, or an account fee if you, for 
instance, don’t meet a minimum account balance.
Although it might seem like the number of charges levied by mutual funds are 
limitless, mutual fund fees have been falling. The average fees and expenses 
collected by stock mutual funds were 0.70 percent in 2014, down from 
0.99 percent in 1990. And the fees of bond funds have fallen to 0.57 percent 
from 0.88 percent during the same time period.
No‐load mutual funds don’t charge front‐ or back‐end load fees. But that 
doesn’t mean they’re free. Even no‐load funds can charge redemption, 
­purchase, exchange, and management fees.
You can easily find out online how much a fund charges in fees. Enter the 
symbol at Morningstar.com and click the Expense link on the top of the new 
page that appears just under the fund’s name. The site shows you both the 
initial (front‐end load) and deferred (back‐end load) fees plus all other fees — 
including 12b‐1 and management fees — on a screen like the one shown in 
Figure 10‐2. Morningstar also shows you how much the fees will eat from 
your portfolio over the next three, five, and ten years.
Before paying a load, be absolutely certain that you can’t find a less expen-
sive mutual fund or index mutual fund that will accomplish the same thing for 
you. The Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov/investor/
tools/mfcc/mfcc‐intsec.htm) provides a fee calculator that shows just 
how costly fees can be. Personal Fund (www.personalfund.com) can also 
analyze mutual funds’ fees and calculate how much they will cost you.

which scour a database of all mutual funds, looking for criteria you select. 
Several websites provide such screening tools, including the following:
✓
✓Morningstar (www.morningstar.com): That Morningstar is on the 
list shouldn’t come as a surprise. To pinpoint the types of funds you’re 
looking for, just click the Funds tab on the Morningstar home page. 
Next, click the Basic Fund Screener link under the Tools heading on 
the right‐hand side of the page. You can screen mutual funds based 
on everything from the type of fund, such as large‐value, to funds with 
expense ratios below certain levels, low turnover, average market 
values of specific amounts, and ten‐year returns that you choose. You 
can even exclude funds that charge loads or only view funds that have 
received Morningstar’s highest ratings. When you’re done entering all 
your criteria, click the Show Results tab, and you get a list of all the 
funds that meet your standards.
It’s generally a good idea to stick with mutual funds that charge total 
fees of well below 1.5 percent — preferably much lower.
✓
✓Lipper (www.lipperleaders.com): The other big‐name mutual fund 
tracker, Lipper, lets you begin a search by clicking the Fund Screener link 
on the right side of its home page. You can narrow your search by type 
of fund (such as stock or bond) or classification (size and fund family, 
for instance). A fund’s family is the company that offers the fund, say 
Vanguard or Fidelity. You can also limit your search to funds that receive 
Lipper’s top rating in five categories: total return, consistent return, 
preservation, tax efficiency, and expense.
✓
✓Reuters Fund & ETF Screener (http://funds.us.reuters.com/
US/screener/screener.asp): If mutual funds found themselves on 
the Survivor reality show, it would be something like this. Reuters’ Fund 
screener gives you a count of all the funds that meet your criteria — and 
you can watch the number drop as you narrow your search.
Many of the discount online brokers provide free access to mutual fund  
screening tools, most of which are based on either Morningstar or Lipper  
data.
How to buy mutual funds  
with an online broker
You have two main ways to buy mutual funds: directly from the mutual fund 
company or through a broker.
Nearly all the online brokers that I discuss in Chapter 4 let you buy mutual 
funds. Buying this way is convenient because your mutual fund holdings are 
listed on your account statements next to your stock investments.

246
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
To buy a mutual fund this way, log on to your account, enter the mutual 
fund’s stock symbol, and proceed to buy it just as you’d buy a stock. The 
online broker’s site then gives you the NAV from the previous day. (After the 
stock market closes, the mutual fund determines the NAV for the day. That 
NAV, measured after the market closes, determines the price you pay for 
the shares.)
Some online brokers charge exorbitant commissions for buying and selling 
mutual funds. Table 10‐1 shows you some sample commissions from a few 
top online brokers.
Online brokers often offer a number of transaction‐free mutual funds that you 
can buy and sell for no commission. Just be careful, though, because these 
online brokers also usually hit you with a short‐term redemption fee, even on 
a transaction‐free mutual fund, if you sell the fund too quickly after buying it. 
These fees are usually around $50.
How to buy mutual funds without a broker
You might not want to fuss with getting a broker, or perhaps you hate limit-
ing yourself to the transaction‐free mutual funds in order to avoid a broker’s 
high commissions on other funds. You might be a candidate for buying 
shares directly from the mutual fund companies. This might save you money 
because mutual fund companies typically don’t charge commissions.
If you’re interested in buying a fund that isn’t one of the transaction‐free 
choices with a broker, it’s best to buy directly from the fund company to 
avoid paying commissions. It’s especially a good idea if you plan to peri-
odically make small investments, which could ring up hefty fees if you 
use a broker.

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
To buy mutual funds from a mutual fund company, you need to set up an 
account, which you can do pretty quickly online. After you decide which fund 
you’d like to buy, just log on to the fund company’s site and click a link that’s 
usually labeled Open an Account. You have to answer the same questions 
needed to open an online brokerage account, described in Chapter 4, includ-
ing your address and type of account (individual or joint). You also need to 
tell the mutual fund company whether you want dividends deposited to your 
account or used to buy additional shares of the fund. You can fill out the 
application online in about 20 minutes or print it and mail it in.
Most mutual fund companies offer automatic investment plan (AIP) ­programs. 
If you sign up for an AIP, the fund company automatically takes money from 
your bank savings or checking account each month. It’s a good way to make 
sure that you’re regularly saving money. Some funds even let you start with a 
smaller initial investment if you sign up for the AIP.

Comparing Mutual Funds to Each Other
When you’re choosing a mutual fund, it’s always a good idea to compare 
­several similar funds to each other to make sure that you’re getting the best 
one for your needs. You want to consider the funds’ characteristics and risks.
Putting funds’ characteristics side by side
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) offers many useful tools that let 
you compare mutual funds. For instance, it shows you the average price‐to‐­
earnings ratios of all the stocks a fund holds.
The price‐to‐earnings ratio, discussed at more length in Chapter 13, is one way 
to see how pricey stocks are. Just visit the site and from there, enter the name 
or symbol of the fund into the Quote blank and click the fund’s name when it 
pops up. Select the Portfolio heading beneath the name of the mutual fund, 
which takes you to the portfolio page. Next, click the Holdings link, on the 
right of the summary link underneath the name of the fund. You’ll see a list of 
the fund’s top holdings and all the key information, including the P/E ratios. 
Morningstar also offers a feature that allows you to compare, side‐by‐side, two 
mutual funds. This “Fund Compare” feature is located on the Funds tab under 
the Screeners option. You can compare several funds based on a number of 
key criteria. The Fund Compare feature is free if you register with the site.
Analyzing a mutual fund’s risk
Understanding the potential returns you might enjoy from a fund is just half 
of the equation. It’s equally — if not even more — important to know how 
much risk you’re taking on to get the return. Many of the same online tools 
used to measure your portfolio’s risk, which I explain in Chapter 9, can be 
used to gauge your mutual fund’s risk, too.
Online mutual fund investors, though, can get additional information about 
risk from Morningstar. Enter the mutual fund’s ticker symbol at Morningstar.
com in the Quote blank in the upper center of the page and click the name of 
the fund when it pops up. Next, click the Ratings & Risk tab on the new page 
that appears, just under the name of the fund. Scroll down a bit and you will 
see all the vital measures of the fund’s risk, including

 Chapter 10: Finding and Buying Mutual Funds
✓
✓Standard deviation: As I explain in Chapter 8, standard deviation is a 
way to measure an investment’s risk. All you really need to know is that 
the higher the standard deviation, the higher the fund’s risk.
✓
✓Sharpe Ratio: This measure gives you, at a glance, an idea of how much 
bang you’re getting from the mutual fund for the risk you’re taking. The 
higher the Sharpe Ratio — named after Nobel Laureate William Sharpe — 
the more return you’re getting for the risk.
✓
✓R‐Squared: This measure helps you figure out how much of a fund’s 
movement is due to the judgment of the portfolio manager and how 
much is due to the movements of the stock market. The closer R‐
Squared is to 100, the more the fund mirrors what’s going on in the stock 
market. An index fund tracking the S&P 500 index, for instance, would 
have an R‐Squared of very close to 100.
Don’t pay a mutual fund manager high fees for just investing in an index. 
You could pay much less and just buy an index fund. To know whether 
your manager is shadowing the market, look at R‐Squared. If an actively 
managed fund you own has an R‐Squared close to 100, consider dumping 
it and buying an index fund.
✓
✓Beta: Measures how sensitive your fund is to movements by the rest 
of the stock market. A fund with a beta of 1 moves up and down by the 
same order of magnitude as the stock market. A beta of 0.75 shows that 
the fund tends to underperform by 25 percent when the market gains 
but declines 25 percent less when the market falls. If you want less wild 
swings in your financial life and can accept lower returns as a result, 
look for a fund with a low beta.
✓
✓Alpha: Definitely one of the best statistics out there for measuring 
mutual funds. This single number tells you whether the portfolio 
manager is adding value or destroying value. When a fund has a nega-
tive alpha, that means it performs worse than it should, based on the 
amount of risk that’s being assumed. When the alpha is positive, it 
means that the manager is adding value by getting a better return than 
would be expected for the risk being taken. Always look for mutual funds 
with positive alphas. In measuring alpha, Morningstar compares all 
funds not only to the market (S&P 500) but also to the index that most 
closely matches a fund’s investment objective.
Getting the Full Story: Reading  
a Mutual Fund’s Prospectus
Mutual fund companies are required by regulators to clearly explain to inves-
tors, in writing, everything an investor would need to know. This information 

250
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
is contained in a regulatory filing called the prospectus. These documents are 
very detailed and worth reading before you invest in a fund.
Nearly all the most vital data contained in mutual fund prospectuses are 
captured by mutual fund websites described in the preceding sections. You 
don’t need to dig through a prospectus to get things like fees or investment 
objectives. But a section of the prospectus that’s often left out of the web-
sites is the Risks section, which outlines all the things that could go wrong. 
That’s worth checking out. Also, the SEC provides guidelines on what to look 
for in the prospectus at www.sec.gov/answers/mfinfo.htm.
You have several ways to get the prospectus online, including the following:
✓
✓The mutual fund provider’s website: The mutual fund company’s web-
site almost always has a link to the prospectus.
✓
✓Sources for regulatory filings: Mutual fund prospectuses are regula-
tory filings, so you can retrieve them from many of the same places you 
can get companies’ filings, as I describe in Chapter 2. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission’s website (www.sec.gov) provides the 
information for free. (Figure 10‐3 shows the SEC’s Search for Mutual 
Funds Prospectuses page at www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/
prospectus.htm.)

Getting More Information about Funds
The funny thing about mutual funds is that they can be extremely hands‐off, 
or an addiction. On the one hand, you can buy a target date mutual fund, set 
up an AIP, and never think about your mutual fund again. But, you can also 
read about the ins and outs of mutual funds and keep up on all the new devel-
opments. If you’re interested in studying funds, check out the following sites:

A
 
 relatively new type of fund called an exchange‐traded fund, or ETF, is 
exploding with popularity. Like index mutual funds, most ETFs invest 
in baskets of stocks tied to a stock market index. ETFs have proven to be so 
popular that new types are being created, including variants that own invest-
ments in commodities or stocks picked by human money managers. But the 
key way ETFs differ from mutual funds is that they trade during the day just 
like an individual stock. This important difference gives ETFs an edge over 
mutual funds for some investors. ETFs have lured more than $2 trillion of 
investors’ cash since they started to catch on in the early 1990s. In this chap-
ter, I explain how online tools can maximize your success investing in mutual 
funds and ETFs. I help you use online tools to pick the right investments for 
you and show you how to set up an account to buy or sell the funds.
Getting to Know ETFs
Exchange‐traded funds have been one of the biggest developments in the 
world of finance since banks started giving customers free toasters. Their 
popularity continues to amaze the financial industry. Although the $2 trillion 
invested in U.S. ETFs trails the $16 trillion in mutual funds, ETFs are growing 
fast. The value of assets invested in ETFs has jumped more than 150% in just 
five years through 2014, says the Investment Company Institute.

254
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
ETFs are baskets of stocks, much like mutual funds, that trade like stocks. 
You can buy and sell them using your online broker just like you would with 
other stocks. All ETFs have trading symbols and qualify for the low commis-
sion rates from online brokers. Several online brokers, including Charles 
Schwab, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade, even let you trade some ETFs for no 
commission. You can even get price quotes by using your favorite stock‐
tracking websites, including those listed in Chapter 2. And ETFs are the 
instruments that are being used by the increasingly popular “Robo‐Advisors” 
that allow investors to have a computer pick an optimized portfolio for them.
You can buy and sell ETFs by using the online broker you’ve already signed 
up with. Just enter the ETF’s trading symbol, and you can buy and sell just 
like you would shares of a company’s stock.
Investors like ETFs because they’re easy to buy without the hassle of sign-
ing up for accounts with mutual fund companies or checking to see whether 
they’re transaction‐free or else face large commissions. Unlike mutual funds, 
which update their prices once a day after the market closes, ETF prices are 
constantly updated during the trading day. That means investors can just 
buy ETFs and sell them whenever they want during the day. This explains 
why the number of ETFs has taken off, as shown in Table 11‐1.
ETFs have some of the same advantages of mutual funds, as I describe in 
Chapter 10. That includes diversification and access to specific corners of the

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
stock market, including certain sizes of stocks or industries. ETFs, though, 
offer several advantages over mutual funds, including the following:
✓
✓Intraday trading: Mutual funds price once a day, meaning that you 
don’t know how your portfolio has done until the markets close and 
the fund companies get around to publishing the net asset value (NAV) 
for the day. The prices of ETFs constantly update during the day just 
like stocks.
✓
✓Access to tougher areas of the market: Investors interested in buying 
commodities, bonds, and currencies can buy them easily, just like 
buying a stock, thanks to ETFs. And because ETFs are priced during 
the day, speculators can get in and out of risky positions anytime they 
want. ETFs are a great way to add foreign exposure to your portfolio, as 
I explain in the “Broadening Your Horizons: International Stocks” bonus 
chapter on the website associated with this book.
✓
✓Low fees: If you thought the fees on index mutual funds were low, ETFs 
in many cases are even lower. It’s not unusual for ETFs to charge lower 
maintenance fees than mutual funds that mirror the same stock index by 
owning all the stocks in the index. The average expense ratio of ETFs is 
roughly 0.4 percent, well below the 1.0 percent charged by mutual funds.
✓
✓Tax advantages: Due to their structure, ETFs rarely stick investors 
with capital‐gain distributions. That helps investors plan tax strategies. 
Keep in mind, though, many ETFs still pay dividends, which are usu-
ally taxable.
✓
✓Offer advanced trading options: Most ETFs offer options, specific trad-
ing vehicles I discuss in Chapter 5. That’s attractive to investors who 
want to do more than just buy or sell the investments. ETFs can also be 
shorted, a technique used to bet that an investment will decline in value 
that I also explain in Chapter 5.
Invest in Popular Indexes with ETFs
So far, most ETFs track a stock market index much like an index mutual fund. 
That’s not a bad thing because indexes often outperform actively managed 
mutual funds and have lower fees.
Most of the oldest and largest ETFs, not surprisingly, track the most popular 
stock and bond market indexes. Some of the largest ETFs that track widely 
followed indexes include those listed in Table 11‐2.

How to Find the Right ETF for the Job
As with mutual funds, one of the toughest things about ETFs is just finding 
the right ones for you amid the hundreds of choices out there. But as with 
mutual funds, online screeners can help you scour through the universe 
of ETFs and find the ones that fit your needs. The following list gives you a 
­representative sampling:
✓
✓ETF Screen (http://etfscreen.com): This particular site allows 
you to search for an ETF by using a keyword or by selecting a type 
of ETF, such as those that track bonds or stocks. You start with the 
ETF Screener (http://etfscreen.com). Searching by keyword is 
­especially handy if you’re looking to invest in a somewhat offbeat type 
of stock, commodity, or part of the world. Just enter the keyword in 
the Filter based on name blank. Want to invest in an ETF that invests in 
­natural resources stocks, for instance? Just type natural resources in 
the search field, click the Search button, and you get a list.

✓
✓ETF Database (http://etfdb.com/screener): ETFdb is another 
online system that helps you pinpoint just the right ETF for you. You can 
search ETFs based on a number of criteria, including the all‐important 
expense ratio. The site shows you how many ETFs make the cut as you 
tweak your requirements.
✓
✓ETFGuide (www.etfguide.com): ETFGuide is a useful site that provides 
breaking news and developments in the ETF world. It’s a good place to 
check for new ETFs or find out about ETFs that are being closed because 
they failed to attract enough investors to make them viable.
✓
✓IndexUniverse (www.indexuniverse.com): IndexUniverse isn’t as 
galactic as it might sound, but it’s still a great resource for investors 
interested in ETFs. The site provides news and information connected to 
investing in indexes. A big part of the site’s focus is on ETFs. Investors 
can find loads of data that compare different ETFs against one another.
✓
✓Morningstar (http://screen.morningstar.com/ETFScreener/
Selector.html): Yes, Morningstar does ETFs, too. This section of the 
site provides a complete screening tool, with detailed search capabili-
ties that help you quickly find the ETF that passes all your criteria. 
Morningstar’s ETF screening tool is free, but you need to register with 
the site, which is also free.
Some investors seek ETFs that track specific asset classes or industries. 
Morningstar makes it easy to find them. The link above takes you to 
Morningstar’s basic ETF Screener. From this screener, you can choose 
an ETF’s fund group, such as “domestic” or “bond.” Morningstar’s 
basic ETF screen also lets you screen on asset class, or Morningstar 
Category, such as “large value” or “small growth.” Morningstar also 
has a more advanced ETF screener, which is also free if you register, 
here: http://screen.morningstar.com/etfselector/etf_
screener_version1.aspx. This advanced ETF screening tool lets 
you screen on many more variables than the basic screener does. Just 
click on the Add Criteria button located in the center of the screen. 
Here you can also choose industries from the “Morningstar Sector 
Weighting” category in the screening tool. Similarly, you can filter on a 
specific asset class from the “Style Box” option in the “Portfolio Style” 
category of the advanced screening tool.
✓
✓Online brokers: The big players often provide tools that help you 
find the right ETFs for you. For instance, TD Ameritrade (research.
tdameritrade.com/grid/public/screener/etfs/overview.
asp) offers a site that studies your investment objectives and suggests 
ETFs that might help get you there. You don’t need to have a brokerage 
account with TD Ameritrade to use the system, though.

258
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
✓
✓ETF providers’ websites: The largest ETF providers — iShares (www.
ishares.com/us/index), Vanguard (investor.vanguard.com/
etf), and State Street (www.spdrs.com) — provide very detailed infor-
mation about their families of funds.
Don’t assume that these are just worthless promotional sites. They’re 
well organized and make it easy to find what you’re looking for. You can 
find some interesting features on these sites, including State Street’s 
Correlation Tracker (www.spdrs.com/tools/correlationTracker.
seam), which can tell you which ETFs have a low correlation with any 
other ETF or stock you enter. (Investments are said to have low cor-
relations with each other when they don’t move in lockstep with one 
another.) Buying ETFs with low correlations, as I explain in Chapter 9, is 
attractive because it can lower your portfolio’s total risk.
Curious which stocks an ETF owns? All the online resources I mention here 
provide ETFs’ top holdings. These are the stocks that have the largest posi-
tions in an ETF.
Tracking ETFs’ every move
Because ETFs are priced during the day just like stocks, they can be useful 
tools to tell you what types of stocks and industries are moving each day. 
NASDAQ’s ETF center (www.nasdaq.com/investing/etfs) provides 
in‐depth analysis of the ETFs that went up and down the most in value each 
trading session. It also shows you the most popular ETFs, ranked by trad-
ing activity, or volume. (Volume is a measure of how many times shares of a 
stock or ETF trade hands.) The ETF Dynamic Heatmap (http://screening.
nasdaq.com/heatmaps/heatmap_ETF.asp) uses a color‐coded grid to 
show which ETFs are moving the most.
ETF fees can vary
Using screening sites like the ones I describe in the preceding section, you 
can easily find and compare the fees charged by ETFs. Here’s how you do it 
using Morningstar.com, for example:
1.	Point your browser to www.morningstar.com.
2.	Enter the symbol or name of the ETF you’re interested in checking 
fees for into the search field at the center of the top of the page.
Click the name of the ETF when it pops up.

259

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
3.	Look over the ETF Quote page.
The screen shows all the vitals about the ETF, including its price, the 
fund company that sponsors it, when it was created, what it invests in, 
and what its top holdings are. You also see the breakdown of industries 
it owns and how it has performed relative to major market indexes.
4.	Look at the Expenses area to the right.
The ETF’s expense ratio appears on the right side of the page.
Don’t assume that the most popular  
ETFs are the best
When you buy an ETF, you’re most frequently 
buying a basket of stocks that mirrors a stock 
index. And when shopping for index funds, you 
typically want to find the ones that either best 
track the type of stocks you’re interested in or 
have the lowest fees.
Ask yourself the same questions you consider 
when buying an index mutual fund:
✓
✓How large is the ETF? An ETF’s popularity 
is somewhat of an advantage at least in 
one aspect. In the case of an ETF, the more 
assets under management, the better. You 
don’t want to invest in a small ETF that 
doesn’t attract enough investors and ends 
up being shut down. This is becoming more 
of an issue as more ETFs are rushed to the 
market. In 2013 and 2014, for instance, 46 
and 59 ETFs were shut down, respectively, 
and the holdings given back to investors 
or transferred to another fund, says the 
Investment Company Institute. More ETFs 
are expected to shut down as the market 
gets overly crowded with more funds than 
investors can buy. During 2014, for instance, 
an additional 176 ETFs were created, the 
most since 226 were created in 2011.
To find out how large an ETF is, go to the 
Morningstar site (www.morningstar.
com), enter the ticker symbol of the ETF in 
the Quotes field, and then press Enter. The 
new page that appears is the Quotes page. 
The total assets number is found on the top 
of the page near the right side.
✓
✓What index does the ETF track? Some small‐
cap indexes, for instance, track the Russell 
2000, and others track the Standard &  
Poor’s 600. Both track small stocks, but dif-
ferences exist between the indexes them-
selves. Make sure that you’re tracking the 
index you prefer.
Imagine, if you will, that you want to buy an 
ETF that invests in small companies. It’s a 
good idea to check the website of the ETF 
company and check the average market 
value of the stocks held by the ETF and 
compare it with the competition.
✓
✓What are the expenses? If everything else 
is equal, there’s nothing wrong with looking 
at the price tag and going with the ETF that’s 
cheapest. Vanguard, a low‐cost leader in 
mutual funds, has emerged as a low‐cost 
leader in ETFs as well. Vanguard almost 
always deserves serious consideration for 
that reason. The rampant competition in the 
ETF business has dramatically driven down 
fees. That’s why it’s worthwhile to use one 
of the screening tools mentioned in this 
chapter to see what fee the fund charges 
and compare it to other options.

260
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
The expense ratio is a very important number that tells you the annual fee 
the ETF provider will charge you for owning the ETF. If you invest $1,000 in 
an ETF with an expense ratio of 0.5 percent, you’ll pay an annual fee of $5. 
You want to compare this ratio with other ETFs you might be considering. 
You can see a sample in Figure 11‐1.
Finding out how pricey an ETF is
Stock investors commonly look at the price‐to‐earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, of 
an individual stock to find out how expensive it is. The higher the P/E ratio, 
the more richly valued the stock is, as I explain in detail in Chapter 13. But 
ETF investors can also use P/E ratios to find how cheap or expensive the 
stocks held by the ETF are.
Several websites provide P/E ratios for ETFs. Using Yahoo! Finance (http://
finance.yahoo.com), enter the ETF’s symbol into the search field on the 
left side of the page. Click the name of the ETF when it pops up. You’ll see 
the ETF’s P/E ratio listed on the right side of the quote box, next to the label 
P/E (ttm), which stands for price‐to‐earnings ratio for the trailing (or last) 
12 months.
Yahoo! Finance also provides risk and performance measures for ETFs. The 
risk measures, such as standard deviation, help you determine how much 
the ETF will give you indigestion by swinging up and down in value. (I explain 
these risk measures in detail in Chapter 1.) The performance measures tell 
you how well the ETF has done. After entering an ETF’s symbol, just click the

the top of the page under the ETF’s name. Scroll down quite a ways until you 
see the Value & Growth Measures heading. Below that heading, you can find 
the ETF’s P/E ratio, labeled Price/Prospective Earnings, and see how it com-
pares with the relevant benchmark index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 
index. You can also find lots of other details on the Portfolio page, such as 
other valuation ratios and which industry sectors the ETF’s holdings fall into.
Using ETF‐Recommending  
“Robo‐Advisors”
Perhaps you’re on‐board with this ETF revolution and like the advantages 
ETFs have over mutual funds, but you’re overwhelmed. It’s normal to be a bit 
bewildered on how to start an ETF portfolio, given the overwhelming number 
of ETFs out there.
Meanwhile, even if you have a solid asset allocation plan, it’s up to you to 
find the right ETFs to match your objectives. For instance, consider that your 
asset allocation calls for 20 percent of your portfolio to be in large U.S. com-
pany stocks. You might not want to do the research to figure out which large 
U.S. company ETF to buy.
Enter the ETF recommendation service. These online services attempt to 
turn ETFs into a turnkey operation not only by designing your asset alloca-
tion, but also by telling you specifically which ETFs to buy. The services have 
unique approaches, but the idea is the same. You just indicate your investing 
goals and risk tolerance, and the website handles the rest.
What the heck is a Robo‐Advisor?
If you have a droid that vacuums the floors, you know what wonders a robot 
can do. There are even robots that can mow your lawn — although that 
sounds a little scary, frankly. Robots are entering the financial world, too. So‐
called Robo‐Advisors are essentially online tools programmed to pick the per-
fect portfolio for you. You log in to the Robo‐Advisor, tell the computer how 
much risk you can stomach and your financial goals, and the algorithm spits 

262
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
out a recipe of what ETFs you should own. Some Robo‐Advisors can even buy 
the ETFs for you.
Robo‐Advisors are trying to serve investors who have pretty simple invest-
ment needs but are still looking for help. Robo‐Advisors charge fees, but 
they’re a fraction of what it would cost to hire a human financial advi-
sor. Robo‐Advisors, though, aren’t free; you can still save yourself tons of 
money, especially over the long‐term, if you pick your own ETFs and buy 
them yourself.
The term “Robo‐Advisor” is more applicable to some of the providers than 
others, because with some of these services you really don’t have to do 
much more than sign up and put in money. Many younger investors with sim-
pler portfolio needs have gravitated to these services because they’re quick, 
simple, and online.
Robo‐Advisors that hold your hand
If you’d like to tap the wisdom of a financial robot, but you’re not willing 
to hand over the keys completely to the HAL yet, Robo‐Advisors that make 
recommendations might be for you. These Robo‐Advisors allow you to enter 
your portfolio goals and then spit out a recommended portfolio of ETFs. It’s 
up to you to actually make the decisions and execute the trades.
A few examples of Robo‐Advisors that make recommendations, but don’t 
actually carry them out, include

✓MarketRiders (www.marketriders.com) is aiming to not only design 
your asset allocation, but also to choose the specific ETFs that can put 
the plan in motion. You enter some basic information about you and 
your financial goals, and the site generates an asset allocation plan and 
recommends ETFs. If your asset allocation falls out of balance — say if 
one type of investment does better than the others — the site tells you 
which ETFs to sell and which ones to buy to get back in balance. You 
still need to log on to your brokerage account and do the buying and 
selling as suggested by MarketRiders’ instructions, though. You also pay 
a fee, 0.2 percent, of your assets.
✓
✓Invest‐it‐Yourself.com (www.invest‐it‐yourself.com) brings an à la 
carte approach to ETFs. You can choose from three menus of portfolios: 
standard, advanced, and premier. The standard portfolio recommends 
four asset classes and four corresponding ETFs, while the advanced 
portfolio recommends eight ETFs, and the premier recommends nine 
ETFs. The system is free, but you’ll be offered additional advisory ser-
vices that do cost money. Just as with MarketRiders, you need to log 

263

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
onto your brokerage account and do the buying and selling of the ETFs 
recommended by Invest‐it‐Yourself.com, unless you sign up for more 
­personalized assistance.
✓
✓iShares (www.ishares.com) isn’t an ETF recommendation service, but 
it has some aspects that give it the same level of hand‐holding, if not 
more, for investors. iShares provides several asset allocation ETFs — 
single funds that buy all the ETFs you need for you. For instance, you 
can buy iShares’ S&P Aggressive Allocation fund, with the symbol 
AOA, and that fund buys all the additional ETFs you need to have an 
­aggressive asset allocation. You find several asset allocation ETFs, 
including a Conservative Allocation Fund (symbol: AOK), Moderate 
Allocation Fund (symbol: AOM), and some ETFs that are designed to 
meet your goals by a specified year in the future.
Robo‐Advisors that are completely  
automated
If you’re comfortable with the idea of completely handing over your portfolio 
to a machine, there are completely autonomous Robo‐Advisors that will pick 
your ETFs and actually buy them. These services are designed to completely 
automate the process of picking ETFs, buying them, and keeping them in bal-
ance. There are some catches, namely the fees and the lack of control, but for 
beginning investors or people who want to hand the keys over to someone, 
they can be great options. Some examples include
✓
✓Schwab Intelligent Portfolios (intelligent.schwab.com) isn’t the 
first turnkey Robo‐Advisor, but certainly the one making the biggest 
impact. When one of the largest online brokers in the world – and one 
that caters to the do‐it‐yourself investor – unveils a Robo‐Advisor, the 
world takes notice. Schwab’s system assesses your taste for risk and 
then builds a portfolio of up to 20 different asset classes. Even more 
stunning — the service is free. It doesn’t charge advisory fees or com-
missions. The service also helps you sell losers at tax time, giving you 
tax losses that can be used to cut your taxes.
Does Schwab Intelligent Portfolios sound too good to be true? There are 
a couple of drawbacks. First, you’ll need to trust the machine’s selection 
of ETFs. But there’s a more important consideration — a hidden fee. One 
of the asset classes Schwab Intelligent Portfolios can choose is cash. 
That’s right, part of the money you’ve invested in the portfolio can be 
held in greenback, which you get absolutely no return on. As discussed 
in Chapter 4, allowing cash to sit in your brokerage account collecting 
no interest or appreciating can be pretty costly. This is a hidden fee 
investors need to be aware of — and a big reason why you can still beat 
the Intelligent Portfolios by choosing your own investments.

✓
✓CapitalOne Investing’s Portfolio Builder (www.capitaloneinvesting.
com) is another example of a model where an online broker recommends 
a portfolio and suggests specific ETFs that can work. Portfolio Builder 
recommends a portfolio of up to eight ETFs that fit your needs. You can 
then buy the entire collection of ETFs for a flat commission of $18.95. The 
system is appealing because you already have a relationship with the firm, 
and you don’t need to open an account.
✓
✓Wealthfront (www.wealthfront.com) is targeting investors who want 
to enjoy the benefits of ETFs, but want to leave most of the work to some-
one else. Simply answer a few questions on Wealthfront’s website, includ-
ing how much you have to invest and your age, and the site not only will 
choose ETFs for you, but buy and manage them, too. But with this ser-
vice comes a cost. Wealthfront will manage your first $10,000 for free. But 
if you ask Wealthfront to manage more than $10,000, the site takes a cut 
of your portfolio to the tune of 0.25 percent of your assets a year.
✓
✓Betterment (www.betterment.com) is another site trying to appeal 
to ETF investors who want someone else to choose their ETFs, and 
are ­willing to pay for the convenience. To use Betterment, you answer 
­questions about your financial goals, and the site will create a collection 
of ETFs deemed to be ideal for you. The site will then buy and manage 
those ETFs for you. Depending on the size of your initial deposit, 
Betterment takes anywhere between a 0.15 percent and 0.35 percent cut 
of your portfolio a year as a fee.
A Word on exchange‐traded notes, or ETNs
With the success of ETFs, it was just a matter 
of time before Wall Street cooked up newfan-
gled variants. One of the latest cousins to ETFs 
are exchange‐traded notes, or ETNs. The goal 
of ETNs is very similar to that of ETFs, which 
is giving investors a way to easily and cost‐
effectively buy a basket of investments. And 
like ETFs, ETNs trade just like a regular stock 
would on a stock exchange, usually the NYSE 
Arca exchange. However, there’s a big differ-
ence between ETFs and ETNs that investors 
must be aware of: ETFs are funds that actually 
own the underlying assets. For instance, if you 
buy an S&P 500 ETF, you know that fund con-
trols a portfolio of the 500 stocks in the index. 
ETNs work very differently. ETNs are based on 
a promise that the issuer of the fund will pay 
shareholders according to the terms spelled 
out in the prospectus. So, rather than owning 
the 500 stocks in the S&P 500, an S&P 500 ETN 
would be an IOU to investors from the issuer 
promising to buy and deliver the 500 stocks in 
the S&P 500 at some date in the future. Like 
ETFs, ETNs trade constantly so investors can 
buy or sell at any time and don’t have to wait 
for the ETNs to be closed out in the future. The 
jury is still out on the effectiveness of ETNs 
versus ETFs. Some ETNs may be able to better 
mirror the value of the assets, and the costs 
can be competitive with ETFs. However, some 
ETNs come with extremely complicated terms 
that may be too convoluted for most investors. 
Meanwhile, remember that ETNs are payable 
by a promise, which you may not be able to 
count on in the future.

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
These automated Robo‐Advisors might seem pretty appealing. They can be 
a great solution if you’ve decided you’re not interested in managing your 
money yourself because you don’t have the time or interest. These Robo‐
Advisors are better than doing nothing — and if they urge you to get started 
they can be perfect. But because you’re reading this book, you are probably 
more than a little interested in optimizing your return. And frankly, you can 
do better yourself. Most investors can set up an account at a brokerage 
account with no‐commission ETFs, buy the ETFs themselves, and save at 
least 0.1 percent a year, if not more. Robo‐Advisors aren’t right for investors, 
either, who are looking for exposure to some off‐the‐beaten‐path corners of 
the market, like the ones discussed later in this chapter.
ETFs That Go off the Beaten Path
Most ETFs are pretty typical and closely track their designated indexes. But 
ETFs are so new and relatively easy to create that some companies, including 
the following, have experimented with some interesting concepts:
✓
✓WisdomTree (www.wisdomtree.com) lets investors bet on academic 
research from Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel. Rather than following 
the lead of most ETFs and index mutual funds, which hold bigger chunks 
of stocks that have the greatest market values, Siegel suggests that it’s 
better to own bigger chunks of companies that pay large dividends. You 
can find an entire set of WisdomTree funds, enough to satisfy any asset 
allocation, based on this theory.
✓
✓Guggenheim Investments (www.guggenheiminvestments.com/
products/etf) offers some offbeat ETFs, including the Guggenheim 
S&P 500 Equal Weight (symbol RSP), which holds equal chunks of all 500 
stocks in the S&P 500 index. The company was formerly called Rydex SGI.
✓
✓Invesco PowerShares (www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/
investors/etfs) provides ETFs that track just about any industry 
you can imagine, ranging from biotech to companies working on nano-
technology, as well as specialized portfolios that include companies 
that pay large dividends or buy back their stock.
✓
✓Direxion (www.direxioninvestments.com) is best known for its 
ETFs that allow investors to either amp up or dial back their risk. The 
company offers a family of “3x” ETFs that are designed to gain in price 
by an amount that’s three times greater than the market. Similarly, it 
offers ETFs designed to gain in value when the stock market falls.
✓
✓ProShares (www.proshares.com) is attempting to make advanced 
trading strategies more accessible. For instance, its Short QQQ ETF 
(PSQ) goes up when the NASDAQ 100 goes down, giving investors a way 
to bet against technology stocks. Similar funds let investors bet against 
other indexes like the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

266
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
During a bear market, ETFs that let you bet against investments like stocks 
and bonds became popular. These “inverse” ETFs rise in value when the 
investment you’re betting against falls in value. So if you’re betting against 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Dow falls 2 percent during the 
day, your inverse ETF gains 2 percent. Some inverse ETFs even let you goose 
returns by leveraging, or using borrowed money, to increase your gain when 
you correctly bet that an investment will fall in value. Confused yet? Well, 
these funds have some big‐time things to be careful of. First of all, they tend 
to have very high expense ratios, largely due to the fact that they may use 
borrowed money. Also, keep in mind that these ETFs are reset daily and are 
not extremely effective in betting against an investment over the long term. 
That means if the investment you’re betting against has wild daily swings, 
you might not get the long‐term performance you’re expecting.
ETFs Have Issues, Too
ETFs are great for many investors who are looking for ways to keep their 
costs down and simplify their lives. After all, you can buy all your stock 
and ETF investments from the same brokerage account. But ETFs have 
­drawbacks, too, as the following list makes clear:
✓
✓Commissions: Unlike mutual funds, which can often be bought with no 
commissions through online brokers or directly from fund companies, 
ETFs are treated like stocks. That means your online broker’s standard 
stock commission applies (unless the ETF is on a list of funds that can 
be bought or sold for no commission). That can be a deal‐killer if you 
make frequent and small investments. Unless you use an online broker 
with free trades, such as those I discuss in Chapter 4, you might be 
better off with an index mutual fund.
✓
✓Temptation: The capability to trade in and out of ETFs is too irresist-
ible for some investors — the kind who can’t keep their fingers off their 
mouse buttons. If the constant pricing of ETFs encourages you to trade 
too much and veer off your asset allocation course, you might be better 
off with mutual funds.
✓
✓Invisible cost — the spread: ETFs come with an invisible, but costly, 
fee. Just as with stocks, ETFs have a bid and an ask price. The bid is 
the price other investors are willing to pay for the ETF, and the ask is 
the price the seller will take. The difference, called the spread, costs 
­investors money.
For example, say you bought 100 shares of an ETF at the ask price of 
$100. Most likely, you’d only be able to sell it for $99.90 or less, costing 
you in effect 10 cents a share. The less popular an ETF, the wider the 
spread becomes, and the greater this cost becomes. Are you curious 
about what an ETF’s bid and ask prices are? They’re available from the 
same places you get stock quotes.

267

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
✓
✓Premiums and discounts: ETFs are priced based on what buyers and 
sellers are willing to pay for the basket of stocks they own. That means 
the price of an ETF might be greater or less than the value of the stocks 
it owns. When the ETF price is greater than the value of the stocks it 
owns, that situation is a premium, and when the opposite is true and the 
ETF is worth less than the value of its stocks, the ETF is said to be trad-
ing at a discount. You can look up the size of the premium or discount for 
an ETF at www.morningstar.com using the previous directions to find 
the expense ratio.
Don’t get overly concerned with the premium or discount. Most ETFs’ 
premiums and discounts are rather small. And for popular ETFs, they 
are practically nonexistent. It’s yet another reason to stick with the larg-
est and most established ETFs from the biggest players.
A Few Final Things to  
Consider about ETFs
One of the reasons ETFs have been so popular is that they make it easy to 
invest in assets that were difficult to invest in before. By buying a single ETF 
just as you’d buy a stock, you can instantly invest in a basket of companies 
working on alternative energy or in financial commodities like gold. Because 
ETFs have made it much easier to invest in a wide array of investments, it’s 
more important than ever for investors to know how to find out exactly what 
they’re buying when they purchase an ETF by reading the prospectus. The 
following sections show you how.
Using ETFs as a way to invest in themes
Investors might periodically want to get a stake on a trend they feel will be 
important in the future. Some investors, for instance, feel global warming 
is a serious issue and want to invest in stocks that are finding new sources 
of energy that generate less pollution. Other investors can’t bear to invest 
in companies they feel contribute to social ills, so they focus on socially 
responsible ETFs. ETFs are perfect for this kind of thing because you can 
invest in an index that tracks a basket of stocks involved in the theme you’re 
interested in. You can invest in the trend by just buying one investment and 
spreading your risk over several companies.
ETFs that invest in specialty areas of interest generally charge higher expense 
ratios and may not generate large returns to warrant the costs. Before invest-
ing in an investing theme, make sure that you’re not getting caught up in a 
fad. Also, make sure that you’re not spending money on management fees 
that could have been better spent just donating directly to a charity.

268
Part II: Using Online Investment Resources 
A few examples of specialty ETFs include those listed in Table 11‐3.
Investors who buy an ETF that tracks a theme might feel they’ve reduced 
their risk by owning many companies, not just one. There’s a bit of truth to 
that because you’re spreading your risk over many different companies. But 
don’t make the mistake of thinking that owning an ETF alone saves you from 
risk. You’re still at risk if the trend falls apart.
Betting on commodities and  
currencies with ETFs
Buying commodities like oil, gold, and steel, even today, isn’t as convenient 
as you’d think. You usually need to establish a special account with a broker 
that specializes in commodity trading if you want to invest in commodities 
directly. Buying and selling currencies can be a hassle, too. That’s why ETFs 
are a boon for stock investors who would like to add some commodities and 
currencies to their portfolios.
Most of the major commodities and many currencies can be invested 
in through ETFs. Table 11‐4 shows examples for many of the major 
commodities.
Just because you can invest in commodities doesn’t mean you should. 
Despite what the infomercials say, gold, for instance, has been a poor long‐
term performer that has generated subpar returns and greater risk. Be sure 
that you understand the risks of commodities before jumping in.

 Chapter 11: Finding and Buying Exchange‐Traded Funds
Reading the fine print: The prospectus
Like mutual funds, ETFs must be fully described to investors in a prospectus. 
These documents describe ETFs’ structures, investing objectives, fees, and 
all other details to investors — and are filled with legal jumble. But they’re 
worth taking a look at if you’re going to invest in an ETF.
You have several main ways to get the prospectus online, including from the 
following sources:
✓
✓The ETF provider’s website: If you log on to the website of the company 
that provides the investment, you can almost always find a link to the 
prospectus. This is typically the easiest way to find a prospectus.

✓
✓Sources for regulatory filings: ETF prospectuses are regulatory filings, 
so you can retrieve them from many of the same places you’d use to get 
a companies’ filings, as I describe in Chapter 2. Due to the structure of 
ETFs, though, it’s easier to download prospectuses directly from the ETF 
provider. Many ETF families, such as iShares, make it easy to click a link 
and download the prospectus. Figure 11‐2 shows the Prospectus link at

f you’re the kind of online investor looking to buy the next home‐run stock 
like Facebook, this chapter offers tips that might help you. I show you how 
to use online tools to unearth details about companies that aren’t picked up 
by general investing websites. I explain how you can glean insights about 
companies by picking apart financial statements, and I show you how to com-
pare companies with their peers.
Just be careful. Consistently picking winning stocks and buying and selling 
them at the right times is infamously difficult and time consuming. If you 
don’t know what you’re doing, you might make less money picking individual 
stocks over the long term than you would if you just bought a mutual fund or 
exchange‐traded fund (ETF) that keeps up with the market.
Understanding Financial Statements
Most investors focus on companies’ quarterly earnings reports. It’s under-
standable. Stocks rapidly respond to whether a company topped, matched, 
or missed earnings expectations for the quarter. Stocks move by an aver-
age of 5 percent on the day the company reports earnings, says Bespoke 
Investment Group.

274
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Online tools, which I describe in Chapter 6, also make it easy to instantly see 
how a company did during the quarter and decide whether that changes your 
opinion on a stock. When companies report earnings, though, they provide 
only the most basic and top‐level information in a press release.
Short‐term performance can cause stocks to swing momentarily, but long‐
term investors know that a company’s true value is based on how it performs 
over the years, not just the most recent quarter. Examining a company’s 
long‐term performance requires a bit more effort and calls for digging into a 
company’s financial statements. Grab your financial shovel!
Investors that study a company’s financial statements are said to analyze 
the fundamentals. Fundamental analysis is the part art and part science of 
determining how much a company is worth. Warren Buffett, one of the most 
famous investors, uses fundamental analysis to choose investments. If, after 
reading this chapter, you’re interested in finding out more about funda-
mental analysis, you can check out my Fundamental Analysis For Dummies 
(published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). You can find excerpts from the book 
at www.dummies.com/store/product/Fundamental‐Analysis‐For‐
Dummies.productCd‐0470506458.html.
Financial statements are detailed documents that show you all the important 
numbers from a company, ranging from how profitable it is to how finan-
cially secure it is. Most of the detailed financial statements are available 
online a few weeks after the company puts out its earnings press release. The 
financial statements must be contained in documents required by regula-
tors, including
✓
✓The 10‐Q: The official quarterly report that must be filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the main regulator for 
stocks. It gives an update for the just‐completed three‐month period. 
The report is due 40 days after the end of the quarter for companies that 
have market values of $700 million or more.
✓
✓The 10‐K: The official version of a company’s annual report required 
by the SEC. After the end of a company’s fiscal year, the company must 
­provide an annual report called a 10‐K. The 10‐K, for most companies, is 
due 75 days after the end of the fiscal year, according to the SEC (www.
sec.gov/answers/form10q.htm).
The 10‐Q and 10‐K statements are vital because they contain these three key 
financial statements:
✓
✓The income statement measures the company’s bottom line. It tells you 
how much the company earned during the quarter or year based on 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. (GAAP provides the 
rules that all companies and their accountants must follow so that inves-
tors know how to read the numbers.) This statement is also provided in 
the earnings press release, but with less detail.

275

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
✓
✓The balance sheet tabulates the company’s net worth. The statement 
shows you what a company owns and owes at the end of the period. Do 
you want to know how much cash the company has in the bank or how 
much debt it has? Both numbers are in the balance sheet. The balance 
sheet might also be provided with the earnings press release, but with 
less detail.
✓
✓The cash flow statement tells you how much cash came into and went 
out of the company during the period and is considered to be one of the 
most important documents provided by companies.
The cash flow statement is typically not included in a company’s earnings 
press release, but it’s worth waiting for in the 10‐Q and 10‐K. A company’s 
cash flow is more difficult to manipulate using accounting tricks because 
it’s based on the amount of cold hard cash that comes into the company.
You can spend a great deal of time mastering the complexities of ­reading 
companies’ regulatory filings and financial statements. If that interests 
you, SEC (www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/begfinstmtguide.htm) has 
a ­helpful article on financial statements. The kind For Dummies folks are 
­offering free access to my Fundamental Analysis For Dummies Cheat Sheet 
here: www.dummies.com/how‐to/content/fundamental‐analysis‐
for‐dummies‐cheat‐sheet.html.
Downloading financial statements
Investors can get their hands on financial statements almost instantly. 
Numerous sites, listed in Chapter 2, let you download regulatory filings for 
free. The SEC (http://sec.gov/investor/pubs/edgarguide.htm) 
also provides a users’ manual online to show you how to download regula-
tory filings. When you download a regulatory filing, you might be shocked at 
how it looks. They’re typically seas of text and no pictures — they certainly 
aren’t the colorful magazine‐like document you recall when you think of an 
annual report.
The annual report to shareholders is a different document than the 10‐K. 
The annual report to shareholders contains all the required financial state-
ments and information contained in the 10‐Ks, but it’s presented in a colorful 
format. If you’ve read the 10‐K, you probably don’t need the annual report 
to shareholders. But, the annual report to shareholders might provide addi-
tional, mostly promotional information about the company, such as photos 
of new products or happy customers, and they can be fun to look at depend-
ing on what the company does. You can order these paper documents from 
the investor relations section of most companies’ websites, if the company 

276
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
still produces print copies. Many companies, in an effort to save money, are 
only printing 10‐Ks and making annual reports to shareholders available only 
online, if at all. You can obtain the electronic copies of annual reports to 
shareholders at most companies’ websites. Many of these annual reports are 
also available from services like AnnualReports.com (www.annualreports.
com), IRIN Annual Report Resource Center (www.irin.com), and The Public 
Register’s Annual Report Service (www.prars.com). Keep in mind, though, 
that annual reports from these services are often provided in Adobe’s 
Acrobat format. The Acrobat format preserves the photos of the annual 
reports but is harder to download into a spreadsheet to analyze.
The SEC’s Interactive Data initiative represents one of the best ways to 
download financial statements. The SEC is urging companies to make their 
financial results available using the increasingly popular eXtensible Business 
Reporting Language, or XBRL. While companies don’t have to issue their 
reports in XBRL, for the hundreds that do, you can easily download their 
data into a spreadsheet. You’ll know that a company offers its financial 
reports in XBRL if you see a red button in the SEC site’s Edgar search results 
that says Interactive Data, as shown in Figure 12‐1.
How to read the income statement
How much money did the company make? That common question is 
answered, in detail, by the income statement. The income statement begins 
with revenue, which is a measurement of the value of the goods and services 
sold by the company. The company’s expenses are then subtracted from rev-
enue to arrive at the company’s profit. Making things a bit more complicated, 
though, is that profit can mean one of several things:

✓
✓Operating profit, which measures how much the company makes after 
paying day‐to‐day costs, such as buying raw materials that go into the 
product, as well as paying salaries. Operating profit is closely watched 
by Wall Street analysts because it shows how much the company 
earns from its business and excludes distortion from one‐time charges 
and gains.
✓
✓Net income, also known as “the bottom line.” It shows you how much 
the company made after subtracting all its costs. If the company lost 
money, it’s said to have a net loss.

✓Diluted earnings per share, which is what most investors should pay 
attention to. Diluted earnings per share converts a company’s net 
income or net loss into a number that’s more relevant to them: the inves-
tor’s share of the profit. Diluted EPS is the earnings number most profes-
sional investors watch. Diluted EPS is measured by dividing adjusted 
net income by the number of shares outstanding — that’s to say the 
number of shares currently in shareholders’ hands added to the number 
that could be in shareholders’ hands if stock options were exercised. 
Monitoring dilution is important because when executives exercise 
stock options, they get additional shares in the company, so new shares 
are created. And more shares means the company’s profits are cut into 
more slices, making your slice worth less.
✓
✓Basic earnings per share, arrived at by simply dividing a company’s 
net income by shares outstanding. It’s a quick and dirty calculation that 
doesn’t account for how exercised stock options can water down the 
value of your shares.
✓
✓Proforma earnings per share, a controversial way to measure earnings 
that was originally designed to help investors. Proforma earnings allow 
companies to leave out certain expenses to help investors understand 
how the company did, excluding the effect of a big event, like a merger. 
Some companies, though, abused proforma earnings. These companies 
twisted proforma earnings in a way to leave out costs that made their 
results look better than they actually were. Proforma earnings drew 
such ire from regulators that companies are now required to detail step‐
by‐step in their earnings press release what charges were left out of the 
proforma earnings calculation.
The first company accused by regulators of abusing proforma  
earnings was Trump Hotels (http://sec.gov/news/headlines/ 
trumphotels.htm). Given the negative connection many inves-
tors have with proforma earnings, many companies are now avoiding 
the term and calling them adjusted earnings instead. Many Internet 
­companies that sold stock to the public for the first time in 2011 and 
2012, including online coupon site Groupon, online gaming site Zynga, 
and social networking company Facebook, all featured adjusted ­earnings 
in their first quarterly reports.

Basics about the balance sheet
The balance sheet tells you what a company owns and what it owes. The 
company separates what it owns, called its assets, from what it owes, its 
liabilities. The difference between assets and liabilities is what portion of the 
company shareholders own, called shareholders’ equity. The following list 
breaks it all down for you piece by piece:
✓
✓Assets are objects of value the company owns, including property, 
equipment, and machinery. Assets you can’t see or touch like patents 
and trademarks, called intangible assets, are also included. Assets are 
further classified as
•	Current assets: Stuff that will be turned into cold hard cash within a 
year.
•	Non‐current assets: Stuff like trucks and physical equipment that 
isn’t expected to be turned into cash within a year.
✓
✓Liabilities are the company’s obligations. Liabilities include such 
things as bank loans, IOUs given to suppliers, taxes owed, or promises 
to deliver products to customers in the future. Liabilities are further 
classified as
•	Current liabilities: Bills and other obligations due within a year. The 
current portion of long‐term debt, for instance, is the chunk the 
company must pay off within a year.
•	Non‐current liabilities: Long‐term obligations the company doesn’t 
have to pay back within a year.
✓
✓Shareholders’ equity measures the value of the investors’ owner-
ship of the company. It’s kind of the corporate version of your net 
worth. Your net worth is the value of your assets minus your debt. 
Shareholders’ equity is the same: It’s equal to a company’s assets 
minus its liabilities.
One of the best things to pay attention to in the balance sheet is the com-
pany’s number of shares outstanding, which is the number of shares that are 
in the hands of investors. A company’s number of shares outstanding is very 
important because it measures how many pieces the company’s profits are 
sliced into and how big a piece each shareholder gets.

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
What you need to know about  
the cash flow statement
Don’t make the mistake of ignoring the cash flow statement. This statement 
cuts through all the smoke and mirrors of accounting to show you how much 
cold hard cash came into or went out of a company. The statement is divided 
into the following three parts:
✓
✓Cash from operating activities tells you how much cash the company 
used or generated from its normal course of business. This portion of 
the cash flow statement adjusts net income by adding back expenses 
that didn’t cost the company cash, most importantly an expense called 
depreciation that accounts for the cost of wear and tear on equipment.
The stock buyback blues
You’ll want to monitor a company’s number 
of shares outstanding after it says it’s buying 
back stock. Sometimes companies use excess 
cash to buy their own shares. Investors often 
applaud stock buybacks because they can, in 
theory, reduce the number of shares outstand-
ing. And that means each shareholder’s slice of 
the pie gets bigger.
Sounds like a great idea, right? But stock buy-
backs aren’t always what they’re cracked 
up to be. Keep the following in mind when 
you hear that a company has announced a 
stock buyback:
✓
✓Stock buybacks can distort earnings per 
share. If you see a company’s earnings per 
share rise, don’t assume that’s because the 
company is more profitable. If a company 
buys back stock, earnings per share can 
rise even if net income is flat.
✓
✓No rule says that the company must 
follow through. Just because a company 
announces it’s buying back stock, that 
doesn’t mean it will. In fact, some aca-
demic research has found many companies 
that announced stock buybacks actually 
increased their shares outstanding as they 
issued additional shares to give to employ-
ees and executives. You can find out more 
about buybacks at The Buyback Letter 
(www.buybackletter.com).
✓
✓Companies have a lousy track record of 
buying back their stock. You’d think com-
panies would be great investors when 
it comes to their own stock. That’s not 
the case, though. Companies tend to buy 
back their stock when it’s pricey and halt 
buybacks when the shares are cheap. 
Standard & Poor’s 500 companies spent 
a record $172 billion on stock buybacks in 
the third quarter of 2007, just before the 
market peaked in October, S&P says. But 
then in 2009, when stocks were arguably 
dirt cheap, buybacks dried up. Companies 
spent just $24.2 billion on buybacks in the 
second quarter of 2009, the lowest level in 
at least a decade. And guess what? Stocks 
soared more than 120 percent in the follow-
ing five and a half years.

✓
✓Cash from investing activities shows how much cash a company 
uses to invest in new property and equipment, also known as capital 
­expenditures or Cap Ex. The section also shows how much cash the 
­company generates selling assets.
✓
✓Cash from financing activities illustrates how much cash a company 
brings onto its balance sheet, mostly by selling bonds.
Putting it all together
Some of the real power of financial statements occurs when you take elements 
of one statement and compare them with numbers on other statements.
The first thing many investment professionals do when they get an annual 
report, for instance, is to compare the cash flow statement with the income 
statement. If a company is reporting banner profits on the income statement 
but not bringing in as much cash, that’s a potential red flag. Low cash flow 
can be a sign the company has low quality of earnings. A company has low 
quality of earnings when it shows large profits on its financial statements due 
to accounting gimmicks, not because it’s selling lots of goods and services to 
actual customers.
Here’s an easy way for you to analyze a company’s cash flow: Just compare a 
company’s free cash flow with its net income.
You can get the data by doing the following:
✓
✓Analyzing the financial statements yourself: A company’s free cash 
flow measures how much cash it brings in the door after paying 
expenses to keep itself going. Free cash flow (FCF) is a cousin to cash 
from operating activities. FCF, however, is stricter than cash from oper-
ating activities in that it accounts for the fact that companies use cash 
to buy new equipment and facilities. To calculate free cash flow, enter 
the stock’s ticker symbol into the “Enter symbol, name or keyword” 
text field on NASDAQ’s home page (www.nasdaq.com) and then click 
the name of the company when it appears. On the new page that opens, 
click the Income Statement link under the Fundamentals heading. On the 
(next) new page that appears, click the Cash Flow tab at the top of the 
page, which brings you to a page similar to what you see in Figure 12‐2. 
To get the company’s free cash flow, subtract the number in the Capital 
Expenditures row from the number in the Net Cash Flow‐Operating row. 
Compare that difference with the number in the Net Income row.

281

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
✓
✓Getting the data from a website: Several sites, including Morningstar 
(www.morningstar.com), provide free cash flow data. On the 
Morningstar site, in the Quote blank, enter the stock’s symbol or name 
(GE, for instance) and click the name of the company when it pops up. 
On the new page that appears, click the Key Ratios link at the top of the 
page. You can find the company’s free cash flow and free cash flow per 
share listed in the new page that appears.
You have a company’s free cash flow and net income. Now what?

thing many professional investors do.

How to spot trends in financial statements
When you’re studying the financial statements, you should either look for 
patterns or look for things that don’t fit the company’s usual trend. The fol-
lowing sections highlight a few of the things you should pay attention to.
A company’s growth rate
When you get a raise from your boss, what’s the first thing you want to 
know? How much of a percentage increase it is from your previous year’s 
salary. The same goes for every item on a company’s income statement and 
balance sheet. You could go through every item on the financial statements 
and calculate the change from last year by hand, but Reuters, shown in 
Figure 12‐3, can do it for you. Here’s how:
1.	Point your browser to www.reuters.com/finance/stocks.
The Reuters Stocks home page appears.
2.	Enter the stock’s ticker symbol into the Search Stocks field.
3.	Click the Search button and select the company you’re interested in.
You see the Overview page for the company whose ticker symbol 
you entered.
How free cash flow saved investors from Enron
Unsuspecting investors lost billions invest-
ing in Enron, an energy company that turned 
into one of America’s biggest companies. 
Even professional investors were left holding 
the bag as the company went from corpo-
rate giant to one of the biggest bankruptcies 
in U.S. history. But investors who compared 
Enron’s free cash flow with net income 
were glad they did. Enron’s quarterly state-
ment from the first quarter of 2001 before its 
collapse (www.sec.gov/Archives/ 
e d g a r / d a t a / 1 0 2 4 4 0 1 /
0 0 0 1 0 2 4 4 0 1 0 1 5 0 0 0 1 4 / 
ene10‐q.txt) is very telling. During the 
quarter, Enron wowed investors with net 
income of $425 million. But investors who took 
the time to study the quarterly report saw that 
the company burned $464 million in cash from 
operations and another $382 million in capital 
expenditures. That means Enron effectively 
burned up $846 million in cash, even while tell-
ing investors how profitable the company was.

4.	Click the Financials tab, then scroll down to the Growth Rates section.
Here you can find the growth rates of sales and earnings per share (EPS) 
in the most recent quarter, called MRQ. Reuters also shows you the 
­company’s earnings growth rate in the trailing 12 months, called TTM. 
Lastly, you can view longer‐term growth rates in earnings and capital 
expenditures over the past five years.
A company’s financial composition
Many professional investors compare each item on the income statement with 
revenue and each item on the balance sheet with total assets. This lets you 
find interesting trends, such as whether the company is increasing its spend-
ing on research and development or whether the company’s debt is rising. 
You just need to divide each item on the income statement by revenue and 
each item on the balance sheet by total assets to perform this analysis, called 
common sizing. Investopedia teaches you how to common‐size a balance 
sheet (www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonsizebalancesheet.
asp) and an income statement (www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ 
commonsizeincomestatement.asp). NetMBA (www.netmba.com/
finance/statements/common‐size) also explains why common‐sizing 
financial statements is a good idea.

Using financial statements to  
understand the company
Financial statements can help you understand the structure and objective of 
a company. Consider the following aspects of the company:
✓
✓Value: Some investors try to figure out how much a company is worth 
by using its financial statements. If the company is worth more than 
the stock price would suggest, that tells these value investors the stock 
might be undervalued. One way investors determine how much a com-
pany is worth is by examining book value. Book value is an accounting 
principle. Just know that book value generally measures the value of the 
company’s tangible assets recorded in the financial statements, minus 
liabilities. If the company’s market value is less than the book value, 
some investors see it as being undervalued. The market value — the 
stock price times the number of shares outstanding — tells you how 
much the company is worth in investors’ eyes. I show you how to use 
the price‐to‐book ratio to determine whether a stock is undervalued or 
overvalued in Chapter 13.
✓
✓Growth prospects: Some investors look for companies that post gigantic 
earnings or revenue growth, hoping to dig up the next market leaders. 
Growth companies generally don’t pay large dividends and prefer to keep 
any extra cash to invest in new products. Rapidly rising revenue and 
earnings are signs that a company has morphed into a growth company.
✓
✓Link to broader economic cycles: Some companies’ earnings and rev-
enue rise and fall along with swings in the broader economy. These 
companies are called cyclical companies because they follow economic 
cycles. Typically, industrial companies like steelmakers belong to 
this category.
✓
✓Protection from economic cycles: Companies that don’t follow the 
economy’s ups and downs are often called defensive companies. These 
include companies, such as utilities, hospitals, and grocery stores, that 
tend to sell the same amount of goods no matter what the economy is 
doing. If there’s a recession – you still need to eat, don’t you?

285

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
✓
✓Stability and sustainability: Some companies generate steadily increas-
ing revenue and earnings because they rely on several products with 
stable demand. Many large companies belong to this category. But 
companies involved in finding breakthroughs, such as biotech com-
panies researching cures and oil companies looking for untapped 
reserves, have big ups and downs in their earnings based on their luck. 
Companies with volatile earnings are called speculative companies.
✓
✓Debt load: The balance sheet shows you how much money the company 
is borrowing. You can compare a company’s debt load with its share-
holders’ equity to see how heavy the debt load is. Understanding how 
much debt companies had was critical during the financial crisis. Many 
companies that borrowed too much found themselves unable to pay 
back the banks and wound up in financial quicksand. I show you how to 
use computer screening tools to find companies with low debt levels in 
Chapter 14.
Unearthing Details about the Company 
from Regulatory Filings
Many of the things you need to know about companies, contained in quar-
terly and annual reports, are pulled out for you by the financial websites I 
describe in Chapters 2 and 6. Nearly all the vital company information you 
need is easily obtained that way, including the following:
✓
✓Company descriptions, or profiles, that tell you what the company does
✓
✓Major owners of the stock, including large mutual funds and 
pension funds
✓
✓Names of the officers and directors, their ages, and their experience
✓
✓Dividends paid by the company
✓
✓Number of employees
But as helpful as the financial websites are, they’re missing a great deal of 
textual information contained in companies’ annual reports. That means it’s 
up to you to read the company’s regulatory filings to get the full picture. You 
can glean some interesting details about the company if you take the time.

286
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Finding the nitty‐gritty description  
of the company
Most 10‐K filings contain a company overview section. This overview goes 
into exhaustive detail about the company’s business, well beyond the quick 
snapshot descriptions offered on financial websites. For instance, a company 
can outline what countries it has facilities and employees located in. The 
company might also break out what parts of its business are the largest.
If you’re investing in a large diversified company like General Electric, which 
is involved in many businesses, you can get a grasp of the company’s entire 
empire from the company overview in the 10‐K. The company overview might 
also show you what parts of its business are the largest and most profitable.
Getting the details on company  
announcements
When a company has an important event — referred to by investment pros 
as a material event — the company is required to tell shareholders about 
it. Companies might inform shareholders by issuing a press release, which 
you can find out how to access online in Chapter 2. But it must also provide 
details of the announcement to regulators in the form of a Form 8‐K. The 
SEC (http://sec.gov/answers/form8k.htm) explains all the corporate 
events that require companies to file 8‐Ks. Companies have four days to pro-
vide an 8‐K in most cases.
Finding out whether the company  
is being sued
When companies put out glowing press releases about their new products or 
services, they rarely bring up news about the lawsuits they might be facing. 
Although most lawsuits end up amounting to nothing, they’re something you 
want to be aware of. Nearly all companies’ 10‐Ks contain a Legal Proceedings 
section that lists pending lawsuits and says how serious the company 
thinks they are.
Regulatory filings are typically giant seas of text. When perusing a filing 
online, you can quickly skip to different areas by pressing Ctrl+F. You can 
then enter a search term, such as legal proceedings, and jump right to that 
section in the filing.

287

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
You can also check online whether a company is being sued as part of a 
securities class action lawsuit, where investors allege they were defrauded. 
The Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse (http://
securities.stanford.edu) is an excellent resource to see whether a 
company you’re invested in is a party of one of these suits.
Getting the truth from management
CEOs and top management must include in their company 10‐Ks a section 
called Management’s Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A. This is where the 
company must tell regulators how the year went and give its honest assess-
ment of how the business is performing.
Many professional investors read the MD&A section from the prior year 
before reading the one from the just‐completed year and compare the two. 
It’s telling to see what forecasts management made in the previous year and 
then find out whether they came true.
When disaster strikes: Head for the 10‐K
Getting sued is one of the certainties of busi-
ness. It’s pretty typical for companies to list out 
various lawsuits they face, some of which are 
minor but others are potential landmines. If you 
read companies’ 10‐Ks carefully, you can find 
lurid legal details they probably aren’t eager 
for the public to know. Sometimes the legal 
battles are between companies. Starbucks, for 
instance, lays out in detail its legal skirmish with 
Kraft Foods in its 10‐K for the fiscal year ended 
Oct. 2, 2011. Starbucks told Kraft it was discon-
tinuing its deal with the food giant to distribute 
coffee to grocery stores. Kraft fired back at 
Starbucks, saying the coffee giant breached a 
contract between the two companies. Investors 
need to be informed of such potentially signifi-
cant legal events. Other times, regulators are 
the ones going after companies. Google, an 
online advertising company that later renamed 
itself Alphabet, told investors in its 2014 annual 
report it was the subject of several govern-
ment investigations over its business practices. 
Antitrust actions by governments, especially the 
European Commission, can be a major head-
wind for companies. Sometimes legal battles 
can be devastating. Massey Energy, for exam-
ple, owned the Upper Big Branch coal mine, 
which on April 5, 2010, exploded and killed 29 
miners. It was one of the worst mining accidents 
in U.S. history. Investors trying to access the 
legal hit got a detailed presentation in the com-
pany’s 10‐K for the year ended December 31, 
2010. Dozens of lawsuits were filed, and all the 
key facts are spelled out over several pages. 
Ultimately, Massey was sold in 2011 and the 
new operator shut the mine down in April 2012.

288
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Seeing whether the company has gotten 
into a tiff with its auditors
Companies must hire accounting firms to look over, or audit, their annual 
financial statements. Typically, the accounting firms study the ­company’s 
results and sign off with a Good Housekeeping seal of approval. But 
­periodically, the auditors find a problem, and that’s something you want to 
know about as an investor.
You can find out about accounting problems by opening a company’s annual 
report and searching for the word restatement. A restatement usually outlines 
any problems the company or its auditor has found with the accounting. 
Restatements can be a real shock to investors because they mean companies 
might not have earned as much money as they previously said they did.
When a company finds problems with its financial statements, it’s given a 
warning by the stock market exchange to fix the problems. During the time 
the company tries to fix its accounting, it’s said to be delinquent in its ­filings. 
This can be a dangerous time to invest in a company’s stock because it’s 
unknown what the company’s actual results will end up being. The ­easiest 
way to find out whether a company is delinquent is by going to Yahoo! 
Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com), entering the stock symbol into the 
ticker symbol field, and clicking the name of the company when it pops up. 
If the company is delinquent, you can see a warning on the top of the quote 
page stating that fact. Additionally, if the stock has been delisted and trades 
on the OTC Bulletin Board market, its ticker symbol can tell the story. A fifth 
letter, an “E,” may be added to the stock’s four‐letter ticker symbol to indi-
cate the stock is delinquent in required filings. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/delinquent/ 
delinqindex.htm) also puts out notices to investors when a company is 
delinquent with its filings. If you see a stock on the SEC’s list — run, don’t 
walk away from that investment.
Weighing the risk of failure
One of the biggest reasons to bother with reading financial statements is to 
look for red flags or warnings of trouble at the company. One of the easiest 
signs of trouble you might find, albeit late, is when auditors warn that they 
question whether the company can continue as a “going concern.” If you see 
these words in a company filing, take notice.

289

 Chapter 12: Putting Companies Under the Microscope
Seeing what the company is worried about
Companies must include a Risks section in their annual reports. These sec-
tions are stuffed with blanket statements about all the bad things that could 
happen. Sometimes the company will point out a risk it faces that you might 
not have thought of. Just search for the word risks.
Assessing how much the company’s  
management is getting paid
When you’re searching through the company filings, don’t overlook the 
boring‐sounding DEF 14A. These reports, more commonly called proxy state-
ments, are about the juiciest reading you can get about a company. These 
statements are among the most frank documents released by a company 
because they disclose how much the company executives get paid. You can 
download them by using the same steps used to download other regulatory 
filings, but the SEC (www.sec.gov/answers/proxyhtf.htm) explains spe-
cifically how to download company proxy statements.
Search the proxy for the compensation table. Typically, you see each top 
executive’s pay broken down into the following categories:
✓
✓Salary
✓
✓Bonus
✓
✓Stock awards
✓
✓Stock option awards
✓
✓Pension value
✓
✓All other compensation
✓
✓Total compensation
The proxy statement also contains details about what other perks execu-
tives receive, such as paid‐for apartments and personal use of the corporate 
jet. How do you know whether the company executives are being overpaid? 
A few websites help you analyze executives’ pay packages, including the 
following:
✓
✓AFL‐CIO (www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch): Big Labor 
has a stake in what Fat Cat executives make, so it shouldn’t come as a 
surprise that the AFL‐CIO provides a free Executive Paywatch, which 
shows you how much executives were paid and how they rank. Just 
enter the stock symbol into the Ticker Symbol field and click Go.

✓
✓Salary.com (http://swz.salary.com/execcomp/layoutscripts/ 
excl_companysearch.asp): This site offers a free salary wizard 
that breaks down how much all the top dogs at publicly traded 
­companies earn.
✓
✓Equilar (www.equilar.com/press‐releases.html) is a ­consulting 
firm that helps monitor how much executives are getting paid. The 
company charges for its services, but it does provide some data at 
no charge. Equilar routinely releases data on executive pay in its 
press releases.
Determining how independent the  
company’s leadership is
A company’s board of directors is supposed to be the shareholders’ ­champion 
in the board room. The board is a group of business experts, elected by 
the shareholders, to represent them at important company meetings. All 
pay packages and strategic decisions must be approved by the board, so 
you want to make sure that the board represents the best interests of the 
shareholders.
The proxy statement is an excellent source of information about the 
­company’s officers and board members. You almost always find a Related 
Party Transactions section, where the company must disclose any insider 
dealings between the company’s officers, directors, and the company itself. 
For instance, if a board member’s firm has a business relationship with the 
company, you’d want to know because it could skew the board member’s 
judgment. With the proxy statement loaded on your screen, just search for 
the terms related party transactions.

hen investors say they bought a stock because “it’s a good company,” 
you should automatically become skeptical. As you find out in this 
chapter, one of the biggest mistakes investors make is confusing a company 
and its stock. They’re not the same thing.
A company is a business that sells things to customers and tries to make a 
profit. A company’s success is measured by its revenue and earnings growth, 
things I discuss in Chapter 11. But a stock is a different animal. Stocks are 
essentially pieces of ownership in a company. Stock prices are determined 
by how much investors are willing to pay to own a piece of a company. If 
too many people think a company is good, they might pay top dollar for the 
stock and drive up its valuation. And when a valuation rises, your potential 
future return decreases. Valuations are the root of one of the most perverse 
realities in investing: Good companies can be bad stocks. If you overpay for a 
stock, even if the company delivers great earnings growth, you can still lose 
money. Savvy investors know the price they pay for a stock is one of the big-
gest factors that determines how much they’ll profit.
This chapter shows you how to find good stocks with reasonable valuations. 
Although measuring valuations can get math heavy, I spare your calculator a 
workout by showing you online tools that can do much of the work for you. 
You also discover the ins and outs of the price‐to‐earnings ratio, one of the 
most commonly used — and misunderstood — ways to measure a stock’s 
valuation. I show you stock tools that step you through the process of pick-
ing stocks and ways to compare a company’s valuation with its peers.

Finding Out How to Not  
Overpay for Stocks
Even if you find a great company with a top‐notch management team and 
popular products, it doesn’t mean you should buy the stock. Why not? The 
sad truth is you’re probably not the first or only person to know about the 
company’s bright future. And if other investors bought the stock already, 
they likely have pushed the stock price higher. When a stock price has 
already risen in anticipation of good news, the good news has been priced 
in. That means even if the good news you’re expecting pans out, the stock 
price might not budge — or may even fall — because it already nosed up 
­previously in anticipation of the good news.
The difficulty of evaluating a stock’s valuation is one reason why investing 
in individual stocks is more complex than buying and holding index mutual 
funds and exchange‐traded funds (ETFs). Before I show you how to measure 
a stock’s valuation, I run through the things you should ask yourself before 
you decide to buy a stock:
✓
✓Does the stock fit into your asset allocation? If your portfolio is already 
stuffed with small companies, you might not want to add another small 
company. Instead, you should invest in different types of companies that 
better fit your asset allocation plan. (I talk about asset allocation plans 
in Chapter 9.)
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) provides an easy way to find 
out where a stock would fit in your asset allocation plan. Just type the 
stock symbol in the Quote box and click the name of the company when 
it pops up. Scroll down quite a way and you can see the Company Profile 
section. In the Company Profile section, you’ll find the Morningstar Style 
Box in the middle of the page — right there under the Stock Style head-
ing. (The Morningstar Style Box is very small, so it’s easy to miss, but it’s 
a big help.) The box uses a nine‐by‐nine grid (see Figure 13‐1) to show 
you whether the stock is large, mid‐sized, or small. (The grid also tells 
you whether the stock is value priced or is a growth stock.)
✓
✓Does the stock have solid fundamentals? When you pick apart a 
­company’s financial statements, as I describe in Chapter 11, you’re 
doing what’s known as fundamental analysis. Essentially, you determine 
how fast the company’s revenue and earnings are growing and examine 
the management. (Much of what you need to know about fundamental 
­analysis can be found in Chapter 11.)

293

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
✓
✓Does the stock stack up favorably against the competition? Companies 
that have a defendable edge against rivals — typically thanks to a strong 
brand name — can remain more profitable. (I show you how to find a 
company’s competitors in Chapter 6.)
✓
✓Is the price for the stock reasonable? You should study how much 
other investors are paying for the stock before you jump in. Overpaying 
for a good company is just as bad as overpaying for a bad one. You 
might lose money in both cases. You see how to measure a stock’s 
­valuation in the next section of this chapter.
A stock’s price alone doesn’t tell you how expensive or cheap a stock is. 
Just because one company’s stock price is $100 and another company’s 
stock is trading for $1 doesn’t mean the $1‐a‐share company is cheaper or 
a better deal. The stock’s share price must be compared with something 
else, such as earnings or revenue, to determine its value.

stock is

Quick ways to determine  
how pricey a stock is
Determining whether a stock is cheap or overvalued is an arduous process 
that can be a full‐time job, even for investment pros. Luckily, there’s one 
quick way you can get an idea of how pricey a stock is: valuation ratios. 
Valuation ratios give you a rough idea of a stock’s value by comparing the 
stock price with a measure taken from the company’s financial statements.
Most financial websites that provide stock quotes, including the ones 
discussed in Chapter 2, provide several valuation ratios. Reuters (www.
reuters.com/finance/stocks), for instance, provides you with nearly all 
the important valuation measures on one screen. Just enter the stock symbol 
in the Enter Stock Symbol text field and then click the red Search button. Find 
and click on the name of the company. Find and click on the Financials tab. If 
you scroll down, you find more ratios than you can shake a stick at.
Table 13‐1 lists a few valuation ratios you should pay the most attention to.
In search of low returns
Investors figure if they buy the stocks of “good 
companies,” they’ll get great returns. But 
research has shown that’s not always true. 
Companies that are growing and have popular 
products, but are so trendy with investors that 
their shares have lofty valuations, tend to be 
poor investments.
It’s not just theory. In Tom Peters’ landmark 1982 
book In Search of Excellence, Peters, a man-
agement expert, extolled companies he deter-
mined to be the best. Had you bought $100 worth 
of stock in these excellent ­companies in 1981, 
your investment would have grown 82 percent 
to $182 through 1985, according to research by 
market strategist Michelle Clayman. But here’s 
the funny part: Clayman created a ­portfolio of 
“unexcellent” ­companies that were missing 
all the things that made the excellent compa-
nies great. The same $100 invested in these 
unexcellent companies ­outperformed the 
excellent ones by a wide margin. The same 
$100 invested in the unexcellent companies 
jumped 198 percent and turned into $298. The 
counterintuitive idea that the best companies 
are often not the best stocks is described 
at length at Damodaran Online (http://
pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/
pdfiles/invfables/ch6new.pdf), a 
site dedicated to stock valuations maintained 
by Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at 
New York University.

Table 13-1	
Guide to Valuation Ratios That Matter
This Valuation Ratio
Tells You How Much Investors . . .
Price‐to‐earnings (P/E)
Are willing to pay for each dollar in earnings the company 
­generates. P/E ratio is measured by dividing the stock 
price by the company’s annual earnings. A high P/E ratio 
tells some investors that the stock is overvalued, and a 
low P/E ratio shows it’s undervalued.
Price‐to‐sales
Are paying for each dollar the company brings in as 
­revenue. It’s the company’s stock price divided by its 
annual revenue. This ratio is typically used to value early‐
stage companies, like ­biotech firms, that lose money, so 
they don’t have a P/E ratio.
Price–to–book value
Are paying for each dollar of the company’s assets, minus 
money owed to others. The price–to–bookvalue ratio is 
the stock’s price divided by the company’s book value per 
share. A company’s book value measures the value of 
what it owns (assets) minus what it owes (liabilities). The 
price–to–bookvalue ratio is very important and is a key 
measure used to determine whether a stock is a value‐
priced stock or a growth stock. A low price–to–bookvalue 
ratio, typically 1 or lower, might signal an undervalued 
stock.
Price–to–tangible book 
value
Are paying for each dollar of physical assets owned by the 
­company. It’s the stock price divided by the company’s book 
value per share, excluding assets you can’t touch or feel.
Price‐­earnings–to–
growth
Are willing to pay for the company’s earnings growth. 
The price‐earnings–to–growth (or PEG) ratio compares 
a company’s P/E ratio to its expected growth rate. The 
PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the stock’s P/E ratio 
by its expected growth rate. The expected growth rate is 
forecasted by analysts who follow the company. A PEG 
ratio of 2 or higher tells investors that the stock is either 
expected to grow very rapidly or that the stock is overval-
ued. Reuters doesn’t give you the PEG ratio, but it gives 
you the P/E ratio and the growth rate, so you can easily 
figure it out.
Price–to–free cash 
flow
Value each dollar of cash that flows into the company as 
part of its doing business. It’s the stock price divided by 
free cash flow.
Dividend yield
Receive in dividends relative to the stock price. The 
dividend yield is the company’s annual dividend payment 
divided by the stock price. If a $30 stock has a dividend 
yield of 5%, that means it is paying $1.50 per share every 
year in dividends ($30 × 5% = $1.50). Stocks with high 
­dividend yields are seen as potentially being undervalued.

296
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
The P/E ratio is the rock star of valuation ratios and gets most of the atten-
tion. The P/E ratio is popular because it’s easy to understand. Imagine a 
stock price is $30 a share, and the company earned $1.50 a share. That means 
investors are paying a price that’s 20 times higher than the company’s earn-
ings. If the price of earnings, or P/E, is high, it means that the earnings are 
very valuable to other people, usually because they expect the company to 
grow rapidly.
Still confused about what a P/E ratio means? Imagine that a company put 
all the money it earned per share during the year in a box, promised to add 
more money if it was profitable in the future, and auctioned it off. Say the 
company earned $1 a share, so $1 was in the box. If investors paid $1 for the 
box, the stock would have a P/E ratio of 1. But if a bidding war ensued and 
someone paid $20 for the box that contained a dollar of earnings, the stock 
would have a P/E ratio of 20.
P/E ratios can get more complicated because different people measure earn-
ings differently. A trailing P/E ratio divides the stock price by the company’s 
earnings over the past four quarters. A forward P/E ratio divides the stock 
price by what the company is expected to earn over the next four quarters. 
Both ways to measure P/E ratios are correct; just know which one you’re 
talking about.
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) gives both the trailing P/E ratio and 
the forward P/E ratio. Just enter the stock’s symbol into the Quote box and 
click the name of the company when it pops up. Next, click the Valuation tab. 
Scroll down and you will find the stock’s trailing P/E listed as Price/Earnings 
under the Current Valuation section. Look down a bit further and you’ll find 
the Forward Valuation section. The Forward Price/Earnings ratio is the for-
ward P/E ratio.
Be careful. Some sites like Google Finance (www.google.com/finance) 
­provide a P/E ratio but don’t indicate whether it’s a forward or trailing P/E 
ratio, making it too ambivalent to be useful.
Ways to interpret valuations
If you took a look at Chapter 1 and figured out from my discussion there that 
you’re a passive (as opposed to an active) investor, then you’re pretty sure 
that the stock price actually measures what one share of a stock is worth, or 
its fair value. If the market is willing to pay $20 for a stock, the stock is worth 
$20 at that time based on publicly available information. Passive investors 
believe markets are efficient over the long term and set stock prices that 
reflect all available public information. But active investors (including bargain 
hunters known as value investors) believe the stock market is inefficient and 
tends to overpay or underpay for stocks from time to time. These investors 
try to find out whether a stock is too expensive or cheap by studying its valu-
ation ratios and comparing them with the following:

297

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
✓
✓The rest of the market: Some investors compare valuation ratios, such 
as the price–to–bookvalue ratio and dividend yield, with the Standard & 
Poor’s 500 to get an idea of whether the company might be undervalued. 
If the valuation ratios are lower than the S&P 500’s, that tells some inves-
tors that the stock might be undervalued.
S&P Dow Jones provides data on its index’s valuation at http://
us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp‐500. Concentrate on find-
ing out the following:
•	Dividend yield: First, click the Additional Info button on the left 
side of the screen. From the menu that pops up, choose Indicated 
Rate Change. A spreadsheet opens on your screen. The spread-
sheet displays the dividend yield of different stock market indexes, 
including the all‐popular Standard & Poor’s 500. You can also see 
the dividend yields of different sectors and different periods of 
time. It’s a little tricky to find, but Figure 13‐2 should help you.
•	P/E ratio: Follow the same directions as in the preceding bullet, but 
instead select Index Earnings. The spreadsheet gives you the S&P 
500’s P/E ratio over several years. Scroll down and look for the As 
Reported Earnings P/E column, which lists the S&P’s P/E ratio at the 
end of each quarter. Notice as well that the P/E ratio rises and falls 
as investors get bullish and bearish about stocks and the economy.

✓The industry: It’s also a good idea to compare a stock’s valuation ratios 
with other stocks in the industry. Some industries tend to grow more 
slowly and almost always have a lower valuation than the stock market. 
That means the only way to know whether a stock’s valuation is truly 
lower than average is to compare it with the ratios of similar companies.
Reuters’ Financials pages, described in the previous section, give you 
valuation ratios for individual stocks in addition to the industry and 
stock market. Enter the stock’s symbol into the Search Stocks text field, 
click the Search button, and select the name of the company. Click the 
Financials tab. Scroll down and you can see how the valuation ratios 
compare with the company’s industry, sector, and the S&P 500. If you’d 
like to dig a bit deeper, Damodaran Online (http://pages.stern.
nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pbvdata.html) 
provides price–to–bookvalue ratios for many industries.
Some investors completely ignore P/E ratios. These investors figure 
that good companies are worth paying more for and deserve higher 
P/E ratios. In these investors’ minds, a high P/E ratio is justified just as 
a Monet deserves a bigger price tag than a velvet Elvis painting sold at 
a flea market. These investors tend to pay more attention to how fast a 
company is growing as well as to patterns in its price movements. I dis-
cuss such investors in greater detail in the “Taking It Further: Technical 
Analysis and Initial Public Offerings” bonus chapter on this book’s com-
panion website.
✓
✓Guidelines: Investors typically have a general idea of what they think 
makes a cheap or expensive stock. Some investors, for instance, think a 
stock is reasonably priced if the PEG ratio is less than 2. You can calcu-
late a stock’s PEG ratio yourself by dividing the P/E ratio by the growth 
rate, or you can get it from Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.
com) by putting the stock’s symbol in the Enter Symbol field, clicking 
the name of the company, and then clicking the Key Statistics link on 
the left side of the page. You find the PEG ratio under the Valuation 
Measures heading.
As for other resources, check out MoneyChimp (www.moneychimp.
com/articles/valuation/peg.htm) for its PEG ratios and Investor 
Home (www.investorhome.com/anomfun.htm) for some guidelines 
for you to follow regarding other valuation ratios.
✓
✓Index membership: Most of the major providers of stock market 
indexes categorize stocks as being value or growth. The index providers 
have sophisticated screens that rank stocks based on a number of valua-
tion metrics. If you’re not sure whether a company you’re considering is 
a growth or value stock, you can see which index it fits in. For instance, 
if you want a list of the largest value‐priced stocks, go to the area of S&P 
Dow Jones Indices’ website dedicated to value and growth stock indexes 
(http://us.spindices.com/index‐family/us‐equity/style). 
When you’re there, click on either the S&P 500 Pure Growth or S&P 500 
Pure Value charts. Next, a new page dedicated solely to the index you

chose loads. Click on the Constituents tab at the top of the chart. A list 
of the largest 10 stocks in the index appears. Below this list is a “Full 
Constituents List,” which gives you all the stocks in the index.
If that’s too much clicking around, you can add links to the index pages 
as Favorites using your browser. You can access the S&P 500 Pure 
Growth index at http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/

Studying stocks using automated tools
Is your head spinning with all this talk of P/E ratios, book value, and other 
ratios? Don’t worry. Several online tools can hold your hand through the pro-
cess of analyzing a stock’s valuation. The following list highlights sites that 
are excellent places to start to get you thinking about what goes into evaluat-
ing a company’s stock price and see whether it might fit in your portfolio:
✓
✓Quicken’s Stock Evaluator (www.quicken.com/investments/
seceval): This site is the online presence of the popular financial 
software program. You need a member ID and password to access this 
corner of the Quicken site, but after you get them, the Stock Evaluator 
tool takes you step by step through a five‐part analysis of any stock. 
Just enter the stock in the Quote field and click the Go button. Next, 
select the Evaluator option under the Quotes & Research tab. Stock 
Evaluator analyzes stocks’ growth trends, financial health, management 
performance, valuation, and intrinsic value. You can register for the 
site for free.
✓
✓Value Point Analysis Model (www.eduvest.com/vpaff2.html): 
Developed by the folks at the Value Point Analysis Financial Forum, the 
Value Point Analysis Model asks you to enter basic company informa-
tion about a stock. A few of the things you must enter include the com-
pany’s number of shares outstanding, long‐term debt, current dividend, 
projected earnings, and current stock price. After you get all that stuff 
entered, click the Execute button, and the website tells you what it 
thinks the stock is worth — what the site calls its Value Point.
✓
✓BetterInvesting (www.betterinvesting.org): BetterInvesting pro-
vides a Stock Selection Guide to its members that helps evaluate a 
company’s valuation to determine whether the stock is a buy, hold, or 
sell. The Stock Selection Guide, or SSG for short, compares the com-
pany’s expected P/E ratio with its P/E ratios in the past. The Stock 
Selection Guide is available as a paper form you must meticulously fill 
out, but is also found in different software programs you can buy from 
BetterInvesting, which pull down company data automatically. There’s 
also a free trial of an online SSG system called Core SSG.

✓Wikinvest (www.wikinvest.com): Wikinvest tries to bring to investing 
the same concept of open collaboration that Wikipedia brought to the 
encyclopedia. Click the “Search the Wiki” link in the upper‐right corner 
of the screen to get started. Enter a company name or stock symbol into 
the search box and click the search button. You are taken to an analy-
sis screen, which breaks down the company’s trends, leadership, and 
competition.

✓Trefis (www.trefis.com): Ever want to have your own black box that 
would magically analyze stocks? Trefis tries to make that wish a reality. 
Enter a company name or symbol into the search box and click the name 
of the company when it pops up. You’ll see a chart that breaks down the 
company’s different lines of business and shows how important they are 
to the company’s stock price. This site is so good it’s mentioned again 
later in this chapter to help in a different type of analysis.
Shortcomings of studying  
stocks’ valuation ratios
I don’t want to leave you with a misconception many investors have: Just find 
a “cheap” stock with a low valuation, buy it, hold on to it forever, and you’ll 
make money. Unfortunately, investing isn’t that easy. Several problems exist 
with using valuation ratios alone to pick stocks, including the following:
✓
✓Cheap stocks might be cheap for a reason. Sometimes a stock has a 
low valuation because the company is poorly run, it’s in a slow or  
no‐growth industry, or other companies or technologies are stealing 
away customers.
✓
✓You get what you pay for. Sometimes a company might appear to be 
overvalued and have a high P/E ratio. But if the company’s profits grow by 
a huge amount, the P/E ratio will fall and the stock price may skyrocket.
If a company reports strong earnings, a stock’s P/E ratio can suddenly go 
from looking high to looking low. The P/E ratio is the stock price divided 
by earnings. That means if earnings, the denominator of the fraction, 
rise rapidly, the P/E ratio plunges. Imagine a company trading for $40 a 
share that has posted earnings over the past four quarters of $1 a share. 
That gives the stock a pricey‐looking P/E ratio of 40. But if the compa-
ny’s quarterly profit surges and pushes earnings to $2, the P/E ratio falls 
to a more reasonable 20.
✓
✓Dividends aren’t a contract. Some investors target companies with 
high dividend yields. They figure these stock’s prices are temporarily 
depressed. And, as a bonus, even if the stock doesn’t go up, they get 
paid their dividend.
Watch out, though. Dividend payments aren’t written in blood. 
Companies can cut or stop their dividend payments at any time.

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
The armchair investor’s way to not overpay
If you want to buy cheap stocks, but studying P/E ratios and price–to–book 
value ratios makes your head swim, here’s an easy shortcut: Buy an index 
mutual fund or an ETF that owns value‐priced stocks. That way, you own 
stocks that are in value indexes. Generally, the companies that create indexes 
use many measures to determine whether a stock is value or growth. S&P 
Dow Jones Indices ranks companies by book value, cash flow, sales, and 
dividend yield to see whether a stock is a value stock. You can see how S&P 
Dow Jones Indices identifies value stocks (and they’re experts), at http://
us.spindices.com/index‐family/us‐equity/style. On the right 
side of the page are four charts. Below the S&P 500 Pure Value chart is a 
small, easy‐to‐miss link that says “Methodology.” Click that link and you’ll see 
what it takes to pass muster with S&P Dow Jones Indices to be a value stock.

The Four (headless) Horsemen of the Internet
Despite the problems with valuation ratios — 
problems described elsewhere in this ­section — 
they’re still a good way to get a quick idea of 
how highly valued a stock is. When you start 
seeing stocks’ P/E ratios going above 60, though, 
you should get suspicious. Few stocks are able 
to maintain such lofty valuations before getting 
their comeuppance, because investors realize 
they’ve been too bullish. Even if the company can 
boost its earnings by 100 percent for a year or 
two, eventually the industry or the company will 
stumble and bring its stock price back to earth.
Even today, the Internet stock bubble of the 
late 1990s and early 2000s remains the best 
recent example of the dangers of overvaluation. 
Valuations of Internet stocks were inflated as 
investors got caught up in the dot‐com mania. 
Many investors rightly viewed the Internet as 
a huge phenomenon for society and business. 
But, unfortunately, these investors overpaid 
for Internet stocks in March 2000 and doomed 
themselves to lackluster returns. Many Internet 
stocks vanished completely, and those that 
didn’t have been very poor investments for 
anyone who invested at the peak.
The valuations of Cisco, EMC, Oracle, and Sun, 
the leaders of the Internet nicknamed the Four 
Horsemen of the Internet, soared in March 
2000. Their stock prices have since plunged, 
though, erasing tremendous amounts of share-
holder wealth on the way. In fact, just three of 
the horsemen still exist as independent com-
panies. Oracle bought Sun in 2010 for $9.50 a 
share, a fraction of its price of nearly $200‐a‐
share price in March 2000.
Investors, though, seemed to have forgotten 
the lesson of sky‐high P/Es again during the 
second tech mania that kicked off around 2010 
with the boom of mobile devices and apps. 
When GoPro — a maker of digital cameras for 
extreme sports enthusiasts — sold its shares 
to the public for the first time in June 2014, 
­investors paid trailing P/E ratios of upwards 
of 100. But logic quickly set in and shares of 
the company, which soared to $94 a share in 
October 2014, had lost nearly three‐quarters of 
their value by October 2015.

Evaluating Stocks’ Potential  
Return and Risk
If you’re taking a gamble on a stock, you’d better get an ample return to make 
it worth your while. I tell you how to measure your portfolio’s risk and return 
in Chapter 8. It turns out that you can apply the same techniques to individ-
ual stocks. I show you how.
Measuring a stock’s total return
Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but studying how stocks 
have done in the past can help you get a crude handle on what to expect. To 
find how stocks have done previously, you need their total return in previous 
years. A stock’s total return is the amount its price has gone up — its price 
appreciation — plus its dividend. You can get a stock’s total return by the 
­following methods:
✓
✓Checking the company’s website: Some companies include total return 
calculators in the Investor Relations section of their websites.
✓
✓Calculating it by using online stock price downloading services: You 
can download a stock’s annual stock price for different years using ser-
vices described in Chapter 2. Add the company’s stock price at the end 
of the year to the amount per share it paid in dividends during the year. 
Divide that sum by the stock’s price at the end of the previous year and 
multiply by 100, and you have the total return for the year.
✓
✓Using Morningstar: This is a much simpler way to get total returns. The 
investment tracker (www.morningstar.com) provides stocks’ total 
returns going back for five years. Just enter the stock’s symbol into the 
Quote field, click the company’s name, and then click the Performance 
tab at the top of the new page that appears. Ideally, you want more years 
of data than Morningstar gives you, but it’s a start.
After you get the stock’s total returns for many years, enter them into 
Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator at www.graftacs.com/geomean.
php3. (If you’re not sure how to do that, refer to Chapter 8.) After doing that, 
Horton’s Geometric Mean Calculator shows you how much you would have 
gained in the stock each year on average and also how risky it is. You can then 

303

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
compare the stock’s returns and risk with popular indexes, just as you do 
with your portfolio in Chapter 8. If the stock’s returns are lower than the stock 
­market’s and the risk is higher, it might not be a good fit for your portfolio.
There’s a search engine that makes comparing risk and reward super simple — 
and pretty interesting to boot. WolframAlpha (www.wolframalpha.com) may 
not be as famous as some other search engines, but it can pull off some cool 
tricks. Just enter the name of the company and either press the enter key on 
your keyboard or the search icon, which looks like an orange rectangle with 
two lines on it. Scroll down and you’ll find a nifty chart that plots the stock’s 
risk and reward compared with other companies in its industry and the S&P 
500. If your stock is further to the right than the S&P 500 (meaning it’s riskier), 
it had better be higher on the chart, too (meaning it delivers higher returns).
Before you decide a stock is too risky or the returns are too low, you should 
compare its movements to the rest of your portfolio. If a stock rises when the 
other investments in your portfolio go down, it might actually reduce your 
portfolio’s total risk by offering diversification. Some online tools can show you 
whether a stock can diversify your portfolio. Macroaxis (www.macroaxis.
com) provides an impressive tool that will compare an investment’s moves 
with another’s. After signing in, click the Portfolio Center option on the left 
side of the screen. From the screen that appears, choose Analyze Correlations. 
You’ll see a color‐coded matrix that displays how correlated all your invest-
ments are with one another. Hover your mouse over a square and you’ll see if 
the correlation is strong or weak.
Don’t get bogged down with all the scary math terms. Just know this: If the 
correlation is negative, that means the stock you’re considering compared 
with the other one in your portfolio are mirror images of each other. That’s a 
good thing because it means if your portfolio sinks, this stock might rise and 
decrease your overall risk. You can also compare an individual investment 
to your entire portfolio. The site can be used for free, and it’s free to register, 
but you can unlock more features by paying.
Many online stock quote services let you compare several stocks by graphing 
them on the same chart — an easy way to see which stock has done best with 
the help of a colorful chart. To try it out, go to Yahoo! Finance (finance.
yahoo.com), enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in into the 
Quote Lookup field, and click the name of the company. On the new page that 
appears, click the Interactive link that appears on the left side of the page 
under the Charts heading. Next, select the + Comparison menu option and 
either choose from the preset stocks to compare it with or click the blank 
field at the top of the box. If you clicked the blank field, enter the symbol of 
the stocks you want to compare and click the name of the company. A new 
chart appears, superimposing one stock with the other. Don’t just compare 
the stock with other stocks, though; you should also compare it with market 
indexes like the S&P 500 and ETFs that track narrow slices of the market.

Finding out more about risk  
and return online
If you’re interested in finding out more about how a stock’s risk and return 
are linked, you can consult several sites dedicated to the topic. The sites 
listed here are a good start:
✓
✓InvestorGuide.com (www.investorguide.com/igu‐article‐558‐
asset‐allocation‐correlating‐your‐portfolio.html): This 
part of the InvestorGuide site describes why it’s so important for inves-
tors to understand the correlation between the returns they’re getting 
from stocks and the risk they’re accepting.
✓
✓Index Funds Advisors (www.ifa.com): The IFA site helps you under-
stand how individual stocks are often riskier than baskets of stocks in 
index mutual funds. Specifically, IFA features a section about the perils of 
stock picking here: www.ifa.com/12steps/step3/.
Digging Even Deeper: Advanced 
Valuation Techniques
Valuation ratios are often the most popular ways to measure how pricey 
stocks are. But even proponents of valuation ratios acknowledge that such 
ratios do have problems. For instance, it’s not unheard of for a stock with a 
seemingly high P/E ratio of 50 or more to go even higher.
Investors use valuation ratios as general rules, but you have other, more 
involved ways to try to figure out whether a stock is a good buy. Some inves-
tors try to use advanced mathematics to figure out what a company is truly 
worth, or what’s sometimes called its intrinsic value.
Using the dividend discount model  
to see whether a stock is on sale
Sometimes investors get so wrapped up in the drama of online stock invest-
ing that they lose sight of what they’re buying. As a stock investor, you’re 
letting a company use your money to sell goods and services for a profit. If 
the company makes money, it will ultimately give back your fair share of the 
profits over time. Typically, that’s done by paying a dividend. Even young 
companies that don’t pay a dividend now eventually start to as their profits 
exceed their needs for cash.

305

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
And that’s the basis of the dividend discount model approach to valuing 
stocks. The idea is that most companies pay a dividend, and those that don’t 
will. The size of the dividend a company pays, and how quickly it grows, can 
help you figure out how much a company is worth. You can find an ugly for-
mula for a dividend discount model, but I’ll spare you the agony. If you can’t 
resist finding out how the calculation is done, Motley Fool (www.fool.com/
research/2000/features000406.htm) provides a helpful description.
Because this is Investing Online For Dummies, I just list a few handy places on 
the Internet where you can enter a couple variables and have your computer 
do the rest:
✓
✓Calculator Pro (www.calculatorpro.com/calculator/dividend‐
discount‐model‐calculator): This page offers a free calculator that 
may appeal to you if you’d like more control of the assumptions being 
used in the model. The site can tell you how much a stock is worth if 
you enter just three variables:
•	The most recent dividends: The value of the dividends paid by the 
company in the most recent four quarters. The web page calls this 
current dividend.
•	Dividend growth rate: This specifies how rapidly you expect the 
company to boost its dividend. You can either use the rate the 
company has increased dividends in the past, or use its expected 
earnings or dividend growth rate.
•	Your required rate of return: This is the return you’re expecting from 
the stock. If it’s a risky stock, your required rate of return might 
be 15 percent or much higher. And if it’s a conservative stock, you 
might have a required rate of return of less than 10 percent.
The calculator spits out how much it thinks the stock is worth based on 
the data you entered.
✓
✓Damodaran Online (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/
New_Home_Page/spreadsh.htm#valmodels): NYU Finance Professor 
Aswath Damodaran provides an entire page of financial spreadsheets 
to keep your computer more than happy crunching numbers. If you 
scroll down to the Focused Valuation Models area, you see a simple 
Stable Growth, Dividend Discount Model spreadsheet. Click the ddmst.
xls link, and the spreadsheet should open. You need to enter data 
in the cells highlighted in yellow, and the spreadsheet does all the 
math for you.
The dividend discount model is pretty clever and is used by many serious 
investment professionals. But the model has some big problems. The model 
is extremely sensitive to your assumptions, especially the required rate of 
return or discount rate that you enter. The discount rate is the return you 
demand in return for investing your money in the company. If you enter a dis-
count rate of 10 percent, you get a wildly different answer than if you enter 

306

12 or 8 percent. And good luck determining what a company’s growth rate 
will be. Still, it’s a useful tool to get a general understanding about a fair value 
for a stock.
The value hunter’s favorite weapon: The 
discounted cash flow analysis
Ask someone who the best investor ever is, and you’ll probably hear the 
name Warren Buffett. Buffett doesn’t publish a playbook that tells the world 
how he picks companies. He offers some pretty good clues, though, through 
his Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports. In a nutshell, Buffett tries to mea-
sure a company’s intrinsic value and buys shares of the company only when 
it’s trading for less than the intrinsic value.
Many speculate that Buffett and investors like him use what’s called the dis-
counted cash flow (DCF) analysis. The DCF method works on the assumption 
that successful companies generate cash flow every year and will hopefully 
generate more each year. The DCF model attempts to estimate how much 
cash the company will generate over its entire lifetime and tells you how 
much that cash would be worth if you got it today. If the company’s intrinsic 
value is greater than the stock price, the company is a good deal.
It’s time for a concrete example. Imagine that you were a lucky lottery player 
and had just won a million dollars. Say the state said you could either have 
the million now or wait 30 years for it. You wouldn’t even have to think about 
it; you’d take the money now. You didn’t realize it, but you just did a DCF 
analysis in your head. Because money received today is more valuable than 
the same amount received later, you know that a million dollars paid 30 years 
from now is worth less than a million dollars paid today.
The DCF analysis can get somewhat complicated. You must first estimate 
a company’s free cash flow, as I describe in Chapter 11. Next, you have to 
determine how rapidly the company’s free cash flow will grow over the years 
and how much it would be worth if paid to shareholders right now. If you’re 
interested in the nitty‐gritty of this analysis, Incademy Investor Education 
(www.incademy.com/courses/Ten‐great‐investors/‐Warren‐
Buffett/1/1040/10002) offers a helpful and in‐depth description of how 
the DCF model is crunched.
Luckily, you can use online resources and get the benefits of the DCF model 
without actually doing any math. Check out the following helpful sites:

307

 Chapter 13: Evaluating Stocks’ Prospects
✓
✓Trefis (www.trefis.com): If you’ve been eager to start building DCF 
models, but the math and terms turn you off, Trefis is for you. The site 
helps you build a DCF analysis by letting you make assumptions about 
how a company’s products will grow. For instance, if you think sales of 
Microsoft’s Xbox video games will increase, you drag a line on a chart 
and Trefis does all the cash flow analysis to see how higher Xbox sales 
will affect Microsoft’s stock. You can also share your assumptions with 
other users and see what assumptions other users have made.
✓
✓MoneyChimp (www.moneychimp.com/articles/valuation/dcf.
htm): This is definitely one of the easier DCF model sites to use. You 
need to enter only five pieces of information and the website generates 
the stock’s value. You must enter the following data:
•	Earnings per share over the past 12 months: You can also use the 
company’s cash flow per share, which is probably more accurate.
•	Initial expected annual growth rate
•	Number of years earnings will grow at that pace
•	What the growth rate will fall to after the initial growth period
•	The return you can get on a similar investment: If the stock is a large‐
company stock, you would enter the 10.3 percent average return of 
the S&P 500 here.
MoneyChimp does all the math for you and tells you how much the 
stock is worth. If you’re interested in the approach Buffett uses, 
MoneyChimp also provides a slightly different DCF model believed  
to be more similar to Buffett’s approach at www.moneychimp.com/ 
articles/valuation/buffett_calc.htm.

✓Numeraire DCF Valuator (http://numeraire.com/value_wizard): 
Here you find a page from the Global Value Investing site that offers all 
sorts of free valuation calculators. Read the Intro text and then click the 
Portal link to find the model that fits your needs.
✓
✓Expectations Investing (www.expectationsinvesting.com): This 
site takes the DCF analysis and turns it on its head. The site owners, 
Alfred Rappaport, a professor emeritus at Northwestern University, and 
Legg Mason Capital money manager Michael Mauboussin, say investors 
should examine a stock’s price first and then work backward. By dissect-
ing the stock price, you can figure out what the majority of other inves-
tors expect the company’s cash flow and growth to be. Then you can 
decide whether the market is expecting too much or too little. You can 
read about the approach in the tutorials section and also download all 
the spreadsheets you need to do the analysis yourself.

✓Damodaran Online (http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar): 
In addition to spreadsheets to help you build dividend discount models 
(described previously), this site also offers dozens of advanced valua-
tion models that use variations of the DCF model. The site even has a 
“right model” spreadsheet that tells you which valuation model to use.
✓
✓NewConstructs (www.newconstructs.com): This site uses a sophis-
ticated DCF model that does everything for you. It enters all the data 
from its database, adjusts the company’s financial statements to the 
appropriate format, and crunches all the math. That’s the good part. The 
bad part is that full access to the system is expensive: $249 a month. 
NewConstructs, however, provides some of its research reports for free 
if you register. There’s also a less costly $49‐a‐month plan that gives you 
access to some of the site’s screening tools.

O
 
ne of the most popular questions investors ask is, “What stock should 
I buy?” These investors figure that, amid the pile of thousands of pub-
licly traded stocks, a handful of stocks will be the big winners for the year. 
They’re right. There will be stocks that are big winners and big losers each 
year. The problem, though, is that no one knows ahead of time which ones.
No online tool can tell you what stocks will be next year’s winners. But some 
online resources and databases can help you find stocks with traits you 
believe make them likely candidates.
This chapter shows you how online screening tools are your best friend when 
you’re trying to sort through thousands of stocks for those you might want 
to own. Online screening tools scour Wall Street for stocks that meet criteria 
you set. I show you a few of the top online stock‐screening tools and give you 
some pointers on how to use them. You also find out about many ways you 
can filter stocks and how to pick criteria for your screen. I also cover meth-
ods to compare companies with their peers or other companies.

Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Getting Familiar with Stock Screens
No one person can do in‐depth analysis of the thousands of publicly traded 
stocks out there. There’s just not enough time. Even large Wall Street invest-
ment companies, with giant teams of researchers, can only study so many 
stocks. But that doesn’t mean you want to miss out on stocks that might 
belong in your portfolio.
Stock‐screening tools are the answer. Online screening tools are systems that 
let you describe what kind of stock you’re looking for, and then the screen-
ing tool returns a list of results to you. The screening tool searches through 
thousands of stocks in a database and finds the ones that match your 
parameters.
Stock‐screening tools aren’t all that different from online dating services. Say 
you’re looking for a mate with dark brown hair and brown eyes who likes to 
run and follow the stock market. You can enter those traits into an online 
dating service and get a list of people who match. Similarly, stock screens 
are excellent tools to help you come up with a list of stocks that might be 
attractive. You enter a list of traits for the stock, such as the industry, growth 
rate, and valuation. After you get a list of the companies that fit your crite-
ria, you have a smaller and more manageable list of stocks you can study 
more closely.
Investors who use online stock‐screening tools benefit in three key ways:
✓
✓Less time wasted: Screening tools keep you from wasting time studying 
companies that aren’t appropriate. You can design your stock screen to 
throw out companies that are undesirable to you for certain reasons, 
such as having too much debt or too little profit.
✓
✓No stone unturned: Screening tools can highlight stocks you might have 
overlooked. One of the best things about stock screens is that they’re 
dispassionate and robotic. Screens don’t get caught up in marketing 
hype — they look only at the numbers. That means screens might 
find stocks you’ve overlooked because you weren’t familiar with the 
­companies’ products.
✓
✓Great head‐to‐head comparisons: Screening tools are great when it 
comes to comparing stocks. Stock screens are built using specific 
financial metrics and ratios, which are calculated for all stocks. Online 
screening tools allow you to rank companies against each other based 
on these objective measures.

 Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens
The biggest gripe about stock screens is that they do only what they’re told. 
If you filter stocks using meaningless variables, your results are only as good 
as the elements you’re searching for.
How you can create an online screen
You find many stock‐screening sites, and they all work slightly differently. 
But the general procedure of getting into the screening game is essen-
tially the same:
1.	Choose a screening site.
Later in this chapter, I discuss several websites that provide free or low‐
cost screening tools.
2.	Decide what kind of stock you’re looking for.
Perhaps you’re trying to find a stock that fits your asset allocation. Are 
you looking for a company that’s being ignored by other investors and 
should therefore be considered value‐priced? Are you trying to find a 
fast‐growing company that will blow away earnings forecasts? Are you 
looking for a stable stock that pays a large dividend? You can find all 
these types of stocks by using screens.
3.	Pick measurable traits shared by stocks and companies you’re 
looking for.
I show you general traits that you can include in your search, as well as 
premade screens where professionals have already created the search 
criteria so that you don’t have to spend your time doing it.
4.	Refine your screen.
Screening for stocks is a bit of a trial‐and‐error process. At first, the 
list of companies that meet your standards might be too large. You 
can make the criteria more stringent or add additional criteria to help 
narrow the list even more.
Now that you understand how the screening process works, the fun part 
begins. The best screens are carefully designed to pinpoint stocks that have 
the traits you’re looking for. When building screens, it’s best to be as specific 
as possible so that you find stocks that are the perfect matches for your 
portfolio.

312
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
General characteristics you  
can use to screen stocks
The number of characteristics you can use to screen stocks is virtually unlim-
ited. If you can measure it, you can screen stocks for it. Even so, most inves-
tors use the following primary measures in screens:
✓
✓Company information: I’m talking basic elements of companies’ loca-
tion, size, or industry here. Common criteria you might use would 
include the number of employees, the stock market exchange the stock 
trades on, the industry the company is in, and what stock market index 
the company is part of. How much money the company brings in — its 
revenue, in other words — is also important.
✓
✓Trading characteristics: This category deals with how the stock has 
been moving. You can search for stocks that tend to swing more or less 
than the general stock market, stocks that are close to their high or low 
during the past year, and stocks that trade hands between investors 
more often or less often. You can also find companies that investors are 
betting against by shorting the stock. (For more on shorting stock, see 
Chapter 5.)
✓
✓Market value: This measures how much the company is worth. 
Market value is used to determine whether a company is small, mid‐
sized, or large.
✓
✓Profitability: The level of earnings and cash flow a company generates is 
of utmost importance to investors. Not surprisingly, you can search on 
both earnings and cash flow. You can drill down even further by looking 
for specific things about profits, including how quickly profit has grown 
over the most recent quarter, year, or over the longer term.
✓
✓Analyst ratings: Analysts often evaluate stocks and rate them as a buy, 
hold, or sell. You can set up your screen so that it finds stocks with a 
certain rating. Analysts’ ratings are covered in more detail in Chapter 15.
✓
✓Valuation ratios: Investors pay close attention to how much they’re 
paying for companies, or what’s called a stock valuation. Valuations are 
covered at length in Chapter 12.
✓
✓Dividends: These periodic cash payments made by companies to 
shareholders are important because they account for about a third of 
many large companies’ total return. Dividends are also widely watched 
because they’re an indication of a stock’s valuation.
Many stock screens use the cryptic terms TTM and MRQ to describe the time 
frame in which you’d like to base your search. TTM means trailing 12 months, 
which means the most recent 12 months. MRQ is the most recent quarter.

313

 Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens
Choosing an online screening site
Before you can start screening, you need to pick an online screening site. 
Over the past years, several of the top screening sites have scaled back 
their free offerings or eliminated them. Even so, many investors will be more 
than satisfied with the remaining free screening sites that are still available, 
and I focus mostly on those sites. The vast majority of these sites provide 
premade screens that you can call up immediately, without programming in 
specific criteria. If using premade screens seems like your speed, I provide 
more details on how to do that with some of the screening sites in the ­section 
“Getting Started with Premade ‘Canned’ Screens,” later in this chapter. You 
might decide, though, that you want to go off the beaten path a bit and 
build a screen exactly to your taste. I show you how to design a screen from 
scratch using a few of the sites as examples in the section “Designing Your 
Own Custom Screens,” later in this chapter.
No matter whether you decide to go with canned or custom screens, the 
screening sites you choose are very important. For online investors, the 
first place to check is your online broker’s website. Many of the leading 
online brokers, especially those I refer to as discounters in Chapter 4, offer 
high‐­quality stock‐screening tools on their websites. Charles Schwab’s stock 
screener lets you screen for many standard criteria, but it makes things a 
little easier by letting you click preset ranges. It also lets you find stocks that 
rank high or low with the Schwab Equity Ratings, discussed more fully in 
Chapter 15. TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and several others provide screening 
tools as well. You need to have an account with the online broker, though, to 
use the full versions of most brokers’ stock screeners, although some allow 
non‐customers to use a stripped‐down version.
After you check out what your online brokerage has to offer, you might also 
consider the following (but in no particular order):
✓
✓Reuters Stock Screener (http://stockscreener.us.reuters.
com/Stock/US/Index?quickscreen=gaarp): This stock screener 
puts part of Reuters’ powerful corporate information database into the 
hands of individual investors. The screening tool allows you to narrow 
down the universe of stocks based on companies’ five‐year growth rates, 
­geographic region and sector.
✓
✓MSN Money’s Stock Screener (www.msn.com/en‐us/money/ 
stockscreener): MSN Money’s Stock Screener feature is a slightly  
different take on stock screening. It attempts to hide the complexity  
by showing only the criteria you select. To get started, just click  
the + sign next to the Filters label. With this online tool, you place 
check marks in a series of boxes with characteristics that matter 
most to you, including a high grade for fundamentals, valuations, or 
dividends. The screener then looks at its database and shows you 
the stocks that make the cut.

314
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
✓
✓Zacks Investment Research’s Screening tool (www.zacks.com/
screening/stock‐screener): The Zacks tool is one of the most pow-
erful free screeners left. It contains more criteria than what’s offered by 
most of the financial sites. Zacks’ tool, shown in Figure 14‐1, lets you 
filter stocks using the standard criteria but adds some unique things, 
too. For instance, you can filter stocks based on estimate uncertainty, 
which finds stocks where analysts strongly disagree over how much 
the company will earn in the next quarter. You can also find compa-
nies that have surprised Wall Street the most with earnings over the 
past quarters.
✓
✓Finviz.com (www.finviz.com/screener.ashx): This is another one 
of the last remaining screeners that offer in‐depth power for investors. 
Finviz’ screener tries to give investors access to the critical criteria they 
need, but at the same time still keeps things simple. Unlike many other 
screeners that are sacrificing power for simplicity, Finviz still gives users 
a fair amount of control in building screens.
✓
✓Google Finance (www.google.com/finance): Google Finance’s 
screener might be missing some of the power offered by Zacks and 
Finviz. It is worth checking out, though, due to its interesting way of pre-
senting the data. Google Finance’s screener uses charts to show you how

✓Kapitall (www.kapitall.com): Screening for stocks might not sound 
like your idea of something fun to do on a Saturday night, but Kapitall 
is trying to change that. The site lets you prospect for stocks using a 
fun, colorful interface that looks more like a video game than a stock‐
screening tool. If you click the large round button at the lower left‐hand 
corner of the screen and then choose screener, you launch the site’s 
Super Screener, which steps you through the process of screening for 
stocks. It’s kind of fun. Seriously. You just need to register first in order 
to use the site.
✓
✓Morningstar’s Stock Screener (screen.morningstar.com/
StockSelector.html): The Morningstar offering in the Stock Screener 
sweepstakes is designed to make it easier for beginning investors to 
design sophisticated screens. Rather than requiring you to pick through 
dozens of criteria you might not understand, you can just pick a growth 
grade, profitability grade, or financial health grade, based on a scale 
from A to F. After you’re done, click the Show/Score Results tab, and 
you see all the stocks that made the cut. You’ll need to sign up as a free 
member of Morningstar to use the stock screener.
✓
✓Portfolio123 (www.portfolio123.com): This site provides a number 
of premade screens that can help you find stocks with ­improving 
earnings or that are industry leaders. The site has a 15‐day free 
trial; however, you need to pay a $29 monthly fee to use many of the 
site’s features.
If you’re interested in stock screening, most online brokers’ sites offer 
a tour or tutorial of the tools they can provide. If screens are important 
to you, you might consider checking out the tools on various online 
brokers’ sites to see whether they’re good enough for you to open an 
account.
Knowing What You’re Looking For: 
Popular Screening Variables
Investors can search for countless criteria by using screens, but I’ve noticed 
that certain variables routinely show up in stock screens because they’re so 
useful. If you know what these variables are and why they matter, you can 
build some very helpful screens.

316
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
The basics: ’Cause you have  
to start somewhere
When you’re first figuring out how to build screens, you want to start with 
some of the more basic variables. That way, you can get comfortable with the 
idea of building screens first and then add more advanced variables as you 
narrow your search. In this Basics category, I’d include the following:
✓
✓Valuation ratios: These ratios include the price‐to‐earnings (P/E) ratio 
and the price–to–book value ratio. Valuation ratios are ways to compare 
a stock price with the company’s value. If you’re looking for potentially 
undervalued stocks, for instance, search for stocks with low P/E and 
price–to–book value ratios.
The P/E ratio and other valuation ratios are discussed at length in 
Chapter 13.
✓
✓Shares outstanding: A company’s shares outstanding measures the total 
number of shares in the hands of investors. It’s related to a company’s 
float, which is the number of shares that are available to be bought 
and sold by the public. When companies buy back their stock, shares 
are removed from the shares outstanding and float, and they sit on the 
sidelines. Those sidelined shares are called treasury stock and aren’t 
included in shares outstanding.
✓
✓Market value: This is a measure of the price tag the stock market puts 
on the whole company. The market value — usually called the market 
capitalization or market cap — is measured by multiplying the stock 
price by its number of shares outstanding. This measure determines 
whether a stock is large, mid‐sized, or small.
✓
✓Earnings per share (EPS): Earnings per share is the bottom line. It mea-
sures what portion of the company net income holders of each share of 
stock are entitled to. Investors generally use diluted EPS in screens. (The 
diluted EPS figure is a way to measure a company’s bottom line that fac-
tors in the effect of companies issuing large amounts of stock options to 
employees.)
✓
✓Current ratio: Measures how prepared a company is to pay bills that are 
due in a year’s time. You can calculate the current ratio by dividing cur-
rent assets (assets that can be turned into cash in a year or less) by cur-
rent liabilities (bills due in a year or less). If the company’s current ratio 
is 1, the company has enough assets to cover bills coming due in a year. 
The higher the ratio, the more solid the company’s financial condition is.
✓
✓Revenue per employee: Shows you how efficiently the company uses 
its workforce. The ratio is the company’s revenue divided by its number 
of employees. The higher the number, the more revenue the company 
derives from each employee.

Getting more particular: More advanced 
variables to screen for
Just using the basic screening variables is somewhat limiting. If you want to 
carve the list of stock candidates further, you can use some more advanced 
variables. Good choices here include the following:
✓
✓Gross margin: One of many ways to measure a company’s profitabil-
ity, gross profit is how much revenue a company keeps after paying 
for things directly involved in the production of the good or service 
sold. A lemonade stand’s gross profit is the dollar value of the lemon-
ade sold minus the cost of things used in the lemonade, such as sugar 
and lemons. This gross profit divided by the company’s revenue gives 
you gross margin. Gross margin tells you how much of every dollar in 
sales the company keeps after paying costs directly tied to making the 
good or service. The higher the gross margin, the more profitable the 
company is.
✓
✓Operating margin: This method of measuring a company’s profit 
includes more costs than gross margin. Operating profit is gross profit 
minus indirect costs, such as overhead. Overhead might include the cost 
of hiring a company to promote the business. Operating margin is the 
company’s operating profit divided by revenue. The higher the operating 
margin, the more profitable the company.
✓
✓Net profit margin: This particular margin compares the company’s 
bottom line with its revenue. Net profit is measured by dividing a com-
pany’s net income, which counts all company costs, by its revenue. It 
tells you how much of each dollar in revenue the company keeps as 
profit after paying all costs. The higher the net profit margin, the more 
profitable the company.
✓
✓Return on equity: A great way to see how efficiently the company’s man-
agement is using the money invested in the company, return on equity 
(ROE) is measured by dividing net income by shareholder’s equity. 
Shareholder’s equity measures how much money shareholders have 
invested in the company. So, ROE shows you how much profit the com-
pany generates per dollar invested in the company.
✓
✓Return on assets: Shows you how much profit the company is able to 
squeeze out of its assets. The higher the number, the better the com-
pany is at making money from things it owns.
✓
✓Dividend payout ratio: Tells you what portion of profit a company is 
paying out as dividends. You calculate this ratio by dividing a company’s 
dividends by net income.

318
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
If a company’s dividend payout ratio gets high — paying 85 percent or 
more of its profit out as earnings, for example — it might be paying more 
than it can afford, depending on what industry it is in.
✓
✓Dividend yield: Tells you what kind of return you’re getting as a divi-
dend from the money you’ve invested in a stock. The dividend yield is a 
company’s annual dividend paid per share divided by the stock price. A 
$10 stock that pays $2 a year in dividends has a 2 percent dividend yield.
✓
✓Institutional ownership: This measure tries to show you whether the 
“smart money” is buying a stock. The ratio shows you what percent-
age of shares are in the hands of large mutual funds and pension funds, 
which presumably have large research units. Some investors look for 
stocks with low institutional ownership, figuring the stock will rise rap-
idly as these big investors discover the stock and buy shares.
✓
✓Debt‐to‐equity ratio: Shows you how deeply in debt a company is. The 
ratio divides a company’s liabilities by its shareholder equity. The higher 
the ratio, the more leveraged, or in debt, the company is. Remember, 
though, that different levels of debt are acceptable in various industries.
✓
✓Beta: Most online screening tools use a measure called beta to gauge vol-
atility. The higher beta is, the more volatile the stock is compared to the 
rest of the stock market. If a stock has a beta greater than 1, that means 
it’s more volatile than the Standard & Poor’s 500. If a stock’s beta is less 
than 1, it’s less volatile than the S&P 500. And if a stock’s beta is equal to 
1, it’s equally as volatile as the S&P 500.
If you can’t stomach stocks that swing as wildly as the stock market, you 
want to add a beta filter to your screens. Just look for stocks that have 
betas of less than 1.
✓
✓Short interest: Short interest measures how many investors are betting 
a stock will fall. The measure is calculated by dividing the number of 
shares being shorted — or being sold in a complex maneuver by inves-
tors betting that the stock price will fall — by the number of shares 
that normally trade each day, or the average daily volume. (For more on 
shorting stock, see Chapter 5.)
Finding stocks using trading‐pattern  
variables
Some investors are interested more in a company’s stock than the company. 
These investors, generally known as technical analysts, believe stocks follow 
certain patterns. And if you detect the pattern fast enough, you can figure 
out where the stock is going and make money. Some screening variables are 
designed to find technical stock patterns, including

319

 Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens
✓
✓Average daily volume: Some investors think if there’s heavy trading in 
a stock when it rises or falls, that means more than if there’s light trad-
ing volume. If a stock goes up, these investors look at trading volume to 
find out how many investors are buying. If the stock is rising and trading 
activity is strong, that tells these investors there’s great demand for the 
stock and the uptrend might continue.
✓
✓Proximity to moving averages: This indicator tells you whether the cur-
rent stock price is higher or lower than where it has been in the past. 
The 200‐day moving average, for instance, tells you what the stock’s 
average price has been over the course of the past trading year. If the 
stock falls below the 200‐day moving average, some see that as a bad 
sign because it means everyone who bought the stock in the past year, 
on average, is losing money and might be eager to sell.
✓
✓Proximity to a stock’s price highs and lows: You can use screens to find 
out whether a stock’s price is close to its high price over the past year, 
called the 52‐week high, or its low price, the 52‐week low.
✓
✓Stock performance: This is a simple measure that shows you how much 
the stock has risen or fallen in a set period of time.
Getting Started with Premade  
“Canned” Screens
If you’ve never built a stock screen before, you might want to first try out 
some of the premade screens available on various websites. The websites 
have done most of the work for you and entered all the variables, saving you 
the hassle. The following list highlights some of the better‐known “canned” 
stock screens:
✓
✓Quicken’s One‐Click Scorecard (investing.quicken.com/
research): This Quicken tool takes a novel approach toward screening. 
You can find it by clicking the One‐Click Scorecard tab at the top of the 
screen — after logging in (it’s free to register). The site screens stocks 
for those that meet the criteria described by money manager Robert 
Hagstrom, author of The Warren Buffett Way. The One‐Click Scorecard 
seeks stocks with traits that Hagstrom says Buffett looks for, including 
a high return on equity, high net profit margin, and most importantly, 
a stock price that’s lower than the company’s intrinsic value — its true 
worth based on how much it’s expected to earn in the future.
You must own a copy of Quicken that’s three years old or less to access 
Quicken’s website. Just click the One‐Click Scorecard link at the top of 
the page under the Quotes & Research tab to access the system.

320
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Just because a stock scores high in the Robert Hagstrom screen in the 
One‐Click Scorecard doesn’t mean that Buffett bought the stock or wants 
to buy it. The screen merely tells you what stocks have traits that match 
what Buffett looks for.
✓
✓NASDAQ’s Guru Stock Screener (www.nasdaq.com/investing/
guru/guru‐stock‐screener.aspx): This particular NASDAQ canned 
stock screener uses preset criteria to help you determine whether one of 
several famous investors would buy a stock that you’re interested in. On 
the page that appears, you can type the company’s symbol and the tool 
tells you whether famous former Fidelity portfolio manager Peter Lynch, 
value investor Benjamin Graham, contrarian investor David Dreman, or 
growth investor Martin Zweig would be interested in the stock. You can 
also use the “Find Stock Based on Guru Interest” option to automatically 
screen for stocks these gurus might be interested in.
✓
✓Zacks Predefined Screener (www.zacks.com/screening/stock‐
screener): Zacks’ entry in the predefined screener market offers 
screens that focus on the key factors you’d expect, such as value and 
earnings growth. But Zacks’ “predefined” screens also offer several cri-
teria that highlight stocks on the move and those that enjoy the most 
positive or negative changes in analysts’ recommendations. Access the 
predefined screens by clicking the Predefined tab.
You can run basic pre‐made screens for free, but to do fancy things like 
narrow all the screens to include small, mid‐sized, or large stocks, you’ll 
need to pay. Advanced screens are part of the Zacks Premium member-
ship, which costs $249 a year.
✓
✓Morningstar’s Stock Screener (http://screen.morningstar.
com/mstarScreens/chooseStockScreen.html): Actually, stock 
screeners, because Morningstar offers a number of helpful screeners 
Want to find out what stocks Buffett owns?
The One‐Click Scorecard helps you screen for 
stocks with some of the traits Buffett (Warren, 
not Jimmy) looks for in winning investments. 
But what if you want to find out what Buffett’s 
Berkshire Hathaway actually owns?
You can find out using online tools. You can 
download Berkshire Hathaway’s annual 
reports (www.berkshirehathaway.
com/reports.html), which list the 
company’s stock investments. You can view 
Berkshire’s investments at the end of 2014 in 
the 2014 annual report (www.berkshire 
hathaway.com/2014ar/2014ar.
pdf). (Hmmm . . . Looks like he had a thing for 
International Business Machines, Wells Fargo, 
Coca‐Cola, and American Express.)

 Chapter 14: Finding Investment Ideas with Online Stock Screens
with catchy and self‐explanatory titles. A few of the screeners include 
Low‐Priced Growth Stocks, Profitable but Unloved, Bargain‐Basement 
Small Caps, Aggressive Growth, Blue‐Blood Blue Chips, and Classic 
Appeal. You can also access some of these screeners by clicking the 
Stocks tab at Morningstar’s home page and scrolling down the new page 
that appears.
✓
✓MSN Money (msn.com/en‐us/money/stockscreener): MSN Money 
tries to get down to business and just heads straight to what many 
investors want to know: What are some top stocks. MSN Money shows 
a Popular Screens banner at the top of the page. You can choose 
from canned screens to find high dividend yields, bargain stocks, or 
tech giants.
Most of the online screening tools in this section let you customize canned 
screens. Tweaking an existing screen can be a good way to get started 
because you don’t have to start from scratch. Instead, you can modify the 
variables to your tastes.
Designing Your Own Custom Screens
After you start dabbling with stock screens, you’ll probably start enjoying it. 
You can get a rush sifting through thousands of stocks for precise variables 
and get a list of candidates in a matter of seconds. Many investors, when 
they realize what stock screening is and how easy it is to do, can get kind 
of addicted to building screens. Screening really shows the power of online 
investing.
The premade screens described in the preceding section cover most of the 
main searches investors would want to do. But sometimes, a canned screen 
isn’t good enough. Many of the same sites that offer canned screens also let 
you create a screen from scratch. You might consider building a screen from 
the ground up if you encounter the following issues with a premade screen:
✓
✓The screen is too strict. A premade screen might be so restrictive that 
you might miss out on stocks that just barely missed the cut. That’s 
especially true when searching for value‐priced stocks because inves-
tors’ opinions on what makes a cheap stock vary. A canned screen 
might consider a P/E ratio of 8 to be cheap, but you might overlook 
some stocks with P/E ratios of 8.5 or 9. Stocks with P/E ratios of less 
than 10 might be considered to be bargains, but not cheap enough for 
the screen.

322
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
✓
✓The screen is too lenient. A premade screen might not be as restrictive 
as you’d like. If you’re looking for a company that’s expanding very rap-
idly, you might want to ratchet up what it takes to get into your screen. 
Many screens consider 20 percent annual earnings growth to be rapid, 
but you might want 30 percent or more.
✓
✓The screen is not to your taste. Some investors go after stocks that defy 
characterization. You might want to find stocks with high P/E ratios and 
low price–to–book value ratios, which are unusual things to look for at 
the same time. You need to build these personalized screens yourself.
Finding different industries’ best  
companies using Google Finance
If you’re trying to figure out which companies in an industry are performing 
the best or worst, several of the sites mentioned previously can do the trick. 
Just for an illustration, I show you how using Google Finance’s screening tool 
makes it easy:
1.	Point your browser to Google Finance’s screening tool at www.
google.com/finance/stockscreener.
2.	From the Sector drop‐down list, choose the industry you’re interested in.
3.	Increase your screening universe to define what you mean by a “best 
company.”
The definition of a “best company” is in the eyes of the beholder. You 
might, for instance, want companies with a return on equity that’s higher 
than the industry’s. To find companies with an industry‐beating return 
on equity, you’d first click the plus sign to the left of the Add Criteria 
link. Next, click the Operating Metrics link, select Return on Equity (5 yr 
avg) (%) to screen on the five‐year average, and click the Add Criteria 
button. Finally, move the slider bar on the left side of the Return on 
Equity (5 yr avg) line so that you’re capturing only the companies with 
the best results. Your screen should look something like Figure 14‐2.
4.	Add more variables.
You can keep working your way down, adding different criteria if you 
choose. Just by clicking the Add Criteria link, you can choose stocks 
that miss, match, or exceed industry averages on a variety of things, 
including price–to–book value ratio, price‐to‐earnings ratio, debt loads, 
and many other items.

Finding value or growth companies using 
Morningstar’s Stock Screener
You could go to the trouble of designing a convoluted set of criteria to find 
value and growth stocks. But why go to the trouble when Morningstar’s Stock 
Screener has done the work for you? Morningstar’s Stock Screener helps you 
design a custom screen, but with some helpful handholding. Here’s how:
1.	Point your browser to Morningstar’s screening tool at http://
screen.morningstar.com/StockSelector.html?ssection= 
StockScreener. You’ll need to sign up for the free version of 
Morningstar before you can access this tool.
The Stock Screener page appears in all its glory.
2.	Choose the Growth or Value criteria you want from the Morningstar 
equity style box drop‐down list.
You could go for Large Value, for example. That’s the second item on the 
drop‐down list from the top.

3.	Limit your search further if you want.
You can narrow your search further, based on growth or profitability 
grades and other items.

screener.
You get a lovely list of results.

hen you’re looking to make a big purchase, such as a car, house, 
or big‐screen TV, you probably ask other people questions before 
making your decision. You might ask a friend or family member for his rec-
ommendation or consult with a magazine or website that ranks products.
Recommendations play an important role for some investors when picking 
stocks, too. Traditional brokers have long made it their business to recom-
mend stocks for their clients to buy. And even before the hot dogs hit the 
grill, many family barbeques start sounding like an investment club meeting 
as everyone brags about his winners (and somehow fails to mention stocks 
he’s lost money on). Many financial TV shows feature guests who can fire off 
stock tips.
Stock recommendations are impossible to avoid, so it’s up to you to keep 
their value in perspective. There are smart ways to handle recommendations. 
In this chapter, I show you various online resources for stock recommenda-
tions, as well as how to interpret them. You get a chance to read about dif-
ferent stock‐picking newsletters and sites and how to evaluate them. And I 
show you some new online sites that reveal how other individual investors 
rate stocks.

Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Picking Apart Professional  
Analyst Reports
Nearly all the major Wall Street brokerage firms have teams of research  
sell‐side analysts. It’s the sell‐side analyst’s job to study companies and tell 
investors who are clients of the brokerage firm which stocks are ­attractive. 
You can also find independent research firms — research groups not 
­connected with a brokerage firm that analyze stocks and sell their research.
Blindly following “buy” or “sell” recommendations is generally a bad idea. 
Smart investors know how to scan through research reports to pick out 
important insights on the company or industry. Later in this chapter,  
I show you how to quickly pull the most important information out of 
­analyst reports.
How to access analyst reports online
Before you can analyze research reports, you have to get your hands on 
them. Several techniques are available to do this online — some cost you 
money, but many don’t. The following list highlights a few resources of both 
the free and not‐so‐free types:
✓
✓Online brokers: You don’t have to be a client of the full‐service bro-
kerage firms like Credit Suisse or Goldman Sachs to get their analysts’ 
research reports. Online brokers can sometimes get the goods for you. 
Charles Schwab, for instance, allows you to download reports from 
Credit Suisse, and Fidelity offers access to Barclays Capital’s reports. 
E*TRADE provides Credit Suisse’s research to customers with more than 
$100,000 in assets. Most online brokers also offer access to independent 
research, including reports from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, Argus, 
Thomson Reuters, and Morningstar. Getting research from your online 
broker is generally the best route because there’s usually no charge.
✓
✓Research providers: Some independent research providers sell their 
reports directly to investors. Standard & Poor’s, for instance, sells 
reports on more than 5,000 companies. (See www.alacrastore.
com/research/s‐and‐p‐stock‐reports for a listing.) The reports 
include a forecast of what the stock’s future price could be, called a 
target price, in addition to an analysis of the company’s earnings. The 
reports often cost around $50.
S&P reports also use an easy‐to‐understand rating system. S&P rates 
thousands of stocks using a star rating system where the most attractive 

327

 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers
stocks are given five stars and the least attractive stocks get one star. If 
your broker offers S&P reports, you can get the S&P ratings from the top 
of the reports.
Don’t assume that just because stock research comes from an indepen-
dent research firm, it’s more accurate or better than research from large 
Wall Street firms. Sometimes research from Wall Street brokerage firms is 
very good. The quality of research varies greatly and largely depends on 
the strength of the specific analyst covering the stock. I show you how 
to track down the best analysts on various stocks in the next section of 
this chapter.
✓
✓Research resellers: You can buy research reports from Reuters (www.
reuters.com/finance/stocks) by entering the stock’s symbol into 
the Search Stocks field, clicking the search button and then clicking on 
the name of the company. Once the page loads, click on the Research 
tab. Prices range from just $15 to hundreds of dollars.
✓
✓Summary sites: If you want just the bottom‐line recommendations from 
analysts, several sites summarize the data. Nearly all the websites that 
provide stock quotes also compile analyst recommendations. Some 
examples include
•	Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) has a comprehen-
sive database of analyst recommendations. Enter a stock symbol 
into the search field at the top of Yahoo! Finance, click the name of 
the company when it pops up, and then click the Analyst Opinion 
link on the left side of the new page that appears. You see how 
analysts, on average, are rating the stock and also the stock’s aver-
age price target — what analysts, on average, expect the stock’s 
price to be in a year or less. You can find out from Yahoo! Finance 
whether analysts raised their opinion on a stock, called upgrading, 
or cut their opinion, called downgrading.
•	Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks) provides analyst 
recommendations if you enter a stock symbol, click Search, and 
then click the name of the company. Click the Analysts tab and 
you’ll find analysts’ recommendations and how they’ve changed 
over the past month, two months, and three months.
•	Zacks Investment Research (www.zacks.com) provides brokerage 
recommendations if you know where to look for them. Just enter 
a stock’s symbol into the Quote text field, click the name of the 
company, scroll down, and click the Brokerage Recommendations 
link on the left‐hand side of the screen. Pay close attention to the 
average brokerage recommendation (ABR), a number that falls 
somewhere between 1 and 5. If the ABR is 1, that means analysts, 
on average, rank the stock a strong buy. If the ABR is 5, analysts, 

328
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
on average, rank the stock a strong sell. Zacks also ranks stock  
ratings by industry.
•	NASDAQ.com (www.nasdaq.com) offers a handy guide to 
upgrades and downgrades for all stocks, not just those that 
trade on the NASDAQ. Scroll down quite a way to find the 
Recommendations section, where you can see how many stocks 
were upgraded or downgraded that day.
Most summary sites convert stock ratings into numbers on a one‐to‐five 
scale, where 1 is a “strong buy” or “outperform” and 5 is a “strong sell” or 
“underperform.”
When “hold” really means “sell”
Research reports issued by Wall Street invest-
ment banks got a bad rap in the early 2000s — 
one they haven’t completely lived down even 
to this day. That’s when the former New York 
attorney general Eliot Spitzer began investi-
gating a number of internal emails sent within 
several large Wall Street brokerage firms, and 
shook up the industry in ways still being felt 
more than a decade later. The emails alleg-
edly indicated that sell‐side analysts routinely 
issued glowing “strong buy” and “buy” ratings 
on stocks they had serious reservations about. 
During the Internet boom, for instance, for every 
stock with a sell rating, there were 100 stocks 
with a buy rating, according to the University 
of Pennsylvania. Those ratings proved to be 
overly optimistic in many cases, and some 
investors who followed the research suffered 
large losses as a result. The regulators alleged 
analysts promoted stocks of companies the 
brokerage firms hoped to sell lucrative invest-
ment banking services to. The analysts, in turn, 
would receive bonuses resulting from the busi-
ness that came from the companies they wrote 
positively about. The investigations resulted in 
dramatic reforms in the way investment banks 
handle stock research.
In 2003, ten investment banking firms agreed 
to a settlement with regulators in which 
they would pay roughly $1.4 billion in various 
penalties and fees in connection to issuing 
allegedly misleading research reports. (See 
the SEC page at www.sec.gov/news/
press/2003‐54.htm for more about the 
landmark case.)
Spitzer ran into legal troubles himself — 
­allegations of misconduct led him to resign 
as governor of New York in 2008. But the 
­settlement he helped strike with investment 
banks resulted in several changes to research 
that affect online investors. One of the signifi-
cant outcomes of the settlement included the 
requirement that Wall Street investment firms 
make their analysts’ ratings and price targets 
available to the public. By giving investors 
access to analysts’ track records, investors 
gained the ability, thanks to several websites, 
to see which analysts might be worth ­listening 
to and which ones to ignore. Following the 
reforms, perhaps due to the greater account-
ability, analyst ratings improved in accuracy.

Determining which Wall Street analysts 
are worth listening to
Don’t just assume that research from an independent analyst is better than 
research from a sell‐side analyst. What really matters is performance. If an 
analyst is always wrong, independent or not, you probably don’t want to 
listen to his or her advice.
But how do you find out which analysts are the best? These two online tools 
can help you find the best analysts:
✓
✓Investars (www.investars.com): Investars maintains an impressive 
database that shows which research firms and individual analysts are 
the most accurate and looks up ratings based on sectors and individual 
stocks. There used to be a free version of the site, but now access to 
Investars is sold only to professional money management firms. Once 
again, though, your online brokerage is your key. Some brokerages, 
including Fidelity, provide access to Investars data to customers, as you 
can see in Figure 15‐1.
Figure 15-1:

individual 
stocks, 
­analysts, 
and 
research 
firms.

330
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
✓
✓StarMine (www.starmine.com): StarMine lets investors view lists that 
rank the top analysts. But like Investars, StarMine is made directly avail-
able only to money‐management firms. Some brokerages, like Fidelity, 
make StarMine data available to customers. There’s another way you can 
get access to some StarMine data: the company’s awards. StarMine lauds 
the best analysts each year and makes the award announcements, avail-
able for free at www.starmineawards.com. You can find the best over-
all analysts and firms and also find the ones that are the most accurate in 
specific industry sectors, such as financial, industrials, and utilities.
StarMine’s own website is geared for professional money managers and 
Wall Street firms. If you’re not part of that crowd, the easiest way to get 
StarMine and Investars data is through your broker. If these data are 
important to you, you’ll want to ask if they are available when you sign 
up with a broker. This issue is yet another reminder of the types of ser-
vices brokers are adding to their offerings to justify their commissions.
What to look for in an analyst report
Many investors who read Wall Street analyst reports tend to concentrate 
on the analyst’s rating. These investors want to know instantly whether the 
stock is rated a buy, hold, or sell.
Savvy investors often skip past the analyst’s rating on a stock. Much of the 
worthwhile information in an analyst report isn’t in the rating but in the 
insights about the company, management, and industry. Investopedia (www.
investopedia.com/articles/01/013101.asp) provides a useful guide 
in how to read analysts’ research reports.
Pay the most attention to these portions of the report:
✓
✓Industry comparisons: Many Wall Street analysts are assigned to cover 
companies in a specific industry. As a result, these analysts spend time 
going to industry conferences, meeting with employees, customers, and 
suppliers to build deep knowledge of industry trends. Industry information 
is one of the top things you should look for. Pay special attention to any 
signs that one company is taking market share from other competitors.
✓
✓Channel checks: The better industry analysts take the time to see how 
much of the product that companies are shipping is actually making 
it into the hands of customers. The process of tracking the flow of 
goods from the company to warehouses to resellers and retailers and 
ultimately to consumers is called a channel check. If you get the feeling 
the company is shipping product that’s just stacking up on retailers’ 
shelves, that’s a bad sign. A pileup of product might indicate the com-
pany is trying to boost its earnings in the short term and might suffer 
later as the glut of products is sold off.

331

 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers
✓
✓Price‐target justification: Analysts often use a variety of stock valuation 
techniques (explained in more detail in Chapter 13) to put a price target 
on a stock. A price target is the analyst’s best guess at how much the 
stock might be worth in the future, usually one year from now. The most 
interesting part of the price target is often analysts’ explanation of how 
they arrived at the number.

Many analysts put their MBAs to good use and pick apart the financial state-
ments of companies to determine how much the stocks are truly worth. But, 
some analysts take the lazy way out by blindly following the forecast given to 
them by the company. This presents a problem for online investors because 
companies can steer some analysts to lower their expectations for growth. 
And if the company is successful in lowering the earnings bar, it’s easier for 
the company to beat the results. The opposite can happen, too. A company 
might convince analysts to go along with an overly optimistic view of the 
future, setting investors up for a disappointment.
That’s where the earnings whisper number comes in. The whisper number, in 
theory, is the unofficial earnings number most investors honestly expect the 
company to report.
Whisper numbers gain even more prominence during strong bull markets 
when investors’ expectations begin to soar. Whisper numbers were particu-
larly popular during the dot‐com stock boom, which even today, is one of the 
most overinflated markets investors have ever seen.
You can get whisper numbers for free online. WhisperNumber.com (www.
whispernumber.com) is an easy way to see what the whisper number 
might be. Just enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in and click the 
search button, and you can view the whisper number for the current quarter. 
You can also look up the whisper number for the previous quarter and see 
how close it was to the actual number reported by the company. Lastly, you 
can see how the stock reacted in 1, 5, 10, and 30 days by following the com-
pany’s last earnings announcement. The site is free, but you must register.
Estimize.com (www.estimize.com) has another approach to try to get a 
more accurate earnings estimate than the analysts, by measuring the wisdom 
of the crowd. The free site allows members to enter their best guesses at 
what they think companies will earn. Estimize then tallies up the users’ esti-
mates and creates an Estimize estimate. You can use the site for free — both 
to look up estimates from other users as well as enter your own. Estimize 
attracts estimates and participation from big‐time investors, too. The site 
contains a rich amount of data that will help you determine how much a com-
pany is really expected to earn, as shown in Figure 15‐2.

Accessing and understanding  
credit ratings
Research analysts who study companies and their stocks get the most atten-
tion from many investors. But you find a second type of company analysts 
out there — debt‐rating analysts or bond analysts. Debt‐rating analysts study 
companies to determine how creditworthy they are. Debt‐rating analysts are 
important because if they determine that a company is stable and trustwor-
thy, the company can borrow money at lower interest rates. Debt‐rating ana-
lysts give companies letter grades to measure their financial strength, with A 
being high and either C or D being the lowest grade possible.
Multiple Markets (www.multiple‐markets.com/3ratingschart.htm) 
provides a handy definition of the ratings and what they mean. You have to 
scroll down a bit to see the chart with the definitions.
You find three major debt‐rating firms: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch 
Ratings. The ratings used by Moody’s vary slightly from the ratings used by 
the other two firms. The debt‐rating firms employ armies of analysts trained 
to pick apart companies’ financial statements looking for trouble. While they 
miss problems from time to time, including both the Enron debacle and the 
subprime mortgage debt implosion, they’re still a helpful source of informa-
tion for investors.

 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers
Even if you’re buying a company’s stock, not its debt, credit agencies’ ratings 
are very important because they give you an idea of how solid the company’s 
financials are. You find three leading credit agencies, but only the following 
two agencies make their ratings available for free online:
✓
✓Moody’s Investors Service (www.moodys.com): Moody’s provides easy 
online access to its credit ratings. Moody’s site is free, but you must 
register to get any information from it. After signing in, enter the name 
or symbol of the company you want to research in the search box in 
the upper‐left corner of the screen. After you click the Go button, you’ll 
be prompted to log in. Moody’s ratings for the company will pop up 
on a new screen. You might see several ratings for each company, but 
the rating of most importance to investors is the one called Long Term 
Rating. (See Figure 15‐3.)
✓
✓Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com): S&P lets you view 
its credit ratings for the thousands of companies it covers. Enter the 
company’s name or symbol into the Find a Rating box on the left side 
of the page and click the Search button. After the page refreshes, scroll 
down until you see the company’s name. After you click the company’s 
name, you see S&P’s credit rating for the company. The site is free, but 
you have to register to use it.

Connecting with Online Stock Ratings
Wall Street analysts aren’t the only sources for ratings on stocks. You find 
a handful of online stock‐rating services that either let a computer or other 
investors rate a stock. Some of these rating services are based on computer 
models, sometimes called quantitative (or quant) models, which analyze com-
panies’ financial statements and key ratios to decide whether the stock is a 
good buy. Other stock‐rating services allow investors to share their ratings 
on stocks, with the idea that as a whole, the average of the crowd’s opinions 
will be close to accurate. I cover both types of stock‐rating services in the fol-
lowing sections.
Putting quant stock models  
to work for you
Research reports issued by Wall Street analysts and debt‐rating analysts 
can be helpful, but they’re not perfect. These analysts are human, too, and 
often fail to sound the bell before financial catastrophes occur — think the 
collapse of dot‐com stocks, as well as the implosion of Enron and compa-
nies in the subprime mortgage industry. These missteps by human analysts 
have led some investors to think that it would be great if you could get rat-
ings and recommendations on stocks yet somehow eliminate the potential 
of human error or lapses in judgment. That’s where quant models come in. 
These models are programmed by market experts to analyze stocks by using 
a series of criteria and to rate them. Most of these systems are untouched by 
Credit ratings lost credibility
Just as Wall Street stock analysts came 
under fire after the dot‐com bust, credit rating 
­agencies drew negative attention after the 
financial crisis of 2007. Credit rating agen-
cies are supposed to be the watchdog for 
investors, carefully studying the strength of 
debt instruments. However, during the hous-
ing boom of the mid‐2000s the credit rating 
agencies continued to give top credit ratings 
to financially shaky debt instruments tied to 
aggressive ­“subprime” mortgages. Investors 
who bought these instruments, assuming they 
were high quality, were sorely disappointed as 
the ­borrowers defaulted and the value of the 
instruments fell. The rapid decline in value of 
these mortgage debt ­securities stunned the 
financial system and was a big contributor in 
the financial crisis, which ultimately led to the 
failure and massive bailouts of some of the 
nation’s largest financial institutions. Many 
critics of credit rating agencies felt that these 
companies should have alerted investors to the 
dangers of these debt instruments, which could 
have stemmed the financial crisis.

human hands after they’re designed. Instead, they follow very strict preset 
guidelines. A few online quant models include the following:
✓
✓Schwab Equity Ratings (www.schwab.wallst.com/ser/ 
perfMonitor/public/?period=52wk): Schwab ranks thousands 
of stocks (using an A‐through‐F scale) based on companies’ valuations 
plus the risk, valuation, and momentum of their stocks. Even if you’re 
not a Schwab customer, you can get limited access to the Schwab 
Equity Ratings.
For instance, say you’d like to get a list of all the stocks that have been 
rated an A. Start out by making sure that the Performance over Recent 
26‐51 Weeks tab is selected, as shown in Figure 15‐4, and then choose the 
most recent period from the Select Performance Time Period drop‐down 
list. You see a table underneath a few charts. In this table, you can click 
the time period, listed under the Performance for the Period header, 
and get a list of all the stocks that were rated A, and also B through F,  
26 weeks ago.

✓Trefis (www.trefis.com): If you’re looking for a smart algorithm to 
give you a quick rating on a stock, Trefis is a nifty tool. The system, 
which is free to use, studies a companies’ profitability and gives you an 
estimate of what the stock is worth.
Sharing stock ratings with  
other investors online
In his book The Wisdom of Crowds (published by Random House), journalist 
James Surowiecki argues that a crowd of regular people making decisions, on 
average, will get closer to the right answer as a whole than just a few experts. 
Collectively, a group of diverse and independent‐thinking people will, on 
average, come up with an accurate guess.
Several online sites are trying to harness this wisdom of crowds and turn the 
masses’ guess into information you can use to boost your returns. Some good 
sources for this collective intelligence are listed here:
✓
✓The Motley Fool CAPS (http://caps.fool.com): This particular 
corner of the Motley Fool website allows members to enter their ratings 
on thousands of stocks. The ratings are then compiled into a single aver-
age rating that’s available to all users of the website. You can access the 
CAPS database by clicking the CAPS Community tab. A stock with five 
stars is a strong buy, and a stock with a one‐star rating is a strong sell. 
The site is free, but you must register first.
But CAPS gets more interesting the more you dive into the menus. After 
signing in, search for any stock. Scroll down on the stock information 
page until you see the stock chart. Click the On link located below the 
chart, next to where it says CAPS Rating. Now you can see how the CAPS 
rating has changed over the past few months, shown by the gold line on 
the chart. If you scroll down further, you can also read why certain CAPS 
members rated a stock the way they did. And even these blurbs are 
rated by members, so you can read the most highly rated comments on 
a stock. Anyone can view most CAPS ratings and information, but to rate 
stocks yourself, you need to register with the site, which is free.
And what does CAPS stand for? You’re going to be sorry you asked. 
CAPS doesn’t appear to stand for anything, but rather seems to be a 
play on the word cap, because the Motley Fool’s founders are known 
for wearing jester hats. Participants in the CAPS system are assigned 
a color‐coded hat, or cap, icon to signal how good they have been at 
­picking stocks.

✓Stockpickr (www.stockpickr.com): This site allows you to enter your 
portfolio and the system allows you to look at other investors’ portfolios 
to get ideas. Stockpickr then spotlights stocks that commonly appear in 
these similar portfolios and also lets you view popular portfolios. You 
must register for a free username and password to use the site.
✓
✓PredictWallStreet (www.predictwallstreet.com): PredictWallStreet 
lets you start sharing recommendations with others pretty quickly and 
easily. From the front page, just enter a stock symbol into the search 
field and click the Up button if you recommend the stock and the Down 
button if you think the stock will fall. You can see the average recom-
mendations of other users for other popular stock market indexes or 
popular stocks. One of the nice things about this site is that you can use 
it without registering.
Following the crowd when it comes to investing can often be a bad idea. 
During periods of market manias, when investors become overly bullish 
about particular types of stocks, they often bid stock prices up too high 
and set themselves up for disappointments. Some investors, who call 
themselves contrarians, instead figure out what the crowd is doing and 
then do the opposite. If the crowd is bullish about a stock, a contrarian 
would assume that the group is wrong and be bearish about the stock. 
There are exceptions, though, and sometimes the crowd can be right. A 
2011 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (www.nber.
org/papers/w17298) found that picks submitted by investors in 
Motley Fool’s CAPS system were “surprisingly informative about future 
stock prices.”
Evaluating Stock‐ and Mutual Fund–
Picking Newsletters and Websites
Whenever a crowd is trying to make quick money, there’s no shortage of 
people happy to offer their expertise and skill . . . for a fee. Stock investing is 
no different. You can find dozens of stock‐ and mutual fund–picking newslet-
ters, websites, books, and seminars. They all make great pitches for why you 
need to pay to subscribe to their wonderful services.
By and large, many of the pitches you see for stock‐picking newsletters and 
websites aren’t worth much, and you should be very skeptical before paying 
money for “systems” and “programs” that claim to be able to beat the market. 
A 1998 study by Jeffrey Jaffe and James Mahoney — available at http://
papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=937407 — found 
that stocks recommended by newsletters don’t outperform the market. 
The study also found that newsletters tend to pile onto yesterday’s winning 
stocks by recommending stocks that had done well in the recent past.

Before you sign up for a  
stock‐picking service . . .
Before you pay a dime for any stock‐picking newsletter or website, take the 
time to educate yourself about the specific service you’re considering.
Your first stop should be a column written by Mark Hulbert (www. 
marketwatch.com/commentary). Click on Hulbert’s name in a list of 
­columnists. Hulbert is a well‐known tracker of newsletter performance. 
Hulbert uses advanced performance‐tracking methods to measure not only 
how well stock‐picking newsletters perform, but also how much risk they’ve 
taken to get those returns. After all, a 30 percent annual return isn’t that 
impressive if your portfolio swings up and down 80 percent a year.
Hulbert writes a number of financial columns at MarketWatch that are 
worth reading because he tells you about trends among stock pickers. If 
you want to look up how a specific newsletter scores in Hulbert’s ratings, 
you need to sign up for his Hulbert Financial Digest, which ranks more 
than 180 ­newsletters. You can sign up by clicking the promotional link 
on his online column. The service costs $59 a year, but you can get a free 
30‐day pass.
If a newsletter or online stock‐picking service you’re considering isn’t tracked 
by Hulbert, you should be skeptical. It might mean the service doesn’t want 
its performance to be tracked — perhaps for shady reasons.
Hulbert’s data shows how few newsletters actually beat the market on a  
risk‐adjusted basis. For instance, during the 25‐year period ending in 
September 2015, only 8 of the 32 newsletters tracked by Hulbert during that 
time period beat the market. And you can be sure that the other 24 still 
­collected the subscription fees.
Using newsletters to your advantage
You might be wondering how the heck stock‐picking newsletters could 
be at all helpful when they are often so wrong. Again, the contrarian 
approach might make sense, and it’s a strategy used by many professional 
money managers.
The simplest way to see what newsletters are saying about stocks and doing 
the opposite is by determining how many newsletter writers are bullish 
and how many are bearish. When newsletter writers are nervous about the 

339

 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Analysts and Stock Pickers
market and selling stocks, that’s a signal to contrarian investors that now 
is a good time to buy stocks. And when newsletter writers are bullish and 
buying stocks, these contrarian investors start to take money off the table by 
­selling stocks.
Investors Intelligence (www.InvestorsIntelligence.com/x/ 
free_chart.html?r‐101l#) provides some of the information you  
need to be a contrarian. Most of the company’s data is available only to 
subscribers, but it does make a number of useful charts available for free. 
I like the NYSE Bullish % indicator, which tells you how bullish or bearish 
investors are about stocks. It’s up to you to decide whether to jump into 
the market when other investors are giddy — or if that’s your warning sign 
things are too good and it’s time to get out.
Don’t let reading newsletters bring  
on a junk‐mail deluge
One potential peril of signing up for stock‐­
picking services and newsletters is that some 
sell your name and address to other companies 
for profit. This might fill your mailbox or email 
in‐basket with ads you don’t want, including 
pitches for shady penny stock shams.
Here are two strategies to prevent you from 
getting slammed from junk mail:
✓
✓Use a slightly different name when you sign 
up for the stock‐picking service. Instead of 
signing up as Joe Smith, use JoeD Smith 
or something like that. If junk mail starts 
showing up to that unique name in your 
mailbox, you’ll know it’s the stock‐picking 
service that’s selling your information. You 
can notify the service to stop selling your 
information.
✓
✓Use an email “alias.” Some email services, 
such as Outlook.com, allow you to create 
secondary email addresses. If your email 
address is joesmith@outlook.com, you 
can create a secondary email address, 
or alias, of joesmithnewsletter@outlook.
com. You can use the alias when signing 
up for stock‐picking newsletters. If email 
comes in addressed to the alias, you know 
where it came from. You can also instruct 
Outlook.com to direct email addresses to 
an alias to a separate folder in your inbox 
or even delete it if you don’t want to receive 
it ­anymore.
✓
✓Sign up for the Direct Marketing 
Association’s Mail Preference Service 
(www.dmachoice.org). This service 
helps you take your name off of many lists 
used by companies to send out advertising 
and promotion material. You can fill out the

onds don’t make very good cocktail party chatter. Just try to brag about 
your 3‐percent‐a‐year bond return at a party. The only heads you’ll turn 
will be the ones running away from you yawning. Bonds just aren’t as ­exciting 
or glamorous as stocks, which can often gain more value in an hour than 
you’ll collect from bonds all year.
But don’t let the fact that bonds are, well, often boring discourage you from 
owning them. Bonds, often called fixed‐income securities, are essentially IOUs 
issued by companies, cities, governments, and government agencies. These 
IOUs come with a promise to repay the lender by a specific time at a specific 
interest rate. These stable streams of cash flow can be very valuable if you 
choose bonds wisely. Bonds can help smooth out the ups and downs in your 
portfolio and help you reach your financial goals.
In this chapter, I explain what a bond is and how it differs from other invest-
ments, including stocks. I also show you ways to find out more about bonds 
and get up with the terms and lingo. You get a chance to discover websites 
that let you research bonds to find the ones that might fit your portfolio the 
best. And I show you ways to buy bonds online as well as a few alternatives 
to bonds you might consider.

342
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Getting Acquainted with Bonds
If you’ve ever lent money to someone and set up a repayment program, 
you already know what a bond is. A bond is an IOU that entitles you to a 
stream of payments from the borrower. Companies, governments, cities, and 
­government agencies often sell bonds so that they can raise money to build 
facilities, build bridges, or finance their operations. The money that was 
­borrowed (called the principal) must be repaid over time at a ­predetermined 
interest rate and returned in full by a set period of time in the future (called 
the maturity date). This means that when you buy most bonds, you lend your 
money and then sit back and collect a stream of payments until the loan 
comes due. Not all bonds are alike, though. There are even some bonds, 
called zero‐coupon bonds, where you lend money now but are paid back with 
interest in one big chunk in the future.
Bonds by their nature offer investors several benefits:
✓
✓Generally stable and predictable cash payments: Investors who aren’t 
looking for any big surprises tend to appreciate bonds’ preset rate of 
return. When you buy a bond and hold it until maturity, you know ahead 
of time what your return will be. This can be useful for reaching financial 
obligations.
✓
✓Repayment of principal: When you buy a bond, you’ll receive interest 
payments in addition to the money you loaned back, as long as the bor-
rower can afford the payments and doesn’t default. Investors who want 
to preserve their initial investment like bonds for this very reason.
✓
✓Liquidity: You might be familiar with bank certificates of deposit (CDs), 
which also pay interest and return the original investments. But unlike 
most CDs, which you must hold for a set period of time or pay a penalty, 
you can sell your bonds to other investors, in most cases, at any time 
just like you’d sell a stock. This characteristic of bonds means you can 
raise cash if you need to.
You have two ways to make money from a bond. You can hold it until 
it comes due, or matures. That way, you collect the interest as it’s paid. 
Your other option is to sell the bond to someone else before it matures. 
Just remember, though, when you sell a bond, you might not get back 
what you paid. The bond’s price might fall if the bond becomes less 
desirable for reasons discussed later in the chapter.
✓
✓Diversification: Bond prices tend to move up and down in a different 
pattern than stock prices. By owning stocks and bonds, you can smooth 
out the bumps in your portfolio. Table 16‐1 shows you how bonds might 
not go up as much as stocks, but they don’t usually fall as much either. 
It’s not just theory, as the table below shows. The worst‐ever loss by 
long‐term Treasurys was –14.9 percent in 2009, which is downright puny 
next to stocks’ worst year, a 43.3 percent decline in 1931.

343

 Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online
Typically, investors who need a more stable portfolio place most of their 
investments in bonds. But even if you’re terrified of the thought of losing 
money, it’s usually not a good idea to put your entire portfolio in bonds. 
Mixing some stocks in your portfolio can reduce your risk and increase your 
returns because bonds and stocks usually don’t rise and fall at the same time 
by the same degree.
Knowing who issues debt
Before you can buy or sell bonds, you must understand the several types of 
bonds, based on who sold them. Each type of bond has unique traits and can 
be bought or sold online differently. The following is a quick rundown of the 
major issuers of bonds:
✓
✓U.S. government: Debt instruments sold by the U.S. government are 
popular because they’re backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States, which stands behind these loans and promises that they’ll be 
repaid. That greatly reduces, if not eliminates, the risk that you won’t 
get paid. These fixed‐income securities are often called Treasurys, and 
they come in three main varieties: Treasury bills mature in one year or 
less, Treasury notes mature in more than a year and up to 10 years, and 
Treasury bonds mature in more than 10 years. TreasuryDirect (www.
treasurydirect.gov) provides in‐depth information about Treasurys.
Even if you’re not interested in buying bonds, the yield on Treasurys is 
a very important figure to keep in mind. Treasury yields tell you how 
much return you can get for taking little to no risk. If a risk‐free Treasury 
pays 5 percent, you probably wouldn’t be willing to buy a risky stock 
unless it would return considerably more than 5 percent.
Treasurys are often called risk‐free investments, but that’s not really 
true. Even Treasurys face interest‐rate risk. Say you buy a Treasury 
that pays 3 percent interest. If inflation rises, and interest rates rise to 
4 percent as a result, your 3 percent interest rate isn’t looking so hot

­anymore. If you sell the bond, you’ll get less for it than you paid. And if 
you hold onto the bond, your 3 percent interest rate is lackluster.
✓
✓Government agencies and government‐sponsored enterprises: 
Individual government agencies can also borrow money. Debt issued by 
agencies is still considered safe, while perhaps not as safe as Treasurys. 
That means agency bonds may pay slightly higher interest rates than 
Treasurys.
Some examples of agency bonds include those sold by the Government 
National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae (www.ginniemae.gov), 
to provide financing to low‐ and moderate‐income families to buy homes. 
Ginnie Mae loans are backed by several government agencies. Similarly, 
you find lenders called government‐sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that, 
although closely tied to the government and often created by Congress, 
are private companies and are therefore not technically agencies.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae (www. 
fanniemae.com), is a GSE that buys and sells mortgage‐backed 
­securities that pass interest and principal payments made by 
­homeowners to investors who own the securities.
Agency debt is in flux as the rules were turned upside down after the 
financial crisis linked with mortgage loans erupted in 2007 and 2008. 
Agency debt isn’t technically backed by the federal government, so it’s 
considered to be riskier than Treasurys. Fannie Mae is a company spon-
sored by the federal government that used to have its stock listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Investors long believed that the government 
would quickly step in and intervene if there was trouble. These investors 
were right in 2008.
As the mortgage market was seizing up in 2008, the U.S. government 
essentially took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by placing them into 
conservatorship. While the government took action in 2008, it wasn’t 
obligated to do so. Since then, the company’s stock was booted from 
the NYSE (although they still trade on the Over‐The‐Counter Bulletin 
Board marketplace, which is described in more detail in Chapter 2). 
Uncertainty about what the government will do in the future makes 
agency debt a question in some people’s minds.
✓
✓Companies: Bonds issued by companies, sometimes called corporates, 
allow them to pay for equipment and services they need in order to 
expand or grow. Companies pay higher interest rates than the govern-
ment because there’s a larger chance they will default or hit hard times 
and have trouble paying back the money they borrowed. Bonds sold by 
rock‐solid companies are called investment grade. Small companies or 
companies with shaky finances issue what’s called high‐yield or junk‐
bond debt. Investment‐grade bonds pay lower interest rates than junk 
bonds because investors are more certain they’ll get their money back.

345

 Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online
✓
✓Cities and municipalities: Cities may borrow money by selling bonds, 
called municipal bonds, or just munis. The biggest attraction of munis to 
investors is the fact that their interest often isn’t taxable by the federal 
government. And if you buy a muni bond issued by a government in the 
state or city you live in, the interest might also not be subject to state 
or city tax. Munis are often called tax‐exempt bonds for this reason. 
You pay a price for this tax benefit, though. Munis often pay lower 
­interest rates than bonds with similar risk. InvestorGuide.com (www. 
investorguide.com/igu‐article‐575‐bonds‐municipal‐
bonds.html) provides more information about munis.
Don’t just look at the seemingly low interest rate offered by a tax‐exempt 
muni bond when deciding whether you want to buy it. The actual inter-
est rate is higher after you factor in the fact that the interest payments 
often aren’t taxable. For example, if an investor in the 28 percent tax 
bracket buys a muni bond paying 5 percent interest, that’s equivalent to 
a 6.94 percent interest rate from a taxable bond. And that’s a good thing. 
One other thing to remember: Not all muni bonds qualify for the tax 
breaks, so be sure to check before you buy one.
Want to compare the interest rate on a tax‐exempt muni bond with a 
taxable bond? The Investing in Bonds website provides a table that 
­converts tax‐exempt interest rates to taxable rates for different tax 
brackets at (www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp? 
catid=5&subcatid=24&id=206). Vanguard’s taxable‐equivalent yield 
­calculator (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsTaxEquivForYield) 
is more customizable, allowing you to enter different yields and tax 
brackets.
Investing in “Bowie” bonds
Bonds are usually sold by governments and 
companies, but some interesting exceptions 
have cropped up. One of the more famous and 
unorthodox sellers of bonds was rock star David 
Bowie. Bowie generated $55 million for himself 
in 1997 by selling “Bowie Bonds.” Investors 
who bought the bonds were entitled to the 
cash stream generated by sales of Bowie’s 
albums for a decade. Similar music‐based 
bonds followed, allowing investors to buy the 
cash streams from James Brown and the Isley 
Brothers. Individual investors were unable to 
invest in Bowie Bonds. The Bowie Bond was 
the innovation of the Pullman Group (www.
pullmanbonds.com). The future of music‐
based bonds is uncertain as more consumers 
buy and stream individual music tracks from 
online music stores, rather than purchase full‐
length albums from music retailers. So far, few 
artists have been able to pull off big bond sales.

Common traits of bonds
Bond investors have their own language — and InvestinginBonds.com (www.
investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=46&id=7) provides a 
comprehensive glossary of terms. But before you get overwhelmed by all the 
terms, the following list offers a quick description of the most important ones 
you need to know. Nearly all bonds have the following characteristics:
✓
✓Face (or par) value: The face value is the amount of money you’ll get 
back when the bond matures. For many bonds, the face value is the 
principal, or amount that you’ve lent. The face value is also sometimes 
called the principal. There are some bonds where the face value is not 
equal to the principal, including zero‐coupon bonds. You buy these 
bonds for less than the face value and get paid all in one lump sum in 
the future. Zero‐coupon bonds have unique risks, as I discuss later.
✓
✓Interest rate: The interest rate measures how much you’ll receive as a 
payment in exchange for lending the money. Generally, the interest rate 
is a percentage of the money lent, known as the face value of the bond. 
Interest, often called the coupon rate, is often paid twice a year.

Example: If you bought a $1,000 bond that pays 5 percent interest, you 
would be paid $50 a year in interest or $25 twice a year. You would get 
your $1,000 back when the bond matured.
Interest rates can be fixed, meaning that the same rate of interest is paid 
to the investor for the life of the bond. Interest rates can also be floating 
and move up or down based on the direction of interest rates paid by 
Treasurys. Some bonds don’t pay interest until the bond matures. These 
zero‐coupon bonds are bought for less than their face value. Instead of 
receiving an interest payment twice a year as with many bonds, a zero‐
coupon bond pays nothing until it matures. When the zero‐coupon bond 
matures, the investor receives the face value, which includes the interest.
Another example: Imagine an investor who pays $600 for a zero‐coupon 
bond that matures in ten years, when it will pay $1,000. At the end of the 
ten years, the investor gets his $600 principal back plus $400. That $400 
is the interest, which in this case amounts to an interest rate of more 
than 5 percent a year.
✓
✓Maturity: A bond’s maturity is the date by which it must be paid off. 
Debt maturities can range from days to 20 or more years. A fixed‐income 
security’s maturity is very important and determines what it’s called. 
Table 16‐2 shows you what different fixed‐income securities (­excluding 
Treasurys, which have their own naming convention, as explained 
­previously) are called based on their maturities.
✓
✓Special provisions: Bonds can be customized by the borrowers and 
contain unique privileges for either the seller or the buyer of the bonds. 
A call provision is especially important if you’re interested in buying 
bonds. If a bond can be called, that means the borrower can repay the 
loan before the maturity date. You can expect a bond to be called if 
­current interest rates fall below the interest rate on the bond. If you’re 
collecting a fat 7 percent interest rate on a bond, and interest rates fall 
to 5 percent for similar bonds, the issuer will likely call the bond and

end your gravy train. Similarly, some bonds have put provisions, which 
allow the bond buyers to force the bond seller to buy the bond back 
before the maturity date.
✓
✓Price: You can buy bonds directly from the issuers, and when you do, 
you often pay the face value. But, you can also buy bonds from ­previous 
owners in the secondary market, and when you do, you’ll pay the 
­current price. A bond’s price is determined by many variables, such as 
the current interest rates on similar bonds.
When a bond’s price is less than its face value, it’s said to trade at a 
discount. Bonds trade at a discount when interest rates rise (say, to 
6 percent), making the bond’s interest rate (say, just 5 percent) less 
attractive. When a bond’s price is greater than its face value, it’s said to 
trade at a premium. This happens when interest rates fall (perhaps to 
4 percent), making this bond’s interest rate (still at 5 percent) look more 
attractive and the bond worth more.
✓
✓Credit ratings: When you buy a bond from a company, one of the biggest 
dangers you face is the chance that the company won’t be able to pay 
you back, or will default. Debt‐rating agencies study companies’ financial 
statements and rate them based on their ability to pay. The shakier the 
company, the more it needs to pay in interest to attract investors. Debt 
ratings are discussed more fully in Chapter 15, including instructions 
on how to access them. The three main debt‐rating agencies, Moody’s 
Investors Service (www.moodys.com), Standard & Poor’s (www. 
standardandpoors.com), and Fitch Ratings (www.fitchratings.
com), provide more details about their ratings online.
✓
✓Current yield: The current yield tells you how much interest you’ll 
receive from the bond based on the bond’s price. You can calculate a 
bond’s current yield by dividing the annual interest payment by the 
­purchase price.
Example: You paid $900 for a bond with a $1,000 face value that pays  
5 percent, or $50, a year in interest. The current yield is 5.6 percent, 
which is calculated by dividing $50 by $900 and multiplying by 100 to 
convert the answer into a percentage.
✓
✓Yield to maturity: This tells you how much interest you’ll gain as a 
­percentage of the price you paid for the bond if you hold the bond until 
it matures. Yield to maturity is one of the best ways to measure the true 
return of a bond.
MoneyChimp’s online Bond Yield calculator (www.moneychimp.com/
calculator/popup/calculator.htm?mode=calc_bondytm) can 
calculate a bond’s current yield and yield to maturity for you. You need 
to enter the bond’s current price, face value, coupon rate, and years to 
maturity.

350
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Remember that bond prices fall when yields rise, almost like a teeter‐
totter. Many beginning investors get hung up on this concept. Just 
think of it this way: If you own a bond that yields 5 percent, but yields 
on similar bonds rise to 6 percent, your 5 percent looks pretty paltry. If 
you tried to sell your bond, you’d have to cut the price to find a buyer. 
If someone tells you bonds are down, make sure that you know whether 
that person is talking about bond yields or bond prices.
✓
✓Duration: A bond’s duration measures the time it takes, on average, 
for the bond buyer to get his or her money back. Duration differs from 
maturity in that it counts the interest payments made before the bond 
comes due. Duration is very handy because it can help you compare 
­different bonds and determine which ones are more volatile. The 
larger the duration, the longer it takes for investors to get their money 
back, which makes them more volatile. Investopedia’s Bond Duration 
­calculator (www.investopedia.com/calculator/BondDurCDate.
aspx) can tell you a bond’s duration if you enter the bond’s details, 
including face value, yield to maturity, interest rate, current maturity, 
and the schedule for payments.
Understanding the yield curve
Anytime you read about or investigate bonds, 
you’ll inevitably hear someone mention the yield 
curve. The yield curve is a chart that shows you 
how yields on short‐term fixed‐income securi-
ties (with maturities of three months or less) 
compare with long‐term bonds (with maturities 
of 30 years or so). The Investing in Bonds site 
(http://investinginbonds.com/
learnmore.asp?catid=46&id=8) 
describes the yield curve. But I step you through 
the basics here. Generally, yield curves come in 
four shapes:
✓
✓Normal: Most of the time, investors demand 
higher interest rates on long‐term bonds 
than they do on short‐term notes. That’s nat-
ural. If you let someone borrow money for 
30 years, you’ll want more interest because 
there’s a greater chance you’ll never see 
your money again. That’s why yields (most 
of the time) will be at their lowest point for 
the short‐term fixed‐income securities and 
gradually move higher.
✓
✓Steep: Most of the time, investors demand 
two or more percentage points in extra yield 
when lending money for 30 years ­compared 
with loaning money for a short time. If the 
interest rate on a three‐month note is 
4 percent, investors will demand  
6 percent or higher on a comparable 
long‐term bond in normal times. But, if 
the ­difference between the short‐term 
and long‐term rates gets even wider, that 
­creates a steep yield curve. A steep yield 
curve often indicates that investors expect 
economic growth to speed up.

351

 Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online
✓
✓Inverted: When investors are willing to 
lend money for the long term and accept 
lower interest rates than they’d take for a 
short‐term loan, the yield curve is inverted. 
Inverted yield curves can indicate that 
investors are worried the economy is about 
to slow down for a prolonged period of time. 
If the economy slows down, interest rates 
in the future might also fall. That means 
investors want to lock in current interest 
rates for the long term before they decline.
✓
✓Flat: When the interest rates on short‐term 
loans equal long‐term rates, you have a flat 
yield curve. A flat yield curve indicates that 
investors aren’t at all too sure about where 
the economy is headed.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury uses a 
visual representation of bond yields to expect 
the yield curve. The online tool lets you see 
how the yields on bonds of different maturi-
ties compare to each other and how they’ve 
changed over time. To see how it looks, go 
to www.treasury.gov/resource‐
center/data‐chart‐center/
interest‐rates/Pages/Historic‐
Yield‐Data‐Visualization.aspx. 
You can choose the date you want to analyze 
and the site will plot the yield curve so you can 
understand and see what’s happening with 
interest rates.

How to Find and Buy Bonds Online
Just as with stocks, there’s no one way to buy bonds. You can buy individual 
bonds using a mainstream online broker, you can buy directly from the 
­borrowers, or you can deal directly with brokers who specialize in bonds. 
But you can also buy bonds through a mutual fund or exchange‐traded fund 
(ETF). In the following sections, I show you how to buy bonds using these 
major methods.
Finding individual bonds online
Finding and buying an individual bond is very similar to finding and buying 
an individual stock. It’s up to you to find the bonds that have what you’re 
looking for in terms of risk and reward.
Online tools can help you find bonds that fit your needs. You can use various 
bond screening tools, which let you define characteristics of a bond you’d 
like to find. The bond screener then cross‐checks what you’re looking for in a 
bond against its database of available bonds. A few bond screeners that can 
help you quickly find bonds you’re interested in include the following:
✓
✓Yahoo! Finance’s Bond Screener (http://screen.yahoo.com/
bonds.html): Yahoo!’s bond screener first asks you whether you’re 
interested in buying a Treasury, a zero‐coupon Treasury, a corporate 
security, or a municipal security. (If you’re looking for a muni bond, you 
can also indicate what state you’re interested in.) You can narrow your 
search by other factors, ranging from the bond’s price, coupon, yield to 
maturity, and credit rating. After you enter what you’re looking for, click 
the Find Bonds button to get a list of all the bonds that meet your stan-
dards. Click a bond and write down the name of the issuer, coupon, and 
maturity date. You need this information to buy the bond.
✓
✓Zions Direct’s Bond Center (www.zionsdirect.com/products‐
and‐services/products/bond‐store.php): The Zions Direct site 
­provides a full‐fledged screener that lets you be even more specific 
about what you’re looking for in a bond. You can filter not only on 
muni bonds and Treasurys but also on high‐yield, investment‐grade, 
and agency bonds. From the Zions Direct site, scroll down just past the 
Search the Bond Store heading. Just click the link for the type of bond 
you’re interested in, wait for a page similar to what you see in Figure 16‐2 
to appear, and then enter all your search criteria into the appropriate 
text fields. When you’re done, click the Search button, and you see the 
list of bonds that make your cut. Write down the name of the issuer, 
coupon, and maturity date.

353

 Chapter 16: Researching and Buying Bonds Online
✓
✓Online brokers’ sites: Most of the large online brokers mentioned in 
Chapter 4 — including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and 
E*TRADE — all provide bond‐screening tools on their sites. Check with 
your online broker to see whether it has a feature that lets you screen 
for fixed‐income securities.
Bond screeners tell you what the all‐important yield to maturity of a bond is. 
This is a great tip because it saves you and your calculator the hassle of mea-
suring the yield to maturity yourself.
Sealing the deal: Buying  
individual bonds online
After you’ve found the perfect individual bond, you need to know how to buy 
it. You can buy bonds in several ways:
✓
✓Buying straight from the government: If you’re interested in buying 
Treasurys, you can cut out the middleman and buy directly from 
Figure 16-2:

needs.

the U.S. Treasury at TreasuryDirect (www.treasurydirect.gov). 
TreasuryDirect lets you buy
•	Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.
•	Treasury Inflation‐Protected Securities (or TIPs): TIPs are unique 
securities that pay you more interest and principal if interest  
rates rise.
•	Savings bonds: These bonds, designed for individuals, don’t 
pay very high interest rates and aren’t appropriate for inves-
tors ­looking for the best returns. But savings bonds might have 
some tax advantages, are backed by the government, and pay 
­predictable interest. TreasuryDirect’s Tax Advantage Calculator 
(www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCTax) can help you measure 
whether you can get a tax benefit from owning savings bonds. The 
Savings Bond Calculator (www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/
tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm) can help you decide 
whether savings bonds are right for you.
Buying Treasurys from the government is a good option because there’s 
no fee for most investors. You also don’t have to invest much. The mini-
mum investment is just $100 for Treasurys and TIPs and $25 for savings 
bonds. Not sure how to use TreasuryDirect? TreasuryDirect’s Guided 
Tour (www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/TDTour/default.htm) 
steps you through the specific process of buying bonds through the site.
✓
✓Buying from a mainstream online broker: Several of the bigger online 
brokerage firms (including Charles Schwab, E*TRADE, Fidelity, TD 
Ameritrade, and Scottrade) also let you buy and sell bonds. But remem-
ber that the stock‐trading commissions don’t apply because you’re 
buying bonds, and the bond commission can vary wildly depending on 
the broker and what kind of bond you’re buying.
Several online brokerage firms have slashed the fees to buy bonds. At 
Fidelity, Schwab, and E*TRADE, you can buy Treasurys online for no 
commission and most other types of bonds — including agencies and 
corporate bonds — for $1 per bond.
Some brokers charge so‐called mark‐up fees for bonds. Mark‐up fees are 
added to the price of the bond. For instance, you might buy a bond for 
$1,000 but later see that you actually paid $1,045, where $1,000 is the 
price of the bond and $45 is the mark‐up. Nothing is illegal about mark‐
up fees, and they’ve been a common way for brokers to charge com-
missions for buying bonds. You just want to find out ahead of time how 
much the mark‐up fee will be and confirm that you weren’t overcharged 
by reviewing the confirmation of your order.
Some brokers charge commissions when you buy Treasurys. TD 
Ameritrade, for instance, charges $25. You should think long and hard 
before paying any commissions or fees to buy Treasurys because you 
can buy them for free and online from TreasuryDirect.

✓Buying with the help of a bond broker: Some brokers specialize in 
just bond trading. Zions Direct and JW Korth (www.shop4bonds.
com) are two examples. FMSbonds.com (www.fmsbonds.com) 
­specializes in munis.
✓
✓Buying via a bond mutual fund: Buying individual bonds can be 
­somewhat complex. You need to understand yields, prices, duration, 
and other cryptic measures of value. And that doesn’t even scratch 
some advanced bond techniques, such as laddering.
Laddering is a technique used to lower your risk when investing in 
bonds. When you ladder, you buy bonds that expire at different times, 
say at one year, two years, and ten years. That way, if you buy bonds and 
interest rates rise, when your one‐year bonds mature, you can reinvest 
the proceeds at the higher interest rate. Fidelity (http://personal.
fidelity.com/products/fixedincome/ladders.shtml) provides 
a helpful description of what laddering is and how it can help you.
You can ladder and diversify your own bond portfolio. But for many 
investors, it’s easier to just buy a bond mutual fund that does it for you. 
With a bond mutual fund, the laddering and diversification is taken 
care of for you. Just as with stock mutual funds, you can buy actively 
­managed bond funds run by portfolio managers who try to beat the 
market or passive index bond funds.
You can find bond funds with the mutual fund–screening tools discussed 
in Chapter 10, but a good bet here would be the Vanguard Total Bond 
Market index. The index can be bought as a mutual fund that owns a smat-
tering of government, corporate, agency, and other bonds and charges a 
reasonable 0.2 percent annual expense ratio. If you’re looking for an easy 
way to add bonds to your portfolio, this might be a good choice.
Think twice before buying a long‐term government bond mutual fund. 
You’ll pay an annual fee for the mutual fund, sometimes 1 percent a year. 
That’s probably not a good idea considering you can buy Treasurys for 
free from TreasuryDirect.
✓
✓Bond exchange‐traded funds (ETFs): Another option for buying bonds is 
through exchange‐traded funds. ETFs, explained in depth in Chapter 11, 
are baskets of investments that trade like stocks. A bond ETF is ideal 
for investors who primarily buy stocks but want to easily add bonds 
to their portfolio and keep fees down. These ETFs track bond indexes, 
such as the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which tracks a broad basket 
of bonds. Buying a bond ETF is the bond version of investing in a stock 
index like the Standard & Poor’s 500.
It’s easy to get started. Just pick the bond ETF you want and buy it 
through your online broker just as you’d buy a stock. You can read how 
to buy and sell stocks in Chapter 5. Note as well that you can find bond 
ETFs using the ETF‐screening tools discussed in Chapter 11. (Three ETFs 
you may want to check out are iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond [AGG], 
SPDR Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond [LAG], and Vanguard Total Bond 
Market [BND]. All three are diversified and have low fees.)

Considering Bond Alternatives
The relative safety of bonds as well as their lower volatility make them 
well suited for many investors’ portfolios. But don’t make the mistake 
of thinking bonds are without risks. The Investing in Bonds site (www.
investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&id=383) 
describes the risks of bonds in detail. But these are the risks you should 
be most aware of:
✓
✓Default risk: Unless you’re buying Treasurys, you’re taking a chance 
that the borrower won’t pay you back.
✓
✓Market risk: If bonds go out of favor because investors are seeking 
higher returns, the price of your bonds might decline.
✓
✓Liquidity risk: From time to time, investors get nervous about the 
­economy or about bonds, and they simply refuse to buy bonds. This is 
generally more of a problem with unusual or rare bonds, and it isn’t a 
worry with Treasurys or investment‐grade bonds.
✓
✓Interest rate risk: The threat of higher interest rates is one of the big-
gest risks you face when you buy a bond. If rates rise, the interest rate 
you locked in suddenly isn’t so lucrative, which decreases the value of 
your bond.
Some investors have an aversion to bonds for these reasons and others. 
These investors don’t like the fact that bond values can fall, because bonds 
are supposed to be safer investments. If you’re a bond hater, keep reading. 
The rest of this section explores a few bond alternatives.
Money market funds and  
certificates of deposit
If you’re looking for safe investments but want to get more interest than 
you’re getting in a bank savings account, you might consider money market 
funds or certificates of deposit:
✓
✓Money market funds are a place to park money you need in case of 
emergency. They invest in very safe fixed‐income securities, such as 
highly rated investments that come due in 90 days or less. Money mar-
kets generally invest in short‐term Treasurys and commercial paper. 
Commercial paper obligations are loans generally given to creditworthy 
companies to fund short‐term needs, such as buying goods to be sold 
in a few months. Money markets, however, aren’t insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Money markets are relatively 
safe, but not bulletproof. During the financial crisis that erupted in 2007 
and 2008, one money market fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, “broke

the buck” and returned just 99 cents of every investor’s dollar. (You can 
find out what is, and isn’t, insured by the FDIC at www.fdic.gov/ 
consumers/consumer/information/fdiciorn.html.)
Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.com) is a useful site to find the best 
money market fund for you. The site’s CD & Investments tab has a 
great money market account screener that you can use to pick a money 
market account that best suits your needs.
✓
✓Certificates of deposit (CDs): If you want an even safer investment than 
a money market — and are willing to take a lower return — you might 
want to consider a certificate of deposit. CDs are typically issued by 
banks, and their interest rates can vary quite a bit. CDs are also usually 
insured by the FDIC.
If you buy a CD, your money is locked up, and you’ll usually get hit with 
a penalty if you need the money earlier than its maturity. If you need 
access to your money, a money market might be a better choice.
If you’re looking for the highest CD rates, these sites might help:
•	Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.com): Bankrate.com can help you 
track down a money market fund, and it can also help you pinpoint 
the highest‐yielding CDs. Just click the CDs & Investments tab to 
bring up a page with various CD tables, CD calculators, and CD 
search tools.
•	MoneyRates.com (www.money‐rates.com): This site lists national 
averages for CDs, money markets, and Treasurys.
•	iMoneyNet (www.imoneynet.com): And you thought iMoney was 
the green stuff you set aside to buy a new iPhone. iMoney is in fact 
a great source of info for all things money funds related. It explains 
the different types of money funds and provides average rates. 
You can also use the site to find large and highly regarded money 
market funds. iMoneyNet’s Money Fund Basics (www.imoneynet.
com/retail‐money‐funds/money‐fund‐basics.aspx) 
explains the details about these investments.
You might be able to buy some money market funds through your online 
broker, but sometimes you need to contact the money market provider 
directly through its website. With CDs, you need to sign up over the 
bank’s website.
Wall Street’s lost child: Preferred stock
You find advantages and disadvantages to bonds and stocks, which is prob-
ably why there’s room for both in most portfolios. But there’s a unique 
security that’s kind of like the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of Wall Street: pre-
ferred stock.

358
Part III: Maximizing Investment Knowledge 
Preferred stocks, commonly called preferreds, try to give investors the best 
of both worlds. Preferred stock is a special type of stock that’s sold by com-
panies and acts more like a bond. Companies pay preferred stockholders a 
fixed dividend from earnings. Unlike with bonds, though, the company isn’t 
obligated to pay the dividend if it doesn’t have adequate earnings. If a com-
pany hits a tough patch, it can delay paying the preferred dividend until it 
regains its footing, after which it must pay the dividends it missed.
Preferreds have some advantages over bonds, though. Many preferreds give 
investors the option to convert their preferred stock into common stock. 
You might have the right to own a part of the company and enjoy the upside, 
rather than just collect a fixed interest payment. You can also buy preferred 
stocks through most online brokers.
Keep in mind, though, that many preferred stocks are callable, meaning that a 
company can retire the shares by paying investors’ money back, at any time. 
If that happens, you’ll no longer receive the interest payments.

hen people tell me they’re afraid to start investing online, most of the 
time it’s the fear of making a mistake that’s holding them back. With 
its jargon, formulas, charts, and Wall Street slang, investing online can seem 
scary and intimidating. For some investors, the thought of managing their 
money by themselves is overwhelming. The fear of making a mistake and 
losing hard‐earned money is too much to bear.
Calming these fears is what this chapter is all about. After answering thou-
sands of emails sent to me by readers of my online Ask Matt column at 
USATODAY.com, I’ve heard it all. Most of the mistakes investors make can 
be neatly placed into ten categories, each of which I explain in this chapter. 
By reading about the common mistakes other online investors make, you’ll 
probably think twice before committing them yourself. I discuss the ten 
most common mistakes, explain why they’re made, and show you how to 
avoid them.
Buying and Selling Too Frequently
One of the greatest things about online investing is that it gives investors the 
power to buy and sell stocks whenever they want. Unfortunately, though, 
some investors turn this 24/7 access to their portfolios and stock trading into 
a liability.

362
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Don’t get me wrong; it’s great that investors can check their portfolios when-
ever they want instead of calling a broker or waiting for a printed brokerage 
statement to arrive in the mail. It’s just that constant access turns some 
investors into
✓
✓Obsessive portfolio checkers: These investors are constantly logging 
on to their online brokerage accounts and checking the value of their 
portfolios. And I mean constantly — often several times a day. This is 
a problem because it makes investors get overly concerned about the 
short‐term swings in their stocks.
If the market falls 1 percent one day, these investors measure how much 
money they lost and start thinking about all the things they could have 
bought if they’d just sold the day before. Clearly, no one can have the 
foresight to sell ahead of a 1 percent downdraft, much less a 10 percent 
correction. But these obsessive investors start to take every $1 move in 
their portfolio personally.
Checking your portfolio’s value online is fine, unless it starts to affect 
your judgment. If you find you’re telling yourself you should have sold 
or bought because the market is up or down in a given day, you might be 
missing the point of investing.
✓
✓Trigger‐fingered investors: These investors are so antsy that they can’t 
help but trade. They buy and sell stocks in a flash, well, just because 
they can. Trigger‐fingered investors figure commissions are so cheap 
that there’s no harm in picking up shares of a stock, trying it out, and 
then dumping it if it doesn’t work out. Trigger‐fingered investors also 
seem to get a rush out of trading online, much like someone might get 
when pulling on the arm of a slot machine.
The trouble, though, is that these investors are hurting themselves more 
than helping. Not only are they paying more in taxes than they should 
(you can find out more about how taxes can reduce your returns later in 
this chapter and also in Chapter 3), but they’re also setting themselves 
up for losses as they dump stocks they can’t remember why they bought 
in the first place. Without an asset allocation plan in place, these inves-
tors are just haphazardly buying stocks and have no idea what their plan 
is. You can find out how to determine the perfect asset allocation for you 
in Chapter 9.
Letting Losers Run and  
Cutting Winners Short
Human nature, in some respects, is your worst enemy when investing online. 
Humans react in particular ways when faced with certain circumstances, but 
those reactions can work against you in investing. Two of those elements of 

363

 Chapter 17: Ten Top Mistakes Made by Online Investors
human nature are defending bad decisions too long and cashing in on good 
decisions too early.
If you’ve ever been to Las Vegas, you’ve seen this before. Just walk over to 
one of the ATMs scattered on the casino floor, and you’re sure to bump into 
people who lost all the cash they brought, so they’re pulling out another 
$500. These people figure they’ll “win it all back,” if they keep trying. The 
same thing, sadly, happens with some investors. Investors who buy an 
­individual stock that collapses often hang onto it, figuring that “it will come 
back” because “it’s a good company.”
When you’re buying individual stocks, it’s critical that you cut your losses. 
Pick a percentage you’re willing to risk and stick with it. You can use stop 
market orders or protective puts, both described in Chapter 5.
Other investors make the opposite mistake by cashing in winning stocks too 
soon. Say your asset allocation tells you to put 20 percent of your stocks in 
emerging markets, so you buy an emerging markets index mutual fund. If 
emerging markets soar in the following few weeks, but your emerging market 
index fund still accounts for 20 percent or less of your portfolio, you should 
resist the temptation to sell it all to lock in your gains. Instead, you should 
stick with your asset allocation. To understand how asset allocations can 
boost your returns and cut your risk, read Chapter 9.
The rule of cutting losses short applies to individual stocks. If you don’t think 
you’ll have the courage to sell individual stocks when they sink, you should 
instead invest in index mutual funds or exchange‐traded funds (ETFs) that 
follow a broad stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. These 
investments are already diversified and less risky than individual stocks, 
so you don’t have to worry so much about a complete wipeout due to a 
­company‐specific problem.
Focusing on the Per‐Share  
Price of the Stock
The fact that one stock is $2 a share and another is $500 a share tells you 
absolutely nothing about either stock. The $2‐a‐share stock might actually 
be more expensive than the $500‐a‐share stock because it either doesn’t grow 
as rapidly, doesn’t earn as much relative to its stock price, or is riskier.
A stock’s per‐share price is meaningful only if you compare it with 
­something else. Typically, investors multiply the stock price by the stock’s 
number of shares outstanding to get the company’s market value or market 
­capitalization. A stock’s market value tells you whether a stock is small, 
medium, or large, and gives you a good idea of its valuation. Chapter 9 
explains why the size of a stock’s market value is so important.

364
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Don’t be fooled into thinking it’s better to own 1,000 shares of a $2 stock 
than owning 100 shares of a $20 stock. What really matters is the company’s 
­valuation and market value. Think of it this way: What’s better — buying one 
reliable car for $8,000 or ten unreliable and broken‐down $800 cars?
Failing to Track Risk and Return
For some reason, prudence often vanishes when it comes to online investing. 
Many online investors, perhaps because it takes some effort and practice, 
don’t take the time to see how much risk they’re taking on to get the reward 
they’re expecting from stocks they buy.
The biggest danger of investing without knowing your risk and return is that 
you gamble not knowing whether you’re doing more harm than good to your 
portfolio. You might be spending a great deal of time and effort buying indi-
vidual stocks, thinking the effort is worthwhile, but it might turn out you’d be 
better off buying and holding index mutual funds. Instead of burning hours 
looking at stock charts, you might be better off spending the time with your 
family, on hobbies, or at work.
Chapter 8 shows you the techniques of measuring your portfolio. You can 
find out how to calculate the returns and risk yourself or check out websites 
that can do it for you.
Taking Advice from the Wrong People
It’s almost hard not to get stock tips. Turn on the TV. Talk to people sitting 
next to you on an airplane. Chat with other browsers in the financial section 
of the bookstore (unless they’re reading Investing Online For Dummies, of 
course). Connect with other investors online. You’ll constantly encounter 
people who are convinced that such‐and‐such a stock is going to take off 
and that you need to buy in now. Some of my readers have told me they’ve 
bought shares of retailers because employees told them to.
Here’s my advice: Unless Warren Buffett is the guy sitting next to you on the 
airplane, you’re better off politely nodding and wiping your memory clean of 
all the investing advice you get. Stick with your asset allocation plan.
You should also be cautious of advice you’re getting from a financial 
­advisor that you hire. The two things you should do when evaluating your 
advisors are

 Chapter 17: Ten Top Mistakes Made by Online Investors
✓
✓Use online broker screening tools. You want to meticulously check 
to make sure that the person giving you advice has the right licenses. 
Chapter 4 contains some online ways to check out your broker. You want 
to make sure that you use the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s 
BrokerCheck (www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/
BrokerCheck/index.htm). Just enter the name of the broker you’re 
checking on into the search box and follow the directions. I give you 
additional tips on how to avoid scams in Chapter 18.
✓
✓Track the advisor’s performance. You might not be making the calls 
in your portfolio, but you still want to make sure that your advisor is 
getting you adequate returns for the risk you’re taking. That also goes 
for any stock‐picking newsletters or websites that promise to make you 
fabulously rich. Use the tools and techniques in Chapter 8 to make sure 
that you’re getting what you’re paying for.
Trying to Make Too Much  
Money Too Quickly
The reason you invest is to make money. That’s the American way. But as an 
investor, you need to appreciate that wealth is built over time as companies 
you’ve invested in expand their revenue and earnings. Generally speaking, 
stocks have returned about 10 percent a year. You may be able to boost that 
10 percent a bit with smart asset allocation and exposure to riskier types of 
stocks like emerging markets and small companies.
Some investors, though, just aren’t satisfied with that. They chase after 
brand‐new IPOs, pile into stocks that have been the market’s leaders, and 
load up on penny stocks. These investors are typically the ones who get 
sucked into “get rich quick” emails, stock conferences, and other dubious 
stock promotion schemes that make only their promoters rich.
Sometimes things work out okay for these speculators, and they might buy 
shares of the right stock at the right time. But more often than not, these 
speculators suffer as the stocks whip around more than they expected. The 
volatility proves too much to bear, and the speculators buy and sell stocks 
at the wrong times. Before they know it, speculators are down 50 percent or 
more and then write to me on my online column asking what to do.
I suppose that if you limit your outlay in speculative investments to a small 
amount, there’s no harm. But for the bulk of your portfolio, you’ll find much 
better success over the long term if you read Chapters 8 and 9 and find out 
how to track your risk and return.

366
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Letting Emotions Take Over
It’s happened to you before: You’ve fallen in love. No, I’m not talking about 
your spouse or significant other. I’m talking about your favorite stock. 
Everyone has had one. The stock you fall in love with is the one that you hap-
pened to buy at just the right time and have never lost money on. It might be 
the one that soars and always shows up on the “Top Performers” lists printed 
by magazines and websites. It’s easy to be proud of a stock just like parents 
who see their kid’s name in the paper for being on the honor roll.
The opposite happens, too. Say your asset allocation calls for you to own 
large‐company stocks, you invest in them, and they do nothing. There you 
are; you own shares of big companies and watch your portfolio go sideways 
while your friends brag about the tiny upstarts and penny stocks they make a 
fortune on.
Periods of self‐doubt and second‐guessing account for many investors’  
worst decisions. These investors might be so blinded by their enduring 
affection for a stock that they proudly ride it down lower and lower. It’s 
funny, but the love for the stock wears pretty thin by the time the stock is 
down 50 percent or more. What’s the answer to this? Unless you’re a robot 
or computer, you’re stuck with your emotions. But you can stop these 
­emotions from meddling with your portfolio by sticking with your asset 
­allocation plan. Yes, I know this asset allocation stuff is getting repetitive, 
but trust me: It will protect you from yourself.
Emotions can burn you badly with investments that just keep going down. It’s 
easy to get so fed up with certain stocks you can’t bear to keep buying more. 
You curse at your asset allocation for ruining your portfolio. You might get 
so disgusted with stocks you either inquire about CDs from your local bank 
or start scanning the “new high” lists for stocks you think will be your ticket 
to riches.
If you let your greed for huge returns and fear of losses run your investment 
decisions, you can practically guarantee you’ll buy and sell at the wrong time.
If you find that you’re an emotional investor and take the market’s move-
ments too close to heart, you’re probably a good candidate to invest in pas-
sive index mutual funds and ETFs. You can just buy these investments and let 
them ride, removing the temptation to tinker with your portfolio and almost 
guaranteeing you better results.

Looking to Blame Someone  
Else for Your Losses
No one likes to lose money on stocks. And everyone loses money on stocks 
from time to time. It’s how you react to the losses that makes the difference. 
Some investors go on a witch‐hunt and start trying to track down anyone who 
might have mentioned a stock as a good buy, ranging from publications and 
websites to friends or the company’s executives. These investors are gener-
ally the first in line to join securities class‐action lawsuits and try to sue the 
company or executives.
Certainly cases of fraud exist, in the mold of Enron and Worldcom. These 
cases are regrettable because even investors who attempted to do their 
homework by studying the company’s financials were misled. But if you just 
lose money because you bought a stock at the wrong time or overestimated 
the company’s profit potential, you can only look to yourself. It’s best to ana-
lyze what you did right, what you did wrong, and learn from it as opposed to 
playing an unproductive blame game.
Sometimes investors truly are wronged by companies’ managements. In 
those cases, securities class‐action lawsuits attempt to extract money for 
the shareholders. You can find out whether shareholders are suing a com-
pany by using Stanford Law School’s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse 
(http://securities.stanford.edu). If there’s a suit, you generally 
must fill out a claim form. You can obtain the claim form from the law firm 
assigned to handle the case by the court. You can get the name and con-
tact information of the law firm in charge using the Stanford Law School’s 
Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.
Ignoring Tax Considerations
Come tax time, each April, it’s amazing the lengths that taxpayers go to cut 
their tax bill by just a few bucks. Some go as far as to get married or have a 
child to pay less tax to Uncle Sam. But many of these same investors ignore 
or aren’t aware of ways of investing that can save them thousands on taxes.

368
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Uncle Sam offers extremely generous tax breaks for investors, if you just 
know how to take advantage of them. Tax breaks investors should never pass 
up on include
✓
✓Lower tax rates for long‐term capital gains: If you can wait more than 
a year before selling winning stocks, you’ll be much further ahead than 
investors who trade with no regard to taxes. By holding onto stocks 
for longer than a year, you usually qualify for long‐term capital gains 
taxes, which in many cases are half what you pay if you sell stocks in a 
year or less.
✓
✓Major tax breaks on education savings: If you’re trying to save for your 
child’s college, you can let Uncle Sam help out. Special education sav-
ings accounts, such as the 529 plan, let you largely shield your money 
from taxes as long as it’s used to pay for school.
Say you need to save $50,000 to pay for your kid’s college education. If 
you ignore the tax breaks available to you through educational savings 
plans like 529s, you might actually need to save $58,824. You’ll need the 
extra $8,824 to pay the 15 percent long‐term capital gains tax that might 
apply.
✓
✓Major tax breaks on retirement savings: Always take advantage of any 
retirement savings tax breaks you can get. Researching what’s available 
to you should be the first thing you do when you start to invest. If your 
company matches contributions to a 401(k) or other profit‐sharing plan, 
take advantage of it as soon as you can. If you have no such plan at your 
job, don’t assume that nothing is available to you. Many taxpayers are 
entitled to invest in a Roth IRA, which offers tremendous tax benefits, as 
I describe in Chapter 3.
Dwelling on Mistakes Too Long
It might sound funny to tell you to not think about investing mistakes in a 
chapter dedicated to mistakes, but it’s important to not let a mistake in the 
past paralyze you. So, you bought a stock and rode it down too long before 
selling it. Don’t linger on the mistake. Just don’t do it again, and over time, 
you’ll obtain the success in investing you’re shooting for.

romising a big return to investors is kind of like waving red meat in 
front of a salivating tiger. Even educated investors can’t help but sali-
vate when offered what seems to be a plausible chance at winning big‐time 
returns. Investors’ innate craving for that big score makes them easy targets 
for less‐than‐honest financial snake oil salesmen.
It’s always been amazing to me how people are so careful about their money 
in everyday life but let their guard down when it comes to investing. The 
same people who clip coupons and shop at discount stores to save a few 
bucks will readily hand over their life’s savings to a stranger with dubious 
qualifications selling questionable investments.
It’s up to you to do your homework when checking into any investments. 
Online tools make it easier than ever to sniff out unscrupulous people hawk-
ing investment products. Unfortunately, though, the Internet is also a boon 
for the bad guys. Email lets fraudsters reach millions of users with the click 
of a button. Fraudsters can also glean basic information about you online, 
perhaps from your blog or Facebook page, and craft a pitch that seems more 
realistic and personable. Keeping these things in mind, this chapter points 
out some of the main types of investments frauds and shows you how to 
dodge them.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Beware of Pyramid Schemes
When it comes to investment frauds, pyramid schemes are among the greatest 
hits. Organizers behind pyramid schemes try to convince investors to con-
tribute money and tempt them with promises of a giant payout. That sounds 
like playing the lottery, I know. But what makes pyramid schemes so insidi-
ous is that they’re based on a sham that eventually collapses.
Generally, pyramid schemes work like this: Six fraudsters send out emails 
to as many people as they can, each hoping to get six additional “investors.” 
These initial promoters convince investors to sign up by telling them that if 
they contribute money, they’ll get a 100 percent or greater return in just  
90 days. If the six initial promoters are successful in lining up other partici-
pants, they pocket the money from the new investors. But that’s just the 
tip of the pyramid, so to speak. The 36 just‐recruited investors are then 
instructed to get six more investors each, which brings the total number of 
investors in the scheme to 216. The scheme then continues, and each time 
more investors are brought in, the previous investors get their payout.
There’s just one big problem: The pyramid collapses under its own weight. 
After 13 rounds of this pyramid scheme, for instance, more than 13 billion 
people are required to keep it going. That’s impossible because it exceeds 
the world’s population. So unless you think you can find six suckers on Mars 
or Jupiter to buy your stake of a pyramid scheme, you could end up losing 
your investment. The Securities and Exchange Commission provides helpful 
information on pyramid schemes at www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm.
Pyramid schemes have a close relative: multilevel marketing plans. In a 
­multilevel marketing plan, a company emails you with an offer to make you a 
distributor of its products — usually pills or medical devices — that ­promise 
miraculous benefits. These plans not only promise to pay ­commissions 
if you’re able to sell the products, but also pay you if you find other 
­distributors. The problem is that these are often based on pyramid schemes. 
You should also always run a company through the Better Business Bureau’s 
website (www.bbb.org) to make sure that it’s legitimate.
Just because a company is in the BBB database and doesn’t have any 
­complaints, that doesn’t mean it’s safe. The company could be new and 
­looking for fresh victims. The BBB site, though, is a good place to start. It’s 
a good idea to also run the owners’ names through the SEC’s website (www.
sec.gov) to see whether there have been any prior run‐ins with regulators.
Steer Clear of Ponzi Schemes
Ponzi schemes are some of the oldest frauds in the book. But they’ve also 
enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance in the wake of the financial crisis that 

371

 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online
erupted in 2007 and 2008. The Bernard Madoff scheme, which defrauded 
investors of more than $60 billion, was discovered in late 2008 and is consid-
ered the biggest Ponzi scheme ever. The scheme was so complicated some 
people involved in running it were still facing sentencing in 2015. Regulators 
discovered another massive Ponzi scheme in 2009 headed by Texan Allen 
Stanford, accused of operating a more than $7 billion fraud.
Ponzi schemes are a type of pyramid scheme with one key difference: All the 
“investors’” money goes to one person — the organizer of the fraud.
Ponzi schemes are pretty simple. The organizer sends out emails or pitches 
investors in other ways offering fabulous returns, often in a very short period 
of time. In Madoff’s case, it wasn’t so much a get‐rich‐quick pitch, but rather 
an unbelievably steady return of 10 percent a year. If you remember, while 
stocks have returned 10 percent a year over time, those returns are not guar-
anteed and come with a great deal of risk and volatility. After the initial inves-
tors eagerly sign up, the Ponzi promoter takes a cut and then seeks a second 
round of investors. When the money comes in from the second round of 
investors, the Ponzi operator takes another cut but also returns a slice of the 
money to the first round of investors. Clearly, the first investors are ecstatic 
and eager to tell others about their great investment. Those testimonials play 
right into the Ponzi operator’s hand, who keeps repeating the process until it 
falls apart.
Although Ponzi schemes are classic scams, investors seem to keep falling 
for them. Just in 2013 and 2014, 137 Ponzi schemes were uncovered, accord-
ing to Ponzi tracking site www.ponzitracker.com. More than $1.5 billion 
was potentially lost from these schemes in 2014. It’s a shame investors keep 
getting sucked in by these frauds. To inform yourself of how common Ponzi 
schemes are, you owe it to yourself to read the SEC’s summary of recent 
enforcement actions against them here: www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf‐
actions‐ponzi.shtml. And if you want to learn of some of the signs inves-
tors should look for to avoid Ponzi schemes, the SEC has a primer here: www.
sec.gov/answers/ponzi.htm.
Avoid Tout Sheets and Know Whom 
You’re Taking Advice From
You find no shortage of investment and stock‐picking newsletters that claim 
to have the inside track on the stocks you need to buy now. But some of 
these newsletters, known in the trade as tout sheets, have nefarious inten-
tions. Tout sheets are investment newsletters or websites distributed for the 
sole purpose of hyping stocks with exaggerated or false information to stir up 
investors’ interest. Tout sheets have proliferated due to the Internet, which 
makes distributing and promoting such things a cinch. (You can read more 
about investment newsletters in general in Chapter 15.)

372
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Above all, you need to be perfectly sure that an online newsletter, blog, or 
website is above board. Whenever considering subscribing to a newsletter 
or following its suggestions, you want to be 100 percent clear on whether 
the newsletter writer is paid by the companies to be a tout. Touts are hired 
by companies or shady brokerage firms to stoke interest in stocks by put-
ting out glowing reports on the company based on exaggeration or lies. If 
the tout is successful in attracting investors and driving up the stock price, 
the company’s executives and brokerage firm can then sell and pocket the 
quick profit.
The SEC is somewhat restricted in its ability to crack down on newsletters. 
The First Amendment allows anyone to make statements, including about 
stocks. The SEC can get involved, though, when the newsletter writers are 
paid for issuing misleading statements about a stock for personal gain.
The SEC (www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud/newsletter.
htm) warns investors to be especially skeptical of online newsletters that 
vaguely say how they’re paid. A statement like “From time to time, XYZ 
Newsletter may receive compensation from companies we write about” is 
a huge red flag, says the SEC. You should also avoid newsletters that say 
they’re paid to promote stocks in tiny or hidden places in the newsletter.
Check up on newsletters, or any other stock promoter, for that matter, by 
searching the following sites:
✓
✓The SEC’s Division of Enforcement page (www.sec.gov/divisions/
enforce.shtml) is a great site for all things fraudulent. You can click 
the Enforcement Actions link to see whether the newsletter you’re 
­looking at has been accused of wrongdoing by the SEC.
✓
✓The SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure page (www. 
adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/IapdMain/iapd_SiteMap.
aspx) is an excellent way to check up on “investment advisers.” Many, 
but not all, professionals who dispense advice to investors are required 
to file Form ADV with the SEC. The Form ADV contains information 
about the adviser or advisory firm, including any disciplinary actions. 
To access the site, just click the Investment Adviser Search link on the 
left side and follow the directions.
✓
✓The North American Securities Administrators Association (www.
nasaa.org/about‐us/contact‐us/contact‐your‐regulator) 
provides helpful information about securities crackdowns in various 
states. Just click your state in the list, and the site directs you to the 
appropriate state regulators that punish securities fraudsters.
✓

Don’t Fall for Investment Spam Emails
Open your email box, and you’re likely to find all sorts of offers. You’ll see 
pitches from alleged Nigerian millionaires who need your help, ways to get 
Microsoft to write you a giant check, and hot tips on stocks about to take off.
Generally these spam emails, or unsolicited promotional email messages, 
are all very similar. The emails masquerade as legitimate reports from stock 
research firms or investors who are in the know and are simply passing along 
their tips out of generosity. The messages talk about some major develop-
ment that will move the stock by a huge amount in a short period of time. 
And the emails generally pitch stocks with very low share prices that trade 
on lesser regulated markets, like the Pink Sheets.
If you get such spam, don’t even read it. Trash that rotten spam immediately. 
They’re almost always pump‐and‐dump schemes. They work like this: The 
fraudsters first pick a few lightly traded stocks and buy them up. After the 
promotional email goes out, the fraudsters wait for gullible investors to buy 
shares and drive the stock price up. That’s the pump part of pump and dump. 
Next, these investors sell their shares. That’s the dump.
Sadly, many investors fall for these schemes. A study from Rainer Bohme 
(Dresden University of Technology) and Thorsten Holz (University of 
Mannheim) found stock prices do react to these emails, indicating that 
investors are reading them and buying the stocks. (You can check out their 
research at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_
id=897431.)
Don’t fall for the emails from supposed Nigerian nationals hoping to transfer 
cash to the United States, either. They’re scams called advance fee frauds, or 
4‐1‐9 frauds after that section of the Nigerian penal code. Don’t participate in 
these. The U.S. Secret Service (www.secretservice.gov/about/faqs/) 
provides information on these scams, if you’re interested.
Understand Loopholes  
Scammers Can Use
Before you invest your money in anything, your first stop should be the SEC’s 
website at www.sec.gov. You should always find out whether any regulatory 
filings exist on the investment or person selling the investments.
If you’re looking to buy a stock, for instance, you can download the com-
pany’s regulatory filings, as I explain in Chapter 2. Companies with more than 
500 investors and $10 million in assets must file statements with the SEC. 

374
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Companies listed on major exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange 
and NASDAQ, must also file statements. If it’s a broker or an investment 
newsletter you’re interested in checking up on, you can follow the instruc-
tions in the section that tells you how to research tout sheets.
If you’re not able to turn up any filings, your defenses should go up. 
Scamsters know that loopholes exist in SEC rules — originally designed to 
help small companies avoid bureaucratic red tape — that allow them to 
avoid filing potentially troublesome documents. You can read about these 
loopholes on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/qasbsec.
htm) in the section entitled “Can my company legally offer and sell securities 
without registering with the SEC?”
But to save you the trouble, following are summaries of the primary loop-
holes that may allow certain firms to avoid filing documents with the SEC:
✓
✓Intrastate offerings occur when a local business sells investments to 
residents of the state it primarily does business in. This is called the 
intrastate offering exemption.
✓
✓Private offerings take place when companies only sell investments to 
investors who have a deep understanding of business and also provide 
financial information to these investors.
✓
✓Regulation A is an SEC exemption that kicks in when firms raise less 
than $5 million in a 12‐month period. Regulation A allows companies 
to file paper statements called offering circulars with the SEC instead 
of making their information readily available online. Offering circulars 
contain limited information and can be hard to get because they’re often 
filed only on paper in Washington, D.C.
✓
✓Regulation D is a more common SEC exemption that applies to firms 
that meet a variety of requirements, including raising less than $1 million 
in a 12‐month period or selling investments only to “accredited inves-
tors” who are very sophisticated. These firms need to file only a Form D 
with the SEC. A Form D offers just bare‐bones information and provides 
few details other than the names of the company’s owners. You can read 
more about Regulation D at www.sec.gov/answers/regd.htm.
If you can’t find a company on the SEC’s website, call or email the SEC (www.
sec.gov/contact.shtml) to see whether paper forms are available. You 
should also contact your state’s regulator, which you can find from the North 
American Securities Administrators Association (www.nasaa.org).
There are thousands of legitimate companies with shares trading on the 
major U.S. exchanges. If you want to invest in an individual stock, choose 
from one of these listed stocks.

Familiarize Yourself with the 
Fingerprints of a Scam
There are only so many ways to rob a bank. Face it; most of the scams that 
fraudsters use online and off generally fall into just a few categories, most of 
which are variants of pyramid or Ponzi schemes. Sure, you find twists, such 
as affinity frauds (www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/affinity.htm), where 
the scammers infiltrate a group of investors of a similar age, race, or hobby; 
gain the trust of the group; and then use the group members to promote the 
scheme to each other.
Still, a few common traits should set off alarm bells in your head:
✓
✓Promises of guaranteed returns that seem abnormally large: By read-
ing Chapter 1, you know that stocks have returned roughly 10 percent 
average annual returns. If someone tells you he can get you a return 
of 10 percent or more a year, you know the investment is riskier than 
stocks. So if the promoter says the returns are guaranteed or risk‐free, 
you know something isn’t right.
✓
✓Pressure to act right now: Perpetrators of frauds know they have to get 
your checkbook open now, or you might get cold feet and start thinking 
about the risks. If you’re told you have to invest now or you’ll miss out, 
you’re better missing out on the “opportunity.”
✓
✓No documentation on paper: Bad guys hate paper trails and try their 
best to avoid documenting anything. If you can’t print out the informa-
tion about an investment, you shouldn’t invest in it. Proper investment 
proposals should be registered with regulators and come with a pro-
spectus, an annual report, and other financial statements.
The SEC provides a list of other telltale signs of online frauds (www.sec.
gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud/signs.htm) that are worthwhile 
checking out.
Learn to Be an Online Sleuth
Scammers often reinvent themselves and try different scams until they get 
caught. If you’re being pitched an investment or seminar, try to find out 
whether the person is working under an alias or has sold investments before. 
Get as much information as you can about the person, and use the web 
search techniques described in Chapter 2 to see whether you can turn up 
more information.

376
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
It’s also important to find out whether a regulator or private party has 
gone after a company or broker to recover funds. You have three main 
places to check:
✓
✓The SEC’s Investors Claims Funds (www.sec.gov/divisions/
enforce/claims.htm) is a list of all the companies that have been 
­targeted by enforcement actions that resulted in funds being given back 
to investors.
✓
✓The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (www.sipc.org/
cases‐and‐claims/open‐cases) maintains a list of brokers that 
have gone out of business and are being liquidated. You also find 
instructions on how to fill out a claim form to make sure that you get 
your money back.
✓
✓The Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse 
(http://securities.stanford.edu) provides a free database of 
companies that are being sued by investors for securities fraud.
Know How to Complain If  
You Suspect a Fraud
It might be embarrassing if you’ve been taken in by a fraud. But if you feel 
that you’ve been had, it’s critical that you let regulators know right away. The 
sooner you can tip off the authorities, the greater the chance the fraudster 
can be nailed and the better the chance of recovering money.
The SEC’s Center for Complaints and Enforcement Tips (www.sec.gov/ 
complaint.shtml) allows you to fill out electronic forms to alert regulators 
to a possible fraud. Give as much detail about the alleged fraud as you can to 
help investigators who might decide to take your case.
Make Sure That Your Computer  
Is Locked Down
You should always be concerned with computer security. Make sure that 
you have the proper software and other safeguards installed to protect your 
computer from viruses and hackers. You have many options, including some 
offered by the online brokers themselves. When you’re online using a public 
wireless network service, such as those in Starbucks coffeehouses, you 
should be especially careful. You can read more about ways to lock down 
your computer in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Protect Your Investments and Identity Online
But online criminals also use other low‐tech methods to bilk investors. The 
most common trick used is phishing, which is pronounced fishing. In phish-
ing scams, the fraudster sends out millions of emails purporting to be from 
a bank (say Citibank), a store (like Best Buy), a government agency (say the 
Internal Revenue Service), or an online service (like PayPal or eBay). These 
emails are carefully crafted to appear official and generally ask the recipients 
to click a link to confirm or update personal information.
Here are a couple ways to protect yourself from these scams:
✓
✓Log on routinely: Log on to your bank, online broker, PayPal, and other 
important accounts directly, and routinely check the Messages section. 
Generally, when these companies want to reach you, they leave a mes-
sage for you on the site.
✓
✓Never click links in emails: If you get an email claiming to be from your 
online brokerage, assume that it’s a fraud. Don’t click the link in the 
email that claims to direct you to the website. Instead, manually enter 
the site’s address into your browser or click the Favorite for the site that 
you set up.
✓
✓Hover your cursor over the link: If you want to know whether the email 
is phishing for information, put your cursor over the link in the email. Do 
not click the link, but look in the lower‐left corner of the screen. You see 
the address the link wants to take you to. If it’s not the complete address 
of the site it purports to be, you know instantly it’s a fraud.
Be Aware of Online Sources  
for More Information
Scams are constantly evolving. It’s up to you to be constantly vigilant and be 
aware that the Internet is a perfect environment for people trying to fool you 
and take your money. That doesn’t mean you should unplug your computer 
and give up on online investing. It’s just that it’s up to you to be aware of the 
potential risks.
Internet sources can help online investors understand how to protect them-
selves, including
✓
✓The SEC’s website (www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/cyberfraud.
htm) explains many of the common online investing frauds and 
gives detailed examples. If you’re new to online investing, this site is 
very worthwhile and can make you more street‐smart and aware of 
the dangers.

378

✓Investor Protection Trust (www.investorprotection.org) ­provides 
links to a variety of investor education materials. You can view a 
number of videos that show you how to recognize and avoid common 
­investment scams at www.investorprotection.org.
The case(s) of Barry Minkow
When it comes to money, you need to be on 
guard at all times. Scammers often use the 
trust they’ve built up to get them in a position 
to abuse, cheat, and steal. Consider the case 
of Barry Minkow, who not just once, but twice, 
abused his reputation to allegedly generate 
ill‐gotten gains. Minkow first became known 
as a fraudster for being the mastermind behind 
the Zzzz Best “carpet‐cleaning” business that 
bilked investors out of millions in the 1980s. After 
being released from prison in 1995, Minkow 
become a Christian minister. He also, ironically, 
started a business called the Fraud Discovery 
Institute, where he would serve up warnings 
of potential corporate frauds. However, on  
March 30, 2011, Minkow pleaded guilty to 
charges in connection with insider trad-
ing. Minkow allegedly trumped up claims of 
accounting problems at homebuilder Lennar, 
only to profit by betting against the stock. 
Minkow in 2011 was sentenced to five years in 
prison. But then in 2014, he was sentenced to 
another five years of jail time connected with 
his swindling of members of his church. All told, 
Minkow is ordered to pay hundreds of millions of 
dollars in restitution. You can read the complaint 
filed against Minkow in connection with Fraud 
Discovery Institute here: www.justice.

Online Investors’ Ten Most 
Common Questions
In This Chapter
▶
▶Discovering answers to burning online investing questions
▶
▶Incorporating options and commodities trading in your portfolio
I
 
f you’re new to online investing, your mind might be overflowing with 
questions before you ever click the Buy or Sell button on your online 
brokerage’s website. And even if you’re an experienced investor, you might 
question whether you’re doing everything you can to maximize your success 
and profit.
Hopefully, by the time you finish reading this chapter, those pesky questions 
lingering in the back of your head will be answered. I have a pretty good idea 
of the questions online investors have because thousands of readers e‐mail 
me to ask everything they want to know about investing. By answering those 
questions in my Ask Matt column at USATODAY.com, I’ve noticed some of 
the same questions keep popping up. The most common question from inves-
tors by far is “How much money do I need, and how do I get started investing 
online?” You can find the answer to that number one question in Chapter 1. 
This chapter tackles many of the other burning questions you might have.
How Do I Find Out Which Companies  
Are Going to “Split” Their Stock?
It’s almost like clockwork. Shortly after beginning investors get started 
investing online, they start wondering about stock splits. Stock splits are 
appealing to investors interested in buying a stock because they bring the 
per‐share price down. And beginning investors who own shares already like 
splits because they get more shares overnight.

380
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can read about stock splits and why companies do them in Chapter 6. 
The short version is that many companies perform stock splits when their 
per‐share stock price gets high enough to presumably scare off individual 
investors. Some companies might start thinking about splits when their stock 
gets to $75 a share or higher. When that happens, the company cuts its stock 
price but then increases its number of shares outstanding.
Savvy investors understand that a stock’s per‐share price, by itself, is mean-
ingless. What matters is a company’s valuation, which you can find out by 
using the tools and techniques explained in Chapter 12.
Still, I get the question often enough that I’m happy to answer it. NASDAQ.
com (www.nasdaq.com) is a convenient source for a calendar of upcoming 
stock splits. To get the information, after logging on to the NASDAQ site, you 
need to hover your mouse over the Markets tab and then choose upcoming 
splits. Click that link. You see a list of all the companies expected to do a 
stock split, the ratio of the split (such as two‐for‐one), and the date it’s set to 
happen. You can find this list directly here: www.nasdaq.com/markets/
upcoming‐splits.aspx.
Can I Use Options to Boost My Returns?
Options, which are contracts that give owners the right to buy or sell stocks 
by a certain time in the future, can be used aggressively or conservatively. 
Options can be used by speculators to place giant bets on stocks with very 
little up‐front money, as I describe in Chapter 5. However, if used properly, 
options can add some extra return to your portfolio without necessarily 
increasing your risk too much.
Selling covered calls is a great example of how you can boost your returns 
without significantly increasing your risk. When you sell a call for a stock that 
you already own, it’s a covered call. When you sell a covered call, you collect 
a fee, or premium, from the buyer of the call. The person who buys your call 
has the right to force you to sell the stock to him or her at a set price, called 
the exercise price, before a set date in the future. If the stock never goes 
above the exercise price, though, you keep the stock and the premium. It’s 
like money for nothing. Covered calls can be lucrative if the stock you own 
doesn’t move much.
Selling a call without owning the stock is very risky. If the stock rises, you’re 
required to buy it and sell it to the person who bought your call. If the stock 
soars, you keep losing money.

 Chapter 19: Online Investors’ Ten Most Common Questions
Can I Still Lose Money If  
I Invest in Bonds?
Investors who are nervous about market swings are often told to load up 
on bonds and lighten up on stocks. There’s logic to that because bonds and 
Treasurys, in particular, tend to swing less severely in value than stocks. 
You can see how the risks of different types of bonds compare with stocks in 
Chapter 15.
But don’t think you can’t lose money on bonds, because you still can. Bonds 
have three main types of risk:
✓
✓Default risk: When you buy bonds issued by companies, cities, or 
­borrowers other than the U.S. Treasury, you’re accepting the chance 
that the borrower won’t pay you back.
✓
✓Inflation risk: You own a bond from a well‐known company that pays  
6 percent interest, inflation is just 3 percent, and Treasurys are paying  
5 percent. You’re pretty happy. But what if inflation ticks up, and the 
yield on Treasurys rises to 8 percent? Suddenly your 6 percent isn’t 
looking so hot. The price of your bond will fall to make up for the fact 
that the 6 percent interest rate isn’t competitive.
✓
✓Reinvestment risk: You buy an 8 percent bond, the company pays 
the interest on time, and everything is going great. But then, the bond 
matures. The company returns your principal, and you have a pile of 
cash again. Now what? You must reinvest that cash in another way, 
­perhaps by buying a bond that has a lower interest rate.
Because bonds have risk, they might not be appropriate places to park  
cash you might need in case of emergency. Money market funds, described 
in Chapter 15, can be much safer. You might also consider high‐yield  
savings accounts that can give you ready access to your cash and pay 
decent rates of return. Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/
mmmf_highratehome.asp?params=US,416&product=33) offers a great 
way to find high‐yield savings accounts to park cash in.
It doesn’t pay to be overly conservative either and put all your cash in money 
market funds. Returns on stocks and bonds, over time, will likely far outstrip 
the interest you’ll collect on money markets or high‐yield savings accounts. 
If you play it too safe, you might find that your portfolio isn’t growing fast 
enough to meet your financial goals.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
What’s the Easiest Way to  
Invest in Commodities?
Investing in commodities can be another way to diversify your portfolio. 
Investors who may fear inflation in the wake of economic stimulus packages 
put in place by the U.S. government, say, may see commodities as a way to 
protect themselves if prices skyrocket in the future. Whether commodities 
add value is a topic of debate. Supporters say commodities tend to move 
­differently than stocks, which can help lower your portfolio’s risk. You can 
read more about this in the freely available academic research paper “Facts 
and Fantasies about Commodity Futures,” by Yale University’s K. Geert  
Rouwenhorst and University of Pennsylvania’s Gary Gorton (http://
papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=560042). Another 
look at the topic is available in a paper published in the Journal of Asset 
Management titled “Investing in commodities: Popular beliefs and misconcep-
tions,” available here: www.palgrave‐journals.com/jam/journal/v13/
n2/abs/jam201135a.html.
Investing directly in commodities, such as livestock, grains, metals, and 
energy, can be messy. You need to understand the futures market, which is 
where these investments trade, and set up a separate brokerage account just 
to buy and sell commodities.
You can find much easier ways to invest in commodities. Guggenheim 
Investments (guggenheiminvestments.com/products/mutual‐funds/
product‐list#Alternative) offers several mutual funds that invest in 
broad baskets of commodities. You can also find exchange‐traded funds 
(ETFs) that let you invest in commodities like gold, steel, and energy. You 
can just buy these ETFs much like you’d buy a stock. You can read more 
about mutual funds in Chapter 10 and ETFs in Chapter 11.
How Long Will It Take for Me to  
Double My Money?
There’s something satisfying about hitting “a double.” When you hit a 
Blackjack in Vegas, for instance, you double your wager. And who doesn’t 
like a good double‐header or double feature? Even the percentage gain on an 
investment that doubles is a nice even 100 percent.

383

 Chapter 19: Online Investors’ Ten Most Common Questions
A popular shortcut is used by many money pros to measure the time it will 
take to double an investment: It’s called the Rule of 72. You simply divide the 
number 72 by the rate of return of your investment. MoneyChimp (www. 
moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm) provides more details on this 
rule and can do the math for you.
Say you own a basket of stocks that you expect to increase in value by  
10 percent a year. Using the Rule of 72, you’ll double your investment in  
7.2 years (72 divided by 10).
Do I Have a Say in How a Company  
I’m Invested in Operates?
As a shareholder, you’re one of the owners of a company. And yes, that enti-
tles you to a say in the important elements of a company’s affairs. Generally 
speaking, the pecking order goes like this: The company’s board of directors 
hires professional managers to run the company on a day‐to‐day basis. These 
hired hands — the CEO, chief financial officer, and other key management — 
answer to the board of directors. The board of directors, in turn, answers to 
the shareholders.
Major issues, such as whether a company accepts an offer to be acquired, 
must be approved by shareholders. Shareholders also have the right to vote 
for the members of the board. All the items you can vote on are printed on a 
company’s proxy statement. Proxy statements will be mailed to you by your 
online broker or sent to you electronically. You can also vote online because 
most companies use Internet‐based voting systems such as ProxyVote 
(http://east.proxyvote.com/pv/web.do). All you need to vote is 
the Control Number of the proxy, which will be provided to you by your 
online broker.
Unless you’re willing to spend a great deal of time researching all the mat-
ters on the proxy, you might not be sure how to vote. It’s important, though, 
to vote because it’s your only say in the company’s matters. Professional 
investors get a big hand when it comes to evaluating all the items up for a 
vote in the proxy. A company called Institutional Shareholder Services (www.
issgovernance.com) provides research and data to mutual funds, pension 
funds, and other large owners of stock. But those reports aren’t available to 
individual investors. That means you need to take the time to read the proxy 
statement and understand what investors are being asked to vote on. It’s not 
as hard as it sounds. You just need a copy of the proxy statement. Brokers 
may mail these documents to you, or more likely, e‐mail a link for you to view 

384
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
them online. Proxy statements can also be downloaded from the Securities 
and Exchange Commission’s website. Review Chapter 2 for help on how to 
get a proxy statement from the SEC.
Once you have the proxy statement in front of you, check the section of the 
report usually called Management Proposals. These are the items the com-
pany’s management must get shareholders to vote for or against. The proxy 
statement spells out each proposal and provides some background to help 
you make a decision. You can also consult with other investors, using social 
media tools described in Chapter 7.
How Can Deep‐Discount Online  
Brokers Make Money Charging  
$5 or Less for Trades?
Don’t feel too bad for the online brokers. Although commissions have fallen 
through the floor and are free in some cases, as described in Chapter 4, bro-
kers are doing fine. Keep in mind that the costs to execute trades have also 
fallen. It generally costs online brokers between $2 and $6.50 to execute a 
trade. Larger brokers usually pay closer to $2, meaning that a vast majority of 
online brokers are able to make money from the commissions they charge.
Online brokers also make money on additional services. Some brokers charge 
interest to investors who borrow money to buy stocks or other investments. 
Other brokers make money charging higher fees for more exotic investments, 
such as options, foreign stocks, and currencies. It’s also fairly common for 
online brokers to sell some of their customers’ orders to other investment 
firms that execute the trades. Some larger brokerage firms also make money 
selling investing advice. Brokers with free trades generally rely on these addi-
tional services to pay for the $2 or so they’re losing on regular trades.
How Are Hedge Funds, Private‐Equity 
Funds, and Venture Capital  
Funds Different?
Ever hear the term alternative investment? It’s a blanket term used to describe 
most investments other than just plain old stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. 
Stamp, art, and car collecting, when done with the intent of making money, 
are technically alternative investments. But typically, when you hear the term 

385

 Chapter 19: Online Investors’ Ten Most Common Questions
alternative investment, what’s being referred to are hedge funds, private‐
equity funds, and venture‐capital funds. Here’s a rundown of what they are:
✓
✓Hedge funds: These are pools of money collected by largely unregulated 
investment managers who aim to get returns that beat the stock market. 
Unlike mutual fund managers who generally invest in stocks and bonds, 
hedge fund managers are free to invest in just about any asset they 
choose. This freedom invest with little regulatory oversight is supposed 
to let hedge funds make money even when stocks are falling.
Due to their structures, though, hedge funds aren’t held to the same reg-
ulatory scrutiny that other investments are. Rules require hedge funds 
to be offered only to “accredited investors” who have an annual income 
of $200,000 or more, or $1 million in net worth. Hedge funds also charge 
very hefty fees, making them largely unattractive to individual investors.
✓
✓Private‐equity funds: Leveraged‐buyout firms use money from large 
investors like pension plans to buy public and private companies. 
These firms, also called private‐equity firms, generally borrow money 
so that they can afford to buy big companies. Investment funds run by 
private‐equity firms usually have a different strategy than hedge funds 
do. Private‐equity firms generally try to run the companies they bought 
for a short time, fix them, and sell them for a profit. Private‐equity firms 
generally have a stable of experienced businesspeople they can call in to 
run companies.
✓
✓Venture capital: If you’ve ever wondered how young companies can 
afford to launch new high‐tech products, it’s probably thanks to venture 
capital firms. These firms make relatively small investments in scores 
of highly risky and immature companies. Most of the investments go up 
in smoke as the fledgling companies fail to get off the ground. But when 
venture capital firms hit a Facebook or Twitter, they can make big bucks. 
Chapter 6 gives more details about venture capital.
If a Company Is Buying Back Its Stock, 
Does That Mean the Stock Is Cheap?
Some investors think it’s the ultimate “buy” recommendation when a 
­company says it’s planning to buy back its own stock. Stocks often rise 
after a company tells Wall Street it’s launching a stock‐buyback program. 
After all, who better to know whether the stock is undervalued than the 
­company itself?
But investors should be skeptical of buybacks. For one thing, just because a 
company says it will buy back stock doesn’t mean it will. Academic studies 
show about a third of companies that say they will buy back stock never do.

386
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Companies have had lousy timing when it comes to buying their own stock. 
Stock buybacks were soaring in the quarter that ended in March 2000 and in 
late 2007, just as the stock market was topping and about to suffer a nasty 
bear market. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2002 and in early 2009, when 
the stock market was hitting rock bottom, companies were shying away 
from buybacks.
I Own a House. Do I Need to Hold  
Real‐Estate Investment Trusts  
in My Stock Portfolio, Too?
It’s easy to confuse real‐estate investment trusts, or REITs, with housing. But 
your home and an investment in REITs are very different. First of all, REITs 
largely invest in commercial real estate, such as office buildings, shopping 
centers, hospitals, and malls — not single‐family homes.
Another thing to remember is that your home, although it can appreciate in 
value over time, isn’t an investment per se. It’s your shelter. You own your 
home as a place to live, and if you make money on it, that’s a secondary perk. 
REITs, on the other hand, are purely designed to be investments. Cohen & 
Steers (www.cohenandsteers.com), an investment research firm dedicated 
to real estate, provides comprehensive details about REIT investing.
Most importantly, REITs tend to be a great way to diversify a portfolio. REITs 
are attractive because they have relatively low correlations with stocks. If 
stocks are down, for instance, REITs might not be down as much or might be 
rising. And when REITs are down, your stocks might be up. By owning REITs 
and stocks together, you can smooth out your portfolio’s ups and downs, 
which cuts your risk and boosts returns. (See Chapter 9 for more info on 
asset allocation.)

About the Author
Matt Krantz is a nationally known financial journalist who specializes in 
investing topics. He has been a writer for USA TODAY since 1999, where he 
covers financial markets and Wall Street, concentrating on developments 
affecting individual investors and their portfolios. His stories routinely 
signal trends that investors can profit from and sound warnings about 
potential scams and issues investors should be aware of. Krantz has writ-
ten or co‐written three books in addition to this one, including Fundamental 
Analysis For Dummies, Investment Banking For Dummies, and Mint.com 
For Dummies.
In addition to covering markets for the print edition of USA TODAY, Matt 
writes a daily online investing column called “Ask Matt,” which appears 
every trading day at USATODAY.com and in USA TODAY. He answers ques-
tions posed by the website’s audience in an easy‐to‐understand manner. 
Readers often tell Matt he’s the only one who has been able to finally solve 
investing questions they’ve sought answers to for years.
Matt has been investing since the 1980s and has studied dozens of invest-
ment techniques while forming his own. And as a financial journalist, Matt 
has interviewed some of the most famous and infamous investment minds 
in modern history. Before joining USA TODAY, Matt worked as a business 
and technology reporter for Investor’s Business Daily and was a consultant 
with Ernst & Young prior to that.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration at Miami 
University in Oxford, Ohio. In addition to appearing on the print and online 
pages of USA TODAY, he has spoken for investing groups, including at the 
national convention of National Association of Investors Corporation, and 
has appeared on various financial TV.
Matt is based in USA TODAY’s Los Angeles bureau. When he’s not writ-

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife, Nancy, and daughter, Leilani, who are 
always available to help me think of a better word or a new way of thinking 
at things to make them better.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Wiley personnel have been tremendous to work with on this project, 
including senior acquisitions editor Katie Mohr, project editor Maureen 
Tullis, and copy editor Scott Tullis, who found ways to make this edition 
of the book even more useful to readers with great edits and suggestions. 
Kevin Kirschner, technical editor, made sure that the book was free of 
“dead links” by checking every URL and link. A big thanks to Matt Wagner, 
my literary agent, for thinking of me for the project and first presenting 
it to me, as well as production coordinator Anthony Sarni. Fane Lozman 
provided input by sharing his options expertise. Thanks to my mom and 
dad for instilling, at a very young age, a curiosity in investing, writing, and 
computers (and for buying me my first computer well before having a PC 
was common). And thanks to my grandparents for teaching me the power 
of saving and investing.
And thank you — the readers — for picking up this book and the previous 
editions and telling me how much you like them.
