The pickle Module
Python specific
A way to represent an object in a persistent way
Create an object’s representation
à serializing
Reload object from representation
à deserializing
marshalling
Pickle is a binary serialization (by default)
Focus on dictionaries
à Can be used for other object types
à disk, transmission
obj
101100011001…
serialize
deserialize
obj

Danger Zone!
Unpickling (deserializing) can execute code
à not safe!
Only unpickle data you trust

Usage
import pickle
dump
à pickle to file
load
à unpickle from file
dumps
à returns a (string) pickled representation
loads
à unpickle from supplied argument
à store in a variable

Equality and Identity

unpickle
dict2
id=100
id=200
dict1 == dict2
à True
dict1 is dict2
à False
à Custom objects will need to implement __eq__

Equality and Identity
While pickling, Python will not re-serialize an object it has already serialized
à recursive objects can be pickled
à shared objects are deserialized as shared objects as well
