Japanese For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
xx

Introduction
W

e live in a wonderfully global and amazingly diverse society. 
Exchanging ideas, products, foods, and friendship across national 
and cultural boundaries is the key to making our lives richer and more mean­
ingful and peaceful. Besides, traveling abroad is a lot cheaper than it used 
to be. Grabbing your passport and setting off on an adventure is always fun, 
but it’s even more fun when you can communicate with people in a different 
country in their own language.
If Japanese is the language you want to learn, for whatever reason, Japanese 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, can help. It provides instant results, plus some of 
the cultural background behind the language. Now, I’m not saying that you’ll 
be fluent overnight, but you will gain confidence, have fun, and continue to 
pick up more and more Japanese so that you can carry on a conversation 
with your Japanese-speaking co-worker, family member, friend, or neighbor.
About This Book
Japanese For Dummies, 2nd Edition, can help you whether you want to get 
familiar with Japanese because you’re planning a trip to my island-nation 
homeland, because you deal with Japanese companies at work, or because 
your new neighbor is Japanese and you want to be able to say good morning 
to him or her. (Try ohayō gozaimasu [oh-hah-yohh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo].) I 
give you the most-important and most-used Japanese words and phrases on 
subjects as diverse as shopping, money, food, and sports in self-contained 
chapters and sections.
Simply turn to the topics that interest you the most, play the included audio 
examples, and start speaking! That’s right, you don’t have to go through this 
book in order. If I think you may want to know information that’s contained 
in a different chapter than the one you’re currently reading, I include a handy 
cross-reference so you can find the additional information when you’re ready 
for it.

Japanese For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions in this book to help your reading go smoothly:
	
✓	In many places throughout this book, Japanese terms appear in two 
forms: Japanese scripts (like what you would read if you were in Japan) 
and the Romanized forms of words (which appear in boldface so 
you can easily find them in the text). The official term for Romanized 
Japanese is rōmaji (rohh-mah-jee).
	
✓	Pronunciations in parentheses and meanings or English equivalents in 
another pair of parentheses follow the Japanese terms. Note that mean­
ings and English equivalents appear in italics.
	
✓	Verb conjugations (lists that show you the basic forms of a verb) are 
given in tables in this order: the dictionary form, the negative (nai-) 
form, the stem form (or the form before the polite suffix -masu), and 
the te-form. You find Japanese scripts in the first column, rōmaji in the 
second column, and pronunciations in the third column. Here’s a sample 
conjugation of the verb taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat):
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
食べる
taberu
tah-beh-roo
食べない
tabenai
tah-beh-nah-ee
食べ（ます）
tabe(masu)
tah-beh(-mah-soo)
食べて
tabete
tah-beh-teh
	
	Keep in mind that Japanese verbs don’t conjugate like English verbs. 
You can’t find exact counterparts for English verb forms such as infini­
tives, gerunds, and participles. In addition, you don’t conjugate Japanese 
verbs in terms of the person and number, so taberu can mean I eat, you 
eat, he eats, she eats, and they eat. This difference may take a little get­
ting used to, but it should make your verb-learning life a little easier.
To help you remember the most important new words and see the lan­
guage in context, this book includes some special elements to reinforce the 
Japanese terms you’re studying:
	
✓	Talkin’ the Talk dialogues: Hearing actual Japanese conversations is 
the best way to learn Japanese, which is why I include many dialogues 
under the “Talkin’ the Talk” heading in this book. These exchanges show 
you the Japanese words in rōmaji, their pronunciations, and the English 
translations so that you can see how the language is actually used. All 

3
 Introduction
Talkin’ the Talk dialogues are accompanied by audio recordings so that 
you can hear and pick up the natural intonation and rhythm that are 
essential in conversational interactions.
	
✓	Words to Know blackboards: Here’s where you find key words and 
phrases from the Talkin’ the Talk dialogues.
	
✓	Fun & Games activities: Located at the end of chapters, these amusing 
activities help reinforce the vocabulary you practice in each chapter. 
You can find the solutions to these activities in Appendix D.
This book also features compact yet convenient mini-dictionaries — both 
Japanese-English and English-Japanese — in Appendix A. They include only 
very basic vocabulary words, mainly content words such as nouns, adjectives, 
adverbs, and verbs. For your convenience, I mark the conjugation class of 
the verbs: u for u-verbs, ru for ru-verbs, and irr for irregular verbs. Slightly 
irregular u-verbs are specified as u (irr). In the English-Japanese mini-dictionary, 
I also designate verbs with (v.) because some English verbs also function as 
nouns. Last but certainly not least, I mark the type of adjectives: i for i-type 
adjectives and na for na-type adjectives. A few i-type adjectives with minor 
irregularities are specified as i (irr).
Speaking of language quirks, you should know that English and Japanese 
sometimes express the same concept in very different ways. And Japanese 
has many words and phrases that you can’t translate into English at all. 
In this book, I want you to focus on what is actually said (the content and 
intended meaning) rather than how it’s said. So instead of giving you a literal 
translation, I give you a nonliteral, natural English translation. For example, 
the phrase yoroshiku (yoh-roh-shee-koo) can be literally translated as appro­
priately, but the phrase really means pleased to meet you if you say it when 
meeting someone new. This book gives the nonliteral, pleased-to-meet-you 
type translations (sometimes with the more literal translation for reference).
Your exploration of Japanese will also show you different ways of looking 
at the world of language because Japanese doesn’t contain the same type of 
grammar items as European languages do. For example, Japanese doesn’t 
have equivalents of English articles like a and the. Some verbs in English cor­
respond to adjectives in Japanese. For example, the verb to want is best rep­
resented by the Japanese adjective hoshii, so be ready to see some mismatch 
in the part-of-speech categories. And Japanese doesn’t have a singular/plural 
distinction, such as dog and dogs, either. The information about specificity 
and numbers are expressed in very different ways. Also, Japanese sometimes 
has linguistic systems that European languages don’t have. For example, 
Japanese speech styles clearly indicate degrees of respect or familiarity 
within conversational contexts.

Japanese For Dummies 
What You’re Not to Read
Although I hope you read everything in this book, you certainly don’t have 
to read the sidebars (the gray-shaded boxes you see sprinkled throughout 
the book). They contain information that’s interesting but not essential if you 
just want to be able to speak Japanese.
Foolish Assumptions
To write this book, I had to work off of some assumptions about you. I’m 
thinking that
	
✓	You don’t know much Japanese, except maybe for a few words like 
karate and sushi.
	
✓	You’re not planning on taking a language-proficiency test for Japanese 
next month, and you’re not planning on becoming a professional 
Japanese translator in the near future. You just want to be able to com­
municate basic information in Japanese and get to know the Japanese 
language.
	
✓	You don’t have time to spend hours and hours memorizing vocabulary 
and grammar rules.
	
✓	You want to have fun in addition to learning Japanese.
How This Book Is Organized
Japanese For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is divided into five parts. Each part has a 
specific focus or function. Here’s how they break down.
Part I: Getting Started
This part provides you with essentials of the Japanese language. Chapter 1 
gives you a taste of Japanese phrases so you get a feel for what you find 
throughout the book. Chapter 2 lays out the basics of the Japanese sounds 
and writing systems, and Chapter 3 compactly provides the essential ele­
ments of Japanese grammar. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 offer Japanese words and 
phrases you can’t live without: daily-life expressions, numbers, and words 
and phrases you use in your household.

5
 Introduction
Part II: Japanese in Action
This part gets you going and engaged in actions. It provides Japanese words 
and phrases that you can use for meeting new people (Chapter 7); asking direc­
tions (Chapter 8); doing your job (Chapter 12); and engaging in your favorite 
activities such as dining out (Chapter 9), shopping (Chapter 10), exploring the 
town (Chapter 11), and enjoying recreational activities (Chapter 13).
Part III: Japanese on the Go
Time to forget about your daily routines and the activities you do in the com­
fort of your own town and go on a trip! This part lets you plan a trip (Chapter 
14), deal with money in a foreign land (Chapter 15), and choose the right 
transportation method (Chapter 16) and the right place to stay (Chapter 17). 
You also get tips and vocabulary on handling emergencies while you’re away 
(Chapter 18).
Part IV: The Part of Tens
This part is the collection of simple phrases and facts that I want you to know 
and remember right away. Here you can find ten ways to pick up Japanese 
quickly (Chapter 19), ten things you should never say in front of Japanese 
folks (Chapter 20), ten favorite Japanese expressions (Chapter 21), and ten 
phrases that make you sound like a native Japanese-speaker (Chapter 22).
Part V: Appendixes
This part is home to helpful references such as a very convenient mini-
dictionary (Appendix A), verb tables that show you the conjugation patterns 
of all types of regular verbs and most of the irregular verbs (Appendix B), a 
list of all the accompanying audio tracks (Appendix C), and the answers to 
the Fun & Games exercises at the end of the chapters (Appendix D).
Icons Used in This Book
To help you find certain types of information quickly, I’ve placed some icons 
throughout the book. Here are the six icons to keep an eye out for:

6
Japanese For Dummies 
	
If you’re interested in information and advice about culture and travel, look 
for these icons. They draw your attention to interesting tidbits about Japan 
and Japanese culture.
	
If you understand grammar, you can create an infinite number of sentences, so 
I use this icon to point out discussions of grammar facts.
	
The audio recordings that come with this book give you the opportunity to 
listen to real Japanese speakers so that you can get a better understanding 
of what Japanese sounds like. This icon marks the spots where audio record­
ings are available (for the basic sounds in Chapter 2 and all Talkin’ the Talk 
dialogues). You can find these audio tracks on the accompanying CD, or if you 
have a digital version of this book, you can access the tracks via the link in the 
Table of Contents.
	
To ensure that you don’t forget information important to the language, this 
icon serves as a reminder, just like a string tied around your finger.
	
This icon highlights suggestions that can make learning Japanese easier.
	
This icon can keep you from making embarrassing or really foolish mistakes.
Where to Go from Here
You can read as much or as little as you want of this book and the chapters 
in it. Decide what topic you’re interested in, consult the index or table of 
contents to find the proper section, and quickly discover what you need to 
know to speak about that topic in Japanese. Of course, if you’re looking to 
get a foundation in the basics, I recommend turning to Chapters 2 and 3 first. 
These chapters contain the fundamentals of Japanese pronunciation, writing 
systems, and grammar. Read them now and then refer to them later if you get 
hung up on how to read Japanese scripts or build sentences.
Well, what are you waiting for? Head for the chapter that interests you or 
listen to the included audio examples. And make sure to use your favorite 
Japanese phrases when you hang out with your friends or family. If you think 
your family probably won’t understand what you say, teach them Japanese. 
With a little dedication, you’ll be able to confidently answer Hai! (hah-ee!) 
(Yes!) when people ask Nihongo wa hanasemasu ka. (nee-hohn-goh wah hah-
nah-seh-mah-soo kah.) (Can you speak Japanese?)

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
P

art I welcomes you to the Japanese language. Here, 
I give you the basic facts on Japanese — what the 
Japanese sounds sound like, what the Japanese scripts 
look like, and how to put Japanese words together appro­
priately. Then I provide you with some Japanese words 
and phrases you simply can’t live without: daily-life 
expressions, numbers, and words and phrases used in 
your household. Jā, hajimemashō! (jahh, hah-jee-meh-
mah-shohh!) (Let’s start!).

W

elcome to Japanese! Now that you’ve decided to learn this intriguing 
language, I’m sure you’re eager to find out as much as you can as 
quickly as you can. After all, you probably have co-workers, friends, neighbors, 
and others to impress with your newfound language skills. Well, here’s your 
chance to dive into Japanese. This chapter offers you a mini-preview of what 
you can find throughout Japanese For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Discovering Basic Japanese 
Sounds and Script
Japanese sounds are pretty easy to pronounce. For one thing, Japanese has 
only five basic vowels: a (ah), i (ee), u (oo), e (eh), and o (oh). In addition, 
you don’t see a long string of consonants before or after a vowel, unlike in 
Russian or Polish. You just have to pay attention to a handful of strange con­
sonants, such the Japanese r, which makes a sound somewhere between the 
English l and r. You can pronounce basic sounds in Japanese along with the 
audio recordings in Chapter 2.
Japanese writing, on the other hand, can be confusing because Japanese 
scripts don’t look at all like Western alphabets. The Japanese scripts consist 
of two sets of kana (kah-nah) — phonetic symbols for Japanese syllables — 
and about 2,000 kanji (kahn-jee) characters, which are Chinese characters 
adapted for Japanese. If you just want to learn how to speak Japanese, you 
may want to skip focusing on these Japanese scripts and use rōmaji (rohh-
mah-jee), the Romanized spellings of Japanese words. However, getting used 

10
Part I: Getting Started 
to the Japanese scripts is a good idea, especially if you plan to use your 
Japanese skills to travel. If you can recognize some of the Japanese scripts, 
you can get around in a Japanese town more easily because all street signs 
are written in only the Japanese scripts.
Another advantage of being able to recognize the Japanese scripts, especially 
kana, is that you can avoid reading Japanese like English. For example, the 
Japanese word that means bamboo is take. As an English speaker, you may 
have an urge to read take as teh-ee-koo because you know the English word 
to take, but the Japanese pronunciation of this word is tah-keh. In this case, 
the rōmaji may mislead you, but the kana, たけ, wouldn’t because your exist­
ing knowledge in English can’t interfere. Chapter 2 shows all kana characters 
and some representative kanji characters for your reference. 
Getting a Grip on Basic Grammar
Japanese grammar is quite different from English grammar, particularly when 
it comes to word order in sentences. Even if grammar was your most hated 
subject, you can’t avoid learning grammar if you want to speak Japanese like 
a native. Without grammar, you’ll sound like a big 2-year-old, saying things 
like the Japanese counterparts of Brian car, me kiss Mary, or John in office.
	
You generally put the verb at the end of the sentence and add the particle o 
(oh) after the direct object noun. So to mean to eat sushi, say sushi o taberu 
(soo-shee oh tah-beh-roo), where taberu means to eat.
For further insight into Japanese grammar, head to Chapter 3, which tells you 
all about parts of speech; conjugation patterns; and the structure of words, 
phrases, and sentences.
Easing into Common Expressions
What are the most common communicative situations? Introducing yourself, 
greeting, parting, thanking, apologizing . . . I can keep listing them, but I’d 
rather introduce you to some common expressions (you can find more of 
them in Chapter 4):
	
✓	はじめまして。 Hajimemashite. (hah-jee-meh-mah-shee-teh.) (How do 
you do?)
	
✓	宜しくお願いします。 Yoroshiku onegai shimasu. (yoh-roh-shee-koo oh-
neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Pleased to meet you.)

11
 Chapter 1: Japanese in a Nutshell
	
✓	おはようございます。 Ohayō gozaimasu. (oh-hah-yohh goh-zah-ee-mah-
soo.) (Good morning.)
	
✓	じゃあ，また。 Jā, mata. (jahh, mah-tah.) (I’ll see you again.)
	
✓	ありがとうございます。 Arigatō gozaimasu. (ah-ree-gah-tohh goh-zah-
ee-mah-soo.) (Thank you.)
	
✓	すみません。 Sumimasen. (soo-mee-mah-sehn.) (I’m sorry.)
Counting on Numbers
Numbers dominate everyday life. What time do you wake up? How many 
glasses of water do you drink a day? How many guests are you expecting? 
How much does buying groceries cost? Chapter 5 lets you count both small 
and large numbers and use them with the right counters.
Counters, you ask? The Japanese use a short, suffix-like element called a 
counter right after the number. The counter you use varies depending on the 
type of things you’re counting or the kind of notions you’re specifying. To 
start with, count the bare simple numbers from one to ten:
	
✓	一 ichi (ee-chee) (one)
	
✓	二 ni (nee) (two)
	
✓	三 san (sahn) (three)
	
✓	四 yon (yohn) or shi (shee) (four)
	
✓	五 go (goh) (five)
	
✓	六 roku (roh-koo) (six)
	
✓	七 nana (nah-nah) or shichi (shee-chee) (seven)
	
✓	八 hachi (hah-chee) (eight)
	
✓	九 kyū (kyooo) or ku (koo) (nine)
	
✓	十 jū (jooo) (ten)
	
Japanese also frequently uses the Arabic numerals (1, 2, and so on) that 
you’re used to seeing.
You can read more about using numbers, including using them to tell time 
and specify dates, in Chapter 5.

12
Part I: Getting Started 
Speaking Japanese around the House
You spend at least a half of your time in your house every day — sleeping, 
cooking, eating, watching TV, and so on. Here are some terms to help you 
name the rooms in your house in Japanese:
	
✓	ダイニング dainingu (dah-ee-neen-goo) (dining room)
	
✓	風呂場 furoba (foo-roh-bah) (bathing room)
	
✓	キッチン kitchin (keet-cheen) (kitchen)
	
✓	リビング ribingu (ree-been-goo) (living room)
	
✓	寝室 shinshitsu (sheen-shee-tsoo) (bedroom)
Chapter 6 introduces the Japanese words you need for naming things in your 
house and expressing what you do in your house.
Using Japanese in Social Scenarios
I can’t stress enough that a language is just the tool for communication. 
Communication should be your ultimate goal for studying any language. You 
communicate with people not only for socialization and entertainment but 
also for completing daily tasks successfully with your family, friends, and col­
leagues. That is, developing good language skills is the key to your success in 
your life! The following sections introduce you to some of the vocabulary you 
need in various social situations.
Making small talk
If you want to say something more than just “hello” when you see someone, 
make a point of knowing Japanese phrases that can help you initiate small 
talk. Start with questions like the following:
	
✓	どちらまでですか。 Dochira made desu ka. (doh-chee-rah mah-deh deh-
soo kah.) (Where are you heading to?)
	
✓	いい天気ですね。Ii tenki desu ne. (eee tehn-kee deh-soo neh.) (It’s nice 
today, isn’t it?)
	
✓	ご兄弟は。 Go-kyōdai wa. (goh-kyohh-dah-ee wah.) (Do you have any 
siblings?)
	
✓	メールアドレスは。 Mēru adoresu wa. (mehh-roo ah-doh-reh-soo wah.) 
(What’s your e-mail address?)
Chapter 7 shows you how to conduct small talk in Japanese.

13
 Chapter 1: Japanese in a Nutshell
Asking for directions
	
When you need to ask for directions to somewhere, name the place you want 
to go, add the particle wa (wah) after it, and say doko desu ka (doh-koh 
deh-soo kah), as in Eki wa doko desu ka. (eh-kee wah doh-koh deh-soo kah.) 
(Where is the train station?)
Chapter 8 shows you how to ask or give directions in Japanese.
Eating out and buying food
If you love eating Japanese foods, you need to know how to place an order 
at a restaurant in Japanese. Your server will ask you, Go-chūmon wa. 
(goh-chooo-mohn wah.) (Your order?). That’s your opportunity to say, for 
example, Sushi o onegai shimasu. (soo-shee oh oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-
soo.) (Sushi, please.)
Find out more about how to eat out at restaurants and buy food in Chapter 9.
Going shopping
Who doesn’t love shopping? If you’re looking for something in particular, 
name it, add wa (wah) after it, and say arimasu ka (ah-ree-mah-soo kah), as 
in Sukāfu wa arimasu ka. (soo-kahh-foo wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you 
have a scarf?). Definitely check the price, though. You can do so by asking 
Ikura desu ka. (ee-koo-rah deh-soo kah.) (How much?).
Turn to Chapter 10 for more words and phrases that can help you have suc­
cessful shopping experiences in Japanese.
Exploring entertainment opportunities
Hanging out at home is fun, but if you do that 7 days a week, 365 days a year, 
it’s going to get boring. So why not head out and explore the entertainment 
opportunities your community has to offer? I bet you’ll find some of the 
following:
	
✓	美術館 bijutsukan (bee-joo-tsoo-kahn) (art museums)
	
✓	劇場 gekijō (geh-kee-johh) (theaters for performing arts)

14
Part I: Getting Started 
	
✓	博物館 hakubutsukan (hah-koo-boo-tsoo-kahn) (museums)
	
✓	カラオケ karaoke (kah-rah-oh-keh) (karaoke)
	
✓	クラブ kurabu (koo-rah-boo) (nightclub)
Chapter 11 introduces more fun places and shows you what you can do there 
in Japanese.
Doing business and communicating
Do you want to work in Japan or in a Japanese company in the United States? 
If the answer to either question is yes, you need to have a bunch of business-
related vocabulary under your belt. Chapter 12 provides such words, including
	
✓	ヴォイスメール boisu-mēru (boh-ee-soo-mehh-roo) (voicemail)
	
✓	配達する haitatsu suru (hah-ee-tah-tsoo soo-roo) (to deliver)
	
✓	確認する kakunin suru (kah-koo-neen soo-roo) (to confirm)
	
✓	コピーする kopī suru (koh-peee soo-roo) (to make copies)
	
✓	会議 kaigi (kah-ee-gee) (meeting, conference)
	
✓	メール mēru (mehh-roo) (e-mail)
	
✓	パソコンpasokon (pah-soh-kohn) (computer)
Enjoying sports, hobbies, 
recreation, and more
What better way to have a good time than by playing or watching your favor­
ite sport or indulging in a favorite hobby? Do you like any of the following 
activities?
	
✓	読書 dokusho (doh-koo-shoh) (reading)
	
✓	キルティング kirutingu (kee-roo-teen-goo) (quilting)
	
✓	キャンプ kyanpu (kyahn-poo) (camping)
	
✓	水泳 suiei (soo-ee-ehh) (swimming)
	
✓	釣り tsuri (tsoo-ree) (fishing)
Flip to Chapter 13 to find out how to talk about many other fun activities. And 
who knows? You may be inspired to pick up a new hobby while you’re at it!

 Chapter 1: Japanese in a Nutshell
Tackling Travel-Related Topics
After you’ve been studying Japanese for a while and the travel bug bites, you 
may feel like making the journey to Japan to really immerse yourself in the 
language and culture. From packing your bags to choosing accommodations 
and navigating emergencies, the next sections give you some of the basic 
vocabulary you need when traveling in Japan.
Preparing for a trip
The first step in preparing for your trip is to decide where to go. Then, depend­
ing on your destination, you’ll need to get a passport and book a flight. Here 
are some Japanese terms to consider as getting ready to plan a trip:
	
✓	チケット chiketto (chee-keht-toh) (ticket)
	
✓	飛行機 hikōki (hee-kohh-kee) (airplane)
	
✓	ホテル hoteru (hoh-teh-roo) (hotel)
	
✓	パスポート pasupōto (pah-soo-pohh-toh) (passport)
	
✓	スーツケース sūtsukēsu (sooo-tsoo-kehh-soo) (suitcase)
Chapter 14 helps you make your travel plan in addition to packing your suitcase.
Making sense of money
You need money no matter where you travel, and if you’re headed to a foreign 
destination, you need to be prepared ryōgae suru (ryohh-gah-eh soo-roo) (to 
exchange) your country’s currency for that of your destination country. Be 
sure to bring enough genkin (gehn-keen) (cash) to the exchange counter.
	
Even at a foreign ginkō (geen-kohh) (bank), you may be able to use your ATM 
card to withdraw funds from your kōza (kohh-za) (account) in the right currency.
For more money-related words, as well as information on the Japanese en 
(ehn) (yen), see Chapter 15.
Getting around with local transportation
Make sure you know the best ways of getting from place to place in a foreign 
country you’re planning on visiting. In large urban areas, people often walk or 

16
Part I: Getting Started 
take the chikatetsu (chee-kah-teh-tsoo) (subway). Other common methods of 
transportation may include one (or more!) of the following:
	
✓	電車 densha (dehn-shah) (train)
	
✓	フェリー ferī (feh-reee) (ferry)
	
✓	自転車 jitensha (jee-tehn-shah) (bicycle)
	
✓	タクシー takushī (tah-koo-sheee) (taxi)
I cover transportation information in Chapter 16.
Securing a place to stay
You have several options to choose from when choosing your accommoda­
tions in Japan:
	
✓	ビジネスホテル bijinesu hoteru (bee-jee-neh-soo hoh-teh-roo) (business 
hotel)
	
✓	観光ホテル kankō hoteru (kahn-kohh hoh-teh-roo) (tourist’s hotel)
	
✓	カプセルホテル kapuseru hoteru (kah-poo-seh-roo hoh-teh-roo) (capsule 
hotel)
	
✓	旅館 ryokan (ryoh-kahn) (Japanese-style inn)
	
✓	ユースホステル yūsu hosuteru (yooo-soo hoh-soo-teh-roo) (youth hostel)
Chapter 17 helps you choose the right accommodation for your needs, make 
a reservation, check into it, and check out at the end of your trip.
Taking action during emergencies
No one likes to think about experiencing an emergency while traveling, but if 
you’re in a foreign country, you’re better off knowing what to do if an illness, 
injury, or emergency pops up. Chapter 18 provides you with the confidence 
and the Japanese to act wisely when you face an emergency.
	
Memorize these phrases now — and hope you don’t need them later:

✓	泥棒！ Dorobō! (doh-roh-bohh!) (A thief!)
	
✓	火事！ Kaji! (kah-jee!) (Fire!)

his chapter lets you open your mouth and sound like a totally different 
person — a Japanese person! Get ready to find out all about the basic 
Japanese vowel and consonant sounds. You also discover the core concepts 
of the Japanese writing systems.
Pronouncing Basic Japanese Sounds
Japanese sounds are very easy to hear and pronounce; each syllable is short 
and simple. With a little practice, you’ll get used to these sounds quickly. The 
following sections get you off on the right foot (or should I say the right sound) 
by looking at vowels, consonants, and a couple of combinations of each.
Vowels
The Japanese language has only five basic vowels — a, e, i, o, and u, all 
of which sound short and crispy — plus their longer counterparts. Long 
vowels have the same sound as short vowels; you just draw out the sound 
for a moment longer. The long vowels are sometimes represented by double 
letters — aa, ee, ii, oo, and uu — but the more common presentation uses 
single letters with a bar ( ¯ ) over them, as in ā, ē, ī, ō, and ū. This second 
method is what I use in this book.

The difference between a long vowel and a short vowel can make all the differ­
ence in the meaning of a Japanese word. For example, obasan (oh-bah-sahn) 
with the short vowel a means aunt, but obāsan (oh-bahh-sahn) with the long 
vowel ā means grandmother.
Listen for the difference between short and long vowel sounds on Track 1 
while you look at Table 2-1 to get the idea about vowel length.

Unlike in English, vowels can appear next to each other without being sepa­
rated by a consonant in Japanese. You may be inclined to pronounce them 
as one vowel, but the Japanese actually pronounce each vowel so that the 
sequence is multiple syllables. Track 1 gives some examples of these sequen­
tial vowels and their pronunciations:
	
✓	あお ao (ah-oh) (blue color)
	
✓	あおい aoi (ah-oh-ee) (blue)
	
✓	いえ ie (ee-eh) (house)
	
✓	いう iu (ee-oo) (to say)
	
✓	うえ ue (oo-eh) (up, above, on)
	
✓	おい oi (oh-ee) (nephew)
	
The vowels i (ee) and u (oo) come out as a downright whisper, in normal or 
fast speech, when they fall between the consonant sounds ch, h, k, p, s, sh, t, 
or ts or when a word ends in this consonant-vowel combination.
Consonants
Most Japanese consonants are pronounced like their English counterparts, 
but check out the descriptions of the sounds you need to pay attention to in 
Table 2-2 (you can hear them pronounced on Track 1).

Japanese Consonants Very Different from English

Description of the Sound
Examples
r
Almost like a Spanish r, where you tap your 
tongue on the roof of your mouth just once — 
almost like an English d or l, but not quite.
りんご
ringo
(reen-goh)
(apple)
f
A much softer sound than the English f — 
somewhere between an f and an h sound. 
Make it by bringing your lips close to each 
other and gently blowing air through them.
ふゆ
fuyu
(foo-yoo)
(winter)
ts
The combination of t and s is hard to pro­
nounce at the beginning of a word, as in tsu­
nami, although it’s easy anywhere else. My 
advice is to say the word cats in your head 
and then say tsunami.
つなみ
tsunami
(tsoo-nah-mee)
(tsunami)
ry
The combination of r and y is difficult to pro­
nounce when it occurs before the vowel o. 
Try saying ri (ree) and then yo (yoh). Repeat 
many times and gradually increase the 
speed until you can pronounce these two 
sounds simultaneously. Remember that the r 
sounds almost like a d in English.
りょう
ryō
(ryohh)
(dormitory)
	
Like most other languages, Japanese has double consonants, which are pro­
nounced as single consonants preceded by a brief pause. Check out the fol­
lowing examples and listen to the pronunciation on Track 1.
	
✓	きっぷ kippu (keep-poo) (transportation tickets)
	
✓	きって kitte (keet-teh) (postage stamp)
	
✓	けっこん kekkon (kehk-kohn) (marriage)
	
✓	まっすぐ massugu (mahs-soo-goo) (straight)
	
✓	バッグ baggu (bahg-goo) (bag)
	
✓	ベッド beddo (behd-doh) (bed)
Sounding Fluent
If you want to sound like a native Japanese speaker, you need to imitate the 
overall stress accent, the pitch and intonation, the rhythm, and the speed of 
native Japanese. These almost-musical aspects of the language make a big dif­
ference, and the following sections show you how to achieve them.

21
 Chapter 2: Checking Out the Japanese Sounds and Scripts
Don’t stress
English sentences sound like they’re full of punches, one after another, 
because English words have stressed syllables followed by unstressed syl­
lables. But Japanese sentences sound very flat because Japanese words and 
phrases don’t have any stressed syllables. So unless you’re very angry or 
excited, suppress your desire to stress syllables when you speak Japanese.
Watch out for pitch and intonation
Although Japanese speakers don’t stress their syllables (see the preceding 
section), they may raise or lower their pitch on a specific syllable in certain 
words. A raised pitch may sound like a stress, but it’s not quite the same 
concept; if you think in terms of music, higher-pitched notes aren’t neces­
sarily stressed more than low notes. But even though pitch differences don’t 
change the emphasis in a word, these slight shifts can change the word’s 
meaning. That, however, also depends on what part of Japan you’re in. For 
example, in eastern Japan, the word hashi (hah-shee) said with high-to-low 
pitch means chopsticks, but with low-to-high pitch, it means a bridge. In west­
ern Japan, it’s exactly the opposite: High-to-low pitch means a bridge, and 
low-to-high pitch means chopsticks.
How can you tell what anyone means? For one thing, the eastern dialect is 
standard because that’s where Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is located. In any 
event, the context usually makes it clear. If you’re in a restaurant and you ask 
for hashi, you can safely assume that, no matter how you pitch this word, no 
one will bring you a bridge. Listen to such pairs on Track 2 and try to hear 
what I mean by pitch.
	
✓	箸 hashi (hah-shee) (chopsticks) versus 橋 hashi (hah-shee) (bridge)
	
✓	雨 ame (ah-meh) (rain) versus 飴 ame (ah-me) (candy)
	
✓	神 kami (kah-mee) (god) versus 紙 kami (kah-mee) (paper)
	
Similarly, a single phrase can be said or understood in different ways depend­
ing on the intonation, an overall pitch flow that applies to the entire phrase or 
sentence. Suppose someone said that math is the easiest subject in the world. 
You can respond to this statement by saying Sō desu ka. (sohh deh-soo kah.). 
If you say it with a falling intonation, you’re acknowledging the statement: Oh, 
I see. If you say it with a falling-rising intonation, you’re showing your doubt or 
slight disagreement: Really? Listen to the difference on Track 2.
	
Another interesting fact about pitch: The Japanese raise their overall pitch 
range when they speak to their superiors. So people speak to a boss, client, 
customer or teacher as if they (the speakers) are chirping birds and to their 
friends, assistants, and family members in a more normal pitch range. This 
shift is most noticeable among women. Female workers raise their pitch 

22
Part I: Getting Started 
greatly when they deal with business customers. They don’t mean to scare 
their customers; they’re just trying to be super polite. Women also raise their 
pitch when they speak to young children, just to indicate a friendly attitude 
toward the little ones. A Japanese woman’s flattering high pitch in these con­
texts has a totally different tone of voice from the high pitch that she uses 
when she raises her pitch out of anger.
Get in rhythm
English sentences sound very smooth and connected, but Japanese sen­
tences sound chopped up because each syllable is pronounced more clearly 
and separately in Japanese than in English. You can sound like a native 
speaker by pronouncing each Japanese syllable separately.
Body language
Gestures are very important for communication. 
Japanese probably use fewer gestures than 
Westerners; for example, they don’t hug or kiss 
people in public. But they do have some unique 
gestures. If you know these gestures’ meanings 
and functions and can use them as you interact 
with Japanese people, you’ll seem like part of 
the crowd. Try some of the following gestures 
yourself. And if you see native Japanese people 
in a Japanese grocery store, at the mall, at a 
party, or anywhere else, observe them carefully. 
You’ll definitely see some of these gestures.
	✓	Banzai: When a bunch of people gather to 
celebrate something, they often stand up at 
the same time, raise both arms over their 
heads simultaneously, and shout “万歳! 
Banzai! (bahn-zah-ee!) (Hurrah!)” together 
three times.
	✓	Bowing: For Japanese, bowing is an abso­
lutely important and necessary everyday 
communication tool. You bow to thank 
someone, to apologize, to greet, and even 
to say goodbye. By bowing, you express 
your politeness and respect for others. 
But you don’t have to bow very deeply. In 
most cases, you can just tilt your head for 
a second or two. Save the deep bow, using 
the upper half of the body, for those times 
when you make a horrible mistake, receive 
overwhelming kindness, or associate with 
extremely formal people.
	✓	Nodding: Whenever someone says some­
thing to you, nod immediately. Otherwise, 
the speaker will think you’re not paying 
attention or that you’re upset.
	✓	Waving: If you want Japanese folks to 
understand your waves, you must know that 
Japanese waving is all in the wrist. If you 
greet your American neighbor by moving 
your hand up and down from your wrist, like 
a toddler waving bye-bye, he’ll understand 
that you mean to say hi. However, your 
Japanese neighbor will think you’re beck­
oning her to come to you. The Japanese use 
a sort of palm-down scooping motion to say 
come here — just a 180-degree turn from 
the palm-up scooping motion Americans 
use to say the same thing.

 Chapter 2: Checking Out the Japanese Sounds and Scripts
	
Each syllable is represented by each kana character, so seeing Japanese 
scripts can help you pronounce words and sentences well. For the scoop on 
the Japanese scripts, including kana, see the later related section.
Keep your speed up
The shortcut to sounding like a Japanese native is to pay attention to your 
speech speed. Try to say the entire phrase or sentence in normal speed. If 
you speak too slowly, the listener may lose track of what you are trying to 
say even if your pronunciation is precisely perfect. I’m not asking you to 
speak fast, but try to speak close to the normal speech speed of native speak­
ers. Chances are that no one will notice your minor pronunciation problems 
if you speak in normal speed with the right intonation and rhythm.
Introducing the Japanese Scripts
Japanese uses multiple writing systems simultaneously even in the same 
sentence, combining two sets of phonetic symbols called kana (hiragana 
and katakana) and Chinese characters called kanji. Each kana character 
represents a syllable sound, but each kanji character represents a mean­
ing. This book provides kana and kanji in most sections so you can get used 
to authentic Japanese texts, but don’t worry; I also provide rōmaji (rohh-
mah-jee) (Roman letters) throughout the book so you never get lost or feel 
intimidated. It’s really up to you whether you want to learn Japanese by using 
rōmaji, using kana and kanji, or using both!
Kana
In modern Japanese, hiragana is mainly used for representing grammatical 
elements and native words not written in kanji, while katakana is used for 
representing foreign names and foreign vocabulary. The next sections intro­
duce you to the symbols and the sounds they stand for, as well as some basic 
writing-related rules.
The characters
Table 2-3 shows basic hiragana and katakana characters. Try reading them 
aloud along with Track 3. (Note: Some people pronounce the second-to-last 
entry in the table as woh, but only some of the time.)

The basic rules
The character ん (n) represents an independent syllable for Japanese even 
though it may sound like part of an existing syllable to you. を is usually pro­
nounced as o, like the character お, but it’s exclusively used as a direct object 
marker (see Chapter 3 to find out about direct objects in Japanese). A few kana 
characters have an exceptional pronunciation: は (ha) (hah) is read as wa 
(wah) when used as a topic particle, and へ (he) (heh) is read as e (eh) when 
used as a particle that shows directions. (I cover particles in Chapter 3.)
Japanese uses two diacritic marks: two short dashes ( „) and a small circle 
( ̊ ). By adding ( „) at the right upper corner of a kana character that starts 
with the consonant k, s, t, h, or f, you can make that consonant voiced. For 
example, か represents ka (kah), while が represents ga (gah). So you can 
convert k to g, s to z, and t to d by using ( „). Strangely, h and f are converted 
to b. Also remember that じ and ぢ both sound ji (jee) and ず and づ both 
sound zu (zoo). (However, ji and zu are almost always represented by じ and 
ず, respectively.)
	
What does voiced mean? To understand voiced and unvoiced sounds, say k 
and g while lightly touching your throat. You feel a vibration only when you 
say g, even though you’re doing largely the same thing with your mouth when 
you say k, right? Linguists call vibrationless sounds such as k, p, t, and s 
voiceless sounds, and sounds that do vibrate, such as g, b, d, and z, are voiced 
sounds.

26
Part I: Getting Started 
On the other hand, by adding a small circle ( ̊ ) at the right upper corner of 
a kana character that starts with h or f, you can convert the consonant to p. 
Check out the following example words that include these diacritic marks:
ぶんぷ bunpu (boon-poo) (distribution)
ちぢむ chijimu (chee-jee-moo) (to shrink)
ふぶき fubuki (foo-boo-kee) (snowstorm)
がか gaka (gah-kah) (painter)
はば haba (hah-bah) (width)
かんぱい Kanpai! (kahn-pah-ee!) (Toast!)
しじ shiji (shee-jee) (instruction)
すず suzu (soo-zoo) (bell)
つづき tsuzuki (tsoo-zoo-kee) (continuation)
You can represent complex syllables with the sound quality of y by adding a 
small-sized や (ya) (yah), ゆ (yu) (yoo), or よ (yo) (yoh) after a syllable with a 
vowel i (ee). I’m not talking about lowercase or uppercase. You just need to 
make the size of the character smaller by 50 to 75 percent. For example, き (ki) 
(kee) followed by the small-sized や yields きゃ (kya) (kyah). The same applies 
to katakana. The size difference is a bit hard to see in print, but I hope you 
gradually get used to it. Here are examples with such complex syllables:
ひゃく hyaku (hyah-koo) (hundred)
シャツ shatsu (shah-tsoo) (shirt)
しゅじゅつ shujutsu (shoo-joo-tsoo) (medical operation)
The small-sized つ (tsu) (tsoo) isn’t pronounced; rather, it represents a moment 
of pause found with double consonants. The same applies to katakana.
きって kitte (keeht-teh) (postage stamp)
みっつ mittsu (meet-tsoo) (three pieces)
ソックス sokkusu (sohk-koo-soo) (socks)
Long vowels are represented by an additional letter, あ(a) (ah), い(i) (ee), う
(u) (oo), え(e) (eh), or お(o) (oh) in hiragana, but by an elongation mark (ー) 
in katakana (check out the earlier section “Vowels” for more on long vowels). 
For example
おばあさん obāsan (oh-bahh-sahn) (grandmother)
おじいさん ojīsan (oh-jeee-sahn) (grandfather)
コーヒー kōhī (kohh-heee) (coffee)

27
 Chapter 2: Checking Out the Japanese Sounds and Scripts
	
The pronunciation of some kana changes slightly in normal-fast speech in 
some contexts. For example, the kana う (u) (oo) that follows another kana 
with the vowel o is read as a part of a long vowel ō, and the kana い (i) (ee) 
that follows another kana with the vowel e is read as a part of a long vowel ē. 
You can see what I mean in the following examples:
おとうさん otōsan (oh-tohh-sahn) (father)
せんせい sensei (sehn-sehh) (teacher)
Kanji
Kanji characters were imported from China. Many of them are made from 
pictures and signs, and others are combinations of multiple kanji characters 
or components. For example
Kanji made from pictures: 山 (mountain), 川 (river), 木 (tree), 日 (sun), 
月 (moon), and 人 (person)
Kanji made from signs: 一 (one), 二 (two), 三 (three), 上 (top),下 (bottom), 
and 中 (middle)
Kanji made by combining multiple kanji or kanji components: 明 
(bright), made of 日 (sun) and 月 (moon); 森 (forest), made of three 
instances of the kanji 木 (tree); 休 (rest), made of the kanji component イ 
(person) and the kanji 木 (tree)
Most kanji characters have multiple pronunciations, including Japanese-based 
and Chinese-based versions. For example, you pronounce 人 as hito (hee-toh) 
in the Japanese way when it appears by itself, but you most likely read it as jin 
(jeen) or nin (neen) when it’s a part of a compound noun. For example
人 hito (hee-toh) (person)
日本人 Nihonjin (nee-hohn-jeen) (Japanese person)
三人 sannin (sahn-neen) (three people)
Kanji characters for verbs and adjectives are usually followed by hiragana. 
For example
明るい akarui (ah-kah-roo-ee) (bright)
食べる taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat)
	
Unfortunately, I can’t give you an easy tip for knowing how to pronounce the 
kanji characters; you just have to learn them one by one. Look at how each 
character is used and read in different contexts. After a while, you’ll be able to 
make a pretty good guess on how to read a given kanji.

f grammar rules are the branches of a tree, words are the tree’s beautiful 
leaves. Checking the branches before enjoying those leaves is the short­
cut to your success in understanding the entire tree. This chapter shows you 
what the branches of the Japanese language tree look like. You discover the 
importance of speech styles in speaking Japanese like a native, as well as 
how to form sentences and ask basic questions. You also find out the basics 
of parts of speech such as pronouns, verbs, adjective, and adverbs. All that 
and more await you in this overview of Japanese grammar basics.
Using Appropriate Speech Styles
Japanese use different speech styles depending on who they’re talking to. For 
example, you ask a simple question like Did you see it? differently to different 
people. When speaking to your boss, use the formal style of speech and say 
Goran ni narimashita ka. (goh-rahn nee nah-ree-mah-shee-tah kah.). When 
speaking to your colleague, use the polite/neutral style and say Mimashita 
ka. (mee-mah-shee-tah kah.). And with your kids, use the plain/informal style 
and say Mita no. (mee-tah noh.). Notice that the phrase becomes shorter and 
shorter as you go down in the relative hierarchy from your boss to your kids. 
If you use the plain/informal style of speech with your boss, he or she will 
probably start looking for some official reason to kick you out of his or her 
group. If you use a formal style with your own daughter, you’ll sound like a 
commoner whose daughter got married to a royal prince. The tricky part of 

34
Part I: Getting Started 
choosing the correct speech style is that the choice depends on both social 
hierarchy (in terms of position and age) and social grouping (such as insid­
ers and outsiders). Depending on the audience, the informal forms can sound 
rude or very friendly; the formal forms can sound very polite or awfully cold. 
In some cases, which style you should use can be very unclear. What if your 
assistant is older than you are? What if your son is your boss? These scenarios 
are where your personality can influence your speech style; different people 
treat them in different ways, even in Japan. If you don’t want to offend anyone, 
your best bet is to use the polite version, at least at the beginning. Table 3-1 
gives you some general guidelines on when to use which speech style.
Table 3-1	
Speech Styles
Style
Whom to Use It With
Formal
Your business customer, a person who is much older than you, your 
boss, your teacher
Polite/neutral
Your classmate, your colleague, your neighbor, your acquaintance, 
your friend’s parent
Plain/informal
Your parent, your child, your spouse, your student, your assistant, 
your close friend
	
In this book, I use the speech style appropriate to the context, but don’t 
worry — you can tell the difference after you learn the basic verb forms.
	
As you’re beginning your Japanese study, my advice is to start from the polite/
neutral style and gradually play with formal and plain/informal styles.
Forming Sentences
It took me about 20 months to start forming a Japanese sentence after I was 
born. Twenty months! I was very cute at that age, or so my mom says. Today, 
you can start forming a Japanese sentence in just five minutes — I promise. 
You’re saving a lot of time! The following sections cover the important points 
for creating Japanese sentences.
Ordering the words correctly
	
The basic word order in English is subject-verb-object, but the order in Japanese 
is subject-object-verb. Instead of saying I watched TV, you say I TV watched. 
Instead of saying I ate sushi, you say I sushi ate. Now you know the pattern. So 
repeat after me: Put the verb at the end! Verb end! Verb end! Go ahead and try it! 

35
 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
I sake drank, I karaoke did, and I money lost! Good, you the basic word order in 
Japanese have.
Marking nouns with particles
Subject-object-verb is the basic word order in Japanese, but object-subject-
verb is also okay. As long as the verb is at the end of the sentence, Japanese 
grammar teachers are happy. For example, if Mary invited John, you can say 
either Mary John invited or John Mary invited in Japanese. Like I said, as long 
as the verb is at the end, the order of other phrases doesn’t matter.
Although it sounds great, a smart person like you may be saying, “Wait a 
minute! How do you know who invited whom?” The secret is that Japanese 
use a little tag called a particle right after each noun phrase. The particle for 
the action performer is ga (gah), and the particle for the action receiver is o 
(oh). So, both of the following sentences mean Mary invited John:
メアリーがジョンを誘いました。 Mearī ga Jon o sasoimashita. (meh-ah-
reee gah john oh sah-soh-ee-mah-shee-tah.)
ジョンをメアリーが誘いました。 Jon o Mearī ga sasoimashita. (john oh 
meh-ah-reee gah sah-soh-ee-mah-shee-tah.)
In other words, ga is the subject-marking particle, and o is the direct object-
marking particle. They can’t be translated into English. Sorry, it’s just 
Japanese.
Other Japanese particles include kara (kah-rah), made (mah-deh), ni (nee), 
de (deh), to (toh), and ka (kah). Luckily, they can be translated into English 
words like from, until, to, with, by, at, in, on, and, and or. But each particle is 
translated differently depending on the context. For example, the particle de 
corresponds to in, by, or with in English, depending on the context:
ボストンで勉強します。 Bosuton de benkyō shimasu. (boh-soo-tohn deh 
behn-kyohh shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll study in Boston.)
タクシーで行きます。 Takushī de ikimasu. (tah-koo-sheee deh ee-kee-
mah-soo.) (I’ll go by taxi.)
フォークで食べます。Fōku de tabemasu. (fohh-koo deh tah-beh-mah-
soo.) (I eat with a fork.)
	
Translation isn’t always the best way to figure out a foreign language, so 
remember the particles in terms of their general functions, not their exact 
English translations. Table 3-2 presents Japanese particles and their various 
meanings. I provide translations where I can.

If you’re going to be writing Japanese particles, use the hiragana を (oh) rather 
than the hiragana お (oh) for representing the particle o (oh). The hiragana を is 
used only as the particle for direct object. Also, use the hiragana へ (heh) for 
representing the particle e (eh). It’s just a convention of the Japanese language.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
You can have a bunch of particles in a sentence, as the following sentences 
illustrate:
メアリーが車で東京へ行った。 Mearī ga kuruma de Tōkyō e itta. (meh-
ah-reee gah koo-roo-mah deh tohh-kyohh eh eet-tah.) (Mary went to 
Tokyo by car.)
ジョンのお父さんからビールとお酒とワインをもらった。 Jon no otōsan 
kara bīru to osake to wain o moratta. (john noh oh-tohh-sahn kah-rah 
beee-roo toh oh-sah-keh toh wah-een oh moh-raht-tah.) (I received beer, 
sake, and wine from John’s dad.)
	
Japanese nouns don’t need articles like a and the in English. Furthermore, you 
don’t need to specify singular or plural. Tamago (tah-mah-goh) is either an egg 
or eggs.
Telling the topic
English doesn’t have a topic phrase, but if you put a topic phrase at the 
beginning of whatever you say in Japanese, you can sound a lot more like a 
native Japanese speaker. Japanese just love to mention topics at the begin­
ning of their sentences.
At the very beginning of a statement, clarify what you’re talking about — in 
other words, state the topic of the sentence. You need to provide the listener 
with a heads up: What I’ll say from now is about topic, As for topic, or Speaking 
of topic. Use the particle wa (wah) to mark the topic word. Sorry, but use the 
hiragana は (hah) and not わ (wah) to represent the particle wa (wah).
Suppose you’re talking about what you did yesterday. You start with the 
word for yesterday, kinō (kee-nohh), and add wa after the word to alert the 
listener that yesterday is your topic and that you’re going to say something 
about it in the rest of the sentence.
The following sentences differ in what the speaker is talking about. The state­
ment can be about what happened yesterday, about what happened to the 
teacher, or about what happened to John, depending on what precedes wa:
昨日は先生がジョンを叱った。 Kinō wa sensei ga Jon o shikatta. (kee-
nohh wah sehn-sehh gah john oh shee-kaht-tah.) (As for yesterday, what 
happened is that the teacher scolded John.)
先生は昨日ジョンを叱った。 Sensei wa kinō Jon o shikatta. (sehn-sehh 
wah kee-nohh john oh shee-kaht-tah.) (As for the teacher, what he did yes­
terday was to scold John.)
ジョンは先生が昨日叱った。 Jon wa sensei ga kinō shikatta. (john wah 
sehn-sehh gah kee-nohh shee-kaht-tah.) (As for John, what happened to 
him was that the teacher scolded him yesterday.)

39
 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
	
Any noun can be the topic. The subject noun can be the topic, and the object 
noun can be the topic, too. When a noun is both the subject of the sentence 
and the topic of the sentence, use only the topic particle wa — never ga wa — 
to mark the noun as both the subject and the topic. In the same way, when a 
noun is the direct object as well as the topic, mark it with just wa — never with 
both o and wa. However, wa can follow other particles, as in ni wa and de wa.
Dropping understood words
You may have the impression that Japanese people are diligent and hard 
working — and that is certainly true in many areas — but when it comes 
to speaking, the Japanese use the minimum number of words necessary to 
convey their meaning. Minimalist speaking is the Japanese way.
One way to pare down sentences is to drop pronouns and words that are under­
stood in the context, and Japanese drop both almost all the time. As a result, 
you often hear sentences without a subject, a direct object, a time phrase, or a 
location phrase. A sentence that consists of just the verb or a question that con­
sists of just the topic isn’t uncommon. For example, you don’t need to say the 
words and phrases in the parentheses in the Chinese part of the following mini-
dialgogues.
Speaker A: 昨日はテニスをしましたか。 Kinō wa tenisu o shimashita 
ka. (kee-nohh wah teh-nee-soo oh shee-mah-shee-tah kah.) (Did you play 
tennis yesterday?)
Speaker B: はい，（ 私は昨日テニスを）しました。 Hai, (watashi wa 
kinō tenisu o) shimashita. (hah-ee, [wah-tah-shee wah kee-nohh teh-nee-
soo oh] shee-mah-shee-tah.) (Yes, I played tennis yesterday.)
Speaker A: （あなたは今日私の）うちに来ますか。 (Anata wa kyō 
watashi no) uchi ni kimasu ka. ([ah-nah-tah wah kyohh wah-tah-shee 
noh] oo-chee nee kee-mah-soo kah.) (Will you come to my house today?)
Speaker B: はい。 Hai. (hah-ee.) (Yes.)
Speaker A:  ホットドッグは（食べますか)。 Hotto doggu wa (tabemasu 
ka). (hoht-toh dohg-goo wah [tah-beh-mah-soo kah].) (Will you eat a 
hot dog?)
Speaker B: ああ， いいですね。 Ā, ii desu ne. (ahh, eee-deh-soo neh.) 
(Oh, that’s great.)
Asking Questions
If you can form a sentence, you can easily form a question in Japanese. Unlike 
in English, you don’t have to invert the subject and the verb when you ask a 
question in Japanese. And you don’t use question marks, either.

40
Part I: Getting Started 
How you form a question depends on whether you’re expecting a yes or no 
answer or a specific piece of information such as a name, place, date, or 
person. I discuss each case in the following subsections.
Yes/no questions
	
To form a question that you expect a yes or no answer to, just add the ques­
tion particle ka (kah) at the end of the statement sentence and use a rising 
intonation, just as you do in English. For example, Jon wa kimasu. (john wah 
kee-mah-soo.) means John will come., and Jon wa kimasu ka. (john wah kee-
mah-soo kah.) means Will John come?
Content questions
To ask a question that expects specific information or content as an answer, 
use a question word in addition to the question particle ka at the end of the 
sentence. Just like in English, you use different question words depending on 
what you’re asking. Table 3-3 provides more information on question words.

Getting a Handle on Pronouns
Pronouns are convenient shorthand for nouns that both English and 
Japanese make good use of. Check out the following instruction, where I itali­
cized all the pronouns:
Mix those together like this, leave it right there for a while, and then give it 
to him with that.
Makes you realize how convenient pronouns are, doesn’t it? And take it from 
me, they become even more useful when your short-term memory worsens 
as you age and you start referring to everything as “that,” “it,” and “her.”
Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns seems like much too big a phrase to talk about four 
little words: this, that, these, and those. Think about the donut shop. You 
point at all the goodies and say, “I want six of these, two of those, and that 
big one right there.” You use demonstrative pronouns to point verbally. In 
Japanese, things are just a little more complicated than they are in English.
Suppose you’re the speaker and your girlfriend is the listener, and just the 
two of you are sitting face to face at a cozy table in a fancy restaurant. How 
romantic! In this case, the half of the table on your side is your territory, and 
the other half on your girlfriend’s side is her territory. “Territory” is a strange 
word in this context, but it gives you a clear idea. Any other tables in the 
restaurant are outside of both your territories. With these boundaries drawn, 
you can use the following pronouns when referring to various foods through­
out the restaurant.
	
✓	これ kore (koh-reh): Things in your territory
	
✓	それ sore (soh-reh): Things in her territory
	
✓	あれ are (ah-reh): Things outside of both your territories
Do you get the idea? If you do, you can understand who is eating tako (tah-
koh) (octopus), who is eating ika (ee-kah) (squid), and who is eating awabi 
(ah-wah-bee) (abalone) at the Japanese restaurant in the following Talkin’ the 
Talk dialogue. (Note that abalone is a type of shellfish.)

Personal pronouns
The first-person singular pronoun in Japanese is watashi (wah-tah-shee), and 
it corresponds to the English I and me. Japanese does have other personal 
pronouns, which you can check out in Table 3-4.
Table 3-4

Note: Although the first-person singular pronoun is typically watashi, you 
can say I/me more than one way. The formal version is watakushi (wah-
tah-koo-shee). Men say boku (boh-koo) in informal and neutral contexts. In 
informal contexts, some men say ore (oh-reh), some older men say washi 
(wah-shee), and some young women say atashi (ah-tah-shee).
	
Never use ore, washi, and atashi when talking with your teacher, boss, cus­
tomer, or client. Boku isn’t that bad, but watashi is safer in formal situations.
	
Japanese use the first-person pronouns repeatedly in conversations, but they 
often don’t use other pronouns. In fact, the use of anata is almost forbidden. 
The person who says anata sounds snobby, arrogant, or just foreign. So how 
can you ask a question like Will you go there? without using anata? One strat­
egy is to drop the pronoun (see the “Dropping understood words” section 
earlier in this chapter). Just use the verb and the question particle: Ikimasu 
ka. (ee-kee-mah-soo kah.) (Will [you] go [there]?). Another strategy to avoid 

45
 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
anata is to repeatedly use the person’s name. You can ask Yōko this question: 
Yōko-san, Yōko-san wa ikimasu ka. (yohh-koh-sahn, yohh-koh-sahn wah ee-
kee-mah-soo kah.) (Yoko, are you going there? [Literally: Yoko, is Yoko going?])
Working with Verbs
The Japanese language places a lot of emphasis on verbs. Verbs not only 
express certain actions or states of being but also indicate social status, 
respect, and humility. You can often tell whether Japanese are talking to an 
esteemed guest, a colleague, a spouse, or even a dog just by the verb they 
use. Throughout this book, I use examples of plain/informal verbs, polite/
neutral verbs, and formal verbs. However, the most common verbs are in 
the plain/informal and polite/neutral categories. (Head to the earlier section 
“Using Appropriate Speech Styles” for information on these designations.)
“So how do I conjugate these verbs?” you ask. Good news! You don’t need to con­
jugate verbs based on person, gender, or number in Japanese. You use the same 
form of a verb regardless of who’s performing the action. For example, you use 
the verb taberu (tah-beh-roo) whether you want to say I eat, you eat, he eats, she 
eats, or they eat. “That’s great,” you’re thinking — no conjugation tables to memo­
rize. Not so fast. I’m not saying that Japanese verbs don’t conjugate at all; they 
do. In this section, I walk you through the various conjugations, showing you how 
to create present, past, negative, and polite verbs (and combinations of these). If 
you get confused, you can always check out the verb tables in Appendix B.
Understanding basic verb forms
Japanese speakers use four basic verb forms frequently: the dictionary form, 
the nai-form, the stem form, and the te-form. The other forms of a verb can be 
easily created by making a minor adjustment to one of these forms.
	
Throughout the book, when I introduce a new verb, I give you these four 
forms in this order — dictionary, nai-, stem, and te-forms — along with the 
pronunciation. After the stem form, I add ます masu because you’ll be hear­
ing this form with ます masu all the time. The following is an example with 
taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat):

I describe each form in greater detail in the sections that follow.

46
Part I: Getting Started 
Dictionary form
The dictionary form, or plain present affirmative, is kind of like an infinitive in 
English, but without the to. You see this verb form when you look up words 
in the dictionary.
All dictionary forms end in one of the syllables ぶ bu (boo), む mu (moo), ぬ 
nu (noo), ぐ gu (goo), く ku (koo), る ru (roo), す su (soo), つ tsu (tsoo), and 
う u (oo). Did you notice that they all include the vowel u?
You use the dictionary form when the verb is placed before a noun or some 
particle as well as before some grammatical items listed in the “Expressing 
Moods and Attitudes” section and the “Adverb-like sentences” section later in 
this chapter. Just watch out. Using the dictionary form at the end of a sentence 
makes you sound rude in a formal context. You can use it without worry in an 
informal context, like when you’re talking with your family, friends, or pet.
Nai-form
The nai-form, or plain present negative, is the negative counterpart of the 
dictionary form. For example, if the dictionary form means I do, the nai-form 
means I don’t. All nai-forms end in nai (nah-ee).
Stem form
The stem form is the shortest pronounceable form of a verb, and it can be 
tightly combined with grammatical items such as masu, nagara, ni, and tai 
and with words such as nikui, sugiru, tsuzukeru, and yasui (just to name a 
few) to form a compound verb or adjective. To show you what they mean, 
check out the following examples featuring tabe (tah-beh), the stem form of 
the verb taberu:
食べます tabe-masu (tah-beh-mah-soo) (to eat [polite])
食べながら tabe-nagara (tah-beh-nah-gah-rah) (while eating)
食べに tabe ni (tah-beh nee) (in order to eat)
食べたい tabe-tai (tah-beh-tah-ee) (to want to eat)
食べにくい tabe-nikui (tah-beh-nee-koo-ee) (to be difficult to eat)
食べすぎる tabe-sugiru (tah-beh-soo-gee-roo) (to eat too much)
食べつづける tabe-tsuzukeru (tah-beh-tsoo-zoo-keh-roo) (to continue to eat)
食べやすい tabe-yasui (tah-beh-yah-soo-ee) (to be easy to eat)
Because the stem form is used right before the most frequently used verb 
suffix, masu, it’s also called the pre-masu form. See the “Speaking Politely” 
section in this chapter for more about masu.

47
 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
Te-form
Called the te-form because it ends in te (teh) or its variant, de (deh), this 
verb form means do . . . and, and is used to connect the verb with other verbs 
and adjectives. For example, to connect the three verbs taberu, nomu (noh-
moo) (to drink), and neru (neh-roo) (to sleep) to mean to eat, drink, and go 
to bed, you make all verbs except for the last one the te-forms as in tabete, 
nonde, neru (tah-beh-teh, nohn-deh, neh-roo).
Te-forms are also necessary right before many auxiliary verbs, such as kudasai, 
iru, miru, oku, and shimau, which refine what the speaker wants to express. See 
how these auxiliary verbs can follow tabete, the te-form of the verb taberu:
食べてください。 Tabete kudasai. (tah-beh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee) 
(Please eat.)
食べている tabete iru (tah-beh-teh ee-roo) (to be eating)
食べてみる tabete miru (tah-beh-teh mee-roo) (to try eating)
食べておく tabete oku (tah-beh-teh oh-koo) (to eat in advance)
食べてしまう tabete shimau (tah-beh-teh shee-mah-oo) (to eat up)
Doing the conjugation thing
As in English, Japanese has regular and irregular verbs. All regular verbs 
conjugate according to a predictable pattern, whereas irregular verbs deviate 
from the pattern to a greater or lesser extent. Luckily, most verbs are regular. 
The following sections help you conjugate various kinds of verbs in the past 
and present, as well as form negative verbs.
Conjugating verbs
	
Regular verbs come in two basic types: ru-verbs and u-verbs. Before you 
can conjugate any regular verb, you have to determine which type you’re 
dealing with.
	
✓	If you don’t see eru or iru at the end of the dictionary form of a verb, 
you can relax and trust that it’s an u-verb.
	
✓	If the verb ends in eru or iru, you need to be on alert because it can be 
either a ru-verb or an u-verb.
For example, kaeru (kah-eh-roo) is either a ru-verb (meaning change) or an 
u-verb (meaning go home). Similarly, kiru (kee-roo) is either a ru-verb (mean­
ing wear) or an u-verb (meaning cut). The distinction is important because 
these verbs conjugate differently depending on the form. Ru-verbs are sort of 
more stable verbs conjugation-wise because the stem-form appears in every 
form. U-verbs are a bit more complex: They add one more sound or one more 
syllable in the nai-, stem, and te-forms.

48

Table 3-5 lists representative ru-verbs, u-verbs, and irregular verbs and includes 
these tricky eru/iru verbs (kaeru and kiru pairs), so you can check them out!

 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
To conjugate a ru-verb, you drop the ru (roo) at the end of its dictionary 
form and add something or nothing. By contrast, to conjugate an u-verb, 
you drop the u (oo) and always add something. (Maybe I should call them 
ru-dropping verbs and u-dropping verbs. First drop something and then add 
something or nothing!)
For conjugating a verb, check the ending syllable and the type of the verb, 
and then follow the pattern of one of the verbs in Table 3-5. But which one? 
Pick the one with the same ending syllable and the same verb type. By the 
ending syllable, I mean the last syllable, not the last sound. That is, the last 
consonant and vowel combination. If no consonant precedes the last vowel 
(for example, as in the word kau), the last vowel by itself is the ending syl­
lable of the verb.
	
Nai-forms and stem forms are pretty easy to make, but te-forms aren’t if the 
verb is an u-verb, right? Here are some rules of thumb that can make Japanese 
verb conjugations easier:
	
✓	For u-verbs whose dictionary forms end in うu, る ru, or つ tsu, replace 
these ending syllables with って tte.
	
✓	For u-verbs whose dictionary forms end in む mu, ぬ nu, or ぶ bu, 
replace these ending syllables with んで nde.
	
✓	For u-verbs whose dictionary forms end in す su, replace す su with して
shite.
	
✓	For u-verbs whose dictionary forms end in く ku or ぐ gu, replace them 
with いて ite and いで ide, respectively.
	
✓	For the two major irregular verbs, くる kuru (to come) and する suru (to 
do), as well as the verb いく iku (to go), simply remember their te-forms, 
which are きて kite, して shite, and いって itte. 
	
✓	For ru-verbs, just replace the る ru at the end of the dictionary form 
with て te.
Deciding between present and past tense
	
Japanese verbs have just two tenses: present and past. However, these grammar 
terms are misleading. Present tense in Japanese refers to actions that regularly 
take place or will take place in the future, which makes the verb taberu not just I 
eat but also I will eat. For this reason, some people call the present tense the non-
past tense. Usually, the context tells you which meaning the verb is expressing. 
As in English, the present tense often doesn’t refer to this very moment, but to 
some habitual action, such as I eat dinner every day at 6:00.
Forming the present and past tenses
Creating the present tense of a Japanese verb is a no-brainer: It’s just the 
dictionary form. If you know a verb’s te-form, expressing that verb in the past 
tense is still pretty easy. You simply change the final vowel; because you’re 

50
Part I: Getting Started 
working with the te-form, you’re always changing an e to an a. For example, 
tabete becomes tabeta (tah-beh-tah) (ate), and nonde (nohn-deh) becomes 
nonda (nohn-dah) (drank).
Creating negative past tense verbs
In order to say that you didn’t do something in the past, you need to be able 
to fashion verbs into their negative past forms. No problem. It’s easy. Simply 
take the nai-form, drop the final vowel i, and add -katta. For example, tabe­
nai (tah-beh-nah-ee) (don’t eat) becomes tabenakatta (tah-beh-nah-kaht-tah) 
(didn’t eat). Cool, huh?
Speaking politely with –masu
In Japanese, the verbs you choose to use say a lot about you. Using the 
plain/informal verb forms — specifically, dictionary forms, nai-forms, and 
their past counterparts (which I discuss in the earlier “Doing the conjuga­
tion thing” section) — is sufficient when you talk with close friends or family 
members. However, using them in a business situation or with strangers 
may make the listener think you’re unsophisticated or even rude. The ability 
to judge the situation and know what level of formality is appropriate is an 
integral part of speaking Japanese. That’s why it’s worth knowing another 
set of conjugation patterns that use the polite suffix masu to make the polite/
neutral verb forms. 
Conjugating with -masu is easy if you know the stem form of verbs (I tell you 
about this verb form in the earlier related section). You just have to remem­
ber four verb endings (one each for affirmative present, negative present, 
affirmative past, and negative past), and add one of them to the end of the 
verb in the stem form.
	
✓	For affirmative present verbs, add -masu. For example, 食べます tabe­
masu (tah-beh-mah-soo) (eats) or 飲みます nomimasu (noh-mee-mah-
soo) (drinks).
	
✓	For negative present verbs, add -masen. For example, 食べません tabe­
masen (tah-beh-mah-sehn) (doesn’t eat) or 飲みません nomimasen (noh-
mee-mah-sehn) (doesn’t drink).
	
✓	For affirmative past verbs, add -mashita. For example, 食べました tabe­
mashita (tah-beh-mah-shee-tah) (ate) or 飲みました nomimashita (noh-
mee-mah-shee-tah) (drank).
	
✓	For negative past verbs, add -masen deshita. For example, 食べませんで
した tabemasen deshita (tah-beh-mah-sehn deh-shee-tah) (didn’t eat), 飲
みませんでした nomimasen deshita (noh-mee-mah-sehn deh-shee-tah) 
(didn’t drink).

 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
Introducing the Verb Desu, to Be
Like the English verb to be, desu (deh-soo) expresses the identity or state 
of people and things. Desu is used in the construction X wa Y desu. (X 
wah Y deh-soo.) (X is Y.). (As I note earlier in the chapter, the conventional 
Japanese sentence order is X Y is, not X is Y. The particle wa [wah] is the 
topic particle I discuss in the earlier section “Telling the topic.”)
Desu follows either a noun or an adjective. For example, Otōto wa gakusei 
desu. (oh-tohh-toh wah gah-koo-sehh deh-soo.) means My little brother is 
a student. Watashi wa genki desu. (wah-tah-shee wah gehn-kee deh-soo.) 
means I am fine. Now you know why many Japanese sentences end in desu. 
And like the English verb to be, desu can also express the location of people 
and things. For example, Jon wa Bosuton desu. (john wah boh-soo-tohn deh-
soo.) means John is in Boston. Just be aware that you can also express the 
location of things and people using the verbs aru and iru. To find out more 
about aru and iru, see Chapter 7.
Conjugation-wise, desu doesn’t look like any other verb. (That’s because 
desu didn’t start out as a stand-alone verb; it was the combination of the par­
ticle de, the verb aru [ah-roo] [to exist], and the polite suffix -masu.) Table 
3-6 shows you the patterns of desu. To help you see the point easily, I use the 
same noun gakusei (gah-koo-sehh) (student) in each example. If you want to 
know how to use desu after an adjective, see the following section.

In an informal context, you can use the shorter version of desu, as Table 3-7 
demonstrates.

Ja (jah), which you see in the negative forms in Tables 3-6 and 3-7, is the con­
traction of de wa (deh wah). Most Japanese use ja in everyday conversation, 
but occasionally, they use de wa, which sounds a bit more formal. Just be 
ready to hear either of them.

Describing People and 
Things with Adjectives
As in English, you can place Japanese adjectives either before a noun as a 
noun modifier (an expensive book, for example) or at the end of a sentence 
(The book is expensive.).
Believe it or not, all Japanese adjectives end in either i or na when they’re 
placed before a noun (except some categories of adjectives, namely no-
adjectives, which I don’t cover here because they pattern like nouns). 
Adjectives that end in i are called i-type adjectives, and those that end in na 
are called na-type adjectives. I-type adjectives are pure adjectives, but na-type 
adjectives are a sort of “noun” followed by na. There’s really no clear-cut 
distinction between the two groups in terms of meaning. For example, takai 
(tah-kah-ee) and kōka na (kohh-kah nah) both mean expensive, but one is an 
i-type adjective and the other is a na-type adjective.
Look at some adjectives that modify the noun hon (hohn) (book):
	
✓	高い本 takai hon (tah-kah-ee hohn) (an expensive book)
	
✓	おもしろい本 omoshiroi hon (oh-moh-shee-roh-ee hohn) (an interesting 
book)
	
✓	高価な本 kōka na hon (kohh-kah nah hohn) (a high-priced book)
	
✓	便利な本 benri na hon (behn-ree nah hohn) (a useful book)
	
✓	きれいな本 kirei na hon (kee-rehh nah hohn) (a beautiful book)

54
Part I: Getting Started 
	
Japanese adjectives consist of a stem (the part that remains the same) and an 
inflection part (the part that changes depending on the context). The endings i 
and na are inflection parts.
English adjectives conjugate based on whether they’re comparative or super­
lative, like tall, taller, and tallest, but Japanese adjectives conjugate based 
on different factors. For example, when the adjectives appear at the end of a 
sentence rather than before a noun, the i and na change or disappear, and an 
extra item like the verb desu (deh-soo) (to be) shows up in various forms, all 
of which depend on the tense, the polarity (whether the statement is affirma­
tive or negative), or the speech style.
Look at the following sentences, all of which either include takai, an i-type 
adjective, or kōka na, a na-type adjective:
あれは高価じゃありません。 Are wa kōka ja arimasen. (ah-reh wah 
kohh-kah jah ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (That isn’t high-priced.)
ハンバーガーは高くありません。 Hanbāgā wa takaku arimasen. (hahn-
bahh-gahh wah tah-kah-koo ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (Hamburgers aren’t 
expensive.)
高価なネックレスを買いました。 Kōka na nekkuresu o kaimashita. 
(kohh-kah nah nehk-koo-reh-soo oh kah-ee-mah-shee-tah.) (I bought an 
expensive necklace.)
これは高かったです。 Kore wa takakatta desu. (koh-reh wah tah-kah-
kaht-tah deh-soo.) (This was expensive.)
高い本を買いました。 Takai hon o kaimashita. (tah-kah-ee hohn oh kah-
ee-mah-shee-tah.) (I bought an expensive book.)

Of course, some Japanese adjectives are irregular. The most-frequently used 
irregular adjective is ii (ee-ee) (good). Its stem part is the initial i, and its inflec­
tion part is the second i. The stem part i becomes yo in all the forms except 
the present affirmative form, regardless of whether the adjective appears at 
the end of a sentence or right before a noun. Here are some examples:
いい本です ii hon desu (ee-ee hohn deh-soo) (is a good book)
いいです ii desu (ee-ee deh-soo) (is good)
よかったです yokatta desu (yoh-kaht-tah deh-soo) (was good)
よくありませんでした yoku arimasendeshita (yoh-koo ah-ree-mah-sehn 
deh-shee-tah) (wasn’t good)
よくありません yoku arimasen (yoh-koo ah-ree-mah-sen) (isn’t good)

56
Part I: Getting Started 
	
In this book, when I list an adjective in the Words to Know section, I list i-type 
adjectives and na-type adjectives in the form you see before a noun, but I put 
na in the parentheses. When you use a Japanese dictionary, na-type adjectives 
often appear in their stem form, without na.
Using Adverbs to Describe Your Actions
Just as adjectives describe how people and things are, adverbs describe how 
actions are performed. Japanese adverbs fall into two categories: the ones 
that are created from adjectives and the ones that aren’t. I tell you about 
both types of adverbs, as well as adverbial clauses, in the next sections.
Creating adverbs from adjectives
Notice anything special about the words slowly, quickly, pleasantly, neatly, and 
quietly? They’re all adverbs created from adjectives by adding -ly! In Japanese, 
you can also create adverbs from adjectives. Just add ku (koo) and ni (nee) to 
the stem of an i-type adjective and a na-type adjective, respectively. (I tell you 
about i-type adjectives and na-type adjectives in the earlier “Describing People 
and Things with Adjectives” section.) Table 3-9 shows you what I mean.

Perusing pure adverbs
Unlike the adverbs that are created from adjectives (see the preceding sec­
tion), some adverbs are just born as adverbs. For example
	
✓	ちょっと chotto (choht-toh) (slightly, a little)
	
✓	いつも itsumo (ee-tsoo-moh) (always)
	
✓	もう mō (mohh) (already)

57
 Chapter 3: Warming Up with Japanese Grammar Basics
	
✓	たいてい taitei (tah-ee-tehh) (usually)
	
✓	ときどき tokidoki (toh-kee-doh-kee) (sometimes)
	
✓	ゆっくり yukkuri (yook-koo-ree) (slowly)
The adverb-version of ii (ee-ee) (good) is yoku (yoh-koo) (well).
Turning to sentence-like adverbs
You can describe the action or state by using a sentence-like adverb, or an 
adverbial clause, to express its circumstances. For example, kara designates 
reasons for an action, and toki ni states the time of an action. Reasons can be 
stated by a sentence, such as because I will go to Japan. The time of an action 
can also be stated by a sentence, such as when I take an exam.
日本に行きますから, 日本語を勉強します。 Nihon ni ikimasu kara, 
Nihongo o benkyō shimasu. (nee-hohn nee ee-kee-mah-soo kah-rah, 
nee-hohn-goh oh behn-kyohh shee-mah-soo.) (Because I’ll go to Japan, I’ll 
study Japanese.)
日本が好きですから, 日本語を勉強します。 Nihon ga suki desu kara, 
Nihongo o benkyō shimasu. (nee-hohn gah soo-kee deh-soo kah-rah, nee-
hohn-goh oh behn-kyohh shee-mah-soo.) (Because I like Japan, I’ll study 
Japanese.)
試験を受けるときに, 勉強します。 Shiken o ukeru toki ni, benkyō shi­
masu. (shee-kehn oh oo-keh-roo toh-kee nee, behn-kyohh shee-mah-soo.) 
(When I take an exam, I study.)
静かなときに, 勉強します。 Shizuka na toki ni, benkyō shimasu. (shee-
zoo-kah nah toh-kee nee, behn-kyohh shee-mah-soo.) (When it’s quiet, I 
study.)
These are only a couple of the many kinds of adverbial clauses, but I show 
you the others throughout the book as they become relevant so you can get 
a better idea of how to use them in context.
Expressing Moods and Attitudes
To express your attitude toward your statement, you add some little ele­
ments at the end of your sentence (like you’d add right? or you know? to an 
English sentence). Here, I’ve listed the most useful ones, with example sen­
tences so you’ll know how to use them.

Chapter 4
Starting with Simple Expressions
In This Chapter
▶	Greeting friends and strangers
▶	Introducing introductions
▶	Saying “Thank you” and “I’m sorry”
K

onnichiwa! (kohn-nee-chee-wa!) (Good afternoon!/Hi! ) Greetings like 
this one are basic expressions you can use to kick off conversations 
with people you know. For those you don’t know, you can introduce yourself 
and find out more about them by engaging in light conversation. This chapter 
shows you how to form greetings, introductions, and good-byes in Japanese. 
It also describes how to interact politely with new people and tell someone 
Thank you or Sorry.
Beginning (And Ending) Conversations
Aisatsu (ah-ee-sah-tsoo) (greetings) are the most important communication 
tools. Start your day with a friendly and cheerful greeting to your family, 
friends, colleagues, teachers, bosses, and even strangers on the street. In the 
following sections, you find out how to greet all kinds of people all through­
out the day. And because you inevitably have to say good-bye to the people 
you encounter during your day, you also discover how to do just that.
Addressing friends and strangers
In English, you address others by their first names (“Hi, Robert!”), by their 
nicknames (“Hey, Bobby!”), by their positions (“Excuse me, professor”), or 
by their family names and an appropriate title (“Hello, Mr. Right”), depending 
on your relationship and how close you are to that person. You don’t want 
to sound too formal or distant, but you don’t want to sound too friendly or 
presumptuous, either.

62
Part I: Getting Started 
	
In Japanese society, addressing people is something that you don’t want to 
mess up. When you meet someone new at work and you know the person’s 
occupational title (such as company president, professor, or division man­
ager), use the title along with his or her family name — for example, Sumisu-
shachō (soo-mee-soo-shah-chohh) (President Smith). Following are some 
examples of occupational titles:
	
✓	部長 buchō (boo-chohh) (division manager)
	
✓	学長 gakuchō (gah-koo-chohh) (university president)
	
✓	校長 kōchō (kohh-chohh) (school principal)
	
✓	先生 sensei (sehn-sehh) (teacher, doctor)
	
✓	社長 shachō (shah-chohh) (company president)
	
✓	店長 tenchō (tehn-chohh) (store manager)
If you don’t know the person’s occupational title, the safest way to address 
him or her is to use his or her family name plus the respectful title -san 
(sahn) — Sumisu-san (soo-mee-soo-sahn) (Mr. Smith or Ms. Smith). The more 
polite version of -san is -sama (sah-mah), but it’s too formal and businesslike 
for most social situations. Other respectful titles include -chan (chahn) and 
-kun (koon), but you must use them very carefully. Check out Table 4-1 to see 
which titles are appropriate for your friends and acquaintances. The table 
contains examples of various ways you may address Robert (Robāto) and 
Susan (Sūzan) Smith (Sumisu).

When introducing themselves, Japanese (as well as Chinese and Koreans) 
give their family names first and given names last. Most Japanese realize that 
Western names aren’t in the same order, and they won’t expect you to reverse 
the order of your own name to match the pattern of their names. Many 
Japanese also realize that Westerners tend to use their given names a lot, but 
you should use the family name for all but your closest friends and family.
If you use the Japanese word for you — anata (ah-nah-tah) — you’ll sound 
boastful or rude. Japanese people try not to say anata; instead, they just 
drop pronouns or use names or titles (whereas English uses you). If you visit 
a Japanese store, you’ll notice that the store representatives address you 
with okyaku-sama (oh-kyah-koo-sah-mah) (customer), just because they don’t 
want to say anata. Instead of you, you can use interesting age- and gender-
sensitive terms when addressing strangers in friendly contexts. For example, 
ojisan (oh-jee-sahn) literally means uncle, but you can use it to casually 
address any unfamiliar middle-aged man. The following list shows other 
general descriptions of strangers and the Japanese terms you can use to 
address them:

64
Part I: Getting Started 
	
✓	おばさん obasan (oh-bah-sahn) (middle-aged woman [Literally: aunt])
	
✓	おじいさん ojīsan (oh-jeee-sahn) (old man [Literally: grandfather])
	
✓	おばあさん obāsan (oh-bahh-sahn) (old woman [Literally: grandmother])
	
✓	坊や bōya; お坊ちゃん obocchan (bohh-yah; oh-boht-chahn) (young boy 
[Literally: son])
	
✓	お嬢さん ojōsan (oh-johh-sah) (young girl [Literally: daughter])
	
✓	お兄さん onīsan (oh-neee-sahn) (young man [Literally: big brother])
	
✓	お姉さん onēsan (oh-nehh-sahn) (young woman [Literally: big sister])
	
Well-educated Japanese adults use the ice-breaking idiom otaku (oh-tah-koo) 
(Literally: your household), but it has a limitation; you can’t simply say otaku 
as you’d use Hey, you! to get someone’s attention. You can only use otaku in a 
sentence, as in Otaku wa dochira kara desu ka. (oh-tah-koo wah doh-chee-rah 
kah-rah deh-soo kah.) (Where are you from?). Just note that youngsters have 
been using otaku as a negative label for someone obsessed with comic books 
and the like, so use the term carefully.
Greeting all day long
In Japanese, as in every other language, what you say and do to greet people 
depends on the time of the day and the person you’re greeting.
	
✓	In the morning, as you greet family and friends, say ohayō (oh-hah-
yohh), the informal version of good morning. As you greet your boss or 
teacher, or even your colleagues, use the formal ohayō gozaimasu (oh-
hah-yohh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo) — and don’t forget to bow as you say it. 
Check out the nearby sidebar “Bowing” for more on this custom.
	
✓	In the afternoon, say konnichiwa (kohn-nee-chee-wah) (good afternoon) 
to everyone, regardless of their position and status.
	
✓	When you can see the stars or the moon in the sky, say konbanwa 
(kohn-bahn-wah), regardless of whom you greet. It means good evening.
	
If you haven’t seen someone in a while, ask him or her O-genki desu ka. (oh-
gehn-kee deh-soo kah.) (Are you well? or How are you?) as well. When others 
ask you O-genki desu ka., you can say Hai, genki desu. (hah-ee, gehn-kee 
deh-soo.) (I’m fine.), but if you want to sound a bit more sophisticated, say 
Hai, okagesama de. (hah-ee oh-kah-geh-sah-mah-deh.) (Yes, I’m fine thanks 
to you and God.) or Nantoka. (nahn-toh-kah.) (I’m barely managing things 

65
 Chapter 4: Starting with Simple Expressions
in my life or I’m barely coping.). Those two expressions sound very modest 
and mature to Japanese, even though the last one sounds pretty negative to 
American ears.
	
English speakers make a habit of asking everyone, “How are you?” even if they 
saw the person the day before. O-genki desu ka is a serious question about a 
person’s mental and physical health, so don’t use it when greeting someone 
you saw yesterday. Say it when you mean it.
Saying goodbye
When you leave a friend, say jā, mata (jahh, mah-tah) (see you again). You 
can also say sayōnara (sah-yohh-nah-rah) (goodbye) if you’re parting for 
a longer period of time, but don’t use this option if you’ll see the person 
later that same day. Otherwise, you can use either phrase or both of them 
together. When you interact with your boss or teacher, say jā, mata and 
shitsurei shimasu (shee-tsoo-rehh shee-mah-soo). Shitsurei shimasu literally 
means I’ll be rude. How do you get goodbye out of I’ll be rude? It’s as if you’re 
saying I’m being rude by leaving your presence.
	
Don’t say sayōnara or shitsurei shimasu to your family members when you 
leave home for school or work. Instead, say ittekimasu (eet-teh-kee-mah-soo) 
(Literally: I’ll go and come back) — a set phrase for this occasion. Your family 
will respond to you with itterasshai (eet-teh-rahs-shah-ee) (Literally: You go 
and come back!). Just in case, when you get home, say tadaima (tah-dah-ee-
mah) (Literally: just now), which actually means I’m home! Then, your family 
will respond to you with okaeri (oh-kah-eh-ree) (Literally: You got home.). If 
you have trouble memorizing these four phrases, try not to think about their 
literal meanings and instead focus on which phrase applies when leaving 
home and which phrase applies when returning.

67
 Chapter 4: Starting with Simple Expressions
Introducing yourself
The first word to say as you introduce yourself to someone is hajimemashite 
(hah-jee-meh-mah-shee-teh). This word literally means beginning, and it clari­
fies the fact that you’re meeting that person for the very first time. After saying 
hajimemashite, say your name, and then say yoroshiku (yoh-roh-shee-koo). 
Yoroshiku is a set phrase that shows your modest attitude and asks the other 
party to be friendly and nice to you. No English translation exists for it.
	
English speakers just say Pleased to meet you. or I’m very happy to meet you. 
when they meet someone. They don’t beg people to be nice to them as yoro­
shiku does. But when speaking Japanese, do as the Japanese do and say 
yoroshiku. The response to yoroshiku is usually kochira koso (koh-chee-rah 
koh-soh) yoroshiku, meaning It’s I who should say that. So, if you beg someone 
to be friendly, they beg you right back. After all that begging, you’re friends!
The complete formal version of yoroshiku, which is yoroshiku onegai itashi­
masu (yoh-roh-shee-koo oh-neh-gah-ee ee-tah-shee-mah-soo), is frequently 
used in any context where formality is due. So in a business context, you can 
expect to hear yoroshiku onegai itashimasu at the end of every conversation.
Introducing your friends
Your friend can become another friend’s friend if you introduce them to each 
other. When you want to introduce your friend to someone, say kochira wa 
(koh-chee-rah wah) (as for this person), your friend’s name, and the verb 
desu (deh-soo) (is). For example, if you want to say This is John, say Kochira 
wa Jon-san desu. (koh-chee-rah wah john-sahn deh-soo.). (The short suffix 
-san (sahn) after the name Jon [john] [John] is a respectful title; see the 
“Addressing friends and strangers” section earlier in this chapter.)
Here’s my card
Businesspeople frequently exchange cards 
when meeting fellow businesspeople, but in 
Japan, a good deal of etiquette goes along 
with this exchange. First, you must exchange 
cards with just one person at a time. Make 
sure to give and receive with both hands and 
present the card so that the lettering faces the 
receiver. Also, don’t put the card you receive in 
your wallet right away. You should treat other 
people’s business cards like their faces and 
handle them in the most respectful manner.

As long as I’m talking about introductions, here’s one more tip: Always intro­
duce the person with the lower social status to the person with the higher 
social status.

deh-soo. koh-chee-rah koh-soh yoh-roh-shee-koo.
	
How do you do? I’m Robert Roth. I’m pleased to meet 
you, too.
Bowing
Bowing plays a very important role in Japanese 
communication. Bows almost always accom­
pany phrases expressing gratitude, apology, 
and greeting. Japanese also bow when meeting 
someone for the very first time. Occasionally, 
they shake hands, but most of the time, they just 
bow as they say 宜しく yoroshiku. You don’t 
need to bow very deeply in this context. Just 
slowly tilt your head and upper back slightly 
forward, and hold the position for two seconds. 
The deep, long bow is only needed when you 
make a horrible mistake, receive overwhelm­
ing kindness, or associate with people to whom 
you  have to show a great deal of respect. 
Westerners aren’t expected to bow to be polite, 
but if they do, they’ll certainly receive apprecia­
tion from Japanese. Just make sure not to put 
your hands in your pockets, behind your back, 
or in a fist when bowing.

Asking people their names
Usually, the more people you know, the happier you are. So start asking 
people their names and make friends! As in English, telling someone your 
name when speaking Japanese is more or less a cue for that person to tell 
you his or her name. If it doesn’t turn out that way, you can just ask by saying 
Shitsurei desu ga, o-namae wa. (shee-tsoo-rehh deh-soo gah, oh-nah-mah-eh 
wah.) (I may be rude, but what’s your name?).
	
Your own name is namae, but someone else’s name is o-namae, as I explain in 
the following section.
Being polite with o-
The polite prefix o- is used optionally to show respect to others and their 
things. It’s often translated in English as honorable, which is why a lot of 
Japanese characters in grade-B movies always say honorable this and hon­
orable that. But honorable is a mouthful compared to o-, which attaches to 
words much more naturally.
Sometimes, using o- is obligatory regardless of whether you’re talking about 
yourself or about others. For example, the word for money is kane (kah-neh), 
but people almost always call it okane (oh-kah-neh), even if they’re talking 
about their own money. Only bank robbers and drunks say kane. Likewise, tea 
and souvenir should be ocha (oh-chah) and omiyage (oh-mee-yah-geh), respec­
tively, no matter what. Some differences with this concept exist, depending on 
the geographic area of Japan you’re in, but I won’t go into those here.

70
Part I: Getting Started 
Finding Out About Your New Friend
After an introduction, chat a little so that you and your new acquaintance 
get to know each other better. You can talk about where you’re from and 
perhaps make a connection on that basis. A small conversation can mark the 
beginning of a friendship. The following sections show you how to ask where 
one is from and how to comment on someone’s language skills — two topics 
that you can most likely talk about with your new friend.
	
When someone is telling you something, you can’t just stare at him or her. You 
must nod. You can also say Ā, sō desu ka. (ahh, sohh deh-soo kah.), which 
means Oh, is that so? Oh, really? or Oh, I see. Or you can just say Ā (ahh), as 
you nod, to convey the same message. By doing so, you acknowledge the infor­
mation given to you by your conversational partner. If you don’t do it, your part­
ner may start to think that you’re feeling upset, being rude, or daydreaming.
Asking people where they’re from
When you meet someone, a natural question is Where are you from? Pose this 
question by saying Dochira kara desu ka. (doh-chee-rah kah-rah deh-soo 
kah.). Dochira is the polite form of doko (doh-koh) (where). The particle kara 
means from. (I cover particles in Chapter 3.) To answer the question Dochira 
kara desu ka, you just replace dochira with a place name and drop the ques­
tion particle ka, as Ken and Susan do in the nearby Talkin’ the Talk dialogue.
	
Don’t you realize that the world is small when you find out the person you’ve 
just met is from the same city or graduated from the same high school? In 
such contexts, you need to know how to say Me too! To say too or also, use the 
particle mo (moh). For example, Watashi mo Tōkyō kara desu. (wah-tah-shee 
moh tohh-kyohh kah-rah deh-soo.) (I’m from Tokyo, too.)
Talkin’ the Talk
	
Ken Yamada has just introduced himself to Susan Brennan at their 
mutual friend’s house. Ken asks Susan where she’s from. (Track 9)

In the preceding Talkin’ the Talk, Ken uses boku (boh-koo) when referring to 
himself instead of saying watashi (wah-tah-shee). Men and boys often substi­
tute boku for watashi, which is neither very formal nor very informal. (Turn 
to Chapter 3 to read about formal and informal speech styles.) Ken also says 
Sūzan-san twice, which may sound strange to you. The first Sūzan-san is to 
get Susan’s attention, and the second Sūzan-san is used to mean you. See 
Chapter 3 for more on avoiding the pronoun anata (ah-nah-tah) (you).

Talking about your language skills
Whenever you speak Nihongo (nee-hohn-goh) (the Japanese language) to 
Nihonjin (nee-hohn-jeen) (Japanese people), they’ll say Nihongo ga jōzu 
desu ne! (nee-hohn-goh gah johh-zoo deh-soo neh!) (Your Japanese is great!). 
Because Japan is a society where being bilingual is considered very special 
and admirable, Japanese are always impressed if you speak Japanese. They 
appreciate your effort to study and use their language.
As a reply to a compliment on your Japanese skills, you can say dōmo (dohh-
moh) (thank you), or you can choose one of the following modest phrases. 
It’s up to you.
	
✓	いいえ, 下手です。 Īe, heta desu. (eee-eh, heh-tah deh-soo.) (No, I’m bad.)
	
✓	いいえ, まだまだです。 Īe, madamada desu. (eee-eh, mah-dah-mah-dah 
deh-soo.) (No, not yet, not yet.)
	
✓	いいえ, ぜんぜん。 Īe, zenzen. (eee-eh, zehn-zehn.) (No, not at all.)
If you reply modestly using one of these expressions, the Japanese person 
will be further impressed by your ability and praise your Japanese again. 
Don’t feel like you need to keep denying your compliment forever, though. 
Try not to deny your compliment more than ten times. If you don’t, your con­
versation partner will be exhausted! After a few times of denying, you can just 
smile and stop denying.
	
Even Japanese people who possess a very high degree of English proficiency 
often still say such modest phrases when they’re complimented.
Talkin’ the Talk
	
David has been studying Japanese for two years. He sits at the 
counter in a Japanese restaurant and chats with a Japanese wait­
ress. (Track 10)
Waitress:	
Nihongo ga jōzu desu ne.
	
nee-hohn-goh gah johh-zoo deh-soo neh.
	
Your Japanese is excellent!
David:

Expressing Gratitude and Regret
Phrases of gratitude and apology are the most important and essential 
phrases in any language. Suppose a stranger holds a door open for you when 
you’re entering a building. What do you say? Suppose you accidentally step 
on someone’s foot. How do you say I’m sorry? The next sections answer these 
questions.
Showing gratitude
You may know the word arigatō (ah-ree-gah-tohh) (thanks), but it’s only 
one way to express gratitude. In fact, you can use arigatō with only family, 
friends, co-workers, and subordinates, plus strangers who look easygoing 
and younger than you. For everyone else (or when in doubt about whether 
arigatō is appropriate), say one of the following instead to mean thank you:
	
✓	ありがとうございます。 Arigatō gozaimasu. (ah-ree-gah-tohh goh-zah-
ee-mah-soo.)
	
✓	どうもありがとうございます。 Dōmo arigatō gozaimasu. (dohh-moh ah-
ree-gah-tohh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo.)
	
✓	どうも。 Dōmo. (dohh-moh.)
	
The easiest phrase of gratitude is dōmo — an adverb that literally means 
indeed or very much but can be understood as thank you. It’s a short, conve­
nient, and yet polite phrase of gratitude that you can use in any context. If you 
want to express a greater-than-normal degree of gratitude, you can use one of 
the longer, more fully-spelled-out phrases, like Arigatō gozaimasu or Dōmo 
arigatō gozaimasu.
Apologizing
To apologize for something you’ve done or for causing someone pain or 
inconvenience, say Dōmo sumimasen. (dohh-moh soo-mee-mah-sehn.) (I’m 
very sorry.) or just Sumimasen. Dōmo is an interesting adverb. Its func­
tion is to make you sound serious, and you can use it with either Arigatō 
gozaimasu. (Thank you.) or Sumimasen. (I’m sorry.). (If you just say dōmo 
by itself, it’s interpreted as thank you but not as sorry.) So watch out! In an 
informal context, Gomennasai. (goh-mehn-nah-sah-ee.) (Sorry.) is just fine for 
apologizing.

75
 Chapter 4: Starting with Simple Expressions
	
Just remember that sumimasen can also be used for geting someone’s atten­
tion. Sumimasen means both I’m sorry and Excuse me, but the context and 
your facial expression help clarify which one you mean. Japanese even say 
sumimasen in contexts where English speakers would say Thank you, as if to 
say Excuse me for making you feel that you had to go through all that trouble.
Speaking about Speaking: 
The Verb Hanasu
How do you feel about starting to speak Japanese? To answer this question, 
you need to know how to say speak in Japanese! Use the verb hanasu (hah-
nah-soo) to mean to speak. Because hanasu doesn’t end in iru/eru, it’s surely 
an u-verb! (I cover the verb types in Chapter 3.) Here’s how you conjugate it.
Japanese Script

The following examples show you how to use hanasu in context:
日本語を話しますか。 Nihongo o hanashimasu ka. (nee-hohn-goh oh 
hah-nah-shee-mah-soo kah.) (Do you speak Japanese?)
あの人とは話しません。 Ano hito to wa hanashimasen. (ah-noh hee-toh 
toh wah hah-nah-shee-mah-sehn.) (I don’t speak with that person.)
人の前で話すのが下手です。 Hito no mae de hanasu no ga heta desu. 
(hee-toh noh mah-eh deh hah-nah-soo noh gah heh-tah deh-soo.) (I’m not 
good at speaking in front of people.)

Getting Your Numbers, Times, 
and Measurements Straight
In This Chapter
▶	Mastering Japanese numbers from 1 to 100,000
▶	Counting and measuring with counters
▶	Indicating the time
▶	Identifying the day
Y

ou probably count and measure a variety of items every day, so quanti­
ties and amounts are essential for doing almost everything in your life. 
Apples, coffee, people, time, distance, temperature — you name it, and it 
likely requires counting or measuring. In this chapter, you find out all about 
Japanese numbers. You also discover how to express times and dates in 
Japanese so you can describe, for example, when you’re going to meet with 
your business partners or when your date should pick you up.
Ichi, Ni, San: Counting in Japanese
In this section, I show you numbers from 1 to 100,000 in Japanese. Think of 
it — you can increase your vocabulary by 100,000 words!
Numbers from 1 to 10
You can master the art of counting from one to ten right now. It’ll be handy 
as you earn your belts at a karate dōjō (kah-rah-teh dohh-johh) (karate 
training hall). At a karate dōjō, they never start from rei (rehh) (zero). They 
always start from ichi (ee-chee) (one) when they punch and kick. Ichi, ni 
(nee) (two), san (sahn) (three)!

78
Part I: Getting Started 
Japanese usually write numbers by using Arabic numerals, but they also 
write them in kanji. Here’s how Japanese write and say the numbers from 1 
to 10:
	
✓	1: 一 ichi (ee-chee)
	
✓	2: 二 ni (nee)
	
✓	3: 三 san (sahn)
	
✓	4: 四 yon (yohn) or shi (shee)
	
✓	5: 五 go (goh)
	
✓	6: 六 roku (roh-koo)
	
✓	7: 七 nana (nah-nah) or shichi (shee-chee)
	
✓	8: 八 hachi (hah-chee)
	
✓	9: 九 kyū (kyooo) or ku (koo)
	
✓	10: 十 jū (jooo)
Numbers from 11 to 99
To make any number from 11 to 99, you just combine the numbers from 1 
to 10. For example, 11 is jū-ichi (jooo-ee-chee) — 10 (jū) plus 1 (ichi). How 
about 12? Same thing: 12 is jū-ni (jooo-nee). Twenty is two sets of ten, so you 
say “two-tens,” ni-jū (nee-jooo). It may help you to think of 20 as 2 times 10. 
Twenty-one is ni-jū-ichi (nee-jooo-ee-chee). Do you see the logic? You can use 
this pattern to count up to kyū-jū-kyū (kyooo-jooo-kyooo) (99), or nine tens 
plus nine.
Getting a black belt in counting
Japanese usually use the pronunciations し 
shi (shee), しち shichi (shee-chee), and く ku 
(koo) — for four, seven, and nine, respectively — 
only for reciting numbers or doing arithmetic 
and not for actually counting things. Students of 
martial arts may be familiar with these numbers 
from counting while practicing kicks, punches, 
and so on. In martial-type language, syllables 
are often cut short, making counting prac­
tice sound like ich, ni, san, shi, go, rok, shich, 
hach, ku, jū. It also makes war movies hard to 
understand!

79
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Numbers, Times, and Measurements Straight
Numbers from 100 to 9,999
To count over 100, keep using the pattern for numbers up to 99 (which I 
describe in the preceding section). One hundred is hyaku (hyah-koo). So 200 
is ni-hyaku (nee-hyah-koo). One thousand is sen (sehn); therefore, 2,000 is 
ni-sen (nee-sehn). I’m sure you can’t wait to say 9,999. Yes. It’s kyū-sen kyū-
hyaku kyū-jū kyū (kyooo-sehn kyooo-hyah-koo kyooo-jooo kyooo).
	
This counting business sounds easy, but be aware of some irregular sound 
changes. When the words for 100 (hyaku) and 1,000 (sen) are preceded by the 
number 3 (san), they become byaku (byah-koo) and zen (zehn), respectively. 
So 300 is san-byaku and 3,000 is san-zen. Other irregular sound changes are 
found in 600 (rop-pyaku) (rohp-pyah-koo), 800 (hap-pyaku) (hahp-pyah-koo), 
and 8,000 (has-sen) (hahs-sehn). See the following list:
	
✓	100: 百 hyaku (hyah-koo)
	
✓	200: 二百 ni-hyaku (nee-hyah-koo)
	
✓	300: 三百 san-byaku (sahn-byah-koo)
	
✓	400: 四百 yon-hyaku (yohn-hyah-koo)
	
✓	500: 五百 go-hyaku (goh-hyah-koo)
	
✓	600: 六百 rop-pyaku (rohp-pyah-koo)
	
✓	700: 七百 nana-hyaku (nah-nah-hyah-koo)
	
✓	800: 八百 hap-pyaku (hahp-pyah-koo)
	
✓	900: 九百 kyū-hyaku (kyooo-hyah-koo)
	
✓	1,000: 千 sen (sehn)
	
✓	2,000: 二千 ni-sen (nee-sehn)
	
✓	3,000: 三千 san-zen (sahn-zehn)
	
✓	4,000: 四千 yon-sen (yohn-sehn)
	
✓	5,000: 五千 go-sen (goh-sehn)
	
✓	6,000: 六千 roku-sen (roh-koo-sehn)
	
✓	7,000: 七千 nana-sen (nah-nah-sehn)
	
✓	8,000: 八千 has-sen (hahs-sehn)
	
✓	9,000: 九千 kyū-sen (kyooo-sehn)

80
Part I: Getting Started 
Numbers from 10,000 to 99,999
Unlike English, Japanese has a special digit name for 10,000: man (mahn). 
So 50,000 isn’t go-jū-sen, which is go-jū (50) of sen (1,000), but go-man (goh-
mahn) (50,000). As you can see from the following list, there’s no annoying 
sound change when you combine numbers and man:
	
✓	10,000: 一万 ichi-man (ee-chee-mahn)
	
✓	20,000: 二万 ni-man (nee-mahn)
	
✓	30,000: 三万 san-man (sahn-mahn)
	
✓	40,000: 四万 yon-man (yohn-mahn)
	
✓	50,000: 五万 go-man (goh-mahn)
	
✓	60,000: 六万 roku-man (roh-koo-mahn)
	
✓	70,000: 七万 nana-man (nah-nah-mahn)
	
✓	80,000: 八万 hachi-man (hahr-chee-mahn)
	
✓	90,000: 九万 kyū-man (kyooo-mahn)
Now, can you say 99,999? It’s kyū-man kyū-sen kyū-hyaku kyū-jū kyū.
Comparing English and Japanese digit names
You may find it helpful to see a side-by-side 
comparison of the English and Japanese names

Numbers over 100,000
Japanese doesn’t have a digit name for million. One million in Japanese is 100 
man, or more correctly, hyaku man (hyah-koo mahn). However, Japanese does 
have a richly special digit name for 100 million, which is 1 oku (oh-koo), or more 
correctly, ichi oku (ee-chee oh-koo). Now, can you say 999,999,999? It’s kyū-oku 
kyū-sen kyū-hyaku kyū-jū kyū-man kyū-sen kyū-hyaku kyū-jū kyū.
Expressing amount or quantity 
with counters
Words like piece, sheet, and pair (as in a piece of cake, a sheet of paper, and a 
pair of shoes) express the amount or quantity unit. Depending on the shape, 
size, and type of the item, you use different counters (short suffixes following 
numerals). Table 5-1 lists some frequently used counters along with their uses.

 Chapter 5: Getting Your Numbers, Times, and Measurements Straight
Notice how the counter -tsu is a little bit different from the other counters in 
the table? First off, it’s written in kana (つ) rather than kanji. What does that 
tell you? That -tsu is a native Japanese counter, whereas the other counters 
in the table are originally from Chinese. As a result, the numbers used with 
-tsu aren’t ichi, ni, san, and so on, which are originally from Chinese, but 
hito, futa, mi, and so on, which are native Japanese vocabulary.
	
The counter for people (人) follows the patterns as a native Japanese counter 
only for the first two numbers and as a Chinese counter for three and after, 
as you can see in Table 5-2. The counter 人 is pronounced as ri and used with 
native Japanese numbers for the first two, but it’s pronounced as nin and 
used with numbers of Chinese origin for three and after. At any rate, when you 
write, you can use the number in Arabic numeral or in kanji followed by the 
counter written in kanji except for つ tsu, which is written in hiragana. For 
example, 1台, 一台, 1人, 一人, 1つ, 一つ, and so on.
Using some counters causes sound changes in the numbers and in the coun­
ter itself. And the Japanese native word for number ten, tō (tohh) (ten), can’t 
be followed by the counter -tsu. Don’t be too concerned about these irregular 
changes. Even if you make a mistake here, you’ll be understood perfectly by 
Japanese.
	
Native Japanese numbers are available only from one to ten. If you have 11 or 
more apples, use the counter -ko. For example, to say 9 when counting apples, 
you can say either kokono-tsu or kyū-ko. However, to say 12 for apples, you 
need to say jūni-ko.
	
If you forget which counter to use, and you’re counting no more than ten 
of something, the number phrases in the last column of Table 5-2 (the -tsu 
column) work for counting pretty much anything except for people and 
animals.
Indicating ordinal numbers with -me
Ordinal-number phrases such as the first and the second are essential for 
pinpointing things and people in a sequence. To form an ordinal-number 
phrase in Japanese, you take one of the Japanese counters (see the preced­
ing section) and add -me after it. For example, san-nin-me means third person 
and mit-tsu-me means third thing. Following are some additional examples of 
ordinal-number phrases:
３人目の息子 san-nin-me no musuko (sahn-neen-meh noh moo-soo-koh) 
(my third son)
右側の５つ目の家 migi gawa no itsu-tsu-me no ie (mee-gee gah-wah noh 
ee-tsoo-tsoo-meh noh ee-eh) (the fifth house on the right-hand side)

２杯目のコーヒー ni-hai-me no kōhī (nee-hah-ee-meh noh kohh-heee) 
(second cup of coffee)
４つ目の信号 yot-tsu-me no shingō (yot-tsoo-meh noh sheen-gohh) (the 
fourth traffic light)
２番目の息子 ni-ban-me no musuko (nee-bahn-meh noh moo-soo-koh) 
(my second son)
	
If you want to say number X, just add ban (bahn) after the number — for 
example, ichi-ban. So to tell someone that Mike is number 1 in the class., you’d 
say Maiku wa kurasu de ichi-ban desu. (mah-ee-koo wah koo-rah-soo deh ee-
chee-bahn deh-soo.).
Telling Time
If someone asks you Nan-ji. (nahn-jee.) (What time?), can you respond quickly 
by looking at your tokei (toh-kehh) (watch, clock)? You can after reviewing 
the next sections, which tell you how to refer to time both generally and in 
terms of hours and minutes.
Noting hours and minutes
You can express time in Japanese by using the counters -ji (jee) (o’clock) 
and -fun (foon) (minutes), as shown in Tables 5-3 and 5-4. Note: When talking 
about minutes, -fun sometimes changes to -pun (poon), so watch out.

You can use the convenient phrase han (hahn) (half) for half an hour or 30 
minutes. Mae (mah-eh) (before) and sugi (soo-gee) (after) are also convenient 
for telling time. Sorry, but there’s no simple phrase for a quarter of an hour 
or 15 minutes in Japanese. So, if you want to say a quarter past 2:00, you need 
to say 2-ji 15-fun sugi. To specify gozen (goh-zehn) (a.m.) or gogo (goh-goh) 
(p.m.), put the appropriate word in front of the number, as in gogo 8-ji (8 
p.m.). Check how people say what time it is now:
今, 何時ですか。 Ima, nan-ji desu ka. (ee-mah, nahn-jee deh-soo kah.) 
(What time is it now?)
今, ３時５分です。 Ima, 3-ji 5-fun desu. (ee-mah, sahn-jee goh-foon deh-
soo.) (It’s 3:05 now.)
今, ３時５分すぎです。 Ima, 3-ji 5-fun sugi desu. (ee-mah, sahn-jee goh-
foon soo-gee deh-soo.) (It’s 5 minutes past 3:00 now.)
今, １２時３分前です。 Ima, 12-ji 3-pun mae desu. (ee-mah, jooo-nee-jee 
sahn-poon mah-eh deh-soo.) (It’s 3 minutes before 12:00.)
今, 日本は午前２時です。 Ima, Nihon wa gozen 2-ji desu. (ee-mah, nee-
hohn wa goh-zehn nee-jee deh-soo.) (It’s 2:00 a.m.in Japan.)
	
Japanese train schedules usually follow the 24-hour system. For example, 1-ji 
(ee-chee-jee) means only 1:00 a.m., and 13-ji (jooo-sahn-jee) means only 1:00 
p.m. This system eliminates a.m./p.m. ambiguity, and you don’t need to say 
gozen or gogo.
Knowing when to use –fun and –pun
-Fun changes to -pun depending on the preced­
ing sound. When the numbers are いち ichi, ろ
く roku, はち hachi, and じゅう jū, replace 
the last hiragana with っ, which is basically a 
moment of silence, and add ぷん pun. That is, 
you get いっぷん ippun, ろっぷん roppun, は
っぷん happun, and じゅっぷん juppun. In 
addition, after ん n, just add ぷん pun. So, you’ll 
get さんぷん sanpun and よんぷん yonpun. 
For other numbers, just add ふん fun.

Talking about time
	
To express at what time, from what time, until what time, and by what time, you 
need the particles ni (nee) (at), kara (kah-rah) (from), made (mah-deh) (until), 
and made ni (mah-deh nee) (by). Make sure to place the particle after, not 
before, the time phrase. Chapter 3 gives you the lowdown on using particles. 
Here are some examples:
コンサートは何時に始まりますか。 ３時に始まります。 Konsāto wa 
nan-ji ni hajimarimasu ka. 3-ji ni hajimarimasu. (kohn-sahh-toh wah 
nahn-jee nee hah-jee-mah-ree-mah-soo kah. sahn-jee nee hah-jee-mah-ree-
mah-soo.) (What time does the concert start? It starts at 3:00.)
ランチサービスは午前１１時半から午後２時までです。 Ranchi sābisu wa 
gozen 11-ji han kara gogo 2-ji made desu. (rahn-chee sahh-bee-soo wah 
goh-zehn jooo-ee-chee-jee hahn kah-rah goh-goh nee-jee mah-deh deh-
soo.) (Lunch service is from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.)
３時５分前までに来てください。 3-ji 5-fun mae made ni kite kudasai. 
(sahn-jee goh-foon mah-eh mah-deh nee kee-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please 
come by five minutes before 3:00.)
Instead of giving the exact time, you can vaguely specify the part of the day 
or use relative time expressions:
	
✓	朝 asa (ah-sah) (morning)
	
✓	昼 hiru (hee-roo) (noon, middle of the day)
	
✓	晩 ban (bahn) (evening)
	
✓	夜中 yonaka (yoh-nah-kah) (the middle of the night)
	
✓	今 ima (ee-mah) (now)
	
✓	さっき sakki (sahk-kee) (a little while ago)
To tell the length of time, just add -kan (kahn) after -ji or -fun. However, -kan 
is usually omitted after -fun in conversations. Check out these examples:
２時間勉強しました。 2-jikan benkyō shimashita. (nee-jee-kahn behn-
kyohh shee-mah-shee-tah.) (I studied for two hours.)
８時間かかりました。 8-jikan kakarimasu. (hah-chee-jee-kahn kah-kah-
ree-mah-shee-tah.) (It took eight hours.)
１５分かかります。 15-fun kakarimasu. (jooo-goh-foon a kah-kah-ree-
mah-soo.) (It takes 15 minutes.)

It’s a Date! Delving into the Calendar
Making plans with others in Japanese requires having a basic grasp of the 
terms used for days of the week, months, years, and so on. With the informa­
tion in the following sections, you’ll be prepared to mark your karendā (kah-
rehn-dahh) (calendar) for all kinds of fun activities.
Talking about the days of the week
Both American and Japanese weeks only have seven days. An American 
week — at least on the calendar — starts on nichiyōbi (nee-chee-yohh-bee) 
(Sunday) and ends on doyōbi (doh-yohh-bee) (Saturday), but a Japanese 
week starts on getsuyōbi (geh-tsoo-yohh-bee) (Monday) and ends on 
nichiyōbi (nee-chee-yohh-bee) (Sunday). Japanese work first and rest later. 
Here are all the terms you need to know to talk about days of the week:
	
✓	月曜日 getsuyōbi (geh-tsoo-yohh-bee) (Monday)
	
✓	火曜日 kayōbi (kah-yohh-bee) (Tuesday)
	
✓	水曜日 suiyōbi (soo-ee-yohh-bee) (Wednesday)
	
✓	木曜日 mokuyōbi (moh-koo-yohh-bee) (Thursday)
	
✓	金曜日 kinyōbi (keen-yohh-bee) (Friday)
	
✓	土曜日 doyōbi (doh-yohh-bee) (Saturday)
	
✓	日曜日 nichiyōbi (nee-chee-yohh-bee) (Sunday)
So if someone were to ask you Kyō wa nanyōbi desu ka. (kyohh wah nahn-
yohh-bee deh-soo kah.) (What day is it today?), you may respond with Kyō 
wa doyōbi desu. (kyohh wah doh-yohh-bee deh-soo.) (Today is Saturday.). 
Following are some additional statements featuring days of the week so you 
can see them in action:
月曜日から金曜日まで働きます。 Getsuyōbi kara kinyōbi made hatara­
kimasu. (geh-tsoo-yohh-bee kah-rah keen-yohh-bee mah-deh hah-tah-rah-
kee-mah-soo.) (I work from Monday to Friday.)
コンサートは土曜日です。 Konsāto wa doyōbi desu. (kohn-sahh-toh wa 
doh-yohh-bee deh-soo.) (The concert is on Saturday.)
日曜日はゆっくりします。 Nichiyōbi wa yukkuri shimasu. (nee-chee-
yohh-bee wah yook-koo-ree shee-mah-soo.) (I relax on Sundays.)

Naming the months and counting them up
The Japanese word for moon is tsuki (tsoo-kee), which also means month. 
Japanese doesn’t have a separate name for each month — it uses a number 
paired with the counter -gatsu (gah-tsoo). So, January is ichi-gatsu (eeh-chee-
gah-tsoo) and December is jū-ni-gatsu (jooo-nee-gah-tsoo). Here’s how to 
write and say all 12 months in Japanese:
	
✓	１月 ichi-gatsu (ee-chee-gah-tsoo) (January)
	
✓	２月 ni-gatsu (nee-gah-tsoo) (February)
	
✓	３月 san-gatsu (sahn-gah-tsoo) (March)
	
✓	４月 shi-gatsu (shee-gah-tsoo) (April)
	
✓	５月 go-gatsu (goh-gah-tsoo) (May)
	
✓	６月 roku-gatsu (roh-koo-gah-tsoo) (June)
	
✓	７月 shichi-gatsu (shee-chee-gah-tsoo) (July)
	
✓	８月 hachi-gatsu (hah-chee-gah-tsoo) (August)
	
✓	９月 ku-gatsu (koo-gah-tsoo) (September)
	
✓	１０月 jū-gatsu (jooo-gah-tsoo) (October)
	
✓	１1月 jū-ichi-gatsu (jooo-ee-chee-gah-tsoo) (November)
	
✓	１2月 jū-ni-gatsu (jooo-nee-gah-tsoo) (December)
To express a number of months, like one month and two months, use the 
counter -kagetsu (kah-geh-tsoo) or -kagetsukan (kah-geh-tsoo-kahn).
	
✓	１ヶ月 ik-kagetsu (eek-kah-geh-tsoo) (1 month)
	
✓	２ヶ月 ni-kagetsu (nee-kah-geh-tsoo) (2 months)
	
✓	３ヶ月 san-kagetsu (sahn-kah-geh-tsoo) (3 months)
	
✓	４ヶ月 yon-kagetsu (yohn-kah-geh-tsoo) (4 months)
	
✓	５ヶ月 go-kagetsu (goh-kah-geh-tsoo) (5 months)
	
✓	６ヶ月 rok-kagetsu (rohk-kah-geh-tsoo) (6 months)
	
✓	７ヶ月 nana-kagetsu (nah-nah-kah-geh-tsoo) (7 months)
	
✓	８ヶ月 hachi-kagetsu (hah-chee-kah-geh-tsoo) (8 months)
	
✓	９ヶ月 kyū-kagetsu (kyooo-kah-geh-tsoo) (9 months)
	
✓	１０ヶ月 juk-kagetsu (jook-kah-geh-tsoo) (10 months)
	
✓	１1ヶ月 jū-ik-kagetsu (jooo-eek-kah-geh-tsoo) (11 months)
	
✓	１2ヶ月 jū-ni-kagetsu (jooo-nee-kah-geh-tsoo) (12 months)

Part I: Getting Started 
	
In conversation, -kagetsu is more common than -kagetsukan, so you can 
just use -kagetsu, but it’s good to know both of them because you may hear 
either one.
Counting the days
In this section, I show you how you say the first, the second, and so on, for 
dates. (To find out how you say these types of words in relation to other 
items, such as buildings, coffee, and people, see the earlier “Indicating ordi­
nal numbers with -me” section.)
The way that dates are pronounced in Japanese isn’t very systematic; it’s full 
of irregularities. I know that’s not very encouraging — sorry — so your best 
bet is to memorize Table 5-5.

You can also use the dates shown in Table 5-5 for expressing the number of 
days in a given span. For example, futsuka can mean either the second or two 
days. To make it crystal clear that you’re talking about the number of days, just 
add -kan (kahn) to this form — futsukakan (foo-tsoo-kah-kahn) (two days) — 
to eliminate any ambiguity. The only exception to these rules is tsuitachi. 
Tsuitachi means only the first and not one day. To say one day, use ichi-nichi 
(ee-chee-nee-chee).
Counting the weeks
You can specify the weeks in a month, or the weeks in any cycle, by saying 
dai (dah-ee), the number, and then -shū (shooo). For example:
	
✓	第１週 dai is-shū (dah-ee ees-shooo) (the first week)
	
✓	第２週 dai ni-shū (dah-ee nee-shooo) (the second week)
	
✓	第３週 dai san-shū (dah-ee sahn-shooo) (the third week)
	
✓	第４週 dai yon-shū (dah-ee yohn-shoo) (the fourth week)
To count weeks, use the counter -shūkan, as in is-shūkan (ees-shooo-kahn) 
(one week), ni-shūkan (nee-shooo-kahn) (two weeks), and so on.
Reeling off the years
To specify the toshi (toh-shee) (year), just add the counter -nen after the 
number that expresses the year — 1998-nen (sehn-kyooo-hyah-koo-kyooo-
jooo-hah-chee-nehn) (1998) and 2012-nen (nee-sehn-jooo-nee-nehn) (2012), 
for example.
Follow this advice, and you’ll be understood perfectly in Japan. But be ready 
to hear a year referred to with a unique nengō (nehn-gohh) (era name), as in 

93
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Numbers, Times, and Measurements Straight
Heisei 24-nen (hehh-sehh nee-jooo-yoh-nehn), which is equivalent to 2012. 
Check out the nearby “Era names in Japan” sidebar for information on this 
system.
If you want to count years, use either -nenkan or -nen as counters. So, one 
year is ichi-nen (ee-chee-nehn) or ichi-nenkan (ee-chee-nehn-kahn), and two 
years is ni-nen (nee-nehn) or ni-nenkan (nee-nehn-kahn). Note: In conversa­
tion, the shorter version, -nen, is used more frequently than -nenkan, but 
again, being aware of both forms is a good idea.
Specifying dates and times
When specifying a full date the Japanese way, start from the largest unit of 
time, the toshi, and then move to successively smaller units: the tsuki, the hi, 
and the yōbi, in that order. For example, Thursday, October 25, 2012 is
	
✓	２０１２年１０月２５日木曜日 nisenjūni-nen jū-gatsu nijūgo-nichi 
Mokuyōbi (nee-sehn joo-nee-nehn jooo-gah-tsoo nee-jooo-goh-nee-chee 
moh-koo-yohh-bee)
	
✓	平成２４年１０月２５日木曜日 Heisei nijūyo-nen jū-gatsu nijūgo-nichi 
Mokuyōbi (hehh-sehh nee-jooo-yoh-nehn jooo-gah-tsoo nee-jooo-goh-
nee-chee moh-koo-yohh-bee)
Era names in Japan
You can express years in two ways in Japan. 
You can use the Western system with the coun­
ter 年 -nen (nehn), as in 2012年 2012-nen (nee-
sehn-jooo-nee-nehn) (2012). Or you can use the 
Japanese system with the 年号 nengō (nehn-
gohh) (era name) and the counter -nen, as in 
平成24年 Heisei 24-nen (hehh-sehh nee-jooo-
yoh-nehn) (2012).
A new nengō is created every time a new 
emperor ascends the throne in Japan and con­
tinues to be used until a different emperor takes 
his place. The first year of any era is called 元
年 gan-nen (gahn-nehn). For example, the year 
Emperor Heisei ascended the throne (1989) 
was called 平成元年 Heisei gan-nen (hehh-
sehh gahn-nehn) in the Japanese system. And 
the following year (1990) was called 平成２年 
Heisei 2-nen (hehh-sehh nee-nehn).
Government officials tend to use only the 
Japanese system, but many companies and 
institutions use the Western systems. My 
daughter was born in Heisei era, my mother 
and I were born in 昭和 Shōwa (shohh-wah) 
era, and my grandmother was born in Meiji 
(mehh-jee) era. There was a short era, 大正 
Taishō (tah-ee-shohh) era, between Meiji 
era and Shōwa era. Let me list these eras of 
modern Japan chronologically:
	✓	明治 Meiji (mehh-jee) 1868–1912
	✓	大正 Taishō (tah-ee-shohh) 1912–1926
	✓	昭和 Shōwa (shohh-wah) 1926–1989
	✓	平成 Heisei (heh-ee-sehh) 1989–Present

94
Part I: Getting Started 
Instead of using a specific date on the calendar, you can also use relative 
time expressions based on the concepts of before and after or previous and 
following. See what I mean in Table 5-6.

You can expect to hear alternative terms such as these when you’re in a 
slightly formal context:
	
✓	本日 honjitsu (hohn-jee-tsoo) (today)
	
✓	明日 asu (ah-soo) (tomorrow)
	
✓	昨日 sakujitsu (sah-koo-jee-tsoo) (yesterday)
	
✓	昨年 sakunen (sah-koo-nehn) (last year)
	
The following additional terms for referring to the future are always useful:
	
✓	あさって asatte (ah-saht-teh) (the day after tomorrow)
	
✓	再来週 saraishū (sah-rah-ee-shooo) (the week after next)
	
✓	再来月 saraigetsu (sah-rah-ee-geh-tsoo) (the month after next)
	
✓	再来年 sarainen (sah-rah-ee-nehn) (the year after next)
	
To specify when something happens or happened, insert a time phrase into 
the sentence. You can place the time phrase anywhere in a sentence, as long 
as it’s before the verb. If you’re dealing with a specific time, place the particle 

95
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Numbers, Times, and Measurements Straight
ni (nee) after the time phrase. If you’re dealing with a relative time, you don’t 
need to use the particle ni. I illustrate the differences in the following list of 
examples:
１２月２８日に東京に行きます。 12-gatsu 28-nichi ni Tōkyō ni ikimasu. 
(jooo-nee-gah-tsoo nee-jooo-hah-chee-nee-chee nee tohh-kyohh nee ee-
kee-mah-soo.) (I’ll go to Tokyo on December 28th.)
あした買い物をします。 Ashita kaimono o shimasu. (ah-shee-tah kah-ee-
moh-noh oh shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll go shopping tomorrow.)
１９９８年に生まれました。 1998-nen ni umaremashita. (sehn-kyooo-
hyah-koo-kyooo-jooo-hah-chee-nehn nee oo-mah-reh-mah-shee-tah.) (I 
was born in 1998.)
先週家賃を払いました。 Senshū yachin o haraimashita. (sehn-shooo 
yah-cheen oh hah-rah-ee-mah-shee-tah.) (I paid the rent last week.)
	
To list a number of activities in the same sentence, put all the verbs, except 
the last one, into the te-form (I cover te-forms in Chapter 3). You don’t need to 
use any particle that would correspond to and in English — converting all the 
verbs, except the last one, into the te-form handles the and concept. The last 
verb expresses the tense of all the activities.
昨日は９時に銀行に行って１０時にデパートに行って５時に帰りました。 
Kinō wa ku-ji ni ginkō ni itte jū-ji ni depāto ni itte go-ji ni kaerimashita. 
(kee-nohh wah koo-jee nee geen-kohh nee eet-teh jooo-jee nee deh-pahh-
toh nee eet-teh goh-jee nee kah-eh-ree-mah-shee-tah.) (Yesterday, I went 
to the bank at 9:00, went to the department store at 10:00, and went home at 
5:00.)
あしたは買い物をして映画を見ます。 Ashita wa kaimono o shite eiga o 
mimasu. (ah-shee-tah wah kah-ee-moh-noh oh shee-teh ehh-gah oh mee-
mah-soo.) (I will go shopping and watch a movie tomorrow.)
In the nearby Talkin’ the Talk dialogue, Eleanor talks about her vacation 
plans for Hawaii. Notice that her first sentence ends with -n-desu (n-deh-soo).
	
In Japanese, you often form a statement by using -n-desu (n-deh-soo) in con­
versation, especially when you provide some information or explanations. The 
effect of -n-desu is to encourage your partner to respond to your statements. 
You’ll sound much more inviting and friendly if you use this ending. It shows 
your willingness to listen to your partner’s comments and opinions. Therefore, 
use -n-desu in conversations, but not in written form or public speech where 
you don’t expect your audience to respond to you after each statement. When a 
verb is followed by -n-desu, it must be in the informal/plain form.

96
Part I: Getting Started 
Eleanor in the dialogue talks about when she’ll leave and when she’ll return 
from her trip. The Japanese verb to go and to return are iku (ee-koo) and 
kaeru (kah-eh-roo). Both of them are u-verbs. Practice conjugating them.

 Chapter 5: Getting Your Numbers, Times, and Measurements Straight
Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Metric System
Japanese use the metric system for taking and discussing measurements. So 
if you go to Japan, expect to hear about liters, grams, meters, and kilometers 
rather than gallons, pounds, feet, and miles. Here are the terms you need to 
know to speak about measurements in Japanese.
	
✓	ミリ miri (mētoru) (mee-ree [mehh-toh-roo]) (millimeter)
	
✓	センチ senchi (mētoru) (sehn-chee [mehh-toh-roo]) (centimeter)
	
✓	メートル mētoru (mehh-toh-roo) (meter)
	
✓	キロ (メートル) kiro (mētoru) (kee-roh [mehh-toh-roo]) (kilometer)
	
✓	グラム guramu (goo-rah-moo) (gram)
	
✓	キロ (グラム) kiro (guramu) (kee-roh [goo-rah-moo]) (kilogram)
	
✓	トン ton (tohn) (ton)
	
✓	リットル rittoru (reet-toh-roo) (liter)
	
✓	平方メートル heihō mētoru (hehh-hohh mehh-toh-roo) (square meter)
	
✓	立法メートル rippō mētoru (reep-pohh mehh-toh-roo) (cubic meter)

Chapter 6
Speaking Japanese at Home
In This Chapter
▶	Naming the areas and contents of your home
▶	Discussing meals
▶	Keeping your house clean and safe
T

here is no better place than your uchi (oo-chee) (home). What do you 
have in your uchi? What do you eat at uchi? What do you do at uchi? 
This chapter helps you answer these questions in Japanese.
Taking a Tour of Your Home
Whether you live in a house (ie) (ee-eh) or an apartment (apāto) (ah-pahh-
toh), your uchi probably has these rooms and structures:
	
✓	玄関 genkan (gehn-kahn) (entryway)
	
✓	キッチン kitchin (keet-cheen) or 台所 daidokoro (dah-ee-doh-koh-roh) 
(kitchen)
	
✓	ダイニング dainingu (dah-ee-neen-goo) or 食堂 shokudō (shoh-koo-
dohh) (dining room)
	
✓	リビング ribingu (ree-been-goo) or 居間 ima (ee-mah) (living room)
	
✓	寝室 shinshitsu (sheen-shee-tsoo) (bedroom)
	
✓	書斎 shosai (shoh-sah-ee) (office)
	
✓	バスルーム basurūmu (bah-soo-rooo-moo) or 風呂場 furoba (foo-roh-
bah) (bathroom)
	
✓	洗濯場 sentakuba (sehn-tah-koo-bah) (laundry room)
	
✓	床 yuka (yoo-kah) (floor)
	
✓	天井 tenjō (tehn-johh) (ceiling)

100
Part I: Getting Started 
	
✓	壁 kabe (kah-beh) (wall)
	
✓	クローゼット kurōzetto (koo-rohh-zeht-toh) (Western-style closet)
	
✓	窓 mado (mah-doh) (window)
	
✓	押入れ oshiire (oh-shee-ee-reh) (oshiire-closet for futon and other items)
	
When you enter Japanese homes, make sure you take off your kutsu (koo-
tsoo) (shoes) after you’re in the genkan (not outside it). In Japanese houses, 
the genkan has two levels. The area you step in first is the lower level or 
ground level, and it’s made of concrete, tile, or stone. You’re allowed to step 
into this lower area while wearing your shoes. The second, upper level is a 
part of the house, and you’re not allowed to step up to it with your shoes on. 
Take off your shoes on the lower level and then immediately step up to the 
upper level, where you’ll typically be asked to wear surippa (soo-reep-pah) 
(slippers). You can wear slippers anywhere inside the house except in rooms 
with tatami (tah-tah-mee) (straw mat) floors. When you go to a toilet room, 
another pair of slippers are waiting for you. Change into those slippers for 
your time in that room and then back into your other slippers to return to the 
rest of the house. (In other words, don’t come back to the living room with 
your toilet slippers on.)
The kitchen
The kitchin must be the most heavily used room in any house (unless you’re 
really big on takeout). Here are the Japanese terms for some of the major 
appliances and fixtures in your kitchen:
	
✓	電子レンジ denshi-renji (dehn-shee-rehn-jee) (microwave oven)
	
✓	フリーザー furīzā (foo-reee-zahh) (freezer)
	
✓	椅子 isu (ee-soo) (chair)
	
✓	コンロ konro (kohn-roh) (stove)
	
✓	キャビネット kyabinetto (kyah-bee-neht-toh) (cabinet)
	
✓	オーブン ōbun (ohh-boon) (oven)
	
✓	冷蔵庫 reizōko (rehh-zohh-koh) (refrigerator)
	
✓	食器洗い機 shokki-arai-ki (shohk-kee ah-rah-ee kee) (dishwasher)
	
✓	シンク shinku (sheen-koo) (sink)
	
✓	テーブル tēburu (tehh-boo-roo) (table)
	
Not many Japanese have a big oven or a dishwasher in their kitchens, so when 
in Japan, be prepared to bake smaller cakes and do your dishes by hand.

101
 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
What do you have in your kitchen drawers and cabinets? If you’re like most 
people, you probably have various implements and gadgets:
	
✓	ボール bōru (mixing bowl)
	
✓	フードプロセサー fūdo purosesā (fooo-doh poo-roh-seh-sahh) (food 
processor)
	
✓	フライパン furaipan (foo-rah-ee-pahn) (frying pan)

✓	鍋 nabe (nah-beh) (pot)
	
✓	トースター tōsutā (tohh-soo-tahh) (toaster)
	
✓	ざる zaru (zah-roo) (colander)
The dining room
Most houses have a dining table in the kitchen, but you certainly need these 
items wherever you eat:
	
✓	フォーク fōku (fohh-koo) (fork)
	
✓	コップ koppu (kohp-poo) (glass, cup)
	
✓	ナイフ naifu (nah-ee-foo) (table knife)
	
✓	ナプキン napukin (nah-poo-keen) (napkin)

✓	スパチュラ supachura (soo-pah-choo-rah) (spatula)
	
✓	スプーン supūn (soo-pooon) (spoon)
	
✓	テーブルクロス tēburukurosu (tehh-boo-roo koo-roh-soo) (tablecloth)
	
✓	器 utsuwa (oo-tsoo-wah) (bowl)

102
Part I: Getting Started 
	
Dining in Japanese homes can be quite different from what you’re probably 
used to. For one, Japanese often eat meals in a Japanese-style room, sitting 
on the floor at a low table and using hashi (hah-shee) (chopsticks), chawan 
(chah-wahn) (Japanese rice bowl), and o-wan (oh-wahn) (Japanese lacquered 
soup bowl). Additionally, the Japanese table often features shōyu (shohh-yoo) 
(soy sauce).
The living room
Whether your living room is a formal entertaining space or just where the 
family hangs out, it probably has many of the following items:
	
✓	アームチェアー āmucheā (ahh-moo-cheh-ahh) (armchair)
	
✓	電気スタンド denki-sutando (dehn-kee-soo-tahn-doh) (desk lamp, 
floor lamp)
	
✓	絵 e (eh) (painting)
	
✓	エアコン eakon (eh-ah-kohn) (air conditioner)
	
✓	エンドテーブル endo tēburu (ehn-doh tehh-boo-roo) (end table)
	
✓	電話 denwa (dehn-wah) (phone)
	
✓	ヒーター hītā (heee-tahh) (space heater)
	
✓	本棚 hondana (hohn-dah-nah) (bookshelf, bookcase)
	
✓	コーヒーテーブル kōhī tēburu (kohh-heee tehh-boo-roo) (coffee table)
	
✓	ソファー sofā (soh-fahh) (sofa)
	
✓	テレビ terebi (teh-reh-bee) (TV)
The bedroom
Worn out from all your Japanese studying? Before you hit the sack for a nap, 
look at some common bedroom furnishings:
	
✓	ベッド beddo (behd-doh) (bed)
	
✓	ふとん futon (foo-tohn) (futon)
	
✓	カーテン kāten (kahh-tehn) (curtains)
	
✓	枕 makura (mah-koo-rah) (pillow)
	
✓	目覚まし時計 mezamashi-dokei (meh-zah-mah-shee-doh-kehh) 
(alarm clock)
	
✓	毛布 mōfu (mohh-foo) (blanket)

103
 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
	
✓	ナイトスタンド naitosutando (nah-ee-toh-soo-tahn-doh) (nightstand) 
	
✓	シーツ shītsu (sheee-tsoo) (sheet)
	
✓	たんす tansu (tahn-soo) (chest of drawers)
	
Japanese sleep on beds or on futon, depending on their preferences and how big 
the room is. (Beds take up more permanent space; check out the nearby sidebar 
“Futon: Not just for college students” for more on the futon sleeping option.)
The bathroom
Most bathrooms typically contain the following items:
	
✓	バスタオル basu-taoru (bah-soo-tah-oh-roo) (bath towel)
	
✓	ブラシ burashi (boo-rah-shee) (brush)
	
✓	ドライヤー doraiyā (doh-rah-ee-yahh) (hair dryer)
	
✓	歯ブラシ ha-burashi (hah-boo-rah-shee) (toothbrush)
	
✓	歯磨き粉 hamigakiko (hah-mee-gah-kee-koh) (toothpaste)
	
✓	鏡 kagami (kah-gah-mee) (mirror)
	
✓	シャワー shawā (shah-wahh) (shower)
	
✓	石鹸 sekken (sehk-kehn) (soap)
	
✓	トイレットペーパー toiretto pēpā (toh-ee-reht-toh pehh-pahh) (toilet tissue)
Futon: Not just for college students
Futons have become a trendy piece of furniture 
in the West. Like most cultural imports, how­
ever, the real thing is quite a bit different. For 
starters, the Japanese word ふとん futon isn’t 
pronounced foo-tahn, as you may be accus­
tomed to, but rather foo-tohn, with an oh sound 
in the second syllable.
A Western futon is just the mattress you sleep 
on — the comforter or blankets you use to 
keep warm are separate items. In Japan, how­
ever, both the mattress and covering make up 
a futon. At night, you lay out your futon on the 
floor, and in the morning, you fold it up and put 
it in 押入れ oshiire (oh-shee-ee-reh) (oshiire-
closet for futon and other items). The same 
room can serve as a bedroom at night and as a 
living room during the day — quite convenient 
in a country where space is at a premium.
If sleeping on the floor seems a little awkward, 
rest assured that a Japanese futon is actually 
quite comfortable and gives you a good night’s 
rest. On top of that, sleeping on a futon is good 
for your back because a futon contains no 
spring, and your back has to be straight!

104
Part I: Getting Started 
	
In most Japanese houses, the furoba (foo-roh-bah) (bathing room) and toire 
(toh-ee-reh) (toilet room) are separate rooms. In cities where the space is lim­
ited, some apartments have a yunitto basu (yoo-neet-toh bah-soo) (unit bath) — 
a compact combination of a bathtub, a sink, a toilet, and the surrounding wall 
and floor. It’s preassembled at a factory before installation and looks like a 
sheet of molded plastic. The yunitto basu is extremely space-saving and eco­
nomical, but still has everything you expect to find in a bathroom.
	
Japanese love to use English in general, so they also use the term basurūmu 
to mean bathroom. Most basurūmu in Japan still have only bathing areas, but 
the term is relatively new and a bit vague. By contrast, the term furoba refers 
strictly to a bathing room.
The laundry room
The Japanese often hang their washed clothes in their backyards or on their 
balconies. It saves energy and kills germs! If airing your (clean) laundry isn’t 
your style, you can throw it in the dryer, iron, and explain the whole thing in 
Japanese with the following words:
	
✓	アイロン airon (ah-ee-rohn) (iron)
	
✓	アイロン台 airondai (ah-ee-rohn-dah-ee) (ironing board)
	
✓	漂白剤 hyōhakuzai (hyohh-hah-koo-zah-ee) (bleach)
	
✓	ハンガー hangā (hahn-gahh) (clothes hanger)
	
✓	柔軟剤 jūnanzai (jooo-nahn-zah-ee) (fabric softener)
	
✓	乾燥機 kansōki (kahn-sohh-kee) (dryer)
	
✓	洗濯機 sentakuki (sehn-tah-koo-kee) (washing machine)
	
✓	洗剤 senzai (sehn-zah-ee) (detergent)
The storage room
If you’re lucky, your home has a spacious shako (shah-koh) (garage), yaneura-
beya (yah-neh-oo-rah-beh-yah) (attic), or chikashitsu (chee-kah-shee-tsoo) 
(basement) where you can store all kinds of things such as the following:
	
✓	道具箱 dōgubako (dohh-goo-bah-koh) (toolbox)
	
✓	延長コード enchō kōdo (ehn-chohh kohh-doh) (extension cord)

105
 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
	
✓	ハンマー hanmā (hahm-mahh) (hammer)
	
✓	肥料 hiryō (hee-ryohh) (fertilizer)
	
✓	ホース hōsu (hohh-soo) (garden hose)
	
✓	釘 kugi (koo-gee) (nail)
	
✓	自転車 jitensha (jee-tehn-shah) (bicycle)
	
✓	巻き尺 makijaku (mah-kee-jah-koo) (tape measure)
	
✓	ねじ neji (neh-jee) (screw)
	
✓	のこぎり nokogiri (noh-koh-gee-ree) (saw)
	
✓	レンチ renchi (rehn-chee) (wrench)
	
✓	芝刈り機 shibakariki (shee-bah-kah-ree-kee) (lawnmower)
	
✓	スクリュードライバー sukuryūdoraibā (soo-koo-ryooo-doh-rah-ee-bahh) 
(screwdriver)
	
Most Japanese, especially in the city, are a bit more storage-challenged than 
you may be used to; they just have a small space near the foyer, a part of their 
closet, an area under the kaidan (kah-ee-dahn) (staircase), or a space in the 
back of the house to stash their extra stuff in.
	
If you aren’t so sure about something, but you think maybe or possibly, say it 
with kamoshiremasen. Add it at the end of a verb or an adjective in the plain/
informal form, but just drop da that appears in the plain present affirmative 
form of the linking verb, desu, or a na-type adjective. For example
釘は道具箱の中にあるかもしれません。 Kugi wa dōgubako no naka ni 
aru kamoshiremasen. (koo-gee wah dohh-goo-bah-koh noh nah-kah nee 
ah-roo-kah-moh-shee-reh-mah-sehn.) (Nails may be in the toolbox.)
ミキサーはあまり使わないかもしれません。 Mikisā wa amari tsukawa­
nai kamoshiremasen. (mee-kee-sahh wah ah-mah-ree tsoo-kah-wah-nah-
ee kah-moh-shee-reh-mah-sehn.) (We may not use the blender very often.)
このシーツは大きいかもしれません。 Kono shītsu wa ōkii kamoshire­
masen. (koh-noh sheee-tsoo wah ohh-keee kah-moh-shee-reh-mah-sehn.) 
(This sheet may be big.)
あの部屋は静かかもしれません。Ano heya wa shizuka kamoshiremasen. 
(ah-noh heh-yah wah shee-zoo-kah kah-moh-shee-reh-mah-sehn.) (That 
room may be quiet.)

 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
Home Is Where the Food Is
Nothing is tastier than the dishes your mom makes at home. (That’s one of 
the reasons there’s no place like home.) While you’re stuffing yourself with 
homemade goodies, check out some terminology for various eating times:
	
✓	朝ごはん asagohan (ah-sah-goh-hahn) or 朝食 chōshoku (chohh-shoh-
koo) (breakfast)
	
✓	昼ごはん hirugohan (hee-roo-goh-hahn) or 昼食 chūshoku (chooo-shoh-
koo) (lunch)
	
✓	晩ごはん bangohan (bahn-goh-hahn) or 夕食 yūshoku (yooo-shoh-koo) 
(supper)
	
✓	おやつ oyatsu (oh-yah-tsoo) (snack)
	
✓	夜食 yashoku (yah-shoh-koo) (midnight snack)
The following sections help you talk about eating. Just don’t practice with 
your mouth full.
Getting cooking
The general verb to cook in Japanese is ryōri suru (ryohh-ree soo-roo). In 
fact, ryōri is a noun that means cooking, and suru is the verb that means to 
do. You know that cooking involves a variety of actions. The following verbs 
will help you enjoy cooking at home!
	
✓	揚げる ageru (ah-geh-roo) (to deep fry)
	
✓	炒める itameru (ee-tah-meh-roo) (to stir-fry)
	
✓	蒸す musu (moo-soo) (to steam)
	
✓	煮る niru (nee-roo) (to stew)
	
✓	焼く yaku (yah-koo) (to bake, to broil, to grill, to sauté fry)
	
✓	ゆでる yuderu (yoo-deh-roo) (to boil)
Using two verbs at the table
What do you do at the table? You taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat) and nomu 
(noh-moo) (to drink), of course! Actually, taberu is the first verb I teach in my 
Japanese class. It’s a ru-verb. Here’s the conjugation:

Whatever you eat or drink is marked by the particle o (oh). This particle 
marks the direct object of the verb, so you can use o with other verbs like to 
read, to buy, to make, to invite, to write, and so on. In all cases, o marks the 
direct object of the verb: the book read, the thing bought, the pizza made, 
the person invited, the letter written, and so on, regardless of who performed 
these actions. Here are a couple of examples of o with taberu and nomu.
ピザを食べました。 Piza o tabemashita. (pee-zah oh tah-beh-mah-shee-
tah.) (I ate pizza.)
コーラを飲みました。 Kōra o nomimashita. (kohh-rah oh noh-mee-mah-
shee-tah.) (I drank cola.)
Considering proper table manners
What qualifies as proper table manners depends on the culture and customs of 
your hosts. Japanese drink soup directly from an o-wan without using a spoon. 
And that’s polite. Japanese slurp ramen noodles in soup. That’s polite too.
	
When you start eating, always say itadakimasu (ee-tah-dah-kee-mah-soo). 
It’s a very humble word for receive, but in this context, there’s really no good 
translation. Just remember that it’s a set phrase used to express humble grati­
tude to those who made the meal that you’re about to receive possible. Even 
young kids say it in Japan. If they forget, their moms scold them. So never 
forget itadakimasu. And when you’re done with your meal, say gochisōsama 
(goh-chee-sohh-sah-mah). It’s another word of gratitude that has no English 
equivalent, but you never want to leave the table without saying it.

 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
Enjoying foods of all kinds
How often do you eat at home? If you eat at home three times per week, you 
can save a lot of money and stay healthier. The following sections introduce 
a variety of foods that you can enjoy at home.
Eating breakfast in two cultures
A Japanese breakfast can be downright exquisite — if you have the eyes (and 
palate) to see it that way. Following are some foods you can expect to find in 
a traditional Japanese breakfast:
	
✓	ご飯 gohan (goh-hahn) (cooked rice)
	
✓	ほうれん草のおひたし hōrensō no ohitashi (hohh-rehn-sohh noh oh-hee-
tah-shee) (boiled spinach seasoned with soy sauce)
	
✓	みそ汁 misoshiru (mee-soh-shee-roo) (soybean-paste soup)
	
✓	生たまご nama tamago (nah-mah tah-mah-goh) (raw egg)
	
✓	納豆 nattō (naht-tohh) (fermented soybeans)
	
✓	のり nori (noh-ree) (seaweed)
	
✓	漬け物 tsukemono (tsoo-keh-moh-noh) (pickled vegetables)
	
✓	焼き魚 yakizakana (yah-kee-zah-kah-nah) (grilled/broiled fish)
If a Western-style breakfast is more your speed, you can enjoy the following 
items, at least until you’re feeling more adventurous:
	
✓	バター batā (bah-tahh) (butter)
	
✓	ベーコン bēkon (behh-kohn) (bacon)
	
✓	ハム hamu (hah-moo) (ham)
	
✓	ジャム jamu (jah-moo) (jam)
	
✓	クロワッサン kurowassan (koo-roh-wahs-sahn) (croissant)
	
✓	紅茶 kōcha (kohh-chah) (black tea)
	
✓	目玉焼き medamayaki (meh-dah-mah-yah-kee) (fried egg)
	
✓	牛乳 gyūnyū (gyooo-nyooo) (milk)
	
✓	オレンジジュース orenji jūsu (oh-rehn-jee jooo-soo) (orange juice)
	
✓	シリアル shiriaru (shee-ree-ah-roo) (cereal)
	
✓	スクランブルエッグ sukuranburu eggu (soo-koo-rahn-boo-roo ehg-goo) 
(scrambled eggs)

110
Part I: Getting Started 
	
✓	ソーセージ sōsēji (sohh-sehh-jee) (sausage)
	
✓	トースト tōsuto (tohh-soo-toh) (toast)
Munching your lunch
In Japan, noodles are always popular lunchtime meals. The thick, white 
noodles that you may have seen in soups are udon (oo-dohn), and buckwheat 
noodles are soba (soh-bah). And don’t forget rāmen (rahh-mehn) noodles, 
which the Japanese adopted from China.
Rice dishes in big bowls are also very popular for lunch. These meals are 
called donburi (dohn-boo-ree) (big bowl) and feature a bowl of rice with dif­
ferent toppings. If you have cooked chicken and egg over the rice, it’s called 
oyako donburi (oh-yah-koh dohn-boo-ree). Oyako literally means parent-
child; it describes the chicken and the egg.
Here are some lunch options you may be more familiar with:
	
✓	チーズ chīzu (cheee-zoo) (cheese)
	
✓	ハンバーガー hanbāgā (hahn-bahh-gahh) (hamburger)
	
✓	ピザ piza (pee-zah) (pizza)
	
✓	サンドイッチ sandoicchi (sahn-doh-eet-chee) (sandwich)
	
✓	サラダ sarada (sah-rah-dah) (salad)
	
✓	スパゲッティー supagettī (soo-pah-geht-teee) (spaghetti)
	
✓	スープ sūpu (sooo-poo) (soup)
You can use these items to give your sandoicchi a little kick:
	
✓	ケチャップ kechappu (keh-chahp-poo) (ketchup)
	
✓	マスタード masutādo (mah-soo-tahh-doh) (mustard)
	
✓	マヨネーズ mayonēzu (mah-yoh-nehh-zoo) (mayonnaise)
	
✓	ピクルス pikurusu (pee-koo-roo-soo) (pickle)
Savoring dinner dishes
Japanese eat all kinds of ethnic foods, but here are some of the popular 
homemade dinner dishes:
	
✓	カレーライス karēraisu (kah-rehh-rah-ee-soo) (curry sauce served over 
cooked rice)
	
✓	マーボー豆腐 mābōdōfu (mahh-bohh-dohh-foo) (bean curd cooked with 
ground beef and chili peppers)

111
 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
	
✓	肉じゃが nikujaga (nee-koo-jah-gah) (meat, potatoes, and onion stewed in 
sweetened soy sauce)
	
✓	さしみ sashimi (sah-shee-mee) (sliced raw fish)
	
✓	ステーキ sutēki (soo-tehh-kee) (steak)
	
✓	てんぷら tenpura (tehn-poo-rah) (seafood, vegetables, and mushrooms 
with batter and deep fried)
	
✓	とんかつ tonkatsu (tohn-kah-tsoo) (breaded deep-fried pork cutlets 
served with shredded cabbage)
Sampling party foods
For a friendly and easy home party, Japanese often serve dishes that they 
cook right at the table, using a portable stove or electric hot plate. Instead of 
being stuck in the kitchen and missing the fun, the hosts can cook, eat, and 
chat with their friends at the same time. Common Japanese party offerings 
include the following:
	
✓	しゃぶしゃぶ shabushabu (shah-boo-shah-boo): Beef and vegetables 
cooked in a pot of boiling broth
	
✓	すき焼き sukiyaki (soo-kee-yah-kee): Beef and vegetables cooked in 
warishita (wah-ree-shee-tah), which is a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, 
and liquor
	
✓	寄せ鍋 yosenabe (yoh-seh-nah-beh): Japanese casserole of vegetables, 
fish, or meat
	
✓	焼き肉 yakiniku (yah-kee-nee-koo): Korean-style barbecue
Talking about foods you like and dislike
	
When you talk about your preferences in English, you use verbs such as to 
like, to love, and to hate. In Japanese, though, you use adjectives to express 
your likes and dislikes. For example, suki (soo-kee) (to like) is an adjective. 
If you want to say that you like pizza, you say Watashi wa piza ga suki desu. 
(wah-tah-shee wah pee-zah gah soo-kee deh-soo.) (I like pizza.) The transla­
tion becomes misleading here, so watch out: The item you like, pizza in this 
case, is marked by the subject-marking particle ga. You can’t use the direct 
object-marking particle o because you use o with a verb only.
If you know suki, you also have to know kirai (kee-rah-ee) (to hate). To say 
that you like or hate something a lot, add dai- (dah-ee), which means big, 
before suki or kirai, as in daisuki (dah-ee-soo-kee) (to like it a lot), and dai­
kirai (dah-ee-kee-rah-ee) (to hate it a lot). Now you have four adjectives that 

112
Part I: Getting Started 
you can use to express your likes and dislikes, you picky eater, you. Check 
out some examples of these adjectives in action:
私は魚が好きです。 Watashi wa sakana ga suki desu. (wah-tah-shee wah 
sah-kah-nah gah soo-kee deh-soo.) (I like fish.)
妹はチーズケーキが大好きです。 Imōto wa chīzu kēki ga daisuki desu! 
(ee-mohh-toh wah cheee-zoo kehh-kee gah dah-ee-soo-kee deh-soo!) (My 
little sister loves cheesecake a lot!)
妹は野菜が嫌いです。 Imōto wa yasai ga kirai desu. (ee-mohh-toh wah 
yah-sah-ee gah kee-rah-ee deh-soo.) (My little sister hates vegetables.)
私は納豆が大嫌いです。 Watashi wa nattō ga daikirai desu! (wah-tah-
shee wah naht-tohh gah dah-ee-kee-rah-ee deh-soo!) (I hate fermented 
soybeans a lot!)
Engaging in Common 
Household Activities
Your house is the nicest place to be, but keeping your house just the way 
you like it requires a lot of responsibilities. The next sections give you the 
Japanese words and phrases you need for keeping your home clean and safe.
Keeping your home clean
Keeping your home clean can make life a lot more comfortable. You may use 
these phrases as you do your weekly or yearly sōji (sohh-jee) (cleaning):
	
✓	部屋を掃除する heya o sōji suru (heh-yah oh sohh-jee soo-roo) (to clean 
the room)
	
✓	部屋をかたづける heya o katazukeru (heh-yah oh kah-tah-zoo-keh-roo) 
(to tidy up the room)
	
✓	埃をとる hokori o toru (hoh-koh-ree oh toh-roo) (to dust)
	
✓	窓をふく mado o fuku (mah-doh oh foo-koo) (to clean the windows)
	
✓	掃除機をかける sōjiki o kakeru (sohh-jee-kee oh kah-keh-roo) (to 
vacuum)
	
✓	床をふく yuka o fuku (yoo-kah oh foo-koo) (to mop the floor)

113
 Chapter 6: Speaking Japanese at Home
Performing a safety check
You don’t want to have a kaji (kah-jee) (fire) while you’re sleeping or have a 
dorobō (doh-roh-bohh) (thief) break into your home when you’re on vaca­
tion. Go over the following checklist when you go out or go to bed:
	
✓	暖房を切る danbō o kiru (dahn-bohh oh kee-roo) (to shut off the heat)
	
✓	電源を切る dengen o kiru (dehn-gehn oh kee-roo) (to shut off the power 
supply)
	
✓	ドアの鍵をかける doa no kagi o kakeru (doh-ah noh kah-gee oh kah-
keh-roo) (to lock the door)
	
✓	電気を消す denki o kesu (dehn-kee oh keh-soo) (to turn off the light)
	
✓	ガスの元栓をしめる gasu no motosen o shimeru (gah-soo noh moh-toh-
sehn oh shee-meh-roo) (to close the main gas valve)
	
✓	窓をしめる mado o shimeru (mah-doh oh shee-meh-roo) (to close the 
window)
Talking about What You Do Regularly
Different people have different daily habits. Do you always jog in the morn­
ing? Drink beer with dinner? Watch YouTube? Check e-mails? All of the 
above?
	
To express that you do something regularly, such as run, play tennis, go to 
work, brush your teeth, and so on, you can use the verb that expresses the 
activity and the verb iru (ee-roo) (to exist), in that order. Make sure to conju­
gate the verb that expresses the action in the te-form. (See Chapter 3 for the 
details on the te-form.) You can leave the verb iru as it is or use the polite 
form, imasu (ee-mah-soo).
For example, you can combine the verbs hashiru (hah-shee-roo) (to run) and 
iru to get hashitte iru (hah-sheet-teh ee-roo) or hashitte imasu (hah-sheet-
teh ee-mah-soo). Both phrases mean that someone runs regularly. It’s sort of 
like saying, “I run and exist every day.” Just be careful: hashitte iru also has 
an ongoing-action connotation that translates to I’m in the middle of running. 
The context helps determine which meaning is intended. If you say mainichi 
(mah-ee-nee-chee) (every day) before saying hashitte imasu, it obviously 
means a habitual activity — I run every day. If you say ima (ee-mah) (now) 
instead, the sentence means I’m in the middle of running now, which is a 

114
Part I: Getting Started 
progressive action. The following sentences use the te-form plus iru and 
express habitual actions:
お父さんはいつも寝ているよ！ Otōsan wa itsumo nete iru yo! (oh-tohh-
sahn wah ee-tsoo-moh neh-teh ee-roo yoh!) (My dad is always sleeping!)
ケンは毎日ピザを食べています。 Ken wa mainichi piza o tabete imasu. 
(kehn wah mah-ee-nee-chee pee-zah oh tah-beh-teh ee-mah-soo.) (Ken 
eats pizza every day.)
The alternative to using the te-form-plus-iru combination is to use the simple 
present tense:
毎朝新聞を読みます。 Maiasa shinbun o yomimasu. (mah-ee-ah-sah 
sheem-boon oh yoh-mee-mah-soo.) (I read the newspaper every day.)
週末は掃除をします。 Shūmatsu wa sōji o shimasu. (shooo-mah-tsoo 
wah sohh-jee oh shee-mah-soo.) (I clean [the house] every weekend.)

Fondue, Japanese style
Japanese often serve a sort of fondue called 
しゃぶしゃぶ shabushabu (shah-boo-shah-
boo) — a big pot of kelp broth placed on a 
portable stove on the dining table. You pick up a 
thin slice of beef with chopsticks, immerse it in 
the boiling broth, and swish it around for several 
seconds. You eat it right away with the dip of 
your choice (such as sesame paste dip or soy 
sauce and lime dip). Other ingredients include 
Chinese cabbage, garland chrysanthemum 
leaves, mushrooms, soybean curds, and gelatin 
noodles. Some people add thick white noodles 
called うどん udon (oo-dohn), leeks, and other 
ingredients.
Japanese beef is very expensive, but it’s also 
very tender and delicious. To produce this 
quality beef, farmers feed the cows beer and 
massage them with big brushes. So the next 
time you meet a well-groomed cow with beer 
on its breath, you’ll know that it has recently 
been to Japan.

Getting to Know You: 
Making Small Talk
In This Chapter
▶	Talking about the weather
▶	Conversing about your job
▶	Chatting about your family
▶	Understanding the verbs for to exist/to possess
▶	Exchanging contact information
O

ften, the conversations you have when you first meet people consist 
of statements about the weather, what you do, and where you’re from. 
This small talk helps you get to know new people. In this chapter, I show you 
how to talk about all these topics so you can start making new Japanese con­
nections. I also explain how to share your contact information so that you 
can keep in touch with your new friends.
Initiating Small Talk
You can initiate small talk with others in a number of ways. Saying “Excuse 
me” is always a good option. If you’re traveling, you can talk to your fellow 
passengers about where they’re going. If you’re at home, you can strike up 
a conversation with your neighbor about the day’s weather. So be open and 
initiate a conversation whenever you can by using the vocabulary I provide 
in the next sections.
Breaking the ice with “excuse me”
Small talk often starts with Sumimasen. (soo-mee-mah-sehn.) (Excuse me.). 
You use this phrase to break the ice. But afterward, you usually need to ask 
a few questions to strike up conversation. Depending on the type of informa­

120
Part II: Japanese in Action 
tion you’re looking for, you need to use different question words like doko 
(doh-koh) (where), dore (doh-reh) (which one), and nan-ji (nahn-jee) (what 
time). Chapter 3 summarizes the types of questions and provides a list of 
question words, but you can use these simple ice-breaking questions to make 
small talk:
	
✓	バス停はどこですか。 Basutē wa doko desu ka. (bah-soo-tehh wah doh-
koh deh-soo kah.) (Where is the bus stop?)
	
✓	今，何時ですか。 Ima, nan-ji desu ka. (ee-mah, nahn-jee deh-soo kah.) 
(What time is it now?)
Talking about where you’re going
When you’re traveling and feel like talking to the person seated next to you 
on the plane, bus, or train, why not begin a conversation by asking Dochira 
made desu ka. (doh-chee-rah mah-deh deh-soo kah.) (Where are you head­
ing to?) Dochira (doh-chee-rah) means which one or which way, but it can 
function as the polite version of doko (doh-koh) (where). Made (mah-deh) is 
a particle that means up to. To answer the question Dochira made desu ka, 
just replace dochira with the place name and drop the question particle ka 
(kah), as in Tōkyō made desu. (tohh-kyohh mah-deh deh-soo.) (I’m heading 
to Tokyo.).
Talkin’ the Talk
	
Richard is sitting in a bullet train in Japan. He wants to know what 
time it is but doesn’t have a watch, so he asks a woman who is sit­
ting next to him. (Track 14)
Richard:	
Sumimasen. Ima nan-ji desu ka.
	
soo-mee-mah-sehn. ee-mah nahn-jee deh-soo kah.
	
Excuse me. What time is it now?
Woman:	
4-ji 17-fun desu.
	
yoh-jee joo-nah-nah-foon deh-soo.
	
It’s 4:17.
Richard:	
Ā, sō desu ka. Dōmo.
	
ahh, sohh deh-soo-ka. dohh-mo.
	
Oh, really. Thank you.
Woman:

Discussing the weather
Discussing tenki (tehn-kee) (weather) is a tried-and-true way of making casual 
conversation because tenki seems to be a universally neutral topic. On a 
nice, clear day, try starting a conversation with Ii tenki desu ne. (eee tehn-
kee deh-soo neh.) (It’s nice today, isn’t it?). The following adjectives describe 
temperature and humidity:
	
✓	暖かい atatakai (ah-tah-tah-kah-ee) (warm)
	
✓	暑い atsui (ah-tsoo-ee) (hot)
	
✓	蒸し暑い mushi-atsui (moo-shee-ah-tsoo-ee) (muggy)
	
✓	寒い samui (sah-moo-ee) (cold)
	
✓	涼しい suzushii (soo-zoo-sheee) (cool)
	
You can use these adjectives by themselves in informal contexts. For example, 
when you’re at home, you can scream Atsui! (ah-tsoo-ee!) (Hot!). If you want 
to mention to your mom that it’s hot, assuming that she’ll agree with you, you 
can add the particle ne (neh), as in Atsui ne. (ah-tsoo-ee neh.) (It’s hot, isn’t 
it?). The sentence-ending particle ne is for confirmation. It invites your part­
ner’s agreement and makes your conversation flow more smoothly. If you 
feel hot, say it with ne because your conversation partner probably feels hot 
too — unless he or she is a cyborg.

122
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
In a polite/neutral or formal context, make sure to add desu (deh-soo) (to be) 
to the adjective you’re using to describe the weather. Adjectives always sound 
polite if they end in desu. (See Chapter 3 for more about desu.) For example, you 
can say Atsui desu. (ah-tsoo-ee deh-soo.) (It’s hot.) or Atsui desu ne. (ah-tsoo-ee 
deh-soo neh.) (It’s hot, isn’t it?) to your teacher, colleague, and boss.
Chatting About Your Life
After starting a conversation with the person seated next to you in the train 
or on the airplane, you can talk about what you do for living. If you want, you 
can also talk about your family.
Your job
To ask other people about their shigoto (shee-goh-toh) (jobs), you say 
O-shigoto wa nan desu ka. (oh-shee-goh-toh wah nahn deh-soo kah.) (What’s 
your job?), or you can use the abbreviated version, O-shigoto wa. (oh-shee-
goh-toh wah.) (How about your job?). Following are some occupations you or 
your conversational partner may hold:
	
✓	弁護士 bengoshi (behn-goh-shee) (lawyer)
	
✓	デザイナー dezainā (deh-zah-ee-nahh) (designer)
	
✓	医者 isha (ee-shah) (medical doctor)
	
✓	事務員 jimuin (jee-moo-een) (secretary)
	
✓	看護師 kangoshi (kahn-goh-shee) (nurse)
	
✓	経理士 keirishi (kehh-ree-shee) (accountant)
	
✓	研究員 kenkyūin (kehn-kyooo-een) (researcher)
	
✓	コック kokku (kohk-koo) (chef)
	
✓	教師 kyōshi (kyohh-shee) (teacher)
	
✓	音楽家 ongakuka (ohn-gah-koo-kah) (musician)
	
✓	プログラマー puroguramā (poo-roh-goo-rah-mahh) (programmer)
	
✓	ウエーター uētā (oo-ehh-tahh) (waiter)
	
✓	ウエートレス uētoresu (oo-ehh-toh-reh-soo) (waitress)
These terms express specific roles and functions. If you just want to say 
that you work for a kaisha (kah-ee-shah) (company) or that you’re an 
office worker, you can use the term kaishain (kah-ee-shah-een) (company 
employee). In fact, Japanese typically identify themselves as kaishain without 
specifying their specific job titles or roles in the kaisha.

123
 Chapter 7: Getting to Know You: Making Small Talk
Your family
Japanese has two terms for every one English word used to talk about one’s 
family — a polite term and a plain term. Which version you use depends on 
the context. In this case, you choose from three possible contexts:
	
✓	When you refer to someone else’s family, use the polite term.
	
✓	To talk about your own family members to nonfamily, use the plain term.
	
✓	When you talk to any one of your older family members other than your 
spouse, or when you talk about them in an informal way, you should use 
the polite term. For example, you can call out for your mother by saying 
Okāsan! Doko. (oh-kahh-sahn! doh-koh.) (Mom! Where are you?).
Table 7-1 lists several terms you may want to use when talking about your 
family.

Specifying Where You Live 
with the Verb Sumu
To express where you live, use the verb sumu (soo-moo) (to live) and the 
particle ni (nee). Using this verb can be a little tricky. Remember to take the 
te-form of this verb and add the verb iru (ee-roo) (to exist) right after it, as in 
sunde iru. Of course, you can also use its polite counterpart, imasu (ee-mah-
soo), as in sunde imasu. For example, Tōkyō ni sunde imasu. (tohh-kyohh 
nee soon-deh ee-mah-soo.) means I live in Tokyo. If you simply say Tōkyō ni 
sumu or Tōkyō ni sumimasu, it means I will live in Tokyo. rather than I cur­
rently live in Tokyo.
Conjugate the verb sumu (soo-moo) (to live/reside). It’s an u-verb.

Part II: Japanese in Action 
Existing and Possessing: 
The Verbs Iru and Aru
	
To tell someone that you have or possess something, have something to 
do, or have some relationship, use the verbs iru (ee-roo) and aru (ah-roo). 
They both mean to exist. That is, you use the verb to exist to mean to have in 
Japanese. I know it sounds strange, but it’s just one of those things. Another 
strange concept is that you choose the verb according to whether the item 
you possess is animate or inanimate:
	
✓	いる Iru is for animate items — things that can move by themselves, 
such as people and animals.
	
✓	ある Aru is for inanimate items — things that don’t move by themselves, 
such as books, money, plants, and houses.
So I have a boyfriend. is Watashi wa kareshi ga iru. (wah-tah-shee wah kah-
reh-shee gah ee-roo.), which literally means As for me, a boyfriend exists. 
Similarly, Alison has money. is Arison wa o-kane ga aru. (ah-ree-sohn wah 
oh-kah-neh gah ah-roo.), which literally means As for Alison, money exists. 
Getting used to the exist business?
Now you can talk about what you have or you don’t have, using the verbs iru 
and aru. When you’re speaking in a polite/neutral context, use the polite form 
of the verbs — imasu (ee-mah-soo) and arimasu (ah-ree-mah-soo), respec­
tively — which are both conjugated here. Iru is a ru-verb, but aru is an u-verb 
with a slight irregularity, so pay close attention to the negative form.

 Chapter 7: Getting to Know You: Making Small Talk
	
Don’t forget to put the particle ga at the end of the object or animal you’re claim­
ing exists — the particle tells your listener what the subject of your sentence is.
Look at the following examples and think about what you have and what you 
don’t have:
暇がありません。 Hima ga arimasen. (hee-mah gah ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (I 
don’t have free time.)
ペットがいます。 Petto ga imasu. (peht-toh gah ee-mah-soo.) (I have a 
pet.)
私は兄弟がいません。 Watashi wa kyōdai ga imasen. (wah-tah-shee wah 
kyohh-dah-ee gah ee-mah-sehn.) (I don’t have siblings.)
父はお金があります。 Chichi wa o-kane ga arimasu. (chee-chee wah oh-
kah-neh gah ah-ree-mah-soo.) (My father has money.)
宿題があります。 Shukudai ga arimasu. (shoo-koo-dah-ee gah ah-ree-
mah-soo.) (I have homework.)
The verbs iru and aru can also express the existence or the location of people 
and things. Just mark the item with the particle wa (wah) rather then ga (gah). 
For example
母はうちにいます。Haha wa uchi ni imasu. (hah-hah wah oo-chee nee 
ee-mah-soo.) (My mom is at home.)
郵便局はあそこにあります。 Yūbinkyoku wa asoko ni arimasu. (yooo-been-
kyoh-koo wah ah-soh-koh nee ah-ree-mah-soo.) (The post office is over there.)

 Chapter 7: Getting to Know You: Making Small Talk
	
Japanese always praise other’s family members, houses, clothes, and even 
pets, but when Japanese receive a compliment, they deny it no matter what. 
It’s a part of Japanese modesty, but these responses sometimes puzzle non-
Japanese who are used to saying or hearing My mom is pretty. and I love my 
house. So when you speak with Japanese, say nice things about them, but be 
ready to hear them reject your compliments.
Giving Out Your Contact Information
After having a good time chatting with a stranger on a train or airplane or 
at a party or conference, you may want to contact him or her again. These 
days, the easiest way to keep in touch with someone is to get his or her mēru 
adoresu (mehh-roo ah-doh-reh-soo) (e-mail address), but if you want to take 
the orthodox approach, you can ask for his or her denwa bangō (dehn-wah 
bahn-gohh) (phone number). You may even want to know the person’s jūsho 
(jooo-shoh) (address) too.
If you sense that this person may become an important part of your pro­
fessional or social life, make sure to collect all the information accurately. 
Exchanging meishi (mehh-shee) (business cards) is a good way of ensuring 
you have the person’s correct e-mail address, phone number, and so on. (Flip 
to Chapter 4 for details on the proper way to exchange business cards in 
Japan.)
The following phrases are useful when exchanging contact information:
	
✓	メールで連絡します。 Mēru de renraku shimasu. (mehh-roo deh rehn-
rah-koo shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll contact you via e‑mail.)
	
✓	電話番号は何ですか。 Denwa bangō wa nan desu ka. (dehn-wah bahn-
gohh wah nahn deh-soo kah.) (What’s your telephone number?)
	
✓	電話をしてください。 Denwa o shite kudasai. (dehn-wah oh shee-teh 
koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please call me.)
	
✓	住所を教えてください。 Jūsho o oshiete kudasai. (jooo-shoh oh oh-
shee-eh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please let me know your address.)
	
✓	これは私の名刺です。 Kore wa watashi no meishi desu. (koh-reh wah 
wah-tah-shee noh mehh-shee deh-soo.) (This is my business card.)
	
✓	よかったら連絡ください。 Yokattara renraku kudasai. (yoh-kaht-tah-
rah, rehn-rah-koo koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Get in touch, if you like.)

f you can ask for directions in Japanese, you’re ready to go anywhere 
in Japan. Japanese will enjoy talking to you and offering their help. This 
chapter gives you the words and phrases necessary for receiving directions.
Figuring Out Where Places Are Located
One of the most basic questions to help you get where you need to go is 
where. If you can’t ask “where” questions and understand the answers, you’ll 
probably be spending a lot of time at home. That’s no good, so the following 
sections help you ask where things are located so that you aren’t stuck in the 
house.
Asking “where” questions
Suppose you want to go to the city hall. You know it’s near the subway 
station, but you can’t see it. What do you do? Why, you ask a kind-looking 
stranger where the city hall is. If no one looks nice, ask someone who looks 
mean. People are usually nicer than they look.
Where in Japanese is doko (doh-koh). But you can’t just say doko. You’ll 
sound like you have a very bad concussion and don’t know where you are. 
Mention what you’re looking for first — for example, shiyakusho (shee-yah-
koo-shoh) (city hall).

132
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
Put the topic particle wa after the place you’re looking for. Then add doko 
desu ka (doh-koh deh-soo kah) (where is) or doko ni arimasu ka (doh-koh nee 
ah-ree-mah-soo kah) (where is it located). You can use either one, but doko 
desu ka is shorter and probably easier for you to say. Here are a couple of 
examples of how to form “where” questions:
病院はどこですか。 Byōin wa doko desu ka. (byohh-een wah doh-koh 
deh-soo kah.) (Where is the hospital?)
銀行はどこにありますか。 Ginkō wa doko ni arimasu ka. (geen-kohh 
wah doh-koh nee ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Where is the bank located?)
The places you want to look for may include the following:
	
✓	アメリカ大使館 Amerika taishikan (ah-meh-ree-kah tah-ee-shee-kahn) 
(American embassy)
	
✓	バス停 basu-tei (bah-soo-tehh) (bus stop)
	
✓	病院 byōin (byohh-een) (hospital)
	
✓	映画館 eigakan (ehh-gah-kahn) (movie theater)
	
✓	駅 eki (eh-kee) (train/subway station)
	
✓	学校 gakkō (gahk-kohh) (school)
	
✓	ガソリンスタンド gasorin sutando (gah-soh-reen soo-tahn-doh) 
(gas station)
	
✓	銀行 ginkō (geen-kohh) (bank)
	
✓	博物館 hakubutsukan (hah-koo-boo-tsoo-kahn) (museum)
	
✓	コンビ二 konbini (kohn-bee-nee) (convenience store)
	
✓	薬屋 kusuriya (koo-soo-ree-yah) (pharmacy)
	
✓	市役所 shiyakusho (shee-yah-koo-shoh) (city hall)
	
✓	図書館 toshokan (toh-shoh-kahn) (library)
	
✓	役場 yakuba (yah-koo-bah) (town hall)
	
✓	郵便局 yūbinkyoku (yooo-been-kyoh-koo) (post office)
Getting basic location/position answers
	
The easiest way to answer “where” questions is to point and say “there,” so 
many Japanese whom you ask for directions will simply point their index fin­
gers while saying Asoko desu. (ah-soh-koh deh-soo.) (It’s over there.). Other 
location words you may hear in conjunction with pointing are koko (koh-koh) 
and soko (soh-koh). (Notice how they all end in oko?) Table 8-1 shows you 
what each word means in English and the location it refers to.

You use tonari (toh-nah-ree) (next to) only if you’re dealing with two similar 
things like two buildings, two people, or two seats. For two different things 
that are close to each other, you use yoko (yoh-koh) to express next to. For 
example, if you want to say There is a police officer next to the museum. in 
Japanese, say Keisatsukan ga hakubutsukan no yoko ni imasu. (kehh-sah-
tsoo-kahn gah hah-koo-boo-tsoo-kahn noh yoh-koh nee ee-mah-soo.)
	
You can’t use one of the position words in Table 8-2 all by itself to describe 
the location of something. If you say My house is on the left, no one will under­
stand you. You have to indicate what your house is to the left of as a reference 
point. Use the particle no to create a modifier phrase that gives the refer­
ence point, and place it right before one of the position words from Table 8-2. 
For example, ginkō no hidari means the bank’s left, or to the left of the bank. 
Remember: The position aida (between) requires two reference points; con­
nect them with the particle to.
The following phrases put some of these modifiers in context:
図書館は学校の後ろです。 Toshokan wa gakkō no ushiro desu. (toh-
shoh-kahn wah gahk-kohh noh oo-shee-roh deh-soo.) (The library is 
behind the school.)
郵便局は図書館と市役所の間です。 Yūbinkyoku wa toshokan to shi­
yakusho no aida desu. (yooo-been-kyoh-koo wah toh-shoh-kahn toh 
shee-yah-koo-shoh noh ah-ee-dah deh-soo.) (The post office is between the 
library and the city hall.)
学校は病院の前です。 Gakkō wa byōin no mae desu. (gah-kohh wah 
byohh-een noh mah-eh deh-soo.) (The school is in front of the hospital.)
銀行は病院の隣です。 Ginkō wa byōin no tonari desu. (geen-kohh wah 
byohh-een noh toh-nah-ree deh-soo.) (The bank is next to the gas station.)
Specifying how far or how near you are to a location is often very helpful 
information. The word for far is tōi (tohh-ee), and the word for near is chikai 
(chee-kah-ee). To be more informative, you can use adverbs such as chotto 
(choht-toh) (a little bit), sugu (soo-goo) (right, just), or totemo (toh-teh-moh) 
(very much). Take a look at these examples:
ちょっと遠いですよ。 Chotto tōi desu yo. (choht-toh tohh-ee deh-soo 
yoh.) (It’s a bit far.)
すぐそこです。 Sugu soko desu. (soo-goo soh-koh deh-soo.) (It’s right 
there.)
とても近いです。 Totemo chikai desu. (toh-teh-moh chee-kah-ee deh-
soo.) (It’s very close.)

Pinpointing an exact location
Having someone tell you that the bank is “over there” is all well and good, but 
it’s not effective when you can’t easily tell where “over there” is. To be really 
helpful, directions have to pinpoint specific locations unambiguously. Words 
and phrases such as north, the third building, and five minutes’ walk all help to 
clarify where something is located. I give you the words you need in the sec­
tions that follow.
Using cardinal points
Migi (mee-gee) (right) and hidari (hee-dah-ree) (left) are great. However, after 
you turn 180 degrees or make a couple of lefts and rights, you may get con­
fused. To avoid any confusion, your helper may specify cardinal points such 
as north and east and ordinal points such as northwest and southwest.
	
✓	東 higashi (hee-gah-shee) (east)
	
✓	北 kita (kee-tah) (north)
	
✓	南 minami (mee-nah-mee) (south)
	
✓	西 nishi (nee-shee) (west)
	
✓	北西 hokusei (hoh-koo-sehh) (northwest)
	
✓	北東 hokutō (hoh-koo-tohh) (northeast)
	
✓	南西 nansei (nahn-sehh) (southwest)
	
✓	南東 nantō (nahn-tohh) (southeast)
Specifying the order
Ordinal-number phrases such as the first and the second are essential for pin-
pointing houses, buildings, intersections, and streets. Remember that you can

４本目の道 yon-hon-me no michi (yohn-hohn-meh noh mee-chee) (the 
fourth street)
Stating how far
You can express how far away a location is by specifying either the time it 
takes to get somewhere or the actual distance. In urban areas in Japan, many 
people use public transportation instead of automobiles. As a result, direc­
tions often include an estimate of the number of minutes it would take to 
walk from the nearest station. Japanese use the counters -fun (foon) for min­
utes and -jikan (jee-kahn) for hours. Following are a few examples:
ここから駅まで１０分です。 Koko kara eki made 10-pun desu. (koh-koh 
kah-rah eh-kee mah-deh joop-poon deh-soo.) (The train station is ten min­
utes away from here.)
歩いて３０分です。 Aruite 30-pun desu. (ah-roo-ee-teh sahn-joop-poon 
deh-soo.) (Thirty minutes on foot.)
空港までバスで１時間です。 Kūkō made basu de ichi-jikan desu. (kooo-
kohh mah-deh bah-soo deh ee-chee-jee-kahn deh-soo.) (It’s an hour to the 
airport by bus.)
東京から新幹線で２時間です。 Tōkyō kara shinkansen de ni-jikan desu. 
(tohh-kyohh kah-rah sheen-kahn-sehn deh nee-jee-kahn deh-soo.) (It takes 
two hours from Tokyo by Shinkansen [bullet train].)
Of course, you can also specify the actual distance. For example, Eki made 
ni-kiro desu. (eh-kee mah-deh nee-kee-roh deh-soo.) means It’s two kilometers 
to the railway station.
To say approximately or about, you add gurai (goo-rah-ee) after the time or 
distance expression as in the following examples:
ここから車で５分ぐらいです。 Koko kara kuruma de go-fun gurai desu. 
(koh-koh kah-rah koo-roo-mah deh goh-foon goo-rah-ee deh-soo.) (It’s 
about five minutes from here by car.)
ここから１マイルぐらいです。 Koko kara ichi-mairu gurai desu. (koh-
koh kah-rah ee-chee mah-ee-roo goo-rah-ee deh-soo.) (It’s about one mile 
from here.)

 Chapter 8: Asking for Directions
Finding Your Way to Your Destination
“Where” questions are great, but after you know the where, you probably 
also want to know how to get there. In the following sections, I help you get 
the information you need to get where you’re going.
Requesting travel instructions
	
You can ask a fellow traveler at the bus stop or in the train or subway station 
for directions. Chances are you’ll find someone who is heading in the same 
direction as you. If so, your journey will become easier and more fun. Just 
follow your new best friend (cautiously, of course).
To ask “how do I get to . . .” questions, use the question word dōyatte (dohh-
yaht-teh) (how). Place it right after the destination phrase and the particle wa 
(wah) in the question. You can see it in the following examples:
アメリカ大使館はどうやって行くんですか。 Amerika taishikan wa 
dōyatte iku-n-desu ka. (ah-meh-ree-kah tah-ee-shee-kahn wah dohh-yaht-
teh ee-koon-deh-soo kah.) (How do I get to the American embassy?)
市役所はどうやって行くんですか。 Shiyakusho wa dōyatte iku-n-desu 
ka. (shee-yah-koo-shoh wah dohh-yaht-teh ee-koon-deh-soo kah.) (How 
do I get to city hall?)

You may be asking about a very specific location, like a restaurant called Fuji. 
Before asking How can I get to Fuji?, you may want to ask Do you know the 
restaurant called Fuji? This way, the person knows you aren’t talking about 
the famous mountain but rather a restaurant. To ask do you know, say shitte 
imasu ka (sheet-teh ee-mah-soo kah). To say . . . called . . . , say the proper 
name, followed by to iu (toh ee-oo or toh yooo) and the kind of location (in 
this case, a restaurant), as in Fuji to iu resutoran (foo-jee toh ee-oo reh-soo-
toh-rahn) (a restaurant called Fuji). You can use this construction for asking 
about things other than directions, too:
由紀さんという人を知っていますか。 Yuki-san to iu hito o shitte imasu 
ka. (yoo-kee sahn toh ee-oo hee-toh oh sheet-teh ee-mah-soo kah.) (Do 
you know the person called Yuki?)
岡崎というところを知っていますか。 Okazaki to iu tokoro o shitte 
imasu ka. (oh-kah-zah-kee toh ee-oo toh-koh-roh oh sheet-teh ee-mah-soo 
kah.) (Do you know the place called Okazaki?)
たこ焼きという食べ物を知っていますか。 Takoyaki to iu tabemono o 
shitte imasu ka. (tah-koh-yah-kee toh ee-oo tah-beh-moh-noh oh sheet-
teh ee-mah-soo kah.) (Do you know the food called takoyaki?)
Finding out whether you need transportation to get to your destination is 
always a good idea. Ask whether your destination is within walking distance. 
Use the u-verb aruku (ah-roo-koo) (to walk) in the “can” form in this case. 
(Check out Chapter 13 for a discussion of this verb form.)
ここから秋葉原まで歩けますか。 Koko kara Akihabara made aruke­
masu ka. (koh-koh kah-rah ah-kee-hah-bah-rah mah-deh ah-roo-keh-mah-
soo kah.) (Can I walk to Akihabara from here?)
市役所は歩いて行けますか。 Shiyakusho wa aruite ikemasu ka. (shee-
yah-koo-shoh wah ah-roo-ee-teh ee-keh-mah-soo kah.) (Can I get to city 
hall on foot?)
If your destination isn’t within walking distance, ask which transportation 
method to use. Chapter 16 shows you how to ask “which” questions and has 
an extensive inventory of transportation terms.
Referring to landmarks
When giving directions, people often include several landmarks that the 
traveler has to pass to get to his or her destination. Table 8-3 provides some

As in English, michi (mee-chee) (road) and tōri (tohh-ree) (street) are subtly 
different. They both have two functions — to connect locations and to accom­
modate stores and houses. And though they each perform both functions, 
the emphasis of michi is on the connection and the emphasis of tōri is on the 
accommodation of shops or homes.
	
You can combine landmarks with the ordinal numbers introduced in Chapter 
5 to give pretty specific directions, such as mit-tsu-me no shingō (meet-tsoo-
meh noh sheen-gohh) (the third traffic light) or itsu-tsu-me no kado (ee-tsoo-
tsoo-meh noh kah-doh) (the fifth corner).
Providing actions with directions
Most people use an imperative like Go straight on this street for five minutes 
or a request sentence such as Please make a turn at the second intersection. 
In Japanese, directions use a request sentence that consists of a verb in the 

142
Part II: Japanese in Action 
te-form and kudasai (koo-dah-sah-ee). Kudasai literally means Give it to me 
(or to us), but when used right after a verb in the te-form, it basically means 
Do [such and such], please. (Literally: Do [such and such] and give that to me 
as a favor.) It creates a polite request sentence.
Conjugating verbs to the te-form is the first step of making a request sen­
tence. You can look at Chapter 3 to find out how to get the te-form, but for 
your convenience, I list the dictionary forms and the te-forms of the verbs 
that you need for giving directions in Table 8-4.

 Chapter 8: Asking for Directions
Of course, a person giving you directions needs to be able to tell you exactly 
where to move. Where do you make a turn? What do you cross? Which street 
do you take? The Japanese language specifies these locations by marking 
them with the particle o directly following the word for the location or land­
mark. (A smart person like you may wonder why you need the direct object 
particle o here, but let the scholars of grammar wonder about that.)
交差点を曲がる kōsaten o magaru (kohh-sah-tehn oh mah-gah-roo) (to 
make a turn at the intersection)
橋を渡る hashi o wataru (hah-shee oh wah-tah-roo) (to cross the bridge)
この道を歩く kono michi o aruku (koh-noh mee-chee oh ah-roo-koo) (to 
walk along this road)
銀行を過ぎる ginkō o sugiru (geen-kohh oh soo-gee-roo) (to pass the 
bank)
Specify the direction of your movement by marking it with the particle ni.
右に曲がる migi ni magaru (mee-gee nee mah-gah-roo) (to make a right 
turn)
東に行く higashi ni iku (hee-gah-shee nee ee-koo) (to go east)
Here are a few sample directions that put all these concepts together:
三番通りを南に行ってください。 San-ban-dōri o minami ni itte kudasai. 
(sahn-bahn-dohh-ree oh mee-nah-mee nee eet-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Go 
south on Third Street, please.)
あの角を右に曲がってください。 Ano kado o migi ni magatte kudasai. 
(ah-noh kah-doh oh mee-gee nee mah-gaht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please 
make a right at that corner.)
駅まで歩いてください。 Eki made aruite kudasai. (eh-kee mah-deh ah-
roo-ee-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Walk to the railway station, please.)
新橋から浅草線に乗ってください。 Shinbashi kara Asakusa-sen ni notte 
kudasai. (sheen-bah-shee kah-rah ah-sah-koo-sah-sehn nee noht-teh koo-
dah-sah-ee.) (Take Asakusa-line from Shinbashi, please.)
Making directions flow
To make directions flow, Japanese connect them with the word sorekara 
(soh-reh-kah-rah) (and then), as in these examples:

144
Part II: Japanese in Action 
この道をまっすぐ行ってください。 それから, 三つ目の角を右に曲がって
ください。 Kono michi o massugu itte kudasai. Sorekara, mit-tsu-me no 
kado o migi ni magatte kudasai. (koh-noh mee-chee oh mahs-soo-goo 
eet-teh koo-dah-sah-ee. soh-reh-kah-rah, meet-tsoo-meh noh kah-doh oh 
mee-gee-nee mah-gaht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Go straight on this street and 
then make a right at the third corner.)
橋を渡ってください。 それから, 交番を過ぎてください。 Hashi o watatte 
kudasai. Sorekara, kōban o sugite kudasai. (hah-shee oh wah-taht-teh 
koo-dah-sah-ee. soh-reh-kah-rah, kohh-bahn oh soo-gee-teh koo-dah-sah-
ee.) (Cross the bridge and then pass the kōban [police box].)
They may also say sōsuruto (sohh-soo-roo-toh) (then) to show what you will 
see afterward. For example, Fumikiri o watatte kudasai; sōsuruto, hidari 
ni resutoran ga arimasu. (foo-mee-kee-ree oh wah-taht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee; 
sohh-soo-roo-toh, hee-dah-ree nee reh-soo-toh-rahn gah ah-ree-mah-soo.) 
translates to Please cross the railroad crossing; then you’ll see a restaurant on 
your left.

veryone needs to eat. Sometimes, you may choose to get your food from 
your favorite restaurant. Other times, you may feel like cooking and 
head to the grocery store or farmers’ market to pick up fresh meats and veg­
etables to prepare your meal. This chapter gives you the terms you need to 
know when you’re eating out and when you’re picking up groceries.
Eating Out at Fast-Food and 
Sit-Down Restaurants
Whether you’re out to eat in Japan or the United States, you’re bound to find 
all kinds of delicious options, from fast food establishments to more tradi­
tional sit-down restaurants.
Practice conjugating the verb chūmon suru (chooo-mohn soo-roo) (to order). 
It’s actually a combination of the noun chūmon (order) and the verb suru (to 
do), so you can just conjugate the suru part. Yes, it’s an irregular verb. (See 
Chapter 13 for more about the verb suru.)

Part II: Japanese in Action 
In this section, I give you the fast-food words and phrases you need whenever 
you decide to eat out. You’re still responsible for the check, though!
Ordering fast food
In Japan, you can find some of the familiar fast-food restaurants you see in 
the States. Here are the names of some common fast-food dishes in Japan — 
or at least in Japanese:
	
✓	チーズバーガー chīzu bāgā (cheee-zoo bahh-gahh) (cheeseburger)
	
✓	フライドチキン furaido chikin (foo-rah-ee-doh chee-keen) (fried chicken)
	
✓	フライポテト furai poteto (foo-rah-ee poh-teh-toh) (French fries)
	
✓	ハンバーガー hanbāgā (hahn-bahh-gahh) (hamburger)
	
✓	ホットドッグ hotto doggu (hoht-toh dohg-goo) (hot dog)
	
✓	アイスティー aisutī (ah-ee-soo teee) (iced tea)
	
✓	コーヒー kōhī (kohh-heee) (coffee)
	
✓	コーラ kōra (kohh-rah) (cola)
	
✓	オレンジジュース orenjijūsu (oh-rehn-jee jooo-soo) (orange juice)
	
✓	シェイク sheiku (sheh-ee-koo) (milkshakes)
	
✓	ピザ piza (pee-zah) (pizza)
	
✓	テリヤキバーガー teriyaki bāgā (teh-ree-yah-kee bahh-gahh) 
(teriyaki burger)
You may have to answer a few questions when you order at a fast-food joint. 
O-mochi kaeri desu ka. (oh-moh-chee kah-eh-ree deh-soo kah.) means Will you 
take it home? or To go? Kochira de omeshiagari desu ka. (koh-chee-rah deh 
oh-meh-shee-ah-gah-ree deh-soo kah.) means Will you eat here? or For here? If 
you hear one of these questions, just answer with hai (hah-ee) (yes) or Īe (eee-
eh) (no). If you can’t get by with a simple yes or no, say one of the following:
	
✓	持って帰ります。 Motte kaerimasu. (moht-teh kah-eh-ree-mah-soo.) 
(I’ll take it home.)
	
✓	ここで食べます。 Koko de tabemasu. (koh-koh deh tah-beh-mah-soo) 
(I’ll eat here.)
	
If you want to contrast how you treat or feel about two items — for example, 
I like fish but hate meat — you can highlight each term by marking it with wa 
(wah). You can place wa after the noun you want to highlight and the particle 
that’s already there. Just remember to drop the original particle if it’s the sub­
ject-marking particle ga (gah) or the object-marking particle o (oh). (Chapter 3 
gives you more information on using these particles.) Here are some examples:

149
 Chapter 9: Dining Out and Going to the Market
このレストランはパスタはおいしいです。 でも,ピザはまずいです。 
Kono resutoran wa pasuta wa oishii desu. Demo, piza wa mazui desu. 
(koh-noh reh-soo-toh-rahn wah pah-soo tah wah oh-ee-sheee deh-soo.

delicious, but pizza is bad.)

go to bars.)

niku wa tabemasen. (sah-rah-dah wah tah-beh-mah-soo. deh-moh, nee-

レストランではお酒を飲みます。 でも, 家ではお酒を飲みません。

restaurants. However, I don’t drink sake at home.)

Making a reservation
Japanese often line up in front of the most-popular restaurants, and they 
don’t mind waiting for an hour or more. But if you don’t want to wait in line, 
make a reservation over the phone.

151
 Chapter 9: Dining Out and Going to the Market
Japanese say to make a reservation by saying to do a reservation, which is 
yoyaku o suru (yoh-yah-koo oh soo-roo). Yoyaku is a noun, so all you have 
to worry about is the suru part. Remember that suru is an irregular verb as 
you check out these conjugations: 
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
予約をする
yoyaku o suru
yoh-yah-koo oh soo-roo
予約をしない
yoyaku o shinai

予約をし（ます）
yoyaku o shi(masu)
yoh-yah-koo oh shee
(-mah-soo)
予約をして
yoyaku o shite
yoh-yah-koo oh shee-teh
	
To say you want to make a reservation, add -tai (tah-ee) at the end of the stem 
form of this verb: yoyaku shi-tai (yoh-yah-koo shee-tah-ee). See Chapter 12 for 
information on using -tai.
To make a reservation, first let the restaurant’s host or hostess know when 
you want to arrive. Table 9-1 shows you how to pronounce the basic time 
ranges that you’re most likely to need for making your dinner reservation. 
(For the basics of how to tell time in Japanese, including the concepts of a.m., 
p.m., and o’clock, turn to Chapter 5.)

Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
When you talk about an approximate time, add goro (goh-roh) after the time 
phrase. Roku-ji goro (roh-koo-jee goh-roh) means about 6:00, and roku-ji han 
goro (roh-koo-jee hahn goh-roh) means about 6:30.
After you establish a reservation time, let the restaurant know how many 
people are in your party by using a counter. Counters are short suffixes that 
directly follow numbers. As I explain in Chapter 5, the counter you use depends 
on the item you’re counting. So you can’t just say go (goh) (five) when you 
have five people in your party. You have to say go-nin (goh-neen) because 
-nin (neen) is the counter for people. But watch out for the irregular hitori 
(hee-toh-ree) (one), futari (foo-tah-ree) (two), and yonin (yoh-neen) (four).

Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
In Japanese, you often form a statement using -n-desu (n-deh-soo) in conversa­
tion, as Makoto does in the preceding Talkin’ the Talk. The effect of -n-desu is 
to encourage your partner to respond to your statements. See Chapter 5 for 
more about n-desu.
	
Japanese say yoroshiku (yoh-roh-shee-koo) after asking a favor of someone or 
after making a request, such as a reservation at a restaurant. In this context, 
it means Please take good care of it for me. You don’t say anything like that in 
English, so just think of it as thank you. Yoroshiku is one of those phrases that 
you have to use your intuition and cultural understanding rather than transla­
tions to understand. But if you can use it appropriately, you’ll really sound like 
a native Japanese speaker!
Ordering in a restaurant
How do you order in a restaurant (that is, the kind where the food comes to 
your table)? Whether you go to a four-star establishment or the corner pub, 
your waiter or waitress will ask you questions like the following:
	
✓	ご注文は。 Gochūmon wa. (goh-chooo-mohn wah.) (Your order?)
	
✓	何になさいますか。 Nani ni nasaimasu ka. (nah-nee nee nah-sah-ee-
mah-soo kah.) (What will you have?)
	
✓	お飲み物は。 O-nomimono wa. (oh-noh-mee-moh-noh wah.) (Anything to 
drink?)
Eating blowfish carefully
For a long time, Japanese have admired ふ
ぐ fugu (foo-goo) (blowfish) as the most deli­
cious fish. The only problem: It’s poisonous — 
or at least the ovaries and liver are especially 
poisonous. If the person preparing fugu acci­
dentally slices into either of those two places, 
eating the fugu can kill you. People in Japan 
have actually died because of improper prepa­
ration of fugu by unlicensed chefs.
That’s why only trained and licensed chefs are 
legally permitted to cut, clean, and serve fugu. 
They remove the dangerous parts and wash 
the remaining portion of the fish very carefully, 
using a tremendous amount of water.
Fugu is one of the most expensive delicacies 
in Japan and costs about $200 for a single fish. 
Japanese are truly gourmets. They seek out 
exquisite tastes, risking their lives and paying 
a fortune in the process.

roo wah.) (Today’s special?)
	
To list several dishes, use to (toh) between each dish to link them. Think of to 
as a verbal comma or the word and.
To specify the quantity of each item that you want to order, use -tsu, the 
counter that applies to food items — hito-tsu (hee-toh-tsoo) (one), futa-tsu 
(foo-tah-tsoo) (two), mit-tsu (meet-tsoo) (three), and so forth. (See Chapter 5 
for a more in-depth explanation of counters.)

order a teishoku (tehh-shoh-koo) (set meal), like sashimi teishoku and ten­
pura teishoku.
	
Wondering what to do if you can’t read the Japanese menu at a restaurant? 
Don’t worry. Most restaurants in Japan have colored pictures on the menus or 
life-sized wax models of the food in their windows. The easiest way to order 
food is to follow this simple formula: Say watashi wa (wah-tah-shee wah) (as 
for me), point to the picture of the dish on the menu, say kore o (koh-reh oh) 
(this one plus direct object particle), and say onegaishimasu (oh-neh-gah-ee-
shee-mah-soo) (I’d like to ask you) or kudasai (koo-dah-sah-ee) (please give 
me) at the end.

Chatting with the waiter or waitress
At some point, you may need to ask your server questions or give him or her 
feedback on your food. Here are some phrases to help you do those very 
things:
	
✓	ちょっと変な味です。 Chotto henna aji desu. (choh-toh hehn-nah ah-
jee-deh-soo.) (It tastes sort of strange.)
	
✓	これは何ですか。 Kore wa nan desu ka. (koh-reh wah nahn deh-soo 
kah.) (What is this?)
	
✓	これは焼けていますか。 Kore wa yakete imasu ka. (koh-reh wah yah-
keh-teh ee-mah-soo kah.) (Is it well done?)
	
✓	おいしいですね。 Oishii desu ne. (oh-ee-sheee deh-soo neh.) (It’s deli­
cious, isn’t it?)
	
✓	お水を下さい。 O-mizu o kudasai. (oh-mee-zoo oh koo-dah-sah-ee.) 
(Water, please.)
	
✓	お手洗いはどこですか。 O-tearai wa doko desu ka. (oh-teh-ah-rah-ee 
wah doh-koh deh-soo kah.) (Where is the bathroom?)
	
✓	とてもおいしかったです。 Totemo oishikatta desu! (toh-teh-moh oh-ee-
shee-kaht-tah deh-soo!) (That was very delicious!)
	
To express what you can and what you can’t eat, use the verb taberu (tah-beh-
roo) (to eat) in the potential form: taberaremasu (tah-beh-rah-reh-mah-soo) 
(I can eat) and taberaremasen (tah-beh-rah-reh-mah-sehn) (I can’t eat). For 
example, Watashi wa ebi ga taberaremasen. (wah-tah-shee wah eh-bee gah 
tah-beh-rah-reh-mah-sehn.) (I can’t eat shrimp.) Head to Chapter 13 for details 
on the potential form.
Paying for your meal
When and how you pay for your meal can vary by restaurant. You may have 
to pay upfront, or you may be able to pay after eating. Most restaurants accept 
kurejitto kādo (koo-reh-jeet-toh kahh-doh) (credit cards), but many of them still 
only accept genkin (gehn-keen) (cash), especially in smaller cities and rural 
areas. Clarifying these details before eating is your best bet. Then all you have 
to do is request your bill. Here are the phrases you need to know:
	
✓	別々にお願いします。 Betsubetsu ni onegai shimasu. (beh-tsoo-beh-
tsoo nee oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Please give us separate checks.)
	
✓	チェックお願いします。 Chekku onegai shimasu. (chehk-koo oh-neh-
gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Check please.)

159
 Chapter 9: Dining Out and Going to the Market
	
✓	一緒にお願いします。 Isshoni onegai shimasu. (ees-shoh-nee oh-neh-
gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Please give us one check.)
	
✓	領収書お願いします。 Ryōshūsho onegai shimasu. (ryohh-shooo-shoh 
oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Receipt please.)
	
You don’t have to tip at any restaurant in Japan, but you still get very good 
service about 99 percent of the time. For very expensive meals, the restaurant 
warns the customers, in writing, that the tip is automatically included in their 
bill as a sābisuryō (sahh-bee-soo-ryohh) (service fee). So you still don’t have 
to think about offering a voluntary gratuity.
Going Grocery Shopping
Restaurants are great, but if you want to save time and money, go shopping 
for your food. If you go to a supermarket, you can get most of the items you 
need in one trip, including the following:
	
✓	アイスクリーム aisukurīmu (ah-ee-soo-koo-reee-moo) (ice cream)
	
✓	バター batā (bah-tahh) (butter)
	
✓	チーズ chīzu (cheee-zoo) (cheese)
	
✓	牛乳 gyūnyū (gyooo-nyooo) (milk)
	
✓	ジュース jūsu (jooo-soo) (juice)
	
✓	米 kome (koh-me) (uncooked rice)
	
✓	果物 kudamono (koo-dah-moh-noh) (fruits)
	
✓	肉 niku (nee-koo) (meat)
	
✓	パン pan (pahn) (bread)
	
✓	魚 sakana (sah-kah-nah) (fish)
	
✓	たまご tamago (tah-mah-goh) (eggs)
	
✓	野菜 yasai (yah-sah-ee) (vegetables)
Going to a butcher
Whether your butcher has a special shop or just works behind the counter at 
a regular grocery store, he or she can be a meat-eater’s best friend. Here are 
some of the meats you can get from a butcher:

160
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
✓	豚肉 butaniku (boo-tah-nee-koo) (pork)
	
✓	牛肉 gyūniku (gyooo-nee-koo) (beef)
	
✓	マトン maton (mah-tohn) (mutton)
	
✓	七面鳥 shichimenchō (shee-chee-mehn-chohh) (turkey)
	
✓	鶏肉 toriniku (toh-ree-nee-koo) (chicken)
Processed, cured, and cooked meats are very convenient. If you need to whip 
up a quick dinner, you may want to buy one of these:
	
✓	ベーコン bēkon (behh-kohn) (bacon)
	
✓	ハム hamu (hah-moo) (ham)
	
✓	コーンビーフ kōn bīfu (kohhn beee-foo) (corned beef)
	
✓	ローストビーフ rōsuto bīfu (rohh-soo-toh beee-foo) (roast beef)
	
✓	ソーセージ sōsēji (sohh-sehh-jee) (sausage)
Purchasing fresh fish
Japanese are big fish-eaters. If you’re also a fish lover, the fish market is the 
place for you. The names of fish are often written in katakana at the fish 
market (and in the following list), but some are also written in kanji or hira­
gana. Remember the names of your favorite fish when you make the trip:
	
✓	ハマチ hamachi (hah-mah-chee) (yellowtail)
	
✓	ヒラメ hirame (hee-rah-meh) (flounder)
	
✓	マグロ maguro (mah-goo-roh) (tuna)
	
✓	マス masu (mah-soo) (trout)
	
✓	サバ saba (sah-bah) (mackerel)
	
✓	サケ sake (sah-keh) (salmon)
	
✓	スズキ suzuki (soo-zoo-kee) (Japanese sea bass)
	
✓	タイ tai (tah-ee) (red snapper)
	
✓	タラ tara (tah-rah) (cod)
	
If you go to Japan, try buying fresh fish at the Tsukiji (tsoo-kee-jee) Market. 
It’s the largest and most famous fish market in Tokyo, and it’s always crowded 
with professional fresh-fish buyers and sellers. Major sushi restaurants in

 Chapter 9: Dining Out and Going to the Market
Tokyo buy fish directly from Tsukiji. There’s no room in the market for for­
mality, and everyone is friendly. If you’re interested visiting Tsukiji, go early 
because it’s busiest before 8 a.m. and starts closing down in the late morning.
Buying vegetables and fruit
Include some of the following vegetables and fruits on your shopping list. 
Some are always written in katakana (as I’ve done in the following list), 
but others are written in katakana, hiragana, or kanji. Regardless of the 
Japanese script used, these items are good for you:
	
✓	バナナ banana (bah-nah-nah) (bananas)
	
✓	ブドウ budō (boo-dohh) (grapes)
	
✓	ダイコン daikon (dah-ee-kohn) (Japanese radish)
	
✓	ジャガイモ jagaimo (jah-gah-ee-moh) (potatoes)
	
✓	カキ kaki (kah-kee) (perssimons)
	
✓	キャベツ kyabetsu (kyah-beh-tsoo) (cabagge) 
	
✓	ミカン mikan (mee-kahn) (tangerines)
	
✓	ナシ nashi (nah-shee) (pears)
	
✓	ナス nasu (nah-soo) (eggplant)
	
✓	ネギ negi (neh-gee) (green onions)
	
✓	ニンジン ninjin (neen-jeen) (carrots)
	
✓	ピーマン pīman (peee-mahn) (green peppers)
	
✓	レモン remon (reh-mohn) (lemons)

I

 love kaimono (kah-ee-moh-noh) (shopping). When I feel great, I shop. When 
I feel depressed, I shop. And when I get a raise — you guessed it — I shop. 
If you love shopping too, this chapter is for you. It’s full of the information and 
vocabulary you need to know if you’re going to go shopping. Specifically, you 
discover how to explain what you’re looking for, how to compare both prices 
and quality in Japanese, and how to pay for your merchandise.
Naming Shops and Stores
You can refer to some types of shops and stores using the suffix ya (yah) 
(shop) in a friendly manner. For example:
	
✓	花屋 hana-ya (hah-nah-yah) (flower shop)
	
✓	本屋 hon-ya (hohn-yah) (bookstore)
	
✓	自転車屋 jitensha-ya (jee-tahn-shah-yah) (bicycle shop)
	
✓	薬屋 kusuri-ya (koo-soo-ree-yah) (drugstore)
	
✓	靴屋 kutsu-ya (koo-tsoo-yah) (shoe store)
	
✓	おもちゃ屋 omocha-ya (oh-moh-cha-yah) (toy store)
	
✓	パン屋 pan-ya (pahn-yah) (bakery)
	
✓	酒屋 saka-ya (sah-kah-yah) (liquor shop)
Some stores are conventionally referred to by English loan words with some 
modifications. Here are a few examples:

164
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
✓	ブティック butikku (boo-teek-koo) (boutique)
	
✓	デパート depāto (deh-pahh-toh) (department store)
	
✓	ホームセンター hōmusentā (hohh-moo-sehn-tahh) (home center, home 
improvement store)
	
✓	コンビニ konbini (kohn-bee-nee) (convenience store)
	
✓	スーパー sūpā (sooo-pahh) (supermarket)
Telling a Salesperson What 
You’re Looking For
If you have a particular item in mind, step into a store and say the name of 
the item and wa arimasu ka (wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah) (do you have). Or you 
can use the u-verb sagasu (sah-gah-soo) (to look for) to state that you’re look­
ing for, for example, furoshiki (foo-roh-shee-kee). (These big, smooth, square 
Japanese wrapping cloths have beautiful patterns and colors.) Here’s how to 
conjugate sagasu:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
探す
sagasu
sah-gah-soo
探さない
sagasanai
sah-gah-sah-nah-ee
探し（ます）
sagashi(masu)
sah-gah-shee(-mah-soo)
探して
sagashite
sah-gah-shee-teh
	
If you say sagasu or sagashimasu, it means you will look for something or 
you regularly look for something. In order to mean that you are looking for 
something, conjugate the verb sagasu to the te-form, which is sagashite (sah-
gah-shee-teh), and then add the verb iru (ee-roo) or its polite form imasu (ee-
mah-soo) (to exist). Sagashite iru or sagashite imasu means you are looking for 
something. (For more on basic verb forms such as the te-form, see Chapter 3.)
	
If you’re traveling in Japan, perhaps you have some specific souvenirs in mind 
that you know you want to pick up. Visit the fun and friendly souvenir shops 
in Kyōto (kyohh-toh), Nara (nah-rah), and Asakusa (ah-sah-koo-sah), where 
you can say that you’re looking for the following popular souvenirs:
	
✓	茶碗 chawan (chah-wahn) (rice bowl, teacup that’s wider than it is tall and 
used for tea ceremonies)
	
✓	風呂敷 furoshiki (foo-roh-shee-kee) (wrapping cloths)
	
✓	下駄 geta (geh-tah) (type of wooden clogs)

165
 Chapter 10: Shopping Made Easy
	
✓	箸 hashi (hah-shee) (chopsticks)
	
✓	花瓶 kabin (kah-been) (vase)
	
✓	傘 kasa (kah-sah) (umbrella)
	
✓	着物 kimono (kee-moh-noh) (kimono)
	
✓	くし kushi (koo-shee) (comb)
	
✓	人形 ningyō (neen-gyohh) (doll [for display only])
	
✓	お茶 o-cha (oh-chah) (green tea)
	
✓	折り紙 origami (oh-ree-gah-mee) (origami)
	
✓	お皿 o-sara (oh-sah-rah) (plate)
	
✓	せんべい senbei (sehn-behh) (rice cracker)
	
✓	扇子 sensu (sehn-soo) (fan)
	
✓	湯飲み yunomi (yoo-noh-mee) (teacup that’s taller than it is wide and 
used for drinking regular green tea)
	
Express your request by using a verb in the te-form (see Chapter 3) and kuda­
sai (koo-dah-sah-ee) as in the following examples:
その花瓶を見せてください。 Sono kabin o misete kudasai. (soh-noh kah-
been oh mee-seh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please show me that vase.)
この茶碗を包んでください。 Kono chawan o tsutsunde kudasai. (koh-noh

Exploring the Variety of 
a Department Store
Depāto (deh-pahh-toh) (department stores) are very convenient. Their nedan 
(neh-dahn) (prices) are a little high, but they offer a variety of quality items 
and burandohin (boo-rahn-doh-heen) (designer-brand items). They also offer 
good sābisu (sahh-bee-soo) (service), I suppose. You can find the following 
items in a depāto:
	
✓	婦人服 fujinfuku (foo-jeen-foo-koo) (women’s clothes)
	
✓	楽器 gakki (gahk-kee) (musical instruments)
	
✓	宝石 hōseki (hohh-seh-kee) (jewelry)
	
✓	鞄 kaban (kah-bahn) (luggage)

167
 Chapter 10: Shopping Made Easy
	
✓	家具 kagu (kah-goo) (furniture)
	
✓	化粧品 keshōhin (keh-shohh-heen) (cosmetics)
	
✓	子供服 kodomofuku (koh-doh-moh-foo-koo) (children’s clothes)
	
✓	靴 kutsu (koo-tsoo) (shoes)
	
✓	紳士服 shinshifuku (sheen-shee-foo-koo) (men’s clothes)
	
✓	書籍 shoseki (shoh-seh-kee) (books)
	
✓	スポーツ用品 supōtsu yōhin (soo-pohh-tsoo yohh-heen) (sporting goods)
	
Which floor do you want to go to? To answer this question, use the counter 
-kai. For example, 2-kai (nee-kah-ee) means second floor. For more info on 
Japanese counters, see Chapter 5.
	
Store clerks speak very politely. One of the polite phrases that they often use 
is de gozaimasu (deh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo). It’s a polite version of the verb 
desu (deh-soo) (to be). So instead of saying Hōseki wa nana-kai desu. (hohh-
seh-kee wah nah-nah-kah-ee deh-soo.) (Jewelry is on the seventh floor.), they 
say Hōseki wa nana-kai de gozaimasu. (hohh-seh-kee wah nah-nah-kah-ee 
deh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo.).
Department stores have fixed business hours. Before you head out shopping, 
you can find out a department store’s hours by asking Eigyō jikan wa nan-ji 
kara nan-ji made desu ka. (ehh-gyohh jee-kahn wah nahn-jee kah-rah nahn-jee 
mah-deh deh-soo kah.) (From what time to what time are your business hours?). If 
you’re already at the store and you want to ask What time does your store close? 
say Heiten wa nan-ji desu ka. (hehh-tehn wah nahn-jee deh-soo kah.)
Going Clothes Shopping
When you go shopping for yōfuku (yohh-foo-koo) (clothes) do you look for 
quality items that you can wear for years, or do you buy cheap items that you 
just wear for one season? Whatever your approach, check out the following 
sections to make sure you get just what you want.
Considering the clothing and 
accessories you need
Some pieces of clothing are staples. For example, you pretty much always 
need shitagi (shee-tah-gee) (underwear). Other clothing items and accesso­
ries, such as a nekkuresu (nehk-koo-reh-soo) (necklace), are fun to have but 
won’t cause your wardrobe to fall apart if you don’t own them. Check out the 
following list of clothes and accessories:

✓	スニーカー sunīkā (soo-neee-kaha) (sneakers)
	
✓	トランクス torankusu (toh-rahn-koo-soo) (boxers, men’s underwear)
	
✓	ズボンzubon (zoo-bohn) (pants)
Examining the color
What’s your favorite iro (ee-roh) (color)? When you buy clothes, check out all 
the colors and pick the one that looks best on you.
	
✓	赤 aka (ah-kah) (red)
	
✓	青 ao (ah-oh) (blue)
	
✓	茶色 chairo (chah-ee-roh) (brown)

You can just add the particle no (noh) after nouns and adjectives to mean a . . . 
one. For example, aka no (ah-kah noh) means a red one.
茶色のはありますか。 Chairo no wa arimasu ka. (chah-ee-roh noh wah 
ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you have a brown one?)
色がきれいなのを探しています。 Iro ga kirei na no o sagashite imasu. 
(ee-roh gah kee-rehh na noh oh sah-gah-shee-teh ee-mah-soo.) (I’m look­
ing for something with a pretty color.)
Trying something on
When you need to get permission to do something, start with chotto (choht-
toh), a word with far more uses than a dictionary can suggest. The English 
translation is usually a little, but you hear it in situations where no literal 
translation works. You can think of the phrase chotto kite mite mo ii desu ka 
(choht-toh kee-teh mee-teh moh eee deh-sooo kah) as having a meaning close 
to Can I try it on for a minute? (Literally: Can I try it on a little?). In this context, 
chotto makes it sound as if you’ll be done as soon as possible.
	
When you want to try doing something, use the verb in the te-form and add 
miru. For example, tabete miru (tah-beh-teh mee-roo) means to try eating. Kite 
miru (kee-teh mee-roo) means to try wearing or to try on.
	
Ask for permission by using the verb in the te-form (see Chapter 3) with the 
phrase mo ii desu ka (moh eee deh-soo kah). For example, Kite mite mo ii 
desu ka. (kee-teh mee-teh moh eee deh-soo kah.) means Is it okay to try it on?
After you have the okay to try on a piece of clothing, head to the shichakush­
itsu (shee-chah-koo-shee-tsoo) (fitting room). Use the following phrases to 
express what you think of the outfit:
	
✓	丁度いいです。 Chōdo ii desu. (chohh-doh eee deh-soo.) (It’s just right.)
	
✓	ちょっと小さいです。 chotto chīsai desu (choht-toh cheee-sah-ee deh-
soo) (a little small)
	
✓	ちょっと大きいかな。 Chotto ōkii kana. (choht-toh ohh-keee kah-nah.) 
(Is it a little big for me?)
	
✓	長いです。 Nagai desu. (nah-gah-ee deh-soo.) (It’s long.)
	
✓	少し短いです。 sukoshi mijikai desu (soo-koh-shee mee-jee-kah-ee 
deh-soo) (a little short)

Note that the verb kiru (kee-roo), which means to wear, is a ru-verb. Here’s 
how to conjugate it:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciaiton
着る
kiru
kee-roo
着ない
kinai
kee-nah-ee
着（ます）
ki(masu)
kee(-mah-soo)
着て
kite
kee-teh
	
Although kiru is the most general verb that means to wear, you can’t use it for 
everything you wear. It’s good only for items you put above your waist, such 
as sweaters and shirts, or on your entire body, such as long dresses or coats. 
For items you wear below your waist (think skirts, pants, socks, and shoes), 
use the verb haku (hah-koo). For items you put over your head, such as caps 
and hats, use kaburu (kah-boo-roo). For eyeglasses or sunglasses, use the 
verb kakeru (kah-keh-roo) or suru (soo-roo), which means to do. For other 
accessories, use suru or tsukeru (tsoo-keh-roo) (to attach).
Talking about sizing
Trying on clothing is important, but shopping for a T-shirt is pretty easy. You can 
often avoid going to the fitting room if you know your saizu (sah-ee-zoo) (size).
	
✓	S サイズ S saizu (eh-soo sah-ee-zoo) (small)
	
✓	M サイズ M saizu (eh-moo sah-ee-zoo) (medium)
	
✓	L サイズ L saizu (eh-roo sah-ee-zoo) (large)
	
✓	XL サイズ XL saizu (ehk-koo-soo eh-roo sah-ee-zoo) (extra large)
Buying a dress is more complicated than shopping for a T-shirt. Use the 
counter -gō (gohh) when sizing up your choices. (For more info on using 
Japanese counters and Japanese numbers, check out Chapter 5.)
Women’s dress sizes in Japan are three sizes less than they are in America.

In Japan, length is specified in metric units. If your waist is 30 inchi (sahn-jooo 
een-chee) (30 inches), it’s 76.2 senchi (nah-nah-jooo-roh-koo tehn nee sehn-
chee) (76.2 centimeters). To find your size in centimeters, just multiply your 
size in inches by 2.54 (1 inch = 2.54 centimeters). Carry a little dentaku (dehn-
tah-koo) (calculator) with you if you shop in Japan.
	
The particle ga (gah) (but), as it’s used in the following Talkin’ the Talk dia­

 Chapter 10: Shopping Made Easy
Deciding What You Want to Buy
Finding a good deal is impossible without carefully comparing the shōhin 
(shohh-heen) (merchandise). When you shop, look at the quality and the 
functions of the product closely and compare several similar items you’re 
interested in. Ask yourself which one is better/best.
Making comparisons, grammar-wise, is much easier in Japanese than in 
English. In English, you need to conjugate the adjective, like pretty-prettier-
prettiest, but in Japanese, you don’t have to! Kirei (kee-reh-ee) (pretty), 
remains kirei; you use other words to make the comparison. The following 
sections show you how to make different comparisons and get you comfort­
able using demonstrative adjectives.
Using demonstrative adjectives
	
If you see a nice item in a store window, ask the clerk to show it to you. How 
do you specify the item that you want to see? Most of the time, you can point 
at it with your finger and use the demonstrative pronoun kore (koh-reh) (see 
Chapter 3). But what if a yunomi (yoo-noh-mee) (teacup) and a kyūsu (kyooo-
soo) (teapot) are right next to each other in the store window, and your finger 
doesn’t have a laser pointer attached to it? If you say kore, the clerk will say 
dore (doh-reh) (which one?), and you’ll have to say kore again, and the clerk 
will have to say dore again. To end this frustrating and repetitious conversa­
tion, change kore to kono and add the common noun you’re referring to — in 
this case, kono yunomi (koh-noh yoo-noh-mee) (this teacup) or kono kyūsu 
(koh-noh kyooo-soo) (this teapot). 
Similarly, sore (soh-reh) (that one near you) and are (ah-reh) (that one over 
there) become sono (soh-noh) and ano (ah-noh), respectively, when followed 
by a common noun. (If you want to know more about sore and are, check out 
Chapter 3.) Even the question word dore (doh-reh) (which one) must become 
dono when followed by a common noun. Wow, too many forms? If you think 
about it, the change is very systematic: The ending re becomes no. Kono, 
sono, and ano are all demonstrative adjectives. Dono is their question coun­
terpart. That’s why they’re used with a common noun. Check out Table 10-1’s 
breakdown of the Japanese demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative 
adjective as well as the following examples to straighten everything out.

静岡のお茶はどれですか。 Shizuoka no o-cha wa dore desu ka. (shee-
zoo-oh-kah noh oh-chah wah doh-reh deh-soo kah.) (Which one is the tea 
produced in Shizuoka?)
	
The particle wa (wah) marks the topic the speaker wants to talk about, so the 
item in question must already be familiar to both the speaker and the listener. 
As a result, a question word like dore (doh-reh) (which one) or dono o-cha 
(doh-noh oh-chah) (which tea) can’t be marked by the topic particle wa.

175
 Chapter 10: Shopping Made Easy
Comparing two items
	
To make a comparison between two items in Japanese, you just need the 
Japanese equivalent of than, which is the particle yori (yoh-ree). Place yori 
right after the second item in the comparison. Take a look at a few examples 
to see this concept in action:
古い家具は新しい家具よりいいです。 Furui kagu wa atarashii kagu yori 
ii desu. (foo-roo-ee kah-goo wah ah-tah-rah-sheee kah-goo yoh-ree eee 
deh-soo.) (Old furniture is better than new furniture.)
私の車はあなたの車より高いです。 Watashi no kuruma wa anata no 
kuruma yori takai desu. (wah-tah-shee noh koo-roo-mah wah ah-nah-tah 
noh koo-roo-mah yoh-ree tah-kah-ee deh-soo.) (My car is more expensive 
than your car.)
この店はあの店よりサービスがいいです。 Kono mise wa ano mise yori 
sābisu ga ii desu. (koh-noh mee-seh wah ah-noh mee-seh yoh-ree sahh-
bee-soo gah eee deh-soo.) (This store has better service than that store.)
	
To ask a friend or sales clerk Which one is better, remember that which one in 
Japanese is dore (doh-reh) or dochira (doh-chee-rah) and that you only use 
dochira when the question is about two items. (I tell you how to ask a ques­
tion about three or more items in the following section.) Here are the steps for 
constructing an out-of-two comparison question:
	
1.	 List the two items being compared at the beginning of the sentence.
	
2.	 Add the particle to (toh) (and) after each item, just to make it look like a 
list.
	
3.	 Insert the question word dochira, followed by the subject-marking par­
ticle ga (gah).
	
	 You can’t use the topic particle wa (wah) after dochira. Actually, you 
can’t use wa after any question word. So your choice is limited to ga in 
this case.
	
4.	 Add the adjective with the question particle ka (kah).
Did you get lost? If you did, these examples will hopefully help clear things up:
これと, あれと, どちらがいいですか。 Kore to, are to, dochira ga ii desu 
ka. (koh-reh toh, ah-reh toh, doh-chee-rah gah eee deh-soo kah.) (Which 
one is better, this one or that one?)

176
Part II: Japanese in Action 
ジェシカと, 私と, どちらが好きですか。 Jeshika to, watashi to, dochira 
ga suki desu ka. (jeh-shee-kah toh, wah-tah-shee toh, doh-chee-rah gah 
soo-kee deh-soo kah.) (Who do you like, Jessica or me?)
お金と, 名声と, どちらが大事ですか。 O-kane to, meisei to, dochira ga 
daiji desu ka. (oh-kah-neh toh, mehh-sehh toh, doh-chee-rah gah dah-ee-
jee deh-soo kah.) (Which one is more important, money or reputation?)
You can answer these comparison questions a few different ways, but here’s 
the simplest one: Just say the item of your choice with the verb desu (deh-
soo) (to be). For example, if someone asks you Piza to, sushi to, dochira ga 
suki desu ka. (pee-zah toh, soo-shee toh, doh-chee-rah gah soo-kee deh-soo 
kah.) (Which one do you like better, pizza or sushi?), you can answer with Piza 
desu. (pee-zah deh-soo.) (Pizza.) or Sushi desu. (soo-shee deh-soo.) (Sushi.), 
depending on which one you like better.
Comparing three or more items
	
To express the best or the most in Japanese, just use the adverb ichiban (ee-
chee-bahn) (the most/the best), which literally means number one. Simply 
place ichiban right before the adjective. Look at the following examples and 
see how easy forming -est and most sentences in Japanese is:
この車は一番大きいです。 Kono kuruma wa ichiban ōkii desu. (koh-noh 
koo-roo-mah wah ee-chee-bahn ohh-keee deh-soo.) (This car is the biggest.)
この車は一番高級です。 Kono kuruma wa ichiban kōkyū desu. (koh-noh 
koo-roo-mah wah ee-chee-bahn kohh-kyooo deh-soo.) (This car is the most 
luxurious.)
トムは一番やさしいです。 Tomu wa ichiban yasashii desu. (toh-moo 
wah ee-chee-bahn yah-sah-sheee deh-soo.) (Tom is the kindest.)
If you want to specify the domain in which an item is the most or the best, such 
as “in the class,” “in the United States,” or “in the world,” insert a noun that 
specifies the domain, along with the particle de (deh), right before ichiban.
この車はアメリカで一番大きいです。 Kono kuruma wa Amerika de ich­
iban ōkii desu. (koh-noh koo-roo-mah wah ah-meh-ree-kah deh ee-chee-
bahn ohh-keee deh-soo.) (This car is the biggest in America.)
この車は世界で一番高級です。 Kono kuruma wa sekai de ichiban kōkyū 
desu. (koh-noh koo-roo-mah wah seh-kah-ee deh ee-chee-bahn kohh-
kyooo deh-soo.) (This car is the most luxurious in the world.)
トムはクラスで一番優しいです。 Tomu wa kurasu de ichiban yasashii 
desu. (toh-moo wah koo-rah-soo deh ee-chee-bahn yah-sah-sheee deh-
soo.) (Tom is the kindest in the class.)

177
 Chapter 10: Shopping Made Easy
	
To ask which item is the best among three or more items, list them by using 
the particle to (toh); add two particles, de (deh) and wa (wah); and use the 
question words dare (dah-reh), doko (doh-koh), or dore (doh-reh). Use dare 
for people, doko for places, and dore for other items, including foods, cars, 
animals, plants, games, and academic subjects. All three words mean which 
one. (As I explain in the preceding section, you can’t use dochira to mean 
which one in this context because you use dochira only for asking a question 
about two items.) Then add ichiban. Take a look:
ベスと，メアリーと, ケンと, ジョンでは, だれが一番優しいですか。 
Besu to, Mearī to, Ken to, Jon de wa, dare ga ichiban yasashii desu 
ka. (beh-soo toh, meh-ah-reee toh, kehn toh, john deh wah, dah-reh gah 
ee-chee-bahn yah-sah-sheee deh-soo kah.) (Among Beth, Mary, Ken, and 
John, who is the kindest?)
ボストンと, 東京と, シカゴでは, どこが一番寒いですか。 Bosuton 
to, Tōkyō to, Shikago de wa, doko ga ichiban samui desu ka. (boh-soo-
tohn toh, tohh-kyohh toh, shee-kah-goh deh wah, doh-koh gah ee-chee-
bahn sah-moo-ee deh-soo kah.) (Among Boston, Tokyo, and Chicago, 
which one is the coldest?)
ハンバーガーと, ホットドッグと, ピザでは, どれが一番好きですか。 
Hanbāgā to, hotto doggu to, piza de wa, dore ga ichiban suki desu ka. 
(hahn-bahh-gahh toh, hoht-toh dohg-goo toh, pee-zah deh wah, doh-reh 
gah ee-chee-bahn soo-kee deh-soo kah.) (Among hamburgers, hot dogs, 
and pizza, which one do you like the best?)
Sometimes you want to specify the category of the items among which the 
comparison is made, like out of foods, out of the students in the class, or among 
the cities in the country. If so, specify the category at the beginning of the ques­
tion and place two particles, de (deh) and wa (wah), right after it. Remember 
that you have to use nani (nah-nee) (what) rather than dore (doh-reh) (which 
one). So, if you’re specifying a category rather than giving a list, use dare (dah-
reh) (who) for people, doko (doh-koh) (where) for locations, and nani (nah-
nee) (what) for other items. Switching dore and nani is a bit cumbersome, isn’t 
it? You deserve a table to help you sort things out, so check out Table 10-2.

Look at some “which one” questions concerning a category of items:
このクラスでは誰が一番やさしいですか。 Kono kurasu de wa dare 
ga ichiban yasashii desu ka. (koh-noh koo-rah-soo deh wah dah-reh gah 
ee-chee-bahn yah-sah-sheee deh-soo kah.) (Who is the kindest in this class?)
日本の町ではどこが一番きれいですか。 Nihon no machi de wa doko ga 
ichiban kirei desu ka. (nee-hohn noh mah-chee deh wah doh-koh gah 
ee-chee-bahn kee-rehh deh-soo kah.) (Out of Japanese cities, which one is 
most beautiful?)
食べ物では何が一番好きですか。 Tabemono de wa nani ga ichiban suki 
desu ka. (tah-beh-moh-noh deh wah nah-nee gah ee-chee-bahn soo-kee 
deh-soo kah.) (Which food do you like best? [Literally: Among foods, which 
one do you like the best?])
The simplest way to answer these questions is to use desu. If someone asks 
you Amerika de wa doko ga ichiban samui desu ka. (ah-meh-ree-kah deh 
wah doh-koh gah ee-chee-bahn sah-moo-ee deh-soo kah.) (Which place is the 
coldest in America?), you can answer by saying Arasuka desu! (ah-rah-soo-
kah deh-soo!) (Alaska!).
You Gotta Pay to Play: Buying 
Your Merchandise
At the end of a successful shopping venture, you get to go home with all 
kinds of new goodies. But first you have to pay for those goodies. The follow­
ing sections reveal how to discuss prices, state your intention to buy some­
thing, and pay for your merchandise.
Identifying prices
In Japan, bargaining isn’t a common practice except in a few places, like 
Akihabara (ah-kee-hah-bah-rah), the famous Electric Town. But you do need 
to have some idea of how to talk about prices. Here’s a list of the basic 
pricing-related vocabulary to help you out:
	
✓	ちょっと高いです。 Chotto takai desu. (choht-toh tah-kah-ee deh-soo.) 
(It’s a little expensive.)
	
✓	いくらですか。 Ikura desu ka. (ee-koo-rah deh-soo kah.) (How much is it?)
	
✓	まあまあ安いですね。 Māmā yasui desu ne. (mahh mahh yah-soo-ee 
deh-soo neh.) (It’s relatively cheap.)

Stating that you want to buy something
When you’re ready to make your purchase, you need to be able to say kau 
(kah-oo) (to buy). Here’s how to conjugate this u-verb (remember to watch 
out for the w sound that appears in the negative form):
Japanese Script

kau
kah-oo
買わない
kawanai
kah-wah-nah-ee
買い（ます）
kai(masu)
kah-ee(-mah-soo)
買って

When you decide to buy something at a store, mention the item and say o 
kudasai (oh koo-dah-sah-ee) or o onegai shimasu (oh oh-neh-gah-ee shee-
mah-soo). Kudasai literally means give/sell it to me, whereas onegai shi­
masu literally means something like beg/ask you to do it. So onegai shimasu 
can be used in a variety of contexts where you want to ask someone to do 
something — it’s not limited to giving or selling. Accordingly, kudasai is 
more straightforward; use it when you want to buy something as opposed to 
onegai shimasu.
これを下さい。 Kore o kudasai. (koh-reh oh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please give 
this one to me.)
あれをお願いします。 Are o onegaishimasu. (ah-reh oh oh-neh-gah-ee-
shee-mah-soo.) (That one, please.)
あの人形を下さい。 Ano ningyō o kudasai. (ah-noh neen-gyohh oh koo-
dah-sah-ee.) (I’ll take that doll.)
Paying for your purchase
Whether you prefer to pay with genkin (gehn-keen) (cash) or kurejitto kādo 
(koo-reh-jeet-toh kahh-doh) (credit card), chances are you’ll need the follow­
ing words and phrases when paying for your purchases in Japanese:
	
✓	円 en (ehn) (yen)
	
✓	硬貨 kōka (kohh-kah) (coins)
	
✓	お札 o-satsu (oh-sah-tsoo) (bills)
	
✓	お返し o-kaeshi (oh-kah-eh-shee) (return)
	
✓	お釣り o-tsuri (oh-tsoo-ree) (change)
	
✓	レシート reshīto (reh-sheee-to) (receipt)
	
✓	財布 saifu (sah-ee-foo) (wallet)

Chapter 11
Going Out on the Town
In This Chapter
▶	Perusing your entertainment options
▶	Describing your recent outing
▶	Initiating plans with friends
I

 bet that your machi (mah-chee) (town) is full of great opportunities for 
fun. Read the shinbun (sheen-boon) (newspaper), pick up a few zasshi 
(zahs-shee) (magazines), or surf the Intānetto (een-tahh-neht-toh) (Internet) 
to find out what’s going on. Perhaps the local museum is hosting an exhibit 
or a new movie that you’re dying to see is playing at the cinema. Maybe you 
want to head to a club or try out your karaoke skills. Come on; get up off the 
couch, invite your friends to join you in your adventures, and then go have 
some fun!
Checking Out Entertaining Activities
Pick your favorite type of entertainment. Do you want to dance, sing, play 
games, or drink? No need to limit yourself here. You can do all four at the 
same time! You can also visit an art museum or catch a show. The following 
sections give you the words and phrases you need to know when partaking in 
a variety of fun activities while you’re out on the town.
Getting cultured at museums and galleries
If your daily life is filled with hassles and headaches, your heart deserves to 
be cleansed, nourished, and rejuvenated with a little culture. Why not check 
out one of these places?
	
✓	美術館 bijutsukan (bee-joo-tsoo-kahn) (art museum)
	
✓	画廊 garō (gah-rohh) (art galleries)

184
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
✓	博物館 hakubutsukan (hah-koo-boo-tsoo-kahn) (museums)
	
✓	図書館 toshokan (toh-shoh-kahn) (libraries)
Of course, you need to be aware of when these institutions open and close 
for the day if you’re going to visit them. Conjugate the u-verbs aku (ah-koo) 
(to open) and shimaru (shee-mah-roo) (to close).

Now that you know how to say those verbs in Japanese, take a look at these 
helpful sample questions that you may want to ask:
博物館は何時に開きますか。 Hakubutsukan wa nan-ji ni akimasu ka. 
(hah-koo-boo-tsoo-kahn wah nahn-jee nee ah-kee-mah-soo kah.) (What 
time does the museum open?)
何時に閉まりますか。 Nan-ji ni shimarimasu ka. (nahn-jee nee shee-mah-
ree-mah-soo kah.) (What time does it close?)
日曜日はお休みですか。 Nichiyōbi wa oyasumi desu ka. (nee-chee-yohh-
bee wah oh-yah-soo-mee deh-soo kah.) (Is it closed on Sundays?)
Heading to the theater
Visiting theaters lets you really feel the passion of the performers. And just 
about everyone enjoys going to a movie theater. The following words and 
phrases are useful when heading to the theater to see a performance or 
watch a movie:
	
✓	バレー barē (bah-rehh) (ballet)
	
✓	チケット chiketto (chee-keht-toh) (ticket)

185
 Chapter 11: Going Out on the Town
	
✓	映画 eiga (ehh-gah) (movie)
	
✓	映画館 eigakan (ehh-gah-kahn) (movie theater)
	
✓	劇場 gekijō (geh-kee-johh) (theater for performances)
	
✓	インターミッション intāmisshon (een-tahh-mee-shohn) (intermission)
	
✓	コンサート konsāto (kohn-sahh-toh) (concert)
	
✓	ミュージカル myūjikaru (myooo-jee-kah-roo) (musical)
	
✓	芝居 shibai (shee-bah-ee) (play)
Here are some example sentences that help you ask for various kinds of tick­
ets at shows and movies:
シニア一人お願いします。 Shinia hitori onegaishimasu. (shee-nee-ah 
hee-toh-ree oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (One senior citizen, please.)
一万円の席をお願いします。 Ichiman-en no seki o onegaishimasu. (ee-
chee-mahn-ehn noh seh-kee oh oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (A 10,000-
yen seat, please.)
大人二人お願いします。 Otona futari onegaishimasu. (oh-toh-nah foo-
tah-ree oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (Two adults, please.)
大人二人と子ども一人お願いします。 Otona futari to kodomo hitori 
onegaishimasu. (oh-toh-nah foo-tah-ree toh koh-doh-moh hee-toh-ree oh-
neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (Two adults and one child, please.)
Kabuki
歌舞伎 Kabuki (kah-boo-kee), which began in 
the 17th century, is one of the most popular types 
of traditional theater in Japan. All the action 
takes place on a dynamic, revolving stage.
The actors (all males, even in female roles) 
wear heavy makeup and colorful, spectacular 
costumes. Watch how they move their necks 
and fingers and how they walk and sit down. 
It’s amazing.
The Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo is world famous. 
The theater has large restaurants where you 
can grab a quick dinner during intermission. It 
also rents earphones that provide English com­
mentary and explanations on the play’s plot, 
music, and actors.
Other Japanese traditional theater arts include 
能 Nō (nohh) (Noh), a musical theater devel­
oped in the 14th century, where actors wear 
masks, and 文楽 bunraku (boon-rah-koo) 
(Bunraku), a puppet theater developed in the 
17th century.

Use the counter -mai (mah-ee) for counting tickets because tickets are usually 
flat. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion on counters.)
Drinking and dancing at bars and clubs
Having a drink at home is usually much cheaper than going to a bā (bahh) 
(bar), izakaya (ee-zah-kah-yah) (casual Japanese-style bar), or kurabu (koo-
rah-boo) (nightclub), but where’s the fun in that?
All bars and clubs in Japan serve o-sake (oh-sah-keh), which means both 
Japanese rice wine and alcoholic beverages in general. If you like beer, try 
some Japanese-brand beers like Asahi (ah-sah-hee), Kirin (kee-reen), or 
Sapporo (sahp-poh-roh). These beers are sold in many countries throughout 
the world, including the United States and Canada. Now, take a walk over to 
the bar and order your favorite o-sake:
	
✓	熱燗 atsukan (ah-tsoo-kahn) (hot sake)
	
✓	ビール bīru (beee-roo) (beer)
	
✓	ブランデー burandē (boo-rahn-dehh) (brandy)
	
✓	チューハイ chūhai (chooo-hah-ee) (shōchū and tonic)
	
✓	ジン jin (jeen) (gin)
	
✓	カクテル kakuteru (kah-koo-teh-roo) (cocktail)
	
✓	水割り mizuwari (mee-zoo-wah-ree) (whiskey and water)
	
✓	オンザロック onzarokku (ohn-zah-rohk-koo) (whiskey on the rocks)
	
✓	ラム酒 ramushu (rah-moo-shoo) (rum)
	
✓	冷酒 reishu (reh-ee-shoo) (chilled sake)
	
✓	焼酎 shōchū (shohh-chooo) (a Japanese liquor similar to vodka)
	
✓	ストレート sutorēto (soo-toh-rehh-toh) (whiskey straight)
	
✓	ウイスキー uisukī (oo-ee-soo-keee) (whiskey)
	
✓	ウオッカ uokka (oo-ohk-kah) (vodka)
	
✓	ワイン wain (wah-een) (wine)
Young people in Japan love to dance the night away in a place referred to 
as kurabu. The popular music in kurabu includes tekuno (teh-koo-noh) 
(techno), hippu-hoppu (heep-poo-hohp-poo) (hip-hop), hausu (hah-oo-soo) 
(house music), and jēpoppu (jehh-pohp-poo) (J-pop [Japanese pop music]). 

187
 Chapter 11: Going Out on the Town
Girls dress attractively, and guys try to look cool. You can find many kurabu 
in larger cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. More and more young 
Japanese do street dance, but ballroom dance is also popular, especially 
among middle-aged people. (You may want to watch the famous 1996 
Japanese film Shall We Dance? starring Koji Yakusho. The 2004 American film 
Shall We Dance starring Richard Gere was a remake of this Japanese film.) 
Now cut a rug and conjugate the u-verb odoru (oh-doh-roo) (to dance)!

Singing at a karaoke box
Karaoke is an abbreviation of kara ōkesutora (kah-rah ohh-keh-soo-toh-rah), 
which means empty orchestra. So you can think of karaoke as an orchestra in 
search of a singer.
Karaoke started in Japan about 30 years ago as a form of after-work entertain­
ment for Japanese businesspeople. Karaoke was viewed as a great way of 
releasing the daily stress related to work. Today, karaoke is popular among 
everyone — men and women, young and old. It’s an artistic, intelligent, acces­
sible, and healthy entertainment.

189
 Chapter 11: Going Out on the Town
Karaoke bars have spread all over the world, but nowadays, karaoke boxes 
are more popular in Japan. A karaoke box is an insulated individual room 
with a sofa, coffee table, and a karaoke set. You just rent it for a few hours 
with your friends. It’s not expensive, and it’s open for all ages, including 
minors. If you want to enjoy karaoke, make sure you know these words and 
phrases:
	
✓	画面 gamen (gah-mehn) (monitor)
	
✓	歌詞 kashi (kah-shee) (lyrics)
	
✓	カラオケ karaoke (kah-rah-oh-keh) (karaoke)
	
✓	曲 kyoku (kyoh-koo) (musical pieces)
	
✓	マイク maiku (mah-ee-koo) (microphone)
	
✓	音痴 onchi (ohn-chee) (tone-deaf)
	
✓	歌 uta (oo-tah) (song)
Last, but certainly not least, make sure you know how to say utau (oo-tah-oo) 
(to sing). Here’s how to conjugate this u-verb.
Dining in izakaya
Drinking is almost obligatory for Japanese busi­
nessmen. Part of their job involves entertaining 
their clients in bars and nightclubs. But not all 
bar traffic is work-related. Both Japanese men 
and women drink with their friends and col­
leagues in 居酒屋 izakaya (ee-zah-kah-yah) 
(casual Japanese-style bars). It’s something 
like the Japanese equivalent of a British pub. 
In izakaya, you don’t hear wordy, honorific 
phrases very much. Waiters and waitresses 
treat you like you’re a member of their families. 
Sitting at the counter is definitely fun. You can 
watch the chefs cook, and you can chat with 
them. Trust me — enjoy several appetizers. You 
can always share dishes with your friends at 
the table. Eat some of these foods at izakaya:
	✓	冷やっこ hiyayakko (hee-yah-yahk-koh) 
(chilled tofu with sauce and spices)
	✓	牡蠣フライ kaki furai (kah-kee foo-rah-
ee) (deep-fried oysters)
	✓	肉じゃが nikujaga (nee-koo-jah-gah) 
(beef and potatoes)
	✓	おでん oden (oh-dehn) (Tokyo-style stew)
	✓	酢のもの sunomono (soo-noh-moh-noh) 
(vinegared food)
	✓	焼き魚 yakizakana (yah-kee-zah-kah-nah) 
(grilled fish)

Talking about Entertainment
If your friends or co-workers find out that you visited the museum’s latest 
exhibit or went to the new bar in town, chances are they’ll ask you what you 
thought. Following are some simple phrases you can use to describe what 
you thought of your entertainment experience. Note that all the sentences 
are in the past tense and in the informal speech style. (For detailed informa­
tion on tenses and the difference between the informal style of speech and 
the polite/neutral style, see Chapter 3.)
	
✓	きれいだった。 Kirei datta. (kee-reh-ee daht-tah.) (It was beautiful.)
	
✓	ひどかった。 Hidokatta. (hee-doh-kaht-tah.) (It was terrible.)
	
✓	感動した。 Kandō shita. (kahn-dohh shee-tah.) (I was moved.)
	
✓	混んでいた。 Konde ita. (kohn-deh ee-tah.) (It was crowded.)
	
✓	美味しかった。 Oishikatta. (oh-ee-shee-kaht-tah.) (It was delicious.)
	
✓	面白かった。 Omoshirokatta. (oh-moh-shee-roh-kaht-tah.) (It was 
interesting.)
	
✓	素晴らしかった。 Subarashikatta. (soo-bah-rah-shee-kaht-tah.) (It was 
wonderful.)
	
✓	高かった。 Takakatta. (tah-kah-kaht-tah.) (It was expensive.)
	
✓	楽しかった。 Tanoshikatta. (tah-noh-shee-kaht-tah.) (It was fun.)
	
✓	安かった。 Yasukatta. (yah-soo-kaht-tah.) (It was cheap.)
	
✓	よかった。 Yokatta. (yoh-kaht-tah.) (It was good.)
To make the previous expressions sound polite, do the following:
	
✓	For i-type adjectives ending in katta (kaht-tah), just add desu (deh-soo). 
So instead of saying Omoshirokatta, say Omoshirokatta desu.
	
✓	For na-type adjectives ending in datta (daht-tah), simply exchange datta 
for deshita (deh-shee-tah). So instead of saying Kirei datta, say Kirei 
deshita.

191
 Chapter 11: Going Out on the Town
	
✓	For the verbs, you need to change the ending ta (tah) to mashita (mah-
shee-tah). For example, instead of saying Kandō shita and Konde ita, 
say Kandō shimashita and Konde imashita, respectively.
	
✓	For u-verbs, refer to the conjugation table in Chapter 3 for precisely how 
to make additional changes.
Getting Your Friends to Go Out with You
Because going out on the town is often more fun when you’re with others, 
why not invite your significant other, classmate, or colleague to join you? 
Start by figuring out how to conjugate the u-verb sasou (sah-soh-oo) (to 
invite).

The following sections help you get even more socially active with your 
Japanese.
Making a suggestion with 
“Why don’t we?”
	
If you want to go somewhere with your friend, make a suggestion by saying 
Why don’t we go there? How about going there? or Would you like to go there? 
The easiest, most natural, and least pushy way of making a suggestion in 
Japanese is to ask a question that ends in -masen ka (mah-sehn kah). -masen 
ka is the polite negative ending -masen plus the question particle ka. Why neg­
ative? In English, you say things like Why don’t we go to the bar tonight? That’s 
negative too, so fair is fair.
Make sure the verb before -masen ka is in the stem form, as in Ikimasen ka 
(ee-kee-mah-sehn kah) (Why don’t we go there?). The iki part is the stem form 
of the verb iku (ee-koo) (to go). If you want to do something, use other verbs 
like suru (soo-roo) (to do), utau (oo-tah-oo) (to sing), and taberu (tah-beh-
roo) (to eat). Check out these examples:

192
Part II: Japanese in Action 
映画館に行きませんか。 Eigakan ni ikimasen ka. (ehh-gah-kahn nee ee-
kee-mah-sehn kah.) (Why don’t we go to a movie theater?)
田中さんと山田さんを誘いませんか。 Tanaka-san to Yamada-san o saso­
imasen ka. (tah-nah-kah-sahn toh yah-mah-dah-sahn oh sah-soh-ee-mah-
sehn kah.) (How about inviting Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Yamada?)
いつかいっしょにテニスをしませんか。 Itsuka isshoni tenisu o shimasen 
ka. (ee-tsoo-kah ees-shoh-nee teh-nee-soo oh shee-mah-sehn kah.) (Why 
don’t we play tennis together someday?)
今度いっしょに歌いませんか。 Kondo isshoni utaimasen ka. (kohn-doh 
ees-shoh-nee oo-tah-ee-mah-sehn kah.) (How about singing together next 
time?)
今度いっしょにロブスターを食べませんか。 Kondo isshoni robusutā 
o tabemasen ka. (kohn-doh ees-shoh-nee roh-boo-soo-tahh oh tah-beh-
mah-sehn kah.) (How about eating lobster together next time?)
Saying “Let’s go” and “Shall we go?”
In English, you can enthusiastically invite your friends to an activity by 
saying Let’s go there. or Let’s do it. How do you say let’s in Japanese? It’s easy: 
Get a verb in the stem form and add the ending -mashō (mah-shohh), as in 
ikimashō (ee-kee-mah-shohh) (let’s go), shimashō (shee-mah-shohh) (let’s do 
it), utaimashō (oo-tah-ee-mah-shohh) (let’s sing), and tabemashō (tah-beh-
mah-shohh) (let’s eat). Check out the following examples:
いっしょに歌いましょう。 Isshoni utaimashō. (ees-shoh-nee oo-tah-ee-
mah-shohh.) (Let’s sing together.)
今晩いっしょに飲みましょう。 Konban isshoni nomimashō. (kohn-bahn 
ees-sho-nee noh-mee-mah-shohh.) (Let’s drink together tonight.)
今度いっしょに映画を見ましょう。 Kondo isshoni eiga o mimashō. 
(kohn-doh ees-shoh-nee ehh-gah oh mee-mah-shohh.) (Let’s see a movie 
together next time.)
If you make a question by using -mashō, it means Shall we? For example
チェスをしましょうか。 Chesu o shimashō ka. (cheh-soo oh shee-mah-
shohh kah.) (Shall we play chess?)
カントリーガーデンに行きましょうか。 Kantorī Gāden ni ikimashō ka. 
(kahn-toh-reee gahh-dehn nee ee-kee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall we go to 
Country Garden?)

193
 Chapter 11: Going Out on the Town
	
-mashō ka also means Shall I?, so it’s useful when you want to say something 
like Shall I bring something? and Shall I help you? Usually, the subject is unspo­
ken, but the context clarifies whether -mashō ka means Shall we? or Shall I? 
However, you can add watashi ga (wah-tah-shee gah) if you want to clarify 
that you’re the only one who is doing the action:
手伝いましょうか。 Tetsudaimashō ka. (teh-tsoo-dah-ee-mah-shohh 
kah.) (Shall I help you?)
私が予約しましょうか。 Watashi ga yoyaku shimashō ka. (wah-tah-shee 
gah yoh-yah-koo shee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall I make a reservation?)

Inviting Friends Over and Asking 
Them to Bring Something
Sometimes you just don’t feel like going out, but you don’t want to be by 
yourself either. On those occasions, consider inviting your friends over to 
your house. Use the irregular verb kuru (koo-roo) (to come) when you call. 
But before you invite anyone, practice conjugating kuru.

Now, you’re ready to invite your friends over:
うちに来ませんか。 Uchi ni kimasen ka. (oo-chee nee kee-mah-sehn 
kah.) (Would you like to come to my house?)
あした私のアパートに来ませんか。 Ashita watashi no apāto ni kimasen 
ka. (ah-shee-tah wah-tah-shee noh ah-pahh-toh nee kee-mah-sehn kah.) 
(Would you like to come to my apartment tomorrow?)
If you’re the one who gets invited, ask your friend what you can bring. 
Japanese hosts and hostesses tend to tell their guests not to bring anything, 
but go ahead and bring something anyway.
	
To say to bring something, use motte (moht-teh), which is the verb motsu 
(moh-tsoo) (to hold) in the te-form, and add the verb iku (ee-koo) (to go) or 
kuru (koo-roo) (to come). Sounds complex, right? I agree with you. The idea is 
that bringing something is equivalent to going/coming somewhere while hold­
ing it. Of course, you can also understand them as a unit, namely, mottekuru 
and motteiku. Check out these examples:
私はビールを持って行きました。 Watashi wa bīru o motte ikimashita. 
(wah-tah-shee wah bee-roo oh moht-teh ee-kee-mah-shee-tah.) (I brought 
beer.)
田中さんはビールを持って来ました。 Tanaka-san wa bīru o motte 
kimashita. (tah-nah-kah-sahn wa bee-roo oh moht-teh kee-mah-shee-tah.) 
(Mr. Tanaka brought beer.)
To talk about bringing a pet or taking a friend to somewhere, use tsurete 
rather than motte. Tsurete is the te-form of the verb tsureru (tsoo-reh-roo) 
(to take); see Chapter 3 for more about the te-form.
私は友達を連れて行きました。 Watashi wa tomodachi o tsurete iki­
mashita. (wah-tah-shee toh-moh-dah-chee oh tsoo-reh-teh ee-kee-mah-
shee-tah.) (I brought my friend.)
田中さんは友達を連れて来ました。 Tanaka-san wa tomodachi o tsurete 
kimashita. (tah-nah-kah-sahn wa toh-moh-dah-chee oh tsoo-reh-teh kee-
mah-shee-tah.) (Mr. Tanaka brought his friend.)
	
To say something, someone, somewhere, and so on, combine a question word and 
the particle ka (kah). The particles ga (gah) and o (oh) are usually dropped after 
these words, but other types of particles can appear after them. For example
あそこに何かありますよ。 Asoko ni nanika arimasu yo. (ah-soh-koh nee 
nah-nee-kah ah-ree-mah-soo yoh.) (There is something over there.)
何か持って行きましょうか。 Nanika motte ikimashō ka. (nah-nee-kah 
moht-teh ee-kee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall I bring something?)

196
Part II: Japanese in Action 
誰か来ましたか。 Dareka kimashita ka. (dah-reh-kah kee-mah-shee-tah 
kah.) (Did someone come?)
どこかに行きませんか。 Dokoka ni ikimasen ka. (doh-koh-kah nee ee-
kee-mah-sehn ka.) (Shall we go somewhere?)
いつかいっしょに飲みましょう。 Itsuka isshoni nomimashō. (ee-tsoo-
kah ees-shoh-nee noh-mee-mah-shohh.) (Let’s drink together someday.)
To say nothing, no one, nowhere, and so on, use a question word and the 
particle mo (moh), but make sure to have the verb in the negative form. The 
particles ga and o must not occur in this context, but other types of particles 
need to occur right before mo. For example
何も食べませんでした。 Nani mo tabemasen deshita. (nah-nee moh tah-
beh-mah-sehn deh-shee-tah.) (I ate nothing.; I didn’t eat anything.)
何も持って来ないでください。 Nani mo motte konaide kudasai. (nah-
nee moh moht-teh koh-nah-ee-deh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please don’t bring 
anything.)
誰も来ません。 Dare mo kimasen. (dah-reh moh kee-mah-sehn.) (No one 
will come.)
昨日はどこにも行きませんでした。 Kinō wa doko ni mo ikimasen 
deshita. (kee-nohh wah doh-koh nee moh ee-kee-mah-sehn deh-shee-tah.) 
(I went nowhere yesterday.; I didn’t go anywhere yesterday.)
See Chapter 3 for a list of question words and particles as well as negative 
forms of verbs.

hether you want to find a job in Japan or you simply have Japanese 
co-workers, knowing some basic office-related terminology is helpful. 
Consider this chapter your go-to resource for all things regarding Japanese-
style business and business communications.
Embarking on the Great Job Hunt
Have you ever had a dream of working in Japan, perhaps as an English 
teacher, an engineer, a businessperson, an illustrator, or a singer? If so, 
the first thing you need to do is send out your rirekisho (ree-reh-kee-shoh) 
(resume) with your complete shokureki (shoh-koo-reh-kee) (work history) in 
the hopes of securing a mensetsu (mehn-seh-tsoo) (interview).
The following sections offer essential vocabulary to help you talk about the 
duties and conditions of a particular shigoto (shee-goh-toh) (job) during a 
mensetsu.
Clarifying your duties
When you’re searching for a new job, spelling out the duties, responsibilities, 
and obligations associated with the position is always a good idea. You can 

200
Part II: Japanese in Action 
start figuring out your job duties in Japanese by conjugating the u-verb hata­
raku (hah-tah-rah-koo) (to work):
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
働く
hataraku
hah-tah-rah-koo
働かない
hatarakanai
hah-tah-rah-kah-nah-ee
働き（ます）
hataraki(masu)
hah-tah-rah-kee(-mah-soo)
働いて
hataraite
hah-tah-rah-ee-teh
Following are a couple of questions you can ask to learn more about the 
responsibilities of the job you’re applying for:
	
✓	私の役割は何ですか。 Watashi no yakuwari wa nan desu ka. (wah-
tah-shee noh yah-koo-wah-ree wah nahn deh-soo kah.) (What is my 
responsibility?)
	
✓	土曜日も働かなくてはいけませんか。 Doyōbi mo hatarakanakute wa 
ikemasen ka. (doh-yohh-bee mo hah-tah-rah-kah-nah-koo-teh wah 
ee-keh-mah-sehn kah.) (Do I have to work on Saturdays too?)
	
When you discuss an obligation and you need to use the phrase I have to or I 
must, drop the final i (ee) from the negative form of the verb (see Chapter 3) 
and add -kute wa ikemasen (koo-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn). For example, the 
negative form of taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat) is tabenai (tah-beh-nah-ee). By 
dropping the i from tabenai and adding -kute wa ikemasen, you get tabena­
kute wa ikemasen (tah-beh-nah-koo-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn), which means I 
have to eat. It’s long, I admit, but it’s the easiest way to express have to or must 
in Japanese. In an informal context, you can use -kute wa ikenai (koo-teh wah 
ee-keh-nah-ee) rather than -kute wa ikemasen. Take a look at these examples:
８時間働かなくてはいけません。 8-jikan hatarakanakute wa ikemasen. 
(hah-chee-jee-kahn hah-tah-rah-kah-nah-koo-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn.) (I 
have to work for eight hours.)
健康保険がなくてはいけません。 Kenkō hoken ga nakute wa ikemasen. 
(kehn-kohh hoh-kehn gah nah-koo-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn.) (I have to 
have health insurance.)
今日は残業をしなくてはいけないんです。 Kyōwa zangyō o shinakute wa 
ikenai-n-desu. (kyohh-wah zahn-gyohh oh shee-nah-koo-teh wah ee-keh-
nah-een-deh-soo.) (I have to work overtime today.)
もう帰らなくてはいけませんか。 Mō kaeranakute wa ikemasen ka. 
(mohh kah-eh-rah-nah-koo-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn kah.) (Do you have 
to go home already?)

201
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Business and Telecommunications
	
You can express a ton of activities you need to do at your workplace by using 
the verb suru (soo-roo) (to do). (Head to Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of 
uses for suru.) Here are a few suru phrases that may come up in your workplace:
	
✓	チェックする chekku suru (chehk-koo soo-roo) (to check)
	
✓	ファックスする fakkusu suru (fahk-koo-soo soo-roo) (to fax)
	
✓	配達する haitatsu suru (hah-ee-tah-tsoo soo-roo) (to deliver)
	
✓	確認する kakunin suru (kah-koo-neen soo-roo) (to confirm)
	
✓	計算する keisan suru (kehh-sahn soo-roo) (to calculate)
	
✓	コピーする kopī suru (koh-peee soo-roo) (to make copies)
	
✓	メールする mēru suru (mehh-roo soo-roo) (to e-mail)
	
✓	掃除する sōji suru (sohh-jee soo-roo) (to clean)
	
✓	添付する tenpu suru (tehn-poo soo-roo) (to attach)
	
✓	郵送する yūsō suru (yooo-sohh soo-roo) (to mail)
Discussing a job’s benefits
An interview is your opportunity to find out all about the benefits offered at a 
shokuba (shoh-koo-bah) (workplace). Make sure you know these words and 
phrases before your interview so you can intelligently participate in a discus­
sion of benefits:
	
✓	健康保険 kenkō hoken (kehn-kohh hoh-kehn) (health insurance)
	
✓	交通費 kōtsūhi (kohh-tsoo-hee) (commuting allowance)
Attending parties as part of your job
To help employees bond with each other, 
employers organize some seasonal or occa­
sional parties. Employees aren’t formally 
required to attend them, but they are sort of 
obliged to attend them. The following types of 
parties are very common:
	✓	忘年会 bōnenkai (bohh-nehn-kah-ee) 
(year-end party, literally translated as a 
“forget-the-year party”)
	✓	新年会 shinnenkai (sheen-nehn-kah-ee) 
(New Year’s party)
	✓	歓迎会 kangeikai (kahn-gehh-kah-ee) 
(welcome party for new colleagues)
	✓	送別会 sōbetsukai (sohh-beh-tsoo-kah-ee) 
(farewell party for colleagues that are retir­
ing, resigning, or moving to another section)

202
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
✓	給料 kyūryō (kyooo-ryohh) (salary)
	
✓	有給休暇 yūkyūkyūka (yooo-kyooo-kyooo-kah) (paid vacation)
	
✓	残業手当 zangyō teate (zahn-gyohh teh-ah-teh) (overtime pay)
Negotiate with the employer so you comfortably work in a new workplace. If 
anything is difficult for you, explain the reasons so they can understand your 
situations.
	
To state a reason, say it in a sentence and add kara (kah-rah) (because) after­
ward. You can also add desu after kara to mean It’s because such and such. 
Here are a few examples:
大学で経済学を専攻したからです。 Daigaku de keizaigaku o senkō shita 
kara desu. (dah-ee-gah-koo deh kehh-zah-ee-gah-koo oh sehn-kohh shee-
tah kah-rah deh-soo.) (It’s because I majored in economics in college.)
英語を使う仕事に興味があるからです。 Eigo o tsukau shigoto ni kyōmi 
ga aru kara desu. (ehh-goh oh tsoo-kah-oo shee-goh-toh nee kyohh-mee 
gah ah-roo kah-rah deh-soo.) (It’s because I’m interested in jobs that I can 
use English for.)

Making Sense of Your Office Environment
If you’re a full-time employee, you probably spend about one-third of your 
time each week at the office. If you’re going to spend so much time at work, 
you’d better know the terms for basic office equipment, furniture, and sup­
plies, as well as how to get around your office building.
Checking out the supplies
Many workplaces are home to numerous pieces of office equipment and fur­
niture. Check whether you see these items at your workplace:
	
✓	電話 denwa (dehn-wah) (telephone)
	
✓	デスクライトdesuku raito (deh-soo-koo rah-ee-toh) or デスクランプ 
desuku ranpu (deh-soo-koo rahm-poo) (desk lamp)
	
✓	ゴミ箱 gomibako (goh-mee-bah-koh) (wastebasket)
	
✓	本棚 hondana (hohn-dah-nah) (bookshelf)
	
✓	椅子 isu (ee-soo) (chair)
	
✓	カレンダー karendā (kah-rehn-dahh) (calendar)
	
✓	コピー機 kopīki (koh-peee-kee) (copier)
	
✓	ノートＰＣ nōto PC (nohh-toh peee-sheee) (laptop computer)
Addressing superiors and subordinates
Japan is very modern, but a shadow of feu­
dalism still falls on workplaces. Case in point: 
Subordinates never address their superiors by 
their first names. If you work in Japan, address 
your superiors by using their titles and last 
names. So, if your superior is the company 
president and his last name is Smith, call him 
スミス社長 Sumisu-shachō, or simply 社長 
shāchō (shah-chohh).
Some titles Japanese companies use are as 
follows:
	✓	部長 buchō (boo-chohh) (department chief)
	✓	副社長 fukushachō (foo-koo-shah-chohh) 
(company vice-president)
	✓	課長 kachō (kah-chohh) (section chief)
	✓	係長 kakarichō (kah-kah-ree-chohh) (sub­
section chief)
	✓	社長 shachō (shah-chohh) (company 
president)
Address your subordinates by their last names, 
plus -san or -kun. In a business context, both 
-san (sahn) and -kun (koon) can be used for 
women and men. So if Mr. Smith is your assis­
tant, call him Sumisu-san (soo-mee-soo-sahn) 
or Sumisu-kun (soo-mee-soo-koon).

✓	パソコン pasokon (pah-soh-kohn) (personal computer)
	
✓	プリンター purintā (poo-reen-tahh) (printer)
	
✓	タブレット taburetto (tah-boo-reht-toh) (tablet computer)
	
✓	机 tsukue (tsoo-koo-eh) (desk)
Look inside your desk drawers to see whether you have these office supplies:
	
✓	ボールペン bōrupen (bohh-roo-pehn) (ballpoint pen)
	
✓	鉛筆 enpitsu (ehn-pee-tsoo) (pencil)
	
✓	封筒 fūtō (fooo-tohh) (envelope)
	
✓	ホッチキス hotchikisu (hoht-chee-kee-soo) (stapler)
	
✓	消しゴム keshigomu (keh-shee-goh-moo) (eraser)
	
✓	糊 nori (noh-ree) (glue)
	
✓	ノート nōto (nohh-toh) (notebook)
	
✓	シャーペン shāpen (shahh-pehn) (mechanical pencil)
	
✓	手帳 techō (teh-chohh) (planner)
	
✓	セロテープ serotēpu (seh-roh-tehh-poo) (cellophane tape)
	
If you can’t find a pen, an eraser, or a stapler, ask a colleague. He or she proba­
bly has one that you can use. Start by mentioning the item you need to borrow 
and including the topic particle wa (wah). Then use the verb aru (ah-roo) (to 
exist) to ask Do you have? (Using the verb to exist seems weird in this case, 
doesn’t it? To see more examples of this strange use of the verb aru, flip to 
Chapter 7.) Add the polite suffix -masu (mah-soo) to the stem form of aru, as 
in arimasu (ah-ree-mah-soo), and make the phrase into a question by adding 
the question particle ka (kah), as in arimasu ka (ah-ree-mah-soo kah). Now 
you can start bothering your colleagues:
ホッチキスはありますか。 Hotchikisu wa arimasu ka. (hoht-chee-kee-
soo wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you have a stapler?)
消しゴムはありますか。 Keshigomu wa arimasu ka. (keh-shee-goh-moo 
wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you have an eraser?)
Touring the rest of the building
Although you may be in the same room in the building every day, knowing 
the rest of the areas in the building is a good idea in case you need to help 
other people in the company. Here are helpful words to identify a variety of 
rooms and areas in your office building:

206

✓	出口 deguchi (deh-goo-chee) (exit)
	
✓	エレベーター erebētā (eh-reh-behh-tahh) (elevator)
	
✓	入り口 iriguchi (ee-ree-goo-chee) (entrance)
	
✓	階段 kaidan (kah-ee-dahn) (stairway)
	
✓	会議室 kaigishitsu (kah-ee-gee-shee-tsoo) (conference room)
	
✓	警備室 keibishitsu (keh-ee-bee-shee-tsoo) (security room)
	
✓	工場 kōjō (kohh-johh) (factory)
	
✓	ロビー robī (roh-beee) (lobby)
	
✓	廊下 rōka (rohh-kah) (hallway)
	
✓	倉庫 sōko (sohh-koh) (storage)
	
✓	トイレ toire (toh-ee-reh) (toilet)
	
For pointers on referring to specific floors in your building, check out Chapter 
10. You can read about using ordinal numbers in general in Chapter 5.
Phoning Made Simple
Telephones are an indispensable part of daily life, particularly in business 
settings. E-mails are also great, but they can’t replace the sense of connection 
that you get from hearing another person’s voice. The next sections give you 
the essential words and phrases that you need to have for telephone conver­
sations in Japanese.
Brushing up on phone-related vocab
Before you get ready to make a call in Japanese, get used to the Japanese 
words and terms related to telephone equipment, systems, and accessories:
	
✓	電話 denwa (dehn-wah) (telephone)
	
✓	電話番号 denwa-bangō (dehn-wah-bahn-gohh) (telephone number)
	
✓	電話帳 denwachō (dehn-wah-chohh) (telephone book)
	
✓	携帯（電話） keitai(-denwa) (kehh-tah-ee[-dehn-wah]) (cellphone)
	
✓	留守番電話 rusuban-denwa (roo-soo-bahn-dehn-wah) (answering machine)
	
✓	ヴォイスメール voisu-mēru (voh-ee-soo-mehh-roo) (voicemail)
After you have a grip on the necessary vocabulary, you’re ready to denwa o 
kakeru (dehn-wah oh kah-keh-roo) (to make a phone call). Here’s how to con­
jugate the ru-verb kakeru (kah-keh-roo) (to make [a phone call]):

Before you start talking, say moshimoshi (moh-shee-moh-shee). In Japanese, 
moshimoshi is a kind of line-testing phrase, like Hello, are you there? or 
Can you hear me? If the other party on the phone doesn’t speak at all, say 
moshimoshi again. If you still don’t hear anything, repeat it more loudly — 
MOSHIMOSHI!!! If you still don’t hear anything, hang up!
Asking to speak with someone
Why do you make a phone call? Because you want to talk to someone, right? 
Oh, you want to talk with Mr. Mori? Here are a couple of different ways to try 
to get him.
	
✓	森さんをお願いします。 Mori-san o onegaishimasu. (moh-ree-sahn oh 
oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Mr. Mori, please.)
	
✓	森さんはいらっしゃいますか。 Mori-san wa irasshaimasu ka. (moh-ree-
sahn wah ee-rahs-shah-ee-mah-soo kah.) (Is Mr. Mori available?)
	
Suppose you want to phrase your request as I’d like to speak to Mr. Mori. I 
have two confessions to make regarding how to express to want in Japanese. 
First, Japanese usually use an adjective, not a verb, to express to want. 
Second, Japanese use different adjectives to express to want depending on 
whether they want something (such as time, a friend, or a physical object) or 
want to do something.
To say that you want something, use the adjective hoshii (hoh-sheee) or its 
polite/neutral counterpart hoshii desu (hoh-sheee deh-soo). Place it at the 
end of the sentence and place the subject particle ga (gah) after the item that 
you want, as in the following examples:
私は車がほしいです。 Watashi wa kuruma ga hoshii desu. (wah-tah-shee 
wah koo-roo-mah gah hoh-sheee deh-soo.) (I want a car.)
私はお金がほしいです。 Watashi wa o-kane ga hoshii desu. (wah-tah-
shee wah oh-kah-neh gah hoh-sheee deh-soo.) (I want money.)
何が一番ほしいですか。 Nani ga ichiban hoshii desu ka. (nah-nee gah 
ee-chee-bahn hoh-sheee deh-soo kah.) (What do you want the most?)

208
Part II: Japanese in Action 
時間が一番ほしいです。 Jikan ga ichiban hoshii desu. (jee-kahn gah ee-
chee-bahn hoh-sheee deh-soo.) (I want time the most.)
いい仕事がほしいです。 Ii shigoto ga hoshii desu. (eee shee-goh-toh gah 
hoh-sheee deh-soo.) (I want a good job.)
To say that you want to do something, simply add the suffix -tai (tah-ee) to 
the end of the stem form of a verb. For example, if you want to neru (neh-
roo) (to sleep), say ne-tai (neh-tah-ee) (to want to sleep). Check out these 
examples:
私は休みたいです。 Watashi wa yasumi-tai desu. (wah-tah-shee wah yah-
soo-mee-tah-ee deh-soo.) (I want to take a day off.)
今日はクラスに行きたくありません。 Kyō wa kurasu ni ikitaku ari­
masen. (kyohh wah koo-rah-soo nee ee-kee-tah-koo ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (I 
don’t want to go to class today.)
将来, 何をしたいですか。Shōrai, nani o shi-tai desu ka. (shohh-rah-ee, 
nah-nee oh shee-tah-ee deh-soo kah.) (What do you want to do in the 
future?)
うちに帰りたいです。 Uchi ni kaeri-tai desu. (oo-chee nee kah-eh-ree-
tah-ee deh-soo.) (I want to go home.)
You can mark the object of the verb with either o or ga when the verb is com­
bined with -tai. For example, Kyō wa sutēki o tabe-tai desu. (kyohh wah soo-
tehh-kee oh tah-beh-tah-ee deh-soo.) (I want to eat a steak today.) can be Kyō wa 
sutēki ga tabe-tai desu. (kyohh wah soo-tehh-kee gah tah-beh-tah-ee deh-soo.).
	
When you tell someone what you want, you should end your statement with 
-n-desu ga (n-deh-soo gah). Doing so injects a nice, friendly, and cooperative atti­
tude into your statement. The function of -n-desu is to show your willingness to 
hear the other person’s response to what you’re saying. (See Chapter 5 for more 
on using -n-desu.) The last ga is actually the sentence-ending particle that means 
but. So, you’re literally saying I want to do such and such, but. What you actually 
mean is something like I want to do such and such, but is it okay with you?
Suppose you call a hotel to make a reservation. If you say yoyaku o shitai 
desu (yoh-yah-koo oh shee-tah-ee deh-soo), it just means I want to make a res­
ervation. But phrasing your statement this way sounds too blunt in Japanese, 
and you almost sound like you’re making a protest or stating a demand. By 
contrast, if you say yoyaku o shitai-n-desu ga (yoh-yah-koo oh shee-tah-een-
deh-soo gah), it means something like I’d like to make a reservation, but could 
you help me with it? Now, your statement sounds soft, and you’re kindly invit­
ing the hotel clerk’s reply.
That’s the kind of tone you want to use when asking to talk to your business 
contact Mr. Mori (remember him?), so you express that request by saying 
Mori-san o onegai shi-tai-n-desu ga. (moh-ree-sahn oh oh-neh-gah-ee shee-
tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (I’d like to talk with Mr. Mori, but is he available?)

209
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Business and Telecommunications
Check out these examples that contain a more realistic translation of three 
statements that use -n-desu ga:
予約を確認したいんですが。 Yoyaku o kakunin shi-tai-n-desu ga. (yoh-
yah-koo oh kah-koo-neen shee-tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (I’d like to confirm 
the reservation, but is it okay with you?)
営業時間を知りたいんですが。 Eigyō jikan o shiri-tai-n-desu ga. (ehh-
gyohh jee-kahn oh shee-ree-tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (I’d like to know your 
business hours, but could you help me with this?)
ちょっとお尋ねしたいんですが。 Chotto otazune shi-tai-n-desu ga. 
(choht-toh oh-tah-zoo-neh shee-tah-een deh-soo gah.) (I’d like to ask you 
about something, but is it okay?)
Calling your client
When you call your business clients, remember that you’re representing your 
company. That’s the Japanese way to make a business call. Don’t forget to men­
tion the name of your company first, before mentioning your own name. Instead 
of saying This is Mr. White, for example, say This is ABC Technology’s Mr. White.
Greet your client and his or her secretary with O-sewa ni natte orimasu. (oh-
seh-wah nee naht-teh oh-ree-mah-soo.) (Thank you for doing business with 
us.). This line is one of the essential set phrases in Japanese business.
	
When you ask for your call to be transferred to a specific person, don’t forget 
to specify his title and department. This little tip is important, especially when 
more than one person in the company has the same last name.

Leaving a message
Many people’s workdays are filled with meetings, deadlines, and can’t-miss 
appointments that keep them from answering their phones — which means 
you’re probably going to have to leave a message for someone at some point 
in your career. You may leave a message on a voicemail or with a person 
(such as a secretary or assistant).
To talk about leaving messages, conjugate the u-verb nokosu (noh-koh-soo), 
which means to leave in the sense of leaving a message but not to leave in the 
sense of going away or departing.

On someone’s voicemail
When you leave a message on an answering machine, you need to give the 
other party all the information necessary to understand your call. Specifically, 
make sure you clarify which person will call the other back. Here are a few 
phrases to help you do just that:
	
✓	後ほどお電話を下さい。 Nochihodo o-denwa o kudasai. (noh-chee-hoh-
doh oh-dehn-wah oh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please give me a call later.)
	
✓	またお電話を致します。 Mata o-denwa o itashimasu. (mah-tah oh-dehn-
wah oh ee-tah-shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll call you again.)
With a person
When you leave a message with a person, be clear about what you want and 
always use polite phrases such as the following:
	
✓	電話があったことをお伝えください。 Denwa ga atta koto o o-tsutae 
kudasai. (dehn-wah gah aht-tah koh-toh oh oh-tsoo-tah-eh koo-dah-sah-
ee.) (Please tell him/her that I called.)
	
✓	またこちらからお電話を致します。 Mata kochira kara o-denwa o itashi­
masu. (mah-tah koh-chee-rah kah-rah oh-dehn-wah oh ee-tah-shee-mah-
soo.) (I’ll call him/her again.)
	
✓	お電話を頂きたいんですが。 O-denwa o itadakitai-n-desu ga. (oh-dehn-
wah oh ee-tah-dah-kee-tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (Would you kindly ask him/
her to please call me back?)
	
✓	またお電話致しますとお伝え下さい。 Mata o-denwa itashimasu to o-tsu­
tae kudasai. (mah-tah o-dehn-wah ee-tah-shee-mah-soo toh oh-tsoo-tah-eh 
koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please let him/her know that I’ll call again tomorrow.)
	
✓	少し遅れると伝えてください。 Sukoshi okureru to tsutaete kudasai. 
(soo-koh-shee oh-koo-reh-roo toh tsoo-tah-eh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) 
(Please tell him/her that I’ll be a little late.)
	
The particle to, as in to tsutaete kudasai in the last example sentence in the 
preceding list, is a quotation particle. Place it right after your message to indi­
cate what your message is. Use it with the verbs iu (ee-oo) (to say), kaku 
(kah-koo) (to write), and tsutaeru (tsoo-tah-eh-roo) (to report/tell), as in the 
following examples:
一万円借りたと書きました。 10,000-en karita to kakimashita. (ee-chee-
mahn-ehn kah-ree-tah toh kah-kee-mah-shee-tah.) (I wrote that I borrowed 
10,000 yen.)
田中さんは来ると言いました。 Tanaka-san wa kuru to iimashita. (tah-
nah-kah-sahn wah koo-roo toh eee-mah-shee-tah.) (Mr. Tanaka said that 
he’ll come.)

213
 Chapter 12: Taking Care of Business and Telecommunications
また来ますと伝えてください。 Mata kimasu to tsutaete kudasai. (mah-
tah kee-mah-soo toh tsoo-tah-eh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Could you tell him/
her that I’ll come again?)
You can also use the quotation particle to with the verb omou (oh-moh-oo) 
(to think) to mark the content of what a person thinks.
翻訳は来週までにできると思います。 Hon’yaku wa raishū made ni 
dekiru to omoimasu. (hohn-yah-koo wah rah-ee-shooo mah-deh nee deh-
kee-roo toh oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think that the translation can be com­
pleted by next week.)
田中さんは来ないと思います。 Tanaka-san wa konai to omoimasu. 
(tah-nah-kah-sahn wah koh-nah-ee toh oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think Mr. 
Tanaka will not come.)
	
Go- (goh) is another polite prefix, just like o- (oh), which I tell you about in 
Chapter 4. You can add go- to the beginning of a noun to refer respectfully to 
other people’s items. Typically, you use go- with words of Chinese origin and 
o- with native Japanese words; however, too many exceptions exist, so you 
just have to memorize which prefix goes with which nouns. Check out some 
business-related examples:
	
✓	御注文 go-chūmon (goh-chooo-mohn) (order)
	
✓	御伝言 go-dengon (goh-dehn-gohn) (message)
	
✓	御住所 go-jūsho (goh-jooo-shoh) (address)
	
✓	御職業 go-shokugyō (goh-shoh-koo-gyohh) (occupation)
	
✓	御招待 go-shōtai (goh-shohh-tah-ee) (invitation)
	
✓	お電話 o-denwa (oh-dehn-wah) (telephone)
	
✓	お電話番号 o-denwa-bangō (oh-dehn-wah-bahn-gohh) (telephone number)
	
✓	お客様 o-kyaku-sama (oha-kyah-koo-sah-mah) (customer)
	
✓	お名前 o-namae (oh-nah-mah-eh) (name)
	
As I note in Chapter 10, the particle ga means but when placed after a sen­
tence. It usually shows contrast, conflict, or contradiction just like but does 
in English, but ga can also mean almost nothing, simply marking a transition 
from one statement to another. The typical situation where you use ga as a 
transition marker is when one person telephones another person. In Japan, 
you need to say your own name first before asking for someone on the phone, 
so the particle ga is essential for smoothly beginning a telephone conversa­
tion. For example, if Mr. Smith wants to talk with Mr. Tanaka, he would first 
say his name and ask for Mr. Tanaka, as in Sumisu desu ga, Tanaka-san wa 
irasshaimasu ka. (soo-mee-soo deh-soo gah, tah-nah-kah sahn wah ee-rahs-
shah-ee-mah-soo kah.) (I’m Mr. Smith. Is Mr. Tanaka there?)

Catching Up on Computing Basics
Computers are an indispensable communication tool in the business world,

Recreation and the Great Outdoors
In This Chapter
▶	Expressing to do with suru and showing off what you can do
▶	Finding a hobby
▶	Getting back to nature in all seasons
▶	Playing sports and games
▶	Being artistic
N

o matter how much you love your job, your life can’t be entirely healthy 
if it consists only of work, so make a goal to set some time aside for riku­
rieishon (ree-koo-ree-ehh-shohn) (recreation). This chapter explains how to talk 
about rikurieishon in Japanese, from engaging in hobbies and enjoying nature to 
playing sports and games and exploring your musical and artistic talents.
Using the Verb Suru (To Do)
The verb suru (soo-roo) (to do) is the most frequently used verb in Japanese. 
You can use suru for talking about doing many different types of recreational 
activities discussed in this chapter. To start with, conjugate the irregular 
verb suru as follows:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
する
suru
soo-roo
しない
shinai
shee-nah-ee
し（ます）
shi(masu)
shee(-mah-soo)
して
shite
shee-teh
You can use suru to express many recreational activities, from sports to 
sightseeing:
	
✓	電話をする denwa o suru (dehn-wah oh soo-roo) (to telephone someone)
	
✓	買い物をする kaimono o suru (kah-ee-moh-noh oh soo-roo) (to do the 
shopping)

220
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
✓	観光をする kankō o suru (kahn-kohh oh soo-roo) (to go sightseeing)
	
✓	空手をする karate o suru (kah-rah-teh oh soo-roo) (to do karate)
	
✓	料理をする ryōri o suru (ryohh-ree oh soo-roo) (to cook)
	
✓	テニスをする tenisu o suru (teh-nee-soo oh soo-roo) (to play tennis)
	
✓	トランプをする toranpu o suru (toh-rahn-poo oh soo-roo) (to play cards)
	
✓	釣りをする tsuri o suru (tsoo-ree oh soo-roo) (to fish)
	
✓	山登りをする yamanobori o suru (yah-mah-noh-boh-ree o soo-roo) (to 
mountain climb)
The verb suru also follows some English loan words. These words are pretty 
easy to understand even without the translation.
	
✓	チェックする chekku suru (chehk-koo soo-roo) (to check)
	
✓	キャンセルする kyanseru suru (kyahn-seh-roo soo-roo) (to cancel)
	
✓	リラックスする rirakkusu suru (ree-rahk-koo-soo soo-roo) (to relax)
Saying “I Can”
	
Sorry, Japanese doesn’t have a convenient word like can. To say that you can 
do something rather than that you do something, add a suffix (-eru or -rareru) 
to the verb. You need to do a little surgery on the verb to securely attach the 
suffix. (Don’t worry; verbs don’t bleed.) The particular suffix and the amount 
of verb surgery necessary both depend on the class of the verb.
	
✓	If the verb is an u-verb, remove the u at the end of the verb in the dic­
tionary form and add -eru. For example, aruku (ah-roo-koo) (to walk) is 
an u-verb. Removing the final u and adding -eru gives you arukeru (ah-
roo-keh-roo). Aruku means I walk, but arukeru means I can walk.
	
✓	If the verb is a ru-verb, remove the ru at the end of the verb in the dic­
tionary form and add -rareru. For example, the verb okiru (oh-kee-roo) 
(to sit up) is a ru-verb. Removing the ru and adding -rareru gives you 
okirareru (oh-kee-rah-reh-roo). Okirareru means I can sit up.
The only necessary sound adjustment in this whole process is to change 
ts to t before adding -eru. So the can form of the verb motsu (moh-tsoo) (to 
hold) is moteru (moh-teh-roo) (can hold), not motseru (moh-tseh-roo). That 
doesn’t mean that motsu is an irregular verb; it’s actually regular. Tse (tseh) 
just isn’t an authentic Japanese sound, so it gets simplified to te (teh). That’s 
a reasonable and minor sound adjustment, right?
Two of the major irregular verbs, suru (see the preceding section) and kuru 
(koo-roo) (to come), undergo major changes in the can situation. The can 

221
 Chapter 13: Recreation and the Great Outdoors
form of the verb suru is actually a substitution with the verb dekiru (deh-kee-
roo) (can do). The can form of kuru is korareru (koh-rah-reh-roo) (can come).
	
When you use the can form of a verb in a sentence, replace the direct object 
particle o (oh) with the particle ga (gah). (See Chapter 3 for more on the par­
ticles o and ga.) I know — it’s not a subject, but you mark it with the particle 
ga anyway. Strange, isn’t it? So Sushi o tsukuru. (soo-shee oh tsoo-koo-roo.) 
means You make sushi., but Sushi ga tsukureru. (soo-shee gah tsoo-koo-reh-
roo.) means You can make sushi. After you create a can-form, such as tsu­
kureru, treat it as an independent verb and conjugate it as a ru-verb. Right, 
tsukureru, tsukurenai, tsukure(masu), and tsukutte! (For a refresher on how 
to conjugate ru-verbs, check out Chapter 3.) These examples help you express 
who can and can’t do what:
アダムは空手ができます。 Adamu wa karate ga dekimasu. (ah-dah-moo 
wah kah-rah-teh gah deh-kee-mah-soo.) (Adam can do karate.)
私は箸が使えません。 Watashi wa hashi ga tsukaemasen. (wah-tah-shee 
wah hah-shee gah tsoo-kah-eh-mah-sehn.) (I can’t use chopsticks.)
父は日本語が話せません。 でも, 中国語が話せます。 Chichi wa Nihongo 
ga hanasemasen. Demo, Chūgokugo ga hanasemasu. (chee-chee wah 
nee-hohn-goh gah han-nah-seh-mah-sehn. deh-moh, chooo-goh-koo-goh 
gah hah-nah-seh-mah-soo.) (My father can’t speak Japanese. However, he 
can speak Chinese.)
	
What? You can only speak English? To say only in Japanese, you add the 
particle shika (shee-kah) to the end of the noun and make the verb negative. 
(Don’t forget to make the verb negative because shika and the negative verb 
together are what mean only.) Also, if shika follows the subject particle ga or 
the object particle o, you drop the particle; other particles stay, as the follow­
ing examples show:
私は英語しか話せません。 Watashi wa eigo shika hanasemasen. (wah-
tah-shee wah ehh-goh shee-kah hah-nah-seh-mah-sehn.) (I can only speak 
English.)
田中さんしか来られませんでした。 Tanaka-san shika koraremasend­
eshita. (tah-nah-kah-sahn shee-kah koh-rah-reh-mah-sehn-deh-shee-tah.) 
(Only Mr. Tanaka could come.)
明子さんは野菜しか食べられません。 Akiko-san wa yasai shika taberare­
masen. (ah-kee-koh-sahn wah yah-sah-ee shee-kah tah-beh-rah-reh-mah-
sehn.) (Akiko can only eat vegetables.)
ふぐはレストランでしか食べません。 Fugu wa resutoran de shika tabe­
masen. (foo-goo wah reh-soo-toh-rahn deh shee-kah tah-beh-mah-sehn.) 
(I eat blowfish at a restaurant only.)
テニスは父としかしません。 Tenisu wa chichi to shika shimasen. (teh-
nee-soo wah chee-chee toh shee-kah shee-mah-sehn.) (I play tennis with 
my father only.)

Discussing Your Hobbies
If you get to know a Japanese person socially, he or she may ask you, Shumi 
wa. (shoo-mee wah.) (What’s your hobby?). Having at least one shumi (shoo-
mee) (hobby) that you can proudly talk about is nice. Is your shumi athletic, 
artistic, or academic in nature? Or is it just amusing? Perhaps you do one of 
the following activities — all of which are nouns, by the way:
	
✓	盆栽 bonsai (bohn-sah-ee) (bonsai [creating miniature trees])
	
✓	読書 dokusho (doh-koo-shoh) (reading)
	
✓	絵 e (eh) (drawing and painting)
	
✓	ゴルフ gorufu (goh-roo-foo) (golf)
	
✓	切手のコレクション kitte no korekushon (keet-teh noh koh-reh-koo-
shohn) (stamp collecting)
	
✓	料理 ryōri (ryohh-ree) (cooking)
	
✓	水泳 suiei (soo-ee-ehh) (swimming)
	
✓	釣り tsuri (tsoo-ree) (fishing)
	
If you want to use a verb to specify your hobby (that is, you want to use the verb 
for to swim rather than the noun swimming), just say the verb and add koto (koh-
toh) at the end. Koto means something like fact or matter, but it doesn’t have any 
specific meaning by itself. It just makes a preceding verb noun-like. So to say My 
hobby is swimming., you can use either of the following phrases:
趣味は水泳です。 Shumi wa suiei desu. (shoo-mee wah soo-ee-ehh deh-
soo.)
趣味は泳ぐことです。 Shumi wa oyogu koto desu. (shoo-mee wah oh-
yoh-goo koh-toh deh-soo.)
My friend’s hobby is reading. He reads books, magazines, dictionaries, and 
anything else that he can get his hands on, including the nutritional informa­
tion on cereal boxes, the lists of chemicals in his wife’s cosmetic goods, and 
even entire software manuals. Use the following table to conjugate the u-verb 
yomu (yoh-moo) (to read) for him.

Part II: Japanese in Action 
Exploring Nature
If you’re tired of working in front of your computer, give your eyes a change 
of pace and take a trip to the mountains or the beach. You discover the 
words and phrases that let you explore shizen (shee-zehn) (nature) in the fol­
lowing sections.
Taking in the landscape
When you head outside for a little R and R, you may want to enjoy a few of 
the following places:
	
✓	ビーチ bīchi (beee-chee) (beach)
	
✓	海岸 kaigan (kah-ee-gahn) (shoreline)
	
✓	川 kawa (kah-wah) (river)
	
✓	火山 kazan (kah-zahn) (volcano)
	
✓	湖 mizuumi (mee-zoo-oo-mee) (lake)
	
✓	山脈 sanmyaku (sahn-myah-koo) (mountain range)
	
✓	滝 taki (tah-kee) (waterfall)
	
✓	海 umi (oo-mee) (sea/ocean)
	
✓	山 yama (yah-mah) (mountain)
Beyond admiring the scenery, you may want to do one of the following activities:
	
✓	ハイキング haikingu (hah-ee-keen-goo) (hiking)
	
✓	キャンプ kyanpu (kyahn-poo) (camping)
	
✓	サイクリング saikuringu (sah-ee-koo-reen-goo) (cycling)
Changing with the seasons
When you want to explore nature, the season is the most important factor 
to take into account. Does your part of the world have shiki (shee-kee) (four 
seasons)? The four seasons are
	
✓	春 haru (hah-roo) (spring)
	
✓	夏 natsu (nah-tsoo) (summer)
	
✓	秋 aki (ah-kee) (fall)
	
✓	冬 fuyu (foo-yoo) (winter)

225
 Chapter 13: Recreation and the Great Outdoors
Enjoying the four seasons in Japan
Like most of North America, Japan has four 
seasons. To take advantage of the best Japan 
has to offer, follow this seasonal mini-tour of 
things to do on the Japanese islands.
	✓	In spring, don’t miss 花見 hanami (hah-
nah-mee) (flower viewing).
	✓	In summer, go to the countryside and expe­
rience 盆祭り Bon matsuri (bohn mah-
tsoo-ree) (Bon festivals) and 盆踊り Bon 
odori (bohn oh-doh-ree) (Bon dancing), 
where you can dance with the crowd. (Bon 
is the Buddhist festival of the dead.)
	✓	In fall, drive around in the mountains and 
enjoy 紅葉 kōyō (kohh-yohh) (the changing 
of leaves’ colors).
	✓	In winter, go to 雪祭りyukimatsuri (yoo-
kee-mah-tsoo-ree) (the snow festival) in 
北海道 Hokkaidō (hohk-kah-ee-dohh) 
(Hokkaido) and see the huge, magnificent 
snow sculptures.
	
If you want to make a suggestion (for example, swimming, singing, diving, and 
traveling), take the stem form of a verb and add one of these verb suffixes:
	
✓	-masen ka (mah-sehn kah) (why don’t we), as in Gorufu o shimasen ka. 
(goh-roo-foo oh shee-mah-sehn ka.) (Why don’t we play golf?)
	
✓	-mashō (mah-shohh) (let’s), as in Gorufu o shimashō! (goh-roo-foo oh 
shee-mah-shohh!) (Let’s play golf!)
Examples of these two endings are in the nearby Talkin’ the Talk dialogue.
	
You can ask for permission by using a verb in the te-form and adding mo ii 
desu ka to it. If you’re giving permission, adding the sentence final particle yo 
(yoh) after mo ii desu is nice; it shows your willingness. (Turn to Chapter 3 for 
more about the particle yo.) For example,
泳いでもいいですか。 Oyoide mo ii desu ka. (oh-yoh-ee-deh moh eee 
deh-soo kah.) (Is it okay to swim?)
泳いでもいいですよ。 Oyoide mo ii desu yo. (oh-yoh-ee-deh moh eee 
deh-soo yoh.) (You may swim.)
ピアノを弾いてもいいですよ。 Piano o hiite mo ii desu yo. (pee-ah-noh 
oh heee-teh moh eee deh-soo yoh.) (It’s okay to play the piano.)

226
Part II: Japanese in Action 
To express prohibition, saying must not, add wa ikemasen rather than mo ii 
desu, as in the following examples:
泳いではいけません。 Oyoide wa ikemasen. (oh-yoh-ee-deh wah ee-keh-
mah-sehn.) (You must not swim.)
レスリングをしてはいけません。 Resuringu o shite wa ikemasen. (reh-
soo-reen-goo oh shee-teh wah ee-keh-mah-sehn.) (You must not wrestle.)

Living the Sporting Life
Do you like to participate in or sit back and watch supōtsu (soo-pohh-tsoo) 
(sports)? Yakyū (yah-kyooo) (baseball) and sakkā (sahk-kahh) (soccer) are the 
most popular sports in Japan. But Japanese also enjoy the following sports:
	
✓	バレーボール barēbōru (bah-rehh-bohh-roo) (volleyball)
	
✓	バスケットボール basukettobōru (bah-soo-keht-toh-bohh-roo) (basketball)
	
✓	フットボール futtobōru (foot-toh-bohh-roo) (football)
	
✓	ゴルフ gorufu (goh-roo-foo) (golf)
	
✓	空手 karate (kah-rah-teh) (karate)
Stop and smell the flowers
Japanese celebrate the arrival of spring by 
having 花見 hanami (hah-nah-mee), an infor­
mal party under the cherry trees when the trees 
are in bloom. They spread out blankets, eat, 
play music, sing, dance, and get drunk. Parks 
with cherry trees become very crowded in the 
spring, and groups compete for places to party. 
As in the Japanese proverb 花より団子 hana 
yori dango (hah-nah yoh-ree dahn-go) (dump­
lings rather than flowers), many people enjoy 
eating and drinking more than appreciating the 
beautiful flowers above their heads!

Sumō (soo-mohh) (sumo wrestling) is the national sport in Japan. The object of 
sumō is to push your opponent out of a ring or to force any part of his body, 
other than the soles of his feet, to touch the ground. Successful sumō wres­
tlers in the top division usually weigh around 325 pounds. And believe it or 
not, many strong sumō wrestlers are from outside Japan! 
Even if you don’t play sports, you can still enjoy watching them as a spectator. 
In that case, you should know how to conjugate the ru-verb miru (mee-roo) 
(to watch):

creativity. Which of the following art forms interests you?
	
✓	油絵 aburae (ah-boo-rah-eh) (oil painting)
	
✓	彫刻 chōkoku (chohh-koh-koo) (sculpting/engraving)
	
✓	生け花 ikebana (ee-keh-bah-nah) (flower arranging)

Making Music with Instruments
Many Japanese kids take piano and violin lessons because their moms want 
them to. But when they become teenagers, they play the electric guitar in 
rock bands. Do you play any of these musical instruments?
	
✓	バイオリン baiorin (bah-ee-oh-reen) (violin)
	
✓	チェロ chero (cheh-roh) (cello)
	
✓	ドラム doramu (doh-rah-moo) (drums)
	
✓	エレキギター erekigitā (eh-reh-kee gee-tahh) (electric guitar)
	
✓	フルート furūto (foo-rooo-toh) (flute)
	
✓	ギター gitā (gee-tahh) (guitar)
	
✓	ピアノ piano (pee-ah-noh) (piano)
	
✓	サクソフォン sakusofon (sah-koo-soh-fohn) (saxophone)
	
✓	トランペット toranpetto (toh-rahn-peht-toh) (trumpet)
If you’ve seen old Japanese films or visited a traditional Japanese town, 
you’ve probably heard one of these Japanese musical instruments:
	
✓	琴 koto (koh-toh) (long Japanese zither with 13 strings)
	
✓	尺八 shakuhachi (shah-koo-hah-chee) (Japanese end-blown flute)
	
✓	三味線 shamisen (shah-mee-sehn) (three-stringed Japanese banjo)
	
✓	太鼓 taiko (tah-ee-koh) (Japanese drums)
	
✓	横笛 yokobue (yoh-koh-boo-eh) (Japanese transverse flute)
	
Telling someone you play a specific instrument in Japanese isn’t as simple as 
it is in English. Different types of musical instruments use different verbs to 
mean to play. For wind instruments, you use the verb fuku (foo-koo). So to say I 
play the flute, you’d say furūto o fuku (foo-rooo-toh oh foo-koo). For a stringed 
instrument or a keyboard, you use the verb hiku (hee-koo). So to say I play the 
piano and the violin, you’d say piano o hiku (pee-ah-noh oh hee-koo) and baio­
rin o hiku (bah-ee-oh-reen oh hee-koo), respectively. For drums, use the verb 
tataku (tah-tah-koo).
	
If you aren’t sure or don’t remember which verb to use for a musical instru­
ment, you can use the verb suru (soo-roo). It’s not perfect, but others will 
understand what you mean.

230
Part II: Japanese in Action 
	
Did your mother make you practice violin or piano when you were younger, 
like many Japanese moms do? If so, she probably commanded you to. Express 
a command or give an order by using a verb in its stem form plus -nasai. For 
example, the stem form of the verb suru is shi (shee). So Shinasai! (shee-nah-
sah-ee!) means Do it! It’s an order. Now you’re the boss and can order your 
child to do the following:
	
✓	バイオリンを練習しなさい。 Baiorin o renshū shinasai! (bah-ee-oh-reen 
oh rehn-shooo shee-nah-sah-ee!) (Practice your violin!)
	
✓	勉強しなさい。 Benkyō shinasai! (behn-kyohh shee-nah-sah-ee!) (Study!)
	
✓	聞きなさい。 Kikinasai. (kee-kee-nah-sah-ee!) (Listen!)
	
✓	掃除しなさい。 Sōji o shinasai! (sohh-jee oh shee-nah-sah-ee!) (Clean!)
Just don’t use such commands with your spouse if you want to stay happily 
married.

Playing Games
You can always play a game when you have some free time. These games 
aren’t artistic, academic, or athletic, but they can make you forget about the 
real world for a while:
	
✓	ボードゲーム bōdo gēmu (bohh-doh gehh-moo) (board game)
	
✓	チェス chesu (cheh-soo) (chess)
	
✓	碁 go (goh) (go [a kind of Japanese chess])
	
✓	マージャン mājan (mahh-jahn) (mahjongg [a kind of Chinese chess])
	
✓	パチンコ pachinko (pah-cheen-koh) (a Japanese pinball game)
	
✓	トランプ toranpu (toh-rahn-poo) (cards)
When you want to say to play a game, use the verb suru, as in chesu o suru 
(cheh-soo oh soo-roo) (to play chess), and just conjugate suru. (I show you 
this conjugation earlier in the chapter.)

Your ticket to ride: The Japan rail pass
Many tourists who come to Japan are shocked 
to find out the high cost of train tickets. A two-
hour ride on the 新幹線 Shinkansen (sheen-
kahn-sehn) (Bullet Train) can cost more than 
100 dollars. To help foreign travelers in Japan, 
the Japan Railway Group has been offering ジ
ャパンレールパス japan rēru pasu (jah-pahn 
rehh-roo pah-soo) (the Japan rail pass), which 
short-term visitors to Japan can use for a limited 
time for sightseeing purposes. All you need to do 
is purchase a coupon through a travel agency 
before entering Japan. Then in Japan you 
exchange the coupon for the pass at a train sta­
tion when you’re ready to start using it. The pass 
is good for travel on all major forms of transpor­
tation provided by the Japan Railway Group, 
with a few exceptions. Note: The pass is mainly 
for non-Japanese passport holders, but some 
Japanese citizens who live overseas are also 
eligible; check the qualification criteria carefully.
Following are some of the interesting historical buildings you can find in 
many countries:
	
✓	教会 kyōkai (kyohh-kah-ee) (churches)
	
✓	お城 o-shiro (oh-shee-roh) (castles)
	
✓	お寺 o-tera (oh-teh-rah) (temples)
You may notice that the sentence-ending particle yo (yoh) is used for empha­
sis in the following Talkin’ the Talk dialogue. Depending on the intonation 
and the context, you may sound very pushy, very helpful, or very enthusias­
tic when you use yo. So you better not use yo when you talk to your teacher 
or boss until you understand exactly when and how to use it. Often, the femi­
nine ending wa occurs right before the emphasis particle yo.
	
The dialogue also features the conjunction word demo (deh-moh) (however). 
Use conjunction words such as demo to clarify the nature of your statement in 
relation with the previous statement made by you or someone else. Note that 
even though demo is similar to the particle ga (gah), which is placed at the 
end of a clause (see Chapter 10), demo is actually a word, so you place it at 
the beginning of a sentence.
旅行をしたいです。 でも, お金がありません。 Ryokō o shitai desu. 
Demo, okane ga arimasen. (ryoh-kohh oh shee-tah-ee deh-soo. deh-moh, 
oh-kah-neh-gah ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (I want to go on a trip. However, I have 
no money.)
サンフランシスコは行きました。 でも, ロサンゼルスは行きませんでし
た。 Sanfuranshisuko wa ikimashita. Demo, rosanzerusu wa ikimasen 
deshita. (sahn-foo-rahn-shee-soo-koh wah ee-kee-mah-shee-tah. deh-moh, 
roh-sahn-zeh-roo-soo wah ee-kee-mah-sehn deh-shee-tah.) (I went to San 
Francisco. However, I didn’t go to Los Angeles.)

 Chapter 14: Planning a Trip
お金はありません。 でも, よく旅行をします。 O-kane wa arimasen. Demo, 
yoku ryokō o shimasu. (oh-kah-neh wah ah-ree-mah-sehn. deh-moh, yoh-
koo ryoh-kohh oh shee-mah-soo.) (I don’t have money, but I often travel.)
Other conjunction words include desukara (deh-soo-kah-rah) (therefore), 
sorekara (soh-reh-kah-rah) (and then), soreni (soh-reh-neee) (furthermore), 
and sōsuruto (sohh-soo-roo-toh) (then). To see examples of sorekara and 
sōsuruto in action, turn to Chapter 8; for examples of desukara (therefore), 
check out the following sample sentences:
お金がありません。 ですから, 旅行ができません。 O-kane ga arimasen. 
Desukara, ryokō ga dekimasen. (oh-kah-neh gah ah-ree-mah-sehn. deh-
soo-kah-rah, ryoh-kohh gah deh-kee-mah-sehn.) (I don’t have any money. 
Therefore, I can’t travel.)
日本に２週間います。 ですから, ジャパンレールパスを買いました。 
Nihon ni nishūkan imasu. Desukara, japan rēru pasu o kaimashita. 
(nee-hohn nee nee-shooo-kahn ee-mah-soo. deh-soo-kah-rah, jah-pahn 
rehh-roo-pah-soo oh kah-ee-mah-shee-tah.) (I’ll be in Japan for two weeks. 
So I bought a Japan rail pass.)
	
Keep in mind that aru (ah-roo) (to exist) is slightly irregular — its negative form is 
nai. When you talk about whether you have or don’t have something, say aru and 
nai, respectively. (For more information on using the verb aru, see Chapter 7.)
Talkin’ the Talk
	
Junko and Hiroko are co-workers at a company that is going to be 
closed for one week at the end of the year. They’ve decided to go 
on a trip together, and they’re debating where to go. (Track 34)
Junko:

How about Europe?
Hiroko:

Dealing with Passports and Visas
Because the U.S. and Japanese governments have a mutual agreement, 
American citizens and Japanese citizens can visit each other’s countries 
without a visa for a short sightseeing visit. However, you’ll definitely need a 
passport. My advice? Don’t wait until the last minute to obtain a passport or 
renew one. Following are some vocabulary words and phrases that are bound 
to come in handy when dealing with passports and visas:
	
✓	ビザ or 査証 biza or sashō (bee-zah or sah-shohh) (visa)
	
✓	長期滞在 chōki taizai (chohh-kee tah-ee-zah-ee) (long-term visit)
	
✓	入国目的 nyūkoku mokuteki (nyooo-koh-koo moh-koo-tah-kee) (purpose 
of visit)
	
✓	入国審査 nyūkoku shinsa (nyooo-koh-koo sheehn-sah) (immigration)
Japan: Running hot and cold
If you’re planning a trip to Japan, you should 
know that although the country has four seasons 
(including a brief rainy season), the climate varies 
tremendously depending on where in the country 
you are. Why? Because Japan is a long, narrow 
country. Japan’s north end is at the same latitude 
as Montreal, and its southern tip is at the same 
latitude as the Florida Keys. So it snows heavily up 
north in Hokkaido, but it’s quite hot farther south 
in Kyushu. Also, know that Japan uses the Celsius 
scale (°C) rather than the Fahrenheit scale (°F) 
for indicating temperature. So if you keep your air 
conditioning set at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, you’d 
set it at about 25 degrees Celsius.

Getting Help from a Travel Agency
If arranging the transportation and accommodations for your trip is too much 
for you, get help from a ryokō gaisha (ryoh-kohh gah-ee-shah) (travel agency) 
and choose the plan that satisfies your needs. To explore the agency’s tours 
and packages, you’ll need these words and phrases:
	
✓	ホテル hoteru (hoh-teh-roo) (hotel)
	
✓	観光 kankō (kahn-kohh) (sightseeing)
	
✓	キャンセル kyanseru (kyahn-seh-roo) (cancel)
	
✓	キャンセル料 kyanseruryō (kyahn-seh-roo-ryohh) (cancellation fee)
	
✓	申込書 mōshikomisho (mohh-shee-koh-mee-shoh) (application form)
	
✓	パッケージ pakkēji (pahk-kehh-jee) (package)
	
✓	添乗員 tenjōin (tehn-johh-een) (tour conductor)
	
✓	ツアー tsuā (tsoo-ahh) (tour)
	
✓	予約 yoyaku (yoh-yah-koo) (reservation)
Tell the agency where you want to go and how many days and nights you 
want to spend there. In Japanese, say the number of nights first, and then say 
the number of days. To specify the number of nights, use the counter -haku. 
Depending on the preceding number, -haku alternates with -paku. Here’s the 
general pattern (for more help specifying the number of days, flip to Chapter 5).
	
✓	一泊二日 ip-paku futsuka (eep-pah-koo foo-tsoo-kah) (one night, two 
days)
	
✓	二泊三日 ni-haku mikka (nee-hah-koo meek-kah) (two nights, three days)
	
✓	七泊八日 nana-haku yōka (nah-nah-hah-koo yohh-kah) (seven nights, 
eight days)

240
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Also, check what the travel agency’s packages include. Tsukimasu (tsoo-kee-
mah-soo) means to be included. Its dictionary form is tsuku (tsoo-koo). Here’s 
how to conjugate this u-verb:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
付く
tsuku
tsoo-koo
付かない
tsukanai
tsoo-kah-nah-ee
付き（ます）
tsuki(masu)
tsoo-kee(-mah-soo)
付いて
tsuite
tsoo-ee-teh
You may hear phrases like these after inquiring about what’s included in a 
particular travel package:
	
✓	朝食と夕食が付きます。 Chōshoku to yūshoku ga tsukimasu. (chohh-
shoh-koo toh yooo-shoh-koo gah tsoo-kee-mah-soo.) (Breakfast and 
dinner are included.)
	
✓	ホテル付きで３万円です。 Hoteru tsuki de 3-man-en desu. (hoh-teh-
roo tsoo-kee deh sahn-mahn-ehn deh-soo.) (It costs 30,000 yen with the 
hotel fee.)
	
✓	添乗員が同行します。 Tenjōin ga dōkō shimasu. (tehn-johh-een gah 
dohh-kohh shee-mah-soo.) (A tour guide will accompany you.)
	
✓	東京ディズニーランド一日観光です。 Tōkyō dizunīrando ichi-nichi 
kankō desu. (tohh-kyohh dee-zoo-neee-rahn-doh ee-chee-nee-chee kahn-
kohh deh-soo.) (It’s a one-day sightseeing trip to Tokyo Disneyland.)
Stating Your Opinions
If you’re planning your trip with others, you may need to make a case for a 
certain hotel you want to stay at or sight you want to see. To state what you 
think, use the u-verb omou (oh-moh-oo) (to think). Practice conjugating the 
verb omou. Don’t forget the w sound in the negative form.
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
思う
omou
oh-moh-oo
思わない
omowanai
oh-moh-wah-nah-ee
思い（ます）
omoi(masu)
oh-moh-ee(-mah-soo)
思って
omotte
oh-moht-teh
As I explain in Chapter 12, you use the quotation particle to (toh) to mark a 
sentence that expresses what you think. Just make sure the sentence before 
the particle to ends in a verb or adjective in the plain/informal form.

241
 Chapter 14: Planning a Trip
田中さんも行くと思います。 Tanaka-san mo iku to omoimasu. (tah-nah-
kah-sahn moh ee-koo toh oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think Mr. Tanaka will 
also go there.)
あの人は添乗員だと思います。 Ano hito wa tenjōin da to omoimasu. 
(ah-noh hee-toh wah tehn-johh-een dah toh oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think 
that person is a tour conductor.)
あのホテルはよくないと思います。 Ano hoteru wa yokunai to 
omoimasu. (ah-noh hoh-teh-roo wah yoh-koo-nah-ee toh oh-moh-ee-mah-
soo.) (I think that hotel isn’t good.)
そう思います。 Sō omoimasu. (sohh oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think so.)
	
Both omou and kangaeru (kahn-gah-eh-roo) mean to think, but they’re not 
interchangeable. Omou is to think in the sense of having an opinion, and kan­
gaeru expresses more of a sense of pondering.
これはいいと思います。 Kore wa ii to omoimasu. (koh-reh wah eee toh 
oh-moh-ee-mah-soo.) (I think this is good.)
それをよく考えてください。 Sore o yoku kangaete kudasai. (soh-reh 
oh yoh-koo kahn-gah-eh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please think carefully 
about that.)
	
To indicate that what you think is just a guess, use deshō (deh-shohh) at the 
end of the sentence. The sentence before deshō is in the plain/informal style, 
but just remember to drop the da (dah) that appears in the plain present affir­
mative form of desu or a na-type adjective. Here are some examples:
あのホテルは高いでしょう。 Ano hoteru wa takai deshō. (ah-noh hoh-
tah-roo wah tah-kah-ee deh-shohh.) (That hotel is probably expensive.)
あの人は添乗員でしょう。 Ano hito wa tenjōin deshō. (ah-noh hee-toh 
wah tehn-johh-een deh-shohh.) (I guess that person is a tour conductor.)
You can use kamoshiremasen (kah-moh-shee-reh-mah-sehn) to say It’s pos­
sible that . . . (see Chapter 6 for info on how to use kamoshiremasen).
Eating a box lunch from the train station
駅弁 Ekiben (eh-kee-behn) is a box lunch sold 
at 駅 eki (eh-kee) (train stations) or on trains. 
Different eki sell different ekiben with unique 
names. The name of my favorite ekiben is 峠
の釜飯 Tōge no kamameshi (tohh-geh noh 
kah-mah-meh-shee) (Mountain Pass Chicken-
Vegetable Rice in a Pot) from Nagano.
Some ekiben are famous, and people visit the 
eki or get on the train just to buy one of these 
lunches. If you travel by train in Japan, buy 
an ekiben and a bottle of hot green tea at the 
platform. What a fun experience!

242
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Packing for Your Trip
The first step for packing for your trip is to decide on the luggage. Are you 
going to take a big sūtsukēsu (sooo-tsoo-kehh-soo) (suitcase) or a smaller 
ryokō kaban (ryoh-kohh kah-bahn) (travel bag)?
Whatever bag you choose, be sure to pack clothing staples such as a sētā (sehh-
tahh) (sweater), puruōbā (poo-roo-ohh-bahh) (pullover), sunīkā (soo-neee-kahh) 
(sneakers), and jīnzu (jeeen-zoo) (jeans); see Chapter 10 for additional cloth­
ing vocabulary words. And if you’re traveling to a warm destination, don’t 
forget to pack some weather-appropriate gear, including the following:
	
✓	バイザー baizā (bah-ee-zahh) (visor)
	
✓	帽子 bōshi (bohh-shee) (hat/cap)
	
✓	サンダル sandaru (sahn-dah-roo) (sandals)
	
✓	サングラス sangurasu (sahn-goo-rah-soo) (sunglasses)
What else do you need? First, conjugate the u-verb iru (ee-roo) (to 
need) — not to be confused with the verb iru (ee-roo) (to exist), which is a 
ru-verb.
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
要る

✓	歯磨き粉 hamigakiko (hah-mee-gah-kee-koh) (toothpaste)
	
✓	剃刀 kamisori (kah-mee-soh-ree) (razor)
	
✓	化粧品 keshōhin (keh-shohh-heen) (cosmetics)
	
✓	くし kushi (koo-shee) (comb)
	
✓	石鹸 sekken (sehk-kehn) (soap)

✓	懐中電灯 kaichūdentō (kah-ee-chooo-dehn-tohh) (flashlight)
	
✓	カメラ kamera (kah-meh-rah) (camera)
	
✓	カーナビ kānabi (kahh-nah-bee) (car navigation system)

Dealing with Money

In This Chapter

▶	Visiting the bank
▶	Withdrawing money from the ATM
▶	Paying with cold, hard cash
▶	Burning up the plastic
K

ane wa tenka no mawari mono. (kah-neh wah tehn-kah noh mah-wah-
ree-moh-noh.) (Money goes around the world.). This Japanese proverb 
means that the o-kane (oh-kah-neh) (money) you spend today will come 
back to you in the future. You buy other people’s products, but they also 
buy yours. Use your money to make yourself, your family, and your friends 
happy.
In this chapter, I give you important words and phrases for handling money. I 
also explain how to talk about acquiring and spending money in Japanese.
Getting Money
You have to work if you want to make money, unless your parents or grand­
parents are extremely rich. But I’m not concerned about where your income 
comes from; in this section, I’m just interested in how you access it. You 
can get your money from an ATM, a foreign-currency exchange counter, or a 
bank. I know you have some under your mattress too. Oh, it’s not under your 
mattress? Then where is it? Can you tell me in Japanese?

246
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Exchanging money
If you’re in Japan, the en (ehn) (yen) is the only acceptable currency. Don’t 
say yen; say en. Drop that y sound. As you can see, the yen sign, ¥, looks 
like an upper case Y with two horizontal lines. (Note that ¥ is the currency 
sign, not a kanji. The kanji for yen is 円, which is read as en [ehn].) You 
can exchange your money for en at the airport or at major banks. Check out 
Table 15-1 and find the foreign currency that you have in your pocket.

Some of the responses you may get when you exchange currency are as 
follows:
	
✓	買いは１ドル８０円, 売りは１ドル８１円です。 Kai wa ichi-doru 80-en, 
uri wa ichi-doru 81-en desu. (kah-ee wa ee-chee-doh-roo hah-chee-jooo-
ehn, oo-ree wah ee-chee-doh-roo hah-chee-jooo-ee-chee-ehn deh-soo.) 
(The rate for exchanging dollars for yen is 80 yen to the dollar; the rate for 
exchanging yen for dollars is 81 yen to the dollar.)
	
✓	手数料は含まれています。 Tesūryō wa fukumarete imasu. (teh-
sooo-ryohh wah foo-koo-mah-reh-teh ee-mah-soo.) (The fee is already 
included.)
	
✓	今日の為替レートは昨日と同じです。 Kyō no kawase rēto wa kinō to

 Chapter 15: Dealing with Money in a Foreign Land
Opening a bank account
Bank is ginkō (geen-kohh) in Japanese. It sounds like the popular dietary sup­
plement ginko biloba, which is supposed to increase your brainpower, but it 
has nothing to do with that. I know a lot of people who don’t use their brains 
at all when they withdraw money from the ginkō.
	
When you enter a bank in Japan, you’ll hear this right away: Irasshaimase. (ee-
rahs-shah-ee-mah-sehh.) (Welcome.). The bank tellers dress in uniforms, and 
they treat you almost like a god. After you enter the bank, pick up a ticket and 
wait until your number is called. Most Japanese banks have comfy couches, 
current magazines, and TVs that make your wait almost enjoyable. When 
your number is called, go to the designated madoguchi (mah-doh-goo-chee) 
(window). Japanese banks have low windows so that customers can sit down 
while they perform their transactions. 
	
When you open a Japanese bank account, the bank clerk asks you to fill out 
a form and present your identification. When opening a bank account, bring 
your inkan (een-kahn) (seal) along with your identification. Inkan is a seal 
stamp of your name; it’s used in lieu of signatures in Japan. You can get a 
custom-made inkan pretty cheaply, although some inkan can be very expen­
sive depending on the material that they use. Some banks let foreigners open 
an account with their signatures without requiring an inkan, but be sure to 
confirm your bank’s policy before you go in to open an account.
To open a bank account, you need your identification as well as some money 
for your initial yokin (yoh-keen) (deposit). You also need the u-verb hiraku 
(hee-rah-koo) (to open). Check out its conjugated forms, and notice the k in 
all the forms except the te-form.

have tōza yokin kōza (tohh-zah yoh-keen kohh-zah) (checking accounts), 
but individuals usually don’t. People often pay bills online, through a special 
postal service, or at a convenience store.
	
Bank clerks speak to customers by using super-polite words and phrases. 
To make their requests very polite, bank clerks may use a verb in the stem 
form and place it between o (oh) and kudasai (koo-dah-sah-ee), as in O-kaki 
kudasai. (oh-kah-kee koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please write it.) and O-mise kudasai. 
(oh-mee-seh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please show it to me). In addition, many words 
that bank tellers use start with the polite prefix go or o. Go should be used for 
words from Chinese and o for native Japanese words, but this guideline has so 
many exceptions that you really have to just consider each word one by one. 
(See Chapters 4 and 12 for more information about these polite prefixes.) Be 
ready for the following super-polite requests from people at the bank:
	
✓	ご住所とお電話番号をお願いします。 Go-jūsho to o-denwa-bangō o 
onegaishimasu. (goh-jooo-shoh toh oh-dehn-wah-bahn-gohh oh oh-neh-
gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (Your address and your telephone number, please.)
	
✓	身分証明書をお見せください。 Mibun shōmeisho o o-mise kudasai. 
(mee-boon shohh-mehh-shoh oh oh-mee-seh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please 
show me your identification.)
	
✓	お名前をお書きください。 O-namae o o-kaki kudasai. (oh-nah-mah-eh 
oh oh-kah-kee koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please write your name.)
	
✓	こちらにご捺印をお願いいたします。 Kochira ni go-natsuin o onegai 
itashimasu. (koh-chee-rah nee goh-nah-tsoo-een oh oh-neh-gah-ee ee-
tah-shee-mah-soo.) (Please stamp your name seal here.)
Making withdrawals from your account
The most convenient way of withdrawing money from your bank is to find a 
nearby ATM. If you use the machine at your own bank, you can insert your 
passbook in addition to your card, so the transaction details can be printed 

251
 Chapter 15: Dealing with Money in a Foreign Land
on your passbook on the spot (meaning no need to keep the slip). If you want 
to withdraw your money at the window, you’ll have to bring your passbook 
and your inkan and fill out a withdrawal slip. (I tell you all about inkan in the 
preceding section.) Actually, bring your identification along as well when you 
withdraw your money manually.
Regardless of how you choose to withdraw your money, here are the words 
you need:
	
✓	引き出す hikidasu (hee-kee-dah-soo) (to withdraw)
	
✓	自動引き落とし jidō hikiotoshi (jee-dohh hee-kee-oh-toh-shee) (auto­
matic payment)
	
✓	口座番号 kōza bangō (kohh-zah bahn-gohh) (account number)
Note that if you withdraw your money at the window, you’ll need to state 
your request along these lines:
	
✓	１０万円引き出したいんですが。 Jū-man-en hikidashi-tai-n-desu ga. 
(jooo-mahn-ehn hee-kee-dah-shee-tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (I’d like to with­
draw 100,000 yen [but is it possible?].)
	
✓	残高を調べてくださいませんか。 Zandaka o shirabete kudasai masen 
ka. (zahn-dah-kah oh shee-rah-beh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee mah-sehn kah.) 
(Could you please check the balance?)
Using an ATM
An ATM (ehh-teee-eh-moo) (ATM) makes getting cash easy: All you need is 
your kyasshu kādo (kyahs-shoo kahh-doh) (ATM card). You can select from 
the following functions displayed on the ATM:
	
✓	お預け入れ o-azukeire (oh-ah-zoo-keh-ee-reh) (deposit)
	
✓	お振込み o-furikomi (oh-foo-ree-koh-mee) (transfer)
	
✓	お引き出し o-hikidashi (oh-hee-kee-dah-shee) (withdrawal)
	
✓	残高照会 zandaka shōkai (zahn-dah-kah shohh-kah-ee) (balance inquiry)
ATMs in Japan often give you instruction verbally, but some only show the 
instructions in Japanese script on their screens. Pay attention to the kana 
and rōmaji in the following list of common ATM instructions, and you’ll be 
good to go either way:
	
✓	カードをお入れください。 Kādo o o-ire kudasai. (kahh-doh oh oh-ee-reh 
koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Insert your card, please.)
	
✓	暗証番号をどうぞ。 Anshō bangō o dōzo. (ahn-shohh bahn-gohh oh 
dohh-zoh.) (Enter your PIN.)

amount please.)
	
✓	確認してください。 Kakunin shite kudasai. (kah-koo-neen shee-teh koo-

✓	現金をお受け取りください。 Genkin o o-uketori kudasai. (gehn-keen oh

✓	カードをお取りください。 Kādo o o-tori kudasai. (kahh-doh oh oh-toh-

✓	ありがとうございました。 Arigatō gozaimashita. (ah-ree-gah-tohh goh-
zah-ee-mah-shee-tah.) (Thank you very much.)
Conjugate the important u-verb toru (toh-roo) (to take). Notice that the r 
appears in all the forms except the te-form. Just swallow the r in the te-form.

Spending Money
Spending money shouldn’t always be a pain; it should be a rewarding experi­
ence as well. What’s the point in saving all your cash until you can no longer 
use it? As the saying goes, “You can’t take it with you.” Whether you believe 
in spending only cash or you’re a kurejitto kādo (koo-reh-jeet-toh kahh-doh) 
(credit card) worshipper, the next sections have the information you need to 
get that money spent.
Ka-ching! Shelling out cash
Cash is convenient for buying little things like a cup of coffee, a magazine, or 
a snack from the vending machine. Most countries’ currencies include both 
shihei (shee-hehh) (bills) and kōka (kohh-kah) (coins).

253
 Chapter 15: Dealing with Money in a Foreign Land
	
Satsu (sah-tsoo) is also used instead of shihei when following an amount, as 
in sen-en satsu (sehn-ehn sah-tsoo) (¥1,000 bill). Similarly, dama (dah-mah) is 
also used instead of kōka when following an amount, as in jū-en dama (jooo-
ehn dah-mah) (¥10 coin).
Following are all the bills and coins used in Japan:
	
✓	一万円紙幣 ichi-man-en shihei (ee-chee-mahn-ehn shee-hehh) (¥10,000 
bill)
	
✓	五千円紙幣 go-sen-en shihei (goh-sehn-ehn shee-hehh) (¥5,000 bill)
	
✓	二千円紙幣 ni-sen-en shihei (nee-sehn-ehn shee-hehh) (¥2,000 bill)
	
✓	千円紙幣 sen-en shihei (sehn-ehn shee-hehh) (¥1,000 bill)
	
✓	五百円硬貨 go-hyaku-en kōka (goh-hyah-koo-ehn kohh-kah) (¥500 coin)
	
✓	百円硬貨 hyaku-en kōka (hyah-koo-ehn kohh-kah) (¥100 coin)
	
✓	五十円硬貨 go-jū-en kōka (goh-jooo-ehn kohh-kah) (¥50 coin)
	
✓	十円硬貨 jū-en kōka (jooo-ehn kohh-kah) (¥10 coin)
	
✓	五円硬貨 go-en kōka (goh-ehn kohh-kah) (¥5 coin)
	
✓	一円硬貨 ichi-en kōka (ee-chee-ehn kohh-kah) (¥1 coin)
	
The ¥2,000 bill note was issued in the year 2000 with limited quantity. If you 
have it, I recommend keeping it instead of using it! There’s also an old-
fashioned supplementary currency unit called sen (sehn), which is 1 ⁄ 100 of ¥1, 
and 厘 rin (reen), which is 1 ⁄ 1,000 of ¥1. Currencies based on sen and rin were 
taken out of circulation in 1953 but are still used in some contexts, including 
stock markets.
To count coins and bills, use the counter -mai, as in ichi-mai (eeh-chee-mah-
ee), ni-mai (nee-mah-ee), san-mai (sahn-mah-ee), and so on. (See Chapter 5 
for more about -mai and other counters.) Now, you’re ready to count, spend, 
borrow, or lend your genkin. Conjugate the ru-verb kariru (kah-ree-roo) (to 
borrow) and the u-verb kasu (kah-soo) (to lend).

mahn-ehn-sah-tsoo shee-kah ah-ree-mah-sehn.) (I have only ¥10,000 bills.)
	
To say only, place the particle shika (shee-kah) at the end of the noun and 
make the verb negative, as in the last example. You can read more on shika in 
Chapter 13. 
Charge! Paying with plastic
A credit card is almost a must-have in today’s world, particularly when 
you’re traveling, because you need a credit card for renting a car and reserv­
ing a hotel room. In Japan, credit cards are accepted in many stores, hotels, 
and restaurants, but just in case, check first to see whether you can use them 
in a given establishment. For example, credit card acceptance is still limited 
in rural areas of Japan.
Conjugate the u-verb tsukau (tsoo-kah-oo) (to use). Just watch out for the w 
sound that appears only in the negative.

 Chapter 15: Dealing with Money in a Foreign Land
	
To ask whether you can use your credit card, you first need to know how 
to say can. For example, tsukau (tsoo-kah-oo) means to use, but tsukaeru 
(tsoo-kah-eh-roo) means to be able to use or can use. Then, you take this verb, 
tsukaeru, and conjugate it — for example, Kurejitto kādo wa tsukaemasu ka. 
(koo-reh-jeet-toh kahh-doh wa tsoo-kah-eh-mah-soo kah.) (Can I use a credit 
card?) Turn to Chapter 13 to find out exactly how to make the can form of vari­
ous verbs.
	
If you have multiple credit cards and you want to know which one is accepted 
at a particular shop or restaurant, use the particle ka (kah), which means 
or. You can use ka to list two or more choices. When listing more than two 
choices, simply place ka after each noun except the last one. A few examples 
may be helpful:
ビザかマスターカードは使えますか。 Biza ka Masutā kādo wa tsukae­
masu. (bee-zah kah mah-soo-tahh kahh-doh wah tsoo-kah-eh-mah-soo.) 
(Can I use a Visa or MasterCard?)
アメリカンエキスプレスかディスカバーかＪＣＢは使えます。 Amerikan 
Ekisupuresu ka Disukabā ka JCB wa tsukaemasu. (ah-meh-ree-kahn 
eh-kee-soo-poo-reh-soo kah dee-soo-kah-bahh ka jehh-sheee-beee wa 
tsoo-kah-eh-mah-soo.) (If it’s American Express, Discover, or JCB, you can 
use it.)
空港か銀行で両替をします。 Kūkō ka ginkō de ryōgae o shimasu. (kooo-
kohh kah geen-kohh deh ryohh-gah-eh oh shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll exchange 
money at the airport or at the bank.)
Perhaps you like to use your debitto kādo (deh-beet-toh kahh-doh) (debit 
card) to pay for everyday expenses. Debitto kādo have one advantage over 
kurejitto kādo: Because the money is deducted directly from your bank 
account, you can’t spend more than you have.
	
To explain that you use your debit card to pay for purchases, say Debitto 
kādo de haraimasu. (deh-beet-toh kahh-doh deh hah-rah-ee-mah-soo.) (I pay 
by debit card.) Remember that the particle de (deh) marks the location of 
activity. It also specifies the tools and means for the action, as in the following 
examples:
箸で食べます。 Hashi de tabemasu. (hah-shee deh tah-beh-mah-soo.) (I 
eat with chopsticks.)
鉛筆で書きます。 Enpitsu de kakimasu. (ehn-pee-tsoo deh kah-kee-mah-
soo.) (I write with a pencil.)

K

ōtsū kikan (kohh-tsooo kee-kahn) (transportation) is an indispensable 
part of life. Choose the method that meets your needs. Which costs 
less, driving a car or taking a train? Which is less hectic, taking a subway 
or taking a cab? Which makes you feel safer, flying or driving? This chapter 
provides you with the essential phrases that you need to get around town by 
using various types of kōtsū kikan.
Getting On and Off with the 
Verbs Noru and Oriru
The verb noru (noh-roo) is used for all forms of transportation, including 
bicycles, buses, trains, ships, and airplanes. So its translation can be to ride, 
to get on, or to get in any form of transportation, depending on the context. 
Conjugate this u-verb as follows, paying close attention to the r syllables as 
you conjugate it:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
乗る
noru
noh-roo
乗らない
noranai
noh-rah-nah-ee
乗り（ます）
nori(masu)
noh-ree(-mah-soo)
乗って
notte
noht-teh

258
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
When using noru in a sentence, remember to mark the form of transportation 
that you’re taking with the particle ni (nee), as in the following examples:
電車に乗る densha ni noru (dehn-shah nee noh-roo) (to get on a train)
飛行機に乗る hikōki ni noru (hee-kohh-kee nee noh-roo) (to get on an 
airplane)
自転車に乗る jitensha ni noru (jee-tehn-shah nee noh-roo) (to ride a 
bicycle)
タクシーに乗る takushī ni noru (tah-koo-sheee nee noh-roo) (to get in 
a taxi)
If you know the verb noru, you have to know the verb oriru (oh-ree-roo) 
(to get off), unless you want to live on an airplane. Conjugate this ru-verb as 
follows:
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
降りる
oriru
oh-ree-roo
降りない
orinai
oh-ree-nah-ee
降り（ます）
ori(masu)
oh-ree(-mah-soo)
降りて
orite
oh-ree-teh
Like noru, you can use oriru for any form of transportation. Mark the place 
you’re getting off from with the particle kara (kah-rah) (from) or the direct 
object particle o (oh). Here are a few examples:
飛行機から降りました。 Hikōki kara orimashita. (hee-kohh-kee kah-rah 
oh-ree-mah-shee-tah.) (I got off the airplane.)
後ろの出口から降りてください。 Ushiro no deguchi kara orite kuda­
sai. (oo-shee-roh noh deh-goo-chee kah-rah oh-ree-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) 
(Please get off [the plane] via the rear exit.)
新宿で電車を降りてバスに乗ります。 Shinjuku de densha o orite basu 
ni norimasu. (sheen-joo-koo deh dehn-shah oh oh-ree-teh bah-soo nee 
noh-ree-mah-soo.) (I’ll get off the train at Shinjuku and get on the bus.)
	
In Japanese, saying you’re taking some form of transportation isn’t the same 
as saying you’re going somewhere by some form of transportation. To specify 
what form of transportation you’re using to go somewhere, use the particle 
de (deh). Place de at the end of the word for the mode of transportation, 
and place both of them somewhere before the verb. For example, Hikōki de 
Hokkaidō ni ikimasu. (hee-kohh-kee deh hohk-kah-ee-dohh nee ee-kee-mah-
soo.) means I’ll go to Hokkaido by airplane.
The general function of de is to specify how you perform a given action. 
Specifying the form of transportation is just one instance in which you use 
de. For other examples, flip to Chapter 3.

259
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
Asking about the Best Method 
of Transportation
Although you can access all kinds of transportation information — from 
schedules to fares — online nowadays, you still need to be able to ask 
the right questions when you’re wondering about the best transportation 
method for your purpose.
	
To ask questions like Which transportation method is convenient? or Which 
one can we take to get there?, use the question words dono (doh-noh) (which) 
and dore (doh-reh) (which one). So how do you know which which is which? 
If you’re asking about which of a particular thing, use dono and add the thing 
you’re asking about right after it, as in the following examples:
どのバスに乗れますか。 Dono basu ni noremasu ka. (doh-noh bah-soo 
nee noh-reh-mah-soo kah.) (Which bus can I get on?)
どの電車で行けますか。 Dono densha de ikemasu ka. (doh-noh dehn-
shah deh ee-keh-mah-soo kah.) (By which train can I go there?)
Note that noremasu and ikemasu in the preceding sentences are the poten­
tial forms of norimasu and ikimasu, respectively. By potential forms, I mean 
the verb forms that bear the meaning of can. I tell you more about these 
forms in Chapter 13.
If the name of the thing that you’re asking about is understood in the context 
or is stated separately, you don’t have to repeat that word. Just use dore 
rather than dono.
どれに乗れますか。 Dore ni noremasu ka. (doh-reh nee noh-reh-mah-soo 
kah.) (Which one can I get on?)
どれで行けますか。 Dore de ikemasu ka. (doh-reh deh ee-keh-mah-soo 
kah.) (By which one can I go there?)
	
Perhaps you’re wondering how to ask which transportation method is fast­
est, most convenient, or most inexpensive. You just have to use the adverb 
ichiban (ee-chee-bahn) (the most/-est) for that. (If you recognize the word 
ichiban as the Japanese word for first, you’re right. It literally means number 
one.) Check out the following examples, and see Chapter 10 for more details 
on using ichiban to express the most:
どのバスが一番はやいですか。 Dono basu ga ichiban hayai desu ka. 
(doh-noh bah-soo gah ee-chee-bahn hah-yah-ee deh-soo kah.) (Which bus 
is the fastest?)

260
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
どの電車が一番便利ですか。 Dono densha ga ichiban benri desu ka. 
(doh-noh dehn-shah gah ee-chee-bahn behn-ree deh-soo kah.) (Which 
train is the most convenient?)
どれが一番安いですか。 Dore ga ichiban yasui desu ka. (doh-reh gah ee-
chee-bahn yah-soo-ee deh-soo kah.) (Which one is the cheapest?)
If you want to make a comparison and alert listeners that they must choose 
from the list that you provide, you can list the items at the beginning of a 
question. Chapter 10 tells you how to do it in detail. For now, here are some 
examples:
タクシーと, 電車と, バスでは, どれが一番はやいですか。 Takushī to, 
densha to, basu de wa, dore ga ichiban hayai desu ka. (tah-koo-sheee 
toh, dehn-shah toh, bah-soo deh-wah, doh-reh gah ee-chee-bahn hah-
yah-ee deh-soo kah.) (Which are the fastest: taxis, trains, or buses?)
飛行機と, 車と, 電車と, バスでは, どれが一番安全ですか。 Hikōki to, 
kuruma to, densha to, basu de wa, dore ga ichiban anzen desu ka. (hee-
kohh-kee toh, koo-roo-mah toh, dehn-shah toh, bah-soo deh-wah, doh-reh 
gah ee-chee-bahn ahn-zehn deh-soo kah.) (Which are the safest: airplanes, 
cars, trains, or buses?)
	
If you’re comparing people, use dare (dah-reh) (who) rather than dore. And if 
you’re comparing locations, substitute doko (doh-koh) (where) for dore. To 
ask a question that compares just two items, use the question word dochira 
(doh-chee-rah) (which one out of the two), regardless of what the two items 
are. See Chapter 10 for more information about dochira and a complete dis­
cussion of comparisons.
Navigating the Airport
A hikōki (hee-kohh-kee) (airplane) is often necessary for speedy vacation 
travel and business trips, even if you’re afraid of heights. And hopping on a 
commercial plane means jumping all the hurdles that come with going to the 
kūkō (kooo-kohh) (airport). Check out the following sections for vocabulary 
that helps you navigate the boarding process, go through immigration and 
customs, and exit the airport to explore your destination.
Now boarding: Making it to the plane
Arrive at the airport early to check your luggage and get through security 
so you can enjoy the time at the airport before boarding instead of making a 
mad dash for the plane as the door closes. You’ll need these words for that:

261
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
	
✓	便 bin (been) (flight)
	
✓	チケット chiketto (chee-keht-toh) (ticket)
	
✓	ゲート gēto (gehh-toh) (gate)
	
✓	保安検査場 hoan kensajō (hoh-ahn-kehn-sah-johh) (security)
	
✓	窓 mado (mah-doh) (window)
	
✓	窓側の席 mado gawa no seki (mah-doh gah-wah noh seh-kee) (window 
seat)
	
✓	免税店 menzeiten (mehn-zehh-tehn) (duty-free shops)
	
✓	席 seki (seh-kee) (seat)
	
✓	シートベルト shītoberuto (sheee-toh-beh-roo-toh) (seatbelt)
	
✓	出国手続き shukkoku tetsuzuki (shook-koh-koo teh-tsoo-zoo-kee) 
(embarkation procedure [filling out paperwork when leaving Japan])
	
✓	搭乗券 tōjōken (tohh-johh-kehn) (boarding pass)
	
✓	搭乗手続き tōjō tetsuzuki (tohh-johh teh-tsoo-zoo-kee) (check-in)
	
✓	通路側の席 tsūro gawa no seki (tsooo-roh gah-wah noh seh-kee) (aisle 
seat)
	
Bin is a word that means flight, and it also functions as a counter that specifies 
which flight. If you need to specify a flight with its flight number, add -bin right 
after the number. For example, 18-bin (jooo-hah-chee-been) means Flight 18.
After you get on the plane, just relax. Ask the furaitoatendanto (foo-rah-ee-
toh ah-tehn-dahn-toh) (flight attendants) any questions you may have, such as 
the following:
	
✓	どのターミナルに着きますか。 Dono tāminaru ni tsukimasu ka. (doh-
noh tahh-mee-nah-roo nee tsoo-kee-mah-soo kah.) (Which terminal are 
we arriving at?)
	
✓	映画は何時からですか。 Eiga wa nan-ji kara desu ka. (ehh-gah wah 
nahn-jee kah-rah deh-soo kah.) (What time does the movie start?)
	
✓	何番ゲートに着きますか。 Nan-ban gēto ni tsukimasu ka. (nahn-bahn 
gehh-toh nee tsoo-kee-mah-soo kah.) (Which gate are we arriving at?)
	
✓	何時に着きますか。 Nan-ji ni tsukimasu ka. (nahn-jee nee tsoo-kee-mah-
soo kah.) (What time will we arrive?)
You may wonder how to say to fly in Japanese because you say things like I 
flew from New York to San Francisco last week or He’s going to fly to Las Vegas 
next week all the time. Well, Japanese usually say to go in such contexts and 
say to fly only figuratively because it’s the airplane that flies, not the people

themselves. But if you want to be figurative, here’s how to conjugate the 
u-verb tobu (toh-boo) (to fly).

Going through immigration
Before entering a foreign country, you have to meet the very serious folks 
in the nyūkoku shinsa (nyooo-koh-koo sheen-sah) (immigration) area. Here, 
everyone has to stand in line, and the line can be very long if multiple jumbo 
planes arrive at the same time. Make sure to have your passport in hand and 
be ready for some of these questions and requests:
	
✓	ビザは。 Biza wa. (bee-zah wah.) (How about your visa?)
	
✓	どこに泊まりますか。 Doko ni tomarimasu ka. (doh-koh nee toh-mah-
ree-mah-soo kah.) (Where are you staying?)
	
✓	住所は。 Jūsho wa. (jooo-shoh wah.) (Your address?)
	
✓	住所を書いてください。Jūsho o kaite kudasai. (jooo-shoh oh kah-ee-teh 
koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please write your address.)
	
✓	観光ですか。 Kankō desu ka. (kahn-kohh deh-soo kah.) (Are you here for 
sightseeing?)
	
✓	お名前は。 O-namae wa. (oh-nah-mah-eh wah.) (Your name?)
	
✓	パスポートを見せてください。 Pasupōto o misete kudasai. (pah-soo-pohh-
toh oh mee-seh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please show me your passport.)
	
✓	仕事ですか。 Shigoto desu ka. (shee-goh-toh deh-soo kah.) (Are you 
here for business?)
Chapter 14 gives you more details and Japanese terminology related to pass­
ports and visas.
Getting through customs
After you get through immigration, go to the tenimotsu hikiwatashijō (teh-
nee-moh-tsoo hee-kee-wah-tah-shee-johh) (baggage claim) and pick up your 
suitcases, bags, boxes, or whatever. Head straight to zeikan (zehh-kahn) (cus­
toms) after you have all your belongings. The lines at customs usually aren’t 

263
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
as long as the lines at immigration because not many people have items to 
declare. However, you should be sure to pay the zeikin (zehh-keen) (tax), if 
necessary. Certain items are menzei (mehn-zehh) (duty-free) only if you bring 
less than a certain amount or quantity of the item with you. Be familiar with 
the following questions and phrases to breeze through customs:
	
✓	あそこで税金を払ってください。 Asoko de zeikin o haratte kudasai. 
(ah-soh-koh deh zehh-keen oh hah-raht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Pay the tax 
over there, please.)
	
✓	身の回りのものです。 Minomawari no mono desu. (mee-noh-mah-wah-
ree noh moh-noh deh-soo.) (They’re my personal belongings.)
	
✓	申告するものはありませんか。 Shinkoku suru mono wa arimasen ka. 
(sheen-koh-koo soo-roo moh-noh wah ah-ree-mah-sehn kah.) (Is there 
anything you want to declare?)
You may be asked to Sūtsukēsu o akete kudasai. (sooo-tsoo-kehh-soo oh ah-
keh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Open your suitcase, please.), so you want to be able 
to conjugate the ru-verb akeru (ah-keh-roo) (to open):

Leaving the airport
When you’re done at customs, grab your bags, pass through the exit, and 
go to the tōchaku robī (tohh-chah-koo roh-beee) (arrival gate). You may see 
hundreds of faces looking at you, which can make you feel like you’re either 
a movie star or a terrible criminal. Most of these people are just looking for 
their friends and relatives, not you, so don’t get too excited.
If no one is meeting you, you can find ground transportation information at 
the chiketto kauntā (chee-keht-toh kah-oon-tahh) (ticket counter) or annaijo 
(ahn-nah-ee-joh) (information counter). You can use questions like the follow­
ing to arrange your transportation from the airport or any other location:
	
✓	モノレールはどこで乗れますか。 Monorēru wa doko de noremasu ka. 
(moh-noh-rehh-roo wah doh-koh deh noh-reh-mah-soo kah.) (Where can 
I catch the monorail?)
	
✓	東京まで成田エクスプレスでいくらかかりますか。 Tōkyō made Narita 
Ekusupuresu de ikura kakarimasu ka. (tohh-kyohh mah-deh nah-ree-tah 

264
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
ehk-koo-soo-poo-reh-soo deh ee-koo-rah kah-kah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (How 
much does it cost to go to Tokyo by the Narita Express?)
	
✓	品川行きのリムジンバスはありますか。 Shinagawa yuki no rimujin 
basu wa arimasu ka. (shee-nah-gah-wah yoo-kee noh ree-moo-jeen 
bah-soo wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you have a limousine bus to 
Shinagawa?)
	
✓	次の東京駅行きのリムジンバスは何時ですか。 Tsugi no Tōkyō eki yuki 
no rimujin basu wa nan-ji desu ka. (tsoo-gee noh tohh-kyohh eh-kee 
yoo-kee noh ree-moo-jeen bah-soo wah nahn-jee deh-soo kah.) (What 
time is the next limousine bus bound for Tokyo Station?)
All Aboard: Hopping on a Train or Boat
Trains and boats are some of the oldest methods of transportation — at least 
since people quit using chariots — but they’re still popular in the modern 
world. The following sections give you the terminology you need to talk 
about these rides in Japanese. (Sorry, I ran out of room to add a section on 
chariots.)
Now entering the station: Riding the train
Traveling by densha (dehn-shah) (train) is special because you go through 
many eki (eh-kee) (train stations), each of which represents the people who 
live or work in that town. In some eki, you see many businesspeople, but in 
others you see mostly children and their moms.
Check the direction of your train:
	
✓	下り電車 kudari densha (koo-dah-ree dehn-shah) (down train)
	
✓	上り電車 nobori densha (noh-boh-ree dehn-shah) (up train)
	
✓	大阪行き Ōsaka yuki (ohh-sah-kah yoo-kee) (bound for Osaka)
	
You may be asking yourself, “What in the world are up trains and down 
trains?” You’re in luck; I have the answer. Nobori densha (up train) refers to 
any train in Japan traveling toward Tokyo, and kudari densha (down train) 
refers to any train traveling away from Tokyo. Tokyo really is the center of 
Japan, as a glance at a map of Japan shows you. Note: These strange terms 
may give you the impression that Tokyo is the highest point in Japan and that 
the farthest location from Tokyo must therefore be below sea level. But the 
allusion to altitude is only figurative, even if somewhat elitist on the part of 
Tokyo. The point of using these two terms is just to distinguish the directions 
of each railroad line, not the altitude.

265
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
When you take a train, make sure you know what time it leaves and arrives. 
Conjugate the verb deru (deh-roo) (to leave) and tsuku (tsoo-koo) (to arrive). 
Deru is a ru-verb, but tsuku is an u-verb.

Remember to check the jikokuhyō (jee-koh-koo-hyohh) (timetable) at the 
station. Be ready for the 24-hour system if you’re traveling in Japan. Jūgo-ji 
(jooo-goh-jee) (15:00 [fifteen o’clock]) means gogo 3-ji (goh-goh sahn-jee) 
(3:00 p.m.). Watch out for two important keywords on the timetable: hatsu 
(hah-tsoo) (departure) and chaku (chah-koo) (arrival). They’re short forms of 
hassha suru (hahs-shah soo-roo) (to depart) and tōchaku suru (tohh-chah-koo 
soo-roo) (to arrive). Take a look at a few examples (for complete coverage on 
telling time, check out Chapter 5):
１６時１５分発 16-ji 15-fun hatsu (jooo-roh-koo-jee jooo-goh-foon hah-

Depending on how much of a hurry you’re in, choose from one of these types 
of trains, listed in descending order of speed and distance:
	
✓	新幹線 shinkansen (sheen-kahn-sehn) (bullet train)
	
✓	特急 tokkyū (tohk-kyooo) (super-express)
	
✓	快速 kaisoku (kah-ee-soh-koo) (rapid)
	
✓	急行 kyūkō (kyooo-kohh) (express)
	
✓	普通 futsū (foo-tsooo) (regular or local)

266
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
	
Shinkansen got its English name, bullet train, from the bullet shape of the lead 
car in the 0 series, or first generation, of the train. These trains run on special 
tracks at top speeds of about 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour) 
and connect all the major cities of Honshū (hohn-shooo), the main island of 
Japan. Shinkansen service is also available to a number of cities in Kyushu. 
Lines connecting parts of Hokkaido are under construction.
For all trains, the unchin (oon-cheen) (fare) is different for adults and chil­
dren. Be sure to specify the number of adults and the number of children 
when buying your tickets. And ask whether discounts and special assistance 
are available for seniors and handicapped people.
Use the counter -mai to express the number of tickets you want to purchase. 
(See Chapter 5 for information on counters.) Also specify whether you need 
a round-trip or one-way ticket. If you’re taking the shinkansen or another 
super-express train in Japan, you need to buy two tickets: a super-express 
ticket plus the regular passenger ticket. Here are some common ticket terms:
	
✓	乗車券 jōshaken (johh-shah-kehn) (passenger ticket)
	
✓	片道 katamichi (kah-tah-mee-chee) (one-way ticket)
	
✓	切符 kippu (keep-poo) (tickets)
	
✓	往復 ōfuku (ohh-foo-koo) (round-trip ticket)
	
✓	特急券 tokkyūken (tohk-kyooo-kehn) (super-express ticket)
You may make a request like the following as you purchase your ticket:
	
✓	名古屋まで大人３枚往復お願いします。 Nagoya made otona san-mai 
Ōfuku onegaishimasu. (nah-goh-yah mah-deh oh-toh-nah sahn-mah-ee 
ohh-foo-koo oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (To Nagoya, three round-trip 
tickets for adults, please.)
	
✓	大阪まで大人１枚子ども２枚お願いします。 Ōsaka made otona ichi-mai 
to kodomo ni-mai onegaishimasu. (ohh-sah-kah mah-deh oh-toh-nah ee-
chee-mah-ee toh koh-doh-moh nee-mah-ee oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) 
(To Osaka, one ticket for an adult and two tickets for children, please.)
	
✓	東京まで片道１枚。 Tōkyō made katamichi ichi-mai. (tohh-kyohh mah-
deh kah-tah-mee-chee ee-chee-mah-ee.) (To Tokyo, one one-way ticket, 
please.)
	
✓	東京までの乗車券と特急券を下さい。 Tōkyō made no jōshaken to 
tokkyūken o kudasai. (tohh-kyohh mah-deh noh johh-shah-kehn toh 
tohk-kyooo-kehn oh koo-dah-sah-ee) (A passenger ticket and a super-
express ticket to Tokyo, please.)

267
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
Find out which hōmu (hohh-moo) (platform) you’re leaving from, say the 
number with the counter -ban (bahn), and add hōmu, as in ichi-ban hōmu 
(ee-chee-bahn hohh-moo) (platform one), ni-ban hōmu (nee-bahn hohh-moo) 
(platform two), and san-ban hōmu (sahn-bahn hohh-moo) (platform three).
Setting sail: Cruising around by boat
You may have a lot of chances to go to nearby islands or to towns across a 
lake, bay, or cove near your home. Some people even commute to work by 
ferry. What a romantic way to start the workday! Use some of the following 
terms to travel by water or just to have fun:
	
✓	ボート bōto (bohh-toh) (boat)
	
✓	フェリー ferī (feh-reee) (ferry)
	
✓	船 fune (foo-neh) (ship)
	
✓	ヨット yotto (yoht-toh) (yacht)
If you don’t know how to swim, find the life jackets right after you board. I’m 
just kidding. Relax and enjoy the nice breeze. If you spend some time on the 
water, you’ll come ashore feeling refreshed!
Conquering Public Transportation
Sometimes the best way of getting around in larger cities, is to take public 
transportation. Whether you intend to travel by basu (bah-soo) (bus), chika­
tetsu (chee-kah-teh-tsoo) (subway), or takushī (tah-koo-sheee) (taxi), the next 
sections have you covered.
	
When you make up your mind about which form of public transportation 
you want to use, say ni suru (nee soo-roo) (to decide on). The verb suru is an 
irregular verb, and its polite counterpart is shimasu. Now you can understand 
the following decisions:
	
✓	地下鉄にします。 Chikatetsu ni shimasu. (chee-kah-teh-tsoo nee shee-
mah-soo.) (I’ll choose the subway.)
	
✓	タクシーにします。 Takushī ni shimasu. (tah-koo-sheee nee shee-mah-
soo.) (I’ll take a taxi.)

268
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Riding a bus
Basu (bah-soo) (buses) are inexpensive and convenient, and they can take 
you across town or across the country. Taking a long-distance bus rather 
than a plane or train can save you a lot of money.
Go to a bus terminal or a bus stop, and find out which basu you should take. 
The unchin (oon-cheen) (fare) may be a flat rate, or it may vary depending 
on how far you go. Either way, put the unchin in the designated box. Here’s 
how to conjugate the ru-verb ireru (ee-reh-roo) (to put).
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
入れる
ireru
ee-reh-roo
入れない
irenai
ee-reh-nah-ee
入れ（ます）
ire(masu)
ee-reh(-mah-soo)
入れて
irete
ee-reh-teh
I also recommend memorizing the following words:
	
✓	バスターミナル basu tāminaru (bah-soo tahh-mee-nah-roo) (bus terminal)
	
✓	バス停 basu-tei (bah-soo-tehh) (bus stop)
	
✓	乗り換え norikae (noh-ree-kah-eh) (transfer)
	
Don’t forget to ask the driver for a transfer if you need to change buses.
Taking the subway
The chikatetsu (chee-kah-teh-tsoo) (subway) is inexpensive, especially com­
pared to taking a taxi. It can also bring you to your destination much more 
quickly than a bus can. Considering all these factors, the chikatetsu may offer 
you the most convenience for your dollar.
When you take a subway, be careful not to miss your station. To express 
which station is yours — hito-tsu-me (hee-toh-tsoo-meh) (the first one), futa-
tsu-me (foo-tah-tsoo-meh) (the second one), and so on — head to the discus­
sion of ordinal numbers in Chapter 5 and use the ordinal counter -me.
Hailing a taxi
Takushī (tah-koo-sheee) (taxis) are very convenient — they come to where 
you are, so you don’t need to walk anywhere. Unlike subways, you don’t need 
to figure out which one you should take. And unlike buses, you don’t need 

269
 Chapter 16: Making Your Way Around: Planes, Trains, Taxis, and More
to wait for them. Just call a taxi to pick you up wherever you are. If you have 
three or four people in your group, taking a takushī may be cheaper than 
taking a train or a bus!
Here are some phrases you may say or hear in a taxi:
	
✓	美術館までお願いします。 Bijutsukan made onegai shimasu. (bee-joo-
tsoo-kahn mah-deh oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Please go to the art 
museum.)
	
✓	どちらまで。 Dochira made. (doh-chee-rah mah-deh.) (To where?)
	
✓	空港までいくらぐらいかかりますか。 Kūkō made ikura gurai kakari­
masu ka. (kooo-kohh mah-deh ee-koo-rah goo-rah-ee kah-kah-ree-mah-
soo kah.) (How much does it cost to the airport?)
	
✓	着きましたよ。 Tsukimashita yo. (tsoo-kee-mah-shee-tah yoh.) (We’re 
here.)
	
When the takushī driver is about to give you the otsuri (oh-tsoo-ree) (change), 
you can refuse it by saying Otsuri wa kekkō desu (oh-tsoo-ree wah kehk-kohh 
deh-soo) (Please keep the change.). Kekkō desu (kehk-kohh deh-soo) means 
good or fine in some contexts, but it means no thank you in other contexts. 
It may sound like a contradiction, but in English you sometimes say I’m fine. 
after being asked Would you like some coffee? when what you mean is no thank 
you, right? That’s the spirit of kekkō desu as no thank you. 
Talkin’ the Talk

Driving Around
In smaller communities, driving a kuruma (koo-roo-mah) (car) may be your 
only option for getting around. (And even in bigger communities, you may 
just prefer to drive.) To talk about driving in Japanese, use unten suru (oon-
tehn soo-roo) (to drive). Conjugating this verb is a piece of cake if you know 
how to conjugate the irregular verb suru (soo-roo) (to do).

If you’re on a trip and you didn’t drive to your destination, you’ll need to rent 
a car. And if you’re driving in Japan, you’ll need a crash course in Japanese 
road signs. The following sections give you the necessary vocabulary for 
renting a vehicle and provide an overview of the most important road signs.
	
Driving a car in Japan is a bit tricky. You have to drive on the left side, and your 
steering wheel is on the right side. The roads are clean and nice but very narrow. 
Bicycles and pedestrians always have the right of way on the neighborhood 
streets. And the highways are in great condition, but the tolls are outrageous.
Renting a car
To rent a kuruma, head to a rentakā shoppu (rehn-tah-kahh shohp-poo) (car 
rental shop). Be sure to ask about the rental car’s features:
	
✓	エアコン eakon (eh-ah-kohn) (air conditioning)
	
✓	カーナビ kānabi (kahh-nah-bee) (car navigation, GPS)
	
✓	マニュアル manyuaru (mah-nyoo-ah-roo) (stick shift)
	
✓	オートマチック ōtomachikku (ohh-toh-mah-cheek-koo) (automatic 
transmission)
	
✓	ステレオ sutereo (soo-teh-reh-oh) (stereo)

272
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Show your unten menkyoshō (oon-tehn-mehn-kyoh-shohh) (driver’s license) 
to the clerk at the car-rental agency. Note that you need a kokusai unten 
menkyoshō (koh-koo-sah-ee oon-tehn mehn-kyoh-shohh) (international driv­
ing permit) in addition to your driver’s license from your home country when 
you drive in Japan, unless you have a Japanese license. After that’s out of the 
way, you can get to the details. Following are some common phrases that you 
may find useful when renting a car:
	
✓	保険をかけます。 Hoken o kakemasu. (hoh-kehn oh kah-keh-mah-soo.) 
(I’ll take the insurance policy.)
	
✓	小型の車を借りたいんですが。 Kogata no kuruma o karitai-n-desu ga. 
(koh-gah-tah noh koo-roo-mah oh kah-ree-tah-een-deh-soo gah.) (I’d like 
to rent a small-size car [but do you have one?].)
	
✓	今日から金曜日まで使いたいんです。 Kyō kara kinyōbi made tsukai-tai-
n-desu. (kyooo kah-rah keen-yohh-bee mah-deh tsoo-kah-ee-tah-een-deh-
soo.) (I want it today through Friday.)
	
✓	木曜日に返します。 Mokuyōbi ni kaeshimasu. (moh-koo-yohh-bee nee 
kah-eh-shee-mah-soo.) (I’ll return it on Thursday.)
Conjugate the verbs kariru (kah-ree-roo) (to rent) and kaesu (kah-eh-soo) (to 
return) — two essential words for visiting a rental-car agency. Kariru is a ru-
verb, and kaesu is an u-verb. The conjugation table for kariru is in Chapter 
15. Here’s the one for kaesu:

The International Driving Permit
国際運転免許証 Kokusai Unten Menkyoshō 
(koh-koo-sah-ee oon-tehn mehn-kyoh-shohh) 
(International Driving Permit) is a document 
recognized by more than 100 countries, 
including Japan and the United States. It’s 
supplemental to your official government-
issued license and serves translation and 
identification purposes, so you must also carry 
your driver’s license from your home country 
when you use it.
Note that Kokusai Unten Menkyoshō is only 
for short-term travelers. If you want to stay in 
Japan longer term, you need to convert your 
license from your home country to a Japanese 
license.

Are you ready to drive in Japan? Here are a couple of final reminders: In 
Japan, left turns on a red light aren’t permitted like right turns on red lights 
are in the United States. Also, keep in mind that the colors of the traffic lights 
in Japan are the same, but they call the three colors red, yellow, and blue 
(rather than red, yellow, and green like in the United States).

electing the right shukuhaku shisetsu (shoo-koo-hah-koo shee-seh-tsoo) 
(accommodations) can make any trip you take more enjoyable. After all, 
each day of your adventure starts and ends there. This chapter walks you

Picking the Right Accommodations 
for Your Needs
Select your accommodations according to your needs and budget. For exam­
ple, if you’re planning a family trip to a resort area near the coast, get a nice 
hoteru (hoh-teh-roo) (hotel) that features easy access to the beach. Here are 
the many options available to you:
	
✓	ビジネスホテル bijinesu hoteru (bee-jee-neh-soo hoh-teh-roo) (business 
hotel)
	
✓	ホテル hoteru (hoh-teh-roo) (hotel)
	
✓	観光ホテル kankō hoteru (kahn-kohh hoh-teh-roo) (tourist’s hotel)
	
✓	カプセルホテル kapuseru hoteru (kah-poo-seh-roo hoh-teh-roo) (capsule 
hotel)

✓	民宿 minshuku (meen-shoo-koo) (a private home that offers lodging and 
meals to tourists)
	
✓	モーテル mōteru (mohh-teh-roo) (motel)
	
✓	旅館 ryokan (ryoh-kahn) (Japanese-style inn)
	
✓	ユースホステル yūsu hosuteru (yooo-soo hoh-soo-teh-roo) (youth hostel)
	
A hoteru is a Western-style hotel. You can speak English in most major hoteru 
in Japan. You can also eat a Western-style breakfast, sleep on a bed rather 
than a futon (foo-tohn) (thin, quilted mattress), and use a Western-style bath. 
(Flip to Chapter 6 for info on the traditional Japanese futon sleeping experi­
ence.) These amenities may be familiar to you and put you at ease. If you 
prefer to stay even more inside your comfort zone, you may want to stay at a 
property owned by a well-known hotel chain.
For more-authentic, Japanese-style accommodations, go to a ryokan. At 
the entrance to the inn, a nakai-san (nah-kah-ee-sahn) (maid) in a kimono 
welcomes you. Enjoy a big bath with other guests if you aren’t shy (see the 
nearby sidebar on Japanese-style bathing). When you get back to your room 
for the evening, the futon is already spread out on the tatami (tah-tah-mee) 
(straw mat) floor in your bedroom, and dinner is brought right to the living/
dining area of your room. Wear a special kimono-like cotton robe, a yukata 
(yoo-kah-tah), while you enjoy your dinner. In the morning, have a Japanese-
style breakfast (turn to Chapter 6 for examples of these dishes).
A minshuku is similar to a bed-and-breakfast in Western countries, but it 
often provides dinner as well as breakfast. All the minshuku guests eat their 
meals together in a big dining room with a tatami floor. Each guest has to 
spread out her own futon when she sleeps and fold it up again in the morn­
ing. It’s like visiting your uncle’s or aunt’s big house in the countryside. 
If you’re young and your budget is very tight (or does that go without 
saying?), you can stay in a yūsu hosuteru. You have to share a room and/or 
a bathroom with other travelers and follow the hostel’s strict rules, but you 
can save your money for another part of your trip.
If you just need to stay somewhere for your business trip, opt for bijinesu 
hoteru. Their rooms are simple but neat, relatively comfortable, very func­
tional, and convenient for businesspeople. If you need a much cheaper hotel 
than business hotels in major business cities in Japan, you can stay in a 
unique, interesting, super-simple hotel called kapuseru hoteru. Each room 
is just as big as a single bed; one person can barely stand up in it. You can 
think of these hotels as beehives. Each room has a TV and a radio. The hotel 
has a sauna on some floor of the building that can be shared by guests. The 
capsule hotels charge very little; they’re mostly used by male office workers, 
who tend to work late and often miss the last train of the day. In fact, many 
capsule hotels are for men only.

Of course, all of these accommodation options will fulfill your most basic 
need: They’ll all provide you with a place to sleep! Here’s how to conjugate 
the ru-verb neru (neh-roo) (to sleep).

Narrowing Your Choice Further
After you know the type of accommodations you’re interested in, you can 
start looking into specific places. Consider the size of the rooms, the various 
amenities offered, and the overall cost to help you make your decision. The 
following sections help you do just that, in addition to helping you figure out 
how to express possible scenarios with if.
Looking into room size and amenities
Ask the folks at the front desk about the types of heya (heh-yah) (rooms) 
the hotel has. Suppose you’re traveling with your mother, spouse, and two 
Bathing Japanese-style
A Japanese bath is very different from a 
Western-style bath. A Japanese bathtub is very 
deep, and the water is very hot. The bath is only 
for soaking and relaxing; washing your body, 
face, or hair in the bath is taboo. You wash 
yourself outside the tub, in a space with fau­
cets, showers, and mirrors on the wall where 
you can sit on a low stool as you wash. Entering 
the bath prior to washing and rinsing your body 
is considered a major breach of etiquette.
Public baths are everywhere in Japan, although 
they are separated by gender. In a Japanese 
public bath, you have to get completely naked. 
No swimsuits. Stripping down around strangers 
may be a bit embarrassing, but you don’t know 
any of the other people, so what the heck? Go 
for it! The tub in a public bath is huge — it’s 
like a giant hot tub (but it’s not a heated swim­
ming pool, so don’t plan on taking a few laps). 
And come out of the tub every 15 minutes or so; 
otherwise, you’ll become a dizzy octopus from 
the heat.

teenage children. Would you prefer to get a big room that everyone can stay 
in together, or do you want a separate room for your kids and mom? (I know 
what my answer would be.) Is anyone in your family a heavy snorer? You 
need a good night’s sleep to have some energy for your trip, so you may want 
to consider multiple smaller rooms (or just bring earplugs). Here’s the vocab­
ulary you need to talk about room sizes:
	
✓	ダブル daburu (dah-boo-roo) (double)
	
✓	セミダブル semi-daburu (seh-mee-dah-boo-roo) (semi-double/a room 
with a full-size bed)
	
✓	シングル shinguru (sheen-goo-roo) (single)
	
✓	ツイン tsuin (tsoo-een) (twin)
If you’re not sure whether a twin room is bigger than a double room, just ask 
Dochira no heya ga hiroi desu ka. (doh-chee-rah noh heh-yah gah hee-roh-
ee deh-soo kah.) (Which room is bigger?) Expect to hear this line in response: 
Tsuin no heya ga hiroi desu. (tsoo-een noh heh-yah gah hee-roh-ee deh-soo.) 
(A twin room is bigger.) (For more info on using dochira [which one] and 
making other comparisons, see Chapter 10.)
	
Ask whether the place you’re interested in staying at has the following amenities:
	
✓	売店 baiten (bah-ee-tehn) (shop)
	
✓	ビジネスセンター bijinesu sentā (bee-jee-neh-soo sehn-tahh) (business 
center)
	
✓	駐車場 chūshajō (chooo-shah-johh) (parking lot)
	
✓	ジム gimu (gee-moo) (gym)
	
✓	インターネット intānetto (een-tahh-neht-toh) (Internet)
	
✓	自動販売機 jidōhanbaiki (jee-dohh-hahn-bah-ee-kee) (vending machine)
	
✓	金庫 kinko (keen-koh) (safe)
	
✓	無線ＬＡＮ musen LAN (moo-sehn rahn) (wireless LAN [local area 
network])
	
✓	プール pūru (pooo-roo) (swimming pool)
	
✓	冷蔵庫 reizōko (rehh-zohh-koh) (refrigerator)
	
✓	レストラン resutoran (reh-soo-toh-rahn) (restaurant)
Also ask about any service you may need during your stay. Popular services 
include
	
✓	マッサージ massāji (mahs-sahh-jee) (massage)
	
✓	モーニングコール mōningu kōru (mohh-neen-goo kohh-roo) (wake-up 
call)

279
 Chapter 17: Finding a Place to Stay
	
✓	ランドリーサービス randorī sābisu (rahn-doh-reee sahh-bee-soo) (laun­
dry service)
	
✓	ルームサービス rūmu sābisu (rooo-moo sahh-bee-soo) (room service)
If you have a special request, ask for it when you make a reservation. For 
example:
	
✓	広い部屋はありますか。 Hiroi heya wa arimasu ka. (hee-roh-ee heh-yah 
wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Do you have a spacious room?)
	
✓	喫煙ルームですか。 Kitsuen rūmu desu ka. (kee-tsoo-ehn rooo-moo deh-
soo kah.) (Is it a smoking room?)
	
✓	禁煙の部屋ですか。 Kin’en no heya desu ka. (keen-ehn noh heh-yah 
deh-soo kah.) (Is it a nonsmoking room?)
	
✓	静かな部屋をお願いします。 Shizuka na heya o onegai shimasu. (shee-
zoo-kah nah heh-yah oh oh-neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (A quiet room, 
please.)
	
✓	冷蔵庫のある部屋がいいんですが。 Reizōko no aru heya ga ii n desu 
ga. (rehh-zohh-koh noh ah-roo hey-yah gah een-deh-soo gah.) (I prefer a 
room with a refrigerator.)
	
✓	スイートをお願いします。 Suīto o onegai shimasu. (soo-eee-toh oh oh-
neh-gah-ee shee-mah-soo.) (Suite, please.)
Comparing costs
Cost is a major criterion when you choose a hotel. Suppose one hotel charges 
you $150 per day, and another hotel charges you $200 per day. That $50 dif­
ference may seem small, but if you’re staying for ten days, the difference 
becomes $500. That’s quite a bit of money. (Note that most Japanese hotels 
charge for each person even if multiple people share one room, so watch 
out!) Figuring out the total cost isn’t always simple, but talking about it in 
Japanese can be with the info in this section. I show you how to compare 
prices, how to express concepts like twice and three times as expensive, and 
how to express percentages.
Chapter 10 shows you in detail how to use the particle yori (yoh-ree) (than). 
You can use that same particle to compare your accommodation options. 
For example, Yūsu hosuteru wa yasui desu. (yooo-soo-hoh-soo-teh-roo wah 
yah-soo-ee deh-soo.) means Youth hostels are cheap. If you want to say Youth 
hostels are cheaper than hotels., just stick in hoteru yori (hoh-teh-roo yoh-
ree) (than hotels) right before the adjective yasui desu. So Yūsu hosuteru wa 
hoteru yori yasui desu. (yooo-soo hoh-soo-teh-roo wah hoh-teh-roo yoh-ree 
yah-soo-ee deh-soo.) means Youth hostels are cheaper than hotels.

280
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
	
To make a comparison by saying that something is a number of times more 
(or less) than something else, use the counter -bai (bah-ee). For example, to 
say Japanese-style inns are three times more expensive than youth hostels., say 
Ryokan wa yūsu hosuteru yori san-bai takai desu. (ryoh-kahn wah yooo-soo 
hoh-soo-teh-roo yoh-ree sahn-bah-ee tah-kah-ee deh-soo.). Following are the 
possible counters you may want to use when comparing hotel costs:
	
✓	２倍 ni-bai (nee-bah-ee) (twice)
	
✓	３倍 san-bai (sahn-bah-ee) (three times)
	
✓	３.５倍 san-ten-go-bai (sahn-tehn-goh-bah-ee) (three and a half times)
	
✓	４倍 yon-bai (yohn-bah-ee) (four times)
	
✓	５倍 go-bai (goh-bah-ee) (five times)
And here’s one more convenient phrase that you can use when you com­
pare prices. To express percentages, use the counter -pāsento (pahh-sehn-
toh) (percent). For example, to say Canadian hotels are 25 percent cheaper 
than American hotels., say Kanada no hoteru wa Amerika no hoteru yori 
25-pāsento yasui desu. (kah-nah-dah noh hoh-teh-roo wah ah-meh-ree-kah 
noh hoh-teh-roo yoh-ree nee-jooo-goh-pahh-sehn-toh yah-soo-ee deh-soo.). 
You can also use the same percentage symbol (%) in Japanese as you do 
in English, as you can see in the following list of percentages you may find 
handy to use in your comparisons of different accommodation costs.
	
✓	１０％ jūp-pāsento (joop-pahh-sehn-toh) (10 percent)
	
✓	１５％ jū-go-pāsento (jooo-goh-pahh-sehn-toh) (15 percent)
	
✓	２０％ ni-jūp-pāsento (nee-joop-pahh-sehn-toh) (20 percent)
	
✓	１００％ hyaku-pāsento (hyah-koo-pahh-sehn-toh) (100 percent)
Considering each possible 
scenario with nara
You have to think about so many different possibilities when you’re planning 
your trip accommodations, such as “If Bob and Sue come, we’ll need to get an 
extra room.” or “We can save $100 if we go in May rather than June.” One way 
to express these hypothetical scenarios in Japanese is to use nara (nah-rah) 
to mean if.
	
You can add nara at the end of a verb or an adjective in the plain/informal 
form, except that the linking da (the plain present affirmative form of desu) 
that directly follows a noun or a na-type adjective must drop. Check out the 
following examples.

281
 Chapter 17: Finding a Place to Stay
日本に行くなら旅館に泊まりましょう。 Nihon ni iku nara ryokan ni 
tomarimashō. (nee-hohn nee ee-koo nah-rah ryoh-kahn nee toh-mah-ree-
mah-shohh.) (Let’s stay at a Japanese-style inn if we’re going to Japan.)
安いなら泊まります。 Yasui nara tomarimasu. (yah-soo-ee nah-rah toh-
mah-ree-mah-soo.) (If it’s cheap, I’ll stay there.)
観光なら京都がいいですよ。 Kankō nara Kyōto ga ii desu yo. (kahn-
kohh nah-rah kyohh-toh gah eee deh-soo yoh.) (If you’re interested in 
sightseeing, Kyoto is good. [Literally: If for sightseeing, Kyoto is good.])
買い物が好きなら新宿がいいですよ。 Kaimono ga suki nara Shinjuku ga 
ii desu yo. (kah-ee-moh-noh gah soo-kee nah-rah sheen-joo-koo gah eee 
deh-soo yoh.) (If you like shopping, Shinjuku is a great place for you.)
朝食が付くならこのホテルにしましょう。 Chōshoku ga tsuku nara kono 
hoteru ni shimashō. (chohh-shoh-koo gah tsoo-koo nah-rah koh-noh hoh-
teh-roo nee shee-mah-shohh.) (If breakfast is included, let’s stay in this hotel.)
お金がないならカプセルホテルに泊まった方がいいですよ。 O-kane ga 
nai nara kapuseru hoteru ni tomatta hō ga ii desu yo. (oh-kah-neh gah 
nah-ee nah-rah kah-poo-seh-roo hoh-teh-roo nee toh-maht-tah hohh gah eee 
deh-soo yoh.) (If you don’t have money, you’d better stay at capsule hotels.)
	
The final example in the preceding list gives advice by using the past tense 
and the phrase hō ga ii desu. Refer to Chapter 18 for more details about hō ga 
ii desu.
Making a Room Reservation
	
Japanese doesn’t have simple verbs that mean to plan or to make a reserva­
tion. To say to plan and to make a reservation, you combine the verb suru 
(soo-roo) (to do) with a noun — keikaku (kehh-kah-koo) (plan) and yoyaku 
(yoh-yah-koo) (reservation). So keikaku suru means to plan, and yoyaku suru 
means to make a reservation. You simply conjugate the suru part of the verb. 
Suru is an irregular verb; I conjugate it for you in Chapter 13.
Before calling a hotel to make a reservation, you need to have a clear idea of 
how long you’re planning to stay. To start, conjugate the u-verb tomaru (to 
stay).

Part III: Japanese on the Go 
	
Remember to use the particles kara (kah-rah) (from) and made (mah-deh) 
(until) to talk about the duration of your visit. Kara and made look like English 
prepositions, but they have to follow, not precede, the relevant phrases. For 
example, from the 15th in English is the 15th from in Japanese. And until the 
23rd in English is the 23rd until in Japanese. So you now know 15-nichi kara 
(jooo-goh-nee-chee kah-rah) means from the 15th, and 23-nichi made (nee-
jooo-sahn-nee-chee mah-deh) means until the 23rd. Take a look at a few more 
examples to really help this tidbit sink in:
来週の月曜日から木曜日までお願いします。 Raishū no getsuyōbi kara 
mokuyūbi made onegaishimasu. (rah-ee-shooo noh geh-tsoo-yohh-bee 
kah-rah moh-koo-yohh-bee mah-deh oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mah-soo.) (From 
Monday to Thursday of next week, please.)
このコースは6月から8月までです。 Kono kōsu wa roku-gatsu kara 
hachi-gatsu made desu. (koh-noh kohh-soo wah roh-koo-gah-tsoo kah-rah 
hah-chee-gah-tsoo mah-deh deh-soo.) (This course is from June to August.)
今日からあさってまで泊まります。 Kyō kara asatte made tomarimasu. 
(kyohh kah-rah ah-saht-teh mah-deh toh-mah-ree-mah-soo.) (I’ll stay from 
today until the day after tomorrow.)
Use the counter -haku (hah-koo) to specify the number of nights that you’re 
staying. -haku is the counter for nights that one stays outside of his or her 
home. Some numbers use -paku (pah-koo), though, so remember to watch 
out for the -haku/-paku alternation. You may not like it, but you just have to 
memorize it.
	
✓	一泊 ip-paku (eep-pah-koo) (one night)
	
✓	二泊 ni-haku (nee-hah-koo) (two nights)
	
✓	三泊 san-paku (sahn-pah-koo) (three nights)
	
✓	四泊 yon-haku (yohn-hah-koo) (four nights)
	
✓	五泊 go-haku (goh-hah-koo) (five nights)
	
✓	六泊 rop-paku (rohp-pah-koo) (six nights)
Checking In
As soon as you arrive at a hotel, a bōi-san (bohh-ee-sahn) (bellhop) helps you 
with your baggage. (If you’re in Japan, you don’t need to tip him. Isn’t that 
amazing?) Go to the furonto (foo-rohn-toh) (front desk).

283
 Chapter 17: Finding a Place to Stay
	
If you don’t have a yoyaku (yoh-yah-koo) (reservation), ask whether a kūshitsu 
(koo-shee-tsoo) (vacant room) is available.
	
✓	予約はしませんでしたが, 空室はありますか。 Yoyaku wa shimasen 
deshita ga, kūshitsu wa arimasu ka. (yoh-yah-koo wah shee-mah-sehn 
deh-shee-tah gah, kooo-shee-tsoo wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (I didn’t 
make a reservation, but do you have any vacancy?)
	
✓	今日泊まりたいんですが, 部屋は空いていますか。 Kyō tomaritai-n-desu 
ga, heya wa aite imasu ka. (kyohh toh-mah-ree-tah-een-deh-soo gah, 
heh-yah wah ah-ee-teh ee-mah-soo kah.) (I’d like to stay here tonight, but 
do you have a vacancy?)
You may hear one of the following statements in reply:
	
✓	申し訳ございません。只今, 空室はございません。 Mōshiwake gozaimasen. 
Tadaima, kūshitsu wa gozaimasen. (mohh-shee-wah-keh goh-zah-ee-
mah-sehn. tah-dah-ee-mah, kooo-shee-tsoo wah goh-zah-ee-mah-sehn.) 
(I’m terribly sorry. We don’t have any vacancy now.)
	
✓	今日は満室です。 Kyō wa manshitsu desu. (kyohh wah mahn-shee-tsoo 
deh-soo.) (No vacancy tonight.)
	
✓	シングルの部屋がございます。 Shinguru no heya ga gozaimasu. (sheen-
goo-roo noh heh-yah gah goh-zah-ee-mah-soo.) (There’s a single room.)
If you have a reservation or the hotel has a vacancy, check in! Hotel clerks 
are trained to speak very politely. Before they find out your namae (nah-mah-
eh) (name), they address you as okyaku-sama (oh-kyah-koo-sah-mah), which 
literally means something along the lines of Mr./Ms./Mrs. Customer. After they 
learn your name, they address you with your last name followed by -sama 
(sah-mah) (Mr./Ms./Mrs.), which is the super-polite, businesslike version of 
-san (sahn). (Note that they never address you as anata [ah-nah-tah] [you]; 
for the scoop on anata, see Chapter 3.) Next, they ask you for your jūsho 
(jooo-shoh) (address) and denwa-bangō (dehn-wah-bahn-gohh) (telephone 
number). You know they’re asking for your information because they add a 
polite prefix o- or go- before these words. (See Chapters 4 and 12 for more on 
the prefixes o- and go-, respectively.). So they may say something like one of 
the following:
お客様のお名前は。 O-kyaku-sama no o-namae wa. (oh-kyah-koo-sah-
mah noh oh-nah-mah-eh wah.) (Your name?)
ご住所は。 Go-jūsho wa. (goh-jooo-sho wah.) (Your address?)
ご自宅のお電話番号は。 Go-jitaku no o-denwa bangō wa. (goh-jee-tah-
koo noh oh-dehn-wah bahn-gohh wah.) (Your home telephone number?)

284
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
After that process is complete, get your room number and the kagi (kah-gee) 
(key) or kādo kī (kahh-doh keee) (key card) for your room to complete the 
check-in. The clerk tells you which floor your room is on by using a numeral 
plus the counter -kai (see Chapter 10 for full details on the counter -kai). So the 
clerk may say something like the following:
	
✓	７階の７０５号室でございます。 Nana-kai no nanahyaku-go-gōshitsu de 
gozaimasu. (nah-nah-kah-ee noh nah-nah-hyah-koo-goh-gohh-shee-tsoo 
deh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo.) (Your room is Room 705 on the seventh floor.)
	
✓	こちらがカードキーでございます。 Kochira ga kādo kī de gozaimasu. 
(koh-chee-rah gah kahh-doh keee deh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo) (This is your 
key card.)
	
Refer to your room by using a numeral plus the counter -gōshitsu (gohh-shee-
tsoo). Is it 502-gōshitsu (goh-hyah-koo-nee-gohh-shee-tsoo) (Room 502) or 
2502-gōshitsu (nee-sehn-goh-hyah-koo-nee-gohh-shee-tsoo) (Room 2502)?
As you check in, you may want to ask some of the following questions:
	
✓	駐車場はどこですか。 Chūshajō wa doko desu ka. (chooo-shah-johh 
wah doh-koh deh-soo kah.) (Where is the parking garage?)
	
✓	チェックアウトは何時ですか。 Chekku-auto wa nan-ji desu ka. (chehk-
koo-ah-oo-toh wah nahn-jee deh-soo kah.) (When is the check-out time?)
	
✓	朝食は何時からですか。 Chōshoku wa nan-ji kara desu ka. (chohh-
shoh-koo wah nahn-jee kah-rah deh-soo kah.) (What time do you start 
serving breakfast?)
	
✓	朝食は何時までですか。 Chōshoku wa nan-ji made desu ka. (chohh-
shoh-koo wah nahn-jee mah-deh deh-soo kah.) (Until what time do you 
serve breakfast?)

Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Keeping Track of What’s 
Yours during Your Stay
Lots of mix-ups can happen when you’re staying in a big hotel with 300 other 
guests. Keep track of your sūtsukēsu (sooo-tsoo-kehh-soo) (suitcases) and 
kagi (kah-gee) (keys). The following sections show you a couple of ways to 
do just that.
Using possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns allow you to indicate who owns what. To say yours and 
mine in Japanese, take the words that mean you and I and add the particle no 
after them. For example, anata (ah-nah-tah) is you, and anata no (ah-nah-tah 
noh) is yours. How about mine? Watashi (wah-tah-shee) is I, so watashi no 
(wah-tah-shee noh) is mine. Piece of cake, right? Now you can say Watashi 
no desu! (wah-tah-shee noh deh-soo!) (That’s mine!) to someone who is very 
clearly reaching for your keys. Just don’t say Watashi no desu! every time a 
guest touches stuff in your house. You’ll sound like a five-year-old child who 
doesn’t know how to share his toys.
	
Although anata no (yours) is perfectly correct grammatically, you should 
avoid saying it as best you can because the use of anata (you) sounds snobby 
or even rude when used for one’s superiors such as teachers, elders, bosses, 
and customers. Here’s a helpful breakdown of how you can avoid using anata:
	
✓	If you know the person’s name, use the name followed by san rather 
than あなた anata, as in 田中さんのですか。 Tanaka-san no desu ka. 
(tah-nah-kah-sahn noh deh-soo kah.) (Is it yours, Mr. Tanaka?).

✓	If you don’t know the person’s name and he or she is your customer, 
you can use お客様 o-kyaku-sama (oh-kyah-koo-sah-mah), as in お客様の
ですか。 O-kyaku-sama no desu ka. (oh-kyah-koo sah-mah noh deh-soo 
kah.) (Is it yours?).
	
✓	If the stranger is someone who was sitting behind you and you just 
noticed that he left something on the chair, you can say お宅 otaku, as 
in お宅のですか。 Otaku no desu ka. (oh-tah-koo-noh deh-soo kah.) (Is it 
yours?).
	
✓	If you’re addressing a stranger in a relatively informal, friendly context — 
like at a supermarket — you can use family-relative terms such as お姉さん 
onēsan (oh-nehh-sahn) (older sister), おばさん obasan (oh-bah-sahn) 
(aunt), and おばあさん obāsan (oh-bahh-sahn) (grandmother). If the 
stranger is a woman in middle-age, you can address her with obasan. If 
she appears to be old, you can address her with obāsan. However, some 
obāsan believe that they should be addressed with obasan and some 
obasan believe that they should be addressed with onēsan. So I recom­
mend you address the person using the one-level-younger term. Then the 
lady will smile at you. (For additional family terminology, see Chapter 4.)
And luckily, if you know yours and mine in Japanese, you already know your 
and my in Japanese. They’re exactly the same — almost like a buy-one-get-
one-free coupon at the supermarket. If watashi no is followed by a noun, 
such as kagi, it means my: Watashi no kagi desu. (wah-tah-shee noh kah-gee 
deh-soo.) means That’s my key.

Using “uchi” possessively
Even though the word uchi (oo-chee) means house, household, or inside, 
Japanese use uchi no (oo-chee noh) to mean my or our. Here are some exam­
ples of uchi no in action:
うちの社員はよく働きます。 Uchi no shain wa yoku hatarakimasu. (oo-
chee noh shah-een wah yoh-koo hah-tah-rah-kee-mah-soo.) (Our [com­
pany’s] employees work very hard.)

tah-beh-mah-sehn.) (Our children don’t eat vegetables very much.)
うちの庭には桜の木があります。 Uchi no niwa ni wa sakura no ki ga 
arimasu. (oo-chee noh nee-wah nee wah sah-koo-rah noh kee gah ah-ree-

travel agency is located in Nagoya.)
Checking Out
It’s chekku-auto (chehk-koo-ah-oo-toh) (check-out) time! Pack up your stuff 
and don’t forget anything in your room. Go to front desk to chekku-auto and 
pay your bill. You may see some additional charges on your bill, such as the 
following:
	
✓	電話料 denwaryō (dehn-wah-ryohh) (telephone usage charge)
	
✓	飲食料 inshokuryō (een-shoh-koo-ryohh) (food and drink charge)
	
✓	インターネット利用料 intānetto riyōryō (een-tahh-neht-toh ree-yohh-
ryohh) (Internet usage charge)
	
✓	クリーニング代 kurīningudai (koo-reee-neen-goo-dah-ee) (laundry 
charge)
	
✓	税金 zeikin (zehh-keen) (tax)
If you need further assistance from the hotel staff after checking out, just ask 
them.
５時まで荷物を預かってください。 Go-ji made nimotsu o azukatte kuda­

タクシーをよんでくださいませんか。 Takushī o yonde kudasai masen 
ka. (tah-koo-sheee oh yohn-deh koo-dah-sah-ee mah-sehn kah.) (Would 
you mind calling a taxi?)
	
By adding masen ka (mah-sehn kah) at the end of a request, you can make the 
request sound a bit softer and more polite. That is, Takushī o yonde kudasai 
masen ka. sounds much more polite than Takushī o yonde kudasai. Masen is 
just a polite suffix in the negative form, and ka is the question particle. Masen 
ka means something like Wouldn’t you? or Would you mind?

Chapter 18
Handling Emergencies
In This Chapter
▶	Finding help when you need it
▶	Seeking a doctor’s office for diagnosis and treatment
▶	Talking to the police and tackling legal trouble
F

ocusing on all the good things in life (like eating, shopping, having fun, 
and making friends) is great, but knowing what to do when an illness, 
injury, or emergency pops up is important. Handling these situations isn’t a 
big deal when you know the ABCs of emergencies and sickness. This chapter 
provides you with the confidence and the Japanese to act wisely when faced 
with an emergency, whether that emergency is medical or legal.
Asking (Or Shouting!) for Help
The simplest and quickest way to ask for help is to say Tasukete. (tah-soo-
keh-teh.) (Help me.). Tasukete is the te-form of the verb tasukeru (tah-soo-
keh-roo) (to help). It’s in the te-form because it’s the product of omitting 
kudasai (koo-dah-sah-ee) from the complete request sentence Tasukete 
kudasai. (tah-soo-keh-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please help me.). As I explain in 
Chapter 10, you express a request by using a verb in the te-form plus kuda­
sai. Kudasai is a sort of helping verb for expressing a request. In an informal 
context or in an emergency, you can omit it. See Chapter 10 to find out more 
about kudasai.
Conjugate the ru-verb tasukeru.

Part III: Japanese on the Go 
When you’re really in a panic, what should you shout? Just the vowel a (ah)? 
Its longer counterpart ā (aah)? Or maybe its super-long counterpart āāāāā 
(aaaaaaaaaah)? Even a crow can do that. To be more sophisticated than a 
crow, use the following phrases and scream as loudly as possible:
	
✓	だれか！ Dareka! (dah-reh-kah!) (Someone help!)
	
✓	泥棒！ Dorobō! (doh-roh-bohh!) (A thief!)
	
✓	火事！ Kaji! (kah-jee!) (Fire!)
If you see someone who appears to be having a non-life-threatening problem, 
don’t scream. Just ask one of the following questions:
	
✓	だいじょうぶですか。 Daijōbu desu ka. (dah-ee-johh-boo deh-soo kah.) 
(Are you all right?)
	
✓	どうしたんですか。 Dōshita-n-desu ka. (dohh-shee-tahn-deh-soo kah.) 
(What happened?)
	
Be a good person and offer help to those in need. The best way to express 
your helpful intentions is to ask a question that ends in -mashō ka (mah-shohh 
kah) (shall I). -mashō ka follows a verb in the stem form. The stem form of 
yobu (yoh-boo) (to call) is yobi (yoh-bee); therefore, Keisatsu o yobimashō 
ka. (kehh-sah-tsoo oh yoh-bee-mah-shohh kah.) means Shall I call the police? 
Following are some additional examples of -mashō ka in action:
ご家族に電話しましょうか。 Go-kazoku ni denwa shimashō ka. (goh-
kah-zoh-koo nee dehn-wah shee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall I telephone your 
family?)
救急車を呼びましょうか。 Kyūkyūsha o yobimashō ka. (kyooo-kyooo-
shah oh yoh-bee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall I call an ambulance?)
荷物を持ちましょうか。 Nimotsu o mochimashō ka. (nee-moh-tsoo oh 
moh-chee-mah-shohh kah.) (Shall I hold your lugguage?)
運転しましょうか。 Unten shimashō ka. (oon-tehn shee-mah-shohh kah.) 
(Shall I drive?)
If you think you can’t handle a situation alone, ask the people around you 
to help out too. To express your request, use a verb in the te-form and add 
kudasai (koo-dah-sah-ee), as noted earlier in this section. Here are a few 
examples:
ちょっと手伝ってください。 Chotto tetsudatte kudasai. (choht-toh teh-
tsoo-daht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please give me a hand.)
警察に電話してください。 Keisatsu ni denwa shite kudasai. (kehh-sah-
tsoo nee dehn-wah shee-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Phone the police, please.)

293
 Chapter 18: Handling Emergencies
救急車を呼んでください。 Kyūkyūsha o yonde kudasai. (kyooo-kyooo-
shah oh yohn-deh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Call an ambulance, please.)
消防署に電話してください。 Shōbōsho ni denwa shite kudasai. (shohh-
bohh-shoh nee dehn-wah shee-teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please phone the fire 
department.)
Seeking Medical Attention
If you find yourself in need of medical care while in a predominantly 
Japanese-speaking area, you’re going to wish you had a grasp of some basic 
doctor-related terminology. Never fear. The following sections walk you 
through a visit to a doctor’s office or a hospital.
Looking for a doctor
If you happen to get sick in Japan, you may want to see an isha (ee-shah) 
(medical doctor), or more respectfully, o-isha-san (oh-ee-shah-sahn) (medical 
doctor). When you address your doctor, say sensei (sehn-sehh). Sensei works 
as a title not only for teachers but also for doctors, lawyers, and politicians.
Depending on your problem, you may have to find a specialist. One way 
to refer to specialists is to add i (ee) after the name of the specialty. I (ee) 
means a medical doctor, but you can’t use it by itself. It makes sense only if 
you combine it with another word or a meaning unit. For example, ganka 
(gahn-kah) means ophthalmology, and ganka-i (gahn-kah-ee) means ophthal­
mologist. Check out the following list:
	
✓	眼科医 ganka-i (gahn-kah-ee) (eye doctor)
	
✓	皮膚科医 hifuka-i (hee-foo-kah-ee) (dermatologist)
	
✓	耳鼻咽喉科医 jibi-inkōka-i (jee-bee-een-kohh-kah-ee) (ear/throat/mouth 
doctor)
	
✓	内科医 naika-i (nah-ee-kah-ee) (internist)
	
✓	産婦人科医 sanfujinka-i (sahn-foo-jeen-kah-ee) (obstetrician and 
gynecologist)
	
✓	整形外科医 seikei-geka-i (sehh-kehh-geh-kah-ee) (orthopedist)
	
✓	歯科医 shika-i (shee-kah-ee) (dentist)
	
✓	小児科医 shōnika-i (shohh-nee-kah-ee) (pediatrician)

294
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Going to a hospital
Japanese have a couple different kinds of hospitals: daigaku byōin (dah-ee-
gah-koo byohh-een) (university hospital) and kyūkyū byōin (kyooo-kyooo 
byohh-een) (emergency hospital/emergency room). If you have a medical 
emergency, head straight to the nearest kyūkyū byōin. Make sure you have 
your identification and insurance cards with you, though, because you’ll have 
to present them when you arrive. These words will be helpful:
	
✓	健康保険 kenkō hoken (kehn-kohh hoh-kehn) (health insurance)
	
✓	健康保険証 kenkō hokenshō (kehn-kohh hoh-kehn-shohh) (health 
insurance card)
	
✓	身分証明書 mibun shōmeisho (mee-boon shohh-mehh-shoh) 
(identification)
Also, you may well hear the following questions, so you’d best get familiar 
with them:
	
✓	胸は痛くありませんか。 Mune wa itaku arimasen ka. (moo-neh wah ee-
tah-koo ah-ree-mah-sehn kah.) (Do you have chest pain? [Literally: Don’t 
you have chest pain?])
	
✓	吐き気はしますか。 Hakike wa shimasu ka. (hah-kee-keh wah shee-mah-
soo kah.) (Do you feel nauseous?)
	
✓	呼吸は苦しくありませんか。 Kokyū wa kurushiku arimasen ka. (koh-
kyooo wah koo-roo-shee-koo ah-ree-mah-sehn kah.) (Do you have any 
discomfort in breathing? [Literally: Don’t you have any discomfort in 
breathing?])
An insight into Japanese healthcare
In the United States, people usually see their 
doctors by appointment, but in Japan, they 
usually walk in. If you arrive early in the morn­
ing, you can get in to see the doctor earlier. If 
you come a bit late, you may have to wait for a 
few hours. Not having to make an appointment 
is nice, but the trade-off is that you have to wait 
for quite a while in the waiting room.
The Japanese government offers a uniform 
health insurance policy to all, and the pre­
mium and copay are pretty affordable except 
for special cases. Japan also has a very orga­
nized care-management system for elderly and 
handicapped people.

295
 Chapter 18: Handling Emergencies
	
If you want to recommend that your friend do something, like go to the hospi­
tal, place hō ga ii (hohh gah eee) (it’s better to) after a verb in the past tense. 
Yes, strangely, even though such a recommendation refers to the future, you 
use the past tense of the verb. If you think someone should eat, say Tabeta hō 
ga ii. (tah-beh-tah hohh gah eee.). (If you were to insist on a literal translation, 
this sentence would translate as the ate-alternative is good, and that, my friend, 
is why you can’t always rely on literal translations.) The past tense of the verb 
taberu (tah-beh-roo) (to eat) is tabeta (tah-beh-tah). It’s very easy to form 
the past tense of a verb if you know the te-form. Replace the final e in the te-
form with an a, and you instantly get the past tense. And if you want to speak 
politely, add desu to the end of hō ga ii. Check out these examples:
病院に行った方がいいですよ。 Byōin ni itta hō ga ii desu yo. (byohh-een 
nee eet-tah hohh gah eee deh-soo yoh.) (You’d better to go to the hospital.)
医者に見てもらった方がいいよ。 Isha ni mite moratta hō ga ii yo. (ee-
shah nee mee-teh moh-raht-tah hohh gah eee yo.) (It’s better to have your 
doctor check you.)
休んだ方がいいよ。 Yasunda hō ga ii yo. (yah-soon-dah hohh gah eee 
yoh.) (You’d better rest.)
薬をのんだ方がいいですよ。 Kusuri o nonda hō ga ii desu yo. (koo-soo-
ree oh nohn-dah hohh gah eee deh-soo yoh.) (It’s better to take medicine.)
Interestingly, for saying that it’s better not to do something, you can just use 
the present negative form in the plain/informal form. No need to get the past 
tense involved.
お酒は飲まない方がいいですよ。 O-sake wa nomanai hō ga ii desu yo. 
(oh-sah-keh wah noh-mah-nah-ee hohh gah eee deh-soo yoh.) (You’d 
better not drink alcohol.)
無理しない方がいいですよ。 Muri shinai hō ga ii desu yo. (moo-ree shee-
nah-ee hohh gah eee deh-soo yoh.) (You’d better not work/try too hard.)
Check out Chapter 3 for the present negative form in the plain/informal style.
Navigating a Doctor’s Visit
Understanding doctor-talk in your own language can be hard enough, let 
alone trying to decipher it in a foreign one. How are you supposed to get the 
doctor’s help if you can’t tell her what’s wrong or comprehend her diagnosis 
and advice? Luckily, the following sections tell you how to refer to parts of 
your body, how to describe pains and other symptoms, and how to under­
stand any basic diagnosis and treatment you may receive.

296
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
Referring to your body parts
To tell a doctor or nurse where you’re experiencing pain or discomfort, you 
need Japanese words for body parts. Go over the terms in the following bul­
lets, touching your body parts as you say the words for extra reinforcement.
	
✓	頭 atama (ah-tah-mah) (head)
	
✓	目 me (meh) (eyes)
	
✓	耳 mimi (mee-mee) (ears)
	
✓	鼻 hana (hah-nah) (nose)
	
✓	口 kuchi (koo-chee) (mouth)
	
✓	歯 ha (hah) (tooth)
	
✓	首 kubi (koo-bee) (neck)
	
✓	喉 nodo (noh-doh) (throat)
	
✓	肩 kata (kah-tah) (shoulder)
	
✓	胸 mune (moo-neh) (chest/breast)
	
✓	背中 senaka (seh-nah-kah) (back)
	
✓	おなか onaka (oh-nah-kah) (belly)
	
✓	腕 ude (oo-deh) (arm)
	
✓	肘 hiji (hee-jee) (elbow)
	
✓	手首 tekubi (teh-koo-bee) (wrist)
	
✓	手 te (teh) (hand/arm)
	
✓	指 yubi (yoo-bee) (finger)
	
✓	腰 koshi (koh-shee) (hip)
	
✓	膝 hiza (hee-zah) (knee)
	
✓	関節 kansetsu (kahn-seh-tsoo) (joints)
	
✓	足首 ashikubi (ah-shee-koo-bee) (ankle)
	
✓	足 ashi (ah-shee) (foot/leg)
	
✓	足の指 ashi no yubi (ah-shee noh yoo-bee) (toes)
	
If the word ashi (ah-shee) means both foot and leg, and the word te (teh) 
means both hand and arm, how do you know which is which? Context is every­
thing, as you can see from the following examples:
兄は足が短い。 Ani wa ashi ga mijikai. (ah-nee wah ah-shee gah mee-jee-
kah-ee.) (My older brother’s legs are short.)

297
 Chapter 18: Handling Emergencies
弟が私の足を踏んだ。 Otōto ga watashi no ashi o funda. (oh-tohh-toh 
gah wah-tah-shee noh ah-shee oh foon-dah.) (My little brother stepped on 
my foot.)
ピザは手で食べる。 Piza wa te de taberu. (pee-zah wah teh deh tah-beh-
roo.) (We eat pizza by hand.)
猿は手が長い。 Saru wa te ga nagai. (sah-roo wah teh gah nah-gah-ee.) 
(Monkeys have long arms.)
You may also want to know what to call your important internal organs:
	
✓	腸 chō (chohh) (intestine)
	
✓	肺 hai (hah-ee) (lungs)
	
✓	胃 i (ee) (stomach)
	
✓	腎臓 jinzō (jeen-zohh) (kidney)
	
✓	肝臓 kanzō (kahn-zohh) (liver)
	
✓	脳 nō (nohh) (brain)
	
✓	心臓 shinzō (sheen-zohh) (heart)
Complaining about your pain
Expect to be asked questions like the following at the doctor’s office or in the 
emergency room:
	
✓	どうしましたか。 Dō shimashita ka. (dohh shee-mah-shee-tah kah.) 
(What happened?)
	
✓	いつからですか。 Itsu kara desu ka. (ee-tsoo kah-rah deh-soo kah.) (For 
how long? [Literally: Since when is it going on?])
	
✓	どこが痛いんですか。 Doko ga itai-n-desu ka. (doh-koh gah ee-tah-een-
deh-soo kah.) (Where does it hurt?)
	
✓	熱はありますか。 Netsu wa arimasu ka. (neh-tsoo wah ah-ree-mah-soo 
kah.) (Do you have a fever?)
If some part of your body hurts, say the body part that hurts (refer to the 
preceding section), plus ga (gah), plus itai (ee-tah-ee) or itai-n-desu (ee-tah-
een-deh-soo). By adding -n-desu, you sound polite and receptive to your 
doctor’s response, as I discuss in Chapter 5. Itai (ee-tah-ee) is an adjective 
meaning painful, although in English, you often say it hurts. Itai is also what 
Japanese say for ouch. So atama ga itai basically means head is ouch — 
in other words, I have a headache. If more than one part hurts, list all the 
parts, using the particle to (toh) as a type of verbal comma and a stand-in 

298
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
for and. Place to after each body part, except the last one, as in the following 
examples:
肩と首がとても痛いんです。 Kata to kubi ga totemo itai-n-desu. (kah-tah 
toh koo-bee gah toh-teh-moh ee-tah-een-deh-soo.) (My shoulder and neck 
hurt a lot.)
肩と腰と首が痛いんです。 Kata to koshi to kubi ga itai-n-desu. (kah-tah 
toh koh-shee toh koo-bee gah ee-tah-een-deh-soo.) (My shoulder, back, 
and neck hurt.)
	
To describe how something hurts, you can use funny image-sound words 
like the ones in the following list. These words are actually a small subset of 
Japanese sound symbolism that includes onomatopoeia, and they usually con­
sist of a repetition of one or two syllables. No translations here, just descrip­
tions. Sorry.
	
✓	チクチク chiku-chiku (chee-koo-chee-koo): Sharp, needle-like pain, like 
you may have with stomach complaints
	
✓	ガンガン gan-gan (gahn-gahn): Hammering or banging pain, as with a 
pounding headache
	
✓	ゴホンゴホン gohon-gohon (goh-hohn-goh-hohn): Deep coughing sounds
	
✓	ヒリヒリ hiri-hiri (hee-ree-hee-ree): Smarting pain, as with a bad sunburn
	
✓	ゼーゼー zē-zē (zehh-zehh): Wheezing sound in the chest
	
✓	ズキズキ zuki-zuki (zoo-kee-zoo-kee): Nailing or screwing pain in the head
Here are some examples of how you can weave these expressions into 
­sentences:
頭がズキズキ痛いんです。 Atama ga zuki-zuki itai-n-desu. (ah-tah-mah gah 
zoo-kee-zoo-kee ee-tah-een-deh-soo.) (I have a screwing pain in the head.)
火傷したところがヒリヒリします。 Yakedo shita tokoro ga hiri-hiri 
shimasu. (yah-keh-doh shee-tah toh-koh-roh gah hee-ree-hee-ree shee-
mah-soo.) (The part I burned hurts.)
胃がチクチクするんです。I ga chiku-chiku suru-n-desu. (ee gah chee-koo-
chee-koo soo-roon-deh-soo.) (My stomach hurts with a tingling sensation.)
Describing your symptoms
Expressing exactly how you’re feeling with specific shōjō (shohh-johh) 
(symptoms) is crucial for receiving the right diagnosis. A few shōjō may occur 
together. For example, bad stomach viruses cause nausea, which is usually 

299

followed by diarrhea. Upper respiratory infections can give you a runny nose, 
a cough, and a very stuffy and congested night’s sleep (or lack of sleep). 
Think about your shōjō and then find them in the following list so you know 
how to describe what you’re experiencing before you go to the doctor:
	
✓	便秘をしている benpi o shite iru (behn-pee oh shee-teh ee-roo) (to have 
constipation)
	
✓	下痢をしている geri o shite iru (geh-ree oh shee-teh ee-roo) (to have 
diarrhea)
	
✓	吐き気がする hakike ga suru (hah-kee-keh gah soo-roo) (to have nausea)
	
✓	鼻がつまっている hana ga tsumatte iru (hah-nah gah tsoo-maht-teh 
ee-roo) (to have a stuffy nose)
	
✓	鼻水がでる hanamizu ga deru (hah-nah-mee-zoo gah deh-roo) (to have a 
runny nose)
	
✓	クシャミがでる kushami ga deru (koo-shah-mee gah deh-roo) (to sneeze)
	
✓	目がかゆい me ga kayui (meh gah kah-yoo-ee) (to have itchy eyes)
	
✓	目眩がする memai ga suru (me-mah-ee gah soo-roo) (to have dizziness)
	
✓	耳が痛い mimi ga itai (mee-mee gah ee-tah-ee) (to have an earache)
	
✓	胸が痛い mune ga itai (moo-neh gah ee-tah-ee) (to have chest pain)
	
✓	熱がある netsu ga aru (neh-tsoo gah ah-roo) (to have a fever)
	
✓	喉が痛い nodo ga itai (noh-doh gah ee-tah-ee) (to have a sore throat)
	
✓	寒気がする samuke ga suru (sah-moo-keh gah soo-roo) (to have the 
chills)
	
✓	咳が出る seki ga deru (seh-kee gah deh-roo) (to cough)
	
✓	頭痛がする zutsū ga suru (zoo-tsoo gah soo-roo) (to have a headache)
	
✓	ゼーゼーする zē-zē suru (zehh-zehh soo-roo) (to wheeze)
Conjugate the ru-verb deru (deh-roo) (to come out). You need it to describe 
all the annoying mucus that comes out when you cough, sneeze, and blow 
your nose when you have a code — sorry, that’s stuffy-speak for “cold.”

Receiving a diagnosis
A doctor can usually diagnose a minor cold or the flu just by talking with you, 
but sometimes you have to have tests done. No one wants to have a painful 
or time-consuming test, but if the doctor tells you that you need it, you’d 
better take it.
A few tests and procedures that a doctor may recommend are
	
✓	ＣＡＴスキャン CAT sukyan (kyaht-toh soo-kyahn) (CAT scan)
	
✓	超音波検査 chōonpa kensa (chohh-ohn-pah kehn-sah) (ultrasound)
	
✓	ＣＴ CT (sheee-teee) (CT scan)
	
✓	血液検査 ketsueki kensa (keh-tsoo-eh-kee kehn-sah) (blood test)
	
✓	MRI MRI (eh-moo-ahh-roo-ah-ee) (MRI)
	
✓	尿検査 nyō kensa (nyohh kehn-sah) (urine test)
	
✓	レントゲン rentogen (rehn-toh-gehn) (X-ray)
	
✓	ソノグラム sonoguramu (soh-noh-goo-rah-moo) (sonogram)
After you explain your symptoms to the doctor, have an exam, and undergo 
any necessary tests, it’s judgment time. For your sake, I hope the shindan 
(sheen-dahn) (diagnosis) isn’t serious. Possible shindan include the following:
	
✓	アレルギー arerugī (ah-reh-roo-geee) (allergies)
	
✓	炎症 enshō (ehn-shohh) (inflammation)
	
✓	肺炎 haien (hah-ee-ehn) (pneumonia)
	
✓	インフルエンザ infuruenza (een-foo-roo-ehn-zah) (influenza/flu)
	
✓	花粉症 kafunshō (kah-foon-shohh) (hay fever)
	
✓	感染 kansen (kahn-sehn) (infection)
	
✓	関節炎 kansetsuen (kahn-seh-tsoo-ehn) (arthritis)
	
✓	風邪 kaze (kah-zeh) (cold)
	
✓	気管支炎 kikanshien (kee-kahn-shee-ehn) (bronchitis)
	
✓	骨折 kossetsu (kohs-seh-tsoo) (broken bone)
	
✓	盲腸 mōchō (mohh-chohh) (appendicitis)
	
✓	捻挫 nenza (nehn-zah) (sprain)
	
✓	脳震盪 nōshintō (nohh-sheen-tohh) (concussion)
	
✓	食中毒 shokuchūdoku (shoh-koo-chooo-doh-koo) (food poisoning)

301
 Chapter 18: Handling Emergencies
	
✓	ウィルス wirusu (wee-roo-soo) (virus)
	
✓	喘息 zensoku (zehn-soh-koo) (asthma)
Getting treatment
Your doctor may give you some kusuri (koo-soo-ree) (medication) that makes 
you a bit more comfortable, such as one of the following:
	
✓	アスピリン asupirin (ah-soo-pee-reen) (asprin)
	
✓	鎮痛剤 chintsūzai (cheen-tsooo-zah-ee) (pain reliever)
	
✓	解熱剤 genetsuzai (geh-neh-tsoo-zah-ee) (fever reducer)
	
✓	抗生物質 kōsei busshitsu (kohh-sehh boos-shee-tsoo) (antibiotic)
	
✓	咳止め sekidome (seh-kee-doh-meh) (cough suppressant)
There’s no cure for a cold, so all you can do is try to treat your symptoms 
and make your life a little less miserable. Ask your grandma for her natural 
home remedy. One Japanese traditional cold remedy is tamago zake (tah-
mah-goh zah-keh) (egg sake) — heated sake with beaten egg. What’s your 
secret remedy? Ginger tea? Chicken soup? Honey? Orange juice?
The doctor should ask you Yakubutsu arerugī wa arimasu ka. (yah-koo-boo-
tsoo ah-reh-roo-gee wah ah-ree-mah-soo kah.) (Are you allergic to any medica­
tion?) before prescribing any medication, but if for some reason she doesn’t 
and you know you’re allergic to some medications, don’t forget to mention it. 
For example, you can say Penishirin ni arerugī ga arimasu. (peh-nee-shee-
reen nee ah-reh-roo-geee gah ah-ree-mah-soo.) (I’m allergic to penicillin.)
If you have an injury, you may come home with one of these:
	
✓	ギプス gipusu (gee-poo-soo) (cast)
	
✓	包帯 hōtai (hohh-tah-ee) (bandage)
	
✓	松葉杖 matsubazue (mah-tsoo-bah-zoo-eh) (crutches)
	
✓	湿布 shippu (sheep-poo) (hot or cold compress)
Calling the Police
	
The police emergency number in Japan is 110. Japanese call it 110-ban (hyah-
koo-tohh-bahn). Yes, they usually say hyakutō-ban (hyah-koo-tohh-bahn) 
rather than hyakujū-ban (hyah-koo-jooo-bahn) — just one of those things. The 

302
Part III: Japanese on the Go 
number for an accident or a fire is different: 119-ban (hyah-koo-jooo-kyooo-
bahn). Don’t confuse these numbers with your own emergency number — 911 
in the United States, for example.
When you call emergency numbers in any country, calm down and first tell 
the dispatcher where you are. Then explain what happened. The following 
sections explain how to report an accident to the police and report lost or 
stolen possessions.
Reporting an accident to the police
If you see a jiko (jee-koh) (accident), report it to the keisatsu (kehh-sah-tsoo) 
(police). The verb you need to report a jiko is aru (ah-roo) (to exist); use it 
in the past tense — There was an accident. — and the polite/neutral style 
(because you’re talking to a police officer). So you need to conjugate aru into 
the polite past tense form, arimashita (ah-ree-mah-shee-tah), as in the follow­
ing examples:
事故がありました。 Jiko ga arimashita. (jee-koh gah ah-ree-mah-shee-
tah.) (There was an accident.)
高田町で事故がありました。 Takada-chō de jiko ga arimashita. (tah-kah-
dah-chohh deh jee-koh gah ah-ree-mah-shee-tah.) (There was an accident 
in Takada Town.)
I don’t want you au (ah-oo) (to be involved in) an accident, but if you are, 
make sure to mark jiko with the particle ni when you use the verb au, as in 
jiko ni au (jee-koh nee ah-oo) (to be involved in an accident). The polite past 
tense form of au is aimashita: Hidoi jiko ni aimashita. (hee-doh-ee jee-koo 
nee ah-ee-mah-shee-tah.) (I was involved in a terrible accident.) 
Conjugate the u-verb au. Watch out for the w sound in the negative form.

Unfortunately, at some point you may be the one to cause the accident. In 
that case, you need to conjugate the u-verb okosu (o-koh-soo) (to cause). 
Create s/sh-syllables.

You often need to specify the nature of an accident so that the people 
responding know what to expect. The following list gives you an idea of some 
of the types of jiko you may encounter:
	
✓	バイクの事故 baiku no jiko (bah-ee-koo noh jee-koh) (motorcycle 
accident)
	
✓	ガス漏れ事故 gasumore jiko (gah-soo-moh-reh jee-koh) (gas leak 
accident)
	
✓	自動車事故 jidōsha jiko (jee-dohh-shah jee-koh) (auto accident)
	
✓	火事 kaji (kah-jee) (fire)
	
✓	怪我 kega (keh-gah) (injury)
	
✓	交通事故 kōtsū jiko (kohh-tsoo jee-koh) (traffic accident)
Unfortunately, kōtsū jiko are everyday events in most cities. If you’re 
involved in an accident and no one gets hurt, consider yourself lucky in an 
unlucky situation, even if it’s your fault.
To avoid future legal complications over responsibilities, call the police, 
tell them where you are, and wait for the police officer to arrive. To tell the 
police how to find you, use the location and direction words listed in Chapter 
8. And while you’re waiting for them to arrive, you may as well conjugate the 
u-verb matsu (mah-tsoo) (to wait).

Reporting a crime
Japan is a quite safe country and has a relatively low crime rate. Women can 
walk around in the city at night feeling pretty safe. The contribution of police 
boxes called kōban (kohh-bahn) is absolutely significant for the high level of 
safety in Japan. However, if you’re attacked, involved in a crime, or witness 
any criminal act in Japan, report it to the police immediately. You may need 
to know some of these nouns related to crimes:
	
✓	暴行 bōkō (bohh-kohh) (assault) 
	
✓	強盗 gōtō (gohh-tohh) (robbery, robber)
	
✓	放火 hōka (hohh-kah) (arson) 
	
✓	詐欺 sagi (sah-gee) (fraud)
	
✓	殺人 satsujin (sah-tsoo-jeen) (murder)
	
✓	窃盗 settō (seht-tohh) (theft)
	
✓	誘拐 yūkai (yoo-kah-ee) (kidnapping)

Reporting lost or stolen belongings
If you lose a handobaggu (hahn-doh-bahg-goo) (handbag), saifu (sah-ee-foo) 
(wallet), or sūtsukēsu (sooo-tsoo-kehh-soo) (suitcase), tell the authorities 
where you lost it and what it looks like. (Use the words from Chapter 10 to 
describe the item’s color and size.) And think about what was in it so you can 
list those items on the police report. If your handobaggu or saifu is stolen, 
you may also be missing the following:
	
✓	現金 genkin (gehn-keen) (cash)
	
✓	鍵 kagi (kah-gee) (keys)
	
✓	クレジットカード kurejitto kādo (koo-reh-jeeht-toh kahh-doh) (credit 
card)
	
✓	写真 shashin (shah-sheen) (photos)
	
✓	運転免許証 unten menkyoshō (oon-tehn mehn-kyoh-shohh) (driver’s 
license)
To describe the contents of your bag or wallet, use the phrase haitte iru 
(hah-eet-teh ee-roo) (to be in it). Haitte is the te-form of the verb hairu (hah-
ee-roo) (to be placed in somewhere). Conjugate the u-verb hairu, which also 
means to enter in some contexts.
Japanese Script
Rōmaji
Pronunciation
入る
hairu
hah-ee-roo
入らない
hairanai
hah-ee-rah-nah-ee
入り（ます）
hairi(masu)
hah-ee-ree(-mah-soo)
入って
haitte
hah-eet-teh
	
If you add the verb iru (ee-roo) (to exist) after another verb in the te-form, 
you’re talking about a state. For example, haitte iru is the state after some­
thing entered. This concept — that something would be in the state of having 
entered somewhere — is hard to understand in English, but it just means 
“something is in it.” That’s it.
So Genkin ga haitte iru. (gehn-keehn gah hah-eet-teh ee-roo.) means Some 
cash is in it. But in a polite/neutral context, such as when you’re talking to the 
police, say Genkin ga haitte imasu. (gehn-keen gah hah-eet-teh ee-mah-soo.) 
instead. And if you have more than one item in your bag, list everything by 
using the particle to (toh) after each item except the last one. These exam­
ples help you explain to the police what your missing item contains:
写真が入っています。 Shashin ga haitte imasu. (shah-sheen gah hah-eet-
teh ee-mah-soo.) (It has a photo in it. [Literally: A photo is in it.])

307
 Chapter 18: Handling Emergencies
財布とパスポートが入っています。 Saifu to pasupōto ga haitte imasu. 
(sah-ee-foo toh pah-soo-pohh-toh gah hah-eet-teh ee-mah-soo.) (My wallet 
and my passport are in it.)
現金とクレジットカードと写真が入っています。 Genkin to kurejitto 
kādo to shashin ga haitte imasu. (gehn-keen toh koo-reh-jeet-toh kahh-
doh toh shah-sheen gah hah-eet-teh ee-mah-soo.) (Some cash, a credit 
card, and a photograph are in it.)
	
If you want to list the items as examples, implying that there are other items, 
use the particle ya (yah) rather than to (toh). For example, if you say Genkin 
ya kurejitto kādo ya shashin ga haitte imasu. (gehn-keen yah koo-reh-jeet-toh 
kahh-doh yah shah-sheen gah hah-eet-teh ee-mah-soo.) (Some cash, a credit 
card, a photograph, and so on are in it.), it sounds like there are other items in 
the bag as well.
	
If you lose something in a store, airport, or train station, listen for an announce­
ment. If you’re paged over the public address system, it’s a good sign. An 
announcement states your name and o-koshi kudasai (oh-koh-shee koo-dah-sah-
ee). This term is a super-polite, businesslike phrase that means please come and 
uses the stem form — koshi — of the verb kosu (koh-soo) (to come). If you’re 
curious about what the o and kudasai are doing, take a look at Chapter 15.
Getting Legal Help
Japan isn’t a very litigious society, and Japanese don’t settle disputes 
through the courts as often as Americans seem to, but if you find that you 
need legal assistance in Japan, you can always talk to a bengoshi (behn-goh-
shee) (lawyer). Contacting your country’s ryōjikan (ryohh-jee-kahn) (consul­
ate) is also a good idea if you run into trouble.
You may find these sentences helpful if you require legal assistance while 
traveling in Japan:
	
✓	アメリカ領事館に連絡してください。 Amerika ryōjikan ni renraku 
shite kudasai. (ah-meh-ree-kah ryohh-jee-kahn nee rehn-rah-koo shee-
teh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please contact the American consulate.)
	
✓	弁護士を呼んでください。 Bengoshi o yonde kudasai. (behn-goh-shee 
oh yohn-deh koo-dah-sah-ee.) (Please call a lawyer.)
	
✓	私の弁護士に話してください。 Watashi no bengoshi ni hanashite 
kudasai. (wah-tah-shee noh behn-goh-shee nee hah-nah-shee-teh koo-
dah-sah-ee.) (Please talk to my lawyer.)
Foreigners in Japan are subject to the laws of Japan. If you’re arrested, 
know that you have your right to remain silent, to hire a lawyer at your own 
expense, and to have the embassy or the consulate notified of your arrest.

his part is short but sweet. It contains a bunch of 
good, practical tips that you can keep in mind as you 
immerse yourself in the Japanese language. I give you ten 
ways to pick up Japanese quickly, and believe me, they 
can make a huge difference in your progress. Next, I let 
you know ten things that you should never say in front of 
Japanese folks. You may thank me one day if you avoid 
one of these potentially embarrassing situations. Finally, 
I introduce you to ten great Japanese expressions and ten

Ten Ways to Pick Up 
Japanese Quickly
In This Chapter
▶	Incorporating Japanese items into your daily life
▶	Speaking Japanese with Japanese speakers
L

anguage immersion programs work for a reason: They surround you 
with the language you’re trying to learn and force you to speak it in 
order to communicate with others. You can create an immersion-type envi­
ronment to help you pick up Japanese quickly by applying the ten methods 
I list in this chapter. With these ten tricks, you’ll be rattling off Japanese 
phrases and sentences in no time.
Use Digital Technologies
Thanks to smartphones and computers, which provide convenient dictionary 
and translation tools, a tremendous amount of information is only a finger 
tap away, anytime and anywhere. You can download Japanese language apps 
for use when you’re on the go. You can use your smartphone or computer’s 
Internet browser to search for Japanese cultural keywords such as kimono 
and sushi, Japanese artists’ names such as Utada and Hamasaki, or Japanese 
place names such as Asakusa and Akihabara. You’ll be amazed by the tons 
of useful information these searches return, and you can surely learn some 
Japanese keywords. Moreover, you can use note-taking apps on your smart­
phone to take note of new Japanese words as soon as you see or hear them, 
wherever you are.
Cook or Eat Japanese Foods
Find a Japanese cookbook at your local bookstore or on the Internet — pref­
erably one with photos that show each step of cooking. Pick a dish that really 

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
makes your mouth water and whip up a Japanese meal next weekend! As you 
read over the recipe for your fabulous feast with step-by-step photos, be sure 
to have your trusty Japanese-English dictionary close by. After you under­
stand the entire recipe, memorize keywords for ingredients and actions. Now, 
it’s time to start cookin’, good lookin’. Each time you wash, cut, grate, mix, 
bake, or grill, say what you’re doing aloud in Japanese. And call out the ingre­
dients as you add them.
If you don’t want to cook, go to a Japanese restaurant. Talk to a Japanese 
waiter, waitress, or sushi chef. Make it a goal to master the names of at least 
five Japanese dishes, ingredients, or whatever’s on the table before you leave 
the restaurant.
Read Japanese Comic Books
Japanese comic books, called manga (mahn-gah), are very popular among 
readers both young and old. With thousands of pictures that show detailed 
background scenes, actions, and facial expressions of characters plus written 
speech in balloons, manga is a rich source for hundreds of words for sound 
symbolism, including onomatopoeia. The words for sound symbolism are 
often written in katakana, and just sounding them out is already so much fun. 
Manga usually include furigana (foo-ree-gah-nah), hiragana specification of 
the pronunciation of kanji characters, so you can always check the meaning 
of kanji characters by using a kanji dictionary. (See Chapter 2 to understand 
what katakana, hiragana, and kanji mean.)
	
You can also purchase a comic book that comes with English translation. Look 
for them in Japanese bookstores, comic book shops, and larger bookstores in 
your town or city.
Watch Japanese Anime, 
Films, and Sports
Your local public library probably has DVDs of Japanese movies and anima­
tion with English subtitles. Pick one that looks interesting. Try one of Akira 
Kurosawa’s movies, such as Seven Samurai and Ran, or other Japanese films 
that have received good reviews, such as Tampopo and Shall We Dance?. You 
may also want to check out Hayao Miyazaki’s animated films My Neighbor Totoro 
and Spirited Away. When you watch a Japanese film for the first time, just watch 
the whole thing for enjoyment. Then watch it a second time and try to catch 
some Japanese words and phrases. Feel free to pause as many times as you 
need; just try to refrain from turning on the English subtitles. You’ll learn the 
meaning of words, and you’ll also figure out what context they’re used in.

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Pick Up Japanese Quickly
If you’re a sports fan, try watching Japanese language broadcasts of sports 
such as sumo and baseball in addition to anime and films. Japanese language 
sport broadcasts are easy to follow because you can hear the language in 
context, just like when you watch anime and films. It’s also useful for getting 
used to the polite/neutral speech style.
Do Karaoke
Get a Japanese karaoke set and sing as you read the lyrics that appear on the 
screen. If you like the song, memorize it. Imitate the real singer’s pronunciation 
very closely. After you master it perfectly, sing it in front of your friends and 
family. They’ll be impressed by your use of Japanese, even if your singing ability 
leaves something to be desired! (Check out Chapter 11 for more on karaoke.)
Spend Time with Japanese
Look around you. Okay, now stop looking around and read the rest of this 
paragraph. Do you know of any Japanese in your school, company, neigh­
borhood, or church? If you find a few Japanese folks, become friends with 
them. Exchange cellphone numbers or e-mail addresses, message each other 
on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and make plans to get 
together sometime.
	
Understanding Japanese culture and society is indispensable for learning the 
language. So why not make plans to spend a nice afternoon with your new 
Japanese friends, discussing Japanese culture, society, and daily life over tea? 
You may be communicating with them in English, but they’ll surely let you 
know some Japanese words that are important for what you’re talking about. 
Make a mental note of these words.
Exchange Language Lessons
Did you know that helping others helps you a lot? Find a Japanese who wants 
to learn English and teach him or her the language. In exchange, ask him 
or her to teach you Japanese. Not only will you learn Japanese for free, but 
you’ll also create a precious friendship.
	
Contact local colleges and universities; they may have some Japanese interna­
tional students who need English help. You can also check with local Japanese 
associations. Find them in your local phone book. I’m sure you can find at 
least one Japanese person in your area who needs some help perfecting his or 
her English.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Get to Know a Monolingual Japanese
Spend time with someone whose only language is Japanese. In order to 
engage in activities such as shopping, cooking, or crafting with a monolin­
gual Japanese person, you need to speak Japanese just because you won’t 
have the luxury of using your English language. As you speak nothing but 
Japanese, your tongue and lips will definitely get a workout. This kind of 
immersion can be a bit painful at the beginning, but it will bring the best 
result. Feeling that you have to speak Japanese to do something is a great 
driving force to increase your natural speaking ability.
If you don’t know a word in Japanese, use hand gestures or drawings to 
express it. And listen carefully to what the Japanese person says. If you do 
this friendly immersion for a few hours each day for a week, by the end of the 
week, you’ll be using fewer and fewer hand gestures and drawings and more 
and more Japanese words. Think of it as a study abroad program without 
ever leaving your home.
Travel to Japan
Nothing is more enjoyable than learning Japanese while traveling to Japan. 
After you’re there, look around you! You see Japanese characters all over. 
Tune in to your surroundings. You hear teenagers chatting with their friends, 
mothers scolding their kids, and store clerks greeting their customers — all 
in Japanese. You just have to keep guessing what they’re saying. What a fun 
way of learning the language!
Be Positive, Curious, and Creative
One of the keys of language learning is to remain positive about and engaged 
in your studies. Don’t worry about making mistakes. Relax your mind when 
you talk. It’s not a job interview. It won’t be recorded or aired on TV. Be posi­
tive and praise yourself when you communicate in Japanese!
Also, don’t wait until someone talks to you in Japanese. Initiate conversations 
yourself. Ask questions in Japanese. Regain the curious and worry-free spirit 
of your childhood.
Be creative and make opportunities to use Japanese in your daily life. Write 
down your weekly schedule in Japanese. Say the time and date in Japanese. 
Memorize your home phone number in Japanese. Address your family in 
Japanese. Greet your friends in Japanese. Don’t wait until someone helps you; 
help yourself. Be creative, be curious, stay positive, and enjoy talking!

Ten Things Never to 
Say in Japanese
In This Chapter
▶	Making sure you don’t sound like a child
▶	Speaking respectfully
▶	Using the right words in the right contexts
S

ocial customs are culturally created rules that differ from country to 
country because they’re often tied to the histories of nations and peo­
ples. Pasts rooted in democracy, feudalism, totalitarianism, pioneer spirit, 
or liberal or conservative values, to name a few, obviously tend to give rise 
to different customs. Because U.S. society and Japanese society are built on 
different customs, what’s considered polite for folks from the United States 
may be rude for Japanese at times. To help you avoid unintentionally offend­
ing your Japanese cohorts, this chapter alerts you to ten things that you 
shouldn’t say when you’re with Japanese people.
“San” After Your Own Name
When you talk with Japanese people, they’ll say your name and then say -san 
(sahn) all the time. But don’t copy them by placing -san after your own name 
when you refer to yourself. For example, don’t say Watashi wa Sumisu-san 
desu. (wah-tah-shee wah soo-mee-soo-sahn deh-soo.) (I’m Mr. Smith.). You’ll 
sound like a kid if you do. Instead, say Watashi wa Sumisu desu. (wah-tah-
shee wah soo-mee-soo deh-soo.) (I’m Smith.).
	
The function of -san is to show respect to others; therefore, use it after other 
people’s names but not after your own name. You can use -san after a family 
name or a given name, but for adults, it’s more common to use a family name 
than a given name when addressing someone.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Your Boss’s or Teacher’s First Name
Never call your Japanese bosses or teachers by their first names, no matter 
how long you’ve worked or studied with them. Call them by their last names 
with the appropriate titles that show their professional positions or func­
tions, like shachō (shah-chohh) (company president) or sensei (sehn-sehh) 
(professor): Tanaka shachō (tah-nah-kah shah-chohh) (President Tanaka) or 
Tanaka sensei (tah-nah-kah sehn-sehh) (Professor Tanaka), for example. If 
their titles are unclear, use the suffix -san (sahn) following their last names, 
as in Tanaka-san (tah-nah-kah-sahn) (Mr./Ms. Tanaka).
“O-genki Desu Ka” to the Person 
You Saw Yesterday
In America, you can say How are you? to a person regardless of whether you 
just saw him or her yesterday. However, that usage is inappropriate for the 
closest Japanese equivalent, O-genki desu ka. (oh-gehn-kee deh-soo kah.), 
which literally means Are you well? Use this phrase only when you see some­
one you haven’t seen for a while
Note: Young people have started to say the short version, Genki. (gehn-kee.) 
(Fine?), as if it’s for daily greeting. However, this expression is still quite dif­
ferent from the usage of O-genki desu ka.
“Sayōnara” to Your Family
Although many Westerners equate the word sayōnara (sah-yohh-nah-rah) 
with a casual goodbye, Japanese really only use it when they part with non-
family members. When they leave their family members for school or work 
in the morning, they say Ittekimasu. (eet-teh-kee-mah-soo.), which literally 
means I’ll leave and come back. (That translation may sound a little clunky, 
but this phrase is a customary Japanese goodbye.) In other contexts where 
Japanese have to part with their families, they usually say Jā ne. (jahh neh.) 
(Okay? Well, see you?) or Jā mata ne. (jahh mah-tah neh.) (Okay, see you 
later.). (For more information about sayōnara, see Chapter 4.)
“Thank You” for a Compliment
In English, if someone says “You look pretty in that dress.” or “You’re really 
smart.”, you usually say “Thanks!” right away, right? Otherwise, the other 

317
 Chapter 20: Ten Things Never to Say in Japanese
person may think you’re snotty. However, Japanese custom is to deny the 
compliment by saying Īe. (eee-eh.) (No.) or Zenzen. (zehn-zehn.) (Not at all.). 
Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t give Japanese people compliments. After 
all, who doesn’t love to receive a little positive feedback? Just be aware that 
Japanese will deny your compliments verbally even though they’re extremely 
happy when they hear them. It’s just part of the Japanese modesty.
So if you’re traveling in Japan and someone says Nihongo ga jōzu desu ne. 
(nee-hohn-goh gah johh-zoo deh-soo neh.) (Your Japanese is good, isn’t it?), 
you’ll impress that person even further if you skip the Arigatō. (ah-ree-gah-
tohh.) (Thanks.) and say Īe., Zenzen., or Mada mada. (mah-dah mah-dah.) 
(Not yet, not yet.).
“My Mom Is Pretty” to Outsiders
Another aspect of Japanese modesty (see the preceding section) is that you 
shouldn’t tell outsiders (as in people other than your family) that your mom 
is pretty. Doing so sounds childish and immodest to Japanese. The same 
principle applies to other members of your family and other types of char­
acteristics; don’t tell outsiders that your little brother or your child is smart 
even if the kid is a valedictorian. The division between insiders and outsiders 
greatly limits what you can say.
Interestingly, this insider/outsider distinction can be extended to business 
contexts: for Japanese, their colleagues are their insiders while their clients 
are outsiders. So pay close attention when you’re about to do business with 
Japanese.
“Yes” Right After Being Offered Food
Don’t say hai (hah-ee) (yes) right away when you’re offered food or drink. 
Japanese say Īe, ii desu. (eee-eh, eee deh-soo.) or Īe, kekkō desu. (ee-ee-eh, 
kehk-kohh deh-soo.), which mean No, thank you., when they’re offered food 
or beverages, even if they’re very hungry or thirsty. The host or hostess 
almost always offers the items again, so the guests eventually accept the 
offer by saying something like Jā, itadakimasu. Arigatō gozaimasu. (jahh, 
eeh-tah-dah-kee-mah-soo. ah-ree-gah-tohh goh-zah-ee-mah-soo.) (Oh, then, I’ll 
have some. Thank you.)
However, when food or drinks are already brought, you can accept the offer 
right away, saying jā, itadakimasu, without trying to refuse them once.

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
“Anata” When Talking to Someone
Although using someone’s name and title repeatedly in a conversation may 
sound strange to you, that’s precisely what you should do when speak­
ing to a Japanese person. Your inclination is probably to use the pronoun 
anata (ah-nah-tah) (you), but don’t; the pronoun anata is almost forbidden 
in Japanese conversations. For some reason, it sounds snobby or arrogant 
unless you’re a wife addressing her husband. A wife can say to her husband, 
Kore wa anata no? (koh-reh wah ah-nah-tah noh.) (Is this yours?). In addi­
tion, a wife can call her husband by saying anata, as if saying Honey! That’s a 
strange use of you, right?
“Aishite Imasu” to Express Likes
The literal translation of to love in Japanese is aishite imasu (ah-ee-shee-teh 
ee-mah-soo). However, people say this phrase in very serious occasions or 
contexts only, like when they’re proposing. In English, you often hear people 
say they love something, like I love dogs!, but if you say Inu o aishite iru. 
(ee-noo oh ah-ee-shee-teh ee-mah-soo.) just to mean you love dogs, people 
may think you’re weird; you’ll sound like you want to get married to a dog or 
to dedicate the rest of your life to dogs. Similarly, if you say Ano sūgaku no 
sensei o aishite imasu. (ah-noh sooo-gah-koo noh senh-sehh oh ah-ee-shee-teh 
ee-mah-soo.) (I love the math teacher.), you’ll sound scandalous or unethical.
	
To say you like someone or something in a general sense, use suki desu (soo-
kee deh-soo) (to like) or dai-suki desu (dah-ee-soo-kee deh-soo) (to like very 
much), and mark the person or item you like with the particle ga (gah). For 
example, Inu ga suki desu. (ee-noo gah soo-kee deh-soo.) (I love dogs.). See 
Chapter 6 for more about suki desu and dai-suki desu.
“Do You Want Coffee?”
Japanese people feel shy about expressing their desire for foods and drinks 
to nonfamily members, so asking them Kōhī ga hoshii desu ka. (kohh-heee 
gah hoh-shee-ee deh-soo kah.) (Do you want coffee?) directly may make them 
uncomfortable. Instead, say Kōhī wa ikaga desu ka. (kohh-heee wah ee-kah-
ga deh-soo kah.) (How about coffee?). Or if you’re talking to your close friend 
or roommate, you can just say Kōhī wa dō. (kohh-heee wah dohh.) (How 
about coffee?) with a rising question intonation. Dō and ikaga both mean how, 
and ikaga is just the polite counterpart of dō.

Ten Favorite Japanese 
Expressions
In This Chapter
▶	Responding to the situation
▶	Unveiling your excitement
▶	Showing your attitude
L

ife is full of ki-do-ai-raku (kee-doh-ah-ee-rah-koo) (delight-anger-sorrow-
fun), and some phrases slip out of Japanese mouths repeatedly in 
response to different daily situations. Mastering these common expressions, 
whether they’re simple adverbs or full sentences, is essential. That’s why I 
give you ten popular Japanese expressions in this chapter.
	
Although I note in Chapter 3 that Japanese doesn’t use question marks, I’ve 
included them in some phrases in this chapter when the expression is very 
short and doesn’t contain a question particle that would otherwise tip you off. 
That way, you can be sure to use these expressions with the proper intonation.
Yatta!
やった! Yatta! (yaht-tah!) (I did it!)
Say Yatta! when you accomplish something big, receive a great opportunity, 
or feel victorious. Passing a difficult test, getting the job you wanted, or win­
ning the lottery — these all qualify as Yatta! material. I hope you get the 
opportunity to use this expression every day.

320
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Hontō?
本当？ Hontō? (hohn-tohh?) (Really?)
Say Hontō? with a rising intonation to confirm what you’ve just heard. 
Suppose your colleague tells you that she’s getting married to your boss. 
Respond to the news by saying Hontō? What if your friend says that he’ll 
give his car to you for free? Say Hontō? before saying thank you. You can say 
Hontō? in a lot of situations because so many unbelievable things happen 
every day.
Sasuga!
さすが！ Sasuga! (sah-soo-gah!) (I’m impressed by you, as usual!)
The literal meaning of sasuga is as might have been expected, but the expres­
sion is commonly used as a compliment when someone who had a good 
reputation has done an impressive job as expected. Suppose your friend is 
a good athlete, and he has just won the gold medal in a skiing competition. 
You can tell him Sasuga!, meaning I knew that you could win the prize! You 
were cool, as usual. If your company president has just created a new day-
care center and a recreation facility for the employees, you can say Sasuga 
shachō! (sah-soo-gah shah-chohh!) to her. It means I admire your usual 
thoughtfulness, president.
	
The difference between the adjective sugoi (soo-goh-ee) (great) and the saying 
sasuga is that sasuga means not just great but great as always.
Mochiron!
もちろん! Mochiron! (moh-chee-rohn!) (Of course!)
Mochiron is the favorite adverb of confident people. Use it when you’re 100 
percent confident in your opinion. So if your spouse ever asks you, “Would 
you marry me if you had a chance to do it all over again?”, take my advice: 
Just say mochiron because you only live once and will never actually be 
faced with the decision (or with sleeping on the couch because you gave the 
wrong answer).

321
 Chapter 21: Ten Favorite Japanese Expressions
Ā, Yokatta.
ああ，よかった。 Ā, yokatta. (ahh, yoh-kaht-tah.) (Oh, good.)
Say Ā, yokatta. every time you feel like saying What a relief! or Oh, good. If 
you’re Mr. or Ms. Worrier, you may say Ā, yokatta ten times a day. For example
Did I turn off the stove?
Yes, you did.
Ā, yokatta.
My daughter was kidnapped!
No, she’s right there behind you.
Ā, yokatta.
Zenzen.
ぜんぜん。 Zenzen. (zehn-zehn.) (Not at all.)
Zenzen is an adverb used with a negative verb or adjective, but it‘s often 
used by itself as the phrase of denial. Suppose that someone asks you, “Am 
I disturbing you?” when he’s not bothering you at all. Say zenzen and shake 
your head. (If he’s your boss, though, you may still want to say zenzen even 
if he is disturbing you.)
Nani?
何？ Nani? (nah-nee?) (What?)
Nani is a question word that’s handy when you talk with a Japanese person. 
Say Nani? with a rising intonation when you don’t hear or understand what 
the other person said.
	
You can also say Nani? when you can’t believe or don’t like what you hear. 
For example, suppose your significant other suddenly announces, “I’m getting 
married to Tom.” If your name isn’t Tom, you can surely say Nani? — assum­
ing you have the ability to form words at that point.

322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Dōshiyō?
どうしよう。 Dōshiyō? (dohh-shee-yohh?) (What shall I do?)
Say dōshiyō when you’re in a panic and have no idea what to do. You 
can repeat it over and over while you try to think of what to do: Dōshiyō, 
dōshiyō, dōshiyō. Now you sound like you’re in big trouble. What happened? 
Oh, you’ve locked your car door with your keys and your dog inside? Maybe 
you should check out Chapter 18 for advice on contacting the police.
Yappari.
やっぱり。 Yappari. (yahp-pah-ree.) (I knew it would happen.)
Sometimes you have a vague suspicion that something will happen, and then 
it actually happens. At times like that, say yappari. Suppose that you haven’t 
received a newspaper for the last month, but the newspaper delivery person 
says that he has dropped it off in front of your door every day. You suspect 
your neighbor is the culprit. One day, you wake up earlier than usual and 
see your neighbor picking up your newspaper. Your suspicion is confirmed, 
and you can say yappari.
Ā, Bikkurishita!
ああ，びっくりした。 Ā, bikkurishita! (ahh, beek-koo-ree-shee-tah!) (What a 
surprise!)
Say Ā, bikkurishita! when you’re very surprised. If your family throws you a 
surprise party, say Ā, bikkurishita! after they shout out Surprise!.

Ten Phrases That Make You 
Sound Fluent in Japanese
In This Chapter
▶	Greeting guests
▶	Giving it your best shot
▶	Expressing sympathy or encouragement
A

ll languages have some obscure or unique expressions that provide 
an authentic flavor of the culture. The literal translations are often not 
transparent, and your command of these expressions depends on a deep 
understanding of the culture and values behind the language. In this chap­
ter, I give you ten phrases that can make you sound Japanese. Master these 
expressions and use them in the right context to feel the Japanese mentality 
and spirit.
Enryo Shinaide.
遠慮しないで。 Enryo shinai de. (ehn-ryoh shee-nah-ee deh.) (Don’t be shy.)
Japanese guests often appear to be very shy. They usually refuse offers of 
food or drink at least once, no matter what; it’s just a part of their politeness. 
If you’re the host, the customary response is to say Enryo shinaide right 
after your guest says No, thank you. Using this phrase indicates that you’re 
a gracious host and encourages your guest to accept your kind offer the 
second time.
Mottainai.
もったいない。 Mottainai. (moht-tah-ee-nah-ee.) (What a waste./It’s too good.)

324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Even though Japanese have become spoiled by disposable goods — such 
as plastic diapers, paper cups, and paper towels — they still hate to waste 
things. They constantly express their objections to waste by saying mottai­
nai. What? Are you going to throw away that sweater? Mottainai. Give it to me.
	
This phrase doesn’t just express your objection to throwing away things; you 
can also say mottainai if someone lacks a true appreciation for something of 
value, such as when your children don’t appreciate good food. What? You gave 
steak to the dog? Mottainai.
You can also use mottainai for discussing how somebody is wasting their 
time with a particular romantic partner. For example, when you hear that 
Emily — the valedictorian and the most popular girl in school — is going 
out with Devin — a guy who’s far from good-looking and spends all his time 
eating and sleeping — you may want to say mottainai!
O-saki Ni.
おさきに。 O-saki ni. (oh-sah-kee nee.) (Pardon me, but I’m leaving now.)
Although the literal meaning of o-saki ni is earlier, Japanese use this expres­
sion to politely say goodbye in all sorts of contexts and locations — a wait­
ing room, a restaurant, a library, a party, and so on. The o at the beginning 
of the expression o-saki ni is the honorific prefix. When you have to leave 
someplace earlier than a friend who is staying behind, or even a stranger that 
you’ve struck up a conversation with, tell them O-saki ni. to display your 
thoughtfulness for the people who can’t leave the place yet. In a business 
context, like at your workplace, you can add shitsurei shimasu (shee-tsoo-
rehh shee-mah-soo) after o-saki ni. Shitsurei shimasu literally means I’ll be 
rude, but it’s a very polite way of saying goodbye to your superiors and busi­
ness clients. (Flip to Chapter 4 for more about shitsurei shimasu.)
Kanpai!
乾杯！ Kanpai! (kahn-pah-ee!) (Toast!/Cheers!)
When celebrating something, hold a glass of wine or sake and have a toast by 
saying Kanpai! Kanpai is used in almost all formal and informal gatherings in 
Japan. The one exception may be funeral and memorial services, where kenpai 
(kehn-pah-ee) or itadakimasu (ee-tah-dah-kee-mah-soo) is used instead. So the 
next time you have something to celebrate, don’t hesitate to say Kanpai!

325
 Chapter 22: Ten Phrases That Make You Sound Fluent in Japanese
Ganbatte!
がんばって！ Ganbatte! (gahn-baht-teh!) (Try your best, and good luck!)
Japanese often believe that the effort is more important than the result. 
Trying one’s best is the only way to go. When your friend is going to take an 
important exam, tell him or her Ganbatte!. And if you’re seriously studying 
Japanese, I want to tell you Ganbatte!
Shikata ga nai.
仕方がない。Shikata ga nai. (shee-kah-tah gah nah-ee.) (There’s no choice.) 
Shikata means method, so it literally means A method does not exist. 
When you’re in a difficult situation, look at all the possible solutions. If none 
of them will work well, choose a solution that you know isn’t part of the best-
case scenario and say Shikata ga nai. to convey your disappointment and 
acceptance of the given fact.
Suppose that you miss your plane home and no other flights are departing 
until tomorrow morning. You have to give up the idea of going home today. 
In such a context, say Shikata ga nai. and start looking for a hotel. Suppose 
that you can’t find a hotel and have to give up the idea of sleeping on a 
bed. Say Shikata ga nai. again and sleep on a bench at the airport. The 
expression somehow smoothes out inevitably bad situations. Life goes on. 
Shikata ga nai.
Okage-sama De.
おかげさまで。 O-kage-sama de. (oh-kah-geh-sah-mah de.) (Luckily, thanks to 
you and other people.)
If someone asks you O-genki desu ka (oh-gehn-kee deh-soo kah) (How are 
you?), answering with Genki desu (gehn-kee deh-soo) (I’m fine) is perfectly 
okay. However, you’ll sound modest, thankful, and sophisticated if you say 
O-kage-sama de. instead. The original meaning of this very modest expres­
sion is that your well-being and health are due to God and other people, 
including the person you’re talking to. By the way, how are you?

326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Tsumaranai Mono Desu Ga.
つまらないものですが。 Tsumaranai mono desu ga. (tsoo-mah-rah-nah-ee 
moh-noh deh-soo gah.) (It’s a trivial/boring item, but . . . .)
Japanese people always bring a gift when invited to other people’s houses 
for a meal. The items are usually quite expensive, but the givers always say 
Tsumaranai mono desu ga, an expression based on Japanese modesty. It’s 
just a sentence fragment that means It’s a trivial or boring item, but [please 
accept it]. Next time you go to your Japanese friend’s house for dinner, give 
him or her your gift as you say Tsumaranai mono desu ga., even if you think 
it’s an exceptionally good gift.
Yoroshiku.
宜しく。 Yoroshiku. (yoh-roh-shee-koo.) (I’m pleased to meet you./I appreci­
ate your helping me.)
Using the phrase Yoroshiku. shows your polite and modest attitude. The 
literal meaning of yoroshiku is appropriately, favorably, or as needed, but 
you can say it when you meet someone for the very first time. The concept 
behind this usage is Please treat me appropriately.; you wouldn’t want to 
say such a thing directly, but alluding to it with Yoroshiku. speaks to the 
Japanese modesty. Just don’t think about the literal meaning; use Yoroshiku. 
as an equivalent to Nice to meet you.
You can also say yoroshiku right after asking a favor of someone. The under­
lying idea is Thank you for helping me, and I hope you handle it for me appro­
priately., which roughly means I appreciate your helping me.
Taihen Desu Ne.
大変ですね。 Taihen desu ne. (tah-ee-hen deh-soo neh.) (That’s tough.)
This expression is a phrase of sympathy. Use it when your friends tell you 
about their hardships related to sickness, financial problems, relationship 
troubles, or any other kind of difficult situation that requires physical efforts 
and/or causes mental stress, worries, or financial expense. Suppose that your 
friend tells you that he has to pay for five kids to go to college. You can tell 
him Taihen desu ne.
