  General Approach 
 
The eighth edition of  Fluid Mechanics  sees some additions and deletions but no 
philosophical change. The basic outline of eleven chapters, plus appendices, remains 
the same. The triad of integral, differential, and experimental approaches is retained. 
Many problem exercises, and some fully worked examples, have been changed. The 
informal, student-oriented style is retained. A number of new photographs and fi gures 
have been added. Many new references have been added, for a total of 445. The writer 
is a fi rm believer in “further reading,” especially in the postgraduate years. 
 Learning Tools 
 
 The total number of problem exercises continues to increase, from 1089 in the fi rst 
edition, to 1683 in this eighth edition. There are approximately 20 new problems in 
each chapter. Most of these are basic end-of-chapter problems, classifi ed according 
to topic. There are also Word Problems, multiple-choice Fundamentals of Engineering 
Problems, Comprehensive Problems, and Design Projects. The appendix lists approx-
imately 700 Answers to Selected Problems. 
    
The example problems are structured in the text to follow the sequence of recom-
mended steps outlined in Section 1.7. 
  
Most of the problems in this text can be solved with a hand calculator. Some can 
even be simply explained in words. A few problems, especially in Chapters 6, 9, and 
10, involve solving complicated algebraic expressions, laborious for a hand calculator. 
Check to see if your institution has a license for equation-solving software. Here the 
writer solves complicated example problems by using the  iterative power of Microsoft 
Offi ce Excel, as illustrated, for example, in Example 6.5. For further use in your work, 
Excel also contains several hundred special mathematical functions for engineering 
and statistics. Another benefi t: Excel is  free. 
 Content Changes 
 
 There are some revisions in each chapter. 
    
Chapter 1 has been substantially revised. The pre-reviewers felt, correctly, that it was 
too long, too detailed, and at too high a level for an introduction. Former Section 1.2, 
History of Fluid Mechanics, has been shortened and moved to the end of the chapter. 
Former Section 1.3, Problem-Solving Techniques, has been moved to appear just 
before Example 1.7, where these techniques are fi rst used. Eulerian and Lagrangian 
descriptions have been moved to Chapter 4. A temperature-entropy chart for steam 
 Preface 

xii Preface
has been added, to illustrate when steam can and cannot be approximated as an ideal 
gas. Former Section 1.11, Flow Patterns, has been cut sharply and mostly moved to 
Chapter 4. Former Section 1.13, Uncertainty in Experimental Data, has been moved 
to a new Appendix E. No one teaches “uncertainty” in introductory fl uid mechanics, 
but the writer feels it is extremely important in all engineering fi elds involving exper-
imental or numerical data. 
  
Chapter 2 adds a brief discussion of the fact that pressure is a thermodynamic 
property, not a  force , has no direction, and is not a vector. The arrow, on a surface 
force caused by pressure, causes confusion for beginning students. The subsection of 
Section 2.8 entitled Stability Related to Waterline Area has been shortened to omit 
the complicated derivations. The fi nal metacenter formula is retained; the writer does 
not think it is suffi cient just to show a sketch of a fl oating body falling over. This 
book should have reference value. 
  
Chapter 3 was substantially revised in the last edition, especially by moving 
 Bernoulli’s equation to follow the linear momentum section. This time the only 
changes are improvements in the example problems. 
  
Chapter 4 now discusses the Eulerian and Lagrangian systems, moved from 
 Chapter 1. The no-slip and no-temperature-jump boundary conditions are added, with 
problem assignments. 
  
Chapter 5 explains a bit more about drag force before assigning dimensional 
 analysis problems. It retains Ipsen’s method as an interesting alternative which, of 
course, may be skipped by pi theorem adherents. 
  
Chapter 6 downplays the Moody chart a bit, suggesting that students use either 
iteration or Excel. For rough walls, the chart is awkward to read, although it gives an 
approximation for use in iteration. The author’s fancy rearrangement of pi groups to 
solve type 2, fl ow rate, and type 3, pipe diameter problems is removed from the main 
text and assigned as problems. For noncircular ducts, the hydraulic  radius  is omitted 
and moved to Chapter 10. There is a new Example 6.11, which solves for pipe 
 diameter and determines if Schedule 40 pipe is strong enough. A general discussion 
of pipe strength is added. There is a new subsection on  laminar-fl ow  minor losses, 
 appropriate for micro- and nano-tube fl ows. 
  
Chapter 7 has more treatment of vehicle drag and rolling resistance, and a rolling 
resistance coeffi cient is defi ned. There is additional discussion of the Kline-Fogelman 
airfoil, extremely popular now for model aircraft. 
  
Chapter 8 has backed off from extensive discussion of CFD methods, as proposed by 
the pre-reviewers. Only a few CFD examples are now given. The inviscid duct-expansion 
example and the implicit boundary layer method are now omitted, but the explicit method 
is retained. For airfoil theory, the writer considers thin-airfoil vortex-sheet theory to be 
obsolete and has deleted it. 
  
Chapter 9 now has a better discussion of the normal shock wave. New supersonic 
wave photographs are added. The “new trend in aeronautics” is the Air Force X-35 
Joint Strike Fighter. 
  
Chapter 10 improves the defi nition of normal depth of a channel. There is a new 
subsection on the water-channel compressible fl ow analogy, and problems are assigned 
to fi nd the oblique wave angle for supercritical water fl ow past a wedge. 
  
Chapter 11 greatly expands the discussion of wind turbines, with examples and 
problems taken from the author’s own experience. 

Preface xiii
 
Appendices B and D are unchanged. Appendix A adds a list of liquid kinematic 
viscosities to Table A.4. A few more conversion factors are added to Appendix C. 
There is a new Appendix E, Estimating Uncertainty in Experimental Data, which was 
moved from its inappropriate position in Chapter 1. The writer believes that “uncer-
tainty” is vital to reporting measurements and always insisted upon it when he was 
an engineering journal editor.

  Falls on the Nesowadnehunk Stream in Baxter State Park, Maine, which is the northern  terminus 
of the Appalachian Trail. Such fl ows, open to the atmosphere, are driven simply by gravity and 
do not depend much upon fl uid properties such as density and viscosity. They are discussed later 
in Chap. 10. To the writer, one of the joys of fl uid mechanics is that visualization of a fl uid-fl ow 
process is simple and beautiful  [Photo Credit: Design Pics/Natural Selection Robert Cable].

 Chapter 1 
 Introduction 
1.1 Preliminary Remarks
 
 Fluid mechanics is the study of fl uids either in motion (fl uid  dynamics ) or at rest (fl uid 
 statics ). Both gases and liquids are classifi ed as fl uids, and the number of fl uid engi-
neering applications is enormous: breathing, blood fl ow, swimming, pumps, fans, 
turbines, airplanes, ships, rivers, windmills, pipes, missiles, icebergs, engines, fi lters, 
jets, and sprinklers, to name a few. When you think about it, almost everything on 
this planet either is a fl uid or moves within or near a fl uid. 
  
The essence of the subject of fl uid fl ow is a judicious compromise between theory 
and experiment. Since fl uid fl ow is a branch of mechanics, it satisfi es a set of well-
documented basic laws, and thus a great deal of theoretical treatment is available. However, 
the theory is often frustrating because it applies mainly to idealized situations, which 
may be invalid in practical problems. The two chief obstacles to a workable theory are 
geometry and viscosity. The basic equations of fl uid motion (Chap. 4) are too diffi cult 
to enable the analyst to attack arbitrary geometric confi gurations. Thus most textbooks 
 concentrate on fl at plates, circular pipes, and other easy geometries. It is possible to 
apply  numerical computer techniques to complex geometries, and specialized textbooks 
are now  available to explain the new  computational fl uid dynamics  (CFD)  approximations 
and methods [1–4]. 1  This book will present many  theoretical results while keeping their 
limitations in mind.  
  
The second obstacle to a workable theory is the action of viscosity, which can be 
neglected only in certain idealized fl ows (Chap. 8). First, viscosity increases the dif-
fi culty of the basic equations, although the boundary-layer approximation found by 
Ludwig Prandtl in 1904 (Chap. 7) has greatly simplifi ed viscous-fl ow analyses. Second, 
viscosity has a destabilizing effect on all fl uids, giving rise, at frustratingly small 
velocities, to a disorderly, random phenomenon called  turbulence.  The theory of tur-
bulent fl ow is crude and heavily backed up by experiment (Chap. 6), yet it can be quite 
serviceable as an engineering estimate. This textbook only introduces the standard 
experimental correlations for turbulent time-mean fl ow. Meanwhile, there are advanced 
texts on both time-mean  turbulence and turbulence modeling  [5, 6] and on the newer, 
computer-intensive  direct numerical simulation  (DNS) of fl uctuating turbulence [7, 8]. 
 1 Numbered references appear at the end of each chapter.

4 Chapter 1 Introduction
  
Thus there is theory available for fl uid fl ow problems, but in all cases it should be 
backed up by experiment. Often the experimental data provide the main source of 
information about specifi c fl ows, such as the drag and lift of immersed bodies 
(Chap. 7). Fortunately, fl uid mechanics is a highly visual subject, with good instru-
mentation [9–11], and the use of dimensional analysis and modeling concepts (Chap. 5) 
is widespread. Thus experimentation provides a natural and easy complement to the 
theory. You should keep in mind that theory and experiment should go hand in hand 
in all studies of fl uid mechanics. 
1.2 The Concept of a Fluid
 
 From the point of view of fl uid mechanics, all matter consists of only two states, fl uid 
and solid. The difference between the two is perfectly obvious to the layperson, and 
it is an interesting exercise to ask a layperson to put this difference into words. The 
technical distinction lies with the reaction of the two to an applied shear or tangential 
stress.  A solid can resist a shear stress by a static defl ection; a fl uid ca n not . Any 
shear stress applied to a fl uid, no matter how small, will result in motion of that fl uid. 
The fl uid moves and deforms continuously as long as the shear stress is applied. As 
a corollary, we can say that a fl uid at rest must be in a state of zero shear stress, a 
state often called the hydrostatic stress condition in structural analysis. In this condi-
tion, Mohr’s circle for stress reduces to a point, and there is no shear stress on any 
plane cut through the element under stress. 
  
Given this defi nition of a fl uid, every layperson also knows that there are two 
classes of fl uids,  li q uids  and  gases.  Again the distinction is a technical one concerning 
the effect of cohesive forces. A liquid, being composed of relatively close-packed 
molecules with strong cohesive forces, tends to retain its volume and will form a free 
surface in a gravitational fi eld if unconfi ned from above. Free-surface fl ows are domi-
nated by gravitational effects and are studied in Chaps. 5 and 10. Since gas molecules 
are widely spaced with negligible cohesive forces, a gas is free to expand until it 
encounters confi ning walls. A gas has no defi nite volume, and when left to itself 
without confi nement, a gas forms an atmosphere that is essentially hydrostatic. The 
hydrostatic behavior of liquids and gases is taken up in Chap. 2. Gases cannot form 
a free surface, and thus gas fl ows are rarely concerned with gravitational effects other 
than buoyancy. 
  
Figure 1.1 illustrates a solid block resting on a rigid plane and stressed by its own 
weight. The solid sags into a static defl ection, shown as a highly exaggerated dashed 
line, resisting shear without fl ow. A free-body diagram of element  A  on the side of 
the block shows that there is shear in the block along a plane cut at an angle  θ 
through  A.  Since the block sides are unsupported, element  A  has zero stress on the 
left and right sides and compression stress  σ  5  2 p on the top and bottom. Mohr’s 
circle does not reduce to a point, and there is nonzero shear stress in the block. 
 
By contrast, the liquid and gas at rest in Fig. 1.1 require the supporting walls in 
order to eliminate shear stress. The walls exert a compression stress of  2 p and reduce 
Mohr’s circle to a point with zero shear everywhere—that is, the hydrostatic  condition. 
The liquid retains its volume and forms a free surface in the container. If the walls 
are removed, shear develops in the liquid and a big splash results. If the  container 
is  tilted, shear again develops, waves form, and the free surface seeks a horizontal 
 confi guration, pouring out over the lip if necessary. Meanwhile, the gas is unrestrained 

1.2  The Concept of a Fluid 5
and expands out of the container, fi lling all available space. Element  A  in the gas is 
also hydrostatic and exerts a compression stress  2 p on the walls. 
  
In the previous discussion, clear decisions could be made about solids, liquids, and 
gases. Most engineering fl uid mechanics problems deal with these clear cases—that 
is, the common liquids, such as water, oil, mercury, gasoline, and alcohol, and the 
common gases, such as air, helium, hydrogen, and steam, in their common tempera-
ture and pressure ranges. There are many borderline cases, however, of which you 
should be aware. Some apparently “solid” substances such as asphalt and lead resist 
shear stress for short periods but actually deform slowly and exhibit defi nite fl uid 
behavior over long periods. Other substances, notably colloid and slurry mixtures, 
resist small shear stresses but “yield” at large stress and begin to fl ow as fl uids do. 
Specialized textbooks are devoted to this study of more general deformation and fl ow, a 
fi eld called  rheology  [16]. Also, liquids and gases can coexist in two-phase mixtures, 
such as steam–water mixtures or water with entrapped air bubbles. Specialized text-
books present the analysis of such  multiphase fl ows  [17]. Finally, in some situations 
the distinction between a liquid and a gas blurs. This is the case at temperatures and

pressures above the so-called  critical point  of a substance, where only a single phase 
exists, primarily resembling a gas. As pressure increases far above the critical point, 
the gaslike substance becomes so dense that there is some resemblance to a liquid, and the 
usual thermodynamic approximations like the perfect-gas law become inaccurate. The critical 
temperature and pressure of water are  T c  5  647 K and  p c  5  219 atm  (atmosphere) 2 
so that typical problems involving water and steam are below the critical point. Air, 
being a mixture of gases, has no distinct critical point, but its principal component, 
nitrogen, has  T c  5  126 K and  p c  5  34 atm. Thus typical problems involving air are 
in the range of high temperature and low pressure where air is distinctly and defi nitely 
a gas. This text will be concerned solely with clearly identifi able liquids and gases, 
and the borderline cases just discussed will be beyond our scope.  
1.3 The Fluid as a Continuum
 
 We have already used technical terms such as  fl uid pressure and  density without a 
rigorous discussion of their defi nition. As far as we know, fl uids are aggregations of 
molecules, widely spaced for a gas, closely spaced for a liquid. The distance between 
molecules is very large compared with the molecular diameter. The molecules are not 
fi xed in a lattice but move about freely relative to each other. Thus fl uid density, or 
mass per unit volume, has no precise meaning because the number of molecules 
occupying a given volume continually changes. This effect becomes unimportant if 
the unit volume is large compared with, say, the cube of the molecular spacing, when 
the number of molecules within the volume will remain nearly constant in spite of the 
enormous interchange of particles across the boundaries. If, however, the chosen unit 
volume is too large, there could be a noticeable variation in the bulk aggregation of 
the particles. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 1.2, where the “density” as calculated 
from molecular mass  δ m  within a given volume  δ  9  is plotted versus the size of the 
unit volume. There is a limiting volume  δ  9 * below which molecular variations may 
be important and above which aggregate variations may be important. The  density  ρ  of 
a fl uid is best defi ned as

 Th e limiting volume  δ  9 * is about 10 2 9 mm 3  for all liquids and for gases at atmo-
spheric pressure. For example, 10 2 9 mm 3  of air at standard conditions contains 
approximately 3  3 10 7  molecules, which is suffi cient to defi ne a nearly constant density 
according to Eq. (1.1). Most engineering problems are concerned with physical dimensions 
much larger than this limiting volume, so that density is essentially a point function 
and fl uid properties can be thought of as varying continually in space, as sketched in 
Fig. 1.2a. Such a fl uid is called a  continuum,  which simply means that its variation in 
properties is so smooth that differential calculus can be used to analyze the substance. 
We shall assume that continuum calculus is valid for all the analyses in this book. 
Again there are borderline cases for gases at such low pressures that molecular spacing 
and mean free path 3  are comparable to, or larger than, the physical size of the system. 
This requires that the continuum approximation be dropped in favor of a molecular 
theory of rarefi ed gas fl ow [18]. In principle, all fl uid mechanics problems can be 
attacked from the molecular viewpoint, but no such attempt will be made here. Note 
that the use of continuum calculus does not preclude the possibility of discontinuous 
jumps in fl uid properties across a free surface or fl uid interface or across a shock 
wave in a compressible fl uid (Chap. 9). Our calculus in analyzing fl uid fl ow must be 
fl exible enough to handle discontinuous boundary conditions.  
1.4 Dimensions and Units
 
 A  dimension  is the measure by which a physical variable is expressed quantitatively. 
A  unit  is a particular way of attaching a number to the quantitative dimension. Thus 
length is a dimension associated with such variables as distance, displacement, width, 
defl ection, and height, while centimeters and inches are both numerical units for 
expressing length. Dimension is a powerful concept about which a splendid tool called 
 dimensional analysis  has been developed (Chap.  5), while units are the numerical 
quantity that the customer wants as the fi nal answer. 
  
In 1872 an international meeting in France proposed a treaty called the Metric 
Convention, which was signed in 1875 by 17 countries including the United States. 
It was an improvement over British systems because its use of base 10 is the founda-
tion of our number system, learned from childhood by all. Problems still remained 
because even the metric countries differed in their use of kiloponds instead of dynes 
or newtons, kilograms instead of grams, or calories instead of joules. To standardize 
the metric system, a General Conference of Weights and Measures, attended in 1960 
by 40 countries, proposed the  International System of Units  (SI). We are now under-
going a painful period of transition to SI, an adjustment that may take many more 
years to complete. The professional societies have led the way. Since July 1, 1974, 
SI units have been required by all papers published by the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, and there is a textbook explaining the SI [19]. The present text 
will use SI units together with British gravitational (BG) units. 
Primary Dimensions
 
 In fl uid mechanics there are only four  primary dimensions from which all other dimen-
sions can be derived: mass, length, time, and temperature. 4  These dimensions and 
 3 The mean distance traveled by molecules between collisions (see Prob. P1.5).
 4 If electromagnetic effects are important, a fi fth primary dimension must be included, electric current 
{ I }, whose SI unit is the ampere (A).

8 Chapter 1 Introduction
their units in both systems are given in Table 1.1. Note that the Kelvin unit uses no 
degree symbol. The braces around a symbol like { M } mean “the dimension” of mass. 
All other variables in fl uid mechanics can be expressed in terms of { M }, { L }, { T }, 
and  {Θ }. For example, acceleration has the dimensions { LT  2 2 }. The most crucial of 
these secondary dimensions is force, which is directly related to mass, length, and 
time by Newton’s second law. Force equals the time rate of change of momentum or, 
for constant mass, 
 
F 5 ma 
 (1.2)  
 From this we see that, dimensionally, { F }  5 { MLT  2 2 }. 
The International System (SI)
 
 The use of a constant of proportionality in Newton’s law, Eq.  (1.2), is avoided 
by defi ning the force unit exactly in terms of the other basic units. In the SI sys-
tem, the basic units are newtons { F }, kilograms { M }, meters { L }, and seconds 
{ T }. We defi ne 
 1 newton of force 5 1 N 5 1 kg # 1 m/s2 
 The newton is a relatively small force, about the weight of an apple (0.225 lbf ). In 
addition, the basic unit of temperature {®} in the SI system is the degree Kelvin, K. 
Use of these SI units (N, kg, m, s, K) will require no conversion factors in our 
equations. 
The British Gravitational (BG) 
System
 
 In the BG system also, a constant of proportionality in Eq. (1.2) is avoided by defi n-
ing the force unit exactly in terms of the other basic units. In the BG system, the 
basic units are pound-force { F }, slugs { M }, feet { L }, and seconds { T }. We defi ne 
 1 pound of force 5 1 lbf 5 1 slug # 1 ft/s2 
 One lbf < 4.4482 N and approximates the weight of four apples. We will use the 
abbreviation  lbf  for pound-force and  lbm  for pound-mass. The slug is a rather 
hefty  mass, equal to 32.174 lbm. The basic unit of temperature { Θ } in the BG 
system is the degree Rankine,  8 R. Recall that a temperature difference 1 K  5 1.8 8 R. 
Use of these BG units (lbf, slug, ft, s,  8 R) will require no conversion factors in our 
equations. 
Other Unit Systems
 
 There are other unit systems still in use. At least one needs no proportionality  constant: 
the CGS system (dyne, gram, cm, s, K). However, CGS units are too small for most 
applications (1 dyne  5 10 2 5 N) and will not be used here.

In the USA, some still use the English Engineering system (lbf, lbm, ft, s,  8 R), where 
the basic mass unit is the  pound of mass . Newton’s law (1.2) must be rewritten:

 The constant of proportionality,  g c , has both dimensions and a numerical value not 
equal to 1.0. The present text uses only the SI and BG systems and will not solve 
problems or examples in the English Engineering system. Because Americans still 
use them, a few problems in the text will be stated in truly awkward units: acres, 
gallons, ounces, or miles. Your assignment will be to convert these and solve in the 
SI or BG systems. 
The Principle of 
Dimensional Homogeneity
 
 In engineering and science,  all  equations must be  dimensionally homogeneous, that 
is, each additive term in an equation must have the same dimensions. For example, 
take Bernoulli’s incompressible equation, to be studied and used throughout this text: 
 p 1 1
2 ρV2 1 ρgZ 5 constant 
 Each and every term in this equation  must  have dimensions of pressure { ML 2 1 T  2 2 }. We 
will examine the dimensional homogeneity of this equation in detail in Example 1.3. 
  
A list of some important secondary variables in fl uid mechanics, with dimensions 
derived as combinations of the four primary dimensions, is given in Table 1.2. A more 
complete list of conversion factors is given in App. C.

 A body weighs 1000 lbf when exposed to a standard earth gravity  g  5  32.174 ft/s 2 . ( a ) What 
is its mass in kg? ( b ) What will the weight of this body be in N if it is exposed to the 
moon’s standard acceleration  g moon  5  1.62 m/s 2 ? ( c ) How fast will the body accelerate if a 
net force of 400 lbf is applied to it on the moon or on the earth? 

10 Chapter 1 Introduction
 Solution 
 
 We need to fi nd the ( a ) mass; ( b ) weight on the moon; and ( c ) acceleration of this body. This 
is a fairly simple example of conversion factors for differing unit systems. No property data is 
needed. The example is too low-level for a sketch. 
Part (a)

new gravitational acceleration and hence a new weight:

Part (c) 
 This part does not involve weight or gravity or location. It is simply an application of  Newton’s

 Comment (c): This acceleration would be the same on the earth or moon or anywhere. 
  
Many data in the literature are reported in inconvenient or arcane units suitable 
only to some industry or specialty or country. The engineer should convert these data 
to the SI or BG system before using them. This requires the systematic application 
of conversion factors, as in the following example. 
 EXAMPLE 1.2 
 Industries involved in viscosity measurement [27, 29] continue to use the CGS system of 
units, since centimeters and grams yield convenient numbers for many fl uids. The absolute 
viscosity ( μ ) unit is the  poise,  named after J. L. M. Poiseuille, a French physician who in 
1840 performed pioneering experiments on water fl ow in pipes; 1 poise  5  1 g/(cm-s). The 
kinematic viscosity ( ν ) unit is the  stokes,  named after G. G. Stokes, a British physicist who 
in 1845 helped develop the basic partial differential equations of fl uid momentum; 1 stokes  5  
1 cm 2 /s. Water at 20 8 C has  μ  <  0.01 poise and also  ν  <  0.01 stokes. Express these results 
in ( a ) SI and ( b ) BG units.

 •  Comments:    This was a laborious conversion that could have been shortened by using

We repeat our advice: Faced with data in unusual units, convert them immediately 
to either SI or BG units because (1) it is more professional and (2) theoretical equa-
tions in fl uid mechanics are  dime n sionally consistent  and require no further conversion 
factors when these two fundamental unit systems are used, as the following example 
shows. 
 EXAMPLE 1.3 
 A useful theoretical equation for computing the relation between pressure, velocity, and 
altitude in a steady fl ow of a nearly inviscid, nearly incompressible fl uid with negligible 
heat transfer and shaft work 5  is the  Bernoulli relation,  named after Daniel Bernoulli, who 
published a hydrodynamics textbook in 1738:

 ( a ) Show that Eq. (1) satisfi es the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which states that all 
additive terms in a physical equation must have the same dimensions. ( b ) Show that consistent 
units result without additional conversion factors in SI units. ( c ) Repeat ( b ) for BG units. 
 5 That’s an awful lot of assumptions, which need further study in Chap. 3.

12 Chapter 1 Introduction
 Solution 
 
Part (a)  
We can express Eq. (1) dimensionally, using braces, by entering the dimensions of each term 
from Table 1.2: 
  5ML 21T 226 5 5ML 21T 226 1 5ML 2365L2T 226 1 5ML 2365LT 
 2265L6 
 
 5 5ML
 21T 
 226 for all terms
 
 Ans.  ( a ) 
 
Part (b) 
Enter the SI units for each quantity from Table 1.2: 
 
5N/m26 5 5N/m26 1 5kg/m365m2/s26 1 5kg/m365m/s265m6 
 
 5 5N/m26 1 5kg/(m # s2)6
 
 The right-hand side looks bad until we remember from Eq. (1.3) that 1 kg  5 1 N ∙ s 2 /m. 
 
 5kg/(m # s2)6 5
5N # s2/m6
5m # s26
5 5N/m26 
 Ans.  ( b ) 
 Thus all terms in Bernoulli’s equation will have units of pascals, or newtons per square 
meter, when SI units are used. No conversion factors are needed, which is true of all theo-
retical equations in fl uid mechanics. 
 
Part (c) 
Introducing BG units for each term, we have 
 5lbf/ft26 5 5lbf/ft26 1 5slugs/ft365ft2/s26 1 5slugs/ft365ft/s265ft6 
 
 5 5lbf/ft26 1 5slugs/(ft # s2)6
 
 But, from Eq. (1.3), 1 slug  5 1 lbf ∙ s 2 /ft, so that 
 
5slugs/(ft # s2)6 5
5lbf # s2/ft6
5ft # s26
5 5lbf/ft26 
 Ans.  ( c ) 
 All terms have the unit of pounds-force per square foot. No conversion factors are needed 
in the BG system either. 
  
There is still a tendency in English-speaking countries to use pound-force per 
square inch as a pressure unit because the numbers are more manageable. For exam-
ple, standard atmospheric pressure is 14.7 lbf/in 2  5  2116 lbf/ft 2  5  101,300 Pa. The 
pascal is a small unit because the newton is less than 1
4 lbf and a square meter is a 
very large area. 
 Consistent Units
 
Note that not only must all (fl uid) mechanics equations be dimensionally homoge-
neous, one must also use  consistent units;  that is, each additive term must have 
the same units. There is no trouble doing this with the SI and BG systems, as 
in Example 1.3, but woe unto those who try to mix colloquial English units. For 
example, in Chap. 9, we often use the assumption of steady adiabatic compressible 
gas fl ow: 
 h 1 1
2V 2 5 constant 

1.4  Dimensions and Units 13
 where  h  is the fl uid enthalpy and  V 2 /2 is its kinetic energy per unit mass. Colloquial 
thermodynamic tables might list  h  in units of British thermal units per pound mass 
(Btu/lb), whereas  V  is likely used in ft/s. It is completely erroneous to add Btu/lb to 
ft 2 /s 2 . The proper unit for  h in this case is ft ∙ lbf/slug, which is identical to ft 2 /s 2 . The 
conversion factor is 1 Btu/lb  < 25,040 ft 2 /s 2  5 25,040 ft ∙ lbf/slug. 
 Homogeneous versus 
Dimensionally Inconsistent 
Equations
 
All theoretical equations in mechanics (and in other physical sciences) are   dimensionally 
homogen e ous;  that is, each additive term in the equation has the same dimensions. 
However, the reader should be warned that many empirical formulas in the  engineering 
literature, arising primarily from correlations of data, are dimensionally inconsistent. 
Their units cannot be reconciled simply, and some terms may contain hidden vari-
ables. An example is the formula that pipe valve manufacturers cite for liquid volume 
fl ow rate  Q (m 3 /s) through a partially open valve: 
 Q 5 CVa ¢p
SGb
1/2
 
 where  D p  is the pressure drop across the valve and SG is the specifi c gravity of the 
liquid (the ratio of its density to that of water). The quantity  C V  is the  valve fl ow 
coeffi cient,  which manufacturers tabulate in their valve brochures. Since SG is 
dimensionless {1}, we see that this formula is totally inconsistent, with one side 
being a fl ow rate { L 3 / T } and the other being the square root of a pressure drop 
{ M 1/2 / L 1/2 T }. It follows that  C V  must have dimensions, and rather odd ones at that: 
{ L 7/2 / M 1/2 }. Nor is the resolution of this discrepancy clear, although one hint is that 
the values of  C V  in the literature increase nearly as the square of the size of the 
valve. The presentation of experimental data in homogeneous form is the subject of 
 dime n sional analysis  (Chap. 5). There we shall learn that a homogeneous form for 
the valve fl ow relation is

 where  ρ  is the liquid density and  A  the area of the valve opening. The  discharge 
coeffi cient  C d  is dimensionless and changes only moderately with valve size. Please 
believe—until we establish the fact in Chap. 5—that this latter is a  much  better for-
mulation of the data. 
  
Meanwhile, we conclude that dimensionally inconsistent equations, though they 
occur in engineering practice, are misleading and vague and even dangerous, in the 
sense that they are often misused outside their range of applicability. 
 Convenient Prefi xes in 
Powers of 10
 
Engineering results often are too small or too large for the common units, with too 
many zeros one way or the other. For example, to write  p  5 114,000,000 Pa is long 
and awkward. Using the prefi x “M” to mean 10 6 , we convert this to a concise  p  5 
114 MPa (megapascals). Similarly,  t  5  0.000000003 s is a proofreader’s nightmare 
compared to the equivalent  t  5  3 ns (nanoseconds). Such prefi xes are common and 
convenient, in both the SI and BG systems. A complete list is given in Table 1.3.

14 Chapter 1 Introduction
 EXAMPLE 1.4 
 In 1890 Robert Manning, an Irish engineer, proposed the following empirical formula for 
the average velocity  V in uniform fl ow due to gravity down an open channel (BG units): 
 
V 5 1.49
n R2/3S1/2 
 (1) 
 where  R  5 hydraulic radius of channel (Chaps. 6 and 10) 
 
 S  5 channel slope (tangent of angle that bottom makes with horizontal) 
 
 n  5 Manning’s roughness factor (Chap. 10) 
 and  n is a constant for a given surface condition for the walls and bottom of the channel. 
( a ) Is Manning’s formula dimensionally consistent? ( b ) Equation (1) is commonly taken to 
be valid in BG units with  n taken as dimensionless. Rewrite it in SI form. 
 Solution 
 •  Assumption:  The channel slope  S  is the tangent of an angle and is thus a dimensionless 
ratio with the dimensional notation {1}—that is, not containing  M ,  L , or  T . 
 •  Approach (a):  Rewrite the dimensions of each term in Manning’s equation, using 
 brackets {}: 
 5V6 5 e 1.49
n
f 5R2/36 5S1/26 or e L
T f 5 e 1.49
n
f 5L2/36 516 
 This formula is incompatible unless {1.49/ n }  5 { L 1/3 / T }. If  n  is dimensionless (and 
it is never listed with units in textbooks), the number 1.49 must carry the dimensions of 
{ L 1/3 / T }. 
 Ans.  ( a ) 
 •  Comment (a):  Formulas whose numerical coeffi cients have units can be disastrous for 
engineers working in a different system or another fl uid. Manning’s formula, though 
popular, is inconsistent both dimensionally and physically and is valid only for water fl ow 
with certain wall roughnesses. The effects of water viscosity and density are hidden in 
the numerical value 1.49. 
 •  Approach (b): Part ( a ) showed that 1.49 has dimensions. If the formula is valid in BG 
units, then it must equal 1.49 ft 1/3 /s. By using the SI conversion for length, we obtain 
 (1.49 ft1/3/s)(0.3048 m/ft)1/3 5 1.00 m1/3/s 
 Therefore, Manning’s inconsistent formula changes form when converted to the SI system: 
 
SI units: V 5 1.0
n  R2/3S1/2 
 Ans.  ( b ) 
 with  R in meters and  V in meters per second. 
 •  Comment (b):  Actually, we misled you: This is the way Manning, a metric user, fi rst 
proposed the formula. It was later converted to BG units. Such dimensionally inconsistent 
formulas are dangerous and should either be reanalyzed or treated as having very limited 
application. 

1.6  Thermodynamic Properties of a Fluid 15
  
In a given fl ow situation, the determination, by experiment or theory, of the properties 
of the fl uid as a function of position and time is considered to be the  solution  to the 
problem. In almost all cases, the emphasis is on the space–time distribution of the 
fl uid properties. One rarely keeps track of the actual fate of the specifi c fl uid particles. 
This treatment of properties as continuum-fi eld functions distinguishes fl uid mechan-
ics from solid mechanics, where we are more likely to be interested in the trajectories 
of individual particles or systems. 
 The Velocity Field
 
Foremost among the properties of a fl ow is the velocity fi eld  V ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ). In fact, 
determining the velocity is often tantamount to solving a fl ow problem, since other 
properties follow directly from the velocity fi eld. Chapter 2 is devoted to the calcula-
tion of the pressure fi eld once the velocity fi eld is known. Books on heat transfer (for 
example, Ref. 20) are largely devoted to fi nding the temperature fi eld from known 
velocity fi elds. 
  
In general, velocity is a vector function of position and time and thus has three 
components  u ,  v , and  w , each a scalar fi eld in itself: 
 
V(x, y, z, t) 5 iu(x, y, z, t) 1 jv(x, y, z, t) 1 kw(x, y, z, t)  
 (1.4) 
 The use of  u ,  v , and  w  instead of the more logical component notation  V x ,  V y , and  V z 
is the result of an almost unbreakable custom in fl uid mechanics. Much of this text-
book, especially Chaps. 4, 7, 8, and 9, is concerned with fi nding the distribution of 
the velocity vector  V for a variety of practical fl ows. 
 The Acceleration Field
 
The acceleration vector,  a  5 d V / dt , occurs in Newton’s law for a fl uid and thus is 
very important. In order to follow a particle in the Eulerian frame of reference, the 
fi nal result for acceleration is nonlinear and quite complicated. Here we only give the 
formula: 
 
a 5 dV
dt 5 0V
0t 1 u 0V
0x 1 v 0V
0y 1 w 0V
0z
 
 (1.5) 
 where ( u, v, w ) are the velocity components from Eq. (1.4). We shall study this for-
mula in detail in Chap. 4. The last three terms in Eq. (1.5) are nonlinear products and 
greatly complicate the analysis of general fl uid motions, especially viscous fl ows. 
 1.6 Thermodynamic Properties 
of a Fluid
 
While the velocity fi eld  V  is the most important fl uid property, it interacts closely 
with the thermodynamic properties of the fl uid. We have already introduced into the 
discussion the three most common such properties: 
 1. Pressure  p 
 2. Density  ρ 
 3. Temperature  T 
1.5 Properties of the 
Velocity Field

16 Chapter 1 Introduction
 These three are constant companions of the velocity vector in fl ow analyses. Four 
other intensive thermodynamic properties become important when work, heat, and 
energy balances are treated (Chaps. 3 and 4): 
 4. Internal energy  û 
 5. Enthalpy  h  5  û  1 p / ρ 
 6. Entropy  s 
 7. Specifi c heats  c p and  c v 
 In addition, friction and heat conduction effects are governed by the two so-called 
 transport pro p erties: 
 8. Coeffi cient of viscosity  μ 
 9. Thermal conductivity  k 
 All nine of these quantities are true thermodynamic properties that are determined by 
the thermodynamic condition or  state  of the fl uid. For example, for a single-phase 
substance such as water or oxygen, two basic properties such as pressure and tem-
perature are suffi cient to fi x the value of all the others: 
 ρ 5 ρ(p, T)   h 5 h(p, T)   μ 5 μ(p, T) 
 and so on for every quantity in the list. Note that the specifi c volume, so important 
in thermodynamic analyses, is omitted here in favor of its inverse, the density  ρ . 
  
Recall that thermodynamic properties describe the state of a  system —that is, a 
collection of matter of fi xed identity that interacts with its surroundings. In most cases 
here the system will be a small fl uid element, and all properties will be assumed to 
be continuum properties of the fl ow fi eld:  ρ  5  ρ ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ), and so on. 
  
Recall also that thermodynamics is normally concerned with  static  systems, whereas 
fl uids are usually in variable motion with constantly changing properties. Do the 
properties retain their meaning in a fl uid fl ow that is technically not in equilibrium? 
The answer is yes, from a statistical argument. In gases at normal pressure (and even 
more so for liquids), an enormous number of molecular collisions occur over a very 
short distance of the order of 1  μ m, so that a fl uid subjected to sudden changes rapidly 
adjusts itself toward equilibrium. We therefore assume that all the thermodynamic 
properties just listed exist as point functions in a fl owing fl uid and follow all the laws 
and state relations of ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics. There are, of course, 
important nonequilibrium effects such as chemical and nuclear reactions in fl owing 
fl uids, which are not treated in this text. 
 Pressure
 
Pressure is the (compression) stress at a point in a static fl uid (Fig.  1.3). Next to 
velocity, the pressure  p  is the most dynamic variable in fl uid mechanics. Differences 
or  gradients  in pressure often drive a fl uid fl ow, especially in ducts. In low-speed 
fl ows, the actual magnitude of the pressure is often not important, unless it drops so 
low as to cause vapor bubbles to form in a liquid. For convenience, we set many such 
problem assignments at the level of 1 atm  5  2116 lbf/ft 2  5  101,300 Pa. High-speed 
(compressible) gas fl ows (Chap. 9), however, are indeed sensitive to the magnitude 
of pressure. 

1.6  Thermodynamic Properties of a Fluid 17
 Temperature
 
Temperature  T  is related to the internal energy level of a fl uid. It may vary consider-
ably during high-speed fl ow of a gas (Chap. 9). Although engineers often use Celsius 
or Fahrenheit scales for convenience, many applications in this text require  absolute 
(Kelvin or Rankine) temperature scales: 
  °R 5 °F 1 459.69 
  K 5 °C 1 273.16 
 If temperature differences are strong,  heat transfer  may be important [20], but our 
concern here is mainly with dynamic effects. 
 Density
 
The density of a fl uid, denoted by  ρ  (lowercase Greek rho), is its mass per unit 
 volume. Density is highly variable in gases and increases nearly proportionally to the 
pressure level. Density in liquids is nearly constant; the density of water (about 
1000 kg/m 3 ) increases only 1 percent if the pressure is increased by a factor of 220. 
Thus most liquid fl ows are treated analytically as nearly “incompressible.” 
  
In general, liquids are about three orders of magnitude more dense than gases at 
atmospheric pressure. The heaviest common liquid is mercury, and the lightest gas is 
hydrogen. Compare their densities at 20 8 C and 1 atm: 
 Mercury: ρ 5 13,580 kg/m3   Hydrogen: ρ 5 0.0838 kg/m3 
 They differ by a factor of 162,000! Thus, the physical parameters in various liquid 
and gas fl ows might vary considerably. The differences are often resolved by the use 
of  dimensional analysis  (Chap. 5). Other fl uid densities are listed in Tables A.3 and 
A.4 (in App. A), and in Ref. 21. 
Specifi c Weight
 
 The  specifi c weight  of a fl uid, denoted by  γ  (lowercase Greek gamma), is its weight 
per unit volume. Just as a mass has a weight  W  5  mg , density and specifi c weight 
are simply related by gravity: 
 
γ 5 ρg 
 (1.6) 
 The units of  γ  are weight per unit volume, in lbf/ft 3  or N/m 3 . In standard earth grav-
ity,  g  5  32.174 ft/s 2  5  9.807 m/s 2 . Thus, for example, the specifi c weights of air and 
water at 20 8 C and 1 atm are approximately 
  γair 5 (1.205 kg/m3)(9.807 m/s2) 5 11.8 N/m3 5 0.0752 lbf/ft3 
 γwater 5 (998 kg/m3)(9.807 m/s2) 5 9790 N/m3 5 62.4 lbf/ft3
 
 Specifi c weight is very useful in the hydrostatic pressure applications of Chap.  2. 
Specifi c weights of other fl uids are given in Tables A.3 and A.4. 
 Specifi c Gravity
 
Specifi c gravity,  denoted by SG, is the ratio of a fl uid density to a standard reference 
fl uid, usually water at 4 8 C (for liquids) and air (for gases): 
 
SGgas 5

18 Chapter 1 Introduction
 For example, the specifi c gravity of mercury (Hg) is SG Hg  5 13,580/1000  < 13.6. 
Engineers fi nd these dimensionless ratios easier to remember than the actual numerical 
values of density of a variety of fl uids. 
Potential and Kinetic Energies
 
In thermostatics the only energy in a substance is that stored in a system by molecular 
activity and molecular bonding forces. This is commonly denoted as  internal energy  û . 
A commonly accepted adjustment to this static situation for fl uid fl ow is to add two 
more energy terms that arise from newtonian mechanics: potential energy and kinetic 
energy. 
  
The potential energy equals the work required to move the system of mass  m from 
the origin to a position vector  r  5  i x  1  j y  1  k z  against a gravity fi eld  g.  Its value 
is  2 m g  ?  r,  or  2 g  ?  r  per unit mass. The kinetic energy equals the work required to 
change the speed of the mass from zero to velocity  V . Its value is 1
2 mV 2 or 1
2 V 2 per unit 
mass. Then by common convention the total stored energy  e  per unit mass in fl uid 
mechanics is the sum of three terms: 
e 5 uˆ 1 1
2V 2 1 (–g ? r) 
 (1.8)
 Also, throughout this book we shall defi ne  z  as upward, so that  g  5  2 g k  and  g  ?  r   5
2 gz . Then Eq. (1.8) becomes 
e 5 uˆ 1 1
2V 2 1 gz 
 (1.9)
 The molecular internal energy  û is a function of  T and  p for the single-phase pure 
substance, whereas the potential and kinetic energies are kinematic quantities. 
State Relations for Gases
 
Thermodynamic properties are found both theoretically and experimentally to be 
related to each other by state relations that differ for each substance. As mentioned, 
we shall confi ne ourselves here to single-phase pure substances, such as water in its 
liquid phase. The second most common fl uid, air, is a mixture of gases, but since the 
mixture ratios remain nearly constant between 160 and 2200 K, in this temperature 
range air can be considered to be a pure substance. 
  
All gases at high temperatures and low pressures (relative to their critical point) 
are in good agreement with the  perfect-gas law 
p 5 ρRT  R 5 cp 2 cv 5 gas constant  
 (1.10)
 where the specifi c heats  c p and  c v are defi ned in Eqs. (1.14) and (1.15). 
  
Since Eq. (1.10) is dimensionally consistent,  R  has the same dimensions as specifi c 
heat, { L 2 T 2 2 Θ 2 1 }, or velocity squared per temperature unit (kelvin or degree 
Rankine). Each gas has its own constant  R , equal to a universal constant  Λ divided 
by the molecular weight

 where  Λ  5  49,700 ft-lbf/(slugmol ∙  8 R)  5  8314 J/(kmol ∙ K). Most applications in 
this book are for air, whose molecular weight is  M  5 28.97/mol: 
 Rair 5 49,700 ft # lbf/(slugmol # °R)

5 1716 ft # lbf

 Standard atmospheric pressure is 2116 lbf/ft 2  5  2116 slug/(ft ∙ s 2 ), and standard tem-
perature is 60 8 F  5 520 8 R. Thus standard air density is 
 
ρair 5

31716 ft2/(s2 # °R) 4(520°R) 5 0.00237 slug/ft3 5 1.22 kg/m3 
 (1.13) 
 This is a nominal value suitable for problems. For other gases, see Table A.4. 
  
Most of the common gases—oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, argon—are nearly 
ideal. This is not so true for steam, whose simplifi ed temperature-entropy chart is shown 
in Fig. 1.3. Unless you are sure that the steam temperature is “high” and the pressure 
“low,” it is best to use the Steam Tables to make accurate calculations. 
  
One proves in thermodynamics that Eq. (1.10) requires that the internal molecular 
energy  û  of a perfect gas vary only with temperature:  û  5  û ( T  ). Therefore, the specifi c 
heat  c v also varies only with temperature:

1.6  Thermodynamic Properties of a Fluid 21
 
Many fl ow problems involve steam. Typical steam operating conditions are often 
close to the critical point, so that the perfect-gas approximation is inaccurate. Then we 
must turn to the steam tables, either in tabular or CD-ROM form [23] or as online 
software [24]. Most online steam tables require a license fee, but the  writer, in 
 Example 1.5 that follows, suggests a free online source. Sometimes the error of using 
the perfect-gas law for steam can moderate, as the following  example shows. 
 EXAMPLE 1.5 
 Estimate  ρ and  c p of steam at 100 lbf/in 2 and 400 8 F, in English units, ( a ) by the perfect-gas 
approximation and ( b ) by the ASME Steam Tables [23] .
 Solution 
 •  Approach (a) — the perfect-gas law:     Although steam is not an ideal gas, we can est  i  mate 
these properties with moderate accuracy from Eqs. (1.10) and (1.17). First convert pre  s sure 
from 100 lbf/in  2   to 14,400 lbf/ft  2  , and use absolute temperature, (400  8 F  1  460)  5  860 8 R. 
Then we need the gas constant for steam, in English units. From Table A.4, the  molecular 
weight of H 2 O is 18.02, whence

 •  Approach (b)—tables or software :  One can either read the ASME Steam Tables [23] or 
use online software. Online software, such as [24], calculates the properties of steam 
without reading a table. Most of these require a license fee, which your institution may 
or may not possess. For work at home, the writer has found success with this free com-
mercial online site: 
 www.spiraxsarco.com/esc/SH_Properties.aspx 
 The software calculates superheated steam properties, as required in this example. The Spirax 
Sarco Company makes many types of steam equipment: boilers, condensers, valves, pumps, 
regulators. This site provides many steam properties—density, specifi c heat, enthalpy, speed 
of sound—in many different unit systems. Here we need the density and specifi c heat of steam 
at 100 lbf/in 2  and 400 8 F. You enter these two inputs and it will calculate not only  ρ  and  c p 
but also many other properties of interest, in English or metric units. The software results are: 
 
 ρ(100 lbf/in2, 400°F) 5 0.2027 lbm/ft3 5 3.247 kg/m3

 cp(100 lbf/in2, 400°F) 5 0.5289 Btu/(lbm-F) 5 2215 J/(kg-K) 
 Ans . ( b ) 

22 Chapter 1 Introduction
 Comments:    These are quite accurate and compare well to other steam tables. The perfect 
gas estimate of  ρ  is 4 percent low, and the estimate of  c p  is 9 percent low. The chief reason for 
the discrepancy is that this temperature and pressure are rather close to the critical point and 
saturation line of steam. At higher temperatures and lower pressures, say, 800 8 F and 50 lbf/in 2 , 
the perfect-gas law has an accuracy of about  61 percent. See Fig. 1.3. 
  
Again let us warn that English units (psia, lbm, Btu) are awkward and must be converted 
to SI or BG units in almost all fl uid mechanics formulas. 
 State Relations for Liquids
 
The writer knows of no “perfect-liquid law” comparable to that for gases. Liquids are 
nearly incompressible and have a single, reasonably constant specifi c heat. Thus an 
idealized state relation for a liquid is 
  
 ρ < const    cp < cv < const    dh < cp dT 
 (1.18) 
 Most of the fl ow problems in this book can be attacked with these simple assumptions. 
Water is normally taken to have a density of 998 kg/m 3  and a specifi c heat  c p  5 
4210 m 2 /(s 2 ∙ K). The steam tables may be used if more accuracy is required. 
  
The density of a liquid usually decreases slightly with temperature and increases 
moderately with pressure. If we neglect the temperature effect, an empirical pressure– 
density relation for a liquid is 
 
p
pa
< (B 1 1) a ρ
ρa
b
n
2 B 
 (1.19) 
 where  B  and  n  are dimensionless parameters that vary slightly with temperature and 
 p a  and  ρ a  are standard atmospheric values. Water can be fi tted approximately to the 
values  B  < 3000 and  n  < 7. 
 
Seawater is a variable mixture of water and salt and thus requires three thermody-
namic properties to defi ne its state. These are normally taken as pressure, temperature, 
and the  salinity  Sˆ, defi ned as the weight of the dissolved salt divided by the weight 
of the mixture. The average salinity of seawater is 0.035, usually written as 35 parts 
per 1000, or 35 ‰. The average density of seawater is 2.00 slugs/ft 3  < 1030 kg/m 3 . 
Strictly speaking, seawater has three specifi c heats, all approximately equal to the

 1.7 Viscosity and Other 
Secondary Properties
 
The quantities such as pressure, temperature, and density discussed in the previous 
section are  primary  thermodynamic variables characteristic of any system. Certain 
secondary variables also characterize specifi c fl uid mechanical behavior. The most 
important of these is viscosity, which relates the local stresses in a moving fl uid to 
the strain rate of the fl uid element. 
 Viscosity
 
Viscosity is a quantitative measure of a fl uid’s resistance to fl ow. More specifi cally, it 
determines the fl uid strain rate that is generated by a given applied shear stress. We can 
easily move through air, which has very low viscosity. Movement is more diffi cult in 
water, which has 50 times higher viscosity. Still more resistance is found in SAE 30 oil, 
which is 300 times more viscous than water. Try to slide your hand through glycerin, 
which is fi ve times more viscous than SAE 30 oil, or blackstrap molasses, another factor 
of fi ve higher than glycerin. Fluids may have a vast range of viscosities. 
  
Consider a fl uid element sheared in one plane by a single shear stress  τ , as in 
Fig. 1.5 a . The shear strain angle  δθ  will continuously grow with time as long as the 
stress  τ  is maintained, the upper surface moving at speed  δ u  larger than the lower. 
Such common fl uids as water, oil, and air show a linear relation between applied shear 
and resulting strain rate: 
 
τ r δθ
δt  
 (1.20) 

24 Chapter 1 Introduction
 From the geometry of Fig. 1.5 a , we see that 
tan δθ 5 δu δt
δy  
 (1.21)
 In the limit of infi nitesimal changes, this becomes a relation between shear strain rate 
and velocity gradient: 
dθ
dt 5 du
dy 
 (1.22)
 From Eq. (1.20), then, the applied shear is also proportional to the velocity gradi-
ent for the common linear fl uids. The constant of proportionality is the viscosity 
coefficient  μ : 
τ 5 μdθ
dt 5 μdu
dy  
 (1.23)
 Equation (1.23) is dimensionally consistent; therefore  μ  has dimensions of stress–time: 
{ FT / L 2 } or { M /( LT  )}. The BG unit is slugs per foot-second, and the SI unit is kilo-
grams per meter-second. The linear fl uids that follow Eq. (1.23) are called  newtonian 
fl uids, after Sir Isaac Newton, who fi rst postulated this resistance law in 1687. 
  
We do not really care about the strain angle  θ ( t ) in fl uid mechanics, concentrating 
instead on the velocity distribution  u ( y ), as in Fig. 1.5 b . We shall use Eq. (1.23) in 
Chap. 4 to derive a differential equation for fi nding the velocity distribution  u ( y )—
and, more generally,  V ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t )—in a viscous fl uid. Figure 1.5 b illustrates a shear 
layer, or  boundary layer,  near a solid wall. The shear stress is proportional to the slope 
of the velocity profi le and is greatest at the wall. Further, at the wall, the velocity  u is 
zero relative to the wall: This is called the  no-slip condition and is characteristic of 
all viscous fl uid fl ows. 
  
The viscosity of newtonian fl uids is a true thermodynamic property and varies with 
temperature and pressure. At a given state ( p ,  T  ) there is a vast range of values among 
the common fl uids. Table 1.4 lists the viscosity of eight fl uids at standard pressure 
and temperature. There is a variation of six orders of magnitude from hydrogen up 
to glycerin. Thus there will be wide differences between fl uids subjected to the same 
applied stresses.

1.7  Viscosity and Other Secondary Properties 25
  
Generally speaking, the viscosity of a fl uid increases only weakly with pressure. For 
example, increasing  p  from 1 to 50 atm will increase  μ  of air only 10 percent. Tem-
perature, however, has a strong effect, with  μ increasing with  T for gases and decreasing 
for liquids. Figure A.1 (in App. A) shows this temperature variation for various common 
fl uids. It is customary in most engineering work to neglect the pressure variation. 
  
The variation  μ ( p ,  T  ) for a typical fl uid is nicely shown by Fig. 1.6, from Ref. 25, 
which normalizes the data with the  critical-point state ( μ c ,  p c ,  T c ). This behavior, 
called the  principle of corr e sponding states,  is characteristic of all fl uids, but the 
actual numerical values are uncertain to  6 20 percent for any given fl uid. For example, 
values of  μ ( T  ) for air at 1 atm, from Table A.2, fall about 8 percent low compared 
to the “low-density limit” in Fig. 1.6. 
  
Note in Fig. 1.6 that changes with temperature occur very rapidly near the critical 
point. In general, critical-point measurements are extremely diffi cult and uncertain.

 where  V  and  L  are characteristic velocity and length scales of the fl ow. The second 
form of Re illustrates that the ratio of  μ  to  ρ  has its own name, the  kinematic  viscosity: 
 
ν 5 μ
ρ 
 (1.25) 
 It is called kinematic because the mass units cancel, leaving only the dimensions 
{ L 2 / T }. 
  
Generally, the fi rst thing a fl uids engineer should do is estimate the Reynolds 
number range of the fl ow under study. Very low Re indicates viscous  creeping motion, 
where inertia effects are negligible. Moderate Re implies a smoothly varying  laminar 
fl ow. High Re probably spells  turbulent fl ow, which is slowly varying in the time-
mean but has superimposed strong random high-frequency fl uctuations. Explicit 
numerical values for low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers cannot be stated 
here. They depend on fl ow geometry and will be discussed in Chaps. 5 through 7. 
  
Table 1.4 also lists values of  ν  for the same eight fl uids. The pecking order changes 
considerably, and mercury, the heaviest, has the smallest viscosity relative to its own 
weight. All gases have high  ν  relative to thin liquids such as gasoline, water, and 
alcohol. Oil and glycerin still have the highest  ν , but the ratio is smaller. For given 
values of  V and  L in a fl ow, these fl uids exhibit a spread of four orders of magnitude 
in the Reynolds number. 
 Flow between Plates
 
A classic problem is the fl ow induced between a fi xed lower plate and an upper plate 
moving steadily at velocity  V , as shown in Fig. 1.7. The clearance between plates is 
 h , and the fl uid is newtonian and does not slip at either plate. If the plates are large, 
this steady shearing motion will set up a velocity distribution  u ( y ), as shown, with 
 v   5  w  5  0. The fl uid acceleration is zero everywhere. 
 
With zero acceleration and assuming no pressure variation in the fl ow direction, 
you should show that a force balance on a small fl uid element leads to the result that 
the shear stress is constant throughout the fl uid. Then Eq. (1.23) becomes

1.7  Viscosity and Other Secondary Properties 27
 The velocity distribution is linear, as shown in Fig.  1.7, and the constants  a  and  b 
can be evaluated from the no-slip condition at the upper and lower walls: 
 u 5 e0 5 a 1 b (0)   at y 5 0
V 5 a 1 b (h)  at y 5 h 
 Hence  a  5 0 and  b  5  V / h . Then the velocity profi le between the plates is given by 
 
u 5 V y

 (1.26) 
 as indicated in Fig. 1.7. Turbulent fl ow (Chap. 6) does not have this shape. 
 
Although viscosity has a profound effect on fl uid motion, the actual viscous stresses 
are quite small in magnitude even for oils, as shown in the next example. 
 Problem-Solving Techniques
 
Fluid fl ow analysis is packed with problems to be solved. The present text has more 
than 1700 problem assignments. Solving a large number of these is a key to learning 
the subject. One must deal with equations, data, tables, assumptions, unit systems, 
and solution schemes. The degree of diffi culty will vary, and we urge you to sample 
the whole spectrum of assignments, with or without the answers in the Appendix. 
Here are the recommended steps for problem solution: 
 1. Read the problem and restate it with your summary of the results desired. 
 2. From tables or charts, gather the needed property data: density, viscosity, etc. 
 3. Make sure you understand what is  asked.  Students are apt to answer the 
wrong question—for exa  m  ple, pressure instead of pressure gradient, lift force 
instead of drag force, or mass fl ow instead of volume fl ow. Read the 
problem carefully.  
 4. Make a detailed,  labeled  sketch of the system or control volume needed. 
 5. Think carefully and list your  assumptions.  You must decide if the fl ow is 
steady or unsteady, co  m  pressible or incompressible, viscous or inviscid, and 
whether a control volume or partial differential equations are needed.  
 6. Find an algebraic sol u tion if possible. Then, if a numerical value is needed, use 
either the SI or BG unit systems reviewed in Sec. 1.4.  
 7. Report your solution,  labeled,  with the proper units and the proper number of 
signifi cant fi gures (us u ally two or three) that the data uncertainty allows. 
 We shall follow these steps, where appropriate, in our example problems. 
 EXAMPLE 1.7 
 Suppose that the fl uid being sheared in Fig. 1.7 is SAE 30 oil at 20 8 C. Compute the shear 
stress in the oil if  V  5 3 m/s and  h  5 2 cm. 
 Solution 
 •  System sketch:  This is shown earlier in Fig. 1.7. 
 •  Assumptions:  Linear velocity profi le, laminar newtonian fl uid, no slip at either plate surface. 

28 Chapter 1 Introduction
 •   Approach: The analysis of Fig. 1.7 leads to Eq. (1.26) for laminar fl ow. 
 •   Property values: From Table 1.4 for SAE 30 oil, the oil viscosity  μ  5 0.29 kg/(m-s). 
 •   Solution steps: In Eq. (1.26), the only unknown is the fl uid shear stress: 
 
τ 5 μV
h 5 a0.29 kg
m # sb (3 m/s)
(0.02 m) 5 43.5 kg # m/s2
m2
5 43.5 N
m2 < 44Pa 
 Ans. 
 •  Comments:  Note the unit identities, 1 kg-m/s 2  ;  1 N and 1 N/m 2  ;  1 Pa. Although oil 
is very viscous, this shear stress is modest, about 2400 times less than atmospheric pres-
sure. Viscous stresses in gases and thin (watery) liquids are even smaller. 
 Variation of Viscosity 
with Temperature
 
Temperature has a strong effect and pressure a moderate effect on viscosity. The viscosity 
of gases and most liquids increases slowly with pressure. Water is anomalous in showing 
a very slight decrease below 30 8 C. Since the change in viscosity is only a few percent 
up to 100 atm, we shall neglect pressure effects in this book. 
  
Gas viscosity increases with temperature. Two common approximations are the 
power law and the Sutherland law:

 (1.27) 
 where  μ 0  is a known viscosity at a known absolute temperature  T 0 (usually 273 K). 
The constants  n  and  S  are fi t to the data, and both formulas are adequate over a wide 
range of temperatures. For air,  n  <  0.7 and  S  <  110 K  5 199 8 R. Other values are 
given in Ref. 26. 
  
Liquid viscosity decreases with temperature and is roughly exponential,  μ  <  ae 2 bT ; 
but a better fi t is the empirical result that ln  μ  is quadratic in 1/ T,  where  T  is absolute 
temperature:

 (1.28) 
 For water, with  T 0  5  273.16 K,  μ 0  5  0.001792 kg/(m ∙ s), suggested values are 
 a   5  2 1.94,  b  5  2 4.80, and  c  5  6.74, with accuracy about  6 1 percent. The viscos-
ity of water is tabulated in Table A.1. For further viscosity data, see Refs. 21, 28, 
and 29. 
 Nonnewtonian Fluids
 
Fluids that do not follow the linear law of Eq.  (1.23) are called  nonnewtonian and 
are treated in books on  rheology  [16]. Figure 1.8 a  compares some examples to a 
newtonian fl uid. For the nonlinear curves, the slope at any point is called the  apparent 
viscosity . 

1.7  Viscosity and Other Secondary Properties 29
 Dilatant. This fl uid is  shear-thickening,  increasing its resistance with increasing strain 
rate. Examples are suspensions of corn starch or sand in water. The classic case is 
 quicksand, which stiffens up if one thrashes about. 
 Pseudoplastic. A  shear-thinning fl uid is less resistant at higher strain rates. A very 
strong thinning is called  plastic . Some of the many examples are polymer solutions, 
colloidal suspensions, paper pulp in water, latex paint, blood plasma, syrup, and 
molasses. The classic case is  paint,  which is thick when poured but thin when brushed 
at a high strain rate. 
 Bingham plastic. The limiting case of a plastic substance is one that requires a fi nite 
yield stress before it begins to fl ow. Figure 1.8 a  shows yielding followed by linear 
behavior, but nonlinear fl ow can also occur. Some examples are clay suspensions, 
drilling mud, toothpaste, mayonnaise, chocolate, and mustard. The classic case is 
 catsup, which will not come out of the bottle until you stress it by shaking. 
  
A further complication of nonnewtonian behavior is the transient effect shown in 
Fig. 1.8 b . Some fl uids require a gradually increasing shear stress to maintain a con-
stant strain rate and are called  rheope c tic . The opposite case of a fl uid that thins out 
with time and requires decreasing stress is termed  thixotropic . We neglect nonnew-
tonian effects in this book; see Ref. 16 for further study. 
 Rheometers
 
There are many commercial devices for measuring the shear stress versus strain rate 
behavior of both newtonian and nonnewtonian fl uids. They are generically called 
 rheometers  and have various designs: parallel disks, cone-plate, rotating coaxial cyl-
inders, torsion, extensional, and capillary tubes. Reference 29 gives a good discussion. 
A popular device is the parallel-disk rheometer, shown in Fig. 1.9. A thin layer of 
fl uid is placed between the disks, one of which rotates. The resisting torque on the

device is given in Example 1.10. 
 Surface Tension
 
A liquid, being unable to expand freely, will form an  interface with a second liquid 
or gas. The physical chemistry of such interfacial surfaces is quite complex, and whole 
textbooks are devoted to this specialty [30]. Molecules deep within the liquid repel 
each other because of their close packing. Molecules at the surface are less dense and 
attract each other. Since half of their neighbors are missing, the mechanical effect is 
that the surface is in tension. We can account adequately for surface effects in fl uid 
mechanics with the concept of surface tension. 
  
If a cut of length  dL  is made in an interfacial surface, equal and opposite forces 
of magnitude  Y  dL  are exposed normal to the cut and parallel to the surface, where 
 Y  is called the  coeffi cient of su r face tension . The dimensions of  Y  are { F / L }, with 
SI units of newtons per meter and BG units of pounds-force per foot. An alternate 
concept is to open up the cut to an area  dA ; this requires work to be done of amount 
 Y  dA . Thus the coeffi cient  Y  can also be regarded as the surface energy per unit area 
of the interface, in N ∙   m/m 2 or ft ∙  lbf/ft 2 . 
  
The two most common interfaces are water–air and mercury–air. For a clean sur-
face at 20 8 C  5 68 8 F, the measured surface tension is 
 
Y 5 e0.0050 lbf/ft 5 0.073 N/m air–water
0.033 lbf/ft 5 0.48 N/m
air–mercury 
 (1.29) 
 These are design values and can change considerably if the surface contains con-
taminants like detergents or slicks. Generally  Y  decreases with liquid temperature and 
is zero at the critical point. Values of  Y  for water are given in Fig. 1.10 and Table A.5. 
  
If the interface is curved, a mechanical balance shows that there is a pressure dif-
ference across the interface, the pressure being higher on the concave side, as illus-
trated in Fig.  1.11. In Fig.  1.11 a , the pressure increase in the interior of a liquid 
cylinder is balanced by two surface-tension forces:

 We are not considering the weight of the liquid in this calculation. In Fig. 1.11 b, the 
pressure increase in the interior of a spherical droplet balances a ring of surface-
tension force:

 or

has  two interfaces with air, an inner and outer surface of nearly the same radius  R : 
¢pbubble < 2 ¢pdroplet 5 4Y
R  
 (1.32)
 Figure 1.11 c shows the general case of an arbitrarily curved interface whose principal 
radii of curvature are  R 1  and  R 2 . A force balance normal to the surface will show that 
the pressure increase on the concave side is 
¢p 5 Y(R1
 21 1 R2

 (1.33)
 Equations (1.30) to (1.32) can all be derived from this general relation; for example, 
in Eq. (1.30),  R 1  5  R and  R 2  5  ` . 
  
A second important surface effect is the  contact angle  θ ,  which appears when a 
liquid interface intersects with a solid surface, as in Fig.  1.12. The force balance 
would then involve both  Y  and  θ . If the contact angle is less than 90 8 , the liquid 
is said to  wet  the solid; if  θ  .  90 8 , the liquid is termed  nonwetting . For example, 
water wets soap but does not wet wax. Water is extremely wetting to a clean glass 
surface, with  θ  < 0 8 . Like  Y , the contact angle  θ is sensitive to the actual physi-
cochemical conditions of the solid–liquid interface. For a clean mercury–air–glass 
interface,  θ  5 130 8 .

32 Chapter 1 Introduction
  
Example 1.8 illustrates how surface tension causes a fl uid interface to rise or fall 
in a capillary tube. 
 EXAMPLE 1.8 
 Derive an expression for the change in height  h in a circular tube of a liquid with surface 
tension  Y and contact angle  θ , as in Fig. E1.8. 
 Solution 
 The vertical component of the ring surface-tension force at the interface in the tube must 
 balance the weight of the column of fl uid of height  h : 
 2πRY cos θ 5 γπR2h 
 Solving for  h , we have the desired result: 
 
h 5 2Y cos θ
γR
 
 Ans. 
 Thus the capillary height increases inversely with tube radius  R  and is positive if  θ  ,  90 8 
( wetting liquid) and negative (capillary depression) if  θ  .  90 8 . 
  
Suppose that  R  5  1 mm. Then the capillary rise for a water–air–glass interface,  θ  <  0 8 ,

 Vapor Pressure
 
Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a liquid boils and is in equilibrium with its 
own vapor. For example, the vapor pressure of water at 68 8 F is 49 lbf/ft 2 , while that 
of mercury is only 0.0035 lbf/ft 2 . If the liquid pressure is greater than the vapor pres-
sure, the only exchange between liquid and vapor is evaporation at the interface. If, 
however, the liquid pressure falls below the vapor pressure, vapor bubbles begin to 
appear in the liquid. If water is heated to 212 8 F, its vapor pressure rises to 2116 lbf/ft 2 , 
and thus water at normal atmospheric pressure will boil. When the liquid pressure is 
dropped below the vapor pressure due to a fl ow phenomenon, we call the process 
 cavitation . If water is accelerated from rest to about 50 ft/s, its pressure drops by 
about 15 lbf/in 2 , or 1 atm. This can cause cavitation [31]. 
  
The dimensionless parameter describing fl ow-induced boiling is the  cavitation

 Depending on the geometry, a given fl ow has a critical value of Ca below which the 
fl ow will begin to cavitate. Values of surface tension and vapor pressure of water are 
given in Table A.5. The vapor pressure of water is plotted in Fig. 1.13. 
 
Figure 1.14 a  shows cavitation bubbles being formed on the low-pressure surfaces 
of a marine propeller. When these bubbles move into a higher-pressure region, they 
collapse implosively. Cavitation collapse can rapidly spall and erode metallic surfaces 
and eventually destroy them, as shown in Fig. 1.14 b .

 EXAMPLE 1.9 
 A certain torpedo, moving in fresh water at 10 8 C, has a minimum-pressure point given by 
the formula 
 
 pmin 5 p0 2 0.35 ρV2 
 (1) 
 where  p 0  5  115 kPa,  ρ  is the water density, and  V  is the torpedo velocity. Estimate the 
velocity at which cavitation bubbles will form on the torpedo. The constant 0.35 is 
 dimensionless. 
 Solution 
 •  Assumption:  Cavitation bubbles form when the minimum pressure equals the vapor 
 pressure  p v . 
 •  Approach:  Solve Eq.  (1) above, which is related to the Bernoulli equation from 
 Example 1.3, for the velocity when  p min  5  p v . Use SI units (m, N, kg, s). 
 •  Property values: At 10 8 C, read Table A.1 for  ρ  5  1000 kg/m 3  and Table A.5 for 
 p v  5 1.227 kPa. 
 •  Solution steps:  Insert the known data into Eq.  (1) and solve for the velocity, using

 No-Slip and No-Temperature-
Jump Conditions
 
When a fl uid fl ow is bounded by a solid surface, molecular interactions cause the 
fl uid in contact with the surface to seek momentum and energy equilibrium with that 
surface. All liquids essentially are in equilibrium with the surfaces they contact. All 
gases are, too, except under the most rarefi ed conditions [18]. Excluding rarefi ed 
gases, then, all fl uids at a point of contact with a solid take on the velocity and tem-
perature of that surface: 
 
Vfluid ; Vwall 
  Tfluid ; Twall 
 (1.35) 
 These are called the  no-slip  and  no-temperature-jump conditions,  respectively. They 
serve as  bou n dary conditions  for analysis of fl uid fl ow past a solid surface.  Figure 1.15 
illustrates the no-slip condition for water fl ow past the top and bottom surfaces of a 
fi xed thin plate. The fl ow past the upper surface is disorderly, or turbulent, while the 
lower surface fl ow is smooth, or laminar. 6  In both cases there is clearly no slip at the 
wall, where the water takes on the zero velocity of the fi xed plate. The velocity pro-
fi le is made visible by the discharge of a line of hydrogen bubbles from the wire 
shown stretched across the fl ow.  
 6 Laminar and turbulent fl ows are studied in Chaps. 6 and 7.

36 Chapter 1 Introduction
  
To decrease the mathematical diffi culty, the no-slip condition is partially relaxed 
in the analysis of inviscid fl ow (Chap. 8). The fl ow is allowed to “slip” past the surface 
but not to permeate through the surface 
 
Vnormal(fluid) ; Vnormal(solid) 
 (1.36) 
 while the tangential velocity  V t  is allowed to be independent of the wall. The analysis 
is much simpler, but the fl ow patterns are highly idealized. 
  
For high-viscosity newtonian fl uids, the linear velocity assumption and the no-slip 
conditions can yield some sophisticated approximate analyses for two- and three-
dimensional viscous fl ows. The following example, for a type of rotating-disk vis-
cometer, will illustrate. 
 Fig. 1.15  The no-slip condition in 
water fl ow past a thin fi xed plate. 
The upper fl ow is turbulent; the 
lower fl ow is laminar. The velocity 
profi le is made visible by a line of 
hydrogen bubbles discharged from 
the wire across the fl ow. (National

 EXAMPLE 1.10 
 An oil fi lm of viscosity  μ  and thickness h V R lies between a solid wall and a circular 
disk, as in Fig. E1.10. The disk is rotated steadily at angular velocity  V . Noting that both 
velocity and shear stress vary with radius  r , derive a formula for the torque  M  required to 
rotate the disk. Neglect air drag. 
 Solution 
 •  System sketch: Figure E1.10 shows a side view ( a ) and a top view ( b ) of the system.

 •  Assumptions: Linear velocity profi le, laminar fl ow, no-slip, local shear stress given by 
Eq. (1.23). 
 •  Approach:  Estimate the shear stress on a circular strip of width  dr  and area  dA  5 2 p r 
 dr  in Fig. E1.10 b , then fi nd the moment  dM  about the origin caused by this shear stress. 
Integrate over the entire disk to fi nd the total moment  M . 
 •  Property values:  Constant oil viscosity  μ . In this steady fl ow, oil density is not relevant. 
 •  Solution steps:  At radius  r , the velocity in the oil is tangential, varying from zero at the 
fi xed wall (no-slip) to  u  5  V r  at the disk surface (also no-slip). The shear stress at this 
position is thus 
 τ 5 μdu
dy < μVr
h  
 This shear stress is everywhere perpendicular to the radius from the origin (see Fig. E1.10 b ). 
Then the total moment about the disk origin, caused by shearing this circular strip, can be 
found and integrated:

 •  Comments:  This is a simplifi ed engineering analysis, which neglects possible edge effects, 
air drag on the top of the disk, and the turbulence that might ensue if the disk rotates too fast. 
 Slip Flow in Gases
 
The “free slip” boundary condition, Eq. (1.36), is an unrealistic mathematical artifi ce 
to enable inviscid-fl ow solutions. However, actual, realistic wall slip occurs in rarefi ed 
gases, where there are too few molecules to establish momentum equilibrium with 
the wall. In 1879, the physicist James Clerk Maxwell used the kinetic theory of gases 
to predict a  slip velocity at the wall: 
 
δuwall < / 0u
0y
 |wall 
 (1.37) 
 where / is the mean free path of the gas, and  u  and  x  are along the wall. If / is very 
small compared to the lateral scale  L  of the fl ow, the  Knudsen number , Kn  5 //L, is

small, and the slip velocity is near zero. We will assign a few slip problems, but the 
details of rarefi ed gas fl ow are left for further reading in Refs. 18 and 52. 
 Speed of Sound
 
In gas fl ow, one must be aware of  compressibility  effects (signifi cant density changes 
caused by the fl ow). We shall see in Sec. 4.2 and in Chap.  9 that compressibility 
becomes important when the fl ow velocity reaches a signifi cant fraction of the speed 
of sound of the fl uid. The  speed of sound a  of a fl uid is the rate of propagation of 
small-disturbance pressure pulses (“sound waves”) through the fl uid. In Chap. 9 we 
shall show, from momentum and thermodynamic arguments, that the speed of sound is 
defi ned by a pressure-density derivative proportional to the  isentropic bulk modulus :

 where  β 5 isentropic bulk modulus 5 ρ a 0p

 . 
 This is true for either a liquid or a gas, but it is for  gases  that the problem of com-
pressibility occurs. For an ideal gas, Eq. (1.10), we obtain the simple formula 
 
aideal gas 5 (kRT)1/2 
 (1.38) 
 where  R  is the gas constant, Eq. (1.11), and  T  the absolute temperature. For example, 
for air at 20 8 C,  a  5  {(1.40)[287 m 2 /(s 2 ∙ K)](293 K)} 1/2  <  343 m/s (1126 ft/s  5 
768  mi/h). If, in this case, the air velocity reaches a signifi cant fraction of  a , say, 
100 m/s, then we must account for compressibility effects (Chap. 9). Another way to 
state this is to account for compressibility when the  Mach number  Ma  5  V / a  of the 
fl ow reaches about 0.3. 
   
T he speed of sound of water is tabulated in Table A.5. For near perfect gases, like air, 
the speed of sound is simply calculated by Eq. (1.38). Many liquids have their bulk modulus 
listed in Table A.3. Note, however, as discussed in Ref. 51, even a very small amount of 
dissolved gas in a liquid can reduce the mixture speed of sound by up to 80 percent. 
 EXAMPLE 1.11 
 A commercial airplane fl ies at 540 mi/h at a standard altitude of 30,000 ft. What is its Mach 
number? 
 Solution 
 •  Approach:  Find the “standard” speed of sound; divide it into the velocity, using proper 
units. 
 •  Property values:  From Table A.6, at 30,000 ft (9144 m),  a  <  303 m/s. Check this against 
the standard temperature, estimated from the table to be 229 K. From Eq. (1.38) for air, 
 a 5 3kRairT41/2 5 31.4(287)(229) 4 1/2 < 303 m/s. 
 •  Solution steps: Convert the airplane velocity to m/s: 
 V 5 (540 mi/h) 30.44704 m/s/(mi/h)4 < 241 m/s.

 Then the Mach number is given by 
 
Ma 5 V/a 5 (241 m/s)/(303 m/s) 5 0.80 
 Ans. 
 •  Comments: This value, Ma  5 0.80, is typical of present-day commercial airliners. 
 1.8 Basic Flow Analysis 
Techniques
 
There are three basic ways to attack a fl uid fl ow problem. They are equally important 
for a student learning the subject, and this book tries to give adequate coverage to 
each method: 
 1. Control-volume, or  integral analysis (Chap. 3). 
 2. Infi nitesimal system, or  differential analysis (Chap. 4). 
 3. Experimental study, or  dimensional analysis (Chap. 5). 
 In all cases, the fl ow must satisfy the three basic laws of mechanics plus a thermo-
dynamic state relation and associated boundary conditions: 
 1. Conservation of mass (continuity). 
 2. Linear momentum (Newton’s second law). 
 3. First law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy). 
 4. A state relation like  ρ  5  ρ ( p ,  T ). 
 5. Appropriate boundary conditions at solid surfaces, interfaces, inlets, and exits. 
 In integral and differential analyses, these fi ve relations are modeled mathemati-
cally and solved by computational methods. In an experimental study, the fl uid 
itself performs this task without the use of any mathematics. In other words, these 
laws are believed to be fundamental to physics, and no fl uid fl ow is known to 
violate them. 
 1.9 Flow Patterns: Streamlines, 
Streaklines, and Pathlines
 
Fluid mechanics is a highly visual subject. The patterns of fl ow can be visualized in 
a dozen different ways, and you can view these sketches or photographs and learn a 
great deal qualitatively and often quantitatively about the fl ow. 
 
Four basic types of line patterns are used to visualize fl ows: 
 1. A  streamline  is a line everywhere tangent to the velocity vector at a given instant. 
 2. A  pathline is the actual path traversed by a given fl uid particle. 
 3. A  streakline is the locus of particles that have earlier passed through a 
prescribed point. [33] 
 4. A  timeline is a set of fl uid particles that form a line at a given instant. 
 The streamline is convenient to calculate mathematically, while the other three are 
easier to generate experimentally. Note that a streamline and a timeline are instanta-
neous lines, while the pathline and the streakline are generated by the passage of time. 
The velocity profi le shown in Fig.  1.15 is really a timeline generated earlier by a 
single discharge of bubbles from the wire. A pathline can be found by a time exposure 
of a single marked particle moving through the fl ow. Streamlines are diffi cult to 

40 Chapter 1 Introduction
generate experimentally in unsteady fl ow unless one marks a great many particles and 
notes their direction of motion during a very short time interval [32]. In steady fl ow, 
where velocity varies only with position, the situation simplifi es greatly: 
 Streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines are identical in steady fl ow. 
 
In fl uid mechanics the most common mathematical result for visualization purposes 
is the streamline pattern. Figure 1.16 a shows a typical set of streamlines, and Fig. 1.16 b 
shows a closed pattern called a  streamtube . By defi nition the fl uid within a streamtube 
is confi ned there because it cannot cross the streamlines; thus the streamtube walls 
need not be solid but may be fl uid surfaces. 
 
Figure 1.17 shows an arbitrary velocity vector. If the elemental arc length  dr of a 
streamline is to be parallel to  V , their respective components must be in proportion:

1.9  Flow Patterns: Streamlines, Streaklines, and Pathlines 41
 If the velocities ( u ,  v ,  w ) are known functions of position and time, Eq.  (1.39) 
can be integrated to fi nd the streamline passing through the initial point ( x 0 ,  y 0 , 
 z 0 ,  t 0 ). The method is straightforward for steady fl ows but may be laborious for 
unsteady fl ow. 
 Flow Visualization
 
Clever experimentation can produce revealing images of a fl uid fl ow pattern, as shown 
earlier in Figs. 1.14 a  and 1.15. For example, streaklines are produced by the continu-
ous release of marked particles (dye, smoke, or bubbles) from a given point. If the 
fl ow is steady, the streaklines will be identical to the streamlines and pathlines of 
the fl ow. 
 
Some methods of fl ow visualization include the following [34–36]: 
 1. Dye, smoke, or bubble discharges. 
 2. Surface powder or fl akes on liquid fl ows. 
 3. Floating or neutral-density particles. 
 4. Optical techniques that detect density changes in gas fl ows: shadowgraph, 
schlieren, and interferometer. 
 5. Tufts of yarn attached to boundary surfaces. 
 6. Evaporative coatings on boundary surfaces. 
 7. Luminescent fl uids, additives, or bioluminescence. 
 8. Particle image velocimetry (PIV). 
 Figures 1.14 a  and 1.15 were both visualized by bubble releases. Another example is 
the use of particles in Fig. 1.18 to visualize a fl ow negotiating a 180 8  turn in a ser-
pentine channel [42]. 
 
Figure 1.18 a  is at a low, laminar Reynolds number of 1000. The fl ow is steady, 
and the particles form streaklines showing that the fl ow cannot make the sharp turn 
without separating away from the bottom wall. 
 
Figure 1.18 b is at a higher, turbulent Reynolds number of 30,000. The fl ow is 
unsteady, and the streaklines would be chaotic and smeared, unsuitable for visualiza-
tion. The image is thus produced by the new technique of particle image velocime-
try  [37]. In PIV, hundreds of particles are tagged and photographed at two closely 
spaced times. Particle movements thus indicate local velocity vectors. These hundreds 
of vectors are then smoothed by repeated computer operations until the time-mean 
fl ow pattern in Fig. 1.18 b  is achieved. Modern fl ow experiments and numerical mod-
els use computers extensively to create their visualizations, as described in the text 
by Yang [38]. 
  
Mathematical details of streamline/streakline/pathline analysis are given in Ref. 33. 
References 39–41 are beautiful albums of fl ow photographs. References 34–36 are 
monographs on fl ow visualization techniques. 
  
Fluid mechanics is a marvelous subject for visualization, not just for still (steady) 
patterns, but also for moving (unsteady) motion studies. An outstanding list of avail-
able fl ow movies and videotapes is given by Carr and Young [43].

1.11  The History of Fluid Mechanics 43
 1.10 The Fundamentals of 
Engineering (FE) Examination
 
The road toward a professional engineer’s license has a fi rst stop, the Fundamentals 
of Engineering Examination, known as the FE exam. It was formerly known as 
the Engineer-in-Training (E-I-T) Examination. This eight-hour national test will prob-
ably soon be required of all engineering graduates, not just for licensure, but as a 
student assessment tool. The 120-problem, four-hour morning session covers many 
general studies: 
 Mathematics—15% 
Ethics and business 
Material properties—7% 
 
 practices—7%
 Engineering probability 
Engineering 
 Fluid mecha n ics—7% 
 and statistics—7% 
 economics—8%
 Chemistry—9% 
Engineering 
Electricity and  
 
 mechanics—10% 
 magnetism—9%
 Computers—7% 
Strength of 
Thermodynamics—7%
 
 materials—7% 
 For the 60-problem, four-hour afternoon session you may choose one of seven mod-
ules: chemical, civil, electrical, environmental, industrial, mechanical, and other/ 
general engineering. Note that fl uid mechanics is an integral topic of the examination. 
Therefore, for practice, this text includes a number of end-of-chapter FE problems 
where appropriate. 
  
The format for the FE exam questions is multiple-choice, usually with fi ve selec-
tions, chosen carefully to tempt you with plausible answers if you used incorrect units, 
forgot to double or halve something, are missing a factor of  π , or the like. In some 
cases, the selections are unintentionally ambiguous, such as the following example 
from a previous exam: 
 Transition from laminar to turbulent fl ow occurs at a Reynolds number of 
 (A) 900   (B) 1200   (C) 1500   (D) 2100   (E) 3000 
 The “correct” answer was graded as (D), Re  5  2100. Clearly the examiner was think-
ing, but forgot to specify, Re d   for  fl ow in a smooth circular pipe,  since (see Chaps. 6 
and 7) transition is highly dependent on geometry, surface roughness, and the length 
scale used in the defi nition of Re. The moral is not to get peevish about the exam but 
simply to go with the fl ow (pun intended) and decide which answer best fi ts an 
undergraduate training situation. Every effort has been made to keep the FE exam 
questions in this text unambiguous. 
 1.11 The History of Fluid 
Mechanics
 
Many distinguished workers have contributed to the development of fl uid mechanics. 
If you are a student, however, this is probably not the time to be studying history. 
Later, during your career, you will enjoy reading about the history of, not just fl uid 
mechanics, but all of science. Here are some names that will be mentioned as we 
encounter their contributions in the rest of this book.

 Summary
 
This chapter has discussed the behavior of a fl uid—which, unlike a solid, must move 
if subjected to a shear stress—and the important fl uid properties. The writer believes 
the most important property to be the velocity vector fi eld  V ( x, y, z, t ). Following 
closely are the pressure  p , density  ρ , and temperature  T . Many secondary properties 
enter into various fl ow problems: viscosity  μ , thermal conductivity  k , specifi c weight 
 γ , surface tension   Y, speed of sound  a , and vapor pressure  p v . You must learn to 
locate and use all these properties to become profi cient in fl uid mechanics. 
  
There was a brief discussion of the fi ve different kinds of mathematical relations 
we will use to solve fl ow problems—mass conservation, linear momentum, fi rst law 
of thermodynamics, equations of state, and appropriate boundary conditions at walls 
and other boundaries. 
  
Flow patterns are also discussed briefl y. The most popular, and useful, scheme is 
to plot the fi eld of streamlines, that is, lines everywhere parallel to the local velocity 
vector. 
  
Since the earth is 75 percent covered with water and 100 percent covered with 
air, the scope of fl uid mechanics is vast and touches nearly every human endeavor. 
The sciences of meteorology, physical oceanography, and hydrology are concerned 
with naturally occurring fl uid fl ows, as are medical studies of breathing and blood 
circulation. All transportation problems involve fl uid motion, with well-developed 
specialties in aerodynamics of aircraft and rockets and in naval hydrodynamics of 
ships and submarines. Almost all our electric energy is developed either from water 
fl ow, air fl ow through wind turbines, or from steam fl ow through turbine generators. 
All combustion problems involve fl uid motion as do the more classic problems of 
irrigation, fl ood control, water supply, sewage disposal, projectile motion, and oil 
and gas pipelines. The aim of this book is to present enough fundamental concepts 
and practical applications in fl uid mechanics to prepare you to move smoothly into 
any of these specialized fi elds of the science of fl ow—and then be prepared to move 
out again as new technologies develop.

 P1.1  
A gas at 20 8 C may be considered  rarefi ed,  deviating from 
the continuum concept, when it contains less than 10 12 
molecules per cubic millimeter. If Avogadro’s number is 
6.023 E23 molecules per mole, what absolute pressure (in 
Pa) for air does this represent?

say, within a factor of 2—the number of molecules of air in 
the entire atmosphere of the earth.

*P1.18  For small particles at low velocities, the fi rst term in the

 P1.19  In his study of the circular hydraulic jump formed by a

 P1.23 During World War II, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, a British fl uid

 0.12-mm thickness, forms under the puck. The puck is 
struck with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. Assuming a linear 
velocity distribution in the air fi lm, how long will it take 
the puck to ( a ) slow down to 1 m/s and ( b ) stop completely?

 Comprehensive Problems 
 C1.1  
Sometimes we can develop equations and solve practical 
problems by knowing nothing more than the dimensions of 
the key parameters in the problem. For example, consider 
the heat loss through a window in a building. Window effi -
ciency is rated in terms of “ R  value,” which has units of 
(ft 2 ∙ h ∙  8 F)/Btu. A certain manufacturer advertises a double-
pane window with an  R  value of 2.5. The same company 
produces a triple-pane window with an  R  value of 3.4. In 
either case the window dimensions are 3 ft by 5 ft. On a 
given winter day, the temperature difference between the 
inside and outside of the building is 45 8 F. 
 ( a ) Develop an equation for the amount of heat lost in a 
given time period  D t , through a window of area  A , with 
a given R value, and temperature difference  D T . How 
much heat (in Btu) is lost through the double-pane 
window in one 24-h period? 
 ( b ) How much heat (in Btu) is lost through the triple-pane 
window in one 24-h period? 
 ( c ) Suppose the building is heated with propane gas, 
which costs $3.25 per gallon. The propane burner is 80 
percent effi cient. Propane has approximately 90,000 Btu 
of available energy per gallon. In that same 24-h 
 period, how much money would a homeowner save per 
window by installing triple-pane rather than double-
pane windows? 
 ( d ) Finally, suppose the homeowner buys 20 such triple-
pane windows for the house. A typical winter has the 
equivalent of about 120 heating days at a temperature 
difference of 45 8 F. Each triple-pane window costs $85 
more than the double-pane window. Ignoring interest 
and infl ation, how many years will it take the home-
owner to make up the additional cost of the triple-pane 
windows from heating bill savings? 
 C1.2  
When a person ice skates, the surface of the ice actually 
melts beneath the blades, so that he or she skates on a thin 
sheet of water between the blade and the ice. 
 ( a ) Find an expression for total friction force on the  bottom 
of the blade as a function of skater velocity  V , blade 
length  L , water thickness (between the blade and the 
ice)  h , water viscosity  μ , and blade width  W . 
 ( b ) Suppose an ice skater of total mass  m  is skating 
along at a constant speed of  V 0 when she suddenly 
stands stiff with her skates pointed directly forward, 
allowing herself to coast to a stop. Neglecting fric-
tion due to air resistance, how far will she travel 
before she comes to a stop? (Remember, she is 
coasting on  two  skate blades.) Give your answer for 
the total distance traveled,  x , as a function of  V 0 ,  m , 
 L ,  h ,  μ , and  W .

width  b  into the page. The liquid rises a distance  h between 
the plates, as shown.

face tension, acting on the liquid column between the

A mechanical device that uses the rotating cylinder of

 liquid is drawn up above the bulb on the right side and 
 allowed to drain by gravity through the capillary tube 
 below the bulb. The time  t  for the meniscus to pass from 
upper to lower timing marks is recorded. The kinematic 
viscosity is computed by the simple formula:

 where  C  is a calibration constant. For  ν  in the range of

this  chapter hints at a formula for estimating the

 C1.11  Mott [Ref. 49, p. 38] discusses a simple falling-ball vis-
cometer, which we can analyze later in Chap. 7. A small 
ball of diameter  D and density  ρ b falls through a tube of test 
liquid ( ρ ,  μ ). The fall velocity  V  is calculated by the time to 
fall a measured distance. The formula for calculating the 
viscosity of the fl uid is 
 
μ 5

 This result is limited by the requirement that the Reynolds 
number ( ρ VD / μ ) be less than 1.0. Suppose a steel ball (SG  5 
 7.87) of diameter 2.2 mm falls in SAE 25W oil (SG  5  0.88) 
at 20 8 C. The measured fall velocity is 8.4 cm/s. ( a )   What is 
the viscosity of the oil, in kg/m-s? ( b ) Is the Reynolds num-
ber small enough for a valid estimate? 
 C1.12  A solid aluminum disk (SG  5  2.7) is 2 in in diameter and

coated with a castor oil (SG  5  0.96) fi lm one hundredth of 
an inch thick. The steady slide velocity is 2 cm/s. Using 
Figure A.1 and a linear oil velocity profi le assumption, 
 estimate the temperature of the castor oil.

 The bathyscaphe  Trieste  was built by explorers August and Jacques Picard in 1953. They made 
many deep-sea dives over the next fi ve years. In 1958 the U.S. Navy purchased it and, in 1960, 
descended to the deepest part of the ocean, the Marianas Trench, near Guam. The recorded depth 
was 10,900 m, or nearly seven miles. The photo shows the vessel being lifted from the water. 
The pressure sphere is on the bottom, and the boat-shaped structure above is fi lled with gasoline, 
which provides buoyancy even at those depths.   [ Image courtesy of the U.S. Navy .]

 Chapter 2 
 Pressure Distribution 
in a Fluid 
 Motivation. Many fl uid problems do not involve motion. They concern the pressure 
distribution in a static fl uid and its effect on solid surfaces and on fl oating and sub-
merged bodies. 
  
When the fl uid velocity is zero, denoted as the  hydrostatic condition,  the pressure 
variation is due only to the weight of the fl uid. Assuming a known fl uid in a given 
gravity fi eld, the pressure may easily be calculated by integration. Important applications 
in this chapter are (1) pressure distribution in the atmosphere and the oceans, (2) the 
design of manometer, mechanical, and electronic pressure instruments, (3) forces on 
submerged fl at and curved surfaces, (4) buoyancy on a submerged body, and (5) the 
behavior of fl oating bodies. The last two result in Archimedes’ principles. 
 
If the fl uid is moving in  rigid-body motion,  such as a tank of liquid that has been 
spinning for a long time, the pressure also can be easily calculated because the fl uid 
is free of shear stress. We apply this idea here to simple rigid-body accelerations in 
Sec. 2.9. Pressure measurement instruments are discussed in Sec. 2.10. As a matter 
of fact, pressure also can be analyzed in arbitrary (nonrigid-body) motions  V ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ), 
but we defer that subject to Chap. 4. 
 2.1 Pressure and Pressure 
Gradient
 
In Fig. 1.1 we saw that a fl uid at rest cannot support shear stress and thus Mohr’s 
circle reduces to a point. In other words, the normal stress on any plane through a 
fl uid element at rest is a point property called the  fl uid pressure p,  taken positive for 
compression by common convention. This is such an important concept that we shall 
review it with another approach. 
  
First let us emphasize that pressure is a thermodynamic property of the fl uid, like 
temperature or density. It is not a  force . Pressure has no direction and is not a vector. 
The concept of force only arises when considering a surface immersed in fl uid 
 pressure. The pressure creates a force, due to fl uid molecules bombarding the surface, 
and it is normal to that surface. 

60 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
  
Figure 2.1 shows a small wedge of fl uid at rest of size  D x  by  D z  by  D s  and depth 
 b  into the paper. There is no shear by defi nition, but we postulate that the pressures 
 p x , p z , and  p n  may be different on each face. The weight of the element also may 
be important. The element is assumed to be small, so the pressure is constant on 
each face. Summation of forces must equal zero (no acceleration) in both the  x and 
 z directions.

 gFz 5 0 5 pzb ¢x 2 pnb ¢s cos θ 2 1

(2.1) 
 
 But the geometry of the wedge is such that 
 
¢s sin θ 5 ¢z    ¢s cos θ 5 ¢x 
(2.2) 
 Substitution into Eq. (2.1) and rearrangement give 
 
px 5 pn  
  
pz 5 pn 1 1
2ρg ¢z 
(2.3) 
  These relations illustrate two important principles of the hydrostatic, or shear-free, 
condition: (1) There is no pressure change in the horizontal direction, and (2) there 
is a vertical change in pressure proportional to the density, gravity, and depth change. 
We shall exploit these results to the fullest, starting in Sec. 2.3. 
  
In the limit as the fl uid wedge shrinks to a “point,” ¢z S 0 and Eq. (2.3) become 
 
 px 5 pz 5 pn 5 p 
(2.4) 
 Since  θ  is arbitrary, we conclude that the pressure  p  in a static fl uid is a point property, 
independent of orientation. 
 Pressure Force on a Fluid 
Element 
 
 Pressure (or any other stress, for that matter) causes a net force on a fl uid element. 
To see this, consider the pressure acting on the two  x  faces in Fig. 2.2. Let the  pressure 
vary arbitrarily

2.2  Equilibrium of a Fluid Element 61
 The net force in the  x direction on the element in Fig. 2.2 is given by 
 dFx 5 p dy dz 2 ap 1 0p
0x dxb dy dz 5 20p
0x dx dy dz 
 In like manner the net force  dF y involves 20p/0y, and the net force  dF z concerns 
20p/0z. The total net-force vector on the element due to pressure is 
 
 dFpress 5 a2i 0p
0x 2 j 0p
0y 2 k 0p
0z b dx dy dz 
(2.5) 
 We recognize the term in parentheses as the negative vector gradient of  p . Denoting 
 f as the net force per unit element volume, we rewrite Eq. (2.5) as 
 
 fpress 5 2§p 
(2.6) 
 where 
 § 5 gradient operator 5 i 0
0x 1 j 0
0y 1 k 0
0z 
 Thus it is not the pressure but the pressure  gradient causing a net force that must be 
balanced by gravity or acceleration or some other effect in the fl uid. 
 2.2 Equilibrium of a Fluid 
Element 
 
 The pressure gradient is a  surface  force that acts on the sides of the element. There 
may also be a  body  force, due to electromagnetic or gravitational potentials, acting 
on the entire mass of the element. Here we consider only the gravity force, or weight 
of the element: 
 d Fgrav 5 ρg dx dy dz 
 or 
 fgrav 5 ρg 
 (2.7) 
  
In addition to gravity, a fl uid in motion will have  surface  forces due to viscous 
stresses. By Newton’s law, Eq. (1.2), the sum of these per-unit-volume forces equals 
the mass per unit volume (density) times the acceleration  a of the fl uid element:

62 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
 This general equation will be studied in detail in Chap. 4. Note that Eq. (2.8) is a  vector 
relation, and the acceleration may not be in the same vector direction as the velocity. 
For our present topic,  hydrostatics, the viscous stresses and the acceleration are zero. 
 Gage Pressure and Vacuum 
Pressure: Relative Terms 
 
 Before embarking on examples, we should note that engineers are apt to specify pres-
sures as (1) the  abs o lute or total magnitude or (2) the value  relative  to the local 
ambient atmosphere. The second case occurs because many pressure instruments are 
of  differential  type and record, not an absolute magnitude, but the difference between 
the fl uid pressure and the atmosphere. The measured pressure may be either higher 
or lower than the local atmosphere, and each case is given a name: 
 1.  p  .  p a   Gage pressure: 
 p (gage) 5  p  2  p a 
 2.  p  ,  p a   Vacuum pressure: 
 p (vacuum)  5  p a  2  p 
 This is a convenient shorthand, and one later adds (or subtracts) atmospheric pressure 
to determine the absolute fl uid pressure. 
  
A typical situation is shown in Fig. 2.3. The local atmosphere is at, say, 90,000 Pa, 
which might refl ect a storm condition in a sea-level location or normal conditions at 
an altitude of 1000 m. Thus, on this day,  p a  5  90,000 Pa absolute  5  0 Pa gage  5  0 Pa 
vacuum. Suppose gage 1 in a laboratory reads  p 1  5  120,000 Pa absolute. This value 
may be reported as a  gage  pressure,  p 1  5  120,000  2  90,000  5  30,000 Pa  gage . 
(One must also record the atmospheric pressure in the laboratory, since  p a changes 
gradually.) Suppose gage 2 reads  p 2  5  50,000 Pa absolute. Locally, this is a  vacuum 
pressure and might be reported as  p 2  5  90,000  2  50,000  5  40,000 Pa  vacuum . 
Occasionally, in the problems section, we will specify gage or vacuum pressure to 
keep you alert to this common engineering practice. If a pressure is listed without the 
modifi er gage or vacuum, we assume it is absolute pressure.

2.3  Hydrostatic Pressure Distributions 63
 This is a  hydrostatic  distribution and is correct for all fl uids at rest, regardless of their 
viscosity, because the viscous term vanishes identically. 
  
Recall from vector analysis that the vector  = p  expresses the magnitude and direc-
tion of the maximum spatial rate of increase of the scalar property  p . As a result,  = p 
is perpendicular everywhere to surfaces of constant  p . Thus Eq. (2.9) states that a 
fl uid in hydrostatic equilibrium will align its constant-pressure surfaces everywhere 
normal to the local-gravity vector. The maximum pressure increase will be in the 
direction of gravity—that is, “down.” If the fl uid is a liquid, its free surface, being at 
atmospheric pressure, will be normal to local gravity, or “horizontal.” You probably 
knew all this before, but Eq. (2.9) is the proof of it. 
  
In our customary coordinate system  z  is “up.” Thus the local-gravity vector for 
small-scale problems is 
 
  g 5 2gk 
(2.10) 
 where  g  is the magnitude of local gravity, for example, 9.807 m/s 2 . For these coor-
dinates Eq. (2.9) has the components 
 
  0p
0x 5 0   0p
0y 5 0   0p
0z 5 2ρg 5 2γ 
(2.11) 
 the fi rst two of which tell us that  p is independent of  x and  y . Hence 0p/0z can be 
replaced by the total derivative  dp / dz , and the hydrostatic condition reduces to 
 dp

 or 
 p2 2 p1 5 2#

 γ dz 
(2.12) 
 Equation (2.12) is the solution to the hydrostatic problem. The integration requires an 
assumption about the density and gravity distribution. Gases and liquids are usually 
treated differently. 
 
We state the following conclusions about a hydrostatic condition: 
 Pressure in a continuously distributed uniform static fl uid varies only with vertical 
distance and is independent of the shape of the container. The pressure is the same 
at all points on a given horizontal plane in the fl uid. The pressure increases with 
depth in the fl uid. 
 An illustration of this is shown in Fig. 2.4. The free surface of the container is atmospheric 
and forms a horizontal plane. Points  a , b , c , and  d are at equal depth in a horizontal 
plane and are interconnected by the same fl uid, water; therefore, all points have the same 
pressure. The same is true of points  A ,  B , and  C  on the bottom, which all have the same 
higher pressure than at  a ,  b ,  c , and  d . However, point  D , although at the same depth as 
 A ,  B , and  C , has a different pressure because it lies beneath a different fl uid, mercury. 
 Effect of Variable Gravity 
 
 For a spherical planet of uniform density, the acceleration of gravity varies inversely 
as the square of the radius from its center

(2.13) 

64 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
 where  r 0  is the planet radius and  g 0  is the surface value of  g . For earth, r0 < 3960
statute mi < 6400 km. In typical engineering problems the deviation from  r 0 extends 
from the deepest ocean, about 11 km, to the atmospheric height of supersonic trans-
port operation, about 20 km. This gives a maximum variation in  g  of (6400/6420) 2 , 
or 0.6 percent. We therefore neglect the variation of  g in most problems. 
 Hydrostatic Pressure in Liquids 
 
 Liquids are so nearly incompressible that we can neglect their density variation in 
hydrostatics. In Example 1.6 we saw that water density increases only 4.6 percent at 
the deepest part of the ocean. Its effect on hydrostatics would be about half of this, 
or 2.3 percent. Thus we assume constant density in liquid hydrostatic calculations, for 
which Eq. (2.12) integrates to

 We use the fi rst form in most problems. The quantity  γ  is called the  specifi c weight
of the fl uid, with dimensions of weight per unit volume; some values are tabulated 
in Table 2.1. The quantity  p / γ is a length called the  pressure head of the fl uid.

For lakes and oceans, the coordinate system is usually chosen as in Fig. 2.5, with 
 z  5  0 at the free surface, where  p  equals the surface atmospheric pressure  p a . When 
we introduce the reference value ( p 1 ,  z 1 )  5 ( p a , 0), Eq. (2.14) becomes, for  p  at any 
(negative) depth  z ,

at this maximum depth.

the surface.
• Property values: From Table 2.1, γwater 5 9790 N/m3. We are given that patmos 5 91 kPa.
• Solution steps: Apply Eq. (2.15) to the deepest point. Use SI units, pascals, not kilopascals:

• Comments: Kilopascals are awkward. Use pascals in the formula, then convert the answer.
 The Mercury Barometer 
 
 The simplest practical application of the hydrostatic formula (2.14) is the barometer 
(Fig. 2.6), which measures atmospheric pressure. A tube is fi lled with mercury 
and inverted while submerged in a reservoir. This causes a near vacuum in the closed 
upper end because mercury has an extremely small vapor pressure at room temperatures 

66 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
(0.16  Pa at 20 8 C). Since atmospheric pressure forces a mercury column to rise a 
distance  h  into the tube, the upper mercury surface is at zero pressure. 
 
From Fig. 2.6, Eq. (2.14) applies with  p 1  5 0 at  z 1   5  h and  p 2  5  p a  at  z 2  5 0: 
 pa 2 0 5 2γM (0 2 h) 
 or

(2.16) 
 At sea-level standard, with  p a   5  101,350 Pa and  γ M  5  133,100 N/m 3  from Table 2.1, 
the barometric height is  h  5  101,350/133,100  5  0.761 m or 761 mm. In the United 
States the weather service reports this as an atmospheric “pressure” of 29.96 inHg 
(inches of mercury). Mercury is used because it is the heaviest common liquid. 
A water barometer would be 34 ft high. 
 Hydrostatic Pressure in Gases 
 
 Gases are compressible, with density nearly proportional to pressure. Thus density 
must be considered as a variable in Eq. (2.12) if the integration carries over large 
pressure changes. It is suffi ciently accurate to introduce the perfect-gas law  p  5  ρ RT 
in Eq. (2.12):

 This is 4 percent higher than the exact result. The isothermal formula is inaccurate in the 
troposphere. 
  Is the Linear Formula Adequate

The linear approximation from Eq. (2.14),  δ p  <  2 ρ g  δ z , is satisfactory for liquids, 
which are nearly incompressible. For gases, it is inaccurate unless  δ z  is rather small. 
Problem P2.26 asks you to show, by binomial expansion of Eq. (2.20), that the error 
in using constant gas density to estimate  δ p from Eq. (2.14) is small if

2.4  Application to Manometry 69
 where  T 0  is the local absolute temperature,  B  is the lapse rate from Eq. (2.19), and  n  5 
 g /( RB ) is the exponent in Eq. (2.20). The error is less than 1 percent if  δ z  , 200 m. 
  2.4 Application to Manometry  
From the hydrostatic formula (2.14), a change in elevation  z 2  2  z 1  of a liquid is 
equivalent to a change in pressure ( p 2  2  p 1 )/ γ . Thus a static column of one or more 
liquids or gases can be used to measure pressure differences between two points. Such 
a device is called a  manometer . If multiple fl uids are used, we must change the density 
in the formula as we move from one fl uid to another. Figure 2.8 illustrates the use of 
the formula with a column of multiple fl uids. The pressure change through each fl uid 
is calculated separately. If we wish to know the total change  p 5  2  p 1 , we add the 
successive changes  p 2  2  p 1 ,  p 3  2  p 2 ,  p 4  2  p 3 , and  p 5  2  p 4 . The intermediate values 
of  p cancel, and we have, for the example of Fig. 2.8, 
 
  p5 2 p1 5 2γ0(z2 2 z1) 2 γw(z3 2 z2) 2 γG(z4 2 z3) 2 γM(z5 2 z4)  
(2.22) 
 No additional simplifi cation is possible on the right-hand side because of the different 
densities. Notice that we have placed the fl uids in order from the lightest on top to 
the heaviest at bottom. This is the only stable confi guration. If we attempt to layer 
them in any other manner, the fl uids will overturn and seek the stable arrangement. 
 Pressure Increases Downward 
 
 The basic hydrostatic relation, Eq. (2.14), is mathematically correct but vexing to engi-
neers because it combines two negative signs to have the pressure increase downward. 
When calculating hydrostatic pressure changes, engineers work instinctively by simply 
having the pressure increase downward and decrease upward. If point 2 is a distance  h 
below point 1 in a uniform liquid, then  p 2  5  p 1  1  ρ gh.  In the meantime, Eq. (2.14) 
remains accurate and safe if used properly. For example, Eq. (2.22) is correct as shown, 
or it could be rewritten in the following “multiple downward increase” mode: 
 p5 5 p1 1 γ0 0z1 2 z2 0 1 γw 0z2 2 z3 0 1 γG 0z3 2 z4 0 1 γM 0z4 2 z5 0  
 That is, keep adding on pressure increments as you move down through the layered 
fl uid. A different application is a manometer, which involves both “up” and “down” 
calculations.

Fig. 2.9 Simple open manometer 
for measuring pA relative to atmo-
spheric pressure.
 Application: A Simple Manometer  
 Figure 2.9 shows a simple U-tube open manometer that measures the  gage pressure 
 p A  relative to the atmosphere,  p a . The chamber fl uid  ρ 1  is separated from the atmo-
sphere by a second, heavier fl uid  ρ 2 , perhaps because fl uid  A  is corrosive, or more 
likely because a heavier fl uid  ρ 2  will keep  z 2  small and the open tube can be shorter. 
 
We fi rst apply the hydrostatic formula (2.14) from  A  down to  z 1 . Note that we can 
then go down to the bottom of the U-tube and back up on the right side to  z 1 , and the 
pressure will be the same,  p  5 p 1 . Thus we can “jump across” and then up to level  z 2 : 
 
pA 1 γ1 0zA 2 z1 0 2 γ2 0z1 2 z2 0 5 p2 < patm 
 (2.23) 
 Another physical reason that we can “jump across” at section 1 is that a continuous 
length of the same fl uid connects these two equal elevations. The hydrostatic relation 
(2.14) requires this equality as a form of Pascal’s law: 
 Any two points at the same elevation in a continuous mass of the same static fl uid 
will be at the same pressure. 
 This idea of jumping across to equal pressures facilitates multiple-fl uid problems. It 
will be inaccurate, however, if there are bubbles in the fl uid. 
 EXAMPLE 2.3 
 The classic use of a manometer is when two U-tube legs are of equal length, as in Fig.   E2.3, 
and the measurement involves a pressure difference across two horizontal points. The typi-
cal application is to measure pressure change across a fl ow device, as shown. Derive a 
formula for the pressure difference  p a  2  p b  in terms of the system parameters in Fig.   E2.3.

 Ans. 
 The measurement only includes  h , the manometer reading. Terms involving  L  drop out. 
Note the appearance of the  difference  in densities between manometer fl uid and working 
fl uid. It is a common student error to fail to subtract out the working fl uid density  ρ 1 —a 
serious error if both fl uids are liquids and less disastrous numerically if fl uid 1 is a gas. 
Academically, of course, such an error is always considered serious by fl uid mechanics 
instructors.

Although Example 2.3, because of its popularity in engineering experiments, is 
sometimes considered to be the “manometer formula,” it is best  not  to memorize it 
but rather to adapt Eq. (2.14) to each new multiple-fl uid hydrostatics problem. For 
example, Fig. 2.10 illustrates a multiple-fl uid manometer problem for fi nding the dif-
ference in pressure between two chambers  A  and  B . We repeatedly apply Eq. (2.14), 
jumping across at equal pressures when we come to a continuous mass of the same 
fl uid. Thus, in Fig. 2.10, we compute four pressure differences while making three 
jumps: 
 
  pA 2 pB 5 ( pA 2 p1) 1 ( p1 2 p2) 1 ( p2 2 p3) 1 ( p3 2 pB)

 (2.24) 
 The intermediate pressures  p 1,2,3  cancel. It looks complicated, but really it is merely 
 sequential . One starts at  A , goes down to 1, jumps across, goes up to 2, jumps across, 
goes down to 3, jumps across, and fi nally goes up to  B .

fi ve-fi gure result,  p A  5    96,350 Pa, is unrealistic, since the data are known to only about 
three signifi cant fi gures. 
  
In making these manometer calculations we have neglected the capillary height 
changes due to surface tension, which were discussed in Example 1.8. These effects 
cancel if there is a fl uid interface, or  m e niscus,  between similar fl uids on both sides of 
the U-tube. Otherwise, as in the right-hand U-tube of Fig. 2.10, a capillary correction 
can be made or the effect can be made negligible by using large-bore ( $  1 cm) tubes. 
 2.5 Hydrostatic Forces on 
Plane Surfaces 
  
The design of containment structures requires computation of the hydrostatic forces 
on various solid surfaces adjacent to the fl uid. These forces relate to the weight of 
fl uid bearing on the surface. For example, a container with a fl at, horizontal bottom 

2.5  Hydrostatic Forces on Plane Surfaces 73
of area  A b  and water depth  H  will experience a downward bottom force  F b  5  γ HA b . 
If the surface is not horizontal, additional computations are needed to fi nd the hori-
zontal components of the hydrostatic force. 
  
If we neglect density changes in the fl uid, Eq. (2.14) applies and the pressure 
on any submerged surface varies linearly with depth. For a plane surface, the linear 
stress distribution is exactly analogous to combined bending and compression of 
a beam in strength-of-materials theory. The hydrostatic problem thus reduces to 
simple formulas involving the centroid and moments of inertia of the plate cross-
sectional area. 
  
Figure 2.11 shows a plane panel of arbitrary shape completely submerged in a 
liquid. The panel plane makes an arbitrary angle  θ  with the horizontal free surface, 
so that the depth varies over the panel surface. If  h  is the depth to any element area 
 dA of the plate, from Eq. (2.14) the pressure there is  p  5  p a  1  γ h . 
  
To derive formulas involving the plate shape, establish an  xy  coordinate system in 
the plane of the plate with the origin at its centroid, plus a dummy coordinate  ξ down 
from the surface in the plane of the plate. Then the total hydrostatic force on one side 
of the plate is given by 
 
  F 5 #p dA 5 # ( pa 1 γh) dA 5 paA 1 γ#h dA 
(2.25) 
  
The remaining integral is evaluated by noticing from Fig. 2.11 that  h  5  ξ sin  θ 
and, by defi nition, the centroidal slant distance from the surface to the plate is

74 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
 Therefore, since  θ is constant along the plate, Eq. (2.25) becomes 
 F 5 pa A 1 γ sin θ#ξ dA 5 paA 1 γ sin θ ξCGA 
 Finally, unravel this by noticing that  ξ CG  sin  θ  5  h CG , the depth straight down from 
the surface to the plate centroid. Thus 
F 5 paA 1 γhCG A 5 ( pa 1 γhCG)A 5 pCG A  
 (2.26)
 The force on one side of any plane submerged surface in a uniform fl uid equals the 
pressure at the plate centroid times the plate area, independent of the shape of the 
plate or the angle  θ at which it is slanted. 
  
Equation (2.26) can be visualized physically in Fig. 2.12 as the resultant of a linear 
stress distribution over the plate area. This simulates combined compression and bend-
ing of a beam of the same cross section. It follows that the “bending” portion of the 
stress causes no force if its “neutral axis” passes through the plate centroid of area. 
Thus the remaining “compression” part must equal the centroid stress times the plate 
area. This is the result of Eq. (2.26). 
  
However, to balance the bending-moment portion of the stress, the resultant force 
F  acts not through the centroid but below it toward the high-pressure side. Its line 
of action passes through the  center of pressure  CP of the plate, as sketched in 
Fig. 2.11. To fi nd the coordinates ( x CP ,  y CP ), we sum moments of the elemental force 
p  dA  about the centroid and equate to the moment of the resultant  F . To compute 
y CP , we equate

2.5  Hydrostatic Forces on Plane Surfaces 75
 The term  e  p a y dA  vanishes by defi nition of centroidal axes. Introducing  ξ  5  ξ CG  2  y , 
we obtain 
FyCP 5 γ sin θ aξCG#y dA 2 #y2 dAb 5 2γ sin θ Ixx 
 where again  e  y  dA  5  0 and  I xx  is the area moment of inertia of the plate area about 
its centroidal  x  axis, computed in the plane of the plate. Substituting for  F gives 
the result 
 
 yCP 5 2γ  sin θ Ixx
pCG A  
 (2.27) 
  
The negative sign in Eq. (2.27) shows that  y CP  is below the centroid at a deeper 
level and, unlike  F , depends on angle  θ . If we move the plate deeper,  y CP approaches 
the centroid because every term in Eq. (2.27) remains constant except  p CG , which 
increases. 
 
The determination of  x CP is exactly similar: 
 FxCP 5 #xp dA 5 #x3pa 1 γ(ξCG 2 y) sin θ4 dA 
 
5 2γ sin θ#xy dA 5 2γ sin θ Ixy
 
 where  I xy  is the product of inertia of the plate, again computed in the plane of the 
plate. Substituting for  F gives 
 
 xCP 5 2γ sin θ 
Ixy
pCGA  
 
 
 (2.28) 
 For positive  I xy ,  x CP  is negative because the dominant pressure force acts in the third, 
or lower left, quadrant of the panel. If  I xy  5  0, usually implying symmetry,  x CP  5 0 
and the center of pressure lies directly below the centroid on the  y axis. 
 Gage Pressure Formulas 
 
 In most cases the ambient pressure  p a  is neglected because it acts on both sides of 
the plate; for example, the other side of the plate is inside a ship or on the dry side 
of a gate or dam. In this case  p CG  5  γ h CG , and the center of pressure becomes inde-

The solution of Example 2.5 was achieved with the moment of inertia formulas, 
Eqs. (2.29). They simplify the calculations, but one loses a physical feeling for 
the forces. Let us repeat Parts ( a ) and ( b ) of Example 2.5 using a more visual 
approach. 
 EXAMPLE 2.6 
 Repeat Example 2.5 to sketch the pressure distribution on plate  AB , and break this distribu-
tion into rectangular and triangular parts to solve for ( a ) the force on the plate and ( b ) the 
center of pressure. 
 Solution 
Part (a) 
 Point  A  is 9 ft deep, hence  p A  5  γ h A  5  (64 lbf/ft 3 )(9 ft)  5 576 lbf/ft 2 . Similarly, Point  B 
is 15 ft deep, hence  p B  5  γ h B  5  (64 lbf/ft 3 )(15 ft)  5  960 lbf/ft 2 . This defi nes the linear 
pressure distribution in Fig. E2.6. The rectangle is 576 by 10 ft by 5 ft into the paper. The 
triangle is (960  2  576)  5  384 lbf/ft 2  3  10 ft by 5 ft. The centroid of the rectangle is 5 ft 
down the plate from  A . The centroid of the triangle is 6.67 ft down from  A . The total force 
is the rectangle force plus the triangle force:

 Comment:  We obtain the same force and center of pressure as in Example 2.5 but 
with more understanding. However, this approach is awkward and laborious if the plate 
is not a rectangle. It would be diffi cult to solve Example 2.7 with the pressure distribu-
tion alone because the plate is a triangle. Thus moments of inertia can be a useful 
simplifi cation.

2.6 Hydrostatic Forces on 
Curved Surfaces
 
 The resultant pressure force on a curved surface is most easily computed by 
separating it into horizontal and vertical components. Consider the arbitrary 
curved surface sketched in Fig. 2.14 a . The incremental pressure forces, being 
normal to the local area element, vary in direction along the surface and thus 
cannot be added numerically. We could sum the separate three components of 
these elemental pressure forces, but it turns out that we need not perform a 
laborious three-way integration. 
 
Figure 2.14 b  shows a free-body diagram of the column of fl uid contained in the 
vertical projection above the curved surface. The desired forces  F H  and  F V are exerted 
by the surface on the fl uid column. Other forces are shown due to fl uid weight and 
horizontal pressure on the vertical sides of this column. The column of fl uid must be 
in static equilibrium. On the upper part of the column  bcde , the horizontal components 
 F 1 exactly balance and are not relevant to the discussion. On the lower, irregular portion 
of fl uid  abc adjoining the surface, summation of horizontal forces shows that the desired 
force  F H  due to the curved surface is exactly equal to the force  F H  on the vertical left 
side of the fl uid column. This left-side force can be computed by the plane surface 
formula, Eq. (2.26), based on a vertical projection of the area of the curved surface. 
This is a general rule and simplifi es the analysis: 
 The horizontal component of force on a curved surface equals the force on the 
plane area formed by the projection of the curved surface onto a vertical plane 
normal to the component. 
 If there are two horizontal components, both can be computed by this scheme. Sum-
mation of vertical forces on the fl uid free body then shows that 
 
 FV 5 W1 1 W2 1 Wair

 We can state this in words as our second general rule: 
 The vertical component of pressure force on a curved surface equals in magnitude 
and direction the weight of the entire column of fl uid, both liquid and atmosphere, 
above the curved surface.

 Thus the calculation of  F V  involves little more than fi nding centers of mass of a col-
umn of fl uid—perhaps a little integration if the lower portion  abc  in Fig. 2.14 b has 
a particularly vexing shape. 
 EXAMPLE 2.8

 z 0   5    24 ft. The fl uid is water,  γ  5  62.4 lbf/ft 3 , and atmospheric pressure may be omitted.

 Solution 
•  S ystem sketch: Figure E2.8 b  shows the various dimensions. The dam width is  b  5  50 ft. 
 •  Approach: Calculate  F H  and its line of action from Eqs. (2.26) and (2.29). Calculate  F V 
 and its line of action by fi nding the weight of fl uid above the parabola and the centroid 
of this weight. 
•  Solution steps for the horizontal component: The vertical projection of the parabola lies 
along the  z  axis in Fig. E2.8 b  and is a rectangle 24 ft high and 50 ft wide. Its centroid is 
halfway down, or  h CG  5  24/2  5  12  ft. Its area is  A proj  5    (24 ft)(50 ft)  5  1200 ft 2 . Then, 
from Eq. (2.26), 
FH 5 γhCGAproj 5 a62.4 lbf
ft3 b (12 ft)(1200 ft2) 5 898,560 lbf < 899 3 103 lbf

 Thus  F H is 12  1 4  5 16 ft, or two-thirds of the way down from the surface (8 ft up from 
the bottom). 
 •  Comments:  Note that you calculate  F H  and its line of action from the  vertical projection 
of the parabola, not from the parabola itself. Since this projection is  vertical,  its angle  
θ  5  90 8 . 
 •  Solution steps for the vertical component:  The vertical force  F V  equals the weight of 
water above the parabola. Alas, a parabolic section is not in Fig. 2.13, so we had to look

concept of center of pressure CP is, in the writer’s opinion, stretched too far when applied 
to curved surfaces.

 EXAMPLE 2.9 
 Find an algebraic formula for the net   vertical force  F  on the submerged semicircular project-
ing structure  CDE  in Fig. E2.9. The structure has uniform width  b  into the paper. The 
liquid has specifi c weight  γ . 
 Solution 
 The net force is the difference between the upward force  F L  on the lower surface  DE and the 
downward force  F U  on the upper surface  CD , as shown in Fig. E2.9. The force  F U  equals  γ 
times the volume  ABDC  above surface  CD . The force  F L  equals  γ  times the volume  ABDEC 
above surface  DE . The latter is clearly larger. The difference is  γ  times the volume of the 
structure itself. Thus the net upward fl uid force on the semicylinder is

Ans.
 This is the principle upon which the laws of buoyancy, Sec. 2.8, are founded. Note that the 
result is independent of the depth of the structure and depends upon the specifi c weight of 
the  fl uid, not the material within the structure.

84 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
distribution changes between layers. However, the formulas apply separately to each 
layer, and thus the appropriate remedy is to compute and sum the separate layer forces 
and moments. 
  
Consider the slanted plane surface immersed in a two-layer fl uid in Fig. 2.15. The 
slope of the pressure distribution becomes steeper as we move down into the denser 
second layer. The total force on the plate does  not  equal the pressure at the centroid 
times the plate area, but the plate portion in each layer does satisfy the formula, so 
that we can sum forces to fi nd the total: 
 
F 5 g  Fi 5 g  pCGiAi 
(2.31)
 Similarly, the centroid of the plate portion in each layer can be used to locate the 
center of pressure on that portion: 
 
yCPi 5 2
ρig sin θi Ixxi
pCGi Ai
     xCPi 5 2ρig sin θi Ixyi

(2.32)
 These formulas locate the center of pressure of that particular  F i  with respect to the 
centroid of that particular portion of plate in the layer, not with respect to the centroid 
of the entire plate. The center of pressure of the total force  F  5  S  F i  can then be 
found by summing moments about some convenient point such as the surface. The 
following example will illustrate this. 
 EXAMPLE 2.10 
 A tank 20 ft deep and 7 ft wide is layered with 8 ft of oil, 6 ft of water, and 4 ft of mercury. 
Compute ( a ) the total hydrostatic force and ( b ) the resultant center of pressure of the fl uid 
on the right-hand side of the tank. 
 Solution 
 Divide the end panel into three parts as sketched in Fig. E2.10, and fi nd the hydrostatic  pressure 
at the centroid of each part, using the relation (2.26) in steps as in Fig. E2.10:

The same principles used to compute hydrostatic forces on surfaces can be applied 
to the net pressure force on a completely submerged or fl oating body. The results are 
the two laws of buoyancy discovered by Archimedes in the third century  b.c. : 
 1. A body immersed in a fl uid experiences a vertical buoyant force equal to the 
weight of the fl uid it displaces. 
 2. A fl oating body displaces its own weight in the fl uid in which it fl oats.

86 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
 Archimedes (287–212  b.c. ) was born and lived in the Greek city-state of Syracuse, 
on what is now the island of Sicily. He was a brilliant mathematician and engineer, 
two millennia ahead of his time. He calculated an accurate value for pi and approxi-
mated areas and volumes of various bodies by summing elemental shapes. In other 
words, he invented the integral calculus. He developed levers, pulleys, catapults, and 
a screw pump. Archimedes was the fi rst to write large numbers as powers of 10, 
avoiding Roman numerals. And he deduced the principles of buoyancy, which we 
study here, when he realized how light he was when sitting in a bathtub. 
  
Archimedes’ two laws are easily derived by referring to Fig. 2.16. In Fig. 2.16a, 
the body lies between an upper curved surface 1 and a lower curved surface 2. From 
Eq. (2.30) for vertical force, the body experiences a net upward force 
 FB 5 FV(2) 2 FV(1)
 5 (fluid weight above 2) 2 (fluid weight above 1)
 
 5 weight of fluid equivalent to body volume
 
(2.33)
 Alternatively, from Fig. 2.16 b , we can sum the vertical forces on elemental vertical 
slices through the immersed body: 
 
FB 5 #
body 
(p2 2 p1) dAH 5 2γ# (z2 2 z1) dAH 5 (γ)(body volume) (2.34)
 These are identical results and equivalent to Archimedes’ law 1. 
  
Equation (2.34) assumes that the fl uid has uniform specifi c weight. The line of 
action of the buoyant force passes through the center of volume of the displaced body; 
that is, its center of mass computed as if it had uniform density. This point through 
which  F B  acts is called the  center of buoyancy,  commonly labeled  B  or CB on a 
drawing. Of course, the point  B  may or may not correspond to the actual center of 
mass of the body’s own material, which may have variable density.

2.8  Buoyancy and Stability 87
 
Equation (2.34) can be generalized to a layered fl uid (LF) by summing the weights 
of each layer of density  ρ i displaced by the immersed body: 
 
 (FB)LF 5 g ρig(displaced volume)i  
 (2.35)
 Each displaced layer would have its own center of volume, and one would have to 
sum moments of the incremental buoyant forces to fi nd the center of buoyancy of the 
immersed body. 
  
Since liquids are relatively heavy, we are conscious of their buoyant forces, but 
gases also exert buoyancy on any body immersed in them. For example, human beings 
have an average specifi c weight of about 60 lbf/ft 3 . We may record the weight of a 
person as 180 lbf and thus estimate the person’s total volume as 3.0 ft 3 . However, in 
so doing we are neglecting the buoyant force of the air surrounding the person. At 
standard conditions, the specifi c weight of air is 0.0763 lbf/ft 3 ; hence the buoyant 
force is approximately 0.23 lbf. If measured in a vacuum, the person would weigh 
about 0.23 lbf more. For balloons and blimps the buoyant force of air, instead of 
being negligible, is the controlling factor in the design. Also, many fl ow phenomena, 
such as natural convection of heat and vertical mixing in the ocean, are strongly 
dependent on seemingly small buoyant forces. 
  
Floating bodies are a special case; only a portion of the body is submerged, with 
the remainder poking up out of the free surface. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.17, where the 
shaded portion is the displaced volume. Equation (2.34) is modifi ed to apply to this 
smaller volume: 
FB 5 (γ)(displaced volume) 5 floating-body weight 
(2.36)
 Not only does the buoyant force equal the body weight, but also they are  collinear
since there can be no net moments for static equilibrium. Equation (2.36) is the math-
ematical equivalent of Archimedes’ law 2, previously stated. 
 EXAMPLE 2.11 
 A block of concrete weighs 100 lbf in air and “weighs” only 60 lbf when immersed in fresh 
water (62.4 lbf/ft 3 ). What is the average specifi c weight of the block?

or 
FB 5 40 lbf 5 (62.4 lbf/ft3)(block volume, ft3)

of the block is 
 
γblock 5 100 lbf
0.641 ft3 5156 lbf/ft3  
Ans.
  
Occasionally, a body will have exactly the right weight and volume for its ratio to 
equal the specifi c weight of the fl uid. If so, the body will be  neutrally buoyant  and will 
remain at rest at any point where it is immersed in the fl uid. Small, neutrally buoyant 
particles are sometimes used in fl ow visualization, and a neutrally buoyant body called a 
 Swallow fl oat  [2] is used to track oceanographic currents. A submarine can achieve positive, 
neutral, or negative buoyancy by pumping water into or out of its ballast tanks. 
  Stability 
 
A fl oating body as in Fig. 2.17 may not approve of the position in which it is fl oating. 
If so, it will overturn at the fi rst opportunity and is said to be statically  unstable , like a 
pencil balanced on its point. The least disturbance will cause it to seek another equilib-
rium position that is stable. Engineers must design to avoid fl oating instability. The only 
way to tell for sure whether a fl oating position is stable is to “disturb” the body a slight 
amount mathematically and see whether it develops a restoring moment that will return 
it to its original position. If so, it is stable; if not, unstable. Such calculations for arbitrary 
fl oating bodies have been honed to a fi ne art by naval architects [3], but we can at least 
outline the basic principle of the static stability calculation. Figure 2.18 illustrates the 
computation for the usual case of a symmetric fl oating body. The steps are as follows: 
 1. The basic fl oating position is calculated from Eq. (2.36). The body’s center of 
mass G and center of buoyancy B are computed. 
 2. The body is tilted a small angle  D θ , and a new waterline is established for 
the body to fl oat at this angle. The new position  B 9 of the center of buoyancy 
is calculated. A vertical line drawn upward from  B 9 intersects the line of 
symmetry at a point  M , called the  metacenter, which is independent of  D θ  
for small angles. 
 3. If point  M is above  G (that is, if the  metacentric height  MG is positive), a 
restoring moment is present and the original position is stable. If  M  is below 
 G  (negative  MG ), the body is unstable and will overturn if disturbed. Stability 
increases with increasing  MG .

W = 100 lbf

2.8  Buoyancy and Stability 89
 Thus the metacentric height is a property of the cross section for the given weight, 
and its value gives an indication of the stability of the body. For a body of varying 
cross section and draft, such as a ship, the computation of the metacenter can be very 
involved. 
 Stability Related to 
Waterline Area 1 
 
 Naval architects [3] have developed the general stability concepts from Fig. 2.18 
into a simple computation involving the area moment of inertia of the  water-
line   area  (as seen from above) about the axis of tilt. The derivation—see [3] for 
details—assumes that the body has a smooth shape variation (no discontinuities) 
near the waterline. Recall that  M  is the metacenter,  B  is the center of buoyancy, 
and  G  is the center of gravity. The fi nal elegant formula relates the distances 
between these points: 
 
MG 5 IO
vsub
2 GB 
(2.37)
W here  I O  is the area moment of inertia of the waterline area about the tilt axis  O and 
 v sub  is the volume of the submerged portion of the fl oating body. It is desirable, of 
course, that MG be positive for the body to be stable. 
  
The engineer locates  G  and  B  from the basic shape and design of the fl oating body 
and then calculates  I O and  v sub to determine if MG is positive. 
  
Engineering design counts upon effective operation of the results. A stability analy-
sis is useless if the fl oating body runs aground on rocks, as in Fig. 2.19.

Even an expert will have diffi culty determining the fl oating stability of a buoyant 
body of irregular shape. Such bodies may have two or more stable positions. For 
example, a ship may fl oat the way we like it, so that we can sit on the deck, or it 
may fl oat upside down (capsized). An interesting mathematical approach to fl oating 
stability is given in Ref. 11. The author of this reference points out that even simple 
shapes, such as a cube of uniform density, may have a great many stable fl oating 
orientations, not necessarily symmetric. Homogeneous circular cylinders can fl oat 
with the axis of symmetry tilted from the vertical. 
  
Floating instability occurs in nature. Fish generally swim with their planes of sym-
metry vertical. After death, this position is unstable and they fl oat with their fl at sides 
up. Giant icebergs may overturn after becoming unstable when their shapes change 
due to underwater melting. Iceberg overturning is a dramatic, rarely seen event. 
  
Figure 2.20 shows a typical North Atlantic iceberg formed by calving from a 
Greenland glacier that protruded into the ocean. The exposed surface is rough, indicat-
ing that it has undergone further calving. Icebergs are frozen fresh, bubbly, glacial 
water of average density 900 kg/m 3 . Thus, when an iceberg is fl oating in seawater, 
whose average density is 1025 kg/m 3 , approximately 900/1025, or seven-eighths, of 
its volume lies below the water. 
 2.9 Pressure Distribution in 
Rigid-Body Motion 
 
 In rigid-body motion, all particles are in combined translation and rotation, and there 
is no relative motion between particles. With no relative motion, there are no strains 
or strain rates, so that the viscous term in Eq. (2.8) vanishes, leaving a balance 
between pressure, gravity, and particle acceleration: 
 
 §p 5 ρ(g 2 a) 
 (2.38) 
 The pressure gradient acts in the direction  g  2  a , and lines of constant pressure 
(including the free surface, if any) are perpendicular to this direction. The general 
case of combined translation and rotation of a rigid body is discussed in Chap. 3, 
Fig. 3.11.

formed by calving from a Greenland 
glacier. These, and their even larger 
Antarctic sisters, are the largest 
fl oating bodies in the world. Note the 
evidence of further calving fractures 
on the front surface. (© Corbis.)

92 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
  
Fluids can rarely move in rigid-body motion unless restrained by confi ning walls 
for a long time. For example, suppose a tank of water is in a car that starts a constant 
acceleration. The water in the tank would begin to slosh about, and that sloshing would 
damp out very slowly until fi nally the particles of water would be in approximately 
rigid-body acceleration. This would take so long that the car would have reached 
hypersonic speeds. Nevertheless, we can at least discuss the pressure distribution in a 
tank of rigidly accelerating water. 
 Uniform Linear Acceleration 
 
 In the case of uniform rigid-body acceleration, Eq. (2.38) applies,  a  having the same 
magnitude and direction for all particles. With reference to Fig. 2.21, the parallelo-
gram sum of  g  and  2 a  gives the direction of the pressure gradient or greatest rate of 
increase of  p . The surfaces of constant pressure must be perpendicular to this and are 
thus tilted at a downward angle  θ such that 
 
 θ 5 tan21
ax
g 1 az
 
 (2.39) 
 One of these tilted lines is the free surface, which is found by the requirement that 
the fl uid retain its volume unless it spills out. The rate of increase of pressure in the 
direction  g  2  a is greater than in ordinary hydrostatics and is given by 
 
 dp
ds 5 ρG  where G 5 3a2
x 1 (g 1 az)241/2 
 (2.40) 
 These results are independent of the size or shape of the container as long as the fl uid 
is continuously connected throughout the container.

 •  Property values: Density of coffee given as 1010 kg/m 3 .

  Rigid-Body Rotation 
 
As a second special case, consider rotation of the fl uid about the  z  axis without any 
translation, as sketched in Fig. 2.22. We assume that the container has been rotating 
long enough at constant  V  for the fl uid to have attained rigid-body rotation. The fl uid 
acceleration will then be a centripetal term. In the coordinates of Fig. 2.22, the angular-
velocity and position vectors are given by 
 
 V 5 kV r0 5 irr 
 (2.41) 
 Then the acceleration is given by 
 
 V 3 (V 3 r0) 5 2rV2ir 
 (2.42) 
 as marked in the fi gure, and Eq. (2.38) for the force balance becomes 
 
 §p 5 ir 0p
0r 1 k 0p
0z 5 ρ(g 2 a) 5 ρ(2gk 1 rV2ir) 
 
 Equating like components, we fi nd the pressure fi eld by solving two fi rst-order partial 
differential equations: 
 
 0p
0r 5 ρrV2  0p
0z 5 2γ  
 (2.43) 
 The right-hand sides of (2.43) are known functions of  r  and  z . One can proceed as follows: 
Integrate the fi rst equation “partially,” holding  z  constant, with respect to  r . The result is 
 
 p 5 1
2ρr2V2 1 f(z) 
 (2.44) 
 where the “constant” of integration is actually a function  f ( z ). 2  Now differentiate this 
with respect to  z and compare with the second relation of (2.43):

 where  C is a constant. Thus Eq. (2.44) now becomes 
p 5 const 2 γz 1 1
2ρr2V2 
 (2.45)
 This is the pressure distribution in the fl uid. The value of  C  is found by specifying 
the pressure at one point. If  p  5  p 0  at ( r ,  z )  5  (0, 0), then  C  5  p 0 . The fi nal desired 
distribution is 
p 5 p0 2 γz 1 1
2 ρr2V2  
 (2.46) 
 The pressure is linear in  z  and parabolic in  r . If we wish to plot a constant-pressure 
surface, say,  p  5  p 1 , Eq. (2.45) becomes 
 
 z 5 p0 2 p1

 (2.47)
 Thus the surfaces are paraboloids of revolution, concave upward, with their minimum 
points on the axis of rotation. Some examples are sketched in Fig. 2.22. 
  
As in the previous example of linear acceleration, the position of the free surface 
is found by conserving the volume of fl uid. For a noncircular container with the axis 
of rotation off-center, as in Fig. 2.22, a lot of laborious mensuration is required, and 
a single problem will take you all weekend. However, the calculation is easy for a 
cylinder rotating about its central axis, as in Fig. 2.23. Since the volume of a parabo-
loid is one-half the base area times its height, the still-water level is exactly halfway 
between the high and low points of the free surface. The center of the fl uid drops an 
amount  h /2  5  V 2 R 2 /(4 g ), and the edges rise an equal amount. 
 EXAMPLE 2.14 
 The coffee cup in Example 2.13 is removed from the drag racer, placed on a turntable, and 
rotated about its central axis until a rigid-body mode occurs. Find ( a ) the angular velocity

Part (b) 
 To compute the pressure, it is convenient to put the origin of coordinates  r  and  z  at the bottom 
of the free-surface depression, as shown in Fig. E2.14. The gage pressure here is  p 0  5  0, and 
point  A is at ( r ,  z )  5  (3 cm,  2 4 cm). Equation (2.46) can then be evaluated:

 This is about 43 percent greater than the still-water pressure  p A  5 694 Pa. 
E2.14
  
Here, as in the linear acceleration case, it should be emphasized that the paraboloid 
pressure distribution (2.46) sets up in  any fl uid under rigid-body rotation, regardless 
of the shape or size of the container. The container may even be closed and fi lled 
with fl uid. It is only necessary that the fl uid be continuously interconnected throughout 
the container. The following example will illustrate a peculiar case in which one can 
visualize an imaginary free surface extending outside the walls of the container. 
 EXAMPLE 2.15 
 A U-tube with a radius of 10 in and containing mercury to a height of 30 in is rotated about 
its center at 180 r/min until a rigid-body mode is achieved. The diameter of the tubing is 
negligible. Atmospheric pressure is 2116 lbf/ft 2 . Find the pressure at point  A  in the rotating 
condition. See Fig. E2.15. 
 Solution 
 Convert the angular velocity to radians per second: 
 V 5 (180 r/min) 2π rad/r
60 s/min 5 18.85 rad/s  
 From Table 2.1 we fi nd for mercury that  γ  5  846 lbf/ft 3  and hence  ρ  5  846/32.2  5 
26.3 slugs/ft 3 . At this high rotation rate, the free surface will slant upward at a fi erce angle 
[about 84 8 ; check this from Eq. (2.47)], but the tubing is so thin that the free surface will 
remain at approximately the same 30-in height, point  B . Placing our origin of coordinates

at this height, we can calculate the constant  C  in Eq. (2.45) from the condition  p B  5

 We then obtain  p A by evaluating Eq. (2.46) at ( r ,  z )  5 (0,  2 30 in): 
 
 pA 5 21129 2 (846 lbf/ft3)(230
12 ft) 5 21129 1 2115 5 986 lbf/ft2 
 Ans. 
 This is less than atmospheric pressure, and we can see why if we follow the free-surface 
paraboloid down from point  B along the dashed line in the fi gure. It will cross the horizon-
tal portion of the U-tube (where  p will be atmospheric) and fall  below point  A . From 
Fig. 2.23 the actual drop from point  B will be

2g

5 3.83 ft 5 46 in  
 Thus  p A  is about 16 inHg below atmospheric pressure, or about  16
12 (846)  5  1128 lbf/ft 2 below 
 p a  5 2116 lbf/ft 2 , which checks with the answer above. When the tube is at rest, 
 pA 5 2116 2 846(230
12) 5 4231 lbf/ft2 
 Hence rotation has reduced the pressure at point  A  by 77 percent. Further rotation can reduce 
 p A to near-zero pressure, and cavitation can occur. 
  
An interesting by-product of this analysis for rigid-body rotation is that the lines 
everywhere parallel to the pressure gradient form a family of curved surfaces, as 
sketched in Fig. 2.22. They are everywhere orthogonal to the constant-pressure 
surfaces, and hence their slope is the negative inverse of the slope computed from 
Eq. (2.47):

would align themselves with these exponential lines, thus avoiding any stress other 
than pure tension. Figure 2.24 shows the confi guration of such streamers before and 
during rotation. 
 2.10 Pressure Measurement 
 
 Pressure is a derived property. It is the force per unit area as related to fl uid 
molecular bombardment of a surface. Thus most pressure instruments only  infer 
the pressure by calibration with a primary device such as a deadweight piston 
tester. There are many such instruments, for both a static fl uid and a moving 
stream. The instrumentation texts in Refs. 7 to 10, 12, 13, and 16–17 list over 
20  designs for pressure measurement instruments. These instruments may be 
grouped into four categories: 
 1.  Gravity-based: barometer, manometer, deadweight piston. 
 2.  Elastic deformation: bourdon tube (metal and quartz), diaphragm, bellows, 
strain-gage, optical beam displacement. 
 3.  Gas behavior: gas compression (McLeod gage), thermal conductance (Pirani 
gage), molecular impact (Knudsen gage), ionization, thermal conductivity, 
air piston. 
 4.  Electric output: resistance (Bridgman wire gage), diffused strain gage, 
capacitative, piezoelectric, potentiometric, magnetic inductance, magnetic 
reluctance, linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), resonant 
 frequency. 
 5.  Luminescent coatings for surface pressures [15]. 
 The gas-behavior gages are mostly special-purpose instruments used for certain 
 scientifi c experiments. The deadweight tester is the instrument used most often for 
calibrations; for example, it is used by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and 
Technology (NIST). The barometer is described in Fig. 2.6. 
  
The manometer, analyzed in Sec. 2.4, is a simple and inexpensive hydrostatic-
principle device with no moving parts except the liquid column itself. Manometer 
measurements must not disturb the fl ow. The best way to do this is to take the mea-
surement through a  static hole  in the wall of the fl ow, as illustrated in Fig. 2.25 a . 
The hole should be normal to the wall, and burrs should be avoided. If the hole is 
small enough (typically 1-mm diameter), there will be no fl ow into the measuring 
tube once the pressure has adjusted to a steady value. Thus the fl ow is almost undis-
turbed. An oscillating fl ow pressure, however, can cause a large error due to possible 
dynamic response of the tubing. Other devices of smaller dimensions are used for 
dynamic-pressure measurements. The manometer in Fig. 2.25 a  measures the gage 
pressure  p 1 . The instrument in Fig. 2.25 b  is a digital  differential  manometer, which 
can measure the difference between two different points in the fl ow, with stated 
accuracy of 0.1 percent of full scale. The world of instrumentation is moving quickly 
toward digital readings. 

100 Chapter 2 Pressure Distribution in a Fluid 
  
In category 2, elastic-deformation instruments, a popular, inexpensive, and reliable 
device is the  bourdon tube,  sketched in Fig. 2.26. When pressurized internally, a 
curved tube with fl attened cross section will defl ect outward. The defl ection can be 
measured by a linkage attached to a calibrated dial pointer, as shown. Or the defl ec-
tion can be used to drive electric-output sensors, such as a variable transformer. 
Similarly, a membrane or  diaphragm  will defl ect under pressure and can either be 
sensed directly or used to drive another sensor. 
  
An interesting variation of Fig. 2.26 is the  fused-quartz, force-balanced bourdon 
tube,  shown in Fig. 2.27, whose spiral-tube defl ection is sensed optically and returned 
to a zero reference state by a magnetic element whose output is proportional to the

fl uid pressure. The fused-quartz, force-balanced bourdon tube is reported to be one 
of the most accurate pressure sensors ever devised, with uncertainty on the order of 
 6 0.003 percent. 
  
The quartz gages, both the bourdon type and the resonant type, are expensive 
but extremely accurate, stable, and reliable [14]. They are often used for deep-
ocean pressure measurements, which detect long waves and tsunami activity over 
extensive time periods. 
  
The last category,  electric-output  sensors,  is extremely important in engineering 
because the data can be stored on computers and freely manipulated, plotted, and analyzed. 
Three examples are shown in Fig. 2.28, the fi rst being the  capacitive  sensor in Fig. 2.28 a . 
The differential pressure defl ects the silicon diaphragm and changes the capacitance of 
the liquid in the cavity. Note that the cavity has spherical end caps to prevent overpressure 
damage. In the second type, Fig. 2.28 b , strain gages and other sensors are chemically 
diffused or etched onto a chip, which is stressed by the applied pressure. Finally, in 
Fig. 2.28 c , a micromachined silicon sensor is arranged to deform under pressure such that 
its natural vibration frequency is proportional to the pressure. An oscillator excites the 
element’s resonant frequency and converts it into appropriate pressure units. 
  
Another kind of dynamic electric-output sensor is the  piezoelectric transducer, 
shown in Fig. 2.29. The sensing elements are thin layers of quartz, which generate 
an electric charge when subjected to stress. The design in Fig. 2.29 is fl ush-mounted 
on a solid surface and can sense rapidly varying pressures, such as blast waves. Other 
designs are of the cavity type. This type of sensor primarily detects transient pressures, 
not steady stress, but if highly insulated can also be used for short-term static events. 
Note also that it measures  gage  pressure—that is, it detects only a change from ambi-
ent conditions.

balanced bourdon tube is the most

commercial applications today.

 Summary 
 
 This chapter has been devoted entirely to the computation of pressure distributions 
and the resulting forces and moments in a static fl uid or a fl uid with a known veloc-
ity fi eld. All hydrostatic (Secs. 2.3 to 2.8) and rigid-body (Sec. 2.9) problems are 
solved in this manner and are classic cases that every student should understand. In 
arbitrary viscous fl ows, both pressure and velocity are unknowns and are solved 
together as a system of equations in the chapters that follow.

20 8 C rises into the tube to a height of 25 cm. After cor-
recting for surface tension, estimate the applied pressure 
in Pa.

Pressure gages, such as the bourdon gage in Fig. P2.4, are 
calibrated with a deadweight piston. If the bourdon gage 
is designed to rotate the pointer 10 degrees for every

 The atmosphere 
 P2.24  In Prob. 1.2 we made a crude integration of the density 
distribution  ρ ( z ) in Table A.6 and estimated the mass of 
the earth’s atmosphere to be  m  <  6 E18 kg. Can this 
 result be used to estimate sea-level pressure on the 
earth? Conversely, can the actual sea-level pressure of 
101.35 kPa be used to make a more accurate estimate of 
the atmospheric mass? 
 
* P2.25  As measured by NASA’s Viking landers, the atmosphere 
of Mars, where  g  < 3.71 m/s 2 , is almost entirely carbon 
dioxide, and the surface pressure averages 700 Pa. The tem-
perature is cold and drops off exponentially:  T  <  T o e 2 Cz , 
where C  5  1.3E-5 m 2 1  and  T o  = 250 K. For example, 
at 20,000 m altitude,  T  <  193 K. ( a ) Find an  analytic 
formula for the variation of pressure with altitude. 
( b ) Find the altitude where pressure on Mars has dropped 
to 1 pascal. 
 P2.26  For gases that undergo large changes in height, the linear 
approximation, Eq. (2.14), is inaccurate. Expand the tropo-
sphere power-law, Eq. (2.20), into a power series, and 
show that the linear approximation  p  <  p a  2  ρ a  gz  is ade-
quate when

 P2.27  Conduct an experiment to illustrate atmospheric pressure. 
 Note:  Do this over a sink or you may get wet! Find a 
 drinking glass with a very smooth, uniform rim at the top. 
Fill the glass nearly full with water. Place a smooth, light, 
fl at plate on top of the glass such that the entire rim of the 
glass is covered. A glossy postcard works best. A small 
index card or one fl ap of a greeting card will also work. 
See Fig. P2.27 a . 
  
 
( a ) Hold the card against the rim of the glass and turn the glass 
upside down. Slowly release pressure on the card. Does 
the  water fall out of the glass? Record your experimental 
 observations. ( b ) Find an expression for the pressure at points 
1 and 2 in Fig. P2.27 b . Note that the glass is now inverted, so 
the original top rim of the glass is at the bottom of the picture, 
and the original bottom of the glass is at the top of the picture. 
The weight of the card can be neglected. ( c ) Estimate the theo-
retical maximum glass height at which this experiment could 
still work, such that the water would not fall out of the glass.

 P2.28  A correlation of computational fl uid dynamics results indi-
cates that, all other things being equal, the distance traveled 
by a well-hit baseball varies inversely as the 0.36 power of 
the air density. If a home-run ball hit in Citi Field in New 
York travels 400 ft, estimate the distance it would travel in 
( a ) Quito, Ecuador, and ( b ) Colorado Springs, CO. 
 P2.29  Follow up on Prob. P2.8 by estimating the altitude on Mars 
where the pressure has dropped to 20 percent of its surface 
value. Assume an  isothermal  atmosphere, not the exponen-
tial variation of P2.25. 
 Manometers; multiple fl uids 
 P2.30  For the traditional equal-level manometer measurement in 
Fig. E2.3, water at 20 8 C fl ows through the plug device 
from  a  to  b . The manometer fl uid is mercury. If  L  5  12 cm 
and  h  5  24 cm, ( a ) what is the pressure drop through the 
device? ( b ) If the water fl ows through the pipe at a velocity 
 V  5 18 ft/s, what is the  dimensionless loss  coeffi cient  of 
the device, defi ned by  K  5  D p /( ρ V 2 )? We will study loss 
coeffi cients in Chap. 6.

 P2.43  The traditional method of measuring blood pressure uses a 
 sphygmomanometer , fi rst recording the highest ( systolic ) 
and then the lowest ( diastolic ) pressure from which fl ow-
ing “Korotkoff” sounds can be heard.  Patients with danger-
ous hypertension can exhibit systolic  pressures as high as 
5 lbf/in 2 . Normal levels, however, are 2.7 and 1.7 lbf/in 2 , 
respectively, for systolic and  diastolic pressures. The 
 manometer uses mercury and air as fl uids.

 P2.44 Water fl ows downward in a pipe at 45 8 , as shown in

6-in height difference. What is the total pressure drop  p 1  2  p 2 
in lbf/in 2 ? What is the pressure drop due to friction only 
between 1 and 2 in lbf/in 2 ? Does the manometer reading 
correspond only to friction drop? Why?

 W2.1  Consider a hollow cone with a vent hole in the vertex at the 
top, along with a hollow cylinder, open at the top, with the 
same base area as the cone. Fill both with water to the top. 
The  hydrostatic par a dox  is that both containers have the 
same force on the bottom due to the water pressure, although 
the cone contains 67 percent less water. Can you explain 
the paradox? 
 W2.2  Can the temperature ever  rise  with altitude in the real atmo-
sphere? Wouldn’t this cause the air pressure to  increase 
upward? Explain the physics of this situation. 
 W2.3  Consider a submerged curved surface that consists of a 
two-dimensional circular arc of arbitrary angle, arbitrary 
depth, and arbitrary orientation. Show that the resultant hydro-
static pressure force on this surface must pass through the 
center of curvature of the arc. 
 W2.4 Fill a glass approximately 80 percent with water, and add a 
large ice cube. Mark the water level. The ice cube, having 
SG  <  0.9, sticks up out of the water. Let the ice cube melt 
with negligible evaporation from the water surface. Will the 
water level be higher than, lower than, or the same as before? 
 W2.5  A ship, carrying a load of steel, is trapped while fl oating in 
a small closed lock. Members of the crew want to get out, 
but they can’t quite reach the top wall of the lock. A crew 
member suggests throwing the steel overboard in the lock, 
claiming the ship will then rise and they can climb out. 
Will this plan work? 
 W2.6 Consider a balloon of mass  m fl oating neutrally in the 
 atmosphere, carrying a person/basket of mass  M  .  m. 
 Discuss the stability of this system to disturbances. 
 W2.7  Consider a helium balloon on a string tied to the seat of 
your stationary car. The windows are closed, so there is no 
air motion within the car. The car begins to accelerate for-
ward. Which way will the balloon lean, forward or back-
ward?  Hint:  The acceleration sets up a horizontal pressure 
gradient in the air within the car. 
 W2.8  Repeat your analysis of Prob. W2.7 to let the car move at 
constant velocity and go around a curve. Will the balloon 
lean in, toward the center of curvature, or out?

Some manometers are constructed as in Fig. C2.1, where 
one side is a large reservoir (diameter  D ) and the other side 
is a small tube of diameter  d , open to the atmosphere. In 
such a case, the height of manometer liquid on the reservoir 
side does not change appreciably. This has the advantage 
that only one height needs to be measured rather than two. 
The manometer liquid has density  ρ m  while the air has den-
sity  ρ a . Ignore the effects of surface tension. When there is 
no pressure difference across the manometer, the eleva-
tions on both sides are the same, as indicated by the dashed 
line. Height  h  is measured from the zero pressure level as 
shown. ( a ) When a high pressure is applied to the left side, 
the manometer liquid in the large reservoir goes down, 
while that in the tube at the right goes up to conserve mass. 
Write an exact expression for  p 1gage , taking into account the 
movement of the surface of the reservoir. Your equation 
should give  p 1gage  as a function of  h ,  ρ m , and the physical 
parameters in the problem,  h , d , D , and gravity constant  g. 
( b ) Write an approximate expression for  p 1gage , neglecting 
the change in elevation of the surface of the reservoir  liquid.

In “soft” liquids (low bulk modulus  β ), it may be necessary 
to account for liquid compressibility in hydrostatic calcula-
tions. An approximate density relation would be 
 
  dp < β
ρ dρ 5 a2dρ  or  p < p0 1 a2(ρ 2 ρ0) 
 where  a  is the speed of sound and ( p 0 ,  ρ 0 ) are the conditions 
at the liquid surface  z  5  0. Use this approximation to show 
that the density variation with depth in a soft liquid is 
 ρ 5 ρ0e2gz/a2   where  g  is the acceleration of gravity and  z is 
positive upward. Then consider a vertical wall of width  b, 
extending from the surface ( z  5  0) down to depth  z  5  2 h .

It is desired to have a bottom-moored, fl oating system that 
creates a nonlinear force in the mooring line as the water 
level rises. The design force  F  need only be accurate in the

A laboratory apparatus used in some universities is shown 
in Fig. D2.2. The purpose is to measure the hydrostatic 
force on the fl at face of the circular-arc block and compare 
it with the theoretical value for given depth  h . The counter-
weight is arranged so that the pivot arm is horizontal when 
the block is not submerged, whence the weight  W  can be 
correlated with the hydrostatic force when the submerged 
arm is again brought to horizontal. First show that the 
 apparatus concept is valid in principle; then derive a for-
mula for  W  as a function of  h  in terms of the system param-
eters. Finally, suggest some appropriate values of  Y ,  L , and 
so on for a suitable apparatus and plot theoretical  W versus 
 h for these values.

The Leary Engineering Company (see  Popular Science, 
November 2000, p. 14) has proposed a ship hull with 
hinges that allow it to open into a fl atter shape when enter-
ing shallow water. A simplifi ed version is shown in 
Fig. D2.3. In deep water, the hull cross section would be 
triangular, with large draft. In shallow water, the hinges 
would open to an angle as high as  θ  5 45 8 . The dashed line 
indicates that the bow and stern would be closed. Make a 
parametric study of this confi guration for various  θ , assum-
ing a reasonable weight and center of gravity location. 
Show how the draft, the metacentric height, and the ship’s 
stability vary as the hinges are opened. Comment on the 
effectiveness of this concept.

 Chapter 3 
 Integral Relations 
for a Control Volume 
 Motivation.  In analyzing fl uid motion, we might take one of two paths: (1) seeking to 
describe the detailed fl ow pattern at every point ( x ,  y ,  z ) in the fi eld or (2) working with 
a fi nite region, making a balance of fl ow in versus fl ow out, and determining gross fl ow 
effects such as the force or torque on a body or the total energy exchange. The second 
is the “control volume” method and is the subject of this chapter. The fi rst is the 
 “differential” approach and is developed in Chap. 4. 
 
We fi rst develop the concept of the control volume, in nearly the same manner as 
one does in a thermodynamics course, and we fi nd the rate of change of an arbitrary 
gross fl uid property, a result called the  Reynolds transport theorem.  We then apply this 
theorem, in sequence, to mass, linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy, thus 
deriving the four basic control volume relations of fl uid mechanics. There are many 
applications, of course. The chapter includes a special case of frictionless,  shaft-work-free 
momentum and energy: the  Bernoulli equation.  The Bernoulli equation is a wonderful, 
historic relation, but it is extremely restrictive and should always be viewed with 
skepticism and care in applying it to a real (viscous) fl uid motion. 
 3.1 Basic Physical Laws 
of Fluid Mechanics
 
It is time now to really get serious about fl ow problems. The fl uid statics applications 
of Chap. 2 were more like fun than work, at least in this writer’s opinion. Statics 
problems basically require only the density of the fl uid and knowledge of the position 
of the free surface, but most fl ow problems require the analysis of an arbitrary state 
of variable fl uid motion defi ned by the geometry, the boundary conditions, and the 
laws of mechanics. This chapter and the next two outline the three basic approaches 
to the analysis of arbitrary fl ow problems: 
 1. Control volume, or large-scale, analysis (Chap. 3). 
 2. Differential, or small-scale, analysis (Chap. 4). 
 3. Experimental, or dimensional, analysis (Chap. 5). 

134 Chapter 3 Integral Relations for a Control Volume
 The three approaches are roughly equal in importance. Control volume analysis, the 
present topic, is accurate for any fl ow distribution but is often based on average or 
 “one-dimensional” property values at the boundaries. It always gives useful  “engineering” 
estimates. In principle, the differential equation approach of Chap. 4 can be applied to 
any problem. Only a few problems, such as straight pipe fl ow, yield to exact analytical 
solutions. But the differential equations can be modeled numerically, and the fl ourishing 
fi eld of computational fl uid dynamics (CFD)[8] can now be used to give good estimates 
for almost any geometry. Finally, the dimensional analysis of Chap. 5 applies to any 
problem, whether analytical, numerical, or experimental. It is particularly useful to reduce 
the cost of experimentation. Differential analysis of hydrodynamics began with Euler and 
d’Alembert in the late eighteenth century. Lord Rayleigh and E. Buckingham pioneered 
dimensional analysis at the end of the nineteenth century. The control volume was 
described in words, on an ad hoc one-case basis, by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753. Ludwig 
Prandtl, the celebrated founder of modern fl uid mechanics, developed the control volume 
as a systematic tool in the early 1900s. The writer’s teachers at M.I.T. introduced control 
volume analysis into American textbooks, for thermodynamics by Keenan in 1941 [10], 
and for fl uids by Hunsaker and Rightmire in 1947 [11]. For a complete history of the 
control volume, see  Vincenti [9]. 
 Systems versus Control Volumes
 
All the laws of mechanics are written for a  system ,  which is defi ned as an arbitrary 
quantity of mass of fi xed identity. Everything external to this system is denoted by 
the term  surroundings,  and the system is separated from its surroundings by its  bound-
aries . The laws of mechanics then state what happens when there is an interaction 
between the system and its surroundings. 
    
First, the system is a fi xed quantity of mass, denoted by  m . Thus the mass of the 
system is conserved and does not change. 1  This is a law of mechanics and has a very 
simple mathematical form, called  conserv a tion of mass: 
 msyst 5 const 
 or 
 dm
dt 5 0
 
 (3.1) 
  This is so obvious in solid mechanics problems that we often forget about it. In fl uid 
mechanics, we must pay a lot of attention to mass conservation, and it takes a little 
analysis to make it hold. 
  
Second, if the surroundings exert a net force  F  on the system, Newton’s second 
law states that the mass in the system will begin to accelerate: 2 
 
  F 5 ma 5 m dV
dt 5 d
dt
 (mV) 
 (3.2) 
   In Eq. (2.8) we saw this relation applied to a differential element of viscous incom-
pressible fl uid. In fl uid mechanics Newton’s second law is called the linear momentum 
relation. Note that it is a vector law that implies the three scalar equations  F x  5  ma x , 
 F y  5  ma y , and  F z  5  ma z . 
 1 We are neglecting nuclear reactions, where mass can be changed to energy.
 2 We are neglecting relativistic effects, where Newton’s law must be modifi ed.

3.1  Basic Physical Laws of Fluid Mechanics 135
  
Third, if the surroundings exert a net moment  M  about the center of mass of the 
system, there will be a rotation effect 
 
 M 5 dH
dt  
(3.3) 
 where  H  5  S ( r  3  V ) δ m  is the angular momentum of the system about its center of 
mass. Here we call Eq. (3.3) the angular momentum relation. Note that it is also a 
vector equation implying three scalar equations such as  M x  5  dH x / dt . 
  
For an arbitrary mass and arbitrary moment,  H  is quite complicated and contains 
nine terms (see, for example, Ref. 1). In elementary dynamics we commonly treat 
only a rigid body rotating about a fi xed  x axis, for which Eq. (3.3) reduces to 
 
  Mx 5 Ix d
dt (ωx) 
(3.4) 
 where  ω x  is the angular velocity of the body and  I x  is its mass moment of inertia 
about the  x  axis. Unfortunately, fl uid systems are not rigid and rarely reduce to such 
a simple relation, as we shall see in Sec. 3.6. 
  
Fourth, if heat  δ Q  is added to the system or work  δ W  is done by the system, the 
system energy  dE  must change according to the energy relation, or fi rst law of 
thermodynamics: 
 
δQ 2 δW 5 dE 
 or 
 Q
#
2 W
#
5 dE
dt  
 (3.5) 
 Like mass conservation, Eq. (3.1), this is a scalar relation having only a single 
component. 
  
Finally, the second law of thermodynamics relates entropy change  dS  to heat added 
 dQ and absolute temperature  T: 
 
 dS $ δQ
T  
(3.6) 
 This is valid for a system and can be written in control volume form, but there are 
almost no practical applications in fl uid mechanics except to analyze fl ow loss details 
(see Sec. 9.5). 
  
All these laws involve thermodynamic properties, and thus we must supplement 
them with state relations  p  5  p ( ρ ,  T ) and  e  5  e ( ρ ,  T ) for the particular fl uid being 
studied, as in Sec. 1.8. Although thermodynamics is not the main topic of this book, 
it is very important to the general study of fl uid mechanics. Thermodynamics is crucial 
to compressible fl ow, Chap. 9. The student should review the fi rst law and the state 
relations, as discussed in Refs. 6 and 7. 
  
The purpose of this chapter is to put our four basic laws into the control volume 
form suitable for arbitrary regions in a fl ow: 
 1. Conservation of mass (Sec. 3.3). 
 2. The linear momentum relation (Sec. 3.4). 
 3. The angular momentum relation (Sec. 3.6). 
 4. The energy equation (Sec. 3.7). 

136 Chapter 3 Integral Relations for a Control Volume
 Wherever necessary to complete the analysis we also introduce a state relation such 
as the perfect-gas law. 
  
Equations (3.1) to (3.6) apply to either fl uid or solid systems. They are ideal for solid 
mechanics, where we follow the same system forever because it represents the product 
we are designing and building. For example, we follow a beam as it defl ects under load. 
We follow a piston as it oscillates. We follow a rocket system all the way to Mars. 
 
But fl uid systems do not demand this concentrated attention. It is rare that we wish 
to follow the ultimate path of a specifi c particle of fl uid. Instead it is likely that the 
fl uid forms the environment whose effect on our product we wish to know. For the 
three examples just cited, we wish to know the wind loads on the beam, the fl uid 
pressures on the piston, and the drag and lift loads on the rocket. This requires that 
the basic laws be rewritten to apply to a specifi c  region  in the neighborhood of our 
product. In other words, where the fl uid particles in the wind go after they leave the 
beam is of little interest to a beam designer. The user’s point of view underlies the 
need for the control volume analysis of this chapter. 
  
In analyzing a control volume, we convert the system laws to apply to a specifi c 
region, which the system may occupy for only an instant. The system passes on, and 
other systems come along, but no matter. The basic laws are reformulated to apply to 
this local region called a control volume. All we need to know is the fl ow fi eld in this 
region, and often simple assumptions will be accurate enough (such as uniform inlet 
and/or outlet fl ows). The fl ow conditions away from the control volume are then irrel-
evant. The technique for making such localized analyses is the subject of this chapter. 
 Volume and Mass Rate of Flow
 
All the analyses in this chapter involve evaluation of the volume fl ow  Q  or mass fl ow 
 m#   passing through a surface (imaginary) defi ned in the fl ow. 
  
Suppose that the surface  S  in Fig. 3.1 a  is a sort of (imaginary) wire mesh through 
which the fl uid passes without resistance. How much volume of fl uid passes through  S 
in unit time? If, typically,  V  varies with position, we must integrate over the elemental 
surface  dA  in Fig. 3.1 a . Also, typically  V  may pass through  dA  at an angle  θ  off the 
normal. Let  n be defi ned as the unit vector normal to  dA . Then the amount of fl uid 
swept through  dA in time  dt is the volume of the slanted parallelepiped in Fig.  3.1 b :

( b ) the incremental volume swept

3.2  The Reynolds Transport Theorem 137
 The integral of  d 9 / dt is the total volume rate of fl ow  Q through the surface  S : 
 
 Q 5 #
s
(V ? n) dA 5 #
s
Vn dA 
 (3.7) 
 We could replace  V  ?  n  by its equivalent,  V n , the component of  V  normal to  dA , but 
the use of the dot product allows  Q to have a sign to distinguish between infl ow and 
outfl ow. By convention throughout this book we consider  n  to be the  outward normal 
unit vector. Therefore  V  ?  n  denotes outfl ow if it is positive and infl ow if negative. 
This will be an extremely useful housekeeping device when we are computing volume 
and mass fl ow in the basic control volume relations. 
 
Volume fl ow can be multiplied by density to obtain the mass fl ow  m#  . If density 
varies over the surface, it must be part of the surface integral: 
 m# 5 #
s
ρ(V ? n) dA 5 #
s
ρVn dA 
 If density and velocity are constant over the surface  S , a simple expression results: 
 One-dimensional approximation: 
m# 5 ρQ 5 ρAV 
 Typical units for  Q are m 3 /s and for m#  kg/s. 
 3.2 The Reynolds Transport 
Theorem
 
To convert a system analysis to a control volume analysis, we must convert our 
mathematics to apply to a specifi c region rather than to individual masses. This con-
version, called the  Reynolds transport the o rem , can be applied to all the basic laws. 
Examining the basic laws (3.1) to (3.3) and (3.5), we see that they are all concerned 
with the time derivative of fl uid properties  m ,  V ,  H , and  E . Therefore what we need 
is to relate the time derivative of a system property to the rate of change of that 
property within a certain region. 
    
The desired conversion formula differs slightly according to whether the con-
trol volume is fi xed, moving, or deformable. Figure 3.2 illustrates these three 
cases. The fi xed control volume in Fig. 3.2 a  encloses a stationary region of inter-
est to a nozzle designer. The control surface is an abstract concept and does not 
hinder the fl ow in any way. It slices through the jet leaving the nozzle, encloses 
the surrounding atmosphere, and slices through the fl ange bolts and the fl uid within 
the nozzle. This particular control volume exposes the stresses in the fl ange bolts,

which contribute to applied forces in the momentum analysis. In this sense the 
control volume resembles the  free-body  concept, which is applied to systems in 
solid mechanics analyses. 
 
Figure 3.2 b  illustrates a moving control volume. Here the ship is of interest, not 
the ocean, so that the control surface chases the ship at ship speed  V . The control 
volume is of fi xed volume, but the relative motion between water and ship must be 
considered. If  V  is constant, this relative motion is a steady fl ow pattern, which sim-
plifi es the analysis. 3  If  V  is variable, the relative motion is unsteady, so that the 
computed results are time-variable and certain terms enter the momentum analysis to 
refl ect the noninertial (accelerating) frame of reference.  
 
Figure 3.2 c  shows a deforming control volume. Varying relative motion at the 
boundaries becomes a factor, and the rate of change of shape of the control volume 
enters the analysis. We begin by deriving the fi xed control volume case, and we con-
sider the other cases as advanced topics. An interesting history of control volume 
analysis is given by Vincenti [9]. 
 Arbitrary Fixed Control Volume
 
Figure 3.3 shows a fi xed control volume with an arbitrary fl ow pattern passing through. 
There are variable slivers of infl ow and outfl ow of fl uid all about the control surface. 
In general, each differential area  dA  of surface will have a different velocity  V making 
a different angle  θ  with the local normal to  dA . Some elemental areas will have

Let  B  be any property of the fl uid (energy, momentum, enthalpy, etc.) and let  β  5
d B / dm  be the  i n tensive  value, or the amount of  B  per unit mass in any small element 
of the fl uid. The total amount of  B  in the control volume (the solid curve in Fig. 3.3) 
is thus

The notations CV and CS refer to the control volume and control surface, respec-
tively. Note, in Fig. 3.3, that the  system has moved a bit. In the limit as dt S 0, the 
instantaneous change of  B  in the system is the sum of the change within, plus the

 This is the  Reynolds transport theorem  for an arbitrary fi xed control volume. By let-
ting the property  B  be mass, momentum, angular momentum, or energy, we can 
rewrite all the basic laws in control volume form. Note that all three of the integrals 
are concerned with the intensive property  β . Since the control volume is fi xed in 
space, the elemental volumes  d 9  do not vary with time, so that the time derivative 
of the volume integral vanishes unless either  β  or  ρ  varies with time (unsteady fl ow). 
  
Equation (3.10) expresses the basic formula that a system derivative equals the rate 
of change of  B  within the control volume plus the fl ow of  B  out of the control surface 
minus the fl ow of  B  into the control surface. The quantity  B  (or  β ) may be any vector 
or scalar property of the fl uid. Two alternate forms are possible for the fl ow terms. 
First we may notice that  V  cos  θ  is the component of  V  normal to the area element 
of the control surface. Thus we can write

in

 where  dm#   5  ρ V n  dA  is the differential mass fl ow through the surface. Form (3.10 a ) 
helps us visualize what is being calculated.

A second, alternative form offers elegance and compactness as advantages. If  n
is defi ned as the  outward  normal unit vector everywhere on the control surface, then 
V  ?  n  5  V n  for outfl ow and  V  ?  n  5  2 V n  for infl ow. Therefore the fl ow terms can 
be represented by a single integral involving  V  ?  n  that accounts for both positive 
outfl ow and negative infl ow:

 This is beautiful but only occasionally useful, when the coordinate system is ide-

when the fl ow of  B  out is added and the fl ow of  B  in is subtracted, according to 
Eqs. (3.10) or (3.11).

Control Volume Moving at 
Constant Velocity
 
If the control volume is moving uniformly at velocity  V s , as in Fig. 3.2 b , an observer 
fi xed to the control volume will see a relative velocity  V r  of fl uid crossing the control 
surface, defi ned by 
Vr 5 V 2 Vs 
 (3.14)
 where  V is the fl uid velocity relative to the same coordinate system in which the control 
volume motion  V s  is observed. Note that Eq. (3.14) is a vector subtraction. The fl ow 
terms will be proportional to  V r , but the volume integral of Eq. (3.12) is unchanged 
because the control volume moves as a fi xed shape without deforming. The Reynolds 
transport theorem for this case of a uniformly moving control volume is

 which reduces to Eq. (3.12) if  V s  ; 0. 
Control Volume of Constant 
Shape but Variable Velocity4
 
If the control volume moves with a velocity  V s ( t ) that retains its shape, then the 
volume elements do not change with time, but the boundary relative velocity  V r  5
V ( r ,  t )  2  V s ( t ) becomes a somewhat more complicated function. Equation (3.15) is 
unchanged in form, but the area integral may be more laborious to evaluate. 
4 This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

3.2  The Reynolds Transport Theorem 141
Arbitrarily Moving and 
Deformable Control Volume5
 
The most general situation is when the control volume is both moving and deforming 
arbitrarily, as illustrated in Fig. 3.4. The fl ow of volume across the control surface is 
again proportional to the relative normal velocity component  V r  ?  n , as in Eq.   (3.15). 
However, since the control surface has a deformation, its velocity  V s  5  V s ( r ,  t ), so 
that the relative velocity  V r  5  V ( r ,  t )  2  V s ( r ,  t ) is or can be a complicated function, 
even though the fl ow integral is the same as in Eq. (3.15). Meanwhile, the volume 
integral in Eq. (3.15) must allow the volume elements to distort with time. Thus the 
time derivative must be applied  after  integration. For the deforming control volume, 
then, the transport theorem takes the form 
d
dt (Bsyst) 5 d
dt a#
CV
 βρ d 9b 1 #
CS
 βρ(Vr ? n) dA  
 (3.16)
 This is the most general case, which we can compare with the equivalent form for a

0t (βρ) d9 1 #

 (3.17)
 The moving and deforming control volume, Eq. (3.16), contains only two complica-
tions: (1) The time derivative of the fi rst integral on the right must be taken outside, 
and (2) the second integral involves the  rel a tive  velocity  V r  between the fl uid system 
and the control surface. These differences and mathematical subtleties are best shown 
by examples.

 One-Dimensional Flux Term 
Approximations
 
In many situations, the fl ow crosses the boundaries of the control surface only at 
simplifi ed inlets and exits that are approximately  one-dimensional;  that is, fl ow prop-
erties are nearly uniform over the cross section. For a fi xed control volume, the surface 
integral in Eq. (3.12) reduces to a sum of positive (outlet) and negative (inlet) product 
terms for each cross section:

 To the writer, this is an attractive way to set up a control volume analysis without 
using the dot product notation. An example of multiple one-dimensional fl ows is

 •  S ystem sketch:  Figure E3.1 shows two inlet fl ows, 1 and 2, and a single outlet fl ow, 3. 
 •  Assumptions: Steady fl ow, fi xed control volume, one-dimensional inlet and exit fl ows.

 Ans. 
 Thus the system is losing energy at the rate of 0.24 MJ/s    5    0.24 MW. Since we have 
accounted for all fl uid energy crossing the boundary, we conclude from the fi rst law that 
there must be heat loss through the control surface, or the system must be doing work on 
the environment through some device not shown. Notice that the use of SI units leads to 
a consistent result in joules per second without any conversion factors. We promised in 
Chap. 1 that this would be the case. 
 •  Comments:  This problem involves energy, but suppose we check the balance of mass 
also. Then  B  5  mass  m , and  β  5  dm / dm  5    unity. Again the volume integral vanishes 
for steady fl ow, and Eq. (3.17) reduces to

 Thus the system mass does not change, which correctly expresses the law of conservation

 EXAMPLE 3.2 
 Compressed air in a rigid tank of volume  9  exhausts through a small nozzle as in Fig. E3.2. 
Air properties change through the nozzle, and the fl ow exits at  ρ o ,V o , A o . Find an expression 
for the rate of change of tank density. 
 Solution 
 • System sketch: Fig. E3.2 shows one exit, no inlets. The constant exit area is  A o . 
 • Control volume: As shown, we choose a CV that encircles the entire tank and nozzle. 
 • Assumptions: Unsteady fl ow (the tank mass decreases), one-dimensional exit fl ow. 
 • Approach: Apply Eq. (3.16) for mass,  B  5  m and  β  5  dm/dm  5 unity.

 • Comments:  This is a fi rst-order ordinary differential equation for the tank density. If we 
account for changes in  ρ o  and  V o  from the compressible-fl ow theories of Chap. 9, we can 
readily solve this equation for the tank density  ρ ( t ). 
  
For advanced study, many more details of the analysis of deformable control vol-
umes can be found in Hansen [4] and Potter et al. [5]. 
 3.3 Conservation of Mass
 
The Reynolds transport theorem, Eq. (3.16) or (3.17), establishes a relation between 
system rates of change and control volume surface and volume integrals. But system 
derivatives are related to the basic laws of mechanics, Eqs. (3.1) to (3.5). Eliminating 
system derivatives between the two gives the control volume, or  integral,  forms of 
the laws of mechanics of fl uids. The dummy variable  B  becomes, respectively, mass, 
linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy. 
    
For conservation of mass, as discussed in Examples 3.1 and 3.2,  B  5  m  and  β  5

then 0ρ/0t ; 0, and Eq. (3.21) reduces to 
 
#
CS
 ρ(V ? n) dA 5 0 
 (3.23)
 This states that in steady fl ow the mass fl ows entering and leaving the control volume

 This simple approximation is widely used in engineering analyses. For example, refer-

cross section and has consistent units of kilograms per second (or slugs per second) 
for SI (or BG) units. Equation (3.25) can be rewritten in the short form

 where “cs” stands for cross section. An illustration of this is given in Example 3.4. 
6 Throughout this section we are neglecting  sources or  sinks of mass that might be embedded in the 
control volume. Equations (3.20) and (3.21) can readily be modifi ed to add source and sink terms, but 
this is rarely necessary. 

146 Chapter 3 Integral Relations for a Control Volume
 Incompressible Flow
 
Still further simplifi cation is possible if the fl uid is incompressible, which we may 
defi ne as having density variations that are negligible in the mass conservation require-
ment. 7  As we saw in Chap. 1, all liquids are nearly incompressible, and gas fl ows can 
 behave  as if they were incompressible, particularly if the gas velocity is less than 
about 30 percent of the speed of sound of the gas. 
  
Again consider the fi xed control volume. For nearly incompressible fl ow, the term 
0ρ/0t is small, so the time-derivative volume integral in Eq. (3.21) can be neglected. The 
constant density can then be removed from the surface integral for a nice simplifi cation:

Again, if consistent units are used,  Q  5  VA  will have units of cubic meters per

we have to integrate

 (3.32) 
 This could be called the  volume-average velocity . If the density varies across the sec-
tion, we can defi ne an average density in the same manner: 
 
ρav 5 1
A#ρ dA 
 (3.33) 
 But the mass fl ow would contain the product of density and velocity, and the average 
product ( ρ V ) av would in general have a different value from the product of the averages: 
 
(ρV)av 5 1
A#ρ(V ? n) dA < ρavVav 
 (3.34) 
 7 Be warned that there is subjectivity in specifying incompressibility. Oceanographers consider a 0.1 percent 
density variation very signifi cant, while aerodynamicists may neglect density variations in highly compressible, 
even hypersonic, gas fl ows. Your task is to justify the incompressible approximation when you make it. 

3.3  Conservation of Mass 147
 We illustrate average velocity in Example 3.4. We can often neglect the difference 
or, if necessary, use a correction factor between mass average and volume average. 
 EXAMPLE 3.3 
 Write the conservation-of-mass relation for steady fl ow through a streamtube (fl ow every-
where parallel to the walls) with a single one-dimensional inlet 1 and exit 2 (Fig.  E3.3). 
 Solution 
 For steady fl ow Eq. (3.24) applies with the single inlet and exit: 
 m# 5 ρ1A1V1 5 ρ2A2V2 5 const 
 Thus, in a streamtube in steady fl ow, the mass fl ow is constant across every section of the 
tube. If the density is constant, then 
 Q 5 A1V1 5 A2V2 5 const  or  V2 5 A1

 The volume fl ow is constant in the tube in steady incompressible fl ow, and the velocity 
increases as the section area decreases. This relation was derived by Leonardo da Vinci 
in 1500.

no exact turbulent theory, and so we accept this  approximation.) The turbulent velocity 
profi le is more uniform across the section, and thus the average velocity is only slightly

3.4  The Linear Momentum Equation 149
 
The control volume mass relations, Eq. (3.20) or (3.21), are fundamental to all 
fl uid fl ow analyses. They involve only velocity and density. Vector directions are of 
no consequence except to determine the normal velocity at the surface and hence 
whether the fl ow is  in  or  out . Although your specifi c analysis may concern forces or 
moments or energy, you must always make sure that mass is balanced as part of the 
analysis; otherwise the results will be unrealistic and probably incorrect. We shall see 
in the examples that follow how mass conservation is constantly checked in perform-
ing an analysis of other fl uid properties. 
 3.4 The Linear Momentum 
Equation
 
In Newton’s second law, Eq. (3.2), the property being differentiated is the linear 
momentum  m V . Therefore our dummy variable is  B  5  m V  and  β  5  d B / dm  5  V , 
and application of the Reynolds transport theorem gives the linear momentum relation 
for a deformable control volume: 
 
d
dt (mV)syst 5 a F 5 d
dt a#
CV
Vρ d 9b 1 #
CS
Vρ(Vr ? n) dA 
 (3.35) 
 The following points concerning this relation should be strongly emphasized: 
 1. The term  V is the fl uid velocity relative to an  inertial (nonaccelerating) 
coordinate system; otherwise Newton’s second law must be modifi ed to 
include noninertial relative acceleration terms (see the end of this section). 
 2. The term  S  F is the  vector sum of all forces acting on the system material 
considered as a free body; that is, it includes surface forces on all fl uids 
and solids cut by the control surface plus all body forces (gravity and 
electromagnetic) acting on the masses within the control volume. 
 3. The entire equation is a vector relation; both the integrals are vectors due to 
the term  V in the integrands. The equation thus has three components. If we 
want only, say, the  x component, the equation reduces to 
 
a Fx 5 d
dt a#
CV
 uρ d 9b 1 #
CS
 uρ(Vr ? n) dA 
 (3.36) 
 
and similarly,  S  F y and  S  F z would involve  v and  w , respectively. Failure to 
account for the vector nature of the linear momentum relation (3.35) is probably 
the greatest source of student error in control volume analyses.

 Again we stress that this is a vector relation and that  V  must be an inertial-frame 
velocity. Most of the momentum analyses in this text are concerned with Eq.   (3.37).

 One-Dimensional Momentum Flux 
By analogy with the term  mass fl ow  used in Eq. (3.28), the surface integral in Eq. (3.37) 
is called the  m o mentum fl ow term. If we denote momentum by  M , then 
M

CS 5 #
sec
Vρ(V ? n) dA 
 (3.38)
 Because of the dot product, the result will be negative for inlet momentum fl ow and 
positive for outlet fl ow. If the cross section is one-dimensional,  V  and  ρ  are uniform 
over the area and the integrated result is 
M
#
seci 5 Vi(ρiVni Ai) 5 m#
iVi 
 (3.39)
 for outlet fl ow and  2m#
iVi  for inlet fl ow. Thus if the control volume has only one-
dimensional inlets and outlets, Eq. (3.37) reduces to

Vρ d 9b 1 a (m#

 (3.40)
 This is a commonly used approximation in engineering analyses. It is crucial to realize 
that we are dealing with vector sums. Equation (3.40) states that the net vector force 
on a fi xed control volume equals the rate of change of vector momentum within the 
control volume plus the vector sum of outlet momentum fl ows minus the vector sum 
of inlet fl ows. 
Net Pressure Force on a Closed 
Control Surface
 
Generally speaking, the surface forces on a control volume are due to (1) forces 
exposed by cutting through solid bodies that protrude through the surface and (2) forces 
due to pressure and viscous stresses of the surrounding fl uid. The computation of 
pressure force is relatively simple, as shown in Fig.  3.6. Recall from Chap.   2 that

(b) nonuniform pressure, 
F 5 2#( p 2 pa)n dA.

3.4  The Linear Momentum Equation 151
the external pressure force on a surface is normal to the surface and  inward. Since 
the unit vector  n is defi ned as  outward,  one way to write the pressure force is 
 
Fpress 5 #
CS
 p(2n) dA 
 (3.41) 
 Now if the pressure has a uniform value  p a  all around the surface, as in Fig. 3.7 a , 
the net pressure force is zero: 
 
FUP 5 #pa(2n)dA 5 2pa#n dA ; 0 
 (3.42) 
 where the subscript UP stands for uniform pressure. This result is  independent of the shape 
of the su r face 8  as long as the surface is closed and all our control volumes are closed. 
Thus a seemingly complicated pressure force problem can be simplifi ed by subtracting 
any convenient uniform pressure  p a  and working only with the pieces of gage pressure 
that remain, as illustrated in Fig. 3.6 b . So Eq. (3.41) is entirely equivalent to 
 
Fpress 5 #
CS
(p 2 pa)(2n)dA 5 #
CS
pgage(2n) dA 
 
 This trick can mean quite a savings in computation. 
 EXAMPLE 3.6 
 A control volume of a nozzle section has surface pressures of 40 lbf/in 2  absolute at section 1 
and atmospheric pressure of 15 lbf/in 2  absolute at section 2 and on the external rounded part 
of the nozzle, as in Fig. E3.6 a . Compute the net pressure force if  D 1  5    3 in and  D 2  5  1 in. 
 Solution 
 •  S ystem sketch:  The control volume is the  outside  of the nozzle, plus the cut sections (1)  
 and (2). There would also be  stresses  in the cut nozzle wall at section 1, which we are 
neglecting here. The pressures acting on the control volume are shown in Fig. E3.6 a . 
Figure E3.6 b  shows the pressures after 15 lbf/in 2  has been subtracted from all sides. Here 
we compute the net pressure force only. 
  8 Can you prove this? It is a consequence of Gauss’s theorem from vector analysis.

 •  Assumptions: Known pressures, as shown, on all surfaces of the control volume. 
 •  Approach:  Since three surfaces have  p  5  15 lbf/in 2 , subtract this amount everywhere so 
that these three sides reduce to zero “gage pressure” for convenience. This is allowable 
because of Eq. (3.42). 
 •  Solution steps:  For the modifi ed pressure distribution, Fig. E3.6 b , only section 1 is 
needed:

 Ans. 
 •  Comments:  This “uniform subtraction” artifi ce, which is entirely legal, has greatly sim-
plifi ed the calculation of pressure force.  Note:  We were a bit too informal when multiply-
ing pressure in lbf/in 2 times area in square inches. We achieved lbf correctly, but it would 
be better practice to convert all data to standard BG units.  Further note:  In addition to 
 F press , there are other forces involved in this fl ow, due to tension stresses in the cut nozzle 
wall and the fl uid weight inside the control volume. 
 Pressure Condition at a Jet Exit
 
Figure E3.6 illustrates a pressure boundary condition commonly used for jet exit fl ow 
problems. When a fl uid fl ow leaves a confi ned internal duct and exits into an ambient 
“atmosphere,” its free surface is exposed to that atmosphere. Therefore the jet itself 
will essentially be at atmospheric pressure also. This condition was used at section 2 
in Fig. E3.6. 
    
Only two effects could maintain a pressure difference between the atmosphere and 
a free exit jet. The fi rst is surface tension, Eq. (1.31), which is usually negligible. The 
second effect is a  supersonic  jet, which can separate itself from an atmosphere with 
expansion or compression waves (Chap. 9). For the majority of applications, therefore, 
we shall set the pressure in an exit jet as atmospheric. 
 EXAMPLE 3.7 
 A fi xed control volume of a streamtube in steady fl ow has a uniform inlet fl ow ( ρ 1 ,  A 1 ,  V 1 ) 
and a uniform exit fl ow ( ρ 2 ,  A 2 ,  V 2 ), as shown in Fig. 3.7. Find an expression for the net

 Therefore a simple form for the desired result is 
 
a F 5 m# (V2 2 V1) 
 Ans. 
 This is a  vector  relation and is sketched in Fig. 3.7 b . The term  S  F  represents the net force 
acting on the control volume due to all causes; it is needed to balance the change in momen-
tum of the fl uid as it turns and decelerates while passing through the control volume. 
 EXAMPLE 3.8 
 As shown in Fig. 3.8 a , a fi xed vane turns a water jet of area  A  through an angle  θ without 
changing its velocity magnitude. The fl ow is steady, pressure is  p a  everywhere, and friction 
on the vane is negligible. ( a ) Find the components  F x  and  F y  of the applied vane force.

Part (a) 
   The control volume selected in Fig. 3.8 a cuts through the inlet and exit of the jet and through the 
vane support, exposing the vane force  F . Since there is no cut along the vane–jet interface, vane 
 friction is internally self-canceling. The pressure force is zero in the uniform atmosphere. We  neglect 
the weight of fl uid and the vane weight within the control volume. Then Eq. (3.40) reduces to

 Ans. (b) 
 These can be plotted versus  θ  as shown in Fig. E3.8. Two special cases are of interest. First, 
the maximum force occurs at  θ  5  180 8 —that is, when the jet is turned around and thrown 
back in the opposite direction with its momentum completely reversed. This force is  2m# V 
and acts to the  left ; that is,  ϕ  5  180 8 . Second, at very small turning angles ( θ  , 10 8 ) we 
obtain approximately 
 F < m# Vθ    ϕ < 90° 
 The force is linearly proportional to the turning angle and acts nearly normal to the jet. This 
is the principle of a lifting vane, or airfoil, which causes a slight change in the oncoming 
fl ow direction and thereby creates a lift force normal to the basic fl ow. 
 EXAMPLE 3.9 
 A water jet of velocity  V j impinges normal to a fl at plate that moves to the right at velocity 
 V c , as shown in Fig. 3.9 a . Find the force required to keep the plate moving at constant veloc-
ity if the jet density is 1000 kg/m 3 , the jet area is 3 cm 2 , and  V j  and  V c  are 20 and 15   m/s, 
respectively. Neglect the weight of the jet and plate, and assume steady fl ow with respect to 
the moving plate with the jet splitting into an equal upward and downward half-jet. 

3.4  The Linear Momentum Equation 155
 Solution 
 The suggested control volume in Fig. 3.9 a  cuts through the plate support to expose the desired 
forces  R x  and  R y . This control volume moves at speed  V c  and thus is fi xed relative to the 
plate, as in Fig. 3.9 b . We must satisfy both mass and momentum conservation for the assumed 
steady fl ow pattern in Fig. 3.9 b . There are two outlets and one inlet, and Eq.   (3.30) applies 
for mass conservation: 
 m#
out 5 m#
in 
 or 
 ρ1A1V1 1 ρ2A2V2 5 ρjAj(Vj 2 Vc) 
 (1) 
 We assume that the water is incompressible  ρ 1  5  ρ 2  5  ρ j , and we are given that  A 1  5  A 2  5  1
2 A j . 
Therefore Eq. (1) reduces to 
 
V1 1 V2 5 2(Vj 2 Vc) 
 (2) 
 Strictly speaking, this is all that mass conservation tells us. However, from the symmetry 
of the jet defl ection and the neglect of gravity on the fl uid trajectory, we conclude that the 
two velocities  V 1 and  V 2 must be equal, and hence Eq. (2) becomes 
 
V1 5 V2 5 Vj 2 Vc 
 (3) 
 This equality can also be predicted by Bernoulli’s equation in Sec. 3.5. For the given numeri-
cal values, we have 
 V1 5 V2 5 20 2 15 5 5 m/s 
 Now we can compute  R x and  R y  from the two components of momentum conservation.

 This acts to the  left ; that is, it requires a restraining force to keep the plate from accelerating

 But since we found earlier that  V 1  5  V 2 , this means that  R y  5    0, as we could expect from 
the symmetry of the jet defl ection. 9  Two other results are of interest. First, the relative velocity 
at section 1 was found to be 5 m/s up, from Eq. (3). If we convert this to absolute motion by 
adding on the control-volume speed  V c  5    15 m/s to the right, we fi nd that the absolute velocity 
 V 1  5  15 i  1  5 j m/s, or 15.8 m/s at an angle of 18.4 8 upward, as indicated in Fig.  3.9 a . Thus 
the absolute jet speed changes after hitting the plate. Second, the computed force  R x  does not 
change if we assume the jet defl ects in all radial directions along the plate surface rather than 
just up and down. Since the plate is normal to the  x  axis, there would still be zero outlet 
 x -momentum fl ow when Eq. (4) was rewritten for a radial defl ection condition. 
 EXAMPLE 3.10 
 The sluice gate in Fig. E3.10 a  controls fl ow in open channels. At sections 1 and 2, the fl ow 
is uniform and the pressure is hydrostatic. Neglecting bottom friction and atmospheric pres-
sure, derive a formula for the horizontal force  F  required to hold the gate. Express your 
fi nal formula in terms of the inlet velocity  V 1 , eliminating  V 2 .

 Solution 
 Choose a control volume, Fig. E3.10b, that cuts through known regions (section 1 and sec-

information is desired (the gate, with its force  F ).

 We may use gage pressures for convenience because a uniform atmospheric pressure causes

 This is a powerful result from a relatively simple analysis. Later, in Sec. 10.4, we will be 
able to calculate the actual fl ow rate from the water depths and the gate opening height. 
 EXAMPLE 3.11 
 Example 3.9 treated a plate at normal incidence to an oncoming fl ow. In Fig. 3.10 the plate is 
parallel to the fl ow. The stream is not a jet but a broad river, or  free stream,  of uniform veloc-
ity  V  5  U 0 i . The pressure is assumed uniform, and so it has no net force on the plate. The 
plate does not block the fl ow as in Fig. 3.9, so the only effect is due to boundary shear, which 
was neglected in the previous example. The no-slip condition at the wall brings the fl uid there 
to a halt, and these slowly moving particles retard their neighbors above, so that at the end of 
the plate there is a signifi cant retarded shear layer, or  boundary layer,  of thickness  y  5  δ . The 
viscous stresses along the wall can sum to a fi nite drag force on the plate. These effects are 
illustrated in Fig. 3.10. The problem is to make an integral analysis and fi nd the drag force  D  
in terms of the fl ow properties  ρ ,  U 0 , and  δ  and the plate dimensions  L  and  b . 10  
 Solution 
 Like most practical cases, this problem requires a combined mass and momentum balance.

0 to  h  to  δ  to  L  and back to the origin 0, as shown in Fig. 3.10. Had we chosen to cut across 
horizontally from left to right along the height  y  5  h , we would have cut through the shear 
layer and exposed unknown shear stresses. Instead we follow the streamline passing through 
( x ,  y )  5  (0,  h ), which is outside the shear layer and also has no mass fl ow across it. The four 
control volume sides are thus 
 1. From (0, 0) to (0,  h ): a one-dimensional inlet,  V  ?  n  5  2 U 0 . 
 2. From (0,  h ) to ( L ,  δ ): a streamline, no shear,  V  ? n  5 0. 
 3. From ( L ,  δ ) to ( L , 0): a two-dimensional outlet,  V  ? n  5  1 u ( y ). 
 4. From ( L , 0) to (0, 0): a streamline just above the plate surface,  V  ? n  5 0, shear 
forces summing to the drag force  2 D i acting from the plate onto the retarded fl uid. 
 The pressure is uniform, and so there is no net pressure force. Since the fl ow is assumed 
incompressible and steady, Eq. (3.37) applies with no unsteady term and fl ows only across 
sections 1 and 3:

 This result was fi rst derived by Theodore von Kármán in 1921. 11  It relates the friction drag 
on one side of a fl at plate to the integral of the  momentum defi cit  ρ u ( U 0  2  u ) across the 
trailing cross section of the fl ow past the plate. Since  U 0  2  u  vanishes as  y  increases, the 
integral has a fi nite value. Equation (3) is an example of  momentum integral theory for 
boundary layers, which is treated in Chap. 7. 
 Momentum Flux Correction 
Factor
 
For fl ow in a duct, the axial velocity is usually nonuniform, as in Example 3.4. For 
this case the simple momentum fl ow calculation  euρ(V ? n) dA 5 m# V 5 ρAV2 is 
somewhat in error and should be corrected to  ζρ AV 2 , where  ζ  is the dimensionless 
momentum fl ow correction factor,  ζ  $  1. 
 
The factor  ζ  accounts for the variation of  u 2  across the duct section. That is, we 
compute the exact fl ow and set it equal to a fl ow based on average velocity in the duct:

      No te that the basic parameters and vector character of the result are not changed at 
all by this correction. 
 Linear Momentum Tips
 
The previous examples make it clear that the vector momentum equation is more 
diffi cult to handle than the scalar mass and energy equations. Here are some momen-
tum tips to remember: 
  
 The momentum relation is a  vector equation. The forces and the momentum 
terms are directional and can have three components. A  sketch of these vectors 
will be indispensable for the analysis. 
  
 The momentum fl ow terms, such as  e V ( ρ V  ?  n ) dA , link  two different sign 
conventions, so special care is needed. First, the vector coeffi cient  V will have a 
sign depending on its direction. Second, the mass fl ow term ( ρ V  ?  n ) will have a 
sign ( 1  ,  2 ) depending on whether it is (out, in). For example, in Fig. 3.8, the  x -
 components of  V 2 and  V 1 ,  u 2 and  u 1 , are both positive; that is, they both act to the 
right. Meanwhile, the mass fl ow at (2) is positive (out) and at (1) is negative (in). 
  
 The  one-dimensional approximation, Eq. (3.40), is glorious, because non-
uniform velocity distributions require laborious integration, as in Eq. (3.11). 
Thus the momentum fl ow correction factors  ζ are very useful in avoiding this 
integration, especially for pipe fl ow. 
  
 The applied forces  S F act on  all the material in the control v o lume —that is, 
the surfaces (pressure and shear stresses), the solid supports that are cut 
through, and the weight of the interior masses. Stresses on non-control-surface 
parts of the interior are self-canceling and should be ignored. 
  
 If the fl uid exits subsonically to an atmosphere, the fl uid pressure there is 
 atmospheric . 
  
 Where possible, choose inlet and outlet surfaces  normal to the fl ow, so that 
pressure is the dominant force and the normal velocity equals the actual velocity. 
 Clearly, with that many helpful tips, substantial practice is needed to achieve momen-
tum skills. 
 Noninertial Reference Frame12
 
All previous derivations and examples in this section have assumed that the coordinate 
system is inertial—that is, at rest or moving at constant velocity. In this case the rate 
of change of velocity equals the absolute acceleration of the system, and Newton’s 
law applies directly in the form of Eqs. (3.2) and (3.35). 
    
In many cases it is convenient to use a  noninertial,  or accelerating, coordinate 
system. An example would be coordinates fi xed to a rocket during takeoff. A second 
example is any fl ow on the earth’s surface, which is accelerating relative to the fi xed 
 12 This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

stars because of the rotation of the earth. Atmospheric and oceanographic fl ows expe-
rience the so-called  Coriolis acceleration,  outlined next. It is typically less than 10 2 5 g , 
where  g  is the acceleration of gravity, but its accumulated effect over distances of 
many kilometers can be dominant in geophysical fl ows. By contrast, the Coriolis 
acceleration is negligible in small-scale problems like pipe or airfoil fl ows. 
  
Suppose that the fl uid fl ow has velocity  V  relative to a noninertial  xyz coordinate 
system, as shown in Fig.  3.11. Then  d V / dt  will represent a noninertial acceleration 
that must be added vectorially to a relative acceleration  a rel  to give the absolute accel-
eration  a i relative to some inertial coordinate system  XYZ , as in Fig. 3.11. Thus

 Since Newton’s law applies to the absolute acceleration,

 or

 (3.45) 
 Thus Newton’s law in noninertial coordinates  xyz  is analogous to adding more “force” 
terms  2 m a rel  to account for noninertial effects. In the most general case, sketched in 
Fig.  3.11, the term  a rel  contains four parts, three of which account for the angular 
velocity  V ( t ) of the inertial coordinates. By inspection of Fig. 3.11, the absolute dis-
placement of a particle is

A  second differentiation gives the absolute acceleration:

 (3.48)
 By comparison with Eq. (3.44), we see that the last four terms on the right represent 
the additional relative acceleration: 
 1.  d2 R / dt 2 is the acceleration of the noninertial origin of coordinates  xyz . 
 2. ( d V / dt )  3  r is the angular acceleration effect. 
 3. 2 V  3  V is the Coriolis acceleration. 
 4.  V  3 ( V  3  r ) is the centripetal acceleration, directed from the particle normal 
to the axis of rotation with magnitude  V 2 L , where  L is the normal distance to 
the axis. 13 
 Equation (3.45) differs from Eq. (3.2) only in the added inertial forces on the left-hand 
side. Thus the control volume formulation of linear momentum in noninertial coordi-
nates merely adds inertial   terms by integrating the added relative acceleration over 
each differential mass in the control volume:

Th is is the noninertial analog of the inertial form given in Eq. (3.35). To analyze such 
problems, one must know the displacement  R  and angular velocity  V  of the nonin-
ertial coordinates.

pp. 49–51. 
 EXAMPLE 3.12 
 A classic example of an accelerating control volume is a rocket moving straight up, as in 
Fig. E3.12. Let the initial mass be  M 0 , and assume a steady exhaust mass fl ow  m#  and exhaust 
velocity  V e  relative to the rocket, as shown. If the fl ow pattern within the rocket motor is 
steady and air drag is neglected, derive the differential equation of vertical rocket motion 
V ( t ) and integrate using the initial condition  V  5  0 at  t  5  0.

 3.5 Frictionless Flow: 
The Bernoulli Equation
 
A classic linear momentum analysis is a relation between pressure, velocity, and eleva-
tion in a frictionless fl ow, now called the  Bernoulli equation . It was stated (vaguely) 
in words in 1738 in a textbook by Daniel Bernoulli. A complete derivation of the 
equation was given in 1755 by Leonhard Euler. The Bernoulli equation is very famous 
and very widely used, but one should be wary of its restrictions—all fl uids are viscous 
and thus all fl ows have friction to some extent. To use the Bernoulli equation correctly, 
one must confi ne it to regions of the fl ow that are nearly frictionless. This section (and, 
in more detail, Chap. 8) will address the proper use of the Bernoulli relation. 
    
Consider Fig.  3.12, which is an elemental fi xed streamtube control volume of 
variable area  A ( s ) and length  ds , where  s  is the streamline direction. The properties 
( ρ ,  V ,  p ) may vary with  s  and time but are assumed to be uniform over the cross 
section  A . The streamtube orientation  θ  is arbitrary, with an elevation change  dz  5 
 ds  sin  θ . Friction on the streamtube walls is shown and then neglected—a very

restrictive assumption. Note that the limit of a vanishingly small area means that 
the streamtube is equivalent to a  streamline  of the fl ow. Bernoulli’s equation is valid 
for both and is usually stated as holding “along a streamline” in frictionless fl ow.

 This relation does not require an assumption of frictionless fl ow.

 where  V s  5  V  itself because  s  is the streamline direction. If we neglect the shear force 
on the walls (frictionless fl ow), the forces are due to pressure and gravity. The streamwise 
gravity force is due to the weight component of the fl uid within the control volume: 
 dFs, grav 5 2dW sin θ 5 2γA ds sin θ 5 2γA dz 
 The pressure force is more easily visualized, in Fig.  3.12 b , by fi rst subtracting a 
uniform value  p  from all surfaces, remembering from Fig.  3.6 that the net force is 
not changed. The pressure along the slanted side of the streamtube has a streamwise 
component that acts not on  A  itself but on the outer ring of area increase  dA . The net 
pressure force is thus

To evaluate the two remaining integrals, one must estimate the unsteady effect  0 V / 0 t  
and the variation of density with pressure. At this time we consider only steady 
( 0 V / 0 t  5  0) incompressible (constant-density) fl ow, for which Eq. (3.53) becomes

 Bernoulli Interpreted as an 
Energy Relation
 
The Bernoulli relation, Eq. (3.54), is a classic  momentum  result, Newton’s law for a 
frictionless, incompressible fl uid. It may also be interpreted, however, as an idealized 
 energy  relation. The changes from 1 to 2 in Eq. (3.54) represent reversible pressure 
work, kinetic energy change, and potential energy change. The fact that the total 
remains the same means that there is no energy exchange due to viscous dissipation, 
heat transfer, or shaft work. Section 3.7 will add these effects by making a control 
volume analysis of the fi rst law of thermodynamics. 
 Restrictions on the 
Bernoulli Equation
 
The Bernoulli equation is a momentum-based force relation and was derived using 
the following restrictive assumptions: 
 1.  Steady fl ow: a common situation, application to most fl ows in this text. 
 2.  Incompressible fl ow: appropriate if the fl ow Mach number is less than 0.3. This 
restriction is removed in Chap. 9 by allowing for compressibility. 
 3.  Frictionless fl ow: restrictive—solid walls and mixing introduce friction effects. 
 4.  Flow along a single streamline: different streamlines may have different 
“Bernoulli constants”  w o  5  p/ ρ  1 V 2 /2  1  gz , but this is rare. In most cases, as 
we shall prove in Chap. 4, a frictionless fl ow region is  irrotational ; that is, 
curl( V)  5 0. For irrotational fl ow, the Bernoulli constant is the same 
everywhere. 
 The Bernoulli derivation does not account for possible energy exchange due to heat 
or work. These thermodynamic effects are accounted for in the steady fl ow energy 
equation. We are thus warned that the Bernoulli equation may be modifi ed by such 
an energy exchange. 
  
Figure 3.13 illustrates some practical limitations on the use of Bernoulli’s equation 
(3.54). For the wind tunnel model test of Fig. 3.13 a , the Bernoulli equation is valid in 
the core fl ow of the tunnel but not in the tunnel wall boundary layers, the model surface 
boundary layers, or the wake of the model, all of which are regions with high friction. 
  
In the propeller fl ow of Fig. 3.13 b , Bernoulli’s equation is valid both upstream and 
downstream, but with a different constant  w 0  5  p / ρ  1  V 2 /2  1  gz , caused by the work 
addition of the propeller. The Bernoulli relation (3.54) is not valid near the propeller 
blades or in the helical vortices (not shown, see Fig. 1.14) shed downstream of the 
blade edges. Also, the Bernoulli constants are higher in the fl owing “slipstream” than 
in the ambient atmosphere because of the slipstream kinetic energy. 

166 Chapter 3 Integral Relations for a Control Volume
  
For the chimney fl ow of Fig. 3.13 c , Eq. (3.54) is valid before and after the fi re, 
but with a change in Bernoulli constant that is caused by heat addition. The Bernoulli 
equation is not valid within the fi re itself or in the chimney wall boundary layers. 
 Jet Exit Pressure Equals 
Atmospheric Pressure
 
When a subsonic jet of liquid or gas exits from a duct into the free atmosphere, it 
immediately takes on the pressure of that atmosphere. This is a very important bound-
ary condition in solving Bernoulli problems, since the pressure at that point is known. 
The interior of the free jet will also be atmospheric, except for small effects due to 
surface tension and streamline curvature. 
 Stagnation, Static, and Dynamic 
Pressures
 
In many incompressible-fl ow Bernoulli analyses, elevation changes are negligible. Thus 
Eq. (3.54) reduces to a balance between pressure and kinetic energy. We can write this as 
 p1    1     1
2
 ρ V2
1    5     p2   1     1
2
 ρ V2
2    5     po    5      constant 
 The quantity  p o  is the pressure at any point in the frictionless fl ow where the velocity 
is zero. It is called the  stagnation pressure  and is the highest pressure possible in the 
fl ow, if elevation changes are neglected. The place where zero-velocity occurs is 
called a  stagnation point . For example, on a moving aircraft, the front nose and the 
wing leading edges are points of highest pressure. The pressures  p 1 and  p 2 are called 
 static  pressures, in the moving fl uid. The grouping (1/2) ρ V 2  has dimensions of pres-
sure and is called the  dynamic pressure. A popular device called a  Pitot-static tube 
(Fig. 6.30) measures ( p o  2  p ) and then calculates  V from the dynamic pressure.

3.5  Frictionless Flow: The Bernoulli Equation 167
  
Note, however, that one particular zero-velocity condition, no-slip fl ow along a 
fi xed wall, does  not  result in stagnation pressure. The no-slip condition is a  frictional 
effect, and the Bernoulli equation does not apply. 
 Hydraulic and Energy 
Grade Lines
 
A useful visual interpretation of Bernoulli’s equation is to sketch two grade lines of 
a fl ow. The  energy grade line  (EGL) shows the height of the total Bernoulli constant 
 h 0  5  z  1  p / γ  1  V 2 /(2 g ). In frictionless fl ow with no work or heat transfer [Eq. (3.54)] 
the EGL has constant height. The  hydraulic grade line  (HGL) shows the height cor-
responding to elevation and pressure head  z  1  p / γ —that is, the EGL minus the 
velocity head  V 2 /(2 g ). The HGL is the height to which liquid would rise in a piezom-
eter tube (see Prob. 2.11) attached to the fl ow. In an open-channel fl ow the HGL is 
identical to the free surface of the water. 
    
Figure 3.14 illustrates the EGL and HGL for frictionless fl ow at sections 1 and 2 
of a duct. The piezometer tubes measure the static pressure head  z  1  p / γ  and thus 
outline the HGL. The pitot stagnation-velocity tubes measure the total head  z  1  p / γ   1 
 V 2 /(2 g ), which corresponds to the EGL. In this particular case the EGL is constant, 
and the HGL rises due to a drop in velocity. 
  
In more general fl ow conditions, the EGL will drop slowly due to friction losses and 
will drop sharply due to a substantial loss (a valve or obstruction) or due to work extrac-
tion (to a turbine). The EGL can rise only if there is work addition (as from a pump or 
propeller). The HGL generally follows the behavior of the EGL with respect to losses 
or work transfer, and it rises and/or falls if the velocity decreases and/or increases. 
 
As mentioned before, no conversion factors are needed in computations with the 
 Bernoulli equation if consistent SI or BG units are used, as the following examples will show. 
  
In all Bernoulli-type problems in this text, we consistently take point 1 upstream 
and point 2 downstream.

 As mentioned, we always choose point 1 upstream and point 2 downstream. Try to choose

the tank free surface, where elevation and pressure are known, and point 2 as the nozzle exit, 
where again pressure and elevation are known. The two unknowns are  V 1 and  V 2 . 
 
Mass conservation is usually a vital part of Bernoulli analyses. If  A 1 is the tank cross 
section and  A 2  the nozzle area, this is approximately a one-dimensional fl ow with constant 
density, Eq. (3.30):

 Ans.  (4) 

3.5  Frictionless Flow: The Bernoulli Equation 169
 This formula, discovered by Evangelista Torricelli in 1644, states that the discharge veloc-
ity equals the speed that a frictionless particle would attain if it fell freely from point 1 to 
point 2. In other words, the potential energy of the surface fl uid is entirely converted to 
kinetic energy of effl ux, which is consistent with the neglect of friction and the fact that 
no net pressure work is done. Note that Eq. (4) is independent of the fl uid density, a char-
acteristic of gravity-driven fl ows. 
 
Except for the wall boundary layers, the streamlines from 1 to 2 all behave in the same 
way, and we can assume that the Bernoulli constant  h 0 is the same for all the core fl ow. 
However, the outlet fl ow is likely to be nonuniform, not one-dimensional, so that the aver-
age velocity is only approximately equal to Torricelli’s result. The engineer will then adjust 
the formula to include a dimensionless  discharge coeffi cient  c d : 
 
(V2)av 5 Q

 As discussed in Sec. 6.12, the discharge coeffi cient of a nozzle varies from about 0.6 to 1.0 
as a function of (dimensionless) fl ow conditions and nozzle shape. 
 Surface Velocity Condition for a 
Large Tank
 
Many Bernoulli, and also steady fl ow energy, problems involve liquid fl ow from a 
large tank or reservoir, as in Example 3.13. If the outfl ow is small compared to the 
volume of the tank, the surface of the tank hardly moves. Therefore these problems 
are analyzed assuming  zero velocity at the tank surface. The  pressure at the top of 
the tank or reservoir is assumed to be atmospheric. 
    
Before proceeding with more examples, we should note carefully that a solution 
by Bernoulli’s equation (3.54) does  not  require a second control volume analysis, only 
a selection of two points 1 and 2 along a given streamline. The control volume was 
used to derive the differential relation (3.52), but the integrated form (3.54) is valid 
all along the streamline for frictionless fl ow with no heat transfer or shaft work, and 
a control volume is not necessary. 
  
A classic Bernoulli application is the familiar process of siphoning a fl uid from 
one container to another. No pump is involved; a hydrostatic pressure difference 
provides the motive force. We analyze this in the following example. 
 EXAMPLE 3.14

 Note that the velocity is approximately zero at  z 1 , and a streamline goes from  z 1  to  z 2 . Note 
further that  p 1  and  p 2  are both atmospheric,  p  5 p atm , and therefore cancel. ( a ) Solve for the 
exit velocity from the tube:

 Ans.  ( a ) 
 The velocity exiting the siphon increases as the tube exit is lowered below the tank surface. 
There is no siphon effect if the exit is at or above the tank surface. Note that  z 3  and  z 4  do not 
directly enter the analysis. However,  z 3  should not be too high because the pressure there 
will be lower than atmospheric, and the liquid might vaporize. ( b ) For the given numerical

you may check that, for water (998 kg/m 3 ),  p 3 is 11,300 Pa  below atmospheric pressure. 
 
In Chap. 6 we will modify this example to include friction effects.

 A constriction in a pipe will cause the velocity to rise and the pressure to fall at section 2 
in the throat. The pressure difference is a measure of the fl ow rate through the pipe. The 
smoothly necked-down system shown in Fig. E3.15 is called a  venturi tube.  Find an expres-
sion for the mass fl ow in the tube as a function of the pressure change.

Notice from these examples that the solution of a typical problem involving 
 Bernoulli’s equation almost always leads to a consideration of the continuity equation 
as an equal partner in the analysis. The only exception is when the complete velocity 
distribution is already known from a previous or given analysis, but that means the 
continuity relation has already been used to obtain the given information. The point 
is that the continuity relation is always an important element in a fl ow analysis. 
 3.6 The Angular Momentum 
Theorem14
 
A control volume analysis can be applied to the angular momentum relation, Eq. (3.3), 
by letting our dummy variable  B  be the angular-momentum vector  H . However, since 
the system considered here is typically a group of nonrigid fl uid particles of variable 
velocity, the concept of mass moment of inertia is of no help, and we have to calculate 
 14 This section may be omitted without loss of continuity. 

3.6 The Angular Momentum Theorem 173
the instantaneous angular momentum by integration over the elemental masses  dm . If  O is 
the point about which moments are desired, the angular momentum about  O is given by 
 
 Ho 5 #
syst
 (r 3 V) dm 
 (3.55) 
 where  r  is the position vector from 0 to the elemental mass  dm  and  V  is the velocity 
of that element. The amount of angular momentum per unit mass is thus seen to be 
 β 5 dHo

momentum theorem (3.3), this must equal the sum of all the moments about point  O 
applied to the control volume 
 dHo
dt 5 a Mo 5 a (r 3 F)o 
 Note that the total moment equals the summation of moments of all applied forces 
about point  O . Recall, however, that this law, like Newton’s law (3.2), assumes that 
the particle velocity  V  is relative to an  ine r tial  coordinate system. If not, the moments 
about point  O  of the relative acceleration terms  a rel  in Eq. (3.49) must also be included: 
 
 a Mo 5 a (r 3 F)o 2 #
CV
 (r 3 arel) dm 
 (3.57) 
 wh ere the four terms constituting  a rel are given in Eq. (3.49). Thus the most general 
case of the angular momentum theorem is for a deformable control volume associated 
with a noninertial coordinate system. We combine Eqs. (3.56) and (3.57) to obtain

  Al though at this stage the angular momentum theorem can be considered a supple-
mentary topic, it has direct application to many important fl uid fl ow problems 

174 Chapter 3 Integral Relations for a Control Volume
involving torques or moments. A particularly important case is the analysis of rotating 
fl uid fl ow devices, usually called  turbomachines (Chap. 11). 
 EXAMPLE 3.17 
 As shown in Fig. E3.17 a , a pipe bend is supported at point  A and connected to a fl ow 
system by fl exible couplings at sections 1 and 2. The fl uid is incompressible, and ambient 
pressure  p a  is zero. ( a ) Find an expression for the torque  T  that must be resisted by the 
support at  A , in terms of the fl ow properties at sections 1 and 2 and the distances  h 1 and 
 h 2 . ( b )   Compute this torque if  D 1  5  D 2  5  3 in,  p 1  5  100 lbf/in 2  gage,  p 2  5  80 lbf/in 2 gage,

 Solution 
Part (a) 
   The control volume chosen in Fig. E3.17 b  cuts through sections 1 and 2 and through the sup-
port at  A , where the torque  T A  is desired. The fl exible couplings description specifi es that there 
is no torque at either section 1 or 2, and so the cuts there expose no moments. For the angular 
momentum terms  r  3  V ,  r  should be taken from point  A  to sections 1 and 2. Note that the 
gage pressure forces  p 1 A 1  and  p 2 A 2  both have moments about  A . Equation (3.59) with one-
dimensional fl ow terms becomes

pendent of the shape of the pipe bend and varies only with the properties at sections 1 and 
2 and the distances  h 1 and  h 2 . 15

 EXAMPLE 3.18 
 Figure 3.15 shows a schematic of a centrifugal pump. The fl uid enters axially and passes 
through the pump blades, which rotate at angular velocity  ω ; the velocity of the fl uid is 
changed from  V 1  to  V 2  and its pressure from  p 1  to  p 2 . ( a ) Find an expression for the torque 
 T o  that must be applied to these blades to maintain this fl ow. ( b ) The power supplied to the 
pump would be  P  5  ω T o . To illustrate numerically, suppose  r 1  5  0.2 m,  r 2  5  0.5 m, and

of 1000 kg/m 3 . Compute the torque and power supplied. 
 Solution 
 
Part (a) 
 The control volume is chosen to be the annular region between sections 1 and 2 where the fl ow 
passes through the pump blades (see Fig. 3.15). The fl ow is steady and assumed incompress-
ible. The contribution of pressure to the torque about axis  O  is zero since the pressure forces 
at 1 and 2 act radially through  O . Equation (3.59) becomes

 EXAMPLE 3.19 
 Figure 3.16 shows a lawn sprinkler arm viewed from above. The arm rotates about  O at 
constant angular velocity  ω . The volume fl ow entering the arm at  O  is  Q , and the fl uid is 
incompressible. There is a retarding torque at  O , due to bearing friction, of amount    2 T o k . 
Find an expression for the rotation  ω in terms of the arm and fl ow properties. 
 Solution 
 The entering velocity is  V 0 k , where  V 0  5  Q / A pipe . Equation (3.59) applies to the control vol-

 The result may surprise you: Even if the retarding torque  T o is negligible, the arm rotational

 3.7 The Energy Equation16
 
As our fourth and fi nal basic law, we apply the Reynolds transport theorem (3.12) to 
the fi rst law of thermodynamics, Eq. (3.5). The dummy variable  B  becomes energy 
 E , and the energy per unit mass is  β  5  dE / dm  5  e . Equation (3.5) can then be written 
for a fi xed control volume as follows: 17 
 
dQ
dt 2 dW
dt 5 dE
dt 5 d
dt a#
CV
eρ d 9 b 1 #
CS
 eρ(V ? n) dA 
 (3.61) 
 Recall that positive  Q  denotes heat added to the system and positive  W  denotes work 
done by the system. 
 
The system energy per unit mass  e may be of several types: 
 e 5 einternal 1 ekinetic 1 epotential 1 eother 
 where  e other  could encompass chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, and electrostatic 
or magnetic fi eld effects. We neglect  e other  here and consider only the fi rst three terms 
as discussed in Eq. (1.9), with  z defi ned as “up”: 
 
e 5 uˆ 1 1
2V2 1 gz 
 (3.62) 
   
The  heat and work terms could be examined in detail. If this were a heat transfer 
book,  dQ / dt  would be broken down into conduction, convection, and radiation effects 
and whole chapters written on each (see, for example, Ref. 3). Here we leave the term 
untouched and consider it only occasionally. 
  
Using for convenience the overdot to denote the time derivative, we divide the 
work term into three parts: 
 W
#
5 W
#
shaft 1 W
#
press 1 W
#
viscous stresses 5 W
#
s 1 W
#
p 1 W
#
υ 
 The work of gravitational forces has already been included as potential energy in Eq. 
(3.62). Other types of work, such as those due to electromagnetic forces, are excluded here. 
  
The shaft work isolates the portion of the work that is deliberately done by a 
machine (pump impeller, fan blade, piston, or the like) protruding through the control 
surface into the control volume. No further specifi cation other than  W
#
s  is desired at 
this point, but calculations of the work done by turbomachines will be performed in 
Chap. 11. 
 16 This section should be read for information and enrichment even if you lack formal background in 
thermodynamics. 
 17 The energy equation for a deformable control volume is rather complicated and is not discussed 
here. See Refs. 4 and 5 for further details. 

3.7 The Energy Equation 179
  
The rate of work  W
#
p  done by pressure forces occurs at the surface only; all work 
on internal portions of the material in the control volume is by equal and opposite 
forces and is self-canceling. The pressure work equals the pressure force on a small 
surface element  dA times the normal velocity component into the control volume: 
 dW
#
p 5 2( p dA)Vn, in 5 2p(2V ? n) dA 
 The total pressure work is the integral over the control surface: 
 
W
#
p 5#
CS
p(V ? n) dA 
 (3.63) 
 A cautionary remark: If part of the control surface is the surface of a machine part, we 
prefer to delegate that portion of the pressure to the  shaft work term W
#
s, not to W
#
p, 
which is primarily meant to isolate the fl uid fl ow pressure work terms. 
 
Finally, the shear work due to viscous stresses occurs at the control surface and 
consists of the product of each viscous stress (one normal and two tangential) and the 
respective velocity component: 
 dW
#
υ 5 2τ ? V dA 
 or 
W
#
υ 5 2#
CS
τ ? V dA 
 (3.64) 
 where  τ  is the stress vector on the elemental surface  dA . This term may vanish or be 
negligible according to the particular type of surface at that part of the control 
volume: 
 Solid surface. For all parts of the control surface that are solid confi ning walls, 
 V  5  0 from the viscous no-slip condition; hence  W
#
υ  5  zero identically. 
 Surface of a machine. Here the viscous work is contributed by the machine, and 
so we absorb this work in the term  W
#
s . 
 An inlet or outlet. At an inlet or outlet, the fl ow is approximately normal to the 
element  dA ; hence the only viscous work term comes from the normal stress 
 τ nn V n dA . Since viscous normal stresses are extremely small in all but rare 
cases, such as the interior of a shock wave, it is customary to neglect viscous 
work at inlets and outlets of the control volume. 
 Streamline surface. If the control surface is a streamline, such as the upper curve 
in the boundary layer analysis of Fig. 3.11, the viscous work term must be 
evaluated and retained if shear stresses are signifi cant along this line. In the 
particular case of Fig. 3.11, the streamline is outside the boundary layer, and 
viscous work is negligible. 
  
The net result of this discussion is that the rate-of-work term in Eq. (3.61) consists 
essentially of 
 
W

#
s 1#
CS
 p(V ? n) dA 2 #

 where the subscript  SS  stands for stream surface. When we introduce (3.65) and (3.62)

 •  C omments:  The heat transfer is positive, which means  into  the control volume. It is typical 
of gas fl ows that potential energy fl ow is negligible, enthalpy fl ow is dominant, and kinetic 
energy fl ow is small unless the velocities are very high (that is, high subsonic or supersonic). 
 The Steady Flow Energy Equation  
For steady fl ow with one inlet and one outlet, both assumed one-dimensional, 
Eq.    (3.67) reduces to a celebrated relation used in many engineering analyses. Let 
section 1 be the inlet and section 2 the outlet. Then

 But, from continuity,  m#

 w s   5  W
#
s /m#   5  dW s / dm  and  w υ  5  W
#
υ /m#   5  dW υ / dm . Equation (3.70) is a general form 
of the  steady fl ow energy equ a tion,  which states that the upstream  stagnation enthalpy 
 H1 5 (h 1 1
2V2 1 gz)1  differs from the downstream value  H 2  only if there is heat trans-
fer, shaft work, or viscous work as the fl uid passes between sections 1 and 2. Recall 
that  q  is positive if heat is added to the control volume and that  w s  and  w υ  are positive 
if work is done by the fl uid on the surroundings. 
  
Each term in Eq. (3.70) has the dimensions of energy per unit mass, or velocity 
squared, which is a form commonly used by mechanical engineers. If we divide through 
by  g , each term becomes a length, or head, which is a form preferred by civil engineers. 
The traditional symbol for head is  h , which we do not wish to confuse with enthalpy. 
Therefore we use internal energy in rewriting the head form of the energy relation: 
 
 p1
γ 1 uˆ1
g 1 V2

2g 1 z1 5 p2
γ 1 uˆ2
g 1 V2
2
2g 1 z2 2 hq 1 hs 1 hυ  
 (3.71) 
 where  h q  5  q / g ,  h s  5  w s / g , and  h υ  5  w v  / g  are the head forms of the heat added, shaft 
work done, and viscous work done, respectively. The term  p / γ  is called  pressure head, 
and the term  V 2 /2 g is denoted as  velocity head . 
 Friction and Shaft Work in 
Low-Speed Flow
 
A common application of the steady fl ow energy equation is for low-speed (incom-
pressible) fl ow through a pipe or duct. A pump or turbine may be included in the 
pipe system. The pipe and machine walls are solid, so the viscous work is zero. 
Equation (3.71) may be written as 
 
 ap1

2g 1 z1b 5 ap2
γ 1 V2
2
2g 1 z2b 1 uˆ2 2 uˆ1 2 q

 (3.72) 

3.7 The Energy Equation 183
 Every term in this equation is a length, or  head . The terms in parentheses are the upstream 
(1) and downstream (2) values of the useful or  available head  or  total head  of the fl ow, 
denoted by  h 0 . The last term on the right is the difference ( h 01  2  h 02 ), which can include 
pump head input, turbine head extraction, and the friction head loss  h f , always  positive . 
Thus, in incompressible fl ow with one inlet and one outlet, we may write

2g 1 zb

γ 1 V2
2g 1 zb
out
1 hfriction 2 hpump 1 hturbine  
 (3.73)
 Most of our internal fl ow problems will be solved with the aid of Eq. (3.73). The  h
terms are all positive; that is, friction loss is always positive in real (viscous) fl ows, 
a pump adds energy (increases the left-hand side), and a turbine extracts energy from 
the fl ow. If  h p  and/or  h t  are included, the pump and/or turbine must lie  between points 
1 and 2. In Chaps. 5 and 6 we shall develop methods of correlating  h f  losses with 
fl ow parameters in pipes, valves, fi ttings, and other internal fl ow devices. 
 EXAMPLE 3.21 
 Gasoline at 20 8 C is pumped through a smooth 12-cm-diameter pipe 10 km long, at a fl ow 
rate of 75 m 3 /h (330 gal/min). The inlet is fed by a pump at an absolute pressure of 24 atm. 
The exit is at standard atmospheric pressure and is 150 m higher. Estimate the frictional 
head loss  h f , and compare it to the velocity head of the fl ow  V 2 /(2 g ). (These numbers are 
quite realistic for liquid fl ow through long pipelines.) 
 Solution 
 •  P roperty values:  From Table A.3 for gasoline at 20 8 C,  ρ  5  680 kg/m 3 , or  γ  5
(680)(9.81)    5  6670 N/m 3 . 
 •  Assumptions: Steady fl ow. No shaft work, thus  h p  5  h t  5  0 .  If z 1  5  0, then  z 2  5  150 m. 
 •  Approach:  Find the velocity and the velocity head. These are needed for comparison. 
Then evaluate the friction loss from Eq. (3.73). 
 •  Solution steps:  Since the pipe diameter is constant, the average velocity is the same 
everywhere:

and note that the velocity heads cancel because of the constant-area pipe.

 The friction head is larger than the elevation change  D z , and the pump must drive the fl ow 
against both changes, hence the high inlet pressure. The ratio of friction to velocity head is

 •  C omments:  This high ratio is typical of long pipelines. (Note that we did not make direct 
use of the 10,000-m pipe length, whose effect is hidden within  h f .) In Chap. 6 we can state 
this problem in a more direct fashion: Given the fl ow rate, fl uid, and pipe size, what inlet pres-
sure is needed? Our correlations for  h f  will lead to the estimate  p inlet  <    24 atm, as stated here. 
 EXAMPLE 3.22 
 Air [ R  5  1716,  c p  5  6003 ft  ?  lbf/(slug  ?  8 R)] fl ows steadily, as shown in Fig. E3.22, through

 The negative sign indicates that this heat transfer is a  loss from the control volume. 
Kinetic Energy Correction Factor  
Often the fl ow entering or leaving a port is not strictly one-dimensional. In particular, 
the velocity may vary over the cross section, as in Fig. E3.4. In this case the kinetic 
energy term in Eq. (3.68) for a given port should be modifi ed by a dimensionless 
correction factor  α  so that the integral can be proportional to the square of the average 
velocity through the port:

 where

 If the density is also variable, the integration is very cumbersome; we shall not treat 
this complication. By letting  u  be the velocity normal to the port, the fi rst equation

 The term  α  is the kinetic energy correction factor, having a value of about 2.0 for 
fully developed laminar pipe fl ow and from 1.04 to 1.11 for turbulent pipe fl ow. The 
complete incompressible steady fl ow energy equation (3.73), including pumps, tur-
bines, and losses, would generalize to

 where the head terms on the right (h t , h p , h f ) are all numerically positive. All additive 
terms in Eq. (3.75) have dimensions of length { L }. In problems involving turbulent 
pipe fl ow, it is common to assume that  α  <    1.0. To compute numerical values, we 
can use these approximations to be discussed in Chap. 6:

 These values are only slightly different from unity and are often neglected in ele-
mentary turbulent fl ow analyses. However,  α  should never be neglected in laminar 
fl ow. 
 EXAMPLE 3.23 
 A hydroelectric power plant (Fig. E3.23) takes in 30 m 3 /s of water through its turbine and 
discharges it to the atmosphere at  V 2  5    2 m/s. The head loss in the turbine and penstock 
system is  h f  5    20 m. Assuming turbulent fl ow,  α  <    1.06, estimate the power in MW 
extracted by the turbine. 
 Solution 
 We neglect viscous work and heat transfer and take section 1 at the reservoir surface 
(Fig.    E3.23), where  V 1  <  0,  p 1  5  p atm , and  z 1  5    100 m. Section 2 is at the turbine 
outlet.

 The pressure terms cancel, and we may solve for the turbine head (which is positive): 
 ht 5 100 2 20 2 0.2 < 79.8 m 
 The turbine extracts about 79.8 percent of the 100-m head available from the dam. The total 
power extracted may be evaluated from the water mass fl ow:

 Ans. 
 The turbine drives an electric generator that probably has losses of about 15 percent, so the 
net power generated by this hydroelectric plant is about 20 MW.

 Summary
 
This chapter has analyzed the four basic equations of fl uid mechanics: conservation 
of (1) mass, (2) linear momentum, (3) angular momentum, and (4) energy. The equa-
tions were attacked “in the large”—that is, applied to whole regions of a fl ow. As 
such, the typical analysis will involve an approximation of the fl ow fi eld within the 
region, giving somewhat crude but always instructive quantitative results. However, 
the basic control volume relations are rigorous and correct and will give exact results 
if applied to the exact fl ow fi eld. 
  
There are two main points to a control volume analysis. The fi rst is the selection 
of a proper, clever, workable control volume. There is no substitute for experience, 
but the following guidelines apply. The control volume should cut through the place 
where the information or solution is desired. It should cut through places where 
maximum information is already known. If the momentum equation is to be used, it 
should  not  cut through solid walls unless absolutely necessary, since this will expose 
possible unknown stresses and forces and moments that make the   solution for the 
desired force diffi cult or impossible. Finally, every attempt should be made to place 
the control volume in a frame of reference where the fl ow   is steady or quasi-steady, 
since the steady formulation is much simpler to evaluate. 
  
The second main point to a control volume analysis is the reduction of the analy-
sis to a case that applies to the problem at hand. The 24 examples in this chapter give 
only an introduction to the search for appropriate simplifying assumptions. You will 
need to solve 24 or 124 more examples to become truly experienced in simplifying 
the problem just enough and no more. In the meantime, it would be wise for the 
beginner to adopt a very general form of the control volume conservation laws and 
then make a series of simplifi cations to achieve the fi nal analysis. Starting with the 
general form, one can ask a series of questions: 
 1. Is the control volume nondeforming or nonaccelerating? 
 2. Is the fl ow fi eld steady? Can we change to a steady fl ow frame? 
 3. Can friction be neglected? 
 4. Is the fl uid incompressible? If not, is the perfect-gas law applicable? 
 5. Are gravity or other body forces negligible? 
 6. Is there heat transfer, shaft work, or viscous work? 
 7. Are the inlet and outlet fl ows approximately one-dimensional? 
 8. Is atmospheric pressure important to the analysis? Is the pressure hydrostatic on 
any portions of the control surface? 
 9. Are there reservoir conditions that change so slowly that the velocity and time 
rates of change can be neglected? 
 In this way, by approving or rejecting a list of basic simplifi cations like these, one 
can avoid pulling Bernoulli’s equation off the shelf when it does not apply. 
 Problems 
 Most of the problems herein are fairly straightforward. More diffi -
cult or open-ended assignments are labeled with an asterisk. Prob-
lems labeled with a computer icon

 P3.25  As will be discussed in Chaps. 7 and 8, the fl ow of a stream 
 U 0  past a blunt fl at plate creates a broad low-velocity  wake 
behind the plate. A simple model is given in Fig. P3.25, with 
only half of the fl ow shown due to symmetry. The velocity 
profi le behind the plate is idealized as “dead air” (near-zero 
velocity) behind the plate, plus a higher velocity, decaying 
vertically above the wake according to the variation  u  <  
 U 0   1  D U e 2 z/ L , where  L  is the plate height and  z  5  0 is the

 P3.27  Consider a highly pressurized air tank at conditions ( p 0 ,  ρ 0 , 
 T 0 ) and volume  υ 0 . In Chap. 9 we will learn that, if the 
tank  is allowed to exhaust to the atmosphere through a 
well-designed converging nozzle of exit area  A , the outgo-
ing mass fl ow rate will be 
 
  m# 5 α p0 A
1RT0 where α < 0.685 for air 
 This rate persists as long as  p 0  is at least twice as large as 
the atmospheric pressure. Assuming constant  T 0  and an 
ideal gas, ( a ) derive a formula for the change of density 
 ρ 0 ( t ) within the tank. ( b ) Analyze the time  D t  required for 
the density to decrease by 25 percent. 
 P3.28  Air, assumed to be a perfect gas from Table A.4, fl ows 
through a long, 2-cm-diameter insulated tube. At section 1, 
the pressure is 1.1 MPa and the temperature is 345 K. At 
section 2, 67 meters further downstream, the density is 
1.34 kg/m 3 , the temperature 298 K, and the Mach number 
is 0.90. For one-dimensional fl ow, calculate ( a ) the mass 
fl ow; ( b )  p 2 ; (c)  V 2 ; and ( d  ) the change in entropy between 
1 and 2. ( e ) How do you explain the entropy change? 
 P3.29  In elementary compressible fl ow theory (Chap. 9), com-
pressed air will exhaust from a small hole in a tank at the 
mass fl ow rate  m#   <  C ρ , where  ρ  is the air density in the 
tank and  C  is a constant. If  ρ 0  is the initial density in a tank 
of volume  9 , derive a formula for the density change  ρ ( t ) 
after the hole is opened. Apply your formula to the follow-
ing case: a spherical tank of diameter 50 cm, with initial 
pressure 300 kPa and temperature 100 8 C, and a hole whose 
initial exhaust rate is 0.01 kg/s. Find   the time required for 
the tank density to drop by 50 percent. 
 P3.30  For the nozzle of Fig. P3.22, consider the following data 
for air,  k  5    1.4. At the throat,  p 1  5  1000 kPa,  V 1  5  491 m/s, 
and  T 1  5    600 K. At the exit,  p 2  5  28.14 kPa. Assuming 
isentropic steady fl ow, compute ( a ) the Mach number Ma 1 ; 
( b )  T 2 ; ( c ) the mass fl ow; and ( d )  V 2 . 
 P3.31  A bellows may be modeled as a deforming wedge-shaped

What are the best radii selections for these three points? 
 W3.3  Consider water fl owing by gravity through a short pipe 
connecting two reservoirs whose surface levels differ by an 
amount  D z . Why does the incompressible frictionless Ber-

through the pipe is computed? Does the paradox have 
something to do with the length of the short pipe? Does the 
paradox disappear if we round the entrance and exit edges 
of the pipe? 
 W3.4  Use the steady fl ow energy equation to analyze fl ow through

mechanism causes the fl ow to vary continuously from zero

 W3.5  Consider a long sewer pipe, half full of water, sloping

that the average velocity of such an open channel fl ow

  The differential equations to be studied in this chapter can be modeled numerically by compu-
tational fl uid dynamics (CFD). This study, from Ref. 21, models turbulent fl ow near a rotating 
cylinder at a Reynolds number Re D  <  8960. The grid (a) contains 3.1 million nodes, very fi nely 
spaced near the cylinder. The results (b) show turbulent velocity fl uctuations, obtained by direct 
numerical simulation (DNS), at  y + 5  10 away from the cylinder surface.

 Differential  Relations 
 for  Fluid  Flow 
 Motivation.  In analyzing fl uid motion, we might take one of two paths: (1) seeking 
an estimate of gross effects (mass fl ow, induced force, energy change) over a  fi nite 
region or control volume or (2) seeking the point-by-point details of a fl ow pattern 
by analyzing an  infi nitesimal  region of the fl ow. The former or gross-average view-
point was the subject of Chap. 3. 
  
This chapter treats the second in our trio of techniques for analyzing fl uid motion: 
small-scale, or  differential,  analysis. That is, we apply our four basic conservation 
laws to an infi nitesimally small control volume or, alternately, to an infi nitesimal fl uid 
system. In either case the results yield the basic  differential  equations  of fl uid motion. 
Appropriate  boundary  conditions are also developed. 
  
In their most basic form, these differential equations of motion are quite diffi cult 
to solve, and very little is known about their general mathematical properties. How-
ever, certain things can be done that have great educational value. First, as shown in 
Chap. 5, the equations (even if unsolved) reveal the basic dimensionless parameters 
that govern fl uid motion. Second, as shown in Chap. 6, a great number of useful 
solutions can be found if one makes two simplifying assumptions: (1) steady fl ow 
and (2) incompressible fl ow. A third and rather drastic simplifi cation, frictionless fl ow, 
makes our old friend the Bernoulli equation valid and yields a wide variety of ideal-
ized, or  pe r fect-fl uid,  possible solutions. These idealized fl ows are treated in Chap. 8, 
and we must be careful to ascertain whether such solutions are in fact realistic when 
compared with actual fl uid motion. Finally, even the diffi cult general differential equa-
tions now yield to the approximating technique known as computational fl uid dynam-
ics (CFD) whereby the derivatives are simulated by algebraic relations between a 
fi nite number of grid points in the fl ow fi eld, which are then solved on a computer. 
Reference 1 is an example of a textbook devoted entirely to numerical analysis of 
fl uid motion. 

222 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
4.1 The Acceleration Field 
of a Fluid
 
 In Sec. 1.7 we established the cartesian vector form of a velocity fi eld that varies in 
space and time: 
V(r, t) 5 iu(x, y, z, t) 1 jυ(x, y, z, t) 1 kw(x, y, z, t) 
 (1.4)
 This is the most important variable in fl uid mechanics: Knowledge of the velocity vector 
fi eld is nearly equivalent to  solving  a fl uid fl ow problem. Our coordinates are fi xed in space, 
and we observe the fl uid as it passes by—as if we had scribed a set of coordinate lines on 
a glass window in a wind tunnel. This is the  Eulerian  frame of reference, as opposed to 
the Lagrangian frame, which follows the moving position of individual particles. 
  
The Eulerian system can be visualized as a window through which we watch a 
fl ow. The coordinates ( x, y, z ) are fi xed, and the fl ow passes by. A fi xed instrument 
placed in the fl ow takes an Eulerian measurement. In contrast, Lagrangian coordinates 
follow the moving particles and are common in solid mechanics. Almost all articles and 
books about fl uid mechanics use the Eulerian system. Writers often use  tra f fi c as an 
example. A traffi c engineer will remain fi xed and will measure the fl ow of cars going 
by—an Eulerian viewpoint. Conversely, the police will follow specifi c cars as a  function 
of time—a Lagrangian viewpoint. 
  
To write Newton’s second law for an infi nitesimal fl uid system, we need to cal-
culate the acceleration vector fi eld  a  of the fl ow. Thus, we compute the total time 
derivative of the velocity vector: 
 a 5 dV
dt 5 i du
dt 1 j dυ
dt 1 k dw
dt  
 Since each scalar component ( u ,  υ ,  w ) is a function of the four variables ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ), 
we use the chain rule to obtain each scalar time derivative. For example, 
 du(x, y, z, t)
dt
5 0u
0t 1 0u
0x dx
dt 1 0u
0y dy
dt 1 0u
0z dz
dt 
 But, by definition,  dx/dt  is the local velocity component  u , and  dy/dt  5  υ , and 
dz/dt   5  w . The total time derivative of  u  may thus be written as follows, with exactly 
similar expressions for the time derivatives of  υ and  w : 
   ax 5 du
dt 5 0u
0t 1 u 0u
0x 1 υ 0u
0y 1 w 0u
0z 5 0u
0t 1 (V ? §)u
 
 ay 5 dυ
dt  5 0υ
0t 1 u 0υ
0x 1 υ 0υ
0y 1 w 0υ
0z 5 0υ
0t 1 (V ? §)υ
 
 (4.1)
   az 5 dw
dt 5 0w
0t  1 u 0w
0x  1 υ 0w
0y 1 w 0w
0z  5 0w
0t 1 (V ? §)w 
 Summing these into a vector, we obtain the total acceleration: 
a 5 dV
dt 5 0V
0t 1 au 0V
0x 1 υ 0V
0y 1 w 0V
0z b 5 0V
0t 1 (V ? =)V 
 (4.2)
 
Local 
Convective 
 The term  ≠ V / ≠ t  is called the  local acceleration,  which vanishes if the fl ow is steady—
that is, independent of time. The three terms in parentheses are called the  convective 

4.1  The Acceleration Field of a Fluid  223
acceleration,  which arises when the particle moves through regions of spatially vary-
ing velocity, as in a nozzle or diffuser. Flows that are nominally “steady” may have 
large accelerations due to the convective terms. 
 
Note our use of the compact dot product involving  V and the gradient operator  = : 
 u 0
0x 1 υ 0
0y 1 w 0
0z 5 V ? =  where  = 5 i 0
0x 1 j 0
0y 1 k 0
0z 
 The total time derivative—sometimes called the  substantial  or  material derivative—
concept may be applied to any variable, such as the pressure: 
 
dp
dt 5 0p
0t 1 u 0p
0x 1 υ 0p
0y 1 w 0p
0z 5 0p
0t 1 (V ? =)p 
 (4.3) 
 Wherever convective effects occur in the basic laws involving mass, momentum, or 
energy, the basic differential equations become nonlinear and are usually more com-
plicated than fl ows that do not involve convective changes. 
  
We emphasize that this total time derivative follows a particle of fi xed identity, 
making it convenient for expressing laws of particle mechanics in the eulerian fl uid 
fi eld description. The operator  d / dt  is sometimes assigned a special symbol such as 
 D / Dt as a further reminder that it contains four terms and follows a fi xed particle. 
  
As another reminder of the special nature of  d / dt , some writers give it the name 
 substantial  or  mat e rial derivative .

 •  Approach:  Carry out all the required derivatives with respect to ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ), substitute 
into the total acceleration vector, Eq. (4.2), and collect terms. 
 •  Solution step 1: First work out the local acceleration  ≠ V / ≠ t :

 •  Solution step 3:  Combine all four terms above into the single “total” or “substantial” 
derivative:

0x 1 υ 0V
0y 1 w 0V

 5 3i 1 (3tz 1 txy2)j 1 (y2 1 2txyz)k 
 Ans. 
 •  Comments:  Assuming that  V  is valid everywhere as given, this total acceleration vector 
 d V / dt applies to all positions and times within the fl ow fi eld. 
 4.2 The Differential Equation 
of Mass Conservation
 
Conservation of mass, often called the  continuity  relation, states that the fl uid mass 
cannot change. We apply this concept to a very small region. All the basic differential 
equations can be derived by considering either an elemental control volume or an 
elemental system. We choose an infi nitesimal fi xed control volume ( dx ,  dy ,  dz ), as in 
Fig. 4.1, and use our basic control volume relations from Chap. 3. The fl ow through 
each side of the element is approximately one-dimensional, and so the appropriate 
mass conservation relation to use here is 
 
#
CV
0ρ
0t  d 9 1 a
i
(ρi Ai Vi )out 2 a
i
(ρi AiVi)in 5 0 
 (3.22) 
 The element is so small that the volume integral simply reduces to a differential term: 
 #
CV
 0ρ
0t  d 9 < 0ρ
0t  dx dy dz 
 The mass fl ow terms occur on all six faces, three inlets and three outlets. We make use 
of the fi eld or continuum concept from Chap. 1, where all fl uid properties are considered 
to be uniformly varying functions of time and position, such as  ρ  5  ρ ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ). Thus, 
if  T  is the temperature on the left face of the element in Fig. 4.1, the right face will 
have a slightly different temperature T 1 (0T/0x) dx. For mass conservation, if  ρ u is 
known on the left face, the value of this product on the right face is ρu 1 (0ρu/0x) dx.

4.2  The Differential Equation of Mass Conservation  225
  
Figure 4.1 shows only the mass fl ows on the  x  or left and right faces. The fl ows 
on the  y  (bottom and top) and the  z  (back and front) faces have been omitted to avoid 
cluttering up the drawing. We can list all these six fl ows as follows: 
Face
Inlet mass fl ow
Outlet mass fl ow
x
ρu dy dz
cρu 1 0
0x (ρu) dx ddy dz
y
ρυ dx dz
cρυ 1 0
0y(ρυ) dy d dx dz
z
ρw dx dy
cρw 1 0
0z (ρw) dz d dx dy
 Introduce these terms into Eq. (3.22) and we have 
 0ρ
0t  dx dy dz 1 0
0x (ρu) dx dy dz 1 0
0y (ρυ) dx dy dz 1 0
0z (ρw) dx dy dz 5 0 
 The element volume cancels out of all terms, leaving a partial differential equation 
involving the derivatives of density and velocity: 
 
0ρ
0t 1 0
0x (ρu) 1 0
0y (ρυ) 1 0
0z (ρw) 5 0 
 (4.4) 
 This is the desired result: conservation of mass for an infi nitesimal control volume. 
It is often called the  equation of continuity because it requires no assumptions except 
that the density and velocity are continuum functions. That is, the fl ow may be either 
steady or unsteady, viscous or frictionless, compressible or incompressible. 1 However, 
the equation does not allow for any source or sink singularities within the element. 
 
The vector gradient operator 
 = 5 i 0
0x 1 j 0
0y 1 k 0
0z 
 enables us to rewrite the equation of continuity in a compact form, not that it helps 
much in fi nding a solution. The last three terms of Eq. (4.4) are equivalent to the 
divergence of the vector  ρ V 
 
0
0x (ρu) 1  0
0y (ρυ) 1  0
0z (ρw) ; = ? ( ρV) 
 (4.5) 
 so the compact form of the continuity relation is 
 
0ρ
0t 1 = ? (ρV) 5 0 
 (4.6) 
 In this vector form the equation is still quite general and can readily be converted to 
other coordinate systems. 
1One case where Eq. (4.4) might need special care is two-phase fl ow, where the density is 
 discontinuous between the phases. For further details on this case, see Ref. 2, for example.

226 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 Cylindrical Polar Coordinates
 
The most common alternative to the cartesian system is the  cylindrical polar coordi-
nate system, sketched in Fig. 4.2. An arbitrary point  P  is defi ned by a distance  z along 
the axis, a radial distance  r from the axis, and a rotation angle  θ about the axis. The 
three independent orthogonal velocity components are an axial velocity  υ z , a radial 
velocity  υ r , and a circumferential velocity  υ θ , which is positive counterclockwise—
that is, in the direction of increasing  θ . In general, all components, as well as pressure 
and density and other fl uid properties, are continuous functions of  r ,  θ ,  z , and  t . 
  
The divergence of any vector function  A ( r ,  θ ,  z ,  t ) is found by making the trans-
formation of coordinates 
 
r 5 (x2 1 y2)1/2    θ 5 tan21 y
x    z 5 z 
 (4.7) 
 and the result is given here without proof 2 
 
= ? A 5 1
r 0
0r (rAr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (Aθ) 1 0
0z (Az) 
 (4.8) 
 The general continuity equation (4.6) in cylindrical polar coordinates is thus 
 
0ρ
0t 1 1
r 0
0r (rρυr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (ρυθ) 1 0
0z (ρυz) 5 0 
 (4.9) 
 There are other orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems, notably  spherical polar 
coordinates, which occasionally merit use in a fl uid mechanics problem. We shall not 
treat these systems here except in Prob. P4.12. 
  
There are also other ways to derive the basic continuity equation (4.6) that are 
interesting and instructive. One example is the use of the divergence theorem. Ask 
your instructor about these alternative approaches.

4.2  The Differential Equation of Mass Conservation  227
Steady Compressible Flow
 
 If the fl ow is steady,  ≠ / ≠ t  ;  0 and all properties are functions of position only. Equa-
tion (4.6) reduces to 
 Cartesian: 
0
0x (ρu) 1 0
0y (ρυ) 1 0
0z (ρw) 5 0 
 Cylindrical: 
1
r 0
0r (rρυr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (ρυθ) 1 0
0z (ρυz) 5 0 
 (4.10) 
 Since density and velocity are both variables, these are still nonlinear and rather 
formidable, but a number of special-case solutions have been found. 
Incompressible Flow
 
 A special case that affords great simplifi cation is incompressible fl ow, where the 
density changes are negligible. Then  ≠ ρ / ≠ t  <  0 regardless of whether the fl ow is 
steady or unsteady, and the density can be slipped out of the divergence in Eq. (4.6) 
and divided out. The result 
 
 § ? V 5 0 
 (4.11) 
 is valid for steady or unsteady incompressible fl ow. The two coordinate forms are 
 Cartesian: 
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 1 0w
0z  5  0 
 (4.12 a ) 
 Cylindrical: 
1
r 0
0r (rυr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (υθ) 1 0
0z (υz) 5 0 
 (4.12 b ) 
 These are  linear  differential equations, and a wide variety of solutions are known, as 
discussed in Chaps. 6 to 8. Since no author or instructor can resist a wide variety of 
solutions, it follows that a great deal of time is spent studying incompressible fl ows. 
Fortunately, this is exactly what should be done, because most practical engineering 
fl ows are approximately incompressible, the chief exception being the high-speed gas 
fl ows treated in Chap. 9. 
  
When is a given fl ow approximately incompressible? We can derive a nice criterion 
by using some density approximations. In essence, we wish to slip the density out of 
the divergence in Eq. (4.6) and approximate a typical term such as 
 
 0
0x (ρu) < ρ 0u
0x 
 (4.13) 
 This is equivalent to the strong inequality 
 ` u 0ρ
0x ` ! ` ρ 0u
0x `  
 or 
`  δρ
ρ  ` ! `  δV
V `  
 (4.14) 
 As shown in Eq. (1.38), the pressure change is approximately proportional to the 
density change and the square of the speed of sound  a of the fl uid: 
 
 δp < a2 δρ 
 (4.15) 

228 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 Meanwhile, if elevation changes are negligible, the pressure is related to the velocity 
change by Bernoulli’s equation (3.52): 
 
 δp < 2ρV δV 
 (4.16) 
 Combining Eqs. (4.14) to (4.16), we obtain an explicit criterion for incompressible fl ow: 
 
V2
a2 5 Ma2 ! 1 
 (4.17) 
 where Ma   5  V / a  is the dimensionless  Mach number  of the fl ow. How small is small? 
The commonly accepted limit is 
 
Ma # 0.3 
 (4.18) 
 For air at standard conditions, a fl ow can thus be considered incompressible if the 
velocity is less than about 100 m/s (330 ft/s). This encompasses a wide variety of 
airfl ows: automobile and train motions, light aircraft, landing and takeoff of high-
speed aircraft, most pipe fl ows, and turbomachinery at moderate rotational speeds. 
Further, it is clear that almost all liquid fl ows are incompressible, since fl ow velocities 
are small and the speed of sound is very large. 3 
  
Before attempting to analyze the continuity equation, we shall proceed with the 
derivation of the momentum and energy equations, so that we can analyze them as a 
group. A very clever device called the  stream  function  can often make short work of 
the continuity equation, but we shall save it until Sec. 4.7. 
  
One further remark is appropriate: The continuity equation is always important and 
must always be satisfi ed for a rational analysis of a fl ow pattern. Any newly discov-
ered momentum or energy “solution” will ultimately fail when subjected to critical 
analysis if it does not also satisfy the continuity equation. 
 EXAMPLE  4.2 
 Under what conditions does the velocity fi eld 
 
V 5 (a1x 1 b1y 1 c1z)i 1 (a2x 1 b2y 1 c2z)j 1 (a3x 1 b3y 1 c3z)k 
 where  a 1 ,  b 1 , etc.  5  const, represent an incompressible fl ow that conserves mass? 
 Solution 
 Recalling that  V  5  u i  1  υ j  1  w k , we see that  u  5  ( a 1 x  1  b 1 y  1  c 1 z ), etc. Substituting 
into Eq. (4.12 a ) for incompressible continuity, we obtain 
 0
0x (a1x 1 b1y 1 c1z) 1 0
0y (a2x 1 b2y 1 c2z) 1 0
0z (a3x 1 b3y 1 c3z) 5 0 
 or 
a1 1 b2 1 c3 5 0 
 Ans. 
 At least two of constants  a 1 ,  b 2 , and  c 3  must have opposite signs. Continuity imposes no 
restrictions whatever on constants  b 1 ,  c 1 ,  a 2 ,  c 2 ,  a 3 , and  b 3 , which do not contribute to a 
volume increase or decrease of a differential element. 
3An exception occurs in geophysical fl ows, where a density change is imposed thermally or mechan-
ically rather than by the fl ow conditions themselves. An example is fresh water layered upon saltwater 
or warm air layered upon cold air in the atmosphere. We say that the fl uid is stratifi ed, and we must 
account for vertical density changes in Eq. (4.6) even if the velocities are small.

4.2  The Differential Equation of Mass Conservation  229
 EXAMPLE  4.3 
 An incompressible velocity fi eld is given by 
 
 u 5 a(x2 2 y2)    υ unknown    w 5 b 
 where  a and  b are constants. What must the form of the velocity component  υ be? 
 Solution 
 Again Eq. (4.12 a ) applies: 
 0
0x (ax2 2 ay2) 1 0υ
0y 1 0b
0z 5 0 
 or 
0υ
0y 5 22ax 
 (1) 
 This is easily integrated partially with respect to  y : 
 
υ (x, y, z, t) 5 22axy 1 f (x, z, t) 
 Ans. 
 This is the only possible form for  υ  that satisfi es the incompressible continuity equation. 
The function of integration  f  is entirely arbitrary since it vanishes when  υ  is differentiated 
with respect to  y . 4 
 EXAMPLE  4.4 
 A centrifugal impeller of 40-cm diameter is used to pump hydrogen at 15 8 C and 1-atm 
pressure. Estimate the maximum allowable impeller rotational speed to avoid compress-
ibility effects at the blade tips. 
 Solution 
 •  Assumptions:  The maximum fl uid velocity is approximately equal to the impeller tip speed: 
 Vmax < Vrmax    where rmax 5 D/2 5 0.20 m 
 •  Approach:  Find the speed of sound of hydrogen and make sure that  V max  is much less. 
 •  Property values:  From Table A.4 for hydrogen,  R  5  4124 m 2 /(s 2  2  K) and  k  5  1.41. 
From Eq. (1.39) at 15 8 C  5  288K, compute the speed of sound: 
 aH2 5 2kRT 5 21.4134124 m2/(s2 2 K) 4(288 K) < 1294 m/s 
 •  Final solution step:  Use our rule of thumb, Eq. (4.18), to estimate the maximum impel-
ler speed: 
 V 5 Vrmax # 0.3a    or    V(0.2 m) # 0.3(1294 m/s) 
 
Solve for     V # 1940 rad
s < 18,500 rev
min 
 Ans. 
•  Comments:  This is a high rate because the speed of sound of hydrogen, a light gas, is 
nearly four times greater than that of air. An impeller moving at this speed in air would 
create tip shock waves. 
4This is a very realistic fl ow that simulates the turning of an inviscid fl uid through a 608 angle; see 
Examples 4.7 and 4.9.

 4.3 The Differential Equation of 
Linear Momentum
 
This section uses an elemental volume to derive Newton’s law for a moving fl uid. 
An alternate approach, which the reader might pursue, would be a force balance on 
an elemental moving particle. Having done it once in Sec. 4.2 for mass conservation, 
we can move along a little faster this time. We use the same elemental control volume 
as in Fig. 4.1, for which the appropriate form of the linear momentum relation is

The momentum fl uxes occur on all six faces, three inlets and three outlets. Refer-
ring again to Fig. 4.1, we can form a table of momentum fl uxes by exact analogy 
with the discussion that led up to the equation for net mass fl ux: 
 Faces 
Inlet  momentum  fl ux 
Outlet  momentum  fl ux

 ρ u V dy dz 
cρuV 1 0
0x(ρuV) dx d dy dz 
   y 
 ρ υ V dx dz 
cρυV 1 0
0y(ρυV) dy d dx dz 
   z 
 ρ w V dx dy 
cρwV 1 0
0z(ρwV) dz d dx dy 
 Introduce these terms and Eq. (4.19) into Eq. (3.40), and get this intermediate result: 
 
a F 5 dx dy dz c 0
0t(ρV) 1 0
0x (ρuV) 1 0
0y (ρυV) 1 0
0z (ρwV) d  
 (4.20) 
 Note that this is a vector relation. A simplifi cation occurs if we split up the term in 
brackets as follows: 
 0
0t (ρV) 1 0
0x (ρuV) 1 0
0y (ρυV) 1 0
0z (ρwV)

0t 1 u 0V
0x 1 υ 0V
0y 1 w 0V
0z b 
 (4.21) 
 The term in brackets on the right-hand side is seen to be the equation of continuity, 
Eq. (4.6), which vanishes identically. The long term in parentheses on the right-hand 
side is seen from Eq. (4.2) to be the total acceleration of a particle that instantaneously 
occupies the control volume: 
 
0V
0t 1 u 0V
0x 1 υ 0V
0y 1 w 0V
0z 5 dV

 (4.2) 
 Thus, we have now reduced Eq. (4.20) to 
 
a F 5 ρ dV

 (4.22) 

4.3  The Differential Equation of Linear Momentum 231
 It might be good for you to stop and rest now and think about what we have just 
done. What is the relation between Eqs. (4.22) and (3.40) for an infi nitesimal control 
volume? Could we have  begun the analysis at Eq. (4.22)? 
  
Equation (4.22) points out that the net force on the control volume must be of 
differential size and proportional to the element volume. These forces are of two types, 
 body forces and  surface forces. Body forces are due to external fi elds (gravity, mag-
netism, electric potential) that act on the entire mass within the element. The only 
body force we shall consider in this book is gravity. The gravity force on the dif-
ferential mass  ρ  dx  dy  dz within the control volume is 
 
dFgrav 5 ρg dx dy dz 
 (4.23) 
 where  g  may in general have an arbitrary orientation with respect to the coordinate sys-
tem. In many applications, such as Bernoulli’s equation, we take  z  “up,” and  g  5  2 g k . 
  
The surface forces are due to the stresses on the sides of the control surface. These 
stresses are the sum of hydrostatic pressure plus viscous stresses  τ ij  that arise from 
motion with velocity gradients: 
 
σij 5 †
2p 1 τxx
τyx
τzx
τxy
2p 1 τyy
τzy
τxz
τyz
2p 1 τzz
†  
 (4.24) 
 The subscript notation for stresses is given in Fig. 4.3. Unlike velocity  V , which is 
a three-component  ve c tor,  stresses  σ ij  and  τ ij  and strain rates  ´ ij  are nine-component 
 tensors  and require two subscripts to defi ne each component. For further study of  tensor 
analysis, see Refs. 6, 11, or 13. 
 
It is not these stresses but their  gradients, or differences, that cause a net force on 
the differential control surface. This is seen by referring to Fig. 4.4, which shows only 
y

232 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
the  x -directed stresses to avoid cluttering up the drawing. For example, the leftward 
force  σ xx  dy  dz  on the left face is balanced by the rightward force  σ xx  dy  dz  on the 
right face, leaving only the net rightward force (0σxx/0x)  dx  dy  dz  on the right face. 
The same thing happens on the other four faces, so the net surface force in the  x  direction 
is given by 
 
dFx,surf 5 c 0
0x (σxx) 1 0
0y (σyx) 1 0
0z (σzx) d  dx dy dz 
 (4.25) 
 We see that this force is proportional to the element volume. Notice that the stress 
terms are taken from the  top row  of the array in Eq. (4.24). Splitting this row into 
pressure plus viscous stresses, we can rewrite Eq. (4.25) as 
 
dFx
d 9 5 20p
0x 1 0
0x (τxx) 1 0
0y (τyx) 1 0
0z (τzx) 
 (4.26) 
 where  d 9  5  dx dy dz.  In an exactly similar manner, we can derive the  y  and  z forces 
per unit volume on the control surface: 
 
dFy
d 9 5 20p
0y 1 0
0x (τxy) 1 0
0y (τyy) 1 0
0z (τzy)

0z 1 0
0x (τxz) 1 0
0y (τyz) 1 0
0z (τzz)  
 (4.27) 
 Now we multiply Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) by  i ,  j , and  k , respectively, and add to obtain 
an expression for the net vector surface force:

 Since each term in parentheses in Eq. (4.29) represents the divergence of a stress

expressed in divergence form:

 is the viscous stress tensor acting on the element. The surface force is thus the sum 
of the  pressure gradient  vector and the divergence of the viscous stress tensor. 
 Substituting into Eq. (4.22) and utilizing Eq. (4.23), we have the basic differential 
momentum equation for an infi nitesimal element: 
 
ρg 2 =p 1 = ? τij 5 ρ dV

 where

 We can also express Eq. (4.32) in words: 
 Gravity force per unit volume 1 pressure force per unit volume
 
1 viscous force per unit volume 5 density 3 acceleration 
 (4.34) 
 Equation (4.32) is so brief and compact that its inherent complexity is almost  invisible. 
It is a  vector  equation, each of whose component equations contains nine terms. Let 
us therefore write out the component equations in full to illustrate the mathematical 
diffi culties inherent in the momentum equation:

234 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 This is the differential momentum equation in its full glory, and it is valid for any 
fl uid in any general motion, particular fl uids being characterized by particular viscous 
stress terms. Note that the last three “convective” terms on the right-hand side of each 
component equation in (4.35) are nonlinear, which complicates the general mathematical 
analysis. 
Inviscid Flow: Euler’s Equation
 
 Equation (4.35) is not ready to use until we write the viscous stresses in terms of 
velocity components. The simplest assumption is frictionless fl ow  τ ij  5  0, for which 
Eq. (4.32) reduces to 
 
ρg 2 =p 5 ρ d V
dt  
 (4.36) 
 This is  Euler’s equation  for inviscid fl ow. We show in Sec. 4.9 that Euler’s equation 
can be integrated along a streamline to yield the frictionless Bernoulli equation, (3.52) 
or (3.54). The complete analysis of inviscid fl ow fi elds, using continuity and the 
Bernoulli relation, is given in Chap. 8. 
Newtonian Fluid: Navier-Stokes 
Equations
 
 For a newtonian fl uid, as discussed in Sec. 1.9, the viscous stresses are proportional 
to the element strain rates and the coeffi cient of viscosity. For incompressible fl ow, 
the generalization of Eq. (1.23) to three-dimensional viscous fl ow is 5 
 τxx 5 2μ 0u
0x   τyy 5 2μ 0υ
0y    τzz 5 2μ 0w
0z  
 
τxy 5 τyx 5 μ a 0u

0x 1 0u
0z b 
 (4.37) 
 τyz 5 τzy 5 μ a 0υ
0z 1 0w
0y b  
 where  μ  is the viscosity coeffi cient. Substitution into Eq. (4.35) gives the differential 
momentum equation for a newtonian fl uid with constant density and viscosity: 
  ρgx 2 0p
0x 1 μ a 02u
0x2 1 02u
0y2 1 02u
0z2 b 5 ρ du

 These are the incompressible fl ow  Navier-Stokes equations,  named after C. L. M. H. 
Navier (1785–1836) and Sir George G. Stokes (1819–1903), who are credited with 
 5 When compressibility is signifi cant, additional small terms arise containing the element volume 
expansion rate and a  second coeffi cient of viscosity; see Refs. 4 and 5 for details.

4.3  The Differential Equation of Linear Momentum 235
their derivation. They are second-order nonlinear partial differential equations and are 
quite formidable, but solutions have been found to a variety of interesting viscous 
fl ow problems, some of which are discussed in Sec. 4.11 and in Chap. 6 (see also 
Refs. 4 and 5). For compressible fl ow, see Eq. (2.29) of Ref. 5. 
  
Equations (4.38) have four unknowns:  p ,  u ,  υ , and  w . They should be combined 
with the incompressible continuity relation [Eqs. (4.12)] to form four equations in 
these four unknowns. We shall discuss this again in Sec. 4.6, which presents the 
appropriate boundary conditions for these equations. 
  
Even though the Navier-Stokes equations have only a limited number of known 
analytical solutions, they are amenable to fi ne-gridded computer modeling [1]. The 
fi eld of CFD is maturing fast, with many commercial software tools available. It is 
possible now to achieve approximate, but realistic, CFD results for a wide variety of 
complex two- and three-dimensional viscous fl ows. 
 EXAMPLE  4.5 
 Take the velocity fi eld of Example 4.3, with  b  5  0 for algebraic convenience 
 
u 5 a(x2 2 y2)    υ 5 22axy    w 5 0 
 and determine under what conditions it is a solution to the Navier-Stokes momentum equa-
tions (4.38). Assuming that these conditions are met, determine the resulting pressure 
 distribution when  z is “up” ( g x  5  0,  g y  5  0,  g z  5  2 g ). 
 Solution 
 •  Assumptions:  Constant density and viscosity, steady fl ow ( u  and  υ  independent of time). 
 •  Approach: Substitute the known ( u ,  υ ,  w ) into Eqs. (4.38) and solve for the pressure 
gradients. If a unique pressure function  p ( x ,  y ,  z ) can then be found, the given solution 
is exact. 
 •  Solution step 1: Substitute ( u ,  υ ,  w ) into Eqs. (4.38) in sequence: 
 ρ(0) 2 0p
0x 1 μ(2a 2 2a 1 0) 5 ρ au 0u
0x 1 υ 0u
0yb 5 2a2ρ (x3 1 xy2)

0y 1 μ(0 1 0 1 0) 5 ρ au 0υ
0x 1 υ 0υ
0y b 5 2a2ρ(x2y 1 y3)
 
 ρ(2g) 2 0p
0z 1 μ(0 1 0 1 0) 5 ρ au 0w
0x 1 υ 0w
0y b 5 0
 
 Rearrange and solve for the three pressure gradients: 
 
0p
0x 5 22a2ρ(x3 1 xy2)   0p
0y 5 22a2ρ(x2y 1 y3)    0p
0z 5 2ρg 
 (1) 
 •  Comment 1:  The vertical pressure gradient is  hydrostatic . [Could you have predicted this 
by noting in Eqs. (4.38) that  w  5    0?] However, the pressure is velocity-dependent in the 
 xy plane. 

236 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 •  Solution step 2:  To determine if the  x  and  y  gradients of pressure in Eq. (1) are 
 compatible, evaluate the mixed derivative ( ≠ 2 p / ≠ x  ≠ y ); that is, cross-differentiate these 
two equations: 
 0
0y a0p
0xb 5 0
0y 322a2ρ(x3 1 xy2) 4 5 24a2ρxy 
 0
0x a0p
0yb 5 0
0x 322a2ρ(x2y 1 y3) 4 5 24a2ρxy 
 •  Comment 2:  Since these are equal, the given velocity distribution is indeed an  exact 
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. 
 •  Solution step 3: To fi nd the pressure, integrate Eqs. (1), collect, and compare. Start with 
 ≠ p / ≠ x . The procedure requires care! Integrate  partially  with respect to  x , holding  y  and  z 
constant: 
 
p 5 #
0p
0x dx ƒ y,z 5 #22a2ρ(x3 1 xy2) dx ƒ y,z 5 22a2ρ ax4
4 1 x2y2
2 b 1 f1(y, z) 
 (2) 
 Note that the “constant” of integration  f 1  is a  function  of the variables that were not  integrated. 
Now differentiate Eq. (2) with respect to  y and compare with  ≠ p / ≠ y from Eq. (1): 
 0p
0y ƒ (2) 5 22a2ρ x2y 1 0f1
0y 5 0p
0y ƒ (1) 5 22a2ρ(x2y 1 y3) 
 Compare: 0f1
0y 5 22a2ρ y3  or  f1 5 #
0f1
0y dy ƒ z 5 22a2ρ y4
4 1 f2(z) 
  
Collect terms: So far   p 5 22a2ρ ax4
4 1 x2y2
2
1 y4
4 b 1 f2(z) 
 (3) 
 This time the “constant” of integration  f 2  is a function of  z  only (the variable not integrated). 
Now differentiate Eq. (3) with respect to  z and compare with  ≠ p / ≠ z from Eq. (1): 
 
0p
0z ƒ (3) 5 df2
dz 5 0p
0z ƒ (1) 5 2ρg    or    f2 5 2ρgz 1 C 
 (4) 
 where  C  is a constant. This completes our three integrations. Combine Eqs. (3) and (4) to 
obtain the full expression for the pressure distribution in this fl ow: 
 
p(x, y, z) 5 2ρgz 2 1
2 a2ρ(x4 1 y4 1 2x2y2) 1 C 
 Ans.  (5) 
 This is the desired solution. Do you recognize it? Not unless you go back to the beginning 
and square the velocity components: 
 
u2 1 υ2 1 w2 5 V2 5 a2(x4 1 y4 1 2x2y2) 
 (6) 
 
Comparing with Eq. (5), we can rewrite the pressure distribution as 
 
p 1 1
2 ρV2 1 pgz 5 C 
 (7) 
 •  Comment:  This is Bernoulli’s equation (3.54). That is no accident, because the velocity 
distribution given in this problem is one of a family of fl ows that are solutions to the 
Navier-Stokes equations and that satisfy Bernoulli’s incompressible equation everywhere 
in the fl ow fi eld. They are called  irrotational fl ows,  for which curl  V  5  =  3  V  ;  0. This 
subject is discussed again in Sec. 4.9. 

4.4  The Differential Equation of Angular Momentum 237
4.4 The Differential Equation of 
Angular Momentum
 
 Having now been through the same approach for both mass and linear momentum, 
we can go rapidly through a derivation of the differential angular momentum relation. 
The appropriate form of the integral angular momentum equation for a fi xed control 
volume is 
 
a Mo 5 0
0t c #
CV
(r 3 V)ρ d 9 d 1 #
CS
(r 3 V)ρ(V ? n) dA 
 (3.59) 
 We shall confi ne ourselves to an axis through  O  that is parallel to the  z  axis and 
passes through the centroid of the elemental control volume. This is shown in Fig. 4.5. 
Let  θ  be the angle of rotation about  O  of the fl uid within the control volume. The 
only stresses that have moments about  O  are the shear stresses  τ xy  and  τ yx . We can 
evaluate the moments about  O  and the angular momentum terms about  O . A lot of 
algebra is involved, and we give here only the result: 
 c τxy 2 τyx 1 1
2 0
0x (τxy) dx 2 1
2 0
0y (τyx) dyd  dx dy dz
 
 
5 1
12 ρ(dx dy dz)(dx2 1 dy2) d2θ
dt2  
 (4.39) 
 Assuming that the angular acceleration  d 2 θ / dt 2  is not infi nite, we can neglect all 
higher-order differential terms, which leaves a fi nite and interesting result: 
 
τxy < τyx 
 (4.40) 
 Had we summed moments about axes parallel to  y  or  x , we would have obtained 
exactly analogous results: 
 
τxz < τzx    τyz < τzy 
 (4.41) 
 There is  no  differential angular momentum equation. Application of the integral theo-
rem to a differential element gives the result, well known to students of stress analysis 
or strength of materials, that the shear stresses are symmetric:  τ ij  5  τ ji . This is the

Thermal Conductivity; 
Fourier’s Law
 
 To evaluate Q~, we neglect radiation and consider only heat conduction through the 
sides of the element. Experiments for both fl uids and solids show that the vector heat 
transfer per unit area,  q ,  is proportional to the vector gradient of temperature,  = T . 
This proportionality is called  Fo u rier’s  law  of  conduction, which is analogous to 
Newton’s viscosity law: 
 q 5 2k§T 
 
or :   qx 5 2k 0T
0x ,  qy 5 2k 0T
0y ,  qz 5 2k 0T
0z  
 (4.43) 
 where  k  is called the  thermal conductivity , a fl uid property that varies with tempera-
ture and pressure in much the same way as viscosity. The minus sign satisfi es the 
convention that heat fl ux is positive in the direction of decreasing temperature. 
 Fourier’s law is dimensionally consistent, and  k  has SI units of joules per (sec- meter-
kelvin) and can be correlated with  T  in much the same way as Eqs. (1.27) and (1.28) 
for gases and liquids, respectively. 
  
Figure 4.6 shows the heat fl ow passing through the  x  faces, the  y  and  z  heat fl ows 
being omitted for clarity. We can list these six heat fl ux terms: 
 6 We are neglecting the possibility of a fi nite  couple being applied to the element by some powerful 
external force fi eld. See, for example, Ref. 6.

The rate of work done by viscous stresses equals the product of the stress compo-
nent, its corresponding velocity component, and the area of the element face.  Figure 4.6

240 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 We now substitute Eqs. (4.45) and (4.47) into Eq. (4.43) to obtain one form of the 
differential energy equation: 
 ρ de
dt 1 V ? =p 1 p= ? V 5 = ? (k =T ) 1 = ? (V ? τij) 
where e 5 uˆ 1 1
2V2 1 gz
 
 (4.48)
 A more useful form is obtained if we split up the viscous work term: 
= ? (V ? τij) ; V ? (= ? τij) 1 £ 
 (4.49)
 where  F  is short for the  viscous-dissipation function . 8  For a newtonian incompressible 
viscous fl uid, this function has the form 
 £ 5 μc 2 a 0u

0y 1 0υ
0z b

 (4.50)
 Since all terms are quadratic, viscous dissipation is always positive, so a viscous fl ow 
always tends to lose its available energy due to dissipation, in accordance with the 
second law of thermodynamics. 
 
Now substitute Eq. (4.49) into Eq. (4.48), using the linear momentum equation 
(4.32) to eliminate  =  ?  τ ij . This will cause the kinetic and potential energies to cancel, 
leaving a more customary form of the general differential energy equation: 
ρ duˆ
dt 1 p(= ? V) 5 = ? (k =T ) 1 £  
 (4.51)
 This equation is valid for a newtonian fl uid under very general conditions of unsteady, 
compressible, viscous, heat-conducting fl ow, except that it neglects radiation heat 
transfer and internal  sources  of heat that might occur during a chemical or nuclear 
reaction. 
  
Equation (4.51) is too diffi cult to analyze except on a digital computer [1]. It is 
customary to make the following approximations: 
duˆ < cυ dT  cυ , μ, k, ρ < const 
 (4.52)
 Equation (4.51) then takes the simpler form, for  =  ?  V  5  0, 
ρcυ dT
dt 5 k§2T 1 £ 
 (4.53)
 which involves temperature  T  as the sole primary variable plus velocity as a second-
ary variable through the total time-derivative operator: 
dT

0t 1 u 0T
0x 1 υ 0T
0y 1 w 0T
0z  
 (4.54)
8 For further details, see, Ref. 5, p. 72.

4.6  Boundary Conditions for the Basic Equations 241
 A great many interesting solutions to Eq. (4.53) are known for various fl ow condi-
tions, and extended treatments are given in advanced books on viscous fl ow [4, 5] 
and books on heat transfer [7, 8]. 
  
One well-known special case of Eq. (4.53) occurs when the fl uid is at rest or has 
negligible velocity, where the dissipation  F  and convective terms become negligible: 
 
ρcp 0T
0t 5 k§2T 
 (4.55) 
 The change from  c υ  to  c p  is correct and justifi ed by the fact that, when pressure terms 
are neglected from a gas fl ow energy equation [4, 5], what remains is approximately 
an enthalpy change, not an internal energy change. This is called the  heat conduction 
equation  in applied mathematics and is valid for solids and fl uids at rest. The solution 
to Eq.   (4.55) for various conditions is a large part of courses and books on heat 
transfer. 
 
This completes the derivation of the basic differential equations of fl uid motion. 
4.6 Boundary Conditions for 
the Basic Equations
 
 There are three basic differential equations of fl uid motion, just derived. Let us sum-
marize those here: 
 Continuity: 
0ρ
0t 1 = ? (ρV) 5 0 
 (4.56) 
 Momentum: 
ρ dV
dt 5 ρg 2 =p 1 = ? τij 
 (4.57) 
 Energy: 
ρ duˆ
dt 1 p(= ? V) 5 = ? (k =T ) 1 £ 
 (4.58) 
 where  F  is given by Eq. (4.50). In general, the density is variable, so these three 
equations contain fi ve unknowns,  ρ ,  V ,  p ,  û , and  T . Therefore, we need two additional 
relations to complete the system of equations. These are provided by data or algebraic 
expressions for the state relations of the thermodynamic properties: 
 
ρ 5 ρ(p, T )    uˆ 5 uˆ(p, T) 
 (4.59) 
 For example, for a perfect gas with constant specifi c heats, we complete the system 
with 
 
ρ 5 p
RT    uˆ 5 #cυ dT < cυ T 1 const 
 (4.60) 
 It is shown in advanced books [4, 5] that this system of equations (4.56) to (4.59) is 
well posed and can be solved analytically or numerically, subject to the proper bound-
ary conditions. 
  
What are the proper boundary conditions? First, if the fl ow is unsteady, there must 
be an  initial  co n dition or initial spatial distribution known for each variable: 
 At t 5 0: 
ρ, V, p, uˆ, T 5 known f(x, y, z) 
 (4.61) 
 Thereafter, for all times  t to be analyzed, we must know something about the variables 
at each  boundary enclosing the fl ow. 

242 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
  
Figure 4.7 illustrates the three most common types of boundaries encountered in 
fl uid fl ow analysis: a solid wall, an inlet or outlet, and a liquid–gas interface. 
  
First, for a solid, impermeable wall, there can be slip and temperature jump in a 
viscous heat-conducting fl uid: 
 No-slip:            Vfluid 5 Vwall       Tfluid 5 Twall 
 Rarefied gas: ufluid 2 uwall < / 0u
0nZwall  Tfluid 2 Twall < a
2ζ
ζ 1 1b k
μcp
/0T
0nZwall 
 (4.62) 
 where, for the rarefi ed gas,  n  is normal to the wall, u is parallel to the wall, ℓ is the 
mean free path of the gas [see Eq. (1.37)], and  ζ  denotes, just this one time, the 
specifi c heat ratio. The above so-called  temper a ture-jump  relation  for gases is given 
here only for completeness and will not be studied (see page 48 of Ref. 5). A few 
velocity-jump assignments will be given. 
  
Second, at any inlet or outlet section of the fl ow, the complete distribution of 
velocity, pressure, and temperature must be known for all times: 
 Inlet or outlet: 
Known V, p, T 
 (4.63) 
 These inlet and outlet sections can be and often are at  6  ` , simulating a body 
immersed in an infi nite expanse of fl uid. 
  
Finally, the most complex conditions occur at a liquid–gas interface, or free  surface, 
as sketched in Fig. 4.7. Let us denote the interface by 
 Interface: 
z 5 η(x, y, t) 
 (4.64) 
Z

Liquid
Inlet:
known V, p, T
Outlet:

 Fig. 4.7  Typical boundary 
conditions in a viscous heat-
conducting fl uid fl ow analysis.

4.6  Boundary Conditions for the Basic Equations 243
 Then there must be equality of vertical velocity across the interface, so that no holes 
appear between liquid and gas: 
 
wliq 5 wgas 5 dη
dt 5 0η
0t 1 u 0η
0x 1 υ 0η
0y 
 (4.65) 
 This is called the  kinematic boundary condition . 
  
There must be mechanical equilibrium across the interface. The viscous shear 
stresses must balance: 
 
(τzy)liq 5 (τzy)gas    (τzx)liq 5 (τzx)gas 
 (4.66) 
 Neglecting the viscous normal stresses, the pressures must balance at the interface 
except for surface tension effects: 
 
pliq 5 pgas 2 Y(R21
x
1 R21
y ) 
 (4.67) 
 which is equivalent to Eq. (1.33). The radii of curvature can be written in terms of 
the free surface position  η : 
  R21
x
1 R21
y
5 0
0x c
0η/0x

 1 0
0y c
0η/0y
21 1 (0η/0x)2 1 (0η/0y)2 d  
 (4.68) 
  
Finally, the heat transfer must be the same on both sides of the interface, since no 
heat can be stored in the infi nitesimally thin interface: 
 
(qz)liq 5 (qz)gas 
 (4.69) 
 Neglecting radiation, this is equivalent to 
 
ak 0T
0z b
liq
5 ak 0T
0z b

 (4.70) 
 This is as much detail as we wish to give at this level of exposition. Further and even 
more complicated details on fl uid fl ow boundary conditions are given in Refs. 5 and 9. 
Simplifi ed Free Surface Conditions 
 In the introductory analyses given in this book, such as open-channel fl ows in 
Chap. 10, we shall back away from the exact conditions (4.65) to (4.69) and assume 
that the upper fl uid is an “atmosphere” that merely exerts pressure on the lower fl uid, 
with shear and heat conduction negligible. We also neglect nonlinear terms involving 
the slopes of the free surface. We then have a much simpler and linear set of condi-
tions at the surface: 
 pliq < pgas 2 Ya 02η
0x2 1 02η
0y2 b   wliq < 0η
0t  
 
a 0V
0z b
liq
< 0   a 0T
z b
liq
< 0 
 (4.71) 

244 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 In many cases, such as open-channel fl ow, we can also neglect surface tension, so 
 
pliq < patm 
 (4.72) 
 These are the types of approximations that will be used in Chap. 10. The nondimen-
sional forms of these conditions will also be useful in Chap. 5. 
Incompressible Flow with 
Constant Properties
 
 Flow with constant  ρ ,  μ , and  k  is a basic simplifi cation that will be used, for example, 
throughout Chap. 6. The basic equations of motion (4.56) to (4.58) reduce to 
 Continuity: 
= ? V 5 0 
 (4.73) 
 Momentum: 
ρ d V
dt 5 ρg 2 =p 1 μ=2V 
 (4.74) 
 Energy: 
ρcp dT
dt 5 k=2T 1 £ 
 (4.75) 
 Since  ρ  is constant, there are only three unknowns:  p ,  V , and  T . The system is closed. 9 
Not only that, the system splits apart: Continuity and momentum are independent of 
 T . Thus we can solve Eqs. (4.73) and (4.74) entirely separately for the pressure and 
velocity, using such boundary conditions as 
 Solid surface: 
V 5 Vwall 
 (4.76) 
 Inlet or outlet: 
Known V, p 
 (4.77) 
 Free surface: 
p < pa    w < 0η
0t  
 (4.78)  
 Later, usually in another course, 10  we can solve for the temperature distribution from 
Eq. (4.75), which depends on velocity  V  through the dissipation  F  and the total time-
derivative operator  d / dt .  
Inviscid Flow Approximations
 
 Chapter 8 assumes inviscid fl ow throughout, for which the viscosity  μ  5  0. The 
momentum equation (4.74) reduces to 
 
ρ d V
dt 5 ρg 2 =p 
 (4.79) 
 This is  Euler’s equation;  it can be integrated along a streamline to obtain Bernoulli’s 
equation (see Sec. 4.9). By neglecting viscosity we have lost the second-order deriv-
ative of  V  in Eq. (4.74); therefore, we must relax one boundary condition on velocity. 
The only mathematically sensible condition to drop is the no-slip condition at the wall. 
We let the fl ow slip parallel to the wall but do not allow it to fl ow into the wall. The 
proper inviscid condition is that the normal velocities must match at any solid surface: 
 Inviscid fl ow: 
(Vn)fluid 5 (Vn)wall 
 (4.80) 
 9 For this system, what are the thermodynamic equivalents to Eq. (4.59)?
 10 Since temperature is entirely  uncoupled by this assumption, we may never get around to solving 
for it here and may ask you to wait until you take a course on heat transfer.

4.6  Boundary Conditions for the Basic Equations 245
 In most cases the wall is fi xed; therefore, the proper inviscid fl ow condition is 
 
Vn 5 0 
 (4.81) 
 There is  no  condition whatever on the tangential velocity component at the wall in 
inviscid fl ow. The tangential velocity will be part of the solution to an inviscid fl ow 
analysis (see Chap. 8). 
 EXAMPLE  4.6 
 For steady incompressible laminar fl ow through a long tube, the velocity distribution is 
given by 
 
 υz 5 U a1 2 r 2
R2b   υr 5 υθ 5 0 
 where  U  is the maximum, or centerline, velocity and  R  is the tube radius. If the wall tem-
perature is constant at  T w and the temperature  T  5  T ( r ) only, fi nd  T ( r ) for this fl ow. 
 Solution 
 With  T  5  T ( r ), Eq. (4.75) reduces for steady fl ow to 
 
ρcpυr dT
dr 5 k
r d
dr ar dT
dr b 1 μa
dυz
dr b
2
 
 (1) 
 But since  υ r  5    0 for this fl ow, the convective term on the left vanishes. Introduce  υ z into 
Eq. (1) to obtain 
 
k
r d
dr ar dT
dr b 5 2μa
dυz
dr b

4U2μr 2

 (2) 
 Multiply through by  r / k and integrate once: 
 
r dT
dr 5 2
μU2r4
kR4
1 C1 
 (3) 
 Divide through by  r and integrate once again: 
 
T 5 2
μU2r4
4kR4 1 C1 ln r 1 C2 
 (4) 
 Now we are in position to apply our boundary conditions to evaluate  C 1 and  C 2 . 
  
First, since the logarithm of zero is  2` , the temperature at  r  5    0 will be infi nite unless 
 
 C1 5 0 
 (5) 
 Thus, we eliminate the possibility of a logarithmic singularity. The same thing will happen 
if we apply the  symmetry  condition  dT / dr  5  0 at  r  5    0 to Eq. (3). The constant  C 2  is then 
found by the wall-temperature condition at  r  5  R :

μU2
4k  1 C2

 The correct solution is thus

 which is a fourth-order parabolic distribution with a maximum value  T 0  5  T w  1  μ U 2 /(4 k ) 
at the centerline. 
4.7 The Stream Function
 
 We have seen in Sec. 4.6 that even if the temperature is uncoupled from our system 
of equations of motion, we must solve the continuity and momentum equations 
simultaneously for pressure and velocity. The  stream function  ψ  is a clever device 
that allows us to satisfy the continuity equation and then solve the momentum 
 equation directly for the single variable  ψ . Lines of constant  ψ  are streamlines of 
the fl ow. 
  
The stream function idea works only if the continuity equation (4.56) can be 
reduced to  two terms. In general, we have  four terms: 
 Cartesian: 
0ρ
0t 1 0
0x (ρu) 1 0
0y (ρυ) 1 0
0z (ρw) 5 0 
 (4.82 a )
 Cylindrical: 
0ρ
0t 1 1
r 0
0r (rρυr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (ρυθ) 1 0
0z (ρυz) 5 0 
 (4.82 b )
 First, let us eliminate unsteady fl ow, which is a peculiar and unrealistic application 
of the stream function idea. Reduce either of Eqs. (4.82) to any  two  terms. The most 
common application is incompressible fl ow in the  xy plane: 
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 5 0 
 (4.83)
 This equation is satisfi ed  identically  if a function  ψ ( x ,  y ) is defi ned such that Eq. (4.83) 
becomes 
0
0x a 0ψ
0y b 1 0
0y a20ψ
0x b ; 0 
 (4.84)
 Comparison of (4.83) and (4.84) shows that this new function  ψ  must be defi ned such 
that 
u 5 0ψ
0y    υ 5 2 0ψ
0x
 
 (4.85)
 or 
V 5 i 0ψ
0y 2 j 0ψ
0x
 

4.7  The Stream Function 247
 Is this legitimate? Yes, it is just a mathematical trick of replacing two variables ( u  and 
 υ ) by a single higher-order function  ψ . The vorticity 11  or curl  V  is an interesting 
function: 
 
curl V 5 2k§ 2ψ    where    §2ψ 5 02ψ
0x2 1 02ψ
0y2  
 (4.86)  
 Thus, if we take the curl of the momentum equation (4.74) and utilize Eq. (4.86), we 
obtain a single equation for  ψ for incompressible fl ow: 
 
0ψ
0y  0
0x (§2ψ) 2 0ψ
0x  0
0y (§2ψ) 5 ν§2(§2ψ) 
 (4.87) 
 where  ν  5  μ / ρ  is the kinematic viscosity. This is partly a victory and partly a defeat: 
Eq. (4.87) is scalar and has only one variable,  ψ , but it now contains  fourth -order 
derivatives and probably will require computer analysis. There will be four boundary 
conditions required on  ψ . For example, for the fl ow of a uniform stream in the 
 x   direction past a solid body, the four conditions would be 
 At infi nity: 
0ψ
0y 5 Uq   0ψ
0x 5 0 
 At the body: 
0ψ
0y 5 0ψ
0x 5 0 
 (4.88) 
 Many examples of numerical solution of Eqs. (4.87) and (4.88) are given in Ref. 1. 
  
One important application is inviscid, incompressible,  irrotational fl ow 12  in the  xy 
plane, where curl  V  ; 0. Equations (4.86) and (4.87) reduce to 
 
§2ψ 5 02ψ
0x2 1 02ψ
0y2 5 0 
 (4.89)  
 This is the second-order  Laplace equation  (Chap. 8), for which many solutions and 
analytical techniques are known. Also, boundary conditions like Eq. (4.88) reduce to 
 At infi nity: 
ψ 5 Uqy 1 const 
 (4.90) 
 At the body: 
ψ 5 const 
 It is well within our capability to fi nd some useful solutions to Eqs. (4.89) and (4.90), 
which we shall do in Chap. 8. 
Geometric Interpretation of ψ
 
 The fancy mathematics above would serve alone to make the stream function immor-
tal and always useful to engineers. Even better, though,  ψ  has a beautiful geometric 
interpretation: Lines of constant  ψ  are  strea m lines  of the fl ow. This can be shown   as  
 follows: From Eq. (1.41) the defi nition of a streamline in two-dimensional fl ow is 
 dx
u 5 dy
υ  
 or 
u dy 2 υ dx 5 0   streamline 
 (4.91) 
 11 See Section 4.8.
 12 See Section 4.8.

248 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 Introducing the stream function from Eq. (4.85), we have 
 
0ψ
0x  dx 1 0ψ
0y  dy 5 0 5 dψ 
 (4.92) 
 Thus the change in  ψ is zero along a streamline, or 
 
ψ 5 const along a streamline 
 (4.93)  
 Having found a given solution  ψ  ( x ,  y ), we can plot lines of constant  ψ  to give the 
streamlines of the fl ow. 
  
There is also a physical interpretation that relates  ψ  to volume fl ow. From Fig. 4.8, 
we can compute the volume fl ow  dQ  through an element  ds  of control surface of unit 
depth: 
 dQ 5 (V ? n) dA 5 ai 0ψ
0y 2 j 0ψ
0x b ? ai dy
ds 2 j dx
dsb ds(1) 
 
 5 0ψ
0x  dx 1 0ψ
0y  dy 5 dψ
 
 (4.94) 
 Thus the change in  ψ  across the element is numerically equal to the volume fl ow 
through the element. The volume fl ow between any two streamlines in the fl ow fi eld 
is equal to the change in stream function between those streamlines: 
 
Q1S2 5 #
2
1
(V ? n) dA 5 #
2
1
dψ 5 ψ2 2 ψ1 
 (4.95) 
 Further, the direction of the fl ow can be ascertained by noting whether  ψ increases 
or decreases. As sketched in Fig. 4.9, the fl ow is to the right if  ψ U  is greater than  ψ L , 
where the subscripts stand for upper and lower, as before; otherwise the fl ow is to 
the left. 
  
Both the stream function and the velocity potential were invented by the French 
mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange and published in his treatise on fl uid mechanics 
in 1781.

4.7  The Stream Function 249
 EXAMPLE  4.7 
 If a stream function exists for the velocity fi eld of Example 4.5 
 
 u 5 a(x2 2 y2)  υ 5 22axy w 5 0 
 fi nd it, plot it, and interpret it. 
 Solution 
 •  Assumptions: Incompressible, two-dimensional fl ow. 
 •  Approach:  Use the defi nition of stream function derivatives, Eqs. (4.85), to fi nd  ψ  ( x ,  y ). 
 •  Solution step 1:  Note that this velocity distribution was also examined in Example 4.3. 
It satisfi es continuity, Eq. (4.83), but let’s check that; otherwise  ψ will not exist: 
 0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 5 0
0x 3a(x2 2 y2) 4 1 0
0y (22axy) 5 2ax 1 (22ax) ; 0  checks 
 Thus we are certain that a stream function exists. 
 •  Solution step 2: To fi nd  ψ , write out Eqs. (4.85) and integrate: 
 
u 5
0ψ
0y 5 ax2 2 ay2 
 (1) 
 
υ 5 20ψ

 and work from either one toward the other. Integrate (1) partially 
 
ψ 5 ax2y 2 ay3

 (3) 
 Differentiate (3) with respect to  x and compare with (2) 
 
0ψ
0x 5 2axy 1 f ¿(x) 5 2axy 
 (4) 
 Therefore  f 9 ( x )  5  0, or  f  5  constant. The complete stream function is thus found:

 for constant values of  ψ . The result is shown in Fig. E4.7 a  to be six 60 8  wedges of circulat-
ing motion, each with identical fl ow patterns except for the arrows. Once the streamlines are 
labeled, the fl ow directions follow from the sign convention of Fig. 4.9. How can the fl ow 
be interpreted? Since there is slip along all streamlines, no streamline can truly represent a 
solid surface in a viscous fl ow. However, the fl ow could represent the impingement of three 
incoming streams at 60, 180, and 300 8 . This would be a rather unrealistic yet exact solution 
to the Navier-Stokes equations, as we showed in Example 4.5.

 By allowing the fl ow to slip as a frictionless approximation, we could let any given 
streamline be a body shape. Some examples are shown in Fig. E4.7 b . 

4.7  The Stream Function 251
  
A stream function also exists in a variety of other physical situations where only 
two coordinates are needed to defi ne the fl ow. Three examples are illustrated here. 
 Steady Plane Compressible Flow
 
Suppose now that the density is variable but that  w  5    0, so that the fl ow is in the  xy 
plane. Then the equation of continuity becomes 
 
0
0x (ρu) 1 0
0y (ρυ) 5 0 
 (4.96) 
 We see that this is in exactly the same form as Eq. (4.84). Therefore a compressible 
fl ow stream function can be defi ned such that 
 
ρu 5 0ψ
0y   ρυ 5 20ψ
0x  
 (4.97) 
 Again lines of constant  ψ are streamlines of the fl ow, but the change in  ψ is now 
equal to the  mass fl ow, not the volume fl ow: 
 dm# 5 ρ(V ? n) dA 5 dψ 
 or 
m#
1S2 5 #
2
1
ρ(V ? n) dA 5 ψ2 2 ψ1 
 (4.98) 
 The sign convention on fl ow direction is the same as in Fig. 4.9. This particular stream 
function combines density with velocity and must be substituted into not only momen-
tum but also the energy and state relations (4.58) and (4.59) with pressure and tem-
perature as companion variables. Thus the compressible stream function is not a great 
victory, and further assumptions must be made to effect an analytical solution to a 
typical problem (see, for instance, Ref. 5, Chap. 7). 
Incompressible Plane Flow in 
Polar Coordinates
 
 Suppose that the important coordinates are  r  and  θ , with  υ z  5    0, and that the density 
is constant. Then Eq. (4.82 b ) reduces to 
 
1
r 0
0r (rυr) 1 1
r 0
0θ (υθ) 5 0 
 (4.99) 
 After multiplying through by  r , we see that this is the analogous form of Eq. (4.84): 
 
0
0r a 0ψ
0θ b 1 0
0θ a20ψ
0r b 5 0 
 (4.100) 
 By comparison of (4.99) and (4.100) we deduce the form of the incompressible polar 
coordinate stream function: 
 
υr 5 1
r 0ψ
0θ   υθ 5 20ψ
0r  
 (4.101) 
 Once again lines of constant  ψ are streamlines, and the change in  ψ is the  volume 
fl ow Q1S2 5 ψ2 2 ψ1. The sign convention is the same as in Fig. 4.9. This type of 
stream function is very useful in analyzing fl ows with cylinders, vortices, sources, 
and sinks (Chap. 8). 

252 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
Incompressible Axisymmetric 
Flow
 
 As a fi nal example, suppose that the fl ow is three-dimensional ( υ r ,  υ z ) but with no 
circumferential variations,  υ θ  5  ≠ / ≠ θ  5    0 (see Fig. 4.2 for defi nition of coordinates). 
Such a fl ow is termed  axisymmetric, and the fl ow pattern is the same when viewed 
on any meridional plane through the axis of revolution  z . For incompressible fl ow, 
Eq. (4.82 b ) becomes 
 
1
r 0
0r (rυr) 1 0
0z (υz) 5 0 
 (4.102) 
 This doesn’t seem to work: Can’t we get rid of the one  r  outside? But when we  realize 
that  r and  z are independent coordinates, Eq. (4.102) can be rewritten as 
 
0
0r (rυr) 1 0
0z (rυz) 5 0 
 (4.103) 
 By analogy with Eq. (4.84), this has the form 
 
0
0r a20ψ
0z b 1 0
0z a 0ψ
0r b 5 0 
 (4.104) 
 By comparing (4.103) and (4.104), we deduce the form of an incompressible axisym-
metric stream function  ψ ( r ,  z ) 
 
υr 5 2 1
r 0ψ
0z     υz 5 1
r 0ψ
0r  
 (4.105) 
 Here again lines of constant  ψ  are streamlines, but there is a factor (2 π ) in the volume 
fl ow: Q1S2 5 2π(ψ2 2 ψ1). The sign convention on fl ow is the same as in Fig.   4.9. 
 EXAMPLE  4.8 
 Investigate the stream function in polar coordinates 
 
ψ 5 U sin θ ar 2 R2
r b 
 (1) 
 where  U  and  R  are constants, a velocity and a length, respectively. Plot the streamlines. What 
does the fl ow represent? Is it a realistic solution to the basic equations? 
 Solution 
 The streamlines are lines of constant  ψ , which has units of square meters per second. Note that 
 ψ /( UR ) is dimensionless. Rewrite Eq. (1) in dimensionless form 
 
ψ

 Of particular interest is the special line  ψ  5    0. From Eq. (1) or (2) this occurs when ( a )  θ  5  0 
or 180 8  and ( b )  r  5  R . Case ( a ) is the  x  axis, and case ( b ) is a circle of radius  R ,  both of which 
are plotted in Fig. E4.8. 

4.8  Vorticity and Irrotationality 253
 
For any other nonzero value of  ψ it is easiest to pick a value of  r and solve for  θ : 
 
sin θ 5
ψ/(UR)

 (3) 
 In general, there will be two solutions for  θ  because of the symmetry about the  y  axis. For 
example, take  ψ /( UR )  5  1 1.0:

 This second curve plots as a closed curve inside the circle  r  5  R . There is a singularity of infi -
nite velocity and indeterminate fl ow direction at the origin. Figure E4.8 shows the full pattern. 
  
The given stream function, Eq. (1), is an exact and classic solution to the momentum 
equation (4.38) for frictionless fl ow. Outside the circle  r  5  R  it represents two-dimensional 
inviscid fl ow of a uniform stream past a circular cylinder (Sec. 8.4). Inside the circle it 
represents a rather unrealistic trapped circulating motion of what is called a  line doublet . 
4.8 Vorticity and Irrotationality 
 The assumption of zero fl uid angular velocity, or irrotationality, is a very useful 
 simplifi cation. Here we show that angular velocity is associated with the curl of the 
local velocity vector. 
  
The differential relations for deformation of a fl uid element can be derived by 
examining Fig. 4.10. Two fl uid lines  AB and  BC , initially perpendicular at time  t , 

254 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
move and deform so that at  t  1  dt  they have slightly different lengths  A 9 B 9  and  B 9 C 9 
and are slightly off the perpendicular by angles  d α  and  d β . Such deformation occurs 
kinematically because  A ,  B , and  C  have slightly different velocities when the velocity 
fi eld  V  has spatial gradients. All these differential changes in the motion of  A ,  B , and 
 C are noted in Fig. 4.10. 
 
We defi ne the angular velocity  ω z  about the  z  axis as the average rate of counter-
clockwise turning of the two lines: 
 
ωz 5 1
2 adα
dt 2 dβ
dt b 
 (4.106) 
 But from Fig. 4.10,  d α and  d β  are each directly related to velocity derivatives in the 
limit of small  dt : 
 dα 5 lim

(0υ/0x) dx dt

0z 2 0w

 (4.110)
 Since the factor of 1
2 is annoying, many workers prefer to use a vector twice as large, 
called the  vorticity : 
ζ 5 2ω 5 curl V 
 (4.111)
 
Many fl ows have negligible or zero vorticity and are called  irrotational : 
curl V ; 0 
 (4.112)
 The next section expands on this idea. Such fl ows can be incompressible or compress-
ible, steady or unsteady. 
 
We may also note that Fig. 4.10 demonstrates the  shear strain rate of the element, 
which is defi ned as the rate of closure of the initially perpendicular lines: 
ε#
xy 5 dα
dt 1 dβ
dt 5 0υ
0x 1 0u
0y 
 (4.113)
 When multiplied by viscosity  μ , this equals the shear stress  τ xy  in a newtonian fl uid, 
as discussed earlier in Eqs. (4.37). Appendix D lists strain rate and vorticity compo-
nents in cylindrical coordinates. 
4.9 Frictionless Irrotational 
Flows
 
 When a fl ow is both frictionless and irrotational, pleasant things happen. First, the 
momentum equation (4.38) reduces to Euler’s equation: 
ρ dV
dt 5 ρg 2 =p 
 (4.114)
 Second, there is a great simplifi cation in the acceleration term. Recall from Sec. 4.1 
that acceleration has two terms: 
dV
dt 5 0V
0t 1 (V ? =)V 
 (4.2)
 A beautiful vector identity exists for the second term [11]: 
(V ? =)V ; =(1
2V2) 1 ζ 3 V 
 (4.115)
 where  ζ  5  curl  V from Eq. (4.111) is the fl uid vorticity. 

256 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
  
Now combine (4.114) and (4.115), divide by  ρ , and rearrange on the left-hand side. 
Dot-product the entire equation into an arbitrary vector displacement  d r : 
c 0V
0t 1 = a1
2 V2b 1 ζ 3 V 1 1
ρ  =p 2 gd ? dr 5 0 
 (4.116)
 Nothing works right unless we can get rid of the third term. We want 
(ζ 3 V) ? (dr) ; 0 
 (4.117)
 This will be true under various conditions: 
 1.  V is zero; trivial, no fl ow (hydrostatics). 
 2.  ζ is zero; irrotational fl ow. 
 3.  dr  is perpendicular to  ζ  3  V ; this is rather specialized and rare. 
 4.  dr is parallel to  V ; we integrate  along a streamline (see Sec. 3.5). 
 Condition 4 is the common assumption. If we integrate along a streamline in friction-
less compressible fl ow and take, for convenience,  g  5  2 g k , Eq. (4.116) reduces to 
0V
0t ? dr 1 d a1
2 V2b 1 dp
ρ 1 g dz 5 0 
 (4.118)
 Except for the fi rst term, these are exact differentials. Integrate between any two points 
1 and 2 along the streamline: 
#

 0V
0t  ds 1 #
2
1
  dp
ρ 1 1
2 (V2
2 2 V1
2) 1 g(z2 2 z1) 5 0 
 (4.119)
 where  ds  is the arc length along the streamline. Equation (4.119) is Bernoulli’s equa-
tion for frictionless unsteady fl ow along a streamline and is identical to Eq. (3.53). 
For incompressible steady fl ow, it reduces to 
p
ρ 1 1
2 V2 1 gz 5 constant along streamline 
 (4.120)
 The constant may vary from streamline to streamline unless the fl ow is also irrota-
tional (assumption 2). For irrotational fl ow  ζ  5    0, the offending term Eq. (4.117) 
vanishes regardless of the direction of  d r , and Eq. (4.120) then holds all over the fl ow 
fi eld with the same constant. 
Velocity Potential
 
 Irrotationality gives rise to a scalar function  ϕ  similar and complementary to the 
stream function  ψ . From a theorem in vector analysis [11], a vector with zero curl 
must be the gradient of a scalar function 
If    = 3 V ; 0    then    V 5 =ϕ 
 (4.121)
 where  ϕ  5  ϕ  ( x ,  y ,  z ,  t ) is called the  velocity potential function . Knowledge of  ϕ thus 
immediately gives the velocity components 
u 5 0ϕ
0x    υ 5 0ϕ
0y    w 5 0ϕ
0z  
 (4.122)
 Lines of constant  ϕ are called the  potential lines of the fl ow. 

4.9  Frictionless Irrotational Flows 257
  
Note that  ϕ , unlike the stream function, is fully three-dimensional and is not limited 
to two coordinates. It reduces a velocity problem with three unknowns  u ,  υ , and  w 
to a single unknown potential  ϕ ; many examples are given in Chap. 8. The velocity 
potential also simplifi es the unsteady Bernoulli equation (4.118) because if  ϕ exists, 
we obtain 
 
0V
0t ? dr 5 0
0t (=ϕ) ? dr 5 d a 0ϕ
0t b 
 (4.123) 
 along any arbitrary direction. Equation (4.118) then becomes a relation between  ϕ 
and  p : 
 
0ϕ
0t 1 # dp
ρ 1 1
2 0=ϕ 02 1 gz 5 const 
 (4.124) 
 This is the unsteady irrotational Bernoulli equation. It is very important in the analy-
sis of accelerating fl ow fi elds (see Refs. 10 and 15), but the only application in this 
text will be in Sec. 9.3 for steady fl ow. 
Orthogonality of Streamlines and 
Potential Lines
 
 If a fl ow is both irrotational and described by only two coordinates,  ψ  and  ϕ both 
exist, and the streamlines and potential lines are everywhere mutually perpendicular 
except at a stagnation point. For example, for incompressible fl ow in the  xy plane, 
we would have 
 
 u 5 0ψ
0y 5 0ϕ
0x
 
 (4.125) 
 
υ 5 20ψ
0x 5 0ϕ
0y  
 (4.126) 
 Can you tell by inspection not only that these relations imply orthogonality but also 
that  ϕ  and  ψ  satisfy Laplace’s equation? 13  A line of constant  ϕ  would be such that 
the change in  ϕ is zero: 
 
dϕ 5 0ϕ
0x  dx 1 0ϕ
0y  dy 5 0 5 u dx 1 υ dy 
 (4.127) 
 Solving, we have 
 
ady
dxb
ϕ5const
5 2u
υ 5 2
1
(dy/dx)ψ5const
 
 (4.128)  
 Equation (4.128) is the mathematical condition that lines of constant  ϕ  and  ψ be 
mutually orthogonal. It may not be true at a stagnation point, where both  u  and  υ are 
zero, so their ratio in Eq. (4.128) is indeterminate. 
 13 Equations (4.125) and (4.126) are called the  Cauchy-Riemann  equations and are studied in 
 complex variable theory.

258 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
Generation of Rotationality14
 
 This is the second time we have discussed Bernoulli’s equation under different 
 circumstances (the fi rst was in Sec. 3.5). Such reinforcement is useful, since this is 
probably the most widely used equation in fl uid mechanics. It requires frictionless 
fl ow with no shaft work or heat transfer between sections 1 and 2. The fl ow may or 
may not be irrotational, the former being an easier condition, allowing a universal 
Bernoulli constant.  
 
The only remaining question is this:  When is a fl ow irrotational? In other words, 
when does a fl ow have negligible angular velocity? The exact analysis of fl uid rota-
tionality under arbitrary conditions is a topic for advanced study (for example, Ref. 10, 
Sec. 8.5; Ref. 9, Sec. 5.2; and Ref. 5, Sec. 2.10). We shall simply state those results 
here without proof. 
 
A fl uid fl ow that is initially irrotational may become rotational if 
 1. There are signifi cant viscous forces induced by jets, wakes, or solid boundaries. 
In this case Bernoulli’s equation will not be valid in such viscous regions. 
 2. There are entropy gradients caused by curved shock waves (see Fig. 4.11 b ). 
 3. There are density gradients caused by  stratifi cation (uneven heating) rather than 
by pressure gradients. 
 4. There are signifi cant  noninertial effects such as the earth’s rotation (the 
 Coriolis acceleration). 
 In cases 2 to 4, Bernoulli’s equation still holds along a streamline if friction is  negligible. 
We shall not study cases 3 and 4 in this book. Case 2 will be treated briefl y in Chap. 9 
on gas dynamics. Primarily we are concerned with case 1, where rotation is induced 
by viscous stresses. This occurs near solid surfaces, where the no-slip condition creates 
a boundary layer through which the stream velocity drops to zero, and in jets and 
wakes, where streams of different velocities meet in a region of high shear. 
 
Internal fl ows, such as pipes and ducts, are mostly viscous, and the wall layers 
grow to meet in the core of the duct. Bernoulli’s equation does not hold in such fl ows 
unless it is modifi ed for viscous losses. 
 
External fl ows, such as a body immersed in a stream, are partly viscous and partly 
inviscid, the two regions being patched together at the edge of the shear layer or 
boundary layer. Two examples are shown in Fig. 4.11. Figure 4.11 a  shows a low-
speed subsonic fl ow past a body. The approach stream is irrotational; that is, the curl 
of a constant is zero, but viscous stresses create a rotational shear layer beside and 
downstream of the body. Generally speaking (see Chap. 7), the shear layer is laminar, 
or smooth, near the front of the body and turbulent, or disorderly, toward the rear. 
A separated, or deadwater, region usually occurs near the trailing edge, followed by an 
unsteady turbulent wake extending far downstream. Some sort of laminar or turbulent 
viscous theory must be applied to these viscous regions; they are then patched onto 
the outer fl ow, which is frictionless and irrotational. If the stream Mach number is 
less than about 0.3, we can combine Eq. (4.122) with the incompressible continuity 
equation (4.73): 
 = ? V 5 = ? (=ϕ) 5 0 
 14 This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

 This is Laplace’s equation in three dimensions, there being no restraint on the number 
of coordinates in potential fl ow. A great deal of Chap. 8 will be concerned with solv-
ing Eq. (4.129) for practical engineering problems; it holds in the entire region of 
Fig. 4.11 a outside the shear layer. 
 
Figure 4.11 b  shows a supersonic fl ow past a round-nosed body. A curved shock 
wave generally forms in front, and the fl ow downstream is  rotational  due to entropy 
gradients (case 2). We can use Euler’s equation (4.114) in this frictionless region but 
not potential theory. The shear layers have the same general character as in Fig. 4.11 a
except that the separation zone is slight or often absent and the wake is usually thin-
ner. Theory of separated fl ow is presently qualitative, but we can make quantitative 
estimates of laminar and turbulent boundary layers and wakes.

4.10  Some Illustrative Incompressible Viscous Flows 261
 Letting  C  5    0, we can plot the  ϕ  lines in the same fashion as in Example 4.7. The result is 
shown in Fig. E4.9 (no arrows on  ϕ ). For this particular problem, the  ϕ  lines form the same 
pattern as the  ψ  lines of Example 4.7 (which are shown here as dashed lines) but are displaced 
30 8 . The  ϕ  and  ψ  lines are everywhere perpendicular except at the origin, a stagnation point, 
where they are 30 8 apart. We expected trouble at the stagnation point, and there is no general 
rule for determining the behavior of the lines at that point. 
4.10 Some Illustrative 
Incompressible Viscous Flows
 
 Inviscid fl ows do  not  satisfy the no-slip condition. They “slip” at the wall but do not 
fl ow through the wall. To look at fully viscous no-slip conditions, we must attack the 
complete Navier-Stokes equation (4.74), and the result is usually not at all irrotational, 
nor does a velocity potential exist. We look here at three cases: (1) fl ow between 
parallel plates due to a moving upper wall, (2) fl ow between parallel plates due to 
pressure gradient, and (3) fl ow between concentric cylinders when the inner one 
rotates. Other cases will be given as problem assignments or considered in Chap. 6. 
Extensive solutions for viscous fl ows are discussed in Refs. 4 and 5. All fl ows in this 
section are viscous and rotational. 
Couette Flow between a Fixed 
and a Moving Plate
 
 Consider two-dimensional incompressible plane ( ∂ / ∂ z  5  0) viscous fl ow between 
parallel plates a distance 2 h  apart, as shown in Fig. 4.12. We assume that the plates 
are very wide and very long, so the fl ow is essentially axial,  u  ﬁ  0 but  υ  5  w 5  0. 
The present case is Fig. 4.12 a , where the upper plate moves at velocity  V  but there 
is no pressure gradient. Neglect gravity effects. We learn from the continuity equation 
(4.73) that 
 0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 1 0w
0z 5 0 5 0u
0x 1 0 1 0    or    u 5 u(y) only 
 Thus there is a single nonzero axial velocity component that varies only across the 
channel. The fl ow is said to be  fully developed  (far downstream of the entrance).

Substitute  u  5  u ( y ) into the  x  component of the Navier-Stokes momentum equa-
tion (4.74) for two-dimensional ( x ,  y ) fl ow: 
 ρau 0u
0x 1 υ 0u
0yb 5 20p
0x 1 ρgx 1 μ a 02u
0x2 1 02u
0y2b 
 or 
ρ(0 1 0) 5 0 1 0 1 μa0 1 d2u
dy2b 
 (4.130) 
 Most of the terms drop out, and the momentum equation reduces to simply 
 d2u
dy2 5 0    or    u 5 C1y 1 C2 
 The two constants are found by applying the no-slip condition at the upper and lower 
plates: 
 At y 5 1h: 
 u 5 V 5 C1h 1 C2
 
 At y 5 2h: 
 u 5 0 5 C1(2h) 1 C2 
 or 
C1 5 V
2h    and    C2 5 V
2 
 Therefore the solution for this case ( a ), fl ow between plates with a moving upper 
wall, is 
 
u 5 V
2h y 1 V
2    2h # y # 1h 
 (4.131) 
 This is  Couette fl ow  due to a moving wall: a linear velocity profi le with no slip at 
each wall, as anticipated and sketched in Fig. 4.12 a . Note that the origin has been 
placed in the center of the channel for convenience in case ( b ) which follows. 
  
What we have just presented is a rigorous derivation of the more informally 
 discussed fl ow of Fig. 1.7 (where  y and  h were defi ned differently). 
Flow Due to Pressure Gradient 
between Two Fixed Plates
 
 Case ( b ) is sketched in Fig. 4.12 b . Both plates are fi xed ( V  5    0), but the pressure 
varies in the  x  direction. If  υ  5  w  5    0, the continuity equation leads to the same 
conclusion as case ( a )—namely, that  u  5  u ( y ) only. The  x -momentum equation (4.130) 
changes only because the pressure is variable: 
 
μd2u
dy2 5 0p
0x 
 (4.132) 
 Also, since  υ  5  w  5    0 and gravity is neglected, the  y - and  z -momentum equations 
lead to 
 0p
0y 5 0  and  0p
0z 5 0  or  p 5 p(x) only 
 Thus the pressure gradient in Eq. (4.132) is the total and only gradient: 
 
μ d2u
dy2 5 dp
dx 5 const , 0 
 (4.133) 

4.10  Some Illustrative Incompressible Viscous Flows 263
 Why did we add the fact that  dp / dx  is  constant ? Recall a useful conclusion from the 
theory of separation of variables: If two quantities are equal and one varies only with 
 y  and the other varies only with  x , then they must both equal the same constant. 
Otherwise they would not be independent of each other. 
  
Why did we state that the constant is  negative ? Physically, the pressure must 
decrease in the fl ow direction in order to drive the fl ow against resisting wall shear 
stress. Thus the velocity profi le  u ( y ) must have negative curvature everywhere, as 
anticipated and sketched in Fig. 4.12 b . 
 
The solution to Eq. (4.133) is accomplished by double integration: 
 u 5 1
μ dp
dx y2
2 1 C1y 1 C2 
 The constants are found from the no-slip condition at each wall: 
 At y 5 6h : 
u 5 0    or    C1 5 0    and    C2 5 2dp
dx h2
2μ 
 Thus the solution to case ( b ), fl ow in a channel due to pressure gradient, is 
 
u 5 2dp
dx h2
2μ a1 2 y2
h2b 
 (4.134) 
 The fl ow forms a  Poiseuille  parabola of constant negative curvature. The maximum 
velocity occurs at the centerline  y  5  0:

 (4.135) 
 Other (laminar) fl ow parameters are computed in the following example. 
 EXAMPLE 4.10 
 For case ( b ) in Fig. 4.12 b , fl ow between parallel plates due to the pressure gradient, compute 
( a ) the wall shear stress, ( b ) the stream function, ( c ) the vorticity, ( d  ) the velocity potential, 
and ( e ) the average velocity. 
 Solution 
 All parameters can be computed from the basic solution, Eq. (4.134), by mathematical 
 manipulation. 
 
Part (a) 
 The wall shear follows from the defi nition of a newtonian fl uid, Eq. (4.37):

  Ans. (a) 
 The wall shear has the same magnitude at each wall, but by our sign convention of Fig. 4.3, 
the upper wall has negative shear stress. 

264 Chapter 4 Differential Relations for Fluid Flow 
 
Part (b) 
 Since the fl ow is plane, steady, and incompressible, a stream function exists: 
 u 5
0ψ
0y 5 umaxa1 2 y2
h2b    υ 5 2
0ψ
0x 5 0 
 Integrating and setting  ψ  5  0 at the centerline for convenience, we obtain 
 
ψ 5 umaxay 2 y3
3h2b 
 Ans. (b) 
 At the walls,  y  5  6 h and  ψ 5  6 2 u max h /3, respectively. 
 
Part (c) 
 In plane fl ow, there is only a single nonzero vorticity component: 
 
ζz 5 (curl V)z 5 0υ
0x 2 0u
0y 5 2umax
h2
 y 
 Ans. (c) 
 The vorticity is highest at the wall and is positive (counterclockwise) in the upper half and 
negative (clockwise) in the lower half of the fl uid. Viscous fl ows are typically full of vorticity 
and are not at all irrotational. 
 
Part (d) 
 From part ( c ), the vorticity is fi nite. Therefore the fl ow is not irrotational, and the velocity 
potential  does not exist . 
 Ans.  (d ) 
 
Part (e) 
 The average velocity is defi ned as  V av  5  Q / A , where Q 5 eu dA over the cross section. For 
our particular distribution  u ( y ) from Eq. (4.134), we obtain 
 
Vav 5 1

 Ans. (e) 
 In plane Poiseuille fl ow between parallel plates, the average velocity is two-thirds of the maxi-
mum (or centerline) value. This result could also have been obtained from the stream function 
derived in part ( b ). From Eq. (4.95), 
 Qchannel 5 ψupper 2 ψlower 5 2umaxh

 whence  V av  5  Q / A b 5 1  5  (4 u max h /3)/(2 h )  5  2 u max /3, the same result. 
  
This example illustrates a statement made earlier: Knowledge of the velocity vector  V 
[as in Eq. (4.134)] is essentially the  solution to a fl uid mechanics problem, since all other 
fl ow properties can then be calculated. 
Fully Developed Laminar 
Pipe Flow
 
 Perhaps the most useful exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equation is for incom-
pressible fl ow in a straight circular pipe of radius  R , fi rst studied experimentally by 
G. Hagen in 1839 and J. L. Poiseuille in 1840. By  fully developed  we mean that the 
region studied is far enough from the entrance that the fl ow is purely axial,  υ z  ﬁ  0, 
while  υ r and  υ θ are zero. We neglect gravity and also assume axial symmetry—that 
is,  ∂ / ∂ θ  5    0. The equation of continuity in cylindrical coordinates, Eq. (4.12 b ), 
reduces to 
 0
0z (υz) 5 0    or    υz 5 υz(r)    only 

4.10  Some Illustrative Incompressible Viscous Flows 265
 The fl ow proceeds straight down the pipe without radial motion. The  r -momentum 
equation in cylindrical coordinates, Eq. (D.5), simplifi es to  ∂ p /∂ r  5  0, or  p  5  p ( z ) 
only. The  z -momentum equation in cylindrical coordinates, Eq. (D.7), reduces to 
 ρυz
0υz
0z  52dp
dz 1 μ§2υz 5 2dp
dz 1 μ
r  d
dr ar dυz
dr b 
 The convective acceleration term on the left vanishes because of the previously given 
continuity equation. Thus the momentum equation may be rearranged as follows: 
 
μ
r  d
dr ar dυz
dr b 5 dp
dz 5 const , 0 
 (4.136) 
 This is exactly the situation that occurred for fl ow between fl at plates in Eq. (4.132). 
Again the “separation” constant is negative, and pipe fl ow will look much like the 
plate fl ow in Fig. 4.12 b . 
 
Equation (4.136) is linear and may be integrated twice, with the result 
 υz 5 dp
dz r2
4μ 1 C1 ln(r) 1 C2 
 where  C 1  and  C 2  are constants. The boundary conditions are no slip at the wall and 
fi nite velocity at the centerline: 
 No slip at r 5 R: υz 5 0 5 dp
dz R2
4μ 1 C1 ln(R) 1 C2 
 Finite velocity at r 5 0: υz 5 finite 5 0 1 C1 ln(0) 1 C2 
 To avoid a logarithmic singularity, the centerline condition requires that  C 1  5  0. Then, 
from no slip,  C 2  5  ( 2 dp / dz )( R 2 /4 μ ). The fi nal, and famous, solution for fully devel-
oped  Hagen-Poiseuille fl ow is 
 
υz 5 a2dp

4μ (R2 2 r2)  
 (4.137) 
 The velocity profi le is a paraboloid with a maximum at the centerline. Just as in 
Example 4.10, knowledge of the velocity distribution enables other parameters to be 
calculated:

 Note that we have substituted the equality (2dp/dz) 5 Dp/L, where Δp is the pressure 
drop along the entire length  L of the pipe. 
  
These formulas are valid as long as the fl ow is  laminar —that is, when the dimen-
sionless Reynolds number of the fl ow, Re D  5  ρ V avg (2 R )/ μ , is less than about 2100. 
Note also that the formulas do not depend on density, the reason being that the con-
vective acceleration of this fl ow is zero. 
 EXAMPLE 4.11 
 SAE 10W oil at 20 8 C fl ows at 1.1 m 3 /h through a horizontal pipe with  d  5  2 cm and  L  5

( d ) the power required. 
 Solution 
 •  Assumptions: Laminar, steady, Hagen-Poiseuille pipe fl ow. 
 •  Approach:  The formulas of Eqs. (4.138) are appropriate for this problem. Note that  R   5 
 0.01 m. 
 •  Property values:  From Table A.3 for SAE 10W oil,  ρ  5  870 kg/m 3  and  μ  5  0.104 kg/(m-s). 
 •  Solution steps:  The average velocity follows easily from the fl ow rate and the pipe area:

 Ans. (b) 
 This is less than the “transition” value of 2100; so the fl ow is indeed  laminar , and the 
 formulas are valid. The pressure drop is computed from the third of Eqs. (4.138):

 When using SI units, the answer returns in pascals; no conversion factors are needed.  Finally, 
the power required is the product of fl ow rate and pressure drop:

 •  Comments: Pipe fl ow problems are straightforward algebraic exercises if the data are 
compatible. Note again that SI units can be used in the formulas without conversion 
 factors. 
Flow between Long Concentric 
Cylinders
 
 Consider a fl uid of constant ( ρ ,  μ ) between two concentric cylinders, as in Fig. 4.13. 
There is no axial motion or end effect  υ z  5  ∂ / ∂ z  5    0. Let the inner cylinder rotate 
at angular velocity  V i . Let the outer cylinder be fi xed. There is circular symmetry, so 
the velocity does not vary with  θ and varies only with  r . 

4.10  Some Illustrative Incompressible Viscous Flows 267
 
The continuity equation for this problem is Eq. (4.12 b ) with  υ z  5  0:

r 0
0r (rυr) 1 1
r 0υθ
0θ 5 0 5 1
r d
dr (rυr)  or  rυr 5 const 
 Note that  υ θ  does not vary with  θ . Since  υ r 5  0 at both the inner and outer cylinders, 
it follows that  υ r 5  0 everywhere and the motion can only be purely circumferential, 
 υ θ 5  υ θ ( r ). The  θ -momentum equation (D.6) becomes

 This is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation with the solution

Instability of Rotating Inner15 
Cylinder Flow
 
 The classic  Couette fl ow solution 16  of Eq. (4.140) describes a physically satisfying 
concave, two-dimensional, laminar fl ow velocity profi le as in Fig. 4.13. The solution 
is mathematically exact for an incompressible fl uid. However, it becomes unstable at 
a relatively low rate of rotation of the inner cylinder, as shown in 1923 in a classic 
paper by G. I. Taylor [17]. At a critical value of what is now called the dimensionless 
 Taylor number, denoted Ta,

 (4.141)  
 the plane fl ow of Fig. 4.13 vanishes and is replaced by a laminar  three-dimensional 
fl ow pattern consisting of rows of nearly square alternating toroidal vortices. 
 15 This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

method, still used today, for measuring the viscosity of fl uids.

An  experimental demonstration of toroidal “Taylor vortices” is shown in Fig. 4.14 a , 
measured at Ta    <  1.16 Ta crit  by Koschmieder [18]. At higher Taylor numbers, the 
vortices also develop a circumferential periodicity but are still laminar, as illustrated 
in Fig. 4.14 b . At still higher Ta, turbulence ensues. This interesting instability reminds 
us that the Navier-Stokes equations, being nonlinear, do admit to multiple (nonunique) 
laminar solutions in addition to the usual instabilities associated with turbulence and 
chaotic dynamic systems. 
 Summary
 
    This chapter complements Chap. 3 by using an infi nitesimal control volume to derive 
the basic partial differential equations of mass, momentum, and energy for a fl uid. 
These equations, together with thermodynamic state relations for the fl uid and appro-
priate boundary conditions, in principle can be solved for the complete fl ow fi eld in 
any given fl uid mechanics problem. Except for Chap. 9, in most of the problems to 
be studied here an incompressible fl uid with constant viscosity is assumed. 
  
In addition to deriving the basic equations of mass, momentum, and energy, this 
chapter introduced some supplementary ideas—the stream function, vorticity, irrota-
tionality, and the velocity potential—which will be useful in coming chapters, espe-
cially Chap. 8. Temperature and density variations will be neglected except in Chap. 9, 
where compressibility is studied. 
  
This chapter ended by discussing a few classic solutions for laminar viscous fl ows 
(Couette fl ow due to moving walls, Poiseuille duct fl ow due to pressure gradient, and 
fl ow between rotating cylinders). Whole books [4, 5, 9–11, 15] discuss classic 
approaches to fl uid mechanics, and other texts [6, 12–14] extend these studies to the 
realm of continuum mechanics. This does not mean that all problems can be solved 
analytically. The new fi eld of computational fl uid dynamics [1] shows great promise 
of achieving approximate solutions to a wide variety of fl ow problems. In addition, 
when the geometry and boundary conditions are truly complex, experimentation 
(Chap. 5) is a preferred alternative.

 Dimensional  Analysis 
 and  Similarity 
 Motivation.     In this chapter we discuss the planning, presentation, and interpretation 
of exper  i  mental data. We shall try to convince you that such data are best presented 
in  dimensionless   form. Experiments that might result in tables of output, or even 
multiple volumes of tables, might be r  e  duced to a single set of curves—or even a 
single curve—when suitably nondimensionalized. The technique for doing this is  
 dimensional  analysis.  It is also effective in theoretical studies. 
   
Chapter 3 presented large-scale control volume balances of mass, momentum, and 
energy, which led to global results: mass fl ow, force, torque, total work done, or heat 
transfer. Chapter 4 presented infi nitesimal balances that led to the basic partial dif-
ferential equations of fl uid fl ow and some particular solutions for both inviscid and 
viscous (laminar) fl ow. These straight   analytical   techniques are limited to simple 
geometries and uniform boundary conditions. Only a fraction of engineering fl ow 
problems can be solved by direct analytical formulas.  
 
Most practical fl uid fl ow problems are too complex, both geometrically and physi-
cally, to be solved analytically. They must be tested by experiment or approximated 
by computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) [2]. These results are typically reported as 
experimental or numerical data points and smoothed curves. Such data have much 
more generality if they are expressed in compact, economic form. This is the motiva-
tion for dimensional analysis. The technique is a mainstay of fl uid mechanics and is 
also widely used in all engineering fi elds plus the physical, biological, medical, and 
social sciences. The present chapter shows how dimensional analysis improves the 
presentation of both data and theory.  
  5.1  Introduction 
 
Basically, dimensional analysis is a method for reducing the number and complexity of 
experimental variables that affect a given physical phenomenon, by using a sort of com-
pacting technique. If a phenomenon depends on   n  dimensional variables, dimensional 
analysis will reduce the problem to only   k  dimensionless  variables, where the reduction

 n  2  k   5     1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the problem complexity. Generally   n   2  k  equals 
 the  number  of  different  dimensions (sometimes called basic or primary or fundamental 
dimensions) that govern the problem. In fl uid mechanics, the four basic dimensions are 
usually taken to be mass   M , length  L , time  T , and temperature Q , or an  MLT Q system 
for short. Alternatively, one uses an  FLT Q system, with force  F  replacing mass.  
   
Although its purpose is to reduce variables and group them in dimensionless form, 
dime n  sional analysis has several side benefi ts. The fi rst is enormous savings in time 
and money. Suppose one knew that the force   F   on a particular body shape immersed 
in a stream of fl uid depended only on the body length   L , stream velocity  V , fl uid 
density  ρ , and fl uid viscosity  μ ; that is, 
 
F 5 f(L, V, ρ, μ) 
(5.1)
  Suppose further that the geometry and fl ow conditions are so complicated that our inte-
gral theories (Chap. 3) and differential equations (Chap. 4) fail to yield the solution for 
the force. Then we must fi nd the function  f ( L ,  V ,  ρ ,  μ ) experimentally or numerically.  
 
Generally speaking, it takes about 10 points to defi ne a curve. To fi nd the effect of body 
length in Eq. (5.1), we have to run the experiment for 10 lengths   L . For each  L  we need 
10 values of   V  , 10 values of   ρ  , and 10 values of   μ  , making a grand total of 10  4 , or 10,000, 
experiments. At $100 per experiment—well, you see what we are getting into. However, 
with dimensional analysis, we can immediately reduce Eq. (5.1) to the equivalent form  
 
 F
ρV 2L2 5 g aρVL
μ b 
(5.2)
 or 
 
 CF 5 g(Re)
 
  That is, the dimensionless   force  coeffi cient  F /( ρ V 2 L 2  ) is a function only of the dimen-
sionless  Rey n olds  number  ρ VL / μ  . We shall learn exactly how to make this reduction 
in Secs. 5.2 and 5.3. Equation (5.2) will be useful in Chap. 7.  
 
Note that Eq. (5.2) is just an  example,  not the full story, of forces caused by fl uid 
fl ows. Some fl uid forces have a very weak or negligible Reynolds number dependence 
in wide regions (Fig. 5.3  a  ). Other groups may also be important. The force coeffi cient 
may depend, in high-speed gas fl ow, on the   Mach  number , Ma  5  V/a , where  a  is the 
speed of sound. In free-surface fl ows, such as ship drag,   C F   may depend upon   Froude  
 number , Fr  5  V 2 /( gL ), where  g   is the acceleration of gravity. In turbulent fl ow, force may 
depend upon the  roughness  ratio ,   / L , where    is the roughness height of the surface.  
 
The function  g   is different mathematically from the original function   f  , but it con-
tains all the same information. Nothing is lost in a dimensional analysis. And think 
of the savings: We can e s tablish  g   by running the experiment for only 10 values of 
the single variable called the Reynolds number. We do not have to vary   L ,  V ,  ρ , or 
 μ   separately but only the   grouping  ρ VL / μ  . This we do merely by varying velocity   V 
  in, say, a wind tunnel or drop test or water channel, and there is no need to build 10 
different bodies or fi nd 100 different fl uids with 10 densities and 10 viscosities. The 
cost is now about $1000, maybe less.  
 
A second side benefi t of dimensional analysis is that it helps our thinking and plan-
ning for an experiment or theory. It suggests dimensionless ways of writing equations 
before we spend money on computer analysis to fi nd solutions. It suggests variables 
that can be discarded; sometimes d  i  mensional analysis will immediately reject 

5.1  Introduction 287
variables, and at other times it groups them off to the side, where a few simple tests 
will show them to be unimportant. Finally, dimensional analysis will often give a great 
deal of insight into the form of the physical relationship we are trying to study.  
 
A third benefi t is that dimensional analysis provides   scaling  laws  that can convert 
data from a cheap, small   model   to design information for an expensive, large   proto-
type  . We do not build a mi  l  lion-dollar airplane and see whether it has enough lift 
force. We measure the lift on a small model and use a scaling law to predict the lift 
on the full-scale prototype airplane. There are rules we shall explain for fi nding scal-
ing laws. When the scaling law is valid, we say that a condition of   similarity  exists 
between the model and the prototype. In the simple case of Eq. (5.1), similarity is 
achieved if the Reynolds number is the same for the model and prototype because 
the function   g  then requires the force coeffi cient to be the same also:

measure the model force at the model Reynolds number, the prototype force at the 
same Reynolds number equals the model force times the density ratio times the veloc-
ity ratio squared times the length ratio squared. We shall give more examples later.  
 
Do you understand these introductory explanations? Be careful; learning dimensional 
ana  l  ysis is like learning to play tennis: There are levels of the game. We can establish 
some ground rules and do some fairly good work in this brief chapter, but dimensional 
analysis in the broad view has many subtleties and nuances that only time, practice, and 
maturity enable you to master. Although dimensional analysis has a fi rm physical and 
mathematical foundation, considerable art and skill are needed to use it effectively.  
 EXAMPLE  5.1 
  A copepod is a water crustacean approximately 1 mm in diameter. We want to know the 
drag force on the copepod when it moves slowly in fresh water. A scale model 100 times 
larger is made and tested in glycerin at   V  5     30 cm/s. The measured drag on the model is 
1.3 N. For similar conditions, what are the velocity and drag of the actual copepod in water? 
Assume that Eq. (5.2) applies and the temperature is 20 8 C. 
 Solution 
 •  Property  values:  From Table A.3, the densities and viscosities at 20  8 C are 
 Water (prototype):

 Glycerin (model): 
 μ m   5 1.5 kg/(m-s)      
ρ m   5 1263 kg/m  3 
 •  Assumptions:  Equation (5.2) is appropriate and  similarity   is achieved; that is, the model 
and prototype have the same Reynolds number and, therefore, the same force coeffi cient.

 •  Comments:     Assuming we modeled the Reynolds number correctly, the model test is a very 
good idea, as it would obviously be diffi cult to measure such a tiny copepod drag force.  
 
Historically, the fi rst person to write extensively about units and dimensional rea-
soning in physical relations was Euler in 1765. Euler’s ideas were far ahead of his 
time, as were those of Joseph Fourier, whose 1822 book   Analytical  Theory  of  Heat 
 outlined what is now called the  principle  of  dimensional  homogeneity  and even devel-
oped some similarity rules for heat fl ow. There were no further signifi cant advances 
until Lord Rayleigh’s book in 1877,   Theory  of  Sound,   which proposed a “method of 
dimensions” and gave several examples of dimensional analysis. The fi nal break-
through that established the method as we know it today is generally credited to E. 
Buckingham in 1914 [1], whose paper outlined what is now called the   Buckingham 
 Pi  Theorem   for describing dimensionless parameters (see Sec. 5.3). However, it is 
now known that a Frenchman, A. Vaschy, in 1892 and a Russian, D. Riabouchinsky, 
in 1911 had independently published papers reporting results equiv a lent to the pi 
theorem. Following Buckingham’s paper, P. W. Bridgman published a classic book 
in 1922 [3], outlining the general theory of dimensional analysis.  
   
Dimensional analysis is so valuable and subtle, with both skill and art involved, that 
it has spawned a wide variety of textbooks and treatises. The writer is aware of more 
than 30 books on the subject, of which his engineering favorites are listed here [3–10]. 
Dimensional analysis is not co  n  fi ned to fl uid mechanics, or even to engineering. 
 Specialized books have been published on the application of dimensional analysis to 
metrology [11], astrophysics [12], economics [13], chemistry [14], hydrology [15], medi-
cations [16], clinical medicine [17], chemical processing pilot plants [18], social sciences 
[19], biomedical sciences [20], pharmacy [21], fractal geometry [22], and even the 
growth of plants [23]. Clearly this is a subject well worth learning for many career paths.  
 5.2  The  Principle  of 
 Dimensional  Homogeneity 
 
  In making the remarkable jump from the fi ve-variable Eq. (5.1) to the two-variable 
Eq. (5.2), we were exploiting a rule that is almost a self-evident axiom in physics. This 
rule, the  principle  of  dimensional  homogeneity  (PDH), can be stated as follows:  

5.2  The Principle of Dimensional Homogeneity 289
  If an equation truly expresses a proper relationship between variables in a physical process, 
it will be   dimensionally  homogeneous;   that is, each of its additive terms will have the same 
dimensions.  
 All the equations that are derived from the theory of mechanics are of this form. For 
example, co  n sider the relation that expresses the displacement of a falling body: 
 
S 5 S0 1 V0t 1 1
2gt2 
(5.5)
  Each term in this equation is a displacement, or length, and has dimensions {  L }. The 
equation is dimensionally homogeneous. Note also that any consistent set of units can 
be used to calculate a result.  
 
Consider Bernoulli’s equation for incompressible fl ow: 
 
p
ρ 1 1
2V2 1 gz 5 const 
(5.6)
  Each term, including the constant, has dimensions of velocity squared, or {  L 2 T 2 2 }. 
The equation is dimensionally homogeneous and gives proper results for any consis-
tent set of units.  
   
Students count on dimensional homogeneity and use it to check themselves when 
they cannot quite remember an equation during an exam. For example, which is it:  
 
S 5 1
2gt2?   or   S 5 1
2g2t? 
(5.7)
  By checking the dimensions, we reject the second form and back up our faulty mem-
ory. We are exploiting the principle of dimensional homogeneity, and this chapter 
simply exploits it further.  
  Variables  and  Constants 
 
Equations (5.5) and (5.6) also illustrate some other factors that often enter into a 
dimensional analysis:  
 Dimensional  variables  are the quantities that actually vary during a given case 
and would be plotted against each other to show the data. In Eq. (5.5), they 
are  S  and  t ;  in Eq. (5.6) they are  p ,  V , and  z . All have dimensions, and all 
can be nondimensionalized as a dimensional analysis technique.  
 Dimensional  constants  may vary from case to case but are held constant during 
a given run. In Eq. (5.5) they are  S 0 ,  V 0 , and  g , and in Eq. (5.6) they are  ρ ,  g , 
and  C . They all have dimensions and conceivably could be nondimensional-
ized, but they are normally used to help nondimensionalize the variables in 
the problem.  
 Pure  constants  have no dimensions and never did. They arise from mathematical 
manipulations. In both Eqs. (5.5) and (5.6) they are   1
2 and the exponent 2, 
both of which came from an integration:   et dt 5 1
2t2, eV dV 5 1
2V2. Other 
common dimensionless constants are   π  and  e . Also, the argument of any 
mathematical function, such as ln, exp, cos, or J  0 , is dimensionless. 
 Angles  and  revolutions  are dimensionless. The preferred unit for an angle is the 
radian, which makes it clear that an angle is a ratio. In like manner, a revolu-
tion is 2 π  radians. 

290 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
 Counting  numbers  are dimensionless. For example, if we triple the energy  E  to 
3 E , the coeffi cient 3 is dimensionless. 
   
Note that integration and differentiation of an equation may change the dimen-
sions but not the homogeneity of the equation. For example, integrate or differenti-
ate Eq. (5.5):  
 
# S dt 5 S0t 1 1
2V0t2 1 1
6gt3 
(5.8a)
 
dS
dt 5 V0 1 gt 
(5.8b)
  In the integrated form (5.8  a  ) every term has dimensions of {  LT }, while in the deriva-
tive form (5.8  b ) every term is a velocity { LT 2 1 }. 
   
Finally, some physical variables are naturally dimensionless by virtue of their defi -
nition as ratios of dimensional quantities. Some examples are strain (change in length 
per unit length), Poisson’s ratio (ratio of transverse strain to longitudinal strain), and 
specifi c gravity (ratio of density to standard water density). 
   
The motive behind dimensional analysis is that any dimensionally homogeneous 
equation can be written in an entirely equivalent nondimensional form that is more 
compact. Usually there are multiple methods of presenting one’s dimensionless data 
or theory. Let us illustrate these concepts more thoroughly by using the falling-body 
relation (5.5) as an example.  
 Ambiguity:  The  Choice  of 
 Variables  and  Scaling  Parameters 1 
 
  Equation (5.5) is familiar and simple, yet it illustrates most of the concepts of dimen-
sional analysis. It contains fi ve terms (  S ,  S 0 ,  V 0 ,  t ,  g  ), which we may divide, in our 
thinking, into variables and p a rameters. The  variables   are the things we wish to plot, 
the basic output of the experiment or theory: in this case,   S  versus  t . The  parameters 
  are those quantities whose effect on the variables we wish to know: in this case   S 0 , 
 V 0 , and  g . Almost any engineering study can be subdivided in this manner. 
   
To nondimensionalize our results, we need to know how many dimensions are 
contained among our variables and parameters: in this case, only two, length {  L } and 
time {  T }. Check each term to verify this: 
5S6 5 5S06 5 5L6    5t6 5 5T6    5V06 5 5LT 216    5g6 5 5LT
 226
 Among our parameters, we therefore select two to be  scaling  parameters  (also called 
 repeating  variables  ), used to defi ne dimensionless variables. What remains will be 
the “basic” parameter(s) whose effect we wish to show in our plot. These choices will 
not affect the content of our data, only the form of their presentation. Clearly there 
is ambiguity in these choices, something that often vexes the beginning experimenter. 
But the ambiguity is deliberate. Its purpose is to show a particular effect, and the 
choice is yours to make.  
 
For the falling-body problem, we select any two of the three parameters to be scal-
ing p  a  rameters. Thus, we have three options. Let us discuss and display them in turn.  
1I am indebted to Prof. Jacques Lewalle of Syracuse University for suggesting, outlining, and clari-
fying this entire discussion.

5.2  The Principle of Dimensional Homogeneity 291
 Option  1:  Scaling parameters  S 0 and  V 0 : the effect of gravity  g . 
   
First use the scaling parameters (  S 0 ,  V 0 ) to defi ne dimensionless (*) displacement 
and time. There is only one suitable defi nition for each: 2 
 
S* 5 S
S0     t* 5 V0t
S0
 
(5.9)
 Substitute these variables into Eq. (5.5) and clean everything up until each term is 
dimensionless. The result is our fi rst option: 
 
S* 5 1 1 t* 1 1
2αt*2    α 5 gS0
V2
0
  
(5.10)
  This result is shown plotted in Fig. 5.1  a  . There is a single dimensionless parameter  
 α  , which shows here the effect of gravity. It cannot show the direct effects of   S 0 and 
 V 0  , since these two are hidden in the ordinate and abscissa. We see that gravity 
increases the parabolic rate of fall for   t *  .     0, but not the initial slope at   t *  5  0. We 
would learn the same from falling-body data, and the plot, within experimental accu-
racy, would look like Fig. 5.1  a . 
 Option  2:  Scaling parameters  V 0 and  g : the effect of initial displacement  S 0 . 
   
Now use the new scaling parameters (  V 0 ,  g ) to defi ne dimensionless (**) displace-
ment and time. Again there is only one suitable defi nition: 
 
S** 5 Sg
V0
2    t** 5 t g
V0
 
(5.11)
  Substitute these variables into Eq. (5.5) and clean everything up again. The result is 
our second option:  
 
S** 5 α 1 t** 1 1
2 t**2    α 5 gS0
V2
0
 
(5.12)
 This result is plotted in Fig. 5.1 b . The same single parameter  α  again appears and 
here shows the effect of initial   displacement,   which merely moves the curves upward 
without changing their shape.  
 Option  3:  Scaling parameters  S 0 and  g : the effect of initial speed  V 0 . 
   
Finally use the scaling parameters (  S 0 ,  g ) to defi ne dimensionless (***) displace-
ment and time. Again there is only one suitable defi nition: 
 
S*** 5 S
S0    t*** 5 t a g
S0
b
1/2
  
(5.13)
  Substitute these variables into Eq. (5.5) and clean everything up as usual. The result 
is our third and fi nal option: 
 
S*** 5 1 1 βt*** 1 1
2 t***2    β 5
1
1α 5
V0
1gS0
 
(5.14)
2Make them proportional to S and t. Do not defi ne dimensionless terms upside down: S0/S or S0/(V0t). 
The plots will look funny, users of your data will be confused, and your supervisor will be angry. It is 
not a good idea.

292 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
 This fi nal presentation is shown in Fig. 5.1  c  . Once again the parameter   α  appears, 
but we have redefi ned it upside down,  β 5 1/1α, so that our display parameter  V 0 
is in the numerator and is linear. This is our free choice and simply improves the 
display. Figure 5.1  c  shows that initial  velocity  increases the falling displacement. 
   
Note that, in all three options, the same parameter   α   appears but has a different mean-
ing: dimensionless gravity, initial displacement, and initial velocity. The graphs, which 
contain exactly the same information, change their appearance to refl ect these differences.  
   
Whereas the original problem, Eq. (5.5), involved fi ve quantities, the dimensionless 
presentations involve only three, having the form

dimensionless presentations of the

information.

5.2  The Principle of Dimensional Homogeneity 293
 The reduction 5  2  3  5     2 should equal the number of fundamental dimensions 
involved in the problem {  L ,  T }. This idea led to the pi theorem (Sec. 5.3). 
  Selection  of  Scaling  (Repeating) 
 Variables 
 
The selection of scaling variables is left to the user, but there are some guidelines. In 
Eq. (5.2), it is now clear that the scaling variables were   ρ ,  V , and  L  , since they appear in 
both force coeffi cient and Reynolds number. We could then interpret data from Eq. (5.2) 
as the variation of dimensionless   force  versus dimensionless  viscosity,   since each appears 
in only one dimensionless group. Sim  i  larly, in Eq. (5.5) the scaling variables were selected 
from ( S 0 ,  V 0 ,  g ), not ( S ,  t ), because we wished to plot  S  versus  t  in the fi nal result.  
 
The following are some guidelines for selecting scaling variables: 
 1. They must  not   form a dimensionless group among themselves, but adding one 
more variable   will   form a dimensionless quantity. For example, test powers of   ρ , 
 V , and  L : 
ρaV
 bLc 5 (ML23)a(L/T)b(L)
 c 5 M
 0L
 0T
 0 only if a 5 0, b 5 0, c 5 0
 
In this case, we can see why this is so: Only  ρ  contains the dimension { M }, 
and only  V  co n tains the dimension { T }, so no cancellation is possible. If, now, 
we add  μ  to the scaling group, we will obtain the Reynolds number. If we add 
 F  to the group, we form the force coeffi cient. 
 2. Do not select output variables for your scaling parameters. In Eq. (5.1), certainly 
do not select  F , which you wish to isolate for your plot. Nor was  μ  selected, 
for we wished to plot force versus viscosity.  
 3. If convenient, select  popular,  not obscure, scaling variables because they will ap pear 
in all of your dimensionless groups. Select density, not surface tension. Select body 
length, not surface roughness. Select stream velocity, not speed of sound.  
 The examples that follow will make this clear. Problem assignments might give hints. 
   
Suppose we wish to study drag force versus   velocity  . Then we would not use   V  as 
a scaling parameter in Eq. (5.1). We would use (  ρ ,  μ ,  L  ) instead, and the fi nal dimen-
sionless function would become  
 
CF¿ 5 ρF
μ2 5 f(Re)    Re 5 ρVL
μ  
(5.16)
  In plotting these data, we would not be able to discern the effect of   ρ  or  μ , since they 
appear in both dimensionless groups. The grouping   C 9F again would mean dimension-
less force, and Re is now interpreted as either dimensionless velocity or size.  3 The 
plot would be quite different compared to Eq. (5.2), although it contains exactly the 
same information. The development of parameters such as  C 9F   and Re from the initial 
variables is the subject of the pi theorem (Sec. 5.3).  
  Some  Peculiar  Engineering 
 Equations 
 
The foundation of the dimensional analysis method rests on two assumptions: (1) The 
proposed physical relation is dimensionally homogeneous, and (2) all the relevant 
variables have been i n cluded in the proposed relation. 
   
If a relevant variable is missing, dimensional analysis will fail, giving either alge-
braic diffi cu  l  ties or, worse, yielding a dimensionless formulation that does not resolve 
3We were lucky to achieve a size effect because in this case L, a scaling parameter, did not appear 
in the drag coeffi cient.

294 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
the process. A typical case is Manning’s open-channel formula, discussed in Example 1.4 
and Chap. 10.  
 
V 5 1.49
n R2/3S1/2 
(1)
 Since  V  is velocity,  R   is a radius, and   n  and  S   are dimensionless, the formula is not 
dimensionally homogeneous. This should be a warning that (1) the formula changes 
if the   units  of  V  and  R   change and (2) if valid, it represents a very special case. Equa-
tion (1) in Example 1.4 predates the dime  n  sional analysis technique and is valid only 
for water in rough channels at moderate velocities and large radii in BG units.  
   
Such dimensionally inhomogeneous formulas abound in the hydraulics literature. 
Another example is the Hazen-Williams formula [24] for volume fl ow of water 
through a straight smooth pipe:  
 
Q 5 61.9D2.63 adp
dxb
0.54
 
(5.17)
 where  D  is diameter and  dp / dx   is the pressure gradient. Some of these formulas arise 
because numbers have been inserted for fl uid properties and other physical data into 
perfectly legitimate homogeneous formulas. We shall not give the units of Eq. (5.17) 
to avoid encouraging its use.  
   
On the other hand, some formulas are “constructs” that cannot be made dimension-
ally h  o  mogeneous. The “variables” they relate cannot be analyzed by the dimensional 
analysis technique. Most of these formulas are raw empiricisms convenient to a small 
group of specialists. Here are three examples:

 R  . Equation (5.19) relates the specifi c gravity   S   of an oil to its density in degrees 
API. Equation (5.20) relates the vi  s  cosity of a liquid in   D E  , or degrees Engler, to 
its viscosity   t R   in Saybolt seconds. Such formulas have a certain usefulness when 
communicated between fellow specialists, but we cannot handle them here. Vari-
ables like Brinell hardness and Saybolt viscosity are not suited to an   MLT Q dimen-
sional system.  
  5.3  The  Pi  Theorem 
 
There are several methods of reducing a number of dimensional variables into a smaller 
number of dimensionless groups. The fi rst scheme given here was proposed in 1914 by 
Buckingham [1] and is now called the   Buckingham  Pi  Theorem . The name  pi  comes from 
the mathematical notation   P  , meaning a product of variables. The dimensionless groups 
found from the theorem are power products denoted by   P 1 ,  P 2 ,  P 3  , etc. The method 
allows the pi groups to be found in sequential order without resorting to free exponents. 

5.3  The Pi Theorem 295
 
The fi rst part of the pi theorem explains what reduction in variables to expect: 
  If a physical process satisfi es the PDH and involves   n   dimensional variables, it can be reduced 
to a relation between   k  dimensionless variables or  P s. The reduction  j  5  n  2  k  
  equals the maximum number of variables that do not form a pi among themselves and is 
always less than or equal to the number of dimensions describing the variables. 
 Take the specifi c case of force on an immersed body: Eq. (5.1) contains fi ve variables 
 F ,  L ,  U ,  ρ , and  μ   described by three dimensions {  MLT }. Thus  n  5  5 and  j  #  3. 
Therefore it is a good guess that we can reduce the problem to   k  pi groups, with  k   5 
 n  2  j  $  5  2  3  5     2. And this is exactly what we obtained: two dimensionless  variables  
 P 1  5  C F  and  P 2  5     Re. On rare occasions it may take more pi groups than this mini-
mum (see Example 5.5).  
 
The second part of the theorem shows how to fi nd the pi groups one at a time: 
 Find the reduction  j , then select  j   scaling variables that do not form a pi among themselves.  4 
Each desired pi group will be a power product of these   j   variables plus one additional vari-
able, which is assigned any convenient nonzero exponent. Each pi group thus found is 
independent.  
 To be specifi c, suppose the process involves fi ve variables: 
υ1 5 f(υ2, υ3, υ4, υ5)
  Suppose there are three dimensions {  MLT  } and we search around and fi nd that indeed  
 j  5  3. Then  k  5  5  2  3  5     2 and we expect, from the theorem, two and only two pi 
groups. Pick out three convenient variables that do  not   form a pi, and suppose these 
turn out to be   υ 2 ,  υ 3 , and  υ 4  . Then the two pi groups are formed by power products 
of these three plus one additional variable, either  υ 1 or  υ 5 : 
ß1 5 (υ2)a(υ3)b(υ4)cυ1 5 M0L0T0   ß2 5 (υ2)a(υ3)b(υ4)cυ5 5 M0L0T0
  Here we have arbitrarily chosen   υ 1 and   υ 5  , the added variables, to have unit expo-
nents. Equating exponents of the various dimensions is guaranteed by the theorem to 
give unique values of  a ,  b , and  c   for each pi. And they are independent because only  
 P 1 contains   υ 1 and only   P 2 contains   υ 5  . It is a very neat system once you get used 
to the procedure. We shall illustrate it with several examples.  
 
Typically, six steps are involved: 
 1. List and count the  n   variables involved in the problem. If any important variables 
are missing, dimensional analysis will fail.  
 2. List the dimensions of each variable according to { MLT Q } or { FLT Q }. A list 
is given in Table 5.1.  
 3. Find  j . Initially guess  j  equal to the number of different dimensions present, 
and look for   j  variables that do not form a pi product. If no luck, reduce  j  by 1 
and look again. With practice, you will fi nd  j  rapidly. 
 4. Select  j  scaling parameters that do not form a pi product. Make sure they 
please you and have some generality if possible, because they will then appear 
4Make a clever choice here because all pi groups will contain these j variables in various groupings.

296 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
in every one of your pi groups. Pick density or velocity or length. Do not pick 
surface tension, for example, or you will form six different independent Weber-
number parameters and thoroughly annoy your colleagues.  
 5. Add one additional variable to your  j  repeating variables, and form a power 
product. Alg e braically fi nd the exponents that make the product dimensionless. 
Try to arrange for your output or  dependent  variables (force, pressure drop, 
torque, power) to appear in the numerator, and your plots will look better. Do 
this sequentially, adding one new variable each time, and you will fi nd all  
 n  2  j  5  k  desired pi products. 
 6. Write the fi nal dimensionless function, and check the terms to make sure all pi 
groups are dimensionless.

 EXAMPLE  5.2 
 Repeat the development of Eq. (5.2) from Eq. (5.1), using the pi theorem. 
 Solution 
Step 1 
 Write the function and count variables: 
F 5 f(L, U, ρ, μ)  there are five variables (n 5 5)

{ L } 
{ LT  2 1 } 
{ ML 2 3 } 
{ ML 2 1 T 2 1 } 
 
Step 3 
 Find  j . No variable contains the dimension  Q , and so  j  is less than or equal to 3 ( MLT ). We 
inspect the list and see that   L ,  U , and  ρ   cannot form a pi group because only   ρ  contains 
mass and only   U  contains time. Therefore  j   does equal 3, and   n  2  j  5  5  2  3  5  2  5  k . 
The pi theorem guarantees for this problem that there will be exactly two independent 
 dimensionless groups.  
Step 4 
 Select repeating  j  variables. The group  L ,  U ,  ρ  we found in step 3 will do fi ne. 
Step 5 
 Combine  L ,  U ,  ρ  with one additional variable, in sequence, to fi nd the two pi products. 
   
First add force to fi nd  P 1  . You may select   any   exponent on this additional term as you 
please, to place it in the numerator or denominator to any power. Since   F   is the output, or 
dependent, va  r iable, we select it to appear to the fi rst power in the numerator: 
ß1 5 LaUbρcF 5 (L)a(LT 21)b(ML23)c(MLT22) 5 M0L0T0
 Equate exponents: 
 Length: 
 a  1  b  2  3 c  1  1  5  0 
 Mass: 
 c  1  1  5  0 
 Time: 
 2 b          2 2  5  0 
 We can solve explicitly for

Therefore

Ans.
 This is exactly the right pi group as in Eq. (5.2). By varying the exponent on  F , we could 
have found other equivalent groups such as   UL ρ 1/2 / F 1/2 . 
   
Finally, add viscosity to   L ,  U , and  ρ  to fi nd  P 2  . Select any power you like for viscosity. 
By hindsight and custom, we select the power  2 1 to place it in the denominator: 
ß2 5 LaUbρcμ21 5 La(LT 21)b(ML23)c(ML21T 21)21 5 M0L0T0

 which is exactly Eq. (5.2). 
 EXAMPLE  5.3 
 The power input  P   to a centrifugal pump is a function of the volume fl ow  Q , impeller 
diameter   D , rotational rate  V , and the density ρ  and viscosity μ  of the fl uid: 
 
P 5 f(Q, D, V, ρ, μ)
  Rewrite this as a dimensionless relationship.   Hint:  Use  V ,  ρ , and  D   as repeating variables. 
We will revisit this problem in Chap. 11. 
 Solution 
Step 1 
 Count the variables. There are six (don’t forget the one on the left,  P ). 
Step 2 
List the dimensions of each variable from Table 5.1. Use the { FLT Q } system: 
 P 
 Q 
 D 
 V 
 ρ 
 μ 
 { FLT  2 1 } 
{ L 3 T  2 1 } 
{ L } 
{ T 2 1 } 
{ FT 2 L 2 4 } 
{ FTL 2 2 } 
 
Step 3 
 Find  j  . Lucky us, we were told to use (  V ,  ρ ,  D  ) as repeating variables, so surely   j  5 3, the 
number of dimensions ( FLT )? Check that these three do  not  form a pi group: 
VaρbDc 5 (T 21)a(FT 2L24)b(L)c 5 F0L0T0 only if     a 5 0, b 5 0, c 5 0
 Yes,  j  5 3. This was not as obvious as the scaling group (  L ,  U ,  ρ  ) in Example 5.2, but it 
is true. We now know, from the theorem, that adding one more variable will indeed form 
a pi group. 
 
Step 4a 
 Combine ( V ,  ρ ,  D ) with power  P  to fi nd the fi rst pi group: 
ß1 5 VaρbDcP 5 (T 21)a(FT 2L24)b(L)c(FLT 21) 5 F0L0T0
 Equate exponents: 
 Force:

 Length: 
 2 4 b 1  c 1 1  5 0 
 Time: 
 2 a  1 2 b      21  5 0 
 Solve algebraically to obtain  a  5  2 3,  b  5  2 1, and  c  5  2 5. This fi rst pi group, the output 
dime n sionless variable, is called the  power  coeffi cient  of a pump,  C P :

5.3  The Pi Theorem 299
Step 4b 
 Combine ( V ,  ρ ,  D ) with fl ow rate  Q  to fi nd the second pi group: 
ß2 5 VaρbDcQ 5 (T 21)a(FT 2L24)b(L)c(L3T 21) 5 F0L0T0
 After equating exponents, we now fi nd  a  5  2 1,  b  5 0, and  c  5  2 3. This second pi group 
is called the   fl ow  coeffi cient  of a pump,  C Q :

Step 4c 
 Combine ( V ,  ρ ,  D ) with viscosity  μ  to fi nd the third and last pi group: 
ß3 5 VaρbDcμ 5 (T 21)a(FT 2L24)b(L)c(FTL22) 5 F0L0T0
 This time,  a  5  2 1,  b  5  2 1, and  c  5  2 2; or  P 3  5  μ /( ρ V D 2 ), a sort of Reynolds number.

 Comment:     These three are the classical coeffi cients used to correlate pump power in

 EXAMPLE  5.4 
  At low velocities (laminar fl ow), the volume fl ow  Q   through a small-bore tube is a function 
only of the tube radius   R , the fl uid viscosity   μ  , and the pressure drop per unit tube length

 Solution 
 Write the given relation and count variables:

 { L 3 T 2 1 } 
{ L } 
{ ML 2 1 T  2 1 } 
{ ML 2 2 T        2 2 } 
  There are three primary dimensions (  M ,  L ,  T  ), hence  j  #     3. By trial and error we determine 
that  R ,  μ , and  dp / dx   cannot be combined into a pi group. Then   j  5  3, and  n  2  j  5  4  2  3  5  1.

Since there is only one pi group, it must equal a dimensionless constant. This is as far as 
dimensional analysis can take us. The laminar fl ow theory of Sec. 4.10 shows that the value 
of the constant is 2π

 EXAMPLE  5.5 
  Assume that the tip defl ection  δ   of a cantilever beam is a function of the tip load   P , beam 
length   L , area moment of inertia  I , and material modulus of elasticity  E ;  that is,  δ  5  f ( P , 
 L ,  I ,  E  ). Rewrite this function in dimensionless form, and comment on its complexity and   
the peculiar value of  j .

 There are fi ve variables (  n  5     5) and three primary dimensions (  M ,  L ,  T  ), hence  j  #  3. But 
try as we may, we  cannot  fi nd any combination of three variables that does not form a pi 
group. This is b e cause { M } and { T  } occur only in   P  and  E   and only in the same form, 
{ MT 2 2  }. Thus we have e  n  countered a special case of   j  5     2, which is less than the number 
of dimensions (  M ,  L ,  T  ). To gain more insight into this peculiarity, you should rework the 
problem, using the (  F ,  L ,  T ) system of d i mensions. You will fi nd that only {  F } and { L } 
occur in these variables, hence  j  5 2. 
 
With j 5 2, we select L and E as two variables that cannot form a pi group and then 
add other variables to form the three desired pis:
ß1 5 LaEbI1 5 (L)a(ML21T 22)b(L4) 5 M0L0T0
from which, after equating exponents, we fi nd that a 5 24, b 5 0, or P1 5 I/L4. Then
ß2 5 LaEbP1 5 (L)a(ML21T 22)b(MLT22) 5 M0L0T0
from which we fi nd a 5 22, b 5 21, or P2 5 P/(EL2), and
ß3 5 LaEbδ1 5 (L)a(ML21T 22)b(L) 5 M0L0T0

5.3  The Pi Theorem 301

Ans. (1)
This is a complex three-variable function, but dimensional analysis alone can take us no 
further.
Comments: We can “improve” Eq. (1) by taking advantage of some physical reasoning, 
as Langhaar points out [4, p. 91]. For small elastic defl ections, δ is proportional to load P 
and inversely proportional to moment of inertia I. Since P and I occur separately in Eq. (1), 
this means that P3 must be proportional to P2 and inversely proportional to P1. Thus, for 
these conditions,

or

This could not be predicted by a pure dimensional analysis. Strength-of-materials theory 
predicts that the value of the constant is 1

  An  Alternate  Step-by-Step  Method 
 by  Ipsen   (1960) 5 
 
The pi theorem method, just explained and illustrated, is often called the   repeating 
 variable  method   of dimensional analysis. Select the repeating variables, add one more, 
and you get a pi group. The writer likes it. This method is straightforward and sys-
tematically reveals all the desired pi groups. However, there are drawbacks: (1) All 
pi groups contain the same repeating variables and might lack variety or effectiveness, 
and (2) one must (sometimes laboriously) check that the selected repeating variables 
do  not  form a pi group among themselves (see Prob. P5.21). 
   
Ipsen [5] suggests an entirely different procedure, a step-by-step method that 
obtains all of the pi groups at once, without any counting or checking. One simply 
successively eliminates each dimension in the desired function by division or multi-
plication. Let us illustrate with the same cla  s  sical drag function proposed in Eq. (5.1). 
Underneath the variables, write out the dimensions of each quantity.

There are three dimensions, {  MLT  }. Eliminate them successively by division or 
multiplication by a variable. Start with mass {  M  }. Pick a variable that contains mass 
and divide it into all the other variables with mass dimensions. We select   ρ , divide, 
and rewrite the function (5.1):

302 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
 We did not divide into   L  or  V  , which do not contain {  M }. Equation (5.1 a ) at fi rst looks 
strange, but it contains fi ve distinct variables and the same information as Eq. (5.1).  
 
We see that  ρ   is no longer important  . Thus   discard  ρ  , and now there are only four 
variables. Next, eliminate time {  T  } by dividing the time-containing va  r  iables by suit-
able powers of, say,   V . The result is 
 
F
ρV2 5 fcn aL, 
V,

Now we see that   V   is no longer relevant. Finally, eliminate {  L } through division 
by, say, a  p propriate powers of  L  itself: 
 
F
ρV2L2 5 fcn aL, 
μ
ρVLb

Now  L  by itself is no longer relevant, and so discard it also. The result is equivalent 
to Eq. (5.2): 
 
F
ρV2L2 5 fcn a μ
ρVLb 
(5.2)
  In Ipsen’s step-by-step method, we fi nd the force coeffi cient is a function solely of 
the Reynolds number. We did no counting and did not fi nd  j  . We just successively 
eliminated each primary dimension by division with the appropriate variables.  
   
Recall Example 5.5, where we discovered, awkwardly, that the number of repeating 
variables was   less   than the number of primary dimensions. Ipsen’s method avoids this 
preliminary check. Recall the beam-defl ection problem proposed in Example 5.5 and 
the various dimensions:  
δ 5 f(P, 
L, 
I, 
E)
 
5L6 
5MLT226

5L46  
5ML21T226
 For the fi rst step, let us eliminate { M } by dividing by  E . We only have to divide into  P :  
 
δ 5 f aP
E,    L,    I,  Eb
 
5L6 5L26 
5L6 
5L46
  We see that we may discard   E   as no longer relevant, and the dimension {  T } has 
vanished along with {  M  }. We need only eliminate {  L  } by dividing by, say, powers 
of  L  itself: 
 
δ
L 5 fcn a P
EL2,  L,   I
L4b
{1}   {1}   {1}
 Discard  L  itself as now irrelevant, and we obtain  Answer  (1) to Example 5.5:

L4b

5.3  The Pi Theorem 303
  Ipsen’s approach is again successful. The fact that {  M } and { T  } vanished in the same 
division is proof that there are only   two   repeating variables this time, not the three 
that would be inferred by the presence of {  M }, { L }, and { T }. 
 EXAMPLE 5.6 
  The leading-edge aerodynamic moment   M LE   on a supersonic airfoil is a function of its chord 
length   C  , angle of attack   α  , and several air parameters: approach velocity   V ,  density  ρ , speed 
of sound   a , and specifi c heat ratio   k   (Fig. E5.6). There is a very weak effect of air  viscosity, 
which is neglected here.

 Two of them,  α  and  k  , are already dimensionless. Leave them alone; they will be pi groups

 We end up with four pi groups and recognize  V/a  as the Mach number, Ma. In aerodynam-
ics, the dimensionless moment is often called the   moment  coeffi cient ,  C M  . Thus our fi nal 
result could be written in the compact form 
 
CM 5 fcn(α, Ma, k) 
Ans.
 Comments:  Our analysis is fi ne, but experiment and theory and physical reasoning all 
indicate that   M LE   varies more strongly with   V  than with  a  . Thus aerodynamicists commonly 
defi ne the moment coeffi cient as   C M  5  M LE /( ρ V 2 C 3  ) or something similar. We will study 
the analysis of supersonic forces and moments in Chap. 9. 
 5.4  Nondimensionalization  of 
 the  Basic  Equations 
   
We could use the pi theorem method of the previous section to analyze problem after 
problem after problem, fi nding the dimensionless parameters that govern in each case. 
Textbooks on dimensional analysis [for example, 5] do this. An alternative and very 
powerful technique is to attack the basic equations of fl ow from Chap. 4. Even though 
these equations cannot be solved in general, they will reveal basic dimensionless 
parameters, such as the Reynolds number, in their proper form and proper position, 
giving clues to when they are negligible. The boundary conditions must also be 
nondimensionalized. 
 
Let us briefl y apply this technique to the incompressible fl ow continuity and 
momentum equations with constant viscosity:  
Continuity: 
§ ? V 5 0 
(5.21a)
Navier-Stokes: 
ρ dV
dt 5 ρg 2 =p 1 μ§2V 
(5.21b)
 Typical boundary conditions for these two equations are (Sect. 4.6)

Known V, p 
(5.22)
Free surface, z 5 η: 
w 5 dη
dt    p 5 pa 2 Y(Rx
21 1 Ry
21) 
  We omit the energy equation (4.75) and assign its dimensionless form in the problems 
(Prob. P5.43).  
   
Equations (5.21) and (5.22) contain the three basic dimensions   M ,  L , and  T . All 
variables  p ,  V ,  x ,  y ,  z , and  t   can be nondimensionalized by using density and two 
reference constants that might be characteristic of the particular fl uid fl ow: 
Reference velocity 5 U   Reference length 5 L
 For example,  U   may be the inlet or upstream velocity and   L   the diameter of a body 
immersed in the stream.  

5.4  Nondimensionalization of the Basic Equations 305
 
Now defi ne all relevant dimensionless variables, denoting them by an asterisk: 
V* 5 V
U     =* 5 L=
x* 5 x
L  y* 5 y
L  z* 5 z
L  R* 5 R
L 
(5.23)
t* 5 tU
L   p* 5 p 1 ρgz
ρU2
  All these are fairly obvious except for   p  *, where we have introduced the piezometric 
pressure, a s suming that  z   is up. This is a hindsight idea suggested by Bernoulli’s 
equation (3.54).  
 
Since  ρ ,  U , and  L   are all constants, the derivatives in Eqs. (5.21) can all be handled 
in d i mensionless form with dimensional coeffi cients. For example, 
0u
0x 5 0(Uu*)
0(Lx*) 5 U
L 0u*
0x* 
  Substitute the variables from Eqs. (5.23) into Eqs. (5.21) and (5.22) and divide through 
by the leading dimensional coeffi cient, in the same way as we handled Eq. (5.12). 
Here are the resulting dimensionless equations of motion:

  These equations reveal a total of four dimensionless parameters, one in the Navier-
Stokes equation and three in the free-surface-pressure boundary condition.  
 Dimensionless  Parameters 
   
In the continuity equation there are no parameters. The Navier-Stokes equation con-
tains one, generally accepted as the most important parameter in fl uid mechanics: 
Reynolds number Re 5 ρUL
μ

306 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
  It is named after Osborne Reynolds (1842    –1912), a British engineer who fi rst pro-
posed it in 1883 (Ref. 4 of Chap. 6). The Reynolds number is always important, with 
or without a free surface, and can be neglected only in fl ow regions away from high-
velocity gradients—for example, away from solid surfaces, jets, or wakes.  
   
The no-slip and inlet-exit boundary conditions contain no parameters. The free-
surface-pressure condition contains three:  
Euler number (pressure coefficient) Eu 5 pa
ρU2
This is named after Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and is rarely important unless the 
pressure drops low enough to cause vapor formation (cavitation) in a liquid. The Euler 
number is often written in terms of pressure differences: Eu 5 Dp/(ρU2). If Dp 
involves vapor pressure pυ, it is called the cavitation number Ca 5 (pa 2 pυ)/(ρU2). 
 Cavitation problems are surprisingly common in many water fl ows. 
 
The second free-surface parameter is much more important: 
Froude number Fr 5 U2
gL
  It is named after William Froude (1810–1879), a British naval architect who, with his 
son Robert, developed the ship-model towing-tank concept and proposed similarity 
rules for free-surface fl ows (ship resistance, surface waves, open channels). The 
Froude number is the dominant effect in free-surface fl ows.  It can also be important 
in  stratifi ed  fl ows , where a strong density difference exists without a free surface.    
For example, see Ref. [42].  Chapter 10 investigates Froude number effects in detail.  
 
The fi nal free-surface parameter is 
Weber number We 5 ρU2L
Y
  It is named after Moritz Weber (1871–1951) of the Polytechnic Institute of Berlin, 
who developed the laws of similitude in their modern form. It was Weber who named 
Re and Fr after Reynolds and Froude. The Weber number is important only if it is 
of order unity or less, which typically occurs when the surface curvature is comparable 
in size to the liquid depth, such as in droplets, capillary fl ows, ripple waves, and very 
small hydraulic models. If We is large, its effect may be neglected.  
   
If there is no free surface, Fr, Eu, and We drop out entirely, except for the pos-
sibility of ca  v  itation of a liquid at very small Eu. Thus, in low-speed viscous fl ows 
with no free surface, the Reynolds number is the only important dimensionless 
parameter. 
  Compressibility  Parameters 
 
In high-speed fl ow of a gas there are signifi cant changes in pressure, density, and 
temperature that must be related by an equation of state such as the perfect-gas law, 
Eq. (1.10). These thermod  y  namic changes introduce two additional dimensionless 
parameters mentioned briefl y in earlier chapters: 
Mach number Ma 5 U
a     Specific-heat ratio k 5 cp
cυ

5.4  Nondimensionalization of the Basic Equations 307
  The Mach number is named after Ernst Mach (1838–1916), an Austrian physicist. 
The effect of   k   is only slight to moderate, but Ma exerts a strong effect on com-
pressible fl ow properties if it is greater than about 0.3. These effects are studied in 
Chap. 9.  
  Oscillating  Flows 
 
If the fl ow pattern is oscillating, a seventh parameter enters through the inlet boundary 
condition. For example, suppose that the inlet stream is of the form  
u 5 U cos ωt
 Nondimensionalization of this relation results in 
u
U 5 u* 5 cos aωL
U
 t*b
 The argument of the cosine contains the new parameter 
Strouhal number St 5 ωL
U
  The dimensionless forces and moments, friction, and heat transfer, and so on of such 
an oscillating fl ow would be a function of both Reynolds and Strouhal numbers. This 
parameter is named after V. Strouhal, a German physicist who experimented in 1878 
with wires singing in the wind.  
   
Some flows that you might guess to be perfectly steady actually have an 
oscillatory pattern that is dependent on the Reynolds number. An example is the 
periodic vortex shedding behind a blunt body immersed in a steady stream of 
velocity  U . Figure 5.2 a   shows an array of alternating vortices shed from a  circular 
cylinder immersed in a steady crossflow. This regular, periodic she  d  ding is 
called a   Kármán  vortex  street,   after T. von Kármán, who explained it theoreti-
cally in 1912. The shedding occurs in the range 10  2  ,  Re  ,  10 7  , with an average 
 Strouhal number  ω d /(2 π U )  <  0.21. Figure 5.2 b  shows measured shedding 
frequencies.  
   
Resonance can occur if a vortex shedding frequency is near a body’s structural 
vibration frequency. Electric transmission wires sing in the wind, undersea mooring 
lines gallop at certain current speeds, and slender structures fl utter at critical wind or 
vehicle speeds. A striking example is the disastrous failure of the Tacoma Narrows 
suspension bridge in 1940, when wind-excited vortex shedding caused resonance with 
the natural torsional oscillations of the bridge. The problem was magnifi ed by the 
bridge deck nonlinear stiffness, which occurred when the hangers went slack during 
the oscillation. 
  Other  Dimensionless  Parameters  
We have discussed seven important parameters in fl uid mechanics, and there are oth-
ers. Four additional parameters arise from nondimensionalization of the energy equa-
tion (4.75) and its boundary conditions. These four (Prandtl number, Eckert number, 
Grashof number, and wall te  m  perature ratio) are listed in Table 5.2 just in case you 
fail to solve Prob. P5.43. Another important and perhaps surprising parameter is the 

308 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
wall roughness ratio   ε / L  (in Table 5.2). 6 Slight changes in su  r face roughness have a 
striking effect in the turbulent fl ow or high-Reynolds-number range, as we shall see 
in Chap. 6 and in Fig. 5.3.  
   
This book is primarily concerned with Reynolds-, Mach-, and Froude-number 
effects, which dominate most fl ows. Note that we discovered these parameters (except  
ε / L  ) simply by nondimensionalizing the basic equations without actually solving them.  
6Roughness is easy to overlook because it is a slight geometric effect that does not appear in the 
equations of motion. It is a boundary condition that one might forget.

If the reader is not satiated with the 19 parameters given in Table 5.2, Ref. 29 con-
tains a list of over 1200 dimensionless parameters in use in engineering and science.  
  A  Successful  Application 
 
Dimensional analysis is fun, but does it work? Yes, if all important variables are 
included in the proposed function, the dimensionless function found by dimensional 
analysis will collapse all the data onto a single curve or set of curves.  
   
An example of the success of dimensional analysis is given in Fig. 5.3 for the 
measured drag on smooth cylinders and spheres. The fl ow is normal to the axis of 
the cylinder, which is extremely long,  L / d  S  `  . The data are from many sources, for 
both liquids and gases, and include bodies from several meters in diameter down to 
fi ne wires and balls less than 1 mm in size. Both curves in Fig. 5.3  a  are entirely 
experimental; the analysis of immersed body drag is one of the weakest areas of 
modern fl uid mechanics theory. Except for digital computer calculations, there is little 
theory for cylinder and sphere drag except   creeping  fl ow,  Re  ,  1.

5.4  Nondimensionalization of the Basic Equations 311
  
The concept of a fl uid-caused  drag  force  on bodies is covered extensively in Chap. 7. 
Drag is the fl uid force parallel to the oncoming stream—see Fig. 7.10 for details. 
   
The Reynolds number of both bodies is based on diameter, hence the notation Re  d . 
But the drag coeffi cients are defi ned differently: 
 
CD 5 µ
drag
1
2 ρU 2Ld
cylinder
drag

2 ρU2 1
4πd 2
sphere
 
(5.26)
They both have a factor 1
2 because the term 1
2ρU 2 occurs in Bernoulli’s equation, and 
both are based on the projected area—that is, the area one sees when looking toward 
the body from upstream. The usual defi nition of CD is thus
 
CD 5
drag
1
2 ρU2(projected area) 
(5.27)
However, one should carefully check the defi nitions of CD, Re, and the like before 
using data in the literature. Airfoils, for example, use the planform area.
 
Figure 5.3a is for long, smooth cylinders. If wall roughness and cylinder length 
are included as variables, we obtain from dimensional analysis a complex three-
parameter function:
 
CD 5 f aRed, ε
d, L
db 
(5.28)
  To describe this function completely would require 1000 or more experiments or CFD 
results. Therefore it is customary to explore the length and roughness effects sepa-
rately to establish trends.  
   
The table with Fig. 5.3  a   shows the length effect with zero wall roughness. As 
length d  e  creases, the drag decreases by up to 50 percent. Physically, the pressure is 
“relieved” at the ends as the fl ow is allowed to skirt around the tips instead of defl ect-
ing over and under the body.  
 
Figure 5.3 b   shows the effect of wall roughness for an infi nitely long cylinder. The 
sharp drop in drag occurs at lower Re  d   as roughness causes an earlier transition to a 
turbulent boundary layer on the surface of the body. Roughness has the same effect 
on sphere drag, a fact that is exploited in sports by deliberate dimpling of golf balls 
to give them less drag at their fl ight Re d  <  10 5 . See Fig. D5.2. 
   
Figure 5.3 is a typical experimental study of a fl uid mechanics problem, aided by 
dimensional analysis. As time and money and demand allow, the complete three-
parameter relation (5.28) could be fi lled out by further experiments. 
 EXAMPLE  5.7 
  A smooth cylinder, 1 cm in diameter and 20 cm long, is tested in a wind tunnel for a 
crossfl ow of 45 m/s of air at 20  8  C and 1 atm. The measured drag is 2.2   6  0.1 N. ( a ) Does 
this data point agree with the data in Fig. 5.3? (  b  ) Can this data point be used to predict the 
drag of a chimney 1 m in diameter and 20 m high in winds at 20  8  C and 1 atm? If so, what 

312 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
is the recommended range of wind velocities and drag forces for this data point? (  c ) Why 
are the answers to part (  b  ) always the same, regardless of the chimney height, as long as  
 L   5 20 d ? 
 Solution 
(a) For air at 208C and 1 atm, take ρ 5 1.2 kg/m3 and μ 5 1.8 E25 kg/(m-s). Since the test 
cylinder is short, L /d 5 20, it should be compared with the tabulated value CD < 0.91 in the 
table to the right of Fig. 5.3a. First calculate the Reynolds number of the test cylinder:
Red 5
ρUd
μ
5 (1.2 kg/m3)(45 m/s)(0.01 m)
1.8E25 kg/(m 2 s)
5 30,000
Yes, this is in the range 104 , Re , 105 listed in the table. Now calculate the test drag 
coeffi cient:
CD,test 5
F
(1/2)ρU2Ld 5
2.2 N
(1/2)(1.2 kg/m3)(45 m/s)2(0.2 m)(0.01 m) 5 0.905
Yes, this is close, and certainly within the range of 65 percent stated by the test results. 
Ans. (a)
(b) Since the chimney has L/d 5 20, we can use the data if the Reynolds number range is 
correct:
 
104 ,
(1.2 kg/m3)Uchimney(1 m)
1.8 E25 kg/(m ? s)
, 105  if  0.15 m
s , Uchimney , 1.5 m
s  
These are negligible winds, so the test data point is not very useful 
Ans. (b)
The drag forces in this range are also negligibly small:
 Fmin 5 CD

max Ld 5 (0.91) a1.2 kg/m3

b (1.5 m/s)2(20 m)(1 m) 5 25 N
(c) Try this yourself. Choose any 20:1 size for the chimney, even something silly like 20 
mm:1 mm. You will get the same results for U and F as in part (b) above. This is because 
the product Ud occurs in Red and, if L 5 20d, the same product occurs in the drag force. 
For example, for Re 5 104,

 EXAMPLE  5.8 
 Telephone wires are said to “sing” in the wind. Consider a wire of diameter 8 mm. At what 
sea-level wind velocity, if any, will the wire sing a middle C note? 

5.5  Modeling and Similarity 313
 Solution 
For sea-level air take ν < 1.5 E25 m2/s. For nonmusical readers, middle C is 262 Hz. 
Measured shedding rates are plotted in Fig. 5.2b. Over a wide range, the Strouhal number 
is  approximately 0.2, which we can take as a fi rst guess. Note that (ω/2π) 5 f, the shedding 
frequency. Thus

In Fig. 5.2b, at Re 5 5600, maybe St is a little higher, at about 0.21. Thus a slightly 
improved estimate is
 
Uwind 5 (262)(0.008)/(0.21) < 10.0 m/s 
Ans.
  5.5  Modeling  and  Similarity 
 
So far we have learned about dimensional homogeneity and the pi theorem method, 
using power products, for converting a homogeneous physical relation to dimension-
less form. This is straigh  t  forward mathematically, but certain engineering diffi culties 
need to be discussed.  
   
First, we have more or less taken for granted that the variables that affect the 
process can be listed and analyzed. Actually, selection of the important variables 
requires considerable judgment and experience. The engineer must decide, for exam-
ple, whether viscosity can be neglected. Are there signifi cant temperature effects? Is 
surface tension important? What about wall roughness? Each pi group that is retained 
increases the expense and effort required. Judgment in selecting variables will come 
through practice and maturity; this book should provide some of the necessary 
experience. 
   
Once the variables are selected and the dimensional analysis is performed, the 
experimenter seeks to achieve   similarity  between the model tested and the prototype 
to be designed. With suffi     cient testing, the model data will reveal the desired dimen-
sionless function between variables:  
 
ß1 5 f(ß2, ß3, p ßk) 
(5.29)
  With Eq. (5.29) available in chart, graphical, or analytical form, we are in a position 
to ensure co  m  plete similarity between model and prototype. A formal statement would 
be as follows: 
  Flow conditions for a model test are completely similar if all relevant dimensionless 
parameters have the same corresponding values for the model and the prototype.  
  This follows mathematically from Eq. (5.29). If   P 2 m  5  P 2 p ,  P 3 m  5  P 3 p , and so 
forth, Eq. (5.29) guarantees that the desired output   P 1 m  will equal  P 1 p . But this is 

314 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
easier said than done, as we now discuss. There are specialized texts on model test-
ing [30–32].  
   
Instead of complete similarity, the engineering literature speaks of particular types 
of sim  i  larity, the most common being geometric, kinematic, dynamic, and thermal. 
Let us consider each separately.  
  Geometric  Similarity 
 
Geometric similarity concerns the length dimension {  L  } and must be ensured before 
any sensible model testing can proceed. A formal defi nition is as follows: 
  A model and prototype are   geometrically  similar   if and only if all body dimensions 
in all three coo  r  dinates have the same linear scale ratio.  
 Note that  all   length scales must be the same. It is as if you took a photograph of the 
prototype and reduced it or enlarged it until it fi tted the size of the model. If the model 
is to be made one-tenth the prototype size, its length, width, and height must each be 
one-tenth as large. Not only that, but also its entire shape must be one-tenth as large, 
and technically we speak of   homologous   points, which are points that have the same 
relative location. For example, the nose of the prototype is homol  o gous to the nose 
of the model. The left wingtip of the prototype is homologous to the left wingtip of 
the model. Then geometric similarity requires that all homologous points be related 
by the same linear scale ratio. This applies to the fl uid geometry as well as the model 
geometry. 
  All angles are preserved in geometric similarity. All fl ow directions are preserved. 
The orientations of model and prototype with respect to the surroundings must be 
identical. 
   
Figure 5.4 illustrates a prototype wing and a one-tenth-scale model. The model 
lengths are all one-tenth as large, but its angle of attack with respect to the free stream 
is the same for both model and prototype: 10  8 not 1  8  . All physical details on the model 
must be scaled, and some are rather subtle and sometimes overlooked:  
 1. The model nose radius must be one-tenth as large.

 3. If the prototype has a 5-mm boundary layer trip wire 1.5 m from the leading 
edge, the model should have a 0.5-mm trip wire 0.15 m from its leading edge.  
 4. If the prototype is constructed with protruding fasteners, the model should have 
homologous protruding fasteners one-tenth as large.  
  And so on. Any departure from these details is a violation of geometric similarity and 
must be just i fi ed by experimental comparison to show that the prototype behavior was 
not signifi cantly affected by the discrepancy. 
   
Models that appear similar in shape but that clearly violate geometric similarity 
should not be compared except at your own risk. Figure 5.5 illustrates this point. The 
spheres in Fig. 5.5  a   are all geometrically similar and can be tested with a high expec-
tation of success if the Reynolds number, Froude number, or the like is matched. But 
the ellipsoids in Fig. 5.5  b  merely  look  similar. They a c tually have different linear 
scale ratios and therefore cannot be compared in a rational manner, even though they 
may have identical Reynolds and Froude numbers and so on. The data will not be 
the same for these ellipsoids, and any attempt to “compare” them is a matter of rough 
engineering judgment.  
  Kinematic  Similarity 
 
Kinematic similarity requires that the model and prototype have the same length scale 
ratio and the same time scale ratio. The result is that the velocity scale ratio will be 
the same for both. As Langhaar [4] states it:  
  The motions of two systems are kinematically similar if homologous particles lie 
at homologous points at homologous times.  
  Length scale equivalence simply implies geometric similarity, but time scale equivalence 
may r  e  quire additional dynamic considerations such as equivalence of the Reynolds and 
Mach numbers.  
   
One special case is incompressible frictionless fl ow with no free surface, as 
sketched in Fig. 5.6  a . These perfect-fl uid fl ows are kinematically similar with inde-
pendent length and time scales, and no additional parameters are necessary (see Chap. 8 
for further details).

  These Froude-scaling kinematic relations are illustrated in Fig. 5.6  b  for wave motion 
modeling. If the waves are related by the length scale   α  , then the wave period, propa-
gation speed, and particle velocities are related by  1α. 
   
If viscosity, surface tension, or compressibility is important, kinematic similarity 
depends on the achievement of dynamic similarity.  
  Dynamic  Similarity 
 
Dynamic similarity exists when the model and the prototype have the same length 
scale ratio, time scale ratio, and force scale (or mass scale) ratio. Again geometric 
similarity is a fi rst requirement; without it, proceed no further. Then dynamic similar-
ity exists, simultaneous with kinematic similarity, if the model and prototype force 
and pressure coeffi cients are identical. This is ensured if 
 1. For compressible fl ow, the model and prototype Reynolds number and Mach 
number and specifi c-heat ratio are correspondingly equal. 
 2. For incompressible fl ow 
 a . With no free surface: model and prototype Reynolds numbers are equal. 
 b . With a free surface: model and prototype Reynolds number, Froude 
 number, and (if ne c essary) Weber number and cavitation number are 
 correspondingly equal.  
 Mathematically, Newton’s law for any fl uid particle requires that the sum of the pres-
sure force, gravity force, and friction force equal the acceleration term, or inertia force,  
Fp 1 Fg 1 Ff 5 Fi
  The dynamic similarity laws listed above ensure that each of these forces will be in 
the same ratio and have equivalent directions between model and prototype. Figure 5.7

shows an example for fl ow through a sluice gate. The force polygons at homologous 
points have exactly the same shape if the Reynolds and Froude numbers are equal 
(neglecting surface tension and cavitation, of course). Kinematic similarity is also 
ensured by these model laws.  
  Discrepancies  in  Water  
and  Air  Testing 
 
The perfect dynamic similarity shown in Fig. 5.7 is more of a dream than a reality 
because true equivalence of Reynolds and Froude numbers can be achieved only by 
dramatic changes in fl uid properties, whereas in fact most model testing is simply 
done with water or air, the cheapest fl uids available. 
   
First consider hydraulic model testing with a free surface. Dynamic similarity 
requires equivalent Froude numbers, Eq. (5.30),   and  equivalent Reynolds numbers: 
 
VmLm
νm

(5.34)
  But both velocity and length are constrained by the Froude number, Eqs. (5.31) and 
(5.32). Therefore, for a given length scale ratio   α , Eq. (5.34) is true only if

For example, for a one-tenth-scale model,   α  5  0.1 and  α 3/2  5  0.032. Since  ν p  is 
undoubtedly water, we need a fl uid with only 0.032 times the kinematic viscosity of 
water to achieve dynamic similarity. Referring to Table 1.4, we see that this is impos-
sible: Even mercury has only one-ninth the kinematic viscosity of water, and a mercury 
hydraulic model would be expensive and bad for your health. In practice, water is used 
for both the model and the prototype, and the Reynolds number similarity (5.34) is 
unavoidably violated. The Froude number is held constant since it is the dominant param-
eter in free-surface fl ows. Typically the Reynolds number of the model fl ow is too small 
by a factor of 10 to 1000. As shown in Fig. 5.8, the low-Reynolds-number model data 
are used to est  i  mate by extrapolation the desired high  -  Reynolds-number prototype data. 
As the fi gure indicates, there is obviously considerable uncertainty in using such an 
extrapolation, but there is no other practical alternative in hydraulic model testing.

Second, consider aerodynamic model testing in air with no free surface. The impor-
tant p  a  rameters are the Reynolds number and the Mach number. Equation (5.34)

  Since the prototype is no doubt an air operation, we need a wind-tunnel fl uid of low 
viscosity and high speed of sound. Hydrogen is the only practical example, but clearly 
it is too expensive and dangerous. Therefore, wind tunnels normally operate with air 
as the working fl uid. Cooling and pressurizing the air will bring Eq. (5.37) into better 
agreement but not enough to satisfy a length scale reduction of, say, one-tenth. There-
fore Reynolds number scaling is also commonly violated in aerodynamic testing, and 
an extrapolation like that in Fig. 5.8 is required here also.  
   
There are specialized monographs devoted entirely to wind tunnel testing: low 
speed [38], high speed [39], and a detailed general discussion [40]. The following 
example illustrates modeling discrepancies in aeronautical testing.  
 EXAMPLE  5.9 
 A prototype airplane, with a chord length of 1.6 m, is to fl y at Ma  5 2 at 10 km standard 
altitude. A one-eighth scale model is to be tested in a helium wind tunnel at 100  8 C and 
1 atm. Find the helium test section velocity that will match (  a  ) the Mach number or (  b ) the 
Reynolds number of the prot  o  type. In each case criticize the lack of dynamic similarity. 
( c  ) What high pressure in the helium tunnel will match   both   the Mach and Reynolds numbers? 
( d ) Why does part ( c )  still  not achieve dynamic similarity? 
 Solution 
  For helium, from Table A.4,   R  5 2077 m  2 /(s 2 -K),  k  5 1.66, and estimate   μ He  < 2.32 
E 2 5 kg/( m # s ) from the power-law,  n  5 0.67, in the table. (  a  ) Calculate the helium speed of 
sound and velocity:

For dynamic similarity, the Reynolds numbers should also be equal. From Table A.6 at an 
altitude of 10,000 m, read ρair 5 0.4125 kg/m3, aair 5 299.5 m/s, and estimate μair < 1.48 
E25 kg/m # s from the power-law, n 5 0.7, in Table A.4. The air velocity is Vair 5
 (Ma)(aair) 5 2(299.5) 5 599 m/s. The model chord length is (1.6 m)/8 5 0.2 m. The helium 

320 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
density is ρHe 5 (p/RT)He 5 (101,350 Pa)/[(2077 m2/s2 K)(373 K)] 5 0.131 kg/m3. Now 
calculate the two Reynolds numbers:

  The model Reynolds number is 10 times less than the prototype. This is typical when using 
small-scale models. The test results must be extrapolated for Reynolds number effects. 
 ( b ) Now ignore Mach number and let the model Reynolds number match the prototype: 
ReHe 5 Reair 5 26.6 E6 5 (0.131 kg/m3)VHe(0.2 m)

Ans. (b)
  This is ridiculous: a hypersonic Mach number of 21, suitable for escaping from the earth’s 
gravity. One should match the Mach numbers and correct for a lower Reynolds number. 
 ( c ) Match both Reynolds and Mach numbers by increasing the helium density: 
 Ma matches if

Ans. (c)
 A match is possible if we increase the tunnel pressure by a factor of ten, a daunting task. 
 ( d  ) Even with Ma and Re matched, we are   still   not dynamically similar because the two gases 
have different specifi c heat ratios:   k He  5 1.66 and   k air  5 1.40. This discrepancy will cause 
substantial differences in pressure, density, and temperature throughout supersonic fl ow.  
   
Figure 5.9 shows a hydraulic model of the Bluestone Lake Dam in West Virginia. 
The model itself is located at the U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station in 
 Vicksburg, MS. The horizontal scale is 1:65, which is suffi cient that the vertical scale 
can also be 1:65 without incurring signifi cant surface tension (Weber number) effects. 
Velocities are scaled by the Froude number. However, the prototype Reynolds number, 
which is of order 1 E7, cannot be matched here. The engineers set the Reynolds num-
ber at about 2 E4, high enough for a reasonable approximation of prototype turbulent 
fl ow viscous effects. Note the intense turbulence below the dam. The downstream bed, 
or  apron,   of a dam must be strengthened structurally to avoid bed erosion.  

5.5  Modeling and Similarity 321
 
For hydraulic models of larger scale, such as harbors, estuaries, and embayments, 
geometric similarity may be violated of necessity. The vertical scale will be distorted 
to avoid Weber number effects. For example, the horizontal scale may be 1:1000, 
while the vertical scale is only 1:100. Thus the model channel may be   deeper  relative 
to its horizontal dimensions. Since deeper passages fl ow more effi ciently, the model 
channel bottom may be deliberately roughened to create the friction level expected in 
the prototype. 
 EXAMPLE  5.10 
  The pressure drop due to friction for fl ow in a long, smooth pipe is a function of average 
fl ow velocity, density, viscosity, and pipe length and diameter:   D p  5   fcn( V ,  ρ ,  μ ,  L ,  D ). 
We wish to know how  D p  varies with  V . ( a ) Use the pi theorem to rewrite this function in 
Fig. 5.9 Hydraulic model of the Bluestone Lake Dam on the New River near Hinton, West Virginia. The model scale is 1:65 both 
vertically and horizontally, and the Reynolds number, though far below the prototype value, is set high enough for the fl ow to be 
turbulent. (Courtesy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station.)

 V  , which we plan to plot versus each other. We select (  ρ ,  μ ,  D  ), and the pi theorem guarantees 
that three independent power-product groups will occur:

The nine data points are plotted as the open circles in Fig. 5.10. The values of   L / D  are 
listed for each point, and we see a signifi cant length effect. In fact, if we connect the only 
two points that have the same   L / D  ( 5     200), we could see (and cross-plot to verify) that   D p 
 increases linearly with  L  , as stated in the last part of the problem. Since   L  occurs only in

 All newtonian smooth pipe fl ows should correlate in this manner. This example is a varia-
tion of the fi rst completely successful dimensional analysis, pipe-fl ow friction, performed 
by Prandtl’s student Paul Blasius, who published a related plot in 1911. For this range of 
(turbulent fl ow) Reynolds numbers, the pressure drop increases approximately as  V 1.75 . 
 EXAMPLE  5.11 
 The smooth sphere data plotted in Fig. 5.3 a  represent dimensionless drag versus dimension-
less   viscosity , since ( ρ ,  V ,  d  ) were selected as scaling or repeating variables. (  a ) Replot these

This replot is shown as Fig. 5.11. The drag increases rapidly with velocity up to transition,

we may predict velocity from the fi gure, and vice versa.

• Comments: Better accuracy could be obtained by expanding the scale of Fig. 5.11 in the 
region of the given force coeffi cient. However, there is considerable uncertainty in pub-

610 percent.
Note that we found the answer directly from Fig. 5.11. We could use Fig. 5.3a also 
but would have to iterate between the ordinate and abscissa to obtain the fi nal result, since 
 V  is contained in both plotted variables. 
 Summary
 
Chapters 3 and 4 presented integral and differential methods of mathematical analysis 
of fl uid fl ow. This chapter introduces the third and fi nal method: experimentation, as 
supplemented by the tec  h  nique of dimensional analysis. Tests and experiments are 
used both to strengthen existing theories and to provide useful engineering results 
when theory is inadequate.  
   
The chapter begins with a discussion of some familiar physical relations and 
how they can be recast in dimensionless form because they satisfy the principle of 
dimensional homogeneity. A general technique, the pi theorem, is then presented 
for systematically fi nding a set of dimensio  n  less parameters by grouping a list of 
variables that govern any particular physical process. A second technique, Ipsen’s 
method, is also described. Alternately, direct application of dimensional analysis 
to the basic equations of fl uid mechanics yields the fundamental parameters gov-
erning fl ow pa  t  terns: Reynolds number, Froude number, Prandtl number, Mach 
number, and others.  
   
It is shown that model testing in air and water often leads to scaling diffi culties 
for which compromises must be made. Many model tests do not achieve true dynamic 
similarity. The chapter ends by pointing out that classic dimensionless charts and data 
can be manipulated and recast to provide direct solutions to problems that would 
otherwise be quite cumbersome and laboriously iterative.  
 Problems 
 Most of the problems herein are fairly straightforward. More diffi -
cult or open-ended assignments are labeled with an asterisk. Prob-
lems labeled with a computer icon 
 may require the use of a 
computer. The standard end-of-chapter problems P5.1 to P5.91 
(categorized in the problem list here) are followed by word prob-
lems W5.1 to W5.10, fundamentals of engineering exam problems 
FE5.1 to FE5.12, comprehensive applied problems C5.1 to C5.5, 
and design projects D5.1 and D5.2.

For axial fl ow through a circular tube, the Reynolds num-
ber for transition to turbulence is approximately 2300 [see 
Eq. (6.2)], based on the diameter and average velocity. If

fl ow rate in m 3 /h that causes transition. 
 P5.2   
A prototype automobile is designed for cold weather in 
Denver, CO (  2 10 8  C, 83 kPa). Its drag force is to 
be tested on a one-seventh-scale model in a wind tunnel 
at 150 mi/h, 20  8  C, and 1 atm. If the model and proto-
type are to satisfy dynamic similarity, what prototype 
 velocity, in mi/h, needs to be matched? Comment on 
your result.  
 P5.3   
The transfer of energy by viscous dissipation is dependent 
upon viscosity   μ , thermal co n ductivity  k , stream velocity  U ,

 possible, into the dimensionless   Brinkman  number,  which 
is proportional to  μ . 
 P5.4   
When tested in water at 20  8 C fl owing at 2 m/s, an 8  -  cm-
diameter sphere has a measured drag of 5 N. What will be 
the velocity and drag force on a 1.5-m-diameter weather 
balloon moored in sea-level standard air under dynami-
cally similar conditions?

  The same car travels in Colorado at 65 mi/h at an altitude 
of 3500 m. Using dimensional analysis, estimate (  a ) its

 P5.6   
 The disk-gap-band parachute in the chapter-opener photo 
had a drag of 1600 lbf when tested at 15 mi/h in air at 20 8 C 
and 1 atm. ( a ) What was its drag coeffi cient? ( b ) If, as 
stated, the drag on Mars is 65,000 lbf and the velocity is 
375 mi/h in the thin Mars atmosphere,  ρ  <  0.020 kg/m 3 , 
what is the drag coeffi cient on Mars? (c) Can you explain 
the difference between ( a ) and ( b )? 
 P5.7 
A body is dropped on the moon ( g  5  1.62 m/s 2 ) with an 
initial velocity of 12 m/s. By using option 2 variables, Eq. 
(5.11), the ground impact occurs at   t **  5  0.34 and  S **  5 
 0.84. Estimate ( a  ) the initial displacement, (  b ) the fi nal dis-
placement, and ( c ) the time of impact. 
 P5.8   
 The Archimedes number, Ar, used in the fl ow of stratifi ed

P5.9 
The Richardson number, Ri, which correlates the production 
of turbulence by buoyancy, is a dimensionless combination 
of the acceleration of gravity g, the fl uid temperature T0, 
the local temperature gradient 0T/0z, and the local  velocity

All quantities have their standard meanings; for example, 
 ρ   is density. 
 P5.11 During World War II, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, a British fl uid 
dynamicist, used dimensional analysis to estimate the wave 
speed of an atomic bomb explosion. He assumed that the 
blast wave radius   R   was a function of energy released   E , air 
density   ρ , and time  t  . Use dimensional reasoning to show 
how wave radius must vary with time. 
 P5.12 The  Stokes  number,   St, used in particle dynamics studies, 
is a dimensionless combination of   fi ve  variables: accelera-
tion of gravity   g , viscosity  μ , density  ρ , particle velocity  U , 
and particle d i ameter  D . ( a  ) If St is proportional to   μ 
 and inversely proportional to   g , fi nd its form  .  ( b ) Show 
that St is actually the quotient of two more traditional 
 dimensionless groups.  
 P5.13   The speed of propagation   C   of a capillary wave in deep 
water is known to be a function only of density   ρ , wave-
length  λ  , and surface tension   Y  . Find the proper func-
tional relationship, completing it with a dimensionless 
constant. For a given density and wavelength, how does 
the propagation speed change if the surface tension is 
doubled?  

Problems 327
 The  pi  theorem  or  Ipsen’s  method 
 P5.14    Flow in a pipe is often measured with an orifi ce plate, as in 
Fig. P5.14. The volume fl ow  Q  is a function of the pressure 
drop  Δ p  across the plate, the fl uid density  ρ , the pipe diam-
eter  D , and the orifi ce diameter  d . Rewrite this functional 
relationship in dimensionless form. 
 P5.14 
 P5.15   The wall shear stress   τ w   in a boundary layer is assumed to 
be a function of stream velocity   U  , boundary layer thick-
ness  δ  , local turbulence velocity   u 9 , density  ρ , and local 
pressure gradient   dp/dx . Using ( ρ ,  U ,  δ  ) as repeating vari-
ables, rewrite this relationship as a dimensionless function.

The dimensionless form of   h , called the  Stanton  number,  is 
a combination of   h , fl uid density   ρ  ,  specifi c heat   c p , and 
fl ow velocity   V  . Derive the Stanton number if it is propor-
tional to  h . What are the units of  h ? 
 P5.17   If you disturb a tank of length   L   and water depth   h , the 
surface will oscillate back and forth at frequency   V , 
 assumed here to depend also upon water density   ρ  and the 
acceleration of gravity   g . ( a  ) Rewrite this as a dimension-
less function. ( b  ) If a tank of water sloshes at 2.0 Hz on 
earth, how fast would it oscillate on Mars ( g  < 3.7 m/s 2 )? 
 P5.18   Under laminar conditions, the volume fl ow  Q  through a 
small triangular-section pore of side length   b  and length  L 
  is a function of viscosity   μ  , pressure drop per unit length  
 D p / L , and  b  . Using the pi theorem, rewrite this relation in 
dimensionless form. How does the volume fl ow change if 
the pore size  b  is doubled? 
 P5.19   The period of oscillation   T   of a water surface wave is 
 assumed to be a function of density   ρ , wavelength  l , depth  h , 
gravity   g  , and surface tension   Y  . Rewrite this relationship 
in dimensionless form. What results if   Y is negligible?  
 Hint:  Take  l ,  ρ , and  g  as repeating variables. 
 P5.20 A fi xed cylinder of diameter   D  and length  L  , immersed in a 
stream fl owing normal to its axis at velocity   U , will experi-
ence zero average lift. However, if the cylinder is rotating 
at angular velocity   V  , a lift force   F   will arise. The fl uid 
density   ρ   is important, but viscosity is secondary and can 
be n  e  glected. Formulate this lift behavior as a dimension-
less function. 
 P5.21 In Example 5.1 we used the pi theorem to develop Eq. (5.2) 
from Eq. (5.1). Instead of merely listing the primary 
 dimensions of each variable, some workers list the   powers 
 of each primary d i mension for each variable in an array:

This array of exponents is called the   dimensional  matrix 
 for the given function. Show that the  rank  of this matrix 
(the size of the largest nonzero determinant) is equal to   j  5 
 n  2  k , the desired reduction between original variables and 
the pi groups. This is a general property of dimensional 
matrices, as noted by Buckingham [1]. 
 P5.22    As will be discussed in Chap. 11, the power  P developed 
by a wind turbine is a function of diameter  D , air density ρ, 
wind speed  V , and rotation rate   ω . Viscosity effects are 
negligible. Rewrite this relationship in dimensionless form. 
 P5.23 The period  T   of vibration of a beam is a function of its 
length   L  , area moment of inertia   I  , modulus of elasticity   E , 
density   ρ  , and Poisson’s ratio   σ  . Rewrite this relation in 
dimensionless form. What further reduction can we make 
if  E  and  I   can occur only in the product form   EI ?  Hint: 
 Take  L ,  ρ , and  E  as repeating variables. 
 P5.24 The lift force  F  on a missile is a function of its length  L , 
velocity   V , diameter  D  , angle of attack   α , density  ρ , viscos-
ity  μ  , and speed of sound   a   of the air. Write out the dimen-
sional matrix of this function and determine its rank. (See 
Prob. P5.21 for an explanation of this concept.) Rewrite the 
function in terms of pi groups. 
 P5.25  The thrust  F   of a propeller is generally thought to be a 
function of its diameter   D   and angular velocity   V , the for-
ward speed   V  , and the density   ρ  and viscosity  μ   of the fl uid. 
Rewrite this rel a tionship as a dimensionless function. 
 P5.26   A pendulum has an oscillation period   T   which is assumed to 
depend on its length   L , bob mass  m  , angle of swing   θ , and 
the acceleration of gravity. A pendulum 1 m long, with a 
bob mass of 200 g, is tested on earth and found to have a 
period of 2.04 s when swinging at 20  8 . ( a  ) What is its period 
when it swings at 45  8  ? A similarly constructed pendulum, 

328 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
with  L  5   30 cm and  m  5     100 g, is to swing on the moon (  g  5  
 1.62 m/s 2 ) at  θ  5  20 8 . ( b ) What will be its period?  
 P5.27   In studying sand transport by ocean waves, A. Shields in 
1936 postulated that the threshold wave-induced bottom 
shear stress   τ   required to move particles depends on grav-
ity  g , particle size  d  and density  ρ p , and water density  ρ  and 
viscosity  μ . Find suitable dimensionless groups of this 
problem, which resulted in 1936 in the celebrated Shields 
sand transport diagram. 
 P5.28   A simply supported beam of diameter   D , length  L , and mod-
ulus of elasticity   E   is subjected to a fl uid crossfl ow of veloc-
ity  V , density  ρ , and viscosity  μ  . Its center defl ection  δ  is 
assumed to be a function of all these variables. (  a ) Rewrite 
this proposed function in dimensionless form. (  b ) Suppose it 
is known that   δ   is independent of   μ , inversely proportional 
to  E  , and dependent only on   ρ V 2 , not  ρ  and  V  separately. 
Simplify the dimensionless function accordingly.  Hint:  
 Take  L ,  ρ , and  V  as r e peating variables.  
 P5.29   When fluid in a pipe is accelerated linearly from rest, it 
begins as laminar flow and then u  n  dergoes transition to 
turbulence at a time  t tr that depends on the pipe diame-
ter  D , fluid acceleration  a , density  ρ , and viscosity  μ . 
Arrange this into a dimensionless relation between   t tr 
and  D .  
 P5.30   When a large tank of high-pressure gas discharges through 
a nozzle, the exit mass fl ow  m#    is a function of tank pressure  
 p 0 and temperature   T 0 , gas constant  R , specifi c heat   c p , and 
nozzle diameter   D  . Rewrite this as a dimensionless func-
tion. Check to see if you can use (  p 0 ,  T 0 ,  R ,  D ) as  repeating 
variables.  
 P5.31    The pressure drop per unit length in horizontal pipe fl ow, 
 D p/L , depends on the fl uid density  ρ , viscosity  μ , diameter 
 D , and volume fl ow rate  Q . Rewrite this function in terms 
of pi groups. 
 P5.32 A  weir   is an obstruction in a channel fl ow that can be cali-
brated to measure the fl ow rate, as in Fig. P5.32. The vol-
ume fl ow  Q  varies with gravity  g , weir width  b  into the 
paper, and upstream water height   H  above the weir crest. If 
it is known that   Q  is proportional to  b  , use the pi theorem to 
fi nd a unique functional relationship  Q ( g ,  b ,  H ).

 P5.33   A spar buoy (see Prob. P2.113) has a period   T  of vertical 
(heave) oscillation that depends on the waterline cross-
sectional area   A , buoy mass  m , and fl uid specifi c weight   γ . 
How does the period change due to doubling of (  a ) the 
mass and (  b  ) the area? Instrument buoys should have long 
p  e  riods to avoid wave resonance. Sketch a possible long-
period buoy design. 
 P5.34   To good approximation, the thermal conductivity   k  of a gas 
(see Ref. 21 of Chap. 1) depends only on the density   ρ , 
mean free path   l , gas constant  R  , and absolute temperature  
 T  . For air at 20  8  C and 1 atm,   k  <  0.026 W/(m  ?  K) and  l  < 
  6.5 E-8 m. Use this information to determine   k  for hydro-
gen at 20 8 C and 1 atm if  l  <  1.2 E-7 m. 
 P5.35 The torque  M   required to turn the cone-plate viscometer in 
Fig. P5.35 depends on the radius   R , rotation rate  V , fl uid 
viscosity  μ  , and cone angle   θ  . Rewrite this relation in 
 dimensionless form. How does the relation simplify it if it 
is known that  M  is proportional to  θ ?

 P5.36 The rate of heat loss  Q. loss through a window or wall is a 
function of the temperature diffe  r  ence between inside 
and outside  D T , the window surface area   A , and the  R 
  value of the window, which has units of (ft  2  ?  h  ?  8 F)/ Btu. 
( a  ) Using the Buckingham Pi Theorem, fi nd an  expression 
for rate of heat loss as a function of the other three 
 parameters in the problem. (  b  ) If the temperature 
 difference  D T   doubles, by what factor does the rate of 
heat loss increase?  
 P5.37  The volume fl ow  Q   through an orifi ce plate is a function of 
pipe diameter   D , pressure drop  D p   across the orifi ce, fl uid 
density   ρ  and viscosity  μ , and orifi ce diameter   d . Using  D , 
 ρ , and  D p  as r e peating variables, express this relationship 
in dimensionless form. 
 P5.38 The size  d  of droplets produced by a liquid spray nozzle is 
thought to depend on the nozzle diameter   D , jet velocity  U , 
and the properties of the liquid   ρ ,  μ , and  Y . Rewrite this 
relation in d i mensionless form.  Hint:  Take  D ,  ρ , and  U  as 
repeating variables. 

Problems 329
 P5.39  The volume fl ow  Q  over a certain dam is a function of dam 
width  b , gravity  g , and the upstream water depth  H above 
the dam crest. It is known that  Q  is proportional to  b . If  b  5 
 120 ft and  H  5    15 in., the fl ow rate is 600 ft 3 /s. What will 
be the fl ow rate if  H  5  3 ft? 
 P5.40  The time  t d    to drain a liquid from a hole in the bottom of a 
tank is a function of the hole d  i  ameter   d , the initial fl uid 
volume   y 0 , the initial liquid depth  h 0 , and the density   ρ  and 
viscosity   μ   of the fl uid. Rewrite this relation as a dimen-
sionless function, using Ipsen’s method. 
 P5.41   A certain axial fl ow turbine has an output torque   M  that is 
proportional to the volume fl ow rate   Q   and also depends on 
the density   ρ , rotor diameter  D  , and rotation rate   V . How 
does the torque change due to a doubling of (  a )  D  and ( b )  V ? 
 P5.42   When disturbed, a fl oating buoy will bob up and down at 
frequency   f  . Assume that this fr  e  quency varies with buoy 
mass   m , waterline diameter  d  , and the specifi c weight   γ  of 
the liquid. (  a ) Express this as a dimensionless function. ( b ) 
If  d  and  γ   are constant and the buoy mass is halved, how 
will the frequency change? 
 Nondimensionalizing  the  basic  equations 
 P5.43   Nondimensionalize the energy equation (4.75) and its 
boundary conditions (4.62), (4.63), and (4.70) by defi ning 
 T *  5  T / T 0 , where  T 0 is the inlet temperature, assumed con-
stant. Use other d  i  mensionless variables as needed from 
Eqs. (5.23). Isolate all dimensionless parameters you fi nd, 
and relate them to the list given in Table 5.2.

where  u   is the velocity,   D   is a diffusion coeffi cient,  k  is a

 P5.46   If a vertical wall at temperature   T w is surrounded by a fl uid

to be solved, along with continuity and energy, for (  u,  v,  T ) 
with appropriate boundary cond  i  tions. The quantity   β  is 
the thermal expansion coeffi cient of the fl uid. Use   ρ ,  g ,  L , 
and (  T w 2 T 0  ) to nondimensionalize this equation. Note that 
there is no “stream” velocity in this type of fl ow.

Use only the quantities   ρ ,  E , and  A  to nondimensionalize  y ,  x ,

by fu r ther manipulation of the variables? 
 Data  for  spheres,  cylinders,  other  bodies 
 P5.48 A smooth steel (SG  5     7.86) sphere is immersed in a stream 
of ethanol at 20 8 C moving at 1.5 m/s. Estimate its drag in 
N from Fig. 5.3  a  . What stream velocity would quadruple 
its drag? Take  D  5  2.5 cm. 
 P5.49 The sphere in Prob. P5.48 is dropped in gasoline at 20 8 C. 
Ignoring its acceleration phase, what will its terminal (con-
stant) fall velocity be, from Fig. 5.3 a ? 
 P5.50   The parachute in the chapter-opener photo is, of course, 
meant to decelerate the payload on Mars. The wind tunnel 
test gave a drag coeffi cient of about 1.1, based upon the 
projected area of the parachute. Suppose it was falling on  
 earth   and, at an altitude of 1000 m, showed a steady descent 
rate of about 18 mi/h. Estimate the weight of the payload.  
 P5.51   A ship is towing a sonar array that approximates a sub-
merged cylinder 1 ft in diameter and 30 ft long with its 
axis normal to the direction of tow. If the tow speed is 
12  kn (1  kn  5  1.69  ft/s), estimate the horsepower  required 
to tow this cylinder. What will be the frequency of vortices 
shed from the cylinder? Use Figs. 5.2 and 5.3.  
 P5.52 When fl uid in a long pipe starts up from rest at a uniform 
acceleration   a  , the initial fl ow is laminar. The fl ow under-
goes transition to turbulence at a time   t  * which depends, to 
fi rst approxim a tion, only upon  a ,  ρ , and  μ .  Experiments by 

330 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
P. J. Lefebvre, on water at 20  8  C starting from rest with 1-g 
acceleration in a 3-cm-diameter pipe, showed transition at  
 t  *  =  1.02 s. Use this data to estimate (  a  ) the transition time 
and (  b  ) the transition Reynolds number Re  D   for water fl ow 
accelerating at 35 m/s 2 in a 5-cm-diameter pipe. 
 P5.53   Vortex shedding can be used to design a   vortex  fl owmeter 
  (Fig. 6.34). A blunt rod stretched across the pipe sheds 
vortices whose frequency is read by the sensor down-
stream. Suppose the pipe diameter is 5 cm and the rod is a 
cylinder of diameter 8 mm. If the sensor reads 5400 counts 
per minute, estimate the volume fl ow rate of water in m  3 /h. 
How might the meter react to other liquids? 
 P5.54 A fi shnet is made of 1-mm-diameter strings knotted into 
2     3  2 cm squares. Estimate the horsepower required to

net plane is normal to the fl ow direction.

 P5.59  A long, slender, smooth 3-cm-diameter fl agpole bends

at least qualitatively? 
 Scaling  of  model  data 
 *P5.60 The thrust  F   of a free propeller, either aircraft or marine, 
 depends upon density   ρ  , the rotation rate   n   in r/s, the diame-
ter  D  , and the forward velocity   V  . Viscous effects are slight 
and neglected here. Tests of a 25-cm-diameter model aircraft 
propeller, in a sea-level wind tunnel, yield the fo  l  lowing 
thrust data at a velocity of 20 m/s:  
Rotation rate, r/min

thrust, in newtons, of a similar 1.6-m-diameter prototype 
propeller when rotating at 3800 r/min and fl ying at 225 mi/h

 P5.61   If viscosity is neglected, typical pump fl ow results from Ex-
ample 5.3 are shown in Fig. P5.61 for a model pump tested in 
water. The pressure rise decreases and the power required in-
creases with the dimensionless fl ow coeffi cient. Curve-fi t ex-
pressions are given for the data. Suppose a similar pump of 
12-cm diameter is built to move gasoline at 20  8  C and a fl ow

some factor   f  . He then measures the drag on the model at 
dynamically similar conditions (also with air at standard 
atmospheric conditions). The student claims that the drag 
force on the prototype will be identical to that measured on 
the model. Is this claim correct? Explain.

 P5.71   The pressure drop in a venturi meter (Fig. P3.128) varies only

A geometrically similar prototype meter is used to measure 
gasoline at 20  8  C and a fl ow rate of 9 m  3  /min. If the prototype

upstream pipe diameter be?  
 P5.72   A one-twelfth-scale model of a large commercial aircraft is

 P5.77    A dam 75 ft wide, with a nominal fl ow rate of 260 ft 3 , is to

test? ( c ) Derive a formula for a force on the model as com-
pared to a force on the prototype. 
 P5.78   A prototype spillway has a characteristic velocity of 3 m/s 
and a characteristic length of 10 m. A small model is con-

scale ratio of the model that will ensure that its minimum 
Weber number is 100? Both fl ows use water at 20 8 C. 
 P5.79   An East Coast estuary has a tidal period of 12.42 h (the 
semidiurnal lunar tide) and tidal currents of approximately 
80 cm/s. If a one-fi ve-hundredth-scale model is constructed 
with tides driven by a pump and storage apparatus, what 
should the period of the model tides be and what model 
current speeds are expected? 
 P5.80   A prototype ship is 35 m long and designed to cruise at 
11 m/s (about 21 kn). Its drag is to be simulated by a 1 - m-
long model pulled in a tow tank. For Froude scaling fi nd

drag, and ( c ) the ratio of prototype to model power.  
 P5.81   An airplane, of overall length 55 ft, is designed to fl y at 
680 m/s at 8000-m standard altitude. A one-thirtieth-scale 
model is to be tested in a pressurized helium wind tunnel at 
20 8  C. What is the appropriate tunnel pressure in atm? Even 
at this (high) pressure, exact dynamic similarity is not 
achieved. Why? 
 P5.82 A one-fi ftieth-scale model of a military airplane is tested at 
1020 m/s in a wind tunnel at sea-level conditions. The 
model wing area is 180 cm  2  . The angle of attack is 3  8 . If the 
measured model lift is 860 N, what is the prototype lift, 
using Mach number scaling, when it fl ies at 10,000 m stan-
dard altitude under dynamically similar conditions?  Note: 
 Be careful with the area scaling. 
 P5.83   A one-fortieth-scale model of a ship’s propeller is tested in a

 P5.84   A prototype ocean platform piling is expected to encounter 
currents of 150 cm/s and waves of 12-s period and 3-m

Estimating pipe wall friction is one of the most common 
tasks in fl uids engineering. For long circular rough pipes in 
turbulent fl ow, wall shear   τ w   is a function of density  
 ρ ,   viscosity  μ , average velocity  V , pipe diameter  d , and 
wall roughness height   e  . Thus, functionally, we can write  
 τ w  5  fcn( ρ ,  μ ,  V ,  d ,  e ). ( a  ) Using dimensional analysis, 
rewrite this function in dimensionless form. (  b ) A certain 
pipe has   d  5  5 cm and  ε  5  0.25 mm. For fl ow of water at

When the fl uid exiting a nozzle, as in Fig. P3.49, is a gas,

is small. In this case, the difference   p 1  2  p 2 is no longer 
controlling, and the gas mass fl ow  m#    reaches a maximum 
value that depends on   p 1 and   d 2 and also on the absolute

  By analogy with the cylinder drag data in Fig. 5.3  b , spheres 
also show a strong roughness effect on drag, at least in the 
Reynolds number range 4 E4     ,  Re D  ,  3 E5, which 
 accounts for the dimpling of golf balls to increase their 
distance traveled. Some experimental data for roughened 

336 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
spheres [33] are given in Fig. D5.2. The fi gure also shows 
typical golf ball data. We see that some roughened spheres 
are better than golf balls in some regions. For the present 
study, let us neglect the ball’s   spin,   which causes the very 
important side-force or  Magnus  effect  (see Fig. 8.15) and 
assume that the ball is hit without spin and follows the 
equations of motion for plane motion ( x ,  z ):

 Assuming sea-level air and a modest but fi nite range of 
initial conditions, integrate the equations of motion to com-
pare the trajectory of “roughened spheres” to actual golf 
ball calculations. Can the rough sphere outdrive a normal

Pipeline, which has been operating since July 2010. This pipeline delivers heavy and light 
blends of oil from Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, to refi neries in Texas. The pipeline is completely

Chapter 6
Viscous Flow in Ducts
Motivation. This chapter is completely devoted to an important practical fl uids engi-
neering problem: fl ow in ducts with various velocities, various fl uids, and various duct 
shapes. Piping systems are encountered in almost every engineering design and thus 
have been studied extensively. There is a small amount of theory plus a large amount 
of experimentation.
 
The basic piping problem is this: Given the pipe geometry and its added compo-
nents (such as fi ttings, valves, bends, and diffusers) plus the desired fl ow rate and 
fl uid properties, what pressure drop is needed to drive the fl ow? Of course, it may be 
stated in alternative form: Given the pressure drop available from a pump, what fl ow 
rate will ensue? The correlations discussed in this chapter are adequate to solve most 
such piping problems.
 
This chapter is for incompressible fl ow; Chap. 9 treats compressible pipe fl ow.
6.1 Reynolds Number Regimes  
Now that we have derived and studied the basic fl ow equations in Chap. 4, you would 
think that we could just whip off myriad beautiful solutions illustrating the full range 
of fl uid behavior, of course expressing all these educational results in dimensionless 
form, using our new tool from Chap. 5, dimensional analysis.
 
The fact of the matter is that no general analysis of fl uid motion yet exists. There 
are several dozen known particular solutions, there are many approximate digital 
computer solutions, and there are a great many experimental data. There is a lot of 
theory available if we neglect such important effects as viscosity and compressibility 
(Chap. 8), but there is no general theory and there may never be. The reason is that 
a profound and vexing change in fl uid behavior occurs at moderate Reynolds numbers. 
The fl ow ceases being smooth and steady (laminar) and becomes fl uctuating and 
agitated (turbulent). The changeover is called transition to turbulence. In Fig. 5.3a 
we saw that transition on the cylinder and sphere occurred at about Re 5 3 3 105, 
where the sharp drop in the drag coeffi cient appeared. Transition depends on many 
effects, such as wall roughness (Fig. 5.3b) or fl uctuations in the inlet stream, but the 
primary parameter is the Reynolds number. There are a great many data on transition 
but only a small amount of theory [1 to 3].

340 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
 
Turbulence can be detected from a measurement by a small, sensitive instrument 
such as a hot-wire anemometer (Fig. 6.29e) or a piezoelectric pressure transducer. The 
fl ow will appear steady on average but will reveal rapid, random fl uctuations if turbu-
lence is present, as sketched in Fig. 6.1. If the fl ow is laminar, there may be occasional 
natural disturbances that damp out quickly (Fig. 6.1a). If transition is occurring, there 
will be sharp bursts of intermittent turbulent fl uctuation (Fig. 6.1b) as the increasing 
Reynolds number causes a breakdown or instability of laminar motion. At suffi ciently 
large Re, the fl ow will fl uctuate continually (Fig. 6.1c) and is termed fully turbulent. 
The fl uctuations, typically ranging from 1 to 20 percent of the average velocity, are 
not strictly periodic but are random and encompass a continuous range, or spectrum, 
of frequencies. In a typical wind tunnel fl ow at high Re, the turbulent frequency ranges 
from 1 to 10,000 Hz, and the wavelength ranges from about 0.01 to 400 cm.
EXAMPLE 6.1
The accepted transition Reynolds number for fl ow in a circular pipe is Red,crit < 2300. For 
fl ow through a 5-cm-diameter pipe, at what velocity will this occur at 208C for (a) airfl ow 
and (b) water fl ow?
Solution
Almost all pipe fl ow formulas are based on the average velocity V 5 Q/A, not centerline or 
any other point velocity. Thus transition is specifi ed at ρVd/μ < 2300. With d known, we 
introduce the appropriate fl uid properties at 208C from Tables A.3 and A.4:
(a) Air: 
 
ρVd
μ
5 (1.205 kg/m3)V(0.05 m)
1.80 E-5 kg/(m # s)

(b) Water:

μ
5 (998 kg/m3)V(0.05 m)
0.001 kg/(m # s)
5 2300    or    V 5 0.046 m
s
These are very low velocities, so most engineering air and water pipe fl ows are turbulent, 
not laminar. We might expect laminar duct fl ow with more viscous fl uids such as lubricating 
oils or glycerin.
 
In free-surface fl ows, turbulence can be observed directly. Figure 6.2 shows liquid fl ow 
issuing from the open end of a tube. The low-Reynolds-number jet (Fig. 6.2a) is smooth 
and laminar, with the fast center motion and slower wall fl ow forming different  trajectories

joined by a liquid sheet. The higher-Reynolds-number turbulent fl ow (Fig. 6.2b) is 
unsteady and irregular but, when averaged over time, is steady and predictable.
 
How did turbulence form inside the pipe? The laminar parabolic fl ow profi le, which 
is similar to Eq. (4.137), became unstable and, at Red < 2300, began to form “slugs” 
or “puffs” of intense turbulence. A puff has a fast-moving front and a slow-moving 
rear and may be visualized by experimenting with glass tube fl ow. Figure 6.3 shows 
a puff as photographed by Bandyopadhyay [45]. Near the entrance (Fig. 6.3a and b) 
there is an irregular laminar–turbulent interface, and vortex roll-up is visible. Further 
downstream (Fig. 6.3c) the puff becomes fully turbulent and very active, with helical 
motions visible. Far downstream (Fig. 6.3d) the puff is cone-shaped and less active, 
with a fuzzy, ill-defi ned interface, sometimes called the “relaminarization” region.
 
A complete description of the statistical aspects of turbulence is given in Ref. 1, while 
theory and data on transition effects are given in Refs. 2 and 3. At this introductory level 
we merely point out that the primary parameter affecting transition is the Reynolds 
number. If Re 5 UL/ν, where U is the average stream velocity and L is the “width,” or 
transverse thickness, of the shear layer, the following approximate ranges occur:
  0 , Re ,  1: highly viscous laminar “creeping” motion
  1 , Re , 100: laminar, strong Reynolds number dependence
100 , Re , 103: laminar, boundary layer theory useful
103 , Re , 104: transition to turbulence
104 , Re , 106: turbulent, moderate Reynolds number dependence
106 , Re ,  ` : turbulent, slight Reynolds number dependence
These representative ranges vary somewhat with fl ow geometry, surface roughness, 
and the level of fl uctuations in the inlet stream. The great majority of our analyses 
are concerned with laminar fl ow or with turbulent fl ow, and one should not normally 
design a fl ow operation in the transition region.

6.1  Reynolds Number Regimes 343
Historical Outline
 
Since turbulent fl ow is more prevalent than laminar fl ow, experimenters have observed 
turbulence for centuries without being aware of the details. Before 1930 fl ow instru-
ments were too insensitive to record rapid fl uctuations, and workers simply reported 
mean values of velocity, pressure, force, and so on. But turbulence can change 
the mean values dramatically, as with the sharp drop in drag coeffi cient in Fig. 5.3. 
A German engineer named G. H. L. Hagen fi rst reported in 1839 that there might be 
two regimes of viscous fl ow. He measured water fl ow in long brass pipes and deduced 
a pressure-drop law:
 
 ¢p 5 (const) LQ
R4 1 entrance effect 
(6.1)
This is exactly our laminar fl ow scaling law from Example 5.4, but Hagen did not 
realize that the constant was proportional to the fl uid viscosity.
 
The formula broke down as Hagen increased Q beyond a certain limit—that is, 
past the critical Reynolds number—and he stated in his paper that there must be a 
second mode of fl ow characterized by “strong movements of water for which Dp 
varies as the second power of the discharge. . . .” He admitted that he could not clarify 
the reasons for the change.
 
A typical example of Hagen’s data is shown in Fig. 6.4. The pressure drop varies 
linearly with V 5 Q/A up to about 1.1 ft/s, where there is a sharp change. Above about

V 5 2.2 ft/s the pressure drop is nearly quadratic with V. The actual power 
Dp ~ V1.75 seems impossible on dimensional grounds but is easily explained when 
the dimensionless pipe fl ow data (Fig. 5.10) are displayed.
 
In 1883 Osborne Reynolds, a British engineering professor, showed that the change 
depended on the parameter ρVd/μ, now named in his honor. By introducing a dye 
streak into a pipe fl ow, Reynolds could observe transition and turbulence. His sketches 
[4] of the fl ow behavior are shown in Fig. 6.5.
 
If we examine Hagen’s data and compute the Reynolds number at V 5 1.1 ft/s, 
we obtain Red 5 2100. The fl ow became fully turbulent, V 5 2.2 ft/s, at Red 5 4200. 
The accepted design value for pipe fl ow transition is now taken to be
 
Red,crit < 2300 
(6.2)
This is accurate for commercial pipes (Fig. 6.13), although with special care in pro-
viding a rounded entrance, smooth walls, and a steady inlet stream, Red,crit can be 
delayed until much higher values. The study of transition in pipe fl ow, both experi-
mentally and theoretically, continues to be a fascinating topic for researchers, as 
discussed in a recent review article [55]. Note: The value of 2300 is for transition in 
pipes. Other geometries, such as plates, airfoils, cylinders, and spheres, have com-
pletely different transition Reynolds numbers.
 
Transition also occurs in external fl ows around bodies such as the sphere and 
cylinder in Fig. 5.3. Ludwig Prandtl, a German engineering professor, showed in 1914 
that the thin boundary layer surrounding the body was undergoing transition from 
laminar to turbulent fl ow. Thereafter the force coeffi cient of a body was acknowledged 
to be a function of the Reynolds number [Eq. (5.2)].
 
There are now extensive theories and experiments of laminar fl ow instability that 
explain why a fl ow changes to turbulence. Reference 5 is an advanced textbook on 
this subject.
 
Laminar fl ow theory is now well developed, and many solutions are known [2, 3], 
but no analyses can simulate the fi ne-scale random fl uctuations of turbulent fl ow.1 
Therefore most turbulent fl ow theory is semiempirical, based on dimensional analysis 
and physical reasoning; it is concerned with the mean fl ow properties only and the 
mean of the fl uctuations, not their rapid variations. The turbulent fl ow “theory” pre-
sented here in Chaps. 6 and 7 is unbelievably crude yet surprisingly effective. We shall 
attempt a rational approach that places turbulent fl ow analysis on a fi rm physical basis.
6.2 Internal versus External 
Viscous Flows
 
Both laminar and turbulent fl ow may be either internal (that is, “bounded” by walls) 
or external and unbounded. This chapter treats internal fl ows, and Chap. 7 studies 
external fl ows.
 
An internal fl ow is constrained by the bounding walls, and the viscous effects will 
grow and meet and permeate the entire fl ow. Figure 6.6 shows an internal fl ow in a 
long duct. There is an entrance region where a nearly inviscid upstream fl ow con-
verges and enters the tube. Viscous boundary layers grow downstream, retarding the 
1However, direct numerical simulation (DNS) of low-Reynolds-number turbulence is now quite 
 common [32].

At a fi nite distance from the entrance, the boundary layers merge and the inviscid 
core disappears. The tube fl ow is then entirely viscous, and the axial velocity adjusts 
slightly further until at x 5 Le it no longer changes with x and is said to be fully 
developed, u < u(r) only. Downstream of x 5 Le the velocity profi le is constant, the 
wall shear is constant, and the pressure drops linearly with x, for either laminar or 
turbulent fl ow. All these details are shown in Fig. 6.6.

 affecting entrance length. If

The maximum laminar entrance length, at Red,crit 5 2300, is Le 5 138d, which is the 
longest development length possible.
 
In turbulent fl ow, the boundary layers grow faster, and Le is relatively shorter. For 
decades, the writer has favored a sixth-power-law estimate, Le/d < 4.4 Red
1/6, but 
recent CFD results, communicated by Fabien Anselmet, and separately by Sukanta

Now 90 diameters may seem “long,” but typical pipe fl ow applications involve an 
L/d value of 1000 or more, in which case the entrance effect may be neglected and 
a simple analysis made for fully developed fl ow. This is possible for both laminar 
and turbulent fl ows, including rough walls and noncircular cross sections.

This is a very small percentage, so we can reasonably treat this pipe fl ow as essentially

6.3  Head Loss—The Friction Factor 347
 
Shortness can be a virtue in duct fl ow if one wishes to maintain the inviscid core. 
For example, a “long” wind tunnel would be ridiculous, since the viscous core would 
invalidate the purpose of simulating free-fl ight conditions. A typical laboratory low-
speed wind tunnel test section is 1 m in diameter and 5 m long, with V 5 30 m/s. If 
we take νair 5 1.51 3 1025 m2/s from Table 1.4, then Red 5 1.99 3 106 and, from 
Eq. (6.6), Le/d < 49. The test section has L/d 5 5, which is much shorter than the 
development length. At the end of the section the wall boundary layers are only 10 cm 
thick, leaving 80 cm of inviscid core suitable for model testing.
 
An external fl ow has no restraining walls and is free to expand no matter how 
thick the viscous layers on the immersed body may become. Thus, far from the body 
the fl ow is nearly inviscid, and our analytical technique, treated in Chap. 7, is to patch 
an inviscid-fl ow solution onto a viscous boundary-layer solution computed for the 
wall region. There is no external equivalent of fully developed internal fl ow.
6.3 Head Loss—The Friction 
Factor
 
When applying pipe fl ow formulas to practical problems, it is customary to use a 
control volume analysis. Consider incompressible steady fl ow between sections 1 and 
2 of the inclined constant-area pipe in Fig. 6.7. The one-dimensional continuity 
 relation, Eq. (3.30), reduces to
Q1 5 Q2 5 const  or  V1 5 V2 5 V
since the pipe is of constant area. The steady fl ow energy equation (3.75) becomes

since there is no pump or turbine between 1 and 2. For fully developed fl ow, the 
velocity profi le shape is the same at sections 1 and 2. Thus α1 5 α2 and, since 
V1 5 V2, Eq. (6.7) reduces to head loss versus pressure drop and elevation change:
hf 5 (z1 2 z2) 1 a p1
ρg 2 p2
ρgb 5 ¢z 1 ¢p
ρg  
(6.8)
The pipe head loss equals the change in the sum of pressure and gravity head—that 
is, the change in height of the hydraulic grade line (HGL).
 
Finally, apply the momentum relation (3.40) to the control volume in Fig. 6.7, 
accounting for applied x-directed forces due to pressure, gravity, and shear:
a Fx 5 ¢p (πR2) 1 ρg(πR2)L sin ϕ 2 τw(2πR)L 5 m# (V2 2 V1) 5 0 (6.9a)
Rearrange this and we fi nd that the head loss is also related to wall shear stress:
¢z 1 ¢p
ρg 5 hf 5 2τw
ρg  L
R 5 4τw
ρg  L
d 
(6.9b)
where we have substituted Dz 5 L sin ϕ from the geometry of Fig. 6.7. Note that, 
regardless of whether the pipe is horizontal or tilted, the head loss is proportional to 
the wall shear stress.
 
How should we correlate the head loss for pipe fl ow problems? The answer was 
given a century and a half ago by Julius Weisbach, a German professor who in 1850 
published the fi rst modern textbook on hydrodynamics. Equation (6.9b) shows that hf
is proportional to (L/d), and data such as Hagen’s in Fig. 6.6 show that, for turbulent 
fl ow, hf is approximately proportional to V2. The proposed correlation, still as effective 
today as in 1850, is
hf 5 f L
d V2
2g  where  f 5 fcn(Red, ε
d, duct shape)  
(6.10)
The dimensionless parameter f is called the Darcy friction factor, after Henry Darcy 
(1803–1858), a French engineer whose pipe fl ow experiments in 1857 fi rst established 
the effect of roughness on pipe resistance. The quantity ε is the wall roughness height, 
which is important in turbulent (but not laminar) pipe fl ow. We added the “duct 
shape” effect in Eq. (6.10) to remind us that square and triangular and other noncir-
cular ducts have a somewhat different friction factor than a circular pipe. Actual data 
and theory for friction factors will be discussed in the sections that follow.
 
By equating Eqs. (6.9) and (6.10) we fi nd an alternative form for friction factor:
f 5 8τw
ρV2 
(6.11)
For noncircular ducts, we must interpret τw to be an average value around the duct 
perimeter. For this reason Eq. (6.10) is preferred as a unifi ed defi nition of the Darcy 
friction factor.

Analytical solutions can be readily derived for laminar fl ows, either circular or non-
circular. Consider fully developed Poiseuille fl ow in a round pipe of diameter d, radius

The paraboloid velocity profi le has an average velocity V which is one-half of the 
maximum velocity. The quantity Dp is the pressure drop in a pipe of length L; that 
is, (dp/dx) is negative. These formulas are valid whenever the pipe Reynolds number, 
Red 5 ρVd/μ, is less than about 2300. Note that τw is proportional to V (see Fig. 6.6) 
and is independent of density because the fl uid acceleration is zero. Neither of these 
is true in turbulent fl ow.

In laminar fl ow, the pipe friction factor decreases inversely with Reynolds number. 
This famous formula is effective, but often the algebraic relations of Eqs. (6.12) are 
more direct for problems.

An oil with ρ 5 900 kg/m3 and ν 5 0.0002 m2/s fl ows upward through an inclined pipe

tons) for all variables we avoid the need for any conversion factors in the calculations.

• Comments: We didn’t need the value of ρ—the formula contains ρg, but who knew?

see in Example 6.8.

subject to no slip at the walls and known inlet and exit conditions. (We shall save 
our free-surface solutions for Chap. 10.)
 
We will not work with the differential energy relation, Eq. (4.53), in this chapter, 
but it is very important, both for heat transfer calculations and for general understand-
ing of duct fl ow processes. There is work being done by pressure forces to drive the 
fl uid through the duct. Where does this energy go? There is no work done by the wall 
shear stresses, because the velocity at the wall is zero. The answer is that pressure 
work is balanced by viscous dissipation in the interior of the fl ow. The integral of 
the dissipation function F, from Eq. (4.50), over the fl ow fi eld will equal the pres-
sure work. An example of this fundamental viscous fl ow energy balance is given in 
Problem C6.7.
 
Both laminar and turbulent fl ows satisfy Eqs. (6.14). For laminar fl ow, where there 
are no random fl uctuations, we go right to the attack and solve them for a variety of 
geometries [2, 3], leaving many more, of course, for the problems.
Reynolds’ Time-Averaging 
Concept
 
For turbulent fl ow, because of the fl uctuations, every velocity and pressure term in 
Eqs. (6.14) is a rapidly varying random function of time and space. At present our 
mathematics cannot handle such instantaneous fl uctuating variables. No single pair of 
random functions V(x, y, z, t) and p(x, y, z, t) is known to be a solution to Eqs. (6.14). 
Moreover, our attention as engineers is toward the average or mean values of velocity, 
pressure, shear stress, and the like in a high-Reynolds-number (turbulent) fl ow. This 
approach led Osborne Reynolds in 1895 to rewrite Eqs. (6.14) in terms of mean or 
time-averaged turbulent variables.

The fl uctuation u9 is defi ned as the deviation of u from its average value

u¿ 5 1

(u 2 u) dt 5 u 2 u 5 0 
(6.17)
However, the mean square of a fl uctuation is not zero and is a measure of the inten-
sity of the turbulence:
u¿2 5 1
T #
T
0
u¿2 dt ? 0 
(6.18)
Nor in general are the mean fl uctuation products such as u¿υ¿ and u¿p¿ zero in a 
typical turbulent fl ow.
 
Reynolds’ idea was to split each property into mean plus fl uctuating variables:
u 5 u 1 u¿  υ 5 υ 1 υ¿  w 5 w 1 w¿  p 5 p 1 p¿ 
(6.19)
Substitute these into Eqs. (6.14), and take the time mean of each equation. The 
 continuity relation reduces to
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 1 0w
0z 5 0 
(6.20)
which is no different from a laminar continuity relation.
 
However, each component of the momentum equation (6.14b), after time averag-
ing, will contain mean values plus three mean products, or correlations, of fl uctuating 
velocities. The most important of these is the momentum relation in the mainstream, 
or x, direction, which takes the form
ρ d  u

0x 1 ρgx 1 0

0y aμ0u

0z aμ0u
0z 2 ρu¿w¿b 
(6.21)
The three correlation terms 2ρu¿2, 2ρu¿υ¿, and 2ρu¿w¿ are called turbulent stresses
because they have the same dimensions and occur right alongside the newtonian 
(laminar) stress terms μ(0u/0x) and so on.
 
The turbulent stresses are unknown a priori and must be related by experiment to 
geometry and fl ow conditions, as detailed in Refs. 1 to 3. Fortunately, in duct and 
boundary layer fl ow, the stress 2ρu¿υ¿, associated with direction y normal to the wall 
is dominant, and we can approximate with excellent accuracy a simpler streamwise 
momentum equation

Figure 6.9 shows the distribution of τlam and τturb from typical measurements across 
a turbulent shear layer near a wall. Laminar shear is dominant near the wall (the wall 
layer), and turbulent shear dominates in the outer layer. There is an intermediate 
region, called the overlap layer, where both laminar and turbulent shear are important. 
These three regions are labeled in Fig. 6.9.
 
In the outer layer τturb is two or three orders of magnitude greater than τlam, and 
vice versa in the wall layer. These experimental facts enable us to use a crude but 
very effective model for the velocity distribution u(y) across a turbulent wall layer.
The Logarithmic Overlap Law
 
We have seen in Fig. 6.9 that there are three regions in turbulent fl ow near a wall:
1. Wall layer: Viscous shear dominates.
2. Outer layer: Turbulent shear dominates.
3. Overlap layer: Both types of shear are important.
From now on let us agree to drop the overbar from velocity u. Let τw be the wall 
shear stress, and let δ and U represent the thickness and velocity at the edge of the 
outer layer, y 5 δ.
 
For the wall layer, Prandtl deduced in 1930 that u must be independent of the shear 
layer thickness:
 
u 5 f (μ, τw, ρ, y) 
(6.24)
By dimensional analysis, this is equivalent to
 
u1 5 u
u* 5 F ayu*
ν b    u* 5 aτw
ρ b
1/2
 
(6.25)
Equation (6.25) is called the law of the wall, and the quantity u* is termed the friction 
velocity because it has dimensions {LT 21}, although it is not actually a fl ow velocity.
 
Subsequently, Kármán in 1933 deduced that u in the outer layer is independent of 
molecular viscosity, but its deviation from the stream velocity U must depend on the 
layer thickness δ and the other properties:

6.5  Turbulence Modeling 355
Again, by dimensional analysis we rewrite this as
U 2 u
u*
5 G ay
δb 
(6.27)
where u* has the same meaning as in Eq. (6.25). Equation (6.27) is called the 
velocity-defect law for the outer layer.
 
Both the wall law (6.25) and the defect law (6.27) are found to be accurate for a 
wide variety of experimental turbulent duct and boundary layer fl ows [Refs. 1 to 3]. 
They are different in form, yet they must overlap smoothly in the intermediate layer. 
In 1937 C. B. Millikan showed that this can be true only if the overlap layer velocity 
varies logarithmically with y:
u
u* 5 1
κ ln yu*
v
1 B  overlap layer  
(6.28)
Over the full range of turbulent smooth wall fl ows, the dimensionless constants κ and 
B are found to have the approximate values κ < 0.41 and B < 5.0. Equation (6.28) 
is called the logarithmic overlap layer.
 
Thus by dimensional reasoning and physical insight we infer that a plot of u versus 
ln y in a turbulent shear layer will show a curved wall region, a curved outer region, 
and a straight-line logarithmic overlap. Figure 6.10 shows that this is exactly the case.

laws relating velocity profi les in 
turbulent wall fl ow.

356 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
The four outer-law profi les shown all merge smoothly with the logarithmic overlap 
law but have different magnitudes because they vary in external pressure gradient. 
The wall law is unique and follows the linear viscous relation
 
u1 5 u
u* 5 yu*
ν 5 y1 
(6.29)
from the wall to about y1 5 5, thereafter curving over to merge with the logarithmic 
law at about y1 5 30.
 
Believe it or not, Fig. 6.10, which is nothing more than a shrewd correlation of 
velocity profi les, is the basis for most existing “theory” of turbulent shear fl ows. 
Notice that we have not solved any equations at all but have merely expressed the 
streamwise velocity in a neat form.
 
There is serendipity in Fig. 6.10: The logarithmic law (6.28), instead of just being 
a short overlapping link, actually approximates nearly the entire velocity profi le, 
except for the outer law when the pressure is increasing strongly downstream (as in 
a diffuser). The inner wall law typically extends over less than 2 percent of the profi le 
and can be neglected. Thus we can use Eq. (6.28) as an excellent approximation to 
solve nearly every turbulent fl ow problem presented in this and the next chapter. Many 
additional applications are given in Refs. 2 and 3.
Advanced Modeling Concepts
 
Turbulence modeling is a very active fi eld. Scores of papers have been published to 
more accurately simulate the turbulent stresses in Eq. (6.21) and their y and z com-
ponents. This research, now available in advanced texts [1, 13, 19], goes well beyond 
the present book, which is confi ned to the use of the logarithmic law (6.28) for pipe 
and boundary layer problems. For example, L. Prandtl, who invented boundary layer 
theory in 1904, later proposed an eddy viscosity model of the Reynolds stress term 
in Eq. (6.23):
 
2ρ u¿v¿ 5 τturb < μt du
dy    where    μt < ρ l2 0 du
dy 0  
(6.30)
The term μt, which is a property of the fl ow, not the fl uid, is called the eddy viscos-
ity and can be modeled in various ways. The most popular form is Eq. (6.30), where 
l is called the mixing length of the turbulent eddies (analogous to mean free path in 
molecular theory). Near a solid wall, l is approximately proportional to distance from 
the wall, and Kármán suggested
 
l < κy  where  κ 5 Kármán’s constant < 0.41 
(6.31)
As a homework assignment, Prob. P6.40, you may show that Eqs. (6.30) and (6.31) 
lead to the logarithmic law (6.28) near a wall.
 
Modern turbulence models approximate three-dimensional turbulent fl ows and 
employ additional partial differential equations for such quantities as the turbulence 
kinetic energy, the turbulent dissipation, and the six Reynolds stresses. For details, 
see Refs. 1, 13, and 19.

6.6 Turbulent Pipe Flow
 
For turbulent pipe fl ow we need not solve a differential equation but instead proceed 
with the logarithmic law, as in Example 6.5. Assume that Eq. (6.28) correlates the 
local mean velocity u(r) all the way across the pipe

the Darcy friction factor:

Introducing (6.35) and (6.36) into Eq. (6.34), changing to a base-10 logarithm, and 
rearranging, we obtain
 
1
f 1/2 < 1.99 log (Red  f 1/2) 2 1.02 
(6.37)
In other words, by simply computing the mean velocity from the logarithmic law 
correlation, we obtain a relation between the friction factor and Reynolds number for 
turbulent pipe fl ow. Prandtl derived Eq. (6.37) in 1935 and then adjusted the constants 
slightly to fi t friction data better:
 
1
f 1/2 5 2.0 log (Red  f 1/2) 2 0.8 
(6.38)
This is the accepted formula for a smooth-walled pipe. Some numerical values may 
be listed as follows:
Red 
4000

f 
0.0399 
0.0309 
0.0180 
0.0116 
0.0081 
0.0059
Thus f drops by only a factor of 5 over a 10,000-fold increase in Reynolds number. 
Equation (6.38) is cumbersome to solve if Red is known and f is wanted. There are 

6.6  Turbulent Pipe Flow 359
many alternative approximations in the literature from which f can be computed 
explicitly from Red:

However, Eq. (6.38) the preferred formula, is easily solved by computer iteration.
 
Blasius, a student of Prandtl, presented his formula in the fi rst correlation ever 
made of pipe friction versus Reynolds number. Although his formula has a limited 
range, it illustrates what was happening in Fig. 6.4 to Hagen’s 1839 pressure-drop 
data. For a horizontal pipe, from Eq. (6.39),

d V2
2g
or 
¢p < 0.158 Lρ3/4μ1/4d25/4V7/4 
(6.40)
at low turbulent Reynolds numbers. This explains why Hagen’s data for pressure drop 
begin to increase as the 1.75 power of the velocity, in Fig. 6.4. Note that Dp varies 
only slightly with viscosity, which is characteristic of turbulent fl ow. Introducing 
Q 5 1
4πd2V into Eq. (6.40), we obtain the alternative form
 
¢p < 0.241Lρ3/4μ1/4d24.75Q1.75 
(6.41)
For a given fl ow rate Q, the turbulent pressure drop decreases with diameter even 
more sharply than the laminar formula (6.12). Thus the quickest way to reduce 
required pumping pressure is to increase the pipe size, although, of course, the larger 
pipe is more expensive. Doubling the pipe size decreases Dp by a factor of about 27 
for a given Q. Compare Eq. (6.40) with Example 5.7 and Fig. 5.10.
 
The maximum velocity in turbulent pipe fl ow is given by Eq. (6.32), evaluated at 
r 5 0:
 
umax
u* < 1
κ ln Ru*
ν
1 B 
(6.42)
Combining this with Eq. (6.33), we obtain the formula relating mean velocity to 
maximum velocity:

(6.43)
Some numerical values are

0.794 
0.814 
0.852 
0.877 
0.895 
0.909
The ratio varies with the Reynolds number and is much larger than the value of 0.5 
predicted for all laminar pipe fl ow in Eq. (6.12). Thus a turbulent velocity profi le, as 
shown in Fig. 6.11b, is very fl at in the center and drops off sharply to zero at the 
wall.

360 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Effect of Rough Walls
 
It was not known until experiments in 1800 by Coulomb [6] that surface roughness 
has an effect on friction resistance. It turns out that the effect is negligible for laminar 
pipe fl ow, and all the laminar formulas derived in this section are valid for rough 
walls also. But turbulent fl ow is strongly affected by roughness. In Fig. 6.10 the linear 
viscous sublayer extends out only to y1 5 yu*/ν 5 5. Thus, compared with the 
diameter, the sublayer thickness ys is only
 
ys
d 5 5ν/u*

14.1
Red f1/2 
(6.44)
For example, at Red 5 105, f 5 0.0180, and ys/d 5 0.001, a wall roughness of about 
0.001d will break up the sublayer and profoundly change the wall law in Fig. 6.10.
 
Measurements of u(y) in turbulent rough-wall fl ow by Prandtl’s student Nikuradse 
[7] show, as in Fig. 6.12a, that a roughness height ε will force the logarithm law 
profi le outward on the abscissa by an amount approximately equal to ln ε1, where 
ε1 5 εu*/ν. The slope of the logarithm law remains the same, 1/κ, but the shift 
outward causes the constant B to be less by an amount DB < (1/κ) ln ε1.
 
Nikuradse [7] simulated roughness by gluing uniform sand grains onto the inner 
walls of the pipes. He then measured the pressure drops and fl ow rates and correlated 
friction factor versus Reynolds number in Fig. 6.12b. We see that laminar friction is 
unaffected, but turbulent friction, after an onset point, increases monotonically with 
the roughness ratio ε/d. For any given ε/d, the friction factor becomes constant 
(fully rough) at high Reynolds numbers. These points of change are certain values of 
ε1 5 εu*/ν:

The friction factor increases by 9 times as the roughness increases by a factor of 5000. 
In the transitional roughness region, sand grains behave somewhat differently from 
commercially rough pipes, so Fig. 6.12b has now been replaced by the Moody chart.
The Moody Chart
 
In 1939 to cover the transitionally rough range, Colebrook [9] combined the smooth wall 
[Eq. (6.38)] and fully rough [Eq. (6.47)] relations into a clever interpolation formula:

This is the accepted design formula for turbulent friction. It was plotted in 1944 by 
Moody [8] into what is now called the Moody chart for pipe friction (Fig. 6.13).

Fig. 6.13 The Moody chart for pipe friction with smooth and rough walls. This chart is identical to Eq. (6.48) for turbulent fl ow. (From 
Ref. 8, Source: ASME.)

6.6  Turbulent Pipe Flow 363
The Moody chart is probably the most famous and useful fi gure in fl uid mechanics. 
It is accurate to 615 percent for design calculations over the full range shown in 
Fig.  6.13. It can be used for circular and noncircular (Sec. 6.6) pipe fl ows and for 
open-channel fl ows (Chap. 10). The data can even be adapted as an approximation to 
boundary layer fl ows (Chap. 7).
 
The Moody chart gives a good visual summary of laminar and turbulent pipe fric-
tion, including roughness effects. When the writer was in college, everyone solved 
problems by carefully reading this chart. Currently, though, Eq. (6.48), though implicit 
in f, is easily solved by iteration or a direct solver. If only a calculator is available, 
the clever explicit formula given by Haaland [33] as

Red

3.7b
1.11
d  
(6.49)
varies less than 2 percent from Eq. (6.48).
 
The shaded area in the Moody chart indicates the range where transition from 
laminar to turbulent fl ow occurs. There are no reliable friction factors in this range, 
2000 , Red, , 4000. Notice that the roughness curves are nearly horizontal in the 
fully rough regime to the right of the dashed line.
 
From tests with commercial pipes, recommended values for average pipe roughness 
are listed in Table 6.1.

EXAMPLE 6.62
Compute the loss of head and pressure drop in 200 ft of horizontal 6-in-diameter asphalted 
cast iron pipe carrying water with a mean velocity of 6 ft/s.

364 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Solution
• System sketch:  See Fig. 6.7 for a horizontal pipe, with Dz 5 0 and hf proportional to Dp.
• Assumptions:  Turbulent fl ow, asphalted horizontal cast iron pipe, d 5 0.5 ft, L 5 200 ft.
• Approach: Find Red and ε/d; enter the Moody chart, Fig. 6.13; fi nd f, then hf and Dp.
• Property values: From Table A.3 for water, converting to BG units, ρ 5 998/515.38 5 
1.94 slug/ft3, μ 5 0.001/47.88 5 2.09 E-5 slug/(ft-s).
• Solution step 1: Calculate Red and the roughness ratio. As a crutch, Moody provided 
water and air values of “Vd” at the top of Fig. 6.13 to fi nd Red. Instead, let’s calculate it 
ourselves:
Red 5
ρVd
μ
5 (1.94 slug/ft3)(6 ft/s)(0.5 ft)
2.09 E-5 slug/(ft # s)
< 279,000  (turbulent)
From Table 6.1, for asphalted cast iron, ε 5 0.0004 ft. Then calculate
ε/d 5 (0.0004 ft)/(0.5 ft) 5 0.0008
• Solution step 2: Find the friction factor from the Moody chart or from Eq. (6.48). If you 
use the Moody chart, Fig. 6.13, you need practice. Find the line on the right side for ε/d 5 
0.0008 and follow it back to the left until it hits the vertical line for Red < 2.79 E5. Read, 
approximately, f < 0.02 [or compute f 5 0.0198 from Eq. (6.48).]
• Solution step 3: Calculate hf from Eq. (6.10) and Dp from Eq. (6.8) for a horizontal pipe:
 
hf  5 f L
d V2
2g 5 (0.02) a200 ft

Ans.
 
¢p 5 ρghf 5 (1.94 slug/ft3)(32.2 ft/s2)(4.5 ft) < 280 lbf/ft2 
Ans.
• Comments: In giving this example, Moody [8] stated that this estimate, even for clean 
new pipe, can be considered accurate only to about 610 percent.
EXAMPLE 6.7
Oil, with ρ 5 900 kg/m3 and ν 5 0.00001 m2/s, fl ows at 0.2 m3/s through 500 m of 200-mm-
diameter cast iron pipe. Determine (a) the head loss and (b) the pressure drop if the pipe 
slopes down at 108 in the fl ow direction.
Solution
First compute the velocity from the known fl ow rate:
V 5 Q
πR2 5 0.2 m3/s
π(0.1 m)2 5 6.4 m/s
Then the Reynolds number is
Red 5 Vd

Enter the Moody chart on the right at ε/d 5 0.0013 (you will have to interpolate), and move to 
the left to intersect with Re 5 128,000. Read f < 0.0225 [from Eq. (6.48) for these values we 
could compute f 5 0.0227]. Then the head loss is

EXAMPLE 6.8
Repeat Example 6.4 to see whether there is any possible turbulent fl ow solution for a 
smooth-walled pipe.
Solution
In Example 6.4 we estimated a head loss hf < 1.66 ft, assuming laminar exit fl ow (α < 2.0). 
For this condition the friction factor is
f 5 hf d
L 2g
V2 5 (1.66 ft) (0.004 ft)(2)(32.2 ft/s2)
(1.0 ft)(3.32 ft/s)2
< 0.0388
For laminar fl ow, Red 5 64/f 5 64/0.0388 < 1650, as we showed in Example 6.4. However, 
from the Moody chart (Fig. 6.13), we see that f 5 0.0388 also corresponds to a turbulent 
smooth-wall condition, at Red < 4500. If the fl ow actually were turbulent, we should change 
our kinetic energy factor to α < 1.06 [Eq. (3.77)], whence the corrected hf < 1.82 ft and f < 
0.0425. With f  known, we can estimate the Reynolds number from our formulas:
Red < 3250 3Eq. (6.38) 4    or    Red < 3400 3Eq. (6.39b) 4
So the fl ow might have been turbulent, in which case the viscosity of the fl uid would have been
 
μ 5
ρVd
Red
5 1.80(3.32)(0.004)
3300
5 7.2 3 1026 slug/(ft # s) 
Ans.
This is about 55 percent less than our laminar estimate in Example 6.4. The moral is to keep 
the capillary-fl ow Reynolds number below about 1000 to avoid such duplicate solutions.

6.7 Four Types of Pipe Flow 
Problems
 
The Moody chart (Fig. 6.13) can be used to solve almost any problem involving 
 friction losses in long pipe fl ows. However, many such problems involve considerable 
iteration and repeated calculations using the chart because the standard Moody chart 
is essentially a head loss chart. One is supposed to know all other variables, compute 
Red, enter the chart, fi nd f, and hence compute hf. This is one of four fundamental 
problems which are commonly encountered in pipe fl ow calculations:
1. Given d, L, and V or Q, ρ, μ, and g, compute the head loss hf (head loss problem).
2. Given d, L, hf, ρ, μ, and g, compute the velocity V or fl ow rate Q (fl ow rate 
problem).
3. Given Q, L, hf, ρ, μ, and g, compute the diameter d of the pipe (sizing problem).
4. Given Q, d, hf, ρ, μ, and g, compute the pipe length L.
Problems 1 and 4 are well suited to the Moody chart. We have to iterate to compute 
velocity or diameter because both d and V are contained in the ordinate and the 
abscissa of the chart.
 
There are two alternatives to iteration for problems of type 2 and type 3: (a) prepa-
ration of a suitable new Moody-type formula (see Probs. P6.68 and P6.73); or (b) the 
use of solver software, like Excel. Examples 6.9 and 6.11 include the Excel approach 
to these problems.
Type 2 Problem: 
Find the Flow Rate
 
Even though velocity (or fl ow rate) appears in both the ordinate and the abscissa on 
the Moody chart, iteration for turbulent fl ow is nevertheless quite fast because f varies 
so slowly with Red. In earlier editions, the writer rescaled the Colebrook formula 
(6.48) into a relation where Q could be calculated directly. That idea is now down-
sized to Problem P6.68. Example 6.9, which follows, is illustrated both by iteration 
and by an Excel solution.
EXAMPLE 6.9
Oil, with ρ 5 950 kg/m3 and ν 5 2 E-5 m2/s, fl ows through a 30-cm-diameter pipe 100 m 
long with a head loss of 8 m. The roughness ratio is ε/d 5 0.0002. Find the average veloc-
ity and fl ow rate.
Iterative Solution
By defi nition, the friction factor is known except for V:
 
f 5 hf  d
L 2g
V2 5 (8 m) a 0.3 m
100 mbc 2(9.81 m/s2)
V2
d    or    f V2 < 0.471 (SI units)
To get started, we only need to guess f, compute V 5 10.471/f , then get Red, compute a 
better f from the Moody chart, and repeat. The process converges fairly rapidly. A good fi rst 
guess is the “fully rough” value for ε/d 5 0.0002, or f < 0.014 from Fig. 6.13. The iteration 
would be as follows:
Guess f < 0.014, then V 5 10.471/0.014 5 5.80 m/s and Red 5 Vd/ν < 87,000. 
At Red 5 87,000 and ε/d 5 0.0002, compute fnew < 0.0195 [Eq. (6.48)].

6.7  Four Types of Pipe Flow Problems 367
New f < 0.0195, V 5 10.471/0.0195 5 4.91 m/s and Red 5 Vd/ν 5 73,700. At 
Red 5 73,700 and ε/d 5 0.0002, compute fnew < 0.0201 [Eq. (6.48)].
Better f < 0.0201, V 5 10.471/0.0201 5 4.84 m/s and Red < 72,600. At 
Red 5 72,600 and ε/d 5 0.0002, compute fnew < 0.0201 [Eq. (6.48)].
We have converged to three signifi cant fi gures. Thus our iterative solution is
 V 5 4.84 m/s
 
 Q 5 V aπ
4 b d2 5 (4.84) aπ
4 b (0.3)2 < 0.342 m3/s 
Ans.
The iterative approach is straightforward and not too onerous, so it is routinely used by 
 engineers. Obviously this repetitive procedure is ideal for a personal computer.
Solution by Iteration with Excel
To iterate by repeated copying in Excel, we need fi ve columns: velocity, fl ow rate, Reynolds 
number, an initial guess for f, and a calculation of f  from (ε/d) 5 0.0002 and the current value 
of Red. We modify our guess for f, in the next row, with the new value of f and calculate again, 
as shown in the following table. Since f is a slowly varying function, the process converges 
rapidly.

As shown in the hand-iterated method, the proper solution is V 5 4.84 m/s and 
Q 5 0.342 m2/s.
Type 3 Problem: 
Find the Pipe Diameter
 
The Moody chart is especially awkward for fi nding the pipe size, since d occurs in 
all three parameters f, Red, and ε/d. Further, it depends on whether we know the 
velocity or the fl ow rate. We cannot know both, or else we could immediately com-
pute d 5 14Q/(πV).
 
Let us assume that we know the fl ow rate Q. Note that this requires us to redefi ne 
the Reynolds number in terms of Q:
 
Red 5 Vd
ν 5 4Q
πdν 
(6.50)
If, instead, we knew the velocity V, we could use the fi rst form for the Reynolds 
number. The writer fi nds it convenient to solve the Darcy friction factor correlation, 
Eq. (6.10), by solving for f :
 
f 5 hf d
L 2g
V2 5 π2
8  
ghf  d5
LQ2  
(6.51)

368 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
The following two examples illustrate the iteration.
EXAMPLE 6.10
Work Example 6.9 backward, assuming that Q 5 0.342 m3/s and ε 5 0.06 mm are known 
but that d (30 cm) is unknown. Recall L 5 100 m, ρ 5 950 kg/m3, ν 5 2 E-5 m2/s, and 
hf 5 8 m.
Iterative Solution
First write the diameter in terms of the friction factor:
 
f 5 π2
8  (9.81 m/s2)(8 m)d 5
(100 m)(0.342 m3/s)2 5 8.28d 5    or    d < 0.655f 1/5 
(1)
in SI units. Also write the Reynolds number and roughness ratio in terms of the diameter:

π(2 E-5 m2/s)d 5 21,800
d
 
(2)
 
ε
d 5 6 E-5 m
d
 
(3)
Guess f, compute d from (1), then compute Red from (2) and ε/d from (3), and compute a better 
f from the Moody chart or Eq. (6.48). Repeat until (fairly rapid) convergence. Having no initial 
estimate for f, the writer guesses f < 0.03 (about in the middle of the turbulent portion of the 
Moody chart). The following calculations result:
 f < 0.03    d < 0.655(0.03)1/5 < 0.325 m
 Red < 21,800
0.325 < 67,000    ε
d < 1.85 E-4
Eq. (6.48): 
 fnew < 0.0203    then    dnew < 0.301 m
 Red,new < 72,500    ε
d < 2.0 E-4
Eq. (6.48): 
 fbetter < 0.0201    and    d 5 0.300 m 
Ans.
The procedure has converged to the correct diameter of 30 cm given in Example 6.9.
Solution by Iteration with Excel
To iterate by repeated copying in Excel, we need fi ve columns: ε/d, friction factor, Reynolds 
number, diameter d, and an initial guess for f. With the guess for f, we calculate d < 0.655f 1/5, 
Red < 21,800/d, and ε/d 5 (0.00006 m)/d. Replace the guessed f with the new f. Thus Excel 
is doing the work of our previous hand calculation:

EXAMPLE 6.11
A smooth plastic pipe is to be designed to carry 8 ft3/s of water at 208C through 1000 ft of 
horizontal pipe with an exit at 15 lbf/in2. The pressure drop is to be approximately 250 lbf/in2. 
Determine (a) the proper diameter for this pipe and (b) whether a Schedule 40 is suitable 
if the pipe material has an allowable stress of 8000 lbf/in2.
Solution by Excel Iteration
Assumptions: Steady turbulent fl ow, smooth walls. For water, take ρ 5 1.94 slug/ft3 and

Ans. (a)

370 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Part (b) 
Check to see if Schedule 40 is strong enough. The maximum pressure occurs at the pipe 
 entrance: pmax 5 pexit + Dp 5 15 + 250 5 265 lb/in2. The schedule number is thus
Schedule number 5 (1000) (maximum pressure)
(allowable stress)
5 (1000)a 265 psi
8000 psib < 33
Schedule 30 is too weak for this pressure, so choose a Schedule 40 pipe. 
Ans. (b)
Commercial Pipe Sizes
 
In solving a problem to fi nd the pipe diameter, we should note that commercial pipes 
are made only in certain sizes. Table 6.2 gives nominal and actual sizes of pipes in 
the United States. The term Schedule 40 is a measure of the pipe thickness and its 
resistance to stress caused by internal fl uid pressure. If P is the internal fl uid pressure 
and S is the allowable stress of the pipe material, then the schedule number 5 (1000)
(P/S). Commercial schedules vary from 5 to 160, but 40 and 80 are by far the most 
popular. Example 6.11 is a typical application.
Type 4 Problem: 
Find the Pipe Length
 
In designing piping systems, it is desirable to estimate the appropriate pipe length for 
a given pipe diameter, pump power, and fl ow rate. The pump head will match the 
piping head loss. If minor losses, Sec. 6.9, are neglected, the (horizontal) pipe length 
follows from Darcy’s formula (6.10):
 
hpump 5 Power
ρgQ 5 hf 5 f L
d
 V2
2g 
(6.52)
With Q, d, and ε known, we may compute Red and f, after which L is obtained 
from the formula. Note that pump effi ciency varies strongly with fl ow rate 
(Chap.  11). Thus, it is important to match pipe length to the pump’s region of 
maximum  effi ciency.

horizontal pipe at V 5 6 ft/s. What is the proper pipe length to match these conditions?

6.8 Flow in Noncircular Ducts3 
If the duct is noncircular, the analysis of fully developed fl ow follows that of the 
circular pipe but is more complicated algebraically. For laminar fl ow, one can solve 
the exact equations of continuity and momentum. For turbulent fl ow, the logarithm 
law velocity profi le can be used, or (better and simpler) the hydraulic diameter is an 
excellent approximation.
The Hydraulic Diameter
 
For a noncircular duct, the control volume concept of Fig. 6.7 is still valid, but the 
cross-sectional area A does not equal πR2 and the cross-sectional perimeter wetted by 
the shear stress 3 does not equal 2πR. The momentum equation (6.9a) thus becomes
¢p A 1 ρgA ¢L sin ϕ 2 τw3¢L 5 0
or 
hf 5 ¢p
ρg 1 ¢z 5 τw
ρg ¢L
A/3 
(6.53)
3This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

372 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Comparing this to Eq. (6.9b), we see that A/3 takes the place of one-fourth of the 
pipe diameter for a circular cross section. We defi ne the friction factor in terms of 
average shear stress:
 
fNCD 5 8τw
ρV2 
(6.54)
where NCD stands for noncircular duct and V 5 Q/A as usual, Eq. (6.53) becomes
 
hf 5 f L
Dh
 V2
2g  
(6.55)
This is equivalent to Eq. (6.10) for pipe fl ow except that d is replaced by Dh. Therefore, 
we customarily defi ne the hydraulic diameter as
 
Dh 5 4A
3 5
4 3 area
wetted perimeter 
(6.56)
We should stress that the wetted perimeter includes all surfaces acted upon by the 
shear stress. For example, in a circular annulus, both the outer and the inner perimeter 
should be added.
 
We would therefore expect by dimensional analysis that this friction factor f, based 
on hydraulic diameter as in Eq. (6.55), would correlate with the Reynolds number 
and roughness ratio based on the hydraulic diameter
 
f 5 F aVDh
ν , ε
Dh
b 
(6.57)
and this is the way the data are correlated. But we should not necessarily expect the 
Moody chart (Fig. 6.13) to hold exactly in terms of this new length scale. And it does 
not, but it is surprisingly accurate:

Now let us look at some particular cases.
Flow between Parallel Plates
 
Probably the simplest noncircular duct fl ow is fully developed fl ow between parallel 
plates a distance 2h apart, as in Fig. 6.14. As noted in the fi gure, the width b W h, 
so the fl ow is essentially two-dimensional; that is, u 5 u(y) only. The hydraulic 
diameter is
 
Dh 5 4A
3 5 lim
bSq 4(2bh)
2b 1 4h 5 4h 
(6.59)
that is, twice the distance between the plates. The pressure gradient is constant, 
(2dp/dx) 5 Dp/L, where L is the length of the channel along the x axis.

Laminar Flow Solution
 
The laminar solution was given in Sec. 4.10, in connection with Fig. 4.16b. Let us 
review those results here:

Now use the head loss to establish the laminar friction factor:
 
flam 5
hf
(L/Dh)(V2/2g) 5
96μ
ρV(4h) 5 96
ReDh
 
(6.61)
Thus, if we could not work out the laminar theory and chose to use the approximation 
f < 64/ReDh, we would be 33 percent low. The hydraulic-diameter approximation is 
relatively crude in laminar fl ow, as Eq. (6.58) states.
 
Just as in circular-pipe fl ow, the laminar solution above becomes unstable at about 
ReDh < 2000; transition occurs and turbulent fl ow results.
Turbulent Flow Solution
 
For turbulent fl ow between parallel plates, we can again use the logarithm law, 
Eq.  (6.28), as an approximation across the entire channel, using not y but a wall 
coordinate Y, as shown in Fig. 6.14:
 
u(Y)

374 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Recalling that V/u* 5 (8/f)1/2, we see that Eq. (6.63) is equivalent to a parallel-plate 
friction law. Rearranging and cleaning up the constant terms, we obtain
 
1
f 1/2 < 2.0 log (ReDh   f 1/2) 2 1.19 
(6.64)
where we have introduced the hydraulic diameter Dh 5 4h. This is remarkably close 
to the smooth-wall pipe friction law, Eq. (6.38). Therefore we conclude that the use 
of the hydraulic diameter in this turbulent case is quite successful. That turns out to 
be true for other noncircular turbulent fl ows also.
 
Equation (6.64) can be brought into exact agreement with the pipe law by rewriting 
it in the form
 
1
f 1/2 5 2.0 log (0.64 ReDh   f 1/2) 2 0.8 
(6.65)
Thus the turbulent friction is predicted most accurately when we use an effective 
diameter Deff equal to 0.64 times the hydraulic diameter. The effect on f itself is much 
less, about 10 percent at most. We can compare with Eq. (6.66) for laminar fl ow, 
which predicted
Parallel plates: 
Deff 5 64
96Dh 5 2
3Dh 
(6.66)
This close resemblance (0.64Dh versus 0.667Dh) occurs so often in noncircular 
duct fl ow that we take it to be a general rule for computing turbulent friction 
in ducts:
Deff 5 Dh 5 4A
3   reasonable accuracy
 
 Deff 5 Dh

( f ReDh)laminar theory  better accuracy 
(6.67)
Jones [10] shows that the effective-laminar-diameter idea collapses all data for rect-
angular ducts of arbitrary height-to-width ratio onto the Moody chart for pipe fl ow. 
We recommend this idea for all noncircular ducts.
EXAMPLE 6.13
Fluid fl ows at an average velocity of 6 ft/s between horizontal parallel plates a distance of 
2.4 in apart. Find the head loss and pressure drop for each 100 ft of length for ρ 5 1.9

Since there is no change in elevation,
 
¢p 5 ρghf 5 1.9(32.2)(2.42) 5 148 lbf/ft2 
Ans. (a)
This is the head loss and pressure drop per 100 ft of channel. For more accuracy, take 
Deff 5 64
96Dh from laminar theory; then
Reeff 5 64
96(120,000) 5 80,000
and from the Moody chart read f < 0.0189 for smooth walls. Thus a better estimate is
hf 5 0.0189 100
0.4  (6.0)2
2(32.2) 5 2.64 ft
and 
¢p 5 1.9(32.2)(2.64) 5 161 lbf/ft2 
Better ans. (a)
The more accurate formula predicts friction about 9 percent higher.
Part (a) 
Compute μ 5 ρν 5 0.0038 slug/(ft ? s). The Reynolds number is 6.0(0.4)/0.002 5 1200; 
therefore the fl ow is laminar, since Re is less than 2300.
 
You could use the laminar fl ow friction factor, Eq. (6.61)

Alternately you can fi nesse the Reynolds number and go directly to the appropriate laminar

Flow through a Concentric 
Annulus
 
Consider steady axial laminar fl ow in the annular space between two concentric 
 cylinders, as in Fig. 6.15. There is no slip at the inner (r 5 b) and outer radius (r 5 a). 
For u 5 u(r) only, the governing relation is Eq. (D.7) in Appendix D:

(6.68)

376 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
Integrate this twice:

The constants are found from the two no-slip conditions:

The velocity profi le u(r) resembles a parabola wrapped around in a circle to form a 
split doughnut, as in Fig. 6.15.
 
It is confusing to base the friction factor on the wall shear because there are two 
shear stresses, the inner stress being greater than the outer. It is better to defi ne f with 
respect to the head loss, as in Eq. (6.55),

It is twice the clearance, rather like the parallel-plate result of twice the distance 
between plates [Eq. (6.59)].

Substituting hf, Dh, and V into Eq. (6.71), we fi nd that the friction factor for laminar 
fl ow in a concentric annulus is of the form
 
f 5 64ζ
ReDh    ζ 5
(a 2 b)2(a2 2 b2)
a4 2 b4 2 (a2 2 b2)2/ln (a/b) 
(6.73)
The dimensionless term z is a sort of correction factor for the hydraulic diameter. We 
could rewrite Eq. (6.73) as
Concentric annulus: 
f 5 64
Reeff    Reeff 5 1
ζ ReDh 
(6.74)
Some numerical values of f ReDh and Deff/Dh 5 1/z are given in Table 6.3. Again, 
laminar annular fl ow becomes unstable at ReDh < 2000.
 
For turbulent fl ow through a concentric annulus, the analysis might proceed by 
patching together two logarithmic law profi les, one going out from the inner wall 
to meet the other coming in from the outer wall. We omit such a scheme here and 
proceed directly to the friction factor. According to the general rule proposed in 
Eq. (6.58), turbulent friction is predicted with excellent accuracy by replacing d in 
the Moody chart with Deff 5 2(a 2 b)/z, with values listed in Table 6.3.4 This idea 
includes roughness also (replace ε/d in the chart with ε/Deff). For a quick design 
number with about 10 percent accuracy, one can simply use the hydraulic diameter 
Dh 5 2(a 2 b).
EXAMPLE 6.14
What should the reservoir level h be to maintain a fl ow of 0.01 m3/s through the commer-
cial steel annulus 30 m long shown in Fig. E6.14? Neglect entrance effects and take ρ 5 
1000 kg/m3 and ν 5 1.02 3 1026 m2/s for water.
4Jones and Leung [44] show that data for annular flow also satisfy the effective-laminar- 
diameter idea.
Solution
• Assumptions: Fully developed annulus fl ow, minor losses neglected.
• Approach: Determine the Reynolds number, then fi nd f and hf and thence h.

• Comments: Note that we do not replace Dh with Deff in the head loss term fL/Dh, which 
comes from a momentum balance and requires hydraulic diameter. If we used the simpler 
friction estimate, f < 0.0232, we would obtain h < 3.72 m, or about 9 percent lower.
Other Noncircular Cross Sections  
In principle, any duct cross section can be solved analytically for the laminar fl ow 
velocity distribution, volume fl ow, and friction factor. This is because any cross sec-
tion can be mapped onto a circle by the methods of complex variables, and other 
powerful analytical techniques are also available. Many examples are given by White 
[3, pp. 112–115], Berker [11], and Olson [12]. Reference 34 is devoted entirely to 
laminar duct fl ow.
 
In general, however, most unusual duct sections have strictly academic and not 
commercial value. We list here only the rectangular and isosceles-triangular sections, 
in Table 6.4, leaving other cross sections for you to fi nd in the references.

6.8  Flow in Noncircular Ducts 379
 
For turbulent fl ow in a duct of unusual cross section, one should replace d with Dh 
on the Moody chart if no laminar theory is available. If laminar results are known, such 
as Table 6.4, replace d with Deff 5 [64/(fRe)]Dh for the particular geometry of the duct.
 
For laminar fl ow in rectangles and triangles, the wall friction varies greatly, being 
largest near the midpoints of the sides and zero in the corners. In turbulent fl ow through 
the same sections, the shear is nearly constant along the sides, dropping off sharply to 
zero in the corners. This is because of the phenomenon of turbulent secondary fl ow, in 
which there are nonzero mean velocities v and w in the plane of the cross section. Some 
measurements of axial velocity and secondary fl ow patterns are shown in Fig. 6.16, as 
sketched by Nikuradse in his 1926 dissertation. The secondary fl ow “cells” drive the 
mean fl ow toward the corners, so that the axial velocity contours are similar to the 
cross section and the wall shear is nearly constant. This is why the hydraulic-diameter 
concept is so successful for turbulent fl ow. Laminar fl ow in a straight noncircular duct 
has no secondary fl ow. An accurate theoretical prediction of turbulent secondary fl ow 
has yet to be achieved, although numerical models are often successful [36].

6.9 Minor or Local Losses in 
Pipe Systems
 
For any pipe system, in addition to the Moody-type friction loss computed for the 
length of pipe, there are additional so-called minor losses or local losses due to
1. Pipe entrance or exit.
2. Sudden expansion or contraction.
3. Bends, elbows, tees, and other fi ttings.
4. Valves, open or partially closed.
5. Gradual expansions or contractions.
The losses may not be so minor; for example, a partially closed valve can cause a 
greater pressure drop than a long pipe.
 
Since the fl ow pattern in fi ttings and valves is quite complex, the theory is very 
weak. The losses are commonly measured experimentally and correlated with the pipe 
fl ow parameters. The data, especially for valves, are somewhat dependent on the 
particular manufacturer’s design, so that the values listed here must be taken as aver-
age design estimates [15, 16, 35, 43, 46].
 
The measured minor loss is usually given as a ratio of the head loss hm 5 Dp/(ρg) 
through the device to the velocity head V2/(2g) of the associated piping system:
Loss coefficient K 5
hm
V2/(2g) 5 ¢p

2ρV2 
(6.75)
Although K is dimensionless, it often is not correlated in the literature with the Reyn-
olds number and roughness ratio but rather simply with the raw size of the pipe in, 
say, inches. Almost all data are reported for turbulent fl ow conditions.
 
A single pipe system may have many minor losses. Since all are correlated with 
V2/(2g), they can be summed into a single total system loss if the pipe has constant 
diameter:
¢htot 5 hf 1 ghm 5 V2
2g afL
d 1 gKb
 
(6.76)

6.9  Minor or Local Losses in Pipe Systems 381
Note, however, that we must sum the losses separately if the pipe size changes so 
that V2 changes. The length L in Eq. (6.76) is the total length of the pipe axis.
 
There are many different valve designs in commercial use. Figure 6.17 shows 
fi ve typical designs: (a) the gate, which slides down across the section; (b) the globe, 
which closes a hole in a special insert; (c) the angle, similar to a globe but with a 
908 turn; (d) the swing-check valve, which allows only one-way fl ow; and (e) the 
disk, which closes the section with a circular gate. The globe, with its tortuous fl ow 
path, has the highest losses when fully open. Many excellent details about these and 
other valves are given in the handbooks by Skousen [35] and Crane Co. [52].
 
Table 6.5 lists loss coeffi cients K for four types of valve, three angles of elbow 
fi tting, and two tee connections. Fittings may be connected by either internal screws 
or fl anges, hence the two listings. We see that K generally decreases with pipe size, 
which is consistent with the higher Reynolds number and decreased roughness ratio 
of large pipes. We stress that Table 6.5 represents losses  averaged among various 
manufacturers, so there is an uncertainty as high as 650 percent.
 
In addition, most of the data in Table 6.5 are relatively old [15, 16] and therefore 
based on fi ttings manufactured in the 1950s. Modern forged and molded fi ttings may 
yield somewhat different loss factors, often less than those listed in Table 6.5. An 
example, shown in Fig. 6.18a, gives recent data [48] for fairly short (bend-radius/elbow-
diameter 5 1.2) fl anged 908 elbows. The elbow diameter was 1.69 in. Notice fi rst that 
K is plotted versus Reynolds number, rather than versus the raw (dimensional) pipe

diameters in Table 6.5, and therefore Fig. 6.18a has more generality. Then notice that 
the K values of 0.23 6 0.05 are signifi cantly less than the values for 908 elbows in 
Table 6.5, indicating smoother walls and/or better design. One may conclude that 
(1) Table 6.5 data are probably conservative and (2) loss factors are highly dependent 
on actual design and manufacturing factors, with Table 6.5 serving only as a rough guide.
 
The valve losses in Table 6.5 are for the fully open condition. Losses can be much 
higher for a partially open valve. Figure 6.18b gives average losses for three valves

as a function of “percentage open,” as defi ned by the opening-distance ratio h/D (see 
Fig. 6.17 for the geometries). Again we should warn of a possible uncertainty of 650 
percent. Of all minor losses, valves, because of their complex geometry, are most 
sensitive to manufacturers’ design details. For more accuracy, the particular design 
and manufacturer should be consulted [35].
 
The butterfl y valve of Fig. 6.19a is a stem-mounted disk that, when closed, seats 
against an O-ring or compliant seal near the pipe surface. A single 908 turn opens the 
valve completely, hence the design is ideal for controllable quick-opening and quick-
closing situations such as occur in fi re protection and the electric power industry. 
However, considerable dynamic torque is needed to close these valves, and losses are 
high when the valves are nearly closed.
 
Figure 6.19b shows butterfl y-valve loss coeffi cients as a function of the opening 
angle θ for turbulent fl ow conditions (θ 5 0 is closed). The losses are huge when the

opening is small, and K drops off nearly exponentially with the opening angle. There 
is a factor of 2 spread among the various manufacturers. Note that K in Fig. 6.19b 
is, as usual, based on the average pipe velocity V 5 Q/A, not on the increased velocity 
of the fl ow as it passes through the narrow valve passage.
 
A bend or curve in a pipe, as in Fig. 6.20, always induces a loss larger than the 
simple straight-pipe Moody friction loss, due to fl ow separation on the curved walls 
and a swirling secondary fl ow arising from the centripetal acceleration. The smooth-
wall loss coeffi cients K in Fig. 6.20, from the data of Ito [49], are for total loss, 
including Moody friction effects. The separation and secondary fl ow losses decrease 
with R/d, while the Moody losses increase because the bend length increases. The 
curves in Fig. 6.20 thus show a minimum where the two effects cross. Ito [49] gives 
a curve-fi t formula for the 908 bend in turbulent fl ow:

(6.80a)
The formula accounts for Reynolds number, which equals 200,000 in Fig. 6.20. Com-
prehensive reviews of curved-pipe fl ow, for both laminar and turbulent fl ow, are given 
by Berger et al. [53] and for 908 bends by Spedding et al. [54].
 
As shown in Fig. 6.21, entrance losses are highly dependent on entrance geometry, 
but exit losses are not. Sharp edges or protrusions in the entrance cause large zones 
of fl ow separation and large losses. A little rounding goes a long way, and a well-
rounded entrance (r 5 0.2d) has a nearly negligible loss K 5 0.05. At a submerged 
exit, on the other hand, the fl ow simply passes out of the pipe into the large down-
stream reservoir and loses all its velocity head due to viscous dissipation. Therefore 
K 5 1.0 for all submerged exits, no matter how well rounded.
 
If the entrance is from a fi nite reservoir, it is termed a sudden contraction (SC) 
between two sizes of pipe. If the exit is to fi nite-sized pipe, it is termed a sudden 
expansion (SE). The losses for both are graphed in Fig. 6.22. For the sudden expansion,

the shear stress in the corner separated fl ow, or deadwater region, is negligible, so that

Note that K is based on the velocity head in the small pipe. Equation (6.77) is in 
excellent agreement with experiment.
 
For the sudden contraction, however, fl ow separation in the downstream pipe 
causes the main stream to contract through a minimum diameter dmin, called the vena 
contracta, as sketched in Fig. 6.22. Because the theory of the vena contracta is not 
well developed, the loss coeffi cient in the fi gure for sudden contraction is experimen-
tal. It fi ts the empirical formula

up to the value d/D 5 0.76, above which it merges into the sudden-expansion predic-

Gradual Expansion—The Diffuser  
As fl ow enters a gradual expansion or diffuser, such as the conical geometry of Fig. 6.23, 
the velocity drops and the pressure rises. An effi cient diffuser reduces the pumping 
power required. Head loss can be large, due to fl ow separation on the walls, if the 
cone angle is too great. A thinner entrance boundary layer, as in Fig. 6.6, causes

a slightly smaller loss than a fully developed inlet fl ow. The fl ow loss is a combina-
tion of nonideal pressure recovery plus wall friction. Some  correlating curves are 
shown in Fig. 6.23. The loss coeffi cient K is based on the velocity head in the inlet 
(small) pipe and depends upon cone angle 2θ and the diffuser diameter ratio d1/d2. 
There is scatter in the reported data [15, 16]. The curves in Fig. 6.23 are based on a 
correlation by A. H. Gibson [50], cited in Ref. 15:

For large angles, 2θ . 458, drop the coeffi cient (2.61 sin θ), which leaves us with a 
loss equivalent to the sudden expansion of Eq. (6.77). As seen, the formula is in 
reasonable agreement with the data from Ref. 16. The minimum loss lies in the region 
58 , 2θ , 158, which is the best geometry for an effi cient diffuser. For angles less 
than 58, the diffuser is too long and has too much friction. Angles greater than 158 
cause fl ow separation, resulting in poor pressure recovery. Professor Gordon  Holloway 
provided the writer a recent example, where an improved diffuser design reduced the 
power requirement of a wind tunnel by 40 percent (100 hp decrease!). We shall look 
again at diffusers in Sec. 6.11, using the data of Ref. 14.

Laminar Flow Minor Losses
 
The data in Table 6.5 are for turbulent fl ow in fi ttings. If the fl ow is laminar, a dif-
ferent form of loss occurs, which is proportional to V, not V 2. By analogy with Eqs. 
(6.12) for Poiseuille fl ow, the laminar minor loss takes the form
Klam 5 ¢ploss d

6.10  Multiple-Pipe Systems 389
Laminar minor losses are just beginning to be studied, due to increased interest in 
micro- and nano-fl ows in tubes. They can be substantial, comparable to the Poiseuille 
loss. Professor Bruce Finlayson, of the University of Washington, kindly provided the 
writer with new data in the following table:

upon the velocity in the smaller section.
6.10 Multiple-Pipe Systems5
 
If you can solve the equations for one-pipe systems, you can solve them all; but when 
systems contain two or more pipes, certain basic rules make the calculations very 
smooth. Any resemblance between these rules and the rules for handling electric 
circuits is not coincidental.
 
Figure 6.24 shows three examples of multiple-pipe systems.
Pipes in Series
 
The fi rst is a set of three (or more) pipes in series. Rule 1 is that the fl ow rate is the 
same in all pipes:
 
Q1 5 Q2 5 Q3 5 const 
(6.80)
or 
V1d2
1 5 V2d2
2 5 V3d2
3 
(6.81)
Rule 2 is that the total head loss through the system equals the sum of the head loss 
in each pipe:
 
¢hASB 5 ¢h1 1 ¢h2 1 ¢h3 
(6.82)
In terms of the friction and minor losses in each pipe, we could rewrite this as
¢hASB 5 V2
1
2g af1L1
d1
1 a K1b 1 V2
2
2g af2L2
d2
1 a K2b
 
1 V2
3
2g af3L3
d3
1 a K3b 
(6.83)
and so on for any number of pipes in the series. Since V2 and V3 are proportional to 
V1 from Eq. (6.81), Eq. (6.83) is of the form
 
¢hASB 5 V2
1
2g (α0 1 α1 f1 1 α2 f2 1 α3 f3) 
(6.84)
5This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

where the αi are dimensionless constants. If the fl ow rate is given, we can evaluate 
the right-hand side and hence the total head loss. If the head loss is given, a little 
iteration is needed, since f1, f2, and f3 all depend on V1 through the Reynolds number. 
Begin by calculating f1, f2, and f3, assuming fully rough fl ow, and the solution for V1 
will converge with one or two iterations.

This is the form that was hinted at in Eq. (6.84). It seems to be dominated by the third pipe 
loss 32,000f3. Begin by estimating f1, f2, and f3 from the Moody-chart fully rough regime:
f1 5 0.0262    f2 5 0.0234    f3 5 0.0304
Substitute in Eq. (1) to fi nd V2
1 < 2g(20.3)/(33 1 185 1 973). The fi rst estimate thus is V1 5 
0.58 m/s, from which
Re1 < 45,400    Re2 5 60,500    Re3 5 90,800
Hence, from the Moody chart,
f1 5 0.0288    f2 5 0.0260    f3 5 0.0314

Ans.
A second iteration gives Q 5 10.22 m3/h, a negligible change.
Pipes in Parallel
 
The second multiple-pipe system is the parallel fl ow case shown in Fig. 6.24b. Here the 
pressure drop is the same in each pipe, and the total fl ow is the sum of the individual fl ows:
 
¢hASB 5 ¢h1 5 ¢h2 5 ¢h3 
(6.85a)
 
Q 5 Q1 1 Q2 1 Q3 
(6.85b)
If the total head loss is known, it is straightforward to solve for Qi in each pipe and 
sum them, as will be seen in Example 6.18. The reverse problem, of determining SQi 
when hf is known, requires iteration. Each pipe is related to hf by the Moody relation 
hf 5 f(L/d)(V2/2g) 5 fQ2/C, where C 5 π2gd5/8L. Thus each pipe has nearly quadratic 
nonlinear parallel resistance, and head loss is related to total fl ow rate by

Since the fi vary with Reynolds number and roughness ratio, one begins Eq. (6.86) by 
guessing values of fi (fully rough values are recommended) and calculating a fi rst estimate 
of hf. Then each pipe yields a fl ow-rate estimate Qi < (Cihf/fi)1/2 and hence a new Reynolds 
number and a better estimate of fi. Then repeat Eq. (6.86) to convergence.
 
It should be noted that both of these parallel-pipe cases—fi nding either SQ or 
hf  —are easily solved by Excel if reasonable guesses are given.
EXAMPLE 6.18
Assume that the same three pipes in Example 6.17 are now in parallel with the same total 
head loss of 20.3 m. Compute the total fl ow rate Q, neglecting minor losses.
Solution
From Eq. (6.85a) we can solve for each V separately:
 
20.3 m 5 V2

2g 2500f2 5 V2

Guess fully rough fl ow in pipe 1: f1 5 0.0262, V1 5 3.49 m/s; hence Re1 5 V1d1/ν 5 273,000. 
From the Moody chart read f1 5 0.0267; recompute V1 5 3.46 m/s, Q1 5 62.5 m3/h.
 
Next guess for pipe 2: f2 < 0.0234, V2 < 2.61 m/s; then Re2 5 153,000, and hence 
f2 5 0.0246, V2 5 2.55 m/s, Q2 5 25.9 m3/h.
 
Finally guess for pipe 3: f3 < 0.0304, V3 < 2.56 m/s; then Re3 5 100,000, and hence 
f3 5 0.0313, V3 5 2.52 m/s, Q3 5 11.4 m3/h.
 
This is satisfactory convergence. The total fl ow rate is
 
Q 5 Q1 1 Q2 1 Q3 5 62.5 1 25.9 1 11.4 5 99.8 m3/h 
Ans.
These three pipes carry 10 times more fl ow in parallel than they do in series.
 
This example may be solved by Excel iteration using the Colebrook-formula procedure 
outlined in Ex. 6.9. Each pipe is a separate iteration of friction factor, Reynolds number, and 
fl ow rate. The pipes are rough, so only one iteration is needed. Here are the Excel results:

Three-Reservoir Junction
 
Consider the third example of a three-reservoir pipe junction, as in Fig. 6.24c. If all 
fl ows are considered positive toward the junction, then
 
Q1 1 Q2 1 Q3 5 0 
(6.87)
which obviously implies that one or two of the fl ows must be away from the junction. 
The pressure must change through each pipe so as to give the same static pressure pJ 
at the junction. In other words, let the HGL at the junction have the elevation
hJ 5 zJ 1 pJ
ρg
where pJ is in gage pressure for simplicity. Then the head loss through each, assuming 
p1 5 p2 5 p3 5 0 (gage) at each reservoir surface, must be such that
 ¢h1 5 V2

2g f1L1

(6.88)
 ¢h3 5 V2
3
2g f3L3
d3
5 z3 2 hJ
We guess the position hJ and solve Eqs. (6.88) for V1, V2, and V3 and hence Q1, Q2, 
and Q3, iterating until the fl ow rates balance at the junction according to Eq. (6.87). 
If we guess hJ too high, the sum Q1 1 Q2 1 Q3 will be negative and the remedy is 
to reduce hJ, and vice versa.
EXAMPLE 6.19
Take the same three pipes as in Example 6.17, and assume that they connect three reservoirs 
at these surface elevations
 
z1 5 20 m  z2 5 100 m  z3 5 40 m
Find the resulting fl ow rates in each pipe, neglecting minor losses.
Solution
As a fi rst guess, take hJ equal to the middle reservoir height, z3 5 hJ 5 40 m. This saves one 
calculation (Q3 5 0) and enables us to get the lay of the land:

Since the sum of the fl ow rates toward the junction is negative, we guessed hJ too high.

This is positive SQ, and so we can linearly interpolate to get an accurate guess: hJ < 34.3 m.

SQ 5 0.7
This is close enough; hence we calculate that the fl ow rate is 52.4 m3/h toward reservoir 3, 
balanced by 47.1 m3/h away from reservoir 1 and 6.0 m3/h away from reservoir 3.
 
One further iteration with this problem would give hJ 5 34.53 m, resulting in 
Q1 5 252.8, Q2 5 47.0, and Q3 5 5.8 m3/h, so that SQ 5 0 to three-place accuracy. Peda-
gogically speaking, we would then be exhausted.

or even a city. This network is quite complex algebraically but follows the same 
basic rules:
1. The net fl ow into any junction must be zero.
2. The net pressure change around any closed loop must be zero. In other words, 
the HGL at each junction must have one and only one elevation.
3. All pressure changes must satisfy the Moody and minor-loss friction correlations.
By supplying these rules to each junction and independent loop in the network, one obtains 
a set of simultaneous equations for the fl ow rates in each pipe leg and the HGL (or pres-
sure) at each junction. Solution may then be obtained by numerical iteration, as fi rst 
developed in a hand calculation technique by Prof. Hardy Cross in 1936 [17]. Computer 
solution of pipe network problems is now quite common and is covered in at least one 
specialized text [18]. Network analysis is quite useful for real water distribution systems 
if well calibrated with the actual system head loss data.
6.11 Experimental Duct Flows: 
Diffuser Performance6
 
The Moody chart is such a great correlation for tubes of any cross section with any 
roughness or fl ow rate that we may be deluded into thinking that the world of internal 
fl ow prediction is at our feet. Not so. The theory is reliable only for ducts of constant 
cross section. As soon as the section varies, we must rely principally on experiment 
to determine the fl ow properties. As mentioned many times before, experimentation 
is a vital part of fl uid mechanics.
 
Literally thousands of papers in the literature report experimental data for specifi c 
internal and external viscous fl ows. We have already seen several examples:
1. Vortex shedding from a cylinder (Fig. 5.2).
2. Drag of a sphere and a cylinder (Fig. 5.3).
3. Hydraulic model of a dam spillway (Fig. 5.9).
4. Rough-wall pipe fl ows (Fig. 6.12).
5. Secondary fl ow in ducts (Fig. 6.16).
6. Minor duct loss coeffi cients (Sec. 6.9).
Chapter 7 will treat a great many more external fl ow experiments, especially in 
Sec. 7.6. Here we shall show data for one type of internal fl ow, the diffuser.
Diffuser Performance
 
A diffuser, shown in Fig. 6.26a and b, is an expansion or area increase intended to 
reduce velocity in order to recover the pressure head of the fl ow. Rouse and Ince [6] 
relate that it may have been invented by customers of the early Roman (about 100 
a.d.) water supply system, where water fl owed continuously and was billed according 
to pipe size. The ingenious customers discovered that they could increase the fl ow 
rate at no extra cost by fl aring the outlet section of the pipe.
 
Engineers have always designed diffusers to increase pressure and reduce kinetic 
energy of ducted fl ows, but until about 1950, diffuser design was a combination of art, 
luck, and vast amounts of empiricism. Small changes in design parameters caused large 
changes in performance. The Bernoulli equation seemed highly suspect as a useful tool.
6This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

396 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
 
Neglecting losses and gravity effects, the incompressible Bernoulli equation 
 predicts that
 
p 1 1
2ρV2 5 p0 5 const 
(6.89)
where p0 is the stagnation pressure the fl uid would achieve if the fl uid were slowed 
to rest (V 5 0) without losses.
 
The basic output of a diffuser is the pressure-recovery coeffi cient Cp, defi ned as
 
Cp 5 pe 2 pt
p0t 2 pt
 
(6.90)
where subscripts e and t mean the exit and the throat (or inlet), respectively. Higher 
Cp means better performance.
 
Consider the fl at-walled diffuser in Fig. 6.26a, where section 1 is the inlet 
and section 2 the exit. Application of Bernoulli’s equation (6.89) to this diffuser 
 predicts that

Meanwhile, steady one-dimensional continuity would require that
 
Q 5 V1A1 5 V2A2 
(6.92)
Combining (6.91) and (6.92), we can write the performance in terms of the area ratio 
AR 5 A2/A1, which is a basic parameter in diffuser design:
 
Cp,frictionless 5 1 2 (AR)22 
(6.93)
A typical design would have AR 5 5:1, for which Eq. (6.93) predicts Cp 5 0.96, or 
nearly full recovery. But, in fact, measured values of Cp for this area ratio [14] are 
only as high as 0.86 and can be as low as 0.24.
 
The basic reason for the discrepancy is fl ow separation, as sketched in Fig. 6.27b. 
The increasing pressure in the diffuser is an unfavorable gradient (Sec. 7.5), which 
causes the viscous boundary layers to break away from the walls and greatly reduces 
the performance. Computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) can now predict this 
behavior.

398 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
 
As an added complication to boundary layer separation, the fl ow patterns in a dif-
fuser are highly variable and were considered mysterious and erratic until 1955, when 
Kline revealed the structure of these patterns with fl ow visualization techniques in a 
simple water channel.
 
A complete stability map of diffuser fl ow patterns was published in 1962 by 
Fox and Kline [21], as shown in Fig. 6.26c. There are four basic regions. Below 
line aa there is steady viscous fl ow, no separation, and moderately good perfor-
mance. Note that even a very short diffuser will separate, or stall, if its half-angle 
is greater than 108.
 
Between lines aa and bb is a transitory stall pattern with strongly unsteady fl ow. 
Best performance (highest Cp) occurs in this region. The third pattern, between bb 
and cc, is steady bistable stall from one wall only. The stall pattern may fl ip-fl op from 
one wall to the other, and performance is poor.
 
The fourth pattern, above line cc, is jet fl ow, where the wall separation is so gross 
and pervasive that the mainstream ignores the walls and simply passes on through at 
nearly constant area. Performance is extremely poor in this region.
 
Dimensional analysis of a fl at-walled or conical diffuser shows that Cp should 
depend on the following parameters:
1. Any two of the following geometric parameters:
a. Area ratio AR 5 A2/A1 or (De/D)2
b. Divergence angle 2θ
c. 
Slenderness L/W1 or L/D
2. Inlet Reynolds number Ret 5 V1W1/ν or Ret 5 V1D/ν
3. Inlet Mach number Mat 5 V1/a1
4. Inlet boundary layer blockage factor Bt 5 ABL/A1, where ABL is the wall area 
blocked, or displaced, by the retarded boundary layer fl ow in the inlet (typically 
Bt varies from 0.03 to 0.12)
 
A fl at-walled diffuser would require an additional shape parameter to describe its 
cross section:
5. Aspect ratio AS 5 b/W1
Even with this formidable list, we have omitted fi ve possible important effects: inlet 
turbulence, inlet swirl, inlet profi le vorticity, superimposed pulsations, and  down-
stream obstruction, all of which occur in practical machinery applications.
 
The three most important parameters are AR, θ, and B. Typical performance maps 
for diffusers are shown in Fig. 6.28. For this case of 8 to 9 percent blockage, both 
the fl at-walled and conical types give about the same maximum performance, Cp 5 
0.70, but at different divergence angles (98 fl at versus 4.58 conical). Both types fall 
far short of the Bernoulli estimates of Cp 5 0.93 (fl at) and 0.99 (conical), primarily 
because of the blockage effect.
 
From the data of Ref. 14 we can determine that, in general, performance decreases 
with blockage and is approximately the same for both fl at-walled and conical dif-
fusers, as shown in Table 6.6. In all cases, the best conical diffuser is 10 to 80 
percent longer than the best fl at-walled design. Therefore, if length is limited in the 
design, the fl at-walled design will give the better performance depending on duct 
cross section.

The experimental design of a diffuser is an excellent example of a successful 
attempt to minimize the undesirable effects of adverse pressure gradient and fl ow 
separation.

6.12 Fluid Meters
 
Almost all practical fl uid engineering problems are associated with the need for an 
accurate fl ow measurement. There is a need to measure local properties (velocity, 
pressure, temperature, density, viscosity, turbulent intensity), integrated properties 
(mass fl ow and volume fl ow), and global properties (visualization of the entire fl ow 
fi eld). We shall concentrate in this section on velocity and volume fl ow 
measurements.
 
We have discussed pressure measurement in Sec. 2.10. Measurement of other ther-
modynamic properties, such as density, temperature, and viscosity, is beyond the 
scope of this text and is treated in specialized books such as Refs. 22 and 23. Global 
visualization techniques were discussed in Sec. 1.11 for low-speed fl ows, and the 
special optical techniques used in high-speed fl ows are treated in Ref. 34 of Chap. 1. 
Flow measurement schemes suitable for open-channel and other free-surface fl ows 
are treated in Chap. 10.
Local Velocity Measurements
 
Velocity averaged over a small region, or point, can be measured by several different

Floats or Buoyant Particles. A simple but effective estimate of fl ow velocity can be 
found from visible particles entrained in the fl ow. Examples include fl akes on the surface 
of a channel fl ow, small neutrally buoyant spheres mixed with a liquid, or hydrogen 
bubbles. Sometimes gas fl ows can be estimated from the motion of entrained dust par-
ticles. One must establish whether the particle motion truly simulates the fl uid motion. 
Floats are commonly used to track the movement of ocean waters and can be designed 
to move at the surface, along the bottom, or at any given depth [24]. Many offi cial tidal 
current charts [25] were obtained by releasing and timing a fl oating spar attached to a 
length of string. One can release whole groups of spars to determine a fl ow pattern.
Rotating Sensors. The rotating devices of Fig. 6.29a to d can be used in either gases 
or liquids, and their rotation rate is approximately proportional to the fl ow velocity. 
The cup anemometer (Fig. 6.29a) and Savonius rotor (Fig. 6.29b) always rotate the 
same way, regardless of fl ow direction. They are popular in atmospheric and oceano-
graphic applications and can be fi tted with a direction vane to align themselves with 
the fl ow. The ducted-propeller (Fig. 6.29c) and free-propeller (Fig. 6.29d) meters must 
be aligned with the fl ow parallel to their axis of rotation. They can sense reverse fl ow 
because they will then rotate in the opposite direction. All these rotating sensors can 
be attached to counters or sensed by electromagnetic or slip-ring devices for either a 
continuous or a digital reading of fl ow velocity. All have the disadvantage of being 
relatively large and thus not representing a “point.”
Pitot-Static Tube. A slender tube aligned with the fl ow (Figs. 6.29g and 6.30) can 
measure local velocity by means of a pressure difference. It has sidewall holes to 
measure the static pressure ps in the moving stream and a hole in the front to measure 
the stagnation pressure p0, where the stream is decelerated to zero velocity. Instead 
of measuring p0 or ps separately, it is customary to measure their difference with, say, 
a transducer, as in Fig. 6.30.
 
If ReD . 1000, where D is the probe diameter, the fl ow around the probe is nearly 
frictionless and Bernoulli’s relation, Eq. (3.54), applies with good accuracy. For

Assuming that the elevation pressure difference ρg(zs 2 z0) is negligible, this reduces to

(6.94)
This is the Pitot formula, named after the French engineer, Henri de Pitot, who 
designed the device in 1732.
 
The primary disadvantage of the pitot tube is that it must be aligned with the fl ow 
direction, which may be unknown. For yaw angles greater than 58, there are substantial 
errors in both the p0 and ps measurements, as shown in Fig. 6.30. The pitot-static tube 
is useful in liquids and gases; for gases a compressibility correction is necessary if the 
stream Mach number is high (Chap. 9). Because of the slow response of the fl uid-fi lled 
tubes leading to the pressure sensors, it is not useful for unsteady fl ow measurements. 
It does resemble a point and can be made small enough to measure, for example, blood 
fl ow in arteries and veins. It is not suitable for low-velocity measurement in gases 
because of the small pressure differences developed. For example, if V 5 1 ft/s in 
standard air, from Eq. (6.94) we compute p0 2 p equal to only 0.001 lbf/ft2 (0.048 Pa). 
This is beyond the resolution of most pressure gages.
Electromagnetic Meter. If a magnetic fi eld is applied across a conducting fl uid, the fl uid 
motion will induce a voltage across two electrodes placed in or near the fl ow. The 
electrodes can be streamlined or built into the wall, and they cause little or no fl ow 
resistance. The output is very strong for highly conducting fl uids such as liquid metals. 
Seawater also gives good output, and electromagnetic current meters are in common 
use in oceanography. Even low-conductivity fresh water can be measured by amplifying 
the output and insulating the electrodes. Commercial instruments are available for most 
liquid fl ows but are relatively costly. Electromagnetic fl owmeters are treated in Ref. 26.
Hot-Wire Anemometer. A very fi ne wire (d 5 0.01 mm or less) heated between two 
small probes, as in Fig. 6.29e, is ideally suited to measure rapidly fl uctuating fl ows 
such as the turbulent boundary layer. The idea dates back to work by L. V. King in 
1914 on heat loss from long, thin cylinders. If electric power is supplied to heat the 
cylinder, the loss varies with fl ow velocity across the cylinder according to King’s law
 
q 5 I2R < a 1 b(ρV)n 
(6.95)
where n < 1
3 at very low Reynolds numbers and equals 1
2 at high Reynolds numbers. 
The hot wire normally operates in the high-Reynolds-number range but should be 
calibrated in each situation to fi nd the best-fi t a, b, and n. The wire can be operated 
either at constant current I, so that resistance R is a measure of V, or at constant 
resistance R (constant temperature), with I a measure of velocity. In either case, the 
output is a nonlinear function of V, and the equipment should contain a linearizer to 
produce convenient velocity data. Many varieties of commercial hot-wire equipment 
are available, as are do-it-yourself designs [27]. Excellent detailed discussions of the 
hot wire are given in Ref. 28.
 
Because of its frailty, the hot wire is not suited to liquid fl ows, whose high density 
and entrained sediment will knock the wire right off. A more stable yet quite sensitive 
alternative for liquid fl ow measurement is the hot-fi lm anemometer (Fig. 6.29f). 
A thin metallic fi lm, usually platinum, is plated onto a relatively thick support, which 

404 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
can be a wedge, a cone, or a cylinder. The operation is similar to the hot wire. The 
cone gives best response but is liable to error when the fl ow is yawed to its axis.
 
Hot wires can easily be arranged in groups to measure two- and three-dimensional 
velocity components.
Laser-Doppler Anemometer. In the LDA a laser beam provides highly focused, coherent 
monochromatic light that is passed through the fl ow. When this light is scattered from a 
moving particle in the fl ow, a stationary observer can detect a change, or doppler shift, 
in the frequency of the scattered light. The shift Df is proportional to the velocity of the 
particle. There is essentially zero disturbance of the fl ow by the laser.
 
Figure 6.29h shows the popular dual-beam mode of the LDA. A focusing device 
splits the laser into two beams, which cross the fl ow at an angle θ. Their intersection, 
which is the measuring volume or resolution of the measurement, resembles an ellip-
soid about 0.5 mm wide and 0.1 mm in diameter. Particles passing through this 
measuring volume scatter the beams; they then pass through receiving optics to a 
photodetector, which converts the light to an electric signal. A signal processor then 
converts electric frequency to a voltage that can be either displayed or stored. If l is 
the wavelength of the laser light, the measured velocity is given by
 
V 5
λ ¢f
2 sin (θ/2)  
(6.96)
Multiple components of velocity can be detected by using more than one photodetec-
tor and other operating modes. Either liquids or gases can be measured as long as 
scattering particles are present. In liquids, normal impurities serve as scatterers, but 
gases may have to be seeded. The particles may be as small as the wavelength of the 
light. Although the measuring volume is not as small as with a hot wire, the LDA is 
capable of measuring turbulent fl uctuations.
 
The advantages of the LDA are as follows:
1. No disturbance of the fl ow.
2. High spatial resolution of the fl ow fi eld.
3. Velocity data that are independent of the fl uid thermodynamic properties.
4. An output voltage that is linear with velocity.
5. No need for calibration.
The disadvantages are that both the apparatus and the fl uid must be transparent to light 
and that the cost is high (a basic system shown in Fig. 6.29h begins at about $50,000).
 
Once installed, an LDA can map the entire fl ow fi eld in minutest detail. To truly 
appreciate the power of the LDA, one should examine, for instance, the amazingly detailed 
three-dimensional fl ow profi les measured by Eckardt [29] in a high-speed centrifugal com-
pressor impeller. Extensive discussions of laser velocimetry are given in Refs. 38 and 39.
Particle Image Velocimetry. This popular new idea, called PIV for short, measures not 
just a single point but instead maps the entire fi eld of fl ow. An illustration was shown 
in Fig. 1.18b. The fl ow is seeded with neutrally buoyant particles. A planar laser light 
sheet across the fl ow is pulsed twice and photographed twice. If Dr is the particle 
displacement vector over a short time Dt, an estimate of its velocity is V < Dr/Dt. 

6.12  Fluid Meters 405
A dedicated computer applies this formula to a whole cloud of particles and thus maps 
the fl ow fi eld. One can also use the data to calculate velocity gradient and vorticity 
fi elds. Since the particles all look alike, other cameras may be needed to identify them. 
Three-dimensional velocities can be measured by two cameras in a stereoscopic 
arrangement. The PIV method is not limited to stop-action. New high-speed cameras 
(up to 10,000 frames per second) can record movies of unsteady fl ow fi elds. For 
further details, see the monograph by M. Raffel [51].
EXAMPLE 6.20
The pitot-static tube of Fig. 6.30 uses mercury as a manometer fl uid. When it is placed in 
a water fl ow, the manometer height reading is h 5 8.4 in. Neglecting yaw and other errors, 
what is the fl ow velocity V in ft/s?
Solution
From the two-fl uid manometer relation (2.23b), with zA 5 z2, the pressure difference is related 
to h by
p0 2 ps 5 (γM 2 γw)h
Taking the specifi c weights of mercury and water from Table 2.1, we have
p0 2 ps 5 (846 2 62.4 lbf/ft3) 8.4
12 ft 5 549 lbf/ft2
The density of water is 62.4/32.2 5 1.94 slugs/ft3. Introducing these values into the pitot-
static formula (6.97), we obtain
 
V 5 c 2(549 lbf/ft2)
1.94 slugs/ft3 d

Ans.
Since this is a low-speed fl ow, no compressibility correction is needed.
Volume Flow Measurements
 
It is often desirable to measure the integrated mass, or volume fl ow, passing through a 
duct. Accurate measurement of fl ow is vital in billing customers for a given amount of 
liquid or gas passing through a duct. The different devices available to make these 
measurements are discussed in great detail in the ASME text on fl uid meters [30]. These 
devices split into two classes: mechanical instruments and head loss instruments.
 
The mechanical instruments measure actual mass or volume of fl uid by trapping 
it and counting it. The various types of measurement are
1. Mass measurement
a. Weighing tanks
b. Tilting traps
2. Volume measurement
a. Volume tanks
b. Reciprocating pistons

406 Chapter 6 Viscous Flow in Ducts
c. 
Rotating slotted rings
d. Nutating disc
e. 
Sliding vanes
f. 
Gear or lobed impellers
g. Reciprocating bellows
h. Sealed-drum compartments
The last three of these are suitable for gas fl ow measurement.
 
The head loss devices obstruct the fl ow and cause a pressure drop, which is a 
measure of fl ux:
1. Bernoulli-type devices
a. Thin-plate orifi ce
b. Flow nozzle
c. 
Venturi tube
2. Friction loss devices
a. Capillary tube
b. Porous plug
The friction loss meters cause a large nonrecoverable head loss and obstruct the fl ow 
too much to be generally useful.
 
Six other widely used meters operate on different physical principles:
1. Turbine meter
2. Vortex meter
3. Ultrasonic fl owmeter
4. Rotameter
5. Coriolis mass fl owmeter
6. Laminar fl ow element
Nutating Disc Meter. For measuring liquid volumes, as opposed to volume rates, the 
most common devices are the nutating disc and the turbine meter. Figure 6.31 shows

a cutaway sketch of a nutating disc meter, widely used in both water and gasoline 
delivery systems. The mechanism is clever and perhaps beyond the writer’s capabil-
ity to explain. The metering chamber is a slice of a sphere and contains a rotating 
disc set at an angle to the incoming fl ow. The fl uid causes the disc to nutate (spin 
eccentrically), and one revolution corresponds to a certain fl uid volume passing 
through. Total volume is obtained by counting the number of revolutions.
Turbine Meter. The turbine meter, sometimes called a propeller meter, is a freely 
rotating propeller that can be installed in a pipeline. A typical design is shown in 
Fig. 6.32a. There are fl ow straighteners upstream of the rotor, and the rotation is

measured by electric or magnetic pickup of pulses caused by passage of a point 
on the rotor. The rotor rotation is approximately proportional to the volume fl ow 
in the pipe.
 
Like the nutating disc, a major advantage of the turbine meter is that each pulse 
corresponds to a fi nite incremental volume of fl uid, and the pulses are digital and can 
be summed easily. Liquid fl ow turbine meters have as few as two blades and produce 
a constant number of pulses per unit fl uid volume over a 5:1 fl ow rate range with 
60.25 percent accuracy. Gas meters need many blades to produce suffi cient torque 
and are accurate to 61 percent.
 
Since turbine meters are very individualistic, fl ow calibration is an absolute neces-
sity. A typical liquid meter calibration curve is shown in Fig. 6.32b. Researchers 
attempting to establish universal calibration curves have met with little practical suc-
cess as a result of manufacturing variabilities.
 
Turbine meters can also be used in unconfi ned fl ow situations, such as winds or 
ocean currents. They can be compact, even microsize with two or three component 
directions. Figure 6.33 illustrates a handheld wind velocity meter that uses a seven-
bladed turbine with a calibrated digital output. The accuracy of this device is quoted 
at 62 percent.
Vortex Flowmeters. Recall from Fig. 5.2 that a bluff body placed in a uniform 
crossfl ow sheds alternating vortices at a nearly uniform Strouhal number 
St 5 fL/U, where U is the approach velocity and L is a characteristic body width. 
Since L and St are constant, this means that the shedding frequency is proportional 
to velocity:
 
f 5 (const)(U) 
(6.97)
The vortex meter introduces a shedding element across a pipe fl ow and picks up the 
shedding frequency downstream with a pressure, ultrasonic, or heat transfer type of 
sensor. A typical design is shown in Fig. 6.34.

wind velocity turbine meter.

6.12  Fluid Meters 409
 
The advantages of a vortex meter are as follows:
1. Absence of moving parts.
2. Accuracy to 61 percent over a wide fl ow rate range (up to 100:1).
3. Ability to handle very hot or very cold fl uids.
4. Requirement of only a short pipe length.
5. Calibration insensitive to fl uid density or viscosity.
For further details see Ref. 40.
Ultrasonic Flowmeters. The sound-wave analog of the laser velocimeter of Fig. 6.29h 
is the ultrasonic fl owmeter. Two examples are shown in Fig. 6.35. The pulse-type 
fl owmeter is shown in Fig. 6.35a. Upstream piezoelectric transducer A is excited with 
a short sonic pulse that propagates across the fl ow to downstream transducer B. The 
arrival at B triggers another pulse to be created at A, resulting in a regular pulse 
frequency fA. The same process is duplicated in the reverse direction from B to A, 
creating frequency fB. The difference fA 2 fB is proportional to the fl ow rate. 
Figure 6.35b shows a doppler-type arrangement, where sound waves from transmitter 
T are scattered by particles or contaminants in the fl ow to receiver R. Comparison of 
the two signals reveals a doppler frequency shift that is proportional to the fl ow rate. 
Ultrasonic meters are nonintrusive and can be directly attached to pipe fl ows in the 
Fig. 6.34 A vortex fl owmeter.

fi eld (Fig. 6.35c). Their quoted uncertainty of 61 to 2 percent can rise to 65 percent 
or more due to irregularities in velocity profi le, fl uid temperature, or Reynolds num-
ber. For further details see Ref. 41.
Rotameter. The variable-area transparent rotameter of Fig. 6.36 has a fl oat that, under 
the action of fl ow, rises in the vertical tapered tube and takes a certain equilibrium 
position for any given fl ow rate. A student exercise for the forces on the fl oat would 
yield the approximate relation
 
Q 5 Cd Aaa
2Wnet
Afloatρfluid
b

(6.98)
where Wnet is the float’s net weight in the fluid, Aa 5 Atube 2 Afloat is the annular 
area between the float and the tube, and Cd is a dimensionless discharge coeffi-
cient of order unity, for the annular constricted flow. For slightly tapered tubes, 
Aa varies nearly linearly with the float position, and the tube may be calibrated 
and marked with a flow rate scale, as in Fig. 6.36. The rotameter thus provides 
a readily visible measure of the flow rate. Capacity may be changed by using 
different-sized floats. Obviously the tube must be vertical, and the device does 
not give accurate readings for fluids containing high concentrations of bubbles 
or particles.
Coriolis Mass Flowmeter. Most commercial meters measure volume fl ow, with mass 
fl ow then computed by multiplying by the nominal fl uid density. An attractive

 modern alternative is a mass fl owmeter, which operates on the principle of the 
Coriolis acceleration associated with noninertial coordinates [recall Fig. 3.11 and 
the Coriolis term 2V 3 V in Eq. (3.48)]. The output of the meter is directly pro-
portional to mass fl ow.
 
Figure 6.37 is a schematic of a Coriolis device, to be inserted into a piping 
system. The fl ow enters a loop arrangement, which is electromagnetically vibrated 
at a high natural frequency (amplitude < 1 mm and frequency > 100 Hz). The 
Coriolis effect induces a downward force on the loop entrance and an upward force 
on the loop exit, as shown. The loop twists, and the twist angle can be measured 
and is proportional to the mass fl ow through the tube. Accuracy is typically less 
than 1 percent of full scale.
Laminar Flow Element. In many, perhaps most, commercial fl owmeters, the fl ow 
through the meter is turbulent and the variation of fl ow rate with pressure drop is 
nonlinear. In laminar duct fl ow, however, Q is linearly proportional to Dp, as in 
Eq. (6.12): Q 5 [πR4/(8μL)] Dp. Thus a laminar fl ow sensing element is attractive, 
since its calibration will be linear. To ensure laminar fl ow for what otherwise 
would be a turbulent condition, all or part of the fl uid is directed into small pas-
sages, each of which has a low (laminar) Reynolds number. A honeycomb is a 
popular design.
 
Figure 6.38 uses axial fl ow through a narrow annulus to create laminar fl ow. The 
theory again predicts Q~Dp, as in Eq. (6.70). However, the fl ow is very sensitive to 
passage size; for example, halving the annulus clearance increases Dp more than eight 
times. Careful calibration is thus necessary. In Fig. 6.38 the laminar fl ow concept has 
been synthesized into a complete mass fl ow system, with temperature control, dif-
ferential pressure measurement, and a microprocessor all self-contained. The accuracy 
of this device is rated at 60.2 percent.

Bernoulli Obstruction Theory. Consider the generalized fl ow obstruction shown in 
Fig. 6.39. The fl ow in the basic duct of diameter D is forced through an obstruction 
of diameter d; the β ratio of the device is a key parameter:
 
β 5 d
D 
(6.99)
After leaving the obstruction, the fl ow may neck down even more through a vena 
contracta of diameter D2 , d, as shown. Apply the Bernoulli and continuity equations 
for incompressible steady frictionless fl ow to estimate the pressure change:
Continuity: 
Q 5 π

Bernoulli:

But this is surely inaccurate because we have neglected friction in a duct fl ow, where 
we know friction will be very important. Nor do we want to get into the business of 
measuring vena contracta ratios D2/d for use in (6.100). Therefore we assume that

Thin-Plate Orifi ce. The thin-plate orifi ce, Fig. 6.40b, can be made with β in the range 
of 0.2 to 0.8, except that the hole diameter d should not be less than 12.5 mm. To 
measure p1 and p2, three types of tappings are commonly used:
1. Corner taps where the plate meets the pipe wall.
2. D: 1
2D taps: pipe-wall taps at D upstream and 1
2D downstream.
3. Flange taps: 1 in (25 mm) upstream and 1 in (25 mm) downstream of the plate, 
regardless of the size D.
Types 1 and 2 approximate geometric similarity, but since the fl ange taps 3 do not, 
they must be correlated separately for every single size of pipe in which a fl ange-tap 
plate is used [30, 31].
 
Figure 6.41 shows the discharge coeffi cient of an orifi ce with D: 1
2D or type 2 taps 
in the Reynolds number range ReD 5 104 to 107 of normal use. Although detailed 
charts such as Fig. 6.41 are available for designers [30], the ASME recommends use 
of the curve-fi t formulas developed by the ISO [31]. The basic form of the curve fi t 
is [42]

Note that the fl ange taps (6.110c), not being geometrically similar, use raw diameter 
in inches in the formula. The constants will change if other diameter units are used. 
We cautioned against such dimensional formulas in Example 1.4 and Eq. (5.17) and 
give Eq. (6.110c) only because fl ange taps are widely used in the United States.
Flow Nozzle. The fl ow nozzle comes in two types, a long-radius type shown in 
Fig. 6.40a and a short-radius type (not shown) called the ISA 1932 nozzle [30, 31]. 
The fl ow nozzle, with its smooth, rounded entrance convergence, practically elimi-
nates the vena contracta and gives discharge coeffi cients near unity. The nonrecover-
able loss is still large because there is no diffuser provided for gradual expansion.

Venturi Meter. The third and fi nal type of obstruction meter is the venturi, named in 
honor of Giovanni Venturi (1746–1822), an Italian physicist who fi rst tested conical 
expansions and contractions. The original, or classical, venturi was invented by a U.S. 
engineer, Clemens Herschel, in 1898. It consisted of a 218 conical contraction, a 
straight throat of diameter d and length d, then a 78 to 158 conical expansion. The 
discharge coeffi cient is near unity, and the nonrecoverable loss is very small. Herschel 
venturis are seldom used now.
 
The modern venturi nozzle, Fig. 6.40c, consists of an ISA 1932 nozzle entrance 
and a conical expansion of half-angle no greater than 158. It is intended to be operated 
in a narrow Reynolds number range of 1.5 3 105 to 2 3 106. Its discharge coeffi cient, 
shown in Fig. 6.43, is given by the ISO correlation formula
 
Cd < 0.9858 2 0.196β4.5 
(6.113)
It is independent of ReD within the given range. The Herschel venturi discharge varies 
with ReD but not with β, as shown in Fig. 6.42. Both have very low net losses.
 
The choice of meter depends on the loss and the cost and can be illustrated by the 
following table:
 Type of meter 
Net head loss

Medium

Venturi

As so often happens, the product of ineffi ciency and initial cost is approximately 
constant.
 
The average nonrecoverable head losses for the three types of meters, expressed 
as a fraction of the throat velocity head V2
t /(2g), are shown in Fig. 6.44. The orifi ce 
has the greatest loss and the venturi the least, as discussed. The orifi ce and nozzle

simulate partially closed valves as in Fig. 6.18b, while the venturi is a very minor 
loss. When the loss is given as a fraction of the measured pressure drop, the orifi ce 
and nozzle have nearly equal losses, as Example 6.21 will illustrate.
 
The other types of instruments discussed earlier in this section can also serve as 
fl owmeters if properly constructed. For example, a hot wire mounted in a tube can 
be calibrated to read volume fl ow rather than point velocity. Such hot-wire meters are 
commercially available, as are other meters modifi ed to use velocity instruments. For 
further details see Ref. 30.
Compressible Gas Flow Correction Factor. The orifi ce/nozzle/venturi formulas in this 
section assume incompressible fl ow. If the fl uid is a gas, and the pressure ratio (p2/
p1) is not near unity, a compressibility correction is needed. Equation (6.101) is rewrit-
ten in terms of mass fl ow and the upstream density ρ1:
 
m# 5 Cd Y At B

  where  β 5 d

The dimensionless expansion factor Y is a function of pressure ratio, β, and the type 
of meter. Some values are plotted in Fig. 6.45. The orifi ce, with its strong jet contrac-
tion, has a different factor from the venturi or the fl ow nozzle, which are designed to 
eliminate contraction.

EXAMPLE 6.21
We want to meter the volume fl ow of water (ρ 5 1000 kg/m3, ν 5 1.02 3 1026 m2/s) 
moving through a 200-mm-diameter pipe at an average velocity of 2.0 m/s. If the differen-
tial pressure gage selected reads accurately at p1 2 p2 5 50,000 Pa, what size meter should 
be selected for installing (a) an orifi ce with D: 1
2D taps, (b) a long-radius fl ow nozzle, or 
(c) a venturi nozzle? What would be the nonrecoverable head loss for each design?
Solution
Here the unknown is the β ratio of the meter. Since the discharge coeffi cient is a complicated 
function of β, iteration will be necessary. We are given D 5 0.2 m and V1 5 2.0 m/s. The 
pipe-approach Reynolds number is thus

where the given data are V1 5 2.0 m/s, ρ 5 1000 kg/m3, and Dp 5 50,000 Pa. Inserting these 
known values into Eq. (1) gives a relation between β and α:

The unknowns are β (or α) and Cd. Parts (a) to (c) depend on the particular chart or formula 
needed for Cd 5 fcn(ReD, β). We can make an initial guess β < 0.5 and iterate to convergence.
Part (a) 
For the orifi ce with D: 1

We have converged to three fi gures. The proper venturi diameter is
 
d 5 βD 5 89 mm

Comments: These meters are of similar size, but their head losses are not the same. From 
Fig. 6.44 for the three different shapes we may read the three K factors and compute
hm,orifice < 3.5 m   hm,nozzle < 3.6 m   hm,venturi < 0.8 m
The venturi loss is only about 22 percent of the orifi ce and nozzle losses.
Solution by Excel Iteration for the Flow Nozzle
Parts (a, b, c) were solved by hand, but Excel is ideal for these calculations. You may review this 
procedure from the instructions in Example 6.5. We need fi ve columns: Cd, calculated from Eq. 
(6.111), throat velocity Vt calculated from Dp, α as calculated from Eq. (6.104), and β calculated 
from the velocity ratio (V/Vt). The fi fth column is an initial guess for β, which is replaced in its 
next row by the newly computed β. Any initial β , 1 will do. Here we chose β 5 0.5 as in part 
(b) for the fl ow nozzle. Remember to use cell names, not symbols: in row 1, Cd 5 A1, Vt 5 B1, 
α 5 C1, and β 5 D1. The process converges rapidly, in only two or three iterations:

EXAMPLE 6.22
A long-radius nozzle of diameter 6 cm is used to meter airfl ow in a 10-cm-diameter pipe. 
Upstream conditions are p1 5 200 kPa and T1 5 1008C. If the pressure drop through the 
nozzle is 60 kPa, estimate the fl ow rate in m3/s.

Summary 421
Solution
• Assumptions: The pressure drops 30 percent, so we need the compressibility factor Y, 
and Eq. (6.114) is applicable to this problem.
• Approach: Find ρ1 and Cd and apply Eq. (6.114) with β 5 6/10 5 0.6.
• Property values: Given p1 and T1, ρ1 5 p1/RT1 5 (200,000)/[287(100 1 273)] 5 1.87 
kg/m3. The downstream pressure is p2 5 200 2 60 5 140 kPa, hence p2/p1 5 0.7. At 
1008C, from Table A.2, the viscosity of air is 2.17 E-5 kg/m-s.
• Solution steps:  Initially apply Eq. (6.114) by guessing, from Fig. 6.42, that Cd < 0.98. 
From Fig. 6.45, for a nozzle with p2/p1 5 0.7 and β 5 0.6, read Y < 0.80. Then

m# < 1.14 kg/s

•  Comments: Figure 6.45 is not just a “chart” for engineers to use casually. It is based on 
the compressible fl ow theory of Chap. 9. There, we may reassign this example as a theory.
Summary
 
This chapter has been concerned with internal pipe and duct fl ows, which are prob-
ably the most common problems encountered in engineering fl uid mechanics. Such 
fl ows are very sensitive to the Reynolds number and change from laminar to transi-
tional to turbulent fl ow as the Reynolds number increases.
 
The various Reynolds number regimes were outlined, and a semiempirical approach 
to turbulent fl ow modeling was presented. The chapter then made a detailed analysis 
of fl ow through a straight circular pipe, leading to the famous Moody chart (Fig. 6.13) 
for the friction factor. Possible uses of the Moody chart were discussed for fl ow rate 
and sizing problems, as well as the application of the Moody chart to noncircular 
ducts using an equivalent duct “diameter.” The addition of minor losses due to valves, 
elbows, fi ttings, and other devices was presented in the form of loss coeffi cients to 
be incorporated along with Moody-type friction losses. Multiple-pipe systems were 
discussed briefl y and were seen to be quite complex algebraically and appropriate for 
computer solution.
 
Diffusers are added to ducts to increase pressure recovery at the exit of a system. 
Their behavior was presented as experimental data, since the theory of real diffusers 
is still not well developed. The chapter ended with a discussion of fl owmeters, espe-
cially the pitot-static tube and the Bernoulli obstruction type of meter. Flowmeters 
also require careful experimental calibration.

P6.1 
An engineer claims that the fl ow of SAE 30W oil, at 208C, 
through a 5-cm-diameter smooth pipe at 1 million N/h, is 
laminar. Do you agree? A million newtons is a lot, so this 
sounds like an awfully high fl ow rate.
P6.2 
The present pumping rate of crude oil through the Alaska 
Pipeline, with an ID of 48 in, is 550,000 barrels per day 
(1 barrel 5 42 U.S. gallons). (a) Is this a turbulent fl ow? 
(b) What would be the maximum rate if the fl ow were 
constrained to be laminar? Assume that Alaskan oil fi ts 
Fig. A.1 of the Appendix at 608C.
P6.3 
The Keystone Pipeline in the chapter opener photo has a 
maximum proposed fl ow rate of 1.3 million barrels of 
crude oil per day. Estimate the Reynolds number and 
whether the fl ow is laminar. Assume that Keystone crude 
oil fi ts Fig. A.1 of the Appendix at 408C.
P6.4 
For fl ow of SAE 30 oil through a 5-cm-diameter pipe, from 
Fig. A.1, for what fl ow rate in m3/h would we expect transi-
tion to turbulence at (a) 208C and (b) 1008C?
P6.5 
In fl ow past a body or wall, early transition to turbulence 
can be induced by placing a trip wire on the wall across the 
fl ow, as in Fig. P6.5. If the trip wire in Fig. P6.5 is placed 
where the local velocity is U, it will trigger turbulence if 
Ud/ν 5 850, where d is the wire diameter [3, p. 388]. If the 
sphere diameter is 20 cm and transition is observed at 
ReD 5 90,000, what is the diameter of the trip wire in mm?

For fl ow of a uniform stream parallel to a sharp fl at plate, 
transition to a turbulent boundary layer on the plate may

velocity and x is distance along the plate. If U 5 2.5 m/s, 
determine the distance x for the following fl uids at 20°C 
and 1 atm: (a) hydrogen, (b) air, (c) gasoline, (d) water, 
(e) mercury, and (f) glycerin.
P6.7 
SAE 10W30 oil at 208C fl ows from a tank into a 2-cm-
diameter tube 40 cm long. The fl ow rate is 1.1 m3/hr. Is 
the entrance length region a signifi cant part of this tube 
fl ow?
P6.8 
When water at 208C is in steady turbulent fl ow through an 
8-cm-diameter pipe, the wall shear stress is 72 Pa. What is 
the axial pressure gradient (≠p/≠x) if the pipe is (a) horizon-
tal and (b) vertical with the fl ow up?

A light liquid (ρ < 950 kg/m3) fl ows at an average velocity 
of 10 m/s through a horizontal smooth tube of diameter

Estimate (a) the total head loss, in meters; (b) the wall 
shear stress in the fully developed section of the pipe; and 
(c) the overall friction factor.

Problems 423
P6.10 Water at 208C fl ows through an inclined 8-cm-diameter 
pipe. At sections A and B the following data are taken: 
pA 5 186 kPa, VA 5 3.2 m/s, zA 5 24.5 m, and pB 5 260 
kPa, VB 5 3.2 m/s, zB 5 9.1 m. Which way is the fl ow go-
ing? What is the head loss in meters?
P6.11 Water at 208C fl ows upward at 4 m/s in a 6-cm-diameter 
pipe. The pipe length between points 1 and 2 is 5 m, and 
point 2 is 3 m higher. A mercury manometer, connected 
between 1 and 2, has a reading h 5 135 mm, with p1 higher. 
(a) What is the pressure change (p1 2 p2)? (b) What is the 
head loss, in meters? (c) Is the manometer reading propor-
tional to head loss? Explain. (d) What is the friction factor 
of the fl ow?
In Probs. 6.12 to 6.99, neglect minor losses.
Laminar pipe fl ow––no minor losses
P6.12 A 5-mm-diameter capillary tube is used as a viscometer for 
oils. When the fl ow rate is 0.071 m3/h, the measured pres-
sure drop per unit length is 375 kPa/m. Estimate the viscosity 
of the fl uid. Is the fl ow laminar? Can you also estimate the 
density of the fl uid?
P6.13 A soda straw is 20 cm long and 2 mm in diameter. It delivers

Turbulence modeling
P6.34 Derive the time-averaged x-momentum equation (6.21) 
by direct substitution of Eqs. (6.19) into the momentum 
equation (6.14). It is convenient to write the convective 
acceleration as
 
du
dt 5 0
0x (u2) 1 0
0y (uv) 1 0
0z (uw)
 
 
which is valid because of the continuity relation, Eq. (6.14).
P6.35 In the overlap layer of Fig. 6.9a, turbulent shear is large. If 
we neglect viscosity, we can replace Eq. (6.24) with the 
approximate velocity-gradient function

P6.38 Suppose in Fig. P6.37 that h 5 3 cm, the fl uid in water at

is valid. If the shear stress in the fl uid is 15 Pa, what is V 
in m/s?
P6.39 By analogy with laminar shear, τ 5 μ du/dy, T. V. 
 Boussinesq in 1877 postulated that turbulent shear could 
also be related to the mean velocity gradient τturb 5 ε du/dy, 
where ε is called the eddy viscosity and is much larger than 
μ. If the logarithmic overlap law, Eq. (6.28), is valid with 
τturb < τw, show that ε < κρu*y.
P6.40 Theodore von Kármán in 1930 theorized that turbulent 
shear could be represented by τturb 5 ε du/dy, where 
ε 5 ρκ2y2|du/dy| is called the mixing-length eddy viscosity 
and κ < 0.41 is Kármán’s dimensionless mixing-length 
constant [2, 3]. Assuming that τturb < τw near the wall, 
show that this expression can be integrated to yield the 
logarithmic overlap law, Eq. (6.28).

(b) commercial steel, or (c) cast iron? Neglect minor losses.
P6.42 Fluid fl ows steadily, at volume rate Q, through a large hor-

pipes have the same length and pressure drop. If all fl ows

P6.81 The pump in Fig. P6.80 is used to deliver gasoline at 208C 
through 350 m of 30-cm-diameter galvanized iron pipe. 
Estimate the resulting fl ow rate, in m3/s. (Note that the 
pump head is now in meters of gasoline.)
P6.82 Fluid at 208C fl ows through a horizontal galvanized-iron 
pipe 20 m long and 8 cm in diameter. The wall shear stress 
is 90 Pa. Calculate the fl ow rate in m3/h if the fl uid is 
(a) glycerin and (b) water.
P6.83 For the system of Fig. P6.55, let Dz 5 80 m and L 5 185 m

fl ow rate will be 7 m3/h?
P6.84 It is desired to deliver 60 m3/h of water at 208C through a 
horizontal asphalted cast iron pipe. Estimate the pipe diam-
eter that will cause the pressure drop to be exactly 40 kPa 
per 100 m of pipe length.
P6.85 For the system in Prob. P6.53, a pump, which delivers 
15,000 W to the water, is used at night to refi ll the upper 
reservoir. The pipe diameter is increased from 12 cm to 
provide more fl ow. If the resultant fl ow rate is 90 m3/h, esti-

P6.89 An annulus of narrow clearance causes a very large

with a 5 50 mm and b 5 49 mm carries an oil flow at 
0.001 m3/s, what is the oil viscosity if the pressure 
drop is 250 kPa?
P6.90 A rectangular sheet-metal duct is 200 ft long and has a

of air at 208C and 1 atm. What is the optimum width B that 
will provide the most airfl ow in ft3/s?
P6.91 Heat exchangers often consist of many triangular pas-

P6.93 In Moody’s Example 6.6, the 6-inch diameter, 200-ft-long 
asphalted cast iron pipe has a pressure drop of about 
280 lbf/ft2 when the average water velocity is 6 ft/s. Com-
pare this to an annular cast iron pipe with an inner diameter 
of 6 in and the same annular average velocity of 6 ft/s. 
(a) What outer diameter would cause the fl ow to have the 
same pressure drop of 280 lbf/ft2? (b) How do the cross-
section areas compare, and why? Use the hydraulic diam-
eter approximation.
P6.94 Air at 208C fl ows through a smooth duct of  diameter 20 cm 
at an average velocity of 5 m/s. It then fl ows into a smooth 
square duct of side length a. Find the square duct size a for 
which the pressure drop per meter will be exactly the same 
as the circular duct.
P6.95 Although analytical solutions are available for laminar 
fl ow in many duct shapes [34], what do we do about 
ducts of arbitrary shape? Bahrami et al. [57] propose 
that a better approach to the pipe result, f Re 5 64, is 
achieved by replacing the hydraulic diameter Dh with 
1A, where A is the area of the cross section. Test this 
idea for the isosceles triangles of Table 6.4. If time is 
short, at least try 108, 508, and 808. What do you con-

Word Problems
 W6.1 In fully developed straight-duct fl ow, the velocity profi les 
do not change (why?), but the pressure drops along the pipe 
axis. Thus there is pressure work done on the fl uid. If, say, 
the pipe is insulated from heat loss, where does this energy 
go? Make a thermodynamic analysis of the pipe fl ow.
 W6.2 From the Moody chart (Fig. 6.13), rough surfaces, such as 
sand grains or ragged machining, do not affect laminar fl ow. 
Can you explain why? They do affect turbulent fl ow. Can 
you develop, or suggest, an analytical–physical model of 
turbulent fl ow near a rough surface that might be used to 
predict the known increase in pressure drop?
 W6.3 Differentiation of the laminar pipe fl ow solution, Eq. 
(6.40), shows that the fl uid shear stress τ(r) varies linearly 
from zero at the axis to τw at the wall. It is claimed that this

is also true, at least in the time mean, for fully developed 
turbulent fl ow. Can you verify this claim analytically?
 W6.4 A porous medium consists of many tiny tortuous passages, 
and Reynolds numbers based on pore size are usually very 
low, of order unity. In 1856 H. Darcy proposed that the 
pressure gradient in a porous medium was directly propor-
tional to the volume-averaged velocity V of the fl uid:
§p 5 2

K V
where K is termed the permeability of the medium. This is 
now called Darcy’s law of porous fl ow. Can you make a 
Poiseuille fl ow model of porous-media fl ow that verifi es 
Darcy’s law? Meanwhile, as the Reynolds number in-
creases, so that VK1/2/ν . 1, the pressure drop becomes 
nonlinear, as was shown experimentally by P. H. For-
scheimer as early as 1782. The fl ow is still decidedly lami-
nar, yet the pressure gradient is quadratic:

A pump delivers a steady fl ow of water (ρ, μ) from a large 
tank to two other higher-elevation tanks, as shown in Fig. 
C6.2. The same pipe of diameter d and roughness ε is used 
throughout. All minor losses except through the valve are 
neglected, and the partially closed valve has a loss coeffi -
cient Kvalve. Turbulent fl ow may be assumed with all kinetic 
energy fl ux correction coeffi cients equal to 1.06. The pump 
net head H is a known function of QA and hence also of VA 5 
QA/Apipe; for example, H 5 a 2 bV2

constants. Subscript J refers to the junction point at the tee 
where branch A splits into B and C. Pipe length LC is much 
longer than LB. It is desired to predict the pressure at J, the 
three pipe velocities and friction factors, and the pump 
head. Thus there are eight variables: H, VA, VB, VC, fA, fB, fC, 
pJ. Write down the eight equations needed to resolve this

A hydroponic garden uses the 10-m-long perforated-pipe 
system in Fig. D6.1 to deliver water at 208C. The pipe is 
5 cm in diameter and contains a circular hole every 20 cm. 
A pump delivers water at 75 kPa (gage) at the entrance, 
while the other end of the pipe is closed. If you attempted, 
for example, Prob. P3.125, you know that the pressure near 
the closed end of a perforated “manifold” is surprisingly 
high, and there will be too much fl ow through the holes 
near that end. One remedy is to vary the hole size along the 
pipe axis. Make a design analysis, perhaps using a personal 
computer, to pick the optimum hole size distribution that 
will make the discharge fl ow rate as uniform as possible 
along the pipe axis. You are constrained to pick hole sizes 
that correspond only to commercial (numbered) metric 
drill-bit sizes available to the typical machine shop.

The tank is to be fi lled daily with rather chilly (108C) 
groundwater from an aquifer, which is 0.8 mi from the tank 
and 150 ft lower than the tank. Estimated daily water use is 
1.5 million gal/day. Filling time should not exceed 8 h per 
day. The piping system should have four “butterfl y” valves 
with variable openings (see Fig. 6.19), 10 elbows of vari-
ous angles, and galvanized iron pipe of a size to be selected 
in the design. The design should be economical—both in 
capital costs and operating expense. Taco Inc. has provided 
the following cost estimates for system components:
  
Pump and motor  $3500 plus $1500 per inch of impeller size
  
Pump speed 
Between 900 and 1800 r/min
  
Valves 
$300 1 $200 per inch of pipe size
  
Elbows 
 $50 plus $50 per inch of pipe size
  
Pipes 
 $1 per inch of diameter per foot of length
  
Electricity cost 
10¢ per kilowatt-hour
 
 
Your design task is to select an economical pipe size and 
pump impeller size and speed for this task, using the pump 
test data in nondimensional form (see Prob. P5.61) as de-
sign data. Write a brief report (fi ve to six pages) showing 
your calculations and graphs.

 This chapter is devoted to lift and drag of various bodies immersed in an approaching stream 
of fl uid. Pictured is the Swiss solar-powered aircraft, Solar Impulse, over the Golden Gate 
Bridge. Earlier solar aircraft needed to be towed aloft before fl ying and were not able to fl y at 
night. The Solar Impulse is the fi rst solar airplane to fl y day and night, approaching the notion 
of perpetual fl ight. The long, high-aspect-ratio wings have more lift, and less drag, than a 
short wing of the same area. Its fi rst international fl ight was from Switzerland to Brussels, on 
May  14, 2011. In the summer of 2013, as shown, it fl ew from San Francisco to New York 
City, in fi ve legs. The pilots were Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg.

 Chapter  7 
 Flow  Past 
 Immersed  Bodies 
Motivation. This chapter is devoted to “external” fl ows around bodies immersed in 
a fl uid stream. Such a fl ow will have viscous (shear and no-slip) effects near the body 
surfaces and in its wake, but will typically be nearly inviscid far from the body. These 
are unconfi ned boundary layer fl ows.
 
Chapter 6 considered “internal” fl ows confi ned by the walls of a duct. In that case 
the viscous boundary layers grow from the sidewalls, meet downstream, and fi ll the 
entire duct. Viscous shear is the dominant effect. For example, the Moody chart of 
Fig. 6.13 is essentially a correlation of wall shear stress for long ducts of constant 
cross section.
 
External fl ows are unconfi ned, free to expand no matter how thick the viscous 
layers grow. Although boundary layer theory (Sec. 7.3) and computational fl uid 
dynamics (CFD) [4] are helpful in understanding external fl ows, complex body 
geometries usually require experimental data on the forces and moments caused by 
the fl ow. Such immersed-body fl ows are commonly encountered in engineering 
 studies: aerodynamics (airplanes, rockets, projectiles), hydrodynamics (ships, 
 submarines, torpedos), transportation (automobiles, trucks, cycles), wind engineering 
(buildings, bridges, water towers, wind turbines), and ocean engineering (buoys, 
breakwaters, pilings, cables, moored instruments). This chapter provides data and 
analysis to assist in such studies.
7.1 Reynolds Number and 
Geometry Effects
 
The technique of boundary layer (BL) analysis can be used to compute viscous effects 
near solid walls and to “patch” these onto the outer inviscid motion. This patching is 
more successful as the body Reynolds number becomes larger, as shown in Fig. 7.1.
 
In Fig. 7.1 a uniform stream U moves parallel to a sharp fl at plate of length L. If 
the Reynolds number UL/ν is low (Fig. 7.1a), the viscous region is very broad and 
extends far ahead and to the sides of the plate. The plate retards the oncoming stream 
greatly, and small changes in fl ow parameters cause large changes in the pressure 

450 Chapter 7 Flow Past Immersed Bodies 
distribution along the plate. Thus, although in principle it should be possible to patch 
the viscous and inviscid layers in a mathematical analysis, their interaction is strong 
and nonlinear [1 to 3]. There is no existing simple theory for external fl ow analysis 
at Reynolds numbers from 1 to about 1000. Such thick-shear-layer fl ows are typically 
studied by experiment or by numerical modeling of the fl ow fi eld on a computer [4].
 
A high-Reynolds-number fl ow (Fig. 7.1b) is much more amenable to boundary 
layer patching, as fi rst pointed out by Prandtl in 1904. The viscous layers, either 
laminar or turbulent, are very thin, thinner even than the drawing shows. We 
defi ne the boundary layer thickness δ as the locus of points where the velocity u 
parallel to the plate reaches 99 percent of the external velocity U. As we shall see in 
Sec. 7.4, the accepted formulas for fl at-plate fl ow, and their approximate ranges, are

The blanks indicate that the formula is not applicable. In all cases these boundary 
layers are so thin that their displacement effect on the outer inviscid layer is 
negligible. Thus the pressure distribution along the plate can be computed from 
inviscid theory as if the boundary layer were not even there. This external pres-
sure fi eld then “drives” the boundary layer fl ow, acting as a forcing function in 
the momentum equation along the surface. We shall explain this boundary layer 
theory in Secs. 7.4 and 7.5.
 
For slender bodies, such as plates and airfoils parallel to the oncoming stream, we 
conclude that this assumption of negligible interaction between the boundary layer 
and the outer pressure distribution is an excellent approximation.
 
For a blunt-body fl ow, however, even at very high Reynolds numbers, there 
is a discrepancy in the viscous–inviscid patching concept. Figure 7.2 shows two

sketches of fl ow past a two- or three-dimensional blunt body. In the ideal ized 
sketch (7.2a), there is a thin fi lm of boundary layer about the body and a 
 narrow sheet of viscous wake in the rear. The patching theory would be glorious 
for this picture, but it is false. In the actual fl ow (Fig. 7.2b), the boundary layer 
is thin on the front, or windward, side of the body, where the pressure decreases 
along the surface (favorable pressure gradient). But in the rear the boundary layer 
encounters increasing pressure (adverse pressure gradient) and breaks off, or sepa-
rates, into a broad, pulsating wake. (See Fig. 5.2a for a photograph of a specifi c 
example.) The mainstream is defl ected by this wake, so that the external fl ow is 
quite different from the prediction from inviscid theory with the addition of a thin 
boundary layer.
 
The theory of strong interaction between blunt-body viscous and inviscid layers is 
not well developed. Flows like that of Fig. 7.2b are normally studied experimentally 
or with CFD [4]. Reference 5 is an example of efforts to improve the theory of sepa-
rated fl ows. Reference 6 is another textbook devoted to separated fl ow.
 EXAMPLE  7.1 
A long, thin, fl at plate is placed parallel to a 20-ft/s stream of water at 688F. At what distance x 
from the leading edge will the boundary layer thickness be 1 in?
Solution
• Assumptions: Flat-plate fl ow, with Eqs. (7.1) applying in their appropriate ranges.
• Approach: Guess laminar fl ow fi rst. If contradictory, try turbulent fl ow.
• Property values: From Table A.1 for water at 688F, ν < 1.082 E-5 ft2/s.
• Solution step 1: With δ 5 1 in 5 1/12 ft, try laminar fl ow, Eq. (7.1a):

Rex 5 Ux
ν 5 (20 ft/s)(513 ft)
1.082 E-5 ft2/s 5 9.5 E8  (!)
This is impossible, since laminar boundary layer fl ow only persists up to about 106 (or, 
with special care to avoid disturbances, up to 3 3 106).
• Solution step 2: Try turbulent fl ow, Eq. (7.1b):
δ

Ans.
Check Rex 5 (20 ft/s)(5.17 ft)/(1.082 E-5 ft2/s) 5 9.6 E6 . 106. OK, turbulent fl ow.
•  Comments: The fl ow is turbulent, and the inherent ambiguity of the theory is 
resolved.

7.2  Momentum Integral Estimates 453
 7.2  Momentum  Integral 
 Estimates 
 
When we derived the momentum integral relation, Eq. (3.37), and applied it to a fl at-
plate boundary layer in Example 3.11, we promised to consider it further in Chap. 7. 
Well, here we are! Let us review the problem, using Fig. 7.3.
 
A shear layer of unknown thickness grows along the sharp fl at plate in Fig. 7.3. 
The no-slip wall condition retards the fl ow, making it into a rounded profi le u(x, y), 
which merges into the external velocity U 5 constant at a “thickness” y 5 δ(x). By 
utilizing the control volume of Fig. 3.11, we found (without making any assumptions 
about laminar versus turbulent fl ow) in Example 3.11 that the drag force on the plate 
is given by the following momentum integral across the exit plane:
 
 D(x) 5 ρb#
δ(x)
0
u(U 2 u) dy 
 (7.2) 
where b is the plate width into the paper and the integration is carried out along a 
vertical plane x 5 constant. You should review the momentum integral relation (3.37) 
and its use in Example 3.11.
  Kármán’s  Analysis  of  
the  Flat  Plate 
 
Equation  (7.2)  was  derived  in  1921  by  Kármán  [7],  who  wrote  it  in  the  convenient  
 form  of  the  m o mentum  thickness  θ : 
 
D(x) 5 ρbU2θ   θ 5#
δ

 u
U a1 2 u

(7.3)
Momentum thickness is thus a measure of total plate drag. Kármán then noted that 
the drag also equals the integrated wall shear stress along the plate:
D(x) 5 b#

τw(x) dx
or

Meanwhile, the derivative of Eq. (7.3), with U 5 constant, is

454 Chapter 7 Flow Past Immersed Bodies 
By comparing this with Eq. (7.4) Kármán arrived at what is now called the momentum 
integral relation for fl at-plate boundary layer fl ow:
 
τw 5 ρU2 dθ
dx 
(7.5)
It is valid for either laminar or turbulent fl at-plate fl ow.
 
To get a numerical result for laminar fl ow, Kármán assumed that the velocity 
profi les had an approximately parabolic shape
 
u(x, y) < U a2y
δ 2 y2
δ2b    0 # y # δ(x) 
(7.6)
which makes it possible to estimate both momentum thickness and wall shear:

This is the desired thickness estimate. It is all approximate, of course, part of 
Kármán’s momentum integral theory [7], but it is startlingly accurate, being only 
10 percent higher than the known accepted solution for laminar fl at-plate fl ow, which 
we gave as Eq. (7.1a).
 
By combining Eqs. (7.9) and (7.7) we also obtain a shear stress estimate along the 
plate:

(7.10)
Again this estimate, in spite of the crudeness of the profi le assumption [Eq. (7.6)] is only 
10 percent higher than the known exact laminar-plate-fl ow solution cf 5 0.664/Rex
1/2, 
treated in Sec. 7.4. The dimensionless quantity cf, called the skin friction coeffi cient, is 
analogous to the friction factor f in ducts.
 
A boundary layer can be judged as “thin” if, say, the ratio δ/x is less than about 
0.1. This occurs at δ/x 5 0.1 5 5.0/Rex
1/2 or at Rex 5 2500. For Rex less than 2500 
we can estimate that boundary layer theory fails because the thick layer has a 
 signifi cant effect on the outer inviscid fl ow. The upper limit on Rex for laminar fl ow 

7.2  Momentum Integral Estimates 455
is about 3 3 106, where measurements on a smooth fl at plate [8] show that the fl ow 
undergoes transition to a turbulent boundary layer. From 3 3 106 upward the turbulent 
Reynolds number may be arbitrarily large, and a practical limit at present is 5 3 1010 
for oil supertankers.
Displacement Thickness
 
Another interesting effect of a boundary layer is its small but fi nite displacement of 
the outer streamlines. As shown in Fig. 7.4, outer streamlines must defl ect outward a 
distance δ*(x) to satisfy conservation of mass between the inlet and outlet:

The quantity δ* is called the displacement thickness of the boundary layer. To relate 
it to u(y), cancel ρ and b from Eq. (7.11), evaluate the left integral, and slyly add and 
subtract U from the right integrand:
Uh 5 #

Thus the ratio of δ*/δ varies only with the dimensionless velocity profi le shape u/U.
 
Introducing our profi le approximation (7.6) into (7.12), we obtain by integration 
this approximate result:

x for large Rex and the outer streamline slope V/U is proportional to δ*, we conclude 
that the velocity normal to the wall is much smaller than the velocity parallel to the 
wall. This is a key assumption in boundary layer theory (Sec. 7.3).
 
We also conclude from the success of these simple parabolic estimates that Kármán’s 
momentum integral theory is effective and useful. Many details of this theory are 
given in Refs. 1 to 3.

EXAMPLE 7.2
Are low-speed, small-scale air and water boundary layers really thin? Consider fl ow at 
U 5 1 ft/s past a fl at plate 1 ft long. Compute the boundary layer thickness at the trailing 
edge for (a) air and (b) water at 688F.
Solution
Part (a) 
From Table A.2, νair < 1.61 E-4 ft2/s. The trailing-edge Reynolds number thus is
ReL 5 UL
ν 5 (1 ft/s)(1 ft)
1.61 E-4 ft2/s 5 6200
Since this is less than 106, the fl ow is presumed laminar, and since it is greater than 2500, 
the boundary layer is reasonably thin. From Eq. (7.1a), the predicted laminar thickness is
δ

16200 5 0.0634

Part (b) 
From Table A.1, νwater < 1.08 E-5 ft2/s. The trailing-edge Reynolds number is
ReL 5 (1 ft/s)(1 ft)
1.08 E-5 ft2/s < 92,600
This again satisfi es the laminar and thinness conditions. The boundary layer thickness is

192,600 5 0.0164
or, at x 5 1 ft,

Ans. (b)
Thus, even at such low velocities and short lengths, both airfl ows and water fl ows satisfy 
the boundary layer approximations.
7.3 The Boundary Layer 
Equations
 
In Chaps. 4 and 6 we learned that there are several dozen known analytical laminar 
fl ow solutions [1 to 3]. None are for external fl ow around immersed bodies, although 
this is one of the primary applications of fl uid mechanics. No exact solutions are 
known for turbulent fl ow, whose analysis typically uses empirical modeling laws to 
relate time-mean variables.
 
There are presently three techniques used to study external fl ows: (1) numerical 
(computer) solutions, (2) experimentation, and (3) boundary layer theory.
 
Computational fluid dynamics is now well developed and described in advanced 
texts such as that by Anderson [4]. Thousands of computer solutions and models 
have been published; execution times, mesh sizes, and graphical presentations 
are improving each year. Both laminar and turbulent flow solutions have been 
published, and turbulence modeling is a current research topic [9]. Except for a 
brief discussion of computer analysis in Chap. 8, the topic of CFD is beyond our 
scope here.

7.3  The Boundary Layer Equations 457
 
Experimentation is the most common method of studying external fl ows. Chapter 5 
outlined the technique of dimensional analysis, and we shall give many nondimen-
sional experimental data for external fl ows in Sec. 7.6.
 
The third tool is boundary layer theory, fi rst formulated by Ludwig Prandtl in 
1904. We shall follow Prandtl’s ideas here and make certain order-of-magnitude 
assumptions to greatly simplify the Navier-Stokes equations (4.38) into boundary 
layer equations that are solved relatively easily and patched onto the outer inviscid 
fl ow fi eld.
 
One of the great achievements of boundary layer theory is its ability to predict the 
fl ow separation that occurs in adverse (positive) pressure gradients, as illustrated in 
Fig. 7.2b. Before 1904, when Prandtl published his pioneering paper, no one realized 
that such thin shear layers could cause such a gross effect as fl ow separation. Even 
today, however, boundary layer theory cannot accurately predict the behavior of the 
separated-fl ow region and its interaction with the outer fl ow. Modern research [4, 9] 
has focused on detailed CFD simulations of separated fl ow, and the resultant wakes, 
to gain further insight.
 Derivation  for  Two-Dimensional 
 Flow 
 
We consider only steady two-dimensional incompressible viscous fl ow with the 
x direction along the wall and y normal to the wall, as in Fig. 7.3.1 We neglect gravity, 
which is important only in boundary layers where fl uid buoyancy is dominant 
[2, sec. 4.14]. From Chap. 4, the complete equations of motion consist of continuity 
and the x- and y-momentum relations:
 
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 5 0 
(7.14a)
 
ρ au 0u
0x 1 υ 0u
0yb 5 20p
0x 1 μ a 02u
0x2 1 02u
0y2b 
(7.14b)
 
ρ au 0υ
0x 1 υ 0υ
0y b 5 20p
0y 1 μ a 02υ
0x2 1 02υ
0y2 b 
(7.14c)
These should be solved for u, υ, and p subject to typical no-slip, inlet, and exit bound-
ary conditions, but in fact they are too diffi cult to handle for most external fl ows 
except with CFD.
 
In 1904 Prandtl correctly deduced that a shear layer must be very thin if the 
Reynolds number is large, so that the following approximations apply:
Velocities: 
υ ! u 
(7.15a)
Rates of change: 
0u
0x ! 0u
0y    0υ
0x ! 0υ
0y  
(7.15b)
Reynolds number: 
Rex 5 Ux
ν @ 1 
(7.15c)
1For a curved wall, x can represent the arc length along the wall and y can be everywhere normal to x 
with negligible change in the boundary layer equations as long as the radius of curvature of the wall is 
large compared with the boundary layer thickness [1 to 3].

458 Chapter 7 Flow Past Immersed Bodies 
Our discussion of displacement thickness in the previous section was intended to 
justify these assumptions.
 
Applying these approximations to Eq. (7.14c) results in a powerful simplifi cation:
ρ au 0υ
0x b 1 ρ aυ 0υ
0y b 5 20p
0y 1 μ a 02υ
0x2 b 1 μ a 02υ
0y2 b
 
small 
small 
very small 
small
 
0p
0y < 0   or   p < p(x)  only 
(7.16)
In other words, the y-momentum equation can be neglected entirely, and the pressure 
varies only along the boundary layer, not through it. The pressure gradient term in 
Eq. (7.14b) is assumed to be known in advance from Bernoulli’s equation applied to 
the outer inviscid fl ow:
 
0p
0x 5 dp
dx 5 2ρU dU
dx  
(7.17)
Presumably we have already made the inviscid analysis and know the distribution of 
U(x) along the wall (Chap. 8).
 
Meanwhile, one term in Eq. (7.14b) is negligible due to Eqs. (7.15):
 
02u
0x2 ! 02u
0y2 
(7.18)
However, neither term in the continuity relation (7.14a) can be neglected—another 
warning that continuity is always a vital part of any fl uid fl ow analysis.
 
The net result is that the three full equations of motion (7.14) are reduced to 
Prandtl’s two boundary layer equations for two-dimensional incompressible fl ow:
Continuity: 
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 5 0 
(7.19a)
Momentum along wall: 
u 0u

(7.19b)
where 
τ 5 µ

μ 0u

These are to be solved for u(x, y) and υ(x, y), with U(x) assumed to be a known 
function from the outer inviscid fl ow analysis. There are two boundary conditions on u 
and one on υ:
At y 5 0 (wall): 
 u 5 υ 5 0 
(no slip) 
(7.20a)
As y 5 δ(x) (other stream):

(patching) 
(7.20b)
Unlike the Navier-Stokes equations (7.14), which are mathematically elliptic and must 
be solved simultaneously over the entire fl ow fi eld, the boundary layer equations (7.19) 

7.4  The Flat-Plate Boundary Layer 459
are mathematically parabolic and are solved by beginning at the leading edge and 
marching downstream as far as you like, stopping at the separation point or earlier if 
you prefer.2
 
The boundary layer equations have been solved for scores of interesting cases of 
internal and external fl ow for both laminar and turbulent fl ow, utilizing the inviscid 
distribution U(x) appropriate to each fl ow. Full details of boundary layer theory and 
results and comparison with experiment are given in Refs. 1 to 3. Here we shall 
confi ne ourselves primarily to fl at-plate solutions (Sec. 7.4).
7.4 The Flat-Plate Boundary 
Layer
 
The classic and most often used solution of boundary layer theory is for fl at-plate fl ow, 
as in Fig. 7.3, which can represent either laminar or turbulent fl ow.
Laminar Flow
 
For laminar fl ow past the plate, the boundary layer equations (7.19) can be solved 
exactly for u and υ, assuming that the free-stream velocity U is constant (dU/dx 5 0). 
The solution was given by Prandtl’s student Blasius, in his 1908 dissertation from 
Göttingen. With an ingenious coordinate transformation, Blasius showed that the 
dimensionless velocity profi le u/U is a function only of the single composite dimen-
sionless variable (y)[U/(νx)]1/2:
 
u
U 5 f¿(η)  η 5 y a U
νxb
1/2
 
(7.21)
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to η. Substitution of (7.21) into 
the boundary layer equations (7.19) reduces the problem, after much algebra, to a 
single third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for f [1–3]:
 
f Ô 1 1
2 ff– 5 0 
(7.22)
The boundary conditions (7.20) become
At y 5 0: 
f(0) 5 f ¿(0) 5 0 
(7.23a)
As y S ∞: 
f ¿(∞) S 1.0 
(7.23b)
This is the Blasius equation, for which accurate solutions have been obtained only by 
numerical integration. Some tabulated values of the velocity profi le shape f'(η) 5 u/U 
are given in Table 7.1.
 
Since u/U approaches 1.0 only as y → q, it is customary to select the boundary 
layer thickness δ as that point where u/U 5 0.99. From the table, this occurs at 
η < 5.0:

With the profi le known, Blasius, of course, could also compute the wall shear and 
displacement thickness:

(7.25)
Notice how close these are to our integral estimates, Eqs. (7.9), (7.10), and (7.13). 
When cf is converted to dimensional form, we have
τw(x) 5 0.332ρ1/2μ1/2U1.5
x1/2
The wall shear drops off with x1/2 because of boundary layer growth and varies as 
velocity to the 1.5 power. This is in contrast to laminar pipe fl ow, where τw ~ U and 
is independent of x.
 
If τw(x) is substituted into Eq. (7.4), we compute the total drag force:
D(x) 5 b#
x
0
τw(x) dx 5 0.664bρ1/2μ1/2U1.5x1/2 
(7.26)
The drag increases only as the square root of the plate length. The nondimensional 
drag coeffi cient is defi ned as
CD 5 2D(L)
ρU2bL 5 1.328

(7.27)
 Thus,  for  laminar  plate  fl ow,  C D  equals  twice  the  value  of  the  skin  fri c tion  coeffi cient 
 at  the  trailing  edge.  This  is  the  drag  on  one  side  of  the  plate. 
 
Kármán  pointed  out  that  the  drag  could  also  be  computed  from  the  momentum 
 relation  (7.2).  In  dimensionless  form,  Eq.  (7.2)  becomes

Since δ is so ill defi ned, the momentum thickness, being defi nite, is often used to 
correlate data taken for a variety of boundary layers under differing conditions. The 
ratio of displacement to momentum thickness, called the dimensionless-profi le shape 
factor, is also useful in integral theories. For laminar fl at-plate fl ow
 
H 5 δ*
θ 5 1.721

(7.31)
A large shape factor then implies that boundary layer separation is about to occur.
 
If we plot the Blasius velocity profi le from Table 7.1 in the form of u/U versus 
y/δ, we can see why the simple integral theory guess, Eq. (7.6), was such a great 
success. This is done in Fig. 7.5. The simple parabolic approximation is not far from 
the true Blasius profi le; hence its momentum thickness is within 10 percent of the 
true value. Also shown in Fig. 7.5 are three typical turbulent fl at-plate velocity pro-
fi les. Notice how strikingly different in shape they are from the laminar profi les.

462 Chapter 7 Flow Past Immersed Bodies 
Instead of decreasing parabolically to zero, the turbulent profi les are very fl at and then 
drop off sharply at the wall. As you might guess, they follow the logarithmic law 
shape and thus can be analyzed by momentum integral theory if this shape is properly 
represented.
Transition to Turbulence
 
The laminar fl at-plate boundary layer eventually becomes turbulent, but there is no 
unique value for this change to occur. With care in polishing the wall and keeping 
the free stream quiet, one can delay the transition Reynolds number to Rex,tr < 
3 E6 [8]. However, for typical commercial surfaces and gusty free streams, a more 
realistic value is
Rex,tr < 5 E5.
EXAMPLE 7.3
A sharp fl at plate with L 5 50 cm and b 5 3 m is parallel to a stream of velocity 2.5 m/s. 
Find the drag on one side of the plate, and the boundary thickness δ at the trailing edge, 
for (a) air and (b) water at 208C and 1 atm.
Solution
• Assumptions: Laminar fl at-plate fl ow, but we should check the Reynolds numbers.
• Approach: Find the Reynolds number and use the appropriate boundary layer formulas.

7.4  The Flat-Plate Boundary Layer 463
This is a quandary. If the plate is rough or encounters disturbances, the fl ow at the trailing

• Comment (b): The drag is 215 times larger for water, although CD is lower, refl ecting that 
water is 56 times more viscous and 830 times denser than air. From Eq. (7.26), for the same 
U and x, the water drag should be (56)1/2(830)1/2 < 215 times higher. Note: If transition to 
turbulence had occurred at Rex 5 5 E5 (at about x 5 20 cm), the drag would be about 2.5 
times higher, and the trailing edge thickness about four times higher than for fully laminar fl ow.
Turbulent Flow
 
There is no exact theory for turbulent fl at-plate fl ow, although there are many elegant 
computer solutions of the boundary layer equations using various empirical models 
for the turbulent eddy viscosity [9]. The most widely accepted result is simply an 
integral analysis similar to our study of the laminar profi le approximation (7.6).
 
We begin with Eq. (7.5), which is valid for laminar or turbulent fl ow. We write it 
here for convenient reference:
 
τw(x) 5 ρU2
 dθ
dx 
(7.32)
From the defi nition of cf, Eq. (7.10), this can be rewritten as
 
cf 5 2dθ
dx 
(7.33)
Now recall from Fig. 7.5 that the turbulent profi les are nowhere near parabolic. Going 
back to Fig. 6.10, we see that fl at-plate fl ow is very nearly logarithmic, with a slight 
outer wake and a thin viscous sublayer. Therefore, just as in turbulent pipe fl ow, we 
assume that the logarithmic law (6.28) holds all the way across the boundary layer

with, as usual, κ 5 0.41 and B 5 5.0. At the outer edge of the boundary layer, y 5 δ 
and u 5 U, and Eq. (7.34) becomes
 
U

and simply fi t the numbers in the table to a power-law approximation:
cf < 0.02 Re21/6
δ
 
(7.38)
This we shall use as the left-hand side of Eq. (7.33). For the right-hand side, we need 
an estimate for θ(x) in terms of δ(x). If we use the logarithmic law profi le (7.34), we 
shall be up to our hips in logarithmic integrations for the momentum thickness. Instead 
we follow another suggestion of Prandtl, who pointed out that the turbulent profi les 
in Fig. 7.5 can be approximated by a one-seventh-power law:

This is shown as a dashed line in Fig. 7.5. It is an excellent fi t to the low-Reynolds-

Thus the thickness of a turbulent boundary layer increases as x6/7, far more rapidly 
than the laminar increase x1/2. Equation (7.42) is the solution to the problem, because

Turbulent plate friction drops slowly with x, increases nearly as ρ and U2, and is 
rather insensitive to viscosity.

Figure 7.6 shows fl at-plate drag coeffi cients for both laminar and turbulent fl ow 
conditions. The smooth-wall relations (7.27) and (7.45) are shown, along with the 
effect of wall roughness, which is quite strong. The proper roughness parameter 
here is x/ε or L/ε, by analogy with the pipe parameter ε/d. In the fully rough regime, 
CD is independent of the Reynolds number, so that the drag varies exactly as U2 and 
is independent of μ. Reference 2 presents a theory of rough fl at-plate fl ow, and Ref. 1

This is 7.5 times thicker than a fully laminar boundary layer at the same Reynolds number.

7.5 Boundary Layers with 
Pressure Gradient3
 
The fl at-plate analysis of the previous section should give us a good feeling for the 
behavior of both laminar and turbulent boundary layers, except for one important 
effect: fl ow separation. Prandtl showed that separation like that in Fig. 7.2b is caused 
by excessive momentum loss near the wall in a boundary layer trying to move down-
stream against increasing pressure, dp/dx . 0, which is called an adverse pressure 
gradient. The opposite case of decreasing pressure, dp/dx , 0, is called a favorable 
gradient, where fl ow separation can never occur. In a typical immersed-body fl ow, 
such as in Fig. 7.2b, the favorable gradient is on the front of the body and the adverse 
gradient is in the rear, as discussed in detail in Chap. 8.
 
We can explain fl ow separation with a geometric argument about the second deriv-
ative of velocity u at the wall. From the momentum equation (7.19b) at the wall, 
where u 5 υ 5 0, we obtain
0τ
0y `

5 μ 02u
0y2 `
wall
5 2ρU dU
dx 5 dp
dx
or 
02u
0y2 `

5 1
μ dp
dx 
(7.50)
for either laminar or turbulent fl ow. Thus in an adverse gradient the second deriva-
tive of velocity is positive at the wall; yet it must be negative at the outer layer 
(y 5 δ) to merge smoothly with the mainstream fl ow U(x). It follows that the second 
derivative must pass through zero somewhere in between, at a point of infl ection, 
and any boundary layer profi le in an adverse gradient must exhibit a characteristic 
S shape.
 
Figure 7.7 illustrates the general case. In a favorable gradient (Fig. 7.7a) the 
profile is very rounded, there is no point of inflection, there can be no separa-
tion, and laminar profiles of this type are very resistant to a transition to turbu-
lence [1 to 3].
 
In a zero pressure gradient (Fig. 7.7b), such as a fl at-plate fl ow, the point of infl ec-
tion is at the wall itself. There can be no separation, and the fl ow will undergo transi-
tion at Rex no greater than about 3 3 106, as discussed earlier.
 
In an adverse gradient (Fig. 7.7c to e), a point of infl ection (PI) occurs in the 
boundary layer, its distance from the wall increasing with the strength of the 
adverse gradient. For a weak gradient (Fig. 7.7c) the fl ow does not actually sepa-
rate, but it is vulnerable to transition to turbulence at Rex as low as 105 [1, 2]. At 
a moderate gradient, a critical condition (Fig. 7.7d) is reached where the wall shear 
is exactly zero (∂u/∂y 5 0). This is defi ned as the separation point (τw 5 0), 
because any stronger gradient will actually cause backfl ow at the wall (Fig. 7.7e): 
the boundary layer thickens greatly, and the main fl ow breaks away, or separates, 
from the wall (Fig. 7.2b).
 
The fl ow profi les of Fig. 7.7 usually occur in sequence as the boundary layer 
progresses along the wall of a body. For example, in Fig. 7.2a, a favorable gradient 
occurs on the front of the body, zero pressure gradient occurs just upstream of the 
shoulder, and an adverse gradient occurs successively as we move around the rear of 
the body.

7.5  Boundary Layers with Pressure Gradient 469
 
A second practical example is the fl ow in a duct consisting of a nozzle, throat, 
and diffuser, as in Fig. 7.8. The nozzle fl ow is a favorable gradient and never 
separates, nor does the throat fl ow where the pressure gradient is approximately 
zero. But the expanding-area diffuser produces low velocity and increasing pres-
sure, an adverse gradient. If the diffuser angle is too large, the adverse gradient is 
excessive, and the boundary layer will separate at one or both walls, with backfl ow,

increased losses, and poor pressure recovery. In the diffuser literature [10] this 
condition is called diffuser stall, a term used also in airfoil aerodynamics (Sec. 7.6) 
to denote airfoil boundary layer separation. Thus the boundary layer behavior 
explains why a large-angle diffuser has heavy fl ow losses (Fig. 6.23) and poor 
performance (Fig. 6.28).
 
Presently boundary layer theory can compute only up to the separation point, after 
which it is invalid. Techniques are now developed for analyzing the strong interaction 
effects caused by separated fl ows [5, 6].
Laminar Integral Theory4
 
Both laminar and turbulent theories can be developed from Kármán’s general two-
dimensional boundary layer integral relation [2, 7], which extends Eq. (7.33) to vari-
able U(x) by integration across the boundary layer:

where θ(x) is the momentum thickness and H(x) 5 δ*(x)/θ(x) is the shape factor. 
From Eq. (7.17) negative dU/dx is equivalent to positive dp/dx—that is, an adverse 
gradient.
 
We can integrate Eq. (7.51) to determine θ(x) for a given U(x) if we correlate cf 
and H with the momentum thickness. This has been done by examining typical veloc-
ity profi les of laminar and turbulent boundary layer fl ows for various pressure gradi-
ents. Some examples are given in Fig. 7.9, showing that the shape factor H is a good 
indicator of the pressure gradient. The higher the H, the stronger the adverse gradient, 
and separation occurs approximately at

The laminar profi les (Fig. 7.9a) clearly exhibit the S shape and a point of infl ection 
with an adverse gradient. But in the turbulent profi les (Fig. 7.9b) the points of infl ec-
tion are typically buried deep within the thin viscous sublayer, which can hardly be 
seen on the scale of the fi gure.
 
There are scores of turbulent theories in the literature, but they are all compli-
cated algebraically and will be omitted here. The reader is referred to advanced 
texts [1–3, 9].

For laminar fl ow, a simple and effective method was developed by Thwaites [11], 
who found that Eq. (7.51) can be correlated by a single dimensionless momentum 
thickness variable λ, defi ned as
 
λ 5 θ2
v  dU
dx  
(7.53)
Using a straight-line fi t to his correlation, Thwaites was able to integrate Eq. (7.51) 
in closed form, with the result
 
θ2 5 θ0
2 aU0
U b
6
1 0.45ν
U6  #

U5 dx 
(7.54)
where θ0 is the momentum thickness at x 5 0 (usually taken to be zero). Separation 
(cf 5 0) was found to occur at a particular value of λ:
Separation: 
λ 5 20.09 
(7.55)
Finally, Thwaites correlated values of the dimensionless shear stress S 5 τwθ/(μU) 
with λ, and his graphed result can be curve-fi tted as follows:
 
S(λ) 5 τwθ
μU < (λ 1 0.09)0.62 
(7.56)
This parameter is related to the skin friction by the identity
 
S ; 1
2cf Reθ 
(7.57)
Equations (7.54) to (7.56) constitute a complete theory for the laminar boundary layer 
with variable U(x), with an accuracy of 610 percent compared with computer solu-
tions of the laminar-boundary-layer equations (7.19). Complete details of Thwaites’s 
and other laminar theories are given in Ref. 2.
 
As a demonstration of Thwaites’s method, take a fl at plate, where U 5 constant, 
λ 5 0, and θ0 5 0. Equation (7.54) integrates to

This is within 1 percent of Blasius’s numerical solution, Eq. (7.30).
 
With λ 5 0, Eq. (7.56) predicts the fl at-plate shear to be

or 
cf 5 2τw

This is also within 1 percent of the Blasius result, Eq. (7.25). However, the general 
accuracy of this method is poorer than 1 percent because Thwaites actually “tuned” 
his correlation constants to make them agree with exact fl at-plate theory.
 
We shall not compute any more boundary layer details here; but as we go 
along, investigating various immersed-body fl ows, especially in Chap. 8, we shall

use Thwaites’s method to make qualitative assessments of the boundary layer

7.6 Experimental External 
Flows
 
Boundary layer theory is very interesting and illuminating and gives us a great qualita-
tive grasp of viscous fl ow behavior; but, because of fl ow separation, the theory does 
not generally allow a quantitative computation of the complete fl ow fi eld. In particu-
lar, there is at present no satisfactory theory, except CFD results, for the forces on an 
arbitrary body immersed in a stream fl owing at an arbitrary Reynolds number. There-
fore, experimentation is the key to treating external fl ows.
 
Literally thousands of papers in the literature report experimental data on specifi c 
external viscous fl ows. This section gives a brief description of the following external 
fl ow problems:
1. Drag of two- and three-dimensional bodies:
a. Blunt bodies.
b. Streamlined shapes.
2. Performance of lifting bodies:
a. Airfoils and aircraft.
b. Projectiles and fi nned bodies.
c. 
Birds and insects.
For further reading see the goldmine of data compiled in Hoerner [12]. In later chapters 
we shall study data on supersonic airfoils (Chap. 9), open-channel friction (Chap. 10), 
and turbomachinery performance (Chap. 11).
Drag of Immersed Bodies
 
Any body of any shape when immersed in a fl uid stream will experience forces and 
moments from the fl ow. If the body has arbitrary shape and orientation, the fl ow will 
exert forces and moments about all three coordinate axes, as shown in Fig. 7.10. It 
is customary to choose one axis parallel to the free stream and positive downstream. 
The force on the body along this axis is called drag, and the moment about that axis 
the rolling moment. The drag is essentially a fl ow loss and must be overcome if the 
body is to move against the stream.
 
A second and very important force is perpendicular to the drag and usually per-
forms a useful job, such as bearing the weight of the body. It is called the lift. The 
moment about the lift axis is called yaw.
 
The third component, neither a loss nor a gain, is the side force, and about this 
axis is the pitching moment. To deal with this three-dimensional force-moment situ-
ation is more properly the role of a textbook on aerodynamics [for example, 13]. We 
shall limit the discussion here to lift and drag.

7.6  Experimental External Flows 475
 
When the body has symmetry about the lift–drag axis, as with airplanes, ships, and 
cars moving directly into a stream, the side force, yaw, and roll vanish, and the prob-
lem reduces to a two-dimensional case: two forces, lift and drag, and one moment, 
pitch.
 
A fi nal simplifi cation often occurs when the body has two planes of symmetry, as 
in Fig. 7.11. A wide variety of shapes such as cylinders, wings, and all bodies of 
revolution satisfy this requirement. If the free stream is parallel to the intersection of 
these two planes, called the principal chord line of the body, the body experiences 
drag only, with no lift, side force, or moments.5 This type of degenerate one-force 
drag data is what is most commonly reported in the literature, but if the free stream 
is not parallel to the chord line, the body will have an unsymmetric orientation and 
all three forces and three moments can arise in principle.
 
In low-speed fl ow past geometrically similar bodies with identical orientation and 
relative roughness, the drag coeffi cient should be a function of the body Reynolds 
number:

force, and moments, but their mean value is zero.

The Reynolds number is based upon the free-stream velocity V and a characteristic 
length L of the body, usually the chord or body length parallel to the stream:
Re 5 VL
ν  
(7.61)
For cylinders, spheres, and disks, the characteristic length is the diameter D.
Characteristic Area
Drag coeffi cients are defi ned by using a characteristic area A, which may differ 
depending on the body shape:
CD 5 drag

(7.62)
The factor 1
2 is our traditional tribute to Euler and Bernoulli. The area A is usually 
one of three types:
1. Frontal area, the body as seen from the stream; suitable for thick, stubby bodies, 
such as spheres, cylinders, cars, trucks, missiles, projectiles, and torpedoes.
2. Planform area, the body area as seen from above; suitable for wide, fl at bodies 
such as wings and hydrofoils.
3. Wetted area, customary for surface ships and barges.
In using drag or other fl uid force data, it is important to note what length and area 
are being used to scale the measured coeffi cients.
Friction Drag and Pressure Drag  
As we have mentioned, the theory of drag is weak and inadequate, except for the fl at 
plate. This is because of fl ow separation. Boundary layer theory can predict the sepa-
ration point but cannot accurately estimate the (usually low) pressure distribution in 
the separated region. The difference between the high pressure in the front stagnation 
region and the low pressure in the rear separated region causes a large drag contribu-
tion called pressure drag. This is added to the integrated shear stress or friction drag
of the body, which it often exceeds:
CD 5 CD,press 1 CD,fric 
(7.63)
The relative contribution of friction and pressure drag depends upon the body’s 
shape, especially its thickness. Figure 7.12 shows drag data for a streamlined cyl-
inder of very large depth into the paper. At zero thickness the body is a fl at plate 
and exhibits 100 percent friction drag. At thickness equal to the chord length, simu-
lating a circular cylinder, the friction drag is only about 3 percent. Friction and 
pressure drag are about equal at thickness t/c 5 0.25. Note that CD in Fig. 7.12b
looks quite different when based on frontal area instead of planform area, planform 
being the usual choice for this body shape. The two curves in Fig. 7.12b represent 
exactly the same drag data.

7.6  Experimental External Flows 477
 
Figure 7.13 illustrates the dramatic effect of separated fl ow and the subsequent 
failure of boundary layer theory. The theoretical inviscid pressure distribution on a 
circular cylinder (Chap. 8) is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 7.13c:
Cp 5 p 2 pq
1
2 ρV2
5 1 2 4 sin2 θ
where Pq and V are the pressure and velocity, respectively, in the free stream. The 
actual laminar and turbulent boundary layer pressure distributions in Fig. 7.13c are 
startlingly different from those predicted by theory. Laminar fl ow is very vulnerable 
to the adverse gradient on the rear of the cylinder, and separation occurs at θ 5 
828, which certainly could not have been predicted from inviscid theory. The broad 
wake and very low pressure in the separated laminar region cause the large drag 
CD 5 1.2.
 
The turbulent boundary layer in Fig. 7.13b is more resistant, and separation is 
delayed until θ 5 1208, with a resulting smaller wake, higher pressure on the rear, 
and 75 percent less drag, CD 5 0.3. This explains the sharp drop in drag at transition 
in Fig. 5.3.

The same sharp difference between vulnerable laminar separation and resistant tur-
bulent separation can be seen for a sphere in Fig. 7.14. The laminar fl ow (Fig. 7.14a) 
separates at about 808, CD 5 0.5, while the turbulent fl ow (Fig. 7.14b) separates at 1208, 
CD 5 0.2. Here the Reynolds numbers are exactly the same, and the turbulent boundary 
layer is induced by a patch of sand roughness at the nose of the ball. Golf balls fl y in 
this range of Reynolds numbers, which is why they are deliberately dimpled—to induce 
a turbulent boundary layer and lower drag. Again we would fi nd the actual pressure 
distribution on the sphere to be quite different from that predicted by inviscid theory.
 
In general, we cannot overstress the importance of body streamlining to reduce drag 
at Reynolds numbers above about 100. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.15. The rectangular 
cylinder (Fig. 7.15a) has separation at all sharp corners and very high drag. Rounding 
its nose (Fig. 7.15b) reduces drag by about 45 percent, but CD is still high. Streamlin-
ing its rear to a sharp trailing edge (Fig. 7.15c) reduces its drag another 85 percent to 
a practical minimum for the given thickness. As a dramatic contrast, the circular 
cylinder (Fig. 7.15d) has one-eighth the thickness and one-three-hundredth the cross

other moving bodies, the name of the game is drag reduction, for which intense 
research continues for both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications [20, 39].
 Two-Dimensional  Bodies 
 
The drag of some representative wide-span (nearly two-dimensional) bodies is shown 
versus the Reynolds number in Fig. 7.16a. All bodies have high CD at very low 
(creeping fl ow) Re # 1.0, while they spread apart at high Reynolds numbers according 
to their degree of streamlining. All values of CD are based on the planform area except 
the plate normal to the fl ow. The birds and the sailplane are, of course, not very two-
dimensional, having only modest span length. Note that birds are not nearly as effi -
cient as modern sailplanes or airfoils [14, 15].
 Creeping  Flow 
 
In 1851 G. G. Stokes showed that, if the Reynolds number is very small, Re ! 1, 
the acceleration terms in the Navier-Stokes equations (7.14b, c) are negligible. The 
fl ow is termed creeping fl ow, or Stokes fl ow, and is a balance between pressure

If the geometry is simple (for example, a sphere or disk), closed-form solutions can 
be found and the body drag can be computed [2]. Stokes himself provided the sphere

sensitive to whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent.
 EXAMPLE  7.6 
A square 6-in piling is acted on by a water fl ow of 5 ft/s that is 20 ft deep, as shown in 
Fig. E7.6. Estimate the maximum bending exerted by the fl ow on the bottom of the piling.
 Solution 
Assume seawater with ρ 5 1.99 slugs/ft3 and kinematic viscosity ν 5 0.000011 ft2/s. With a 
piling width of 0.5 ft, we have
Reh 5 (5 ft/s)(0.5 ft)
0.000011 ft2/s 5 2.3 3 105
This is the range where Table 7.2 applies. The worst case occurs when the fl ow strikes the 
fl at side of the piling, CD < 2.1. The frontal area is A 5 Lh 5 (20 ft)(0.5 ft) 5 10 ft2. The 
drag is estimated by

that is insensitive to the Reynolds number. Rounded bodies like the ellipsoid have drag 
that depends on the point of separation, so both the Reynolds number and the character 
of the boundary layer are important. Body length will generally decrease pressure drag 
by making the body relatively more slender, but sooner or later the friction drag will 
catch up. For the fl at-faced cylinder in Table 7.3, pressure drag decreases with L/d but 
friction increases, so minimum drag occurs at about L/d 5 2.
Buoyant Rising Light Spheres
 
The sphere data in Fig. 7.16b are for fi xed models in wind tunnels and from falling 
sphere tests and indicate a drag coeffi cient of about 0.5 in the range 1 E3 , Red , 1 E5. 
It was pointed out [50] that this is not the case for a freely rising buoyant sphere or 
bubble. If the sphere is light, ρsphere , 0.8 ρfl uid, a wake instability arises in the range 
135 , Red , 1 E5. The sphere then spirals upward at an angle of about 608 from the 
horizontal. The drag coeffi cient is approximately doubled, to an average value CD < 
0.95, as listed in Table 7.3 [50]. For a heavier body, ρsphere < ρfl uid, the buoyant sphere 
rises vertically and the drag coeffi cient follows the standard curve in Fig. 7.16b.
EXAMPLE 7.7
According to Ref. 12, the drag coeffi cient of a blimp, based on surface area, is approximately 
0.006 if ReL . 106. A certain blimp is 75 m long and has a surface area of 3400 m2. Esti-
mate the power required to propel this blimp at 18 m/s at a standard altitude of 1000 m.
Solution
• Assumptions: We hope the Reynolds number will be high enough that the given data 
are valid.
• Approach: Determine if ReL . 106 and, if so, compute the drag and the power required.
• Property values: Table A.6 at z 5 1000 m: ρ 5 1.112 kg/m3, T 5 282 K, thus μ < 
1.75 E-5 kg/m ? s.

• Comments: These are nominal estimates. Drag is highly dependent on both shape and 
Reynolds number, and the coeffi cient CD 5 0.006 has considerable uncertainty.
Aerodynamic Forces on Road 
Vehicles
 
Automobiles and trucks are now the subject of much research on aerodynamic forces, 
both lift and drag [21]. At least one textbook is devoted to the subject [22]. A very 
readable description of race car drag is given by Katz [51]. Consumer, manufacturer, 
and government interest has cycled between high speed/high horsepower and lower 

7.6  Experimental External Flows 485
speed/lower drag. Better streamlining of car shapes has resulted over the years in a 
large decrease in the automobile drag coeffi cient, as shown in Fig. 7.17a. Modern 
cars have an average drag coeffi cient of about 0.25, based on the frontal area. Since 
the frontal area has also decreased sharply, the actual raw drag force on cars has 
dropped even more than indicated in Fig. 7.17a. The theoretical minimum shown in 
the fi gure, CD < 0.15, is about right for a commercial automobile, but lower values 
are possible for experimental vehicles; see Prob. P7.109. Note that basing CD on the 
frontal area is awkward, since one would need an accurate drawing of the automobile 
to estimate its frontal area. For this reason, some technical articles simply report the 
raw drag in newtons or pound-force, or the product CDA.
 
Many companies and laboratories have automotive wind tunnels, some full-
scale and/or with moving fl oors to approximate actual kinematic similarity. The blunt 
shapes of most automobiles, together with their proximity to the ground, cause a wide 
variety of fl ow and geometric effects. Simple changes in part of the shape can have

a large infl uence on aerodynamic forces. Figure 7.17b shows force data by Bearman 
et al. [25] for an idealized smooth automobile shape with upsweep in the rear of the 
bottom section. We see that by simply adding an upsweep angle of 258, we can qua-
druple the downward force, gaining tire traction at the expense of doubling the drag. 
For this study, the effect of a moving fl oor was small—about a 10 percent increase 
in both drag and lift compared to a fi xed fl oor.
 
It is diffi cult to quantify the exact effect of geometric changes on automotive 
forces, since, for example, changes in a windshield shape might interact with down-
stream fl ow over the roof and trunk. Nevertheless, based on correlation of many model 
and full-scale tests, Ref. 26 proposes a formula for automobile drag that adds separate 
effects such as front ends, cowls, fenders, windshield, roofs, and rear ends.
 
Figure 7.18a illustrates the power required to drive a typical tractor-trailer truck. 
An approximation is that the rolling resistance increases linearly and the drag qua-
dratically with speed. The two are about equal at 55 mi/h. Figure 7.18b shows that 
air drag can be reduced by attaching a defl ector to the top of the cab. When the 
defl ector angle is adjusted to carry the fl ow smoothly over the top and sides of the 
trailer, the reduction in CD is about 20 percent. This type of applied fl uids engineering 
is very important for modern transportation problems [58].
 
The velocity effect on rolling resistance is mostly due to the engine-transmission-wheel-
bearing system. The tires generally have a nearly constant rolling resistance coeffi cient,
Crr 5 Frr
N
where Frr is the resistance force and N is the normal force on the tires [61]. This 
coeffi cient Crr is analogous to a solid friction factor but is much smaller: about 0.01 
to 0.04 for passenger car tires and 0.006 to 0.01 for truck tires.
 
Progress in computational fl uid dynamics means that complicated vehicle fl ow fi elds 
can be predicted fairly well. Reference 42 compares one-equation and two-equation 
turbulence models [9] with NASA data for a simplifi ed tractor-trailer model. Even with 
two million mesh points, the predicted vehicle drag is from 20 to 50 percent higher 
than the measurements. The turbulence models do not reproduce the pressures and wake

EXAMPLE 7.8
A high-speed car with m 5 2000 kg, CD 5 0.3, and A 5 1 m2 deploys a 2-m parachute to 
slow down from an initial velocity of 100 m/s (Fig. E7.8). Assuming constant CD, brakes 
free, and no rolling resistance, calculate the distance and velocity of the car after 1, 10, 100, 
and 1000 s. For air assume ρ 5 1.2 kg/m3, and neglect interference between the wake of

Other Methods of Drag Reduction  
Sometimes drag is good, for example, when using a parachute. Do not jump out 
of an airplane holding a fl at plate parallel to your motion (see Prob. P7.81). Mostly, 
though, drag is bad and should be reduced. The classical method of drag reduction 
is streamlining (Figs. 7.15 and 7.18). For example, nose fairings and body panels 
have produced motorcycles that can travel over 200 mi/h. More recent research 
has uncovered other methods that hold great promise, especially for turbulent 
fl ows.
1. Oil pipelines introduce an annular strip of water to reduce the pumping power 
[36]. The low-viscosity water rides the wall and reduces friction up to 60 percent.
2. Turbulent friction in liquid flows is reduced up to 60 percent by dissolving 
small amounts of a high-molecular-weight polymer additive [37]. Without 
changing pumps, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) increased oil 
flow 50 percent by injecting small amounts of polymer dissolved in 
kerosene.
3. Stream-oriented surface vee-groove microriblets can reduce turbulent friction up 
to 8 percent [38]. Riblet heights are of order 1 mm and were used on the Stars 
and Stripes yacht hull in the Americas Cup races. Riblets are also effective on 
aircraft skins.
4. Small, near-wall large-eddy breakup devices (LEBUs) reduce local turbulent 
friction up to 10 percent [39]. However, one must add these small structures to 
the surface, and LEBU drag may be signifi cant.
5. Air microbubbles injected at the wall of a water fl ow create a low-shear bubble 
blanket [40]. At high void fractions, drag reduction can be 80 percent.
6. Spanwise (transverse) wall oscillation may reduce turbulent friction up to 
30 percent [41].
7. Active fl ow control, especially of turbulent fl ows, is the wave of the future, as 
reviewed in Ref. 47. These methods generally require expenditure of energy 
but can be worth it. For example, tangential blowing at the rear of an auto [48] 
evokes the Coanda effect, in which the separated near-wake fl ow attaches itself 
to the body surface and reduces auto drag up to 10 percent.
Drag reduction is presently an area of intense and fruitful research and applies to 
many types of airfl ows [39, 53] and water fl ows for both vehicles and conduits.
Drag of Surface Ships
 
The drag data given so far, such as Tables 7.2 and 7.3, are for bodies “fully immersed” 
in a free stream—that is, with no free surface. If, however, the body moves at or near 

7.6  Experimental External Flows 489
a free liquid surface, wave-making drag becomes important and is dependent on both 
the Reynolds number and the Froude number. To move through a water surface, a 
ship must create waves on both sides. This implies putting energy into the water 
surface and requires a fi nite drag force to keep the ship moving, even in a frictionless 
fl uid. The total drag of a ship can then be approximated as the sum of friction drag 
and wave-making drag:
F < Ffric 1 Fwave    or   CD < CD,fric 1 CD,wave
The friction drag can be estimated by the (turbulent) fl at-plate formula, Eq. (7.45), 
based on the below-water or wetted area of the ship.
 
Reference 27 is an interesting review of both theory and experiment for wake-
making surface ship drag. Generally speaking, the bow of the ship creates a wave 
system whose wavelength is related to the ship speed but not necessarily to the ship 
length. If the stern of the ship is a wave trough, the ship is essentially climbing uphill 
and has high wave drag. If the stern is a wave crest, the ship is nearly level and has 
lower drag. The criterion for these two conditions results in certain approximate 
Froude numbers [27]:
 
Fr 5
V
1gL < 0.53
1N   high drag if N 5 1, 3, 5, 7, p ;
 low drag if N 5 2, 4, 6, 8, p
 
(7.65)
where V is the ship’s speed, L is the ship’s length along the centerline, and N is the 
number of half-lengths, from bow to stern, of the drag-making wave system. The 
wave drag will increase with the Froude number and oscillate between lower drag 
(Fr < 0.38, 0.27, 0.22, . . .) and higher drag (Fr < 0.53, 0.31, 0.24, . . .) with neg-
ligible variation for Fr , 0.2. Thus it is best to design a ship to cruise at N 5 2, 4, 
6, 8. Shaping the bow and stern can further reduce wave-making drag.
 
Figure 7.19 shows the data of Inui [27] for a model ship. The main hull, curve A, 
shows peaks and valleys in wave drag at the appropriate Froude numbers . 0.2. 
Introduction of a bulb protrusion on the bow, curve B, greatly reduces the drag. Add-
ing a second bulb to the stern, curve C, is still better, and Inui recommends that the 
design speed of this two-bulb ship be at N 5 4, Fr < 0.27, which is a nearly “wave-
less” condition. In this fi gure CD,wave is defi ned as 2Fwave/(ρV2L2) instead of using the 
wetted area.
 
The solid curves in Fig. 7.19 are based on potential fl ow theory for the below-water 
hull shape. Chapter 8 is an introduction to potential fl ow theory. Modern computers 
can be programmed for numerical CFD solutions of potential fl ow over the hulls of 
ships, submarines, yachts, and sailboats, including boundary layer effects driven by 
the potential fl ow [28]. Thus theoretical prediction of fl ow past surface ships is now 
at a fairly high level. See also Ref. 15.
Body Drag at High Mach 
Numbers
 
All the data presented to this point are for nearly incompressible fl ows, with Mach 
numbers assumed less than about 0.3. Beyond this value compressibility can be 
very important, with CD 5 fcn(Re, Ma). As the stream Mach number increases, at 
some subsonic value Mcrit , 1 that depends on the body’s bluntness and thickness, 
the local velocity at some point near the body surface will become sonic. If Ma 
increases beyond Macrit, shock waves form, intensify, and spread, raising surface 

490 Chapter 7 Flow Past Immersed Bodies 
pressures near the front of the body and therefore increasing the pressure drag. 
The effect can be dramatic with CD increasing tenfold, and 70 years ago this sharp 
increase was called the sonic barrier, implying that it could not be surmounted. 
Of course, it can be—the rise in CD is fi nite, as supersonic bullets have proved for 
centuries.
 
Figure 7.20 shows the effect of the Mach number on the drag coeffi cient of various 
body shapes tested in air.6 We see that compressibility affects blunt bodies earlier, 
with Macrit equal to 0.4 for cylinders, 0.6 for spheres, and 0.7 for airfoils and pointed 
projectiles. Also the Reynolds number (laminar versus turbulent boundary layer fl ow) 
has a large effect below Macrit for spheres and cylinders but becomes unimportant 
above Ma < 1. In contrast, the effect of the Reynolds number is small for airfoils 
and projectiles and is not shown in Fig. 7.20. A general statement might divide 
 Reynolds and Mach number effects as follows:
 Ma # 0.3: Reynolds number important, Mach number unimportant
 0.3 , Ma , 1: both Reynolds and Mach numbers important
 Ma . 1.0: Reynolds number unimportant, Mach number important
At supersonic speeds, a broad bow shock wave forms in front of the body (see Figs. 
9.10b and 9.19), and the drag is mainly due to high shock-induced pressures on the 
front. Making the bow a sharp point can sharply reduce the drag (Fig. 9.28) but

fl ow. References 30 and 31 are more advanced textbooks devoted entirely to com-
pressible fl ow.
Biological Drag Reduction
 
A great deal of engineering effort goes into designing immersed bodies to reduce their 
drag. Most such effort concentrates on rigid-body shapes. A different process occurs 
in nature, as organisms adapt to survive high winds or currents, as reported in a series 
of papers by S. Vogel [33, 34]. A good example is a tree, whose fl exible structure 
allows it to reconfi gure in high winds and thus reduce drag and damage. Tree root 
systems have evolved in several ways to resist wind-induced bending moments, and 
trunk cross sections have become resistant to bending but relatively easy to twist and 
reconfi gure. We saw this in Table 7.3, where tree drag coeffi cients [24] reduced by 
60 percent as wind velocity increased. The shape of the tree changes to offer less 
resistance.
 
The individual branches and leaves of a tree also curl and cluster to reduce drag. 
Figure 7.21 shows the results of wind tunnel experiments by Vogel [33]. A tulip tree 
leaf, Fig. 7.21a, broad and open in low wind, curls into a conical low-drag shape as 
wind increases. A compound black walnut leaf group, Fig. 7.21b, clusters into a low-
drag shape at high wind speed. Although drag coeffi cients were reduced up to 50 
percent by fl exibility, Vogel points out that rigid structures are sometimes just as 
effective. An interesting recent symposium [35] was devoted entirely to the solid 
mechanics and fl uid mechanics of biological organisms.

Forces on Lifting Bodies
 
Lifting bodies (airfoils, hydrofoils, or vanes) are intended to provide a large force 
normal to the free stream and as little drag as possible. Conventional design practice 
has evolved a shape not unlike a bird’s wing—that is, relatively thin (t/c # 0.24) 
with a rounded leading edge and a sharp trailing edge. A typical shape is sketched 
in Fig. 7.22.
 
For our purposes we consider the body to be symmetric, as in Fig. 7.11, with 
the free-stream velocity in the vertical plane. If the chord line between the leading 
and trailing edge is not a line of symmetry, the airfoil is said to be cambered. 
The camber line is the line midway between the upper and lower surfaces of the 
vane.
 
The angle between the free stream and the chord line is called the angle of attack 
α. The lift L and the drag D vary with this angle. The dimensionless forces are defi ned

For low-speed fl ow with a given roughness ratio, CL and CD should vary with α 
and the chord Reynolds number:
CL 5 f (α, Rec)    or    CD 5 f (α, Rec)
where Rec 5 Vc/ν. The Reynolds numbers are commonly in the turbulent boundary 
layer range and have a modest effect.
 
The rounded leading edge prevents fl ow separation there, but the sharp trailing 
edge causes a tangential wake motion that generates the lift. Figure 7.23 shows what 
happens when a fl ow starts up past a lifting vane or an airfoil.
 
Just after start-up in Fig. 7.23a the streamline motion is irrotational and inviscid. 
The rear stagnation point, assuming a positive angle of attack, is on the upper surface, 
and there is no lift; but the fl ow cannot long negotiate the sharp turn at the trailing 
edge: it separates, and a starting vortex forms in Fig. 7.23b. This starting vortex is 
shed downstream in Figs. 7.23c and d, and a smooth streamline fl ow develops over 
the wing, leaving the foil in a direction approximately parallel to the chord line. Lift 
at this time is fully developed, and the starting vortex is gone. Should the fl ow now 
cease, a stopping vortex of opposite (clockwise) sense will form and be shed. During 
fl ight, increases or decreases in lift will cause incremental starting or stopping vortices,

always with the effect of maintaining a smooth parallel fl ow at the trailing edge. We 
pursue this idea mathematically in Chap. 8.
 
At a low angle of attack, the rear surfaces have an adverse pressure gradient but 
not enough to cause signifi cant boundary layer separation. The fl ow pattern is smooth, 
as in Fig. 7.23d, and drag is small and lift excellent. As the angle of attack is increased, 
the upper-surface adverse gradient becomes stronger, and generally a separation bub-
ble begins to creep forward on the upper surface.7 At a certain angle α 5 15 to 208, 
the fl ow is separated completely from the upper surface, as in Fig. 7.24. The airfoil 
is said to be stalled: Lift drops off markedly, drag increases markedly, and the foil is 
no longer fl yable.
 
Early airfoils were thin, modeled after birds’ wings. The German engineer Otto 
Lilienthal (1848–1896) experimented with fl at and cambered plates on a rotating arm. 
He and his brother Gustav fl ew the world’s fi rst glider in 1891. Horatio Frederick 
Phillips (1845–1912) built the fi rst wind tunnel in 1884 and measured the lift and 
drag of cambered vanes. The fi rst theory of lift was proposed by Frederick W. Lanchester 
shortly afterward. Modern airfoil theory dates from 1905, when the Russian hydro-
dynamicist N. E. Joukowsky (1847–1921) developed a circulation theorem (Chap. 8) 
for computing airfoil lift for arbitrary camber and thickness. With this basic theory, 
as extended and developed by Prandtl and Kármán and their students, it is now pos-
sible to design a low-speed airfoil to satisfy particular surface pressure distributions and 
7For some airfoils the bubble leaps, not creeps, forward, and stall occurs rapidly and dangerously.

boundary layer characteristics. There are whole families of airfoil designs, notably 
those developed in the United States under the sponsorship of the NACA (now 
NASA). Extensive theory and data on these airfoils are contained in Ref. 16. We shall 
discuss this further in Chap. 8. The history of aeronautics is a rich and engaging topic 
and highly recommended to the reader [43, 44].
 
Figure 7.25 shows the lift and drag on a symmetric airfoil denoted as the NACA 
0009 foil, the last digit indicating the thickness of 9 percent. With no fl ap extended, 
this airfoil, as expected, has zero lift at zero angle of attack. Up to about 128 the lift 
coeffi cient increases linearly with a slope of 0.1 per degree, or 6.0 per radian. This 
is in agreement with the theory outlined in Chap. 8:
 
CL,theory < 2π sin aα 1 2h
c b 
(7.67)
where h/c is the maximum camber expressed as a fraction of the chord. The NACA 
0009 has zero camber; hence CL 5 2π sin α < 0.11α, where α is in degrees. This 
is excellent agreement.
 
The drag coeffi cient of the smooth-model airfoils in Fig. 7.25 is as low as 0.005, 
which is actually lower than both sides of a fl at plate in turbulent fl ow. This is mis-
leading inasmuch as a commercial foil will have roughness effects; for example, a 
paint job will double the drag coeffi cient.
 
The effect of increasing Reynolds number in Fig. 7.25 is to increase the maximum 
lift and stall angle (without changing the slope appreciably) and to reduce the drag 
coeffi cient. This is a salutary effect since the prototype will probably be at a higher 
Reynolds number than the model (107 or more).
 
For takeoff and landing, the lift is greatly increased by defl ecting a split fl ap, as 
shown in Fig. 7.25. This makes the airfoil unsymmetric (or effectively cambered)

and changes the zero-lift point to α 5 2128. The drag is also greatly increased by 
the fl ap, but the reduction in takeoff and landing distance is worth the extra power 
needed.
 
A lifting craft cruises at low angle of attack, where the lift is much larger than the 
drag. Maximum lift-to-drag ratios for the common airfoils lie between 20 and 50.
 
Some airfoils, such as the NACA 6 series, are shaped to provide favorable gradients 
over much of the upper surface at low angles. Thus separation is small, and transition 
to turbulence is delayed; the airfoil retains a good length of laminar fl ow even at high 
Reynolds numbers. The lift-drag polar plot in Fig. 7.26 shows the NACA 0009 data 
from Fig. 7.25 and a laminar fl ow airfoil, NACA 63-009, of the same thickness. The 
laminar fl ow airfoil has a low-drag bucket at small angles but also suffers lower stall 
angle and lower maximum lift coeffi cient. The drag is 30 percent less in the bucket, 
but the bucket disappears if there is signifi cant surface roughness.
 
All the data in Figs. 7.25 and 7.26 are for infi nite span—that is, a two-dimensional 
fl ow pattern about wings without tips. The effect of fi nite span can be correlated with 
the dimensionless slenderness, or aspect ratio, denoted (AR):

(7.68)
where c is the average chord length. Finite-span effects are shown in Fig. 7.27. 
The lift slope decreases, but the zero-lift angle is the same; and the drag increases, 
but the zero-lift drag is the same. The theory of fi nite-span airfoils [16] predicts 
that the effective angle of attack increases, as in Fig. 7.27, by the amount

speed, or stall speed, for a craft whose lift supports its weight:

The stall speed of typical aircraft varies between 60 and 200 ft/s, depending on the 
weight and value of CL,max. The pilot must hold the speed greater than about 1.2Vs to 
avoid the instability associated with complete stall.
 
The split fl ap in Fig. 7.25 is only one of many devices used to secure high lift 
at low speeds. Figure 7.28a shows six such devices whose lift performance is given 
in Fig. 7.28b along with a standard (A) and laminar fl ow (B) airfoil. The double-
slotted fl ap achieves CL,max < 3.4, and a combination of this plus a leading-edge 
slat can achieve CL,max < 4.0. These are not scientifi c curiosities; for instance, the 
Boeing 727 commercial jet aircraft uses a triple-slotted fl ap plus a leading-edge slat 
during landing.
 
A violation of conventional aerodynamic wisdom is that military aircraft are begin-
ning to fl y, briefl y, above the stall point. Fighter pilots are learning to make quick

tinuously while stalled—the Grumman X-29 experimental aircraft recently set a record 
by fl ying at α 5 678.
The Kline-Fogelman Airfoil
 
Traditionally, an airfoil is a thin teardrop shape, with a rounded leading edge and a 
sharp trailing edge, Fig. 7.28a. It provides low drag but stalls at low α < 10 to 158. 
In 1972 R. F. Kline and F. F. Fogelman designed an airfoil with a sharp leading edge 
and a rear cut-out [17]. When tested in a wind tunnel, Fig. 7.28b, it did not stall until 
α < 458, but the drag was very high. Fertis [55] rounded the leading edge and reduced 
the drag. Finaish and Witherspoon [56] made further improvements, but the drag is 
still too high for full-scale commercial applications. The KF airfoil, though, is extremely 
popular for radio-controlled model aircraft.
A Wing Inspired by the 
Humpback Whale
 
Biologists have long noticed the high maneuverability of the humpback whale when 
it seeks prey. Unlike most whales, the humpback has tubercles, or bumps, on the 
leading edge of its fl ippers. Miklosovic et al. [57] tested this idea, using a standard 
wing with periodic bumps glued to its leading edge, as in Fig. 7.29. They report a 
40 percent increase in stall angle, compared to the same wing without bumps, plus 
higher lift and higher lift-to-drag ratios. The concept has promise for commercial 
applications such as wind turbine blades. Flow visualization shows that the bumps 
create energetic streamwise vortices along the wing surface, helping to delay 
separation.

Engineers have long dreamed of a viable car that can fl y. Hop in at home, drive to 
the airport, fl y somewhere, then drive to the motel. Designer efforts date back to the 
Glenn Curtiss 1917 Autoplane, with other projects in the 1930s and 1940s. Perhaps 
the most famous was Moulton Taylor’s Aerocar in 1947. Only fi ve Aerocars were 
built. The year 2008 seems to have been the Year of the Car-Plane, with at least fi ve 
different companies working on designs. Engineers can now use lightweight materials, 
better engines, and guidance systems. The writer’s favorite is the Transition®, made 
by Terrafugia, Inc., shown in Fig. 7.30.
 
The Transition® has wings that fold out to a span of 27.5 ft. The twin tails do not 
fold. The front canard wing doubles as a bumper for the highway. The 100-hp engine 
drives both the rear propeller for fl ight and also the front wheels for the highway. 
Gross takeoff weight is 1430 lbf. Operators need only a Light Sport Airplane license. 
The Transition® made a successful maiden fl ight on Mar. 5, 2009. This craft’s data 
will clearly be useful for setting end-of-chapter problems.

Summary
 
This chapter has dealt with viscous effects in external fl ow past bodies immersed in 
a stream. When the Reynolds number is large, viscous forces are confi ned to a thin 
boundary layer and wake in the vicinity of the body. Flow outside these “shear lay-
ers” is essentially inviscid and can be predicted by potential theory and Bernoulli’s 
equation.
 
The chapter began with a discussion of the fl at-plate boundary layer and the use 
of momentum integral estimates to predict the wall shear, friction drag, and thickness 
of such layers. These approximations suggest how to eliminate certain small terms 
in the Navier-Stokes equations, resulting in Prandtl’s boundary layer equations for 
laminar and turbulent fl ow. Section 7.4 then solved the boundary layer equations 
to  give very accurate formulas for fl at-plate fl ow at high Reynolds numbers. 
 Rough-wall effects were included, and Sec. 7.5 gave a brief introduction to pressure 
gradient effects. An adverse (decelerating) gradient was seen to cause fl ow separa-
tion, where the boundary layer breaks away from the surface and forms a broad, low-
pressure wake.
 
Boundary layer theory fails in separated fl ows, which are commonly studied by 
experiment or CFD. Section 7.6 gave data on drag coeffi cients of various two- and 
three-dimensional body shapes. The chapter ended with a brief discussion of lift forces 
generated by lifting bodies such as airfoils and hydrofoils. Airfoils also suffer fl ow 
separation or stall at high angles of incidence.

P7.1 
An ideal gas, at 208C and 1 atm, fl ows at 12 m/s past a thin 
fl at plate. At a position 60 cm downstream of the leading 
edge, the boundary layer thickness is 5 mm. Which of the 
13 gases in Table A.4 is this likely to be?
P7.2 
A gas at 208C and 1 atm fl ows at 6 ft/s past a thin fl at plate. 
At x 5 3 ft, the boundary layer thickness is 0.052 ft. 
 Assuming laminar fl ow, which of the gases in Table A.4 is 
this likely to be?
P7.3 
Equation (7.1b) assumes that the boundary layer on the 
plate is turbulent from the leading edge onward. Devise 
a scheme for determining the boundary layer thickness 
more accurately when the fl ow is laminar up to a point 
Rex,crit and turbulent thereafter. Apply this scheme to 
computation of the boundary layer thickness at x 5 1.5 m 
in 40 m/s fl ow of air at 208C and 1 atm past a fl at plate. 
Compare your result with Eq. (7.1b). Assume Rex,crit < 
1.2 E6.

A smooth ceramic sphere (SG 5 2.6) is immersed in a fl ow 
of water at 208C and 25 cm/s. What is the sphere diameter 
if it is encountering (a) creeping motion, Red 5 1 or (b) 
transition to turbulence, Red 5 250,000?
P7.5 
SAE 30 oil at 208C fl ows at 1.8 ft3/s from a reservoir into a

Does this profi le satisfy the conditions of laminar fl at-plate

P7.11 Air at 208C and 1 atm fl ows at 2 m/s past a sharp fl at plate. 
Assuming that Kármán’s parabolic-profi le analysis, Eqs. 
(7.6–7.10), is accurate, estimate (a) the local velocity u and (b) 
the local shear stress τ at the position (x, y) 5 (50 cm, 5 mm).

Problems 503
P7.12 The velocity profi le shape u/U ≈ 1 2 exp (−4.605y/δ) is a 
smooth curve with u 5 0 at y 5 0 and u 5 0.99U at y 5 δ 
and thus would seem to be a reasonable substitute for the 
parabolic fl at-plate profi le of Eq. (7.3). Yet when this new 
profi le is used in the integral analysis of Sec. 7.3, we get the 
lousy result δ/x < 9.2/Rex
1/2, which is 80 percent high. 
What is the reason for the inaccuracy? [Hint: The answer 
lies in evaluating the laminar boundary layer momentum 
equation (7.19b) at the wall, y 5 0.]

equations (7.19) for the case of axisymmetric fl ow along

Find the value of the constant C in terms of the fl ow param-
eters. Are the boundary conditions satisfi ed? What might 
this fl ow represent?
P7.15 Discuss whether fully developed laminar incompressible 
fl ow between parallel plates, Eq. (4.134) and Fig. 4.14b, 
represents an exact solution to the boundary layer equa-
tions (7.19) and the boundary conditions (7.20). In what 
sense, if any, are duct fl ows also boundary layer fl ows?
Laminar fl at-plate fl ow
P7.16 A thin fl at plate 55 by 110 cm is immersed in a 6-m/s stream 
of SAE 10 oil at 208C. Compute the total friction drag if the 
stream is parallel to (a) the long side and (b) the short side.
P7.17 Consider laminar fl ow past a sharp fl at plate of width b and 
length L. What percentage of the friction drag on the plate 
is carried by the rear half of the plate?
P7.18 Air at 208C and 1 atm fl ows at 5 m/s past a fl at plate. At x 5 
60 cm and y 5 2.95 mm, use the Blasius solution, Table 
7.1, to fi nd (a) the velocity u; and (b) the wall shear stress. 
(c) For extra credit, fi nd a Blasius formula for the shear 
stress away from the wall.
P7.19 Air at 208C and 1 atm fl ows at 50 ft/s past a thin fl at plate 
whose area (bL) is 24 ft2. If the total friction drag is 0.3 lbf, 
what are the length and width of the plate?
P7.20 Air at 208C and 1 atm fl ows at 20 m/s past the fl at plate 
in Fig. P7.20. A pitot stagnation tube, placed 2 mm from 
the wall, develops a manometer head h 5 16 mm of Me-
riam red oil, SG 5 0.827. Use this information to esti-
mate the downstream position x of the pitot tube. Assume

(c) the wall shear stress, and (d ) the total friction drag 
 between the leading edge and the position of the pitot tube.

Values of f are not given in Table 7.1, but one published 
value is f(2.0) 5 0.6500. Consider airfl ow at 6 m/s, 208C, 
and 1 atm past a fl at plate. At x 5 1 m, estimate (a) the height

Turbulent fl at-plate fl ow
P7.30 In Ref. 56 of Chap. 6, McKeon et al. propose new, more 
accurate values for the turbulent log-law constants, κ 5 
0.421 and B 5 5.62. Use these constants, and the one- 
seventh power-law, to repeat the analysis that led to the 
formula for turbulent boundary layer thickness, Eq. (7.42). 
By what percent is δ/x in your new formula different from 
that in Eq. (7.42)? Comment.

the air is standard sea-level conditions. What will the wind

Its wing is an NACA 0009 airfoil, with a chord length

P7.43 In the fl ow of air at 208C and 1 atm past a fl at plate in

a fl oating element (a small area connected to a strain-gage 
force measurement). At x 5 2 m, the element indicates a 
shear stress of 2.1 Pa. Assuming turbulent fl ow from the lead-

layer thickness δ at the element, and (c) the boundary layer 
velocity u, in m/s, at 5 mm above the element.

Thus, if y and u(y) are known at a point in a fl at-plate

P7.47 Local boundary layer effects, such as shear stress and heat 
transfer, are best correlated with local variables, rather using 
distance x from the leading edge. The momentum thickness 
θ is often used as a length scale. Use the analysis of turbulent 
fl at-plate fl ow to write local wall shear stress τw in terms of 
dimensionless θ and compare with the formula recom-

P7.85 In this era of expensive fossil fuels, many alternatives 
have been pursued. One idea from SkySails, Inc., shown 
in Fig. P7.85, is the assisted propulsion of a ship by a large 
tethered kite. The tow force of the kite  assists the ship’s 
propeller and is said to reduce annual fuel consumption 
by 10–35 percent. For a typical  example, let the ship be 
120 m long, with a wetted area of 2800 m2. The kite area 
is 330 m2 and has a force coeffi cient of 0.8. The kite cable 
makes an angle of 258 with the horizontal. Let Vwind 5

Pode in 1951 (Fig. P7.103). Assume that the cylinder has 
normal drag coeffi cient CDN and tangential coeffi cient CDT 
that relate the drag forces to VN and VT, respectively.  Derive 
an expression for Pode’s angle as a function of the fl ow and 
rod parameters. Find θ for a steel rod, L 5 40 cm, D 5 1 cm, 
hanging in sea-level air at V 5 35 m/s.

a maximum diameter of 23 m. Its propulsor can deliver 
up to 80,000 hp to the seawater. Model the submarine as 
an 8:1 ellipsoid and estimate the maximum speed, in knots, 
of this ship.
P7.105 A ship 50 m long, with a wetted area of 800 m2, has the hull 
shape tested in Fig. 7.19. There are no bow or stern bulbs. 
The total propulsive power available is 1 MW. For sea-
water at 208C, plot the ship’s velocity V kn versus power P 
for 0 , P , 1 MW. What is the most effi cient setting?
P7.106 For the kite-assisted ship of Prob. P7.85, again neglect 
wave drag and let the wind velocity be 30 mi/h. Estimate

P7.107 The largest fl ag in Rhode Island stands outside Herb Cham-
bers’ auto dealership, on the edge of Route I-95 in Provi-
dence. The fl ag is 50 ft long, 30 ft wide, weighs 250 lbf, 
and takes four strong people to raise it or lower it. Using 
Prob. P7.40 for input, estimate (a) the wind speed, in mi/h, 
for which the fl ag drag is 1000 lbf and (b) the fl ag drag 
when the wind is a low-end category 1 hurricane, 74 mi/h.

P7.108 The data in Fig. P7.108 are for the lift and drag of a 
 spinning sphere from Ref. 45. Suppose that a tennis ball 
(W < 0.56 N, D < 6.35 cm) is struck at sea level with 
 initial  velocity V0 5 30 m/s and “topspin” (front of the ball 
rotating downward) of 120 r/s. If the initial height of the 
ball is 1.5 m, estimate the horizontal distance traveled 
 before it strikes the ground.

P7.109 The world record for automobile mileage, 12,665 miles per 
gallon, was set in 2005 by the PAC-CAR II in Fig. P7.109, 
built by students at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technol-
ogy in Zurich [52]. This little car, with an empty weight of 
64 lbf and a height of only 2.5 ft, traveled a 21-km course 
at 30 km/h to set the record. It has a reported drag  coeffi cient 
of 0.075 (comparable to an airfoil), based upon a frontal 
area of 3 ft2. (a) What is the drag of this little car when 
on the course? (b) What horsepower is required to pro-
pel it? (c) Do a bit of research and explain why a value 
of miles per gallon is completely misleading in this par-
ticular case.
P7.110 A baseball pitcher throws a curveball with an initial ve-
locity of 65 mi/h and a spin of 6500 r/min about a verti-
cal axis. A baseball weighs 0.32 lbf and has a diameter 
of 2.9 in. Using the data of Fig. P7.108 for turbulent 
fl ow, estimate how far such a curveball will have devi-
ated from its straight-line path when it reaches home 
plate 60.5 ft away.
 
*P7.111 A table tennis ball has a mass of 2.6 g and a diameter of 
3.81 cm. It is struck horizontally at an initial velocity of 
20 m/s while it is 50 cm above the table, as in Fig. P7.111. 
For sea-level air, what spin, in r/min, will cause the ball to 
strike the opposite edge of the table, 4 m away? Make an 
analytical estimate, using Fig. P7.108, and account for the 
fact that the ball decelerates during fl ight.
P7.112 A smooth wooden sphere (SG 5 0.65) is connected by a 
thin rigid rod to a hinge in a wind tunnel, as in Fig. P7.112.

P7.113 An automobile has a mass of 1000 kg and a drag area 
CDA 5 0.7 m2. The rolling resistance of 70 N is approxi-
mately constant. The car is coasting without brakes at 90 
km/h as it begins to climb a hill of 10 percent grade 
(slope 5 tan21 0.1 5 5.718). How far up the hill will the 
car come to a stop?
P7.114 The deep submergence vehicle ALVIN is 23 ft long and 
8.5 ft wide. It weighs about 36,000 lbf in air and ascends 
(descends) in the seawater due to about 360 lbf of positive 
(negative) buoyancy. Noting that the front face of the ship is 
quite different for ascent and descent, (a) estimate the ve-
locity for each direction, in meters per minute. (b) How long 
does it take to ascend from its maximum depth of 4500 m?
Lifting bodies—airfoils
P7.115 The Cessna Citation executive jet weighs 67 kN and has a 
wing area of 32 m2. It cruises at 10 km standard altitude 
with a lift coeffi cient of 0.21 and a drag coeffi cient of 
0.015. Estimate (a) the cruise speed in mi/h and (b) the 
horsepower required to maintain cruise velocity.
P7.116 An airplane weighs 180 kN and has a wing area of 160 m2 
and a mean chord of 4 m. The airfoil properties are given 
by Fig. 7.25. If the plane is designed to land at V0 5 
1.2Vstall, using a split fl ap set at 608, (a) what is the proper 
landing speed in mi/h? (b) What power is required for take-
off at the same speed?
P7.117 The Transition® auto-car in Fig. 7.30 has a weight of 1200 
lbf, a wingspan of 27.5 ft, and a wing area of 150 ft2, with 
a symmetrical airfoil, CDq < 0.02. Assume that the fuse-
lage and tail section have a drag-area comparable to the 
Toyota Prius [21], CDA < 6.24 t2. If the pusher propeller 
provides a thrust of 250 lbf, how fast, in mi/h, can this car-
plane fl y at an altitude of 8200 ft?
 
*P7.118 Suppose that the airplane of Prob. P7.116 is fi tted with all 
the best high-lift devices of Fig. 7.28. What is its minimum 
stall speed in mi/h? Estimate the stopping distance if the 
plane lands at V0 5 1.25Vstall with constant CL 5 3.0 and 
CD 5 0.2 and the braking force is 20 percent of the weight 
on the wheels.
P7.119 A transport plane has a mass of 45,000 kg, a wing area of 
160 m2, and an aspect ratio of 7. Assume all lift and drag due 
to the wing alone, with CD∞ 5 0.020 and CL,max 5 1.5. If the 
aircraft fl ies at 9000 m standard altitude, make a plot of drag 
(in N) versus speed (from stall to 240 m/s) and determine the 
optimum cruise velocity (minimum drag per unit speed).
P7.120 Show that if Eqs. (7.70) and (7.71) are valid, the maxi-
mum lift-to-drag ratio occurs when CD 5 2CD∞. What 
are (L/D)max and α for a symmetric wing when AR 5 5 
and CD∞ 5 0.009?
P7.121 In gliding (unpowered) fl ight, the lift and drag are in equi-
librium with the weight. Show that if there is no wind, the 
aircraft sinks at an angle

For a sailplane of mass 200 kg, wing area 12 m2, and aspect 
ratio 11, with an NACA 0009 airfoil, estimate (a) the stall 
speed, (b) the minimum gliding angle, and (c) the maxi-
mum distance it can glide in still air when it is 1200 m 
above level ground.
P7.122 A boat of mass 2500 kg has two hydrofoils, each of chord 
30 cm and span 1.5 m, with CL,max 5 1.2 and CD∞ 5 0.08. 
Its engine can deliver 130 kW to the water. For seawater at 
208C, estimate (a) the minimum speed for which the foils 
support the boat and (b) the maximum speed attainable.
P7.123 In prewar days there was a controversy, perhaps apocry-
phal, about whether the bumblebee has a legitimate aero-
dynamic right to fl y. The average bumblebee (Bombus 
terrestris) weighs 0.88 g, with a wingspan of 1.73 cm and 
a wing area of 1.26 cm2. It can indeed fl y at 10 m/s. Using 
fi xed-wing theory, what is the lift coeffi cient of the bee at 
this speed? Is this reasonable for typical airfoils?
 *P7.124 The bumblebee can hover at zero speed by fl apping its wings. 
Using the data of Prob. P7.123, devise a theory for fl apping 
wings where the downstroke approximates a short fl at plate 
normal to the fl ow (Table 7.3) and the upstroke is feathered at 
nearly zero drag. How many fl aps per second of such a model 
wing are needed to support the bee’s weight? (Actual mea-
surements of bees show a fl apping rate of 194 Hz.)

 
*P7.125 The Solar Impulse aircraft in the chapter-opener photo has 
a wingspan of 208 ft, a wing area of 2140 ft2, and a weight 
of 1600 kgf. Its propellers deliver an average of 24 hp to 
the air at a cruising altitude of 8.5 km. Assuming an NACA 
0009 airfoil, and neglecting the drag of the fuselage and 
tail, estimate (a) the wing aspect ratio, (b) the cruise speed, 
in mi/h, and (c) the wing angle of attack. [Hint: Simplify by 
using Fig. 7.25 to estimate lift and drag.]
P7.126 Using the data for the Transition® auto-car from Prob. 
P7.117, and a maximum lift coeffi cient of 1.3, estimate 
the distance for the vehicle to take off at a speed of 
1.2Vstall. Note that we have to add the car-body drag to 
the wing drag.
P7.127 The so-called Rocket Man, Yves Rossy, fl ew across the Alps in 
2008, wearing a rocket-propelled wing-suit with the following 
data: thrust 5 200 lbf, altitude 5 8,200 ft, and wingspan 5 8 ft 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Rossy). Further assume a 
wing area of 12 ft2, total weight of 280 lbf, CDq 5 0.08 for the 
wing, and a drag area of 1.7 ft2 for Rocket Man. Estimate the 
 maximum velocity possible for this condition, in mi/h.

A new pizza store is planning to open. It will, of course, 
 offer free delivery, and therefore need a small delivery car 
with a large sign attached. The sign (a fl at plate) is 1.5 ft high 
and 5 ft long. The boss (having no feel for fl uid mechanics) 
mounts the sign bluntly facing the wind. One of his drivers 
is taking fl uid mechanics and tells his boss he can save lots 
of money by mounting the sign parallel to the wind. (See 
Fig. C7.3.) (a) Calculate the drag (in lbf) on the sign alone at 
40 mi/h (58.7 ft/s) in both orientations. (b) Suppose the car 
without any sign has a drag coeffi cient of 0.4 and a frontal

Design Project
D7.1 
It is desired to design a cup anemometer for wind speed, 
similar to Fig. P7.91, with a more sophisticated approach 
than the “average-torque” method of Prob. P7.91. The 
 design should achieve an approximately linear relation 
 between wind velocity and rotation rate in the range 20 , U 
, 40 mi/h, and the anemometer should rotate at about 6 r/s at 
U 5 30 mi/h. All specifi cations—cup diameter D, rod length L, 
rod diameter d, the bearing type, and all  materials—are 
to be selected through your analysis. Make suitable as-
sumptions about the instantaneous drag of the cups and 
rods at any given angle θ(t) of the system. Compute the 
instantaneous torque T(t), and fi nd and integrate the instan-
taneous angular acceleration of the device. Develop a com-
plete theory for rotation rate versus wind speed in the range 
0 , U , 50 mi/h. Try to include actual commercial bear-
ing friction properties.

Until they reach shallow water and feel the bottom, ocean waves are almost frictionless. Waves 
are created by winds, especially storms. Long waves—large distances between crests—travel 
the fastest and decay the slowest. Short waves decay more quickly but are still nearly friction-
less. The pictured long waves, breaking on the beach in Narragansett, Rhode Island, might have 
been formed from a storm off the coast of Africa. The theory of ocean waves [21] is based 
almost entirely upon frictionless fl ow. (Photo courtesy of Ellen Emerson White.)

Motivation. The basic partial differential equations of mass, momentum, and energy 
were discussed in Chap. 4. A few solutions were then given for incompressible viscous 
fl ow in Sec. 4.10. The viscous solutions were limited to simple geometries and uni-
directional fl ows, where the diffi cult nonlinear convective terms were neglected. Potential 
fl ows are not limited by such nonlinear terms. Then, in Chap. 7, we found an approxi-
mation: patching boundary layer fl ows onto an outer inviscid fl ow pattern. For more 
complicated viscous fl ows, we found no theory or solutions, just experimental data or 
computer solutions.
 
The purposes of the present chapter are (1) to explore examples of potential theory 
and (2) to indicate some fl ows that can be approximated by computational fl uid 
dynamics (CFD). The combination of these two gives us a good picture of incom-
pressible-fl ow theory and its relation to experiment. One of the most important appli-
cations of potential-fl ow theory is to aerodynamics and marine hydrodynamics. First, 
however, we will review and extend the concepts of Chap. 4.
8.1 Introduction and Review 
Figure 8.1 reminds us of the problems to be faced. A free stream approaches two 
closely spaced bodies, creating an “internal” fl ow between them and “external” fl ows 
above and below them. The fronts of the bodies are regions of favorable gradient 
(decreasing pressure along the surface), and the boundary layers will be attached and 
thin: Inviscid theory will give excellent results for the outer fl ow if Re . 104. For 
the internal fl ow between bodies, the boundary layers will grow and eventually meet, 
and the inviscid core vanishes. Inviscid theory works well in a “short” duct L/D , 10, 
such as the nozzle of a wind tunnel. For longer ducts we must estimate boundary 
layer growth and be cautious about using inviscid theory.

theory in this chapter does not apply 
to the boundary layer regions.
 
For the external fl ows above and below the bodies in Fig. 8.1, inviscid theory 
should work well for the outer fl ows, until the surface pressure gradient becomes 
adverse (increasing pressure) and the boundary layer separates or stalls. After the 
separation point, boundary layer theory becomes inaccurate, and the outer fl ow 
streamlines are defl ected and have a strong interaction with the viscous near-wall 
regions. The theoretical analysis of separated-fl ow regions is an active research area 
at present.
Review of Velocity Potential 
Concepts
 
Recall from Sec. 4.9 that if viscous effects are neglected, low-speed fl ows are irrota-
tional, = 3 V 5 0, and the velocity potential ϕ exists, such that
V 5 =ϕ    or    u 5 0ϕ
0x    υ 5 0ϕ
0y    w 5 0ϕ
0z  
(8.1)
The continuity equation (4.73), = ? V 5 0, reduces to Laplace’s equation for ϕ:
§2ϕ 5 02ϕ
0x2 1 02ϕ
0y2 1 02ϕ
0z2 5 0  
(8.2)
and the momentum equation (4.74) reduces to Bernoulli’s equation:
0ϕ
0t 1 p
ρ 1 1
2 V 2 1 gz 5 const  where V 5 0=ϕ 0  
(8.3)
Typical boundary conditions are known free-stream conditions
Outer boundaries: 
Known 0ϕ
0x , 0ϕ
0y , 0ϕ
0z  
(8.4)
and no velocity normal to the boundary at the body surface:
Solid surfaces: 
0ϕ
0n 5 0    where n is perpendicular to body 
(8.5)

8.1  Introduction and Review 523
Unlike the no-slip condition in viscous fl ow, here there is no condition on the tangential 
surface velocity Vs 5 ≠ϕ/≠s, where s is the coordinate along the surface. This velocity 
is determined as part of the solution to the problem.
 
Occasionally the problem involves a free surface, for which the boundary pressure 
is known and equal to pa, usually a constant. The Bernoulli equation (8.3) then supplies 
a relation at the surface between V and the elevation z of the surface. For steady fl ow,
Free surface: 
V2 5 0=ϕ 02 5 const 2 2gzsurf 
(8.6)
It should be clear to the reader that this use of Laplace’s equation, with known values 
of the derivative of ϕ along the boundaries, is much easier than a direct attack using 
the fully viscous Navier-Stokes equations. The analysis of Laplace’s equation is very 
well developed and is termed potential theory, with whole books written about its 
application to fl uid mechanics [1 to 4]. There are many analytical techniques, includ-
ing superposition of elementary functions, conformal mapping [4], numerical fi nite 
differences [5], numerical fi nite elements [6], numerical boundary elements [7], and 
electric or mechanical analogs [8] that are now outdated. Having found ϕ(x, y, z, t) 
from such an analysis, we then compute V by direct differentiation in Eq. (8.1), after 
which we compute p from Eq. (8.3). The procedure is quite straightforward, and many 
interesting albeit idealized results can be obtained. A beautiful collection of computer-
generated potential fl ow sketches is given by Kirchhoff [43].
Review of Stream Function 
Concepts
 
Recall from Sec. 4.7 that if a fl ow is described by only two coordinates, the stream 
function ψ also exists as an alternate approach. For plane incompressible fl ow in xy 
coordinates, the correct form is
 
u 5 0ψ
0y  υ 5 20ψ
0x  
(8.7)
The condition of irrotationality reduces to Laplace’s equation for ψ also:
2ωz 5 0 5 0υ
0x 2 0u
0y 5 0
0x
  a20ψ
0x b 2 0
0y a 0ψ
0y b
or 
02ψ
0x2 1 02ψ
0y2 5 0  
(8.8)
The boundary conditions again are known velocity in the stream and no fl ow through 
any solid surface:
Free stream: 
Known 0ψ
0x , 0ψ
0y  
(8.9a)
Solid surface: 
ψbody 5 const 
(8.9b)
Equation (8.9b) is particularly interesting because any line of constant ψ in a fl ow can 
therefore be interpreted as a body shape and may lead to interesting applications.
 
For the applications in this chapter, we may compute either ϕ or ψ or both, and 
the solution will be an orthogonal fl ow net as in Fig. 8.2. Once found, either set of 
lines may be considered the ϕ lines, and the other set will be the ψ lines. Both sets 
of lines are laplacian and could be useful.

524 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
Plane Polar Coordinates
 
Many solutions in this chapter are conveniently expressed in polar coordinates (r, θ). 
Both the velocity components and the differential relations for ϕ and ψ are then 
changed, as follows:
 
υr 5 0ϕ
0r 5 1
r 0ψ
0θ    υθ 5 1
r 0ϕ
0θ 5 20ψ
0r  
(8.10)
Laplace’s equation takes the form
 
1
r 0
0r ar 0ϕ
0r b 1 1
r2 02ϕ
0θ2 5 0 
(8.11)
Exactly the same equation holds for the polar-coordinate form of ψ (r, θ).
 
An intriguing facet of potential fl ow with no free surface is that the governing 
equations (8.2) and (8.8) contain no parameters, nor do the boundary conditions. There-
fore, the solutions are purely geometric, depending only on the body shape, the free-
stream orientation, and—surprisingly—the position of the rear stagnation point.1 There 
is no Reynolds, Froude, or Mach number to complicate the dynamic similarity. Inviscid 
fl ows are kinematically similar without additional parameters—recall Fig. 5.6a.
8.2 Elementary Plane 
Flow Solutions
 
The present chapter is a detailed introductory study of inviscid incompressible fl ows, 
especially those that possess both a stream function and a velocity potential. Many 
solutions make use of the superposition principle, so we begin with the three elemen-
tary building blocks illustrated in Fig. 8.3: (a) a uniform stream in the x direction, 
(b) a line source or sink at the origin, and (c) a line vortex at the origin.
Uniform Stream in the x Direction  
A uniform stream V 5 iU, as in Fig. 8.3a, possesses both a stream function and a 
velocity potential, which may be found as follows:
u 5 U 5 0ϕ
0x 5 0ψ
0y    υ 5 0 5 0ϕ
0y 5 20ψ

Fig. 8.2 Streamlines and potential 
lines are orthogonal and may 
reverse roles if results are useful: 
(a) typical inviscid fl ow pattern; 
(b) same as (a) with roles reversed.
1The rear stagnation condition establishes the net amount of “circulation” about the body, giving rise 
to a lift force. Otherwise the solution could not be unique. See Sec. 8.4.

8.2  Elementary Plane Flow Solutions  525
We may integrate each expression and discard the constants of integration, which do 
not affect the velocities in the fl ow. The results are
Uniform stream iU: 
ψ 5 Uy    ϕ 5 Ux 
(8.12)
The streamlines are horizontal straight lines (y 5 const), and the potential lines are 
vertical (x 5 const)—that is, orthogonal to the streamlines, as expected.
Line Source or Sink at the Origin  
Suppose that the z axis were a sort of thin pipe manifold through which fl uid issued 
at total rate Q uniformly along its length b. Looking at the xy plane, we would see a 
cylindrical radial outfl ow or line source, as sketched in Fig. 8.3b. Plane polar coor-
dinates are appropriate (see Fig. 4.2), and there is no circumferential velocity. At any 
radius r, the velocity is
υr 5
Q
2πrb 5 m
r 5 1
r 0ψ
0θ 5 0ϕ
0r    υθ 5 0 5 20ψ
0r 5 1
r 0ϕ
0θ
where we have used the polar coordinate forms of the stream function and the velocity 
potential. Integrating and again discarding the constants of integration, we obtain the 
proper functions for this simple radial fl ow:
Line source or sink: 
ψ 5 mθ    ϕ 5 m ln r 
(8.13)
where m 5 Q/(2πb) is a constant, positive for a source, negative for a sink. As shown 
in Fig. 8.3b, the streamlines are radial spokes (constant θ), and the potential lines are 
circles (constant r).
Line Irrotational Vortex
 
A (two-dimensional) line vortex is a purely circulating steady motion, υθ 5 f(r) only, 
υr 5 0. This satisfi es the continuity equation identically, as may be checked from Eq. 
(4.12b). We may also note that a variety of velocity distributions υθ (r) satisfy the θ 
momentum equation of a viscous fl uid, Eq. (D.6). We may show, as a problem exer-
cise, that only one function υθ (r) is irrotational; that is, curl V 5 0, and υθ 5 K/r, 
where K is a constant. This is sometimes called a free vortex, for which the stream 
function and velocity may be found:
υr 5 0 5 1
r 0ψ
0θ 5 0ϕ
0r    υθ 5 K

526 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
We may again integrate to determine the appropriate functions:
 
ψ 5 2K ln r    ϕ 5 Kθ 
(8.14)
where K is a constant called the strength of the vortex. As shown in Fig. 8.3c, the 
streamlines are circles (constant r), and the potential lines are radial spokes (constant θ). 
Note the similarity between Eqs. (8.13) and (8.14). A free vortex is a sort of reversed 
image of a source. The “bathtub vortex,” formed when water drains through a bottom 
hole in a tank, is a good approximation to the free-vortex pattern.
Superposition: Source Plus an 
Equal Sink
 
Each of the three elementary fl ow patterns in Fig. 8.3 is an incompressible irrotational 
fl ow and therefore satisfi es both plane “potential fl ow” equations =2 ψ 5 0 and 
=2 ϕ 5 0. Since these are linear partial differential equations, any sum of such basic 
solutions is also a solution. Some of these composite solutions are quite interesting 
and useful.
 
For example, consider a source 1m at (x, y) 5 (2a, 0), combined with a sink of 
equal strength 2m, placed at (1a, 0), as in Fig. 8.4. The resulting stream function is 
simply the sum of the two. In cartesian coordinates,
ψ 5 ψsource 1 ψsink 5 m tan21

Similarly, the composite velocity potential is
ϕ 5 ϕsource 1 ϕsink 5 1
2 m ln 3(x 1 a)2 1 y24 2 1
2 m ln 3(x 2 a)2 1 y24
Fig. 8.4 Potential fl ow due to a line 
source plus an equal line sink, from 
Eq. (8.15). Solid lines are 
streamlines; dashed lines are 
potential lines.

8.2  Elementary Plane Flow Solutions  527
By using trigonometric and logarithmic identities, these may be simplifi ed to
Source plus sink: 
 ψ 5 2m tan21 
2ay
x2 1 y2 2 a2
 
ϕ 5 1
2 m ln (x 1 a)2 1 y2
(x 2 a)2 1 y2 
(8.15)
These lines are plotted in Fig. 8.4 and are seen to be two families of orthogonal circles, 
with the streamlines passing through the source and sink and the potential lines encir-
cling them. They are harmonic (laplacian) functions that are exactly analogous in 
electromagnetic theory to the electric current and electric potential patterns of a mag-
net with poles at (6a, 0).
Sink Plus a Vortex at the Origin
 
An interesting fl ow pattern, approximated in nature, occurs by superposition of a sink 
and a vortex, both centered at the origin. The composite stream function and velocity 
potential are
Sink plus vortex: 
ψ 5 mθ 2 K ln r    ϕ 5 m ln r 1 Kθ 
(8.16)
When plotted, these form two orthogonal families of logarithmic spirals, as shown in 
Fig. 8.5. This is a fairly realistic simulation of a tornado (where the sink fl ow moves 
up the z axis into the atmosphere) or a rapidly draining bathtub vortex. At the center 
of a real (viscous) vortex, where Eq. (8.16) predicts infi nite velocity, the actual cir-
culating fl ow is highly rotational and approximates solid-body rotation υθ < Cr.

528 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
Uniform Stream Plus a Source 
at the Origin: The Rankine 
Half-Body
 
If we superimpose a uniform x-directed stream against an isolated source, a half-body 
shape appears. If the source is at the origin, the combined stream function is, in polar 
coordinates,
Uniform stream plus source: 
ψ 5 Ur sin θ 1 mθ 
(8.17)
We can set this equal to various constants and plot the streamlines, as shown in 
Fig.  8.6. A curved, roughly elliptical, half-body shape appears, which separates the 
source fl ow from the stream fl ow. The body shape, which is named after the Scottish 
engineer W. J. M. Rankine (1820–1872), is formed by the particular streamlines 
ψ 5 6πm. The half-width of the body far downstream is πm/U. The upper surface 
may be plotted from the relation
 
r 5 m(π 2 θ)
U sin θ  
(8.18)
It is not a true ellipse. The nose of the body, which is a “stagnation” point where 
V 5 0, stands at (x, y) 5 (2a, 0), where a 5 m/U. The streamline ψ 5 0 also crosses 
this point—recall that streamlines can cross only at a stagnation point.
 
The cartesian velocity components are found by differentiation:
 
u 5 0ψ
0y 5 U 1 m
r  cos θ    υ 5 20ψ
0x 5 m
r  sin θ 
(8.19)
Setting u 5 υ 5 0, we fi nd a single stagnation point at θ 5 1808 and r 5 m/U, or 
(x, y) 5 (2m/U, 0), as stated. The resultant velocity at any point is
 
V2 5 u2 1 υ2 5 U2
 a1 1 a2
r2 1 2a
r  cos θb 
(8.20)
where we have substituted m 5 Ua. If we evaluate the velocities along the upper surface 
ψ 5 πm, we fi nd a maximum value Us,max < 1.26U at θ 5 638. This point is labeled 
in Fig. 8.6 and, by Bernoulli’s equation, is the point of minimum pressure on the body 
surface. After this point, the surface fl ow decelerates, the pressure rises, and the viscous 
layer grows thicker and more susceptible to “fl ow separation,” as we saw in Chap. 7.

EXAMPLE 8.1
The bottom of a river has a 4-m-high bump that approximates a Rankine half-body, as in 
Fig. E8.1. The pressure at point B on the bottom is 130 kPa, and the river velocity is 
2.5 m/s. Use inviscid theory to estimate the water pressure at point A on the bump, which 
is 2 m above point B.
Water at 20°C

Solution
As in all inviscid theories, we ignore the low-velocity boundary layers that form on solid 
surfaces due to the no-slip condition. From Eq. (8.18) and Fig. 8.6, the downstream bump 
half-height equals πa. Therefore, for our case, a 5 (4 m)/π 5 1.27 m. We have to fi nd the spot 
where the bump height is half that much, h 5 2 m 5 πa/2. From Eq. (8.18) we may compute
r 5 hA 5 a(π 2 θ)
sin θ
5 π
2 a    or    θ 5 π
2 5 90°
Thus point A in Fig. E8.1 is directly above the (initially unknown) origin of coordinates 
(labeled O in Fig. E8.1) and is 1.27 m to the right of the nose of the bump. With r 5 πa/2 
and θ 5 π/2 known, we compute the velocity at point A from Eq. (8.20):
VA

(πa/2)2 1

πa/2 cos π
2 d 5 1.405U2
or 
VA < 1.185U 5 1.185(2.5 m/s) 5 2.96 m/s 
For water at 208C, take ρ 5 998 kg/m2 and γ 5 9790 N/m3. Now, since the velocity and 
elevation are known at point A, we are in a position to use Bernoulli’s inviscid, incompress-
ible fl ow equation (4.120) to estimate pA from the known properties at point B (on the same 
streamline):

Ans.
If the approach velocity is uniform, this should be a pretty good approximation, since water 
is relatively inviscid and its boundary layers are thin.

Uniform Stream at an Angle α
 
If the uniform stream is written in plane polar coordinates, it becomes
Uniform stream iU: 
ψ 5 Ur sin θ    ϕ 5 Ur cos θ 
(8.21)
This makes it easier to superimpose, say, a stream and a source or vortex by using 
the same coordinates. If the uniform stream is moving at angle α with respect to the 
x axis—that is,
u 5 U cos α 5 0ψ
0y 5 0ϕ
0x      υ 5 U sin α 5 20ψ
0x 5 0ϕ
0y
then by integration we obtain the correct functions for fl ow at an angle:
 
ψ 5 U(y cos α 2 x sin α)    ϕ 5 U(x cos α 1 y sin α) 
(8.22)
These expressions are useful in airfoil angle-of-attack problems (Sec. 8.7).
Circulation
 
The line vortex fl ow is irrotational everywhere except at the origin, where the vorticity 
= 3 V is infi nite. This means that a certain line integral called the fl uid circulation 
Γ does not vanish when taken around a vortex center.
 
With reference to Fig. 8.7, the circulation is defi ned as the counterclockwise line 
integral, around a closed curve C, of arc length ds times the velocity component 
tangent to the curve:
 
Γ 5
CC
 V cos α ds 5 #
C
V # ds 5 #
C
 (u dx 1 υ dy 1 w dz) 
(8.23)
From the defi nition of ϕ, V ? ds 5 =ϕ ? ds 5 dϕ for an irrotational fl ow; hence 
normally Γ in an irrotational fl ow would equal the fi nal value of ϕ minus the initial 
value of ϕ. Since we start and end at the same point, we compute Γ 5 0, but not for 
vortex fl ow: With ϕ 5 Kθ from Eq. (8.14) there is a change in ϕ of amount 2πK as 
we make one complete circle:

8.3  Superposition of Plane Flow Solutions  531

around the vortex center, from Eq. (8.23):
Γ 5 #
C

In general, Γ denotes the net algebraic strength of all the vortex fi laments contained 
within the closed curve. In the next section we shall see that a region of fi nite circula-
tion within a fl owing stream will be subjected to a lift force proportional to both 
U∞ and Γ.
 
One can show, by using Eq. (8.23), that a source or sink creates no circulation. If 
there are no vortices present, the circulation will be zero for any path enclosing any 
number of sources and sinks.
8.3 Superposition of Plane 
Flow Solutions
 
We can now form a variety of interesting potential fl ows by summing the velocity 
potential and stream functions of a uniform stream, source or sink, and vortex. Most 
of the results are classic, of course, needing only a brief treatment here. Superposition 
is valid because the basic equations, (8.2) and (8.8), are linear.
Graphical Method of 
Superposition
 
A simple means of accomplishing ψtot 5 © ψi graphically is to plot the individual stream 
functions separately and then look at their intersections. The value of ψtot at each inter-
section is the sum of the individual values ψi that cross there. Connecting intersections 
with the same value of ψtot creates the desired superimposed fl ow streamlines.
 
A simple example is shown in Fig. 8.8, summing two families of streamlines ψa 
and ψb. The individual components are plotted separately, and four typical intersec-
tions are shown. Dashed lines are then drawn through intersections representing the 
same sum of ψa 1 ψb. These dashed lines are the desired solution. Often this graphi-
cal method is a quick means of evaluating the proposed superposition before a full-
blown numerical plot routine is executed.

Boundary Layer Separation 
on a Half-Body
 
Although the inviscid fl ow patterns seen in Figs. 8.9a and c are mirror images, their 
viscous (boundary layer) behavior is different. The body shape and the velocity along 
the surface are
 
V 2 5 U 2
∞ a1 1 a2
r2 1 2a
r  cos θb    along    r 5 m(π 2 θ)
U∞ sin θ  
(8.25)
The computed surface velocities are plotted along the half-body contours in Fig. 8.9b 
and d as a function of arc length s/a measured from the stagnation point. These plots 
are also mirror images. However, if the nose is in front, Fig. 8.9b, the pressure gradi-
ent there is favorable (decreasing pressure along the surface). In contrast, the pressure 
gradient is adverse (increasing pressure along the surface) when the nose is in the 
rear, Fig. 8.9d, and boundary layer separation may occur.
 
Application to Fig. 8.9b of Thwaites’s laminar boundary method from Eqs. (7.54) 
and (7.56) reveals that separation does not occur on the front nose of the half-body. 
Therefore, Fig. 8.9a is a very realistic picture of streamlines past a half-body nose. 
In contrast, when applied to the tail, Fig. 8.9c, Thwaites’s method predicts  separation 
at about s/a < 22.2, or θ < 1108. Thus, if a half-body is a solid surface, Fig. 8.9c 
is not realistic and a broad separated wake will form. However, if the half-body 
tail is a fl uid line separating the sink-directed fl ow from the outer stream, as in 
Example 8.2, then Fig. 8.9c is quite realistic and useful. Computations for turbulent 
boundary layer theory would be similar: separation on the tail, no separation on 
the nose.

By setting υr 5 υθ 5 0 from (8.27) we fi nd a stagnation point at θ 5 908, 
r 5 a 5 K/U∞, or (x, y) 5 (0, a). This is where the counterclockwise vortex velocity 
K/r exactly cancels the stream velocity U∞.
 
Probably the most interesting thing about this example is that there is a nonzero 
lift force normal to the stream on the surface of any region enclosing the vortex, but 
we postpone this discussion until the next section.
An Infi nite Row of Vortices
 
Consider an infi nite row of vortices of equal strength K and equal spacing a, as in 
Fig. 8.11a. This case is included here to illustrate the interesting concept of a vortex 
sheet.
 
From Eq. (8.14), the ith vortex in Fig. 8.11a has a stream function ψi 5 2K ln ri, 
so that the total infi nite row has a combined stream function

It can be shown [2, Sec. 4.51] that this infi nite sum of logarithms is equivalent to a 
closed-form function:
 
ψ 521

2 acosh 2πy

2 cos 2πx
a b d  
(8.28)
Since the proof uses the complex variable z 5 x 1 iy, i 5 (21)1/2, we are not going 
to show the details here.
 
The streamlines from Eq. (8.28) are plotted in Fig. 8.11b, showing what is called 
a cat’s-eye pattern of enclosed fl ow cells surrounding the individual vortices. Above 
the cat’s eyes the fl ow is entirely to the left, and below the cat’s eyes the fl ow is to 
the right. Moreover, these left and right fl ows are uniform if |y| @ a, which follows 
by differentiating Eq. (8.28):
 
u 5 0ψ
0y  `
ƒ yƒ @a
5 6πK
a  
where the plus sign applies below the row and the minus sign above the row. This 
uniform left and right streaming is sketched in Fig. 8.11c. We stress that this effect 
is induced by the row of vortices: There is no uniform stream approaching the row 
in this example.
The Vortex Sheet
 
When Fig. 8.11b is viewed from afar, the streaming motion is uniform left above and 
uniform right below, as in Fig. 8.11c, and the vortices are packed so closely together 
that they are smudged into a continuous vortex sheet. The strength of the sheet is 
defi ned as
 
γ 5 2πK
a  
(8.29)
and in the general case γ can vary with x. The circulation about any closed curve that 
encloses a short length dx of the sheet would be, from Eqs. (8.23) and (8.29),
 
dΓ 5 ul dx 2 uu dx 5 (ul 2 uu) dx 5 2πK
a  dx 5 γ dx 
(8.30)
where the subscripts l and u stand for lower and upper, respectively. Thus the sheet 
strength γ 5 dΓ/dx is the circulation per unit length of the sheet. Thus when a vortex 
sheet is immersed in a uniform stream, γ is proportional to the lift per unit length of 
any surface enclosing the sheet.
 
Note that there is no velocity normal to the sheet at the sheet surface. Therefore a 
vortex sheet can simulate a thin-body shape, like a plate or thin airfoil. This is the 
basis of the thin airfoil theory mentioned in Sec. 8.7.
The Doublet
 
As we move far away from the source–sink pair of Fig. 8.4, the fl ow pattern begins 
to resemble a family of circles tangent to the origin, as in Fig. 8.12. This limit of 
vanishingly small distance a is called a doublet. To keep the fl ow strength large 
enough to exhibit decent velocities as a becomes small, we specify that the product 

536 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
2am remain constant. Let us call this constant λ. Then the stream function of a 
doublet is
 
ψ 5  lim

2ay
x2 1 y2 2 a2b 5 2 2amy
x2 1 y2 5 2
λy
x2 1 y2 
(8.31)
We have used the fact that tan21 α < α as α becomes small. The quantity λ is called 
the strength of the doublet.
 
Equation (8.31) can be rearranged to yield
 
x2 1 ay 1 λ
2ψb

5 a λ

so that, as advertised, the streamlines are circles tangent to the origin with centers on 
the y axis. This pattern is sketched in Fig. 8.12.
 
Although the author has in the past laboriously sketched streamlines by hand, 
this is no longer necessary. Figure 8.12 was computer-drawn, using the contour 
feature of the student version of MATLAB [34]. Simply set up a grid of points, 
spell out the stream function, and call for a contour. For Fig. 8.12, the actual 
statements were
[X, Y] 5 meshgrid (21 : .02 : 1);
PSI 5 2Y. / (X. ^2 1 Y. ^2);
contour (X, Y, PSI, 100)
This would produce 100 contour lines of ψ from Eq. (8.31), with λ 5 1 for conve-
nience. The plot would include grid lines, scale markings, and a surrounding box, and 
Fig. 8.12 A doublet, or source–sink 
pair, is the limiting case of Fig. 8.4 
viewed from afar. Streamlines are 
circles tangent to the x axis at the 
origin. This fi gure was prepared 
using the contour feature of 
MATLAB [34, 35].

8.4  Plane Flow Past Closed-Body Shapes  537
the circles might look a bit elliptical. These blemishes can be eliminated with three 
statements of cosmetic improvement:
axis square
grid off
axis off
The fi nal plot, Fig. 8.12, has no markings but the streamlines themselves. MATLAB 
is thus a recommended tool and, in addition, has scores of other uses. All this chap-
ter’s problem assignments that call for “sketch the streamlines/potential lines” can be 
completed using this contour feature. For further details, consult Ref. 34.
 
In a similar manner the velocity potential of a doublet is found by taking the limit 
of Eq. (8.15) as a → 0 and 2am 5 λ:
 
ϕdoublet 5
λx
x2 1 y2 
or 
ax 2 λ
2ϕb

(8.32)
The potential lines are circles tangent to the origin with centers on the x axis. Simply 
turn Fig. 8.12 clockwise 908 to visualize the ϕ lines, which are everywhere normal 
to the streamlines.
 
The doublet functions can also be written in polar coordinates:
 
ψ 5 2λ sin θ
r
    ϕ 5 λ cos θ
r
 
(8.33)
These forms are convenient for the cylinder fl ows of the next section.
8.4 Plane Flow Past 
Closed-Body Shapes
 
A variety of closed-body external fl ows can be constructed by superimposing a uni-
form stream with sources, sinks, and vortices. The body shape will be closed only if 
the net source outfl ow equals the net sink infl ow.
The Rankine Oval
 
A cylindrical shape called a Rankine oval, which is long compared with its height, is 
formed by a source–sink pair aligned parallel to a uniform stream, as in Fig. 8.13a.
 
From Eqs. (8.12) and (8.15) the combined stream function is
 
ψ 5 U∞y 2 m tan21 
2ay
x2 1 y2 2 a2 5 U∞r sin θ 1 m(θ1 2 θ2) 
(8.34)
When streamlines of constant ψ are plotted from Eq. (8.34), an oval body shape 
appears, as in Fig. 8.13b. The half-length L and half-height h of the oval depend on 
the relative strength of source and stream—that is, the ratio m/(U∞a), which equals 
1.0 in Fig. 8.13b. The circulating streamlines inside the oval are uninteresting and not 
usually shown. The oval is the line ψ 5 0.
 
There are stagnation points at the front and rear, x 5 6L, and points of maximum 
velocity and minimum pressure at the shoulders, y 5 6h, of the oval. All these 

538 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
parameters are a function of the basic dimensionless parameter m/(U∞ a), which we 
can determine from Eq. (8.34):
 
h
a 5 cot 
h/a
2m/(U∞a)    L
a 5 a1 1 2m
U∞ab
1/2
 
 
umax
U∞
5 1 1 2m/(U∞a)
1 1 h2/a2  
(8.35)
As we increase m/(U∞a) from zero to large values, the oval shape increases in size 
and thickness from a fl at plate of length 2a to a huge, nearly circular cylinder. This 
is shown in Table 8.1. In the limit as m/(U∞ a) → ∞, L/h → 1.0 and umax/U∞ → 2.0, 
which is equivalent to fl ow past a circular cylinder.
 
All the Rankine ovals except very thin ones have a large adverse pressure gradient 
on their leeward surface. Thus boundary layer separation will occur in the rear with 
a broad wake fl ow, and the inviscid pattern is unrealistic in that region.
Flow Past a Circular Cylinder

from Eq. (8.30)
cylinder, this is equivalent to a uniform stream plus a doublet. We also throw in a 
vortex at the doublet center, which does not change the shape of the cylinder.
 
Thus the stream function for fl ow past a circular cylinder with circulation, centered 
at the origin, is a uniform stream plus a doublet plus a vortex:
ψ 5 U∞r sin θ 2 λ sin θ
r
2 K ln r 1 const 
(8.36)
The doublet strength λ has units of velocity times length squared. For convenience, 
let λ 5 U∞a2, where a is a length, and let the arbitrary constant in Eq. (8.36) equal 
K ln a. Then the stream function becomes
ψ 5 U∞ sin θ ar 2 a2
r b 2 K ln r
a  
(8.37)
 
The streamlines are plotted in Fig. 8.14 for four different values of the dimension-
less vortex strength K/(U∞a). For all cases the line ψ 5 0 corresponds to the circle
r 5 a—that is, the shape of the cylindrical body. As circulation Γ 5 2πK increases, 
the velocity becomes faster and faster below the cylinder and slower and slower above 
it. The velocity components in the fl ow are given by

The Kutta-Joukowski Lift 
Theorem
 
The cylinder fl ows with circulation, Figs. 8.14b to d, develop an inviscid downward 
lift normal to the free stream, called the Magnus-Robins force. This lift is proportional 
to stream velocity and vortex strength. Its discovery, by experiment, has long been 
attributed to the German physicist Gustav Magnus, who observed it in 1853. It is now 
known [40, 45] that the brilliant British engineer Benjamin Robins fi rst reported a lift 
force on a spinning body in 1761. We see from the streamline patterns that the veloc-
ity on top of the cylinder is less, and, thus, from Bernoulli’s equation, the pressure is 
higher. On the bottom, we see tightly packed streamlines, high velocity, and low 
pressure; viscosity is neglected. Inviscid theory predicts this force.
 
The surface velocity is given by Eq. (8.39). From Bernoulli’s equation (8.3), 
neglecting gravity, the surface pressure ps is given by

where ps 2 p∞ is substituted from Eq. (8.41). But the integral of cos θ times any 
power of sin θ over a full cycle 2π is identically zero. Thus we obtain the (perhaps 
surprising) result
 
D(cylinder with circulation) 5 0 
(8.42)
This is a special case of d’Alembert’s paradox, mentioned in Sec. 1.2:
According to inviscid theory, the drag of any body of any shape immersed in a 
uniform stream is identically zero.
D’Alembert published this result in 1752 and pointed out himself that it did not square 
with the facts for real fl uid fl ows. This unfortunate paradox caused everyone to over-
react and reject all inviscid theory until 1904, when Prandtl fi rst pointed out the 
profound effect of the thin viscous boundary layer on the fl ow pattern in the rear, as 
in Fig. 7.2b, for example.
 
The lift force L normal to the stream, taken positive upward, is given by summa-
tion of vertical pressure forces:
L 5 2#
2π
0
 (ps 2 p∞) sin θ ba dθ
Since the integral over 2π of any odd power of sin θ is zero, only the third term in 
the parentheses in Eq. (8.41) contributes to the lift:

or

(8.43)
Notice that the lift seems independent of the radius a of the cylinder. Actually, though, 
as we shall see in Sec. 8.7, the circulation Γ depends on the body size and orientation 
through a physical requirement.
 
Equation (8.43) was generalized by W. M. Kutta in 1902 and independently by 
N. Joukowski in 1906 as follows:
According to inviscid theory, the lift per unit depth of any cylinder of any shape 
immersed in a uniform stream equals ρu∞Γ, where Γ is the total net circulation 
contained within the body shape. The direction of the lift is 908 from the stream 
direction, rotating opposite to the circulation.

542 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
The problem in airfoil analysis, Sec. 8.7, is thus to determine the circulation Γ as a 
function of airfoil shape and orientation.
Lift and Drag of Rotating 
Cylinders2
 
The fl ows in Fig. 8.14 are mathematical: a doublet plus a vortex plus a uniform 
stream. The physical realization could be a rotating cylinder in a free stream. The 
no-slip condition would cause the fl uid in contact with the cylinder to move tangen-
tially at velocity vθ 5 aω, setting up a net circulation ≠. Measurement of forces on 
a spinning cylinder is very diffi cult, and no reliable drag data are known to the author. 
However, Tokumaru and Dimotakis [22] used a clever auxiliary scheme to measure 
lift forces at ReD 5 3800.
 
Figure 8.15 shows lift and drag coeffi cients, based on frontal area (2ab), for a 
rotating cylinder at ReD 5 3800. The drag curve is from CFD calculations [41]. 
Reported CFD drag results, from several different authors, are quite controversial 
because they do not agree, even qualitatively. The writer feels that Ref. 41 gives the 
most reliable results. Note that the experimental CL increases to a value of 15.3 at 
aω/U∞5 10. This contradicts an early theory of Prandtl, in 1926, that the maximum 
possible value of CL would be 4π < 12.6, corresponding to the fl ow conditions in 
Fig. 8.14c. The inviscid theory for lift would be:
 
CL 5
L

2 ρU2
∞(2ba) 5 2πρU∞Kb
ρU2
∞ba
5 2πυθs
U∞
 
(8.44)
where υθs 5 K/a is the peripheral speed of the cylinder.
 
Figure 8.15 shows that the theoretical lift from Eq. (8.44) is much too high, but 
the measured lift is quite respectable, much larger in fact than a typical airfoil of the 
same chord length, as in Fig. 7.25. Thus rotating cylinders have practical possibilities. 
The Flettner rotor ship built in Germany in 1924 employed rotating vertical cylinders 
that developed a thrust due to any winds blowing past the ship. The Flettner design 
did not gain any popularity, but such inventions may be more attractive in this era of 
high energy costs.

EXAMPLE 8.3
The experimental Flettner rotor sailboat at the University of Rhode Island is shown in Fig. E8.3. 
The rotor is 2.5 ft in diameter and 10 ft long and rotates at 220 r/min. It is driven by a small 
lawnmower engine. If the wind is a steady 10 kn and boat relative motion is neglected, what is 
the maximum thrust expected for the rotor? Assume standard air and water density.
Solution
Convert the rotation rate to ω 5 2π(220)/60 5 23.04 rad/s. The wind velocity is 10 kn 5 
16.88 ft/s, so the velocity ratio is

Using Fig. 8.15, we read CD < 0.7 and CL < 2.5. From Table A.6, standard air density in 
BG units is 0.00238 slug/ft3. Then the estimated rotor lift and drag are

Note that water density did not enter into this calculation, which is a force due to air. If aligned 
along the boat’s keel, this thrust will drive the boat through the water at a speed of about 4 kn.

Comment: For the sake of a numerical example, we have done something improper here. 
We have used data for ReD 5 3800 to estimate forces when the rotor ReD < 260,000. Do 
not do this in your real job after you graduate!
The Kelvin Oval 
A family of body shapes taller than they are wide can be formed by letting a uniform 
stream fl ow normal to a vortex pair. If U∞ is to the right, the negative vortex 2K 
is placed at y 5 1a and the counterclockwise vortex 1K placed at y 5 2a, as in 
Fig. 8.16. The combined stream function is
 
ψ 5 U∞y 2 1
2 K ln x2 1 (y 1 a)2
x2 1 (y 2 a)2 
(8.45)
The body shape is the line ψ 5 0, and some of these shapes are shown in Fig. 8.16. 
For K/(U∞ a) . 10 the shape is within 1 percent of a Rankine oval (Fig. 8.13) turned 
908, but for small K/(U∞ a) the waist becomes pinched in, and a fi gure-eight shape 
occurs at 0.5. For K/(U∞ a) , 0.5 the stream blasts right between the vortices and 
isolates two more or less circular body shapes, one surrounding each vortex.
 
A closed body of practically any shape can be constructed by proper superposition 
of sources, sinks, and vortices. See the advanced work in Refs. 1 to 3 for further 
details. A summary of elementary potential fl ows is given in Table 8.2.
Potential Flow Analogs 
For complicated potential fl ow geometries, one can resort to other methods than super-
position of sources, sinks, and vortices. A variety of devices simulate solutions to 
Laplace’s equation.
 
From 1897 to 1900 Hele-Shaw [9] developed a technique whereby laminar fl ow 
between very closely spaced parallel plates simulated potential fl ow when viewed

from above the plates. Obstructions simulate body shapes, and dye streaks represent 
the streamlines. The Hele-Shaw apparatus makes an excellent laboratory demonstra-
tion of potential fl ow [10, pp. 197–198, 219–220]. Figure 8.17a illustrates Hele-Shaw 
(potential) fl ow through an array of cylinders, a fl ow pattern that would be diffi cult 
to analyze just using Laplace’s equation. However beautiful this array pattern may 
be, it is not a good approximation to real (laminar viscous) array fl ow. Figure 8.17b 
shows experimental streakline patterns for a similar staggered-array fl ow at Re < 
6400. We see that the interacting wakes of the real fl ow (Fig. 8.17b) cause intensive 
mixing and transverse motion, not the smooth streaming passage of the potential fl ow 
model (Fig. 8.17a). The moral is that this is an internal fl ow with multiple bodies 
and, therefore, not a good candidate for a realistic potential fl ow model.
 
Other fl ow-mapping techniques are discussed in Ref. 8. Electromagnetic fi elds also 
satisfy Laplace’s equation, with voltage analogous to velocity potential and current 
lines analogous to streamlines. At one time commercial analog fi eld plotters were 
available, using thin conducting paper cut to the shape of the fl ow geometry. Potential 
lines (voltage contours) were plotted by probing the paper with a potentiometer 
pointer. Hand-sketching “curvilinear square” techniques were also popular. The avail-
ability and the simplicity of computer potential fl ow methods [5 to 7] have made 
analog models obsolete.

A Kelvin oval from Fig. 8.16 has K/(U∞ a) 5 1.0. Compute the velocity at the top shoulder 
of the oval in terms of U∞.
Solution
We must locate the shoulder y 5 h from Eq. (8.45) for ψ 5 0 and then compute the velocity 
by differentiation. At ψ 5 0 and y 5 h and x 5 0, Eq. (8.45) becomes

8.5 Other Plane Potential 
Flows3
 
References 2 to 4 treat many other potential fl ows of interest in addition to the cases 
presented in Secs. 8.3 and 8.4. In principle, any plane potential fl ow can be solved 
by the method of conformal mapping, by using the complex variable
z 5 x 1 iy   i 5 (21)1/2
It turns out that any arbitrary analytic function of this complex variable z has the remarkable 
property that both its real and its imaginary parts are solutions of Laplace’s equation. If
f(z) 5 f(x 1 iy) 5 f1(x, y) 1 i f2(x, y)
then 
02f1
0x2 1 02f1
0y2 5 0 5 02f2
0x2 1 02f2
0y2  
(8.46)
We shall assign the proof of this as Prob. W8.4. Even more remarkable if you have 
never seen it before is that lines of constant f1 will be everywhere perpendicular to 
lines of constant f2:
 
ady
dxb
f15C
5 2
1
(dy/dx)f25C
 
(8.47)
This is true for totally arbitrary f(z) as long as this function is analytic; that is, it must 
have a unique derivative df/dz at every point in the region.
 
The net result of Eqs. (8.46) and (8.47) is that the functions f1 and f2 can be interpreted 
to be the potential lines and streamlines of an inviscid fl ow. By long custom we let the 
real part of f(z) be the velocity potential and the imaginary part be the stream function:
 
f(z) 5 ϕ(x, y) 1 iψ(x, y) 
(8.48)
We try various functions f(z) and see whether any interesting fl ow pattern results. Of 
course, most of them have already been found, and we simply report on them here.
 
We shall not go into the details, but there are excellent treatments of this complex-
variable technique on both an introductory [4] and a more advanced [2, 3] level. The 
method is less important now because of the popularity of computer techniques.
 
As a simple example, consider the linear function
f(z) 5 U∞ z 5 U∞ x 1 iU∞ y
It follows from Eq. (8.48) that ϕ 5 U∞ x and ψ 5 U∞ y, which, we recall from Eq. (8.12), 
represents a uniform stream in the x direction. Once you get used to the complex 
variable, the solution practically falls in your lap.
 
To fi nd the velocities, you may either separate ϕ and ψ from f(z) and differentiate, 
or differentiate f directly:
 
df
dz 5 0ϕ
0x 1 i 0ψ
0x  5 2i 0ϕ
0y 1 0ψ
0y 5 u 2 iυ 
(8.49)
Thus the real part of df/dz equals u(x, y), and the imaginary part equals 2υ (x, y). To get 
a practical result, the derivative df/dz must exist and be unique, hence the requirement 
3This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

548 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
that f be an analytic function. For f(z) 5 U∞ z, df/dz 5 U∞ 5 u, since it is real, and 
υ 5 0, as expected.
 
Sometimes it is convenient to use the polar coordinate form of the complex 
variable
z 5 x 1 iy 5 reiθ 5 r cos θ 1 ir sin θ
where 
r 5 (x2 1 y2)1/2 
   
θ 5 tan21 y
x 
This form is especially convenient when powers of z occur.
Uniform Stream at an Angle 
of Attack
 
All the elementary plane fl ows of Sec. 8.2 have a complex-variable formulation. The 
uniform stream U∞ at an angle of attack α has the complex potential
 
f(z) 5 U∞ze2iα 
(8.50)
Compare this form with Eq. (8.22).
Line Source at a Point z0 
Consider a line source of strength m placed off the origin at a point z0 5 x0 1 iy0. 
Its complex potential is
 
f(z) 5 m ln (z 2 z0) 
(8.51)
This can be compared with Eq. (8.13), which is valid only for the source at the origin. 
For a line sink, the strength m is negative.
Line Vortex at a Point z0 
If a line vortex of strength K is placed at point z0, its complex potential is
 
f(z) 5 2iK ln (z 2 z0) 
(8.52)
to be compared with Eq. (8.14). Also compare to Eq. (8.51) to see that we reverse 
the meaning of ϕ and ψ simply by multiplying the complex potential by 2i.
Flow around a Corner 
of Arbitrary Angle
 
Corner fl ow is an example of a pattern that cannot be conveniently produced by 
superimposing sources, sinks, and vortices. It has a strikingly simple complex 
representation:
f(z) 5 Azn 5 Arneinθ 5 Arn cos nθ 1 iArn sin nθ
where A and n are constants.
 
It follows from Eq. (8.48) that for this pattern
 
ϕ 5 Arn cos nθ   ψ 5 Arn sin nθ 
(8.53)
 
Streamlines from Eq. (8.53) are plotted in Fig. 8.18 for fi ve different values of n. 
The fl ow is seen to represent a stream turning through an angle β 5 π/n. Patterns in 
Fig. 8.18d and e are not realistic on the downstream side of the corner, where separa-
tion will occur due to the adverse pressure gradient and sudden change of direction. 
In general, separation always occurs downstream of salient, or protruding corners, except 
in creeping fl ows at low Reynolds number Re , 1.

8.5  Other Plane Potential Flows 549
 
Since 3608 5 2π is the largest possible corner, the patterns for n , 1
2 do not 
represent corner fl ow.
 
If we expand the plot of Fig. 8.18a to c to double size, we can represent stagnation 
fl ow toward a corner of angle 2β 5 2π/n. This is done in Fig. 8.19 for n 5 3, 2, and 
1.5. These are very realistic fl ows; although they slip at the wall, they can be patched 
to boundary layer theories very successfully. We took a brief look at corner fl ows 
before, in Examples 4.5 and 4.9 and in Probs. P4.49 to P4.51.
Flow Normal to a Flat Plate 
We treat this case separately because the Kelvin ovals of Fig. 8.16 failed to degenerate 
into a fl at plate as K became small. The fl at plate normal to a uniform stream is an 
extreme case worthy of our attention.
 
Although the result is quite simple, the derivation is very complicated and is given, 
for example, in Ref. 2, Sec. 9.3. There are three changes of complex variable, or 
mappings, beginning with the basic cylinder fl ow solution of Fig. 8.14a. First the 
uniform stream is rotated to be vertical upward, then the cylinder is squeezed down 
into a plate shape, and fi nally the free stream is rotated back to the horizontal. The 
fi nal result for complex potential is
 
f(z) 5 ϕ 1 iψ 5 U∞(z2 1 a2)1/2 
(8.54)
where 2a is the height of the plate. To isolate ϕ or ψ, square both sides and separate 
real and imaginary parts:

Equation (8.55) is plotted in Fig. 8.20a, revealing a doubly symmetric pattern of 
streamlines that approach very closely to the plate and then defl ect up and over, with 
very high velocities and low pressures near the plate tips.
 
The velocity υs along the plate surface is found by computing df/dz from Eq. (8.54) 
and isolating the imaginary part:

The origin is a stagnation point; then the velocity grows linearly at fi rst and very 
rapidly near the tip, with both velocity and acceleration being infi nite at the tip.
 
As you might guess, Fig. 8.20a is not realistic. In a real fl ow the sharp salient edge 
causes separation, and a broad, low-pressure wake forms in the lee, as in Fig. 8.20b. 
Instead of being zero, the drag coeffi cient is very large, CD < 2.0 from Table 7.2.
 
A discontinuous potential fl ow theory that accounts for fl ow separation was devised 
by Helmholtz in 1868 and Kirchhoff in 1869. This free-streamline solution is shown 
in Fig. 8.20c, with the streamline that breaks away from the tip having a constant

The previous solutions have all been for unbounded fl ows, such as a circular cylinder 
immersed in a broad expanse of uniformly streaming fl uid, Fig. 8.14a. However, 
many practical problems involve a nearby rigid boundary constraining the fl ow, such 
as (1) groundwater fl ow near the bottom of a dam, (2) an airfoil near the ground, 
simulating landing or takeoff, or (3) a cylinder mounted in a wind tunnel with narrow

walls. In such cases the basic unbounded potential fl ow solutions can be modifi ed 
for wall effects by the method of images.
 
Consider a line source placed a distance a from a wall, as in Fig. 8.21a. To create 
the desired wall, an image source of identical strength is placed the same distance 
below the wall. By symmetry the two sources create a plane surface streamline 
between them, which is taken to be the wall.
 
In Fig. 8.21b a vortex near a wall requires an image vortex the same distance below 
but of opposite rotation. We have shaded in the wall, but of course the pattern could 
also be interpreted as the fl ow near a vortex pair in an unbounded fl uid.
 
In Fig. 8.21c an airfoil in a uniform stream near the ground is created by an image 
airfoil below the ground of opposite circulation and lift. This looks easy, but actually 
it is not because the airfoils are so close together that they interact and distort each

other’s shapes. A rule of thumb is that nonnegligible shape distortion occurs if the 
body shape is within two chord lengths of the wall. To eliminate distortion, a whole 
series of “corrective” images must be added to the fl ow to recapture the shape of the 
original isolated airfoil. Reference 2, Sec. 7.75, has a good discussion of this proce-
dure, which usually requires computer summation of the multiple images needed.
 
Figure 8.21d shows a source constrained between two walls. One wall required 
only one image in Fig. 8.21a, but two walls require an infi nite array of image sources 
above and below the desired pattern, as shown. Usually computer summation is neces-
sary, but sometimes a closed-form summation can be achieved, as in the infi nite 
vortex row of Eq. (8.28).
EXAMPLE 8.5
For the source near a wall as in Fig. 8.21a, the wall velocity is zero between the sources, 
rises to a maximum moving out along the wall, and then drops to zero far from the sources. 
If the source strength is 8 m2/s, how far from the wall should the source be to ensure that 
the maximum velocity along the wall will be 5 m/s?
Solution
At any point x along the wall, as in Fig. E8.5, each source induces a radial outward velocity 
υr 5 m/r, which has a component υr cos θ along the wall. The total wall velocity is thus

8.7 Airfoil Theory5
 
As mentioned in conjunction with the Kutta-Joukowski lift theorem, Eq. (8.43), the 
problem in airfoil theory is to determine the net circulation Γ as a function of airfoil 
shape and free-stream angle of attack α.
The Kutta Condition
 
Even if the airfoil shape and free-stream angle of attack are specifi ed, the potential 
fl ow theory solution is nonunique: An infi nite family of solutions can be found cor-
responding to different values of circulation Γ. Four examples of this nonuniqueness 
were shown for the cylinder fl ows in Fig. 8.14. The same is true of the airfoil, and 
Fig. 8.22 shows three mathematically acceptable “solutions” to a given airfoil fl ow 
for small (Fig. 8.22a), large (Fig. 8.22b), and medium (Fig. 8.22c) net circulation.

Fig. 8.22 The Kutta condition 
properly simulates the fl ow about 
an airfoil; (a) too little circulation, 
stagnation point on rear upper 
surface; (b) too much, stagnation 
point on rear lower surface; (c) just 
right, Kutta condition requires 
smooth fl ow at trailing edge.

8.7  Airfoil Theory 555
You can guess which case best simulates a real airfoil from the earlier discussion of 
transient lift development in Fig. 7.23. It is the case (Fig. 8.22c) where the upper and 
lower fl ows meet and leave the trailing edge smoothly. If the trailing edge is rounded 
slightly, there will be a stagnation point there. If the trailing edge is sharp, approxi-
mating most airfoil designs, the upper- and lower-surface fl ow velocities will be equal 
as they meet and leave the airfoil.
 
This statement of the physically proper value of Γ is generally attributed to W. M. 
Kutta, hence the name Kutta condition, although some texts give credit to Joukowski 
and/or Chaplygin. All airfoil theories use the Kutta condition, which is in good agree-
ment with experiment. It turns out that the correct circulation ΓKutta depends on fl ow 
velocity, angle of attack, and airfoil shape.
Potential Theory for Thick 
Cambered Airfoils
 
The theory of thick cambered airfoils is covered in advanced texts [for example, 
2 to 4]; Ref. 13 has a thorough and comprehensive review of both inviscid and viscous 
aspects of airfoil behavior.
 
Basically the theory uses a complex-variable mapping that transforms the fl ow 
about a cylinder with circulation in Fig. 8.14 into fl ow about a foil shape with circula-
tion. The circulation is then adjusted to match the Kutta condition of smooth exit fl ow 
from the trailing edge.
 
Regardless of the exact airfoil shape, the inviscid mapping theory predicts that the 
correct circulation for any thick cambered airfoil is
ΓKutta 5 πCU∞ a1 1 0.77 t
Cb sin (α 1 β) 
(8.57)
where β 5 tan21 (2h/C) and h is the maximum camber, or maximum deviation of 
the airfoil midline from its chord line, as in Fig. 8.24a.
 
The lift coeffi cient of the infi nite-span airfoil is thus
 
CL 5
ρU∞Γ
1
2ρU 2
∞ bC 5 2π a1 1 0.77 t
Cb sin (α 1 β) 
(8.58)
Figure 8.23 shows that the thickness effect 1 1 0.77t/C is not verifi ed by experiment. Some 
airfoils increase lift with thickness, others decrease, and none approach the theory very 
closely, the primary reason being the boundary layer growth on the upper surface affecting 
the airfoil “shape.” Thus it is customary to drop the thickness effect from the theory:
CL < 2π sin (α 1 β)  
(8.59)
The theory correctly predicts that a cambered airfoil will have fi nite lift at zero angle 
of attack and zero lift (ZL) at an angle
αZL 5 2β 5 2tan21 2h
C  
(8.60)
Equation (8.60) overpredicts the measured zero-lift angle by 18 or so, as shown in 
Table 8.3. The measured values are essentially independent of thickness. The designa-
tion XX in the NACA series indicates the thickness in percent, and the other digits 
refer to camber and other details. For example, the 2415 airfoil has 2 percent maximum

the same position as the maximum camber.

8.7  Airfoil Theory 557
 
Figure 8.24b shows the measured position of the center of pressure of the various 
NACA airfoils, both symmetric and cambered. In all cases xCP is within 0.02 chord 
length of the theoretical quarter-chord point. The standard cambered airfoils (24, 44, 
and 230 series) lie slightly forward of x/C 5 0.25 and the low-drag (60 series) foils 
slightly aft. The symmetric airfoils are at 0.25.
 
Figure 8.24c shows the minimum drag coeffi cient of NACA airfoils as a func-
tion of thickness. As mentioned earlier in conjunction with Fig. 7.25, these foils 
when smooth actually have less drag than turbulent fl ow parallel to a fl at plate, 
especially the low-drag 60 series. However, for standard surface roughness all 
foils have about the same minimum drag, roughly 30 percent greater than that for 
a smooth fl at plate.

Wings of Finite Span 
The results of airfoil theory and experiment in the previous subsection were for two-
dimensional, or infi nite-span, wings. But all real wings have tips and are therefore of 
fi nite span or fi nite aspect ratio AR, defi ned by
 
AR 5 b2
Ap
5 b
C 
(8.61)
where b is the span length from tip to tip and Ap is the planform area of the wing as 
seen from above. The lift and drag coeffi cients of a fi nite-aspect-ratio wing depend 
strongly on the aspect ratio and slightly on the planform shape of the wing.
 
Vortices cannot end in a fl uid; they must either extend to the boundary or form a 
closed loop. Figure 8.25a shows how the vortices that provide the wing circulation bend 
downstream at fi nite wing tips and extend far behind the wing to join the starting vortex 
(Fig. 7.23) downstream. The strongest vortices are shed from the tips, but some are shed 
from the body of the wing, as sketched schematically in Fig. 8.25b. The effective cir-
culation Γ(y) of these trailing shed vortices is zero at the tips and usually a maximum 
at the center plane, or root, of the wing. In 1918 Prandtl successfully modeled this fl ow 
by replacing the wing with a single lifting line and a continuous sheet of semi-infi nite 
trailing vortices of strength γ(y) 5 dΓ/dy, as in Fig. 8.25c. Each elemental piece of 
trailing sheet γ(η) dη induces a downwash, or downward velocity, dw(y), given by
dw(y) 5
γ (η) dη
4π (y 2 η)
at position y on the lifting line. Note the denominator term 4π rather than 2π because 
the trailing vortex extends only from 0 to ∞ rather than from 2∞ to 1∞.
 
The total downwash w(y) induced by the entire trailing vortex system is thus
 
w(y) 5 1
4π #
(1/2)b
2(1/2)b γ (η) dη
y 2 η  
(8.62)
When the downwash is vectorially added to the approaching free stream U∞, the 
effective angle of attack at this section of the wing is reduced to
 
αeff 5 α 2 αi 
    
αi 5 tan21 w
U∞

(8.63)
where we have used a small-amplitude approximation w ! U∞.
 
The fi nal step is to assume that the local circulation Γ(y) is equal to that of a two-
dimensional wing of the same shape and same effective angle of attack. From thin-
airfoil theory we have the estimate

or

span wing:

The complete solution to Eq. (8.65) for arbitrary wing planform C(y) and arbitrary 
twist α(y) is treated in advanced texts [for example, 11]. It turns out that there is a 
simple representative solution for an untwisted wing of elliptical planform:

exactly similar shape:
Γ(y) 5 Γ0 c 1 2 a2y

Substituting into Eq. (8.65) and integrating give a relation between Γ0 and C0:

where α is assumed constant across the untwisted wing.
 
Substitution into Eq. (8.66) gives the elliptical wing lift:

Figure 8.26 shows the effectiveness of this theory when tested against a nonellipti-
cal cambered wing by Prandtl in 1921 [14]. Figures 8.26a and b show the measured 
lift curves and drag polars for fi ve different aspect ratios. Note the increase in stall 
angle and drag and the decrease in lift slope as the aspect ratio decreases.

8.7  Airfoil Theory 561
 
Figure 8.26c shows the lift data replotted against effective angle of attack 
αeff 5 (α 1 β)/(1 1 2/AR), as predicted by Eq. (8.69). These curves should be 
equivalent to an infi nite-aspect-ratio wing, and they do collapse together except near 
stall. Their common slope dCL/dα is about 10 percent less than the theoretical value 
2π, but this is consistent with the thickness and shape effects noted in Fig. 8.23.
 
Figure 8.26d shows the drag data replotted with the theoretical induced drag 
CDi 5 C2
L/(πAR) subtracted out. Again, except near stall, the data collapse onto a 
single line of nearly constant infi nite-aspect-ratio drag CD0 < 0.01. We conclude that 
the fi nite-wing theory is very effective and may be used for design calculations.
Aircraft Trailing Vortices
 
The trailing vortices in Fig. 8.25a are real, not just mathematical abstractions. On 
commercial aircraft, such vortices are long, strong, and lingering. They can stretch 
for miles behind a large aircraft and endanger the following planes by inducing drastic 
rolling moments. The vortex persistence governs the separation distance between 
planes at an airport and thus determines airport capacity. An example of strong trailing

8.8 Axisymmetric Potential 
Flow6
 
The same superposition technique that worked so well for plane fl ow in Sec. 8.3 is 
also successful for axisymmetric potential fl ow. We give some brief examples here.
 
Most of the basic results carry over from plane to axisymmetric fl ow with only slight 
changes owing to the geometric differences. Consider the following related fl ows:

8.8  Axisymmetric Potential Flow 563
Since there is no such thing as a point vortex, we must forgo the pleasure of studying 
circulation effects in axisymmetric fl ow. However, as any smoker knows, there is an 
axisymmetric ring vortex, and there are also ring sources and ring sinks, which we 
leave to advanced texts [for example, 3].
Spherical Polar Coordinates
 
Axisymmetric potential fl ows are conveniently treated in the spherical polar coordi-
nates of Fig. 8.28. There are only two coordinates (r, θ), and fl ow properties are 
constant on a circle of radius r sin θ about the x axis.
 
The equation of continuity for incompressible fl ow in these coordinates is
 
0
0r (r2υr sin θ) 1 0
0θ (rυθ sin θ) 5 0 
(8.72)
where υr and υθ are radial and tangential velocity as shown. Thus a spherical polar 
stream function7 exists such that
 
υr 5 2 
1
r2 sin θ 0ψ
0θ    υθ 5

r sin θ 0ψ

In like manner a velocity potential ϕ (r, θ) exists such that
 
υr 5 0ϕ
0r    υθ 5 1
r 0ϕ
0θ  
(8.74)
These formulas serve to deduce the ψ and ϕ functions for various elementary axisym-
metric potential fl ows.
Uniform Stream in the x Direction  
A stream U∞ in the x direction has components
υr 5 U∞ cos θ   υθ 5 2U∞ sin θ

viscous sphere fl ow.

Uniform Stream plus a 
Point Source
 
By combining Eqs. (8.75) and (8.77), we obtain the stream function for a uniform 
stream plus a point source at the origin:
 
ψ 521
2 U∞r 2 sin2 θ 1 m cos θ 
(8.80)
From Eq. (8.73) the velocity components are, by differentiation,
 
υr 5 U∞ cos θ 1 m
r2    υθ 5 2U∞ sin θ 
(8.81)
Setting these equal to zero reveals a stagnation point at θ 5 1808 and r 5 a 5 (m/U∞)1/2, 
as shown in Fig. 8.30. If we let m 5 U∞a2, the stream function can be rewritten as
 
ψ

(8.82)
The stream surface that passes through the stagnation point (r, θ) 5 (a, π) has the 
value ψ 5 2U∞a2 and forms a half-body of revolution enclosing the point source, 
as shown in Fig. 8.30. This half-body can be used to simulate a pitot tube. Far down-
stream the half-body approaches the constant radius R 5 2a about the x axis. The 
maximum velocity and minimum pressure along the half-body surface occur at 
θ 5 70.58, r 5 a23, Vs 5 1.155U∞. Downstream of this point there is an adverse 
gradient as Vs slowly decelerates to U∞, but boundary layer theory indicates no fl ow 
separation. Thus Eq. (8.82) is a very realistic simulation of a real half-body fl ow. But 
when the uniform stream is added to a sink to form a half-body rear surface, similar 
to Fig. 8.9c, separation is predicted and the rear inviscid pattern is not realistic.

half-body of revolution.

This is exactly analogous to the cylinder fl ow of Fig. 8.14a formed by combining a 
uniform stream and a line doublet.

2U∞a2 5 2sin2 θ a r2

(8.85)
The streamlines for this sphere fl ow are plotted in Fig. 8.31. By differentiation from 
Eq. (8.73) the velocity components are
 
υr 5 U∞ cos θ a1 2 a3
r3 b    υθ 5 21
2 U∞ sin θ a2 1 a3
r3 b 
(8.86)
We see that the radial velocity vanishes at the sphere surface r 5 a, as expected. 
There is a stagnation point at the front (a, π) and the rear (a, 0) of the sphere. The 
maximum velocity occurs at the shoulder (a, 61
2π), where υr 5 0 and υθ 5 71.5U∞. 
The surface velocity distribution is
 
Vs 5 2υθ0r5a 5 3
2 U∞ sin θ 
(8.87)
Note the similarity to the cylinder surface velocity equal to 2U∞ sin θ from Eq. (8.39) 
with zero circulation.
 
Equation (8.87) predicts, as expected, an adverse pressure gradient on the rear 
(θ , 908) of the sphere. If we use this distribution with laminar boundary layer theory 
[for example, 15, p. 294], separation is computed to occur at about θ 5 768, so that 
in the actual fl ow pattern of Fig. 7.14 a broad wake forms in the rear. This wake 
interacts with the free stream and causes Eq. (8.87) to be inaccurate even in the front 
of the sphere. The measured maximum surface velocity is equal only to about 1.3U∞ 
and occurs at about θ 5 1078 (see Ref. 15, Sec. 4.10.4, for further details).
The Concept of Hydrodynamic 
Mass
 
When a body moves through a fl uid, it must push a fi nite mass of fl uid out of the 
way. If the body is accelerated, the surrounding fl uid must also be accelerated. The 
body behaves as if it were heavier by an amount called the hydrodynamic mass (also

called the added or virtual mass) of the fl uid. If the instantaneous body velocity is 
U(t), the summation of forces must include this effect:
 
o F 5 (m 1 mh) d U
dt  
(8.88)
where mh, the hydrodynamic mass, is a function of body shape, the direction of 
motion, and (to a lesser extent) fl ow parameters such as the Reynolds number.
 
According to potential theory [2, Sec. 6.4; 3, Sec. 9.22], mh depends only on the 
shape and direction of motion and can be computed by summing the total kinetic 
energy of the fl uid relative to the body and setting this equal to an equivalent body 
energy:
 
KEfluid 5 #

2 dm V2
rel 5 1
2 mhU 2 
(8.89)
The integration of fl uid kinetic energy can also be accomplished by a body-surface 
integral involving the velocity potential [16, Sec. 11].
 
Consider the previous example of a sphere immersed in a uniform stream. By 
subtracting out the stream velocity we can replot the fl ow as in Fig. 8.32, showing 
the streamlines relative to the moving sphere. Note the similarity to the doublet fl ow 
in Fig. 8.29. The relative velocity components are found by subtracting U from 
Eqs. (8.86):

The element of fl uid mass, in spherical polar coordinates, is

When dm and V2

or

(8.90)
Thus, according to potential theory, the hydrodynamic mass of a sphere equals one-
half of its displaced mass, independent of the direction of motion.
 
A similar result for a cylinder moving normal to its axis can be computed from 
Eqs. (8.38) after subtracting out the stream velocity. The result is
 
mh(cylinder) 5 ρπa2L 
(8.91)
for a cylinder of length L, assuming two-dimensional motion. The cylinder’s hydro-
dynamic mass equals its displaced mass.
 
Tables of hydrodynamic mass for various body shapes and directions of motion 
are given by Patton [17]. See also Ref. 21.
8.9 Numerical Analysis
 
When potential fl ow involves complicated geometries or unusual stream conditions, 
the classical superposition scheme of Secs. 8.3 and 8.4 becomes less attractive. Con-
formal mapping of body shapes, by using the complex-variable technique of Sec. 8.5, 
is no longer popular. Numerical analysis is the appropriate modern approach, and at 
least three different approaches are in use:
1. The fi nite element method (FEM) [6, 19]
2. The fi nite difference method (FDM) [5, 20, 23–26], or its close sibling, the 
fi nite volume method [27].
3. a. Integral methods with distributed singularities [18]
b. The boundary element method (BEM) [7, 38]
Methods 3a and 3b are closely related, having fi rst been developed on an ad hoc basis 
by aerodynamicists in the 1960s [18] and then generalized into a multipurpose applied 
mechanics technique in the 1970s [7].
 
Methods 1 (or FEM) and 2 (or FDM), though strikingly different in concept, are 
comparable in scope, mesh size, and general accuracy. We concentrate here on the 
latter method for illustration purposes.
 
All three of these methods—FEM, FDM, and BEM—are popular in present-day 
computational fl uid dynamics. Although simplifi ed online CFD codes are available—
sometimes free—the writer believes that CFD, as a serious method of fl ow analysis, 
should wait until one studies the professional software available. This subject is more 
appropriate for advanced electives or graduate school. The discussion here will be 
brief and descriptive, with only nominal illustrations for an FDM method.
The Finite Element Method
 
The fi nite element method [19] is applicable to all types of linear and nonlinear partial 
differential equations in physics and engineering. The computational domain is divided 

8.9  Numerical Analysis 569
into small regions, usually triangular or quadrilateral. These regions are delineated 
with a fi nite number of nodes where the fi eld variables—temperature, velocity, pres-
sure, stream function, and so on—are to be calculated. The solution in each region is 
approximated by an algebraic combination of local nodal values. Then the approxi-
mate functions are integrated over the region, and their error is minimized, often by 
using a weighting function. This process yields a set of N algebraic equations for the 
N unknown nodal values. The nodal equations are solved simultaneously, by matrix 
inversion or iteration. For further details see Ref. 6 or 19.
The Finite Difference Method
 
Although textbooks on numerical analysis [5, 20] apply fi nite difference techniques 
to many different problems, here we concentrate on potential fl ow. The idea of FDM 
is to approximate the partial derivatives in a physical equation by “differences” 
between nodal values spaced a fi nite distance apart—a sort of numerical calculus. The 
basic partial differential equation is thus replaced by a set of algebraic equations for 
the nodal values. For potential (inviscid) fl ow, these algebraic equations are linear, 
but they are generally nonlinear for viscous fl ows. The solution for nodal values is 
obtained by iteration or matrix inversion. Nodal spacings need not be equal.
 
Here we illustrate the two-dimensional Laplace equation, choosing for convenience 
the stream-function form
 
02ψ
0x2 1 02ψ
0y2 5 0 
(8.92)
subject to known values of ψ along any body surface and known values of ≠ψ/≠x 
and ≠ψ/≠y in the free stream.
 
Our fi nite difference technique divides the fl ow fi eld into equally spaced nodes, as 
shown in Fig. 8.33. To economize on the use of parentheses or functional notation, 
△ y
△ x
△ x
△ y

difference grid.

570 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
subscripts i and j denote the position of an arbitrary, equally spaced node, and ψi, j
denotes the value of the stream function at that node:
ψi,j 5 ψ(x0 1 i ¢x, y0 1 j ¢y)
Thus ψi11, j is just to the right of ψi, j, and ψi, j11 is just above.
 
An algebraic approximation for the derivative ≠ψ/≠x is
0ψ
0x < ψ(x 1 ¢x, y) 2 ψ(x, y)
¢x
A similar approximation for the second derivative is
02ψ
0x2 < 1
¢x c ψ(x 1 ¢x, y) 2 ψ(x, y)
¢x
2 ψ(x, y) 2 ψ(x 2 ¢x, y)
¢x
d
The subscript notation makes these expressions more compact:
0ψ
0x < 1
¢x (ψi11, j 2 ψi, j) 
02ψ
0x2 <
1
¢x2 (ψi11, j 2 2ψi, j 1 ψi21, j) 
(8.93)
These formulas are exact in the calculus limit as Dx → 0, but in numerical analysis 
we keep Dx and Dy fi nite, hence the term fi nite differences.
 
In an exactly similar manner we can derive the equivalent difference expressions 
for the y direction:
0ψ
0y < 1
¢y (ψi, j11 2 ψi, j) 
02ψ
0y2 <
1
¢y2 (ψi, j11 2 2ψi, j 1 ψi, j21) 
(8.94)
The use of subscript notation allows these expressions to be programmed directly into 
a scientifi c computer language.
 
When (8.93) and (8.94) are substituted into Laplace’s equation (8.92), the result is 
the algebraic formula
2(1 1 β)ψi, j < ψi21, j 1 ψi11, j 1 β(ψi, j21 1 ψi, j11) 
(8.95)
where β 5 (Dx/Dy)2 depends on the mesh size selected. This fi nite difference model 
of Laplace’s equation states that every nodal stream-function value ψi, j is a linear 
combination of its four nearest neighbors.
 
The most commonly programmed case is a square mesh (β 5 1), for which Eq. 
(8.95) reduces to
ψi, j < 1
4(ψi, j11 1 ψi, j21 1 ψi11, j 1 ψi21, j)  
(8.96)
Thus, for a square mesh, each nodal value equals the arithmetic average of the four 
neighbors shown in Fig. 8.33. The formula is easily remembered and easily pro-
grammed. The formula is applied in iterative fashion sweeping over each of the 

8.9  Numerical Analysis 571
internal nodes (I, J), with known values of P specifi ed at each of the surrounding 
boundary nodes. Any initial guesses can be specifi ed for the internal nodes, and the 
iteration process will converge to the fi nal algebraic solution in a fi nite number of 
sweeps. The numerical error, compared with the exact solution of Laplace’s equation, 
is proportional to the square of the mesh size.
The Boundary Element Method
 
A relatively new technique for numerical solution of partial differential equations is 
the boundary element method (BEM). Reference 7 is an introductory textbook outlin-
ing the concepts of BEM. There are no interior elements. Rather, all nodes are placed 
on the boundary of the domain, as in Fig. 8.34. The “element” is a small piece of the 
boundary surrounding the node. The “strength” of the element can be either constant 
or variable.
 
For plane potential fl ow, the method takes advantage of the particular solution
 
ψ* 5 1
2π ln 1
r 
(8.97)
which satisfi es Laplace’s equation, =2ψ 5 0. Each element i is assumed to have a 
different strength ψi. Then r represents the distance from that element to any other 
point in the fl ow fi eld. Summing all these elemental effects, with proper boundary 
conditions, will give the total solution to the potential fl ow problem.
 
At each element of the boundary, we typically know either the value of ψ or the 
value of ≠ψ/≠n, where n is normal to the boundary. (Mixed combinations of ψ and 
≠ψ/≠n are also possible but are not discussed here.) The correct strengths ψi are such 
that these boundary conditions are satisfi ed at every element. Summing these effects 
over N elements requires integration by parts plus a careful evaluation of the (singular) 
effect of element i upon itself. The mathematical details are given in Ref. 7. The result 
is a set of N algebraic equations for the unknown boundary values. In the case of 
elements of constant strength, the fi nal expression is

572 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
 
Reference 7 is a general introduction to boundary elements, while Ref. 38 empha-
sizes programming methods. Meanwhile, research continues. Dargush and Grigoriev 
[42] have developed a multilevel boundary element method for steady Stokes or 
creeping fl ows (see Sec. 7.6) in irregular geometries. Their scheme avoids the heavy 
memory and CPU-time requirements of most boundary element methods. They esti-
mate that CPU time is reduced by a factor of 700,000 and required memory is reduced 
by a factor of 16,000.
Viscous Flow Computer Models
 
Our previous fi nite difference model of Laplace’s equation, as in Eq. (8.96), was very 
well behaved and converged nicely with or without overrelaxation. Much more care 
is needed to model the full Navier-Stokes equations. The challenges are quite differ-
ent, and they have been met to a large extent, so there are now many textbooks 
[5, 20, 23 to 27] on (fully viscous) CFD. This is not a textbook on CFD, but we will 
address some of the issues in this section.
One-Dimensional Unsteady Flow
 
We consider a simplifi ed problem, showing that even a single viscous term introduces 
new effects and possible instabilities. Recall (or review) Prob. P4.85, where a wall 
moves and drives a viscous fl uid parallel to itself. Gravity is neglected. Let the wall 
be the plane y 5 0, moving at a speed U0(t), as in Fig. 8.35. A uniform vertical grid, 
of spacing Dy, has nodes n at which the local velocity u j
n is to be calculated, where 
superscript j denotes the time-step jDt. The wall is n 5 1. If u 5 u(y, t) only and 
υ 5 w 5 0, continuity, = ? V 5 0, is satisfi ed, and we need only solve the x-momentum 
Navier-Stokes equation:
 
0u
0t 5 ν 02u
0y2  
(8.99)
where ν 5 μ/ρ. Utilizing the same fi nite difference approximations as in Eq. (8.93), 
we may model Eq. (8.99) algebraically as a forward time difference and a central 
spatial difference:

difference mesh for one-dimensional

8.9  Numerical Analysis 573
Rearrange and fi nd that we can solve explicitly for un at the next time-step j 1 1:
 
u j11
n
< (1 2 2σ) u j
n 1 σ(u j
n21 1 u j
n11)    σ 5 ν¢t
¢y2 
(8.100)
Thus u at node n at the next time-step j 1 1 is a weighted average of three previous 
values, similar to the “four-nearest-neighbors” average in the laplacian model of 
Eq. (8.96). Since the new velocity is calculated immediately, Eq. (8.100) is called an 
explicit model. It differs from the well-behaved laplacian model, however, because it 
may be unstable. The weighting coeffi cients in Eq. (8.100) must all be positive to 
avoid divergence. Now σ is positive, but (1 2 2σ) may not be. Therefore, our explicit 
viscous fl ow model has a stability requirement:
 
σ 5 ν¢t
¢y2 # 1
2 
(8.101)
Normally one would fi rst set up the mesh size Dy in Fig. 8.35, after which Eq. (8.101) 
would limit the time-step Dt. The solutions for nodal values would then be stable, but 
not necessarily that accurate. The mesh sizes Dy and Dt could be reduced to increase 
accuracy, similar to the case of the potential fl ow laplacian model (8.96).
 
For example, to solve Prob. P4.85 numerically, one sets up a mesh with plenty of nodes 
(30 or more Dy within the expected viscous layer); selects Dt according to Eq. (8.101); 
and sets two boundary conditions8 for all j: u1 5 U0 sin ωt and uN 5 0, where N is the 
outermost node. For initial conditions, perhaps assume the fl uid initially at rest: u 1
n 5 0 
for 2 # n # N 2 1. Sweeping the nodes 2 # n # N 21 using Eq. (8.100) (an Excel 
spreadsheet is excellent for this), one generates numerical values of u j
n for as long as one 
desires. After an initial transient, the fi nal “steady” fl uid oscillation will approach the 
classical solution in viscous fl ow textbooks [15]. Try Prob. P8.115 to demonstrate this.
Steady Two-Dimensional 
Laminar Flow
 
The previous example, unsteady one-dimensional fl ow, had only one viscous term and 
no convective accelerations. Let us look briefl y at incompressible two-dimensional 
steady fl ow, which has four of each type of term, plus a nontrivial continuity 
equation:
Continuity: 
0u
0x 1 0υ
0y 5 0 
(8.102a)
x momentum: 
u 0u
0x 1 υ 0u
0y 5 21
ρ 0p
0x 1 ν a 02u
0x2 1 02u
0y2b 
(8.102b)
y momentum: 
u 0υ
0x 1 υ 0υ
0y  5 21
ρ 0p
0y 1 ν a 02υ
0x2 1 02υ
0y2 b 
(8.102c)
These equations, to be solved for (u, υ, p) as functions of (x, y), are familiar to us 
from analytical solutions in Chaps. 4 and 6. However, to a numerical analyst, they 
are odd, because there is no pressure equation—that is, a differential equation for 
which the dominant derivatives involve p. This situation has led to several different 
8Finite differences are not analytical; one must set U0 and ω equal to numerical values.

574 Chapter 8 Potential Flow and Computational Fluid Dynamics  
“pressure adjustment” schemes in the literature [20, 23 to 27], most of which manip-
ulate the continuity equation to insert a pressure correction.
 
A second diffi culty in Eqs. (8.102b and c) is the presence of nonlinear convective 
accelerations such as u(≠u/≠x), which creates asymmetry in viscous fl ows. Early 
attempts, which modeled such terms with a central difference, led to numerical insta-
bility. The remedy is to relate convection fi nite differences solely to the upwind fl ow 
entering the cell, ignoring the downwind cell. For example, the derivative ≠u/≠x could 
be modeled, for a given cell, as (uupwind 2 ucell)/Dx. Such improvements have made 
fully viscous CFD an effective tool, with various commercial user-friendly codes 
available. For details beyond our scope, see Refs. 20 and 23 to 27.
 
Mesh generation and gridding have also become quite refi ned in modern CFD.

66(MOD) hydrofoil [28]. The gridding in Fig. 8.36a is of the C type, which wraps 
around the leading edge and trails off behind the foil, thus capturing the important 
near-wall and wake details without wasting nodes in front or to the sides. The grid 
size is 262 by 91.
 
The CFD model for this hydrofoil fl ow is also quite sophisticated: a full 
Navier-Stokes solver with turbulence modeling [29] and allowance for cavitation 
bubble formation when surface pressures drop below the local vapor pressure. Figure 
8.36b compares computed and experimental surface pressure coeffi cients for an 
angle of attack of 18. The dimensionless pressure coeffi cient is defi ned as 
Cp 5 ( psurface 2 p∞)/(ρV∞
2/2). The agreement is excellent, as indeed it is also for cases 
where the hydrofoil cavitates [28]. Clearly, when properly implemented for the proper 
fl ow cases, CFD can be an extremely effective tool for engineers.
Commercial CFD Codes
 
The arrival of the third millennium has seen an enormous emphasis on computer 
applications in nearly every fi eld, fl uid mechanics being a prime example. It is now 
possible, at least for moderately complex geometries and fl ow patterns, to model on a 
computer, approximately, the equations of motion of fl uid fl ow, with dedicated CFD 
textbooks available [5, 20, 23 to 27]. The fl ow region is broken into a fi ne grid of 
elements and nodes, which algebraically simulate the basic partial differential equations 
of fl ow. While simple two-dimensional fl ow simulations have long been reported and 
can be programmed as student exercises, three-dimensional fl ows, involving thousands 
or even millions of grid points, are now solvable with the modern supercomputer.
 
Although elementary computer modeling was treated briefl y here, the general 
topic of CFD is essentially for advanced study or professional practice. The big 
change over the past decade is that engineers, rather than laboriously programming 
CFD problems themselves, can now take advantage of any of several commercial 
CFD codes. These extensive software packages allow engineers to construct a 
geometry and boundary conditions to simulate a given viscous fl ow problem. The 
software then grids the fl ow region and attempts to compute fl ow properties at 
each grid element. The convenience is great; the danger is also great. That is, 
computations are not merely automatic, like when using a hand calculator, but 
rather require care and concern from the user. Convergence and accuracy are real 
problems for the modeler. Use of the codes requires some art and experience. In 
particular, when the fl ow Reynolds number, Re 5 ρVL/μ, goes from moderate 
(laminar fl ow) to high (turbulent fl ow), the accuracy of the simulation is no longer 
assured in any real sense. The reason is that turbulent fl ows are not completely 
resolved by the full equations of motion, and one resorts to using approximate 
turbulence models.
 
Turbulence models [29] are developed for particular geometries and fl ow condi-
tions and may be inaccurate or unrealistic for others. This is discussed by Freitas [30], 
who compared eight different commercial code calculations (FLOW-3D, FLOTRAN, 
STAR-CD, N3S, CFD-ACE, FLUENT, CFDS-FLOW3D, and NISA/3D-FLUID) with 
experimental results for fi ve benchmark fl ow experiments. Calculations were made by 
the vendors themselves. Freitas concludes that commercial codes, though promising 
in general, can be inaccurate for certain laminar and turbulent fl ow situations. Recent 
modifi cations to the standard turbulence models have improved their accuracy and 
reliability, as shown by Elkhoury [47].

Problems 577
 
An example of erratic CFD results has already been mentioned here, namely, the 
drag and lift of a rotating cylinder, Fig. 8.15. Perhaps because the fl ow itself is physi-
cally unstable [41, 44], results computed by different workers are strikingly different: 
Some predicted forces are high, some low, some increase, some decrease.
 
In spite of this warning to treat CFD codes with care, one should also realize that 
the results of a given CFD simulation can be spectacular. Figure 8.37 illustrates tur-
bulent fl ow past a cube mounted on the fl oor of a channel whose clearance is twice 
the cube height. Compare Fig. 8.37a, a top view of the experimental surface fl ow [31] 
as visualized by oil streaks, with Fig. 8.37b, a CFD supercomputer result using the 
method of large-eddy simulation [32, 33]. The agreement is remarkable. The C-shaped 
fl ow pattern in front of the cube is caused by formation of a horseshoe vortex, as seen 
in a side view of the experiment [31] in Fig. 8.37c. Horseshoe vortices commonly 
result when surface shear fl ows meet an obstacle. We conclude that CFD has a tre-
mendous potential for fl ow prediction.
Summary
 
This chapter has analyzed a highly idealized but very useful type of fl ow: inviscid, 
incompressible, irrotational fl ow, for which Laplace’s equation holds for the veloc-
ity potential (8.1) and for the plane stream function (8.7). The mathematics is well 
developed, and solutions of potential fl ows can be obtained for practically any body 
shape.
 
Some solution techniques outlined here are (1) superposition of elementary line 
or point solutions in both plane and axisymmetric fl ow, (2) the analytic functions 
of a complex variable, and (3) numerical analysis on a computer. Potential theory 
is especially useful and accurate for thin bodies such as airfoils. The only require-
ment is that the boundary layer be thin—in other words, that the Reynolds number 
be large.
 
For blunt bodies or highly divergent fl ows, potential theory serves as a fi rst approx-
imation, to be used as input to a boundary layer analysis. The reader should consult 
the advanced texts [for example, 2 to 4, 11 to 13] for further applications of potential 
theory. Section 8.9 discussed computational methods for viscous (nonpotential) fl ows.

Airfoil theory: two-dimensional
 *P8.80 The beautiful expression for lift of a two-dimensional air-
foil, Eq. (8.59), arose from applying the Joukowski trans-
formation, ζ 5 z 1 a2/z, where z 5x 1 iy and ζ 5 η 1 iβ. 
The constant a is a length scale. The theory transforms a 
certain circle in the z plane into an airfoil in the ζ plane. 
Taking a 5 1 unit for convenience, show that (a) a circle 
with center at the origin and radius . 1 will become an el-
lipse in the ζ plane and (b) a circle with center at x 5 2ε ! 
1, y 5 0, and radius (1 1 ε) will become an airfoil shape in 
the ζ plane. [Hint: The Excel spreadsheet is excellent for 
solving this problem.]
 *P8.81 Given an airplane of weight W, wing area A, aspect ratio 
AR, and fl ying at an altitude where the density is ρ. Assume 
all drag and lift is due to the wing, which has an  infi nite-span 
drag coeffi cient CD∞. Further assume suffi cient thrust to 
balance whatever drag is calculated. (a) Find an algebraic 
expression for the best cruise velocity Vb, which occurs 
when the ratio of drag to speed is a minimum. (b) Apply 
your formula to the data in Prob. P7.119 for which a labori-
ous graphing procedure gave an answer Vb < 180 m/s.
P8.82 The ultralight plane Gossamer Condor in 1977 was the fi rst 
to complete the Kremer Prize fi gure-eight course under hu-
man power. Its wingspan was 29 m, with Cav 5 2.3 m and a 
total mass of 95 kg. The drag coeffi cient was approximately 
0.05. The pilot was able to deliver 1
4 hp to propel the plane. 
Assuming two-dimensional fl ow at sea level, estimate 
(a) the cruise speed attained, (b) the lift coeffi cient, and 
(c) the horsepower required to achieve a speed of 15 kn.
P8.83 The world’s largest airplane, the Airbus A380, has a maxi-
mum weight of 1,200,000 lbf, wing area of 9100 ft2, wing-
span of 262 ft, and CDo 5 0.026. When cruising at 
maximum weight at 35,000 ft, the four engines each pro-
vide 70,000 lbf of thrust. Assuming all lift and drag are due 
to the wing, estimate the cruise velocity, in mi/h.
P8.84 Reference 12 contains inviscid theory calculations for the 
upper and lower surface velocity distributions V(x) over an 
airfoil, where x is the chordwise coordinate. A typical re-
sult for small angle of attack is as follows:

Airfoil theory: fi nite-span wings
P8.85 A wing of 2 percent camber, 5-in chord, and 30-in span is 
tested at a certain angle of attack in a wind tunnel with sea-
level standard air at 200 ft/s and is found to have lift of 30 lbf 
and drag of 1.5 lbf. Estimate from wing theory (a) the angle of 
attack, (b) the minimum drag of the wing and the angle of at-
tack at which it occurs, and (c) the maximum lift-to-drag ratio.
P8.86 An airplane has a mass of 20,000 kg and fl ies at 175 m/s at 
5000-m standard altitude. Its rectangular wing has a 3-m chord

wing span, (b) the aspect ratio, and (c) the induced drag.
P8.87 A freshwater boat of mass 400 kg is supported by a rectan-
gular hydrofoil of aspect ratio 8, 2 percent camber, and

CD∞ 5 0.01, and (c) the top speed if the boat is refi tted with

(a) the aspect ratio, (b) the lift coeffi cient, (c) the cruise Mach 
number, and (d) the engine thrust needed when cruising.

delivers 300 hp to the air. Assume for this problem that its 
airfoil is the NACA 2412 section described in Figs. 8.23

appropriate aspect ratio for the wing?
P8.90 NASA is developing a swing-wing airplane called the Bird

P8.93 The Rankine half-body of revolution (Fig. 8.30) could sim-

Did you know that you can solve simple fl uid mechanics 
problems with Microsoft Excel? The successive relaxation 
technique for solving the Laplace equation for potential 
fl ow problems is easily set up on a spreadsheet, since the 
stream function at each interior cell is simply the average of 
its four neighbors. As an example, solve for the irrotational 
potential fl ow through a contraction, as given in Fig. C8.1. 
Note: To avoid the “circular reference” error, you must turn 
on the iteration option. Use the help index for more informa-

xi, for i 5 1 to N. The object is to fi nd the correct distribution 
of strengths that approximates a given body shape y(x) at a fi -
nite number of surface locations and then to compute the ap-
proximate surface velocity and pressure. The technique should 
work for either two-dimensional bodies (distributed line 
sources) or bodies of revolution (distributed point sources).

 For our body shape let us select the NACA 0018 airfoil, 
given by the formula in Prob. P8.114 with tmax 5 0.18. 
Develop the ideas stated here into N simultaneous alge-
braic equations that can be used to solve for the N  unknown 
line source/sink strengths. Then program your equations 
for a computer, with N $ 20; solve for mi; compute the 
surface velocities; and compare with the theoretical 
 velocities for this shape in Ref. 12. Your goal should be to 
achieve accuracy within 61 percent of the classic results. 
If necessary, you should adjust N and the locations of the 
sources.
D8.2 
Modify Prob. D8.1 to solve for the point-source distribu-
tion that approximates an “0018” body-of-revolution 
shape. Since no theoretical results are published, simply 
make sure that your results converge to 61 percent.
D8.3 
Consider water at 208C fl owing at 12 m/s in a water chan-
nel. A Rankine oval cylinder, 40 cm long, is to be placed 
parallel to the fl ow, where the water static pressure is 120 
kPa. The oval’s thickness is a design parameter. Prepare a 
plot of the minimum pressure on the oval’s surface as a 
function of body thickness. Especially note the thicknesses 
where (a) the local pressure is 50 kPa and (b) cavitation 
fi rst occurs on the surface.

Ever since the demise of the Concorde, engineers have been working on the design of an 
overland supersonic airplane. For such airplanes to be practical, sonic booms must be reduced 
to an acceptable level. Theory, though useful, cannot solve this problem without extensive 
testing. Shown here is Boeing’s Lynx design, being tested in NASA’s Glenn Research Center 
in Cleveland. Sensors capture both the forces on the plane and the pressures far from the 
vehicle. The goal is to generate sonic booms so low that they barely register on the ground.

Chapter 9
Compressible Flow
Motivation. All eight of our previous chapters have been concerned with “low-speed” 
or “incompressible” fl ow, where the fl uid velocity is much less than its speed of 
sound. In fact, we did not even develop an expression for the speed of sound of a 
fl uid. That is done in this chapter.
 
When a fl uid moves at speeds comparable to its speed of sound, density changes 
become signifi cant and the fl ow is termed compressible. Such fl ows are diffi cult to 
obtain in liquids, since high pressures on the order of 1000 atm are needed to generate 
sonic velocities. In gases, however, a pressure ratio of only 2:1 will likely cause sonic 
fl ow. Thus compressible gas fl ow is quite common, and this subject is often called 
gas dynamics. The most important parameter is the Mach number.
 
Probably the two most important and distinctive effects of compressibility on fl ow 
are (1) choking, wherein the duct fl ow rate is sharply limited by the sonic condition, 
and (2) shock waves, which are nearly discontinuous property changes in a supersonic 
fl ow. The purpose of this chapter is to explain such striking phenomena and to famil-
iarize the reader with engineering calculations of compressible fl ow.
 
Speaking of calculations, the present chapter can use the help of Excel. Com-
pressible fl ow analysis is fi lled with scores of complicated algebraic equations, many 
of which are diffi cult to manipulate or invert. Consequently, for nearly a century, 
compressible fl ow textbooks have relied on extensive tables of Mach number rela-
tions (see App. B) for numerical work. With Excel, however, any equation in this 
chapter can be typed into a cell and iterated to solve for any variables—see part 
(b) of Example 9.13 for an especially intricate example. With such a tool, App. B 
serves only as a backup, for initial estimates, and may soon vanish from 
textbooks.
9.1 Introduction: 
Review of Thermodynamics
 
We took a brief look in Chap. 4 [Eqs. (4.13) to (4.17)] to see when we might safely 
neglect the compressibility inherent in every real fl uid. We found that the proper 
criterion for a nearly incompressible fl ow was a small Mach number
Ma 5 V
a ! 1

594 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
where V is the fl ow velocity and a is the speed of sound of the fl uid. Under small 
Mach number conditions, changes in fl uid density are everywhere small in the fl ow 
fi eld. The energy equation becomes uncoupled, and temperature effects can be either 
ignored or put aside for later study. The equation of state degenerates into the simple 
statement that density is nearly constant. This means that an incompressible fl ow 
requires only a momentum and continuity analysis, as we showed with many examples 
in Chaps. 7 and 8.
 
This chapter treats compressible fl ows, which have Mach numbers greater than about 
0.3 and thus exhibit nonnegligible density changes. If the density change is signifi cant, it 
follows from the equation of state that the temperature and pressure changes are also 
substantial. Large temperature changes imply that the energy equation can no longer be 
neglected. Therefore, the work is doubled from two basic equations to four
1. Continuity equation
2. Momentum equation
3. Energy equation
4. Equation of state
to be solved simultaneously for four unknowns: pressure, density, temperature, and 
fl ow velocity (p, ρ, T, V). Thus the general theory of compressible fl ow is quite 
complicated, and we try here to make further simplifi cations, especially by assuming 
a reversible adiabatic or isentropic fl ow.
 
We note in passing that at least two fl ow patterns depend strongly on very small 
density differences, acoustics, and natural convection. Acoustics [7, 9] is the study of 
sound wave propagation, which is accompanied by extremely small changes in den-
sity, pressure, and temperature. Natural convection is the gentle circulating pattern set 
up by buoyancy forces in a fl uid stratifi ed by uneven heating or uneven concentration 
of dissolved materials. Here we are concerned only with steady compressible fl ow 
where the fl uid velocity is of magnitude comparable to that of the speed of sound.
The Mach Number
 
The Mach number is the dominant parameter in compressible fl ow analysis, with dif-
ferent effects depending on its magnitude. Aerodynamicists especially make a distinc-
tion between the various ranges of Mach number, and the following rough classifi cations 
are commonly used:
 
Ma , 0.3:  incompressible fl ow, where density effects are negligible.
 0.3 , Ma , 0.8:  subsonic fl ow, where density effects are important but no 
shock waves appear.
 0.8 , Ma , 1.2:  transonic fl ow, where shock waves fi rst appear, dividing 
subsonic and supersonic regions of the fl ow. Powered 
fl ight in the transonic region is diffi cult because of the 
mixed character of the fl ow fi eld.
 1.2 , Ma , 3.0:  supersonic fl ow, where shock waves are present but there 
are no subsonic regions.
 
3.0 , Ma:  hypersonic fl ow [11], where shock waves and other fl ow 
changes are especially strong.

9.1  Introduction: Review of Thermodynamics  595
The numerical values listed are only rough guides. These fi ve categories of fl ow are 
appropriate to external high-speed aerodynamics. For internal (duct) fl ows, the most 
important question is simply whether the fl ow is subsonic (Ma , 1) or supersonic 
(Ma . 1), because the effect of area changes reverses, as we show in Sec. 9.4. Since 
supersonic fl ow effects may go against intuition, you should study these differences 
carefully.
The Specifi c-Heat Ratio
 
In addition to geometry and Mach number, compressible fl ow calculations also depend 
on a second dimensionless parameter, the specifi c-heat ratio of the gas:
 
k 5
cp
cυ
 
(9.1)
Earlier, in Chaps. 1 and 4, we used the same symbol k to denote the thermal conduc-
tivity of a fl uid. We apologize for the duplication; thermal conductivity does not 
appear in these later chapters of the text.
 
Recall from Fig. 1.4 that k for the common gases decreases slowly with tempera-
ture and lies between 1.0 and 1.7. Variations in k have only a slight effect on com-
pressible fl ow computations, and air, k < 1.40, is the dominant fl uid of interest. 
Therefore, although we assign some problems involving other gases like steam and 
CO2 and helium, the compressible fl ow tables in App. B are based solely on the single 
value k 5 1.40 for air.
 
This text contains only a single chapter on compressible fl ow, but, as usual, whole 
books have been written on the subject. Here we list only certain recent or classic 
texts. References 1 to 4 are introductory or intermediate treatments, while Refs. 5 to 
10 are advanced books. One can also become specialized within this specialty of 
compressible fl ow. Reference 11 concerns hypersonic fl ow—that is, at very high Mach 
numbers. Reference 12 explains the exciting new technique of direct simulation of 
gas fl ows with a molecular dynamics model. Compressible fl ow is also well suited 
for computational fl uid dynamics (CFD), as described in Ref. 13. Finally, a short, 
thoroughly readable (no calculus) Ref. 14 describes the principles and promise of 
high-speed (supersonic) fl ight. From time to time we shall defer some specialized 
topic to these other texts.
The Perfect Gas
 
In principle, compressible fl ow calculations can be made for any fl uid equation of 
state, and we shall assign a few problems involving the steam tables [15], the gas 
tables [16], and liquids [Eq. (1.19)]. But in fact most elementary treatments are 
 confi ned to the perfect gas with constant specifi c heats:
 
p 5 ρRT   R 5 cp 2 cυ 5 const   k 5
cp
cυ
5 const 
(9.2)
For all real gases, cp, cυ, and k vary with temperature but only moderately; for exam-
ple, cp of air increases 30 percent as temperature increases from 0 to 50008F. Since 
we rarely deal with such large temperature changes, it is quite reasonable to assume 
constant specifi c heats.

596 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
 
Recall from Sec. 1.8 that the gas constant is related to a universal constant Λ 
divided by the gas molecular weight:
 
Rgas 5

(9.3)
where 
¶ 5 49,720 ft-lbf/(lbmol # °R) 5 8314 J/(kmol # K)
For air, M 5 28.97, and we shall adopt the following property values for air through-
out this chapter:
R 5 1716 ft2/(s2 # °R) 5 287 m2/(s2 # K)   k 5 1.400

k 2 1 5 6009 ft2/(s2 # °R) 5 1005 m2/(s2 # K)
Experimental values of k for eight common gases were shown in Fig. 1.4. From 
this fi gure and the molecular weight, the other properties can be computed, as in 
Eqs. (9.4).
 
The changes in the internal energy û and enthalpy h of a perfect gas are computed 
for constant specifi c heats as
 
û2 2 û1 5 cυ(T2 2 T1)    h2 2 h1 5 cp(T2 2 T1) 
(9.5)
For variable specifi c heats one must integrate û 5 ecυ dT and h 5 ecp dT or use the 
gas tables [16]. Most modern thermodynamics texts now contain software for evaluat-
ing properties of nonideal gases [17].
Isentropic Process
 
The isentropic approximation is common in compressible fl ow theory. We compute 
the entropy change from the fi rst and second laws of thermodynamics for a pure 
substance [17 or 18]:
 
T ds 5 dh 2 dp
ρ  
(9.6)
Introducing dh 5 cp dT for a perfect gas and solving for ds, we substitute ρT 5 p/R 
from the perfect-gas law and obtain
 
#

ds 5 #

cp dT
T 2 R#

(9.7)
If cp is variable, the gas tables will be needed, but for constant cp we obtain the 
 analytic results
 
s2 2 s1 5 cp ln T2

p1
5 cυ ln T2

(9.8)
Equations (9.8) are used to compute the entropy change across a shock wave (Sec. 9.5), 
which is an irreversible process.

EXAMPLE 9.1
Argon fl ows through a tube such that its initial condition is p1 5 1.7 MPa and ρ1 5 18 kg/m3 
and its fi nal condition is p2 5 248 kPa and T2 5 400 K. Estimate (a) the initial tem-
perature, (b) the fi nal density, (c) the change in enthalpy, and (d ) the change in entropy 
of the gas.
Solution
From Table A.4 for argon, R 5 208 m2/(s2 # K) and k 5 1.67. Therefore estimate its specifi c 
heat at constant pressure from Eq. (9.4):
cp 5
kR
k 2 1 5 1.67(208)
1.67 2 1 < 519 m2/(s2 # K)
The initial temperature and fi nal density are estimated from the ideal-gas law, Eq. (9.2):
 
 T1 5 p1

1.7 E6 N/m2
(18 kg/m3) 3208 m2/(s2 # K) 4 5 454 K

T2R 5
248 E3 N/m2
(400 K) 3208 m2/(s2 # K) 4 5 2.98 kg/m3 
Ans. (b)
From Eq. (9.5) the enthalpy change is
 
h2 2 h1 5 cp(T2 2 T1) 5 519(400 2 454) < 228,000 J/kg (or m2/s2) 
Ans. (c)
The argon temperature and enthalpy decrease as we move down the tube. Actually, there 
may not be any external cooling; that is, the fl uid enthalpy may be converted by friction to 
increased kinetic energy (Sec. 9.7).
 
Finally, the entropy change is computed from Eq. (9.8):
 s2 2 s1 5 cp ln T2
T1
2 R ln p2
p1
 5 519 ln 400
454 2 208 ln 0.248 E6
1.7 E6
 
 5 266 1 400 < 334 m2/(s2 # K) 
Ans. (d )
The fl uid entropy has increased. If there is no heat transfer, this indicates an irreversible 
process. Note that entropy has the same units as the gas constant and specifi c heat.
 
This problem is not just arbitrary numbers. It correctly simulates the behavior of argon 
moving subsonically through a tube with large frictional effects (Sec. 9.7).

598 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
9.2 The Speed of Sound
 
The so-called speed of sound is the rate of propagation of a pressure pulse of infi ni-
tesimal strength through a still fl uid. It is a thermodynamic property of a fl uid. Let 
us analyze it by fi rst considering a pulse of fi nite strength, as in Fig. 9.1. In Fig. 9.1a 
the pulse, or pressure wave, moves at speed C toward the still fl uid (p, ρ, T, V 5 0) 
at the left, leaving behind at the right a fl uid of increased properties (p 1 Dp, ρ 1 
Dρ, T 1 DT) and a fl uid velocity DV toward the left following the wave but much 
slower. We can determine these effects by making a control volume analysis across 
the wave. To avoid the unsteady terms that would be necessary in Fig. 9.1a, we adopt 
instead the control volume of Fig. 9.1b, which moves at wave speed C to the left. 
The wave appears fi xed from this viewpoint, and the fl uid appears to have velocity 
C on the left and C 2 DV on the right. The thermodynamic properties p, ρ, and T 
are not affected by this change of viewpoint.
 
The fl ow in Fig. 9.1b is steady and one-dimensional across the wave. The continu-
ity equation is thus, from Eq. (3.24),
ρAC 5 (ρ 1 ¢ρ)(A)(C 2 ¢V)
or 
¢V 5 C 
¢ρ
ρ 1 ¢ρ 
(9.10)
This proves our contention that the induced fl uid velocity on the right is much smaller 
than the wave speed C. In the limit of infi nitesimal wave strength (sound wave) this 
speed is itself infi nitesimal.
 
Notice that there are no velocity gradients on either side of the wave. Therefore, 
even if fl uid viscosity is large, frictional effects are confi ned to the interior of the 
wave. Advanced texts [for example, 9] show that the thickness of pressure waves in

gases is of order 1026 ft at atmospheric pressure. Thus we can safely neglect friction 
and apply the one-dimensional momentum equation (3.40) across the wave:
 a Fright 5 m# (Vout 2 Vin)
or 
 pA 2 (p 1 ¢p)A 5 ( ρAC)(C 2 ¢V 2 C) 
(9.11)
Again the area cancels, and we can solve for the pressure change:
¢p 5 ρC ¢V 
(9.12)
If the wave strength is very small, the pressure change is small.
 
Finally, combine Eqs. (9.10) and (9.12) to give an expression for the wave speed:
C2 5 ¢p
¢ρ a1 1 ¢ρ
ρ b 
(9.13)
The larger the strength Dρ/ρ of the wave, the faster the wave speed; that is, powerful 
explosion waves move much more quickly than sound waves. In the limit of infi ni-
tesimal strength Dρ → 0, we have what is defi ned to be the speed of sound a of a fl uid:
 
a2 5 0p
0ρ 
(9.14)
But the evaluation of the derivative requires knowledge of the thermodynamic process 
undergone by the fl uid as the wave passes. Sir Isaac Newton in 1686 made a famous 
error by deriving a formula for sound speed that was equivalent to assuming an iso-
thermal process, the result being 20 percent too low for air, for example. He rational-
ized the discrepancy as being due to the “crassitude” (dust particles and so on) in the 
air; the error is certainly understandable when we refl ect that it was made 180 years 
before the proper basis was laid for the second law of thermodynamics.
 
We now see that the correct process must be adiabatic because there are no tem-
perature gradients except inside the wave itself. For vanishing-strength sound waves 
we therefore have an infi nitesimal adiabatic or isentropic process. The correct expres-
sion for the sound speed is

In terms of bulk modulus, then, a 5 (K/ρ)1/2. For example, at standard conditions, the 
bulk modulus of liquid carbon tetrachloride is 1.32 GPa absolute, and its density is 
1590 kg/m3. Its speed of sound is therefore a 5 (1.3 E9 Pa/1590 kg/m3)1/2 5 911 m/s 5 
2980 ft/s. Steel has a bulk modulus of about 2 E11 Pa and water about 2.2 E9 Pa (see 
Table A.3), or 90 times less than steel.
 
For solids, it is sometimes assumed that the bulk modulus is approximately equiva-
lent to Young’s modulus of elasticity E, but in fact their ratio depends on Poisson’s 
ratio σ:

The two are equal for σ 5 1

9.3 Adiabatic and Isentropic 
Steady Flow
 
As mentioned in Sec. 9.1, the isentropic approximation greatly simplifi es a compress-
ible fl ow calculation. So does the assumption of adiabatic fl ow, even if 
nonisentropic.
 
Consider high-speed fl ow of a gas past an insulated wall, as in Fig. 9.2. There is 
no shaft work delivered to any part of the fl uid. Therefore, every streamtube in the 
fl ow satisfi es the steady fl ow energy equation in the form of Eq. (3.70):
 
h1 1 1

where point 1 is upstream of point 2. You may wish to review the details of Eq. (3.70) 
and its development. We saw in Example 3.20 that potential energy changes of a

gas are extremely small compared with kinetic energy and enthalpy terms. We shall 
neglect the terms gz1 and gz2 in all gas dynamic analyses.
 
Inside the thermal and velocity boundary layers in Fig. 9.2 the heat transfer and 
viscous work terms q and wυ are not zero. But outside the boundary layer q and wυ 
are zero by defi nition, so that the outer fl ow satisfi es the simple relation
 
h1 1 1
2V2
1 5 h2 1 1
2V2
2 5 const 
(9.21)
The constant in Eq. (9.21) is equal to the maximum enthalpy that the fl uid would 
achieve if brought to rest adiabatically. We call this value h0, the stagnation enthalpy 
of the fl ow. Thus we rewrite Eq. (9.21) in the form
 
h 1 1
2V2 5 h0 5 const 
(9.22)
This should hold for steady adiabatic fl ow of any compressible fl uid outside the 
boundary layer. The wall in Fig. 9.2 could be either the surface of an immersed 
body or the wall of a duct. We have shown the details of Fig. 9.2; typically the 
thermal layer thickness δT is greater than the velocity layer thickness δV because 
most gases have a dimensionless Prandtl number Pr less than unity (see, for exam-
ple, Ref. 19, Sec. 4-3.2). Note that the stagnation enthalpy varies inside the thermal 
boundary layer, but its average value is the same as that at the outer layer due to 
the insulated wall.
 
For nonperfect gases we may have to use the steam tables [15] or the gas 
tables [16] to implement Eq. (9.22). But for a perfect gas h 5 cpT, and Eq. (9.22) 
becomes
 
cpT 1 1
2V2 5 cpT0 
(9.23)
This establishes the stagnation temperature T0 of an adiabatic perfect-gas fl ow—that 
is, the temperature it achieves when decelerated to rest adiabatically.
 
An alternate interpretation of Eq. (9.22) occurs when the enthalpy and temperature 
drop to (absolute) zero, so the velocity achieves a maximum value:
 
Vmax 5 (2h0)1/2 5 (2cpT0)1/2 
(9.24)
No higher fl ow velocity can occur unless additional energy is added to the fl uid 
through shaft work or heat transfer (Sec. 9.8).

The dimensionless form of Eq. (9.23) brings in the Mach number Ma as a param-

by cpT to obtain

This relation is plotted in Fig. 9.3 versus the Mach number for k 5 1.4. At Ma 5 5

Equation (9.27) is also plotted in Fig. 9.3. At Ma 5 5 the speed of sound has dropped 
to 41 percent of the stagnation value.
Isentropic Pressure and 
Density Relations
 
Note that Eqs. (9.26) and (9.27) require only adiabatic fl ow and hold even in the 
presence of irreversibilities such as friction losses or shock waves.

9.3  Adiabatic and Isentropic Steady Flow 603
 
If the fl ow is also isentropic, then for a perfect gas the pressure and density ratios 
can be computed from Eq. (9.9) as a power of the temperature ratio:
p0
p 5 aT0
T b
k/(k21)

T b
1/(k21)
5 c 1 1 1
2 (k 2 1)Ma2 d

(9.28b)
These relations are also plotted in Fig. 9.3; at Ma 5 5 the density is 1.13 percent of 
its stagnation value, and the pressure is only 0.19 percent of stagnation pressure.
 
The quantities p0 and ρ0 are the isentropic stagnation pressure and density, 
respectively that is, the pressure and density that the fl ow would achieve if brought 
isentropically to rest. In an adiabatic nonisentropic fl ow p0 and ρ0 retain their local 
meaning, but they vary throughout the fl ow as the entropy changes due to friction 
or shock waves. The quantities h0, T0, and a0 are constant in an adiabatic nonisen-
tropic fl ow (see Sec. 9.7 for further details).
Relationship to Bernoulli’s 
Equation
 
The isentropic assumptions (9.28) are effective, but are they realistic? Yes. To see 
why, take the differential of Eq. (9.22):
Adiabatic: 
dh 1 V dV 5 0 
(9.29)
Meanwhile, from Eq. (9.6), if ds 5 0 (isentropic process),
dh 5 dp
ρ  
(9.30)
Combining (9.29) and (9.30), we fi nd that an isentropic streamtube fl ow must be
dp
ρ 1 V dV 5 0 
(9.31)
But this is exactly the Bernoulli relation, Eq. (3.54), for steady frictionless fl ow with 
negligible gravity terms. Thus we see that the isentropic fl ow assumption is equivalent 
to use of the Bernoulli or streamline form of the frictionless momentum equation.
Critical Values at the Sonic Point  
The stagnation values (a0, T0, p0, ρ0) are useful reference conditions in a compressible 
fl ow, but of comparable usefulness are the conditions where the fl ow is sonic, Ma 5
1.0. These sonic, or critical, properties are denoted by asterisks: p*, ρ*, a*, and T*. 
They are certain ratios of the stagnation properties as given by Eqs. (9.26) to (9.28)

In all isentropic fl ow, all critical properties are constant; in adiabatic nonisentropic 
fl ow, a* and T* are constant, but p* and ρ* may vary.
 
The critical velocity V* equals the sonic sound speed a* by defi nition and is often 
used as a reference velocity in isentropic or adiabatic fl ow:

The usefulness of these critical values will become clearer as we study compressible

Some Useful Numbers for Air
 
Since the great bulk of our practical calculations are for air, k 5 1.4, the stagnation 
property ratios p/p0 and so on from Eqs. (9.26) to (9.28) are tabulated for this value 
in Table B.1. The increments in Mach number are rather coarse in this table because 
the values are meant as only a guide; these equations are now a trivial matter to 
manipulate on a hand calculator. Thirty years ago every text had extensive compress-
ible fl ow tables with Mach number spacings of about 0.01, so that accurate values 
could be interpolated. Even today, reference books are available [20, 21, 29] with 
tables and charts and computer programs for a wide variety of compressible fl ow situ-
ations. Reference 22 contains formulas and charts applying to the thermodynamics of 
real (nonperfect) gas fl ows.
 
For k 5 1.4, the following numerical versions of the isentropic and adiabatic fl ow 
formulas are obtained:
 
T0
T 5 1 1 0.2 Ma2     ρ0
ρ 5 (1 1 0.2 Ma2)2.5 
(9.34)
p0
p 5 (1 1 0.2 Ma2)3.5
Or, if we are given the properties, it is equally easy to solve for the Mach number 
(again with k 5 1.4):
 
Ma2 5 5aT0
T 2 1b 5 5c aρ0
ρ b
2/5
2 1d 5 5c ap0
p b
2/7
2 1d  
(9.35)
Note that these isentropic flow formulas serve as the equivalent of the friction-
less adiabatic momentum and energy equations. They relate velocity to physical 
properties for a perfect gas, but they are not the “solution” to a gas dynamics 
problem. The complete solution is not obtained until the continuity equation has 
also been satisfied, for either one-dimensional (Sec. 9.4) or multidimensional 
(Sec. 9.9) flow.
 
One fi nal note: These isentropic-ratio–versus–Mach-number formulas are seduc-
tive, tempting one to solve all problems by jumping right into the tables. Actually, 
many problems involving (dimensional) velocity and temperature can be solved more 
easily from the original raw dimensional energy equation (9.23) plus the perfect-gas 
law (9.2), as the next example will illustrate.

EXAMPLE 9.3
Air fl ows adiabatically through a duct. At point 1 the velocity is 240 m/s, with T1 5 320 K

point 2 further downstream V2 5 290 m/s and p2 5 135 kPa. (g) What is the stagnation 
 pressure p02?
Solution
• Assumptions: Let air be approximated as an ideal gas with constant k. The fl ow is 
 adiabatic but not isentropic. Isentropic formulas are used only to compute local p0 and ρ0, 
which vary.
• Approach: Use adiabatic and isentropic formulas to fi nd the various properties.
• Ideal gas parameters: For air, R 5 287 m2/(s2 ? K), k 5 1.40, and cp 5 1005 m2/(s2 ? K).

• Comments: Part (g), a ratio-type ideal-gas formula, is more direct than fi nding the 
Mach number, which turns out to be Ma2 5 0.83, and using the Mach number formula, 
Eq. (9.34) for p02. Note that p02 is 8 percent less than p01. The fl ow is nonisentropic: 
Entropy rises downstream, and stagnation pressure and density drop, due in this case to 
frictional losses.
9.4 Isentropic Flow with 
Area Changes
 
By combining the isentropic and/or adiabatic fl ow relations with the equation of con-
tinuity we can study practical compressible fl ow problems. This section treats the 
one-dimensional fl ow approximation.
 
Figure 9.4 illustrates the one-dimensional fl ow assumption. A real fl ow, Fig. 9.4a, 
has no slip at the walls and a velocity profi le V(x, y) that varies across the duct sec-
tion (compare with Fig. 7.8). If, however, the area change is small and the wall radius 
of curvature large
 
db
dx ! 1    b(x) ! R(x) 
(9.36)
then the fl ow is approximately one-dimensional, as in Fig. 9.4b, with V < V(x) 
reacting to area change A(x). Compressible fl ow nozzles and diffusers do not always 
satisfy conditions (9.36), but we use the one-dimensional theory anyway because of 
its simplicity.
 
For steady one-dimensional fl ow the equation of continuity is, from Eq. (3.24),
 
ρ(x)V(x)A(x) 5 m# 5 const 
(9.37)
Before applying this to duct theory, we can learn a lot from the differential form of 
Eq. (9.37):
 
dρ

Ma2 2 1 5 2 dp

(9.40)
Inspection of this equation, without actually solving it, reveals a fascinating aspect of 
compressible fl ow: Property changes are of opposite sign for subsonic and supersonic 
fl ow because of the term Ma2 2 1. There are four combinations of area change and 
Mach number, summarized in Fig. 9.5.
 
From earlier chapters we are used to subsonic behavior (Ma , 1): When area 
increases, velocity decreases and pressure increases, which is denoted a subsonic dif-
fuser. But in supersonic fl ow (Ma . 1), the velocity actually increases when the area 
increases, a supersonic nozzle. The same opposing behavior occurs for an area 
decrease, which speeds up a subsonic fl ow and slows down a supersonic fl ow.
 
What about the sonic point Ma 5 1? Since infi nite acceleration is physically impos-
sible, Eq. (9.40) indicates that dV can be fi nite only when dA 5 0—that is, a minimum 
area (throat) or a maximum area (bulge). In Fig. 9.6 we patch together a throat section 
and a bulge section, using the rules from Fig. 9.5. The throat or converging–diverging 
section can smoothly accelerate a subsonic fl ow through sonic to supersonic fl ow, as 
in Fig. 9.6a. This is the only way a supersonic fl ow can be created by expanding the 
gas from a stagnant reservoir. The bulge section fails; the bulge Mach number moves 
away from a sonic condition rather than toward it.
 
Although supersonic fl ow downstream of a nozzle requires a sonic throat, the opposite 
is not true: A compressible gas can pass through a throat section without becoming sonic.

Perfect-Gas Area Change
 
We can use the perfect-gas and isentropic fl ow relations to convert the continuity 
relation (9.37) into an algebraic expression involving only area and Mach number, as 
follows. Equate the mass fl ow at any section to the mass fl ow under sonic conditions

Fig. 9.6 From Eq. (9.40), in fl ow

the bulge (b) the fl ow at the bulge 
cannot be sonic on physical grounds.

9.4  Isentropic Flow with Area Changes  609
 
Figure 9.7 shows that the minimum area that can occur in a given isentropic duct 
fl ow is the sonic, or critical, throat area. All other duct sections must have A greater 
than A*. In many fl ows a critical sonic throat is not actually present, and the fl ow in 
the duct is either entirely subsonic or, more rarely, entirely supersonic.
Choking
 
From Eq. (9.41) the inverse ratio A*/A equals ρV/(ρ*V*), the mass fl ow per unit area 
at any section compared with the critical mass fl ow per unit area. From Fig. 9.7 this 
inverse ratio rises from zero at Ma 5 0 to unity at Ma 5 1 and back down to zero at 
large Ma. Thus, for given stagnation conditions, the maximum possible mass fl ow 
passes through a duct when its throat is at the critical or sonic condition. The duct is 
then said to be choked and can carry no additional mass fl ow unless the throat is wid-
ened. If the throat is constricted further, the mass fl ow through the duct must decrease.
 
From Eqs. (9.32) and (9.33) the maximum mass fl ow is

For isentropic fl ow through a duct, the maximum mass fl ow possible is proportional 
to the throat area and stagnation pressure and inversely proportional to the square root 
of the stagnation temperature. These are somewhat abstract facts, so let us illustrate 
with some examples.

The Local Mass Flow Function
 
Equations (9.46) give the maximum mass fl ow, which occurs at the choking condition 
(sonic exit). They can be modifi ed to predict the actual (nonmaximum) mass fl ow at 
any section where local area A and pressure p are known.1 The algebra is convoluted, 
so here we give only the fi nal result, expressed in dimensionless form:

(9.47)
We stress that p and A in this relation are the local values at position x. As p/p0 falls, 
this function rises rapidly and then levels out at the maximum of Eqs. (9.46). A few 
values may be tabulated here for k 5 1.4:

0.6769 
0.6847
Equation (9.47) is handy if stagnation conditions are known and the fl ow is not choked.
 
When A/A* is known and the Mach number is unknown, no algebraic solution of 
Eq. (9.44) is known to the writer. One could interpolate in Table B.1 or simply iterate 
Eq. (9.44) with a calculator. But Excel can iterate Eq. (9.44) for subsonic fl ow in its 
direct form:
 
Subsonic flow: Ma 5 A*
A c 1 1 0.5(k 2 1)Ma2
0.5(k 1 1)
d
0.5(k11)/(k21)
 
(9.48)
Make a subsonic guess for Ma on the right side and then replace it with the value 
calculated on the left side. For example, suppose A/A* 5 2.035, corresponding to Ma 5
0.300. A poor guess of Ma 5 0.5 in Eq. (9.44) leads to a better Ma 5 0.329, then 
0.303, then 0.300.
 
For supersonic fl ow, iteration of Eq. (9.44) diverges. Instead, simply try different 
Mach numbers in Eq. (9.44) until the proper area is achieved. For example, suppose 
A/A* 5 3.183, corresponding to Ma 5 2.70. A poor guess of Ma 5 2.4 yields A/A* 5
2.403, 24 percent low. Improve the guess to Ma 5 2.8 to give A/A* 5 3.500, or 10 
percent high. Interpolate to Ma 5 2.72, A/A* 5 3.244, 2 percent high. Finally settle 
on Ma 5 2.70, correct. These calculations simply require that you retype your guess 
for Ma, check the error, and convergence only depends upon your cleverness.
 
Note that two solutions are possible for a given A/A*, one subsonic and one super-
sonic. The proper solution cannot be selected without further information, such as 
known pressure or temperature at the given duct section.
EXAMPLE 9.4
Air fl ows isentropically through a duct. At section 1 the area is 0.05 m2 and V1 5 180 m/s, 
p1 5 500 kPa, and T1 5 470 K. Compute (a) T0, (b) Ma1, (c) p0, and (d ) both A* and m# .
If at section 2 the area is 0.036 m2, compute Ma2 and p2 if the fl ow is (e) subsonic or 
(f ) supersonic. Assume k 5 1.4.

This throat must actually be present in the duct if the fl ow is to become supersonic.
 
We now know A*. So to compute the mass fl ow we can use Eqs. (9.46), which remain 
valid, based on the numerical value of A*, whether or not a throat actually exists:

Or we could fare equally well with our new “local mass fl ow” formula, Eq. (9.47), using, 
say, the pressure and area at section 1. Given p1/p0 5 500/563 5 0.889, Eq. (9.47) yields

For supersonic fl ow at section 2F, again the area ratio is 0.036/0.0323 5 1.115. On the right

Note that the supersonic-fl ow pressure level is much less than p2 in part (e), and a sonic 
throat must have occurred between sections 1 and 2F.
EXAMPLE 9.5
It is desired to expand air from p0 5 200 kPa and T0 5 500 K through a throat to an exit 
Mach number of 2.5. If the desired mass fl ow is 3 kg/s, compute (a) the throat area and the 
exit (b) pressure, (c) temperature, (d ) velocity, and (e) area, assuming isentropic fl ow, with 
k 5 1.4.

9.5  The Normal Shock Wave 613

One point might be noted: The computation of the throat area A* did not depend in any 
way on the numerical value of the exit Mach number. The exit was supersonic; therefore 
the throat is sonic and choked, and no further information is needed.
9.5 The Normal Shock Wave
 
Shock waves are nearly discontinuous changes in a supersonic fl ow. They can occur 
due to a higher downstream pressure, a sudden change in fl ow direction, blockage by 
a downstream body, or the result of an explosion. The simplest algebraically is a 
one-dimensional change, or normal shock wave, shown in Fig. 9.8. We select a control 
volume just before and after the wave.
 
The analysis is identical to that of Fig. 9.1; that is, a shock wave is a fi xed strong 
pressure wave. To compute all property changes rather than just the wave speed, we 
use all our basic one-dimensional steady fl ow relations, letting section 1 be upstream 
and section 2 be downstream:

614 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Note that we have canceled out the areas A1 < A2, which is justifi ed even in a vari-
able duct section because of the thinness of the wave. The fi rst successful analyses 
of these normal shock relations are credited to W. J. M. Rankine (1870) and 
A. Hugoniot (1887), hence the modern term Rankine-Hugoniot relations. If we assume 
that the upstream conditions (p1, V1, ρ1, h1, T1) are known, Eqs. (9.49) are fi ve alge-
braic relations in the fi ve unknowns (p2, V2, ρ2, h2, T2). Because of the velocity-
squared term, two solutions are found, and the correct one is determined from the 
second law of thermodynamics, which requires that s2 . s1.
 
The velocities V1 and V2 can be eliminated from Eqs. (9.49a) to (9.49c) to obtain 
the Rankine-Hugoniot relation:
 
h2 2 h1 5 1
2 ( p2 2 p1) a 1
ρ2
1 1
ρ1

(9.50)
This contains only thermodynamic properties and is independent of the equation of 
state. Introducing the perfect-gas law h 5 cpT 5 kp/[(k 2 1)ρ], we can rewrite this as
 
ρ2
ρ1
5 1 1 βp2/p1
β 1 p2/p1     β 5 k 1 1

We can compare this with the isentropic fl ow relation for a very weak pressure wave 
in a perfect gas:

9.5  The Normal Shock Wave 615
We see that the entropy change is negative if the pressure decreases across the 
shock, which violates the second law. Thus a rarefaction shock is impossible in 
a perfect gas.2 We see also that weak shock waves (p2/p1 # 2.0) are very nearly 
isentropic.
Mach Number Relations
 
For a perfect gas all the property ratios across the normal shock are unique functions 
of k and the upstream Mach number Ma1. For example, if we eliminate ρ2 and V2
from Eqs. (9.49a) to (9.49c) and introduce h 5 kp/[(k 2 1)ρ], we obtain

(9.55)
From this equation we see that, for any k, p2 . p1 only if Ma1 . 1.0. Thus for fl ow 
through a normal shock wave, the upstream Mach number must be supersonic to 
satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.
 
What about the downstream Mach number? From the perfect-gas identity ρV2 5 
kp Ma2, we can rewrite Eq. (9.49b) as
 
p2
p1
5 1 1 k Ma1
2
1 1 k Ma2
2 
(9.56)
which relates the pressure ratio to both Mach numbers. By equating Eqs. (9.55) and 
(9.56) we can solve for
 
Ma2
2 5 (k 2 1) Ma1
2 1 2
2k Ma1
2 2 (k 2 1)  
(9.57)
Since Ma1 must be supersonic, this equation predicts for all k . 1 that Ma2 must be 
subsonic. Thus a normal shock wave decelerates a fl ow almost discontinuously from 
supersonic to subsonic conditions.

All these relations are given in Table B.2 and plotted versus upstream Mach number 
Ma1 in Fig. 9.9 for k 5 1.4. We see that pressure increases greatly while temperature 
and density increase moderately. The effective throat area A* increases slowly at fi rst 
and then rapidly. The failure of students to account for this change in A* is a common 
source of error in shock calculations.
 
The stagnation temperature remains the same, but the stagnation pressure and den-
sity decrease in the same ratio; in other words, the fl ow across the shock is adiabatic 
but nonisentropic. Other basic principles governing the behavior of shock waves can

9.5  The Normal Shock Wave 617
be summarized as follows:
1. The upstream fl ow is supersonic, and the downstream fl ow is subsonic.
2. For perfect gases (and also for real fl uids except under bizarre thermodynamic 
conditions) rarefaction shocks are impossible, and only a compression shock 
can exist.
3. The entropy increases across a shock with consequent decreases in stagnation 
pressure and stagnation density and an increase in the effective sonic throat area.
4. Weak shock waves are very nearly isentropic.
Normal shock waves form in ducts under transient conditions, such as in shock tubes, 
and in steady fl ow for certain ranges of the downstream pressure. Figure 9.10a shows 
a normal shock in a supersonic nozzle. Flow is from left to right. The oblique wave 
pattern to the left is formed by roughness elements on the nozzle walls and indicates

that the upstream fl ow is supersonic. Note the absence of these Mach waves (see 
Sec. 9.10) in the subsonic fl ow downstream.
 
Normal shock waves occur not only in supersonic duct fl ows but also in a variety 
of supersonic external fl ows. An example is the supersonic fl ow past a blunt body 
shown in Fig. 9.10b. The bow shock is curved, with a portion in front of the body 
that is essentially normal to the oncoming fl ow. This normal portion of the bow shock 
satisfi es the property change conditions just as outlined in this section. The fl ow inside 
the shock near the body nose is thus subsonic and at relatively high temperature T2 . 
T1, and convective heat transfer is especially high in this region.
 
Each nonnormal portion of the bow shock in Fig. 9.10b satisfi es the oblique shock 
relations to be outlined in Sec. 9.9. Note also the oblique recompression shock on the 
sides of the body. What has happened is that the subsonic nose fl ow has accelerated 
around the corners back to supersonic fl ow at low pressure, which must then pass 
through the second shock to match the higher downstream pressure conditions.
 
Note the fi ne-grained turbulent wake structure in the rear of the body in Fig. 9.10b. 
The turbulent boundary layer along the sides of the body is also clearly visible.
 
The analysis of a complex multidimensional supersonic fl ow such as in Fig. 9.10 
is beyond the scope of this book. For further information see, for example, Ref. 9, 
Chap. 9, or Ref. 5, Chap. 16.
Moving Normal Shocks
 
The preceding analysis of the fi xed shock applies equally well to the moving shock 
if we reverse the transformation used in Fig. 9.1. To make the upstream conditions 
simulate a still fl uid, we move the shock of Fig. 9.8 to the left at speed V1; that is, 
we fi x our coordinates to a control volume moving with the shock. The downstream 
fl ow then appears to move to the left at a slower speed V1 2 V2 following the shock. 
The thermodynamic properties are not changed by this transformation, so that all our 
Eqs. (9.50) to (9.59) are still valid.

(e) p03, (f ) A*3, (g) p3, and (h) T03.
Solution
• System sketch: This is shown in Fig. E9.6. Between sections 1 and 2 is a normal shock.
• Assumptions: Isentropic fl ow before and after the shock. Lower p0 and ρ0 after the shock.
• Approach: After fi rst noting that the throat is sonic, work your way from 1 to 2 to 3.
• Property values: For air, R 5 287 m2/(s2 ? K), k 5 1.40, and cp 5 1005 m2/(s2 ? K). 
The inlet stagnation pressure of 300 kPa is constant up to point 1.
• Solution step (a): A shock wave cannot exist unless Ma1 is supersonic. Therefore the 
throat is sonic and choked: Athroat 5 A*1 5 1 m2. The area ratio gives Ma1 from Eq. (9.45) 
for k 5 1.4:

9.5  The Normal Shock Wave 619
Such four-decimal-place accuracy might require iteration or the use of Excel. Linear inter-
polation in Table B.1 would give Ma1 < 2.194, quite good also. The pressure at section 1 
then follows from the isentropic relation, Eq. (9.28):

Similarly, for Ma1 < 2.20, Table B.2 gives p02/p01 < 0.628 (Excel gives 0.6294) and 
A*2/A*1 < 1.592 (Excel gives 1.5888). Thus, to good accuracy,
 
p02 < 0.628p01 5 0.628(300 kPa) < 188 kPa 
Ans. (c)
 
A*2 5 1.59 A*1 5 1.59(1.0 m2) < 1.59 m2 
Ans. (d )
• Comment: To calculate A*2 directly, without Table B.2, you would need to pause and 
calculate Ma2 < 0.547 from Eq. (9.57), since Eq. (9.59) involves both Ma1 and Ma2.
• Step (e, f): The fl ow from 2 to 3 is isentropic (but at higher entropy than upstream of 
the shock); therefore
 
p03 5 p02 < 188 kPa 
Ans. (e)
 
A*3 5 A*2 < 1.59 m2 
Ans. (f )
• Steps (g, h): The fl ow is adiabatic throughout, so the stagnation temperature is constant:

Ans. (h)
Next, the area ratio, using the new sonic area, gives the Mach number at section 3:

• Comments: Excel would give p3 5 175 kPa, so we see that Table B.2 is satisfactory for 
this type of problem. A duct fl ow with a normal shock wave requires straightforward 
application of algebraic perfect-gas relations, coupled with a little thought as to which 
formula is appropriate for the given property.
EXAMPLE 9.7
An explosion in air, k 5 1.4, creates a spherical shock wave propagating radially into still 
air at standard conditions. At the instant shown in Fig. E9.7, the pressure just inside the 
shock is 200 lbf/in2 absolute. Estimate (a) the shock speed C and (b) the air velocity V just 
inside the shock.

620 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Solution
Part (a) 
In spite of the spherical geometry, the fl ow across the shock moves normal to the spherical 
wave front; hence the normal shock relations (9.50) to (9.59) apply. Fixing our control volume 
to the moving shock, we fi nd that the proper conditions to use in Fig. 9.8 are

Ans. (a)
Part (b) 
To fi nd V2, we need the temperature or sound speed inside the shock. Since Ma1 is known, 
from Eq. (9.58) or Table B.2 for Ma1 5 3.436 we compute T2/T1 5 3.228. Then
 
T2 5 3.228T1 5 3.228(520°R) 5 1679°R 
At such a high temperature we should account for non-perfect-gas effects or at least use 
the gas tables [16], but we won’t. Here just estimate from the perfect-gas energy equation 
(9.23) that

Thus a powerful explosion creates a brief but intense blast wind as it passes.3
9.6 Operation of Converging 
and Diverging Nozzles
 
By combining the isentropic fl ow and normal shock relations plus the concept of 
sonic throat choking, we can outline the characteristics of converging and diverging 
nozzles.
Converging Nozzle
 
First consider the converging nozzle sketched in Fig. 9.11a. There is an upstream 
reservoir at stagnation pressure p0. The fl ow is induced by lowering the downstream 
outside, or back, pressure pb below p0, resulting in the sequence of states a to e shown 
in Figs. 9.11b and c.
 
For a moderate drop in pb to states a and b, the throat pressure is higher than the 
critical value p* that would make the throat sonic. The fl ow in the nozzle is subsonic 
throughout, and the jet exit pressure pe equals the back pressure pb. The mass fl ow is 
predicted by subsonic isentropic theory and is less than the critical value m#
max, as 
shown in Fig. 9.11c.
 
For condition c, the back pressure exactly equals the critical pressure p* of the 
throat. The throat becomes sonic, the jet exit fl ow is sonic, pe 5 pb, and the mass 
fl ow equals its maximum value from Eqs. (9.46). The fl ow upstream of the throat is 
subsonic everywhere and predicted by isentropic theory based on the local area ratio 
A(x)/A* and Table B.1.
 
Finally, if pb is lowered further to conditions d or e below p*, the nozzle can-
not respond further because it is choked at its maximum throat mass flow. The 
throat remains sonic with pe 5 p*, and the nozzle pressure distribution is the same 
as in state c, as sketched in Fig. 9.11b. The exit jet expands supersonically so 
that the jet pressure can be reduced from p* down to pb. The jet structure is 
complex and multidimensional and is not shown here. Being supersonic, the jet 
cannot send any signal upstream to influence the choked flow conditions in the 
nozzle.
 
If the stagnation plenum chamber is large or supplemented by a compressor, and 
if the discharge chamber is larger or supplemented by a vacuum pump, the converging 
nozzle fl ow will be steady or nearly so. Otherwise the nozzle will be blowing down, 
with p0 decreasing and pb increasing, and the fl ow states will be changing from, say, 
state e backward to state a. Blowdown calculations are usually made by a quasi-steady 
analysis based on isentropic steady fl ow theory for the instantaneous pressures p0(t) 
and pb(t).
3This is the principle of the shock tube wind tunnel, in which a controlled explosion creates a brief 
fl ow at very high Mach number, with data taken by fast-response instruments. See, for example, Ref. 5.

622 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
EXAMPLE 9.8
A converging nozzle has a throat area of 6 cm2 and stagnation air conditions of 120 kPa 
and 400 K. Compute the exit pressure and mass fl ow if the back pressure is (a) 90 kPa and 
(b) 45 kPa. Assume k 5 1.4.
Solution
From Eq. (9.32) for k 5 1.4 the critical (sonic) throat pressure is
p*
p0
5 0.5283   or   p* 5 (0.5283)(120 kPa) 5 63.4 kPa
If the back pressure is less than this amount, the nozzle fl ow is choked.

9.6  Operation of Converging and Diverging Nozzles 623
Part (a) 
For pb 5 90 kPa . p*, the fl ow is subsonic, not choked. The exit pressure is pe 5 pb. The throat 
Mach number is found from the isentropic relation (9.35) or Table B.1:

To fi nd the mass fl ow, we could proceed with a serial attack on Mae, Te, ae, Ve, and ρe, 
hence to compute ρe  AeVe. However, since the local pressure is known, this part is ideally 
suited for the dimensionless mass fl ow function in Eq. (9.47). With pe/p0 5 90/120 5 0.75,

Ans. (b)
Any back pressure less than 63.4 kPa would cause this same choked mass fl ow. Note that 
the 50 percent increase in exit Mach number, from 0.654 to 1.0, has increased the mass 
fl ow only 12 percent, from 0.128 to 0.145 kg/s.
Converging–Diverging Nozzle
 
Now consider the converging–diverging nozzle sketched in Fig. 9.12a. If the back 
pressure pb is low enough, there will be supersonic fl ow in the diverging portion and 
a variety of shock wave conditions may occur, which are sketched in Fig. 9.12b. Let 
the back pressure be gradually decreased.
 
For curves A and B in Fig. 9.12b the back pressure is not low enough to induce 
sonic fl ow in the throat, and the fl ow in the nozzle is subsonic throughout. The pres-
sure distribution is computed from subsonic isentropic area-change relations, such as 
in Table B.1. The exit pressure pe 5 pb, and the jet is subsonic.
 
For curve C the area ratio Ae/At exactly equals the critical ratio Ae/A* for a subsonic 
Mae in Table B.1. The throat becomes sonic, and the mass fl ux reaches a maximum 
in Fig. 9.12c. The remainder of the nozzle fl ow is subsonic, including the exit jet, 
and pe 5 pb.
 
Now jump for a moment to curve H. Here pb is such that pb/p0 exactly corresponds 
to the critical area ratio Ae/A* for a supersonic Mae in Table B.1. The diverging fl ow 
is entirely supersonic, including the jet fl ow, and pe 5 pb. This is called the design 
pressure ratio of the nozzle and is the back pressure suitable for operating a super-
sonic wind tunnel or an effi cient rocket exhaust.

624 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
 
Now back up and suppose that pb lies between curves C and H, which is impos-
sible according to purely isentropic fl ow calculations. Then back pressures D to F 
occur in Fig. 9.12b. The throat remains choked at the sonic value, and we can match 
pe 5 pb by placing a normal shock at just the right place in the diverging section to 
cause a subsonic diffuser fl ow back to the back-pressure condition. The mass fl ow 
remains at maximum in Fig. 9.12c. At back pressure F the required normal shock 
stands in the duct exit. At back pressure G no single normal shock can do the job, 
and so the fl ow compresses outside the exit in a complex series of oblique shocks 
until it matches pb.
 
Finally, at back pressure I, pb is lower than the design pressure H, but the nozzle 
is choked and cannot respond. The exit fl ow expands in a complex series of supersonic 
wave motions until it matches the low back pressure. See, Ref. 7, Sec. 5.4, for further 
details of these off-design jet fl ow confi gurations.

9.6  Operation of Converging and Diverging Nozzles 625
 
Note that for pb less than back pressure C, there is supersonic fl ow in the nozzle, 
and the throat can receive no signal from the exit behavior. The fl ow remains choked, 
and the throat has no idea what the exit conditions are.
 
Note also that the normal shock-patching idea is idealized. Downstream of the 
shock, the nozzle fl ow has an adverse pressure gradient, usually leading to wall bound-
ary layer separation. Blockage by the greatly thickened separated layer interacts 
strongly with the core fl ow (recall Fig. 6.27) and usually induces a series of weak 
two-dimensional compression shocks rather than a single one-dimensional normal 
shock (see, Ref. 9, pp. 292 and 293, for further details).
EXAMPLE 9.9
A converging–diverging nozzle (Fig. 9.12a) has a throat area of 0.002 m2 and an exit area 
of 0.008 m2. Air stagnation conditions are p0 5 1000 kPa and T0 5 500 K. Compute the 
exit pressure and mass fl ow for (a) design condition and the exit pressure and mass fl ow if 
(b) pb < 300 kPa and (c) pb < 900 kPa. Assume k 5 1.4.
Solution
Part (a) 
The design condition corresponds to supersonic isentropic fl ow at the given area ratio 
Ae/At 5 0.008/0.002 5 4.0. We can fi nd the design Mach number by iteration of the area 
ratio formula (9.45):

For pb 5 300 kPa we are defi nitely far below the subsonic isentropic condition C in Fig. 9.12b, 
but we may even be below condition F with a normal shock in the exit—that is, in condition 
G, where oblique shocks occur outside the exit plane. If it is condition G, then pe 5 pe,design 5

626 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Since this is less than the given pb 5 300 kPa, there is a normal shock just upstream of the 
exit plane (condition E). The exit fl ow is subsonic and equals the back pressure:
 
pe 5 pb 5 300 kPa 
Ans. (b)
Also 
m# 5 m#
max 5 3.61 kg/s 
Ans. (b)
The throat is still sonic and choked at its maximum mass fl ow.
Part (c) 
Finally, for pb 5 900 kPa, which is up near condition C, we compute Mae and pe for condition 
C as a comparison. Again Ae/At 5 4.0 for this condition, with a subsonic Mae estimated from 
Eq. (9.48):
Mae(C) < 0.147    (exact 5 0.14655)
Then the isentropic exit pressure ratio for this condition is
p0

or 
pe 5 1000
1.0152 5 985 kPa 
The given back pressure of 900 kPa is less than this value, corresponding roughly to condi-
tion D in Fig. 9.12b. Thus for this case there is a normal shock just downstream of the 
throat, and the throat is choked:
 
pe 5 pb 5 900 kPa    m# 5 m#
max 5 3.61 kg/s 
Ans. (c)
For this large exit area ratio, the exit pressure would have to be larger than 985 kPa to cause 
a subsonic fl ow in the throat and a mass fl ow less than maximum.
9.7 Compressible Duct Flow 
with Friction4
 
Section 9.4 showed the effect of area change on a compressible fl ow while neglecting 
friction and heat transfer. We could now add friction and heat transfer to the area 
change and consider coupled effects, which is done in advanced texts [for example, 
Ref. 5, Chap. 8]. Instead, as an elementary introduction, this section treats only the 
effect of friction, neglecting area change and heat transfer. The basic assumptions are
1. Steady one-dimensional adiabatic fl ow.
2. Perfect gas with constant specifi c heats.
3. Constant-area straight duct.
4. Negligible shaft work and potential energy changes.
5. Wall shear stress correlated by a Darcy friction factor.
In effect, we are studying a Moody-type pipe friction problem but with large changes 
in kinetic energy, enthalpy, and pressure in the fl ow.
 
This type of duct fl ow—constant area, constant stagnation enthalpy, constant mass 
fl ow, but variable momentum (due to friction)—is often termed Fanno fl ow, after Gino 
4This section may be omitted without loss of continuity.

9.7 Compressible Duct Flow with Friction 627
Fanno, an Italian engineer born in 1882, who fi rst studied this fl ow. For a given mass 
fl ow and stagnation enthalpy, a plot of enthalpy versus entropy for all possible fl ow 
states, subsonic or supersonic, is called a Fanno line. See Probs. P9.94 and P9.111 
for examples of a Fanno line.
 
Consider the elemental duct control volume of area A and length dx in Fig. 9.13. 
The area is constant, but other fl ow properties (p, ρ, T, h, V) may vary with x. Appli-
cation of the three conservation laws to this control volume gives three differential 
equations:

Since these three equations have fi ve unknowns—p, ρ, T, V, and τw—we need two 
additional relations. One is the perfect-gas law:

Equations (9.60) and (9.61) are fi rst-order differential equations and can be inte-
grated, by using friction factor data, from any inlet section 1, where p1, T1, V1, and 
so on are known, to determine p(x), T(x), and other properties along the duct. It is 
practically impossible to eliminate all but one variable to give, say, a single differential 
equation for p(x), but all equations can be written in terms of the Mach number Ma(x) 
and the friction factor, by using this defi nition of Mach number:

We have added to this list that entropy must increase along the duct for either subsonic 
or supersonic fl ow as a consequence of the second law for adiabatic fl ow. For the 
same reason, stagnation pressure and density must both decrease.
 
The key parameter in this discussion is the Mach number. Whether the inlet 
fl ow is subsonic or supersonic, the duct Mach number always tends downstream 
toward Ma 5 1 because this is the path along which the entropy increases. If the 
pressure and density are computed from Eqs. (9.64a) and (9.64b) and the entropy from 
Eq. (9.53), the result can be plotted in Fig. 9.14 versus Mach number for k 5 1.4. 

9.7 Compressible Duct Flow with Friction 629
The maximum entropy occurs at Ma 5 1, so the second law requires that the duct 
fl ow properties continually approach the sonic point. Since p0 and ρ0 continually 
decrease along the duct due to the frictional (nonisentropic) losses, they are not useful 
as reference properties. Instead, the sonic properties p*, ρ*, T*, p*0, and ρ*0 are the 
appropriate constant reference quantities in adiabatic duct fl ow. The theory then com-
putes the ratios p/p*, T/T*, and so forth as a function of local Mach number and the 
integrated friction effect.
 
To derive working formulas, we fi rst attack Eq. (9.64e), which relates the Mach 
number to friction. Separate the variables and integrate:

The upper limit is the sonic point, whether or not it is actually reached in the duct 
fl ow. The lower limit is arbitrarily placed at the position x 5 0, where the Mach 
number is Ma. The result of the integration is

where f  is the average friction factor between 0 and L*. In practice, an average f is 
always assumed, and no attempt is made to account for the slight changes in Reynolds 
number along the duct. For noncircular ducts, D is replaced by the hydraulic diameter 
Dh 5 (4 3 area)/perimeter as in Eq. 6.56.

Equation (9.66) is tabulated versus Mach number in Table B.3. The length L* is 
the length of duct required to develop a duct fl ow from Mach number Ma to the sonic 
point. Many problems involve short ducts that never become sonic, for which the 
solution uses the differences in the tabulated “maximum,” or sonic, length. For exam-
ple, the length DL required to develop from Ma1 to Ma2 is given by

(9.67)
This avoids the need for separate tabulations for short ducts.
 
It is recommended that the friction factor f  be estimated from the Moody chart 
(Fig. 6.13) for the average Reynolds number and wall roughness ratio of the duct. 
Available data [23] on duct friction for compressible fl ow show good agreement with 
the Moody chart for subsonic fl ow, but the measured data in supersonic duct fl ow are 
up to 50 percent less than the equivalent Moody friction factor.
EXAMPLE 9.10
Air fl ows subsonically in an adiabatic 2-cm-diameter duct. The average friction factor is 
0.024. What length of duct is necessary to accelerate the fl ow from Ma1 5 0.1 to Ma2 5 
0.5? What additional length will accelerate it to Ma3 5 1.0? Assume k 5 1.4.
Solution
Equation (9.67) applies with values of fL*/D computed from Eq. (9.66) or read from 
Table B.3:

Ans. (b)
This is typical of these calculations: It takes 55 m to accelerate up to Ma 5 0.5 and then 
only 0.9 m more to get all the way up to the sonic point.
 
Formulas for other fl ow properties along the duct can be derived from Eqs. (9.64). 
Equation (9.64e) can be used to eliminate f dx/D from each of the other relations, 
giving, for example, dp/p as a function only of Ma and d Ma2/Ma2. For convenience 
in tabulating the results, each expression is then integrated all the way from (p, Ma)

Choking Due to Friction
 
The theory here predicts that for adiabatic frictional fl ow in a constant-area duct, no 
matter what the inlet Mach number Ma1 is, the fl ow downstream tends toward the 
sonic point. There is a certain duct length L*(Ma1) for which the exit Mach number 
will be exactly unity. The duct is then choked.
 
But what if the actual length L is greater than the predicted “maximum” length 
L*? Then the fl ow conditions must change, and there are two classifi cations.
Subsonic Inlet. If L . L*(Ma1), the fl ow slows down until an inlet Mach number 
Ma2 is reached such that L 5 L*(Ma2). The exit fl ow is sonic, and the mass fl ow has 
been reduced by frictional choking. Further increases in duct length will continue to 
decrease the inlet Ma and mass fl ow.
Supersonic Inlet. From Table B.3 we see that friction has a very large effect on 
supersonic duct fl ow. Even an infi nite inlet Mach number will be reduced to sonic 
conditions in only 41 diameters for f  5 0.02. Some typical numerical values are 
shown in Fig. 9.15, assuming an inlet Ma 5 3.0 and f  5 0.02. For this condition 
L* 5 26 diameters. If L is increased beyond 26D, the fl ow will not choke but a normal 
shock will form at just the right place for the subsequent subsonic frictional fl ow to

9.7 Compressible Duct Flow with Friction 633
become sonic exactly at the exit. Figure 9.15 shows two examples, for L/D 5 40 and 
53. As the length increases, the required normal shock moves upstream until, for Fig. 
9.15, the shock is at the inlet for L/D 5 63. Further increase in L causes the shock 
to move upstream of the inlet into the supersonic nozzle feeding the duct. Yet the 
mass fl ow is still the same as for the very short duct, because presumably the feed 
nozzle still has a sonic throat. Eventually, a very long duct will cause the feed-nozzle 
throat to become choked, thus reducing the duct mass fl ow. Thus supersonic friction 
changes the fl ow pattern if L . L* but does not choke the fl ow until L is much larger 
than L*.
EXAMPLE 9.12
Air enters a 3-cm-diameter duct at p0 5 200 kPa, T0 5 500 K, and V1 5 100 m/s. The 
friction factor is 0.02. Compute (a) the maximum duct length for these conditions, (b) the 
mass fl ow if the duct length is 15 m, and (c) the reduced mass fl ow if L 5 30 m.

Minor Losses in 
Compressible Flow
 
For incompressible pipe fl ow, as in Eq. (6.78), the loss coeffi cient K is the ratio of pressure 
head loss (Dp/ρg) to the velocity head (V2/2g) in the pipe. This is inappropriate in compress-
ible pipe fl ow, where ρ and V are not constant. Benedict [24] suggests that the static pressure 
loss (p1 2 p2) be related to downstream conditions and a static loss coeffi cient Ks:
 
Ks 5 2(  p1 2 p2)
ρ2V2
2
 
(9.70)
Benedict [24] gives examples of compressible losses in sudden contractions and 
expansions. If data are unavailable, a fi rst approximation would be to use Ks < K 
from Sec. 6.9.
Isothermal Flow with Friction: 
Long Pipelines
 
The adiabatic frictional fl ow assumption is appropriate to high-speed fl ow in short 
ducts. For fl ow in long ducts, such as natural gas pipelines, the gas state more closely 

9.7 Compressible Duct Flow with Friction 635
approximates an isothermal fl ow. The analysis is the same except that the isoenergetic 
energy equation (9.60c) is replaced by the simple relation
T 5 const  dT 5 0
Again it is possible to write all property changes in terms of the Mach number. Inte-
gration of the Mach number–friction relation yields
 
  fLmax
D
5 1 2 k Ma2
k Ma2
1 ln (k Ma2) 
(9.71)
which is the isothermal analog of Eq. (9.66) for adiabatic fl ow.
 
This friction relation has the interesting result that Lmax becomes zero not at the 
sonic point but at Macrit 5 1/k1/2 5 0.845 if k 5 1.4. The inlet fl ow, whether subsonic 
or supersonic, tends downstream toward this limiting Mach number 1/k1/2. If the tube 
length L is greater than Lmax from Eq. (9.71), a subsonic fl ow will choke back to a 
smaller Ma1 and mass fl ow and a supersonic fl ow will experience a normal shock 
adjustment similar to Fig. 9.15.
 
The exit isothermal choked fl ow is not sonic, and so the use of the asterisk is 
inappropriate. Let p9, ρ9, and V9 represent properties at the choking point L 5 Lmax. 
Then the isothermal analysis leads to the following Mach number relations for the 
fl ow properties:
 
p

(9.72)
The complete analysis and some examples are given in advanced texts [for example, 
Ref. 5, Sec. 6.4].
Mass Flow for a Given 
Pressure Drop
 
An interesting by-product of the isothermal analysis is an explicit relation between the 
pressure drop and duct mass fl ow. This common problem requires numerical iteration 
for adiabatic fl ow, as outlined here. In isothermal fl ow, we may substitute dV/V 5 
2dp/p and V2 5 G2/[p/(RT)]2 in Eq. (9.63) to obtain
2p dp
G2RT 1 f  dx
D 2 2 dp
p
5 0
Since G2RT is constant for isothermal fl ow, this may be integrated in closed form 
between (x, p) 5 (0, p1) and (L, p2):

Thus mass fl ow follows directly from the known end pressures, without any use of 
Mach numbers or tables.
 
The writer does not know of any direct analogy to Eq. (9.73) for adiabatic fl ow. 
However, a useful adiabatic relation, involving velocities instead of pressures, is

where a0 5 (kRT0)1/2 is the stagnation speed of sound, constant for adiabatic fl ow. 
This may be combined with continuity for constant duct area V1/V2 5 ρ2/ρ1, plus the 
following combination of adiabatic energy and the perfect-gas relation:

(9.75)
If we are given the end pressures, neither V1 nor V2 will likely be known in advance. We 
suggest only the following simple procedure: Begin with a0 < a1 and the bracketed term 
in Eq. (9.75) approximately equal to 1.0. Solve Eq. (9.75) for a fi rst estimate of V1/V2, 
and use this value in Eq. (9.74) to get a better estimate of V1. Use V1 to improve your 
estimate of a0, and repeat the procedure. The process should converge in a few iterations.
 
Equations (9.73) and (9.74) have one fl aw: With the Mach number eliminated, the 
frictional choking phenomenon is not directly evident. Therefore, assuming a subsonic 
inlet fl ow, one should check the exit Mach number Ma2 to ensure that it is not greater 
than 1/k1/2 for isothermal fl ow or greater than 1.0 for adiabatic fl ow. We illustrate 
both adiabatic and isothermal fl ow with the following example.
EXAMPLE 9.13
Air enters a pipe of 1-cm diameter and 1.2-m length at p1 5 220 kPa and T1 5 300 K. If 
f  5 0.025 and the exit pressure is p2 5 140 kPa, estimate the mass fl ow for (a) isothermal 
fl ow and (b) adiabatic fl ow.

Part (b) 
For adiabatic fl ow, we can iterate by hand, in the time-honored fashion, using Eqs. (9.74) and 
(9.75), plus the defi nition of stagnation speed of sound, ao 5 (kRTo)1/2. A few years ago the 
writer would have done just that, laboriously. However, these equations can be iterated and 
manipulated by Excel. First list the given data and requirements:

9.8 Frictionless Duct Flow with 
Heat Transfer5
 
Heat addition or removal has an interesting effect on a compressible fl ow. Advanced 
texts [for example, Ref. 5, Chap. 8] consider the combined effect of heat transfer 
coupled with friction and area change in a duct. Here we confi ne the analysis to heat 
transfer with no friction in a constant-area duct.
 
This type of duct fl ow—constant area, constant momentum, constant mass fl ow, 
but variable stagnation enthalpy (due to heat transfer)—is often termed Rayleigh fl ow 
after John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919), a famous physicist and engi-
neer. For a given mass fl ow and momentum, a plot of enthalpy versus entropy for all 
possible fl ow states, subsonic or supersonic, forms a Rayleigh line. See Probs. P9.110 
and P9.111 for examples of a Rayleigh line.
 
Consider the elemental duct control volume in Fig. 9.16. Between sections 1 and 
2 an amount of heat δ Q is added (or removed) to each incremental mass δm passing 
through. With no friction or area change, the control volume conservation relations 
are quite simple:

The heat transfer results in a change in stagnation enthalpy of the fl ow. We shall not specify 
exactly how the heat is transferred—combustion, nuclear reaction, evaporation, condensa-
tion, or wall heat exchange—but simply that it happened in amount q between 1 and 2. 
We remark, however, that wall heat exchange is not a good candidate for the theory because 
wall convection is inevitably coupled with wall friction, which we neglected.
 
To complete the analysis, we use the perfect-gas and Mach number relations:

For a given heat transfer q 5 δ Q/δ m or, equivalently, a given change h02 2 h01, 
Eqs. (9.76) and (9.77) can be solved algebraically for the property ratios p2/p1, Ma2/Ma1, 
and so on between inlet and outlet. Note that because the heat transfer allows the entropy 
to either increase or decrease, the second law imposes no restrictions on these solutions.
 
Before writing down these property ratio functions, we illustrate the effect of heat 
transfer in Fig. 9.17, which shows T0 and T versus Mach number in the duct. Heating

increases T0, and cooling decreases it. The maximum possible T0 occurs at Ma 5 1.0, 
and we see that heating, whether the inlet is subsonic or supersonic, drives the duct 
Mach number toward unity. This is analogous to the effect of friction in the previous 
section. The temperature of a perfect gas increases from Ma 5 0 up to Ma 5 1/k1/2 
and then decreases. Thus there is a peculiar—or at least unexpected—region where 
heating (increasing T0) actually decreases the gas temperature, the difference being 
refl ected in a large increase of the gas kinetic energy. For k 5 1.4 this peculiar area 
lies between Ma 5 0.845 and Ma 5 1.0 (interesting but not very useful 
information).

Probably the most signifi cant item on this list is the stagnation pressure p0, which always 
decreases during heating whether the fl ow is subsonic or supersonic. Thus heating does 
increase the Mach number of a fl ow but entails a loss in effective pressure recovery.
Mach Number Relations
 
Equations (9.76) and (9.77) can be rearranged in terms of the Mach number and 
the results tabulated. For convenience, we specify that the outlet section is sonic, 
Ma 5 1, with reference properties T*0, T*, p*, ρ*, V*, and p*0. The inlet is assumed 
to be at arbitrary Mach number Ma. Equations (9.76) and (9.77) then take the fol-

These formulas are all tabulated versus Mach number in Table B.4. The tables are very 
convenient if inlet properties Ma1, V1, and the like are given but are somewhat cumber-
some if the given information centers on T01 and T02. Let us illustrate with an example.
EXAMPLE 9.14
A fuel–air mixture, approximated as air with k 5 1.4, enters a duct combustion chamber at 
V1 5 75 m/s, p1 5 150 kPa, and T1 5 300 K. The heat addition by combustion is 900 kJ/kg 
of mixture. Compute (a) the exit properties V2, p2, and T2 and (b) the total heat addition 
that would have caused a sonic exit fl ow.
Solution
Part (a) 
First compute T01 5 T1 1 V2
1/(2cp) 5 300 1 (75)2/[2(1005)] 5 303 K. Then compute the 
change in stagnation temperature of the gas:

T02 5 T01 1 q
cp
5 303 K 1
900,000 J/kg
1005 J/(kg # K) 5 1199 K 
We have enough information to compute the initial Mach number:

347 5 0.216
For this Mach number, use Eq. (9.78a) or Table B.4 to fi nd the sonic value T*0:
At Ma1 5 0.216:  
T01
T*0
< 0.1992    or    T*0 5 303 K
0.1992 < 1521 K 
Then the stagnation temperature ratio at section 2 is T02/T*0 5 1199/1521 5 0.788, which 
corresponds in Table B.4 to a Mach number Ma2 < 0.573.
 
Now use Eqs. (9.78) at Ma1 and Ma2 to tabulate the desired property ratios.

9.8 Frictionless Duct Flow with Heat Transfer 641
Choking Effects Due to 
Simple Heating
 
Equation (9.78a) and Table B.4 indicate that the maximum possible stagnation tem-
perature in simple heating corresponds to T*0, or the sonic exit Mach number. Thus, 
for given inlet conditions, only a certain maximum amount of heat can be added to 
the fl ow—for example, 1.22 MJ/kg in Example 9.14. For a subsonic inlet there is no 
theoretical limit on heat addition: The fl ow chokes more and more as we add more 
heat, with the inlet velocity approaching zero. For supersonic fl ow, even if Ma1 is 
infi nite, there is a fi nite ratio T01/T*0 5 0.4898 for k 5 1.4. Thus if heat is added 
without limit to a supersonic fl ow, a normal shock wave adjustment is required to 
accommodate the required property changes.
 
In subsonic fl ow there is no theoretical limit to the amount of cooling allowed: 
The exit fl ow just becomes slower and slower, and the temperature approaches 
zero. In supersonic fl ow only a fi nite amount of cooling can be allowed before 
the exit fl ow approaches infi nite Mach number, with T02/T*0 5 0.4898 and the exit 
temperature equal to zero. There are very few practical applications for supersonic 
cooling.
EXAMPLE 9.15
What happens to the inlet fl ow in Example 9.14 if the heat addition is increased to 1400 kJ/kg 
and the inlet pressure and stagnation temperature are fi xed? What will be the subsequent 
decrease in mass fl ow?
Solution
For q 5 1400 kJ/kg, the exit will be choked at the stagnation temperature:
T*0 5 T01 1 q
cp
5 303 1
1.4 E6 J/kg
1005 J/(kg # K) < 1696 K
This is higher than the value T*0 5 1521 K in Example 9.14, so we know that condition 1 
will have to choke down to a lower Mach number. The proper value is found from the ratio 
T01/T*0 5 303/1696 5 0.1787. From Table B.4 or Eq. (9.78a) for this condition, we read 
the new, lowered entrance Mach number: Ma1,new < 0.203. With T01 and p1 known, the 
other inlet properties follow from this Mach number:
 T1 5
T01
1 1 0.2 Ma1

Finally, the new lowered mass fl ow per unit area is
m#

A
5 ρ1V1 5 (1.74 kg/m3)(71 m/s) 5 123 kg/(s # m2)
This is 7 percent less than in Example 9.14, due to choking by excess heat addition.

642 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Relationship to the 
Normal Shock Wave
 
The normal shock wave relations of Sec. 9.5 actually lurk within the simple heating 
relations as a special case. From Table B.4 or Fig. 9.17 we see that for a given stag-
nation temperature less than T*0 two fl ow states satisfy the simple heating relations, 
one subsonic and the other supersonic. These two states have (1) the same value of 
T0, (2) the same mass fl ow per unit area, and (3) the same value of p 1 ρV2. Therefore 
these two states are exactly equivalent to the conditions on each side of a normal 
shock wave. The second law would again require that the upstream fl ow Ma1 be 
supersonic.
 
To illustrate this point, take Ma1 5 3.0 and from Table B.4 read T01/T*0 5 0.6540 
and p1/p* 5 0.1765. Now, for the same value T02/T*0 5 0.6540, use Table B.4 or 
Eq. (9.78a) to compute Ma2 5 0.4752 and p2/p* 5 1.8235. The value of Ma2 is 
exactly what we read in the shock table, Table B.2, as the downstream Mach number 
when Ma1 5 3.0. The pressure ratio for these two states is p2/p1 5 (p2/p*)/(p1/p*) 5 
1.8235/0.1765 5 10.33, which again is just what we read in Table B.2 for Ma1 5 
3.0. This illustration is meant only to show the physical background of the simple 
heating relations; it would be silly to make a practice of computing normal shock 
waves in this manner.
9.9 Mach Waves and Oblique 
Shock Waves
 
Up to this point we have considered only one-dimensional compressible fl ow theories. 
This illustrated many important effects, but a one-dimensional world completely loses 
sight of the wave motions that are so characteristic of supersonic fl ow. The only “wave 
motion” we could muster in a one-dimensional theory was the normal shock wave, 
which amounted only to a fl ow discontinuity in the duct.
Mach Waves
 
When we add a second dimension to the fl ow, wave motions immediately become 
apparent if the fl ow is supersonic. Figure 9.18 shows a celebrated graphical construc-
tion that appears in every fl uid mechanics textbook and was fi rst presented by Ernst 
Mach in 1887. The fi gure shows the pattern of pressure disturbances (sound waves) 
sent out by a small particle moving at speed U through a still fl uid whose sound 
velocity is a.
 
As the particle moves, it continually crashes against fluid particles and sends 
out spherical sound waves emanating from every point along its path. A few of 
these spherical disturbance fronts are shown in Fig. 9.18. The behavior of these 
fronts is quite different according to whether the particle speed is subsonic or 
supersonic.
 
In Fig. 9.18a, the particle moves subsonically, U , a, Ma 5 U/a , 1. The spheri-
cal disturbances move out in all directions and do not catch up with one another. They 
move well out in front of the particle also, because they travel a distance a δ t during 
the time interval δ t in which the particle has moved only U δ t. Therefore a subsonic 
body motion makes its presence felt everywhere in the fl ow fi eld: You can “hear” or 
“feel” the pressure rise of an oncoming body before it reaches you. This is apparently 
why that pigeon in the road, without turning around to look at you, takes to the air 
and avoids being hit by your car.
 
At sonic speed, U 5 a, Fig. 9.18b, the pressure disturbances move at exactly the 
speed of the particle and thus pile up on the left at the position of the particle into a 

9.9  Mach Waves and Oblique Shock Waves 643
sort of “front locus,” which is now called a Mach wave, after Ernst Mach. No distur-
bance reaches beyond the particle. If you are stationed to the left of the particle, you 
cannot “hear” the oncoming motion. If the particle blew its horn, you couldn’t hear 
that either: A sonic car can sneak up on a pigeon.
 
In supersonic motion, U . a, the lack of advance warning is even more pronounced. 
The disturbance spheres cannot catch up with the fast-moving particle that created 
them. They all trail behind the particle and are tangent to a conical locus called the 
Mach cone. From the geometry of Fig. 9.18c the angle of the Mach cone is seen to be
 
μ 5 sin21 a
U δ t
δ t 5 sin21 a
U 5 sin21 1
Ma 
(9.79)
The higher the particle Mach number, the more slender the Mach cone; for example, 
μ is 308 at Ma 5 2.0 and 11.58 at Ma 5 5.0. For the limiting case of sonic fl ow, 
Ma 5 1, μ 5 908; the Mach cone becomes a plane front moving with the particle, 
in agreement with Fig. 9.18b.
 
You cannot “hear” the disturbance caused by the supersonic particle in Fig. 9.18c 
until you are in the zone of action inside the Mach cone. No warning can reach your 
ears if you are in the zone of silence outside the cone. Thus an observer on the ground 
beneath a supersonic airplane does not hear the sonic boom of the passing cone until 
the plane is well past.

644 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
 
The Mach wave need not be a cone: Similar waves are formed by a small disturbance 
of any shape moving supersonically with respect to the ambient fl uid. For example, the 
“particle” in Fig. 9.18c could be the leading edge of a sharp fl at plate, which would 
form a Mach wedge of exactly the same angle μ. Mach waves are formed by small 
roughnesses or boundary layer irregularities in a supersonic wind tunnel or at the surface 
of a supersonic body. Look again at Fig. 9.10: Mach waves are clearly visible along the 
body surface downstream of the recompression shock, especially at the rear corner. Their 
angle is about 308, indicating a Mach number of about 2.0 along this surface. 
 
A more complicated system of waves, seen in Fig. 9.19, emanates from a model 
of the supersonic X-15 fi ghter plane, catapulted at Ma < 1.7 through a wind tunnel. 
The Mach and shock waves are visualized by the knife-edge schlieren photographic 
technique [31]. Note the supersonic turbulent wake.
EXAMPLE 9.16
An observer on the ground does not hear the sonic boom caused by an airplane moving at 
5-km altitude until it is 9 km past her. What is the approximate Mach number of the plane? 
Assume a small disturbance, and neglect the variation of sound speed with altitude.
Solution
A fi nite disturbance like an airplane will create a fi nite-strength oblique shock wave whose 
angle will be somewhat larger than the Mach wave angle μ and will curve downward due to 
the variation in atmospheric sound speed. If we neglect these effects, the altitude and distance 
are a measure of μ, as seen in Fig. E9.16.

Ans.
The Oblique Shock Wave
 
Figures 9.10 and 9.19 and our earlier discussion all indicate that a shock wave can 
form at an oblique angle to the oncoming supersonic stream. Such a wave will defl ect 
the stream through an angle θ, unlike the normal shock wave, for which the down-
stream fl ow is in the same direction. In essence, an oblique shock is caused by the 
necessity for a supersonic stream to turn through such an angle. Examples could be 
a fi nite wedge at the leading edge of a body and a ramp in the wall of a supersonic 
wind tunnel.
 
The fl ow geometry of an oblique shock is shown in Fig. 9.20. As for the normal 
shock of Fig. 9.8, state 1 denotes the upstream conditions and state 2 is downstream. 
The shock angle has an arbitrary value β, and the downstream fl ow V2 turns at an 
angle θ which is a function of β and state 1 conditions. The upstream fl ow is always 
supersonic, but the downstream Mach number Ma2 5 V2/a2 may be subsonic, sonic, 
or supersonic, depending on the conditions.

646 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
 
It is convenient to analyze the fl ow by breaking it up into normal and tangential 
components with respect to the wave, as shown in Fig. 9.20. For a thin control volume 
just encompassing the wave, we can then derive the following integral relations, 
canceling out A1 5 A2 on each side of the wave:
Continuity: 
ρ1Vn1 5 ρ2Vn2 
(9.80a)
Normal momentum: 
p1 2 p2 5 ρ2Vn2
2 2 ρ1Vn1

2Vt1
2 5 h2 1 1
2Vn2
2 1 1

2 5 h0 
(9.80d)
We see from Eq. (9.80c) that there is no change in tangential velocity across an 
oblique shock:
Vt2 5 Vt1 5 Vt 5 const 
(9.81)
Thus tangential velocity has as its only effect the addition of a constant kinetic energy 
1
2 V2
t  to each side of the energy equation (9.80d). We conclude that Eqs. (9.80) are 
identical to the normal shock relations (9.49), with V1 and V2 replaced by the normal 
components Vn1 and Vn2. All the various relations from Sec. 9.5 can be used to com-
pute properties of an oblique shock wave. The trick is to use the “normal” Mach 
numbers in place of Ma1 and Ma2:
 Man1 5 Vn1
a1
5 Ma1 sin β  
 Man2 5 Vn2
a2
5 Ma2 sin (  β 2 θ)  
(9.82)
Then, for a perfect gas with constant specifi c heats, the property ratios across the 
oblique shock are the analogs of Eqs. (9.55) to (9.58) with Ma1 replaced by Man1:

All these are tabulated in the normal shock Table B.2. If you wondered why that table 
listed the Mach numbers as Man1 and Man2, it should be clear now that the table is 
also valid for the oblique shock wave.

9.9  Mach Waves and Oblique Shock Waves 647
 
Thinking all this over, we realize with hindsight that an oblique shock wave is the 
fl ow pattern one would observe by running along a normal shock wave (Fig. 9.8) at a 
constant tangential speed Vt. Thus the normal and oblique shocks are related by a galilean, 
or inertial, velocity transformation and therefore satisfy the same basic equations.
 
If we continue with this run-along-the-shock analogy, we fi nd that the defl ection 
angle θ increases with speed Vt up to a maximum and then decreases. From the 
geometry of Fig. 9.20, the defl ection angle is given by
 
θ 5 tan21 Vt
Vn2
2 tan21 Vt
Vn1
 
(9.84)
If we differentiate θ with respect to Vt and set the result equal to zero, we fi nd that 
the maximum defl ection occurs when Vt /Vn1 5 (Vn2/Vn1)1/2. We can substitute this 
back into Eq. (9.84) to compute
 
θmax 5 tan21 r1/2 2 tan21 r21/2      r 5 Vn1
Vn2
 
(9.85)
For example, if Man1 5 3.0, from Table B.2 we fi nd that Vn1/Vn2 5 3.8571, the square 
root of which is 1.9640. Then Eq. (9.85) predicts a maximum defl ection of 
tan21 1.9640 2 tan21 (1/1.9640) 5 36.038. The defl ection is quite limited even for 
infi nite Man1: From Table B.2 for this case Vn1/Vn2 5 6.0, and we compute from Eq. 
(9.85) that θmax 5 45.588.
 
This limited-defl ection idea and other facts become more evident if we plot some 
of the solutions of Eqs. (9.83). For given values of V1 and a1, assuming as usual that 
k 5 1.4, we can plot all possible solutions for V2 downstream of the shock. Figure 9.21 
does this in velocity-component coordinates Vx and Vy, with x parallel to V1. Such a 
plot is called a hodograph. The heavy dark line that looks like a fat airfoil is the 
locus, or shock polar, of all physically possible solutions for the given Ma1. The two 
dashed-line fi shtails are solutions that increase V2; they are physically impossible 
because they violate the second law.
 
Examining the shock polar in Fig. 9.21, we see that a given defl ection line of small 
angle θ crosses the polar at two possible solutions: the strong shock, which greatly 
decelerates the fl ow, and the weak shock, which causes a much milder deceleration.

648 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
The fl ow downstream of the strong shock is always subsonic, while that of the weak 
shock is usually supersonic but occasionally subsonic if the defl ection is large. Both 
types of shock occur in practice. The weak shock is more prevalent, but the strong 
shock will occur if there is a blockage or high-pressure condition downstream.
 
Since the shock polar is only of fi nite size, there is a maximum defl ection θmax, 
shown in Fig. 9.21, that just grazes the upper edge of the polar curve. This verifi es 
the kinematic discussion that led to Eq. (9.85). What happens if a supersonic fl ow 
is forced to defl ect through an angle greater than θmax? The answer is illustrated in 
Fig. 9.22 for fl ow past a wedge-shaped body.
 
In Fig. 9.22a the wedge half-angle θ is less than θmax, and thus an oblique shock 
forms at the nose of wave angle β just suffi cient to cause the oncoming supersonic 
stream to defl ect through the wedge angle θ. Except for the usually small effect of 
boundary layer growth (see, for example, Ref. 19, Sec. 7–5.2), the Mach number Ma2 
is constant along the wedge surface and is given by the solution of Eqs. (9.83). The 
pressure, density, and temperature along the surface are also nearly constant, as pre-
dicted by Eqs. (9.83). When the fl ow reaches the corner of the wedge, it expands to 
higher Mach number and forms a wake (not shown) similar to that in Fig. 9.10.
 
In Fig. 9.22b the wedge half-angle is greater than θmax, and an attached oblique 
shock is impossible. The fl ow cannot defl ect at once through the entire angle θmax, 
yet somehow the fl ow must get around the wedge. A detached curve shock wave 
forms in front of the body, discontinuously defl ecting the fl ow through angles smaller 
than θmax. The fl ow then curves, expands, and defl ects subsonically around the wedge, 
becoming sonic and then supersonic as it passes the corner region. The fl ow just inside 
each point on the curved shock exactly satisfi es the oblique shock relations (9.83) for

that particular value of β and the given Ma1. Every condition along the curved shock 
is a point on the shock polar of Fig. 9.21. Points near the front of the wedge are in 
the strong shock family, and points aft of the sonic line are in the weak shock family. 
The analysis of detached shock waves is extremely complex [13], and experimentation 
is usually needed, such as the shadowgraph optical technique of Fig. 9.10.
 
The complete family of oblique shock solutions can be plotted or computed from Eqs. 
(9.83). For a given k, the wave angle β varies with Ma1 and θ, from Eq. (9.83b). By using 
a trigonometric identity for tan (β 2 θ) this can be rewritten in the more convenient form
 
tan θ 5 2 cot β (Ma1
2 sin2 β 2 1)
Ma1
2 (k 1 cos 2β) 1 2  
(9.86)
All possible solutions of Eq. (9.86) for k 5 1.4 are shown in Fig. 9.23. For defl ections 
θ , θmax there are two solutions: a weak shock (small β) and a strong shock (large β), 
as expected. All points along the dash–dot line for θmax satisfy Eq. (9.85). A dashed line 
has been added to show where Ma2 is exactly sonic. We see that there is a narrow region 
near maximum defl ection where the weak shock downstream fl ow is subsonic.
 
For zero defl ections (θ 5 0) the weak shock family satisfi es the wave angle 
relation

Thus weak shocks of vanishing defl ection are equivalent to Mach waves. Meanwhile the 
strong shocks all converge at zero defl ection to the normal shock condition β 5 908.

Two additional oblique shock charts are given in App. B for k 5 1.4, where Fig. B.1 
gives the downstream Mach number Ma2 and Fig. B.2 the pressure ratio p2/p1, each 
plotted as a function of Ma1 and θ. Additional graphs, tables, and computer programs 
are given in Refs. 20 and 21.
Very Weak Shock Waves
 
For any fi nite θ the wave angle β for a weak shock is greater than the Mach angle μ. 
For small θ Eq. (9.86) can be expanded in a power series in tan θ with the following 
linearized result for the wave angle:
 
sin β 5 sin μ 1 k 1 1
4 cos μ tan θ 1 p 1 2(tan2 θ) 1 p 
(9.88)
For Ma1 between 1.4 and 20.0 and defl ections less than 68 this relation predicts β to 
within 18 for a weak shock. For larger defl ections it can be used as a useful initial 
guess for iterative solution of Eq. (9.86).
 
Other property changes across the oblique shock can also be expanded in a power 
series for small defl ection angles. Of particular interest is the pressure change from 
Eq. (9.83a), for which the linearized result for a weak shock is
 
p2 2 p1

for supersonic expansion turns. Figure 9.24 shows the exact weak shock pressure jump

computed from Eq. (9.83a). At very small defl ections the curves are linear with slopes 
given by Eq. (9.89).
 
Finally, it is educational to examine the entropy change across a very weak shock. 
Using the same power series expansion technique, we can obtain the following result 
for small fl ow defl ections:

The entropy change is cubic in the defl ection angle θ. Thus weak shock waves are 
very nearly isentropic, a fact that is also used in the next section.
EXAMPLE 9.17
Air at Ma 5 2.0 and p 5 10 lbf/in2 absolute is forced to turn through 108 by a ramp at the 
body surface. A weak oblique shock forms as in Fig. E9.17. For k 5 1.4 compute from 
exact oblique shock theory (a) the wave angle β, (b) Ma2, and (c) p2. Also use the linearized 
theory to estimate (d ) β and (e) p2.

With Ma1 5 2.0 and θ 5 108 known, we can estimate β < 408 6 28 from Fig. 9.23. For more

These are reasonable estimates in spite of the fact that 108 is really not a “small” fl ow 
defl ection.
9.10 Prandtl-Meyer Expansion 
Waves
 
The oblique shock solution of Sec. 9.9 is for a fi nite compressive defl ection θ that 
obstructs a supersonic fl ow and thus decreases its Mach number and velocity. The 
present section treats gradual changes in fl ow angle that are primarily expansive; they 
widen the fl ow area and increase the Mach number and velocity. The property changes 
accumulate in infi nitesimal increments, and the linearized relations (9.88) and (9.89) 
are used. The local fl ow defl ections are infi nitesimal, so the fl ow is nearly isentropic 
according to Eq. (9.90).
 
Figure 9.25 shows four examples, one of which (Fig. 9.25c) fails the test for 
gradual changes. The gradual compression of Fig. 9.25a is essentially isentropic, with 
a smooth increase in pressure along the surface, but the Mach angle increases along 
the surface and the waves tend to coalesce farther out into an oblique shock wave. 
The gradual expansion of Fig. 9.25b causes a smooth isentropic increase of Mach 
number and velocity along the surface, with diverging Mach waves formed.
 
The sudden compression of Fig. 9.25c cannot be accomplished by Mach waves: 
An oblique shock forms, and the fl ow is nonisentropic. This could be what you would 
see if you looked at Fig. 9.25a from far away. Finally, the sudden expansion of Fig. 
9.25d is isentropic and forms a fan of centered Mach waves emanating from the 
corner. Note that the fl ow on any streamline passing through the fan changes smoothly 
to higher Mach number and velocity. In the limit as we near the corner the fl ow 
expands almost discontinuously at the surface. The cases in Figs. 9.25a, b, and d can 
all be handled by the Prandtl-Meyer supersonic wave theory of this section, fi rst 
formulated by Ludwig Prandtl and his student Theodor Meyer in 1907 to 1908.
 
Note that none of this discussion makes sense if the upstream Mach number is 
subsonic, since Mach wave and shock wave patterns cannot exist in subsonic fl ow.
The Prandtl-Meyer Perfect-Gas 
Function
 
Consider a small, nearly infi nitesimal fl ow defl ection dθ such as occurs between 
the fi rst two Mach waves in Fig. 9.25a. From Eqs. (9.88) and (9.89) we have, in

β < μ 5 sin21 1
Ma 
(9.91a)
 
dp
p <

(Ma2 2 1)1/2 dθ 
(9.91b)
Since the fl ow is nearly isentropic, we have the frictionless differential momentum 
equation for a perfect gas:
 
dp 5 2ρV dV 5 2kp Ma2 dV
V  
(9.92)
Combining Eqs. (9.91a) and (9.92) to eliminate dp, we obtain a relation between 
turning angle and velocity change:
 
dθ 5 2(Ma2 2 1)1/2 dV
V  
(9.93)
This can be integrated into a functional relation for fi nite turning angles if we can 
relate V to Ma. We do this from the defi nition of Mach number:

654 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Finally, we can eliminate da/a because the fl ow is isentropic and hence a0 is constant 
for a perfect gas:

2(k 2 1)   Ma2421/2
or 
da

2(k 2 1) Ma d Ma

2(k 2 1) Ma2  
(9.95)
Eliminating dV/V and da/a from Eqs. (9.93) to (9.95), we obtain a relation solely 
between turning angle and Mach number:
dθ 5 2
(Ma2 2 1)1/2
1 1 1
2(k 2 1) Ma2 d Ma
Ma  
(9.96)
 
Before integrating this expression, we note that the primary application is to expan-
sions: increasing Ma and decreasing θ. Therefore, for convenience, we defi ne the 
Prandtl-Meyer angle ω(Ma), which increases when θ decreases and is zero at the 
sonic point:
dω 5 2dθ    ω 5 0    at    Ma 5 1 
(9.97)
Thus we integrate Eq. (9.96) from the sonic point to any value of Ma:

(Ma2 2 1)1/2

This is the Prandtl-Meyer supersonic expansion function, which is plotted in Fig. 9.26 
and tabulated in Table B.5 for k 5 1.4, K 5 6. The angle ω changes rapidly at fi rst 
and then levels off at high Mach number to a limiting value as Ma → `:
ωmax 5 π
2
 (K1/2 2 1) 5 130.45°    if    k 5 1.4 
(9.100)
Thus a supersonic fl ow can expand only through a fi nite turning angle before it 
reaches infi nite Mach number, maximum velocity, and zero temperature.
 
Gradual expansion or compression between fi nite Mach numbers Ma1 and Ma2, 
neither of which is unity, is computed by relating the turning angle Dω to the differ-
ence in Prandtl-Meyer angles for the two conditions
¢ω1S2 5 ω(Ma2) 2 ω(Ma1) 
(9.101)
The change Dω may be either positive (expansion) or negative (compression) as 
long as the end conditions lie in the supersonic range. Let us illustrate with an 
example.

Application to Supersonic Airfoils  
The oblique shock and Prandtl-Meyer expansion theories can be used to patch together 
a number of interesting and practical supersonic fl ow fi elds. This marriage, called shock 
expansion theory, is limited by two conditions: (1) Except in rare instances the fl ow 
must be supersonic throughout, and (2) the wave pattern must not suffer interference 
from waves formed in other parts of the fl ow fi eld.
 
A very successful application of shock expansion theory is to supersonic airfoils. 
Figure 9.27 shows two examples, a fl at plate and a diamond-shaped foil. In contrast 
to subsonic fl ow designs (Fig. 8.21), these airfoils must have sharp leading edges, 
which form attached oblique shocks or expansion fans. Rounded supersonic leading 
edges would cause detached bow shocks, as in Fig. 9.19 or 9.22b, greatly increasing 
the drag and lowering the lift.
 
In applying shock expansion theory, one examines each surface turning angle to 
see whether it is an expansion (“opening up”) or compression (obstruction) to the 
surface fl ow. Figure 9.27a shows a fl at-plate foil at an angle of attack. There is a 
leading-edge shock on the lower edge with fl ow defl ection θ 5 α, while the upper 
edge has an expansion fan with increasing Prandtl-Meyer angle Dω 5 α. We compute 
p3 with expansion theory and p2 with oblique shock theory. The force on the plate is 
thus F 5 (p2 2 p3)Cb, where C is the chord length and b the span width (assuming 
no wingtip effects). This force is normal to the plate, and thus the lift force normal 
to the stream is L 5 F cos α, and the drag parallel to the stream is D 5 F sin α. 
The dimensionless coeffi cients CL and CD have the same defi nitions as in low-speed 
fl ow, Eqs. (7.66), except that the perfect-gas law identity 1
2ρV2 ; 1
2 kp Ma2 is very 
useful here:

(9.102)

9.10  Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Waves 657
The typical supersonic lift coeffi cient is much smaller than the subsonic value CL < 2πα, 
but the lift can be very large because of the large value of 1
2 ρV2 at supersonic speeds.
 
At the trailing edge in Fig. 9.27a, a shock and fan appear in reversed positions and 
bend the two fl ows back so that they are parallel in the wake and have the same pressure. 
They do not have quite the same velocity because of the unequal shock strengths on the 
upper and lower surfaces; hence a vortex sheet trails behind the wing. This is very interest-
ing, but in the theory you ignore the trailing-edge pattern entirely, since it does not affect 
the surface pressures: The supersonic surface fl ow cannot “hear” the wake disturbances.
 
The diamond foil in Fig. 9.27b adds two more wave patterns to the fl ow. At this 
particular α less than the diamond half-angle, there are leading-edge shocks on both 
surfaces, the upper shock being much weaker. Then there are expansion fans on each 
shoulder of the diamond: The Prandtl-Meyer angle change Dω equals the sum of the 
leading-edge and trailing-edge diamond half-angles. Finally, the trailing-edge pattern 
is similar to that of the fl at plate (9.27a) and can be ignored in the calculation. Both 
lower-surface pressures p2 and p4 are greater than their upper counterparts, and the 
lift is nearly that of the fl at plate. There is an additional drag due to thickness because 
p4 and p5 on the trailing surfaces are lower than their counterparts p2 and p3. The 
diamond drag is greater than the fl at-plate drag, but this must be endured in practice 
to achieve a wing structure strong enough to support these forces.

658 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
 
The theory sketched in Fig. 9.27 is in good agreement with measured supersonic 
lift and drag as long as the Reynolds number is not too small (thick boundary layers) 
and the Mach number not too large (hypersonic fl ow). It turns out that for large ReC 
and moderate supersonic Ma` the boundary layers are thin and separation seldom 
occurs, so that the shock expansion theory, although frictionless, is quite successful. 
Let us look now at an example.

A fl at-plate airfoil with C 5 2 m is immersed at α 5 88 in a stream with Ma` 5 2.5 and 
p` 5 100 kPa. Compute (a) CL and (b) CD, and compare with low-speed airfoils. Compute 
(c) lift and (d ) drag in newtons per unit span width.
Solution
Instead of using a lot of space outlining the detailed oblique shock and Prandtl-Meyer 
expansion computations, we list all pertinent results in Fig. E9.19 on the upper and lower 
surfaces. Using the theories of Secs. 9.9 and 9.10, you should verify every single one of 
the calculations in Fig. E9.19 to make sure that all details of shock expansion theory are 
well understood.

Notice that this supersonic theory predicts a fi nite drag in spite of assuming frictionless 
fl ow with infi nite wing aspect ratio. This is called wave drag, and we see that the d’Alembert 
paradox of zero body drag does not occur in supersonic fl ow.
Thin-Airfoil Theory
 
In spite of the simplicity of the fl at-plate geometry, the calculations in Example 9.19 
were laborious. In 1925 Ackeret [28] developed simple yet effective expressions for 
the lift, drag, and center of pressure of supersonic airfoils, assuming small thickness 
and angle of attack.
 
The theory is based on the linearized expression (9.89), where tan θ < surface 
defl ection relative to the free stream and condition 1 is the free stream, Ma1 5 Ma`. 
For the fl at-plate airfoil, the total force F is based on

Substitution into Eq. (9.102) gives the linearized lift coeffi cient for a supersonic fl at-
plate airfoil:

(9.104)
Computations for diamond and other fi nite-thickness airfoils show no fi rst-order effect 
of thickness on lift. Therefore, Eq. (9.104) is valid for any sharp-edged supersonic thin 
airfoil at a small angle of attack.
 
The fl at-plate drag coeffi cient is
 
CD 5 CL tan α < CLα <

(9.105)
However, the thicker airfoils have additional thickness drag. Let the chord line of the 
airfoil be the x axis, and let the upper-surface shape be denoted by yu(x) and the lower 
profi le by yl(x). Then the complete Ackeret drag theory (see Ref. 5, Sec. 14.6, for 
details) shows that the additional drag depends on the mean square of the slopes of 
the upper and lower surfaces, defi ned by

These are all in reasonable agreement with more exact computations, and their extreme 
simplicity makes them attractive alternatives to the laborious but accurate shock 
expansion theory. Consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 9.20
Repeat parts (a) and (b) of Example 9.19, using the linearized Ackeret theory.
Solution
From Eqs. (9.104) and (9.105) we have, for Ma` 5 2.5 and α 5 88 5 0.1396 rad,
 
CL <

(2.52 2 1)1/2 5 0.244    CD 5 4(0.1396)2
(2.52 2 1)1/2 5 0.034 
Ans.
These are less than 3 percent lower than the more exact computations of Example 9.19.
 
A further result of the Ackeret linearized theory is an expression for the position 
xCP of the center of pressure (CP) of the force distribution on the wing:
 
xCP
C 5 0.5 1 Su 2 Sl
2αC2  
(9.108)
where Su is the cross-sectional area between the upper surface and the chord and Sl 
is the area between the chord and the lower surface. For a symmetric airfoil (Sl 5 Su) 
we obtain xCP at the half-chord point, in contrast with the low-speed airfoil result, 
where xCP is at the quarter-chord.
 
The difference in diffi culty between the simple Ackeret theory and shock expansion 
theory is even greater for a thick airfoil, as the following example shows.
EXAMPLE 9.21
By analogy with Example 9.19 analyze a diamond, or double-wedge, airfoil of 28 half-angle 
and C 5 2 m at α 5 88 and Ma` 5 2.5. Compute CL and CD by (a) shock expansion 
theory and (b) Ackeret theory. Pinpoint the difference from Example 9.19.
Solution
Part (a) 
Again we omit the details of shock expansion theory and simply list the properties computed on 
each of the four airfoil surfaces in Fig. E9.21. Assume p` 5 100 kPa. There are both a force F 
normal to the chord line and a force P parallel to the chord. For the normal force the pressure 
difference on the front half is p2 2 p3 5 186.4 2 65.9 5 120.5 kPa, and on the rear half it is p4 2 
p5 5 146.9 2 48.8 5 98.1 kPa. The average pressure difference is 1
2(120.5 1 98.1) 5 109.3 kPa, 
so that the normal force is
F 5 (109.3 kPa)(2 m2) 5 218.6 kN

For the chordwise force P the pressure difference on the top half is p3 2 p5 5 65.9 2 48.8 5 
17.1 kPa, and on the bottom half it is p2 2 p4 5 186.4 2 146.9 5 39.5 kPa. The average dif-
ference is 1
2(17.1 1 39.5) 5 28.3 kPa, which when multiplied by the frontal area (maximum

This is 2 percent lower than shock expansion theory predicts. We could judge Ackeret theory 
to be “satisfactory.” Ackeret theory predicts p2 5 167 kPa (211 percent), p3 5 60 kPa (29 
percent), p4 5 140 kPa (25 percent), and p5 5 33 kPa (26 percent).

662 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Three-Dimensional Supersonic 
Flow
 
We have gone about as far as we can go in an introductory treatment of compressible 
fl ow. Of course, there is much more, and you are invited to study further in the refer-
ences at the end of the chapter.
 
Three-dimensional supersonic fl ows are highly complex, especially if they concern 
blunt bodies, which therefore contain embedded regions of subsonic and transonic 
fl ow, as in Fig. 9.10. Some fl ows, however, yield to accurate theoretical treatment 
such as fl ow past a cone at zero incidence, as shown in Fig. 9.28. The exact theory 
of cone fl ow is discussed in advanced texts [for example, Ref. 5, Chap. 17], and 
extensive tables of such solutions have been published [25]. There are similarities 
between cone fl ow and the wedge fl ows illustrated in Fig. 9.22: an attached oblique 
shock, a thin turbulent boundary layer, and an expansion fan at the rear corner. How-
ever, the conical shock defl ects the fl ow through an angle less than the cone half-angle, 
unlike  the wedge shock. As in the wedge fl ow, there is a maximum cone angle above 
which the shock must detach, as in Fig. 9.22b. For k 5 1.4 and Ma∞ 5 ∞, the maxi-
mum cone half-angle for an attached shock is about 578, compared with the maximum 
wedge angle of 45.68 (see Ref. 25).
 
The use of computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) is now very popular and successful 
in compressible fl ow studies [13]. For example, a supersonic cone fl ow such as Fig. 
9.28, even at an angle of attack, can be solved by numerical simulation of the full 
three-dimensional (viscous) Navier-Stokes equations [26].
Fig. 9.28 Shadowgraph of fl ow past 
an 88 half-angle cone at Ma` 5 2.0. 
The turbulent boundary layer is 
clearly visible. The Mach lines 
curve slightly, and the Mach 
number varies from 1.98 just inside 
the shock to 1.90 at the surface.

9.10  Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Waves 663
 
For more complicated body shapes one usually resorts to experimentation in a 
supersonic wind tunnel. Figure 9.29 shows a wind tunnel study of supersonic fl ow 
past a model of an interceptor aircraft. The many junctions and wingtips and shape 
changes make theoretical analysis very diffi cult. Here the surface fl ow patterns, 
which indicate boundary layer development and regions of fl ow separation, have 
been visualized by the smearing of oil drops placed on the model surface before 
the test.
 
As we shall see in the next chapter, there is an interesting analogy between gas 
dynamic shock waves and the surface water waves that form in an open-channel fl ow. 
Chapter 11 of Ref. 9 explains how a water channel can be used in an inexpensive 
simulation of supersonic fl ow experiments.
New Trends in Aeronautics
 
The previous edition of this text discussed NASA’s proposed hypersonic scramjet 
aircraft, the X-43A [30], which set a new world speed record, in 2004, of Mach 9.6, 
or nearly 7000 miles per hour. This is hardly a design for a hypersonic airliner, 
though, since it has to be launched at high altitude from a B-52 bomber.
 
Also discussed earlier was the Air Force X-35 Joint Strike Fighter, whose wind 
tunnel test is shown here in Figure 9.19. This design is now operational, designated 
as the F-35, seen in Fig. 9.30, and it has been ordered by the U.S. military and also 
by Australia and seven NATO countries. A special version, for the U.S. Marine Corps, 
takes off and lands vertically. It reaches a speed of Mach 1.6 at 40,000 ft altitude. Its 
shortcomings are the present poor world economy and the fact that the price of one 
F-35 has risen to 220 million dollars.

664 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
Summary
 
This chapter briefl y introduced a very broad subject, compressible fl ow, sometimes 
called gas dynamics. The primary parameter is the Mach number Ma 5 V/a, which 
is large and causes the fl uid density to vary signifi cantly. This means that the continu-
ity and momentum equations must be coupled to the energy relation and the equation 
of state to solve for the four unknowns (p, ρ, T, V).
 
The chapter reviewed the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas and derived 
a formula for the speed of sound of a fl uid. The analysis was then simplifi ed to 
one-dimensional steady adiabatic fl ow without shaft work, for which the stagnation 
enthalpy of the gas is constant. A further simplifi cation to isentropic fl ow enables 
formulas to be derived for high-speed gas fl ow in a variable-area duct. This reveals 
the phenomenon of sonic-fl ow choking (maximum mass fl ow) in the throat of a nozzle.

United States. [Lockheed Martin photo provided by F-35 Lightning II Program Offi ce.]

Introduction
P9.1 
An ideal gas fl ows adiabatically through a duct. At sec-
tion 1, p1 5 140 kPa, T1 5 2608C, and V1 5 75 m/s. Farther 
downstream, p2 5 30 kPa and T2 5 2078C. Calculate V2 in 
m/s and s2 2 s1 in J/(kg ? K) if the gas is (a) air, k 5 1.4, 
and (b) argon, k 5 1.67.
P9.2 
Solve Prob. P9.1 if the gas is steam. Use two approaches: 
(a) an ideal gas from Table A.4 and (b) real gas data from 
the steam tables [15].
P9.3 
If 8 kg of oxygen in a closed tank at 2008C and 300 kPa is 
heated until the pressure rises to 400 kPa, calculate (a) the 
new temperature, (b) the total heat transfer, and (c) the 
change in entropy.
P9.4 
Consider steady adiabatic airfl ow in a duct. At section B, 
the pressure is 600 kPa and the temperature is 1778C. At 
section D, the density is 1.13 kg/m3 and the temperature is 
1568C. (a) Find the entropy change, if any. (b) Which way 
is the air fl owing?
P9.5 
Steam enters a nozzle at 3778C, 1.6 MPa, and a steady 
speed of 200 m/s and accelerates isentropically until it exits 
at saturation conditions. Estimate the exit velocity and 
 temperature.
P9.6 
Methane, approximated as a perfect gas, is compressed 
adiabatically from 101 kPa and 208C to 300 kPa. Estimate 
(a) the fi nal temperature, and (b) the fi nal density.
P9.7 
Air fl ows through a variable-area duct. At section 1, A1 5 
20 cm2, p1 5 300 kPa, ρ1 5 1.75 kg/m3, and V1 5 122.5 m/s. 
At section 2, the area is exactly the same, but the density is 
much lower: ρ2 5 0.266 kg/m3 and T2 5 281 K. There is no 
transfer of work or heat. Assume one-dimensional steady fl ow. 
(a) How can you reconcile these differences? (b) Find the mass 
fl ow at section 2. Calculate (c) V2, (d ) p2, and (e) s2 2 s1. 
[Hint: This problem requires the continuity equation.]
P9.8 
Atmospheric air at 208C enters and fi lls an insulated tank that 
is initially evacuated. Using a control volume analysis from 
Eq. (3.67), compute the tank air temperature when it is full.
P9.9 
Liquid hydrogen and oxygen are burned in a combustion 
chamber and fed through a rocket nozzle that exhausts at 
Vexit 5 1600 m/s to an ambient pressure of 54 kPa. The 
nozzle exit diameter is 45 cm, and the jet exit density is 
0.15 kg/m3. If the exhaust gas has a molecular weight of 18, 
estimate (a) the exit gas temperature, (b) the mass fl ow, and 
(c) the thrust developed by the rocket.
The speed of sound
P9.10 A certain aircraft fl ies at 609 mi/h at standard sea level. 
(a) What is its Mach number? (b) If it fl ies at the same 
Mach number at 34,000 ft altitude, how much slower (or 
faster) is it fl ying, in mi/h?
At supersonic velocities there is the possibility of a normal shock wave, where the 
gas discontinuously reverts to subsonic conditions. The normal shock explains the 
effect of back pressure on the performance of converging–diverging nozzles.
 
To illustrate nonisentropic fl ow conditions, the chapter briefl y focused on constant-
area duct fl ow with friction and with heat transfer, both of which lead to choking of 
the exit fl ow.
 
The chapter ended with a discussion of two-dimensional supersonic fl ow, where 
oblique shock waves and Prandtl-Meyer (isentropic) expansion waves appear. With a 
proper combination of shocks and expansions one can analyze supersonic airfoils.

666 Chapter 9 Compressible Flow
P9.11 At 3008C and 1 atm, estimate the speed of sound of 
(a)   nitrogen, (b) hydrogen, (c) helium, (d ) steam, and 
(e) 238UF6 (k < 1.06).
P9.12 Assume that water follows Eq. (1.19) with n < 7 and B <

sound (in m/s) at (a) 1 atm and (b) 1100 atm (the deepest 
part of the ocean). (c) Compute the speed of sound at 208C 
and 9000 atm and compare with the measured value of 
2650 m/s (A. H. Smith and A. W. Lawson, J. Chem. Phys., 
vol. 22, 1954, p. 351).
P9.13 Consider steam at 500 K and 200 kPa. Estimate its speed of 
sound by two different methods: (a) assuming an ideal gas 
from Table B.4, or (b) using fi nite differences for isentro-
pic densities between 210 kPa and 190 kPa.

(b) a free liquid surface.

receives the refl ected wave back from a similar submerged 
object in 15 s. Using Prob. P9.12 as a guide, estimate the 
distance to the other object.

a jet-powered aircraft speed record of 3326 km/h. Estimate 
the temperature, in 8C, at its front stagnation point. At what 
Mach number would it have a front stagnation-point tem-
perature of 5008C?
P9.20 Air fl ows isentropically in a channel. Properties at sec-
tion 1 are V1 5 250 m/s, T1 5 330 K, and p1 5 80 kPa. At 
section 2 downstream, the temperature has dropped to 08C. 
Find (a) the pressure, (b) velocity, and (c) Mach number at 
section 2.
P9.21 N2O expands isentropically through a duct from p1 5 
200 kPa and T1 5 2508C to a downstream section where 
p2 5 26 kPa and V2 5 594 m/s. Compute (a) T2; (b) Ma2;

is 40 kPa. What is the Mach number Ma2 if the gas is 
(a) air, (b) argon, or (c) CH4? (d ) Can you tell, without 
calculating, which gas will be the coldest at point 2?

(b) Suppose that a pitot-static tube in air measures the pres-

P9.38 Prob. P9.37 makes an ideal senior project or combined 
laboratory and computer problem, as described in Ref. 
27, Sec. 8.6. In Bober and Kenyon’s lab experiment, the 
tank had a volume of 0.0352 ft3 and was initially fi lled 
with air at 50 lb/in2 gage and 728F. Atmospheric pressure 
was 14.5 lb/in2 absolute, and the nozzle exit diameter was 
0.05 in. After 2 s of blowdown, the measured tank pres-

P9.42 A bicycle tire is fi lled with air at an absolute pressure of

the valve breaks, and air starts to exhaust out of the tire 
into  the atmosphere (pa 5 100 kPa absolute and Ta 5 
20.08C). The valve exit is 2.00 mm in diameter and is the 
smallest cross-sectional area of the entire system. Fric-

pic fl ow is a reasonable assumption. (a) Find the Mach 
number, velocity, and temperature at the exit plane of the 
valve (initially). (b) Find the initial mass fl ow rate out of 
the tire. (c) Estimate the velocity at the exit plane using the

P9.44 In Prob. P3.34 we knew nothing about compressible fl ow 
at the time, so we merely assumed exit conditions p2 and T2 
and computed V2 as an application of the continuity equa-
tion. Suppose that the throat diameter is 3 in. For the given 
stagnation conditions in the rocket chamber in Fig. P3.34 
and  assuming k 5 1.4 and a molecular weight of 26, com-

cording to one-dimensional theory. If pa 5 14.7 lbf/in2

P3.68. This thrust is entirely independent of the stagnation 
temperature (check this by changing T0 to 20008R if you 
like). Why?

(a)  the throat area, (b) the stagnation temperature, and 
(c) the mass fl ow.

Rayleigh fl ow, and a line representing all possible property 
changes on a temperature–entropy chart is called a Rayleigh 
line. Assuming air passing through the fl ow state p1 5 
548 kPa, T1 5 588 K, V1 5 266 m/s, and A 5 1 m2, draw a

The converging–diverging nozzle sketched in Fig. C9.1 is 
designed to have a Mach number of 2.00 at the exit plane 
(assuming the fl ow remains nearly isentropic). The fl ow trav-
els from tank a to tank b, where tank a is much larger than 
tank b. (a) Find the area at the exit Ae and the back pressure 
pb that will allow the system to operate at design conditions. 
(b) As time goes on, the back pressure will grow, since the 
second tank slowly fi lls up with more air. Since tank a is 
huge, the fl ow in the nozzle will remain the same, however, 
until a normal shock wave appears at the exit plane. At what 
back pressure will this occur? (c) If tank b is held at constant 
temperature, T 5 208C, estimate how long it will take for the

It is desired to select a rectangular wing for a fi ghter 
 aircraft. The plane must be able (a) to take off and land 
on a 4500-ft-long sea-level runway and (b) to cruise 
 supersonically at Ma 5 2.3 at 28,000-ft altitude. For 
simplicity, assume a wing with zero sweepback. Let the 
aircraft maximum weight equal (30 1 n)(1000) lbf, 
where n is the number of letters in your surname. Let the 
available sea-level maximum thrust be one-third of the 
maximum weight, decreasing at altitude proportional to 
ambient density. Making suitable assumptions about the 
effect of fi nite aspect ratio on wing lift and drag for both 
subsonic and supersonic fl ight, select a wing of mini-
mum area suffi cient to perform these takeoff/landing and 
cruise requirements. Some thought should be given to 
analyzing the wingtips and wing roots in supersonic 
fl ight, where Mach cones form and the fl ow is not two-
dimensional. If no satisfactory solution is possible, grad-
ually increase the available thrust to converge to an 
acceptable design.
D9.2 
Consider supersonic fl ow of air at sea-level conditions 
past a wedge of half-angle θ, as shown in Fig. D9.2. 
 Assume that the pressure on the back of the wedge equals 
the fl uid pressure as it exits the Prandtl-Meyer fan. 
(a) Suppose Ma` 5 3.0. For what angle θ will the super-
sonic wave drag  coefficient CD, based on frontal area, be 
exactly 0.5? (b) Suppose that θ 5 208. Is there a free-
stream Mach number for which the wave drag coeffi -
cient CD, based on frontal area, will be exactly 0.5? 
(c)  Investigate the percentage  increase in CD from 
(a) and (b) due to including boundary layer friction drag 
in the calculation.

Use the stagnation pressure data to estimate the local Mach

number. What is the probable reason?

Engineers call the supersonic combustion in a scramjet 
 engine almost miraculous, “like lighting a match in a hur-
ricane.” Figure C9.8 is a crude idealization of the engine. 
Air enters, burns fuel in the narrow section, then exits, all at 
supersonic speeds. There are no shock waves. Assume ar-
eas of 1 m2 at sections 1 and 4 and 0.2 m2 at sections 2 and 
3. Let the entrance conditions be Ma1 5 6, at 10,000 m 
standard altitude. Assume isentropic fl ow from 1 to 2, 
 frictionless heat transfer from 2 to 3 with Q 5 500 kJ/kg, 
and isentropic fl ow from 3 to 4. Calculate the exit condi-
tions and the thrust produced.

In March of 2010, the normally placid Saugatucket River, in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, 
was fl ooded by heavy rains. Instead of its usual gentle trickle over the Main Street dam, the 
fl ow rate was enormously increased and fl ooded the medical building in the background, ruin-
ing their offi ces and X-ray machines. The open-channel fl ow analysis methods in this chapter 
can handle both the trickle and the fl ood. [Photo courtesy of Independent Newspapers]

Chapter 10
Open-Channel Flow
Motivation. An open-channel fl ow denotes a fl ow with a free surface touching an 
atmosphere, like a river or a canal or a fl ume. Closed-duct fl ows (Chap. 6) are full 
of fl uid, either liquid or gas, have no free surface within, and are driven by a pressure 
gradient along the duct axis. The open-channel fl ows here are driven by gravity alone, 
and the pressure gradient at the atmospheric interface is negligible. The basic force 
balance in an open channel is between gravity and friction.
 
Open-channel fl ows are an especially important mode of fl uid mechanics for civil 
and environmental engineers. One needs to predict the fl ow rates and water depths 
that result from a given channel geometry, whether natural or artifi cial, and a given 
wet-surface roughness. Water is almost always the relevant fl uid, and the channel size 
is usually large. Thus open-channel fl ows are generally turbulent, three-dimensional, 
sometimes unsteady, and often quite complex. This chapter presents some simple 
engineering theories and experimental correlations for steady fl ow in straight channels 
of regular geometry. We can borrow and use some concepts from duct fl ow analysis: 
hydraulic radius, friction factor, and head losses.
10.1 Introduction
 
Simply stated, open-channel fl ow is the fl ow of a liquid in a conduit with a free 
surface. There are many practical examples, both artifi cial (fl umes, spillways, canals, 
weirs, drainage ditches, culverts) and natural (streams, rivers, estuaries, fl oodplains). 
This chapter introduces the elementary analysis of such fl ows, which are dominated 
by the effects of gravity.
 
The presence of the free surface, which is essentially at atmospheric pressure, both 
helps and hurts the analysis. It helps because the pressure can be taken as constant 
along the free surface, which therefore is equivalent to the hydraulic grade line (HGL) 
of the fl ow. Unlike fl ow in closed ducts, the pressure gradient is not a direct factor 
in open-channel fl ow, where the balance of forces is confi ned to gravity and friction.1 
But the free surface complicates the analysis because its shape is a priori unknown: 
1Surface tension is rarely important because open channels are normally quite large and have a very 
large Weber number. Surface tension affects small models of large channels.

684 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
The depth profi le changes with conditions and must be computed as part of the prob-
lem, especially in unsteady problems involving wave motion.
 
Before proceeding, we remark, as usual, that whole books have been written on 
open-channel hydraulics [1 to 7, 32]. There are also specialized texts devoted to wave 
motion [8 to 10] and to engineering aspects of coastal free-surface fl ows [11 to 13]. 
This chapter is only an introduction to broader and more detailed treatments. The 
writer recommends, as an occasional break from free-surface fl ow analysis, Ref. 31, 
which is an enchanting and spectacular gallery of ocean wave photographs.
The One-Dimensional 
Approximation
 
An open channel always has two sides and a bottom, where the fl ow satisfi es the 
no-slip condition. Therefore, even a straight channel has a three-dimensional velocity 
distribution. Some measurements of straight-channel velocity contours are shown in 
Fig. 10.1. The profi les are quite complex, with maximum velocity typically occurring 
in the midplane about 20 percent below the surface. In very broad shallow channels 
the maximum velocity is near the surface, and the velocity profi le is nearly logarithmic 
from the bottom to the free surface, as in Eq. (6.62). In noncircular channels there 
are also secondary motions similar to Fig. 6.16 for closed-duct fl ows. If the channel 
curves or meanders, the secondary motion intensifi es due to centrifugal effects, with 
high velocity occurring near the outer radius of the bend. Curved natural channels are 
subject to strong bottom erosion and deposition effects.
 
With the advent of the supercomputer, it is possible to make numerical simulations 
of complex fl ow patterns such as those in Fig. 10.1 [27, 28]. However, the practical 
engineering approach, used here, is to make a one-dimensional fl ow approximation, 
as in Fig. 10.2. Since the liquid density is nearly constant, the steady fl ow continuity 
equation reduces to constant-volume fl ow Q along the channel
Q 5 V(x)A(x) 5 const 
(10.1)
where V is average velocity and A the local cross-sectional area, as sketched in Fig. 10.2.
 
A second one-dimensional relation between velocity and channel geometry is the 
energy equation, including friction losses. If points 1 (upstream) and 2 (downstream) 
are on the free surface, p1 5 p2 5 pa, and we have, for steady fl ow,

(10.2)
where z denotes the total elevation of the free surface, which includes the water depth

analogous to head loss in duct fl ow from Eq. (6.10):

The local Reynolds number of the channel would be Re 5 VRh/ν, which is usually 
highly turbulent (.1 E5). The only commonly occurring laminar channel fl ows are 
the thin sheets that form as rainwater drains from crowned streets and airport 
runways.
 
The wetted perimeter P (see Fig. 10.2b) includes the sides and bottom of the chan-
nel but not the free surface and, of course, not the parts of the sides above the water 
level. For example, if a rectangular channel is b wide and h high and contains water 
to depth y, its wetted perimeter is
P 5 b 1 2y
not 2b 1 2h.
 
Although the Moody chart (Fig. 6.13) would give a good estimate of the friction 
factor in channel fl ow, in practice it is seldom used. An alternative correlation due to 
Robert Manning, discussed in Sec. 10.2, is the formula of choice in open-channel 
hydraulics.
Flow Classifi cation by Depth 
Variation
 
The most common method of classifying open-channel fl ows is by the rate of change 
of the free-surface depth. The simplest and most widely analyzed case is uniform fl ow, 
where the depth and area (hence the velocity in steady fl ow) remain constant. Uniform 
fl ow conditions are approximated by long, straight runs of constant-slope and constant-
area channel. A channel in uniform fl ow is said to be moving at its normal depth yn, 
which is an important design parameter.
 
If the channel slope or cross section changes or there is an obstruction in the fl ow, 
then the depth changes and the fl ow is said to be varied. The fl ow is gradually vary-
ing if the one-dimensional approximation is valid and rapidly varying if not. Some 
examples of this method of classifi cation are shown in Fig. 10.3. The classes can be 
summarized as follows:
1. Uniform fl ow (constant depth and slope)
2. Varied fl ow:
a. Gradually varied (one-dimensional)
b. Rapidly varied (multidimensional)

10.1  Introduction 687
Typically uniform fl ow is separated from rapidly varying fl ow by a region of gradu-
ally varied fl ow. Gradually varied fl ow can be analyzed by a fi rst-order differential 
equation (Sec. 10.6), but rapidly varying fl ow usually requires experimentation or 
three-dimensional computational fl uid dynamics [14, 27, 28].
Flow Classifi cation by 
Froude Number
 
A second and very useful classifi cation of open-channel fl ow is by the dimensionless 
Froude number, Fr, which is the ratio of channel velocity to the speed of propagation 
of a small-disturbance wave in the channel. For a rectangular or very wide constant-
depth channel, this takes the form
 
Fr 5
flow velocity
surface wave speed 5
V
1gy 
(10.5)
where y is the water depth. The fl ow behaves differently depending on these three 
fl ow regimes:
 Fr , 1.0    subcritical flow
 
 Fr 5 1.0    critical flow
 
(10.6)
 Fr . 1.0    supercritical flow
The Froude number for irregular channels is defi ned in Sec. 10.4. As mentioned in 
Sec. 9.10, there is a strong analogy here with the three compressible fl ow regimes of 
the Mach number: subsonic (Ma , 1), sonic (Ma 5 1), and supersonic (Ma . 1). 
We shall use the analogy in Secs. 10.4 and 10.5. The analogy is pursued in Ref. 21.
Surface Wave Speed
 
The Froude number denominator (gy)1/2 is the speed of an infi nitesimal shallow-water 
surface wave. We can derive this with reference to Fig. 10.4a, which shows a wave 
of height δy propagating at speed c into still liquid. To achieve a steady fl ow inertial 
frame of reference, we fi x the coordinates on the wave as in Fig. 10.4b, so that the 
still water moves to the right at velocity c. Figure 10.4 is exactly analogous to Fig. 9.1, 
which analyzed the speed of sound in a fl uid. It can be used to analyze tidal bores, 
Fig. P10.86, which are described by Chanson [34].

For the control volume of Fig. 10.4b, the one-dimensional continuity relation is, 
for channel width b,

or 
δV 5 c

y 1 δy 
(10.7)
This is analogous to Eq. (9.10); the velocity change δV induced by a surface wave is 
small if the wave is “weak,” δy ! y. If we neglect bottom friction in the short dis-
tance across the wave in Fig. 10.4b, the momentum relation is a balance between the 
net hydrostatic pressure force and momentum:

(10.8)
This is analogous to Eq. (9.12). By eliminating δV between Eqs. (10.7) and (10.8) we 
obtain the desired expression for wave propagation speed:
c2 5 gy a1 1 δy
y b a1 1

(10.9)
The “stronger” the wave height δy, the faster the wave speed c, by analogy with 
Eq. (9.13). In the limit of an infi nitesimal wave height δy → 0, the speed becomes
c2
0 5 gy  
(10.10)
This is the surface-wave equivalent of fl uid sound speed a, and thus the Froude 
 number in channel fl ow Fr 5 V/c0 is the analog of the Mach number. For y 5 1 m, 
co 5 3.1 m/s.
 
As in gas dynamics, a channel fl ow can accelerate from subcritical to critical to 
supercritical fl ow and then return to subcritical fl ow through a sort of normal shock 
called a hydraulic jump (Sec. 10.5). This is illustrated in Fig. 10.5. The fl ow upstream 
of the sluice gate is subcritical. It then accelerates to critical and supercritical fl ow as 
it passes under the gate, which serves as a sort of “nozzle.” Further downstream the

10.2  Uniform Flow; The Chézy Formula  689
fl ow “shocks” back to subcritical fl ow because the downstream “receiver” height is 
too high to maintain supercritical fl ow. Note the similarity with the nozzle gas fl ows 
of Fig. 9.12.
 
The critical depth yc 5 [Q2/(b2g)]1/3 is sketched as a dashed line in Fig. 10.5 for 
reference. Like the normal depth yn, yc is an important parameter in characterizing 
open-channel fl ow (see Sec. 10.4).
 
An excellent discussion of the various regimes of open-channel fl ow is given in 
Ref. 15.
10.2 Uniform Flow; 
The Chézy Formula
 
Uniform fl ow can occur in long, straight runs of constant slope and constant channel 
cross section. The water depth is constant at y 5 yn, and the velocity is constant at 
V 5 V0. Let the slope be S0 5 tan θ, where θ is the angle the bottom makes with the 
horizontal, considered positive for downhill fl ow. Then Eq. (10.2), with V1 5 V2 5 V0, 
becomes
 
hf 5 z1 2 z2 5 S0L 
(10.11)
where L is the horizontal distance between sections 1 and 2. The head loss thus bal-
ances the loss in height of the channel. The fl ow is essentially fully developed, so the 
Darcy-Weisbach relation, Eq. (6.10), holds
 
hf 5 f L
Dh
  V 2

2g
    Dh 5 4Rh 
(10.12)
with Dh 5 4A/P used to accommodate noncircular channels. The geometry and 
 notation for open-channel fl ow analysis are shown in Fig. 10.2.
 
By combining Eqs. (10.11) and (10.12) we obtain an expression for fl ow velocity 
in uniform channel fl ow:
 
V0 5 a8g
f b
1/2
Rh
1/2S1/2
0
 
(10.13)
For a given channel shape and bottom roughness, the quantity (8g/f )1/2 is constant 
and can be denoted by C. Equation (10.13) becomes
 
V0 5 C(RhS0)1/2  Q 5 CA(RhS0)1/2  τavg 5 ρgRhS0 
(10.14)
These are called the Chézy formulas, fi rst developed by the French engineer Antoine 
Chézy in conjunction with his experiments on the Seine River and the Courpalet 
Canal  in 1769. The quantity C, called the Chézy coeffi cient, varies from about 
60  ft1/2/s  for small, rough channels to 160 ft1/2/s for large, smooth channels (30 to 
90 m1/2/s in SI units).
 
Over the past century a great deal of hydraulics research [16] has been devoted to 
the correlation of the Chézy coeffi cient with the roughness, shape, and slope of vari-
ous open channels. Correlations are due to Ganguillet and Kutter in 1869, Manning 
in 1889, Bazin in 1897, and Powell in 1950 [16]. All these formulations are discussed 
in delicious detail in Ref. 2, Chap. 5. Here we confi ne our treatment to Manning’s 
correlation, the most popular.

EXAMPLE 10.1
A straight rectangular channel is 6 ft wide and 3 ft deep and laid on a slope of 28. The 
friction factor is 0.022. Estimate the uniform fl ow rate in cubic feet per second.
Solution
• System sketch: The channel cross section is shown in Fig. E10.1.
• Assumptions: Steady, uniform channel fl ow with θ 5 28.

• Property values: Please note that there are no fl uid physical properties involved in the 
Chézy formula. Can you explain this?

• Comments: Uniform fl ow estimates are straightforward if the geometry is simple. Results are 
independent of water density and viscosity because the fl ow is fully rough and driven by grav-
ity. Note the high fl ow rate, larger than some rivers. Two degrees is a substantial channel slope.
The Manning Roughness 
Correlation
 
The most fundamentally sound approach to the Chézy formula is to use Eq. (10.13) 
with f estimated from the Moody friction factor chart, Fig. 6.13. Indeed, the open-
channel research establishment [18] strongly recommends use of the friction factor in 
all calculations. Since typical channels are large and rough, we would generally use 
the fully rough turbulent fl ow limit of Eq. (6.48)
 
f < a2.0 log 14.8Rh
ε
b
22
 
(10.15)
where ε is the roughness height, with typical values listed in Table 10.1.
 
In spite of the attractiveness of this friction factor approach, most engineers prefer 
to use a simple (dimensional) correlation published in 1891 by Robert Manning [17], 
an Irish engineer. In tests with real channels, Manning found that the Chézy coeffi -
cient  C increased approximately as the sixth root of the channel size. He proposed 
the simple formula
 
C 5 a8g
f b

< α R1/6

n  
(10.16)
where n is a roughness parameter. Since the formula is clearly not dimensionally 
consistent, it requires a conversion factor α that changes with the system of units used:
 
α 5 1.0  SI units     α 5 1.486  BG units

scale: In BG units, α 5 (3.2808 ft/m)1/3 5 1.486.2

Table 10.1 Experimental Values of

2An interesting discussion of the history and “dimensionality” of Manning’s formula is given in 
Ref. 2, pp. 98–99.

692 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
The channel slope S0 is dimensionless, and n is taken to be the same in both systems. 
The volume fl ow rate simply multiplies this result by the area:
Uniform fl ow: 
Q 5 V0 A < α
n ARh
2/3S1/2
0
 
(10.19)
 
Experimental values of n (and the corresponding roughness height) are listed in Table 
10.1 for various channel surfaces. There is a factor-of-15 variation from a smooth glass 
surface (n < 0.01) to a tree-lined fl oodplain (n < 0.15). Due to the irregularity of 
typical channel shapes and roughness, the scatter bands in Table 10.1 should be taken 
seriously. For routine calculations, always use the average roughness in Table 10.1.
 
Since Manning’s sixth-root size variation is not exact, real channels can have a 
variable n depending on the water depth. The Mississippi River near Memphis, 
 Tennessee, has n < 0.032 at 40-ft fl ood depth, 0.030 at normal 20-ft depth, and 0.040 
at 5-ft low-stage depth. Seasonal vegetative growth and factors such as bottom erosion 
can also affect the value of n. Even nearly identical man-made channels can vary. 
Brater et al. [19] report that U.S. Bureau of Reclamation tests, on large concrete-lined 
canals, yielded values of n ranging from 0.012 to 0.017.
EXAMPLE 10.2
Engineers fi nd that the most effi cient rectangular channel (maximum uniform fl ow for a 
given area) fl ows at a depth equal to half the bottom width. Consider a rectangular brickwork 
channel laid on a slope of 0.006. What is the best bottom width for a fl ow rate of 100 ft3/s?
Solution
• Assumptions: Uniform fl ow in a straight channel of constant of slope S 5 0.006.
• Approach: Use the Manning formula in English units, Eq. (10.19), to predict the fl ow rate.
• Property values: For brickwork, from Table 10.1, the roughness factor n < 0.015.
• Solution: For bottom width b, take the water depth to be y 5 b/2. Equation (10.19)

• Comments: The Manning approach is simple and effective. The Moody friction factor 
method, Eq. (10.14), requires laborious iteration and leads to a result b < 4.81 ft.
Normal Depth Estimates
 
With water depth y known, the computation of Q is quite straightforward. However, if 
Q is given, the computation of the normal depth yn may require iteration. Since the 
normal depth is a characteristic fl ow parameter, this is an important type of problem.

10.2  Uniform Flow; The Chézy Formula  693
 
The normal depth, yn, is the depth, in uniform fl ow, of the water in a straight, 
constant-area, constant-slope channel. It varies with the fl ow rate and is a useful 
 reference depth, calculated by solving Eq. (10.19) when Q is given.
EXAMPLE 10.3
The asphalt-lined trapezoidal channel in Fig. E10.3 carries 300 ft3/s of water under uniform 
fl ow conditions when S 5 0.0015. What is the normal depth yn?

Solution using Excel
From Table 10.1, for asphalt, n < 0.016. The area and hydraulic radius are functions of yn, 
which is unknown:

One can iterate Eq. (1) by hand laboriously and eventually fi nd yn < 4.6 ft. However, it is a 
good candidate for iteration in Excel. One could iterate the Chézy formula directly and fi nd 
the value of yn that gives a fl ow rate of 300 ft3/s. The writer chose to deal with the rearranged 
version, Eq. (1), guessing values of yn until the left-hand side equals the right-hand side. The 
writer’s fi rst guess was yn 5 10 ft, which was much too deep. Four more guesses achieved 
quite accurate convergence, in the following table:

10.3  Effi cient Uniform-Flow Channels 695
As shown in Fig. 10.6b, the maximum velocity is 14 percent more than the velocity 
when running full, and similarly the maximum discharge is 8 percent more. Since real 
pipes running nearly full tend to have somewhat unstable fl ow, these differences are 
not that signifi cant.
10.3 Effi cient Uniform-Flow 
Channels
 
The engineering design of an open channel has many parameters. If the channel 
 surface can erode or scour, a low-velocity design might be sought. A dirt channel 
could be planted with grass to minimize erosion. For nonerodible surfaces, construc-
tion and lining costs might dominate, suggesting a cross section of minimum wetted 
perimeter. Nonerodible channels can be designed for maximum fl ow.
 
The simplicity of Manning’s formulation (10.19) enables us to analyze channel 
fl ows to determine the most effi cient low-resistance sections for given conditions. The 
most common problem is that of maximizing Rh for a given fl ow area and discharge. 
Since Rh 5 A/P, maximizing Rh for given A is the same as minimizing the wetted 
perimeter P. There is no general solution for arbitrary cross sections, but an analysis 
of the trapezoid section will show the basic results.
 
Consider the generalized symmetric trapezoid of angle θ in Fig. 10.7. For a given 
side angle θ, the fl ow area is
 
A 5 by 1 βy2    β 5 cot θ 
(10.22)
The wetted perimeter is
 
P 5 b 1 2W 5 b 1 2y(1 1 β2)1/2 
(10.23)
Eliminating b between (10.22) and (10.23) gives
 
P 5 A
y 2 βy 1 2y(1 1 β2)1/2 
(10.24)
To minimize P, evaluate dP/dy for constant A and β and set equal to zero. The result is
 
A 5 y232(1 1 β2)1/2 2 β4   P 5 4y(1 1 β2)1/2 2 2βy   Rh 5 1
2y (10.25)
The last result is very interesting: For any angle θ, the most effi cient cross section 
for uniform fl ow occurs when the hydraulic radius is half the depth.
 
Since a rectangle is a trapezoid with β 5 0, the most effi cient rectangular section 
is such that

696 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
To fi nd the correct depth y, these relations must be solved in conjunction with 
 Manning’s fl ow rate formula (10.19) for the given discharge Q.
Best Trapezoid Angle
 
Equations (10.25) are valid for any value of β. What is the best value of β for a given 
depth and area? To answer this question, evaluate dP/dβ from Eq. (10.24) with A and 
y held constant. The result is
2β 5 (1 1 β2)1/2    β 5 cot θ 5 1
31/2
or 
θ 5 60° 
(10.27)
Thus the maximum-fl ow trapezoid section is half a hexagon.
 
Similar calculations with a circular channel section running partially full show best 
effi ciency for a semicircle, y 5 1
2D. In fact, the semicircle is the best of all possible 
channel sections (minimum wetted perimeter for a given fl ow area). The percentage 
improvement over, say, half a hexagon is very slight, however.

area of 3.214 m2.
 
For the half-hexagon (HH), with β 5 1/31/2 5 0.577, Eq. (10.25) predicts
A 5 y2
HH32(1 1 0.5772)1/2 2 0.5774 5 1.732y 2
HH 5 3.214
or yHH 5 1.362 m, whence Rh 5 1

0.015 (3.214)(0.681)2/3(0.001)1/2 5 5.25 m3/s
or about 5 percent more than that for the rectangle.

For a semicircle, A 5 3.214 m2 5 πD2/8, or D 5 2.861 m, whence P 5 1
2πD 5 4.494 m 
and Rh 5 A/P 5 3.214/4.494 5 0.715 m. The semicircle fl ow rate will thus be
Q 5
1.0
0.015 (3.214)(0.715)2/3(0.001)1/2 5 5.42 m3/s
or about 8 percent more than that of the rectangle and 3 percent more than that of the 
 half-hexagon.
10.4 Specifi c Energy; 
Critical Depth
 
The total head of any incompressible fl ow is the sum of its velocity head αV2/(2g), 
pressure head p/γ, and potential head z. For open-channel fl ow, surface pressure is 
everywhere atmospheric, so channel energy is a balance between velocity and  elevation 
head only. Since the fl ow is turbulent, we assume that α < 1—recall Eq. (3.77). The 
fi nal result is the quantity called specifi c energy E, as suggested by Bakhmeteff [1] 
in 1913:
 
E 5 y 1 V 2
2g 
(10.28)
where y is the water depth. It is seen from Fig. 10.8 that E is the height of the 
energy grade line (EGL) above the channel bottom. For a given fl ow rate, there 
are usually two states possible, called alternate states, for the same specifi c 
energy. There is also a minimum energy, Emin, which corresponds to a Froude 
number of unity.

fl ow rate Q has a minimum energy 
corresponding to critical fl ow. For 
energy greater than minimum, there 
are two alternate fl ow states, one 
subcritical and one supercritical.

698 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
Rectangular Channels
 
Consider the possible states at a given location. Let q 5 Q/b 5 Vy be the discharge 
per unit width of a rectangular channel. Then, with q constant, Eq. (10.28) becomes
 
E 5 y 1  q2
2gy2    q 5 Q
b  
(10.29)
Figure 10.8 is a plot of y versus E for constant q from Eq. (10.29). There is a mini-
mum value of E at a certain value of y called the critical depth. By setting dE/dy 5 0 
at constant q, we fi nd that Emin occurs at
 
y 5 yc 5 aq2

(10.30)
The associated minimum energy is
 
Emin 5 E(yc) 5 3
2yc 
(10.31)
 
The depth yc corresponds to channel velocity equal to the shallow-water wave 
propagation speed C0 from Eq. (10.10). To see this, rewrite Eq. (10.30) as
 
q2 5 gy3
c 5 (gyc)y2
c 5 V2
cy2
c 
(10.32)
By comparison it follows that the critical channel velocity is
 
Vc 5 (gyc)1/2 5 C0    Fr 5 1 
(10.33)
For E , Emin no solution exists in Fig. 10.8, and thus such a fl ow is impossible physi-
cally. For E . Emin two solutions are possible: (1) large depth with V , Vc, called 
subcritical, and (2) small depth with V . Vc, called supercritical. In subcritical fl ow, 
disturbances can propagate upstream because wave speed C0 . V. In supercritical 
fl ow, waves are swept downstream: Upstream is a zone of silence, and a small obstruc-
tion in the fl ow will create a wedge-shaped wave exactly analogous to the Mach waves 
in Fig. 9.18c. The angle of these waves must be
 
μ 5 sin21 c0
V 5 sin21(gy)1/2
V
 5 sin21a 1
Frb 
(10.34)
The wave angle and the depth can thus be used as a simple measurement of super-
critical fl ow velocity.
 
Note from Fig. 10.8 that small changes in E near Emin cause a large change in the 
depth y, by analogy with small changes in duct area near the sonic point in Fig. 9.7. 
Thus critical fl ow is neutrally stable and is often accompanied by waves and undula-
tions in the free surface. Channel designers should avoid long runs of near-critical fl ow.
The Water Channel Compressible 
Flow Analogy
 
The simple water wave expression of Eq. (10.34), sin μ 5 1/Fr, can be extended into 
a general, often qualitative, analogy between gas dynamics and water channel fl ow [21, 
Chap. 11]. The analogy is derived from small-disturbance theory and has the results
Froude number is analogous to Mach number.
Water depth is analogous to gas density.
Water depth squared is analogous to gas pressure.
Hydraulic jumps are analogous to gas shock waves.

10.4  Specifi c Energy; Critical Depth  699
Both experiments and CFD results have exploited this analogy [37, 38]. A further 
result is that small-disturbance channel fl ow is equivalent to a fi ctitious gas with a 
specifi c heat ratio k 5 2.0. However, for larger disturbances, such as shock waves, 
the numerical results differ and, oddly, are more accurate for k 5 1.4 than for k 5 2.0. 
A few examples are assigned here as Probs. P10.85, P10.88, and P10.91.

Vc can be computed.

Critical Uniform Flow: 
The Critical Slope
 
If a critical channel fl ow is also moving uniformly (at constant depth), it must 
 correspond to a critical slope Sc, with yn 5 yc. This condition is analyzed by equating 
Eq. (10.37a) to the Chézy (or Manning) formula:

where α2 equals 1.0 for SI units and 2.208 for BG units. Equation (10.38) is valid for

This is a special case, a reference point. In most channel fl ows yn ? yc. For fully

Frictionless Flow over a Bump
 
A rough analogy to compressible gas fl ow in a nozzle (Fig. 9.12) is open-channel 
fl ow over a bump, as in Fig. 10.9a. The behavior of the free surface is sharply  different 
according to whether the approach fl ow is subcritical or supercritical. The height of 
the bump also can change the character of the results. For frictionless two-dimensional 
fl ow, sections 1 and 2 in Fig. 10.9a are related by continuity and momentum:
V1y1 5 V2y2    V2

702 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
This equation has one negative and two positive solutions if Dh is not too large. 
Its  behavior is illustrated in Fig. 10.9b and depends on whether condition 1 is on 
the  upper or lower leg of the energy curve. The specifi c energy E2 is exactly Dh 
less than the approach energy E1, and point 2 will lie on the same leg of the curve 
as E1. A subcritical approach, Fr1 , 1, will cause the water level to decrease at 
the bump. Supercritical approach fl ow, Fr1 . 1, causes a water level increase over 
the bump.
 
If the bump height reaches Dhmax 5 E1 2 Ec, as illustrated in Fig. 10.9b, the fl ow 
at the crest will be exactly critical (Fr 5 1). If Dh . Dhmax, there are no physically 
correct solutions to Eq. (10.39). That is, a bump too large will “choke” the channel 
and cause frictional effects, typically a hydraulic jump (Sec. 10.5).
 
These bump arguments are reversed if the channel has a depression (Dh , 0): 
Subcritical approach fl ow will cause a water level rise and supercritical fl ow a fall in 
depth. Point 2 will be |Dh| to the right of point 1, and critical fl ow cannot occur.
EXAMPLE 10.7
Water fl ow in a wide channel approaches a 10-cm-high bump at 1.5 m/s and a depth of 
1 m. Estimate (a) the water depth y2 over the bump and (b) the bump height that will cause 
the crest fl ow to be critical.

For subcritical approach fl ow, if Dh is not too large, we expect a depression in the water level 
over the bump and a higher subcritical Froude number at the crest. With Dh 5 0.1 m, the 
specifi c energy levels must be

Eq. (10.39) takes on the numerical values

There are three real roots: y2 5 10.859 m, 10.451 m, and 20.296 m. The third (negative) 
solution is physically impossible. The second (smaller) solution is the supercritical condition 
for E2 and is not possible for this subcritical bump. The fi rst solution is correct:
 
y2(subcritical) < 0.859 m 
Ans. (a)
The surface level has dropped by y1 2 y2 2 Dh 5 1.0 2 0.859 2 0.1 5 0.041 m. The crest 
velocity is V2 5 V1y1/y2 5 1.745 m/s. The Froude number at the crest is Fr2 5 0.601. Flow 
downstream of the bump is subcritical. These fl ow conditions are shown in Fig. E10.7.

Ans. (b)
For this bump, the solution of Eq. (10.39) is y2 5 yc 5 0.612 m, and the Froude number is 
unity at the crest. At critical fl ow the surface level has dropped by y1 2 y2 2 Dh 5 0.191 m.
Flow under a Sluice Gate
 
A sluice gate is a bottom opening in a wall, as sketched in Fig. 10.10a, commonly 
used in control of rivers and channel fl ows. If the fl ow is allowed free discharge 
through the gap, as in Fig. 10.10a, the fl ow smoothly accelerates from subcritical 
(upstream) to critical (near the gap) to supercritical (downstream). The gate is then

analogous to a converging–diverging nozzle in gas dynamics, as in Fig. 9.12,  operating 
at its design condition (similar to point H in Fig. 9.12b).

Given subcritical upstream fl ow (V1, y1), this cubic equation has only one positive 
real solution: supercritical fl ow at the same specifi c energy, as in Fig. 10.10b. The 
fl ow rate varies with the ratio y2/y1; we ask, as a problem exercise, to show that the 
fl ow rate is a maximum when y2/y1 5 2
3.
 
The free discharge, Fig. 10.10a, contracts to a depth y2 about 40 percent less 
than the gate’s gap height, as shown. This is similar to a free orifi ce discharge, as in 
Fig. 6.39. If H is the height of the gate gap and b is the gap width into the paper, we 
can approximate the fl ow rate by orifi ce theory:
 
Q 5 CdHb 12gy1    where    Cd <
0.61
11 1 0.61H/y1
 
(10.41)
in the range H/y1 , 0.5. Thus a continuous variation in fl ow rate is accomplished by 
raising the gate.
 
If the tailwater is high, as in Fig. 10.10c, free discharge is not possible. The sluice 
gate is said to be drowned or partially drowned. There will be energy dissipation in 
the exit fl ow, probably in the form of a drowned hydraulic jump, and the downstream 
fl ow will return to subcritical. Equations (10.40) and (10.41) do not apply to this situ-
ation, and experimental discharge correlations are necessary [3, 19]. See Prob. P10.77.
10.5 The Hydraulic Jump
 
In open-channel fl ow a supercritical fl ow can change quickly back to a subcritical 
fl ow by passing through a hydraulic jump, as in Fig. 10.5. The upstream fl ow is fast 
and shallow, and the downstream fl ow is slow and deep, analogous to the normal 
shock wave of Fig. 9.8. Unlike the infi nitesimally thin normal shock, the hydraulic 
jump is quite thick, ranging in length from 4 to 6 times the downstream depth y2 [20].
 
Being extremely turbulent and agitated, the hydraulic jump is a very effective 
energy dissipator and is a feature of stilling-basin and spillway applications [20]. 
Figure 10.11 shows the jump formed in a laboratory open channel. It is very important 
Fig. 10.11 Hydraulic jump in a 
laboratory open channel. Note the 
extreme, dissipative turbulence in 
the downstream fl ow. Data are 
given in Prob. P10.94. (Courtesy of

Queensland.)

10.5  The Hydraulic Jump 705
that such jumps be located on specially designed aprons; otherwise the channel bottom 
will be badly scoured by the agitation. Jumps also mix fl uids very effectively and 
have application to sewage and water treatment designs.
Classifi cation
 
The principal parameter affecting hydraulic jump performance is the upstream Froude 
number Fr1 5 V1/(gy1)1/2. The Reynolds number and channel geometry have only a 
secondary effect. As detailed in Ref. 20, the following ranges of operation can be 
outlined, as illustrated in Fig. 10.12:
Fr1 , 1.0: 
Jump impossible, violates second law of thermodynamics.
Fr1 5 1.0 to 1.7: 
Standing-wave or undular jump about 4y2 long; low 
 dissipation, less than 5 percent.

jump; dissipation 5 to 15 percent.

large wave that can travel downstream for miles, damaging 
earth banks and other structures. Not recommended for 
design conditions. Dissipation 15 to 45 percent.
Fr1 5 4.5 to 9.0: 
Stable, well-balanced, steady jump; best performance and 
action, insensitive to downstream conditions. Best design 
range. Dissipation 45 to 70 percent.
Fr1 . 9.0: 
Rough, somewhat intermittent strong jump, but good 
performance. Dissipation 70 to 85 percent.
Further details can be found in Ref. 20 and Ref. 2, Chap. 15.
Theory for a Horizontal Jump
 
A jump that occurs on a steep channel slope can be affected by the difference in 
water-weight components along the fl ow. The effect is small, however, so the classic 
theory assumes that the jump occurs on a horizontal bottom.
 
You will be pleased to know that we have already analyzed this problem in Sec. 
10.1. A hydraulic jump is exactly equivalent to the strong fi xed wave in Fig. 10.4b, 
where the change in depth δy is not neglected. If V1 and y1 upstream are known, V2
and y2 are computed by applying continuity and momentum across the wave, as in 
Eqs. (10.7) and (10.8). Equation (10.9) is therefore the correct solution for a jump if 
we interpret C and y in Fig. 10.4b as upstream conditions V1 and y1, respectively, 
with C 2 δV and y 1 δy being the downstream conditions V2 and y2, respectively, 
as in Fig. 10.12b. Equation (10.9) becomes
V 2
1 5 1
2gy1 η(η 1 1) 
(10.42)
where η 5 y2/y1. Introducing the Froude number Fr1 5 V1/(gy1)1/2 and solving this 
quadratic equation for η, we obtain
2y2
y1
5 21 1 (1 1 8 Fr2
1)1/2  
(10.43)
With y2 thus known, V2 follows from the wide-channel continuity relation:
 
V2 5 V1y1
y2
 
(10.44)
Finally, we can evaluate the dissipation head loss across the jump from the steady 
fl ow energy equation:
hf 5 E1 2 E2 5 ay1 1 V2
1
2gb 2 ay2 1 V2
2
2gb
Introducing y2 and V2 from Eqs. (10.43) and (10.44), we fi nd after considerable alge-
braic manipulation that
 
hf 5 (y2 2 y1)3
4y1y2
 
(10.45)

10.5  The Hydraulic Jump 707
Equation (10.45) shows that the dissipation loss is positive only if y2 . y1, which is 
a requirement of the second law of thermodynamics. Equation (10.43) then requires 
that Fr1 . 1.0; that is, the upstream fl ow must be supercritical. Finally, Eq. (10.44) 
shows that V2 , V1 and the downstream fl ow is subcritical. All these results agree 
with our previous experience analyzing the normal shock wave.
 
The present theory is for hydraulic jumps in wide or rectangular horizontal  channels.

10.6 Gradually Varied Flow3
 
In practical channel fl ows both the bottom slope and the water depth change with 
position, as in Fig. 10.3. An approximate analysis is possible if the fl ow is gradually 
varied, as is the case if the slopes are small and changes not too sudden. The basic 
assumptions are
1. Slowly changing bottom slope.
2. Slowly changing water depth (no hydraulic jumps).
3. Slowly changing cross section.
4. One-dimensional velocity distribution.
5. Pressure distribution approximately hydrostatic.
The fl ow then satisfi es the continuity relation (10.1) plus the energy equation with 
bottom friction losses included. The two unknowns for steady fl ow are velocity V(x) 
and water depth y(x), where x is distance along the channel.
Basic Differential Equation
 
Consider the length of channel dx illustrated in Fig. 10.13. All the terms that enter 
the steady fl ow energy equation are shown, and the balance between x and x 1 dx is
V2
2g 1 y 1 S0 dx 5 S dx 1 V 2

2g b 1 y 1 dy
or 
dy
dx 1 d
dx aV 2
2g b 5 S0 2 S 
(10.46)
where S0 is the slope of the channel bottom (positive as shown in Fig. 10.13) and S is 
the slope of the EGL (which drops due to wall friction losses).

To eliminate the velocity derivative, differentiate the continuity relation:
dQ
dx 5 0 5 A dV
dx 1 V dA
dx  
(10.47)
But dA 5 b0 dy, where b0 is the channel width at the surface. Eliminating dV/dx 
between Eqs. (10.46) and (10.47), we obtain
 
dy
dx a1 2 V 2b0
gA b 5 S0 2 S 
(10.48)
Finally, recall from Eq. (10.37) that V2b0/(gA) is the square of the Froude number of 
the local channel fl ow. The fi nal desired form of the gradually varied fl ow equation is
 
dy
dx 5 S0 2 S
1 2 Fr2  
(10.49)
This equation changes sign according to whether the Froude number is subcritical 
or  supercritical and is analogous to the one-dimensional gas dynamic area-change 
 formula (9.40).
 
The numerator of Eq. (10.49) changes sign according to whether S0 is greater or 
less than S, which is the slope equivalent to uniform fl ow at the same discharge Q:

equals 1.0 for SI units and 2.208 for BG units.
Classifi cation of Solutions
 
It is customary to compare the actual channel slope S0 with the critical slope Sc for 
the same Q from Eq. (10.38). There are fi ve classes for S0, giving rise to 12 distinct 
types of solution curves, all of which are illustrated in Fig. 10.14:

The solution letters S, C, M, H, and A obviously denote the names of the fi ve types of 
slopes. The numbers 1, 2, 3 relate to the position of the initial point on the solution curve 
with respect to the normal depth yn and the critical depth yc. In type 1 solutions, the 
initial point is above both yn and yc, and in all cases the water depth solution y(x) becomes 
even deeper and farther away from yn and yc. In type 2 solutions, the initial point lies 
between yn and yc, and if there is no change in S0 or roughness, the solution tends 
asymptotically toward the lower of yn or yc. In type 3 cases, the initial point lies below 
both yn and yc, and the solution curve tends asymptotically toward the lower of these.
 
Figure 10.14 shows the basic character of the local solutions, but in practice, of 
course, S0 varies with x, and the overall solution patches together the various cases 
to form a continuous depth profi le y(x) compatible with a given initial condition and 
a given discharge Q. There is a fi ne discussion of various composite solutions in 
Ref. 2, Chap. 9; see also Ref. 22, Sec. 12.7.
Numerical Solution
 
The basic relation for gradually varied fl ow, Eq. (10.49), is a fi rst-order ordinary dif-
ferential equation that can be easily solved numerically. For a given constant-volume 
fl ow rate Q, it may be written in the form
 
dy
dx 5 S0 2 n2Q2/(α2A2R4/3
h )
1 2 Q2b0/(gA3)
 
(10.51)
subject to an initial condition y 5 y0 at x 5 x0. It is assumed that the bottom slope 
S0(x) and the cross-sectional shape parameters (b0, P, A) are known everywhere along 
the channel. Then one may solve Eq. (10.51) for local water depth y(x) by any stan-
dard numerical method. The author uses an Excel spreadsheet for a personal computer. 
Step sizes Dx may be selected so that each change Dy is limited to no greater than, 
say, 1 percent. The solution curves are generally well behaved unless there are dis-
continuous changes in channel parameters. Note that if one approaches the critical 
depth yc, the denominator of Eq. (10.51) approaches zero, so small step sizes are 
required. It helps physically to know what type of solution curve (M-1, S-2, or the 
like) you are proceeding along, but this is not mathematically necessary.
EXAMPLE 10.9
Let us extend the data of Example 10.5 to compute a portion of the profi le shape. Given is 
a wide channel with n 5 0.022, S0 5 0.0048, and q 5 50 ft3/(s ? ft). If y0 5 3 ft at x 5 0, 
how far along the channel x 5 L does it take the depth to rise to yL 5 4 ft? Is the 4-ft depth 
position upstream or downstream in Fig. E10.9a?

712 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
Solution
In Example 10.5 we computed yc 5 4.27 ft. Since our initial depth y 5 3 ft is less than yc, we 
know the fl ow is supercritical. Let us also compute the normal depth for the given slope S0 by 
setting q 5 50 ft3/(s ? ft) in the Chézy formula (10.19) with Rh 5 yn:
q 5 α
n AR2/3
h S1/2

0.022 3yn(1 ft) 4y2/3
n (0.0048)1/2 5 50 ft3/(s # ft)
E10.9a 
yc = 4.27 ft
yn = 4.14 ft
y0 = 3 ft
y L = 4 ft
S0 = 0.0048  
x = 0
x = L
L = ?
Solve for: 
yn < 4.14 ft 
Thus both y(0) 5 3 ft and y(L) 5 4 ft are less than yn, which is less than yc, so we must be on 
an S-3 curve, as in Fig. 10.14a. For a wide channel, Eq. (10.51) reduces to

1 2 (50)2/(32.2y3)
    with y(0) 5 3 ft
The initial slope is y9(0) < 0.00494, and a step size Dx 5 5 ft would cause a change 
Dy < (0.00494)(5 ft) < 0.025 ft, less than 1 percent. We therefore integrate numerically with

Ans.
We verify from Fig. 10.14a that water depth does increase downstream on an S-3 curve. The 
solution curve y(x) is shown as the bold line in Fig. E10.9b.
 
For little extra effort we can investigate the entire family of S-3 solution curves for this 
problem. Figure E10.9b also shows what happens if the initial depth is varied from 0.5 to 
3.5 ft in increments of 0.5 ft. All S-3 solutions smoothly rise and asymptotically approach 
the uniform fl ow condition y 5 yn 5 4.14 ft.
Approximate Solution for 
Irregular Channels
 
Direct numerical solution of Eq. (10.51) is appropriate when we have analytical 
 formulas for the channel variations A(x), S0(x), n(x), b0(x), and Rh(x). For natural 
channels, however, cross sections are often highly irregular, and data can be sparse 
and unevenly spaced. For such cases, civil engineers use an approximate method to 
estimate gradual fl ow changes. Write Eq. (10.46) in fi nite-difference form between 
two depths y and y 1 Dy:
 
¢x <  E(y 1 ¢y) 2 E(y)
(S0 2 Savg)
   where E 5 y 1 V 2
2g  
(10.52)
Average values of velocity, slope, and hydraulic radius are estimated between the two 
sections. For example,
Vavg <  1
23V(y) 1 V(y 1 ¢y) 4; Rh, avg < 1
23Rh(y) 1 Rh(y 1 ¢y) 4 ; Savg <
n2 V 2
avg

Again, computation can proceed either upstream or downstream, using small values 
of Dy. Further details of such computations are given in Chap. 10 of Ref. 2.

Repeat Example 10.9 using the approximate method of Eq. (10.52) with a 0.25-foot

Comment: The accuracy is excellent, giving the same result, x 5 230 ft, as the Excel 
spreadsheet numerical integration in Example 10.9. Much of this accuracy is due to the 
smooth, slowly varying nature of the profi le. Less precision is expected when the channel 
is irregular and given as uneven cross sections.
Some Illustrative 
Composite-Flow Transitions
 
The solution curves in Fig. 10.14 are somewhat simplistic, since they postulate 
 constant-bottom slopes. In practice, channel slopes can vary greatly, S0 5 S0(x), and 
the solution curves can cross between two regimes. Other parameter changes, such as 
A(x), b0(x), and n(x), can cause interesting composite-fl ow profi les. Some examples 
are shown in Fig. 10.15.4
 
Figure 10.15a shows a transition from a mild slope to a steep slope in a constant-
width channel. The initial M-2 curve must change to an S-2 curve farther down the 
steep slope. The only way this can happen physically is for the solution curve to pass 
smoothly through the critical depth, as shown. The critical point is mathematically 
singular [2, Sec. 9.6], and the fl ow near this point is generally rapidly, not gradually, 
varied. The fl ow pattern, accelerating from subcritical to supercritical, is similar to a 
converging–diverging nozzle in gas dynamics. Other scenarios for Fig. 10.15a are 
impossible. For example, the upstream curve cannot be M-1, for the break in slope 
would cause an S-1 curve that would move away from uniform steep fl ow.
 
Figure 10.15b shows a mild slope that suddenly changes to an even milder slope. 
The approach fl ow is assumed uniform, and the break in slope makes its presence 
known upstream. The water depth moves smoothly along an M-1 curve until it exactly 
merges, at the break point, with a uniform fl ow at the new (milder) depth yn2.
 
Figure 10.15c shows a steep slope that suddenly changes to a less steep slope. Note 
for both slopes that yn , yc. Because of the supercritical (V . Vc) approach fl ow, the 
break in slope cannot make its presence known upstream. Thus, not until the break 
point does an S-3 curve form, and then this profi le proceeds smoothly to uniform fl ow 
at the new (higher) normal depth.
 
Figure 10.15d shows a steep slope that suddenly changes to a mild slope. Various 
cases may occur, possibly beyond the ability of this author to describe. The two cases 
shown depend on the relative magnitude of the mild slope. If the downstream depth yn2 
is shallow, an M-3 curve will start at the break and develop until the local supercritical 
fl ow is just suffi cient to form a hydraulic jump up to the new normal depth. As yn2 
increases, the jump moves upstream until, for the “high” case shown, it forms on the 
steep side, followed by an S-1 curve that merges into normal depth yn2 at the break point.

716 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
 
Figure 10.15e illustrates a free overfall with a mild slope. This acts as a control 
section to the upstream fl ow, which then forms an M-2 curve and accelerates to criti-
cal fl ow near the overfall. The falling stream will be supercritical. The overfall 
“ controls” the water depths upstream and can serve as an initial condition for com-
putation of y(x). This is the type of fl ow that occurs in a weir or waterfall, Sec. 10.7.
 
The examples in Fig. 10.15 show that changing conditions in open-channel fl ow 
can result in complex fl ow patterns. Many more examples of composite-fl ow profi les 
are given in Ref. 2, pp. 229–233.
10.7 Flow Measurement and 
Control by Weirs
 
A weir, of which the ordinary dam is an example, is a channel obstruction over which 
the fl ow must defl ect. For simple geometries the channel discharge Q correlates with 
gravity and with the blockage height H to which the upstream fl ow is backed up above 
the weir elevation (see Fig. 10.16). Thus a weir is a simple but effective open-channel 
fl owmeter. We used a weir as an example of dimensional analysis in Prob. P5.32.
 
Figure 10.16 shows two common weirs, sharp-crested and broad-crested, assumed 
to be very wide. In both cases the fl ow upstream is subcritical, accelerates to critical 
near the top of the weir, and spills over into a supercritical nappe. For both weirs the 
discharge q per unit width is proportional to g1/2H3/2 but with somewhat different 
coeffi cients. The short-crested (or thin-plate) weir nappe should be ventilated to the

atmosphere; that is, it should spring clear of the weir crest. Unventilated or drowned 
nappes are more diffi cult to correlate and depend on tailwater conditions. (The spill-
way of Fig. 10.11 is a sort of unventilated weir.)
 
A very complete discussion of weirs, including other designs such as the polygonal 
“Crump” weir and various contracting fl umes, is given in the text by Ackers et al. [23]. 
See Prob. P10.122.
Analysis of Sharp-Crested Weirs
 
It is possible to analyze weir fl ow by inviscid potential theory with an unknown 
(but  solvable) free surface, as in Fig. P8.71. Here, however, we simply use one- 
dimensional fl ow theory plus dimensional analysis to develop suitable weir fl ow rate 
correlations.
 
A very early theoretical approach is credited to J. Weisbach in 1855. The velocity 
head at any point 2 above the weir crest is assumed to equal the total head upstream; 
in other words, Bernoulli’s equation is used with no losses:
V 2
2
2g 1 H 2 h < V 2
1
2g 1 H    or    V2(h) < 22gh 1 V 2
1
where h is the vertical distance down to point 2, as shown in Fig. 10.16a. If we accept 
for the moment, without proof, that the fl ow over the crest draws down to hmin < H/3, 
the volume fl ow q 5 Q/b over the crest is approximately

Normally the upstream velocity head V 2
1/(2g) is neglected, so this expression 
reduces to
Sharp-crested theory: 
q < 0.81(2

(10.53)
This formula is functionally correct, but the coeffi cient 0.81 is too high and should 
be replaced by an experimentally determined discharge coeffi cient.
Analysis of Broad-Crested Weirs
 
The broad-crested weir of Fig. 10.16b can be analyzed more accurately because it 
creates a short run of nearly one-dimensional critical fl ow, as shown. Bernoulli’s 
equation from upstream to the weir crest yields
V 2

This result was used without proof to derive Eq. (10.53). Finally, the fl ow rate follows 
from wide-channel critical fl ow, Eq. (10.32):

where b is the crest width and Cd is a dimensionless, experimentally determined weir
discharge coeffi cient, which may vary with the weir geometry, Reynolds number, and 
Weber number. Many data for many different weirs have been reported in the litera-
ture, as detailed in Ref. 23.
 
An accurate (62 percent) composite correlation for wide ventilated sharp crests is 
recommended as follows [23]:
Wide sharp-crested weir: Cd < 0.564 1 0.0846 H
Y    for    H
Y # 2 
(10.56)
The Reynolds numbers V1H/ν for these data vary from 1 E4 to 2 E6, but the formula 
should apply to higher Re, such as large dams on rivers.
 
The broad-crested weir of Fig. 10.16b is considerably more sensitive to geometric 
parameters, including the surface roughness ε of the crest. If the leading-edge nose 
is rounded, R/L $ 0.05, available data [23, Chap. 7] may be correlated as follows:

(10.57)
where 
δ*
L < 0.001 1 0.21ε/L
The chief effect is due to turbulent boundary layer displacement-thickness growth δ* 
on the crest as compared to upstream head H. The formula is limited to H/L , 0.7, 
ε/L # 0.002, and V1H/ν . 3 E5. If the nose is round, there is no signifi cant effect 
of weir height Y, at least if H/Y , 2.4.
 
If the broad-crested weir has a sharp leading edge, thus commonly called a rect-
angular weir, the discharge may depend on the weir height Y. However, in a certain 
range of weir height and length, Cd is nearly constant:

10.7  Flow Measurement and Control by Weirs 719
Surface roughness is not a signifi cant factor here. For H/L , 0.08 there is large scatter 
(610 percent) in the data. For H/L . 0.33 and H/Y . 0.56, Cd increases up to 
10 percent due to each parameter, and complex charts are needed for the discharge 
coeffi cient [19, Chap. 5].
EXAMPLE 10.11
A weir in a horizontal channel is 1 m high and 4 m wide. The water depth upstream is 
1.6 m. Estimate the discharge if the weir is (a) sharp-crested and (b) round-nosed with an 
unfi nished concrete broad crest 1.2 m long. Neglect V 2
1/(2g).
Solution
Part (a) 
We are given Y 5 1 m and H 1 Y < 1.6 m, hence H < 0.6 m. Since H ! b, we assume that 
the weir is “wide.” For a sharp crest, Eq. (10.56) applies:
Cd < 0.564 1 0.0846 0.6 m
1 m < 0.615
Then the discharge is given by the basic correlation, Eq. (10.55):
 
Q 5 Cdb2gH3/2 5 (0.615)(4 m) 2(9.81 m/s2)(0.6 m)3/2 < 3.58 m3/s 
Ans. (a)
We check that H/Y 5 0.6 , 2.0 for Eq. (10.56) to be valid. From continuity, V1 5 Q/(by1) 5 
3.58/[(4.0)(1.6)] 5 0.56 m/s, giving a Reynolds number V1H/ν < 3.4 E5.
Part (b) 
For a round-nosed broad-crested weir, Eq. (10.57) applies. For an unfi nished concrete surface, 
read ε < 2.4 mm from Table 10.1. Then the displacement thickness is

L < 0.001 1 0.21ε/L 5 0.001 1 0.2 a0.0024 m

Then Eq. (10.57) predicts the discharge coeffi cient:
Cd < 0.544 a1 2
0.00994

3/2
< 0.528
The estimated fl ow rate is thus
 
Q 5 Cdb1gH3/2 5 0.528(4 m)2(9.81 m2/s)(0.6 m)3/2 < 3.07 m3/s 
Ans. (b)
Check that H/L 5 0.5 , 0.7 as required. The approach Reynolds number is V1H/ν < 2.9 E5, 
just barely below the recommended limit in Eq. (10.57).
 
Since V1 < 0.5 m/s, V2
1/(2g) < 0.012 m, so the error in taking total head equal to 0.6 m 
is about 2 percent. We could correct this for upstream velocity head if desired.
Other Thin-Plate Weir Designs
 
Weirs are often used for fl ow measurement and control of artifi cial channels. The two 
most common shapes are a rectangle and a V notch, as shown in Table 10.2. All 
should be fully ventilated and not drowned.
 
Table 10.2a shows a full-width rectangle, which will have slight end-boundary-
layer effects but no end contractions. For a thin-plate design, the top is approximately 

720 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
sharp-crested, and Eq. (10.56) should give adequate accuracy, as shown in the table. 
Since the overfall spans the entire channel, artifi cial ventilation may be needed, such 
as holes in the channel walls.
 
Table 10.2b shows a partial-width rectangle, b , L, which will cause the sides of 
the overfall to contract inward and reduce the fl ow rate. An adequate contraction cor-
rection [23, 24] is to reduce the effective weir width by 0.1H, as shown in the table. It 
seems, however, that this type of weir is rather sensitive to small effects, such as plate 
thickness and sidewall boundary layer growth. Small heads (H , 75 mm) and small 
slot widths (b , 30 cm) are not recommended. See Refs. 23 and 24 for further details.
 
The V notch, in Table 10.2c, is intrinsically interesting in that its overfall has only 
one length scale, H—there is no separate “width.” The discharge will thus be propor-
tional to H5/2, rather than a power of 3
2. Application of Bernoulli’s equation to the 
triangular opening, in the spirit of Eq. (10.52), leads to the following ideal fl ow rate 
for a V notch:

A number of other thin-plate weir designs—trapezoidal, parabolic, circular arc, and 
U-shaped—are discussed in Ref. 25, which also contains considerable data on broad-
crested weirs. See also Refs. 29 and 30.
EXAMPLE 10.12
A V notch weir is to be designed to meter an irrigation channel fl ow. For ease in reading 
the upstream water-level gage, a reading H $ 30 cm is desired for the design fl ow rate of 
150 m3/h. What is the appropriate angle θ for the V notch?
Solution
• Assumptions: Steady fl ow, negligible Weber number effect because H . 50 mm.
• Approach: Equation (10.60) applies with, we hope, a notch angle 208 , θ , 1008.
• Property values: If surface tension is neglected, no fl uid properties are needed. Why?
• Solution: Apply Equation (10.60) to the known fl ow rate and solve for θ:

• Comments: An angle of 638 will create an upstream head of 30 cm. Any angle less than 
that will create an even larger head. Weir formulas depend primarily on gravity and 
geometry. Fluid properties such as (ρ, μ, Y) enter only as slight modifi cations or as 
 correction factors.
Backwater Curves
 
A weir is a fl ow barrier that not only alters the local fl ow over the weir but also 
modifi es the fl ow depth distribution far upstream. Any strong barrier in an open-
channel fl ow creates a backwater curve, which can be computed by the gradually 
varied fl ow theory of Sec. 10.6. If Q is known, the weir formula, Eq. (10.55), 
 determines H and hence the water depth just upstream of the weir, y 5 H 1 Y, where 

722 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
Y is the weir height. We then compute y(x) upstream of the weir from Eq. (10.51), 
following in this case an M-1 curve (Fig. 10.14c). Such a barrier, where the water 
depth correlates with the fl ow rate, is called a channel control point. These are the 
starting points for numerical analysis of fl oodwater profi les in rivers [26].
EXAMPLE 10.13
A rectangular channel 8 m wide, with a fl ow rate of 30 m3/s, encounters a 4-m-high sharp-
edged dam, as shown in Fig. E10.13a. Determine the water depth 2 km upstream if the 
channel slope is S0 5 0.0004 and n 5 0.025.

Solution
First determine the head H produced by the dam, using sharp-crested full-width weir theory,

4 mb (8 m)(9.81 m/s2)1/2H3/2
Since the term 0.0846H/4 in parentheses is small, we may proceed by iteration to the solution 
H < 1.59 m. Then our initial condition at x 5 0, just upstream of the dam, is y(0) 5 Y 1 H 5

Since y(0) is greater than yc, the fl ow upstream is subcritical. Finally, for reference purposes, 
estimate the normal depth from the Chézy equation (10.19):

Summary 723
By trial and error, solve for yn < 3.20 m. If there are no changes in channel width or slope, the 
water depth far upstream of the dam will approach this value. All these reference values y(0), 
yc, and yn are shown in Fig. E10.13b.
 
Since y(0) . yn . yc, the solution will be an M-1 curve as computed from gradually 
varied theory, Eq. (10.51), for a rectangular channel with the given input data:

Beginning with y 5 5.59 m at x 5 0, we integrate backward to x 5 22000 m. For the Runge-
Kutta method, four-fi gure accuracy is achieved for Dx 5 2100 m. The complete solution

Thus, even 2 km upstream, the dam has produced a “backwater” that is 1.8 m above the normal 
depth that would occur without a dam. For this example, a near-normal depth of, say, 10 cm 
greater than yn, or y < 3.3 m, would not be achieved until x 5 213,400 m. Backwater curves 
are quite far-reaching upstream, especially in fl ood stages.
Summary
 
This chapter has introduced open-channel fl ow analysis, limited to steady, one- 
dimensional fl ow conditions. The basic analysis combines the continuity equation with 
the extended Bernoulli equation including friction losses.
 
Open-channel fl ows are classifi ed either by depth variation or by Froude number, 
the latter being analogous to the Mach number in compressible duct fl ow (Chap. 9). 
Flow at constant slope and depth is called uniform fl ow and satisfi es the classical 
Chézy equation (10.19). Straight prismatic channels can be optimized to fi nd the cross 
section that gives maximum fl ow rate with minimum friction losses. As the slope and 
fl ow velocity increase, the channel reaches a critical condition of Froude number 
unity, where velocity equals the speed of a small-amplitude surface wave in the 
 channel. Every channel has a critical slope that varies with the fl ow rate and  roughness. 
If the fl ow becomes supercritical (Fr . 1), it may undergo a hydraulic jump to a 
greater depth and lower (subcritical) velocity, analogous to a normal shock wave.

724 Chapter 10 Open-Channel Flow
 
The analysis of gradually varied fl ow leads to a differential equation (10.51) that 
can be solved by numerical methods. The chapter ends with a discussion of the 
fl ow over a dam or weir, where the total fl ow rate can be correlated with upstream 
water depth.

P10.1 The formula for shallow-water wave propagation speed, 
Eq. (10.9) or (10.10), is independent of the physical prop-

P10.14 The Chézy formula (10.18) is independent of fl uid density

P10.21 An engineer makes careful measurements with a weir (see 
Sec. 10.7) that monitors a rectangular unfi nished concrete 
channel laid on a slope of 18. She fi nds, perhaps with sur-
prise, that when the water depth doubles from 2 ft 2 inches 
to 4 ft 4 inches, the normal fl ow rate more than doubles, 
from 200 to 500 ft3/s. (a) Is this plausible? (b) If so,  estimate 
the channel width.
P10.22 For more than a century, woodsmen harvested trees in

P10.23 It is desired to excavate a clean-earth channel as a trapezoi-

It is desired to meter an asphalt rectangular channel of 
width 1.5 m, which is designed for uniform fl ow at a depth 
of 70 cm and a slope of 0.0036. The vertical sides of the 
channel are 1.2 m high. Consider using a thin-plate rectan-
gular weir, either full or partial width (Table 10.2a,b) for 
this purpose. Sturm [7, p. 51] recommends, for accurate 
correlation, that such a weir have Y $ 9 cm and H/Y # 2.0. 
Determine the feasibility of installing such a weir that will 
be accurate and yet not cause the water to overfl ow the 
sides of the channel.

of lower and upper horizontal sections are 1 m and 2 m, 
respectively. Use engineering estimates and make a plot

A straight weedy-earth channel has the trapezoidal shape of 
Fig. 10.7, with b 5 4 m and θ 5 358. The channel has a con-
stant bottom slope of 0.001. The fl ow rate varies seasonally 
from 5 up to 10 m3/s. It is desired to place a sharp-edged weir 
across the channel so that the water depth 1 km upstream 
remains at 2.0 m 6 10 percent throughout the year. Investi-
gate the possibility of accomplishing this with a full-width 
weir; if successful, determine the proper weir height Y. If 
unsuccessful, try other alternatives, such as (a) a full-width 
broad-crested weir or (b) a weir with side contractions or 
(c) a V-notch weir. Whatever your fi nal design, cite the 
seasonal variation of normal depths and critical depths for 
comparison with the desired year-round depth of 2 m.

The Caroselli Dam on the Pawcatuck River is 10 ft high, 
90  ft wide, and sharp edged. The Coakley  Company 
uses this head to generate hydropower electricity and 
wants more head. They ask the town for  permission 
to raise the dam higher. The river above the dam may 
be approximated as rectangular, 90 ft wide, sloping 
 upstream at 12 ft per statute mile, and with a stony, 
cobbled bed. The average fl ow rate is 400 ft3/s, with a 
30-year predicted fl ood rate of 1200 ft3/s. The river 
sides are steep until 1 mi up stream, where there are 
low-lying residences. The town council agrees the dam 
may be heightened if the new river level near these 
houses, during the 30-year fl ood, is no more than 3 ft 
higher than the present level during average fl ow con-
ditions. You, as project engineer, have to predict how 
high the dam crest can be raised and still meet this 
 requirement.

Chapter 11
Turbomachinery
Motivation. The most common practical engineering application for fl uid mechanics 
is the design of fl uid machinery. The most numerous types are machines that add 
energy to the fl uid (the pump family), but also important are those that extract energy 
(turbines). Both types are usually connected to a rotating shaft, hence the name 
turbomachinery.
 
The purpose of this chapter is to make elementary engineering estimates of the 
performance of fl uid machines. The emphasis will be on nearly incompressible fl ow: 
liquids or low-velocity gases. Basic fl ow principles are discussed, but not the detailed 
construction of the machines.
11.1 Introduction and 
Classifi cation
 
Turbomachines divide naturally into those that add energy (pumps) and those that 
extract energy (turbines). The prefi x turbo- is a Latin word meaning “spin” or “whirl,” 
appropriate for rotating devices.
 
The pump is the oldest fl uid energy transfer device known. At least two designs 
date before Christ: (1) the undershot-bucket waterwheels, or norias, used in Asia and 
Africa (1000 b.c.) and (2) Archimedes’ screw pump (250 b.c.), still being manufac-
tured today to handle solid–liquid mixtures. Paddlewheel turbines were used by the 
Romans in 70 b.c., and Babylonian windmills date back to 700 b.c. [1].
 
Machines that deliver liquids are simply called pumps, but if gases are involved, 
three different terms are in use, depending on the pressure rise achieved. If the pres-
sure rise is very small (a few inches of water), a gas pump is called a fan; up to 1 atm, 
it is usually called a blower; and above 1 atm it is commonly termed a compressor.
Classifi cation of Pumps
 
There are two basic types of pumps: positive-displacement and dynamic or  momentum- 
change pumps. There are several billion of each type in use in the world today.
 
Positive-displacement pumps (PDPs) force the fl uid along by volume changes. A 
cavity opens, and the fl uid is admitted through an inlet. The cavity then closes, and 
the fl uid is squeezed through an outlet. The mammalian heart is a good example, and 

742 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
many mechanical designs are in wide use. References 35–38 give a summary of PDPs. 
A brief classifi cation of PDP designs is as follows:
A. Reciprocating
1. Piston or plunger
2. Diaphragm
B. Rotary
1. Single rotor
a. Sliding vane
b. Flexible tube or lining
c. 
Screw
d. Peristaltic (wave contraction)
2. Multiple rotors
a. Gear
b. Lobe
c. 
Screw
d. Circumferential piston
All PDPs deliver a pulsating or periodic fl ow as the cavity volume opens, traps, and 
squeezes the fl uid. Their great advantage is the delivery of any fl uid regardless of its 
viscosity.
 
Figure 11.1 shows schematics of the operating principles of seven of these PDPs. 
It is rare for such devices to be run backward, so to speak, as turbines or energy 
extractors, the steam engine (reciprocating piston) being a classic exception.
 
Since PDPs compress mechanically against a cavity fi lled with liquid, a common 
feature is that they develop immense pressures if the outlet is shut down for any 
reason. Sturdy construction is required, and complete shutoff would cause damage if 
pressure relief valves were not used.
 
Dynamic pumps simply add momentum to the fl uid by means of fast-moving 
blades or vanes or certain special designs. There is no closed volume: The fl uid 
increases momentum while moving through open passages and then converts its high 
velocity to a pressure increase by exiting into a diffuser section. Dynamic pumps can 
be classifi ed as follows:
A. Rotary
1. Centrifugal or radial exit fl ow
2. Axial fl ow
3. Mixed fl ow (between radial and axial)
B. Special designs
1. Jet pump or ejector (see Fig. P3.36)
2. Electromagnetic pumps for liquid metals
3. Fluid-actuated: gas lift or hydraulic ram
We shall concentrate in this chapter on the rotary designs, sometimes called rotody-
namic pumps. Other designs of both PDP and dynamic pumps are discussed in spe-
cialized texts [for example, 3, 31].

11.1  Introduction and Classifi cation 743
 
Dynamic pumps generally provide a higher fl ow rate than PDPs and a much 
steadier discharge but are ineffective in handling high-viscosity liquids. Dynamic 
pumps also generally need priming; if they are fi lled with gas, they cannot suck up 
a liquid from below into their inlet. The PDP, on the other hand, is self-priming for 
most applications. A dynamic pump can provide very high fl ow rates (up to 300,000 
gal/min) but usually with moderate pressure rises (a few atmospheres). In contrast,

744 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
a PDP can operate up to very high pressures (300 atm) but typically produces low 
fl ow rates (100 gal/min).
 
The relative performance (Dp versus Q) is quite different for the two types of 
pump, as shown in Fig. 11.2. At constant shaft rotation speed, the PDP produces 
nearly constant fl ow rate and virtually unlimited pressure rise, with little effect of 
viscosity. The fl ow rate of a PDP cannot be varied except by changing the displace-
ment or the speed. The reliable constant-speed discharge from PDPs has led to their 
wide use in metering fl ows [35].
 
The dynamic pump, by contrast in Fig. 11.2, provides a continuous constant-speed 
variation of performance, from near-maximum Dp at zero fl ow (shutoff conditions) 
to zero Dp at maximum fl ow rate. High-viscosity fl uids sharply degrade the perfor-
mance of a dynamic pump.
 
As usual—and for the last time in this text—we remind the reader that this is 
merely an introductory chapter. Many books are devoted solely to turbomachines: 
generalized treatments [2 to 7], texts specializing in pumps [8 to 16, 30, 31], fans [17 
to 20], compressors [21 to 23], gas turbines [24 to 26], hydropower [27, 28, 29, 32], 
and PDPs [35 to 38]. There are several useful handbooks [30 to 32], and at least two 
undergraduate textbooks [33, 34] have a comprehensive discussion of turbomachines. 
The reader is referred to these sources for further details.
11.2 The Centrifugal Pump
 
Let us begin our brief look at rotodynamic machines by examining the characteristics 
of the centrifugal pump. As sketched in Fig. 11.3, this pump consists of an impeller 
rotating within a casing. Fluid enters axially through the eye of the casing, is caught 
up in the impeller blades, and is whirled tangentially and radially outward until it 
leaves through all circumferential parts of the impeller into the diffuser part of the 
casing. The fl uid gains both velocity and pressure while passing through the impeller. 
The doughnut-shaped diffuser, or scroll, section of the casing decelerates the fl ow and 
further increases the pressure.
 
The impeller blades are usually backward-curved, as in Fig. 11.3, but there are also 
radial and forward-curved blade designs, which slightly change the output  pressure.

11.2  The Centrifugal Pump 745
The blades may be open (separated from the front casing only by a narrow clearance) 
or closed (shrouded from the casing on both sides by an impeller wall). The diffuser 
may be vaneless, as in Fig. 11.3, or fi tted with fi xed vanes to help guide the fl ow 
toward the exit.
Basic Output Parameters
 
Assuming steady fl ow, the pump basically increases the Bernoulli head of the fl ow 
between point 1, the eye, and point 2, the exit. From Eq. (3.73), neglecting viscous 
work and heat transfer, this change is denoted by H:
 
H 5 a p
ρg 1 V 2
2g 1 zb
2
2 a p
ρg 1 V 2
2g 1 zb

5 hs 2 hf 
(11.1)
where hs is the pump head supplied and hf the losses. The net head H is a primary 
output parameter for any turbomachine. Since Eq. (11.1) is for incompressible fl ow, 
it must be modifi ed for gas compressors with large density changes.
 
Usually V2 and V1 are about the same, z2 2 z1 is no more than a meter or so, and 
the net pump head is essentially equal to the change in pressure head:
 
H < p2 2 p1
ρg
5 ¢p
ρg  
(11.2)
The power delivered to the fl uid simply equals the specifi c weight times the discharge 
times the net head change:
 
Pw 5 ρgQH 
(11.3)
This is traditionally called the water horsepower. The power required to drive the 
pump is the brake horsepower1
 
bhp 5 ωT 
(11.4)
where ω is the shaft angular velocity and T the shaft torque. If there were no losses, 
Pw and brake horsepower would be equal, but of course Pw is actually less, and the 
effi ciency η of the pump is defi ned as

746 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
The chief aim of the pump designer is to make η as high as possible over as broad 
a range of discharge Q as possible.
 
The effi ciency is basically composed of three parts: volumetric, hydraulic, and 
mechanical. The volumetric effi ciency is
 
ηυ 5
Q
Q 1 QL
 
(11.6)
where QL is the loss of fl uid due to leakage in the impeller casing clearances. The 
hydraulic effi ciency is
 
ηh 5 1 2
hf
hs
 
(11.7)
where hf has three parts: (1) shock loss at the eye due to imperfect match between 
inlet fl ow and the blade entrances, (2) friction losses in the blade passages, and 
(3)  circulation loss due to imperfect match at the exit side of the blades.
 
Finally, the mechanical effi ciency is
 
ηm 5 1 2
Pf
bhp 
(11.8)
where Pf is the power loss due to mechanical friction in the bearings, packing glands, 
and other contact points in the machine.
 
By defi nition, the total effi ciency is simply the product of its three parts:
 
η ; ηυηhηm 
(11.9)
The designer has to work in all three areas to improve the pump.
Elementary Pump Theory
 
You may have thought that Eqs. (11.1) to (11.9) were formulas from pump theory. 
Not so; they are merely defi nitions of performance parameters and cannot be used in 
any predictive mode. To actually predict the head, power, effi ciency, and fl ow rate 
of a pump, two theoretical approaches are possible: (1) simple one-dimensional fl ow 
formulas and (2) complex computer models that account for viscosity and three-
dimensionality. Many of the best design improvements still come from testing and 
experience, and pump research remains a very active fi eld [39]. The last 10 years 
have seen considerable advances in computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) modeling 
of  fl ow in turbomachines [42], and at least eight commercial turbulent fl ow three- 
dimensional CFD codes are now available.
 
To construct an elementary theory of pump performance, we assume one- 
dimensional fl ow and combine idealized fl uid velocity vectors through the impeller 
with the angular momentum theorem for a control volume, Eq. (3.59).
 
The idealized velocity diagrams are shown in Fig. 11.4. The fl uid is assumed to 
enter the impeller at r 5 r1 with velocity component w1 tangent to the blade angle 
β1 plus circumferential speed u1 5 ωr1 matching the tip speed of the impeller. Its 
absolute entrance velocity is thus the vector sum of w1 and u1, shown as V1. Similarly, 
the fl ow exits at r 5 r2 with component w2 parallel to the blade angle β2 plus tip 
speed u2 5 ωr2, with resultant velocity V2.

11.2  The Centrifugal Pump 747
 
We applied the angular momentum theorem to a turbomachine in Example 3.18 
(Fig. 3.15) and arrived at a result for the applied torque T:
 
T 5 ρQ(r2Vt 2 2 r1Vt1) 
(11.10)
where Vt1 and Vt2 are the absolute circumferential velocity components of the fl ow. 
The power delivered to the fl uid is thus
 
Pw 5 ωT 5 ρQ(u2Vt 2 2 u1Vt1) 
or 
H 5 Pw
ρgQ 5 1
g
 (u2Vt 2 2 u1Vt1)
 
(11.11)
These are the Euler turbomachine equations, showing that the torque, power, and 
ideal head are functions only of the rotor-tip velocities u1,2 and the absolute fl uid 
tangential velocities Vt1,2, independent of the axial velocities (if any) through the 
machine.
 
Additional insight is gained by rewriting these relations in another form. From the 
geometry of Fig. 11.4

748 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
Thus the ideal head relates to the absolute plus the relative kinetic energy change of 
the fl uid minus the rotor-tip kinetic energy change. Finally, substituting for H from 
its defi nition in Eq. (11.1) and rearranging, we obtain the classic relation
 
p
ρg 1 z 1 w2
2g 2 r2ω2
2g 5 const 
(11.14)
This is the Bernoulli equation in rotating coordinates and applies to either two- or 
three-dimensional ideal incompressible fl ow.
 
For a centrifugal pump, the power can be related to the radial velocity Vn 5 Vt tan α 
and the continuity relation
 
Pw 5 ρQ(u2Vn2 cot α2 2 u1Vn1 cot α1) 
(11.15)
where
 
Vn2 5

and where b1 and b2 are the blade widths at inlet and exit. With the pump parameters 
r1, r2, β1, β2, and ω known, Eq. (11.11) or Eq. (11.15) is used to compute idealized 
power and head versus discharge. The “design” fl ow rate Q* is commonly estimated 
by assuming that the fl ow enters exactly normal to the impeller:
 
α1 5 90°    Vn1 5 V1 
(11.16)
We can expect this simple analysis to yield estimates within 625 percent for the head, 
water horsepower, and discharge of a pump. Let us illustrate with an example.
EXAMPLE 11.1
Given are the following data for a commercial centrifugal water pump: r1 5 4 in, r2 5 7 in, 
β1 5 308, β2 5 208, speed 5 1440 r/min. Estimate (a) the design point discharge, (b) the 
water horsepower, and (c) the head if b1 5 b2 5 1.75 in.

velocity diagram, Fig. E11.1a, with α1 5 908 for design point, we compute

(The actual pump develops about 140-ft head.) Improved methods for obtaining closer 
 estimates are given in advanced references [for example, 7, 8, and 31].
Effect of Blade Angle on 
Pump Head
 
The simple theory just discussed can be used to predict an important blade-angle 
effect. If we neglect inlet angular momentum, the theoretical water horsepower is
 
Pw 5 ρQu2Vt2 
(11.17)
where 
Vt2 5 u2 2 Vn2 cot β2    Vn2 5

Then the theoretical head from Eq. (11.11) becomes
 
H < u2
2
g 2 u2 cot β2
2πr2b2g
 Q 
(11.18)
The head varies linearly with discharge Q, having a shutoff value u2
2/g, where u2 is 
the exit blade-tip speed. The slope is negative if β2 , 908 (backward-curved blades) 
and positive for β2 . 908 (forward-curved blades). This effect is shown in Fig. 11.5 
and is accurate only at low fl ow rates.
 
The measured shutoff head of centrifugal pumps is only about 60 percent of the 
theoretical value H0 5 ω2r2
2/g. With the advent of the laser-doppler anemometer, 
researchers can now make detailed three-dimensional fl ow measurements inside 
pumps and can even animate the data into a movie [40].

The positive slope condition in Fig. 11.5 can be unstable and can cause pump 
surge, an oscillatory condition where the pump “hunts” for the proper operating point. 
Surge may cause only rough operation in a liquid pump, but it can be a major prob-
lem in gas compressor operation. For this reason a backward-curved or radial blade 
design is generally preferred. A survey of the problem of pump stability is given by 
Greitzer [41].
11.3 Pump Performance 
Curves and Similarity Rules
 
Since the theory of the previous section is rather qualitative, the only solid indicator 
of a pump’s performance lies in extensive testing. For the moment let us discuss the 
centrifugal pump in particular. The general principles and the presentation of data are 
exactly the same for mixed fl ow and axial fl ow pumps and compressors.
 
Performance charts are almost always plotted for constant shaft rotation speed n 
(in r/min usually). The basic independent variable is taken to be discharge Q (in gal/min 
usually for liquids and ft3/min for gases). The dependent variables, or “output,” are 
taken to be head H (pressure rise Dp for gases), brake horsepower (bhp), and effi -
ciency η.
 
Figure 11.6 shows typical performance curves for a centrifugal pump. The head is 
approximately constant at low discharge and then drops to zero at Q 5 Qmax. At this 
speed and impeller size, the pump cannot deliver any more fl uid than Qmax. The posi-
tive slope part of the head is shown dashed; as mentioned earlier, this region can be 
unstable and can cause hunting for the operating point.
 
The effi ciency η is always zero at no fl ow and at Qmax, and it reaches a maxi-
mum, perhaps 80 to 90 percent, at about 0.6Qmax. This is the design fl ow rate Q* 
or best effi ciency point (BEP), η 5 ηmax. The head and horsepower at BEP will 
be termed H* and P* (or bhp*), respectively. It is desirable that the effi ciency 
curve be fl at near ηmax, so that a wide range of effi cient operation is achieved. 
However, some designs simply do not achieve fl at effi ciency curves. Note that η is 
not independent of H and P but rather is calculated from the relation in Eq. (11.5), 
η 5 ρgQH/P.
 
As shown in Fig. 11.6, the horsepower required to drive the pump typically rises 
monotonically with the fl ow rate. Sometimes there is a large power rise beyond the

BEP, especially for radial-tipped and forward-curved blades. This is considered 
 undesirable because a much larger motor is then needed to provide high fl ow rates. 
Backward-curved blades typically have their horsepower level off above BEP 
(“ nonoverloading” type of curve).
Measured Performance Curves
 
Figure 11.7 shows actual performance data for a commercial centrifugal pump. 
 Figure  11.7a is for a basic casing size with three different impeller diameters. The 
head curves H(Q) are shown, but the horsepower and effi ciency curves have to 
be  inferred from the contour plots. Maximum discharges are not shown, being far 
outside the normal operating range near the BEP. Everything is plotted raw, of course 
[feet, horsepower, gallons per minute (1 U.S. gal 5 231 in3)] since it is to be used 
directly by designers. Figure 11.7b is the same pump design with a 20 percent larger 
casing, a lower speed, and three larger impeller diameters. Comparing the two pumps 
may be a little confusing: The larger pump produces exactly the same discharge but 
only half the horsepower and half the head. This will be readily understood from the 
scaling or similarity laws we are about to formulate.
 
A point often overlooked is that raw curves like Fig. 11.7 are strictly applicable 
to a fl uid of a certain density and viscosity, in this case water. If the pump were 
used to deliver, say, mercury, the brake horsepower would be about 13 times 
higher while Q, H, and η would be about the same. But in that case H should be 
interpreted as feet of mercury, not feet of water. If the pump were used for SAE 
30 oil, all data would change (brake horsepower, Q, H, and η) due to the large 
change in viscosity (Reynolds number). Again this should become clear with the 
similarity rules.

In the top of Fig. 11.7 is plotted the net positive-suction head (NPSH), which is the 
head required at the pump inlet to keep the liquid from cavitating or boiling. The

where pi and Vi are the pressure and velocity at the pump inlet and pυ is the vapor 
pressure of the liquid. Given the left-hand side, NPSH, from the pump performance 
curve, we must ensure that the right-hand side is equal or greater in the actual system 
to avoid cavitation.
 
If the pump inlet is placed at a height Zi above a reservoir whose free surface is 
at pressure pa, we can use Bernoulli’s equation to rewrite NPSH as
 
NPSH 5 pa
ρg 2 Zi 2 hfi 2 pv
ρg 
(11.20)
where hfi  is the friction head loss between the reservoir and the pump inlet. Knowing 
pa and hfi , we can set the pump at a height Zi that will keep the right-hand side greater 
than the “required” NPSH plotted in Fig. 11.7.
 
If cavitation does occur, there will be pump noise and vibration, pitting damage to 
the impeller, and a sharp dropoff in pump head and discharge. In some liquids this 
deterioration starts before actual boiling, as dissolved gases and light hydrocarbons 
are liberated.
Deviations from Ideal 
Pump Theory
 
The actual pump head data in Fig. 11.7 differ considerably from ideal theory, 
Eq. (11.18). Take, for example, the 36.75-in-diameter pump at 1170 r/min in Fig. 11.7a. 
The theoretical shutoff head is
H0(ideal) 5 ω2r2
2
g
5
31170(2π/60) rad/s423(36.75/2)/(12) ft42
32.2 ft/s2
 5 1093 ft
From Fig. 11.7a, at Q 5 0, we read the actual shutoff head to be only 670 ft, or 
61 percent of the theoretical value (see Prob. P11.24). This is a sharp dropoff and is 
indicative of nonrecoverable losses of three types:
1. Impeller recirculation loss, signifi cant only at low fl ow rates.
2. Friction losses on the blade and passage surfaces, which increase monotonically 
with the fl ow rate.
3. “Shock” loss due to mismatch between the blade angles and the inlet fl ow 
direction, especially signifi cant at high fl ow rates.
These are complicated three-dimensional fl ow effects and hence are diffi cult to  predict. 
Although, as mentioned, numerical (CFD) techniques are becoming more important 
[42], modern performance prediction is still a blend of experience, empirical correla-
tions, idealized theory, and CFD modifi cations [45].
EXAMPLE 11.2
The 32-in pump of Fig. 11.7a is to pump 24,000 gal/min of water at 1170 r/min from a 
reservoir whose surface is at 14.7 lbf/in2 absolute. If head loss from reservoir to pump 
inlet is 6 ft, where should the pump inlet be placed to avoid cavitation for water at 
(a) 608F, pυ 5 0.26 lbf/in2 absolute, SG 5 1.0 and (b) 2008F, pυ 5 11.52 lbf/in2 absolute, 
SG 5 0.9635?

754 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
Solution
Part (a) 
For either case read from Fig. 11.7a at 24,000 gal/min that the required NPSH is 40 ft. For this 
case ρg 5 62.4 lbf/ft3. From Eq. (11.20) it is necessary that
NPSH # pa 2 pυ
ρg
2 Zi 2 hfi
or 
40 ft # (14.7 2 0.26 lbf/in2)(144 in2/ft2)
62.4 lbf/ft3
2 Zi 2 6.0 
or 
Zi # 27.3 2 40 5 212.7 ft 
Ans. (a)
The pump must be placed at least 12.7 ft below the reservoir surface to avoid cavitation.
Part (b) 
For this case ρg 5 62.4(0.9635) 5 60.1 lbf/ft3. Equation (11.20) applies again with the 
 higher pυ:
40 ft # (14.7 2 11.52 lbf/in2)(144 in2/ft2)
60.1 lbf/ft3
2 Zi 2 6.0
or 
Zi # 1.6 2 40 5 238.4 ft 
Ans. (b)
The pump must now be placed at least 38.4 ft below the reservoir surface. These are unusually 
stringent conditions because a large, high-discharge pump requires a large NPSH.
Dimensionless Pump Performance  
For a given pump design, the output variables H and brake horsepower should be 
dependent on discharge Q, impeller diameter D, and shaft speed n, at least. Other 
possible parameters are the fl uid density ρ, viscosity μ, and surface roughness ε. Thus 
the performance curves in Fig. 11.7 are equivalent to the following assumed functional 
relations:2
 
gH 5 f1(Q, D, n, ρ, μ, ε)    bhp 5 f2(Q, D, n, ρ, μ, ε) 
(11.21)
This is a straightforward application of dimensional analysis principles from Chap. 
5. As a matter of fact, it was given as an exercise (Example 5.3). For each function 
in Eq. (11.21) there are seven variables and three primary dimensions (M, L, and T); 
hence we expect 7 2 3 5 4 dimensionless pi groups, and that is what we get. You 
can verify as an exercise that appropriate dimensionless forms for Eqs. (11.21) are
 gH
n2D2 5 g1a Q
nD3, ρnD2
μ
, ε
Db
 
bhp
ρn3D5 5 g2a Q
nD3, ρnD2
μ
, ε

(11.22)
2We adopt gH as a variable instead of H for dimensional reasons.

11.3  Pump Performance Curves and Similarity Rules  755
The quantities ρnD2/μ and ε/D are recognized as the Reynolds number and roughness 
ratio, respectively. Three new pump parameters have arisen:
 
Capacity coefficient CQ 5 Q
nD3
 
 
 Head coefficient CH 5 gH
n2D2  
(11.23)
 
 Power coefficient CP 5
bhp
ρn3D5 
Note that only the power coeffi cient contains fl uid density, the parameters CQ and CH 
being kinematic types.
 
Figure 11.7 gives no warning of viscous or roughness effects. The Reynolds 
numbers are from 0.8 to 1.5 3 107, or fully turbulent fl ow in all passages probably. 
The roughness is not given and varies greatly among commercial pumps. But at 
such high Reynolds numbers we expect more or less the same percentage effect on 
all these pumps. Therefore it is common to assume that the Reynolds number and 
the  roughness ratio have a constant effect, so that Eqs. (11.23) reduce to, 
approximately,
 
CH < CH(CQ)    CP < CP(CQ) 
(11.24)
For geometrically similar pumps, we expect head and power coeffi cients to be (nearly) 
unique functions of the capacity coeffi cient. We have to watch out that the pumps are 
geometrically similar or nearly so because (1) manufacturers put different-sized impel-
lers in the same casing, thus violating geometric similarity, and (2) large pumps have 
smaller ratios of roughness and clearances to impeller diameter than small pumps. In 
addition, the more viscous liquids will have signifi cant Reynolds number effects; for 
example, a factor-of-3 or more viscosity increase causes a clearly visible effect on CH 
and CP.
 
The effi ciency η is already dimensionless and is uniquely related to the other three. 
It varies with CQ also:
 
η ;
CHCQ
CP
5 η(CQ)  
(11.25)
We can test Eqs. (11.24) and (11.25) from the data of Fig. 11.7. The impeller diam-
eters of 32 and 38 in are approximately 20 percent different in size, and so their ratio 
of impeller to casing size is the same. The parameters CQ, CH, and CP are computed 
with n in r/s, Q in ft3/s (gal/min 3 2.23 3 1023), H and D in ft, g 5 32.2 ft/s2, and 
brake horsepower in horsepower times 550 ft ? lbf/(s ? hp). The nondimensional data 
are then plotted in Fig. 11.8. A dimensionless suction head coeffi cient is also defi ned:
CHS 5 g(NPSH)
n2D2
5 CHS(CQ) 
(11.26)

756 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
The coeffi cients CP and CHS are seen to correlate almost perfectly into a single func-
tion of CQ, while η and CH data deviate by a few percent. The last two parameters 
are more sensitive to slight discrepancies in model similarity; since the larger pump 
has smaller roughness and clearance ratios and a 40 percent larger Reynolds number, 
it develops slightly more head and is more effi cient. The overall effect is a  resounding 
victory for dimensional analysis.
 
The best effi ciency point in Fig. 11.8 is approximately
CQ* < 0.115    CP* < 0.65
 
ηmax < 0.88 
 
(11.27)
CH* < 5.0
 CHS* < 0.37
These values can be used to estimate the BEP performance of any size pump in this 
geometrically similar family. In like manner, the shutoff head is CH(0) < 6.0, and by 
extrapolation the shutoff power is CP(0) < 0.25 and the maximum discharge is 
CQ,max< 0.23. Note, however, that Fig. 11.8 gives no reliable information about, say, 
the 28- or 35-in impellers in Fig. 11.7, which have a different impeller-to-casing-size 
ratio and thus must be correlated separately.
 
By comparing values of n2D2, nD3, and n3D5 for two pumps in Fig. 11.7, we 
can see readily why the large pump had the same discharge but less power and 
head:

Discharge goes as nD3, which is about the same for both pumps. Head goes as n2D2 
and power as n3D5 for the same ρ (water), and these are about half as much for the 
larger pump. The NPSH goes as n2D2 and is also half as much for the 38-in pump.

Similarity Rules
 
The success of Fig. 11.8 in correlating pump data leads to simple rules for comparing 
pump performance. If pump 1 and pump 2 are from the same geometric family and 
are operating at homologous points (the same dimensionless position on a chart such 
as Fig. 11.8), their fl ow rates, heads, and powers will be related as follows:

These are the similarity rules, which can be used to estimate the effect of changing 
the fl uid, speed, or size on any dynamic turbomachine—pump or turbine—within a 
geometrically similar family. A graphic display of these rules is given in Fig. 11.9, 
showing the effect of speed and diameter changes on pump performance. In Fig. 11.9a 
the size is held constant and the speed is varied 20 percent, while Fig. 11.9b shows 
a 20 percent size change at constant speed. The curves are plotted to scale but with 
arbitrary units. The speed effect (Fig. 11.9a) is substantial, but the size effect 
(Fig. 11.9b) is even more dramatic, especially for power, which varies as D5.  Generally 
we see that a given pump family can be adjusted in size and speed to fi t a variety of 
system characteristics.
 
Strictly speaking, we would expect for perfect similarity that η1 5 η2, but we have 
seen that larger pumps are more effi cient, having a higher Reynolds number and lower 
roughness and clearance ratios. Two empirical correlations are recommended for 

11.3  Pump Performance Curves and Similarity Rules  759
maximum effi ciency. One, developed by Moody [43] for turbines but also used for 
pumps, is a size effect. The other, suggested by Anderson [44] from thousands of 
pump tests, is a fl ow rate effect:

(11.29b)
Anderson’s formula (11.29b) makes the practical observation that even an infi nitely 
large pump will have losses. He thus proposes a maximum possible effi ciency of 
94 percent, rather than 100 percent. Anderson recommends that the same formula be 
used for turbines if the constant 0.94 is replaced by 0.95. The formulas in Eq. (11.29) 
assume the same value of surface roughness for both machines—one could micropo-
lish a small pump and achieve the effi ciency of a larger machine.
Effect of Viscosity
 
Centrifugal pumps are often used to pump oils and other viscous liquids up to 1000 times 
the viscosity of water. But the Reynolds numbers become low turbulent or even laminar, 
with a strong effect on performance. Figure 11.10 shows typical test curves of head and 
brake horsepower versus discharge. High viscosity causes a dramatic drop in head and 
discharge and increases in power requirements. The effi ciency also drops substantially 
according to the following typical results:

Beyond about 300μwater the deterioration in performance is so great that a positive-

11.4 Mixed- and Axial-Flow 
Pumps: The Specifi c Speed
 
We have seen from the previous section that the modern centrifugal pump is a for-
midable device, able to deliver very high heads and reasonable fl ow rates with excel-
lent effi ciency. It can match many system requirements. But basically the centrifugal 
pump is a high-head, low-fl ow machine, whereas there are many applications requir-
ing low head and high discharge. To see that the centrifugal design is not convenient 
for such systems, consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 11.5
We want to use a centrifugal pump from the family of Fig. 11.8 to deliver 100,000 gal/min 
of water at 608F with a head of 25 ft. What should be (a) the pump size and speed and 
(b) brake horsepower, assuming operation at best effi ciency?

Other dynamic pump designs provide low head and high discharge. For example, 
there is a type of 38-in, 710 r/min pump, with the same input parameters as Fig. 11.7b, 
which will deliver the 25-ft head and 100,000 gal/min fl ow rate called for in 
 Example 11.5. This is done by allowing the fl ow to pass through the impeller with 
an axial-fl ow component and less centrifugal component. The passages can be opened 
up to the increased fl ow rate with very little size increase, but the drop in radial outlet 
velocity decreases the head produced. These are the mixed-fl ow (part radial, part 
axial) and axial-fl ow (propeller-type) families of dynamic pump. Some vane designs 
are sketched in Fig. 11.11, which introduces an interesting new “design” parameter, 
the specifi c speed Ns or Ns9.

The Specifi c Speed
 
Most pump applications involve a known head and discharge for the particular system, 
plus a speed range dictated by electric motor speeds or cavitation requirements. The 
designer then selects the best size and shape (centrifugal, mixed, axial) for the pump. 
To help this selection, we need a dimensionless parameter involving speed, discharge, 
and head but not size. This is accomplished by eliminating the diameter between 
CQ and CH, applying the result only to the BEP. This ratio is called the specifi c speed
and has both a dimensionless form and a somewhat lazy, practical form:
Rigorous form: 
N¿s 5
C1/2
Q*
C3/4
H*
5 n(Q*)1/2
(gH*)3/4  
(11.30a)
Lazy but common: 
Ns 5 (r/min)(gal/min)1/2
3H (ft) 43/4
 
(11.30b)
In other words, practicing engineers do not bother to change n to revolutions per 
second or Q* to cubic feet per second or to include gravity with head, although the 
latter would be necessary for, say, a pump on the moon. The conversion factor is
Ns 5 17,182N¿s
Note that Ns is applied only to BEP; thus a single number characterizes an entire 
family of pumps. For example, the family of Fig. 11.8 has Ns9 < (0.115)1/2/(5.0)3/4 5
0.1014, Ns 5 1740, regardless of size or speed.
 
It turns out that the specifi c speed is directly related to the most effi cient pump 
design, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Low Ns means low Q and high H, hence a centrifugal 
pump, and large Ns implies an axial pump. The centrifugal pump is best for Ns
between 500 and 4000, the mixed-fl ow pump for Ns between 4000 and 10,000, and 
the axial-fl ow pump for Ns above 10,000. Note the changes in impeller shape as Ns
increases.
Suction Specifi c Speed
 
If we use NPSH rather than H in Eq. (11.30), the result is called suction-specifi c speed:
Rigorous: 
N¿ss 5
nQ1/2
(g NPSH)3/4  
(11.31a)
Lazy: 
Nss 5 (r/min)(gal/min)1/2
3NPSH (ft)4 3/4
 
(11.31b)
where NPSH denotes the available suction head of the system. Data from Wislicenus 
[4] show that a given pump is in danger of inlet cavitation if
N¿ss $ 0.47    Nss $ 8100
In the absence of test data, this relation can be used, given n and Q, to estimate the 
minimum required NPSH.

11.4  Mixed- and Axial-Flow Pumps: The Specifi c Speed 763
Axial-Flow Pump Theory
 
A multistage axial-fl ow geometry is shown in Fig. 11.12a. The fl uid essentially passes 
almost axially through alternate rows of fi xed stator blades and moving rotor blades. 
The incompressible fl ow assumption is frequently used even for gases because the 
pressure rise per stage is usually small.
 
The simplifi ed vector diagram analysis assumes that the fl ow is one-dimensional and 
leaves each blade row at a relative velocity exactly parallel to the exit blade angle. 
Figure 11.12b shows the stator blades and their exit velocity diagram. Since the stator 
is fi xed, ideally the absolute velocity V1 is parallel to the trailing edge of the blade. 
After vectorially subtracting the rotor tangential velocity u from V1, we obtain the veloc-
ity w1 relative to the rotor, which ideally should be parallel to the rotor leading edge.
 
Figure 11.12c shows the rotor blades and their exit velocity diagram. Here the 
relative velocity w2 is parallel to the blade trailing edge, while the absolute velocity 
V2 should be designed to smoothly enter the next row of stator blades.

764 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
 
The theoretical power and head are given by Euler’s turbine relation (11.11). Since 
there is no radial fl ow, the inlet and exit rotor speeds are equal, u1 5 u2, and one-
dimensional continuity requires that the axial-velocity component remain constant:
Vn1 5 Vn2 5 Vn 5 Q
A 5 const
From the geometry of the velocity diagrams, the normal velocity (or volume fl ow) 
can be directly related to the blade rotational speed u:
 
u 5 ωrav 5 Vn1(cot α1 1 cot β1) 5 Vn2(cot α2 1 cot β2) 
(11.32)
Thus the fl ow rate can be predicted from the rotational speed and the blade angles. 
Meanwhile, since Vt1 5 Vn1 cot α1 and Vt2 5 u 2 Vn2 cot β2, Euler’s relation (11.11) 
for the pump head becomes
 gH 5 uVn(cot α2 2 cot α1)
 
 5 u2 2 uVn(cot α1 1 cot β2) 
(11.33)
the preferred form because it relates to the blade angles α1 and β2. The shutoff or 
no-fl ow head is seen to be H0 5 u2/g, just as in Eq. (11.18) for a centrifugal pump. 
The blade-angle parameter cot α1 1 cot β2 can be designed to be negative, zero, or 
positive, corresponding to a rising, fl at, or falling head curve, as in Fig. 11.5.
 
Strictly speaking, Eq. (11.33) applies only to a single streamtube of radius r, but it 
is a good approximation for very short blades if r denotes the average radius. For long 
blades it is customary to sum Eq. (11.33) in radial strips over the blade area. Such 
complexity may not be warranted since theory, being idealized, neglects losses and 
usually predicts the head and power larger than those in actual pump performance.
Performance of an 
Axial-Flow Pump
 
At high specifi c speeds, the most effi cient choice is an axial-fl ow, or propeller, pump, 
which develops high fl ow rate and low head. A typical dimensionless chart for a 
propeller pump is shown in Fig. 11.13. Note, as expected, the higher CQ and lower 
CH compared with Fig. 11.8. The head curve drops sharply with discharge, so a large 
system head change will cause a mild fl ow change. The power curve drops with head 
also, which means a possible overloading condition if the system discharge should 
suddenly decrease. Finally, the effi ciency curve is rather narrow and triangular, as 
opposed to the broad, parabolic-shaped centrifugal pump effi ciency (Fig. 11.8).
 
By inspection of Fig. 11.13, CQ* < 0.55, CH* < 1.07, CP* < 0.70, and ηmax < 0.84. 
From this we compute Ns9 < (0.55)1/2/(1.07)3/4 5 0.705, Ns 5 12,000. The relatively 
low effi ciency is due to small pump size: d 5 14 in, n 5 690 r/min, Q* 5 4400 gal/min.
 
A repetition of Example 11.5 using Fig. 11.13 would show that this propeller pump 
family can provide a 25-ft head and 100,000 gal/min discharge if D 5 46 in and 
n 5 430 r/min, with bhp 5 750; this is a much more reasonable design solution, with 
improvements still possible at larger-Ns conditions.
Pump Performance versus 
Specifi c Speed
 
Specifi c speed is such an effective parameter that it is used as an indicator of both 
performance and effi ciency. Figure 11.14 shows a correlation of the optimum effi -
ciency of a pump as a function of the specifi c speed and capacity. Because the 

11.4  Mixed- and Axial-Flow Pumps: The Specifi c Speed 765
dimensional parameter Q is a rough measure of both size and Reynolds number, η 
increases with Q. When this type of correlation was fi rst published by Wislicenus [4] 
in 1947, it became known as the pump curve, a challenge to all manufacturers. We 
can check that the pumps of Figs. 11.7 and 11.13 fi t the correlation very well.

Figure 11.15 shows the effect of specifi c speed on the shape of the pump performance 
curves, normalized with respect to the BEP point. The numerical values shown are 
representative but somewhat qualitative. The high-specifi c-speed pumps (Ns < 10,000) 
have head and power curves that drop sharply with discharge, implying overload or start-
up problems at low fl ow. Their effi ciency curve is very narrow.
 
A low-specifi c-speed pump (Ns 5 600) has a broad effi ciency curve, a rising power 
curve, and a head curve that “droops” at shutoff, implying possible surge or hunting 
problems.
The Free Propeller
 
The propeller-style pump of Fig. 11.12 is enclosed in a duct and captures all the 
approach fl ow. In contrast, the free propeller, for either aircraft or marine applications, 
acts in an unbounded fl uid and thus is much less effective. The analog of propeller-
pump pressure rise is the free propeller thrust per unit area (πD2/4) swept out by the 
blades. In a customary dimensional analysis, thrust T and power required P are func-
tions of fl uid density ρ, rotation rate n (rev/s), forward velocity V, and propeller 
diameter D. Viscosity effects are small and neglected. You might enjoy analyzing this 
as a Chap. 5 assignment. The NACA (now the NASA) chose (ρ, n, D) as repeating 
variables, and the results are the accepted parameters:
 CT 5 thrust coefficient 5

ρn2D4 5 fcn(J), J 5 advance ratio 5 V
nD
 
 CP 5 power coefficient 5
P
ρn3D5 5 fcn(J), η 5 efficiency 5 VT
P 5 JCT
CP
 
(11.34)
The advance ratio, J, which compares forward velocity to a measure proportional to 
blade tip speed, has a strong effect upon thrust and power.
 
Figure 11.16 shows performance data for a propeller used on the Cessna 172 air-
craft. The thrust and power coeffi cients are small, of (0.05), and are multiplied by 
10 for plotting convenience. Maximum effi ciency is 83 percent at J 5 0.7, where 
CT* < 0.040 and CP* < 0.034.
 
There are several engineering methods for designing propellers. These theories are 
described in specialized texts, both for marine [60] and aircraft [61] propellers.

11.5  Matching Pumps to System Characteristics 767
Computational Fluid Dynamics
 
The design of turbomachinery has traditionally been highly experimental, with simple 
theories, such as in Sec. 11.2, only able to predict trends. Dimensionless correlations, 
such as Fig. 11.15, are useful but require extensive experimentation. Consider that 
fl ow in a pump is three-dimensional; unsteady (both periodic and turbulent); and 
involves fl ow separation, recirculation in the impeller, unsteady blade wakes passing 
through the diffuser, and blade roots, tips, and clearances. It is no wonder that one-
dimensional theory cannot give fi rm quantitative predictions.
 
Modern computer analysis can give realistic results and is becoming a useful tool 
for turbomachinery designers. A good example is Ref. 56, reporting combined experi-
mental and computational results for a centrifugal pump diffuser. A photograph of 
the device is shown in Fig. 11.17a. It is made of clear Perspex, so that laser measure-
ments of particle tracking velocimetry (LPTV) and doppler anemometry (LDA) could 
be taken throughout the system. The data were compared with a CFD simulation of 
the impeller and diffuser, using the grids shown in Fig. 11.17b. The computations 
used a turbulence formulation called the k-ε model, popular in commercial CFD 
codes (see Sec. 8.9). Results were good but not excellent. The CFD model predicted 
velocity and pressure data adequately up until fl ow separation, after which it was 
only qualitative. Clearly, CFD is developing a signifi cant role in turbomachinery 
design [42, 45].
11.5 Matching Pumps to System 
Characteristics
 
The ultimate test of a pump is its match with the operating system characteristics. 
Physically, the system head must match the head produced by the pump, and this 
intersection should occur in the region of best effi ciency.

where S K denotes minor losses and V is the fl ow velocity in the principal pipe. 
Since V is proportional to the pump discharge Q, the equation represents a system 
head curve Hs(Q). Three examples are shown in Fig. 11.18: a static head Hs 5 a, 
static head plus laminar friction Hs 5 a 1 bQ, and static head plus turbulent  friction 
Hs 5 a 1 cQ2. The intersection of the system curve with the pump performance 
curve H(Q) defi nes the operating point. In Fig. 11.18 the laminar friction operating 
point is at maximum effi ciency while the turbulent and static curves are off design. 
This may be unavoidable if system variables change, but the pump should be 
changed in size or speed if its operating point is consistently off design. Of course, 
a perfect match may not be possible because commercial pumps have only certain 
discrete sizes and speeds. Let us illustrate these concepts with an example.

We can plot Eq. (2) on Fig. 11.7a and see where it intersects the 32-in pump head curve, as in

11.5  Matching Pumps to System Characteristics 771
Pumps Combined in Parallel
 
If a pump provides the right head but too little discharge, a possible remedy is to 
combine two similar pumps in parallel, sharing the same suction and inlet conditions. 
A parallel arrangement is also used if delivery demand varies, so that one pump is 
used at low fl ow and the second pump is started up for higher discharges. Both pumps 
should have check valves to avoid backfl ow when one is shut down.
 
The two pumps in parallel need not be identical. Physically, their fl ow rates will 
sum for the same head, as illustrated in Fig. 11.19a. If pump A has more head than 
pump B, pump B cannot be added in until the operating head is below the shutoff 
head of pump B. Since the system curve rises with Q, the combined delivery QA1B 
will be less than the separate operating discharges QA 1 QB but certainly greater than

either one. For a very fl at (static) curve two similar pumps in parallel will deliver 
nearly twice the fl ow. The combined brake horsepower is found by adding brake 
horsepower for each of pumps A and B at the same head as the operating point. The 
combined effi ciency equals ρg(QA1B)(HA1B)/(550 bhpA1B).
 
If pumps A and B are not identical, as in Fig. 11.19a, pump B should not be run 
and cannot even be started up if the operating point is above its shutoff head.
Pumps Combined in Series
 
If a pump provides the right discharge but too little head, consider adding a similar 
pump in series, with the output of pump B fed directly into the suction side of 
pump A. As sketched in Fig. 11.19b, the physical principle for summing in series 
is that the two heads add at the same fl ow rate to give the combined performance 
curve. The two need not be identical at all, since they merely handle the same 
discharge; they may even have different speeds, although normally both are driven 
by the same shaft.
 
The need for a series arrangement implies that the system curve is steep, that is, 
it requires higher head than either pump A or B can provide. The combined operating 
point head will be more than either A or B separately but not as great as their sum. 
The combined power is the sum of brake horsepower for A and B at the operating 
point fl ow rate. The combined effi ciency is
ρg(QA1B)(HA1B)
550 bhpA1B
similar to parallel pumps.
 
Whether pumps are used in series or in parallel, the arrangement will be uneco-
nomical unless both pumps are operating near their best effi ciency.
Multistage Pumps
 
For very high heads in continuous operation, the solution is a multistage pump, with 
the exit of one impeller feeding directly into the eye of the next. Centrifugal, mixed-
fl ow, and axial-fl ow pumps have all been grouped in as many as 50 stages, with heads 
up to 8000 ft of water and pressure rises up to 5000 lbf/in2 absolute. Figure 11.20 shows 
a section of a seven-stage centrifugal propane compressor that develops 300 lbf/in2 rise 
at 40,000 ft3/min and 35,000 bhp.
Compressors
 
Most of the discussion in this chapter concerns incompressible fl ow—that is, negli-
gible change in fl uid density. Even the pump of Fig. 11.7, which can produce 600 ft 
of head at 1170 r/min, will increase standard air pressure only by 46 lbf/ft2, about a 
2 percent change in density. The picture changes at higher speeds, Dp ~ n2, and 
multiple stages, where very large changes in pressure and density are achieved. Such 
devices are called compressors, as in Fig. 11.20. The concept of static head, H 5 Dp/ρg, 
becomes inappropriate, since ρ varies. Compressor performance is measured by 
(1) the pressure ratio across the stage p2/p1 and (2) the change in stagnation enthalpy 
(h02 2 h01), where h0 5 h 1 1
2V2 (see Sec. 9.3). Combining m stages in series results 
in pfi nal/pinitial < (p2/p1)m. As density increases, less area is needed: note the decrease 
in impeller size from right to left in Fig. 11.20. Compressors may be either of the 
centrifugal or axial-fl ow type [21 to 23].

11.5  Matching Pumps to System Characteristics 773
 
Compressor effi ciency, from inlet condition 1 to fi nal outlet f, is defi ned by the 
change in gas enthalpy, assuming an adiabatic process:
ηcomp 5
hf 2 h01
h0f 2 h01
<
Tf 2 T01
T0f 2 T01
Compressor effi ciencies are similar to hydraulic machines (ηmax < 70 to 80 percent), 
but the mass fl ow range is more limited: on the low side by compressor surge, where 
blade stall and vibration occur, and on the high side by choking (Sec. 9.4), where the

EXAMPLE 11.7
Investigate extending Example 11.6 by using two 32-in pumps in parallel to deliver more 
fl ow. Is this effi cient?
Solution
Since the pumps are identical, each delivers 1
2Q at the same 1170 r/min speed. The system 
curve is the same, and the balance-of-head relation becomes
H 5 490 2 0.26(1
2Q)2 5 120 1 1.335Q2
or 
Q2 5
490 2 120
1.335 1 0.065    Q 5 16,300 gal/min 
Ans.
This is only 7 percent more than a single pump. Each pump delivers 1
2Q 5 8130 gal/min, for 
which the effi ciency is only 60 percent. The total brake horsepower required is 3200, whereas 
a single pump used only 2000 bhp. This is a poor design.
EXAMPLE 11.8
Suppose the elevation change in Example 11.6 is raised from 120 to 500 ft, greater than a 
single 32-in pump can supply. Investigate using two 32-in pumps in series at 1170 r/min.
Solution
Since the pumps are identical, the total head is twice as much and the constant 120 in the 
 system head curve is replaced by 500. The balance of heads becomes
H 5 2(490 2 0.26Q2) 5 500 1 1.335Q2
or 
Q2 5
980 2 500
1.335 1 0.52    Q 5 16.1 3 103 gal/min 
Ans.
The operating head is 500 1 1.335(16.1)2 5 845 ft, or 97 percent more than that for a single 
pump in Example 11.5. Each pump is operating at 16.1 3 103 gal/min, which from Fig. 11.7a 
is 83 percent effi cient, a pretty good match to the system. To pump at this operating point 
requires 4100 bhp, or about 2050 bhp for each pump.
Gas Turbines
 
Some modern devices contain both pumps and turbines. A classic case is the gas 
turbine, which combines a compressor, a combustion chamber, a turbine, and, often, 
a fan. Gas turbines are used to drive aircraft, helicopters, Army tanks, and small 
electric power plants. They have a higher power-to-weight ratio than reciprocating 
engines, but they spin at very high speeds and require high-temperature materials and 
thus are costly. The compressor raises the inlet air to pressures as much as 30 to 
40 times higher, before entering the combustion chamber. The heated air then passes 
through a turbine, which drives the compressor. The airfl ow then exits to provide the 
thrust and is generally a supersonic fl ow.

11.6  Turbines 775
 
The example illustrated in Fig. 11.21 is a Pratt & Whitney 6000 turbofan aircraft 
engine. The large entrance fan greatly increases the airfl ow into the engine, some of 
which bypasses the compressors. The central fl ow enters a low-pressure (LPC) and a 
high-pressure (HPC) compressor and thence into the combustor. After combustion, 
the hot, high-velocity gases pass through a high-pressure turbine (HPT), which drives 
the HPC, and a low-pressure turbine (LPT), which separately drives both the LPC 
and the fan. The exhaust gases then create the thrust in the usual momentum–exchange 
manner. The engine shown, designed for shorter airline fl ights, has a maximum thrust 
of 24,000 lbf.
11.6 Turbines
 
A turbine extracts energy from a fl uid that possesses high head, but it is fatuous to 
say a turbine is a pump run backward. Basically there are two types, reaction and 
impulse, the difference lying in the manner of head conversion. In the reaction  turbine, 
the fl uid fi lls the blade passages, and the head change or pressure drop occurs within 
the impeller. Reaction designs are of the radial-fl ow, mixed-fl ow, and axial-fl ow types 
and are essentially dynamic devices designed to admit the high-energy fl uid and 
extract its momentum. An impulse turbine fi rst converts the high head through a 
nozzle into a high-velocity jet, which then strikes the blades at one position as they 
pass by. The impeller passages are not fl uid-fi lled, and the jet fl ow past the blades is 
essentially at constant pressure. Reaction turbines are smaller because fl uid fi lls all 
the blades at one time.
Reaction Turbines
 
Reaction turbines are low-head, high-fl ow devices. The fl ow is opposite that in a pump, 
entering at the larger-diameter section and discharging through the eye after giving up 
most of its energy to the impeller. Early designs were very ineffi cient because they 
lacked stationary guide vanes at the entrance to direct the fl ow smoothly into the 
impeller passages. The fi rst effi cient inward-fl ow turbine was built in 1849 by James B. 
Francis, a U.S. engineer, and all radial- or mixed-fl ow designs are now called Francis 
turbines. At still lower heads, a turbine can be designed more compactly with purely 
axial fl ow and is termed a propeller turbine [52]. The propeller may be either fi xed-
blade or adjustable (Kaplan type), the latter being complicated mechanically but much

more effi cient at low-power settings. Figure 11.22 shows sketches of runner designs 
for Francis radial, Francis mixed-fl ow, and propeller-type turbines.
Idealized Radial Turbine Theory
 
The Euler turbomachine formulas (11.11) also apply to energy-extracting machines if 
we reverse the fl ow direction and reshape the blades. Figure 11.23 shows a radial turbine 
runner. Again assume one-dimensional frictionless fl ow through the blades. Adjustable 
inlet guide vanes are absolutely necessary for good effi ciency. They bring the inlet fl ow 
to the blades at angle α2 and absolute velocity V2 for minimum “shock” or 
 directional-mismatch loss. After vectorially adding in the runner tip speed u2 5 ωr2, the 
outer blade angle should be set at angle β2 to accommodate the relative velocity w2, as 
shown in the fi gure. (See Fig. 11.4 for the analogous radial pump velocity diagrams.)
 
Application of the angular momentum control volume theorem, Eq. (3.59), to 
Fig. 11.23 (see Example 3.18 for a similar case) yields an idealized formula for the 
power P extracted by the runner:
 
P 5 ωT 5 ρωQ(r2Vt2 2 r1Vt1) 5 ρQ(u2V2 cos α2 2 u1V1 cos α1) (11.35)
where Vt2 and Vt1 are the absolute inlet and outlet circumferential velocity components 
of the fl ow. Note that Eq. (11.35) is identical to Eq. (11.11) for a radial pump, except 
that the blade shapes are different.
 
The absolute inlet normal velocity Vn2 5 V2 sin α2 is proportional to the fl ow rate Q. 
If the fl ow rate changes and the runner speed u2 is constant, the vanes must be adjusted 
to a new angle α2 so that w2 still follows the blade surface. Thus adjustable inlet 
vanes are very important to avoid shock loss.

divided by the available water horsepower ρgQH. The dimensionless forms are CQ,

Note that Nsp, like Ns for pumps, is defi ned only with respect to the BEP and has a 
single value for a given turbine family. In Fig. 11.22d, Nsp 5 273.3(2.70)1/2/(9.03)5/4 5 29, 
regardless of size.
 
Like pumps, turbines of large size are generally more effi cient, and Eqs. (11.29) 
can be used as an estimate when data are lacking.
 
The design of a complete large-scale power-generating turbine system is a major 
engineering project, involving inlet and outlet ducts, trash racks, guide vanes, wicket 
gates, spiral cases, generator with cooling coils, bearings and transmission gears, 
 runner blades, draft tubes, and automatic controls. Some typical large-scale reaction 
turbine designs are shown in Fig. 11.24. The reversible pump-and-turbine design of 
Fig. 11.24d requires special care for adjustable guide vanes to be effi cient for fl ow in 
either direction.
 
The largest (1000-MW) hydropower designs are awesome when viewed on a human 
scale, as shown in Fig. 11.25. The economic advantages of small-scale model testing 
are evident from this photograph of the Francis turbine units at Grand Coulee Dam.
Impulse Turbines
 
For high head and relatively low power (that is, low Nsp) not only would a reaction 
turbine require too high a speed but also the high pressure in the runner would require 
a massive casing thickness. The impulse turbine of Fig. 11.26 is ideal for this situa-
tion. Since Nsp is low, n will be low and the high pressure is confi ned to the small 
nozzle, which converts the head to an atmospheric pressure jet of high velocity Vj. 
The jet strikes the buckets and imparts a momentum change similar to that in our 
control volume analysis for a moving vane in Example 3.9 or Prob. P3.51. The 
 buckets have an elliptical split-cup shape, as in Fig. 11.26b. They are named Pelton 
wheels, after Lester A. Pelton (1829–1908), who produced the fi rst effi cient design.
 
In Example 3.10 we found that the force per unit mass fl ow on a single moving 
vane, or in this case a single Pelton bucket, was (Vj 2 u)(1 2 cos β), where u is the 
vane velocity and β is the exit angle of the jet. For a single vane, as in Example 3.10, 
the mass fl ow would be ρAj(Vj 2 u), but for a Pelton wheel, where buckets keep 
entering the jet and capture all the fl ow, the mass fl ow would be ρQ 5 ρAjVj. An 
alternative analysis uses the Euler turbomachine equation (11.11) and the velocity 
diagram of Fig. 11.26c. Noting that u1 5 u2 5 u, we substitute the absolute exit and 
inlet tangential velocities into the turbine power relation:
P 5 ρQ(u1Vt1 2 u2Vt2) 5 ρQ5uVj 2 u3u 1 (Vj 2 u)cos β46
or 
P 5 ρQu(Vj 2 u)(1 2 cos β)

where u 5 2πnr is the bucket linear velocity and r is the pitch radius, or distance to 
the jet centerline. A bucket angle β 5 1808 gives maximum power but is physically 
impractical. In practice, β < 1658, or 1 2 cos β < 1.966 or only 2 percent less than 
maximum power.

Figure 11.28 shows the optimum effi ciency of the three turbine types, and the 
importance of the power specifi c speed Nsp as a selection tool for the designer. These 
effi ciencies are optimum and are obtained in careful design of large machines.
 
The water power available to a turbine may vary due to either net head or fl ow rate 
changes, both of which are common in fi eld installations such as hydroelectric plants. 
The demand for turbine power also varies from light to heavy, and the operating response 
is a change in the fl ow rate by adjustment of a gate valve or needle valve (Fig. 11.26a). 
As shown in Fig. 11.29, all three turbine types achieve fairly uniform effi ciency as a 
function of the level of power being extracted. Especially effective is the adjustable-
blade (Kaplan-type) propeller turbine, while the poorest is a fi xed-blade propeller. The 
term rated power in Fig. 11.29 is the largest power delivery guaranteed by the manu-
facturer, as opposed to normal power, which is delivered at maximum effi ciency.
 
For further details of design and operation of turbomachinery, the readable and 
interesting treatment in Ref. 33 is especially recommended. The feasibility of micro-
hydropower is discussed in Refs. 27, 28, and 46.

Investigate the possibility of using (a) a Pelton wheel similar to Fig. 11.27 or (b) the  Francis 
turbine family of Fig. 11.22d to deliver 30,000 bhp from a net head of 1200 ft.
Solution
Part (a) 
From Fig. 11.28, the most effi cient Pelton wheel occurs at about
Nsp < 4.5 5 (r/min)(30,000 bhp)1/2

Ans. (a)
This Pelton wheel is perhaps a little slow and a trifl e large. You could reduce D and increase n 
by increasing Nsp to, say, 6 or 7 and accepting the slight reduction in effi ciency. Or you could 
use a double-hung, two-wheel confi guration, each delivering 15,000 bhp, which changes D 
and n by the factor 21/2:
Double wheel: 
n 5 (183)21/2 5 260 r/min    D 5 13.6

The Francis wheel of Fig. 11.22d must have
Nsp 5 29 5 (r/min)(30,000 bhp)1/2

This is a faster speed than normal practice, and the casing would have to withstand 1200 ft of 
water or about 520 lbf/in2 internal pressure, but the 40-in size is extremely attractive. Francis 
turbines are now being operated at heads up to 1500 ft.
Wind Turbines
 
Wind energy has long been used as a source of mechanical power. The familiar four-
bladed windmills of Holland, England, and the Greek islands have been used for 
centuries to pump water, grind grain, and saw wood. Modern research concentrates 
on the ability of wind turbines to generate electric power. Koeppl [47] stresses the 
potential for propeller-type machines. See also Refs. 47 to 51.

784 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
 
Some examples of wind turbine designs are shown in Fig. 11.30. The familiar 
American multiblade farm windmill (Fig. 11.30a) is of low effi ciency, but thousands 
are in use as a rugged, reliable, and inexpensive way to pump water. A more effi cient 
design is the propeller mill in Fig. 11.30b, similar to the pioneering Smith-Putnam 
1250-kW two-bladed system that operated on Grampa’s Knob, 12 mi west of Rutland, 
Vermont, from 1941 to 1945. The Smith-Putnam design broke because of inadequate 
blade strength, but it withstood winds up to 115 mi/h and its effi ciency was amply 
demonstrated [47].
 
The Dutch, American multiblade, and propeller mills are examples of horizontal-
axis wind turbines (HAWTs), which are effi cient but somewhat awkward in that they 
require extensive bracing and gear systems when combined with an electric generator. 
Thus a competing family of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) has been proposed 
to simplify gearing and strength requirements. Figure 11.30c shows the “eggbeater” 
VAWT invented by G. J. M. Darrieus in 1925. To minimize centrifugal stresses, the 
twisted blades of the Darrieus turbine follow a troposkien curve formed by a chain 
anchored at two points on a spinning vertical rod. The Darrieus design has the advan-
tage that the generator and gearbox may be placed on the ground for easy access. It 
is not as effi cient, though, as a HAWT, and, furthermore, it is not self-starting. The 
largest Darrieus device known to the writer is a 4.2 MW turbine, 100 m in diameter, 
at Cap Chat, Québec, Canada.
 
The four-arm Dutch-type windmill in Fig. 11.30d is found throughout Europe and 
the Middle East and dates back to the 9th century. In the Netherlands, they are pri-
marily used to drain lowlands. The mill in the photo was built in 1787 to grind corn. 
It is now a Rhode Island tourist attraction.
Idealized Wind Turbine Theory
 
The ideal, frictionless effi ciency of a propeller windmill was predicted by A. Betz in 
1920, using the simulation shown in Fig. 11.31. The propeller is represented by an 
actuator disk, which creates across the propeller plane a pressure discontinuity of area 
A and local velocity V. The wind is represented by a streamtube of approach velocity 
V1 and a slower downstream wake velocity V2. The pressure rises to pb just before 
the disk and drops to pa just after, returning to free-stream pressure in the far wake. 
To hold the propeller rigid when it is extracting energy from the wind, there must be 
a leftward force F on its support, as shown.
 
A control-volume–horizontal-momentum relation applied between sections 1 and 
2 gives
a Fx 5 2F 5 m# (V2 2 V1)
A similar relation for a control volume just before and after the disk gives
a Fx 5 2F 1 ( pb 2 pa)A 5 m# (Va 2 Vb) 5 0
Equating these two yields the propeller force:
 
F 5 ( pb 2 pa)A 5 m# (V1 2 V2)

or

Continuity and momentum thus require that the velocity V through the disk equal the 
average of the wind and far-wake speeds.
 
Finally, the power extracted by the disk can be written in terms of V1 and V2 by 
combining Eqs. (11.42) and (11.43):

(11.47)
This is called the Betz number and serves as an ideal with which to compare the actual 
performance of real windmills.
 
Figure 11.32 shows the measured power coeffi cients of various wind turbine 
designs. The independent variable is not V2/V1 (which is artifi cial and convenient only 
in the ideal theory) but the ratio of blade-tip speed ωr to wind speed. Note that the 
tip can move much faster than the wind, a fact disturbing to the laity but familiar to 
engineers in the behavior of iceboats and sailing vessels. The Darrieus has the many 
advantages of a vertical axis but has little torque at low speeds (see Fig. 11.32) and 
also rotates more slowly at maximum power than a propeller, thus requiring a higher 
gear ratio for the generator. The Savonius rotor (Fig. 6.29b) has been suggested as a 
VAWT design because it produces power at very low wind speeds, but it is ineffi cient 
and susceptible to storm damage because it cannot be feathered in high winds.
 
As shown in Fig. 11.33, there are many areas of the world where wind energy is 
an attractive alternative, such as Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Argentina, Chile, 
New Zealand, and Newfoundland. Robinson [53] points out that Australia, with only 
moderate winds, could generate half its electricity with wind turbines. Inexhaustible 
and available, the winds, coupled with low-cost turbine designs, promise a bright 
future for this alternative.

With fossil fuel limited, and increasing worry about global warming, the prospects 
for wind power are assured. Global wind speed data by Archer and Jacobsen [62] 
show that harnessing a modest fraction of available wind energy could supply all of 
the earth’s electricity needs. No one expects that to happen, but the American Wind 
Energy Association [59] projects that 20 percent of America’s power could be wind 
generated by the year 2030.
 
Up until 2010, the United States had the most wind-power capacity in the world, 
but China has recently taken over fi rst place, as shown in the following table.

Summary 789
Since China’s installations are generally less breezy, the United States actually leads 
in total annual wind energy generated, 120 terawatt-hours to 73 for China. The growth 
in wind energy generation is excellent, but 283 GW is still only 2.5 percent of total 
world energy needs. Most of the future growth will probably be land-based, because 
of the high costs of construction, transmission, and maintenance of offshore wind 
turbines. In the United States, emphasis has shifted to localized turbines, due to the 
high cost of transmission lines from isolated wind farms. For example, three separate 
large (1.5 MW) turbines are now being proposed for the writer’s small seaside village. 
In general, costs will be high, and the political debate fractious, but the future of wind 
energy seems bright.
New Developments in Wind 
Turbine Technology
 
Wind turbines are a large “green” part of our energy future, but wind energy,  especially 
on offshore locations, is expensive compared to fossil-fuel power plants. The chief 
burden is the cost of manufacturing and installing the turbines. The U.S. Department 
of Energy states that offshore wind power is the most expensive of the large-scale 
systems.
 
Leases have been granted for offshore turbines near Cape Cod, Rhode Island, and 
Delaware. The Cape Wind project is proposing an initial cost, to the ground-based 
utility, of 19 ¢/kWh. The proposal from the Rhode Island project, Deepwater Wind, 
calls for 24 ¢/kWh. Since electric generation by fossil-fuel plants cost about 8 ¢/kWh, 
the environmental benefi ts of wind turbines, with no CO2 or SO2 pollution, are 
 balanced by greatly increased costs to the consumer.
 
There are many proposals to lessen wind power costs. Here we list three.
1. Floating offshore turbines. This avoids the problem of imbedding towers in 
deeper water and allows putting the system farther from shore. For example, a 
2300 kW fl oating turbine was installed recently off the coast of Norway. 
2. Replacing a giant onshore HAWT with an array of small VAWTs. Today’s 
massive horizontal-axis propellers, with diameters as large as 100 meters, cost 
more to install than many small, shorter vertical-axis turbines. The vertical 
array would have generators on the ground and thus be easier to access. 
However, many, perhaps hundreds, of the smaller turbines would be required. 
This idea is best suited for remote locations.
3. Tethered shrouded-balloon turbines. A buoyant, ring-shaped shroud, with a 
turbine inside, can be deployed at high altitudes, where winds are two to three 
times higher.
Figure 11.34 shows an experimental design by Altaeros Energies, Inc. The shroud also 
helps draw in more wind than a free propeller. Installation costs are less. For the test in 
Fig. 11.34, the turbine at 350 ft produced twice as much power compared to ground level. 
In 2014 a large Altaeros balloon turbine was purchased by the city of Fairbanks, Alaska.
Summary
 
Turbomachinery design is perhaps the most practical and most active application of 
the principles of fl uid mechanics. There are billions of pumps and turbines in use in 
the world, and thousands of companies are seeking improvements. This chapter has 

790 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
discussed both positive-displacement devices and, more extensively, rotodynamic 
machines. With the centrifugal pump as an example, the basic concepts of torque, 
power, head, fl ow rate, and effi ciency were developed for a turbomachine. Nondimen-
sionalization leads to the pump similarity rules and some typical dimensionless per-
formance curves for axial and centrifugal machines. The single most useful pump 
parameter is the specifi c speed, which delineates the type of design needed. An inter-
esting design application is the theory of pumps combined in series and in parallel.
 
Turbines extract energy from fl owing fl uids and are of two types: impulse turbines, 
which convert the momentum of a high-speed stream, and reaction turbines, where 
the pressure drop occurs within the blade passages in an internal fl ow. By analogy 
with pumps, the power specifi c speed is important for turbines and is used to classify 
them into impulse, Francis, and propeller-type designs. A special case of reaction 
turbine with unconfi ned fl ow is the wind turbine. Several types of windmills were 
discussed and their relative performances compared.

in Fig. P11.15, fl ow enters normal to the paper in the center

arms rotate at angular velocity ω and do work on a shaft. 
Draw the velocity diagram for this turbine. Neglecting fric-
tion, fi nd an expression for the power delivered to the shaft.

P11.39 The Allis-Chalmers D30LR centrifugal compressor delivers 
33,000 ft3/min of SO2 with a pressure change from 14.0 to

P11.40 The specifi c speed Ns, as defi ned by Eqs. (11.30), does not 
 contain the impeller diameter. How then should we size the 
pump for a given Ns? An alternate parameter is the specifi c 
diameter, Ds, which is a dimensionless combination of Q, gH, 
and D. (a) If Ds is proportional to D, determine its form.

Net positive-suction head
P11.42 An 8-in model pump delivering 1808F water at 800 gal/min 
and 2400 r/min begins to cavitate when the inlet pressure 
and velocity are 12 lbf/in2 absolute and 20 ft/s, respec-
tively. Find the required NPSH of a prototype that is 
4 times larger and runs at 1000 r/min.

used to pump water at 208C through a piping system at 
14,000 gal/min. (a) Determine the required brake horse-
power. The average friction factor is 0.018. (b) If there is 
65 ft of 12-in-diameter pipe upstream of the pump, how far 
below the surface should the pump inlet be placed to avoid 
cavitation?

796 Chapter 11 Turbomachinery
P11.44 The pump of Prob. P11.28 is scaled up to an 18-in  diameter, 
operating in water at best effi ciency at 1760 r/min. The 
measured NPSH is 16 ft, and the friction loss between the 
inlet and the pump is 22 ft. Will it be suffi cient to avoid 
cavitation if the pump inlet is placed 9 ft below the surface 
of a sea-level reservoir?
Specifi c speed: mixed- and axial-fl ow pumps
P11.45 Determine the specifi c speeds of the seven Taco, Inc., 
pump impellers in Fig. P11.24. Are they appropriate for 
centrifugal designs? Are they approximately equal within 
experimental uncertainty? If not, why not?
P11.46 The answer to Prob. P11.40 is that the dimensionless 
“ specifi c diameter” takes the form Ds 5 D(gH*)1/4/Q*1/2, 
evaluated at the BEP. Data collected by the author for 
30 different pumps indicate, in Fig. P11.46, that Ds corre-
lates well with specifi c speed Ns. Use this fi gure to estimate 
the appropriate impeller diameter for a pump that delivers 
20,000 gal/min of water and a head of 400 ft when running 
at 1200 r/min. Suggest a curve-fi tted formula to the data. 
Hint: Use a hyperbolic formula.

(a) What type of turbine is this likely to be? (b) What is so 
different about these data compared to the dimensionless 
performance plot in Fig. 11.22d? Suppose it is desired to 
use a geometrically similar turbine to serve where the 
available head and fl ow are 150 ft and 6.7 ft3/s,  respectively.

lute fl ow enters at 258 with the blade angles as shown. The

modifying the stator–rotor diagrams of Fig. 11.12 for  energy 
absorption. Sketch a suitable blade and fl ow  arrangement 
and the associated velocity vector diagrams.
P11.92 A dam on a river is being sited for a hydraulic turbine. The 
fl ow rate is 1500 m3/h, the available head is 24 m, and 
the turbine speed is to be 480 r/min. Discuss the estimated 
turbine size and feasibility for (a) a Francis turbine and 
(b) a Pelton wheel.
P11.93 Figure P11.93 shows a cutaway of a cross-fl ow or “Banki” 
turbine [55], which resembles a squirrel cage with slotted 
curved blades. The fl ow enters at about 2 o’clock and 
passes through the center and then again through the 
blades, leaving at about 8 o’clock. Report to the class on 
the operation and advantages of this design, including 
 idealized velocity vector diagrams.
P11.94 A simple cross-fl ow turbine, Fig. P11.93, was constructed 
and tested at the University of Rhode Island. The blades 
were made of PVC pipe cut lengthwise into three 1208-arc 
pieces. When it was tested in water at a head of 5.3 ft and a 
fl ow rate of 630 gal/min, the measured power output was 
0.6 hp. Estimate (a) the effi ciency and (b) the power

P11.98 Francis and Kaplan turbines are often provided with draft 
tubes, which lead the exit fl ow into the tailwater region, as 
in Fig. P11.98. Explain at least two advantages in using a

P11.99 Turbines can also cavitate when the pressure at point 1 in 
Fig. P11.98 drops too low. With NPSH defi ned by 
Eq. (11.20), the empirical criterion given by Wislicenus [4] 
for cavitation is
 
Nss 5 (r/min)(gal/min)1/2

Use this criterion to compute how high z1 2 z2, the impeller 
eye in Fig. P11.98, can be placed for a Francis turbine with 
a head of 300 ft, Nsp 5 40, and pa 5 14 lbf/in2 absolute 
before cavitation occurs in 608F water.
Wind turbines
P11.100 The manufacturer of the wind turbine in the chapter-
opener photo claims that it develops exactly 100 kW at a 
wind speed of 15 m/s. Compare this with an estimate from 
the correlations in Fig. 11.32.
P11.101 A Darrieus VAWT in operation in Lumsden,  Saskatchewan, 
that is 32 ft high and 20 ft in diameter sweeps out an area 
of 432 ft2. Estimate (a) the maximum power and (b) the 
rotor speed if it is operating in 16 mi/h winds.
P11.102 An American 6-ft-diameter multiblade HAWT is used to 
pump water to a height of 10 ft through 3-in-diameter cast 
iron pipe. If the winds are 12 mi/h, estimate the rate of 
water fl ow in gal/min.
P11.103 Only a mile from the wind turbine in the chapter-opener 
photo is a 100-ft-high, 23-ft-diameter HAWT, in Fig. 
P11.103. It is rated at 10 kW and provides one-half of the 
electricity for the Salty Brine State Beach bathhouse. 
From the data in Fig. 11.32, at a wind velocity of 20 mi/h, 
estimate (a) the maximum power developed, and (b) the 
rotation speed, in r/min.
P11.103 [Rhode Island Department of Environmental 
Management]
P11.104 The controversial Cape Cod Wind Project proposes 130 
large wind turbines in Nantucket Sound, intended to pro-
vide 75 percent of the electric power needs of Cape Cod 
and the Islands. The turbine diameter is 328 ft. For an 
average wind velocity of 14 mi/h, what are the best rota-
tion rate and total power output estimates for (a) a HAWT 
and (b) a VAWT?

Problems 803
P11.105 In 2007, a wind-powered-vehicle contest, held in North 
Holland [64], was won with a design by students at the 
University of Stuttgart. A schematic of the winning three-
wheeler is shown in Fig. P11.105. It is powered by a 
shrouded wind turbine, not a propeller, and, unlike a sail-
boat, can move directly into the wind. (a) How does it 
work? (b) What if the wind is off to the side? (c) Cite 
some design questions you might have.
P11.106 Analyze the wind-powered-vehicle of Fig. P11.105 with 
the following data: turbine diameter D 5 6 ft, power coef-
fi cient (Fig. 11.32) 5 0.3, vehicle CDA 5 4.5 ft2, and tur-
bine rotation 240 r/min. The vehicle moves directly into a 
head wind, W 5 25 mi/h. The wind backward thrust on 
the turbine is approximately T < CT(ρ/2)Vrel
2Aturbine, 
where Vrel is the air velocity relative to the turbine, and 
CT < 0.7. Eighty percent of the turbine power is deliv-
ered by gears to the wheels, to propel the vehicle.  Estimate 
the sea-level vehicle velocity V, in mi/h.
P11.107 Figure 11.32 showed the typical power performance of a 
wind turbine. The wind also causes a thrust force that 
must be resisted by the structure. The thrust coeffi cient CT 
of a wind turbine may be defi ned as follows:
 
CT 5 Thrust force
(ρ/2) AV2 5
T
(ρ/2) 3(π/4)D24 V2
Values of CT for a typical horizontal-axis wind turbine are 
shown in Fig. P11.107. The abscissa is the same as in 
Fig. 11.32. Consider the turbine of Prob. P11.103. If the 
wind is 20 mi/h and the rotation rate 115 r/min, estimate 
the bending moment about the tower base.

build a number of Darrieus turbines of height 4 m and 
diameter 3 m. (a) How many of these would we need to 
match the HAWT’s 100 kW output for 15 m/s wind speed

C11.2 Reconsider Prob. P6.62 as an exercise in pump selection. 
Select an impeller size and rotational speed from the Byron 
Jackson pump family of Prob. P11.28 to deliver a fl ow rate 
of 3 ft3/s to the system of Fig. P6.62 at minimum input 
power. Calculate the horsepower required.
C11.3 Reconsider Prob. P6.77 as an exercise in turbine selection. 
Select an impeller size and rotational speed from the Fran-
cis turbine family of Fig. 11.22d to deliver  maximum 
power generated by the turbine. Calculate the turbine 
power output and remark on the practicality of your design.
C11.4 The system of Fig. C11.4 is designed to deliver water at 
208C from a sea-level reservoir to another through new cast 
iron pipe of diameter 38 cm. Minor losses are SK1 5 0.5 
before the pump entrance and SK2 5 7.2 after the pump 
exit. (a) Select a pump from either Fig. 11.7a or 11.7b, run-
ning at the given speeds, that can perform this task at max-
imum effi ciency. Determine (b) the  resulting fl ow rate, 
(c)  the brake horsepower, and (d )  whether the pump as 
presently situated is safe from cavitation.
C11.5 For the 41.5-in water pump of Fig. 11.7b, at 710 r/min 
and 22,000 gal/min, estimate the effi ciency by (a) reading 
it directly from Fig. 11.7b; and (b) reading H and bhp and 
then calculating effi ciency from Eq. (11.5). Compare 
your results.
C11.6 An interesting turbomachine [58] is the fl uid coupling of 
Fig. C11.6, which circulates fl uid from a primary pump 
 rotor and thus turns a secondary turbine on a separate shaft. 
Both rotors have radial blades. Couplings are common in 
Word Problems
 W11.1 We know that an enclosed rotating bladed impeller will 
impart energy to a fl uid, usually in the form of a pressure 
rise, but how does it actually happen? Discuss, with 
sketches, the physical mechanisms through which an 
 impeller actually transfers energy to a fl uid.
 W11.2 Dynamic pumps (as opposed to PDPs) have diffi culty mov-
ing highly viscous fl uids. Lobanoff and Ross [15]  suggest 
the following rule of thumb: D (in) . 0.015ν/νwater,where 
D is the diameter of the discharge pipe. For example, SAE 
30W oil (< 300νwater) should require at least a 4.5-in outlet. 
Can you explain some reasons for this limitation?
 W11.3 The concept of NPSH dictates that liquid dynamic pumps 
should generally be immersed below the surface. Can you 
explain this? What is the effect of increasing the liquid 
temperature?
 W11.4 For nondimensional fan performance, Wallis [20] 
 suggests that the head coeffi cient should be replaced by 
FTP/(ρn2D2), where FTP is the fan total pressure change. 
 Explain the usefulness of this modifi cation.
 W11.5 Performance data for centrifugal pumps, even if well scaled 
geometrically, show a decrease in effi ciency with decreasing 
impeller size. Discuss some physical reasons why this is so.
 W11.6 Consider a dimensionless pump performance chart such as 
Fig. 11.8. What additional dimensionless parameters might 
modify or even destroy the similarity indicated in such data?
 W11.7 One parameter not discussed in this text is the number of 
blades on an impeller. Do some reading on this subject, and 
report to the class about its effect on pump performance.
 W11.8 Explain why some pump performance curves may lead to 
unstable operating conditions.
 W11.9 Why are Francis and Kaplan turbines generally consid-
ered unsuitable for hydropower sites where the available 
head exceeds 1000 ft?
 W11.10 Do some reading on the performance of the free  propeller 
that is used on small, low-speed aircraft. What dimension-
less parameters are typically reported for the data? How 
do the performance and effi ciency compare with those for 
the axial-fl ow pump?

all types of vehicle and machine transmissions and drives. 
The slip of the coupling is defi ned as the dimensionless dif-
ference between shaft rotation rates, s 5 1 2 ωs/ωp. For a 
given volume of fl uid, the torque T transmitted is a function 
of s, ρ, ωp, and impeller diameter D. (a) Nondimensional-
ize this function into two pi groups, with one pi propor-
tional to T. Tests on a 1-ft-diameter coupling at 2500 r/min,

it transmit a torque of 900 ft-lbf? (c) What is the proper diam-
eter for a geometrically similar coupling to run at 3000 r/min 
and 5 percent slip and transmit 600 ft-lbf of torque?
 C11.7 Report to the class on the Cordier method [63] for optimal 
design of turbomachinery. The method is related to, 
and  greatly expanded from, Prob. P11.46 and uses both 
 software and charts to develop an effi cient design for any 
given pump or compressor application.
 C11.8 A pump-turbine is a reversible device that uses a reservoir 
to generate power in the daytime and then pumps water 
back up to the reservoir at night. Let us reset Prob. P6.62 as 
a pump-turbine. Recall that Dz 5 120 ft, and the water 
fl ows through 2000 ft of 6-in-diameter cast iron pipe. For 
simplicity, assume that the pump operates at BEP (92%) 
with H*p 5 200 ft and the turbine operates at BEP (89%) 
with H*t 5 100 ft. Neglect minor losses. Estimate (a) the 
input power, in watts, required by the pump; and (b) the 
power, in watts, generated by the turbine. For further tech-

D11.1 To save on electricity costs, a town water supply system 
uses gravity-driven fl ow from fi ve large storage tanks dur-
ing the day and then refi lls these tanks from 10 p.m. to 
6 a.m. at a cheaper night rate of 7 ¢/kWh. The total resup-
ply needed each night varies from 5 E5 to 2 E6 gal, with no 
more than 5 E5 gallons to any one tank. Tank elevations 
vary from 40 to 100 ft. A single constant-speed pump, 
drawing from a large groundwater aquifer and valved into 
fi ve different cast iron tank supply lines, does this job. 
 Distances from the pump to the fi ve tanks vary more or less 
evenly from 1 to 3 mi. Each line averages one elbow every 
100 ft and has four butterfl y valves that can be controlled at 
any desirable angle. Select a suitable pump family from 
one of the six data sets in this chapter: Figs. 11.8, P11.24, 
and P11.34 plus Probs. P11.28, P11.35, and P11.38. 
 Assume ideal similarity (no Reynolds number or pump 
roughness effects). The goal is to determine pump and 
pipeline sizes that achieve minimum total cost over a 
5-year period. Some suggested cost data are
(a) Pump and motor: $2500 plus $1500 per inch of pipe 
size
(b) Valves: $100 plus $100 per inch of pipe size
(c) Pipelines: 50¢ per inch of diameter per foot of length
Since the fl ow and elevation parameters vary considerably, 
a random daily variation within the specifi ed ranges might 
give a realistic approach.

Uncertainty is a fact of life in engineering. We rarely know any engineering properties 
or variables to an extreme degree of accuracy. The uncertainty of data is normally defi ned 
as the band within which one is 95 percent confi dent that the true value lies. Recall from 
Fig. l.7 that the uncertainty of the ratio μ/μc was estimated as 620 percent. There are 
whole monographs devoted to the subject of experimental uncertainty, so we give 
only a brief summary here.
 
All experimental data have uncertainty, separated into two causes: (1) a systematic error 
due to the instrument or its environment and (2) a random error due to scatter in repeated 
readings. We minimize the systematic error by careful calibration and then estimate the 
random error statistically. The judgment of the experimenter is of crucial importance.
 
Here is the accepted mathematical estimate. Suppose a desired result P depends 
upon a single experimental variable x. If x has an uncertainty δx, then the uncertainty 
δP is estimated from the calculus:
δP < 0P
0xδx
If there are multiple variables, P 5 P(x1, x2, x3, … xN), the overall uncertainty δP is 
calculated as a root-mean-square estimate [4]:
 
δP 5 c a 0P

1 a 0P
0x2
δx2b
2
1 p 1 a 0P
0xN
δxNb

d

(E.1)
This calculation is statistically much more probable than simply adding linearly the 
various uncertainties δxi, thereby making the unlikely assumption that all variables 
simultaneously attain maximum error. Note that it is the responsibility of the experi-
menter to establish and report accurate estimates of all the relevant uncertainties δxi.
 
If the quantity P is a simple power-law expression of the other variables, for 
example, P 5 Const xn1
1 xn2
2 xn3
3 p, then each derivative in Eq. (E.1) is proportional to P 
and the relevant power-law exponent and is inversely proportional to that variable.

EXAMPLE
The so-called dimensionless Moody pipe friction factor f, plotted in Fig. 6.13, is calculated 
in experiments from the following formula involving pipe diameter D, pressure drop Dp, 
density ρ, volume fl ow rate Q, and pipe length L:
f 5 π2

Measurement uncertainties are given for a certain experiment: D 5 0.5 percent, Dp 5 
2.0  percent, ρ 5 1.0 percent. Q 5 3.5 percent, and L 5 0.4 percent. Estimate the overall un-
certainty of the friction factor f.

The coeffi cient π2/8 is assumed to be a pure theoretical number, with no uncertainty. The 
other variables may be collected using Eqs. (E.1) and (E.2):

By far the dominant effect in this particular calculation is the 3.5 percent error in Q, which is 
amplifi ed by doubling, due to the power of 2 on fl ow rate. The diameter uncertainty, which 
is quintupled, would have contributed more had δD been larger than 0.5 percent.
