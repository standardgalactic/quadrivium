Your Enterprise at Risk
Intellectual property is your enterprise’s lifeblood; is it safe or are you in danger of 
being put out of business because a predator has shed that lifeblood? We have found 
two profound but common misconceptions about intellectual property theft and 
economic espionage.
One of the great misconceptions is that the threat of economic espionage or trade 
secret theft is a limited concern—that it is an issue only if you are holding on to some-
thing like the formula for Coca-Cola or the design of the next Intel microprocessor. 
The many real-world stories included in this book illustrate the fallacy of thinking 
that this threat is someone else’s problem.
The other great misconception, held by many business leaders who do acknowledge 
the danger to their trade secrets and other intellectual property, is that the nature of this 
threat is sufﬁ ciently understood and adequately addressed. Often, on closer inspection, the 
information-protection programs these business leaders rely on are mired in Industrial 
Age thinking; they have not been adapted to the dynamic and dangerous new 
environment forged by globalization and the rise of the Information Age.
Consider the following all-too-true scenario.
You are the chief executive of a successful manufacturer. You have patents and 
trademarks appropriately registered around the globe. You are informed that there is 
a product strikingly similar to your own yet-to-be-released product, already on the

shelves in the capital city of a far-off land, and you are asking yourself, Who could 
do this? How big is the hit going to be to the corporate brand? What other intellectual 
properties have left the enterprise?
A cursory examination of the product shows it is so close to your own, yet-to-be-
released product, it is practically a clone. A more comprehensive inspection shows that 
there has been a clear infringement upon your patent and trade secrets.
Your soon-to-be-introduced product is now out in the wild of the marketplace, 
being sold under another company’s name.
You realize that what you are looking at is a wholesale acquisition and monetization 
of your intellectual property. Even though the manufacturer of these items will be the 
subject of your legal department’s attention, you need to determine how this happened, 
what the impact will be, and how you can prevent it from happening again (assuming 
your enterprise survives this attack). So you initiate your own damage assessment and 
internal fact-ﬁ nding investigation.
Your ﬁ rst stop in your damage assessment is with your legal team; they are able 
to demonstrate to your satisfaction that they had dutifully registered your patents 
and trademarks, not only in your own country, but globally. They also are engaging 
in the appropriate legal actions to have these product items taken out of the global 
marketplace and are seeking a court order to halt further manufacturing of them.
You continue your internal investigation and note no rhyme or reason in the manner 
in which information is processed throughout your research and development team. 
When you inquire you receive blank stares of incredulity that you would even question 
the research and development team; after all, they simply use what the information 
technology department gives them.
The information technology department head is pleased to listen to your inquiries 
and answers them with an appreciation for your desire to track the loss of the company’s 
intellectual property. He duly notes the lack of policies and capabilities within the 
information technology infrastructure. No audit trails exist. He leaves you with the 
realization that information technologically implementation, viewed as a cost center vs. 
business enhancement, was really costing the enterprise in a manner in which you 
never thought possible.
You continue your walk-about investigation and review your talent acquisition 
process.

You knew that your team had evolved from the start-up days, and that you no 
longer were able to meet all new hires prior to their arrival, in order to get your 
own measure of the individual. You discover the company has grown so rapidly, 
that in your current situation, your new hires are acquired via a third-party agency, 
and neither you nor your managers have any perspective or appreciation on what 
“the background checks out” really means, or for that matter should mean, and 
whether it means the same thing in the United States as it does in China, Singapore, 
or Finland.
A visit to the manufacturing division further illustrates the natural evolution of a 
fast-growing enterprise, and the movement from in-house to a hybrid of in-house and 
contracted manufacturers. When you inquire into the nuances of the various entities 
with respect to protection of designs, methodologies, and techniques, you are greeted 
with a blank stare, and instead of answers, you are hosted to a lively presentation on 
how the manufacturing division can really get those products assembled even more 
rapidly, and how the capacity of each of the lines is increasing monthly.
Your look into the sales and marketing team’s preservation of your corporate 
differentiators is fruitless, because they simply move forward, but never look back. 
They are goal-oriented—bring the sales in, ﬁ ll the order book, go-go-go—but you 
have no idea as to the amount of detrude they leave behind as they traverse the 
marketplace.
All in all, you simply don’t know where to start to determine where the hemorrhage 
of your intellectual property occurred that allowed your product to be duplicated.
Your off-the-cuff, with-your-own-eyes damage assessment was a good start. But 
there is much to be done. First, it is important to get the big picture.
In the twenty-ﬁ rst century, everything is interdependent, connected, interpenetrating 
(see Figures 1 and 2). The global economy is breaking down trade barriers and bringing 
others in competition with you even though they are halfway around the world. 
Furthermore, cyberspace has evolved and expanded in the same time frame of this 
relentless globalization, and has provided unprecedented access not just to information 
about your enterprise, but literally to the information of your enterprise itself, including 
and especially that information that is conﬁ dential, secret, or otherwise sensitive.

and whatever threatens your enterprise threatens the national economy.
Today, the U.S. economy, as just one example, faces many threats, including spiraling 
energy costs, corporate governance abuses, huge federal deﬁ cits, foreign ownership of 
the national debt, the loss of jobs to offshore outsourcing, and the impact of disasters

in the closing of borders, the interruption of business, the cessation of travel, and the 
deaths of many thousands.
But as you can see from this overview, there is another threat, difﬁ cult to quantify 
or even detect, one that has not yet grabbed the headlines or captured the imagination, 
and yet is relentlessly and efﬁ ciently looting, pillaging, and plundering the U.S. and 
global economies of the magic ingredient—trade secrets.
Economic espionage and intellectual property theft are as real a threat as terrorism 
or global warming. But they are subtle, insidious, and stealthy. Even if the United States 
ﬁ nds the will to come to grips with the many threats it faces, this silent, invisible 
hemorrhaging of intellectual know-how and trade secrets could deliver the death 
blow to the U.S.’s preeminent place in the global economic world before we even 
wake up to the magnitude of the danger.
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, intellectual property theft is estimated 
to top $250 billion annually (equivalent to the impact of another four hurricane 
Katrinas), and also costs the United States approximately 750,000 jobs. The International 
Chamber of Commerce puts the global ﬁ scal loss at more than $600 billion a year. 
But both ﬁ gures appear to be woefully underestimated; by some other estimates, there 
was over $251 billion worth of intellectual property lost or illegal property seized in 
August 2005 alone (http://www.goldsec.com/PR/05-10-05-2.htm).
In September 2006, the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Council 
reported to the U.S. President and Congress on the importance of intellectual property 
to the national interests. The report said, “Protecting intellectual property is vital to 
advances in science and industry and to creation of content enjoyed throughout the 
world and the failure to protect intellectual property has potentially serious health 
and safety consequences.”
The U.S. government’s focus on the threat to the intellectual property of U.S. industry 
has resulted in the funding of a myriad of studies on the insider phenomenon in the 
government’s own efforts to raise the level of protection to U.S. government classiﬁ ed 
information.
Thus, while the U.S. government calls out the need to protect their data, it truly is 
the responsibility of every company to take appropriate steps to protect their company’s 
assets. This must include the appropriate protection of intellectual property, be it 
patents, copyrights, trademarks, marketing plans, business-to-business methodologies, 
or others.
The United States, like other great nations, stands on three legs: military power, 
political power, and economic power. Arguably, economic power is the most vital of 

xviii Introduction
www.syngress.com
the three. Without economic power, the political elite would be bereft of the consultants 
and lawyers who insulate it; it would have nothing to bargain with at the geopolitical 
roulette table, and it would lack the bureaucratic muscle to impose its will domestically. 
Without economic power, the military would be unable to deploy advanced weapons 
systems, spy on its enemies from space, span the globe with bases, or even raise an army.
Secrets are the magic ingredient of power. When state secrets (i.e., political and 
military secrets) are stolen, governments fall and wars are lost, people are disgraced 
and people die. When trade secrets (i.e., scientiﬁ c or engineering secrets) are stolen, 
corporations lose their competitive edge, small entities cease to exist, and whole sectors 
of the economy weaken and fall behind in the global marketplace; people lose their 
livelihood and their children’s futures.
In other words, the United States could win the war on terrorism, overcome 
the  hallenges of global warming, balance the federal budget, strengthen the United 
Nations, end global armed conﬂ ict, and restore our edge in science and engineering, 
and still end up behind China, India, Japan, Russia, or Brazil in several vital sectors of 
the economy, and at a serious, if not fatal, disadvantage within the global marketplace.
The threats of economic espionage, intellectual property theft, counterfeiting, and 
piracy are global, dangerous, and increasingly common.
It is within your power to decide for yourself if your enterprise is going to be a 
hard target or a soft target. The time for action is now. You can be prepared.
Secrets Stolen, Fortunes Lost: How to Prevent Intellectual Property Theft and Economic 
Espionage in the 21st Century is the guidebook.
It is organized and written in such a way that it can be both accessible and of 
practical use to a broad range of readers. In particular, these readers include not only 
executives who want to grow the enterprise, not preside over its pillaging, and the 
security and intelligence professionals empowered to protect the enterprise, but also 
lawyers seeking precedent and notions of due care, consultants who want to deepen their 
knowledge in this area of expertise, journalists searching for context and background, 
and government ofﬁ cials preparing brieﬁ ng materials and developing public policy.
How to Read This Book
The book is organized into two main sections: Part 1: The Challenge and Part 2: The 
Strategy, and includes a collection of useful appendices.
Part 1: The Challenge provides an extensive analysis of numerous instances of 
intellectual property theft and economic espionage, and a comprehensive overview 

 
Introduction 
xix
www.syngress.com
of the diverse vectors of attack. It includes examples of how insiders, competitors, 
state-sponsored agents, and organized crime entities target the intellectual property 
and trade secrets of enterprises throughout the world.
These real-world stories are based on open-source (i.e., not classiﬁ ed) intelligence. 
There is a compelling lesson in this fact. A decade ago, such stories rarely made it 
onto the news wire or into the courts. Today, they are commonplace. Unfortunately, 
the awareness and defenses required to thwart such damaging activities, although 
economical and effective, are far from commonplace. Our hope is to change that.
This section also includes an in-depth roundtable of subject matter experts who 
offer their answers to some of the toughest questions related to this risk and how to 
mitigate it.
Part 2: The Strategy introduces the concept of Holistic Security; in other words, a 
security program, in which all the elements (e.g., personnel security, physical security, 
and information security) are integrated (i.e., responsive to and reﬂ ective of each 
other), and which also beneﬁ t from a serious commitment to both awareness and 
education, to engage the work force, and intelligence, to enlighten decision-making.
To help you develop your own winning program, we have included three case 
studies related to the vital issue of awareness and education, and several information 
protection program assessment tools on different aspects of security (e.g., personnel, 
physical, and information security), which articulate questions to aid in the evaluation 
of your enterprise’s current IP protection posture and give you clear guidance on 
how to strengthen it. We also have provided a presentation for selling IP protection 
upward, complete with a pitch, presenter’s notes, and the background thinking you 
need to make a compelling and successful appeal for executive commitment.
As a further resource, a collection of appendices at the back of the book includes 
relevant information on leveraging your tax dollars, baseline controls mapped to ISO, 
notes on forensics, and a selection of relevant laws and treaties.
Upon the ﬁ rst read, Secrets Stolen, Fortunes Lost is intended to bring you not only 
up to speed, but ahead of the curve, on the full spectrum of problems and solutions 
related to intellectual property theft and economic espionage.
As an ongoing reference, Secrets Stolen, Fortunes Lost is intended to serve as an 
invaluable reservoir of ideas and energy to draw on as you move forward. When you 
need to develop a body of policies on new hire background checks, it will be there 
for you. When you need to document baseline information security controls, it will 
be there for you. When you need to tell some real-world stories to make your case to 
your colleagues, it will be there for you. When you need to identify the key elements

of a powerful awareness and education program, it will be there for you. When you 
need to make the business case for the Board of Directors, it will be there for you. 
When you need to answer the hard questions like, “How did this happen? What do 
we have to do to prevent this from happening again? Are we safe? What do we have 
to do? Where do we begin?”, this book will be there for you.
Portions of this book ﬁ rst appeared, in a condensed form, as a series of articles in

Part 1 • The Challenge
The challenge to you, as an executive charged with protecting your enterprise’s 
information, is to confront a shape-shifting, stealthy menace that can (and probably 
will) come at you from multiple vectors, perhaps even simultaneously.
The truth is that there are no shortages of individuals (some skillful, others 
bumbling) and groups (some well-heeled, others ﬂ y-by-night) willing to go through 
a myriad of machinations and outwait you for many moons in order to acquire a 
competitive advantage at your expense and on your back.
To provide you with the full spectrum of threats, in vivid color and stark relief, in 
Part 1 of this book, we present you with ﬁ ve compelling pieces:
The ﬁ rst chapter, titled “The Tale of the Targeted Trojan,” is an analysis of a 
startlingly example of how a successful twenty-ﬁ rst century effort in the illicit acquisition 
of intellectual property departs from some of the “conventional wisdom” (i.e., convenient 
clichés) of twentieth-century industrial espionage (e.g., “industrial espionage is done 
almost exclusively by the turning of insiders, and not by hacking,” and “your industry 
competitors will not hack into your systems; it’s too risky”).
The next three chapters offer an exploration of the various points of origin from 
which attacks originate and real-world cases of how, why, and by whom economic 
and corporate lifeblood—that is, intellectual property—is spilt:
■ When Insiders and/or Competitors Target Businesses’ Intellectual Property
■ When State Entities Target Businesses’ Intellectual Property
■ When Piracy, Counterfeiting and Organized Crime Target Businesses’ 
Intellectual Property
“Part 1: The Challenge” concludes with a roundtable discussion held with a 
number of well-recognized security professionals. These subject matter experts share 
their perspectives on where we are now and where we are going. This discussion 
underscores the complexity of the mission at hand, as well as the variety of avenues 
available in achieving the common goal of protecting intellectual property.

Chapter 1 • The Tale of the Targeted Trojan
Introduction
The Greeks delivered a gift of a wooden horse to the people of Troy. The citizens of Troy 
accepted the gift, the city fell shortly thereafter, and the term “Trojan Horse” entered the 
popular lexicon.
The maturation of the information age has brought to us a plethora of network-based 
systems, a multitude of connectivity and information sharing methodologies, and a level 
of interconnectivity at the enterprise and individual level never experienced before. It is 
also likely to continue increasing in both scope and complexity (see Figure 1.1).
Source: Symantec Internet Security Threat Report, 2007
Without security programs installed and security features turned on, these systems 
and methodologies are clearly vulnerable. But the sad reality is that even when protected 
by such security programs, with their various security features activated, these systems 
continue to be vulnerable to carefully crafted low-proﬁ le attack software that will be 
undetectable by a multitude of defensive products, in part because the majority of these 
products are designed as signature-based rather than event-based.

Proliferating Rapidly. They Are Not Used Just for Phishing

For such products to be effective in maintaining the security of your system, three 
events must occur:
■ The signature of the attack proﬁ le must match a known signature proﬁ le.
■ The attack proﬁ le must have been seen before by the software manufacturer.
■ The user must update the software to bring the signature of the attack 
proﬁ le to their system.
The Haephrati Case
This tale of the targeted Trojan—a.k.a., the Haephrati case—was active from 2003 to 
2005 and came to the public light in January 2006.
At that time, we saw the extradition of Michael Haephrati along with his wife 
Ruth Brier-Haephrati from the UK to Israel, an event that under normal circumstances 
would not have garnered much attention had they not created, distributed, and utilized 
some of the most interesting and successful pieces of software speciﬁ cally designed to 
steal the intellectual property of the target. Upon arrival in Israel, the couple pled guilty 
to the charges brought against them and were convicted. This case has turned out to be 
one of the most expansive and interesting cases of industrial espionage in many years.
In late-May 2005, the two Haephratis were arrested by British authorities in 
London, at the request of Israeli authorities, for having conducted he “unauthorized 
modiﬁ cation of the contents of a computer.” Put more simply, they were charged 
with having created and placed a “Trojan” ﬁ le on a computer, not their own, and 
having siphoned the contents from the computer. But this puts it too simply. What 
they really did was create their own cottage industry. They provided an “outsourced” 
technical capability that provided to the “business subscriber,” a monthly compendium 
of illicitly obtained correspondence, documents, economic data, and intellectual 
property from the computer systems of ﬁ rms targeted by the Haephratis’ subscribers.
In essence, provisions of a sophisticated and highly effective outsourced 
industrial/economic espionage capability were made available to both individuals 
and enterprises. The Chief Superintendent of the Israel Police National Fraud 
Unit, Arie Edleman, describing the tool created by Michael Haephrati said, “It not 
only penetrated the computer and sent material to wherever you wanted, but it 
also enabled you to completely control it, to change or erase files, for example. 
It also enabled you to see what was being typed in real time.” He continued, 
“This is not common software that anti-virus software makers have had to ﬁ x.”

Chapter 1 • The Tale of the Targeted Trojan
The When
■ Initiated circa May 2003
■ Discovered circa November 2004
■ Neutralized circa May 2005
■ Arrested in the UK and then extradited to Israel January 2006
■ Convicted and sentenced March 2006
The How
The Hook
■ Delivered via targeted personal e-mail.
■ Received an e-mail from an address that looked like one of a known entity, 
such as the e-mail address gur_r@zahav.net.il, which was read as e-mail 
address gur-r@zahav.net.il.
■ The bogus account was identiﬁ ed as being opened by a person who lived in 
London and charged the fees to their American Express card.
■ Delivered via targeted commercial e-mail.
■ Targets received an e-mail message offering a business opportunity.
■ Those that responded to info@targetdata.biz would receive the Trojan.
■ The domain targetdata.biz was registered to Haephrati.
■ Delivered via targeted compact disc.
■ Target received a compact disc offering a business opportunity.
■ Those who responded to info@targetdata.biz would receive the Trojan.
The Mechanism
■ While the exact code that Haephrati created and customized for each victim 
has not been released to the public, a review of relevant security bulletins 
provides a good indication of how the code functioned.
■ The Trojan included a key-logger, a store-and-forward capability, and would 
send documents and pictures to FTP servers (ﬁ le storage servers) located in 
Israel, the U.S. and other locales. The investigation turned up dozens of 
servers located around the globe. The program allowed for Haephrati to 

www.syngress.com
 
The Tale of the Targeted Trojan • Chapter 1 
7
remotely control the computer of the unsuspecting victim. In essence, 
Haephrati was running a well-managed store-and-forward service. They were 
not relying on botnets or other illicitly acquired infrastructures. They had a 
business to support and leased their infrastructure. According to the Israeli 
police, items stolen included marketing plans, employee pay slips, business 
plans, and details on new products, all of which were passed to rivals. The 
data included over 11,000 pages of data, which consisted of thousands of 
pages of “conﬁ dential” data (more than 11 gigabytes of material).
The Who
Michael Haephrati is the computer programmer who created the original Trojan 
program, allegedly planted on his in-laws computer so as to provide him the means 
to harass his former in-laws. According to the press, Ruth Brier-Haephrati saw the 
business opportunity in selling the capability. In Israel, a number of private investigative 
ﬁ rms were identiﬁ ed as being positioned between the Haephratis, the clients, and the 
victims. Haephrati began creating one-off programs for targeted delivery, based on 
information acquired about the victim—in other words, they were provided the 
speciﬁ c information necessary to craft the tool that would undermine the security 
apparatus and/or techniques employed by the victim. According to the Israeli police, 
the capability was also sold to ﬁ rms outside Israel, none of which have, as of mid-2007, 
been publicly identiﬁ ed. Thus, it is expected that ﬁ rms outside Israel have also fallen 
victim to this type of methodology and speciﬁ c technology.
The Why
As noted earlier, the initial motive was revenge. Haephrati resented his former in-laws 
and set about to defame them by manipulating information obtained from their 
computer. The recipient of the Haephratis’ efforts had a simple motive: economic 
advantage over their competition.
The Cost
Haephrati charged each business customer the equivalent of US$3500 to create the 
customized program and make the initial install on the victim’s computer, and another 
US$900/month to maintain the infrastructure used to collect, forward, store, collate, and 
deliver the illicitly acquired information on a monthly basis. The cost to the recipients was 
the fee they paid to the intermediary who contracted Haephrati’s services. And what was 
the cost to the victims? Extreme. They lost their intellectual property, lost business

opportunity, and lost the privacy of their employees’ personal data. They also lost 
go-to-market plans, as well as customer requirements, and they potentially lost the 
trust of their customers. Table 1.1 lists various items traded on underground servers.
The Discovery
Haephrati, the criminal, was undone by Haephrati, the vengeful. Haephrati’s continued 
harassment of his former in-laws after having transitioned into the illegal provisioning 
to commercial companies of a criminal infrastructure was his undoing. His former 
father-in-law visited the law enforcement authorities in November 2004 complaining 
that his private work was showing up on the Internet in a manner designed to defame 
his person and character. The authorities suggested reformatting the hard drive, he did, 
and the problem persisted. The former father-in-law returned to the authorities, who 
looked deeper, using their forensic tools (not further identiﬁ ed) and noted a unique

piece of malware had been installed. The authorities walked the path back and 
discovered Haephrati’s cottage industry. When Haephrati sent his ex-wife an e-mail 
(see “The How:” section earlier), investigators and the ex-wife noticed the discrepancy 
in the e-mail address used and traced the bogus account to Haephrati. They discovered 
that Haephrati had paid for the account by using his American Express card, and the 
connection between the virtual criminal and the physical person behind the criminal 
activity was completed.
The Scope
The Superintendent of the Israeli Police, Peral Liat, told Computer Weekly, “We know 
Haephrati worked abroad. We assume that if he sold his Trojan horse to private 
investigators in Israel, he also offered it to companies abroad. That is why we have 
involved Interpol and the police in London, Germany, and the U.S.” According 
to publicly available information, which should increase as the case proceeds through 
the Israeli court system, 18 individuals and numerous ﬁ rms have been implicated. 
Those arrested in Israel were charged with uploading Trojan horses in targeted 
companies on behalf of their clients (the end-recipients). Most have been accused of 
“creating and distributing a computer virus, penetrating computer material, wiretapping, 
criminal conspiracy, aggravated fraud, and infringement of the Protection of Privacy 
Law (5741-1981 – Israeli penal code).”

Related U.S./UK Advisories
UK – National Infrastructure 
Security Coordination Centre (NISCC)
On June 16, 2005, NISCC issued an advisory alert (NISCC Brieﬁ ng 08/2005) that 
described in detail the capability created by Haephrati, without reference to 
Haephrati himself. The highpoints of the brief:
■ A series of Trojaned e-mail attacks are targeting UK governmental ofﬁ ces 
and companies.
■ The attackers’ aim appears to be the covert gathering and transmitting of 
commercially or economically valuable information.
■ Trojans are delivered either in e-mail attachments or through links to a 
Web site.
■ The e-mails employ social engineering, including use of a spoofed sender 
address and information relevant to the recipient’s job or interests to entice 
them into opening the documents.
■ Once installed on a user machine, Trojans may be used to obtain passwords, 
scan networks, export information, and launch further attacks.
■ Anti-virus software and firewalls do not give complete protection. 
Trojans can communicate with the attackers using common ports (for 
example, HTTP, DNS, SSL) and can be modified to avoid anti-virus 
detection.
On July 8, 2005 the NISCC issued a separate advisory (18/05 ID# 20050708-00561) 
with respect to the conﬁ rmed use of e-mail to deliver a Trojan attack.
■ “Uniras has evidence that the horriﬁ c events of July 7th being used in the 
social engineering element of e-mail-borne Trojan attacks. Typically, the subject 
line of an e-mail, its content, and possibly a malicious attachment all make 
reference to the incidents in London. At this time, everybody is interested in 
keeping abreast of developments and will naturally be tempted to open e-mails 
of this nature. We urge security ofﬁ cers to take the opportunity to remind 
their staff that only reputable news sources should be used for this purpose 
and that e-mails relating to news events should be opened only if they are 
from a known and trusted source and are expected.”

Chapter 1 • The Tale of the Targeted Trojan
U.S. – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
On 21 December 2005, the DHS in conjunction with the Department of State 
issued a Joint Information Bulletin (  JIB ID # 12212005) titled “Look Before You 
Click: Trojan Horses and Other Attempts to Compromise Networks.” The key 
ﬁ ndings of the bulletin were:
■ According to industry security experts, the biggest security vulnerability 
facing computer users and networks is e-mail with concealed Trojan horse 
software—destructive programs that masquerade as benign applications and 
embedded links to ostensibly innocent Web sites that download malicious 
code. While ﬁ rewall architecture blocks direct attacks, e-mail provides a 
vulnerable route into an organization’s internal network through which 
attackers can destroy or steal information.
■ Attackers try to circumvent technical blocks to the installation of malicious 
code by using social engineering—getting computer users to unwittingly 
take actions that allow the code to be installed and organization data to be 
compromised.
■ The techniques attackers use to install Trojan horse programs through e-mail 
are widely available, and include forging sender identiﬁ cation, using deceptive 
subject lines, and embedding malicious code in e-mail attachments.
■ Developments in thumb-sized portable storage devices and the emergence of 
sophisticated keystroke logging software and devices make it easy for attackers 
to discover and steal massive amounts of information surreptitiously.
■ Security experts believe the most important line of defense in computer 
security is the user. User training and awareness about social engineering 
attack techniques and safe Web browsing practices are integral to a sound 
computer security posture.
Haephrati’s malware was active for a multiyear period, not detectable at that time by 
the many anti-virus programs available. Subsequent to the advisories, the ﬁ ngerprint of 
the malware used by Haephrati was integrated into the anti-virus/anti-malware programs. 
The reality begs the question that we posited earlier: How many similar programs, written 
by more creative individuals with greater incentives not to be discovered, are currently 
attacking companies, and/or individuals’ computer infrastructures—and what is the time 
lag between implementation, discovery, and remediation?

Lessons learned?
One lesson is that your competitors—or mercenaries and freebooters looking for 
something to peddle to them—are willing to attack you in cyberspace rather than 
just rely on the industrial-age method of turning insiders.
Another important lesson is that Trojans are not just used for phishing. Indeed, 
the proliferation of such programs is an indication of what lies farther out in deep 
water—that is, malicious code that targets enterprises and/or individual executives.
Those using targeted Trojans are more like frogmen carrying spear guns and riding 
mini-submarines, rather than fraudsters with big nets casting for the gullible and the 
naive. It may sound like something out of Ian Fleming, but it is nevertheless a reality.
Furthermore, when you couple the demonstrated capabilities of targeted Trojans 
with the intent and resources available to the organized crime entities in Russia and 
other former Soviet states, chilling scenarios abound (see Figure 1.2). Such threats are 
real, and not rare, although they certainly are rarely admitted by victimized enterprises 
or written about in the press. Indeed, the most unusual aspect of the Haephrati case 
is that it made it into print.

Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
Introduction
By deﬁ nition, an insider can come in many forms, be it an employee, a member of 
the management team, a corporate board member, a vendor, a third-party contracted 
manufacturer, or a collaborative partner in a joint venture.
The newspapers are replete with countless examples of the damage an insider can 
do to a business.
The following is a selection of some particularly insightful cases, which serve to 
illustrate the various motivations of the offenders, as well as the damage done to the 
enterprises they undermined.
Lightwave Microsystems
Let us begin with the case of an employee at a privately held firm (Lightwave 
Microsystems), who occupied a trusted position within that company, that of 
Director of Information Technology, and who acted alone in his attempt to illegally 
share Lightwave’s intellectual property. The individual, Brent Woodward of Oakland, 
CA, chose to exercise his venial needs, as well as obtain some solace via revenge 
when faced with circumstances that he believed were unjust—two very powerful 
motivators in an individual contemplating a malevolent act.
In late 2002, the owner of Lightwave Microsystems, a California ﬁ rm, announced 
that the company would cease operations due to the ﬁ rm’s inability to make a proﬁ t, but 
Lightwave Microsystems was not without value—it owned patents and had evolved trade 
secrets that could be sold. (Lightwave was subsequently purchased by NeoPhotonics of 
San Jose, CA.) When faced with the prospect of unemployment and upside-down stock 
options, Woodward made copies of the company’s trade secrets from the ﬁ rm’s backup 
tapes and created a plan to sell these secrets to a competitor. He would feather his own 
nest monetarily and get revenge for the abruptness of his CEO’s actions.
No one at Lightwave Microsystems detected the unauthorized copy activity. Why 
would they? Woodward’s access was both natural and unencumbered. Furthermore, 
as Director of Information Technology, it was Woodward’s responsibility to protect 
this very data—to discover, neutralize, and mitigate any and all attempts to steal 
Lightwave Microsystems’ intellectual property.
Admittedly, Woodward’s methodology was very sophomoric, but worthy of sharing 
nonetheless. He created an alias name, “Joe Data,” and also set up a Web-based e-mail 
account, lightwavedata@yahoo.com, from which he executed his crime. Woodward 

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2 
17
contacted JDS-Uniphase’s (  JDS) chief technology ofﬁ cer and offered to provide 
Lightwave Microsystems’ data to JDS in return for a signiﬁ cant sum of money.
JDS did the absolute right thing: the ﬁ rm immediately contacted the U.S. Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and at their request, JDS consented to the monitoring 
of communications between JDS and “Joe Data,” which was to occur via e-mail. The 
FBI, with a consensual monitoring permit provided by JDS, was able to observe 
the controlled negotiations between JDS and “Joe Data,” as well as trace back these 
communications via the user’s Internet protocol address to the e-mail service 
provider, Yahoo. The trace activity showed “Joe Data” was connected to the Internet 
from within Woodward’s residence. This discovery enabled the FBI to execute a valid 
search warrant of the residence, which produced sufﬁ cient evidence to ultimately 
bring about Woodward’s arrest. Ultimately, he was charged with one count of theft of 
trade secrets under 18 U.S.C. § 1832.
In August 2005, the United States Attorney’s Ofﬁ ce for the Northern District of 
California announced that Brent Woodward had pled guilty to the aforementioned 
charge. Though he could have been sentenced to ten years imprisonment and ﬁ ned 
US$250,000, he received a $20,000 ﬁ ne and was sentenced to two years in prison, 
plus three years of supervised release.
Though Woodward found that his vengeful attempt to obtain an illegal bonus to be 
very expensive in the end—in both defense fees as well as penalties adjudicated—it 
is important to note that Woodward was acting by himself, and for himself, and thus 
had no interests other than his own venial needs. What would have happened had 
Woodward offered the purloined data to a less ethical competitor? Perhaps that 
competitor would have taken the data and set up the equivalent of a parallel universe. 
Would the value of Lightwave Microsystems’ intellectual property sold to NeoPhotonics 
have been jeopardized? What of NeoPhotonics, the purchaser of Lightwave Microsystems’ 
technology? If the unscrupulous competitor had taken the trade secrets and capitalized 
on the technological advances, what recourse would NeoPhotonics have had to 
recoup their investment/payment to Lightwave Microsystems? Litigation would only 
be an option IF Lightwave Microsystems knew the intellectual property had been stolen. 
And this would have come to light when? The purchaser wouldn’t have admitted 
to having purloined the intellectual property, and Woodward certainly wouldn’t have 
advertised his sale. Only during the unscrupulous competitor’s developmental, 
manufacturing, and/or marketing/sales processes would there have been the possibility 
that the technology acquisition might be revealed.

www.syngress.com

Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
The best course would have been to initially establish a defense against Woodward’s 
action. Lightwave Microsystems should have had in place multiple audit trails and 
either human or machine tracking of all users, including the super-user, so that a 
warning could have been sent that anomalous behavior had occurred.
America Online
Let’s now move on to another case in which greed was the motivating factor, inducing an 
employee to steal his employer’s private data. In April and May 2003, American Online 
(AOL) software engineer Jason Smathers, utilized a colleague’s access codes to surreptitiously 
log on to the AOL server. Then, posing as the colleague, he used his colleague’s access to 
acquire information from each of the then 30 million AOL customers. The data stolen by 
Smathers comprised 92 million records, which contained the personal identifying 
information of those 30 million customers. The data included e-mail addresses, screen names, 
ZIP codes, customer credit card types (not numbers), and telephone numbers associated 
with AOL customer accounts. Smathers sold the stolen AOL data to Sean Dunaway of 
Las Vegas. Dunaway paid Smathers US$27,000 for the addresses, and then utilized them to 
advertise his own online gambling Web site. Dunaway later resold the AOL data to online 
“spammers” for approximately US$52,000. Clearly, he was an early adopter of the concept 
of spamming.
The Department of Justice prosecuted this case under the (then new) federal law 
Can-Spam (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing 
Act). Smathers had pled guilty in February 2005 to the crime. In October 2005, he 
was sentenced to 15 months in prison and ﬁ ned US$84,000—triple what he had 
garnered through the sale of the data. Smathers clearly knew the data had value, but 
he grossly underestimated the value of the information. Though DOJ recommended 
to the presiding judge that Smathers be barred from the software profession, the judge 
noted Smathers’ cooperation in the investigation and believed that his cooperation 
and Smathers’ contrite behavior warranted leniency. Smathers noted to the court that 
AOL had said his theft and subsequent sale had cost the company at least US$400,000—
and potentially millions of U.S. dollars.
At ﬁ rst glance, it would seem only AOL and their 30 million subscribers were 
exposed to unwanted spam. So where’s the damage? The user can simply press the 
Delete key and get on with life. After all, spam is received by virtually every Internet 
user, and a variety of companies now specialize in ﬁ ltering spam so only “good” 
e-mail arrives in their inbox. However, the loss of revenue to AOL was the loss of 

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2 
19
time each user experienced while deleting those unwanted e-mails—and time has 
value. But why was a crime that was committed in 2003 not prosecuted until early 
2005? A very good question.
The delay in prosecution is largely due to the fact that until mid-2004, Smathers 
was still an employee of AOL and had not yet been identiﬁ ed as the source of the 
data breach. While AOL knew they had a problem and were cooperating with law 
enforcement, Smathers’ use of a colleague’s administrative logon was an effective 
method of bypassing the AOL corporate security apparatus. Smathers’ colleague did 
have authorized access to the data, whereas Smathers did not. Had the colleague 
perhaps protected his passwords better (there is no evidence to suggest the unidentiﬁ ed 
colleague colluded or provided Smathers with his login passwords), this crime might 
never have occurred.
But the real damage may still be looming. What of the collation of e-mail addresses, 
usernames, and user telephone numbers? What malicious use could this data be to 
e-mail phishers or unscrupulous telemarketers? The answer: Priceless. That was 2003. 
Fast forward to 2007 where some spammed e-mail has evolved into what is known 
euphemistically as phishing.
AOL is advertised as a “family-friendly” environment—one where the customer 
doesn’t have to be a technological marvel, nor think in bits or baud, to enjoy the 
pleasures of the Internet—and AOL works extraordinarily hard to exclude the seedier 
side of the Internet. As noted earlier, AOL admitted to having spent at least US$400,000 
as a result of this incident, but the downside may be much greater as they continue 
creating software to mitigate the loss of customer data, while simultaneously working to 
regain the trust of their customer base.
According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, in 2006 alone there were 
approximately 100,453,730 cases of personal identifying information revealed to 
those without a need to know. These revelations occurred in government entities, 
retailers, educational institutes, and consulting ﬁ rms (www.privacyrights.org/ar/
DataBreaches2006-Analysis.htm).
Casiano Communications
Let’s look at another instance of personal greed—this in a separate industry where a 
worker was accused of stealing the intellectual property of his employer and setting up 
shop as a direct competitor. In mid-October 2005, Casiano Communications, Inc. (CCI), 
arguably the most prominent publisher within the Caribbean basin with respect to 

www.syngress.com
20 
Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
Caribbean business and travel literature magazines, ﬁ led suit against a former employee, 
John Bynum. The suit alleged that Bynum stole intellectual property from CCI—speciﬁ cally, 
CCI’s databases, which Bynum then forwarded to his personal e-mail account from CCI’s 
computers. According to the CCI complaint, Bynum stole client and advertiser information, 
violating CCI’s Electronic Mail and Company Resources and Equipment policy, which is 
a condition of employment with CCI.
San Juan, Puerto Rico Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order against 
Bynum that required him to cease and desist from utilizing, transmitting, selling, or 
reproducing any form of database or other trade secrets obtained during the course of 
his employment with CCI. The injunction granted CCI the right to seize all materials 
contained in any computers, disks, or other information-technology items in the 
personal possession of the defendant. CCI alleged that Bynum had been selling a 
database of key island (Puerto Rico) business contacts to companies to market their 
products and services.
Again, this is an example of personal greed, motivated as much by circumstances 
as opportunity. It is not beyond the pale to assume your employees know who your 
competitors are and how to reach out to these ﬁ rms to sell your intellectual property 
should the opportunity present itself and the competitor be unscrupulous enough to 
accept it (unlike the Lightwave Microsystems case).
Corning and PicVue
A case that hit the public eye in 2005, and that was settled in 2006, has these very 
circumstances present, where an opportunity presented to a low-level employee, coupled 
with the identiﬁ cation of an interested party, created a temptation for instant ﬁ nancial 
gain that was simply too great for a weak-willed employee to ignore.
This was the case of Corning Incorporated and PicVue Electronics, the latter a 
Taiwanese corporation. On October 20, 2005, the Department of Justice charged 
Jonathan Sanders, an employee of Corning’s Harrodsburg, KY plant, with the theft of 
trade secret material belonging to Corning. Speciﬁ cally, material pertaining to an 
“overﬂ ow down draw fusion glass-making process used to produce Thin Filter 
Transistor (TFT) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) ﬂ at panel glass.”
In the DOJ complaint, it is alleged that Sanders began his theft of Corning’s IP in 
December 1999 and continued to perpetrate the crime through December 2001. 
Sanders allegedly took, without authorization, trade secret material belonging to 
Corning and subsequently sold that same material to PicVue Electronics Ltd., 

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2 
21
a Taiwanese corporation. This case of Economic Espionage, not only involved PicVue 
Electronics, the corporation, but also the former president of PicVue.
When arrested, Sanders waived his right to a preliminary hearing, was indicted, 
and pled guilty. He was sentenced to 48 months imprisonment and ordered to pay 
a ﬁ ne of US$20,000 on April 18, 2006.
He told the FBI that he found blueprints containing the Corning trade secrets 
within a Corning warehouse in 1999. The blueprints were within a container of 
sensitive corporate material awaiting destruction. He said he simply took the 
blueprints instead of destroying them.
In December 1999, Sanders then traveled to California and met with PicVue’s 
company president, Jacob Lin, as well as Yeong C. Lin, a consultant to PicVue. Sanders 
claimed he only described the fusion draw process, and did not show the drawings to 
the PicVue president nor his consultant. Subsequent to this meeting, Sanders was 
allegedly offered a job by PicVue, but declined the position.
Then around September 2000, Yeong C. Lin, the consultant, informed PicVue 
that Sanders was now offering Corning’s blueprints/drawings via an oral description. 
PicVue authorized the payment of US$30,000 and wired the funds to a California 
bank account, where apparently the PicVue consultant took control of the funds. The 
consultant then enlisted the aid of a college roommate, Danny Price, who carried 
US$25,000 to a meeting with Sanders outside of Atlanta, GA, so as to obfuscate the 
connection between PicVue and Sanders.
Sanders met with Price as planned, outside of Atlanta, and accepted the money 
from Price. In exchange, he provided Price with the Corning blueprints he had 
stolen from the corporate sensitive data destruction bin. Price apparently gave the 
documents to consultant, Lin, who met with PicVue engineers in California. The 
PicVue engineers took digital pictures of the blueprint documents and transferred 
the images to a digital storage device. The engineers hand-carried the digital storage 
device back to Taiwan, and the blueprints were then, allegedly, destroyed.
Two months later (November 2000), engineers from PicVue traveled to Kentucky 
and met with Sanders directly to discuss the blueprints he had sold to PicVue. Sanders 
claims the conversations were centered on providing clariﬁ cation to PicVue on details 
contained within the blueprints.
PicVue representatives then traveled to the ofﬁ ces of Saint-Gobain glass, Niagara 
Falls, NY in September 2001 to purchase a part speciﬁ c to the fusion process. Given 
the prior commercial relationship between Corning and Saint-Gobain, the latter 
recognized the utility of the part as being only applicable to the fusion draw process 

www.syngress.com
22 
Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
and alerted Corning to the possibility that their trade secrets had been compromised 
to PicVue.
Corning representatives visited Saint-Gobain’s ofﬁ ces, reviewed the speciﬁ cations 
provided by PicVue and concluded that Corning trade secrets were involved. Corning 
contacted the FBI, who opened an investigation October 2001.
In this instance, Corning apparently had a set of procedures in place to destroy 
company conﬁ dential documents, but it would appear no mechanism existed to ensure 
that documents put into the “to-be-destroyed” bin were, in fact, subsequently destroyed. 
Again, the company was ignorant of the theft of their intellectual property until the 
recipient—PicVue, in this case—approached one of the few ﬁ rms in the world able to 
create the parts necessary to make the purloined documents effective in the 
marketplace. If there is a bright side to the entire episode, it is the strength of the 
relationship between Corning and Saint-Gobain, which brought this illegal activity 
to light, not internal procedures.
Let us assume you have appropriate checks and balances in place to protect 
yourself against the opportunistic and greed-driven employee. What defense do you 
have to protect yourself when the theft of your technology is premeditated by 
individuals who are the leaders, and literally in the driver’s seat of one of your main 
competitors? Can’t happen, you say? Think again.
Avery Dennison and Four Pillars
Let’s now review the well-documented and publicized instance of intellectual property 
theft that was encountered by Avery Dennison, the ﬁ rm that makes labels, and by 
extension, the ﬁ rm that spends a great deal of money on the research and development 
of adhesives. Unbeknownst to the company, they had had their intellectual property 
stolen from them from 1989 through 1997. The theft of their IP was literally a 
textbook example of the methodical harvesting of a ﬁ rm’s technological advances 
and research by a competitor.
Avery Dennison, whose headquarters is in Pasadena, CA, is one of the United States 
largest manufacturers of adhesive labels, and retains intellectual property for these formulas. 
The ﬁ rm’s adhesives and methodologies give Avery Dennison their market advantage 
within the global adhesive label market. Because of this, a competitor, Four Pillars 
Enterprise Limited of Taiwan, speciﬁ cally targeted their research facility in Concord, OH.
Four Pillars is a manufacturer of pressure-sensitive products in Taiwan, with market 
share both in the United States and the Far East. Prior to 1989, Four Pillars CEO 
had identiﬁ ed his competition and had noted the competitive advantage held by 

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2 
23
market-sector leader Avery Dennison and so had set out as a corporate goal to 
capitalize on Avery Dennison’s advance research in adhesives. A very determined 
individual, he was successful in stealing the formulas for Avery Dennison’s adhesives—
some might say very successful.
Successful that is, until 1997, when one of his Four Pillars’ employees applied for 
work with Avery Dennison, and during the course of the interview(s) revealed that for 
the preceding eight years, Avery Dennison’s adhesive formulas were being provided 
to Four Pillars by an employee of Avery Dennison.
Avery Dennison had not previously detected this theft of their IP. The ﬁ rm took the 
correct action and contacted the FBI, and together with Avery Dennison, the two 
contrived a sting operation to identify the employee who was supplying Four Pillars with 
company secrets. The sting operation was fruitful and identiﬁ ed Mr. Ten Hong Lee—a.k.a., 
Victor Lee—a U.S. citizen and senior research engineer at Avery Dennison’s Concord, 
Ohio research facility, who was stealing the intellectual property of his employer.
Lee was confronted and admitted his guilt, confessing to having stolen the formulas 
and methodologies of his employer from 1989 to 1997. He was later persuaded to 
act as a cooperative witness for the Department of Justice (DOJ), who wished to 
prosecute this theft of the intellectual property of a United States corporation by a 
foreign national, under the powers of the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996.
The ensuing investigation revealed Lee—who received his undergraduate degree 
at the National University of Taipei, his Masters degree in polymer science from Akron 
University, and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Texas Tech—had been invited 
to Taiwan by the Industrial Technology Research Institute to give a lecture at one of 
their conferences. While there, he was asked to present a technical lecture to Four 
Pillars by the company’s technical director.
During this visit to Taiwan, Lee was enticed to covertly enter into a relationship 
with Pin Yen Yang—a.k.a., P.Y. Yang—President and CEO of the Taiwanese ﬁ rm, 
Four Pillars Enterprise Company, Ltd as a “secret consultant.” For this, he was paid 
$25,000 for his ﬁ rst year. Lee, Yang, and Yang’s daughter, Hwei Chen Yang—a.k.a., Sally 
Yang—conspired to provide the Yangs with Avery Dennison’s intellectual property 
and business methodologies. In exchange, Lee would be paid substantial sums of 
money—to be deposited with Lee’s relatives, who were resident in Taiwan.
Following the discovery by Avery Dennison, the covert relationship continued 
under FBI scrutiny until early September 1997, when Lee provided to the Yangs 
proprietary information of Avery Dennison origin during a meeting monitored and 
controlled by the FBI in a room within the Holiday Inn located in Westlake, Ohio. 
Lee indicated on the video coverage of the meeting to the Yangs that the papers he 

www.syngress.com
24 
Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
was providing were the intellectual proprietary property of Avery Dennison. The 
Yangs acknowledged such, and following the meeting, the Yangs were observed 
cutting, with a knife, the headers and footers off the documents provided by Lee. 
Subsequently, the Yangs were arrested by the FBI as they attempted to board a plane 
and return to their corporate headquarters with the data.
The relationship between Lee and the Yangs’ Four Pillars was a clear case of “economic 
espionage.” During the prosecution of this case, it was learned that Lee was paid more 
than $150,000 over a period of eight years in exchange for sharing the intellectual 
property of his employer, Avery Dennison. In 1999, U.S. District Court Judge Peter C. 
Economus convicted both Yang and his daughter for stealing trade secrets and also 
convicted Four Pillars on economic espionage charges. Yang was sentenced to six 
months of home conﬁ nement and ﬁ ned $250,000; his daughter was ﬁ ned $5,000 and 
received a year’s probation. The ﬁ rm, Four Pillars, was ﬁ ned $5 million for accepting 
the pilfered trade secrets. Lee pled guilty to wire fraud and defrauding his employer.
Avery Dennison’s discovery of Four Pillars’ illegal activity was due to a serendipitous 
event, the employment application by a former Four Pillars’ employee and this 
employee’s willingness to share information concerning Four Pillars’ recruitment of 
an Avery Dennison employee for the sole purpose of compromising the intellectual 
property of Avery Dennison. In this instance, Four Pillars personnel targeted an 
individual with whom the Yangs could relate to on the basis of ethnicity, leveraging 
Lee’s desire to help a fellow-countryman. The Yangs stroked Lee’s ego, giving him 
“recognition” for his intellect, and providing him with remuneration in a covert 
manner—thus, keeping his skullduggery out of the view of the tax authorities, Avery 
Dennison lenders, or others who may question the increase/addition in Lee’s income.
The Yangs’ investment of approximately $150,000 resulted in an approximate $30 
to 50 million loss to Avery Dennison. It is worth noting that Yang and his ﬁ rm Four 
Pillars were acting in their own self-interest and not at the behest of any other entity.
Four Pillars ultimately appealed their conviction to the Supreme Court, hoping for 
a reduction in the sentence, but the convictions were upheld in October 2002. Four 
Pillars continues to be an active ﬁ rm, involved in adhesive and label manufacturing.
Lexar Media and Toshiba
Let’s move on to one of those ticklish situations that every company that has ever collabo-
rated with another company encounters: Is this a win-win scenario, or am I placing my company 
in a situation of inordinate risk? The answer could be yes—It could be a win-win situation—but 
you must keep your eye on your property and monitor your partner’s actions as well.

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2

Now, let’s review the litigation undertaken by Lexar Media (as of June 2006, 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Technology) and their successful lawsuit in 
which they claimed the theft of their trade secrets by a foreign competitor and the 
competitor’s U.S. subsidiaries.
In late March 2005, a California Superior Court jury found Toshiba Corporation 
(a Japanese company) guilty of the theft of trade secrets from Lexar Media and assessed 
damages of $381.4 million and punitive damages of $84 million for a total of 
$465.4 million. Lexar had alleged that Toshiba had utilized Lexar’s trade secrets in 
Toshiba’s product line, which included NAND ﬂ ash chips, Compact Flash cards, 
xD-Picture cards, and Secure Digital cards. The jury agreed and the issuance of punitive 
damages by the jury indicated that the jury found Toshiba’s actions to be oppressive, 
fraudulent, and/or malicious.
Toshiba petitioned the court in April 2005 to recognize the jury’s award as an 
advisory verdict and asked that the monetary damages be reduced, while Lexar 
petitioned the court for an injunction against Toshiba so as to prevent the sale of any 
Toshiba products that incorporated Lexar’s intellectual property. On October 14, 2005, 
the court ruled that the jury ﬁ ndings were not advisory but in fact ﬁ nal. The court also 
declined to issue an injunction against Toshiba. Lexar’s Executive Vice President and 
General Counsel, Eric Whitaker, noted that Lexar will continue to pursue patent 
infringement litigation against Toshiba, and remains conﬁ dent that once patent 
infringement has been conﬁ rmed, that an injunction against Toshiba preventing the sale 
of their products will be forthcoming. Then in April 2006, Lexar ﬁ led a petition with 
the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to initiate a Section 337 investigation in 
which Lexar asked that Toshiba’s NAND ﬂ ash memory chips be barred from import 
into the United States. According to an ITC press release, in May 2006 the ITC voted 
to institute an investigation of certain ﬂ ash memory chips, ﬂ ash memory systems, and 
products containing the same. In October 2006, Toshiba and Micron (having acquired 
Lexar) reached a settlement, the details of which were omitted from the public Securities 
and Exchange Commission ﬁ lings of November 2006.
A tremendous amount of legal wrangling was involved in the proceedings, and 
while a settlement occurred, it begs the question: How did it get this far? According 
to Lexar, in mid-1996 Lexar Media was created by employees of Cirrus Corporation, 
and its business plan centered on technology created by Cirrus. Prior to the creation 
of Lexar, Cirrus and Toshiba had been involved in discussions (1994 to 1995) on how 
Cirrus would collaborate with Toshiba in creating ﬂ ash memory controllers in support 
of Toshiba’s preferred ﬂ ash memory technology. Upon creation of Lexar, discussions

Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
between Toshiba and Lexar increased in depth and frequency. Toshiba and Lexar’s 
Toshiba—Toshiba America and Toshiba America Electronic Components (TEAC)—
were given access to Lexar’s intellectual property under a Non-Disclosure Agreement 
(NDA) signed on December 1, 1996, which had a ﬁ ve-year expiration date.
Following the signing of the NDA, in-depth discussion between the parties ensued, 
and Toshiba invested US$3 million in Lexar in May 1997. They also placed a member on 
the board of directors of Lexar. Throughout 1997, Lexar continued to share intellectual 
property with Toshiba. In April 1998, Toshiba and Lexar entered into a partnership so as 
to be competitive in the ﬂ ash memory market. The joint relationship apparently 
prospered throughout 1998 and most of 1999. On October 6, 1999, Toshiba and 
SanDisk announced in a joint press statement that the two ﬁ rms had entered into a joint 
agreement to develop and manufacturer Gigabit Scale ﬂ ash memory. Interestingly, the 
Toshiba board member apparently missed the October 5, 1999 Lexar board meeting. 
Lexar felt that their “partner” had sold them out to their main competitor in the ﬂ ash 
memory market—SanDisk. Not only had Toshiba been a partner in numerous joint 
development projects, but Toshiba’s presence on the Lexar board of directors provided 
Toshiba with all the strengths and weaknesses of the ﬁ rm.
The Lexar board requested an explanation from the board member representing 
their partner Toshiba. The board member provided assurances that the agreement 
between Toshiba and SanDisk did not involve Lexar technologies. The board member 
continued with his assurances, noting the publicized agreement between Toshiba and 
SanDisk involved a separate division within Toshiba than that involved with Lexar. 
Less than seven months later, SanDisk and Toshiba announced in a joint press 
statement that the two had signed a US$700 million deal to create a joint fabrication 
facility in Virginia to produce multilevel cell (MLC) ﬂ ash memory chips. Lexar 
believed that their intellectual property, speciﬁ cally the multipage write technology 
was being used in this, and that without this technology, the MLC ﬂ ash memory 
initiative would not be ﬁ nancially viable.
Lexar believes that Toshiba and its subsidiaries have incorporated into their 
product line intellectual property which, when disclosed by Lexar to Toshiba, were 
not only considered proprietary trade secrets of Lexar, but also were covered under 
the subsequent NDA. Though suspicious, it was not until Toshiba published in 2001 
the technologies used in their MLC smart memory application that proof was evident 
to Lexar that their IP had been used.
In this instance, Lexar was able to prove what they suspected when Toshiba 
published the technical speciﬁ cations of the Toshiba product line. What makes this 

www.syngress.com

27
case especially noteworthy is the apparent brashness on the part of Toshiba. Toshiba 
had a seat on the board of the company whose intellectual property they would be 
purloining. In addition, Toshiba had a number of joint development projects, during 
which Lexar’s intellectual property was fully disclosed to Toshiba, and which Toshiba 
then leveraged for their own beneﬁ t in their own product line.
So, would Lexar not have lost their intellectual property had they chosen their 
partners more carefully? Probably yes, but did they have a choice in choosing their 
dance partner? Lexar was a spin-out and a startup and thus required a rock-solid 
partnership to reduce the unremunerated burn rate and shorten the distance to 
proﬁ tability. The preexisting Lexar/Toshiba relationship at ﬁ rst appears to have given 
Toshiba the impetus to take advantage of the startup’s perceived lack of attention to 
the protection of their intellectual property, when in reality the importance of the 
intellectual property was not lost on the Lexar executive team, being that they did 
pay attention and did notice it, albeit after the theft had occurred and the IP had 
been incorporated into a competitor’s product.
SigmaTel and Citroen
Which brings us to two situations of alleged IP theft involving companies from two 
separate industries—automotive and audio entertainment devices. So what’s the 
similarity? Both companies allege that their patented methodologies were copied by 
a competitor located within China and then marketed within the Chinese market—
thus, the companies in each case apparently ended up competing against their own 
product designs, manufactured by companies that had little or no research costs 
associated with the development of the product design, allowing the companies to 
market the product for a cost considerably less than the company owning the patent. 
So, is that the price of doing business in China? The government of China claims to 
be improving their intellectual property rights protection methodologies, but as we 
noted earlier, they have a long row to hoe. There will be repeated instances where 
individual corporations will be victimized. Unscrupulous business practices will 
always arise when intellectual property protection is lax.
In January 2005, SigmaTel, a developer and manufacturer of audio devices, ﬁ led 
suit against Actions Semiconductor Company of Zhuhai, Guangdong, China (Actions 
Semi), alleging that Actions Semi’s integrated circuits, which are within Action Semi’s 
MP3 players, infringe upon multiple patents related to SigmaTel’s portable audio 
devices. SigmaTel followed in March 2005, with the ﬁ ling of a complaint with the 

www.syngress.com
28 
Chapter 2 • When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), requesting that the ITC initiate a 
Section 337 investigation on Actions Semi. In the ITC complaint, SigmaTel identi-
ﬁ ed the speciﬁ c patents that they believe had been infringed upon and requested that 
the ITC grant a permanent exclusion order, banning the importation into the U.S. of 
the infringing products and issuing a cease-and-desist order halting sale of these same 
products. The ITC opened an investigation, and the trial began in November 2005.
Actions Semi claimed no infringement of SigmaTel’s patents has occurred. In September 
2006, the ITC found that Actions had infringed upon SigmaTel’s patents and rendered 
judgment in favor of SigmaTel. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order protecting 
SigmaTel in the U.S. market from Actions Semi’s importation of products that were found 
to contain certain identiﬁ ed components. Thus, SigmaTel had their U.S. market protected.
The second case, which occurred in October 2005, involves Citroen’s joint 
venture in China: Dongfeng Peugot Citroen Automobile. Citroen alleged that 
Shanghai Maple used Citroen’s core chassis technology in producing a series of 
Shanghai Maple models. According to the Chinese press, Shanghai Maple claimed 
their automobiles were created from their own designs. Citroen, however, claimed 
their patent on “special chassis technology” had already been ﬁ led with the world IP 
rights organization and had not been licensed to Shanghai Maple. Shanghai Maple, a 
subsidiary of Geely Automobile, claimed no knowledge of any infringement, stating 
that they had never received any documentation from Citroen.
Interestingly, the unlicensed use of technology apparently is not an unusual 
occurrence within the Chinese automotive manufacturing sector. In May 2005, 
General Motors Daewoo alleged that Cherry QQ copied its “Spark” sedan design and 
so demanded 80 million RMB (approximately US$10 million) as compensation for 
patent infringement. Prior to the GM/Cherry suit, Dongfeng Honda and Toyota 
Auto sued Hebei Shuanghuan Auto and Geely Auto for similar reasons.
Truly remarkable is the perspective of the deputy engineer from within the China 
Automotive Technology & Research Center, Zhang Zhenzhi, who noted in the 
Shanghai Daily News, “It’s inevitable for domestic automakers to imitate other advanced 
technologies, no matter from other domestic companies or foreign ﬁ rms. But in the 
future, we would be able to better our designs after getting more experience on 
developing our own autos.” To the untrained eye, it would appear that loss of IP is 
expected and will continue to be accepted within the nascent Chinese auto industry.
In both of these examples, the company whose technology has been illegally used did 
all of the right steps to protect their intellectual property—for example, ﬁ ling patents, and 
so on. But in the end, they found themselves caught up in an embryonic legal system, 

www.syngress.com
 
When Insiders and/or Competitors Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 2 
29
oftentimes described as a litigation quagmire of quicksand where it is all but impossible to 
effectively litigate patent violations. In SigmaTel’s instance, they took appropriate measures 
to protect themselves within one of their prime markets—the United States. The fact that 
they prevailed in the ITC trail speaks volumes, especially given that the overt threat to 
SigmaTel’s market share in the U.S. was successfully mitigated. That said, the injunction, 
levied against Actions Semi, affects only business within the U.S. and has no effect on the 
China or European market. While in Citroen’s instance, it boils down to what they would 
call in prohibition-era Chicago—gettin’ the business—where the deputy engineer from 
within the ofﬁ cial Chinese Automotive Technology & Research Center viewed the 
apparent “borrowing” of IP as the norm—something to be expected of young companies, 
and something to be tolerated by the more established new-to-China foreign ﬁ rms.
3dGEO – China
In 2004, Chinese citizen Yan Ming Shan, 34, of Daqing, China, pled guilty in federal 
court to a one-count indictment that charged him with the unauthorized access to 
the computer programs of 3dGEO, where he fraudulently obtained proprietary 
source code and other software. Shan was sentenced to two years imprisonment.
According to the DOJ press release concerning this case, from April to September 
2002 Shan worked for 3dGEO Development, Inc., a Mountain View, California 
company that develops software used in the survey of land for sources of natural gas 
and oil. 3dGEO employed Shan under an agreement with one of its customers, 
PetroChina, a Chinese company with a division named DaQing Oil, which arranged 
for its employee to travel to California for training on 3dGEO’s software. FBI agents 
arrested Mr. Shan in September 2002 as he attempted to board a ﬂ ight to China. 
Ever since, he has been held in custody as a ﬂ ight risk, pending trial.
Interestingly, in an interview with 3dGEO’s president, Dimitri Bevc, which 
occurred shortly after the arrest of Shan, Bevc said the episode highlighted a dilemma 
for the company, which was seeking to secure its intellectual property but also expand 
its business in Asia. “There’s incredible demand from Chinese ﬁ rms that are hungry for 
technology,” said Mr. Bevc. “But we are built on our own intellectual property.”
Bevc continued, saying he was afraid his company was being punished in the 
Chinese marketplace. In addition, with the pending payments from PetroChina for 
work already completed, Mr. Bevc said his company’s Chinese sales prospects had 
been drying up. “What we heard back was… that 3dGEO did something wrong” by 
taking action against Mr. Shan, who served most of his sentence while awaiting trial, 
and has since returned to China, Mr. Bevc related.

Chapter 3 • When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
Introduction
Unfortunately, the threat does not stop with competitors and individuals. Indeed, it gets 
worse. Nations, even friendly nations, have differing issues and perspectives on how to 
handle international relations and international economic interaction. Therefore, it should 
come as no surprise when state entities, be they a foreign or domestic intelligence service, 
national research institute or laboratory, or a state-owned enterprise engage in activities 
that would fall outside the norms of normal business practices and engage in what is 
known as “Economic Espionage.” The state-sponsored threat is a global issue, and is not 
unique to U.S. businesses or research centers.
Why do nations engage in economic espionage? Primarily to acquire technology 
to either advance a military program, to advance the economic competitiveness of the 
nation’s industrial base, or to simply ensure that the major companies and contributors 
to the nation’s GDP continue to make that contribution. How do these nation states 
affect the acquisition of the IP? In some instances, it engages the services of the nation’s 
law enforcement or intelligence services to surreptitiously acquire the IP. While in other 
circumstances, the nation publicly engages the owner of the IP, demanding something 
the nation believes is in the best interest of their citizens.
A nation’s lack of enforcement and/or engagement in the protection of intellectual 
property within their jurisdictional areas of responsibility leads one to conclude that 
this silent collusion is as damaging as the blatant or covert activities. Each year the Ofﬁ ce 
of the U.S. Trade Representative produces a “Special 301 Report” that highlights 
those countries the U.S. has placed on their Special Watchlist. In the 2007 report, 43 
countries were included in the list with China and Russia ranked number one and 
two respectively (see Appendix E for a complete list). The 52-page report can be 
found at the Ofﬁ ce of the United States Trade Representative’s Web site (www.ustr.gov).
The United States has no program or policy to provide economic or industrial 
competitive intelligence to U.S. businesses. Many nations do have such programs and 
policies. Indeed, U.S. economic policy precludes such. Governmental efforts are focused 
on the protection of IP owned by U.S. persons or corporate entities and keeping the 
economic pitch level as U.S. corporations compete within the global marketplace. 
Discussion points can and have been made both for and against the U.S. governmental 
agencies and departments, such as the Department of State, Department of Commerce, 
the National Intelligence Director, and the various agencies making up the U.S. 
intelligence community that devotes resources and provides economic intelligence to

33
U.S. persons and corporations. The stronger point is to maintain the status quo with 
respect to governmental provisions regarding information to U.S. corporations, except 
when corporate America is speciﬁ cally the target of a foreign government sponsored 
activity or when the economic playing ﬁ eld must be leveled.
Airbus and Saudi Arabian Airlines
The international market place is an active milieu, oftentimes ﬁ lled with intrigue.
One well-documented historical case is the egregious attempt by Airbus to bribe 
its way into the 1994 Saudi Arabian Airlines ﬂ eet modernization effort by offering 
bribes to individuals from both the Saudi airlines and government. During a 1994 
visit to the late King Fahd, then French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, followed 
through on the Airbus effort, and had hoped to secure the US$6 billion order for 
Airbus. He was derailed when the U.S. government provided to the Saudi government 
the content of the U.S. National Security Agency’s intercepts, which fully documented the 
nefarious French activity. It is possible that without the U.S. government’s intercession, the 
U.S. aviation industry would have been found “noncompetitive.” But how does this 
translate into a threat to the intellectual property of a competitor? Simply put, if a 
nation is willing to support their industries in the global marketplace in this manner, 
the distance to supporting their industries by targeting the IP via the employees or 
physical assets of a foreign competitor is not great. In fact, two former directors of 
the French foreign intelligence service, the DGSE (Direction Generale de la Securite 
Exterieure), Pierre Marion and Charles Silberzahn, have stated publicly how one of 
the DGSE’s collection priorities is to collect economic intelligence. Silberzahn noted 
how France had been successful in this regard, and the theft of classiﬁ ed and proprietary 
information was a long-term government policy (see Cryptography’s Role in Securing 
the Information Society. The National Academies Press. Kenneth W. Dam and Herbert 
S. Lin, editors).
Russian Intelligence 
and Japanese Trade Secrets
The state-sponsored activity doesn’t always occur in the United State nor is the 
target or victim always a U.S. ﬁ rm. Ironically, sometimes the target is a company who 
themselves were found guilty by the legal system as having instigated instances of 
industrial espionage and to have stolen a competitor’s IP. Let’s start with a recently 

www.syngress.com
34 
Chapter 3 • When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
publicized case involving Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the SVR (Sluzhba 
Vneshny Razvedki) and an employee of the Toshiba Corporation of Japan.
It should be noted that in late-January 2005, Russia’s Prime Minister Fradkov 
requested the leadership of Russia’s internal security service, the FSB (Federal’naya 
Sluzhba Bezopasnosti) to increase their efforts to assist Russian commercial enterprises. 
Fradkov was speciﬁ c in his request: “We continue to require up-to-date information 
from the FSB that allows us to form a quality legal foundation and to make decisions 
on leveling the playing ﬁ eld for competition, developing businesses, and creating an 
attractive investment climate.”
This statement is tantamount to a public declaration by the Prime Minister that 
the intelligence and security services of Russia should engage in intelligence collection 
and reporting activities in support of Russian commercial enterprises. While no surprise, 
since this is an activity that many believe the Russian intelligence and security services 
have been covertly engaged in long before the Cold War, it is a conﬁ rmation of 
intent nonetheless.
Evidence of the SVR’s attempt to fulﬁ ll this mission statement was provided 
when an SVR operation apparently went awry in Japan. In late October 2005, the 
Public Safety Department of the Tokyo Police charged Vladimir Saveliev, an SVR ofﬁ cer, 
serving undercover as a diplomat assigned to the Russian trade mission in Tokyo, 
Japan as having recruited an employee of Toshiba Discrete Semiconductor Technology 
Corporation. Saveliev is alleged to have paid this unidentiﬁ ed employee a million yen 
(approximately US$9,000) for what the Russian believed to be conﬁ dential Toshiba 
proprietary information. The Japanese law enforcement investigators believe Saveliev 
learned conﬁ dential information that had military applicability, including information 
that referenced semiconductor systems of electric ﬂ ux control, missile guidance 
systems, and jet ﬁ ghter radars.
When queried about these charges on October 20, 2005, a spokesman for the 
SVR told the press, “In line with the practice generally accepted by all special services 
in the world, the SVR will not comment on the afﬁ liation of this or that individual 
with the intelligence community.”
How did the SVR engage in this case of Economic Espionage against a Japanese 
corporate entity? The activity apparently was initiated in the spring of 2004 when 
Saveliev introduced himself to the unidentiﬁ ed Japanese citizen under the cover of an 
“Italian consultant.” The police noted in their declaration that between September 2004 
and May 2005, the two met nine times in Tokyo’s cheap beer shops and bistros during 
which Saveliev, utilizing his cover as a consultant, paid the Japanese citizen for the 

www.syngress.com
 
When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 3 
35
provision of conﬁ dential Toshiba data. The Japanese citizen provided the information 
to Saveliev via “smart memory cards.” Apparently the Japanese citizen had natural access 
to the information Saveliev desired and copied this information to a temporary memory 
device—the “smart memory card.” In June 2005, Saveliev quietly departed Japan.
Why did the SVR target Toshiba? As the SVR’s press ofﬁ cer noted, the SVR does 
not comment on such. One could speculate that perhaps the technology would be 
used to augment Russian military knowledge of technology used in an adversary’s 
weapon systems? Perhaps the technology was to be provided to a Russian commercial 
or state-owned entity to jumpstart research and development activities and garner 
greater market share in the global economic milieu. Regardless, the effect of the loss 
of the data doesn’t end at Toshiba’s door or that of the Japanese law enforcement and 
counterintelligence entities. Toshiba claims their loss is minimal, if at all, since the 
information taken is now freely available. However, certain long-term issues must be 
addressed.
Future users of the technologies stolen by Saveliev must take into consideration 
the fact that this technology was of sufﬁ cient importance to the government of the 
Russian Federation to use their most valuable intelligence resource—an undercover 
intelligence ofﬁ cer—to acquire the technology. Remember, Saveliev was posted 
abroad serving under diplomatic cover within the Russian commercial ofﬁ ce in 
Tokyo. He opted to undertake a high-risk operation—operating in an alias persona 
as an Italian consultant in Tokyo, a city where he is well known in his true persona. 
Is this a case of incompetence? Why was the information of such import as to warrant 
the risk of discovery, when it would appear that the information could have been 
obtained by Saveliev, the commercial ofﬁ cer, via direct overt contact? The SVR Resident 
in Tokyo (Resident is the head of the SVR ﬁ eld entity) weighed the risks, or blowback, 
of his activities in Tokyo to the SVR and to the Russian Federation against the potential 
gain. One must conclude that the technical requirement levied by SVR Headquarters 
was extraordinarily important. Interestingly, there has been no public protest by 
the government of Italy on Saveliev’s choice of nationality as a cover for his covert 
activities. While no public statement has been made, one may be assured that the 
SVR Resident in Rome received a tongue-lashing from the leadership of the Italian 
special services.
Then in August 2006, a separate Russian intelligence ofﬁ cer, this time from Russia’s 
military intelligence organization (the GRU, or Glavnoe Razvedyvatel’noe Upravlenie), but 
also serving undercover as a diplomat assigned to the Russian trade mission in Tokyo 
was charged with having recruited an employee of Nikon Corporation.

www.syngress.com
36 
Chapter 3 • When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
The technology of interest in this instance is Nikon’s variable optical attenuator 
(VOA), for which the recruited employee was the lead researcher. The R&D for this 
device was conducted at Nikon’s facility at Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. According to the 
open source material available about this device, the VOA is used to control and 
intensify light as it passes through ﬁ ber optics, something that Nikon considered a 
key piece of intellectual property.
The manner in which the GRU intelligence ofﬁ cer identiﬁ ed, courted, and recruited 
the Nikon researcher parallels that of the SVR’s ofﬁ cer’s activities. The researcher was met 
during a business exhibition, and then over the course of two years the two are believed 
to have had at least ten meetings at bars and other Tokyo locations. In exchange for the 
information provided, the researcher was paid tens of thousands of yen. Upon discovery, 
the Nikon researcher resigned from Nikon, noting his unhappiness with his employment 
contract.
Japan and the 
Cleveland Clinic Foundation
The preceding two examples of Russian intelligence targeting commercial enterprises 
are straightforward and relatively easy to understand. The discovery of the SVR 
activity being conducted out of the same physical establishment within Tokyo, and 
the “diplomat” being sent back to Russia, were clearly not an effective deterrent. 
The GRU had its own operation in full swing and was producing key documents 
of interest. Since there was no incentive to stop, it continued. In these examples, the 
government has a need and the special services move forward to fulﬁ ll that need using 
their human intelligence tools—such as recruiting an individual who has access to 
information of interest of them: a player known as an insider.
That isn’t the only covert methodology used by a nation state. Let’s look at the 
well-documented and publicized case involving the world-renown Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation (CCF), located in Cleveland, Ohio. In May 2001, the U.S. attorney in the 
Northern District of Ohio indicted two individuals for the theft of intellectual 
property belonging to the CCF.
According to the DOJ, Takashi Okamoto and Hiroaki Serizawa were charged and 
convicted of stealing the intellectual property created by the Lerner Research Institute of the 
CCF. From January 1998 through September 1999, Serizawa and Okamoto conspired to 
misappropriate from the CCF genetic research materials—speciﬁ cally, “the deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) and cell line reagents and constructs which were developed by researchers 

www.syngress.com
 
When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 3 
37
employed by CCF, with funding provided by the CCF and the National Institutes of 
Health, to study the genetic cause of, and possible treatment for, Alzheimer’s Disease.”
The indictments charged Okamoto and Serizawa with having provided the stolen 
research (DNA and cell line reagents and constructs) to the Japanese Institute of Physical 
and Chemical Research (RIKEN), a research facility owned by the government of 
Japan. The indictment continues—RIKEN, at the direction of the Japanese Ministry 
of Science and Technology, formed a Brain Science Institute to conduct research in 
the area of neuroscience (which includes the genetic cause and possible treatments 
for Alzheimer’s disease).
According to the indictment, not only was it Okamoto’s intent to purloin the 
research and results from CCF, but also to destroy and sabotage the DNA and cell line 
reagents and constructs that were left behind at CCF and not removed. The boxes of 
materials stolen by Okamoto were shipped from Cleveland to Kansas (where Serizawa 
resided) within days of the theft and were subsequently hand-carried to Japan about a 
month later by Okamoto.
The ensuing investigation showed that Okamoto had been an unwitting accomplice 
of Serizawa and thus had been duped into storing the stolen research at his Kansas residence. 
Serizawa was nonetheless convicted of making false statements to the FBI, statements that 
the prosecution conceded he corrected on the same day he made them. For his involvement, 
Serizawa was ﬁ ned US$500 and placed on probation for three years. In addition, his 
movements were restricted, and he was ordered to perform 150 hours of community service.
The government of Japan claimed no knowledge of the activity. However, the 
DOJ continues to seek the extradition of Serizawa from Japan.
The theft by Okamoto set back the CCF’s research efforts into Alzheimer’s disease. 
One can only speculate on whether or not the IP stolen by Okamoto offered any 
advantage to the nascent RIKEN. It should be noted that both the Lerner Research 
Institute and RIKEN are leading research facilities in the ﬁ eld of Alzheimer’s disease.
Though the preceding occurred many years ago, two primary questions still 
remain unanswered. Was Okamoto sent to the CCF’s Lerner Research Institute for the 
purpose of obtaining a trusted position and then absconding with the IP, thus providing 
RIKEN a baseline from which to begin their efforts on Alzheimer’s disease, or was 
Okamoto simply a conniving individual who saw an opportunity to propel himself to 
the front of the Japanese research community? Why wouldn’t the government of Japan 
avail Okamoto for prosecution by the DOJ? The U.S. Department of Justice continues 
to attempt to extradite Okamoto from Japan to the United States and is continually 
rebuffed by the government of Japan.

China and Russia: TsNIIMASH-Export
This brings us to a most interesting case that is currently unfolding: the unlawful 
provision of IP involving a state-owned Russian technological concern providing 
information to a Chinese commercial entity. The Russian FSB has charged 
three senior executives of the state-owned-and-run space technology company, 
TsNIIMASH-Export, with embezzlement and the selling of secret Russian 
space technology to China. TsNIIMASH-Export is owned by the state-controlled 
Central Scientific Research Institute for Machine Building, and is located in 
Korolyov, the center of the Russian space community and the home to the “Mission 
Control” for all Russian space ﬂ ights. According to information available from the 
firm’s Web site, the company has participated in over 120 contracts with foreign 
entities.
On October 25, 2005, TsNIIMASH-Export director, Igor Reshetin, along with 
his deputy, Sergei Tverdokhklebov, and Tverdokhklebov’s aide, Alexander Rozhkin, 
were all arrested by the FSB. The three were alleged to have illegally provided Russian 
space technology that had dual-use applicability to a Chinese precision engineering 
import/export ﬁ rm. The dual-use technology apparently had applicability to Russian 
weapon systems, and could potentially provide the Chinese military with valuable secret 
information. The trio was also charged with having created multiple front companies 
through which approximately US$1 million of TsNIIMASH-Export’s funds were 
embezzled.
The connection between the front companies and the export of sensitive information 
to the Chinese ﬁ rm was not articulated. There has been no comment from the 
government of the People’s Republic of China, nor has the identity of the Chinese 
ﬁ rm or the ﬁ rm’s employees been revealed.
The trial began May 25, 2007 and is being closely watched by both industry and 
international governments to determine if this is a case of Chinese military manipulation, 
simple greed, or a bungled investigation.
Clearly, one can ask: Is this economic espionage, greed, opportunism, or all of the 
above? Regardless, it is viewed by the FSB as state-sponsored and of sufﬁ cient importance 
to publicize the arrest of the head of one of Russia’s most respected technological 
concerns and link his arrest to a Chinese ﬁ rm. The timing, in the midst of the successful 
Chinese manned space ﬂ ight begs the question: Is there a message being sent to the 
PRC by the Russian Federation? Only time will tell.

Overt Nation State Attempts: 
India, Venezuela, Brazil, and Others
With those examples under our belt, let’s move on to the overt nation-state attempts to 
garner IP from corporate entities for a variety of reasons. Whenever discussion on this 
topic is initiated, Coca-Cola and their formula always spring to mind, not withstanding 
the 2007 conviction of two Coca-Cola employees who offered up to rival Pepsi the 
“secret formulas.” Today, the estimated value of Coca-Cola’s trademark is US$70,450 
million. Would this be the current value had Coca-Cola acquiesced to the government 
of India in 1977? Maybe, maybe not; but Coca-Cola didn’t take any chances and 
protected their IP. In 1977, Coca-Cola controlled the Indian cola soft drink market, and 
Indira Gandhi’s Congress party lost control of the legislature to the Janata Party. One of 
the prime ﬁ nancial backers of Ghandi was the Coca-Cola bottler/distributor. In an 
apparent act of political revenge, the Industry Minister, George Fernandes, applied the 
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, which in 1977 strictly limited foreign investment in 
domestic ﬁ rms to 40 percent. Coca-Cola’s equity investment exceeded the 40-percent 
threshold. As the legend goes, Coca-Cola ofﬁ cials were summoned by Fernandes, asked 
to divest and to transfer their intellectual property, the syrup formula, to their Indian 
partners or leave the Indian market. Coca-Cola opted to leave the Indian market. It 
would be another 12 years (in 1989) before Coca-Cola returned to the Indian market. 
Interestingly, Fernandes continues to advocate removal of Coca-Cola from the Indian 
domestic market. Would or could this happen today? Countries can and do nationalize 
commercial concerns regularly—one only has to look at the current activities being 
undertaken by Cesar Chavez in Venezuela.
Venezuela’s regional neighbor, Brazil, has opted to take an interesting tact in 
addressing the value and intrinsic ownership of intellectual property. In mid-2005, 
the Brazilian Ministry of Health presented Abbot Laboratories of Chicago with an 
ultimatum: Reduce the price of Abbot’s drug, Kaletra (an effective AIDS drug), or 
Brazil will break the patent and produce the drug itself. After a month of negotiation, 
Abbott opted to reduce its price for Kaletra from $1.17/pill to $.63/pill, effectively 
reducing the cost to the government of Brazil by approximately $339 million over 
six years. Interestingly, Health Minister Jose Saraiva Felipe noted, “With the agreement, 
the need for breaking the patent is suspended. The price we reached is what the 
national AIDS program could pay.” This was not the ﬁ rst time Brazil had engaged the 
pharmaceutical companies, nor will it likely be the last.

Chapter 3 • When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
Merck Laboratories and Gilead Laboratories have both been engaged subsequent 
to the Abbot Laboratory settlement by Brazil in discussions aimed at reducing the 
price of the antiretroviral drugs they each produce. The Health Minister noted that 
the government of Brazil is attempting to induce Merck to allow it to produce a 
generic version of the drug, called efavirenz, and is also seeking a discount from 
Gilead on its drug, tenofoyir, which costs Brazil about $7/capsule, but is available in 
generic form from India at less than $1/capsule.
Then two years later, Brazil did what they said they would do, Brazilian President 
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signed a decree authorizing his country’s Ministry of Health 
to issue a “compulsory license” for efavirenz. Merck had offered to reduce the cost to 
Brazil for the efavirenz pills from US$1.79 each to US$1.10 each. Brazil found this 
reduction insufﬁ cient and noted that Merck sells the same drug in Thailand at $.65 
per pill. When Merck declined, as noted, Brazil followed through on their threat and 
has taken the path to break the patent and offer to the pharmaceutical a much smaller 
“royalty” stipend.
There is nothing covert about Brazil’s effort—the policy decision is stated publicly. 
The amount of funds available in the nation’s coffers to provide free AIDS/HIV 
antiretroviral drugs to the infected population of Brazil is deﬁ ned. Brazil has opted to 
engage in a frontal attack on the pharmaceutical industry. Some call this tactic nothing 
more than industrial blackmail, while others call it socialism at its best. Whatever it’s 
called name, the pharmaceutical industry calls it bad news.
But Brazil isn’t alone in going after the pharmaceutical companies. The Avian Flu 
outbreak in the Far East has created a fear of a global pandemic. Roche Holdings of 
Switzerland is ﬁ nding itself having to address governments around the globe, which 
are demanding product. In India, Dr. Ashwani Kumar, Drug Controller General of 
India, noted that Roche does not have a Tamiﬂ u product patent in India, and therefore 
India does not recognize the International Patent license that Roche possesses. 
Kumar continued that the International Patent is not enough to protect the Tamiﬂ u 
patent, according to Indian patent laws. Kumar invited Indian companies to ﬁ le 
license applications with the government to produce a generic form of Tamiﬂ u.
Though invited to break the patent, two separate Indian biopharmaceutical 
manufacturers, Cipla and Ranbaxy, are reported to be working with Roche to license 
Tamiﬂ u and then develop a generic Tamiﬂ u—Oseltamivir—without resorting to breaking 
the patent. In addition, Roche has approached a number of drug manufacturers to 
discuss licensing Tamiﬂ u, which Roche itself obtained, via exclusive license agreements 
from Gilead Laboratories in 1996. Roche notes that while there is no guarantee any 

www.syngress.com
 
When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 3 
41
of these discussions will lead to a licensing agreement, it is hopeful that such will be 
possible, and that an equitable relationship will be sought to address the emergency 
need for Tamiﬂ u.
While Roche stood to earn approximately $1 billion from Tamiﬂ u sales in 2005 alone 
and had encountered requests from a number of countries to allow generic production 
of the drug, Roche is standing ﬁ rm on its unwillingness to relinquish the patent, which 
is protected into 2016, and is demanding a licensing fee. Roche’s spokeswoman, 
Martina Rupp, defends the position: “Since we have been making this drug for the 
last ten years, it would be best for countries to enter into discussion with us.” Rupp 
noted that the ten-step process of manufacturing Tamiﬂ u is complex.
What of these frontal attacks on private enterprise and the value of intellectual 
property owned by these ﬁ rms? The for-proﬁ t ﬁ rms earn tremendous amounts of 
revenue and provide substantial returns to their investors. Why would anyone have 
one iota of concern whether they earn a few less million dollars? Where will the 
research and development of future therapeutics occur? Public-funded programs are 
highly unlikely to move as quickly or adroitly to bring therapeutics to the market as 
the commercial ﬁ rms, who answer to the free market economy.
The “public health” rubric is an easily comprehensible area for the potential of the state 
insinuating itself into the market equation and turning the expected return on investment 
into a tizzy. If the free market prohibits the provision of a return on investment through 
the tactic of breaking patents, the deleterious affect will be tremendous. What is to stop a 
nation from extending the concept that worked so well with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers to other sectors? The precedent has been sent. The World Intellectual Property 
Organization must address this issue, otherwise the basic incentive to invent, create, and 
innovate will be negated.
Current and Future 
Threats to Economic Security
We’ve discussed a number of cases that provide a taste of the intrigue concerning 
how the geo-political milieu can have a direct effect on the fortunes of private 
enterprises. But really, just how serious is the issue? In the United States, it is very 
serious. The United States is under economic attack, according to the United States 
National Counterintelligence Executive’s report to Congress in February 2005. 
In March 2005, the National Counterintelligence Strategy was outlined, and in May 
2005, the National Counterintelligence Executive noted that U.S. businesses must not 

www.syngress.com

Chapter 3 • When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
only protect themselves against their competitors, but also the foreign intelligence 
services of their competitors’ countries. The report goes into some depth in identifying 
the types of foreign entities conducting industrial and economic espionage; the kind of 
information targeted by these foreign entities; and which foreign entities are attempting 
to acquire sensitive U.S. technology (either classiﬁ ed or proprietary)— be they private or 
governmental.
It is prudent to discuss the reports ﬁ ndings since it is directly germane to this 
discussion. The report indicates that individuals from almost 100 separate countries 
attempted to acquire sensitive U.S. information. The role of the state-supported 
intelligence collection effort against U.S. technology/IP was characterized in the report’s 
ﬁ ndings with the statement, “It is clear, however, that some foreign countries, including 
the major players, also continued to employ state actors—including their intelligence 
services—as well as commercial enterprises, particularly when seeking the most 
sensitive and difﬁ cult-to-acquire technologies.”
The report identiﬁ ed the following dual-use areas as being targeted: information 
systems, military production processes and communication systems, aeronautics, 
electronics, and armaments and energetic materials. The report laments the difﬁ culty 
in tracking foreign targeting of purely civilian technologies and highlights the reluctance 
of U.S. ﬁ rms to share information. The report opines that such reluctance is due to 
U.S. ﬁ rms not wishing to highlight their loss, as doing so may have a deleterious effect 
on “investor and consumer conﬁ dence and stock prices.” That said, the identiﬁ ed 
commercial technologies stolen by foreign entities included semiconductor production 
processes, computer microprocessors, software, proprietary information, and chemical 
formulas.
It is especially noteworthy, that the U.S. Counterintelligence Community expects 
no decline in foreign intelligence activities, while also noting that stemming the ﬂ ow 
of information will become more difﬁ cult. Speciﬁ cally mentioned is the challenge of 
isolating trade secrets from foreign managers and employees, and U.S. ﬁ rms increasing 
practice of placing their research and development centers in foreign environs. The 
reality of this is that the theft of intellectual property will continue to be a thorn in 
the side of both industry and governments.
In 2006, the Defense Security Service upped the number of countries engaged in 
industrial espionage in the United States The UN has only 119 member states, so it 
would have been easier to simply note the 17 nations not involved.
The FBI estimates that more than 3,000 Chinese “front companies” operate in 
the U.S. with the express purpose of gathering intelligence and technology. Much of 

www.syngress.com
 
When State Entities Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 3 
43
this is “dual use,” with both civil and military uses. The FBI has stated publicly that 
the number of Chinese counterintelligence cases in Silicon Valley alone is increasing 
by 20 to 30 percent each year.
Can we in good conscience advocate a change in current U.S. policy, simply because 
other countries engage in such practices? Maintaining the current policy would seem to 
be the prudent course of action at this time, since it is one thing to ask our law enforcement 
and intelligence personnel and entities to take extraordinary risks to protect the nation 
from external threats (both physical and economical) and quite another to ask these 
same entities to take a similar level of risk to provide information that may help a speciﬁ c 
company’s bottom line. In the global marketplace, the free market economy should be 
the arbiter. Those with the best product, service, execution, and so on, will achieve the 
greatest ﬁ scal success and be the market victor.
According to a study published in late October 2005 by USA for Innovation, 
a nonproﬁ t organization dedicated to the protection of intellectual property (IP), the 
United States alone carried a value of US$5–5.5 trillion, equivalent to 45 percent of 
the United State’s GDP, far larger than the GDP of any other nation. In essence, the 
IP retained by companies in the United States is the heart of the economic security in 
the U.S. This study also indicates that there exists a direct correlation between the 
level of a nation state’s protection of foreign-owned IP and the level of foreign investment 
in that same country -- Where the state increases protection of the investor’s IP; 
investors increase their investment in the nation’s economy. In sum, U.S. corporations must 
take appropriate steps, on their own, to incorporate security procedures to effectively 
protect their IP against the efforts of foreign governments eager to obtain that same IP.

and Organized Crime 
Target a Business’s 
Intellectual Property

Chapter 4 • When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
Introduction
Previously, we discussed the vector posed by the “Insider and Competitor” and the 
“State Entity.” The greatest and most insidious threat to one’s Intellectual Property 
(IP), however, involves counterfeiting and piracy, and often times, these activities are 
sponsored by organized crime.
The threat to IP from backroom thieves who produce counterfeit and pirated 
products is absolutely the most pervasive threat to the global economy as a whole. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) estimates that counterfeiting and 
pirated products account for 5 to 7 percent of the global economy, costing the 
United States alone over 750,000 jobs, and socks U.S. industry for a loss of sales in 
the area of $250 billion. The Chamber has directed its efforts, via trade missions and 
educational programs, toward China, Brazil, South Korea, and Russia with the goal of 
encouraging enhanced enforcement of IP protection laws within. In addition, the 
Chamber on each of these countries offers an IP protection toolkit. In 2005–2007, 
the Chamber, working together with various law enforcement entities, not only 
initiated the STOP (Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy), but has continued to 
expand the footprint (www.uschamber.com/ncf/initiatives/counterfeiting.htm).
In most instances, the motive to pirate or counterfeit is simple: “economic 
greed”—to manufacture and sell goods without the overhead and costs incurred by 
the rightful owner of the IP. Thus, they are able to bring a product to market that 
is manufactured, marketed, and sold at a fraction of the cost borne by the original 
manufacturer. Innumerable examples exist; we offer a selection, across many industrial 
sectors. Additionally, given the infrastructure necessary, it is not surprising the most 
robust enterprises have ties to organized criminal networks.
It is not only the Chamber that recognizes the ties between piracy and counterfeiting 
and organized criminal elements. In the U.K., the “Alliance Against IP Theft” (Alliance) 
has produced a 40-page primer, “Proving the Connection – Links Between Intellectual 
Property Theft and Organised Crime,” on the issue, detailing the deleterious effect on the 
U.K. economy and the clear and unambiguous involvement of organized criminal 
elements. The primer’s case studies identiﬁ ed organizations with points of origin in 
Russia (maﬁ a), South Asia (multiple countries), China (triad organizations), and Ireland. 
All of which served as points of origin for either the ﬁ scal wherewithal to affect the 

www.syngress.com
 When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 4 
47
manufacture, distribution, and sale of pirated and counterfeit goods in the U.K., or the 
initial point of origin of the bogus goods. The Alliance puts the value of these illegal 
items at over £ 9 billion (www.allianceagainstiptheft.co.uk).
We took the liberty of reviewing the available data on intellectual property 
regimes which are, in our opinion, not up to par in the area of intellectual property 
protection, both with respect to the existence of laws and/or the ability or willingness 
to enforce those laws that do exist. Figure 4.1 was derived from available data found 
in the 2007 BASCAP (Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy) report, 
the 2007 BSA (British Software Association) Piracy data report, the U.S. Trade 
Representative’s 2007 301 report, and our own analysis. This chart identiﬁ es the ten 
lowest-rated countries with respect to a regime designed and enforced to protect 
intellectual property.
Figure 4.1 The 10 Lowest Ranked Countries with IP Regimes
Using much of the same data found in both the 2007 BASCAP and the 2007 
BSA Piracy data report, coupled with our own analysis, we have created our own 
read on those countries we believe have earned the honor of being the Top Five 
countries with an intellectual property protection and enforcement regime in place 
and in use (see Figure 4.2).

Chapter 4 • When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
According to the United Kingdom’s National Criminal Intelligence Service 
(NCIS), organized crime is deﬁ ned as:
■ Collaboration of a minimum of three people
■ Criminal activity which has, or is intended to be, continued over a 
prolonged period
■ The commission of serious criminal offenses which, taken as a whole, are of 
considerable importance
■ Being motivated by the pursuit of power or proﬁ t
■ Operations that are international, national, or regional
■ Crime using violence or intimidation
■ Criminal activity using commercial or business-like structures
■ Crime that engages in money laundering
■ Criminal activity that exerts an inﬂ uence upon politics, the media, public 
administration, judicial authorities, or the economy (www.allianceagainstiptheft.
co.uk/Proving-the-Connection.pdf; pages 12-23 of hard copy)
■ Software piracy
While software piracy costs the global economy ﬁ nancially, it also costs countries 
jobs, according to a study commissioned by the Business Software Alliance (BSA). 
Figure 4.2 The Top Five Countries with IP Regimes

The 2007 global study notes that in 2006, piracy rates in 13 countries had increase 
over the prior year. Leading the list are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and the rest of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), where it is estimated that between 
94 to 96 percent of all software purchased is a pirated copy. While the top 20 countries 
with a high rate of software piracy are comprised mostly of developing nations, the list 
also includes China with a rate of 82 percent, and Russia, which tails close behind at 
80 percent. By comparison, the United States has the lowest rate at 21 percent. The 
2006 study opines that a 10-point drop in piracy in the Asia-Paciﬁ c region alone would 
generate $135 billion worth of additional economic growth and create approximately 2 
million new jobs. The 2007 study of the 2006 piracy situation notes that losses from 
piracy rose by more than $5 billion, a 15 percent increase over 2005.
But enforcement remains an issue. Let’s look at a typical case of enforcement, in 
the Philippines where the manufacture and sale of pirated software is not uncommon. 
In October 2005 in Cebu City, two persons were arrested for IP rights violations—
the two were charged with attempting to sell pirated software, valued at approximately 
nine million Filipino pesos (US$160,000+). One of the individuals was identiﬁ ed as a 
U.S. citizen and the other a Filipino citizen. The pair is facing fines of between 
50,000 and 1.5 million Filipino pesos (approximately $900 to $25,000) and incarceration 
of one to nine years, if convicted. It should be noted that, according to the Filipino 
press, no individual has ever been convicted of software piracy in the Philippines. The 
ﬁ scal deterrent is minimal, though the incarceration may be sufﬁ cient to catch the 
attention of an individual contemplating entry into the criminal milieu; the track 
record of the legal process tends to negate these deterrents. It would appear that these 
are token arrests and enforcement efforts, and not directed at the large wholesale 
piracy efforts.
As the aforementioned study indicated, piracy of IP is a problem within Brazil and 
not a priority of the Brazilian government. To punctuate this fact, on the October 18, 
2005 ﬂ ight from Moscow to Brasilia, President Lula’s presidential aircraft showed a 
pirated DVD-version of Filhos de Francisco, a ﬁ lm released in Brazil in August 2005 and 
not yet available on DVD. This, coupled with Brazil’s declaration in mid-2005 to the 
pharmaceutical world, “cut your drug price or we’ll take your IP,” makes Brazil an 
interesting conundrum for companies contemplating doing business in this market.
The incongruous perspective presented to the international community needs 
addressing. Perhaps to adjust this perception, the Brazilian National Council to Combat 
Piracy and Intellectual Property Violations announced that between November 2004 and 
November 2005, Brazil has seized counterfeit and pirated goods valued at approximately 

www.syngress.com
50 
Chapter 4 • When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
US$87 million—a 130 percent increase over the amount seized in 2004. The Brazilian’s 
claim, “the main entryway for contraband is the Brazilian borders with Paraguay, in Foz do Iguaçu, 
in the state of Paraná.” Brazilian government ofﬁ cials claim that “barriers” set up in the 
region have reduced importation of counterfeit goods by approximately 60 percent. This 
would suggest that tightening a country’s borders may reduce the inﬂ ow of illicit goods 
and thus reduce the opportunity for the sale/purchase of pirated/counterfeit items.
Technology Counterfeiting
Counterfeiting isn’t limited to software. Take the example of the network gear 
manufacturer, D-Link. D-Link’s intellectual property was being successfully pirated/
counterfeited within the Indian market. In late August 2005, a number of D-Link 
products were found in New Delhi’s Nehru Place market area by Indian law 
enforcement ofﬁ cials from the Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI) (some of the 
seized products included Ethernet switches [model DS1016D and DES 1024D]). 
Interestingly, D-Link’s distributors in India have a remarkable degree of understanding 
as to why customers would willingly purchase fake products, as customer support is 
unimportant. According to Pankaj Surekha, proprietor of Surekha Compunet, a 
D-link distributor, “D-link has a very tiring and time-consuming replacement process, 
which at times distracts customers from the brand. Hence, the company should revise 
and minimize the replacement cycle to help customers retain long-lasting faith in 
the brand.”
Perspective oftentimes is determined by where you stand, and in this case, it would 
appear that the distributor is advocating a more streamlined process on the part of the 
manufacturer that may lead potential customers to make their buy-choice based on 
robust product support—something that is lacking when a pirated product is purchased.
Korea technology manufacturer Samsung has been victimized repeatedly. The 
crimes range from outright theft of their IP to the counterfeiting of their cutting-edge 
product lines. In November 2005, four current and former Samsung employees pilfered 
the blueprints and documents for a new mobile phone design and were caught by 
Korea’s National Intelligence Service (Korea’s Counterespionage organization), 
who discovered the group attempting to spirit the ﬁ les to China mobile phone 
manufacturers. Samsung notes that its investment in the design project was 25 billion 
RMB (approximately $25 million). Had the quartet been successful, Samsung may 
have taken a market hit of approximately 500 million RMB (US$500,000) in the 

www.syngress.com
 When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property • Chapter 4 
51
handset market, and it stood to lose almost 8.8 trillion RMB (approximately 
$8.8 billion) worth of intellectual property on their entire line of technology products 
which were included in the data trove. What company can withstand a ﬁ scal loss 
valued at over $8 billion due to their blueprints and documents being stolen?
Samsung has a “policy” in place that prohibits employees from sharing data 
outside the company or retaining or copying such data for personal retention. That 
said, one of the individuals arrested was discovered sharing approximately four 
gigabytes of computer ﬁ les. These ﬁ les included documents, blueprints, program source 
code, and circuit diagrams of mobile phones. This individual used multiple 
technological avenues to affect the transfer of data to his co-conspirators by using DVDs, 
e-mail, and wireless connectivity between laptops to successfully transfer the data 
outside of Samsung.
It begs the question, especially in this day and age of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 
enforcement, if this were a U.S. ﬁ rm, what liability would the corporate hierarchy 
hold for lax protection of their intellectual property? And which corporate ofﬁ cer 
would the shareholders hold liable?
Perhaps as interesting is the lamentable fact that in the United States the 
likelihood of this type of event being serendipitously discovered by U.S. governmental 
agencies is slim. This country’s own privacy laws prohibit random and pervasive 
monitoring of private communications.
It is just as interesting to note that the Korean NIS has the capability and exercises 
their counterespionage capability within the Economic Espionage milieu in support 
of Korea’s industrial base. A separate report from the Samsung Economic Research 
Institute on the topic of stolen Korean technologies indicates that 39 percent of all 
technology stolen from Korea is destined for China.
Korean manufacturers of mobile phones and other electronic devices such as 
MP3 players have noted that approximately 70 percent of the products manufactured 
by LG and Samsung available in the Chinese marketplace were counterfeit products. 
In their effort to thwart counterfeit activity, a Hong Kong–based company, 
Marksman Consultants Ltd., has conducted surveys and investigations, working 
closely with the Chinese law enforcement entities. According to Joseph Tsang, 
Chairman of Marksman, “One big problem: Too many scammers have ties to local 
ofﬁ cials, who see counterfeit operations as a major source of employment, and 
pillars of the local economy. Two or three of our raids have failed because of local 
protection.”

Chapter 4 • When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
The Apparel Industry
But piracy isn’t limited to the technology or software industries. The apparel industry 
is also victimized. Counterfeit shoes are commonplace in the open markets of 
Southeast Asia. Adidas, the German sports clothing conglomerate, recently ﬁ led a 
lawsuit against three separate Chinese companies for IP violations.
■ Aile Clothing and Shoe Company  Adidas alleges that Aile is using the 
three-stripe design on shoes manufactured by Aile, which violates Adidas’ 
three-stripe trademarked logo.
■ Beijng Jianlijia Aile Sports Good Shop  Adidas alleges that this ﬁ rm is 
selling goods that violate the Adidas trademark.
■ Beijing Ruiguan Sports Goods Company  Adidas alleges that this ﬁ rm 
is selling goods that violate the Adidas trademark.
Adidas requested three million RMB (approximately USD 370,000 in compensation) 
from the three companies for violating Adidas’ logo and trademarks.
The apparel and fashion goods industries are a ripe target as well. In early November 
2005, the Assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement in New England, along with the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Service, announced the arrest and indictment of four individuals charged with trafﬁ cking 
in more than USD 1.4 million worth of counterfeit goods. The ten-count indictment 
details how the four used 13 separate self-storage units within a storage facility located in 
Revere, MA as their base of operations (ten of the units were for storage, two were show 
rooms and one was the manufacturing facility). When raided, the units contained 12,231 
counterfeit handbags; 7,651 counterfeit wallets; 17,000+ generic handbags and wallets; 
and counterfeit labels and medallions in sufﬁ cient quantity to turn more than 50,000 
generic handbags and wallets into copies of the originals. The following trademarked 
brands were copied: Louis Vuitton, Kate Spade, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Burberry, Coach, and 
additional bags and wallets of other manufacturers. In addition, numerous other items were 
also contained in the storage units, including scarves, belts, umbrellas, sunglasses, dufﬂ e bags, 
hats, visors, garment bags, coats, shoes, necklaces, bracelets, rings, and earrings bearing 
counterfeit marks owned by these and other victim companies. The indictment places the 
value of the “counterfeit” goods at approximately USD 1.4 million, and USD 6.0 million 
had the goods been authentic.
The sales methodology used by this group of counterfeiters, according to the 
indictment, was to sell their items at ﬂ ea markets or “purse parties” in the Revere,

53
MA area. Indeed, it is alleged that they held more than 230 purse parties throughout 
Massachusetts. The goods they acquired were purchased from both legitimate generic 
goods manufacturers and illegal suppliers of goods in New York. According to ICE, 
“The public needs to know that when they buy a counterfeit purse at a house party or 
on the street, their dollars are ultimately helping to ﬁ nance large-scale counterfeiting 
organizations. And every time they buy a knock-off purse, they are contributing to 
legitimate companies losing billions of dollars in revenue to counterfeiting every year.”
In 2007, the government of Italy’s domestic intelligence service, SISDE (Servizio 
per le Informazioni e la Sicurezza Democratica, Italian for Service for Information and 
Democratic Security) accused Chinese hackers, apparently operating with the acquiescence 
of the government of China, of the wholesale theft of industrial methodologies 
associated with the apparel and fashion goods industry. While the Chinese government 
denied all allegations, the Italian government was adamant that the Chinese were 
purloining the intellectual property of the Italian ﬁ rms so as to enhance the production 
and bring the Chinese knock-offs closer to the quality of the real Italian merchandise. 
A news piece notes, how SISDE’s alarm has been echoed by reports from the China 
desk of Italy’s special anti-Maﬁ a investigative directorate.
The Entertainment Industry
Now we’ll discuss the pervasiveness of IP theft that occurs with artistic products produced 
by the entertainment industry. In late 2005, a judge in Hong Kong sentenced a Hong 
Kong resident, Chan Nai-ming, to three months in jail for the copy and distribution of 
three motion pictures via the Internet. Chan operated under the Internet alias “Big Crook” 
and apparently did not charge for the ﬁ lms that he availed to the internet community. 
Chan utilized the BitTorrent software program to conduct his Internet ﬁ le sharing. This 
case is the ﬁ rst that resulted in a jail sentence for the online piracy of motion pictures in 
Hong Kong. Hong Kong customs investigators determined that between 30 and 40 
individuals had accessed Chan’s computer to obtain illicit copies of the copyrighted materials. 
The fact that Chan did not charge for the ﬁ lms was not found to be material.
While in Sweden in mid-2005, it became illegal to share music and ﬁ lms over the 
Internet, the Swedish anti-piracy group Antipiratbyrån (APB) found itself being 
disciplined by the country’s Data Inspection Board for breaking privacy data rules in 
its hunt for illegal ﬁ le-sharers.
In their exuberance to locate and identify individuals who were sharing, illegally, 
music and ﬁ lm ﬁ les over the Internet, they hired a paid informant within the 
Swedish ISP Bahnof to provide the Internet protocol addresses of “ﬁ le shares” from 

www.syngress.com
54 
Chapter 4 • When Piracy, Counterfeiting, and Organized Crime Target a Business’s Intellectual Property
within the Swedish ISP’s network. The Data Inspection Board noted that an individual’s 
Internet protocol address is considered private; the manner in which the information 
was collected illegal. Subsequent to the discovery of a paid informant within Bahnof, 
the ISP ﬁ red two employees, including the paid informant for the APB.
In late-2005, again in Sweden, a judge sentenced Andreas Bawer, a Swedish 
citizen, to approximately USD 2,000 in civil penalties but no jail time for the illegal 
online distribution of a pirated motion picture. The court found that Bawer had 
violated Swedish copyright laws by making a Swedish movie available via the 
Internet for others to download. The software used by Bawer was not identiﬁ ed, and 
it is believed that Bawer had only copied one ﬁ lm and was not a large-scale provider 
of ﬁ lms via the Internet.
In mid-summer 2005, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) 
declared losses to the motion picture industry to be approximately US$1.9 billion, 
due to Internet-driven ﬁ lm piracy. The MPAA continued, detailing how the overall 
piracy of ﬁ lms in other formats was identiﬁ ed as being valued at approximately USD 
3.5 billion. One would expect that the MPAA would be in search of large wholesale 
pirates, but then the MPAA, on behalf of the major studios, ﬁ led 286 lawsuits against 
individuals whose names were provided by the 30 bit-torrent site operators that were 
shut down earlier in 2005.
These prosecutions, while totally appropriate, are truly small potatoes. Put 
differently, the prosecutions against “individuals” aren’t difﬁ cult, because the individual 
doesn’t have the ﬁ scal capabilities to compete with the MPAA or industry proper. 
It can be argued that it would be more appropriate for the MPAA to invest its 
investigative funds to identify those organizations with robust infrastructures that 
produce thousands of copies.
In closing, and as noted in the press release from the Business Action to Stop 
Piracy issued on the heels of the May 2007 Group of Eight (G8) conference, 
counterfeiting and piracy costs businesses to lose a total of over USD 600 billion 
to counterfeiters each year.
Juxtapose this against the October 2005 DOPIP Security Counterfeit Intelligence 
Report that noted more than 341 separate incidents involving goods valued at more 
than USD 1 billion, and involving more than 54 separate countries. Not surprisingly, the 
top ten brands counterfeited were Adidas, Nike, Louis Vuitton, Microsoft, Chanel, Gucci, 
Prada, Fendi, Manchester United, and Puma. The report also noted that there appears to 
be evidence of a link between copyright and trademark infringements and more serious 
crimes. The report, continued that in 37 percent of the cases, counterfeiters were found

to be involved in drug trafﬁ cking and use, 20 percent carry weapons, 11 percent commit 
other frauds, and 26 percent carry out other crimes such as assault, extortion, murder, 
theft, immigration violations, money laundering, identity theft, and robbery. Increasingly, 
a more violent type of criminal is being attracted to this activity as proﬁ t margins 
become larger, and penalties and chances of being arrested are relatively low 
(http://i-newswire.com/pr50468.html).
This vector is on a near vertical growth path, and until governments and industries 
unite in both reactive and proactive steps, the criminal elements will always have the 
upper hand and the loss of intellectual property will continue.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
Introduction
In the ﬁ rst four chapters, using real-world examples, we explored the diverse vectors, 
motivations, and modus operandi of those engaged in intellectual property theft and 
economic espionage.
In this chapter, we conduct a virtual roundtable to take a look at some of the 
twenty-ﬁ rst century challenges and opportunities that confront those who seek to 
thwart such activity. We believe their seemingly unique perspectives, focused on an 
identical mission, will be of great assistance to you, as you yourself wrestle with the 
situation wherein you are faced with a conundrum and think that perhaps you are 
the ﬁ rst to have had this experience. The perspective of the several subject matter experts 
in various aspects of law, security, risk, investigations, and intelligence participated in this 
virtual roundtable, they are:
■ Naomi Fine, Pro-Tec Data  Naomi Fine, Esq., President and CEO of 
Pro-Tec Data (www.pro-tecdata.com). Naomi is an internationally recognized 
expert on intellectual property theft and economic espionage. She incorporates 
legal, computer security, corporate security, human resource, and audit disciplines 
in her approach. Her depth of knowledge comes from working with hundreds of 
world-class companies to identify sensitive information, assess needs for 
protecting it, develop tailored strategies, establish policies and procedures, and 
provide training and tools that secure competitive advantage. Her clients have 
included many Fortune 500 companies, such as 3Com, Apple Computer, 
Caterpillar, Charles Schwab, Eastman Kodak, International Paper, Intel, Johnson & 
Johnson, Levi Strauss, MCI, McDonald’s, Michelin, Mobil Oil, National 
Semiconductor, Nortel Networks, PECO Energy, Procter & Gamble,

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
The Legal Perspective: Naomi Fine
Burgess and Power: From your perspective, as a legal expert on intellectual property theft and 
economic espionage, how has the theft of trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property 
changed over the last few decades? Is the means of attack less dependent on the insider than 
previously? Is it more oriented toward technological means of acquiring secrets than previously? 
Certainly, the impact of both globalization and the WWW has been signiﬁ cant. Have the 
players changed? Have the likely targets increased? What are the challenges of protecting 
intellectual property and trade secrets in the Global Economy and the Information Age? There 
is the need for executives to understand what information is at risk, and what information they 
should invest extra care in protecting. Our sense is that many more kinds of organizations and 
intellectual property are at risk than “conventional wisdom” would assume. There is a great deal 
of focus on the risk to corporate treasures like the formula for Coca-Cola, the programming code 
for Windows, and the designs for microprocessor and weapons systems. But little attention is 
paid to other forms of intellectual property in other industry segments. Could you talk a bit 
about how an organization should evaluate its exposure, i.e., what it has to lose and how it is 
vulnerable?
Naomi Fine: I was hired by McDonald’s a decade or so ago, and I thought, 
“Well, what have they got beside ‘Secret Sauce’ that would be considered conﬁ dential?” 
It was only after working with them that I learned how much of their information—e.g., 
their business strategy, their relationships with franchisees, how they developed their 
menu, how they decided which were going to be corporate stores and which were 
going to be franchise stores, their whole IT group and the kinds of technology they 
developed to enable the kinds of operations they have in their stores, even the 
delivery—was vital to the enterprise and therefore should be protected.
At the time that I worked with them, beanie baby doll products were very popular, and 
they were going to be giving some of them out at some of their stores. Which stores were 
going to have the giveaways and how many was a major secret. People would literally line 
up outside all night long. There were thefts in the area when they were giving them out. 
Those are some of the issues that companies in the low-tech environment might not be 
aware of. But even as I am telling you this, one of the things I am saying is that one of 
the aspects of their work that was conﬁ dential was the IT aspect, and there is not a single 
company in any industry that isn’t using information technology in one way or another 
to facilitate the operations if not the evolution of their products, so for that reason alone, 
what they are using and how they are using it to improve their competitive advantage is 
clearly conﬁ dential information for these companies.

www.syngress.com
 
Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage • Chapter 5 
61
After MacDonald’s came Levi-Strauss and Safeway. All of those low-tech companies 
basically said, ‘Hey, we recognize that how we recruit our employees, the materials 
we use in our products, the way that we hold our inventory, our yield results, our 
manufacturing processes, etc., all of those things, are highly conﬁ dential.
So I have found that most companies are fairly aware that they have conﬁ dential 
information (to protect).
The ﬁ rst level of awareness is “Do we have something that is conﬁ dential?” and 
most executives are aware that they have something that is worth protecting.
The next level of awareness is how widespread is the application of that principle 
within the company? In other words, “OK, we’re Coca-Cola, we know that 
Coca-Cola’s secret formula is conﬁ dential, but do we recognize that our recruiting 
process for employees or the way that we strategize about giving to communities 
around the world as a P.R. function are also conﬁ dential?”
The third level is recognizing the bits and pieces that go into understanding what is 
conﬁ dential? So, let’s take the example of strategy for using community service within 
the corporation to enhance P.R. What is the information that provides pieces to the 
puzzle that would allow an outsider to know what that strategy is? It is not just the 
document that says this is our P.R. strategy and in it is the sub-strategy on speciﬁ cally 
how we are going to use community service to improve our image, it is also a meeting 
between Coca-Cola and the Trust for Public Land, or the Nature Conservancy and the 
Sierra Club. An executive’s plan to go to Washington, D.C., to meet with a representative 
of the Sierra Club would be one of the pieces of information that could provide a 
piece of the puzzle that when put together would reveal the mosaic.
What’s interesting is that while company executives may not be aware of that layer 
of granularity, clearly the folks in the IT department have to grapple with the question, 
“Where should we be applying our IT security dollars?” They need to know at a 
granular level whether it is only the P.R. strategy, or is it also the Outlook calendars of 
the executives who are going to meet the people in the conservation movement.
Now there is another layer, which is the leading edge technology (e.g., content 
monitoring and ﬁ ltering technology), is only useful if you can identify words and 
phrases. So the question is not just, “Is the Outlook calendar a piece of the P.R. 
strategy, which is part of the overall information asset management inventory of the 
company?” but also, “What are the key words and phrases that we might ﬁ nd not 
only in an Outlook calendar but in an Excel spreadsheet, a Power Point document, 
or a database?” We need to identify those key words and phrases so that we can apply 
security technologies.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
Most companies in most industries recognize that they have got something that is 
conﬁ dential that they must protect. But how far have they taken it? To what level of 
granularity? Do they recognize both because of the competitive intelligence threat, 
i.e., there are some very smart people out there who are adept at taking little bits and 
pieces of information and putting them together to understand a company’s strategies? 
But has someone in the organization broken it down further: “There are all these 
technologies to stop our employees and contractors from sharing information that 
they shouldn’t share, what are we doing to apply them?” The response may come 
back as, “Well, we are looking at them, but in order to apply them, we have got to 
not only understand what our conﬁ dential information is, we have got to be able to 
break it down to keywords and phrases.”
Burgess and Power: What kind of legal strategy should an organization develop to deal 
with the threat of intellectual property theft and economic espionage? What are the key elements? 
How should this strategy be developed and implemented? What should the working relationship 
be between in-house legal counsels and/or outside expert counsels?
Naomi Fine: Intellectual property has been an issue, literally, for millennia. And 
there have been challenges to the protection of intellectual property, particularly in 
the form of the globalization of the workforce, and the advancements in technology, 
and the mobilization of both people and technology, which make that information 
more vulnerable. And although that has been evolving over the last decade, there isn’t 
anything that radically new, but one thing that has changed radically is the perception 
that private information is something that we need to protect. Suddenly, there is 
attention to our personal, private information.
There has been this wave of regulation that obligates companies to protect personal 
and private information. One of the fallouts of this change, which is also a beneﬁ t, is 
that now you have folks in the General Counsel’s ofﬁ ce who are saying, “We better 
understand the technical aspects of protecting intellectual property. We can no longer 
rely on a piece of paper that says Non-Disclosure Agreement at the top of it. We can 
no longer rely on those Power Point presentations that we are perfectly capable of 
giving. We need to marry these things with technologies that help to protect our 
information.” And conversely, the folks in the IT department who had previously 
said, “Bah humbug, those legal folks don’t know what the hell they are talking about. 
They do not know what a bit or a byte is. They don’t know the difference between 
source code and object code. We’re the ones that have got to secure the system, and 
let the legal people go ahead with their non-disclosure agreements and whatever else 
they do. We are here in the trenches doing the work of protecting this electronic

63
information,” have changed their tune, because suddenly there are these privacy 
regulations, we had better know what they are. They are using words like encryption. 
We’re the ones that have to implement it.
So there is camaraderie between the IT folks and the legal counsel folks that 
never existed before. The lawyers have a keen desire to understand the technology, 
and the technologists have a keen desire to understand the legal underpinnings to 
their implementation of the technical solutions.
However, one of the things that has not changed in terms of legal strategy when 
you look at the most recent legislation, e.g., CA 1386, which says if you have had any 
private data on any individual stolen, you have to report it, and there is another 
section that says you have to take reasonable measures to protect that information.
Burgess and Power: Yes, this is the crux. It is an absolute requirement if you expect to 
garner any protection with respect to stolen data. If you do not try and protect the data then 
you have no recourse when you lose the data. The California Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides 
protection for a broad category of sensitive business information. The Act provides both injunctive 
relief and damages for misappropriation of a trade secret. The Act deﬁ nes a “trade secret” as 
information—including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or 
process—that derives value from not being generally known and about which some effort has 
been made to keep the information secret. It is important for businesses to realize that the 
deﬁ nition requires them to take steps to keep the information secret; an employer may not claim 
misappropriation of a trade secret if there was no effort to treat the information as secret 
(http://w3.uchastings.edu/patent_01/Handouts/California%20Uniform%20Trade%20
Secrets%20Act.pdf).
Naomi Fine: But just as with the trade secret laws, we still don’t deﬁ ne what 
those reasonable measures are, and I hope we never get to a place where we do. I say 
I hope we never do because there is an evolving standard, and what was “reasonable” 
yesterday may no longer be “reasonable” tomorrow when, e.g., we get a new 
encryption standard or digital rights management becomes commonplace, or when 
content monitoring and ﬁ ltering technologies cannot only monitor and ﬁ lter for 
structured data, but can easily search out and capture the unstructured data.
There are some technologies that claim they can do that. Maybe they can, but 
when it becomes more of a standard instead of bleeding edge technology, then it also 
should become part of the standard for “reasonable measure to protect information.”
So, one of the things that is different is there needs to be this collaboration 
between the legal department and the IT department, but that being said, information, 
while most of it is developed at some point and stored at some point in electronic form, 

www.syngress.com
64 
Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
that is not the only form. Here we are having a conversation. Conversations can also 
divulge conﬁ dential information and open up a real risk. I am talking to you on my 
cell phone. My cell phone is also a PDA. It has lots of conﬁ dential information in it, 
so, it is not just the information systems at some corporate ofﬁ ce that need to be 
protected, but also all of these mobile endpoints.
And so the legal strategy has to take into account the people, the processes, the 
technologies, and the environment, so that you can really enable the people and all of 
the tools they use to transfer or exchange information and still protect it.
Law is basically a driver of obligation and redress. In terms of obligation, most of 
the laws effecting the protection of information still leave it up to taking reasonable 
precautions, and those reasonable precautions evolve. For example, in the Economic 
Espionage Act (EEA), the gold standard set for compliance, is drawn from guidelines 
that used to give us just ﬁ ve steps for compliance, but now the guidelines say very 
clearly we have to establish a culture of compliance, which means really making sure 
users who have the mind-set, as well as the skills, to protect information.
The human factor is always going to be the center piece of any legal strategy for 
protecting information, making sure that people who have access to information 
know which information is conﬁ dential, know what their responsibilities are to 
protect it, and have the tools and resources for doing that.
Burgess and Power: If the enterprise does not invest in an awareness program to make 
their employees knowledgeable of what data must be protected, then they are placing themselves 
in needless jeopardy. Next question, where are we now, a decade after the signing of the EEA in 
the US? How effective has it been? How has it evolved or devolved over the years? What do you 
recommend to your clients in regard to the EEA? Is compliance still an issue and an advantage? 
Has its overall inﬂ uence been positive? Has it been used for the best and to the best?
Naomi Fine: It is difﬁ cult to give you a clear answer to that question, because 
you ﬁ rst have to ask, “What is the expectation from a law like that?” My expectation 
is that it is a law that should be on the books. We have been prosecuting clear criminals 
as a result of it. It has had some impact. I remember, though, in 1997, delivering speeches 
called “The Grey Zone,” and asking, “With the EEA, are we going to have people 
who overhear a conversation on an airplane being criminally indicted?” The truth is 
it probably could lead to such an indictment. But we as a society and government do 
not have the money or resources to do that, so you know I think it has been effective. 
But only because my expectations were not higher than what has been achieved. 

www.syngress.com

Other people may have had higher or lower expectations. But look at other laws and 
how they have been implemented, and I would say it is doing its job.
The OpSec Perspective: Keith Rhodes
Burgess and Power: What impact do economic espionage and intellectual property theft have 
on the economic and national security of the USA? What is at risk? How high are the stakes? 
What are some of the indicators that we can see around us? Are whole sectors being gutted? 
Is our leadership in technology and scientiﬁ c research slipping away? How bad is it? And what 
direction is it all going? What is government’s role? What is it doing? What does it need to do? 
And is it just the USA that is targeted, or is the threat as dire for other developed economies, 
e.g., Japan and the EU?
Keith Rhodes: The thrust of your questions is very clear to me: What is the state 
of the world today relative to industrial espionage? Are there new threats and adversaries, 
and are there new vulnerabilities? What’s at risk? Who’s the “bad guy,” and how 
good is s/he? While it may seem that the world has changed due to technology, and, 
therefore, the threat has changed due to technology, I would argue that the threat is 
what it has always been, with the exception that it is broader and faster, more subtle 
and insidious, more non-linear.
As background, I want to explain that I use the classic operations security 
(OPSEC) risk model as the basis for all my risk analyses. In this model:
■ Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Impact.
■ The Threat = Adversary + Capability + Intent;
■ The Vulnerability = Opportunity, and the Impact = Asset Value.
In this model, the threat is always human, as the technology itself does not attack; 
there is always an operator.
Burgess and Power: Technology does not equal security.
Keith Rhodes: The vulnerability is both human and technological, as all processes 
utilize both people and technology. Finally, the impact is also both human and technological, 
in that humans deﬁ ne the losses even though the loss may be a physical asset. The 
problem with threat response is that I see organizations trying to factor human beings 
out of the risk equation, as though they were some kind of variable that can be 
replaced. This is folly. Human beings are absolutely necessary to all processes and 

www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
operations, and are the ﬁ rst and last line of security. Technology certainly can enhance 
the ability of human beings to secure their environment, but it cannot do it alone.
Every nation is at risk from every other nation. Every nation is being intellectually 
gutted. Some nations, like China, may seem to be on top now, but they, too, have a 
soft underbelly: rampant corruption and an absolute requirement for a blazing economy. 
China has to have a >10 percent economic growth, so they can support the old 
manufacturing sectors in the western provinces. This will be impossible to maintain. 
No nation is immune. Nations try to maintain some control over their interests, but 
it is becoming almost impossible, even for totalitarian regimes, to manage economies. 
Currencies and exports can be controlled to some degree, but the moment it impairs 
a domestic industrial sector, that sector will leave. Thus, governments both have and 
do not have power in the global economy; the governments are allowed to come 
along, so long as they do not interfere.
The old saying that there are friendly nations but no friendly intelligence services 
is still true. Their role has not changed; they collect everything they can, as the immediate 
value of the collection is not always understood. Collecting an opponent’s military 
capability requires collecting an opponent’s industrial capability. Figuring out the 
stability of an unfriendly regime requires understanding the regime’s economy. This 
also applies to allies, as on one day we may be partners and on the next day we may 
be competitors. In reality, we may be partners and competitors on the same day at 
the same time. This may seem to be a new world, but if one takes the time to read 
about world history, one quickly sees that alliances have always been ﬂ uid and that 
even during times of war, nations preserved their assets on neutral ground. Thus, the 
threat is now as it has been: internal and external. There is no guarantee that either 
threat will be clearly manifest, although the internal threat is usually the more complicated 
one to deﬁ ne and interdict. Clearly deﬁ ned lines of demarcation make an external 
threat intuitively obvious to the casual observer, but those opponents who stand right 
before us may be nearly invisible.
I think this is where the threat may have changed in degree but not in form. 
The insider has always been with us, but now it seems that the insider is much more 
pervasive and capricious a threat than before. Loyalty is not something I see much of 
anymore. I am no psychologist, but one does not have to think very hard about the 
causes for this loss of loyalty: Organizations buy and sell themselves without any 
care for employees; national interests no longer take care of the citizens; the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer, and the general populace becomes more and more 
detached and cynical. Expectations center on what one can do for him or her alone.

Guru Puja said that, “To cherish oneself only brings downfall.” It would seem that 
he was correct at least insofar as loyalty is concerned. It is hard to secure an environment 
in which there is no loyalty to a common cause. The word “loyalty” may sound rather 
anachronistic, but it is a stabilizing concept, and it does have to ﬂ ow in both directions. 
Without some sense of loyalty, all insiders can “turn” at any moment, but not necessarily 
in a malicious way. One may just quit one day, and walk out with the intellectual 
capital of a ﬁ rm rolling around in her/his head. Some will argue that this has always 
been the case, which we have always had to operate with the assumption that anyone 
can “turn” at any time. I would argue that today we have to assume that everyone can 
“turn” at any moment, and that is a more complicated threat scenario.
This does not just apply to the employees; rather, it extends to the boardroom. 
There have always been chief executives who have made foolish decisions that brought 
down their ﬁ rms. There is an old Tibetan story about a group of monkeys trying to 
get the moon out of a well, because their leader says that they must get the moon out 
of the well. The other monkeys see the moon, and link themselves together in order 
to reach it. The branch they are holding breaks, of course, and they all fall into the 
well. This is an example of the usual folly of the boardroom; they go headlong into 
disaster at the bidding of the “boss.” Today, however, someone from the inner circle is 
as likely to “turn” as is the lowest employee. The loyalty is not to the ﬁ rm, but to accretion 
of personal wealth and power. This also is true of the ﬁ rm’s loyalty to its country of origin. 
Firms are global, more global than nations, and they do not see themselves as beholding 
to any set of GPS coordinates. The adage, “Having drunk the country’s water, one 
should obey the country’s laws,” means nothing anymore. In reality, the adage would 
read today, “Drink as much as you can, as fast as you can, from as many sources as you 
can, and don’t get caught.” When the driver is money, free trade, microchips, and toaster 
ovens, then there is no room for compliance and loyalty.
Burgess and Power: The business life style of the twenty-ﬁ rst century road warrior, e.g., laptops, 
PDAs, wireless, VOIP, working on planes, etc. How has it changed the nature of attacks and 
countermeasures related to economic espionage and intellectual property theft? What opportunities 
has it opened up for the attacker? What speciﬁ c countermeasures and controls should be implemented?
Similarly, the paperless ofﬁ ce, telecommuting, corporate intranets, have all changed the 
information environment in profound ways. Secrets that were once on a mainframe or in a safe 
are now held on networked servers and accessed via remote workstations and even home computers.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
Keith Rhodes: Now we get to see this pervasive threat in an interconnected 
world. The phrase you use, “[t]he business life style of the twenty-ﬁ rst century road 
warrior,” is quite telling. Once upon a time, monarchs established guilds to maintain 
standards and to keep power centralized. This can be seen in the guilds for longbow 
archers in Europe or the Samurai in Japan. The “road warrior” is a very powerful 
individual and a very easy target. I was sitting on an airplane a while ago trying out 
a new laptop I had on loan from a computer company. They had, of course, given 
me a machine with everything on it. All I wanted to determine was the ergonomics 
of it, but the company had thought they could impress me with myriad gadgets. 
I booted up, and immediately the computer had every kind of wireless connection 
searching for a signal. I immediately started turning the functions off, when 
I noticed that the infrared connection was acquiring the computer next to me, and 
my computer was asking me if I wanted to mount their drive to my system. 
I turned off the device, but thought that it was very interesting that the person next 
to me hadn’t noticed that my machine was trying to ultimately hijack his computer. 
I wondered what he did for a living, so I could judge his risk, and found out that he 
was the European Marketing Director for a large industrial ﬁ rm. I also saw that he 
had drafts of the 5- and 10-year strategic plans for the company on his computer. 
I thought to myself, can security knowledge really be that bad? The answer, of 
course, was (and still is), “Yes.”
Burgess and Power: Yes, we challenge the reader at their next conference to turn on the 
∗blue tooth∗ and see how many shares are available. One of us did this at an INFOSEC 
conference and of the 100+ individuals, there were over 40 shares available to me! These are 
the “watchers,” the lack of general education on how data can be transferred from your laptop, 
PDA, etc., to any other device. Most people focus on getting data in, hardly any focus on how 
data is exﬁ ltrated.
Keith Rhodes: Thus, if I were to attack an opponent from an industrial espionage/
intellectual property perspective, I would use all the tools available to me, both logical 
and physical. I would “case the joint,” as it were, both wired and wireless, by sweeping 
the airwaves and by walking around. I will seek the path of least resistance. Why should 
I spend time trying to break in through a fortiﬁ ed Web site if I can lie my way into a 
building by dressing up as a HVAC worker? Likewise, why should I expose myself to 
physical harm, if the Web site if easily captured?
Burgess and Power: What are the elements of a comprehensive protection program focused 
on the issues of intellectual property theft and economic espionage?

Keith Rhodes: The next logical question is to ask, “How do we establish counter 
this?” I go back to my OPSEC training. There are ﬁ ve steps:
1. Identiﬁ cation of critical information
2. Analysis of threats
3. Analysis of vulnerabilities
4. Assessment of risks
5. Application of appropriate countermeasures
The ﬁ rst step is always the hardest, because the organization has to decide what 
is and what is not important. This cannot be outsourced to a contractor. This is an 
internal discussion that begins with the question, “What do we do for a living?”
It may seem a silly question to ask, but in my experience, it is the most difﬁ cult 
one for any organization to answer. It is easy to regurgitate a corporate vision 
statement or organizational charter, but to put those usually vague words into 
concrete examples and actions is very hard.
The second step is also difﬁ cult, as it is asking, “Who is our adversary?” To answer 
honestly, the organization has to see itself as its worst enemy, as it may leak more 
information to an opponent than the opponent could ever hope to steal. Think of 
the earlier scenario on the plane. What is the value of a 5- or 10-year strategic plan? 
I can’t say for certain, but I would think it is very important.
Then one moves to steps three and four, where discussions of giving workers 
constant access has to be balanced against security. In my experience, these discussions 
do not take place, as the “always on” requirement overrides security concerns every 
time, as “always on” is synonymous with “always making money.” It should be synonymous 
with “always transmitting,” but that is an opaque idea to a boardroom. A chief executive 
may have bodyguards and armored cars, but the “always on” PDA does not. Thus, in 
that scenario, I would just drive behind the car stealing the ideas directly off the wireless 
device. When last I checked, corporate security vehicles usually included blast resistance, 
but not signal insulation.
Notice in the above ﬁ ve steps that the application of countermeasures is the last 
item, that there is a lot of thinking that needs to occur before a solution is chosen. 
I would argue that the solution is mostly in education. People have to be educated that 
they are assets to be acquired, that they are targets, that there is a threat, and that they 
are the key to the solution.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
There is, of course, technology, but there is also common sense. Many young new 
employees do not even realize that they live in ubiquity. They are, indeed, power 
users, but they do not necessarily understand how their technology works.
That is part of the education. They need to be shown the opponent’s ability.
Technologically savvy users are usually surprised to see what can be done 
remotely to their computers. Also, employees need to understand the corporate 
policies regarding their role in securing the corporate assets.
“Appropriate use” is a phrase that is heard often these days, but is not clearly 
understood by employees. When I ask employees at organizations what “appropriate 
use” means, they usually reply, “No porn.” That’s part of the answer, but not the whole 
answer. Going to disapproved sites is an important rule, but how and when and to whom 
one can send corporate information is also important. I am less worried about people 
reading the on-line newspapers than about them text-messaging colleagues about 
password changes or corporate acquisition decisions. Likewise, I am less worried about 
what stays in the building than about what leaves the building with the employees 
every night. A briefcase full of documents is very important, but I need to actually 
physically steal them. A leaking PDA is no problem at all for an adversary.
Burgess and Power: In addition, how many companies ask their employees, “Do you 
cohabitate with a competitor’s employee?” If so, does your enterprise give these employees additional 
awareness and sensitivity training to better protect their inadvertent loss of the enterprise’s data? 
Does the enterprise have a work-from-home policy and does this policy include how you may leave 
your computer at home when you are not present? Perhaps you must have the computer locked, 
encrypted, etc. Do you use ﬁ rewalls? VPN into enterprise? If you have a roommate or spouse 
employed by a competitor, what is the expectation? Most will say none. There is a general Code of 
Business Conduct that addresses the need to protect corporate data, but no examples of what might 
be innocent, inadvertent damaging disclosure.
The Professional 
Investigator’s Perspective: Ed Stroz
Burgess and Power: From your perspective, as a professional investigator, how has the theft of 
trade secrets changed over the last few decades? Is the means of attack less dependent on the insider 
than previously? Is it more oriented toward technological means of acquiring secrets than previously? 
Certainly, the impact of both globalization and the WWW has been signiﬁ cant. Have the players 
changed? Have the likely targets increased? What are the challenges of conducting such an 
investigation in the Global Economy and the Information Age?

Ed Stroz: Decades are relatively long periods of time. In the 1980s and earlier, trade 
secrets were much more likely to be stolen or passed on a paper medium. Today, virtually 
all trade secret information is digital, and handled in the form of a computer ﬁ le, even if 
that ﬁ le is capable of being printed. Because digital ﬁ les can be accessed remotely, and 
copied rather than being “taken” in a way that shows them missing from where they had 
been, a thief doesn’t have to have an insider with physical access. This is a big difference 
from trying to steal a paper document that is inside a person’s desk. Clearly, using 
technological means is the more prevalent and likely method of accessing and stealing 
trade secrets. This also takes us to the point that the players have changed. Companies in 
the US have more ways of protecting trade secrets, based on federal laws passed in the 
1990s and later. So companies operating in the US are “players” in the sense that they 
are likely to be targets and victims, but they also have protections available to them that 
allow them to hit back under the law, if they have their act together technically and legally.
Burgess and Power: Bank robbers rob banks as that is where the money is. IP thieves 
operate around the globe, but operate in the US largely due to the fact that this is where there is 
an abundance of ∗new∗ IP.
Ed Stroz: As for the “players” who are bad guys, yes, I would say that has changed 
too. It is much more likely now for employees who jump to a new employer to be 
tempted to take computerized ﬁ les with them from their old employer. Often, their 
former employer considers these ﬁ les trade secrets. So, many domestic players who 
don’t ﬁ t the proﬁ le of a “spy” can wind up stealing trade secrets. In addition, you 
have computer networks being massively compromised by computers with connections 
originating overseas, often undetected for long periods of time. It is often difﬁ cult or 
impossible to know whether the apparent overseas origination point is a pass-through 
location, or the true point of origin. Whatever the answer to that question is, this type 
of activity is growing. The challenge to our global economy is how do we resolve 
such indications of an overseas penetration when there is no worldwide body of law 
or law enforcement either in place at all, or that can work quickly enough to be 
effective? While there certainly has been progress in this area, it is patchy and often 
slow in its effectiveness.
Burgess and Power: There is the need for executives to understand what information is at 
risk, and what information they should invest extra care in protecting. There is also a vital mix 
of cyber security, physical security, and personnel security issues. Could you talk about some of 
the proactive and preventative controls and countermeasures that organizations can take to 
mitigate the risk of intellectual property theft and economic espionage that strike you as the 
most important or effective?

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
Ed Stroz: Some of this is quite simple. For example, intellectual property (IP) that 
constitutes a “trade secret” has to be recognized, and treated as such, by the company 
that owns it. It’s not enough for an executive to think that anything he doesn’t want 
someone else to know about his business is a trade secret and will be honored as being 
one in court. It must be protected in a way that will stand up in court. This is why it 
is vital to involve legal counsel early and regularly, to determine whether to claim resolutions 
and protections if a trade secret has been compromised. Besides knowing which IP is a 
trade secret, as a matter of law, it will have to be treated and protected as a secret. This 
means protecting the information and the media on which it is stored. Protection 
includes physical security, information security, and through proper policies and procedures. 
This has caused companies to make increasing use of background checks with regular 
updates, including some contractor personnel. It also means more companies are focusing 
on the data inside their computer networks, and where it is going, rather than on 
looking for intruders coming in through the perimeter of their network. While intrusion 
detection is still important, extrusion protection gets much more attention now than 
in the past.
Burgess and Power: One could argue that today it is as important to monitor what is 
leaving the company as what is trying to get into the company. Perhaps more so.
Ed Stroz: There is also more awareness of the need to monitor e-mail and 
other forms of electronic communication in order to detect disgruntlement or other 
precursors to trade secret compromise. The most important part of managing this risk, 
in my opinion, is to utilize a threat matrix that categorizes those people who are in 
the position to do the most harm due to their access levels and technological prowess. 
The higher a person is on that scale, the more monitoring that should be considered. 
I believe that insights from behavioral science are not used enough in screening for 
problem situations in advance so that you have a chance to intervene and defuse 
before an actual compromise happens. It’s good to keep in mind that all criminal 
activity is about human behavior, not the behavior of computers.
Burgess and Power: Technology does not equal Security and behind every piece of technology 
designed to compromise your data is an individual with motivation. What are some of the mistakes 
and oversights in terms of personnel security, e.g., background checks, etc., that expose organizations 
to insider initiated intellectual property theft and economic espionage?
Ed Stroz: The ﬁ rst mistake is not doing a background investigation of adequate 
depth on the person to be hired. This means doing a little more than just a credit and 
arrest check. It means checking employment references and looking for on-line data 
by people experienced with background checks. For some serious positions, including 

www.syngress.com
 
Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage • Chapter 5 
73
staff positions with signiﬁ cant access to critical information, more work is necessary 
than for someone who is ﬁ lling a less critical role. Secondly, I think it’s a mistake not 
to monitor to some degree the e-mail and network activity of critical insiders while 
they are at work. It should be part of a policy that is disclosed to employees as they are 
hired. Some companies are concerned that this could be prying into people’s private 
communications, but it needn’t be that at all if the employee is notiﬁ ed properly. Also, 
in some instances such monitoring ﬁ nds that employees are spying on other employees! 
It’s not helping anyone’s privacy to be blind to that kind of activity. Today, it is possible 
to monitor employee behavior using charts and graphs without going all the way down 
into actually reading employee e-mail unless that is justiﬁ ed and necessary. This kind 
of “controllable drill-down” strikes a nice balance between the equally problematic 
extremes of “willful blindness” on the one hand to “big brother” on the other.
Burgess and Power: Just as the overall space has changed over the last few decades, 
i.e., the WWW, globalization, etc., so has the nature of the insider. Determining who is an 
insider and who is an outsider is problematic in this era of outsourcing, contracting, etc. Talk 
about the problems that arise in this environment?
Ed Stroz: That’s a good point. They used to consider insiders as those functioning 
inside the “perimeter” of a computer network, but that deﬁ nition was not always 
adequate. Today I would say companies have to keep clear records about who is 
“authorized” to access certain data and for what purpose(s). Those records include 
written and signed employment agreements, contractor agreements, and contracts 
with outsourced entities that might have possession of trade secrets. An insider might 
best be deﬁ ned as anyone who is authorized to have access, even if it is only the 
access to possess your intellectual property. By deﬁ ning terms clearly, you are more 
likely to think about your IP correctly and manage it by asking better questions. For 
example, shouldn’t the attorneys at your law ﬁ rm be considered an insider?
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes that insiders engaged in intellectual 
property theft and economic espionage typically make that lead to their detection?
Ed Stroz: The mistake is to believe that tracks can be completely wiped away. 
This is rarely true. In my experience at the FBI, the more sophisticated white collar 
criminals understood that evidence may be left behind anywhere they operated. 
Amateurs tend to think they know it all. Today, there is an enormous amount of 
computer data generated by our business activities, innocent or otherwise. Computers 
store information that the users don’t see about the actions they take. For example, 
if an employee plugs in a thumb drive into their work computer and then copies trade 
secret information onto it, there will be information within that computer about 

www.syngress.com
74 
Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
those actions. However, the employee may not know that, but mistakenly believe that 
such evidence doesn’t exist.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes and oversights in terms of cyber 
security that expose organizations to outsider-initiated intellectual property theft and economic 
espionage?
Ed Stroz: The failure to document that “insiders” (as deﬁ ned above) have been 
informed what they are authorized, and not authorized, to do with their access privileges 
to intellectual property. Without clear knowledge of what the employer forbids, it will 
be difﬁ cult to establish requisite “intent” to violate company policy, and that would 
make it difﬁ cult or impossible to address in a court of law later. We also see that many 
organizations do not adequately log and monitor the access to intellectual property. 
Then, if an incident arises in which intellectual property is suspected of having been 
compromised, it becomes difﬁ cult or impossible to prove who did, or did not, have 
access to it. Such failure to keep adequate records can also cause innocent parties to be 
cast into suspicion if the records do not prove they did not access critical information.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes and oversights in terms of physical 
security that expose organizations to outsider-initiated intellectual property theft and economic 
espionage?
Ed Stroz: Physical security requires that people be held accountable for their 
actions, movements, and access to property. This includes all people who enter buildings 
or log onto networks. It also means that hardware capable of storing intellectual property 
has to be controlled. Today, cell phones and cameras can take pictures of documents, and 
can be activated to record conversations. A conscious decision has to be made where 
these devices may and may not be carried into the workplace. Also, some companies 
outsource their IT to such an extent that they even lease their laptops. If a computer 
breaks, or for some reason needs to be returned to the vendor, it’s important to know what 
is happening to the data on the hard drive of the device before it leaves the building. It’s 
often a good idea to have it wiped before it leaves. I’d also like to point out that having a 
good topography of a company’s computer system is often important in mapping out 
the devices and connections that make up a computer network. Topographies, both 
logical and physical, are often neglected in companies that are then in the position of 
having to show how careful they were with their trade secrets.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes that outsiders engaged in intellectual 
property theft and economic espionage typically make that lead to their detection?
Ed Stroz: There are parallels to the points made above about insiders. However, 
outsiders are less worried about getting caught if they take steps to “launder” their 

www.syngress.com
 
Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage • Chapter 5 
75
access through overseas territories. That is, an outsider isn’t worried about being ﬁ red 
if caught.
Burgess and Power: Could you give us an overview of what you do when you are 
brought in by an organization concerned over incidents or suspicion of intellectual property theft 
or economic espionage? Where do you begin? What are the stages of an investigation? What are 
the biggest obstacles? How much does the success of an investigation of this sort depend on how 
well organized and implemented the organization’s security is up front?
Ed Stroz: We start by listening carefully to our client and the facts behind 
what caused them to contact us. The ﬁ rst phase is concerned with gaining a complete 
understanding of the facts and circumstances relevant to the client’s problem. We 
establish what role outside legal counsel is, or may, play in the problem. I like to have 
an organization chart of the company and a topology of its computer network for 
reference. As part of the ﬁ rst phase, we are also trying to think of what law(s) might 
have been violated, so that we can identify the elements of that statute and use those 
elements to guide our investigation. Phase two is usually one in which we preserve 
the evidence that needs to be gathered. This may involve mirror-imaging computers 
in a forensically sound way, storing backup tapes and computer media, deciding whether 
routine practices like de-fragmentation routines and overwriting of backup tapes needs 
to be suspended, and interviews of key personnel. Speed is often important. The success 
and efﬁ ciency of our efforts is heavily dependent on how well organized our client’s 
operations are.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the issues involved in forensic evidence, both cyber 
and physical? How could an organization better prepare itself for the gathering and preservation 
of such evidence? What are some of the technological and legal challenges involved?
Ed Stroz: It may be helpful to think of the handling of forensic evidence in these 
categories: identifying it; preserving it; and analyzing it. Issues can arise at all three levels. 
With digital intellectual property, it is easy to miss all the locations where it may be 
stored, that is to make errors in identifying the presence of this forensic evidence. For 
example, are you thinking of e-mail correspondence as existing only on the mail server? 
If so, you haven’t identiﬁ ed the forensic evidence from browser-based e-mails, like Yahoo, 
that may only show themselves on the hard drive of the user, not in the mail server data. 
Preserving that evidence is also tricky. It requires start-to-ﬁ nish care with a forensically 
sound chain-of-custody procedure. Sometime we face situations in which a client has 
already rummaged around in a computer suspected of being used in an intellectual 
property breach. The action of looking through the computer destroys valuable evidence 
and contaminates what otherwise could have been preserved. The last category, analysis, 

www.syngress.com
76 
Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
is the most sophisticated and is the hardest to discuss in general terms. This is where 
we actually examine, using forensic software, the actions taken by people with the 
intellectual property. The analysis steps are affected by many factors, including the age 
and size of the computer, the operating system, ﬁ le system, and the way it was set up 
by the IT staff. But the analysis is very dependent on having a forensically preserved 
mirror-image of the data. As for advice, I would recommend that companies use 
someone with expertise in forensics when conducting an investigation. Whether they 
have expertise in-house or use an outside ﬁ rm, it is not for amateurs.
Burgess and Power: We concur 100 percent. And make this forensic expertise in-house 
completely. You don’t want an NDA as your only line of defense should your most sensitive 
data be revealed by the contract forensic investigator – you ﬁ re him, you seek damages – but 
what about the other damages – investigation revealed, investigation compromised, chaos at 
every level? You have directed investigations both for government and in the private sector. From 
your wealth of experience, what do you advise organizations to do? What are the pros and 
cons? Should they turn to law enforcement? Under what circumstances should they? And at 
what point in an internal investigation should they?
Ed Stroz: Listen to the advice provided in answers to the earlier questions. In a 
nutshell, it is intellectual property (IP) that will drive the value of most companies, and 
that IP has to be handled properly if you are to realize its value. That means it has 
to be treated properly if you ever have to investigate whether it has been stolen or 
compromised in some way, and then to pursue your rights under the law. The law 
enforcement card is a very important part of the solution. Even if a company thinks 
that it does not want or need law enforcement help, those decisions often change. Law 
enforcement authorities have powers to take actions, such as executing search warrants 
that cannot be done under civil law procedures. However, a company seeking law 
enforcement assistance needs to have its facts together and to have handled their 
matter properly.
Burgess and Power: Law enforcement entities will gladly share the level of detail required 
to engage them effectively, i.e., how to prepare for the engagement. The enterprise must keep in 
mind, once you bring law enforcement into the equation, you may not be pleased with the direction 
the investigation now takes, as YOU no longer control the investigation. Law enforcement will 
drive the investigation as their goal is prosecution, not necessarily reputation preservation.
Ed Stroz: Sometimes there aren’t good reasons to go law enforcement; sometimes 
there are good reasons for doing so. As to when that decision needs to be made, it varies. 
However, you do not want to contact them half-cocked or without having done a 
reasonable amount of homework.

Burgess and Power: There are insiders and outsiders. There are professionals and amateurs. 
There are governments and corporate competitors. What would you say about the array of bad 
actors in the space of intellectual property theft and economic espionage? Do you have any thoughts 
on regions of the world or particular types of criminal enterprises? Are there an increasing 
number of third parties involved, i.e., information brokers? People who will steal secrets and 
then sell them to competitors, or be covertly contracted to do this work on spec? What is your 
analysis of the latest intelligence?
Ed Stroz: I don’t have a good answer on this, beyond what I’ve already said. 
It’s a very big question. Most of the intellectual property violations that we have seen, 
and that are actionable, involve insider activity.
Burgess and Power: How do theft of proprietary information and economic espionage 
investigations differ from other types of corporate investigations? How would you characterize the 
differences? Are there more sophisticated technologies utilized in these attacks? Are the adversaries 
more professionals? Is it more difﬁ cult to detect, identify, and track down? Are investigations 
typically longer and more extensive? The stakes are certainly higher? Your answer of course 
probably varies for disloyal insider versus professional outsider attacks. Give us a sense of how 
these types of investigations distinguish themselves?
Ed Stroz: These are a subset of white-collar crime. They tend to be motivated by 
ﬁ nancial greed, involve deception or hidden actions, and are non-violent. This means 
that the investigation cannot count on a confession from the guilty party, if there is 
one. However, a confession is much more likely to be elicited from a guilty person if 
they are confronted with documentary evidence of the actions they took that are at 
the heart of the problem. Often, it is only after showing the person these documents 
that they confess. These investigations tend to require more time, resources, and 
cunning than the investigation of physical property crimes or crimes of violence.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
James Christy: There is absolutely no measure of the loss for many reasons. Economic 
espionage and intellectual property theft is usually covered up for many good and 
cogent reasons by the private sector victims. I have seen entire corporate networks of 
over 100,000 systems completely compromised and hundreds of thousands of ﬁ les 
ex-ﬁ ltrated. The only reason the government knows about it is because much of the 
information compromised and exﬁ ltrated was government data and the companies 
couldn’t stop the hemorrhaging on their own. Evidence today is only antidotal because 
the private sector doesn’t report losses or compromises if in fact they even know 
about them.
Burgess and Power: The business life style of the twenty-first century road warrior, 
e.g., laptops, PDAs, wireless, VOIP, working on planes, etc. How has it changed the nature of 
attacks and countermeasures related to economic espionage and intellectual property theft? What 
opportunities has it opened up for the attacker? What speciﬁ c countermeasures and controls 
should be implemented?
James Christy: Due to the power and the capacities of portable and wireless 
devices today, when there is a loss or compromise, you could lose everything. So the 
possibility of a catastrophic loss is far greater since these devices are being employed 
by more and more employees and the capacities are far greater. Couple in with non-secure 
wireless communication between these devices and the mother ship, the potential is 
more devastating.
Burgess and Power: Similarly, the paperless ofﬁ ce, telecommuting, corporate intranets, have 
all changed the information environment in profound ways. Secrets that were once on a mainframe 
or in a safe are now held on networked servers and accessed via remote workstations and even 
home computers, etc. How has it changed the nature of attacks and countermeasures related to 
economic espionage and intellectual property theft? What opportunities has it opened up for the 
attacker? What speciﬁ c countermeasures and controls should be implemented?
James Christy: In the old days, information deemed not to be too sensitive was 
stored in ﬁ le cabinets in an ofﬁ ce, in a locked building. Today, all of this information 
is now stored online and accessible. If a single document in one ﬁ le cabinet, in one 
particular ofﬁ ce was compromised, it didn’t have an impact. Today, thieves can now 
access all of the ﬁ le cabinets in multiple ofﬁ ces, in multiple buildings, in multiple 
physical localities, and aggregate the information, compromising entire projects. Each 
individual piece of information, if compromised, wouldn’t have an impact, but putting 
all of the disparate pieces together can.
Burgess and Power: Yes, you need to defend 360 degrees and 24×7, but your adversary 
only needs to be right once. If you were to conduct a penetration test that emphasized attacks

related to economic espionage and intellectual property theft in this twenty-ﬁ rst century information 
environment, what would be some of the ways you would go after the client’s secrets? What 
would be some of the traditional ways, related to physical security, etc. (e.g., dumpster diving) 
which are still relevant? What would be some of the more cutting edge ways, related to recent 
technological advances (e.g., war-driving)?
James Christy: All of the old techniques still work as well as they ever have. Social 
engineering is the easiest and least risky. Employees are generally unwilling to challenge 
strangers and are usually eager to brag about what they do. Most are naïve that they 
would even be a target and most are very trusting. I went to the building manager of a very 
well-known DoD facility and gave them a business card and said that I was performing 
a vulnerability study for a requesting DoD agency that processed highly classiﬁ ed 
information. I told the building manager that we ran the assessment in two phases: 
a covert phase for a week, and an overt phase for two weeks. All of that was true, but 
the building manager didn’t ask for credentials and didn’t call anyone to check out 
my claim. I told the building manger that I wanted to observe the employees of this 
organization in their day-to-day operations. I asked if there was a way to get into the 
facility as a janitor. He wanted to help so bad that he offered me two building maintenance 
uniforms, equipment to measure air ﬂ ow from the HVAC, a light meter, and an industrial 
thermometer. He then wrote a backstopping letter that said we were doing an 
environmental study and that we didn’t have any clearances. He then put a closing 
paragraph that told the reader that if they had any questions to call him directly. 
All based on a business card.
My partner and I donned the maintenance uniforms and showed up at the facility 
during lunch. I told my partner that once we entered the facility, he should go in 
one direction and I would go in the opposite direction and steal top secret material 
out of the burn bags, because those documents wouldn’t be missed. The escort 
should make us stay together. We hit the buzzer and the loan person left in this 
10-person facility let us in. We explained what we were doing and gave him a copy of 
the backstopping letter from the building manager. We told him we would be there 
for a couple of hours. He suggested we work out of a vacant cube they had that was 
behind a partition. My partner then went one way and I went the other. The escort 
didn’t want to challenge us so he walked down the hall and spent 2 to 3 minutes 
with my partner and then walked down and spent a couple of minutes with me. 
Whichever one of us who wasn’t being watched was pilfering the top secret trash 
from the burn bags, putting it in our clipboards until we had a chance to go back to 
our cube and unload in it in our toolbox.

Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
When the rest of the crew came back from lunch, they ﬁ red up their classiﬁ ed 
computers. One put on a set of headphones and started working on a secret document, 
while I stood behind him writing down the classiﬁ ed information while my partner 
distracted his ofﬁ ce mate.
It all goes back to human nature. People don’t want to be jerks and 
challenge others.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the issues involved in forensic evidence, both cyber 
and physical? How could an organization better prepare itself for the gathering and preservation 
of such evidence? What are some of the technological and legal challenges involved?
James Christy: We all know digital media and devices are becoming increasing 
prevalent in our world. Beyond personal computers, laptops, cell phones, PDA’s, digital 
music players, ﬂ ash media, game consoles, CDs, and DVDs are a part of everyday life.
I don’t have to tell you that such items are commonly being found to have direct 
relevance in criminal cases. And, it is clear that the rising trend in the amount and 
importance of digital evidence in counterintelligence and law enforcement operations 
will not abate soon.
I believe it is vitally important that we increase the dialogue between law 
enforcement personnel confronted with digital evidence issues and digital forensic 
examiners skilled in the art of extracting information from digital media and devices.
Digital media is extremely susceptible to environmental conditions. Data modiﬁ cation 
or loss can result from exposure to such elements as heat, humidity, dust, or 
electromagnetic waves.
This potential change in or loss of information is a vitally important issue that 
can have a direct impact on the outcome of a case.
Digital evidence deterioration will have a signiﬁ cant effect on the ability of the 
forensic examiner to extract information and obtain matching hash values that verify 
the accuracy of a copied image.
Federal and military rules of evidence require that evidence introduced at trial be 
in the same condition as when it was seized. Although there are legal ways to admit 
damaged evidence at trial, the perceptions of the judge and jury could complicate the 
prosecutor’s case. Additionally, the defense may be prompted to claim incompetence, 
negligence, tampering, or assert that the lost evidence proved the defendant’s 
innocence.
Following correct handling procedures and maintaining proper evidence room 
conditions are the most effective means to protect digital evidence from adverse 
environmental factors. Some best practices include:

81
■ Preserve digital evidence in anti-static bags.
■ Protect digital devices from extreme environmental conditions during transport 
to storage facilities.
■ Inspect evidence room conditions for heat, humidity, and cleanliness.
■ When poor evidence room conditions cannot be corrected, consult with 
superiors and the legal ofﬁ ce on a separate storage location for digital media 
and devices.
■ Best practices related to digital forensics tools and techniques, investigative 
procedures, and evidence acquisition, handling, and preservation.
The Security and Privacy 
Consultant’s Perspective: Rebecca Herold
Burgess and Power: The business life style of the twenty-ﬁ rst century road warrior, e.g., laptops, 
PDAs, wireless, VOIP, working on planes, etc. How has it changed the nature of attacks and 
countermeasures related to economic espionage and intellectual property theft? What opportunities has 
it opened up for the attacker? What speciﬁ c countermeasures and controls should be implemented?
Herold: New methods of social engineering can now occur via P2P methods, 
such as instant messaging, and now that personally identiﬁ able information (PII) is 
more portable there are more ways in which cyber crime can occur.
Burgess and Power: Similarly, the paperless ofﬁ ce, telecommuting, corporate intranets, have 
all changed the information environment in profound ways. Secrets that were once on a 
mainframe or in a safe are now held on networked servers and accessed via remote workstations 
and even home computers, etc. How has it changed the nature of attacks and countermeasures 
related to economic espionage and intellectual property theft? What opportunities has it opened 
up for the attacker? What speciﬁ c countermeasures and controls should be implemented?
Herold: Opportunities now exist via multiple social engineering vectors, such as 
phishing attacks, bogus Web sites, and similar methods, along with opportunities 
arising from the carelessness of businesses when they retire computers and do not 
remove the information from the hard drives. There has also been an increased move 
to regain money on computer investments by selling old computers, which again has 
resulted in some signiﬁ cant and embarrassing privacy incidents and cyber crime.
Burgess and Power: What is the role of awareness and education in a protection program 
focused on the issues of intellectual property theft and economic espionage?

www.syngress.com
82 
Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
Herold: Without awareness and training, basically a comprehensive education 
program, theft and espionage can occur right under people’s noses without them knowing 
it…without them recognizing it. Humans are both the weakest link information 
protection, but they can also be the strongest. When people know how to recognize 
the signs of potential theft and espionage they can report it early and help to lessen 
the impact, or even prevent the theft or espionage.
Organizations must educate all personnel and business partners about how to 
prevent property theft in order to make the property theft prevention program 
effective. Organizations must educate all personnel about how to recognize economic 
espionage to make the anti-espionage program effective.
Education must occur from the highest position all the way down through the 
positions that you may mistakenly assume do not need to know about preventing the 
theft of intellectual property and preventing economic espionage. The unaware 
personnel will become the path of choice for the criminal.
Burgess and Power: What are some vital and/or sensitive aspects of an awareness and 
education in a protection program focused on the issues of intellectual property theft and economic 
espionage? What are the unique challenges?
Herold: Personnel must understand and learn how to recognize the signs of 
attempts to commit intellectual property theft and to whom they should report these 
attempts.
Personnel must understand and learn how to recognize the signs of economic 
espionage and know to whom they need to report suspicious behavior.
Personnel need to understand the methods used to commit intellectual property 
theft and economic espionage. Too many managers are afraid that this will tell people 
how to commit crimes. However, the majority of employees want to keep their jobs 
and help make their companies successful.
Keep in mind that if you have personnel who are planning to steal, they will 
already know how to do it. Providing training to alert your honest employees to how 
to recognize crime will give you more eyes and ears within your organization to spot 
the criminals; it will not create new criminals.
It is important that you provide GOOD training and awareness communications. 
Too many organizations slap a copy of an excerpt from the text of a law onto a 
PowerPoint and call it training; that is NOT training!
Just because so-called training products are expensive also does not mean it is GOOD 
training. Document the characteristics and features that you want to have within your 
training content, and the different methods you want to use to deliver awareness 

www.syngress.com
 
Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage • Chapter 5 
83
communications, and then choose your products based upon the quality of the 
vendor products, not based upon who has the most razzle dazzle in their sales pitch.
Probably the biggest challenge is getting the resources and time commitments for 
the training. Awareness, because it is more passive than training, is often easier to sell 
to management and to deliver. The active aspect of training requires the dedicated 
attention of personnel. Getting management to commit to sending their personnel to 
a 1-hour, or even 30-minute, session is often a challenge. This is just one of the many 
reasons when training and awareness efforts must be clearly and strongly supported 
by executive management.
Burgess and Power: How has the theft of trade secrets and other forms of intellectual 
property changed over the last few decades? Is the means of attack less dependent on the insider 
than previously? Is it more oriented toward technological means of acquiring secrets than previously? 
Certainly, the impact of both globalization and the WWW has been signiﬁ cant. Have the 
players changed? Have the likely targets increased? What are the challenges of protecting intellectual 
property and trade secrets in the Global Economy and the Information Age?
Herold: The insider threat is still as signiﬁ cant as it ever was, perhaps even more. 
More news is reported about people getting jobs within an organization with the 
speciﬁ c intent of stealing intellectual property, or providing information to customers.
There are many more ways to do these crimes, but the old, tried and true methods 
are still as effective as ever. Most organizations are dumping all their money into 
technology controls and defenses, but then completely ignoring such things as 
disposal of information, paper document controls, and other safeguards that should 
be common sense now.
The players have not necessarily changed; now there are just MORE players. That 
is the challenge; trying to identify all the threats. There are so many; several that are 
still unknown. It is hard to defend against the unknown.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes and oversights in terms of personnel 
security, e.g., background checks, etc., that expose organizations to insider-initiated intellectual 
property theft and economic espionage?
Herold: Too few organizations perform background checks on potential employees. 
And even fewer perform regular background checks on existing employees. Employees 
change over time; they encounter hardships and situations in which they may get 
involved with criminal activities. It is important to regularly check so that such 
activities can be caught as early as possible.
It is also important to perform due diligence on the organizations contracted and 
entrusted to process, store, or otherwise handle and access sensitive data; those to 

www.syngress.com
84 
Chapter 5 • Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage
whom activities have been outsourced. Organizations need to check to ensure THEY 
perform background checks, including criminal checks, on their employees. Many 
crimes have occurred as a result of employees within outsourced organizations doing 
bad things.
Burgess and Power: Just as the overall space has changed over the last few decades, 
i.e., the WWW, globalization, etc., so has the nature of the insider. Determining who is an 
insider and who is an outsider is problematic in this era of outsourcing, contracting, etc. Talk 
about the problems that arise in this environment?
Herold: Now basically anyone who has access to your information and systems 
should be considered an insider. This includes not only your employees, but also your 
contractors, consultants, folks hired to clean the ofﬁ ces, folks hired to be security 
guards, companies providing managed security services, ISPs, and the list can go on 
and on.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes that insiders engaged in intellectual 
property theft and economic espionage typically make that lead to their detection?
Herold: They leave trails. Electronic trails are very hard to remove; especially when 
the criminal does not know of all the trails he or she is leaving. They also assume that 
no one is smart enough to ﬁ gure out what they did because doing bad things electronically 
seems like such an anonymous activity. They assume if they cannot see evidence of 
what they did that there is no evidence. They don’t realize the bits and bytes of their 
actions have been accumulating as they’ve been performing their illicit acts. Most 
criminals are also proud of what they did and start bragging about how they outsmarted 
the system. Egos are the downfall of a large portion of criminals.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes and oversights in terms of cyber 
security that expose organizations to outsider-initiated intellectual property theft and economic 
espionage?
Herold: Most organizations underestimate the power and value of awareness 
communications and providing training. Organizations need to deliver ongoing awareness 
messages to let personnel know the risks the organization faces regarding IP theft and 
espionage. They must make personnel understand the threats and associated IP theft 
methods. They must let them know how to keep from being vulnerable to these 
threats while they are performing their job responsibilities.
Burgess and Power: What are some of the mistakes and oversights in terms of physical 
security that expose organizations to outsider-initiated intellectual property theft and economic 
espionage?

www.syngress.com
 
Virtual Roundtable on Intellectual Property and Economic Espionage • Chapter 5 
85
Herold: Mobile computing devices and storage devices are not protected within 
most organizations. Data on these devices need to be encrypted so that if and when 
the devices fall into criminals’ hands they will not be able to use the data.
Burgess and Power: Generally speaking, what is the level of executive comprehension and 
awareness about the threats and the issues involved in the space of intellectual property theft 
and economic espionage? What kind of mind-set do you encounter in the boardroom? What are 
the major psychological blocks and pre-conceived notions that have to be overcome?
Herold: Most executives under-estimate the threats their organization faces. They 
often have the opinion that if nothing bad has happened yet, then nothing bad will 
happen. Many organizations are also of the opinion that they have nothing valuable 
that other organizations would ﬁ nd valuable; that they have no reason to be a target. 
And still many more executives say, “We trust our employees. We do not want to send 
the signal that we don’t by implementing controls that are not really necessary.”

The Strategy

Part 2 • The Strategy
In Part 1, we gave you a look at the nature of the challenge and the shadowy forces 
(inner and outer) that make it into such a formidable one.
In Part 2, we will offer you our ideas on how to develop a winning strategy to 
overcome this formidable challenge.
In Chapter six, “Elements of a Holistic Program,” we outline the key ingredients 
of the winning strategy.
In Chapters seven, eight, and nine, we share three powerful case studies that 
underscore the vital role of awareness and education (if done right).
In Chapters 10, 11, and 12, we drill down into what it takes to make the three 
strong gears of personnel security, physical security, and information security lock in to 
each other and turn the great wheel together. In each of these three chapters, you will 
ﬁ nd an assessment tool in Q-and-A format. If you answer (or delegate the answering) 
of the questions in these three assessment tools, you have a far better understanding of 
the current intellectual property protection posture of your enterprise, as well as a 
clear vision of what needs to be done.
In Chapters 13 and 14, we explore two often ignored aspects of intellectual property 
protection: Chapter 13, “The Intelligent Approach,” explores the ways in which 
an intelligence program can enlighten you strategically and embolden you tactically. 
Chapter 14, “Protecting Intellectual Property in a Crisis Situation,” sheds light on the 
ways in which your business continuity and crisis management plans need to factor 
in IP-related issues so that you do not go ahead and rescue everyone—and recover 
everything—only to ﬁ nd that in the process you lost the business itself.
Chapter 15, “How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program,” presents 
ﬁ ve ﬁ gures on why and how (i.e., makes the business case) your enterprise needs to 
confront the twenty-ﬁ rst century challenge of IP theft and economic espionage with a 
twenty-ﬁ rst century IP protection strategy. The presentation is calibrated for board-of-
directors level leadership, and presenter’s notes are included with each ﬁ gure.

Chapter 6 • Elements of a Holistic Program
Introduction
In many environments, security as an element of business culture has been hit with 
the double-whammy—that is, it suffers from both an image problem and an identity 
crisis. Many people think of corporate security as the “guards, guns, and gates” guys 
and cyber security as those “snoops who read employees’ e-mail.”
Security often is seen as a controlling or constricting force within an enterprise. 
It is frequently thought of as something that gets in the way of business. And lacking 
either a real mandate or a bold vision, many people within security slip into a reactive 
mode and resort to playing whack-a-mole, thus contributing to the bad image and 
deepening the identity crisis.
Security also is harried from a pack of false memes, which hound it, as well as some 
structural impairment, which hobbles it.
False Memes Lead 
People the Wrong Way
For example, a false meme tells you that teenage hackers with purple Mohawks and 
skateboards are responsible for most network break-ins; they don’t really mean any real 
harm or do much damage. That might have been true ﬁ fteen years ago, but it hasn’t 
been true for quite some time.
Another false meme assures you that 80 percent of all serious cyber-crime is 
perpetrated by insiders, for example, by dishonest or disgruntled employees. Again, 
looking in the rear-view mirror, at a great distance, that might have been true years 
ago, but it is a dangerous assumption in today’s world. It is not that the insider threat 
has been diminished; it is that the threat from outside has increased dramatically. 
Furthermore, the lines between insider and outsider have been blurred both by 
technology and business practice.
A third false meme (there are several others) states that “most industrial espionage 
is done by the turning of insiders.” Like the notion about “insiders” being the cause of 
most problems, this meme about the turning of insiders is particularly dangerous because 
it is a half-truth. The turning of insiders was the principle method, and it still is a major 
factor, but the business environment has changed radically, and methods of collection, 
and those eager to collect, have changed along with it.

From the Industrial Age 
to the Information Age
Of course, just as the Agricultural Age did not drop away when we entered into 
the Industrial Age, the Industrial Age is still with us, but an added dimension, the 
Information Age, is laid over the top of the two earlier paradigms. We are up to our 
necks in what Tofﬂ er called the Third Wave, and it has brought with it tremendous 
opportunity and profound challenge.
Unfortunately, this Third Wave has yet to sweep away a lot of Second Wave thinking 
about the nature of security.
To understand what security should look and feel like in the twenty-ﬁ rst century, 
pull out a piece of black paper. First, draw a big circle on it, and write along the 
curve of the circle, “Global Economy.” Next, draw a second big circle of the same 
circumference on top of the ﬁ rst circle, and then write along side of the curve of this 
second, superimposed circle, “Cyberspace.”
Within these two dimensions, which share the same space, you cannot draw a 
perimeter for your enterprise. And certainly, if you cannot draw a perimeter, you 
cannot protect it. Of course, you could draw a smaller circle, or a square, within the shared 
circle of the global economy and cyberspace, and you could imagine that the lines of 
the smaller shape delineated your enterprise’s perimeter, but you would be deluding 
yourself. The reality is that the smaller shape is permeated by both the global economy 
and cyberspace, both are inside of your enterprise, you cannot keep them outside, and 
they are integral to how we do business today.
This new world demands a new security paradigm. We think of it as a holistic vision 
of security.
We have described the bad image, the identity crisis, and the false memes, but what 
about the structural impairment? Just as intelligence suffers from stove-piping (i.e., unless 
intelligence can be cross-referenced and aggregated in many ways, and analyzed afresh 
from different angles, something very important will probably slip by), so does security; 
if personnel security, physical security, and information security are all stove-piped 
within an enterprise, each is less than it could be, and all could well be working at 
cross-purposes. Figure 6.1 shows how awareness and intelligence can help mitigate 
risk and threats within an organization.

www.syngress.com
92 
Chapter 6 • Elements of a Holistic Program
In life, in nature, in business, and in security, everything is interconnected, one way 
or another, just as the size of the glacier pack impacts the ﬂ ow of the river, which, in 
turn, impacts the irrigation and reservoirs upon which human habitation has come to 
rely. In security, all the various elements interconnect for good or bad. If your most 
sensitive information is stored on an insecure server, your investment in physical and 
personnel security will be wasted. Conversely, if inadequate attention is paid to your 
physical security, then all your diligence in implementing personnel and information 
security controls could be for naught. Figure 6.2 shows how integration of physical, 
personnel, and cyber security helps narrow the scope of risks and threats within an 
organization.

Each has to strengthen the other; each has to resonate with the whole (see Figure 6.3).
Here are some recommendations for a comprehensive program:
■ Organization:  Where security reports within an organization is perhaps 
the most vital issue of all. Consider appointing a Chief Security Ofﬁ cer (CSO), 
who reports to either the Chief Executive Ofﬁ ce (CEO) or the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer (CFO). This person should hold the reins of personnel 
security, physical security, and information security, and should not be a 
stranger to the boardroom.
■ Awareness and Education:  Educate your work force on an ongoing basis 
about the threats of economic espionage, intellectual property theft, counter-
feiting, and piracy. Help them understand your expectation that they will protect 
the enterprise’s intellectual property, and by extension, their own livelihood. 
Provide general education for the entire workforce, and specialized education 
for executives, managers, technical personnel, among others.
■ Personnel Security:  Implement a “Personnel Security” program that includes 
both background investigations and termination procedures. You need policies 
that establish checks and balances, and you need to enforce them. Know the 
people you are going to hire. Don’t lose touch with them while they work 
for you. Consciously manage the termination process if and when they leave 
the enterprise.

Chapter 6 • Elements of a Holistic Program
■ Information Security:  Recruit certiﬁ ed information security professionals 
(e.g., CISSP, CISM, etc.) Adopt best practices, and establish a baseline. Utilize 
appropriate information security technologies, such as ﬁ rewalls, intrusion 
detection, encryption, strong authentication devices, and the like. Pay attention 
to data retention and data destruction as well as data access.
■ Physical Security:  Do not overlook the “duh” factor. It is pointless to invest 
in information security, or commit to background investigations, if agents of 
an unscrupulous competitor or a foreign government can simply walk away 
with what they covet.
■ Intelligence:  You need both business and security intelligence. Know your 
competition, your partners, and your customers. Research the market environ-
ment. Keep abreast of the latest trends in hacking, organized crime, ﬁ nancial 
fraud, and state-sponsored economic espionage. You can outsource this expertise. 
But someone must be looking at both streams of intelligence, with the 
particulars of your enterprise in mind.
■ Industry Outreach:  Actively participate in industry working groups appro-
priate to your sector and environment. Talk with your peers about the types 
of attacks or threats they are encountering.
■ Government Liaison:  Leverage your tax dollars. Avail yourself of threat 
information from law enforcement, foreign ministries, elected ofﬁ cials, 
regulatory and trade organizations in your enterprise’s country, and in those 
countries where you conduct business.
■ Legal Strategies:  Realize that even when right is on your side, a market 
may be lost to you, and protecting a portion of the global market is sometimes 
a viable survival strategy. Litigation is not the solution; it is conﬁ rmation that 
intellectual property theft has occurred. Work to protect your intellectual 
property and avoid the costs associated with litigation. Don’t let a small legal 
mind make decisions about big legal issues. Get expert legal advice on 
intellectual property issues.
In sum, your security is in your hands. Employees tend to apply effort and intellect 
to the issue in portions commensurate with management attention to the topic of 
intellectual property protection. Employees line up smartly behind the leader providing 
direction, guidance, and support. Providing that leadership is essential to your ﬁ rm’s 
own continued economic viability in the global economy of the twenty-ﬁ rst century.

In Part 2: The Strategy, we will explore how such a holistic program would work, 
with particular emphasis on practical implementation. We present three case studies. 
One case study discusses the creation of an award-winning security awareness effort; 
the second case study discusses a less successful endeavor. A third case study discusses 
social engineering attacks. It is our goal to provide to you both the “how to” as well 
as the “how not to” so that you may see both the road to success and the road that 
may be ﬁ lled with potholes.

Chapter 7 • Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program
Introduction
A man dressed in an orange prisoner jumpsuit, sitting in an interrogation room 
(see Figure 7.1), says: “Usually they make it so easy.”
A detective asks, “The victims?”
“I am in and out with their stuff before they get a clue.”
“What was different about this? Look, you got nothing to lose by being straight 
with us. You take pride in your work. High-tech thieves always do.”
“You got a cigarette?”
The detective hands him one from across the table.
“How about a light?”
“No smoking allowed.”
The prisoner says “Thanks,” with an edge of sarcasm, and then resumes his narrative: 
“Those execs were open targets at the conference, which was the perfect set-up.”
Cut to the outside of a conference center.
A camera shutter clicks, capturing a photo of three conference attendees greeting 
each other and shaking hands.
The lens zooms in on the conference and the employee ID badge hanging from 
one of the attendees’ jackets.
Cut to the lobby of the conference center.
“The ﬁ rst exec was easy to ﬁ nd––near the restaurant, with all his gear. He looked 
worn-out. Perfect. I asked him a few questions about his PDA, and then I saw the 
conﬁ dential information on his laptop. He asked to see my badge and I showed him 
one I snagged.”

The thief engages the executive in small talk.
“Then I just had to wait for the window of opportunity.”
He follows the executive into the washroom. The executive puts down his laptop 
case, and turns his back on it, to wash his face at the sink. The thief steals the laptop case.
The executive goes to a security guard in the lobby and reports his bag missing.
“After I put the laptop in my van, I had to move fast. But I sensed my luck 
was turning.”
His eyes follow another one of the executives riding the up escalator.
“The other guy had already dropped his bags in his room.”
Cut to the other executive warning the woman that a laptop may have been 
stolen and that she should keep an eye on hers.
His cell phone rings.
“Since the word was getting out I had to be quick and grab what I could.”
The thief bumps into the executive talking on the cell phone, as he turns and 
walks away. He snags his hotel key card, which was hanging out of the back pocket 
of his trousers.
“I used his key card and his laptop was right out in the open, just as I had 
suspected. I didn’t have the cable cutters on me.”
So the thief inserts a ﬂ ash stick into the laptop.
“Couldn’t access the system because it was password protected. I snagged some 
paperwork to see if there was anything in it. Found a calendar printout about a 
meeting in the mezzanine with the woman, about future acquisitions (see Figure 7.2).
“I ﬁ gured a little inside information wouldn’t hurt. I thought I would give it a 
last shot. The mezzanine meeting was a perfect opportunity.”

The detective interjects, “You underestimated them.”
“I didn’t think they’d become so aware so quick.”
Cut to the mezzanine.
“I showed her my cell, told her it was out of juice and I had to call my kid at 
school. Figured I try to get some acquisition contacts from her PDA. When I got her 
PDA there was some kind of pin number lock on it. When she asked for a photo ID, 
I knew it was time to bail.”
The detective boasts, “And we caught you on your way out?”
“Lucky for you.”
“As soon as the ﬁ rst laptop was stolen, all the executives knew they were targets.”
“Lucky for them. There will always be exceptions.”
The detective leans over him, puts his hand on the thief’s shoulder and remarks, 
“And your targets are getting wiser.”
What Is This Scenario?
Is this scenario the opening of a Hollywood thriller about high-tech espionage? 
No. It is the script for “We Are the Targets” (available online at  www.cisco.com/go/
cspo), an award-winning security awareness video developed by Cisco’s Corporate 
Security Programs Organization (CSPO).
The four-minute ﬁ lm offers compelling evidence that a twenty-ﬁ rst century 
security awareness program can be sophisticated, entertaining, and provocative.
The era of raising awareness with little more than coffee mugs and key-chains 
has been eclipsed (if, indeed, such tchotchkes were ever more than marginally effective). 
If your organization is a world-class entity, and you are trying to communicate the 
importance of security, then you need a world-class vehicle to deliver that message. 
If your sales and marketing content is of a high quality, if it has some sizzle and style, 
how can you gain the respect or even the attention of your workforce unless you 
create awareness content that also has an edge?
“We Are the Targets” concludes with a montage of practical recommendations 
juxtaposed with critical moments from the ﬁ lm:
■ Use a notebook privacy ﬁ lter.
■ Lock away Cisco equipment (laptop) and conﬁ dential documents.
■ Travel with a cable lockdown device.
■ Enable a password screensaver on your laptop after ten minutes.

The video is a rich media component of Cisco’s larger internal security awareness 
campaign. This campaign’s rich media content is based on global real-life scenarios 
showing actual incidents, for example, thieves who blend into the environment of the 
workplace to steal information effortlessly to gain competitive advantage.
The concept of the CSPO video was to deliver a short, dramatic, ﬁ ve-minute video 
(sans talking heads) that was fresh and current, but portrayed Cisco employees as smart, 
aware, responsible, and security-savvy citizens.
The script was written by an internal video resource from IT Flex Services and 
based on the collective input of the CSPO team. Security experts from a cross-section 
of Cisco security groups—including Global Risk Management, Global Protective 
Services, Safety & Security, and Information Security––were selected to work with 
Mia Bradway Winter, CSPO’s Security Awareness Program Manager, and video director, 
Paul Wood, the internal expert from IT Flex Services.
The video was produced on a remarkably modest budget of $30,000 and took eight 
weeks to complete. There were weekly team meetings and script reviews in development 
and preproduction. The ﬁ lming was done over a two-day period. Services provided 
by the internal video unit included writing the Statement of Work, cross-charging 
the CSPO Awareness budget at the end of the quarter, contracting and coordinating 
the use of external professional services like professional actors, professional ﬁ lm crew, 
sound crew, location scouting, video direction, and script writing in close collaboration 
with CSPO.
The Cisco team competed against worldwide ad agencies producing safety and 
training videos at four different international video events. Typically, ad agencies create 
the videos or ads for their client (global Fortune 500 companies), and charge the 
client over $100,000.
“We Are the Targets” received three industry awards in the Safety & Security Training 
category from the following video competitions:

The Message Is the 
Medium: Be a Security Champion
“In yesterday’s age, a security ‘team’ was frequently relied upon to defend against 
attack. Not so in today’s threat environment; security is everyone’s responsibility,” 
John N. Stewart, Cisco’s Chief Security Ofﬁ cer, stresses, “whether you are designing 
a new protocol, working on our buildings, or talking to our customers, security is 
integral to our corporate culture.”
Working with Stewart’s vision, the CSPO awareness team decided on some very 
simple messaging to reach across all cultures within the Cisco environment: “Keeping 
Cisco Secure,” a message that serves as an overarching theme, and “Be a Security 
Champion,” a message that is intended to empower the workforce.
With those two messages, you can do a lot of things. Neither message says “Infosec” 
or “Safety and Security.” It can be used by any security organization, because it is generic.
CSPO built its annual, company-wide, Web-based e-learning course––a twenty-
minute ﬂ ash presentation––around the “Be a Security Champion” theme. This theme 
proved to be a champion—the internal campaign was recognized with two MarCom 
Creative Awards in 2006:
■ Platinum Award for the “Cisco Systems, Inc., Internal Security Awareness 
Campaign (Category: Marketing/Promotion/Campaign/Promotion Materials)
■ Platinum Award for the Cisco Systems, Inc. video: Cisco Security Champion
The “Cisco Security Champion” video was designed as a sequel to the ﬁ rst video, 
with the use of the same actor portraying the same perpetrator. In this scenario, a few 
basic security lessons were identiﬁ ed and emphasized, and an effort was made 
to “internationalize” the message.
The Message
■ Allow only appropriately badged personnel into Cisco facilities.
■ Protect Cisco information.

■ Don’t leave paper lying about at the printer (print and pick up).
■ Be mindful of elicitation by both known and unknown persons.
■ Do not use non-Cisco computers for Cisco work.
■ Use laptop encryption.
The scenario shows the international aspect of organized criminal elements, 
which realize that stealing a company’s information assets and selling them to a 
willing buyer may give the buyer “competitive advantage.”
In this video, the perpetrator has ﬂ ed the country, after having met bail from his 
previous arrest following an attempt at stealing Cisco’s intellectual property. He pulls 
together an international team to target Cisco’s newest technology.

and Tailgating (Photo Courtesy of Cisco)
The video’s touch points include:
■ Stealing a laptop (only to ﬁ nd that it is encrypted and thus has the value of 
an expensive paperweight)

www.syngress.com

Chapter 7 • Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program
■ Expectation that an employee would use a public kiosk and personal e-mail 
to conduct business (only to ﬁ nd that the employee, in accordance with 
information security policy, was using the personal e-mail for personal items 
and took steps to protect his personal identifying information)
■ Elicitation (see Figure 7.3)––an attempt to elicit from employees outside of 
the Cisco buildings information on projects and technologies (thwarted by 
Cisco employees mindful of the need to know and to know with whom you 
are speaking about your work)
■ Tailgating (see Figure 7.4)––an attempt to ingratiate oneself and pass oneself 
off as a Cisco colleague and tailgate into the building feigning that he had 
forgotten his badge, only to be told in a polite, yet ﬁ rm manner that corporate 
policy required the nonbadged individual to go to the main building entrance 
and sign-in.
■ Badge theft––as a means to garner access to a Cisco facility and conduct a “snatch 
and grab” of paper near printers and nonsecured devices (PDAs, laptops, etc.)

Again, as with the ﬁ rst video, the video demonstrated the desired behavior, and 
projected the image of Cisco employees exercising the behavior encouraged in the 
Cisco training, as opposed to what unfortunately has been the industry norm in videos, 
showing employees engaged in incorrect behavior. This perspective projects the positive 
aspect of the behavior, and thus allows for the employee audience to relate to the 
characters being projected; that is to say, Cisco employees engaged in making the right 
security decisions in a clear and unambiguous manner.
The comprehensive, multiple touch point marketing campaign that enveloped the 
video featured coordinated posters, lens clothes, highlighters (highlighting security), pads, 
pens, key fobs, and more, which all ampliﬁ ed the key message on a continuum: Be a 
Security Champion and Keep Cisco Secure.
This was an effective use of tchotchkes, or trinkets, because they were tied into the 
ﬁ lms, larger and more sophisticated vehicles for the messages. Because the ﬁ lms were 
hip and highly successful, the trinkets associated with them become a hot commodity 
and a personal statement. Without this kind of linkage, the use of tchotchkes trivializes 
the issues involved and the messages you are trying to convey.
When Your Message Reaches the 
Employees They Become Your Messengers
Taking the vision of personal responsibility and empowerment to the next level, the 
management team wanted to be able to reward people within Cisco (excluding CSPO 
team members, of course) who make some signiﬁ cant change in the way the business 
views security or its implementation.
CSPO put together an awards and recognition program, the “Cisco Security 
Champion Awards” to empower and recognize security ambassadors across Cisco who 
have demonstrated measurable security leadership behaviors that have changed the way 
his or her business unit views security. The fact that awards are given out twice a year 
is strategic. In December, during the holiday season, it taps into the spirit of giving. The 
other ceremony is in June, just before Cisco employees’ annual review. That means a 
lot to people. It is a real feather in your cap to have that in your annual review.
CSPO team members (approximately 200 people) are invited to identify and 
nominate potential security champions whom they think have made a difference in 
the security of Cisco. The award competition is competitive. The more nominations 
made, the more the CSPO is provided documented evidence that the message is 
spreading and adhering.

The winners get recognition. At the CSPO global all-hands meeting, John Stewart 
awards them with a beautiful marble plaque. They get a cash award. Money is important. 
The company makes a big deal out of it, and their management has to commit to 
acknowledge this win at their next staff meeting, so that this award does not go unnoticed. 
Then at the end of the calendar year, all 10 winners’ names are perpetualized on a 
team plaque displayed in one of the campus lobbies.
One of Cisco’s ﬁ rst Security Champion honorees worked in China. He created 
an initiative to modularize the code that people work on, which is working very 
well. When you are given a source code project to work on, you are given only that 
component to work with; you do not get access to every single thing. There are many 
challenges to rolling out a security awareness program in a far-ﬂ ung, fast-paced 
global corporation. You must seize every opportunity available to you.
At a global sales conference, CSPO partnered with Global Protective Services, for 
booth space. Their goal was introduce the sales force to the use of privacy ﬁ lters on 
their laptops while traveling. That is one call to action that anyone can answer to protect 
the information they control. They came away with 153 leads on people who wanted 
to know more about privacy ﬁ lters.
Although new hires received them with their company laptops, there is an existing 
base of many thousands who got their laptops before the privacy ﬁ lters became 
standard-issue, and there are also many people in emerging markets where procurement 
has not been established yet.
CSPOs also were encouraging people to take the training. And once they took the 
training, if they were in an emerging market, or somewhere else they could not get a 
privacy ﬁ lter, we would take their names down and we would give away privacy ﬁ lters 
(a $40 value). One of the people with whom we made contact was a Russian gentleman 
who was a development director for the Middle East and Africa. He encouraged all 
his team members to take the training and contact me for a privacy ﬁ lter. To this day, 
CSPO team members are still getting requests from Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and other 
locations. It is the “Tell a Friend” mentality, and even though it is comprised of baby 
steps, it will eventually become pervasive.
Staying on Message
The CISCO security awareness program is still evolving. Its creators don’t claim it is 
the best. They point out that there are plenty of organizations out there that have 
been developing their programs for years.

Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program • Chapter 7

Nevertheless, taking a look at the security awareness program developed by Cisco’s 
CSPO offers some invaluable insights, whether you have been tasked to launch a new 
effort or to reenergize an existing one.
On day one, the awareness component within CSPO had a zero budget; within 
three years it had $150,000 in annual funding.
It started off as a one-person operation. In year two, a project manager tasked to 
devote 50 percent of his workload to the program was added. In year three, a Web 
developer and a coordinator were allocated to the virtual team.
To develop the awareness program, Stewart brought in an “outsider” with strong 
communications skills yet no background in security. The choice reveals an understanding 
of the serious obstacles that confront any such awareness program in a sprawling, 
global technology company.
Winter offers some further elucidation:
“Before I began I had no idea what information security might mean. However, 
I did have 20 years experience in external communications, public relations, media 
relations, and analyst relations. While I had never done internal communications or 
internal awareness before, I said, ‘OK, it is a different animal, but if we use those same 
principles from external communications and PR and move them into internal 
communications, we can make something happen.”
However, it is important to note that just as having world-class information security 
expertise and no communications and marketing skills is weakness for many programs, 
the opposite imbalance is just as self-defeating––having world-class communications 
and marketing skills with insufﬁ cient attention to the relevance, authenticity, and 
credibility of the content also results in failure. The substantive input and review of 
subject matter experts is essential to developing powerful content. In assessing awareness 
and education programs throughout the world, we have seen both sorts of imbalance.
The Cisco CSPO videos proved successful because they had both vital 
elements—sophisticated creative components (e.g., a strong script, professional actors, crisp 
editing, etc.) reﬂ ect the contribution of communications and marketing professionals, and 
the credible and compelling content reﬂ ects the input of information security subject 
matter experts.
Reputation and credibility are key ingredients––without them, people won’t listen.
The ﬁ rst six months of the effort to build a CSPO security awareness program 
focused on researching and understanding Cisco from the inside. There are many 
challenging complexities in a large-scale corporate environment. As in all corporations its 
size, there are different cultures within Cisco. There are different functional organizations 

www.syngress.com
108 
Chapter 7 • Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program
with different agendas and different styles (e.g., Sales is completely different than 
Engineering). In most corporations, Sales and Engineering don’t necessarily communicate 
in the same manner. They have different mind-sets and, thus, have different touch points. 
And, of course, there are the corporate executives. They operate at a very different 
level. For them, everything is fast-paced. They need the facts distilled to the nitty-gritty. 
They need the facts immediately. They need the facts before you even talk to them.
Another challenge is that within a large corporation like Cisco, your audience is 
both static and dynamic: static in the sense that the bulk of the audience, engineers, and 
such have been around for some time; and dynamic in the sense that a large corporation 
like Cisco acquires new companies and people are going into divergent markets. Both 
the landscape and the headcount are constantly changing.
Researching Cisco from the inside meant a lot of engagement, and a lot of 
one-on-ones at all levels.
During this research, various functional groups and the key people inside those 
groups were identiﬁ ed. Those individuals who are inﬂ uencers inside the group, the 
ones who could leverage CSPO’s communications message beyond or internally 
within their functional organization, also were identiﬁ ed.
During the ﬁ rst year, 50 different contacts throughout Cisco were established, 
including several on the Cisco Employee Connection team, an internal news portal for 
all Cisco employees formerly run by HR. These portals are theater speciﬁ c: US/Canada, 
Asia-Paciﬁ c, Japan, Europe, Emerging Markets.
If you get a story or a video or some kind of communication piece placed there, 
it cascades to the other geographies, so your reach is greater.
By year three, the CSPO security awareness team had 160 contacts that could be 
called on within Cisco.
Taking advantage of internal corporate events is vital. What better way to reach 
all the executives? What better way to reach the global population? What better common 
denominator can you tap into? There were nine different, internal Cisco events CSPO 
could tap into. One of them was the Strategic Leadership Off-Site, which is a gathering 
of all the directors and higher positions within the company—about 2,000 executives 
of Cisco globally—and they attend the annual meeting. That’s where the CEO actually 
talks about the strategy, the vision, and the initiatives for the next full year, and 
unveils them.
Of course, CSPO is not the only group trying to impart vital training to the 
workforce. Unless these efforts are coordinated and complimentary, inefﬁ ciencies abound 
and cross-purposes arise.

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program • Chapter 7 
109
There are other groups within Cisco that have compliance training that is required, 
so Winters sits on the compliance training working group, along with representatives 
from Legal, Safety and Security, and so on. This effort is managed by the Ethics group. 
Its goal is to get a compliance training suite that actually is required for all employees 
to take, and to be a part of that offering. Otherwise, it is very hard to get your training 
program socialized. You are all targeting the same audience, the same people, and you 
are hitting them at various times of the year, and it is not fair to the employee. The hope 
is that one functional group (e.g., HR or Legal) could take the training suite and deliver 
it to the employees, and then the awareness group could focus on creating rich content.
It Takes More Than 
Compelling Content and Hard Work
Despite the compelling nature of the content, and the hard work invested in establishing 
relationships throughout a huge organization, there is a third factor; it is the secret 
ingredient of success. Without this secret ingredient, the compelling content would 
be wasted, and all the hard work would be for naught.
That secret ingredient is a real mandate from on high.
There is no executive in the world that would say, for attribution, that he or she 
doesn’t take security seriously. And there is no executive in the world that would 
deny that his or her security team has a mandate to heighten awareness and harden 
security within the enterprise.
But just as the devil is in the details, the proof is in the pushback.
No matter how strong your message, no matter how persuasive your presentation, no 
matter how much sweat-equity you have invested in networking and leveraging, no matter 
how honed your marketing and PR skills––if your CSO does not really have the 
authority he or she projects, if those to whom he or she reports within the executive 
suite do not really understand what is demanded of them to make security an enterprise-wide 
imperative––your awareness and education campaign will soon run out of organizational 
momentum, or get lost in the cacophony of competing initiatives, or be suppressed 
by those who feel that the style of work will be inhibited.
When the pushback comes, it has to be clear that this is the will of the executive. 
That is easier said than done, and more often promised than delivered.
Only a strong, credible CSO with the unequivocal and perceptible backing of the 
CEO and the Board of Directors can bring about a paradigm shift in your corporate 
culture.

Lessons Learned
Based on the ongoing experience of its award-winning awareness efforts, Cisco has 
distilled “10 Steps Toward Pervasive Security Awareness” (CSO Magazine, August 
2006 advertising supplement):
1. Get buy-in from upper management.  Indeed, John Chambers’ name 
and rank carry the necessary clout to open doors at Cisco. When the CEO 
says security is important and practices what he preaches, those in the trenches 
take notice. The same goes for all executives and managers down the line.
2. Appoint the right person(s) to lead the charge.  It’s critical to dedicate 
at least one resource to the job—someone who is excited about security 
awareness and can focus 110 percent on the task at hand. It’s absolutely essential 
to appoint an individual with exemplary communications skills; someone who 
knows how to sell, market, and build relationships––in Cisco’s case, a PR veteran.
3. Conduct extensive research.  Stewart’s team conducted over six months 
of research before launching Cisco’s Internal Security Awareness Program. 
One must understand the target audiences and the culture of their respective 
organizations. “You may identify many, many target audiences,” Winter says. 
“But with a complete understanding of each, you can customize your message 
[for greater retention].”
4. Build relationships.  A successful security awareness program requires that 
the security message inﬁ ltrate the enterprise. Winter is part of a small team, 
so she needs all the additional voices she can muster. She gets her support by 
building strong relationships––engaging inﬂ uencers and nurturing those 
connections. She encourages relentless pursuit, but warns that respect for an 
inﬂ uencer’s time and effort is paramount.
5. Create security ambassadors.  What Winter cultivates from many of these 
relationships are security ambassadors; that is, individuals who evangelize security 
awareness messaging and directly inﬂ uence behavior change. One such 
ambassador for Cisco is an employee in the Voice Technology Group who 
persuaded 800 individuals to take online security awareness training––resulting 
in a staggering 98 percent completion rate.

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: Cisco’s Award-Winning Awareness Program • Chapter 7 
111
6. Identify the right communications vehicles.  Look for opportunities to tell 
the security story to the masses. Piggyback on special events (like management 
summits and global sales meetings) and newsletters that are already in circulation. 
Don’t be afraid to reuse initiatives that have worked in the past. Winter adopted 
streaming video to get her message across. She “copied” the concept and 
creative process from an existing program, tailoring it with her own message.
7. Use credible sources.  When creating messaging for large audiences, it’s 
important to feature people who are recognized and trusted by the audience. 
Winter targets her inﬂ uencers and security ambassadors very carefully, relying 
on individuals who are more likely to be “heard” by the target audience. It’s 
equally important to use communications vehicles that garner respect, such 
as a widely read newsletter. Plaques in a meeting room may say more than 
posters in the cafeteria.
8. Keep your messages short and simple.  Like any great marketing 
campaign, it’s better to keep things simple. Short messages are easier to retain. 
Cisco uses pithy lines like “Keeping Cisco Secure” or “Be a Security Champion.” 
Remember, Winter warns, message retention comes from a continuous, 
sustaining program, so repetition is a must.
9. Use rewards and recognition.  The best way to motivate change is by 
rewarding those who take the challenge to heart. Cisco uses a semi-annual 
Security Champion Awards system, whereby individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to effect change are rewarded. In addition to a marble 
plaque and monetary incentives, these individuals are recognized by the 
CSO at an “all-hands” meeting. And their managers personally acknowledge 
them among their peers. Cisco also gives away Security Champion t-shirts 
and privacy ﬁ lters.
10. Make training companywide.  Security awareness training is successful 
only if individuals participate and internalize the course work. It’s essential to 
make training available at all levels and encourage participation. There may 
never be an ideal time to put “real” work aside to take the training, but if the 
message is strong enough, it happens anyway. And the results can be 
impressive.

Approach in Awareness 
and Education Meets 
an Ignoble Fate

Chapter 8 • Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education
Introduction
Here is a case study on the launch of a powerful, unique, and comprehensive awareness 
and education program for a global entity, which we will refer to as “Entity X.” In the 
course of the case study, we will articulate the essential components of an effective 
and economical program, and explore some of the critical issues involved in developing 
it, rolling it out, and institutionalizing it.
Of course, this story is both a case study and a cautionary tale. Indeed, if you 
follow this recipe you will soon find out if your executive team is really serious 
about changing the corporate culture and making security an integral workforce 
value, or is making noise to satisfy their customers and critics. Their reaction may 
pleasantly surprise you or disappoint or disturb you.
The Mission, the Medium, the Message
The mission, as described to the security professional recruited to undertake it, was to 
“change the corporate security culture.” The existing corporate security culture was 
one that allowed laxness in all aspects of security (i.e., physical, personnel, and cyber).
The medium chosen was the establishment of a global security team to provide a 
range of services (policies and standards, security assessments, operational support, 
awareness and education, implementation, audits, inspections, and so forth) for a 
confederation of organizations operating in over 100 countries, with a collective workforce 
of over 100,000 people. In many ways, this environment was even more challenging 
than that of a multi-national corporation, as each entity was truly an independent 
organization. On one hand, the confederation shared a global brand, a global client 
base, and a global body of methodologies and traditions. On the other hand, they 
were determined not to share liability, and had a varying understanding that what 
was good for the confederation as a whole was good for their independent entity.
The message that this global entity wanted to convey to clients and government 
regulators throughout the world who were subjecting their industry to ever-increasing 
inspections/audits, and to its own workforce, was that it took all facets of security seriously.
Meaningful Content 
and Persuasive Delivery
Just as the best military professionals understand that Psychological Operations 
(PSYOP) (i.e., winning hearts and minds) is an essential element of Information 
Operations (IO) in any successful endeavor, whether a war or a peace-keeping mission, the 

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education • Chapter 8 
115
developer of the program examined in this case study understood that awareness and 
education needed to be incorporated into a comprehensive internal public relations effort 
in order to change the global entity’s deeply entrenched corporate culture, which was 
both hostile to security and lacking in command structure with respect to security.
Within the global security team, the intelligence function, the communications 
function, and the awareness and education function were aggregated together.
The concept was revolutionary at that time. The intention was to escalate awareness 
and education into something much more than emblazoning reminders about password 
security, software piracy, e-mail etiquettes, computer viruses, and so forth on coffee 
mugs, key chains, coasters, and wall posters. The intention was to infuse awareness and 
education efforts with real-world, real-time intelligence, and produce a comprehensive 
security campaign that was timely, engaging, and compelling to the workforce.
The new unit’s objectives ref lected this bold and sweeping vision:
■ To analyze intelligence and conduct research relevant to cyber security in 
general and the cyber security of the Entity X in particular, so as to better 
protect both Entity X’s intellectual property, but also those of Entity X’s 
customers, partners, and vendors.
■ To heighten the level of security awareness, inculcate core security values, 
and increase security competency at all levels throughout Entity X, so as to 
ensure that all level of employees understood how a good security regime 
was a market differentiator.
■ To enable and enhance global security team communications on strategic 
initiatives and activities, and ensure that they are of the highest caliber, so to 
provide to the employees, customers, partners, and vendors of Entity X with 
communications truly worth reading versus a communication that is greeted 
with “another one for the dust-bin.”
■ To enrich the cyber security culture of Entity X through participating in 
and contributing to industry and government initiatives and activities, so as 
to truly be a leader both in and outside of the Entity X corporate footprint. 
This recognition would serve to bolster the internal credentials of those 
active with theses organization, but also is a demonstrable means by which 
Entity X as a whole derives great positive benefit via the interaction.
The new unit’s structure was unique. The Intelligence Officer (in this instance, 
someone with extensive writing and speaking skills) reported directly to the Chief 
Security Officer (CSO). The team’s Communications Officer reported to the 

www.syngress.com
116 
Chapter 8 • Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education
Intelligence Officer. The Intelligence Officer and the Communications Officer shared 
responsibility for the awareness and education function. The Intelligence Officer designed 
the program based on concepts of 21st century inf luence warfare, generated its content 
based on open source intelligence, best practices, and so forth, and provided the strategic 
vision and championed the program at the executive level. The Communications 
Officer took the program to market (i.e., rolled it out, socialized it, spread its reach, 
and administered it) on an ongoing basis, within global entity on a managerial level.
Investment and Empowerment
Just as the Intelligence Officer of Entity X’s global security program started with a 
bold, innovative organizational approach (i.e., integrating intelligence, communications, 
and awareness/education into an integrated unit), the team also started out with a 
bold, innovative motivational approach:
■ Instead of talking down to the workforce, show them how they are invested 
in security for better or worse, both in their personal and professional lives.
■ Instead of playing to their fears (of either the bogey man or getting fired), 
engage, initiate, and empower the employees to be a part of the process and 
solution.
■ Instead of just citing dry policies and standards in the workplace, provide 
them with common sense advice on best practices for security in aspects of 
personal lives (i.e., child safety online, identity theft, personal firewalls, emergency 
preparedness in the home, travel security for vacations, and so forth).
Following these principles, the team believed Entity X could demonstrate how 
many security controls required in the work place (e.g., strong passwords, secure 
laptops, regular backups) carry through to the home environment, and thereby 
heightened attentiveness and strengthen adherence to them in both realms. Following 
these principles, the team believed Entity X could establish trust with its workforce, 
and get them to view security as an integral value essential to living and working 
well in the 21st century.
Three-Phase Approach
To achieve the stated GSI objectives (e.g., “to heighten the level of security awareness, 
inculcate core security values, and increase security competency at all levels”) in a 

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education • Chapter 8 
117
labyrinthine and large-scale global environment with a corporate culture, which was 
both many decades old and passively hostile to security, demanded a phased approach 
to introduction and implementation.
The programmatic approach taken by the team was to design a three-phase plan 
to be implemented over a three-year timeline.
Phase I: Engage Everyone 
Economically and Effectively
Phase I focused on the roll out of a five-point initiative to reach the entire workforce 
with cyber security fundamentals:
■ Create a task force composed of participants from Information Technology, 
Human Resources, Risk Management, Physical Security, Legal, and other 
stakeholders representing both global and local organizations within 
Entity X.
■ Launch a bi-monthly electronic newsletter to be delivered in every user’s 
inbox and posted on the innumerable intranet portals.
■ Incorporate a 45-minute PowerPoint presentation on the security responsibilities 
of Entity X’s workforce into the two-day new hire orientation process.
■ Establish a globally and annually observed Security Day within Entity X to 
bring the workforce together for edification and entertainment with security 
as the focus.
■ Deliver a 45-minute e-learning module on the fundamentals of security to 
be used both for all new hires and for incentive and refresher training of 
those already assimilated into the workforce.
By the end of Phase I implementation, Entity X’s global security team could 
reach the entire workforce in four distinct ways:
■ As they come into Entity X via new hire orientation
■ On a bi-monthly basis via e-mail and the intranet
■ Annually through on-site and virtual Security Day events
■ Additionally, at least once more, through the use of the e-learning module as 
an orientation or refresher training resource

Chapter 8 • Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education
The theme of the electronic newsletter was “practical tips for computing both at 
work and at home,” and delivered via e-mail and the intranet. It cost practically 
nothing to produce or distribute.
The newsletter’s editorial calendar included:
■ Password security
■ Child safety on-line
■ Laptop security
■ Identity theft
■ E-mail security
■ Home PC security
■ Social engineering
■ Virus/worm defenses
■ Internet usage
■ Telecom security
■ Back-up and recovery
■ Economic espionage
■ Physical security (office and home)
■ Business travel security
■ Emergency preparedness (office and home)
The e-learning module covered the fundamentals of cyber security for the end-user, 
and was organized into seven subject areas:
■ Creating strong passwords
■ User-oriented anti-virus measures
■ Physical security (including laptop security)
■ Appropriate Internet and e-mail usage
■ Software piracy
■ Backing up your files
■ Counterespionage: How to thwart social engineering

Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education • Chapter 8 
119
Each subject area included two important security controls for the user to exercise, 
and three test questions (both multiple choice and true or false).
The electronic newsletter and the e-learning modules were also translated into 
over 20 languages.
The 45-minute PowerPoint presentation for new hire orientation was an electronic 
file, provided as a template, so that local organizations within Entity X could adapt it 
and expand it as needed. It included suggested comments on the Notes pages for 
each slide to help those whose primary task was not Information Technology (IT) 
security in delivering the presentation effectively. Its theme was “Your Role in Entity 
X’s Security.” The presentation referenced excerpts from relevant policies and standards, 
included a simple but powerful checklist, and provided hyperlinks to the global 
security team’s online awareness and education resources.
Delivered by the intelligence officer, the length of the on-site Security Day 
briefing could be tailored for one- or two-hour sessions, and its content could be 
calibrated for different audiences (e.g., technical or non-technical, executive, or 
administrative). It was global, not US-centric, and provided an overview of major 
security concerns in work and life, a summary of Entity X’s “Global Security 
Strategy,” and a practical checklist for security in both the audience’s personal and 
professional lives.
Phase II: A Rising Tide Lifts All the Boats
Phase II featured regional, two-day technical security training seminars for 
IT professionals. The model devised made it possible for organizations within Entity 
X to provide their IT professionals with expert-level instruction that would 
otherwise be cost-prohibitive. World-class instructors were contracted, using the 
global security team’s GSI budget dollars, and participating local organizations in 
each country had only to cover travel and lodging expenses of the small number 
of IT professionals within their own groups designated to receive the technical 
training.
Because the two-day seminars were organized on a regional basis, even the travel 
and lodging expenses were somewhat more modest than they might otherwise have 
been for the organizations or the individuals themselves.
The curriculum of the technical IT security training centered on a range of 
knowledge areas selected to provide an immediate boost in core competencies 
throughout the pool of Entity X’s IT professionals, including:

www.syngress.com
120 
Chapter 8 • Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education
■ Windows, Internet attacks, and countermeasures
■ How to do security assessments
■ Global intrusion detection framework
■ Global incident response
■ Preparation for both Certified Information Systems Security Professional 
(CISSP) and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) tests
There was another benefit to Entity X as a whole, an invaluable although intangible 
one. At each of the seminars, participants from different countries, with different 
backgrounds and different areas of expertise studied, broke bread and clinked glasses 
together for three days, talking shop, sharing frustrations, trading scuttle-butt and 
bonding deeply in ways that cannot be measured, but that prove priceless at moments 
of crisis, or when truly tough collaborative efforts are required. The trust and bond 
developed in these engagements made the seemingly impossible now not only possible, 
but with a higher probability of success, as all involved were working together from a 
basis of collaborative trust. Such training also sends a very important message to each 
of the participants; you are valuable to us, and we, Entity X, are investing in you to 
ensure the security of Entity X and Entity X’s leadership role.
Another element of Phase II was to expand the program, and leverage the 
resources created in Phase I, to incorporate general security awareness and education 
(i.e., Physical Security, Personnel Security, and Crisis Management)
Leverage existing awareness and education resources to deliver general security 
awareness and education to all Entity X’s people globally.
So, for example, the electronic newsletter and the PowerPoint presentation for new 
hire orientation began to provide information on emergency preparedness and security 
guidelines for travel to high-risk destinations, as well as on cyber security. On-site 
Security Day briefings included updates on terrorism, global warming and bird f lu, as 
well as on hacking, financial fraud, and laptop theft. And a complimentary e-learning 
module, dealing with physical and personnel security issues, was developed.
Phase III: Deliver Vital Intelligence 
and Early Warning to the Executive
Phase III brought the capstone to the pyramidal program: bi-weekly security briefings 
for the top echelons of Entity X executives.

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education • Chapter 8 
121
The team lead in this regard was the intelligence officer, who designed a briefing 
format based on a few simple rules:
■ No executive wants to read a lengthy report, or even one of only a few 
pages. No executive wants to hear about a problem without being told what 
is being done about it.
■ Every briefing must include five sections: one on each Entity X’s three 
geographical regions (i.e., Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and 
Latin America), plus one on an overriding global issue, and one on an issue 
from cyberspace.
■ Each briefing must be contained on a single 8-1/2-inch by 11-inch page, 
with no more than one or two paragraphs for risks and threats in each 
section, including at least one or two bulleted items outlining mitigation 
efforts being undertaken to address them.
■ The Corporate Security Officer must tightly control distribution of the 
briefings, and limit such distribution to only the handful of executives 
designated to receive them, and those on the global security team required 
to prepare them.
Other elements of Phase III were intended to roll out methods for measuring the 
effectiveness of the awareness and education program, and for incorporating security 
knowledge and compliance into performance criteria.
But something happened along the way…
Don’t Be Surprised If…
In an internal survey of IT directors and managers in both the global and local 
entities taken a year after the establishment of the global security team, over 80 
percent reported that the global security team had strengthened Entity X’s overall 
security posture. The results also indicated increased reliance on the global security 
team in general (more than 60 percent wanted its help in conducting annual security 
reviews), and on the awareness and education program in particular (70 percent of 
those who had not already adopted it planned to within the next year).
Attendee evaluations for regional technical cyber security training held in Europe 
and Asia also highlighted the effectiveness of the program:

www.syngress.com
122 
Chapter 8 • Case Study: A Bold New Approach in Awareness and Education
■ Over 65 percent of Asian attendees and over 70 percent of European attendees 
reported that class objectives were relevant to their needs
■ Over 70 percent of both Asian and European attendees reported gaining 
new knowledge and skills
■ Over 60 percent of Asian attendees and almost 60 percent of European 
attendees reported that the training would help them do their job better and 
more effectively
Local entities participating in on-site Security Day briefings on “Security Challenges 
in Your Person and Professional Life” grew from three international cities in the first 
year, to eight international cities the next year, to a projected 20 international cities in 
the third year.
Grateful readers of the electronic newsletter, from all over the world, e-mailed the 
global security team with personal queries, concerns, and suggestions.
The program outlined in this case study is a model that can be applied effectively 
and economically in many environments. If you have a workforce of over 100,000, 
you can provide it for less than two US dollars per person per year.
So how does the case study end? Well, sadly, in ignominy. There are many security 
professionals who will see a bit of their own story in this cautionary tale.
Even as the security team tasked to change this old and intractable corporate 
culture had actually gained traction, and was succeeding in raising the level of awareness 
and deepening core competencies throughout Entity X’s global environment, its 
mandate shriveled up and blew away.
What’s the moral of the story? When they bring you in and tell you they want 
you to “change corporate culture,” ensure that you have executive backing to accomplish 
the task; discuss the measurable and milestone events that will define success or failure. 
The buzzwords are a dime-a-dozen and bantered about willy-nilly. Be specific. Do 
not take them at their word. Define their words. As you progress, do so incrementally. 
Do not get too far ahead of your executive sponsors. If they don’t get it, they can’t 
support it. Ensure the General Counsel is included in the circle of sponsors and has 
bought in at the outset. If he or she isn’t included, or if he or she is small-minded or 
risk-averse, he may convince the executive sponsors that the greatest liability is in 
knowing, rather than in not knowing.
In this case, the individuals brought in to change the culture moved along to new 
jobs where executive leadership was serious about the need for a culture of security 
to be developed within their organizations.

The good news is that there are many engagements available. The bad news is 
that there are many corporations without leadership backing for a strong and fully 
integrated security regime and culture within their organizations. Table 8.1 is an

Case Study: The Mysterious 
Social Engineering Attacks 
on Entity Y

Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
Introduction
Social engineering, the practice of conning people into sharing sensitive information, 
be it in everyday person-to-person interaction, or via cyber interconnectivity, is a real 
security threat that has evolved in sophistication and broadened in scope over the 
decade we have been both writing about it and training people how to thwart it. 
Unfortunately, in most organizations, countermeasures against social engineering have 
not kept pace, and thus the adversaries to the enterprise continue to stretch their lead 
and put in danger the intellectual properties of those ill-prepared corporations.
Most organizations acknowledge it as a problem, but treat it as a nuisance rather 
than a very serious issue. Accordingly, most organizations do not invest any, let alone, 
enough in the one real countermeasure—effective and empowering security awareness 
and education for all employees as well as extra training for those in sensitive positions 
or positions of extreme trust (e.g., executives, executive assistants, human resources staff, 
and help desk personnel). We want to stress “effective” and “empowering,” because as 
we noted in the previous chapter (Case Study: A Bold New Approach to Awareness and 
Education, And How It Met An Ignoble Fate), just having a program is not enough. To be 
effective it has to be compelling and show your employees, in meaningful ways, that 
they have a stake in security and that the enterprise security depends upon their efforts. 
It also has to empower these employees instead of simply scare them or leave them 
with the sensation that they are being talked down to by the “security people.”
And as these three news stories on a scandal that erupted at Hewlett-Packard in the 
fall of 2006 illustrates, it is not only hackers or competitors, but also your organization’s 
executives and investigators in their hire that have to be considered as potential risks 
if not direct threats, literally originating from the inside of the organization:
Investigators hired by Hewlett-Packard to ﬁ nd a media leak used sensitive information to access 
phone-company computers and get the calling records of nine reporters without authorization.…
The revelations came a day after complaints by a former member of HP’s board of directors 
forced the company to ﬁ le a statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), acknowledging that investigators hired by the board had fraudulently accessed the 
private telephone records of board members and reporters. The private investigators fraudulently 
used the identities of the victims to get the necessary login credentials to access online telephone 
records without authorization, according to media reports.… (HP-funded hacking included 
reporters’ data, Security Focus, 9-8-06).
Not only did investigators impersonate board members, employees and journalists to obtain their 
phone records, but according to multiple reports, they also put an HP director and a reporter for CNet 

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y • Chapter 9 
129
Networks Inc under surveillance. They sent monitoring spyware in an e-mail to that reporter by 
concocting a phony story tip. They even snooped on the phone records of former CEO and 
Chairwoman Carly Fiorina, who had launched the quest to identify media sources in the ﬁ rst place. 
And in a twist that might seem preposterous if it happened in a movie, The New York Times reported 
that HP consultants considered hiring spies to pose as clerical or custodial workers at CNet and The 
Wall Street Journal. (Hewlett-Packard scandal gets wider and weirder, The Age, 9-21-06).
The news has once again highlighted a growing problem plaguing the telecommunications 
industry called “pretexting,” a scam where unauthorized individuals pretend to be someone 
they’re not to obtain personal information. Private investigators and con artists have been using 
this technique for years not just to obtain phone records, but also to get access to bank records, 
credit card information and other sensitive information. The telecommunications industry came 
under ﬁ re nine months ago when news reports pointed to Web sites where customer records could 
be openly purchased. The news prompted several phone companies, including Cingular Wireless, 
Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, to sue brokers selling customers’ phone records.…
(Security breaches are wake-up calls to phone companies, CNET News.com 9-11-06).
Fundamentals of 
Social Engineering Attacks
There are two types of social engineering: technology-based deception and human-based 
deception. In both cases, the perpetrator relies on the natural human tendency to trust, 
as the means by which they manipulate the individual into engaging in a demonstrable 
activity, which may otherwise not be in the normal course of events for that individual. 
The perpetrators are always well prepared, and engage in preliminary data collection 
to support their “engagement” with the individual whom they wish to manipulate 
into a desired action or actions.
Let’s start with a classic example of human-based deception.
Throughout the 1990s—the formative years of the Internet and information 
security—hackers had taken on an almost mystical aura. To satisfy the appetite 
composed mostly of curiosity, which could easily evolve into fear, an important 
community event was the “Meet The Enemy.” This event was a teleconference 
between hackers dialing in and an assembly of information security professionals 
on-site. In the years before Jeff Moss’s Defcon and Black Hat conferences came to 
dominate the space, “Meet the Enemy,” moderated by the great Ray Kaplan and 
hosted by the Computer Security Institute, offered the only public forum for real 
dialogue between the black hats and the white hats (and yes, the gray hats too).

www.syngress.com
130 
Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
On one legendary evening, one of the hackers who had called gave a live 
demonstration to substantiate his boasts about his social engineering prowess:
He dialed up a phone company, got transferred around, and reached the company’s 
Help Desk.
Hacker: “Who’s the supervisor on duty tonight?“
“Oh. It’s Betty.“
Hacker: “Let me talk to Betty.” (He’s transferred to Betty’s extension)
Hacker: “Hey Betty, having a bad day?”
“No, why?”
Hacker: “Your systems are down.”
“My systems aren’t down, we’re running ﬁ ne.”
Hacker: “All of my monitors here are showing that you are completely ofﬂ ine. 
Something is really wrong.”
“We didn’t even show a blip, we show no change.”
Hacker: “Sign off again.”
She did.
Hacker: “Betty, I am going to have to sign-on as you here to ﬁ gure out what is 
happening with your ID. Let me have your user ID and password.”
At this point, this senior supervisor at a Help Desk for a major telecommunications 
company told the hacker her user ID and password.
Hacker: “I’m signed on as you now and I can’t see the difference. Shoot, I know 
what it is. Let me sign off. Now sign yourself back on again.”
She did.
Hacker: “I know what it is. You’re on day-old ﬁ les. You think you’re on-line but 
your not. You’re on day-old ﬁ les. Do me a favor, what changes all the time? The PIN 
code. Pull the PIN code ﬁ le, just read me off the ﬁ rst ten PIN codes you’ve got there 
and I will compare them.”
As she started to read off the ﬁ rst pin code, the hacker hung up on her.
Turning back, virtually to the audience of information security professionals, 
which included some stunned personnel from the telecommunications company he 
had just attacked, he bellowed out “I told you I could…”
Of course, human-based social engineering isn’t just attempted over the telephone; it 
can be accomplished via e-mail, online chat, or any other communications medium. In 
the above example, the goal was obtaining a userid/password, pin codes, and other means 
to access an enterprise’s infrastructure. Once in the infrastructure, recognized by the 
information systems as a trusted-insider, the enterprise’s intellectual property is put at risk.

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y • Chapter 9 
131
The many ways social engineering attacks have evolved over the years has been 
the development of technology-based approaches (e.g., using e-mail messages or Web 
sites that masquerade as some communications from or sites belonging to vendors, 
service providers, or clients known to your users).
In one illustrative case, Yahoo users received e-mails from an individual falsely 
identifying himself as a Yahoo employee. The e-mail informed the Yahoo users that 
they had won a fast modem from Yahoo. To receive their free gift, the recipients 
simply had to provide their name, address, telephone number, and credit card number, 
in order to cover the cost of shipping. Before Yahoo detected the con and sent out a 
bulletin to its users, numerous people had fallen for it. This was the earliest form of 
what is now known as “phishing.”
Social engineering, whether human-based or technology-based, is used to gain 
user or administrator passwords to break into networks. It is also widely used to 
collect personal information for identity theft (e.g., “phishing”) as well as for tricking 
users into clicking on booby-trapped e-mail attachments with malicious payloads 
(e.g., the “I Love You” worm).
How much identify theft could have been thwarted if even just the largest 
employers had instituted effective and empowering awareness and education programs 
that explain what social engineering is and how to thwart it for their work forces? 
How many hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud losses could have been avoided? 
How much anguish in people’s personal lives? How much intellectual property that 
had been properly secured, would not have been unsecured and revealed.
But social engineering isn’t just used by hackers to gain network access or fraudsters 
to commit identity theft.
It would be folly to simply focus your defensive efforts on thwarting the conversations 
that happen via technological communications mediums. Person-to-person interaction can 
be extraordinarily damaging. When an adversary obtains the userid/passwords they are 
perhaps able to gain entry to your enterprise, but they are oftentimes discovered shortly 
thereafter due to their lack of knowledge in moving about the infrastructure and 
inadvertently setting off alarms and alerts, which enables the enterprise to lockdown and 
inspect. But what of the adversary, who successfully obtains the userid/passwords and then 
sits on them, invests the time to then collect the necessary data to knowledgably transit the 
enterprise’s infrastructure in an unalarming fashion.
This theorem begs the question, how? Through painstakingly observation and 
interaction with your employees, much can be accomplished without suborning an 
employee’s loyalty to the enterprise. Some examples:

www.syngress.com
132 
Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
■ Restaurants in proximity to the enterprise building: team meetings, after-work 
libations, visiting employees dining, all of which provide opportunity for the 
skillful to listen and learn. If it was only listening, when the artful adversary 
engages your employees in conversation, the elicitation begins. Scientists, engineers, 
and developers, individuals who are more skillful in their respective technology 
than in social discourse, are prime targets, as like most of the populace of the 
world they too are pleased when listened to and heard. The innocent employee 
guided through the conversation by a malevolent interlocutor can and 
unfortunately often will provide more information than they should.
■ Monitoring of “roommate wanted” advertisements. In the initial minute of 
conversation the adversary can determine if the population of the abode 
with the vacancy comprises personnel from within the enterprise of interest. 
If yes, they pursue; if not they move on to the next advertisement. What 
happens with a “yes?” The adversary’s cohabitation with the employee provides 
unlimited opportunity to view your employee’s remote work habits and 
interactions. When the bond of trust is established, the conversations and 
comparisons of respective technologies can and will occur.
■ Monitoring of the Public Relations announcements detailing wins, new 
technologies, new hires, and so forth, may provide the adversary with leads to 
individuals or simply locations where the adversary may be able to engage 
some elementary surveillance to determine where employees can be engaged.
These are just a few of the many avenues available to observe, elicit, and listen 
about how the enterprise operates and put together a more expansive brief, to enable 
the exploitation of the illicitly obtained userid/password.
The human-to-human aspect, unfortunately, doesn’t end there. What of the 
employee who has been suborned? A willing and collaborative employee can boost, 
exponentially, the success ratio of the determined adversary in as much as they are on 
the other side of the technological barriers; they are knowledgeable of the infrastructure 
and the navigation procedures. Perhaps more importantly, once armed with the 
adversary’s needs they can utilize their access to dig and sift through the various 
nooks and crannies of the enterprise.
In an earlier chapter, we spoke of how the individual is one of the nexus of the 
entrée to your enterprise, whether or not you wish to acknowledge such. We reiterate 
this point and emphasize this point, and urge you to involve yourself and empower 
your managers to involve themselves in investing and knowing in the work-life

balance of your employee base, train in the art of listening and inquiry so as to better 
increase the odds that your employees know how to react and act when confronted 
with that unscrupulous adversary, offering inducements and attractive alternatives in 
the hopes of inducing them to break their trust with your enterprise.
Please realize that there are no shortages of unscrupulous organizations willing to 
break all the rules to gain competitive advantage over their competitors in the marketplace. 
And that motivation constitutes the greater threat, as both the Hewlett-Packard 
scandal and the following case study show.
The Mysterious Social 
Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
Someone called an ofﬁ ce in a major northern European city, assuming the identity of 
an actual employee of Entity Y, and tried to elicit employee contact list information 
for an ofﬁ ce in another northern European city. But the request was turned down.
NOTE
As we wrote about Entity X, just consider “Entity Y” an appellation ascribed 
to an aggregate of enlightening events and insightful experiences gained in 
our work with some of the global giants. And remember, as in the disclaimer 
often stated at the beginning of novels or movies, any resemblance to any 
actual person or organization is purely coincidental.
Several days later, a caller, using the same false identity, obtained the coveted 
contact list from an Entity Y ofﬁ ce in Eastern Europe, from an employee who 
believed they were speaking to the identiﬁ ed employee.
A month later, an unsuccessful attempt is made to elicit client lists from an Entity Y 
employee in the Western USA.
Three days later, impersonating an employee from the UK and claiming a laptop 
malfunction, someone called an Entity Y ofﬁ ce in Canada and requested complete 
contact information for the same Northern European ofﬁ ce targeted in the initial attack.
The caller claimed to be working on an engagement with an actual client of 
Entity Y and requested that the information he needed be e-mailed to a private 
e-mail account. One of the ﬁ rst tangible clues.

Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
The next day, someone impersonating an Entity Y employee from the UK called 
an Entity Y ofﬁ ce on the Mediterranean. He claimed his laptop was malfunctioning 
and requested complete contact information for same Northern European ofﬁ ce as 
well as one other in the Northern European region.
Two days later, in the Balkans, a second Entity Y employee succumbs to the elicitation 
and provides the caller with an Excel spreadsheet with the requested information. Again, 
from an employee who believed they were speaking to a colleague.
The next day, the attacker calls back and requests further information. But this 
second solicitation is rebuffed, as the employee has reﬂ ected on the totality of the 
provision of the spreadsheet.
The next day, someone, again impersonating an Entity Y employee, called the 
Northern European ofﬁ ce directly, saying she was on assignment in Central Europe 
and requested the client list. The request was refused.
The next day, an Andean ofﬁ ce received a telephone request for information on 
personnel in an ofﬁ ce in a major North American city. This elicitation was successful.
In the ensuing weeks, similar calls eliciting conﬁ dential information were received 
in numerous Entity Y ofﬁ ces in Africa, the Balkans, the Baltic, North America, and 
Asia Paciﬁ c. There were over 30 documented incidents, targeting dozens of ofﬁ ces on 
six continents. Several of them were successful. All of the callers impersonated Entity 
Y employees, all of the callers claimed their laptops were malfunctioning, and all of 
the callers sought speciﬁ c, targeted information about various groups and individuals 
within Entity Y and its clients.
Who were the attackers? What were they really looking for? What was their 
ultimate objective?
The counterintelligence component of Entity Y’s global security team launched 
an investigation. The investigation showed that the adversary targeting Entity Y on a 
global basis, had done their homework and covered their trails. The telephone 
numbers used to call into Entity Y were non-traceable. The e-mail addresses provided, 
ostensibly as a personal e-mail address of a colleague, were found to be throw-away 
Web-based e-mail accounts. The callers were both male and female, with South 
African and/or British accents.
The investigation did not identify the adversary and the leads developed were 
insufﬁ cient to warrant and justify bringing in law enforcement entities, as all that 
Entity Y really had were individuals calling into their enterprise, identifying themselves 
as an employee, and requesting the provision of information. What would law 
enforcement suggest? Perhaps, make Entity Y personnel more aware of elicitation 
and manipulation techniques that come at Entity Y via the telephone.

So let us focus on the countermeasures that the global security team recommended 
be undertaken.
Bulletins were sent out only to human resources personnel in the initial stages of 
the investigation but then later on, when there was no longer any reason to remain 
discrete, the bulletins were sent to all employees, thus ensuring 100 percent of the 
workforce were cognizant of the activity being experienced elsewhere in the enterprise 
and were thus on their guard.
The bulletins were to be disseminated to all personnel via e-mail and posted on 
all Entity Y intranets in a high-visibility spot.
A letter from the Global HR Director was proposed. This letter was to be issued 
simultaneously, providing context, pointing to the bulletins and the linked instructions. 
This letter was to underscore the importance of following the security team’s 
admonishments. Like the bulletins, the letter was to be disseminated to all personnel 
via e-mail and also be posted on all Entity Y intranets in a high-visibility spot.
Regional conference calls with HR managers were to be held by the responsible 
HR leaders, in coordination with the global security team. The global security team 
was to provide presentation materials, brief the conference call participants on the 
nature of the elicitation attacks, explain the proper procedures for dealing with such 
encounters, answer questions, and discuss related issues.
The ongoing attacks underscored the importance of all ofﬁ ces adopting the available 
awareness and education resources (e.g., an e-learning module, an electronic newsletter, 
a new hire orientation presentation, annual on-site events), since these resources provided 
guidance, suitable for general audiences, on how to deal with such attacks.
The global security team also vowed that the next generation of awareness and 
education resources would include a workshop for human resources and Help desk 
personnel, as well as executive support staff, which would go into elicitation attacks 
and countermeasures in greater depth.
Guidance for the Workforce
The following instructions were developed by Entity Y’s global security team:
How to Recognize Elicitation
Here are some common elements in recent incidents:
■ The callers have identiﬁ ed themselves as Entity Y employees. The names they 
use are real employees. Sometimes these employees are out of the ofﬁ ce on 
holiday or client work, but sometimes they are not.

www.syngress.com
136 
Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
■ The caller usually claims to be working on a client project, and the client 
they name is actually an Entity Y client.
■ The caller asks for a listing of Entity Y employees in either a particular ofﬁ ce 
or a particular business line. The caller will make an excuse as to why they 
cannot get the information, usually that he or she is in an airport and is 
having computer problems.
■ The caller will ask that someone e-mail the list to him at both a valid internal 
Entity Y address and an external Web-based company like operamail.com.
■ The callers have all been male, with a British or South African accent.
■ Any time you are faced with a caller, usually without a valid caller ID, who asks 
for internal information of any kind, you should be suspicious of elicitation.
How to Handle the Caller
Here are some instructions on how to handle suspicious callers:
■ Do not give the caller what he asks for.
■ Do not give the caller any indication that you know what is happening.
■ Be evasive about how and when you can provide the information. Make an 
excuse for not providing the information immediately (e.g., “I have to get 
onto another call right now – you know how it is”).
■ Be friendly and open, as if nothing is amiss. Imply that the information will 
be forthcoming.
■ Ask for return voice contact information. Ask for the caller’s mobile number 
and his point of contact at the client. If the caller will not provide this 
information, it conﬁ rms that he is attempting to elicit information from you. 
If he provides the information, it does not mean he is not making an elicitation 
attempt.
How to Report the Incident
Here are some instructions on how to report suspicious callers:
■ Immediately report the incident to your regional HR director and the global 
security team.

www.syngress.com
 
Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y • Chapter 9 
137
When reporting the incident, please provide the following information:
■ The time and date of the call.
■ The speciﬁ c information the caller requested.
■ Any background noises you may have heard.
■ A description of the caller’s voice.
■ Any information the caller gives; employee name, client, phone numbers, and 
so forth.
Perhaps you ﬁ nd it hard to believe that your co-workers, friends, or family members 
could fall for such cons. But social engineering is very effective. The psychological 
techniques are powerful and technologies are getting increasingly sophisticated.
NOTE
See Appendix F, which contains the U.S. Department of Justice questionnaire that 
may be used to report a loss of intellectual property within the United States.
General User-Oriented Guidance on 
How to Detect and Defeat Social Engineering
Here is a more generalized checklist developed to provide personnel with some ways 
to detect and defeat social engineering attacks:
■ Be alert for the telltale signs of a social engineering attack. Is the caller 
reluctant to provide contact information? Is the caller rushing you to provide 
the information they have requested? Is the caller name-dropping (i.e., using 
names of important people or even family members)? Is the caller trying to 
manipulate your emotions (e.g., fear, sympathy, ambition)? Has the caller 
made any small mistakes (e.g., misspellings, misnomers)?
■ Remember, an individual using the telephone as the instrument of engagement 
and social engineering methodology is always going to be playing on your 
emotions: The attacker might play on your fear, by using intimidation; or 
conversely the attacker might play on your desire to help others, by appealing 

www.syngress.com
138 
Chapter 9 • Case Study: The Mysterious Social Engineering Attacks on Entity Y
to your sympathy, or even on your ambition, your desire to get ahead, by 
impressing an important caller.
■ Verify the identity of callers. If you are suspicious and you cannot immediately 
identify them, insist on calling them back. If it is a legitimate call about 
security or some other sensitive issue, they will understand and appreciate 
your caution.
■ Do not answer unexpected or unusual requests for sensitive information 
unless you can verify the caller and the caller’s legitimate need. Don’t answer 
questions about other employees, particularly IT personnel, unless you can 
verify it is an authorized request. Do not provide information on your 
system or your own level of access (e.g., ID and password). Do not answer 
“questionnaires” or provide business information such as sales ﬁ gures, marketing 
plans, and so forth, unless you can verify it is an authorized request.
■ Don’t just shrug it off, sound the alarm. Report any suspicious encounters 
that you suspect may indeed be social engineering attacks immediately to 
the appropriate authorities within your ofﬁ ce or to the security ofﬁ ce It may 
be part of a pattern, but a pattern cannot be discerned without the sharing 
of experiences.

Chapter 10 • Personnel Security
Introduction
As the Haephrati case discussed in Chapter 1 illustrates, the theft of trade secrets and 
other intellectual property has expanded beyond classic industrial age espionage (largely 
focused on the turning of insiders) to include information age espionage (e.g., hacking 
into networks or using targeted malware). And it is also true, as has been previously 
noted, that the severity of the insider threat is often disproportionately emphasized in 
relation to the severity of the outsider threat.
Nevertheless, much illegal activity, particularly in the arenas of economic espionage 
and trade secret theft, is still predicated on, or instigated by, insiders of one kind or another. 
Furthermore, this is true regardless of whether the criminal behavior is cyber-based 
or grounded in the physical world.
Four stories from the United States, Korea, and Canada (all of which broke within 
a period of several weeks in 2006) underscore both the threat from inside, and its diverse 
manifestations:
“The U.S. attorney in Detroit … announced charges of stealing trade 
secrets against three former employees of an auto supplier, saying 
economic espionage stabs at the heart of the Michigan economy 
and is a growing priority among his federal prosecutors. The former 
employees of Metaldyne Corp., arraigned in U.S. District Court after 
a 64-count grand jury indictment was unsealed, are accused of 
stealing the Plymouth, Mich., company’s trade secrets and sharing 
them with Chinese competitors. They each face up to 20 years in 
prison and ﬁ nes of up to $250,000 if convicted. Metaldyne, which 
has 45 plants in 14 countries, makes a wide range of auto parts for 
engines, drive trains and chassis systems. The company has annual 
sales of $2 billion and about 6,500 employees.” (Trade-secret theft 
charged in Detroit, Baltimore Sun, 7-6-06)
“US authorities last night charged three people with a cloak-and-
dagger scheme to sell secrets from Coca-Cola to soft drink arch-
rival PepsiCo, which helped in the investigation … . The offer of 
‘conﬁ dential’ information from Coca-Cola sparked an FBI investiga-
tion with an undercover agent offering $US1.5 million dollars in cash. 
The investigation was launched after PepsiCo turned over to its cola 
rival a letter in May from a person identifying himself as ‘Dirk,’ 
who claimed to be employed at a high level with Coca-Cola and 
offered ‘very detailed and conﬁ dential information,’ a US Justice 
Department statement said. According to authorities, an FBI 

www.syngress.com
 
Personnel Security • Chapter 10 
141
undercover agent met on June 16 with Dimson, who was posing 
as ‘Dirk’ at Hartsﬁ eld-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. 
Dimson gave the agent ‘a brown Armani Exchange bag containing 
one manila envelope with documents marked ‘highly conﬁ dential’ 
and one glass bottle with a white label containing a liquid product 
sample,’ the statement said.” (FBI lays charges on Coke secrets, 
The Australian, 7-6-06)
“About a half of Korea’s top technology ﬁ rms have suffered from 
leaks in industrial know-how one way or another over the past 
three years, although the companies have increased preventive 
measures, a report showed. According to the report released the 
Korea Industrial Technology Association on Monday, 11 of 20 Korean 
ﬁ rms that had invested the most in research & development have 
suffered ﬁ nancial damage due to technology leaks in the past 
three years. When taking into account smaller ﬁ rms, 20.9 percent 
out of 459 ﬁ rms said that they suffered from industrial espionage 
cases during the period. The rate is 6.4 percentage points higher 
than three years ago, meaning that ﬁ rms have become more 
vulnerable to technology theft … . As Roh pointed out, about 
65 percent of the reported cases were found to involve employees 
from former companies. Only 18 percent and 16 percent of the 
cases involved current employees and subcontractors of the ﬁ rms, 
respectively… The survey was done on 459 ﬁ rms with in-house 
R&D departments.” (Cho Jin-seo, Half of Top Tech Firms Suffer 
Leaks, Korea Times, 6-19-06)
“Intelligence ﬁ les reportedly suggest that an estimated 1,000 Chinese 
agents and informants operate in Canada. Many of them are visiting 
students, scientists and business people, told to steal cutting-edge 
technology. An example being touted as copied technology is 
China’s Redberry—an imitation of the Blackberry portable e-mail 
device, created by Waterloo, Ont.-based Research in Motion Ltd … . 
Juneau-Katsuya said the former Liberal government knew of the 
espionage, but were too afraid to act. ‘We didn’t want to piss off 
or annoy the Chinese,’ said Juneau-Katsuya, who headed the 
agency’s Asian desk. ‘(They’re) too much of an important market.’ 
However, he argued that industrial espionage affects Canada’s 
employment levels. ‘For every $1 million that we lose in intellectual 
property or business, we lose about 1,000 jobs in Canada,’ he said.” 
(Robert Fife, Government “concerned” about Chinese espionage, 
CTV.ca News, 4-14-06)

Chapter 10 • Personnel Security
Without a robust, twenty-ﬁ rst century Personnel Security program, it won’t matter 
how much or how well you invest in Information Security, or how fool-proof and 
high-tech your Physical Security has become, because the perpetrators that will take 
advantage of your weak or nonexisting Personnel Security program will already be 
inside both your physical and cyber perimeters.
In this chapter, we will highlight some of the most important aspects of what should 
be in your enterprise’s Personnel Security program, including an overall checklist of 
the top 20 controls mapped to ISO, and guidelines for background checks (Figure 10.1 
illustrates the “hit ratio”—the information discrepancies uncovered during background 
screening), data, termination procedures, and a travel security program.

Chapter 10 • Personnel Security
Two Important Caveats
■ Of course, in regard to many of these recommended termination policies and 
procedures, there will exceptions. But they too must be subject to procedures, 
and require high-level authorization. Furthermore, not all employment ends 
in hostile termination, many separations are amicable, and there are some that 
are orderly, expected, and even scheduled. Nevertheless, the issues surrounding 
how a person leaves employment are just as important as the issues surrounding 
how they are brought into the enterprise’s workforce.
■ Whether or not to accelerate an employee’s separation from the enterprise when 
the employee has given notice is a subject of some debate. If the employee is 
going to a competitor’s organization, it is considered “safer” to place the 
employee on administrative leave for a period of two weeks when accepting the 
resignation rather than have the person remain inside the enterprise’s perimeter. 
The rationale is that there is powerful temptation to pocket data points, which 
although obtained and garnered with the resources of the current employer, 
would be of great interest to the “new employer.” Indeed, unscrupulous 
employers may intimate to the new hire that success may be dependent upon 
the provision of your enterprise’s intellectual property. We suggest that it is always 
best to be mindful of whom your competition is, and make all such decisions 
judiciously.
And Everywhere in between: 
Guidelines for Travel Security 
and Executive Protection Programs
No aspect of a comprehensive enterprise security program offers a more compelling 
argument for a holistic approach than issues related to travel security and executive

Chapter 11 • Physical Security: The “Duh” Factor
Introduction
If you have ever debriefed a hacker, or an industrial spy, or even a penetration tester 
working for the good guys, you will know that the ﬁ rst attempt any of them make is 
to simply walk through a door, whether at the front or the back of the facility. Well, 
perhaps they will dumpster dive prior to the direct assault. But certainly, an attacker, 
whether intent on breaking into your information systems, stealing your trade secrets, 
or demonstrating how easy it is to do either, will always probe your physical perimeter 
before either going cyber (e.g., gaining unauthorized network access or planting a 
Trojan to collect data) or even psychological (i.e., using social engineering techniques).
That’s why we call physical security the “Duh” Factor. It is so easy to overlook or 
take for granted. And when you do, you invariably get burned. That’s when people 
slap their foreheads and cry out, “Duh!”
Are You Owned?
How the Pros Do It
When we asked an industrial security penetration tester what his approach 
would be to conducting a penetration test speciﬁ cally targeting intellectual 
property and trade secrets, one consultant responded:
“I would physically target hardware, laptops, servers, and backup media … 
and simply clone them en masse. I have done this countless times during “pen 
testing” where I simply sneak into the area, clone every computer of interest, 
and haul all of it off site. In other cases I simply grab the computer, and clean 
out everything that even remotely looked like a USB drive, external HD, CD, 
DVD, and ANYTHING that could even remotely contain conﬁ dential informa-
tion. Sometimes the actual removal of the computer is desirable, but sometimes 
it is better to copy all the drives. Then consolidate all of the information onto 
a single drive farm, and index all of the ﬁ les into a searchable data source. 
Yeah, I can get some of the same data by technically penetrating the com-
puter, or owning their network, but it is much more reliable to enter the area, 
grab the computers, open the HDD bay and clone the drive. Extra points if you 
remove the HDD and leave your business card taped to the HD bay, or attached 
to LCD screen. I have also copied the drive (which I removed), and then hammered

a steel dagger through the LCD screen or keyboard with a notice that I just 
cleaned them out. (I get a damage budget of maybe 50 k for the gig so I can 
break stuff) After hours I go to the outside of every executives ofﬁ ces (using 
a ladder if required) and try to read sensitive information which they may 
have left out on their desk, and use a camera to read documents they have 
left in view.
Hit the recycling bins in the executive area, harvest documents out of 
shedder or recycling boxes. Visit the server closet, remove or copy the hard 
drives from servers. Visit alarm controller, remove it, or at least steal the com-
puter connected to it. Ditto for the access control computers and video surveil-
lance systems. Clean out all tapes, backups, off line storage, or other media. 
Locate breakers for computer room/server room and the executive areas, 
remove the circuit breaker for their speciﬁ c areas, leave your card. Remove 
doors from executives’ ofﬁ ces, unscrew from wall, and remove their chairs 
so that they have to stand up for a few hours. Remove all ﬁ le cabinets … com-
pletely from the building.… Remove telephone headsets, leave the phone 
themselves. Extra points if your remove everything from the targeted ofﬁ ces, 
to include the doors, carpet, ceiling tiles, and install a milk crate and folding 
card table instead of their fancy desk. Leave their personal items on the desk, 
or place all personal items in a box in the center of the now stripped ofﬁ ce. 
On top of the box leave an envelope, and in the enveloped leave them a letter 
that you just owned them, and that they need to get more serious about 
security.
I would (and have) provided the over 800 hard drives of extremely sensi-
tive and classiﬁ ed information that they never knew they lost. I also try to 
weigh in with roughly 4,000 pounds of actual documents that I can pile up on 
a wall of the presentation room. I’ve actually rented semi-trucks to haul out 
the company, have grabbed entire mainframe computers, gutting complete 
server rooms, etc. Hit a defense contractor a couple of years ago, came across 
several huge caches inside the company (lots of classiﬁ ed documents), found 
that one of the executives/directors was stealing documents from one of their 
competitors, putting the CEO in a delicate position as he did the ethical thing 
and returned the stolen documents, and then offered up the head of the 
executive behind the thefts to the competition.”
Nor is physical security merely a “Guards, Guns, and Gates” mentality that sees to 
the strength of the physical perimeter. In the twenty-ﬁ rst century, it should extend to 
concerns about your road warrior’s mobile ofﬁ ce, as well as conditions at the facilities 
of your contractors and outsourcers, and even the circumstances of any of your 
enterprise’s storage media while in transit.

Two All-Too-Typical Tales of Woe
United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) has conﬁ rmed that the ﬁ nancial data of nearly 
4 million Citigroup Inc. customers has been lost … According to local media 
reports, Citigroup says UPS cannot account for computer tapes containing 
 personal information—including names, Social Security numbers, account 
numbers and payment history—of 3.9 million of its CitiFinancial customers, 
including information from closed accounts. UPS was transporting the tapes to 
a credit bureau when they were lost, according to the report…Citigroup says 
it will now encrypt ﬁ nancial data and send it electronically. (Secure Destruction 
Business On-Line, 6-7-05)
Users of the Bank of America Corp.’s Visa Buxx prepaid debit cards are 
being warned that they may have had sensitive information compromised fol-
lowing the theft of an unencrypted laptop computer. In a letter sent to Buxx 
users and dated September 23, the Charlotte, North Carolina, bank warned 
that customers may have had their bank account numbers, routing transit 
numbers, names and credit card numbers compromised by the theft. Visa Buxx 
is a prepaid credit card for teenagers that the Bank of America (BofA) stopped 
selling in January. The laptop, which belonged to an unnamed Bank of 
America “service provider” was stolen on August 29, said Diane Wagner, a 
BofA spokeswoman. The bank was notiﬁ ed of the theft on September 9, and 
began sending out the letters after a two-week investigation, she said. Though 
the information on the laptop would not have been easily accessible to 
thieves, it was not encrypted, Wagner said. She would not name the service 
provider, say how many BofA customers had been affected or even conﬁ rm 
that the theft had occurred within the U.S…This is not the ﬁ rst time BofA has 
had to notify account holders of identity theft. In March, it conﬁ rmed that 
information on about 60,000 of its customers had been stolen by an identity-
theft ring. The March disclosure came just a month after BofA revealed that it 
had lost digital tapes containing the credit card account records of 1.2 million 
U.S. federal employees. (IDG, 10-7-05)

Does your enterprise conduct com-
prehensive threat assessments, on 
an annual basis, for all facilities in 
order to identify and prioritize risks?
Do your enterprise’s local security 
managers, or those otherwise 
responsible for security at the local 
level, regularly interface with 
embassy or consulate, local law 
enforcement, and your enterprise’s 
own global security team on a 
regular basis to review vis-à-vis 
threats or other developments 
that would impact security?
Continued
Such twenty-ﬁ rst century physical security issues underscore the need for a holistic 
approach.
Mitigating the physical security vulnerabilities introduced by the road warrior’s 
mobile ofﬁ ce is dependent largely on awareness and education; e.g., you can supply 
your business travelers with laptop cable locks, but getting them to use them both 
consistently and cleverly is a very different challenge.
Seeing to the security posture of contractors and outsourcers demands that your 
enterprise has made a meaningful, organizational commitment to an intellectual property 
protection program and that no agreements will be signed without assurances that 
the security programs of contractors and outsourcers is adequate, and that processes 
for veriﬁ cation and review have been established.
The physical security of storage media, e.g., tapes and disks, in transit via third-party 
shipping companies, and so forth can only be adequately addressed by implementing a 
cyber security control, i.e., encryption. Table 11.1 is an IP protection program assessment 
for physical security.

Chapter 12 • Information Security
Introduction
There is a wise saying in Tibet: “As a thing is viewed, so it appears.”
This is true of anything and everything. And it is an exhortation to intellectual 
honesty. Unless you can look beyond your own biases, they warp your perceptions. 
Indeed, unless you can achieve some clarity beyond your personal biases, they will 
defeat themselves in the pursuit of their primary purposes—your own best interests.
As information security is viewed, so it appears.
To a policy wonk, it may look like a robust body of well-crafted, well-calibrated 
policies and standards. To a technologist, it may look like an intricate web of sophisticated 
programs, schemes, and devices—trip wires, honey pots, ﬁ rewalls, intrusion detection, 
encryption, and so on.
To some, policies and standards equal information security. To others, technology 
equals information security. Still others say awareness and education equal information 
security. Some would say budget dollars equal information security.
Of course, although these narrow, biased perceptions of what matters most, or best 
deﬁ nes information security, reﬂ ect the predilections and preoccupations of different 
subcultures within the ﬁ eld, none of them are accurate on their own.
But what is perhaps even more important is that no combination of them in and of 
themselves articulates what is most important about information security, or best deﬁ nes 
what it is. In other words, policies and standards plus technology plus awareness and 
education plus budget dollars does not equal information security either. If all you do is 
add up the sum total of these parts, they still do not constitute information security. There 
is an X factor still missing in the equation.
This X factor is the human factor.
There has to be an enlightened vision behind it all, imbuing it with clarity of mind. 
There has to be a consciousness that attends both to the big picture and the smallest 
details simultaneously.
Within the overall holistic vision of what your intellectual property protection 
program should look like and how it should all work together, information security 
compliments, resonates with, and ampliﬁ es personnel security, physical security, and all 
the other vital elements. And similarly, within information security itself, numerous vital 
aspects must be not only activated but also integrated into a living whole.
In short, there has to be a plan, but there also has to be a vision. There has to be a 
vision, but there also has to be a will. And these three have to be informed by experience 
and knowledge of both the facts on the ground and the direction of developing trends.

Keeping this essential caveat in mind, in this chapter, you will ﬁ nd some ideas on 
what kinds of controls should be in place across the broad spectrum of information 
security concerns. No list is comprehensive, because the whole is a moving, evolving 
target. But if the controls, processes, protocols, policies, and standards outlined here 
are implemented, you will no doubt signiﬁ cantly narrow the scope of your enterprise’s 
exposure to the multifarious risks, threats, and vulnerabilities of cyberspace. Table 12.1 
assesses an enterprise’s use of information classiﬁ cation as part of an IP Protection

The Intelligent 
Approach

Chapter 13 • The Intelligent Approach
Introduction
Why should any consideration be given to having an intelligence function within an 
enterprise? If one exists, what should be the remit of the individual or unit? How should 
this intelligence component integrate into a holistic program; what should it look like?
First, as with every other component, your organization’s commitment, made 
tangible in budget dollars and warm bodies, will in large part determine the scope 
and reach of your intelligence program. With a modicum of funding, a great deal can 
be accomplished, both from an enterprise protection perspective, as well as enhancing 
the operational side of the equation. Initial seed funds, expended in acquiring the 
correct talent with the appropriate background, can catapult an enterprise from being 
largely blind both offensively and defensively, to an enterprise which is seemingly 
gifted with a high degree of prescience.
In many organizations, there will be a struggle in the convincing of decision-makers 
that there is need for an intelligence component.
Where such an intelligence team would report within an organization, and how 
much money it would have in its budget, will vary.
In some organizations, you may win approval for only one warm body, and with 
that warm body you will have 100 percent more than most organizations. (Few 
organizations will ﬁ eld a team.)
This individual or team should have a budget ranging from tens of thousands to 
one-hundred thousand dollars to allow access to relevant third-party information feeds, 
some sold as intelligence feeds, others as news aggregators, and still others as market 
research. Couple these feeds with the myriad of other sources and resources available, 
and one person can be an effective force multiplier, providing that person is properly 
schooled in the acquisition, distillation, compilation, and presentation of the information, 
in a succinct manner which addresses the identiﬁ ed audience(s) within the enterprise.
As noted, this individual will monitor the ﬂ ow of information, call it intelligence 
in security-related areas such as travel risk, cyber risk, and incidental risk, as well as 
provide data points for the effective and efﬁ cient operation of the enterprise by 
focusing on various economic factors (e.g., global markets, mergers and acquisitions, 
research and development, and competitive information).
With an intimate knowledge of your organization’s operations, and an understanding 
of both the strategy and direction that has been plotted by the executive leadership, 
this individual could provide a variety of intelligence products in the form of monthly, 
weekly, and daily high-level brieﬁ ngs for executives based on their individual needs. 

www.syngress.com
 
The Intelligent Approach • Chapter 13 
229
In addition, the operations-level risk summaries as well as timely ad hoc travel threat 
advisories will have great utility for the general corporate populace.
Such internal products should include analysis of the risk, threat, opportunities, or 
challenges on global, regional, or local scales, and of how they speciﬁ cally relate to 
the organization’s operations or direction, as well as recommendations on how, if 
possible, to mitigate the risks and threats and overcome the challenges, while taking 
advantage of any opportunities.
As noted, few organizations are able to staff an intelligence unit consisting of 
several warm bodies with the ﬁ at to develop a robust program. Most enterprises 
begin lean and then expand upon establishment of credibility and value added.
In a perfect world, the executive leadership of the organization as a whole would 
have access to the following types of information, provided via the intelligence function:
■ Status updates on competitors
■ Market assessments
■ Market composition
■ Corporate share of the overall market
■ Projected market expansions/contractions
■ Intellectual property protection assessments
■ By country
■ Current and pending litigation having a possible effect on the enterprise
■ By relevant industry
In a perfect world, they would have a team of individuals designated to focus 
on discrete portions of the ﬂ ow from these disparate, proprietary sources, and one 
individual or one sub-set of the team to break down, analyze, aggregate, and integrate 
these disparate elements, and then relate the whole to the organization’s circumstances 
and prospects. This end result would in turn become intelligence product to be presented 
to the corporate leadership.
The intelligence function (i.e., provision of the information the enterprise needs 
to function efﬁ ciently and competitively) is sector dependent, industry dependent 
within the sector, market dependent, and geographically dependent.
With those parameters, you can determine the amount of investment you want to 
make in such an intelligence function; e.g., someone who has a company with a 

www.syngress.com

Chapter 13 • The Intelligent Approach
market limited to Wisconsin is going to pay attention to all comers in Wisconsin, and 
maybe in Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan, but he or she is probably not going to 
pay much attention to anywhere else, unless the business is vulnerable to competition 
coming in via the Internet, where geography is not a determinate of success.
With those parameters, you can determine the amount of investment you want to 
make in such an intelligence function; e.g., someone who has a company with a 
market limited to Wisconsin is obliged to pay attention to all comers in Wisconsin, 
and maybe in Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan, but he or she is probably not going 
to pay much attention to the activities of similar enterprises anywhere else, unless the 
enterprise is engaged in business which can be conducted over the Internet.
The Intelligence Function 
As an Internal Early Warning System
An additional function, which the intelligence component can perform, is adding to 
protecting the enterprise. In order to provide appropriate analysis, the enterprise and 
the intelligence director and his or her team should have access to what is the baseline 
on spectrum of activities, and so forth, so that what isn’t baseline can be identiﬁ ed and 
examined (i.e., the anomalous).
Imagine a control panel with levers zero to ten on all the functions in your 
company. If everything is running at normal, it should be around ﬁ ve, signiﬁ ed by the 
color blue. But when something glitches, it should either go down or up from the 
baseline, i.e., it should go either red or green on the control panel, and that should 
trigger an inquiry.
Let us say, for example, that manufacturing is producing at two times normal 
capacity; that would turn green on your control panel. It could be a positive event. 
But it would trigger an inquiry. Why are we there?
Well, it should correlate to your book to build. Perhaps you have a backlog of 
orders. But if that production ramps up and the book to build does not reﬂ ect any 
such demand, it might be indicative of a fourth shift pumping out gray market. It is 
not counterfeit, because it is the real McCoy.
The same is true of sales efforts and the bidding processes. You would look for 
patterns that deviated from the baseline and then inquire into the contributing factors.
On a daily basis, the intelligence team is monitoring all of these baselines. And of 
course, they are also looking outside. What is going on with the competitors? What is 
going on in the business environment?

www.syngress.com
 
The Intelligent Approach • Chapter 13 
231
Many so-called competitive intelligence analysis are really only looking at products 
versus products. Very few of them actually compare the strategy and direction of 
companies versus other companies.
Your intelligence guru’s team could also be your focal point for putting together 
the equivalent of the virtual competitor team to test the postulations of the enterprise 
against the perceived strategies of its competitors. Professional sports teams scout their 
competition, and in some sports, practice against colleagues emulating the competitor’s 
strategies and tactics to good effect. Why do we see so little of this in the commercial 
enterprise?
The reality is the market may be growing, but it is ﬁ nite. There are only so many 
customer dollars available. It is in your interest to capture as large a share of that market, 
while protecting your intellectual properties. Your competitor will want to learn your 
go-to-market plan; you need to protect that data. Your competitor will want to know 
your research and development ﬁ gures. Protect that as well. The role playing and scenario 
techniques serve the enterprise that utilize these methods in a most positive manner, as 
it forces the enterprise to ask, “what if?” followed by, “now what?”
If Company A (i.e., yours) wishes to evolve a new product that does X and 
markets it in Location 2, how would Companies B, C, and D react?
Or conversely, Company B wishes to evolve a new product that does X, how 
does Company A react?
As stated, such scenarios can be analyzed and projected upon. What are your 
options?
In the real world, governments do the” if this then what” exercise all the time.
If you work in government, you are always looking at the hypothetical. Furthermore, 
you are not constrained by the outlandish. You just don’t spend as much time planning 
for the lower probabilities. But you have to plan for all events.
In many enterprises that we have looked into, there is no planning for any events 
at all; and in most of those that do plan for some types of events, the planning is 
generic and superﬁ cial.
In summary, in a perfect world, your intelligence director would be looking at 
all of these areas and highlighting potential challenges or opportunities. To Sales 
and Marketing, you could say, “Bingo! It looks like Company B is doing Y, you 
might want to pay attention.” To Manufacturing, you could say, “Bingo! It looks 
like production is up to x-percent. You might want the anti-counterfeit group to 
get out there and make sure we do not have a fourth shift pumping out product 
for the gray market.”

Chapter 13 • The Intelligent Approach
There are many things that you can measure to sense abnormality. The rate of 
employee turnover might tell you something. A sudden surge or decline in the rate 
of electricity used in a plant might tell you something. What is your run rate?
What Happens to a Million 
Grains of Sand in a Perfect Storm?
In the “Perfect Storm” conditions of economic espionage (i.e., where we ﬁ nd ourselves 
here in the early decades of the 21st century), it comes at you from different angles. 
Coming in with a brute force approach is not only highly alerting, it is also not very 
productive. But those who take the million grains of sand approach come in under 
the radar, and their targets do not even notice they are losing anything. Your secrets 
exist a little at a time, instead of all at once.
Are you losing your intellectual property or your information assets? Do the 
people within your organization even know the difference?
In the corporate parlance, intellectual property generally means your trademarks 
and that which you patent. But losing information assets (e.g., your RFIs, your go to 
market plans, your personnel ﬁ les, your compensation ﬁ les, your health ﬁ les, your 
beneﬁ t structure, your options functions, all of the kinds of information that make 
the enterprise run) can have just as deleterious effect on your enterprise as losing 
your patent, perhaps more.
Sometimes the force differentiator between an efﬁ cient company and a highly 
efﬁ cient company is how they do their backbone infrastructure and how they handle 
employees’ day-to-day needs.
In our view, that differentiation and how it occurs could be construed as something 
worthy of protection, because it is your organic culture that makes your enterprise 
different and better than your competitor’s. You want to advertise your efﬁ ciency in the 
way you do business, but you do not want to advertise the content of it. So if in the 
world of economic espionage, people were focusing on acquiring your methodologies, 
that’s going to be easy, because you advertise them. But if they want to acquire your 
content, it is your culture that has to prevent them from succeeding. People should be 
empowered to talk about processes, unless those processes are your differentiation. 
We are talking about administrative processes, not functional processes (e.g., a process 
on how to create a widget is worthy of protection, but the fact that you outsource your 
production of widgets isn’t necessarily worthy of protection).

www.syngress.com
 
The Intelligent Approach • Chapter 13 
233
Similarly, in some instances you may want to keep from the public spotlight 
whom you are using as a contracted manufacturer or outsourced resource. In all cases 
you must impose upon your external partners the same level of protection you place 
on your data and processes, make no assumptions. Manage your own expectations; by 
managing the level of protection expected and then audit, inspect, and adjudicate 
if found lacking. Generally speaking, that which is measured is accomplished, so 
an inspection regime found to be not only hollow in implementation, but also in 
remediation, may place your enterprise at risk.
Some companies have sales successes that are graded as “excellent,” when in fact they 
could have actually got “outstanding,” except that unbeknownst to them, they had lost 
their market plan, and the information it yielded to the competition cut into their sales.
The plan was, “We’re going to go in and ask for ten,” but the person you are 
negotiating with knows your break-even point is seven. As they have learned your 
go-to-market plan via one of your outsourced marketing team, who himself was a 
contracted resource with his feet planted in both your camp and that of your customer. 
Your customer does not want to dig into seven, because they know they have the 
inside track and they want to ensure that they take no action which may put that 
valuable resource in jeopardy, so they allow you an eight. You’re happy and they’re 
very happy because they just saved themselves two. And you are none the wiser, as 
you never knew they knew what your break-even point was and therefore you 
negotiated appropriately. They were hardball with you—six, six, six—knowing that 
there was no deal unless you got them up to seven, but then they allowed you to 
make a proﬁ t by going to eight, and kept you in the game. They knew what was 
going on all along. That is reality. You need to protect yourself against this reality.
But if you are doing analysis on the methodologies that your customers are using, 
whether corporate or governmental, and you are measuring it (e.g., by asking “What 
are the tactics being used here?”), you might pick up an early warning indicator.
The negotiating tactics of a customer might give you a tip-off that they know 
more about you than you do. Conversely, consistently losing bids might be a tip-off 
that your competition or your customer is selling your bid information.
In sales, you need to protect your response to quotations, because if put in your 
competitors’ hands it can be used to underbid you, and to manipulate their bid to 
your detriment. Likewise, if your customer gets a hold of this information, it can 
also be used to your detriment. The individual instances usually do not constitute 
far-reaching losses. They are most often incremental losses, particularly in the large-scale 

www.syngress.com
234 
Chapter 13 • The Intelligent Approach
service provider industry, or in national infrastructure projects, where the deal 
includes one buy and options for six more years worth.
When you have, as you do in so many industries today, partners doing your core 
work (i.e. outsourcing), you end up in a morass in which you must trust your partner 
to protect your goods and intellectual property just like you would. You must ask 
yourself, are you achieving expectations with that partner, or not? And indeed, are 
you exceeding expectations in your dealings with them? In Corning’s case, their 
relationship with their partner is what saved them. It was their partner’s valuing of 
the relationship, and their highly ethical business practices that enabled Corning to be 
aware that the subterfuge has occurred.
The Partnership Issue Is a Daunting 
Force-Multiplier, Double-Edged Sword
The investment in the partnership has to be commensurate with the loss that the 
partner could cause you. This investment is not so much in money, as it is in time 
spent in building relationship; it is taking the time to build the trust, and thus level 
the expectations. If, for example, you are relying on a partner for manufacturing and 
they roll slowly on you, there is a potential downside.
But it could be even worse. If they sell your intellect to a competitor, and suddenly 
your competitor leapfrogs your advance because they ﬁ gured out what you did while 
you were still rolling slow in production, then you win, they win, you lose (i.e., you 
have won the battle but lost the war).
You have to engage in ongoing Corporate Relationship Management (CRM). 
Whether you call them partners, or consultants, or they are part of your network in 
terms of interconnectivity, you have to get in there and maintain the relationship 
with all of those individuals and entities that interact with your core.
Consultants are of particular concern because they learn from you, they leave you, 
they jump to another company, and out the door your intellectual property goes.
In sum, you must take steps to know who is working on your behalf. Demand 
background checks; demand to see the results of the background checks of all aspects 
of your workforce. Governments do this all the time; they demand individuals with 
whom they are engaging, and will have access to the respective nation’s sensitive data 
to acquire “security clearance.” In most instances, this involves a comprehensive 
self-declaration of data from the individual, followed by an even more comprehensive 

www.syngress.com
 
The Intelligent Approach • Chapter 13 
235
background and indices checks by the government entity. The individual is allowed 
access to the data when and only when the “clearance” is issued.
Far too often, enterprises utilize the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as if it was 
an ironclad mechanism by which disclosure or abuse of your data sets is prohibited. 
The reality is that the NDA allows you a reasonable chance of success in a court of law. 
But the true reality is that when you appear in the court of law, the damage more 
than likely has already occurred.
Your NDA is the means by which you keep the toothpaste in the tube. The 
enforcement of the NDA is the action you take when the toothpaste is on the table; 
it does not get the toothpaste back in the tube. Therefore, the goal is to avoid the 
opportunity to allow toothpaste out of the tube.
You must ensure your price points are protected data: audit the data; monitor 
the deal; monitor the customer negotiating and buying patterns; monitor your 
outsourced resources; and so forth. All of which is possible, though most are not 
utilized due to both the level of difﬁ culty, as well as the limited resources.

Protecting 
Intellectual Property

Chapter 14 • Protecting Intellectual Property in a Crisis Situation
Introduction
Business continuity, disaster recovery, and crisis management are vital aspects of your 
enterprise’s overall security program. The primary concerns are, of course, the safety 
of your people and the rapid resumption of your operations either in the same locale 
or elsewhere.
But in regard to intellectual property and trade secret theft, another dimension 
often receives insufﬁ cient attention: protection of your data while in the midst of 
a crisis.
Your IT professionals should have an inventory of all your enterprise’s information 
assets in any given area at any given time.
They should also have a replication of all those assets in a geographically separated 
area in the event the primary location is destroyed. In a perfect situation this replication 
would be accomplished via a real-time process conﬁ gured for automatic switchover.
But it is not simply a question of not losing the information, or of how quickly 
you can get your information systems up and running again; it is also a question of 
the potential exposure or misappropriation of information assets that are abandoned 
or otherwise compromised in the chaos prior to or in the immediate aftermath of 
an emergency evacuation or the destruction of a building.
If the emergency is an earthquake, you get zero warning.
If the emergency is a hurricane, you get weather reports.
If the emergency is a military incursion, you will probably hear the rattling 
of sabers.
As your enterprise’s champion of intellectual property (IP) and trade secret theft 
protection, you need to advocate a TEN-SEVEN-FIVE-THREE-ONE-NOW approach. 
If you had ten days’ notice, what could you do to protect your information assets? 
Now make a list assuming you had only seven days.
Next, working with the seven days’ list, you re-prioritize and develop a list of 
what you could do if you only have ﬁ ve days notice.
Likewise, make a list of what you can do with three days’ notice.
With one day’s notice, of course, you can do only the minimal. But the planning 
and prioritizing that goes into the process of working down from ten to one will 
ensure that you get the most out of that one desperate day.
And, of course, when disaster hits all of a sudden, right now, with no warning, it is 
a matter of self-preservation and assistance to those in your immediate environment.

hand, including both human and technological assets.
You have 15 desktop computers, all possessing critical intellectual property 
and new developmental work, such as the designs for the newest widget and 
so on. You also have three storage servers, one mail server, and one server 
used to allow employees to create a virtual private network into the branch 
ofﬁ ce when they are working in a mobile mode. You have 15 persons (14 regular 
staff and one visiting employee from your corporate headquarters).
You now must identify those items which require more than seven days 
to implement a protective regime (destruction, replication, relocation).
You should develop a list of protection measures you can take with 
10 days’ notice for the information assets at risk in any particular facility.
Then, working down from the 10-day list, you prioritize and draw up a list 
of what you can do if you only have seven days’ notice.
In Table 14.1 a plan is laid out for the ofﬁ ce itself, as well as for its vital 
IP elements, for example, desktop computers, the storage servers, the commu-
nications server, the corporate papers, and the personnel. Each inventoried 
element has a set of corresponding procedures to be enacted on the basis of 
amount of time remaining before the incident or disaster.

Chapter 14 • Protecting Intellectual Property in a Crisis Situation
On the ﬂ ip side, you also have to develop a plan for re-constitution from day zero 
to day ten. How long is it going to take to put it all back together? Far too often, the 
disaster preparedness planning stops when the “crisis” appears to have concluded, and 
then the reassembly isn’t conducted with the same level of planning. Once again, 
intellectual property is inadvertently put at risk.
You will also want to conduct a damage assessment that addresses, among other 
issues, whether there was or could have been exposure or compromise of IP or trade 
secrets.
If there is an earthquake, a zero notice event, and no one is in the ofﬁ ce at the time, 
the lines go down and your servers are sitting there unprotected. You can mitigate the 
danger to your data using some technological ﬁ xes, such as encryption of the server.
If you have a facility in an environment where earthquakes are prevalent but there 
are no hurricanes, you are less likely to have ten-day scenarios; most of your scenarios 
will be zero or one-day notice, so maybe you should consider using technology such 
as encryption to mitigate the fact that you will not get the opportunity to off-load in 
your most likely emergencies.
Of course, in environments such as Seattle, where you have earthquakes, heavy rains, 
and ﬂ ooding, as well as the threat of volcanoes and tsunamis, you have to anticipate 
and prepare for numerous scenarios.
When you chat with your colleagues about this issue, they will probably look at you 
as if you were a multi-horned beast. They will protest, “Who has the time to plan for 
all of that?” Our suggested response: “How can you afford not to?”
One reasonable compromise in such circumstances is to identify those locales most 
susceptible to day zero events in the disaster vectors—such as political hot spots, war 
zones, close proximity to fault lines, coastal areas vulnerable to hurricanes and tsunamis, 
inland areas prone to tornadoes—and address them as a priority.
But if you do not know what your inventory of information assets is, you do not 
know how long it will take to protect it.
You do not simply have to plan for protecting your data or destroying it; you also 
need to know how long it takes to do each of these tasks. You must realistically test 
your plan, within the context of personnel and infrastructure limitations; you won’t 
know if you can do what appears to be “impossible” unless you practice.
Answering these questions and putting a viable plan in place ensures that you are 
not a victim of haphazard processes, but rather are simply inconvenienced, since you 
planned ahead and created a solution to a potentially damaging situation.

There is more to it than being able to say, “Everyone is out alive, and we are up 
and running.”
The best crisis management planning demands that you think outside the box, 
and when you factor in protecting intellectual property during a crisis situation, you 
must stretch your mind even more.
NOTE
A building housing a conglomerate’s headquarters, in a developing country, 
burst into ﬂ ames in the middle of the night.
The ﬁ re brigade showed up and began to ﬁ ght the ﬂ ames. These were 
robust, physically imposing individuals, who fearlessly engaged the ﬁ re.
As the ﬁ re began to come under control, but while it still was unsafe to 
re-enter the building, a second wave of “ﬁ reﬁ ghters” arrived, looking similar 
to the ﬁ rst brigade. However, the attentive might have noticed that some of 
them were not as “ﬁ t.” These individuals had trouble scaling the ladder into 
the building and didn’t appear terribly happy to have been placed in this 
situation by their superiors.
The second wave of responders turned out not to be firefighters after all. 
They had bribed their way into the building in an attempt to obtain items of 
value (presumably documents and other important papers not destroyed by 
the fire) under circumstances in which the rightful owners could not notice 
and would assume that they had been destroyed rather than stolen.
If someone is targeting your intellectual property, and is watching your company 
closely, it is quite possible that that person would take advantage of your misfortune, 
particularly if your protection program were otherwise robust. Table 14.2 is an example 
of an IP protection program assessment for business continuity and crisis management.

Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
Introduction
Without executive commitment, your intellectual property protection program won’t 
go anywhere. Without a meaningful, tangible executive mandate, the populace within 
the enterprise will blow you off. You may be the recipient of some pleasant indulgence 
and some seemingly sincere lip service in the initial phases, but sooner or later your 
program will end up in the dustbin of institutional memory. People will say, “Oh yeah, 
someone tried that once. Nothing ever came of it, why would we want to make that 
mistake a second time?”
No one is going to change corporate culture, or “make more work” for his or her 
team, unless it is unmistakably clear that this is the will of the chief executive and 
the message is being consistently and repeatedly pushed downward throughout the 
enterprise. In sum, this initiative has to ﬂ ow from the top down; otherwise it is 
doomed to failure.
Our task is further complicated by the fact that no executive, whether C-level or at 
the entry level to the executive suite, is ever going to say, “No, security isn’t important 
to us, we don’t do everything possible to protect our intellectual property,” publicly 
or internally. Board members, shareholders, clients, business partners, industry analysts, 
consumer advocates, perhaps even the public at large would soon be clamoring for 
their heads. No, executives will always list the security of the enterprise’s people and 
intellectual property as one of his or her top priorities.
That means you are looking for something deeper. You are looking for a real 
commitment, a genuine understanding. You want to see the light switch go off, and you 
want that bright bulb to be seen from everywhere, from every cubicle, every assembly 
line, every test lab, and every conference room. Then and only then will you have 
what you desire: an integrated security program designed to protect the enterprise’s 
lifeblood, the intellectual property.
In order to have a successful security program, both senior and mid-level 
management must understand the value of the security program and use this value as 
a differentiator in their outreach to clients, customers, partners, and vendors. So how 
do we get from zero support by any within the enterprise to acceptance and 
embracement of the concept by management?
You need a mandate with teeth in it, muscle behind it, and mechanisms to project 
this mandate. To get such a mandate, you have to deliver a stellar presentation with an 

www.syngress.com
 
How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program • Chapter 15 
249
irrefutable, irresistible pitch. The chief executive or the executive staff must come away 
from your pitch both informed and engaged. More importantly, they must come 
away from your pitch understanding what is required.
In this chapter, we will go through a ﬁ ve-slide presentation, one by one, and inspect 
the various elements of each slide, examining what goes into each of the elements 
and how one slide leads to the next.
The slide presentation aims to assist you in your own presentation to your corporation’s 
leadership team, whether that is the executive suite, the board, or key principals, such 
as the CEO, CFO, and COO.
The immediate goal of such a presentation is to win executive commitment 
for your IP protection program. The ultimate goal is to change or enhance the corporate 
culture, so that every time employees speak of their activities, security of the 
intellectual property and of the enterprise as a whole is a “forethought” and not an 
afterthought. Employees will understand the overall value to the enterprise of having 
their research, development, manufacturing, sales, personnel, marketing, and the ﬁ rm’s 
products secured. To assist in this regard, as discussed in prior chapters, properly research 
and position the established body of policies and standards, as well as other resources, 
for them to rely on in the pursuit of an integrated, holistic security environment.
You are going to need to do your homework. You are going to have to take 
the concepts and principles outlined in this chapter, and the sample presentation it 
documents, and turn it all into a pitch and a presentation that is properly calibrated 
to your corporate culture, accurately reﬂ ects the facts on the ground in your business 
environment, and offers a reasonable and achievable path to success. It is often said 
that when Wall Street looks at a publicly traded conglomerate, it is like looking at an 
American Quarter Horse and the prospects for the horse’s success in the quarter-mile 
sprint. The reality is, your perspective must be that of the endurance race horse, prepared 
for the 50-mile ride. This journey through the process will entail both fact-ﬁ nding 
and thinking outside the box. Success rarely comes pre-packaged.
The fact that you are able to have this conversation is a very good sign that you, the 
implementer, have a reasonable expectation of success; now you have to demonstrate 
that your expectations can be actualized.
If you follow the logic, the analytical process, and the argumentation suggested 
here, you will improve your chances signiﬁ cantly. Remember, as Thomas Edison said, 
“Hell, there are no rules here—we are trying to accomplish something.”

Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
Questions to Ask and People to Approach
There are ﬁ ve questions, or perhaps more accurately, ﬁ ve areas of inquiry which 
require exploration and development of answers. These are:
1. What is your business differentiation from your competitors?
2. Who do you have to protect your intellectual property and differentiators 
from?
3. What are the probabilities in terms of likely vectors of threat, what would 
they target within your enterprise, and what would these adversaries have 
as their objectives?
4. If they succeeded in their objective (theft, tampering, destruction), what 
would the consequences be to the overall enterprise?
5. What countermeasures would be cost-effective and business-enabling, vice 
prohibitively expensive and disabling?
Notice in the second half of the title for this section, after “questions to ask,” we 
said “and people to approach” rather than “and who you need to answer them.” That is 
because it is unlikely that very many, if any, of the executives, managers, and individual 
contributors will have thought about what you are endeavoring to aggregate, analyze, 
and articulate.
The obvious business differentiators may be on the tip of everybody’s tongue, 
but you have to go deeper and cast a wider net. It is not enough to know that your 
corporation has the best product in a direct comparison to the competition or that the 
ﬁ rm’s advertising agency assisting the marketing and sales entities is more professional, 
experienced, and in-tune with the target audience for the products being sold and 
developed.
You must put your closed-ended questions into the dust bin and focus on the 
open-ended inquiries to get to the items worthy of protection. You have to look for 
the undetected, the unseen, and the unconsidered to grasp the situation in an accurate 
manner.
You certainly need to ask executives about what differentiates the enterprise from 
its competitors, but also ask your engineers, your programmers, your operations people, 
your sales and marketing professionals, your human resources professionals, maybe even 
your customer service or procurement people. While it clearly depends on the nature 
of your business, it is paramount that your engagement is as all-inclusive as possible.

www.syngress.com
 
How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program • Chapter 15 
251
What differentiates your business could be how you make your product, what 
goes into it, who makes it for you, or where it is made. If, for example, your ﬁ rm assisted 
a partner to enable the partner to make your product more efﬁ ciently, then perhaps 
that methodology is worthy of protection. Think of Henry Ford and his use of the 
assembly line in the automotive industry. Had he kept the concept and implementation 
of the assembly line “secret” would he have had competition on his heels as soon as 
he did? What other industries would not have evolved as quickly? It is a business 
decision to either protect or share methodologies.
What differentiates your product could be what you sell, how you sell it, who sells 
it for you. If you sell all your own products and have your own integrated work force, 
you may have greater control over the protection of your IP than if you used outside 
entities such as distributors, channel partners, vendors, or contracted sales forces.
What differentiates your product could be all of the above, and more. And it is 
this “more” which you must strive to identify.
All across the enterprise, there are people you will have to approach on your 
fact-ﬁ nding mission who won’t have thought much about the issues you are inquiring 
into beyond the cursory observation that they are good at what they do and are proud 
of their efforts and results. Therefore, they will have to be brought along; you will 
have to pluck it out of their heads or extrapolate it from their responses. What you 
are looking for is what differentiates your enterprise and its products and who would 
beneﬁ t from stealing it or causing it to fail.
You will also have to go outside the enterprise, to the World Wide Web, government 
resources, third party intelligence aggregators, industry analytic resources, individual 
subject matter experts, and more—particularly in regard to answering the second and 
third questions: who do you have to protect from and what bad could come from the 
successful compromise of the enterprise’s intellectual property.
Let’s look at each of these ﬁ ve areas of inquiry in more depth.
What Is Your Business 
Differentiation from Your Competitors?
What makes you different? Your people? Your processes? Your R&D? Your differentiation 
points are what you are declaring as worthy of protection.
Human resources policies and procedures, such as hiring practices, could 
make your enterprise unique. What about your compensation regime? 

www.syngress.com
252 
Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
Retention policy and leadership development could also be a source of 
differentiation, as well as future personnel needs and projections.
Research and development capabilities, level of investment, locale of investment, 
methodologies, personnel headcount, equipment allocation, and topics could 
be differentiators.
Manufacturing as a whole could be a differentiator. If you outsource, how do 
you integrate the third-party’s methodologies into your own? The Boeing 
Company had for years dictated to its manufacturing partners how components 
would be built and how these components would be integrated into its 
aircraft—it was the company’s differentiator. In 2007, Boeing introduced 
their newest aircraft, the Boeing 787 “Dreamliner,” and with this introduction, 
Boeing also introduced a paradigm shift away from dictating methodologies 
to collaborative and consultative engagement.1
Marketing and Sales also have data worthy of examination and perhaps will 
be a differentiator as well. As noted previously, is your level of investment in 
advertising and marketing campaigns indicative of other metrics within 
the enterprise? Are your marketing efforts in a given market based on your 
competition’s expected success in the market and designed to support your 
own success? How about your sales ﬁ gures, margins, discounts, client lists? 
All of these individually or collectively could differentiate you from your 
competition and thus are worthy of addressing as a potential differentiator.
Whom Do You Have to 
Protect These Differentiators From?
What are your points of vector, such as individual, competitor, organized criminal 
cartels, or state elements? Or is your enterprise threatened to some degree by all of 
them? The ﬁ rst step is to determine who would beneﬁ t from learning about any of 
these differentiators.
Individuals  This vector is often characterized as the “insider-threat,” but 
that is also a mischaracterization on the whole. That is not to say that the 
bona ﬁ de insider isn’t in a better position to capitalize on your data, etc., but 
that individuals outside the enterprise can use the previously identiﬁ ed 
methodologies to garner your intellectual property as a force multiplier for 
their individual efforts. Take for example the situation in China, which 

www.syngress.com
 
How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program • Chapter 15 
253
according to 2007 statistics has identiﬁ ed 86% of all software as counterfeit.2 
This isn’t just a theft of a company’s intellectual property in the creation of 
the counterfeit, from the individual perspective, but it is the cost savings in 
going down this path as the individual as they prepare to enter the competitive 
marketplace—if an individual doesn’t have similar infrastructure expenses as a 
similar enterprise, their cost of entry is reduced considerably. So we advocate 
looking from within and monitoring, auditing, and enforcing the need-to-know 
principal with your workforce, whether staff or contracted, but also being 
mindful of the individual not associated in any manner with your enterprise 
who may be looking for a quick point of entry into your market or the 
market of another.
Competitors  It is unfortunate, but the world is not a level playing ﬁ eld 
with respect to free-market competitive engagements. And thus competitors 
will fall into two categories: those who will exploit any edge, legal or illegal, 
and those who will only engage in legal activities to take you and your 
enterprise to task in the market place. You must defend against both. The 
former will invest and engage at whatever level they believe is required to 
garner the desired results. The latter will engage and exploit anything you 
project or inadvertently provide via public disclosure and their ability to 
extrapolate. For example, it is totally appropriate to engage trade show staff 
in conversation and lead the conversation down any rabbit-trail to drill 
for details on a company’s products. In this way, an ethical competitor may 
engage in ethical business practices advocated by the Society of Competitive 
Intelligence Professionals (SCIP),3 whereas others may exceed this ethical 
brief and attempt to coerce information from your staff with ﬁ nancial 
inducements or other under-the-table arrangements. In both cases, your 
inappropriately protected data lands in the hands of your competitor.
Criminal elements  These organizations have one goal—monetization. 
If there is a way they can manipulate your data systems to their ﬁ nancial 
advantage, through customer support, order mechanisms, or simply inducing 
an individual to share your intellectual property so that they may sell it to 
the aforementioned unscrupulous competitor, they usually will make the 
attempt.
State entity  As noted in previous chapter(s), it is almost impossible to stop 
a state entity when the nation’s resources have been allocated to compromise 

www.syngress.com
254 
Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
your intellectual property. That said, that does not mean that the boxing 
axiom does not apply—one does not lead with one’s chin. You need to be 
on top of which state entities may be interested in your technology and why. 
For example, will your technology assist an indigenous ﬁ rm who is your 
direct competitor? How is your technology being used by a geo-political 
competitor? It would surprise no one that during the Cold War, the former 
Soviet Union was very interested in the many commercial items used by the 
United States’ military forces; that same level of interest is being played out 
today from the Chinese perspective. Take for example the case of Chi Mak 
and Tang Wai Mak, both accused and indicted for sharing their employer’s 
data with the People’s Republic of China (PRC),4 data which would be of 
use to the PRC’s military.
What Are the Probabilities in Terms 
of Likely Attackers, Targets, and Objectives?
Remember the formula Keith Rhodes provided in our Virtual Roundtable of Experts?
Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Impact
The Threat = Adversary + Capability + Intent
The Vulnerability = Opportunity, and the Impact = Asset Value
Ask yourself, “Who would want it?” For example, we make sandals. The probability 
that any government would want to take our sandals is low; unless we have come up 
with something like a way to make a plastic sandal that would be market-shattering, 
and then perhaps they would want that information. Maybe we need to protect our 
fancy machinery or chemical processes. If I am a milk bottler, then perhaps I do not 
have to protect myself so much from state power, I just have to have a general Hazardous 
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program and a clean environment that 
would allow me to protect from everything (six years ago only three people in the 
USA were teaching it). Then the real things I need to protect are my customer lists 
and my discounts. Or perhaps your HR activities project more than it may seem: 
Is your enterprise advertising an expansion into a given country via their employment 
advertisements, and thus signaling to the competition a move in research and development 
or an increase coming downstream in sales and marketing? This may beneﬁ t the 
competitor. Could it beneﬁ t the organized criminal elements? What of the individuals 
you will be hiring in this locale? Are they subjected to the same background checks as 
the rest of the enterprise? If not, then perhaps the criminal elements can manipulate 

www.syngress.com
 
How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program • Chapter 15 
255
your hiring practices so that they can monetize their inside knowledge. What of the 
state entities? Do they have an interest in who is hired by your enterprise?
If the Competition Obtained or 
Tampered with Your Intellectual 
Property, What Harm Would Be Done?
In mid-2007, counterfeit Colgate toothpaste was front and center in the news, with 
large quantities of the counterfeit product ﬁ nding its way into the United States. Colgate 
appropriately warned the consumer of the existence of the counterfeit product, a product 
that actually damaged your teeth in contrast to the true Colgate product, and also 
provided the consumer a means to identify the true Colgate product. So, were these 
actions sufﬁ cient? Were these actions the full extent of what could have been accomplished 
given the circumstances? The situation begs several questions: How many consumers 
took the time to review the guidance? How many other consumers simply tossed out 
their Colgate and bought a competitor’s brand? So in this example, it is clear that the 
monetization of the Colgate brand by unscrupulous criminal elements placed a stellar 
brand at risk. Could the company have done something different?
What if you sell a product used in the sophisticated arms purchased by a nation’s 
defense forces, and an adversarial nation caused your product to malfunction or to act 
in a manner different than what you had envisioned? Are you protecting your research 
and development methodologies, checking and rechecking for unadulterated operability, 
or otherwise guaranteeing to your customer that what you sell operates as advertised 
and only as advertised?
What Security Measures Would 
Be Cost-Effective and Business-Enabling?
You must demonstrate that good security enables good risk taking. Your analysis 
has identiﬁ ed and articulated both business differentiators and risks that threaten to 
co-opt or otherwise nullify them, so now you have to offer ways to mitigate the risks. 
But just as importantly, the plan has to make business sense.
For example, in order to make this differentiator reasonably secure, it costs $5. 
If we don’t do this, we put $1 million at risk. It is a clear business decision. It is worth 
a $5 investment to protect $1 million.
But if it takes a $1 million dollar investment in security to protect $10, then you 
have to make a business decision.

www.syngress.com
256 
Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
And once you make that decision, either way, all of your available resources designed 
to protect your intellectual property must line up behind this decision. Even if it may 
not be the right one from your perspective, the fact that your security regime is 
present allows for the risk taking by the business elements, and a business decision 
is a business decision. There is no room for standing back and second-guessing or 
undermining that business decision. If the enterprise has decided that it is worth taking 
the risk for the good of the business—for example, if we are successful, and we believe 
we will be, we will be able to jump ahead of our competition—then all your security 
resources have to align to protect the enterprise within the new paradigm that has 
been created by the business decision to move forward in spite of the risk. You can’t 
just walk away from it and say, “I am done now.” The security regime designed to 
protect the enterprise and its intellectual property is always in a dynamic state and thus 
must be ﬂ exible enough to step forward as a full partner as the business dynamics 
adjust to the market place.
So you have to think through these issues ahead of time. You cannot wait for the 
executives to do the math for you. You have to do it for yourself ﬁ rst, and then demonstrate 
it to the executives. By doing so, you accomplish two vital feats: not only do you solve 
the problem of how best to protect that particular differentiator, or collection of 
differentiators, you have also demonstrated that security, personiﬁ ed by you and your 
efforts, is a business enabler, not a business impeder, and that security protects proﬁ t 
instead of draining it away.
Let us go through each of the ﬁ ve ﬁ gures in this chapter and explore what they 
are meant to communicate and the desired effect they are meant to achieve. Let’s 
now discuss Figure 15.1.
Figure 15.1 Intellectual Property Protection Program—the Agenda

Notes on Figure 15.1
The overall protection program for a corporation’s intellectual property starts with a 
conﬁ rmation of what the information, processes, etc. are and where they reside within 
the corporation’s footprint, and also identiﬁ es the risk to that same property. This is 
your agenda—it fulﬁ lls the ﬁ rst tenet of executive brieﬁ ngs: you are identifying and 
presenting the cadence of the brieﬁ ng and the content of the brieﬁ ng. Your executive 
should now be well prepared to actively listen. Now let’s discuss Figure 15.2.
Figure 15.2 Intellectual Property Identiﬁ cation and Risk Identiﬁ cation
Notes on Figure 15.2
First you must identify the locales where intellectual property may reside:
Executives and Board Members
You may wish to highlight, for example, those topics which are discussed in the board 
room, such as meeting agendas, board meeting minutes, compensation committee 
minutes, and more.
You may also wish to highlight the information your executive team would have 
natural access to, but which may not be accessible by the rank-and-ﬁ le of the company. 
Some examples of these types of data would be discussion on potential mergers and 
acquisitions, changes in the strategic vision of the company, new partnerships, geographic 
expansion plans, direction of the ﬁ rm in out-years, and more.
Research and Development
Consideration should be given to identifying exemplars such as new product 
designs, unregistered inventions, pending patents, awarded patents, new innovations,

Chapter 15 • How to Sell Your Intellectual Property Protection Program
researched dead-ends, research successes, new materials, new developmental and 
testing methodologies, schematics, and so on. In addition, the individuals who make 
up the company’s research and development department may also be potential 
holders of intellectual property, to include their unique and irreplaceable base of 
knowledge.
Manufacturing
Your manufacturing entity has unique methodologies and materials. In addition, the 
enterprise’s supply chain, from start to ﬁ nish, includes partners, vendors, and sub-
contractors. Additionally, ﬁ nished goods, unﬁ nished goods, goods storage, raw materials, 
and so forth should be considered for review as possible sources of the ﬁ rm’s intellectual 
property.
Sales and Marketing
Information resident in the sales and marketing arena may include the ﬁ rm’s go-to 
market plan, pending and historic bids, proﬁ t margin and discount margins, inside 
and outside sales methodologies and organizations; public relations campaigns, and 
reseller networks, to include channels and distributors.
Additional areas of potential interest could be corporate branding (present and 
future), conference and trade show presentations and participation, client list, customer 
lists, and order sheets.
Speciﬁ cs located in the competitive intelligence group may include product 
comparisons, marketing guidance, and results of table-top exercises which detail the 
results of the hypothetical competitor strategy comparison exercise. For example: 
How would Accenture beat our Ernest and Young in a head-to-head competition for 
a given bid? How would your enterprise fare in a head-to-head with your primary 
competitor?
Human Resources
Areas retaining intellectual property within the scope of human resources may include 
the ﬁ rm’s hiring processes, ﬁ les/databases containing personal identifying information, 
employee health issues, performance evaluations, vacation schedules, individual salary 
compensation, EEO ﬁ les, beneﬁ ts, and so on.
Additionally, knowledge of the ﬁ rm’s processes, such as how the background 
investigation process works, what is included, how cases are adjudicated, etc., may 
allow an individual to craft a scenario to beat your processes.

Operations
Data found within the operations entity of most companies would include costs, 
margins, budgetary data, information technology infrastructure, business continuity 
plans and test results, physical security, information security policies, transportation, 
equipment procurement (to include channels used), problem mitigation methodologies, 
data destruction protocol including degauss and shredding regimes, and contractor 
identiﬁ cation (if one is used).
Risk Identiﬁ cation
Risk can come at you from only two vectors—inside and outside. Inside risk is 
almost completely in your control, whereas outside risk is almost completely out of 
your control. Each of the identiﬁ ed intellectual property items should be charted 
with all known inside/outside risks. In both cases, data/information leakage is a very 
real risk; inadvertent publication of conﬁ dential information can occur in both inside 
and outside environments, data can be physically stolen, electronic surveillance can be 
done of your personnel and facilities. One methodology that may be of assistance is 
rating the risk to intellectual property based on geography, as detailed in Table 15.1. 
It will allow you to rank your intellectual property in order of risk.

Implications of IP loss
When you lose your intellectual property, the potential ramiﬁ cations should be identiﬁ ed 
for inclusion in your presentation, to show the cost to the enterprise, which is not 
always ﬁ scal loss. Knowing what you need to protect, the risks involved, as well as the 
ramiﬁ cations of losing the intellectual property, allows you to respond to market 
opportunities with speed, strength, and agility.

Implementation Plan
Discuss where the rollout of the plan will occur, the cadence, and so forth. It is important 
to know where you start, where you will ﬁ nish, and how often you are going to review 
and repeat the educational processes and audits.
Potential Inhibitors
Identify internal points of resistance to change in intellectual property protocol, 
potential competitor action which may cause you to adjust your intellectual property 
protection schema, events which may render your plan moot, and environmental 
(global), political, or legal factors which could derail your plan, such as partner, vendor, 
or contractor failures.

Demonstrate the value of the intellectual property to be protected in a monetary 
unit of measure and a man-hour unit of measure, and be sure to tie into this portion 
of the presentation the identiﬁ ed milestones and expectations.
Create a core message, which will be retooled, oriented, and calibrated for each 
of the various business units by the executive and management team so as to ensure 
the message resonates with the receiving audience—the ﬁ rm’s individual employees.
Ensure that there is available an employee and executive feedback methodology 
so as to allow a sharing of results across the enterprise to adjust, redirect, or message 
anew as appropriate.

Chapter 16 • Conclusion
Protect Your IP
The threat to your intellectual property is real. But the ability to protect your intellectual 
property from these threats is within your grasp.
Learn from the examples offered in this book. Those in positions of responsibility 
in many of the ﬁ rms mentioned in Part 1 had discussed the issue, and thought they 
had a comprehensive program, but they didn’t. Those in positions of responsibility in 
these ﬁ rms hadn’t been mindful enough of the full spectrum of risks and threats.
Take the elements of the holistic program we have offered, adapt them to your 
environment, champion their adoption, and then move forward aggressively.
Most importantly, don’t fall into the trap of initiating changes, creating policies, and 
then forgetting about them. As the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, “You 
cannot step into the same river twice.” The world is a dynamic market place. And part of 
what this dynamism means is that the challenges you face will continue to evolve, and 
your solutions will continue to be challenged, over and over (sometimes successfully). 
Adapt, adapt, adapt. Your adversaries do.
For example, even as we wrapped up this text for our publisher, there are emerging 
trends and intensifying currents.
The level of malware and spam entering the portals of enterprises has approached 
more than 90% of the total volume; that is, greater than 90% of all e-mail arriving at 
the e-mail servers of enterprises can be characterized as trash.
Consider the art of “Phishing.” It has reached the utmost level of professionalism. 
The attention to detail reﬂ ected in such attacks has evolved from that of amateurs to 
that of a seasoned professional. The language used has evolved from the stilted and 
grammatically incorrect to the linguistically impeccable. The text of the latest attacks 
resonates with the reader, making the attacks much more effective against the uninformed.
And just as we focused on the targeted Trojan in our exploration of the Haepharati 
case, here we note that the one-off Trojan has now permeated a number of industries, 
targeting individuals at all levels and on a global basis.
Encourage your work force to remain vigilant. We shall continue to monitor the 
changes in both methodology and sponsorship, and update both in the next edition.
Until then, keep your secrets safe, and your fortunes will not evaporate before 
your eyes.
We thank you for allowing us to share our thoughts with you, and we are secure 
in the knowledge that we have provided you with a boost toward self-preservation in 
the global marketplace.

Appendix B • Leveraging Your Tax Dollar
So how does a corporation leverage their tax dollars to ensure they are deriving all 
possible beneﬁ t and perhaps more importantly, government perspective and knowledge 
in their efforts to protect their intellectual property? We’ve compiled a list of potential 
avenues of pursuit that may produce the value-added.
Domestic  The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security 
are both ﬁ rst stops for current trends on what threats are being experienced across 
the country, as both have visibility into gross data sets. Both have outreach programs 
designed speciﬁ cally to provide information to individuals and corporations on a 
variety of topics and cadences.
International  Should you need an international focus, the Department of 
Commerce has an entire Bureau dedicated to leveling the playing ﬁ eld and helping 
the corporate entity in protecting their intellectual property. The Department of 
State also publishes a plethora of data sets that may be of interest.
With the above as the backdrop, the following should serve as a primer on those 
U.S. Government entities that may be able to provide any U.S. corporation with 
assistance. Experience has shown that each of the governmental entities identiﬁ ed 
welcome contact from the private sector and will respond should a corporation initiate 
contact with a request for assistance.
Domestic
Department of Justice (DOJ)
Within the DOJ there are a large number of Bureaus, Divisions, and Programs, all 
of which support the overall mission of the DOJ and produce information and analysis 
which may be of use to your ﬁ rm. The following are those most likely to be of 
interest to a corporate security ofﬁ ce.
■ Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP)
■ Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
■ INTERPOL—U.S. National Central Bureau
■ Antitrust Division Asset Forfeiture Program
■ Attorney General
■ Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
■ Bureau of Justice Assistance (OJP)

■ Ofﬁ ce of Legislative Affairs
■ Ofﬁ ce of Professional Responsibility
■ Ofﬁ ce of Public Affairs
■ Professional Responsibility Advisory Ofﬁ ce
■ U.S. Attorney
■ U.S. Marshals Service
Of those noted previously in this section, the U.S. Attorney and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation would be among the recommended ﬁ rst stops. Within each 
of the 56 FBI division ofﬁ ces exist a variety of ofﬁ ce entities (squads) speciﬁ cally 
focused on topical areas of interest: Counterintelligence, Economic Espionage, and 

www.syngress.com
292 
Appendix B • Leveraging Your Tax Dollar
High-Technology Cyber Crime. In addition, if cyber-crime is a topic of interest, 
then within the DOJ’s Criminal Division is the Computer Crime and Intellectual 
Property Section (CCIPS). On request, any and all of these entities can provide 
brieﬁ ngs tailored to speciﬁ c needs/threats.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
As with the DOJ, the DHS has a large number of entities. The following are believed 
to be the most pertinent to the interests of the corporate security perspective. The 
descriptions were extracted directly from the DHS Web site.
■ Directorate for Preparedness  Works with state, local, and private sector 
partners to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and target resources 
where risk is greatest, thereby safeguarding our borders, seaports, bridges, 
highways, and critical information systems.
■ Directorate for Science and Technology  The primary research and 
development arm of the Department. It provides Federal, state, and local 
ofﬁ cials with the technology and capabilities to protect the homeland.
■ Directorate for Management  Responsible for Department budgets and 
appropriations, expenditure of funds, accounting and ﬁ nance, procurement, 
human resources, information technology systems, facilities, equipment, and 
the identiﬁ cation and tracking of performance measurements.
■ Ofﬁ ce of Intelligence and Analysis  Responsible for using information 
and intelligence from multiple sources to identify and assess current and 
future threats to the United States.
■ Ofﬁ ce of Operations Coordination  Responsible for monitoring the 
security of the United States on a daily basis and coordinating activities 
within the Department and with Governors, Homeland Security Advisors, 
law enforcement partners, and critical infrastructure operators in all 50 
States and more than 50 major urban areas nationwide.
■ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  Prepares the nation 
for hazards, manages Federal response and recovery efforts following any 
national incident, and administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
■ Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  Protects the nation’s 
transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and 
commerce.

www.syngress.com
 
Leveraging Your Tax Dollar • Appendix B 
293
■ Customs and Border Protection  Responsible for protecting our nation’s 
borders in order to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering 
the United States, while facilitating the ﬂ ow of legitimate trade and travel.
■ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  The largest investigative 
arm of the Department of Homeland Security, responsible for identifying and 
shutting down vulnerabilities in the nation’s border, economic, transportation, 
and infrastructure security.
■ Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  Provides career-long training 
to law enforcement professionals to help them fulﬁ ll their responsibilities 
safely and proﬁ ciently.
■ U.S. Coast Guard  Protects the public, the environment, and U.S. economic 
interests in the nation’s ports and waterways, along the coast, on international 
waters, or in any maritime region as required supporting national security.
■ U.S. Secret Service  Protects the President and other high-level ofﬁ cials 
and investigates counterfeiting and other ﬁ nancial crimes, including ﬁ nancial 
institution fraud, identity theft, computer fraud, and computer-based attacks 
on our nation’s ﬁ nancial, banking, and telecommunications infrastructure.
■ Homeland Security Advisory Council  Provides advice and recommendations 
to the Secretary on matters related to homeland security. The Council is comprised 
of leaders from state and local government, ﬁ rst responder communities, the private 
sector, and academia.
■ National Infrastructure Advisory Council  Provides advice to the Secretary 
of Homeland Security and the President on the security of information 
systems for the public and private institutions that constitute the critical 
infrastructure of our nation’s economy.
■ Interagency Coordinating Council on Emergency Preparedness 
and Individuals with Disabilities  Established to ensure that the Federal 
government appropriately supports safety and security for individuals with 
disabilities in disaster situations.
As with the DOJ, the DHS has a variety of missions, all focused on securing 
the United States, and thus may be of minimal utility if the locus of attention is not 
within the United States. A common thread between criminal cases originating from 
within the DOJ and the DHS is the U.S. Attorney’s ofﬁ ce as the prosecuting ofﬁ ce. 
Again, a relationship with the U.S. Attorney’s ofﬁ ce will be time well invested. 

www.syngress.com
294 
Appendix B • Leveraging Your Tax Dollar
If electronic ﬁ nancial crime is topical, the USSS and their Electronic Crimes Branch 
capabilities will be of interest.
The important point to carry forward when dealing with Federal entities, be 
they law enforcement or other departments/agencies, is that while they may have 
turf issues, these are not your issues—it is at this nexus where the relationship with 
the U.S. Attorney keeps the corporate entity out of any “turf” discussion, as there 
is only one prosecutor.
International
Focus on the international milieu requires interaction with a separate set of U.S. 
government agencies and capabilities.
Department of Commerce (DOC)
■ Trade Compliance Center
■ Country Market Research
■ Advocacy Center—leveling the playing ﬁ eld
Department of State (DOS)
■ Ofﬁ ce of Commercial and Business Affairs
■ International—country background notes
■ U.S. Embassy index
■ Consular Affairs
■ Diplomatic Security Overseas Security Advisory Council
Within the U.S. Department of Commerce, there are entire ofﬁ ces that are 
speciﬁ cally chartered with leveling the playing ﬁ eld for U.S. industries. When an 
unscrupulous business practice is uncovered, reporting this event to members of Congress 
concurrently with the Department of Commerce will ensure your situation receives 
attention. Similarly, the Department of State, the foreign policy arm of the United 
States, offers a plethora of information for the asking and invites membership in their 
Diplomatic Security—Overseas Security Advisory Council, an efﬁ cient manner in

which a corporate entity can keep tabs on what the U.S. Government is telling its 
citizens resident in a given locale. This is important, as the U.S. Government adheres 
closely to a “no double standard” rule on threat advisories—if U.S. government 
personnel are being warned, then all U.S. citizens are warned, thus obviating the 
need for a “special relationship” to stay atop of country speciﬁ c warnings; not all 
governments adhere to such a policy.

Appendix C • Notes on Cyber Forensics
Here are some notes on cyber forensics that Jim Christy provided for us during his 
participation in Virtual Roundtable, featured in Part 1: The Challenge.
Digital Evidence: Volume
The world is going digital and so are important sources of evidentiary material for 
cyber investigators.
On average, each U.S. household owns 25 electronic products. Included on that 
list are laptop computers, cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and digital 
cameras, all items with utilities adaptable to criminal activity. Investigative planning, 
search warrant afﬁ davit preparation, and crime scene exploitation must account for 
these and other electronic devices because they can be the tools of a crime that hold 
large amounts of incriminating evidence.
The electronics industry grows 11% annually because, as it has throughout its 
history, it continues to produce products whose features and performance rise while 
their costs decline. For example, the ﬁ rst computer hard drive, developed 50 years 
ago by IBM, was the size of two large refrigerators, weighed 2,000 pounds, was 
leased to customers for $250,000 annually (2006 dollars), and held 5 megabytes 
of information on 50 24-inch disks. Today, the hard drive in a laptop computer is 
2.5 inches in diameter, weighs a few ounces, and, for about $100, can hold 60 GB of data.
The hard drive size, weight, and cost comparisons are impressive, but let’s consider 
the information storage capability of the latest technology. How much potential 
evidentiary material could be on that laptop?
Based on 80 characters per page line, 60 lines per printed page, 4,800 characters per 
page, and 5,000 pages per ﬁ le drawer, some basic math produces an estimate that one 
gigabyte of storage capacity equals the amount of information kept in 8.3 ﬁ ve-drawer 
ﬁ le cabinets. Therefore, a laptop with a 60 gigabyte drive can hold 498 ﬁ le cabinets, or 
2,490 ﬁ le drawers, of information.
The pervasiveness and utility of other digital electronics products makes them, like 
a laptop, important sources of evidence. Cell phones, owned by two-thirds of the 
people in the United States, can have one gigabyte (8.3 cabinets) of internal storage 
capacity. This gives the user a large space to save information from the many functions, 
such as camera, PDA, GPS, Web browsing, and e-mail, that cell phones now perform.
As individual devices, PDAs and digital cameras may come with 32MB of internal 
storage, a smaller amount than cell phones but not insigniﬁ cant. Using the same 
formula referred to earlier, they are potentially holding 1.5 ﬁ le drawers of information.

www.syngress.com
 
Notes on Cyber Forensics • Appendix C 
299
But, let’s not forget about the storage media that attach to digital electronic 
products to enhance performance capabilities and attract customers. Memory cards 
come in several different shapes and, although the largest is only slightly more than 
1.5” long, they may hold 4GB (33 cabinets) of information.
Thumb drives are all just a few inches long and have the same type of connector. 
They are sold with various amounts of storage capacity, some ranging as high as 16GB 
(133 cabinets).
And, there are three basic types of compact disks (CDs): standard CDs measure 
about 4.75” in diameter and store 650 or 700 megabytes (5.5 cabinets); mini-CDs 
measure 3” in diameter and hold 180 megabytes (almost 1 cabinet); and business card 
CDs, their name describing their size, have 40 megabytes (1.5 ﬁ le drawers).
The bottom line is, law enforcement and cyber investigators should plan for 
seizing all types of electronic devices and digital media when pursuing a case. All of 
these products have some amount of internal storage capacity that equals a signiﬁ cant 
amount of information.
Moreover, advances in the electronics industry have led to the production of many 
small-sized items that have an immense amount of storage capacity. It may require a 
diligent search to ﬁ nd these removable, easily concealed items, but the potential 
rewards for uncovering this digital evidence are great.
Digital Evidence: Searches/Legal
DNA evidence can put a subject at the crime scene. Digital evidence can go beyond that 
and provide answers to the traditional who, what, when, where, why, and how questions.
Since most crime scenes now involve some sort of digital evidence, it is 
extremely critical to have a person with the expertise addressing unforeseen digital 
media collection issues, and ensuring successful seizure of computer media.
There are several legal points to remember when collecting digital evidence. First, 
make certain the search warrant includes electronic devices, digital media, digital 
cameras, and anything else that might hold digital evidence.
For example, you might list such items as computers, printers, cell and wireless 
phones, answering machines, PDAs, pagers, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, 
and cameras, along with their respective chargers and data cables. Don’t forget other 
types of media that digitally store information. These include smart cards, memory 
cards, memory sticks/thumb drives, electronic game players, compact disks (CDs), and 
digital video disks (DVDs).

www.syngress.com
300 
Appendix C • Notes on Cyber Forensics
Second, be sure to collect important documentation related to digital media evidence. 
Look for such items as computer manuals, printed material, user notes, passwords, and 
encryption keys. Without this information, examiners will have to use digital forensic 
methods to recover the data—methods that can be time consuming and may not always 
be successful. Digital media service provider information can also be very valuable. 
Satellite, cell phone, cable, and pager billing records can add signiﬁ cantly to a case.
Finally, follow traditional criminal investigative procedures as they relate to digital 
evidence. Photograph the computer. Label the wires. Sketch a diagram of the wire 
connections. These will help examiners duplicate the computer’s conﬁ guration. And, 
collect ﬁ ngerprints. As with any case, this will help tie the wrongdoer to the crime.
Digital Evidence: Cell Phones
Criminal and counterintelligence investigators … where are your cell phones? As 
digital evidentiary material, that is. They’re screwed into ears everywhere (of your 
subjects and witnesses), but seldom seized as part of your cases, relatively speaking.
More than two-thirds of the people living in the United States own cell phones, 
the most common electronics device in the world. And those phones do more than 
dial numbers. Expanded memory cards give them added storage space for such 
functions as cameras, organizer tools, music players, and GPS receivers.
The Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3)’s Defense Computer Forensic Laboratory 
(DCFL) only examined 52 cell phones and 17 personal digital assistants (PDAs) from April 
2005 until Oct 2006 when it began tracking these objects as digital media items. Given the 
ubiquitous presence of these electronic devices in the lives of almost everyone—including 
criminals—these numbers are surprisingly low. This observation is consistent with the 
experience of supervisors of the FBI’s Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) program, 
in terms of cell phones seized and referred for examination.
From the DC3’s perspective, more cell phones and PDAs should be appearing as 
evidence in digital forensic exams. They are invariably “tools of the crime,” as the 
conveniences and real-time exchange of information they provide ideally suits the 
motivation and interest of criminals.
Whether it’s a cell phone or PDA, the device can contain data of enormous probative 
value. DCFL examiners have been very successful at extracting a wide variety of data 
from cell phones, including: contact lists (phone book), call records (out-going, in-coming, 
and missed calls), pictures, and videos. Information found on PDAs is dependent upon 
the user’s purpose for the device; however, most commonly scheduling, appointment, 
calendar, contacts, and e-mail data are recoverable.

www.syngress.com
 
Notes on Cyber Forensics • Appendix C 
301
We worry that the relative number of referrals possibly indicates a deficit in 
investigative planning (and search warrant afﬁ davit prep) and crime scene exploitation—
which should include the seizure of a greater range of digital devices that can be 
tools of the crime (digital cameras, GPS systems, etc). It may be that ﬁ eld investigators 
aren’t tying cell phones to their search, or are simply doing a “Kojak ﬁ eld test” by 
looking at the last number dialed.
If so, they risk missing a rich load of data that can identify co-conspirators, 
accessories to the crime, or (depending on the nature of the crime) previously 
unknown victims, or generate other fruitful leads, and more.
Digital Evidence: Accreditation
Digital Forensics is the forensic examination and exploitation of digital media. Today 
there is a proliferation of electronic devices that contain digital information about 
everything we do. These devices have become integrated into our daily lives and 
therefore we have become dependent on digital devices such as cell phones, pagers, 
PDAs, computers, laptops, alarm systems, badge access systems, video games systems, 
GPS units, watches, video cameras, ATMs, and so on.
These devices contain information digitally stored in e-mail, bank records, word 
processing documents, calendars, spreadsheets, contact lists, alarm codes, pictures, and more.
For investigative purposes both civilly and criminally, the exploitation of these 
digital devices forensically is in a very nascent stage even for the federal government. 
As recently as the Fall of 2003, the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/
Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) accepted Digital Forensics as a new 
forensics discipline just like the traditional forensics disciplines of ballistics, DNA, 
serology, hand writing, questioned documents, toxicology, tool marks, etc., and 
approved standards for the processing of digital evidence.
Just like the crime labs you see on every television network today, there are 
digital devices that need to be exploited forensically to prove or disprove allegations. 
The difference between what you see on TV and reality is the time and expense to 
process digital evidence.
The days of looking through someone’s ﬁ le cabinet or desk drawer for evidence 
are fading. People today are storing their information on computers and portable 
wireless devices. That means that a run-of-the-mill investigator can no longer review 
evidence on site and discover the evidence relevant to their investigation. Today 
those electronic devices must be seized or forensically copied at the source and then 
examined/exploited in a laboratory environment with specialized tools and highly 

www.syngress.com
302 
Appendix C • Notes on Cyber Forensics
trained experts. Only these specialized tools can make the information visible for 
review to determine if it is relevant or not.
And now ASCLD/LAB has established standards for the forensic processing of 
these devices. There are approximately 312 crime labs that have been accredited in 
North America by ASCLD/LAB. Today, only 12 labs are accredited to process digital 
forensics. All of these labs are government labs. There are no private sector accredited 
digital forensics labs today.
At least 3 states have passed legislation that prohibits the introduction of forensics 
evidence (both digital and non-digital evidence) into their courts unless processed by an 
accredited forensic crime lab. Several states are considering this legislation but have not 
passed it due to the fact that they don’t currently have access to an accredited forensics lab.
Deﬁ nitions
■ Digital Forensic Examinations  Perform the scientiﬁ c process of discovering 
information that is probative to an investigation or administrative matter using 
an approved methodology that would withstand the rigor of the legal process.
■ Digital Forensic Examination Reports  The easy-to-read report created 
as a result of the Digital Forensics Examination. This report must be able to 
be read and comprehended by both non-technical readers as well as readers 
with a technical background.
■ Expert witness testimony  Testimony in a court or administrative hearing by 
a witness, who by virtue of education, profession, publication, or experience, is 
believed to have special knowledge of their subject beyond that of the average 
person, sufﬁ cient that others may ofﬁ cially and legally rely upon their opinion.
■ On-site evidence acquisition  The physical copying or seizing of computer 
media that could possibly be of evidentiary value based on a legal authority 
including consent.
Digital Evidence: 
Digital Forensics Intelligence
The Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) established a new intelligence discipline in 
2005 to support cyber investigations and digital forensics. Everyone is familiar with the 
foreign intelligence and criminal intelligence disciplines. In the recent past, a new Cyber 

www.syngress.com
 
Notes on Cyber Forensics • Appendix C 
303
Intelligence discipline was established to focus on computer intrusion investigations. 
If you were to place these three intelligence disciplines in a Venn diagram, where they all 
overlap, what we deﬁ ne as Digital Forensics Intelligence would be created. It’s the tools, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that subjects use to obfuscate data, and the TTPs we 
use in law enforcement to uncover evidence. Sometimes evidence is obfuscated by 
technology itself.
We have found that many of our examiners happen to be introverted, maybe the 
nature of the beast. In the past, an experienced examiner may have encountered a new 
challenge, performed their own research, solved the problem, and moved on to the next 
case. A month later, an inexperienced examiner may have encountered the same problem, 
performed their own research, and not solved the challenge. There was no process to 
capture the corporate knowledge.
DC3 has established standard operating procedures that create and sustain a 
perpetual knowledge management system for analyzing, collecting, and disseminating 
the reﬁ ned TTPs of digital forensic examinations.
The DFI Team is currently comprised of a senior traditional intelligence analyst 
and a senior digital forensics examiner. The DFI Team designed and built the DFI 
Portal, an intranet Web site where DC3’s entire staff could access a storehouse of 
information. By the end of 2006, the DFI Portal held more than 1,000 documents 
and DC3 personnel had used the Portal’s search engine approximately 2,000 times. 
It was so successful that DC3 felt that all federal, state, and local law enforcement 
agencies (LEAs) could beneﬁ t from such a system. Today, most state and local LEAs 
can not afford more than a handful of examiners, and training for these examiners is 
usually nascent.
DC3 and Oklahoma State University (OSU) have teamed in a joint initiative to 
create the National Repository of Digital Forensic Intelligence (NRDFI). 
Representatives from Oklahoma State’s Center for Telecommunications and Network 
Security (CTANS) met with the DFI Team and plans were outlined to create a DFI 
knowledge management portal aimed at linking cyber investigators from the various 
criminal investigative agencies.
The following are examples of the types of searchable information that will 
populate the NRDFI.

OSU has been able to acquire some minimal funding and has assigned a full-time 
programmer to develop the NRDFI proto-type. DC3 has migrated all unclassiﬁ ed 
material to be shared with all participating LE agencies. OSU is currently looking for 
federal, state, and local LEAs that would like to beta test the system.
In addition, when reviewing electronic crime, there are many aspects that must be 
reviewed for new methodologies, new discovery techniques, etc. The Anti-Phishing 
Working Group, a non-proﬁ t organization, hosts an annual research conference for 
those involved in the research of electronic crime. In addition, in the United States, the 
National Institute of Justice funds research in the ﬁ eld of electronic forensics in support 
of the United State’s local, regional, state, and national law enforcement entities, many 
of which have literally no resources available to support their e-forensic efforts.
What areas should be reviewed? We suggest that the enterprise IT department be 
schooled in the anatomy of “Phishing” and “Pharming,” as well as the intricacies of 
professionally prepared software which is created to separate funds, data, or intellect 
from an individual, and by extension the enterprise. One organization which the 
forensic team in any enterprise should belong to is the High Technology Criminal 
Investigators Association (HTCIA), which has regional chapters around the globe and 
holds educational seminars and conventions on a regular cadence.
In addition, the legal and ﬁ nancial departments must be up to speed on both the 
legal precedence and fraud prevention methodologies, and the enterprise as a whole 
must be sensitive to the deleterious effects which a legal or ﬁ scal imbroglio will have 
on the corporate brand and/or reputation—both worthy of protection in the grand 
scheme of intellectual property protection and loss prevention.
As important is the need to be on top of the countermeasures and acceptable 
digital forensic tools which are allowed to be used in various courts of law. How sad to 
ﬁ nd that your IP has been stolen, and then the ﬁ rst employee to the data mishandles 
the data and thus it isn’t acceptable in court and is open to conjecture as to whether or 
not the data was corrupted by the “forensic” process.

registered copyrights, mask works or boat hull designs, misappropriation of trade secrets 
or trade dress, passing off, and false advertising, may also be asserted. Additionally, antitrust 
claims relating to imported goods may be asserted. The primary remedy available in 
Section 337 investigations is an exclusion order that directs Customs to stop infringing 
imports from entering the United States. In addition, the Commission may issue 
cease-and-desist orders against named importers and other persons engaged in unfair 
acts that violate Section 337. Expedited relief in the form of temporary exclusion orders 
and temporary cease and desist orders may also be available in certain exceptional 
circumstances. Section 337 investigations, which are conducted pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
§ 1337 and the Administrative Procedure Act, include trial proceedings before administrative 
law judges and review by the Commission.
As of mid-2007, there were 613 registered investigations spanning the last 30 years, 
indicative of the high bar required in having a petition accepted by the USITC, with 
42 of these cases remaining active. Table D.1 provides the investigation number, status, 
and title for most of these cases. Provision of the entire list is to give you an immediate 
understanding that if you are the victim of intellectual property loss, and need to 
protect your market share in the United States, precedent and procedures exist to assist 
you in doing so.
