Acknowledgments
Thanks to the  anonymous souls from Microsoft who provided us with 
dozens of interim builds and important tidbits of internal information, both of 
which contributed to making this the best Windows 8 book on the market. We liter-
ally could not have completed this book in time without you and we hope that we 
lived up to the trust you placed in us.
—Paul and Rafael
This book was  a truly collaborative venture that included daily check-ins 
on Skype, document sharing on Windows Live Mesh and SkyDrive, and even some 
in-person meet-ups at all-too-infrequent industry events. Thanks again to Rafael for 
accompanying me down the rabbit hole.
Thanks as always to Stephanie, Mark, and Kelly for giving me the time to make 
this book happen and for understanding why things got grouchy sometimes.
Thanks to Jill Lovato and Greg Chiemingo at Waggener Edstrom for being islands 
of calm in a sea of insanity. You guys are the best and were always ready to help. Much 
appreciated.
Thanks to Kevin and Carol at Wiley for the help, support, and understanding. 
Books are always stressful to make, with less time than I wish for and more work than 
I expect, regardless of how many times I’ve done it. But you get that.
Finally, thanks to my readers and listeners from around the world. I’ve enjoyed 
the conversations and hope they continue well into the future. It’s always been fun, 
but what makes this worthwhile isn’t the products and technologies, it’s the relation-
ships you make along the way.

Read This First
In October 2009,  I participated in the Windows 7 launch at the World 
Forum in the Hague, Netherlands. It was easily the most beautiful theater I’ve ever 
spoken in, and while I have many memories of that all-too-short trip to Europe, one 
stands out.
After my talk, I was signing copies of Windows 7 Secrets for attendees and I received 
a wonderfully blunt question that forever altered the book you’re now reading.
“If Windows 7 is so easy to use,” a bespectacled Netherlander asked as I signed 
my name, “then why is your book over a thousand pages long?”
Time stood still for a moment while I pondered this question. And though I replied, 
“To be fair, it’s padded with screenshots,” to laughs, the question hung in my mind for 
some time to come.
In my defense—our defense, since Rafael is of course my willing partner in this 
crime against both trees and those who would safely read before going to sleep—I have 
always taken the position, both in my writing for the SuperSite for Windows and in the 
Secrets books, that Windows isn’t a standalone “thing”; it’s the center of a vast ecosys-
tem of related and connected products and services. That is, nobody buys Windows for 
Windows, per se. They buy Windows because of its promise of compatibility with the 
hardware, software, and, increasingly, services that they use and trust.
With Windows 7, that meant applications like those in Windows Live Essentials—
which weren’t technically included “with” Windows 7 but were very much required 
to “complete,” if you will, Windows—but also Zune, Windows Home Server, Windows 
Media Center, and a slew of Windows Live services.
But with Windows 8, suddenly, everything is different. Yes, Windows still stands 
at the center of a vast ecosystem. But Windows 8 itself is quite different from its pre-
decessor, and the solutions that make up its supporting cast have changed quite a bit 
since Windows 7, thanks to changes in the market.
Microsoft says it is “reimagining” Windows with Windows 8, giving Rafael and 
I the chance to, in turn, reimagine our Secrets books. A year before Windows 8 
launched, as we plotted this next version of the book, it occurred to us that it was 
time to make a break with the past, similar to what Microsoft was doing with the 
product we’re writing about. And so we came to Wiley with a tentative plan, since we 
feared failure, to not update Windows 7 Secrets. Instead, this next book, Windows 8 

xvi
Introduction
Secrets, would be an all-new book, with virtually no information taken and updated 
from previous books. It would be a shorter book, too, one that wouldn’t harm you if 
you dropped it on yourself.
Oddly, and humorously, Wiley not only agreed, but they had also separately come 
to the same conclusion, and were likewise worried that the daunting task of starting 
over from scratch would be uninteresting to us.
Problem solved.
The resulting book, the one you now hold, is the product of this reimagining. It 
is significantly shorter than the previous book—about a third shorter, I guess—and 
doesn’t drift into surrounding ecosystem products and services unless they’re central 
to the discussion. Part of the reason we’re able to do this is that Microsoft has simply 
built so much into Windows 8, while extending its support to cloud services in more 
seamless ways. But part of it is us just saying no to peripheral topics as well.
Our goal, as always, is to make you more efficient and proficient in Windows. It’s 
to take you from your current skill level to the next level by revealing information 
about this new Windows that is new—simply because Microsoft has added whatever 
new features and functionality—and, as important, because it is new to you. In the 
old days, before the pervasive online connectivity we all now enjoy, the notion of 
“secrets” was pretty straightforward, and you could safely assume that you’d pick up 
a copy of whatever Secrets book and discover unique information—often obviously 
called out in gratuitous “Secret” boxes—that was not available anywhere else.
Today, that’s not possible.
Both Rafael and I have discussed virtually every topic in this book online in 
some form already. I often test content on my own website before writing about it 
in the book to gather feedback and questions from users, which I can often present 
to Microsoft for further internal insights. The value of this book, then, is manifold. 
It’s not just some simple compendium of previously published online articles. It’s 
a deeper, more thorough examination of what’s truly new in Windows 8, backed by 
months and months of research and usage, and feedback from the people at Microsoft 
who actually made the product. And it’s all gathered in one organized and convenient 
place: this book.
Things have changed for you, the reader, as well. We’re now making more assump-
tions than ever before. And while the bar isn’t particularly high, both Rafael and I 
wanted to make sure that you understood what you are getting into here.
That is, we assume you know how to use Windows. And by this, we don’t just mean 
how to translate the physical actions of moving a mouse on a surface into on-screen 
mouse cursor movements. We expect you to know Windows 7 inside and out, and to 

xvii
Introduction
be familiar with the way it works. This is important, and different, because we’re car-
rying over virtually no secrets, tips, or information from Windows 7 Secrets. This book 
is all-new, and assumes you already understand the features that were previously 
available, often in unchanged form, in Windows 7.
But don’t worry that this book will be daunting in some way. It’s not. We used the 
same approachable and conversational style that we’ve always used because, well, that’s 
the way we do things. It’s just that adding the relevant content from Windows 7 Secrets 
to this book would have necessitated a 1,500-page tome. No one wanted that. So we took 
what is a bold step for us. We think the book is better for it. And we hope you agree.
But we want to hear from you either way. We view this book in the same way we 
do our own websites and other work, as a conversation about technology between 
people who are truly interested in learning more, always. And that includes us. If we 
did something right or screwed up something terribly, please, do let us know.
These are our personal e‑mail addresses and Twitter accounts. We’re interested in 
continuing the conversation.

Windows 8: Big Upgrade, or Biggest Upgrade Ever?
Some—including Microsoft—have described Windows 8 as the biggest change to  
Windows since the seminal release of Windows 95 in 1995. And while it’s convenient to 
make such a claim—every Windows release in the years since has been compared to that 
milestone—the truth is far more dramatic.
Windows 8 isn’t the biggest Windows release since Windows 95. It’s the biggest 
release, ever.
To understand why this is so requires an understanding of the history of Windows 
and of the technologies that have driven each release. Early versions of Windows weren’t 
even proper operating systems. Instead, they were graphical shells that ran on top of 
the real OS, called MS-DOS. MS-DOS was a product of its era—the early 1980s—which is 
to say it was an arcane command-line system that wasn’t user friendly in the least. But 
since MS-DOS ran on the most popular computers of the day, many companies, including 
Microsoft, created user-friendly shells that hid the complexity of MS-DOS while retain-
ing the system’s most vital attribute, its compatibility with MS-DOS applications.

xviii
Introduction
Some of these shells were essentially text-based, like MS-DOS itself, while some 
ran in special graphical modes. Microsoft’s approach, called Windows, used the latter 
approach because the company had been deeply involved in the creation of the first 
consumer-oriented graphical OS, which shipped with the first Apple Macintosh. Sensing 
that graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, were the future, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates 
drove his company to create a PC alternative that worked on top of DOS.
Thanks to its shaky MS-DOS underpinnings, early Windows versions weren’t techni-
cally very elegant. They also weren’t very pretty or usable, but by version 3.0 in the early 
1990s, Microsoft suddenly had a hit on its hands and the industry began coalescing 
around this GUI, much as it had embraced plain old MS-DOS a decade earlier.
Without getting too deep into snooze-inducing technical arcana, there was a 
brief moment in the early 1990s when Microsoft was actually backing three desktop 
PC operating systems. First was MS-DOS and Windows, a homegrown solution with 
serious technical limitations. Second was OS/2, a joint project with IBM that would 
have replaced DOS/Windows on PCs had it been successful. And third was a more 
obscure project, first called NT, which was a stable and reliable UNIX alternative that 
had nothing in common with DOS/Windows at all.
But as NT evolved into Windows NT, Microsoft did two things to bring this system 
closer to its DOS-based cousin. First, it determined that NT would utilize the same 
GUI as DOS-based Windows, starting with the Windows 3.x Program Manager shell in 
1993. And second, it created a 32-bit environment called Win32 that could run DOS-
based Windows (and even some DOS) applications, creating a modicum of compat-
ibility. Over time, the Win32 environment was ported to DOS-based Windows versions 
(starting with Windows 95), the driver models were combined, and Microsoft began 
its efforts to transition completely to the NT codebase, an event that was originally 
planned for Windows 2000 but had to be put off until Windows XP, in 2001.
Whew.
The point is that during all of this transition and evolution, Microsoft never 
changed the user experience, the Windows runtime, and the underlying technologies 
that developers use all at the same time. But with Windows 8, it has done just that.
Windows 8 includes a completely new user experience we call Metro that  
offers smartphone-like, full-screen experiences in lieu of (well, in addition to)  
the old-fashioned “windowed” interface provided by the desktop environment from 
previous Windows versions. And Metro runs on top of a completely new runtime 
engine, called Windows Runtime, or WinRT, which in turn offers developers a com-
pletely new set of native APIs, with new capabilities and a new way of doing things.
That’s a whole lot of new.

xix
Introduction
NO TE ​ ​Though we are calling this new environment Metro, Microsoft—for le-
gal reasons—is not. One alternative style of naming we’ve seen used, in which 
Metro is called “the Windows 8 UI,” and Metro-style apps are referred to as 
“Windows 8 apps,” is, to us, inadequate. Windows 8 provides two user experi-
ences, what we call Metro and the desktop. And both are “Windows 8 UIs” that 
contains “Windows 8 apps.” So we’re sticking with the Metro name, which has 
been in use for a couple of years now and which we feel perfectly encapsulates 
the new environment and the apps that run within it. Yep. We’re rabble-rousers.
Compare this to Windows 7. In Windows 7, Microsoft provided a refined version of 
the Aero desktop experiences it previously offered in Windows Vista. And Windows 7 
ran on top of the same Explorer runtime engine as all Windows versions dating back 
to Windows 2000, while offering developers the exact same Win32-based APIs, with 
of course a handful of new capabilities.
Put simply, there’s no comparison.

We mentioned previously that we wrote this book for average users, and not technical 
experts. And that we assume you have used and understand modern Windows versions, 
especially Windows 7. And that your desire to learn more about Windows 8 has inspired 
this purchase. We won’t disappoint you.
The book doesn’t need to be read from cover to cover. That said, we do recommend 
reading through the first five chapters in sequence, if possible, since this is the foun-
dation for understanding how the new operating system works and why things are the 
way they are. From that point on, feel free to cherry-pick as needed, as you discover 
and wonder about specific new features.
But before diving into Windows 8, it’s important to understand a few basic con-
cepts, especially if you’ll be utilizing this system on a new tablet computer or similar 
multi-touch-based device. Throughout this book, we make no assumptions about 
how you’ll interact with Windows 8, and we cover multi-touch, mouse, and keyboard 
throughout, so no one gets left out. But multi-touch-based Windows machines, while 
not technically new, are going to become a lot more popular with Windows 8. And 
more important, perhaps, Microsoft has seriously bolstered multi-touch support in 
Windows 8 so that it is now an incredible, integrated experience. And if you’re using 
a multi-touch device of any kind, you’ll want to know a few basics.
So let’s start there.

xx
Introduction
Using Windows 8 with Multi-Touch
Those with multi-touch tablets and other touch-based Windows devices will soon 
discover that Windows 8 works quite naturally, and much like other familiar touch 
devices such as Windows Phone, iPhone, or Android smartphones or the iPad and 
other tablets. But Windows 8 is far more sophisticated than these other products, 
so while the basics are the same, understanding a few key multi-touch gestures and 
actions is key to getting off on the right foot, er, finger.
Here’s what you need to know.
Tap: 
3
3
To open an item, simply tap it with your finger, as shown in Figure 1. This 
works identically to clicking the item with the mouse.
 
Figure 1: Tap an item to open it.
Tap and hold: 
3
3
To get more information about an item, tap and hold on that 
item. (Microsoft calls this “press and hold” for some reason.) This works simi-
larly to right-clicking an item with a mouse, and the result is often similar, 
with a menu appearing providing more information or options. Tap and hold 
can be seen in Figure 2.
 
Figure 2: Tap and hold an item to view more  
information.

Introduction
Slide to drag: 
3
3
With some Windows 8 user experiences, you can tap and hold 
an item and then drag it to a new location on-screen by swiping your finger 
slowly in whatever direction you wish to go. This action, which is commonly 
used for rearranging tiles on the new Windows 8 Start screen, can be seen in 
Figure 3 and is similar to using a mouse to drag an item around.
 
Figure 3: After tapping and holding, you can use a  
slide gesture to move an item.
Pinch to zoom out, stretch to zoom in: 
3
3
Users of touch-based smartphones 
and tablets are probably familiar with the pinch and stretch methods of zoom-
ing out and zooming in a display, respectively. You touch the screen with two 
fingers simultaneously and then move them away from each other to zoom in, 
as seen in Figure 4. Or, if you move the two fingers toward each other, you can 
zoom out. These actions are typically used in apps like Photos or Maps where 
zooming is a common activity.
 
Figure 4: Pinch or stretch with two fingers to zoom.
Rotate: 
3
3
With this fairly uncommon gesture, you can rotate the display either 
clockwise or counterclockwise. To do so, touch the screen with two fingers 
simultaneously and then turn your hand in either direction, as in Figure 5. 
Few apps support this gesture.

xxii
Introduction
 
Figure 5: Rotate the display with two fingers.
Slide scrolling:
3
3
 While smartphones often use a vertical form of scrolling, similar 
to document-based applications like Microsoft Word, Windows 8 was designed to 
be used in landscape mode by default, and its multiscreen experiences usually 
scroll from left-to-right, not up and down. To scroll quickly through these multi-
screen experiences, you can swipe the display with your finger, as in Figure 6.  
A swipe to the left will cause the display to scroll to the right.
 
Figure 6: Scroll through a multiscreen display by  
swiping with your finger.
Swipe selecting: 
3
3
To select an item in Windows 8, you can swipe on that item 
using a short downward gesture. When you do so, it will typically become 
visually highlighted in some way, indicating the selection, and additional 
options will appear, often in an app bar, which can be attached to the top or 
bottom edge of the screen. A swipe selection gesture can be seen in Figure 7.

xxiii
Introduction
 
Figure 7: A short downward swipe can select an item.
Edge swiping: 
3
3
Windows 8 provides app-specific and system-wide capabilities 
via so-called edge user interfaces, or edge UIs. To activate an edge UI, you 
swipe in toward the center of the screen from an edge. You swipe in from the 
top or bottom edge of the screen to display an app’s edge UI. And you can trig-
ger various system-level capabilities by swiping in from the left or right edge 
of the screen. (These actions are further discussed in Chapter 3.) You can see 
an example of edge swiping in Figure 8.
 
Figure 8: Activate edge UIs by swiping in from the edge of  
the screen.
Swipe app closing: 
3
3
You can close any Metro-style app by swiping down from 
near the top edge of the screen to the bottom of the screen, as in Figure 9.  
As you do, the app display will appear in a large thumbnail and that thumb-
nail will visually disappear as it is dragged to the bottom of the screen, and 
the app is closed.

xxiv
Introduction
 
Figure 9: Closing an app by swiping from the top of  
the screen.
Note that swiping down from past the top edge of the screen will trigger the 
app’s edge UI. To close the app, you must swipe down from near the top edge of 
the screen, but still on the app itself.
Using Windows 8 with a Mouse and Keyboard
If you’re using Windows 8 on a more traditional PC with a mouse and keyboard, things 
work largely as before and even when you’re interacting with the Metro-style experi-
ences and apps, you’ll discover that all of your previous PC experiences are relevant. 
There are two things you should know about, however.
First, Windows 8 introduces a wide range of new keyboard shortcuts, many of 
which utilize the Windows key that is now common on all PC keyboards. We discuss 
these shortcuts throughout the book as the need arises, but you can reference the 
appendix for a complete rundown of Windows Key keyboard shortcuts.
Second, Windows 8 provides support for the edge UIs mentioned previously to 
mouse users via new “hot corners” on the screen. Since these interfaces are so central 
to using Windows 8 effectively, we discuss them fairly extensively in Chapter 3 and 
then again in Chapter 4. But a quick overview is provided here.
Start: 
3
3
Microsoft has removed the Start button in Windows 8 so that it can pro-
vide a more consistent Start experience that works with both the Metro and 
desktop environments. To toggle Start, you can tap the Start key on your key-
board, press the Windows key button on your Windows device, or mouse the 
mouse cursor into the lower-left corner of the screen. (Yes, this is one of those 

xxv
Introduction
“hot corners” we just mentioned.) When you do so, the Start tip thumbnail, 
shown in Figure 10, appears. (Or, if you’re already on the Start screen, a tip for 
the previous experience appears.) Click this to return to the Start screen (or 
previous experience.)
 
Figure 10: It’s no button, but the  
Start tip works somewhat similarly  
to the old Start button.
Back and Switcher: 
3
3
To access the previous experience, move the mouse cursor 
into the upper-left corner of the screen. A thumbnail of the previously used 
Metro app or other experience will appear, as in Figure 11. Click this to use that 
app. Or, move the mouse cursor down the left edge of the screen to display the 
new Switcher interface that lets you switch to any previously used app.
 
Figure 11: The Back tip
Charms:
3
3
 If you move the mouse cursor into the upper-right or lower-right 
corner of the screen, you can display the new Charms bar, a set of system-level 
commands and capabilities. The Charms are shown in Figure 12.
App commands: 
3
3
When you’re using a new Metro-style app, you can display its 
app bar by right-clicking any empty spot on-screen. An app bar is shown in 
Figure 13.
OK, that’s enough to get you started. Again, we cover these and other interactions 
you’ll want to know throughout the book as needed.

Introduction
What This Book Covers
Windows 8 is a strange new operating system that combines a completely new 
Metro environment with an evolved desktop environment. If you’re familiar with 
Windows Phone, you will at least understand the basics of Metro, since that type 
of user experience debuted earlier on Microsoft’s smartphone platform. But Win-
dows 8 provides its own take on Metro, so even die-hard Windows Phone fans will 
find that there are some new skills to learn. For this reason, the book covers some 
background material related to the whys as well as the hows of Windows 8 before 
delving into specific apps and features.
This book covers everything you need to know to master Windows 8, from your 
pre-purchase considerations, to installing, upgrading, and understanding the new 
Metro user experience and the evolved desktop environment, and how the two some-
times intersect. From that point on, we dive deep into each of the new Metro apps 
that come with Windows 8 (or are at least core to the Windows 8 experience), as well 
as the new, more advanced interfaces for storage, backup and recovery, accounts and 
security, networking and connectivity, and, finally, those that are targeted specifi-
cally at businesses.
NO TE ​ ​One important point about Windows 8 is that the Metro-style apps 
Microsoft is providing with the system will all be updated on an ongoing basis 
through the new Windows Store. This means that the app descriptions we pro-
vide here are, of course, essentially slice-in-time overviews of their features 
and capabilities. We fully expect that these apps will only improve over time, 
sometimes in profound ways, and that could lead to discrepancies between the 
descriptions and figures in the book and what you’re seeing on your own PC.
While it’s impossible to see the future, we will be covering any changes  
to Windows 8 over time at our respective websites, the SuperSite for Windows  
(winsupersite.com) and Within Windows (withinwindows.com).

Introduction
How This Book Is Structured
The structure of this book should help you easily find what you need to know. As noted 
before, we recommend starting with, and reading through, the first five chapters in 
sequence, if possible. This will give you a firm grounding in Windows 8.
From there, the book progresses through a series of chapters dedicated to the Metro-
style apps and more advanced tools that make up the bulk of the Windows 8 upgrade. 
There’s no reason to read these chapters in order. Instead, treat Windows 8 Secrets as a 
reference guide, referring to it as needed as you explore your own PC or device. Alterna-
tively, you could use the book as an early exploration tool to find out about new features 
before you dive in yourself.
The point here is simple: For the most part, this book doesn’t need to be read cover 
to cover. Instead, you can read it in the order that makes the most sense for you.
What You Need to Use This Book
To use a Windows 8 PC or device, and thus Windows 8 Secrets, effectively, you will of 
course need a Windows-based PC or device, preferably running Windows 7—if you’re 
about to upgrade or migrate—or Windows 8. You will need a Microsoft account, for-
merly called a Windows Live ID, since Microsoft integrates with so many online ser-
vices and utilizes a nice PC-to-PC sync functionality that relies on this account type.
Features and Icons Used in This Book
The following features and icons are used in this book to help draw your attention 
to some of the most important or useful information in the book, some of the  
most valuable tips, insights, and advice that can help you unlock the secrets of

With Windows 8, you suddenly have a lot of decisions to make.  
Fortunately, Microsoft has simplified the product lineup such that there are basically 
just two retail versions of Windows 8 that upgraders need to think about, plus a third 
version, called Windows RT, that will be sold only with new ARM-based PCs and devices.
But choosing a Windows version is only the start of the decision-making process. 
Beyond that, you have various machine types to choose from, including not just stalwart 
desktop PCs and laptops, but also new leading-edge all-in-ones, Ultrabooks, tablets, and 
hybrid PCs.
And within those different classes of machines are a variety of new hardware 
capabilities that work in tandem with Windows 8 to provide the best computing 
experience yet. Of course, getting there will require you to do a bit of homework 
first. And that’s where this chapter comes in.

C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
Picking a Windows 8 Product Edition
Over the past decade, Microsoft has become involved in a controversy of its own 
making. And no, we’re not talking about the antitrust issues that also dogged the 
software giant for much of the past decade. Instead, we’re referring to its predilec-
tion for confusing users with too many product editions. That is, rather than make 
products called Windows and Office, Microsoft makes many product editions of each 
one, each of which comes with some almost arbitrary set of capabilities and features 
and, of course, individual price points.
The decision to diversify its product lineups wasn’t made overnight, but it was 
made for all the wrong reasons. The thing is, Microsoft had research to fall back on that 
showed that users would generally spend more money on a supposedly premium version 
of a product. And the more versions they had, the studies suggested, the better.
To understand how the plan to diversify Windows quickly ran amok, consider 
what it was like when Windows XP debuted back in 2001. At first, it was the simplest 
product lineup of all time, with a Windows XP Home Edition aimed at, yes, the home 
market, and a Professional Edition that was aimed at businesses but also those who 
wanted every single possible capability.
And sure enough, the research paid off. Even consumers preferred the more 
expensive XP Professional edition and would pay extra while configuring a PC to 
get that version of the OS.
So then Microsoft went off the rails.
First, the company expanded the XP lineup with additional product editions that 
filled certain niches, including XP Tablet PC Edition (for Tablet PCs) and Media Center 
Edition (for so-called media center PCs), which were aimed at the living room. Then 
it added a 64-bit version, XP Professional x64, and a version for emerging markets 
called XP Starter Edition. There were “N” editions for the European market and “K” 
versions for the Korean market, both necessitated by antitrust action. And there was 
an Itanium version for Intel’s then high-end (and now dead) 64-bit platform.
By the time Windows Vista shipped in 2006, it was hard to tell how many product 
editions were really available since most were also available in separate 32-bit and 
64-bit (x64) versions. Counting them all, there were almost 20!
And Microsoft not only confused customers with packaging, but it also increased 
the ways in which users could purchase the product. There were the not-quite-retail 
versions of the software, called OEM versions, which were technically supposed to 
sell only to PC makers, but were widely available online. And there was a new option 
called Windows Anytime Upgrade, which let you upgrade in-place from one version of 
Vista to another.

3
Picking a Windows 8 Product Edition
Windows 7 arrived in 2009 with just a slightly simplified product lineup. This 
time around, the 32-bit and 64-bit (x64) versions of each edition were always bundled 
together, thankfully. And while there were just about as many mainstream versions 
of the product as with Vista, the choice was a lot simpler.
It boiled down to this: Most low-end netbook computers were bundled with a cut-
rate version of Windows 7 called Starter Edition (which, in this version, graduated from 
emerging markets). Home PCs would typically come with Windows 7 Home Premium, 
and business PCs would typically come with Windows 7 Professional. If you wanted the 
version that had it all, you’d get Windows 7 Ultimate. But really, most people simply had 
to choose between Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional. It wasn’t as hard as it 
looked.
With Windows 8, Microsoft has finally gone back to its roots. And while it is still 
delivering multiple product editions in this release, the choices are fewer and far 
more easily managed.
Introducing the Windows 8 Product Editions
With Windows 8, Microsoft is offering just three mainstream product editions, 
though choosing among them is easier than it’s been since 2001. Two of the three 
versions, called Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro, run on traditional PCs that utilize the 
same Intel/Intel-compatible x86/x64 processor architecture that has provided the 
backbone of our PCs for decades. The third, called Windows RT, is being made avail-
able only with new PCs and tablets that run on the ARM processor architecture.
Aside from the underlying architecture, Windows 8 and Windows RT are roughly 
comparable, with some key differences we’ll note in a bit. That is, the feature sets are 
very similar. Windows 8 Pro is a superset of Windows 8, offering every single feature 
in Windows 8 plus several unique features.
And roughly speaking, Windows 8 is aimed at consumers—much like Windows XP 
Home was—and Windows 8 Pro is aimed at businesses and enthusiasts just like XP 
Professional was.
This makes picking a product somewhat easy, assuming you understand the  
differences between Intel-compatible PCs and ARM-based devices. (To more easily dif-
ferentiate these platforms, we tend to refer to Intel-compatible machines as PCs and 
ARM-based machines as devices, though to be fair the differences are getting some-
what subtle. So your first choice is to pick a PC or a device.
If you’re upgrading or clean installing Windows 8 on an existing PC, you will be 
choosing between Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro. It’s that simple.
Internally, 
3
3
the entry level 
Windows 8 version 
is actually called 
Windows 8 Core. 
This name makes 
a lot of sense to us, 
and is how Microsoft 
should market it,  
we think.

4
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
If you’re buying a new PC, that also means, generally, that you will choose between 
Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro. But if you’re buying a new tablet, you’ll need to choose 
among all three: Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro, and Windows RT. And your choice will be 
limited by device type: Some models will only be available with an Intel-compatible 
chipset—where you can choose between Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro—and some will 
come only with an ARM chipset, where your only choice is Windows RT.
We’ll discuss some of these differences later in the chapter, but the big picture 
goes like this: Windows RT is a new, unproven product. It runs only on ARM-based 
platforms that could enable thinner and lighter iPad-like tablets that may get better 
battery life than Intel-compatible products. (That tale has yet to be told.) Windows 
RT is roughly comparable to the base version of Windows 8, but is lacking one very 
critical feature: It is not compatible with any existing Windows applications or utili-
ties. And it’s missing two interesting and potentially useful features, Windows Media 
Player and Storage Spaces. On the flip side, Windows RT offers a few unique features 
of its own: device encryption, and free, bundled versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote. These applications are based on Office 2013 and, like Win-
dows RT, are branded with the RT name (for example, Word RT).
We mentioned that there were three mainstream Windows 8 editions. As it turns 
out, there are others. Microsoft is selling a version called, yep, Windows 8 Starter, in 
emerging markets only, so we can safely ignore that release. And a Windows 8 Enter-
prise edition is provided only to Microsoft’s corporate customers that sign up for a 
volume licensing program called Software Assurance. This version of Windows 8 is 
in fact quite interesting as it offers some additional and useful features that are now 
available in Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro. But since you can’t actually acquire it nor-
mally, it’s also something we won’t be focusing on too much here.
To make the right choice, then, you’ll need to understand the individual differ-
ences between each mainstream Windows 8 version. And you’ll need to understand 
the pros and cons of the various hardware features you’ll find in Intel-compatible PCs 
and ARM-based devices.
First, we’ll discuss the software differences.
Understanding the Differences Between 
the Product Editions
There are various ways to present this kind of information, but we find that tables, 
logically divided by category, are easy on the eyes and mind. Tables 1-1 through 1-10 
show how the mainstream product editions stack up.

Choosing Between Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro
Now that you are armed with the information in the previous tables, choosing between 
Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro should be relatively straightforward. You just need to 
consider whether you need any of the following Pro-only features. If you do, then you 
should get Windows 8 Pro.
Upgrades from Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate: 
3
3
If you intend to perform 
an in-place upgrade with an existing PC and are currently running Windows 7 
Professional or Ultimate, you will need to purchase Windows 8 Pro.
BitLocker and BitLocker To Go: 
3
3
These features provide full-disk encryption 
for fixed and removable disks, respectively, providing protection for your data 
even when the drive is removed and accessed from elsewhere.

Client Hyper-V: 
3
3
Microsoft’s server-based virtualization solution makes its 
way to the Windows client for the first time, providing a powerful, hypervisor-
based platform for creating and managing virtual machines.
Boot from VHD: 
3
3
This new capability allows you to create a virtual hard disk, 
or VHD, in Client Hyper-V and then boot your physical PC from this disk file 
rather than from a physical disk.
Domain join: 
3
3
If you need to sign in to an Active Directory-based domain with 
Windows 8, you will need Windows 8 Pro (or Enterprise).
Encrypting File System: 
3
3
EFS is somewhat de-emphasized in Windows 8 
thanks to BitLocker and BitLocker To Go, but it provides a way to encrypt 
individual drives, folders, or even files, protecting them from being accessed 
externally should the drive be removed from your PC.
Group Policy:
3
3
 Microsoft’s policy-based management technology requires an 
Active Directory domain and thus Windows 8 Pro.
Remote Desktop (host): 
3
3
While any Windows 8 PC or device can use a Remote

 For a small fee, Windows 8 Pro users can purchase 
Windows Media Center, a feature that used to be included in higher-end ver-
sions of Windows. This feature is not available to Windows 8 (or Windows RT 
for that matter). And it hasn’t been upgraded since Windows 7 shipped.
And that’s it. It really hasn’t been this easy to choose between Windows product 
editions in over a decade.
What’s Unique in Windows 8 Enterprise?
Windows 8 Enterprise is a superset of Windows 8 Pro. That is, it includes all of the 
features and capabilities in Windows 8 Pro plus provides some unique new features 
of its own. These include:
Windows To Go

: This very interesting feature lets you install Windows 8 on 
certain high-performance USB memory sticks, providing a highly portable 
Windows environment that can include all of your personal data, settings, and 
installed Metro-style apps and desktop applications.

Picking a Windows 8 PC or Tablet
While the available selection of Windows 8-compatible PCs and devices is ever-
changing, there are two primary issues to consider when it comes to hardware. First, 
you’re going to need to choose between machines based on the new ARM platform 
and the more traditional, Intel-compatible platform. And second, since Windows 8 
adds so many new hardware-based capabilities, you’ll want to understand what 
those are and whether the availability of any in a given PC or device will color your 
decision-making process.
As with any purchasing decision, you may find yourself making trade-offs. For 
example, if you’ve determined that you simply must have the backward compatibility 
of an Intel-compatible PC, but then find that ARM-based devices deliver dramatically 
better battery life, you’ve got a decision to make. These features aren’t point-by-point 
comparable, and no generalization we can make will help all readers. This means that, 
in the end, you’ll need to decide which features or capabilities are more important to 
you. But we can at least start the discussion.

ARM vs. Intel Compatible
If you’re one of the 1.3 billion active Windows users at the time of this writing, then 
you’re using an Intel- or Intel-compatible PC running on what’s arcanely described as 
an x86/x64 chipset.
Without getting too deep into the history of this nomenclature, it dates back to 
the original IBM PC, which featured an Intel processor, an early entry in the so-called 
x86 family of microprocessors. (More recent versions include the 80386, or 386, the 
486, and the Pentium, which was originally called the 586.) Put simply, the x86 moni-
ker describes two things: Intel compatibility (since both Intel and various copycats 
make the chips) and a 32-bit instruction set, which means, among other things, that 
these chips typically address up to 4 GB of RAM.
The x64 chipset, meanwhile, is a 64-bit variant of the x86 family of chipsets. 
Put simply, x64 is x86 on steroids: It is 100 percent compatible with x86 software, 
including Windows and its applications, but provides support for an astonishing 
amount of RAM: up to 256 TB (yes, terabytes).
Somewhat embarrassingly (to Intel), x64 was invented by Intel competitor AMD, 
but once it was embraced by Microsoft for use in Windows, Intel had to jump aboard, 
too. So when we refer to x86/x64 chipsets, we’re referring to those that power all of 
the PCs made before late 2012: traditional, Intel-compatible, 32-bit or 64-bit micro-
processors and supporting chips.
NO TE ​ ​If your PC came with Windows 7 preinstalled, then it’s likely that it’s 
utilizing a 64-bit, x64 chipset. Many such PCs come with 6 GB or even 8 GB of 
RAM, since one of the big advantages of these chips over older x86 chips is that 
additional memory support.
An Intel Core i7 processor, the latest in a long, long line of  
x86/x64 chips, is shown in Figure 1-1.
Most people vaguely understand that Intel-compatible  
chips sit at the heart of PCs. But things are really changing 
with Windows 8. Starting with this release, you can now also 
purchase PCs and tablets that are based on a competing and 
incompatible chipset called ARM (advanced RISC machine).
ARM is a different animal altogether. First, no one company makes ARM chips. 
Instead, the ARM platform is controlled by a company called ARM Holdings that 
licenses the technology for the chipsets to other companies; so unlike Intel and AMD, 
ARM Holdings doesn’t manufacture its own chips.
Figure 1-1: A modern  
Intel microprocessor  
carries a decades-old  
legacy inside it.

12
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
The companies that do manufacture ARM chips—such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Texas 
Instruments, and others—are free to make their own changes to the design. So while 
ARM-based chipsets are broadly compatible with each other, they’re not compatible in 
the way that x86/x64 designs from both Intel and AMD are compatible.
ARM chipsets are 32-bit designs, not 64-bit, but they run much more efficiently 
than x86/x64 chips. So they consume less power, with resulting devices normally 
providing fantastic battery life, especially when compared to traditional PCs. ARM 
designs are so efficient that they can be used in devices as small as phones. In fact, 
Windows Phone handsets are based on ARM chipsets. A typical ARM chipset is shown 
in Figure 1-2.
Microsoft’s decision to port Windows to the ARM  
architecture was made for one reason, primarily: The com-
pany wanted its flagship product to run well on thin and 
light tablets and other devices. And while Intel-compatible 
chipsets provide amazing performance and good battery 
life on a wide range of device types, only ARM provides them 
with the ability to compete, point by point, with devices as 
thin and light and power efficient as the iPad. A representa-
tive ARM tablet is shown in Figure 1-3.
Of course, the Windows 8 version for ARM, called Windows RT, also comes with 
compromises. ARM chipsets are not com-
patible with Intel-compatible chipsets, so 
the amazing array of Windows-compatible 
application software that we all take for 
granted on the PC side will not run on 
ARM-based Windows devices.
Likewise, you can’t upgrade a tradi-
tional PC running Windows 7 to Windows 
RT. Instead, the system is made available 
only on new PCs and devices running a com-
patible ARM chipset.
Because of the differences in various ARM-based platforms, the Windows RT 
machines you see on the market are actually slightly different from each other under 
the hood, and Microsoft and its partners essentially have to custom-craft the OS and 
applications for each device. For this reason, Windows RT devices are sold almost like 
appliances, and there’s a tight integration between the device and its software.
And as noted earlier in the chapter, some Windows 8 features simply aren’t 
available on Windows RT. These include individual applications such as Windows 
As 32-bit

systems can only 
utilize 4 GB of RAM. 
This isn’t a huge 
issue for most users, 
but could be limiting 
for power users.

Media Player and Windows Media Center, as well as lower-level features such as 
Storage Spaces and BitLocker. (Windows RT overcomes the latter limitation with 
its own, unique full-device encryption functionality, however.)
So, which one do you choose?
In many ways, the decision comes down to need. A Windows RT device—like a 
tablet—will generally provide better battery life than an equivalent Intel-compatible 
device and come in a thinner and lighter form factor. Both can be turned into “full PCs” 
using a docking station and attached keyboard, mouse, screen, and other peripherals. 
Both can run virtually all Metro-style apps, but only the Intel-compatible machine will 
be capable of running legacy software designed for Windows.
Perhaps the best way to decide from a form factor/architecture perspective is 
to ask yourself a few simple questions, the first few of which will be aimed at seeing 
whether you can remove ARM/Windows RT from the equation.
Are you upgrading from Windows 7?
If yes, then you simply cannot choose Windows RT. You’ll need to upgrade to 
either Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro (depending on which version of Windows 7 
you’re currently using.)
Do you need compatibility with legacy, desktop-based third-party applications 
like Photoshop?
If yes, then you simply cannot choose Windows RT. You’ll need to choose from 
the many Intel-compatible Windows 8 PCs and devices.
Do you need to sign in to an Active Directory–based domain for work purposes?
If yes, then you simply cannot choose Windows RT. You’ll need to choose from 
the many Intel-compatible Windows 8 PCs.
Do you need Windows Media Center, perhaps for a living room–based DVR 
(digital video recorder) solution?
If yes, then you simply cannot choose Windows RT. You’ll need to choose  
from the many Intel-compatible Windows 8 PCs. In fact, you’ll need to use 
Windows 8 Pro.
Those are the four biggest Windows RT blockers. If you are still a candidate for a 
Windows RT-based device, your choice is now a heck of a lot less clear, unfortunately. 
And that’s because it’s just really hard to know whether to choose Intel (Windows 8) 
or ARM (Windows RT).
Consider this quandary. You’ve decided on a Windows RT tablet because it’s super 
thin and light and it runs for days on a charge. (We’re fantasizing here; stick with us.) 
So you make the purchase, discover a bunch of fun and useful Metro-style apps and go 

14
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
happily on your way. You are able to connect it to a docking station and take advan-
tage of the large, widescreen display, external keyboard, and mouse you keep in your 
home office. All is well.
But then you receive an attachment for work that includes a file type that’s not 
supported by any Metro-style app, perhaps an Adobe Photoshop file or WordPerfect 
document. If this were a traditional Windows 8 PC, you’d be able to install software to 
open this file. But on Windows RT, you’re kind of stuck until a Metro-style alternative 
appears.
There are a hundred scenarios like this where the lack of real Windows compatibility 
can hurt: browser alternatives, browser add-ins, games, and more.
As a rule, the decision will often come down to the very general difference 
between the Metro-style environment that will be your primary interface on Win-
dows RT devices and the Windows desktop, which will be far more powerful and 
usable on Intel-compatible PCs (and will certainly be the primary interface as well, 
especially on traditional desktop PCs and laptops). And that difference is this: Metro 
is (largely) for consuming content and the desktop is (largely) for productivity. When 
you want to browse the web, check Facebook, perform simple e‑mail activities, enjoy 
music or a movie, and perform other consumption-style activities, Metro is the place 
to be. And if this is all you’re doing with the PC or device, or almost all you’re doing, 
an ARM-based Windows RT device should be ideal. You need a device, not a PC.
If you need to do anything creative or productive—regularly create word process-
ing documents, edit spreadsheets, or make presentations, and so on—you need a Win-
dows 8-based PC running on an Intel-compatible chipset. You need a PC, not a device.
What’s confusing is that the lines are blurring between the two types of products. 
That is, there are Intel-compatible tablets, and there are ARM-based laptops. The 
adoption of the ARM platform gives Windows users a choice. But it also provides a 
new bit of confusion.
Speaking of which, let’s talk device types.
Picking a PC or Device Type
With a few exceptions, the PC world has consisted of two major device types to date: the 
venerable desktop PC and the laptop. Sure, there were exceptions, like the poorly-selling 
Tablet PCs that barely made a blip in the marketplace in the early 2000s, the successful 
but short-lived and inexpensive netbooks, and so on. But for the past 20 years or more, 
we’ve pretty much had two choices: desktops and laptops.

15
Picking a Windows 8 PC or Tablet
With Windows 8, that’s changing. On the desktop side, all-in-one computers 
modeled on Apple’s successful iMac are becoming more and more popular, and out-
selling traditional tower PCs with detached monitors.
But portable computers, overall, are far more successful than any desktops, 
and with Windows 8 (and RT), an estimated 80 percent of new computers sold will 
be portable PCs and devices. And in addition to traditional laptops and the thin 
and light Ultrabooks, we’re seeing interesting new hybrid PCs—laptops where the 
screen can flip around to turn the device into a tablet—as well as slate-like tablet 
devices similar to Apple’s iPad.
Here’s a rundown of PC and device types to consider.
Desktop PC/Workstation
For those who prefer or need the ultimate in expandability, PC makers still offer tradi-
tional desktop computers, which typically come in some form of tower configuration 
in which the guts of the computer—or what some erroneously describe as the CPU—are 
separated from the display, keyboard, mouse, and other external peripherals, including 
speakers, microphone and web camera, external drives, and more.
The advantage of a desktop computer is manifold, but the primary advantage is 
expandability: You can install multiple internal hard drives inside the PC’s case, as well 
as external expansion cards for USB, video capture, and the video card, among others. 
Desktop computers also tend to have more ports—especially of the USB variety—and 
can be easily expanded to accommodate more.
Desktop computers will remain the machine of choice for power users of all 
kinds, as well as those with high-end needs, including graphic designers, CAD 
designers, hard-core gamers, and others. Some desktop PCs are referred to as 
workstations, though that name is quickly losing favor. That said, PCs that utilize 
server-class CPUs can be considered workstations.
A typical desktop PC is shown in Figure 1-4.
The vast majority of traditional desktop PCs are  
Intel-compatible machines, not ARM-based PCs. One 
exception is ultra-small form factor PCs, which can  
be found in both configurations.
All-in-One
Thanks to Apple’s iMac, there’s been a resurgence in all-
in-one computers, a special form of desktop PC in which 
almost all of the components—including the CPU and 
Figure 1-4: Traditional 
desktop PCs are less popular 
than they were 10 years 
ago, but they’re not going 
anywhere.

16
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
“guts,” the screen, the speakers, the microphone and  
web camera, and all of the ports—are found in a single,  
generally slim and attractive form factor. All that’s found  
separately from the box are the keyboard and mouse, and  
of course any additional external peripherals.
All-in-one computers, like the one shown in  
Figure 1-5, are typically very attractive, with a sleek  
and modern design.
While both Intel-compatible and ARM-based  
all-in-ones are available, most are Intel-compatible  
designs.
Laptop and Portable Workstation
The venerable laptop computer survived a temporary wave of competition from low-
end netbooks. But with those toy-like computers disappearing from the market, 
there’s a new more ideal option arriving in the form of Ultrabooks, thin and light 
laptop computers that generally cost under $1,000— 
often well under $1,000—and things don’t look good  
for traditional laptops (see Figure 1-6). Suffice to say  
that laptops will of course continue in the market, and  
some high-end models might be considered portable  
workstations. But the Ultrabook, described in the next  
section, will almost certainly take over this segment of  
the market during Windows 8’s lifetime.
Most laptops and all portable workstations are  
Intel-type designs, but you can find ARM-based  
Windows RT laptops as well.
Netbook
Although netbooks (Figure 1-7) were all the rage when Windows 7 first shipped in 
2009, this low-cost alternative to the laptop has since fallen out of favor. And while 
Windows 8 is certainly capable of running rather well on the low-end hardware that’s 
found in such machines—a 1 GHz Atom-class processor and 2 GB of RAM—this version 
of Windows is not suited to netbooks very much at all.
The issue is the screen. Most netbooks ship with 1024 x 600 resolution screens, 
which is fine for the Windows desktop but below the 1024 x 768 minimum—and the 
recommended 1366 x 768—resolution needed for the Metro environment. This means 
that if you do install Windows 8 on a netbook class computer and try to run any

but offer much more on-
screen real estate.

Metro-style app, even Windows Store, you’re going to  
get a full-screen error message. It just won’t work.
You won’t see Windows RT-based netbooks. These  
machines have come and gone.
Ultrabooks
Most people understand the basic concept behind a 
laptop: It’s a portable computer with a clamshell case 
design in which the laptop lid can be closed over the 
keyboard for easy portability. An Ultrabook is simply a modern take on the laptop, 
but with some rules. First, Ultrabooks are much thinner and lighter than traditional 
laptops and are thus much easier to carry around. Second, Ultrabooks feature the 
latest Intel CPUs and chipsets, which are designed to perform well and offer excellent 
battery life. Third, Ultrabooks must obtain at least five hours of battery life, which 
is decent, though most offer more. And they must offer USB 3.0-based connectivity 
(which we discuss later in the chapter).
A typical Ultrabook is shown in Figure 1-8.
There’s a final, unofficial requirement of  
Ultrabooks, and it’s perhaps the best of them all. 
Ultrabooks generally cost less than $1,000, and 
many cost closer to $650. (On the flip side, some 
high-end Ultrabooks cost almost as much as 
low-end Mac laptops. Almost.)
Speaking of Macs, the Ultrabook design was 
clearly based on Apple’s trendsetting MacBook 
Air line. And not surprisingly, many of the first  
generation Ultrabooks—which appeared in the year before Windows 8’s release—
looked an awful lot like the Apple entry, albeit it while costing hundreds of dollars 
less. You can expect more innovative and unique designs to appear in the coming 
years as PC makers become more familiar with this type of device.
Ultrabooks are available in both Intel-compatible and ARM-based designs, but 
the Intel underpinnings are far more common.
Tablet/Slate
We assume most people have seen an iPad, and given that device’s popularity, it 
should come as no surprise that Microsoft and its PC maker partners have raced to 
Figure 1-7: Netbooks can’t 
run Metro-style apps.
Figure 1-8: Beauty and brains: 
Ultrabooks have it all.

C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
create both an operating system, Windows 8/RT, and a wide variety of multi-touch-
based tablet devices that can blow the iPad’s doors off.
The nice thing about Windows 8/RT-based tablets is the variety. You have numer-
ous machines to choose from, on both the Intel-compatible and ARM sides of the 
fence, and they come in a variety of sizes, with screens that range from 7 inches on 
up. A standard slate-style tablet can be seen in Figure 1-9.
Tablets are also not limited by their form factor.  
Many can be docked and easily expanded with an 
external screen, keyboard, mouse, and other 
peripherals, becoming, in effect, a full-fledged PC 
in the process. In this usage scenario, a tablet can 
work much like an iPad while you’re out and about, 
accessed solely through its multi-touch capabili-
ties. But when you get home—or to work—and dock 
the device, you have a real PC (Figure 1-10).

Picking a Windows 8 PC or Tablet
The tablet market is pretty evenly split between ARM- and Intel-compatible designs, 
and many of both types are available. This is the one type of PC where ARM-based 
products may eventually outsell the entrenched Intel juggernaut. In fact, Microsoft is 
betting pretty heavily on this market and is releasing its own Windows RT-based tablet 
device, called Surface, and a Windows 8-based tablet PC, called Surface Pro. Both look 
almost identical, and resemble the device shown in Figure 1-11. But the Intel-based PC 
version is more powerful and a bit thicker and heavier.
 
Figure 1-11: Microsoft Surface RT
Hybrid PC
Ultrabooks are obviously a huge improvement over traditional laptops but they suffer 
a bit when compared to tablets in certain situations. For example, Ultrabooks aren’t 
as personal as tablets and aren’t as easily used in casual situations, such as when you 
are sitting in bed. Fortunately, PC makers have created a range of hybrid devices that 
bridge this gap, offering the best of both product lines.
The most basic of such hybrid PCs dates back to Microsoft’s first foray into Tablet 
PC computing in the early 2000s. This type of machine, called a convertible laptop, is 
essentially a laptop or Ultrabook computer in which the screen is permanently attached 
on a swivel. So you can use a convertible laptop like a regular laptop or Ultrabook, or 
you can flip the screen around and lock it over the keyboard, creating a somewhat thick 
tablet device in the process.
A convertible laptop like the one shown in Figure 1-12 is ideal for those who 
usually need a full-fledged laptop but would occasionally like to use the device in 
tablet mode.

20
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
Slate hybrids are essentially tablets that can  
accommodate a clip-on keyboard base, sometimes with 
an extra battery under the keyboard to provide better 
off-power run time. This design essentially reverses the 
convertible laptop usage pattern and is best used by 
those who will use the PC in tablet mode primarily but 
sometimes need to type as well.
You will find both Intel-compatible and ARM-based 
hybrid PCs of all kinds.
Hardware Capabilities to Look For
Once you’ve determined whether to stick with an Intel-compatible machine or switch 
to an ARM-based device, chosen the Windows version you need, and picked out the 
type of PC or device that suits your fancy, there’s one more area of concern. And it 
concerns new hardware capabilities, some of which won’t be available on certain PCs 
or devices.
With each new Windows release, Microsoft supports a wider range of hardware 
devices and peripherals, of course. But with Windows 8 and the new portable sce-
narios that are opened up by tablets, Ultrabooks, and hybrids, the possibilities 
have expanded dramatically. And many of these possibilities are tied directly to 
new hardware capabilities that you should be aware of.
Here are some of the more relevant new hardware capabilities you should consider.
Multi-Touch
While Windows has offered pervasive multi-touch support since Windows Vista, the 
release of Windows 8 has changed things pretty dramatically. Instead of simply tack-
ing multi-touch support on top of Windows as was done in previous releases, Windows 
8 has been re-architected so that multi-touch is a full-fledged input type, alongside 
the mouse and keyboard. And in the new Metro environment, multi-touch is arguably 
even better supported than is mouse and keyboard. It is, as Microsoft puts it, a touch-
first environment.
We discuss multi-touch throughout this book, but it’s important to know that 
multi-touch isn’t just relegated to tablets. In fact, once you start using Windows 8 
via multi-touch, you’re going to expect this capability on all of your PCs. And not sur-
prisingly, multi-touch devices of all kinds have come to market alongside Windows 8, 
including touch-capable displays that can attach to desktop computers, and touch-
based Ultrabooks, hybrid PCs, and even all-in-ones.
Figure 1-12: A hybrid lap-
top lets you use the machine 
as a laptop or a tablet.

21
Picking a Windows 8 PC or Tablet
You may not believe it until you try it. But once you’ve experienced multi-touch, 
you’ll find yourself touching all of your screens, whether they’re touch-capable or not.
NO TE ​ ​Still not convinced? Know this: Microsoft requires that all Windows 8 
devices support at least five touch points. That translates to a hand of fingers—
or foot of toes—that are able to interact with Windows and apps all at once. And 
many devices will of course support even more touch points.
C ROSSREF  ​Check out Chapter 3 for more information about Metro and its 
multi-touch interactions.
Connected Standby
While Windows’s support for power management has evolved over the years, the new 
emphasis on highly portable computing in Windows 8 has triggered the development 
of an excellent new power management mode called Connected Standby. This mode 
isn’t generally available on PCs created before 2012 and is designed for new, highly 
portable devices that will only rarely be turned off. In other words, it works much like 
power management on a modern smartphone.
Instead of using a standard sleep state, Connected Standby allows your PC or device 
to enter a nearly powerless state in which battery life is only minimally impacted but 
Metro-style apps can run in the background, performing tasks like updating e‑mail 
and triggering notifications. Of course, traditional desktop applications are unaware of 
this new power mode, so Windows 8 utilizes a new Desktop Activity Monitor to reduce 
the resource utilization of desktop applications while in this mode.
Connected Standby is available in all Windows 8 versions, including Windows RT, 
but will work best on new hardware designed specifically for this mode. But even if 
your PC or device doesn’t support Connected Standby, Windows 8 includes numerous 
power management improvements that should improve battery life and performance 
when compared to performing similar tasks in Windows 7.
Sensors
Many of Windows 8’s new capabilities are inspired by smartphones and other highly 
mobile devices and the new wireless scenarios these devices enable. Key among these 
capabilities is a support for a variety of sensors, small hardware devices that provide 

22
C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
interaction between the outside world and Windows itself. Some of the new scenarios 
supported by Windows 8 and sensors include:
Adaptive screen brightness control: 
3
3
In the past, controlling screen bright-
ness was at best semi-automatic. You could manually configure a brightness 
setting in Power Options. Or those with portable computers could use power 
modes to automatically change the screen brightness to one of two settings, 
depending on whether the machine was attached to power. In Windows 8, the 
situation is much more sophisticated, and if you have a PC or device with an 
ambient light sensor (ALS), Windows 8 will automatically change the bright-
ness of the screen on the fly. This capability is better for your eyes and for 
readability, but it can also improve battery life when you use the PC or device 
in a dimly lit area.
Automatic screen rotation:

3
 Tablets and hybrid devices and other screens can 
utilize an accelerometer to determine the orientation of the screen and rotate 
the on-screen display appropriately as it’s changed. This type of activity is 
common on smartphones and, with Windows 8, it’s come to PCs as well.
Tilt and motion:
3
3
 Using a gyroscope sensor, a Windows 8-based PC or tablet 
can register its movements in 3-D space, providing feedback to games and 
apps. In this way, you might tilt a tablet forward to accelerate during a driv-
ing game, or tilt the device to the left and right to steer. This isn’t limited to 
just games, however, and the types of motions gyroscope sensors can detect—
including shakes, twists, and rotations in multiple dimensions—are quite 
sophisticated.
Location and directions:

Using a standard GPS sensor, a Windows 8 PC or 
device can accurately report its geographic location and then plot routes and 
distances to other destinations. Mapping and driving apps are obvious appli-
cations for this capability.

 Using a 3-D accelerometer and a 3-D magnetometer, or a gyroscope, 
a Windows 8 PC or device can emulate a compass. In fact, they can be used to 
create a multi-axis, tilt-sensitive compass.
Tap to Send (NFC)
Utilizing new Near Field Communication (NFC) chipsets, Windows 8-based PCs  
and devices can send content to another compatible device (Windows 8 PC or device, 
Windows Phone 8, or other NFC-compatible device) using a new method called Tap to 

23
Picking a Windows 8 PC or Tablet
Send. This method additionally requires a unique tap zone on the device’s exterior, 
which is used to initiate a send or receive action, but even without this part, NFC can 
still be used via Bluetooth to send information wirelessly.
So what’s the big deal with NFC? As an emerging standard, NFC is being used to 
perform contactless (that is, wireless) payments at retail locations, data exchanges, 
and other duties. And while these activities may seem better suited to a smartphone, 
the inclusion of NFC in Windows 8 means that these PCs and devices will be able to 
participate with coming NFC-based systems as well.
UEFI Firmware
New Windows 8-based PCs and devices will utilize a new type of firmware called Unified 
Extensible Firmware Interface, or UEFI, instead of the old-fashioned BIOS firmware 
we’ve been using for decades. UEFI provides many advantages over BIOS, but key among 
them is performance: UEFI-based PCs and devices will boot much more quickly than 
those based on BIOS.
UEFI offers other advantages over BIOS, of course. The user interface for this 
firmware type can be graphical instead of text-based like BIOS. And it enables a new 
security feature called Secure Boot that protects system components from tampering 
during boot.
C ROSSREF  ​UEFI and Secure Boot are discussed a bit more in Chapter 12.
USB 3.0
Don’t buy a Windows 8 PC that includes only USB 2.0 ports. Rated at throughput 
speeds of up to 5 Gbps, USB 3.0 is up to 10 times faster than USB 2.0 (480 Mbps), 
which can have a significant impact on the performance of certain peripherals, 
especially hard disks.
USB 3.0 has other advantages over USB 2.0, though. You can mix and match 
USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices on a single controller without impacting the speed of the 
faster USB 3.0 devices. (This was an issue with USB 2.0 controllers, which would 
ratchet the speed of all devices down to 12 Mbps if a USB 1.0 device was attached.) 
USB 3.0 also provides more power to devices, removing the need for USB 2.0-type 
double connectors and speeding the charge time of battery-powered devices. And 
while the plugs look a bit different, they’re 100 percent compatible with previous 
generation devices.

C h a p t e r  1    Choosing Windows 8 Versions, PCs and Devices, and Hardware
Summary
With every Windows release, customers face challenges when it comes to picking the 
correct Windows version. And while Windows 8 is no different in this regard, it does 
at least offer the simplest product lineup we’ve seen in over a decade, with just two 
mainstream retail versions—Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro—being offered alongside 
a version for ARM-based devices that’s called Windows RT.
The addition of an ARM-based variant of Windows 8, sold only with new Windows-
based devices, is perhaps where things get trickiest. Picking between such a device 
and a PC based on more traditional Intel-compatible chipsets can be difficult, but not 
insurmountable if you understand the differences and issues.
Also, for the first time in many years, you’re going to want to pay close attention 
to the hardware peripherals and sensors that come with your PC or devices. Windows 
8 and Windows RT are far more useful when used on a machine with the latest hard-
ware capabilities, so be sure to shop carefully, regardless of which Windows 8 version 
or processor architecture you choose.

With previous Windows versions, Microsoft offered a fairly  
static set of capabilities by which one could install the OS onto a new or existing com-
puter. These capabilities were based on the same underlying functionality but were 
designed to serve three basic audiences: end users, businesses, and PC makers, and not 
necessarily in that order. As such, the process was pretty technical for the typical user, 
which wasn’t much of a problem because very few users actually installed Windows this 
way anyway. Most acquired Windows with a new PC purchase or, perhaps, through a 
work-based PC.
With Windows 7, however, those usage patterns changed somewhat. For the first time, 
a significant percentage of Windows users upgraded existing PCs running a previous 
version of Windows to Windows 7, and to do so they typically purchased a retailed, boxed 
copy of the new OS, in Upgrade form, and then performed the upgrade manually.

26
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
The reason for this sudden change is obvious: With Windows 7, for the first 
time, a new version of Windows actually had system requirements that matched, 
not exceeded, those of the previous version. So while many users did of course buy 
new, Windows 7-based PCs—several hundreds of millions of them, in fact—many 
also chose to continue using their existing computers as well.
With Windows 8, Microsoft expects a mix of both traditional PC sales and retail 
upgrades, again because Windows 8 does not exceed the system requirements of its 
own predecessor. And many users will simply purchase a Windows 8-based device, 
such as a tablet, and then upgrade their existing PC as well so that they can take 
advantage of this Windows version’s excellent PC-to-PC sync and integration capa-
bilities. So, since many users would still be installing Windows 8 on their own going 
forward, Microsoft has evolved the Windows Setup process yet again. And this time, 
finally, we think they got it right.
As is the case throughout this book, we’ll be focusing largely on new features and 
functionality, in this case with regards to Setup and installing Windows 8 on your 
own PCs. But don’t worry, power users: If you have specific setup needs, we cover 
those as well.
NO TE ​ ​What about Windows RT? This ARM-based version of Windows 8 comes 
only with new hardware and cannot be purchased in software-only form, either 
in retail packaging or electronically, as with Windows 8. So the only Windows 
Setup experience you’ll have will involve the so-called out-of-box experience, 
or OOBE, that’s discussed later in the chapter. But since that bit is so obvious, 
Windows RT users can feel free to skip much of the information in this chapter.
That Was Then, This Is Now: How Setup 
Has Changed
With Windows 7 and previous Windows versions, Microsoft provided a monolithic 
installation application called Windows Setup that was custom-tailored for managed 
businesses and PC makers but could also be used, in manual form, by end users. This 
same Setup application came with both the Full and Upgrade versions of Windows 
and provided a consistent interface between the two.
Those who purchase Windows 8 today in retail, boxed form will find that Setup—
shown in Figure 2-1—hasn’t changed much since Windows 7. The color scheme is a bit 

27
That Was Then, This Is Now: How Setup Has Changed
different, the out-of-box experience (OOBE) steps / those that appear after Setup is 
complete and you have to enter some information about yourself and the PC) are now 
touch-enabled and evolved, and the whole process is a bit shorter. But overall, things 
haven’t changed much.
 
Figure 2-1: Windows Setup
This is both good and bad.
For businesses and PC makers, it means that the tools and methods they use to blast 
Windows 8 images onto PCs will be familiar and efficient, and not require training. This, 
after all, is what Windows Setup was really made for anyway.
But for end users, this old-fashioned setup routine is incomplete and inef-
ficient. It doesn’t include vital and important tools such as the Upgrade Advisor, 
which provides you with a compatibility report for your hardware and software 
before you install Windows, or Windows Easy Transfer, which makes upgrades and 
migrations of data possible. Furthermore, Setup won’t work well electronically, so 
those who hope to install or upgrade to Windows 8 over the Internet would need to 
first download the massive Windows installer file set—roughly 3.5 to 5 GB, depend-
ing on the version, then burn it to disc or copy to a specially made, bootable USB 
hard drive or flash drive. And then they would need to boot the computer with that 
device and go through the manual setup process.
Yes, you can do this if you really want to. But there’s a better way.

28
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
NO TE ​ ​Those who wish to install Windows 8 the old-fashioned way should 
consult Paul’s website, winsupersite.com, where the clean install and 
upgrade/migration scenarios are fully documented. But we provide some 
related information later in the chapter for those who are forced to continue 
using these methods.
Using the Windows 8 Web Installer
With Windows 8, Microsoft has combined three of its Windows installation tools 
into a single web-based version of Setup that overcomes virtually all of the problems 
with the traditional, monolithic Setup application. Available at windows.com, this 
new installer can perform a clean install, upgrade, or migration to Windows 8 more 
quickly and more reliably than ever before.
Understanding Why the Web-Based Setup Is Superior
To understand why this new web-based Setup is superior, consider how you used to 
install Windows (and how, optionally, you still can with the retail-type Setup applica-
tion in Windows 8) and why you would be performing this task in the first place.
The most common reason you’d find yourself wasting an afternoon—or more 
commonly, an entire day—futzing around with Windows Setup and the attendant 
activities you must undergo is that you’ve got an existing PC running the previous 
Windows version and you’d like to upgrade. This Setup type was fraught with the 
possibility of disaster, and since you may want to bring your settings and data along 
with you—called a migration—or even your currently-installed applications—called 
an in-place upgrade—the times and places in which something could go wrong—
resulting, perhaps, in data loss—could multiply as well.
The second most common reason to run the traditional Windows Setup routine 
is that you’ve been using Windows for a while and your PC is starting to slow down. 
And what you’d like to do is back up all your settings and data, run Setup, wipe out 
Windows, and just reinstall it from scratch. This is called a clean install of Windows, 
though Microsoft for some reason refers to it as a custom install.
Clean installs are a tricky business. Assuming you get through Setup without 
any issues—which, to be fair, doesn’t require a lot of skill—that doesn’t mean you’re 
done. The trouble is that Setup might not have found all the drivers for your PC. Even 
www.allitebooks.com

29
Using the Windows 8 Web Installer
though Windows Update can often find more drivers, that won’t help if your network 
adapter driver is among the missing and you can’t get online. Regardless, it’s very 
common to visit Device Manager and discover that some hardware devices were not 
properly configured with drivers. And the name of a device in Device Manager some-
times doesn’t even provide a hint about what the device really is, making the process 
of finding the correct driver next to impossible.
A related issue is that even the most fastidious advocate of backing up may miss 
something. As you recover your data and start reinstalling applications after a clean 
install, you may discover that you forgot to de-authorize an application like Apple 
iTunes or Adobe Photoshop, didn’t back up a critical but hidden data file (like Outlook’s 
notorious PST file), or missed some other palm-slap-to-the-forehead, obvious-after-
the-fact thing that you really wish you had remembered. But once you’ve blown away 
your previous Windows install, it’s too late.
Microsoft tried to alleviate these issues in the past with solutions that were 
separate from and ran outside of Setup. One, called Upgrade Advisor, evaluated the 
hardware, devices, and installed software on your PC and then presented you with a 
report containing, potentially, a list of issues you may need to address before install-
ing Windows. A second utility, called Windows Easy Transfer, took the guesswork out 
of files (documents, pictures, movies, and so on), e‑mail, and settings from the pre-
vious version of Windows to the new version. You would run Windows Easy Transfer 
twice: once against the previous version of Windows to acquire this data and then 
again under the new version to apply it all back.
Upgrade Advisor and Windows Easy Transfer are both excellent tools, but they 
suffer from the same basic problems: You need to know they exist, and obtain them, 
and do so before you install Windows. And there’s nothing in Windows Setup to even 
suggest that such tools are available. As a result, many users simply don’t know about 
them and run into problems these tools could have easily fixed.
In Windows 8, the traditional Windows Setup routine doesn’t solve these issues, 
and it works much like that of its predecessor. But the new web-based installer does 
solve these issues, and it does so in the most obvious way possible: It integrates both 
the Upgrade Advisor and Windows Easy Transfer directly into Setup, making these 
processes not just discoverable but obvious and unavoidable.
The web-based installer has other advantages as well.
For example, with traditional, media-based installs of Windows, you need to 
know whether you have a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) version of Windows and then 
buy and use the appropriate Upgrade media when performing an in-place upgrade. 
With the Windows 8 web-based installer, this is handled for you behind the scenes.
Windows Easy

Transfer had 
other onerous 
requirements. You 
needed an external 
hard drive, network 
location, or even 
a crazy, specially 
designed USB cable  
to use this utility.

30
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
Each Windows Setup disc or download also comes with an associated product key, 
a complex, 25-digit sequence of letters and numbers that you must manually enter 
accurately before Setup will continue and, later, activate Windows. With the web-based 
installer, this product key is tied to your Microsoft account and automatically applied 
to the install during setup. It’s yet another thing you don’t need to be worried about.
Also, the Windows 8 web-based installer uses a new form of compression that 
is specially tuned for the massive Windows Imaging (WIM) file that makes up the 
majority (size-wise) of the files that form Windows Setup. So it’s far more efficient 
to stream this file from the web while running Setup than the old method of down-
loading a disc image file (in ISO format), burning that to disc (or installing to USB), 
rebooting the computer, and running Setup that way.
Put simply, the new web-based installer is faster and far more full-featured than 
the traditional, media-based Setup variant. Like we said earlier, we can’t imagine 
why you wouldn’t want to use it.
NO TE ​ ​Well, there are always reasons, of course. Enthusiasts who purchase or 
build their own computer without a copy of Windows preinstalled may need to 
install Windows 8 the old-fashioned way. For such cases, Microsoft does allow 
you to download an ISO version of Windows Setup as before, and then create 
your own Setup disc or USB device. Remember, Windows is all about choice.
NO TE ​ ​Okay, there’s one other reason. If you’ve been running Windows 8 for 
a while and would like to reinstall the OS from scratch, there’s a new, quicker 
way than with previous methods. It’s called Push Button Reset, and it can work 
in one of two ways: A factory-fresh, literally new install of Windows or a new 
install of Windows in which your settings and Metro-style apps are retained as 
well. This new feature is so amazing and so useful that we devote a lot of time 
to it in Chapter 11.
Step-by-Step: Installing Windows 8
Before you can install Windows 8 with the web-based installer, you will need 
to visit Microsoft’s Windows website (windows.com), sign in with your Micro-
soft account, and purchase the version of Windows you’d like to use. Microsoft 
will provide you with a product key, which you won’t need if you’re using these

instructions, and then provide you with an opportunity to run Windows Setup 
from the web or download the operating system in ISO format so that you can burn 
it to disc or copy it to a bootable USB device later. Choose the former.
This initial download is tiny, about 5 MB, and it initiates Windows 8 Setup. You 
can run this file directly from your browser or choose to save it to the hard drive and 
then run.
In the first phase of the wizard-based Setup application that launches, an 
Upgrade Advisor-type tool runs and polls your software applications and hardware 
devices to see whether everything is compatible with Windows 8. When the com-
patibility check is complete, the wizard will indicate whether you have any items 
that need your attention. (See Figure 2-2.) If you’re lucky, this will be a short list, 
but no worries yet. As you may discover, most of the items that require your atten-
tion are minor.
 
Figure 2-2: Cross your fingers. You could be lucky here.
To see what’s wrong, click the link titled See compatibility details. This report, 
shown in Figure 2-3, can be printed or saved to disk, but oftentimes you can deal with 
the pertinent issues immediately.

32
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
 
Figure 2-3: The Compatibility details report
In our experience, some typical issues do arise here. These include:
Microsoft Security Essentials: 
3

Microsoft’s free antivirus solution is not 
compatible with Windows 8, so you will need to uninstall it before Setup 
will continue. (You will be prompted to do so.)
Apple iTunes:

The compatibility checker is nice enough to remind you to 
de-authorize your iTunes account from within the iTunes application before 
continuing. However, you should remember that some other applications 
will need to be de-authorized as well, including some from Adobe, such as 
Photoshop.
Other software issues: 
3
3
The compatibility report lists any software applica-
tions that will not work in Windows 8, many of which will be accompanied by 
a link so you can get help on the application’s website. If you see such a mes-
sage, save the compatibility report to disk, back it up, and use it later to make 
the fix(es).

33
Using the Windows 8 Web Installer
Other hardware issues:
3
3
 Some hardware drivers may need to be updated after 
Windows 8 installs, and the compatibility report will call out some of them 
with a message to get updated drivers from Windows Update or the manufac-
turer’s website. This necessity is discussed in the section about post-Setup 
tasks later in the chapter.
When you’re ready, close the compatibility report and click Next.
Next, Setup says it’s ready to download Windows and notes that a product key has 
been “pre-keyed,” or pre-applied to the installation. This means you won’t have to type 
a 25-digit alphanumeric product key as you do with a manual clean or upgrade install.
Click Next and the wizard will download the rest of Windows 8 Setup. This pro-
cedure should just take a few minutes on a high-speed connection, but it could take 
much longer, of course. As Setup notes, you can continue using the previous Windows 
version during this process.
Once the full set of installation files are downloaded, Setup will check the integ-
rity of the downloaded files. This is important because large chunks of the Setup pro-
cess occur when the PC is offline and once it begins, there’s no way to elegantly recover 
should a corrupt file be encountered.
When that process completes, Setup reports that it is getting files ready. This is a 
plain English way of explaining that Setup is decompressing the compressed files it 
previously downloaded. So this process could take a few minutes as well.
When it completes, Setup then prompts you to select one of several choices, as 
shown in Figure 2-4. These can include Install now, Install by creating media, or 
Install later from your desktop.
 
Figure 2-4: You can defer the install or copy the installation  
files to DVD or USB.
A fourth option,

partition, can also 
appear if you’re  
using a PC with 
multiple disk drives  
or partitions.

34
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
These choices seem straightforward, but the second option is a cleverly  
disguised way to trigger a process whereby you can install the Setup files to  
a DVD or USB memory device. This allows you to perform a more traditional, if  
less seamless, installation later, or to another PC.
If you’re ready to go for it, choose Install now and then click Next.
NO TE ​ ​Setup may prompt you to check for software updates here. We strongly 
recommend performing this check, since there are occasionally newer compo-
nents available online. That said, this will be more of an issue if you previously 
deferred the install for some reason using the Install later option in the previ-
ous step of the wizard.
After a bit of churning, Setup will present the End User License Agreement (EULA). 
You must accept the license terms before you can click the Accept button to continue. 
It’s like you’re accepting it twice.
The next screen, shown in Figure 2-5, determines what type of install you will 
perform. Because this is so important, and can vary from PC to PC, we’ll need to spend 
a bit of time on this. (This figure was obtained by running the Windows 8 Setup from 
Windows 7.)

35
Using the Windows 8 Web Installer
You are asked to choose what you want to keep, and there will be some mix of 
the following choices here, depending on which version of Windows you’re currently 
running:
Keep Windows settings, personal files, and app[lication]s: 
3
3
This install 
type equates to what used to be called an in-place upgrade. This means that 
virtually everything from your existing Windows installation, including 
applications—we’re not sure why Microsoft uses the term apps here—will 
come forward as the OS is upgraded to Windows 8. This is the most complete 
install type because nothing will be lost. And it’s available only to those who 
are currently running Windows 7.
Keep Windows settings and personal files only: 
3
3
This hybrid option, which 
can be considered an advanced migration, saves your custom settings as well 
as everything in your personal folders (all of your documents, desktop files, 
and so on, as well as those for any other user accounts). This option is available 
only to those upgrading from Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 or 2.
Keep personal files only: 
3
3
This will perform what we used to call a migration, 
meaning that Setup will save everything in your personal folders (all of your doc-
uments, desktop files, and so on, as well as those for any other user accounts), 
wipe out the current Windows version, perform a clean install, and then copy 
the personal files back. What you lose with this type of install are your custom 
settings and your installed applications. This option is available to all supported 
Windows versions, including Windows 7, Windows Vista (all versions), and Win-
dows XP with Service Pack 3.
Nothing:
3
3
 This is the clean install, or what Microsoft calls a custom install.  
In this install type, Setup will wipe out all of the files and data on the disk  
and then install a factory-fresh version of Windows. Everything that was 
there will be lost. This option is also available to all supported Windows ver-
sions, including Windows 7, Windows Vista (all versions), and Windows XP 
with Service Pack 3.
W ARN ING ​ ​We can’t stress this enough: Trust technology to do the right thing, 
but have a backup plan, in this case literally. That is, yes, Setup will most likely 
not lose any data during a migration or in-place upgrade. But just in case, be 
sure to copy your important data to a removable drive and then remove that 
drive during Setup.
And yes, these 
3

options are part 
of what used to 
be Windows Easy

36
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
After making your selection, Setup will collect its wits and determine if there are 
any more steps to perform before it begins the actual process of applying Windows 8 
to the PC.
You may recall that Setup could have previously informed you that one or more 
applications will need to be uninstalled before Windows 8 can be installed. If this is 
the case, you will see a prompt like the one in Figure 2-6. Here, Microsoft Security 
Essentials will need to be uninstalled before Setup continues. Click the Uninstall 
button next to any applications that need to be uninstalled.
 
Figure 2-6: Some applications will need to be uninstalled before Setup  
will complete.
After this process completes, Setup may need to restart the PC, depending on 
which types of tasks it asked you to complete. If so, Setup will resume immediately 
and automatically after the reboot, and it will prompt you to continue from where you 
left off or start over from the beginning. Choose the former and then click Next.
Setup will again check to make sure there are no more steps to take before it can 
install Windows 8. Finally, it will present the screen in Figure 2-7 that verifies the 
type of install you’ve chosen. You can make a last minute change to that install type 
if you’re unsure.
Click Install to continue. Setup will switch into a full-screen mode install Windows 8. 
During this process, which will involve a few reboots, Setup will configure hardware 
and install device drivers. It will also reapply your Windows settings, personal files, and 
other files if you configured it to do so.

Figure 2-7: One last check and you’re ready to install Windows 8.
When Windows 8 is finally ready, the computer will reboot for the last time and 
the out-of-box experience, or OOBE, will appear. In the first phase of the OOBE, Per-
sonalize, you have just a single choice to make: your Metro color scheme, a set of two 
colors that includes an accent (or foreground) color and a background color. This 
scheme is used on all Metro experiences, including the Windows 8 Start screen (but 
not to the desktop), and all Metro apps. This screen is shown in Figure 2-8. Pick a 
color scheme then click Next.

If you are using a Windows PC or device with wireless networking hardware, you 
will next be asked to choose a wireless network and then, if required, enter a pass-
word. Do so and then click Next.
NO TE ​ ​What you’re not asked is which type of network you’re joining. In 
Windows Vista and 7, this was done via a network location, where you could 
choose between Home, Work, or Public. This occurs a bit later in Setup and is 
hidden if you choose a certain option, as you’ll see.
In the next part of OOBE, called Settings and shown in Figure 2-9, you can choose 
between Express Settings and Customize, which is a cute way to potentially cut the 
number of OOBE steps dramatically.

express-type options. That said, we actually choose Express settings here. But for

the customized route, and what the defaults are if you choose Express.
These options include:

A simplification of the Select your com-

turn on sharing and connect to devices (for home or work networks) or No, 
don’t turn on sharing or connect to devices (for networks in public places). 
The Express default is Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices. (See 
Figure 2-10.)

 Here, you configure Automatic Updates,

Finally, you’ll be asked to sign in to your PC, using a Microsoft account, as shown 
in Figure 2-14. You’ll see this regardless of whether you performed a clean install, 
upgrade, or migration using the web-based installer.
 
Figure 2-14: First Windows 8 sign-in
Windows 8 supports a new type of user account that is based around your Microsoft 
account, or what used to be called a Windows Live ID. And while you could still use the 
old-fashioned local account that you previously configured, we recommend accepting 
Setup’s offer to switch this account to one based on your Microsoft account. Doing so 
is highly recommended: You gain impressive PC-to-PC settings synchronization and 
integration functionality by enabling this account type. As a result, we will assume 
you do this.
Click Next.
In the next screen, you’ll be prompted for your Microsoft account password. Enter 
the password for your existing Microsoft account or click Sign up for a Microsoft 
account to turn any e‑mail address into a Microsoft account.

After clicking Next, you’ll be prompted to enter (or at least verify) your security 
verification info. To help you recover your password and keep your Microsoft account 
safe from hacking, this screen, shown in Figure 2-15, lets you configure a mobile 
phone number and alternate e‑mail address. You’ll receive a confirmation e‑mail at 
your primary e‑mail, and if agreed to, you can make the current PC a trusted PC for 
authentication purposes.

Now, Setup creates your account on the PC and finalizes settings, and then further 
prepares the PC and logs on to the Start screen. When it’s done, you should be presented 
with a Start screen similar to the one shown in Figure 2-16.
If you performed an in-place upgrade or a migration, now is the time to see which 
customizations made it across—check by clicking the Desktop tile—and to ensure 
that your documents and other files are where they belong. We examine post-Setup 
tasks later in the chapter, but this is a good place to begin.

Windows Setup: A Dying Breed
In some ways, this is all academic, even given the improvements Microsoft has 
made to Setup, especially with the web-based installer. That’s because perform-
ing a clean install will typically be a one-time affair with Windows 8, even for 
those that really need it: This version of Windows includes new Push Button Reset 
functionality that allows you to wipe out and quickly reinstall Windows 8 without 
needing to step through Setup again, as is the case with Windows 7 and previous 
Windows versions. So once you’ve got Windows 8 on a PC, it’s unlikely you’ll ever 
need to do this again. And since most people acquire Windows with a new PC, or 
upgrade from a previous release to the new version, most will never run through 
Setup this way at all. We examine Push Button Reset, and other ways to back up 
and restore, in Chapter 11.

45
Advanced Setup: Using the Old-School Installer 
Advanced Setup: Using the  
Old-School Installer
If you purchased a boxed, retail version of Windows 8 or would simply prefer to install 
Windows 8 the old-fashioned way, even with an electronic purchase, you can of course 
still do so. We don’t recommend it. But it’s important to realize that this option is still 
available.
If you purchased Windows 8 electronically from Microsoft, the web installer is the 
default install type. But you are also given the option to download the installer files 
as a disc image, or ISO, which you can then use to create a bootable Setup disc (or USB 
flash drive) so you can install Windows 8 at a later time or perhaps on another PC.
Getting Started
A couple of notes about this process:
Product key:
3
3
 Microsoft will provide you with a 25-digit product key that you 
must have handy during the Windows Setup process. We recommend printing 
this out if possible or having a second PC or device available nearby so that 
you can read this key from that second device and input it on the PC to which 
you are installing Windows 8.
Upgrade or Full:
3
3
 With previous Windows versions, Microsoft offered Upgrade 
and Full versions of each product edition. This time around there are only 
Upgrade versions, which can be used for both clean and upgrade installs.
32-bit or 64-bit:
3
3
 Like Windows 7, Windows 8 is available in both 32-bit (x86) 
and 64-bit (x64) variants. Generally speaking, you will want the 64-bit ver-
sion for a clean install or migration. But if you plan to perform an in-place 
upgrade, you will need to use the same version, 32- or 64-bit, as your current 
Windows version. You can find this information in the System control panel.
Product version: 
3
3
Windows 8 is available in multiple product versions, or 
SKUs (Stock Keeping Units). For a clean install, ensure that you’re buy-
ing the Windows 8 product version you want. For an upgrade or migration, 
ensure that you’re buying a product version that meets or exceeds the prod-
uct version of your current version of Windows.

46

Drivers: 
3
3
If you are performing a migration or in-place upgrade, it’s highly 
likely that Windows 8 will not recognize every hardware device and periph-
eral attached to your PC. So you will need to be ready with the drivers you 
may potentially need. At the least, make sure you have a Windows 7- or 
8-class driver for your PC’s network adapter so you can get online. Then, 
you can navigate to your PC vendor’s support website to download any 
remaining missing drivers. We discuss this process in more detail later  
in the chapter.
Creating a Bootable Windows Setup Disc or USB Key
If you downloaded an ISO file from Microsoft, you can use this file to create a boot-
able Windows 8 Setup DVD disc or USB memory key. How you do this will depend on 
which version of Windows you’re currently running. In this section, we’ll look at 
some common scenarios.
Creating a Windows Setup Disc with Windows 7
To create a bootable Windows Setup disc with Windows 7, simply double-click on 
the Windows 8 ISO file. The Windows Disc Image utility, shown in Figure 2-17, will 
launch and help you create this disc.
 
Figure 2-17: The Windows Disc Image  
utility can help you create a bootable  
Windows Setup disc.
You will need a

blank recordable 
DVD with a 
capacity of 4.7 GB 
or higher for this 
purpose.

Advanced Setup: Using the Old-School Installer 
Creating a Windows Setup Disc or Bootable USB Key with 
Windows 7 or Windows Vista
If you would rather use a bootable USB key to install Windows, or are using an older 
Windows version, you can use Microsoft’s excellent USB/DVD Download Tool, available 
from the Microsoft Store. This utility, shown in Figure 2-18, will guide you through the 
process of creating a bootable Windows 8 Setup disc or USB memory key.
 
Figure 2-18: The USB/DVD Download Tool
You can find this tool at tinyurl.com/4qfdm4x online.
Installing Windows 8 with Bootable Media
You can use the following basic steps to install Windows 8 using the boot media (Setup 
disc or USB flash drive) you just created. Note that since this process is advanced, we 
assume you know what you’re doing and will only be providing basic instructions.
Back up:
3
3
 You’re pretty much on your own with this one, but you will want to 
back up all of the important data and other files on your PC if you are install-
ing Windows 8 onto an existing machine. This is true regardless of whether 
you plan to perform a clean install, in-place upgrade, or migration. Remem-
ber: better safe than sorry.
Boot the PC with your Windows Setup media: 
3
3
You will most likely need to 
interrupt your PC’s boot process in order to boot from a USB memory key, 
especially. But this could be true for a bootable DVD as well. Consult your PC 
documentation—or pay attention when the BIOS screen appears—to discover 
how this works on your particular machine.
If you’re 
3
3
upgrading or 
migrating, you will 
run Windows Setup 
from within your 
existing version of 
Windows and not 
boot the PC with the 
media you created.

48
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
Run Windows Setup:

 The Windows 8 boot disc (or disk) will prompt you 
to Install Windows or access its recovery tools. Choose Install Windows, of 
course, and step through the wizard-based application. The initial steps are 
very similar to those described in the previous section about the web-based 
installer, though you will not be provided with an opportunity to generate a 
compatibility report.
Use the OOBE: 
3
3
After a few reboots, Windows Setup will load the out-of-box 
experience (OOBE), stepping you through the final configuration of your PC 
and user account. This process is identical to that described in the previous 
section about the web-based installer.
Post-install tasks:
3
3
 After you’ve signed in to Windows and have accessed the 
Windows 8 Start screen for the first time, the real fun begins. You’ll need to 
copy back any data, documents, and other files, reapply your personal settings, 
install Windows-based applications and new Metro-style apps, and, of course, 
ensure that Windows is up to date, both with software and driver updates.
We discuss this latter activity in the next section.
Post-Setup: Now What?
However you choose to install Windows 8, at some point you will be confronted with 
the blank slate of the new Start screen and may be wondering what happens next. 
Windows 8 may look quite a bit different than its predecessors, but this is one case 
where the general strategy remains the same. It’s time to engage in some post-Setup 
activities to ensure that your PC is up and running as efficiently as possible. More to 
the point, you need to ensure that you’re really done configuring Windows 8 so you 
can begin actually using it.
First, Complete the Driver Installs
The first step is to check your hardware drivers: Ideally, all of the hardware connected 
to your PC has been correctly detected and assigned an up-to-date driver. But that’s 
often not the case. There are two ways in which to trigger driver updates after Setup 
is complete: one automatic (and thus preferable) and one manual and considerably 
more difficult.
Let’s try the automatic route first: Visit Windows Update to trigger a check of the 
Microsoft Update service, which will be polled for three things, by default: software 

49
Post-Setup: Now What?
updates, security patches, and, yes, driver updates. There are many ways to run Win-
dows Update, and Windows 8 confusingly offers two interfaces to this functionality, 
the old control panel interface and a new, Metro-style version. Let’s use the latter.
To find the new Windows Update, tap Winkey+I from anywhere in Windows 8 to 
bring up the Settings pane. Then, choose the Change PC Settings link at the bottom 
of the screen. This will launch the new, full-screen PC Settings interface, a Metro-
style control panel experience. In the left pane, choose Windows Update from the 
bottom of the list and you’ll see a display similar to that shown in Figure 2-19.
 
Figure 2-19: The new Windows Update
Now, click Check for updates now to manually check for new updates. Download 
and install any updates and reboot as required. Repeat this process until Windows 8 
is completely up to date.
Once that’s done, you use a legacy Windows desktop tool called Device Manager, 
which is the easiest and most detailed way to ensure that all of your hardware is 
properly configured with drivers. As always, there are a number of ways to access the 
Device Manager, but the quickest (as is so often the case) is to use Start Search: Type 
Winkey+Q to bring up Search and then type device man. In the right pane, select Set-
tings, and then select Device Manager from the results list on the left.
This time, something interesting happens: The classic Windows desktop—that 
familiar environment from Windows 7 and previous Windows versions—appears and 
the old-school Device Manager window opens (see Figure 2-20).

50
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
 
Figure 2-20: Device Manager tells you at a glance which hardware devices are connected  
and properly configured for your PC.
If any of the entries, or nodes, in the Device Manager tree view are open, display-
ing a device with a small yellow exclamation point, or bang, then you’re going to need 
to install some drivers. If not, you’re in luck—truly, truly in luck—and you can jump 
ahead to the next section: Your PC is magically completely up to date.
For the rest of us poor slobs, there are a few options for rectifying this situation.
Automatically: 
3
3
Right-click the unsupported device and choose Update Driver 
Software. Windows will search the Internet (that is, Microsoft Update, the 
cloud-hosted service behind Windows Update) and the local system, including 
any setup disks, to find the appropriate driver. In our experience this method 
almost never works, but it’s worth trying.
Manually, with an executable setup disk or download:
3
3
 Many drivers come 
in self-contained executables whereby you run a setup routine just as you 
would for an application program. If possible, be sure to use a Windows 
8- or 7–compatible setup application or, if really pressed, one designed for 
Windows Vista.
In the latter case, you will want to visit your PC maker’s support website and 
search for the drivers that are specific for your system. Most of them will be fairly 

51
Advanced Windows 8 Setup Configurations
obvious, but in some cases you’ll run into devices in Device Manager that are listed 
with dummy or unhelpful names like “unsupported device,” “SM Bus,” or similar. Our 
advice is to start with chipset drivers, because these low-level, multi-device drivers 
often clear up any missing, or banged, devices.
Note, too, that Windows 8 will sometimes assign a default graphics driver and not 
use an up-to-date, optimized driver. You will know this is the case if Windows isn’t 
using the full resolution of your display. Right-click the Windows desktop and choose 
Screen resolution to check. If you can’t select the appropriate resolution, you’ll need 
to update the graphics driver too, even if it’s not banged out in Device Manager.
Next, Install Core Applications
With Windows 8 and older Windows versions, it was generally important to install a 
security solution, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, before continuing on to other 
applications. But Windows 8 includes the functionality from Security Essentials as 
part of the Windows Defender solution, so this is no longer necessary. If you prefer a 
third-party security solution for some reason, however, you should install that first.
Next, install your core applications one at a time and reboot if necessary after each 
install as requested. This process can often take a long time and is mind-numbingly 
boring, but you should have to do it only once.
Recover Your Data
After your key applications are installed, it’s time to restore any data that you might 
have backed up from your previous Windows install. How you do this will vary depend-
ing on how you backed up that data, but we use the Microsoft SkyDrive application to 
sync key documents, photos, and other folders between the web and our Windows PCs. 
So installing SkyDrive (available from skydrive.com) copies the documents, photos, 
and other critical files over automatically.
Advanced Windows 8 Setup Configurations
While the preceding parts of this chapter document the most common Setup sce-
narios, sometimes you need a bit more advanced or unusual configuration. Here, 
we’ll examine some of the more common ways in which you can install Windows 8 
in such configurations.
V413HAV

52
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
Since the actual process of installing Windows 8 in each case resembles the proce-
dure detailed previously, here we’ll just focus on the specific differences of which you 
need to be aware.
Dual Boot
While most users will want just a single version of Windows installed on their PC, 
some power users or others will require two (or more) installs of Windows, which sit 
side by side on the PC’s hard disk in separate partitions. When you boot the PC in such 
a configuration, you’re presented with a menu listing the various OS choices, and you 
pick one and boot into the appropriate OS version.
Such a configuration is often called a dual-boot configuration, though of course 
it’s possible to install three or more OSes, assuming you have the disk space. (Maybe 
multi-boot is a better term.) But however many versions of Windows you wish to 
install, the basic advice is simple: Install them in order of age, from oldest to newest. 
If you want to dual-boot between Windows 7 and Windows 8, for example, install Win-
dows 7 first and then Windows 8.
Why is this, you ask? Each Windows version comes with an updated version of 
the Windows boot loader, which includes both the menu that users will see and the 
underlying code that selects which OS to boot. The Windows 7 boot loader is not 
familiar with Windows 8. But the version for Windows 8 is very much familiar with 
Windows 7, and with older Windows versions. So install that last.
Assuming you have a Windows 7 install up and running already, you must use a 
media-based Setup to install Windows 8 after booting the PC from that disc or USB 
flash drive. That is, you cannot use the web-based installer.
Getting the PC Ready for the Second OS
Before you do that, however, there is one absolutely critical task you must perform: 
You must make room for the new Windows 8 install. This can occur on its own disk, so 
if you have one sitting in the PC waiting to go, you’re all set. But if you have just one 
hard disk, as in a typical laptop, you’ll need to segregate it into separate partitions, 
segments of the disk that work and act like individual hard disks. And to do this, you 
must use a fairly complex and well-hidden tool called Disk Management.
To find this tool from Windows 7, use Start Menu Search: Open the Start Menu, type 
disk part, and hit Enter. The Disk Management utility, shown in Figure 2-21, will open.
On a single disk PC, you must select the partition on which Windows 7 is installed—
it’s almost always the C: drive—right-click it, and choose Shrink Volume. In the Shrink 

53
Advanced Windows 8 Setup Configurations
window, shown in Figure 2-22, enter the amount of space to shrink the partition in MB. 
This space will be used for the Windows 8 partition, which you’ll create next.
 
Figure 2-21: Disk Management
 
Figure 2-22: Use the Shrink tool to resize your Windows 7 partition and  
make room for Windows 8.

54
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
Then, click the Shrink button.
Back in Disk Management, you’ll see the new empty disk space you just created. 
Right-click this and choose New Simple Volume. Step through the wizard, give it all 
the available space, assign it a drive letter, and be sure to assign it an obvious name, 
like Windows 8.
Installing Windows 8 Alongside Windows 7
Now you’re ready to install Windows 8 in a dual-boot configuration. Reboot the 
computer, and boot it using the Setup media you previously acquired or created.
In Windows Setup, there are two critical points where you must choose correctly:
Install type: 
3
3
You will be prompted to choose between Upgrade and Custom 
install types. You must choose Custom here, since you are not upgrading 
Windows 7 and are instead clean installing Windows 8 alongside Windows 7.
Where do you want to install Windows?
3
3
 In the next Setup step, you will  
be asked to pick a partition or hard drive on which to install Windows 8. You 
cannot install Windows 8 to the same partition or hard drive to which Windows 7 
is installed. Instead, you must choose a different partition or hard drive. So 
choose the partition you created earlier.
Windows 8 will install normally and eventually boot into the new OS.
Choosing Between Windows 7 and Windows 8 at Boot
By default, your PC will boot into the most recently-installed OS, which in this case 
is Windows 8. But it will briefly stop at a new boot menu, which gives you the oppor-
tunity to choose the OS at boot time. This menu will resemble Figure 2-23 and will 
contain entries for both Windows 8 and Windows 7.
This menu only displays for several seconds, so you need to think quick if you 
want to change from the default boot choice. (Or simply tap an arrow key on the key-
board to stop the countdown.)
You can configure this boot menu by clicking Change defaults or choose other 
options. When you do so, you’ll be presented with the screen shown in Figure 2-24.
The following options are available:
Change the timer: 
3
3
By default, the boot menu only appears for 30 seconds 
(which, frankly, is reasonable). Here, you can change this to other time limits, 
including 5 minutes or 5 seconds.

55
Advanced Windows 8 Setup Configurations
Choose a default operating system:

By default, your PC will boot into the 
most recently installed OS if the menu timer expires. With this option, you can 
choose a different Windows version as the default.
Choose other options:
3

 This option triggers the Windows 8 recovery tools 
menu, which we discuss in Chapter 11.
 
Figure 2-23: The Windows 8 boot menu
You can also modify this boot menu a bit from within Windows 8 (but not from 
within Windows 7). Of course, you may be wondering: Why bother? Well, this other 
interface provides a bit more fine-grained control over the boot options, especially 
for the boot menu timer.
To access these capabilities, you have to find a very well-hidden Startup and 
Recovery interface that’s available via the classic System control panel from previ-
ous Windows versions. There are numerous ways to find it, but the easiest, as always, 
is Start Search: Look for system, select Settings, and then choose System from the 
results list. In the System window, click Advanced system settings on the left, then 
select the Advanced tab of System Properties. And then click the Settings button in 
the Startup and Recovery section. (Whew!)

Installing Windows 8 on a Mac
For a few years there, Mac “switchers” made inroads in the PC world, starting with the 
poorly received Windows Vista and Apple’s antagonistic “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” adver-
tisements. But then something interesting happened. Microsoft got its mojo back 
with Windows 7, releasing an OS that was both competent and efficient. And then it 
released Windows 8 and triggered renewed excitement in Windows in a way we hadn’t 
seen in, well, a couple of decades.
Of course, with thousands of Mac users out there wondering what went wrong, 
it’s no surprise that many are suddenly regretting their expensive side-trip to the 
Apple side of the computing fence. But have no fear, unhappy Mac users. Windows 8 
will work on your computer too. After all, Macs are nothing more than expensive and 
beautiful PCs.
As with previous versions of Windows, you can install the Windows 8 Consumer 
Preview on your Mac in three basic ways: virtualized, using a solution like Parallels 
Desktop or VMWare Fusion, in a dual-boot configuration using Apple’s Boot Camp 
utility, or as the sole OS, replacing Mac OS X once and for all.
Nothing would make us happier than recommending the latter approach because, 
after all, every time someone uses Mac OS X a unicorn dies. But we can’t recommend 
it for a simple and pragmatic reason: There are some things you can only do on a Mac 
using Mac OS X, including updating the device’s firmware. So you really should keep 
at least a small OS X partition available, if only for that reason.
The Mac’s various virtualization solutions are straightforward and have their 
own unique advantages, but since the goal here is to replace Mac OS X to the extent 
possible, we’ll focus on the Boot Camp approach. Besides, it’s free and comes with 
every Mac. Wasn’t Apple nice to do that?
Before getting started, make sure that OS X is up to date with all the latest soft-
ware updates and that you have a bootable Windows 8 Setup DVD; a USB flash drive-
based Setup type doesn’t work with Boot Camp. And depending on which kind of Mac 
You can also use 
3

this interface to 
enable the recovery 
options at boot time 
if you’d like. Generally 
speaking, this isn’t 
advisable, but if  
you’re having issues 
with the computer,  
it’s not a bad idea to 
have this capability  
at the ready.

58
C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
you have, you may need a 32-bit version of Windows. But modern Macs generally can 
work with the preferred 64-bit versions of Windows 8.
Installing Windows 8 with Boot Camp
You will find the Boot Camp Assistant utility in Applications, Utilities on any modern 
Mac. (Or, just use the handy keyboard shortcut Command + Space to bring up OS X’s 
version of Start Menu Search and type boot c and then press Enter.)
Boot Camp Assistant is a very simple, wizard-based application that walks you 
through the process of getting the drivers you need and partitioning your Mac to 
accommodate both OSes and then installs Windows. It’s a pretty straightforward 
process, but be sure to download Apple’s Windows Setup drivers when prompted since 
you’ll need them later. Burn them to disc (or copy them to a USB flash drive).
Boot Camp Assistant will also prompt you to choose how much disk space to allot 
to both Mac OS X and Windows, as shown in Figure 2-26. We recommend giving as 
much space to Windows as possible since, of course, you’ll be using this superior plat-
form almost exclusively going forward. But choose accordingly, understanding that 
you will not be able to easily change this configuration later.
Once that’s done, click Install and Boot Camp will trigger the Windows 8 Setup 
routine, or prompt you to insert the Setup disc so it can do so.
 
Figure 2-26: Apple actually lets you install another OS on a Mac. They’re so cute.

59
Advanced Windows 8 Setup Configurations
Setup will run normally, as described previously. There are two crucial choices 
to make during this process, however. First, choose the Custom install type at the 
appropriate screen. And then choose the right partition, of course, and not the one 
on which OS X is installed. This screen will be a bit messy, given the way Boot Camp 
laid out the disk. But the correct partition is named Bootcamp and will be roughly the 
size you previously configured. You will have to format it using the Advanced options 
before Setup can proceed.
After a few reboots, you’ll step through the out-of-box experience as is usual, and 
then sign in to Windows 8 for the first time.
Post-Install Tasks
Once Windows 8 is installed, you will need to install Apple’s Boot Camp drivers in 
order to complete the installation. So you should insert the driver disc you created 
as part of the Boot Camp Assistant and let it do its thing, rebooting as required. From 
there, follow the general post-install advice provided earlier in this chapter.
Of Mac Keyboards and Windows
One of the weirdest things about using a Mac is that Apple’s computers use non-
standard keyboards. It will take a little getting used to, but this handy guide 
(Table 2-1) to common key conversions should get you started.

cally into Windows 8 every time you restart the PC. This is almost always what you’ll 
want, but you may occasionally need to boot into OS X for some reason. You can do so on 
the fly, when the Mac boots, or configure the Mac to boot into OS X just once, the next 
time you restart. (Okay, you could also make OS X the default boot OS. But we’re not doc-
umenting that particular option since you will never, ever, ever want to do that. Got it?)
Booting into OS X Once
To boot into OS X just once, you need to access the Boot Camp control panel that was 
installed when you installed Apple’s various Boot Camp drivers. This control panel, 
shown in Figure 2-27, will be accessible from an icon in the system tray. (It’s the tiny 
gray diamond.)
 
Figure 2-27: The Boot Camp control panel
To restart in OS X just once, right-click the Boot Camp system tray icon and choose 
Restart in Mac OS X. You’ll be prompted about whether you’re sure you want to do 
this, as even Apple can’t believe it. Click OK to reboot into OS X.
Choosing Between OS X and Windows 8 at Boot Time
You can also choose between Mac OS X and Windows 8 when the Mac boots up. To do 
so, wait for the Mac’s bong sound at restart and then hold down the Alt/Option key. 

61
Summary
You’ll see a graphical boot menu appear with choices for Mac OS X, Windows, Recovery 
HD, and, if available, a bootable optical disc. Select the partition you want and enjoy.
Virtual Machine Installs
Like previous versions of Windows, it’s possible to install Windows 8 in virtual 
machine environments such as Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Work-
station, and so on. Generally speaking, there’s no real magic to making Windows 8 
work with such products, though you lose out on some graphical niceties and, usu-
ally, the touch-based goodness that makes Windows 8 special.
From an installation perspective, you will want to download a Windows 8 disc 
image in ISO format and use that to install Windows 8. You cannot use the web-based 
installer. Since these environments are well understood and utilize generic virtual-
ized hardware components, you will usually not need to hunt around for drivers after 
Setup concludes.
Windows to Go: Windows 8 on a USB Flash Drive
With Windows 8, Microsoft has finally answered a long-time request from power 
users, businesses, and educational institutions and has provided a unique new way 
to install the OS to a USB flash drive, providing users with a complete operating 
environment they can carry in their pocket. To use this special version of Windows 8, 
called Windows to Go, all you need to do is insert it in any PC, reboot, and boot from 
the USB drive. After about 20 seconds, you’ll be presented with your familiar, cus-
tomized Windows 8 environment, complete with all your apps and data. And if you 
lose the USB flash drive, no problem: The entire disk can be encrypted with BitLocker 
and protected against data theft.
Summary
With its latest operating system, Microsoft has significantly improved the process 
by which you take a new or used PC and install, upgrade, or migrate to Windows 8. 
This procedure, called Windows Setup, now comes in a streamlined new web-based 
installer that bundles useful but previously separate tools for a more complete and 
error-free experience. But you can still install Windows 8 using the old-fashioned, 
media-based installer from a bootable DVD disc or USB flash drive.
Windows 8 is

the first client 
version of Windows 
to include its own 
hypervisor-based 
virtualization solution. 
This is called Hyper-V, 
and because this 
solution is generally 
aimed at businesses,  
we discuss it in  
Chapter 14.

C h a p t e r  2    Installing and Upgrading to Windows 8
Windows 8 can also be installed in various advanced configurations, including 
dual- and multi-boot, where multiple versions of Windows sit side by side on a single 
PC. It can be installed on a Mac in a variety of ways. It can be installed in virtual 
machines, and it can be installed to a bootable, self-contained USB flash drive in a 
new configuration called Windows to Go.
However you choose to install Windows 8, you can be sure that at the end of this 
process, you’ll have a fully functioning install, complete with all of the drivers you 
need to power your PC. And this chapter showed you how to make that happen.

You don’t have to spend too much time with Windows 8 before  
it hits you: This Windows version is like nothing that’s come before. The biggest and 
most visual change, of course, is the new Metro environment, which includes the Start 
screen, various full-screen Metro-style apps, and several Metro user experiences that all 
sit on a brand-new runtime engine called WinRT. Not only does Windows 8 look different 
from its predecessors, it really is a brand-new operating system, built from scratch to 
meet the needs of today’s quickly evolving technology landscape. Yes, all your old desk-
top applications and hardware devices still work. But the underpinnings of Windows—
its soul, really—has completely changed.

64
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
This chapter dives deep into the new Metro environment and explains how it 
works and why it works the way it does. You’ll look at how to use this new UI on PCs 
of all kinds—including desktop, laptop, tablet, and hybrid devices—and how you 
can get the most out of it regardless of the hardware you’re using. You’ll also look at 
the hidden new features available to the Start screen and the new Metro-style apps 
that run on top of this environment. In Windows 8, it may seem like everything has 
changed, and in many ways it has. There are only two ways to face change as dra-
matic as this: fear or excitement. We choose the latter. And if you get through this 
chapter with us, you will, too.
So, It’s Called Metro, Right?
One of the tough decisions we had with this book concerned naming conven-
tions. See, we think names are important. They provide a simple and obvious 
way to refer to the things we’re describing throughout the book. It’s nice to be 
able to point out a new on-screen gadget and tell you, hey, look, that’s the new 
thingamawhatsis or whatever.
Unfortunately, there’s a new trend at Microsoft where the (we assume) well-
intentioned designers behind all the fun new interfaces in Windows 8 not only 
don’t want to name things, but seem actively engaged in rewriting history by ret-
roactively simplifying the names of objects that appeared in previous Windows 
versions. So the Start Menu is now simply called Start. That way, when we move 
forward to Windows 8, Microsoft can claim that Start—or, more pretentiously, 
the Start experience—works like before but is now a full-screen experience and 
not a menu. Even though in reality, they’re completely different.
So it is with the Metro environment. Microsoft does not refer to the Metro environ-
ment as anything in particular; they just claim that it’s Windows, generically, as if 
wanting or needing to call out these completely new and different user experienc-
es was a ludicrous notion. Indeed, right after it completed Windows 8, Microsoft 
decreed that it would not use the term Metro to describe these new experiences, 
ostensibly for legal reasons.
We’re not buying into this. In the interests of clarity, we’re naming things.  
And in those places where Microsoft refuses to name names, we’re giving them 
names. And sometimes we’re deviating from the way Microsoft does things. But 
to be clear, we’re doing this for you, to make things obvious and simpler, and to 
prevent clever or lengthy turns of word that would annoy all of us.

65
Times They Are A-Changin’: The New Windows Shell
For example, Microsoft has gotten the app bug. Everything to them is an app 
these days. And that includes new Metro-style apps—those apps that run in the 
new environment described in this chapter—as well as old-school, Windows 
desktop-based applications. Folks, desktop applications are not apps. They’re 
applications. And we differentiate them from Metro-style apps—because they 
are very different—by giving them a different name. So when we use the term 
app, we’re referring only to Metro-style apps. When we use the term application, 
we’re referring only to desktop-based applications.
Ditto for Metro. Microsoft refuses to name this environment, or even use the 
term Metro, but we’re not so shy. There are two main user experiences in 
Windows 8, and while one is the desktop environment we all know and love 
from previous Windows versions, the other is. . .Metro. At least that’s what 
we’re calling it.
Sometimes, of course, Microsoft does get it right. In Windows 7, for example, there 
was a feature called Start Menu Search, which we liked quite a bit. In Windows 8, 
this has been replaced by something we’d be inclined to call Start Screen Search, 
which will make a lot more sense once you see it in action. But Microsoft’s name 
for this feature, which it has retroactively applied to the Windows 7 feature as well, 
is Start Search. And you know what? That works just fine, since it’s clear and obvi-
ous, and simpler. Ultimately, we’re just trying to be pragmatic here.
Times They Are A-Changin’: 
The New Windows Shell
In previous versions of Windows, you would boot the PC (or wake it from Sleep mode), 
provide your login credentials when prompted (after bypassing the lock screen if 
using a corporate-connected domain account), and then be presented with the Win-
dows desktop. The desktop was only part of a wider series of applications and services 
known as the Windows shell. And in all of the versions of Windows released over the 
past 15 years or more, this shell was called Windows Explorer, or simply Explorer.
In Windows 8, this entire sequence of events is generally unchanged. But the 
specifics are all new, creating what is in effect an entirely new experience.
Now, your PC’s boot process is measured in just a handful of seconds—under 20, 
certainly, and well under 10 for most SSD-based systems—and waking from sleep is 

66
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
near simultaneous. The lock screen is always present by default, whether you’re using 
your own PC or one from work. When you sign in—Microsoft no longer uses the terms log 
in or log out—you’re presented with the new Metro-style Start screen, not the desktop. 
And the Metro environment in which the Start screen and new Metro-style apps run is 
the new shell. In Figure 3-1, you can see a selection of full-screen Metro experiences, 
including the new Start screen, PC Settings, and a representative Metro-style app.
 
Figure 3-1: It’s not your father’s Windows.
Oddly enough, however, the familiar desktop and Explorer interfaces are still pres-
ent in Windows 8, though in keeping with the “everything is new again” approach in 
this release, even Windows Explorer has been renamed, to File Explorer. This lets you 
switch back and forth between the new shell, along with its apps and experiences, and 
the old shell, with its own applications. You can even run both environments, Metro 
and the desktop, side by side in very limited ways, as you’ll see later in this chapter.
Regardless of which version of Windows you’re talking about, the shell is both the 
look and feel of this OS—the user interface or experience—and the part of Windows 
that controls how things look and work. It is responsible for the controls—buttons, 
windows, tabs, and so on—that make up the environment as well as their behaviors.
Replacing the Windows shell is a big step, and this fact alone should signal  
that Windows 8 is a major release of the operating system since, after all, the last  
time Microsoft swapped out the shell was in 1995. But we’re making the case that  
Windows 8 represents the biggest change to Windows in the history of the product line. 
And that’s because Microsoft is not only swapping out the shell, but it’s also swapping 
In Windows 3.x,

Program Manager 
was the shell. And 
in Windows 95, 
you could still run 
Program Manager 
as an application 
if you wanted 
to. So Microsoft 
making the new 
and old available 
simultaneously is  
not unprecedented.

67
Lock Screen: A New Way to Sign In
out the underpinnings of Windows, or the runtime engine, as well as the APIs that 
developers use to write Windows apps. And this is the first time in history that the  
company has ever done all of that in a single release.
The new runtime engine is called, logically enough, Windows Runtime, or WinRT. 
This engine provides the system’s platform for applications (or, in this case, “apps”), 
and it mostly replaces Win32, which was (and still is) the basis for desktop-based 
applications. (Under the hood, WinRT does access some Win32 functionality that’s 
still missing in WinRT.) Win32 debuted in Windows NT in 1993. (And even that was just 
a 32-bit conversion of the then-current Windows runtime, which was retroactively 
renamed to Win16.)
But you don’t need a history lesson to know that Windows 8 is different. It hits you 
right in the face the first time you use it, and as you can see in its new lock screen, the 
Start screen and its apps, and the pervasive Metro-style user experiences, there’s a lot 
that’s new here. And that’s what this chapter is all about.
Lock Screen: A New Way to Sign In
When you boot the computer or wake it up from Sleep, you’ll be presented with the new 
lock screen, a full-screen Metro-style experience that is basically new to Windows 8 and 
visually sits on top of the sign-in screen where you select a user account and optionally 
provide a password.
As you can see in Figure 3-2, the lock screen looks and works much as it does on a 
smartphone OS like Windows Phone. It provides a nice photographic background image, 
the time and date, and a number of status notifications, most of which are icons.
 
Figure 3-2: The Windows 8 lock screen

68
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Virtually every aspect of this lock screen can be customized, and it provides 
what Microsoft calls a “glance and go” interface where you can glance at the screen 
even when the system is locked—indicated by the presence of the lock screen—and 
see information that is useful, such as the date and time and your next upcoming 
appointment.
C ROSSREF  ​We describe customizing the lock screen in Chapter 5.
To bypass the lock screen, tap any key (such as Enter), or click the mouse. Or, on a 
touch-based system, swipe up from the bottom of the screen as you do with Windows 
Phone. When you do, you’ll be presented with the sign-in screen similar to the one 
shown in Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3: The Windows 8 sign-in screen
This screen will vary somewhat based on how many user accounts you’ve config-
ured on the PC, but the first time you use Windows 8, you’ll just see the one account 
you configured during Setup.
To sign in to Windows, enter your password and tap Enter. If you’re using a touch-
based system, you can do so using the on-screen keyboard, as shown in Figure 3-4.
You can also choose accessibility options from the Ease of Access button in the 
lower-left of the screen, or Sleep, Shut down, or Restart the PC using the button in 
the lower right of the screen. If you don’t do anything, the lock screen will reappear 
after a short period of time.

W ARN ING ​ ​If you have not configured your user account with a password, and 
have only the one account configured on the PC, you will bypass the sign-in screen 
and proceed directly to the Start screen, as described in the next section. Don’t 
do this. We strongly recommend configuring all user accounts with passwords for 
what we assume are obvious security reasons.
You can lock the PC at any time by typing Winkey + L. Note that this keyboard 
shortcut will lock the screen without any confirmation request. It’s immediate.
Start Screen: A New User Experience 
for Modern Apps
In Windows 7 and previous Windows versions, applications were said to run “on” or 
“within” the Windows desktop since that is how they visually appeared, and because 
the desktop provided different user interfaces for managing and launching applica-
tions and performing other system-level tasks.
In Windows 8, these activities are performed from the new Start screen. As 
you can see in Figure 3-5, this screen is decidedly different from the old Windows 
desktop.

70
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
 
Figure 3-5: The Start screen
Understanding the Design of Metro
The Start screen is what’s called a Metro-style user experience. That is, it employs the 
techniques of a new “design language” at Microsoft that is guiding the look and feel 
of many of the software giant’s core platforms, including Windows, Windows Server, 
Windows Phone, Xbox, and Office. And while we don’t want to get too bogged down in 
designer talk, it’s worth noting a few general tenets of these interfaces, since they’re 
so pervasive in Windows 8.
Typography and white space: 
3
3
Metro-based user experiences feature beauti-
ful typography, often surrounded by lots of white space. This is a very different 
approach than with typical technology interfaces, which tend to overwhelm 
users with obscure rows or grids of icons, buttons, and other on-screen elements.
Consider the Start screen as a typical example. The Start logo and user tile 
(in the upper-right corner) are offset deliberately from the live tiles below by 
a wide swath of white space. Those tiles don’t butt up to the left edge of the 
screen, but rather sit to the right. But the tiles also appear to disappear off the 
right edge of the screen, suggesting that you can scroll in that direction to 
see more. There’s no awful looking chevron graphic or whatever to spell it out 
for you. Instead, the design is confident and beautiful, and something that 
would be fun to touch.

71
Start Screen: A New User Experience for Modern Apps
Animation and motion: 
3
3
Interfaces come to life with animation and other 
motion, and in Metro these motions aren’t just fun to look at, they’re useful. 
Animation can also give the appearance of performance, though to be fair, 
Windows 8 performs so well it’s almost redundant.
It’s not possible to show you how animations and motion improve the Windows 
8 user experience, but suffice to say these elements are everywhere, from the 
live tiles that animate between various status updates, to the animation that 
occurs each time you launch a Metro-style app, and to the floating notification 
“toasts” that slide on-screen rather than jar you by appearing suddenly and 
without warning.
Minimal user interface chrome: 
3
3
Until recently, most computer software was 
designed by the engineers who wrote the code. And let’s face it, these guys 
don’t get good design. They were responsible for such UI extremes as the dia-
log with multiple rows of tabs and the Office applications so loaded up with 
toolbars you couldn’t even see the document you were supposed to be editing.
With Metro, it’s the content that’s emphasized, not the surrounding applica-
tion user interface, or chrome. In fact, with most Metro-style designs, there 
is little to no chrome at all. Instead, Metro provides full-screen experiences 
that use every available pixel to display the app or experience. Accessory 
interfaces that used to be on-screen all the time, like an app bar—Metro’s all-
in-one replacement for the toolbar and menu—are now hidden by default and 
displayed only when needed.
For example, in Figure 3-6, you can see the Start screen’s app bar, which is not 
normally shown since its few options are rarely needed.
 
Figure 3-6: The Start screen’s app bar

72
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Honesty of design: 
3
3
While some systems treat their users like idiots, Metro 
design specifies that user interfaces should be “authentically digital” and true 
to the system on which they run. That is, your $1,000 Ultrabook isn’t a paper-
based calendar. Why should a calendar app be designed to resemble one? After 
all, most users today have never even used such a calendar, so that design is 
at best nostalgic and at worst inefficient. Instead, Metro designs are designed 
explicitly for the device form factor: a high-resolution, high-performance 
screen that could employ multi-touch interactions. On such a device, a cal-
endar could look very different from that old-fashioned paper calendar that 
some companies seem to like so much.
You can see this type of design throughout Metro, but the best example,  
perhaps, is in the various opaque icons that appear throughout, in such 
places as the live tiles on the Start screen and the buttons on various app 
bars. Instead of being photorealistic representations of a store (Windows 
Store), a pair of headphones (the Xbox Music app), or a video game controller 
(Xbox LIVE Games app), these icons are authentic to the digital nature of the 
device itself. In fact, they’re designed to be as obvious as possible, and are 
modeled on the signage one sees in public transportation hubs throughout 
the world.
Using the Start Screen
The Start screen provides just a few basic functions: It’s a place to organize live tiles 
that represent the apps you care about the most, so you can launch those apps and, 
while viewing the Start screen, see live updates that are rendered on their surfaces.
This functionality alone makes the Start screen far more useful than the Windows 
desktop. With that interface, applications had very limited ways in which to provide 
you with any kind of status information. An e‑mail application, for example, might 
provide a small number badge on its icon, indicating how many unread e‑mails it 
contained. But this badge could be seen only when you pinned the application to the 
taskbar, as in Figure 3-7.
Application developers tried to overcome this lack of capability through several 
means. Many wrote customized notification schemes that could alert users when some-
thing important happened, but the sheer number of variety of these notifications was 
often more annoying and distracting than useful. And Microsoft even briefly pushed 
a new type of utility, called the Windows Gadget, which would sit on the desktop and 
update the user from time to time. Gadgets failed for all kinds of reasons: Full-screen 
And yes, this

is where Metro 
gets its name. It’s 
based on the simple 
graphics found in 
the transportation 
hubs that people 
use every day.

73
Start Screen: A New User Experience for Modern Apps
applications would cover them up, they were disconnected from full-fledged Windows 
applications, and they were written with completely different technologies.
 
Figure 3-7: In Windows 7, an e‑mail application could provide you  
with an unread e‑mail count through its taskbar button’s icon.
In Windows 8, each app (and many desktop-based interfaces) can expose a single 
live tile on the Start screen. This live tile is more expressive and useful than any icon 
and can provide all kinds of information in real time. By arranging the tiles for apps you 
use most often, you can create a live dashboard of sorts where your e‑mail, calendar, 
social networking, weather, and other apps are all providing you with ongoing live 
updates over time. And you can see these updates without ever entering the app in 
question. Glance and go, as Microsoft says.
To use the previous e‑mail example again, Windows 8 includes an app called Mail. 
And unlike its desktop-based predecessor, it not only tells you how many unread 
e‑mails you have, but it also cycles through previews of each of those e‑mails. In  
Figure 3-8, you can see two of the different types of displays it animates between.
Not all live tiles are expressive. Some don’t 
have to be, like the tile for a game or web browser. 
You can configure tiles to be one of two sizes—
Bigger and Smaller, with the former being rect-
angles and the latter being smaller squares.
Consider Figure 3-9, where you can see 
a grid of live tiles, some big and some small. 
Here, the Internet Explorer, Windows Store, 
Bing Maps, and SkyDrive Explorer tiles are all 
configured to be smaller and don’t provide any 
rich, animated information. But the Calendar, 
Photos, Weather, and Bing Finance live tiles  
are larger and provide dynamic information  
about their contents.
In the smaller 
3
3
size, a normally 
expressive live tile  
is effectively 
rendered mute.
Figure 3-8: The Mail app cycles 
through previews of your most recent 
e‑mails; here are two examples from 
the same tile.

74
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
 
Figure 3-9: A mix of small and large live tile sizes
The Start screen can be configured in various ways so you can tailor the system 
as you prefer. For example, you can organize the tiles visually into various groups, 
and can add and remove tiles for the apps (and Windows desktop applications and 
websites) you use most frequently.
C ROSSREF  ​We explain how to customize the Start screen in Chapter 5.
Launching Apps
To launch an app, you simply tap its live tile from the Windows 8 Start screen. 
(Mouse users can of course click the tile.) When you do so, you’ll see a quick-loading 
animation as the app runs and fills the screen. This is typical for Metro-style apps, 
which typically run full screen all the time.
To return to the desktop, you can tap the Windows key on your keyboard or tap 
the Windows key button on your Windows device. (There’s also a software-based 
approach related to the so-called edge UIs, which we’ll discuss in just a moment.)
Note that the Windows key (or Windows key button) works like a toggle in  
Windows 8, another big change from previous versions. In Windows 7, for example, 
if you tapped the Windows key repeatedly, the Start menu would simply open 
Typically, but 
3
3
not always. As 
you’ll see later 
in the chapter, 
it’s possible to 
“snap” two Metro-
style apps, or one 
Metro-style app 
and the desktop 
side by side, using 
a new form of 
multitasking that’s 
really just screen 
sharing.

75
Start Screen: A New User Experience for Modern Apps
and close repeatedly. But in Windows 8, tapping this key repeatedly will toggle 
between the current Metro-style app and the Start screen.
Windows 8 ships with a large number of apps and you can find even more in  
Windows Store, Microsoft’s new app store.
C ROSSREF  ​We discuss the various built-in Windows 8 Metro-style apps 
throughout this book, of course, but you can find out more about Windows 
Store in Chapter 6.
Accessing the Windows Desktop
In Windows 8, the desktop environment is treated like an app, and you should find a 
Desktop tile somewhere on the Start screen. (If you don’t, you can use Start Search, 
described in the next section, to find it.) When you tap the Desktop tile, the familiar 
desktop interface appears, as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
Figure 3-10: The Windows desktop lives.
The Windows desktop looks and works much like the desktop in Windows 7, but 
with a few differences. The biggest is that the Start button and Start menu are missing: 
Windows 8 has replaced the old Start menu with the new, full-screen Start screen, so 
the Start button is gone. You will typically use the Windows key, Windows key button, 
or the other methods described later in this chapter, to access the Start screen.

76
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Other than that, things work as before. You can run traditional Windows applica-
tions, in windowed or full-screen mode, install new applications, and so on. Chances 
are if it worked in Windows 7, it will work fine in Windows 8 as well.
Also, the Start toggle mentioned earlier works with the Windows desktop as well: 
Tapping the Windows key (or Windows key button) repeatedly will toggle the display 
between the desktop and the Start screen.
C ROSSREF  ​The desktop is important enough that it gets its own chapter. 
Check out Chapter 4 for more information.
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
While the Start screen, Metro-style apps, and the Windows desktop are all full-screen 
experiences that you generally access in isolation, Windows 8 also offers a variety 
of other Metro user experiences that you can access from elsewhere. In many cases, 
these experiences are new system-level interfaces, and most are available from the 
Windows desktop as well as from the Start screen or Metro-style apps.
Before digging into individual interfaces, it’s helpful to know that Windows 8 
exposes many of these user interfaces in different ways depending on whether you’re 
using the keyboard, mouse, or your fingers on a multi-touch screen. And yes, in most 
cases, all three input types are available.
Keyboard shortcuts: 
3
3
For keyboard users, Microsoft has delivered a startling 
number of keyboard shortcuts in Windows 8, many of which utilize the now-
common Windows key (or Winkey). For example, Winkey + D will display the 
Windows desktop, while Winkey + E will open a new Windows Explorer window. 
Keyboard shortcuts are such a big deal in this release, in fact, that we supply an 
amazing list of such shortcuts in the appendix. But we also discuss each appli-
cable shortcut as needed throughout the book.
Hot corners:
3
3
 For mouse users, Microsoft utilizes the corners of the screen, 
providing what it calls hot corners that activate different features. These 
features include Back, Switcher, Start, and Charms, and they’re discussed 
individually in just a moment.
Edge UIs: 
3
3
Touch users can utilize various edge UIs to achieve the same 
actions for which mouse users use hot corners. For example, if you swipe 
down from the upper edge of the screen (or up from the bottom edge), you

will activate the current app’s (or other Metro experience’s) app bar. You can 
perform simple task switching via the left edge of the screen and access the 
Charms bar from the right edge; these interfaces are all described later in 
this chapter as well.
Okay, let’s look at the various system-level Metro experiences in Windows 8.
Charms: The Uber-Metro UI
If you learn just one Metro-based user experience, it should be how to access the 
Charms bar, a menu of useful system-level options that is perhaps the key to master-
ing Windows 8. This is shown in Figure 3-11.
 
Figure 3-11: Charms
Before explaining Charms further, however, let’s discuss how to invoke them. 
Each of these access types works from anywhere in Windows 8, including the Start 
screen, any Metro-style app or game, or from the Windows desktop.
Keyboard: 
3
3
Type Winkey + C.
Mouse:
3
3
 Move the mouse cursor into the top-right corner of the screen. As you 
do, the Charms bar will appear in a translucent mode. Then, move the cursor 
down toward the middle of the right edge of the screen to fully engage the bar. 
(Conversely, you can mouse into the lower-right corner of the screen and then 
move the mouse cursor up toward the middle of the right edge of the screen.)
Accessing the 
3
3
Charms bar on 
a multiscreen 
configuration 
can be tricky, 
depending on 
the location and 
orientation of your 
secondary screens. 
Though some 
workarounds exist, 
the simplest is to 
use the Winkey + C 
keyboard shortcut 
instead of the 
mouse.

78
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
NO TE ​ ​Why the translucency? Microsoft is accounting for other user interface 
elements that might be bumped up against the right edge of the screen, including 
a desktop application’s scroll bar or the Peek button in the taskbar. If you don’t 
immediately move the mouse cursor toward the middle, the Charm bar will dis-
appear, allowing you to access whatever else is on-screen in that area.
Touch: 
3
3
To display the Charms on a multi-touch screen, swipe in to the left 
from the right edge of the screen.
As you can see, there are five items, or “charms”, in the Charms bar. They are  
as follows:
Search: 
3
3
This charm provides easy access to the system-wide search function-
ality in Windows 8. It’s context-sensitive, so if you tap it from the Start screen 
or Windows desktop, it will trigger the new Start Search experience, which 
lets you find apps (and applications), settings, and files on your PC. But if you 
access this charm from within an app, you will instead search that app. For 
example, you can use this to search for e‑mail from within the Mail app.
We discuss Search in the next section of this chapter.
Share:
3
3
 Via this unique charm, you can share what’s on-screen with others 
using another Metro-style app. Like many of the other charms, including 
Search, this functionality is tied to a new, low-level capability in Windows 8 
called contracts, in this case the Share contract. And any Metro-style app can 
implement this contract to send and/or receive share requests.
Share doesn’t work at all from the Start screen (or the desktop) since these 
interfaces have nothing to share. To use Share, you need to be using a 
Metro-style app first.
We discuss Share in more detail a bit later in the chapter.
Start: 
3
3
This charm, which is color-coded to the accent color in the Metro theme 
you chose, simply emulates the Windows key or Windows key button. That is, 
it will navigate to the Start screen from any other Metro-based experience or 
the desktop. But if you’re already on the Start screen, you’ll return to the pre-
vious experience you were using.
Devices: 
3
3
Like most charms, Devices is also context-sensitive, so what you see 
here will be determined by two things: which compatible devices are attached 
to (or included in) your PC or device and what you’re doing at the time. The 
Device charm is most often used to access a printer or, for those with two or 
more screens, to determine how the secondary screens are used.

79
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
We discuss the Devices charm, and Windows 8’s support for hardware periph-
erals, later in the chapter.
Settings:
3
3
 Another context-sensitive charm, Settings provides an interest-
ing array of features. At the top of the Settings pane that appears, shown in 
Figure 3-12, you’ll see links to settings that pertain to the current view, which 
could be the Start screen, a Metro-style app, or the desktop environment. But 
at the bottom, you will find links to settings that are always available, from 
any of those experiences.
 
Figure 3-12: Settings pane
From the Start screen, you’ll see a Tile settings link that provides a short list 
of settings for the Start screen. These include whether to show administrative 
tools on the Start screen and a button for clearing personal information from 
the tiles.
From within an app, you’ll see different settings depending on the app. For 
this reason, we examine app settings in the respective chapters throughout 
this book.
The grid of settings icons you see at the bottom of the Settings pane is perhaps 
the most interesting bit here.
The Network icon provides access to your PC’s networking connections,  
discussed in Chapter 13.
The Volume icon provides a way to change the system volume using a slider 
that appears when the icon is clicked, as in Figure 3-13.
Keyboard users 
3

can more quickly 
open the Settings 
pane by tapping 
Winkey + I.
You can also 
3
3
change the volume 
using hardware 
keys, either 
on your device 
(volume buttons 
are common on 
modern tablets, for 
example) or via your 
keyboard, where 
some PC makers are 
reassigning function 
keys to control the 
volume.

C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
 
Figure 3-13: Adjusting the volume
The screen brightness icon similarly provides a way to control the brightness 
of the screen on compatible devices. (Generally, it will be available on portable 
machines but not on desktop computers.)
Notifications lets you determine whether notifications, described a bit later 
in the chapter, are globally on or disabled (“hidden”) for some period of time 
so you can get work completed without interruption.
Power toggles between the power states Sleep, Shutdown, and Restart, mean-
ing that it’s a fairly important control (see Figure 3-14). You may recall that you 
would perform these operations in Windows 7 from the Start menu. But with the 
Start button and menu missing in Windows 8, Microsoft opted to put this func-
tionality in a location that would be accessible from anywhere in the system, 
whether you were using the Start screen, a Metro-style app, or the desktop.  
So here it is.
 
Figure 3-14: Power options

81
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
The keyboard icon lets you switch between the different keyboard language 
layouts your PC or device supports. For most, this will be just one, such as US 
English, but Windows 8 is the first version of Microsoft’s flagship OS in which 
every single product edition—Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro, Windows 8 Enter-
prise, and Windows RT—supports switching languages on the fly using Lan-
guage Packs. So now everyone can get their multilingual game on.
Finally, take note of the More PC Settings link at the bottom of the Settings pane. 
PC Settings is the Metro-style replacement for the Control Panel—though to be 
fair, you’ll still be accessing various control panels, too, as you’ll see throughout 
this book—and as such, it’s pretty darned important. We look at PC Settings in 
depth in Chapter 5.
Finding What You Need with Start Search
Start Menu Search was one of the best features in Windows 7, and its successor, simply 
called Start Search, is even better in Windows 8, or at least it will be once you get used 
to the new full-screen interface. If you weren’t familiar with Start Menu Search, it 
worked like this: You would tap the Start button (or hit Winkey on your keyboard) and 
just start typing the name of the application, document, or control panel you needed 
to find. As you typed, the search results would appear, inline within the Start Menu. 
This can be seen in Figure 3-15.
 
Figure 3-15: Windows 7’s Start Menu Search

82
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Of course, Windows 8 doesn’t have a Start menu. But it does still offer search-
ing capabilities. And it works exactly the same way: From any Metro-style app or 
the Windows desktop, just tap Start (or Winkey) and start typing. If you’re already 
viewing the Start screen, it’s even easier: Just start typing.
When you do, the new full-screen Search experience appears as shown in Fig-
ure 3-16. And while it may look a bit balky at first, it’s actually really powerful: It can 
help you find new Metro-style apps, Windows desktop applications, various PC Set-
tings or desktop-type control panels, and files. And as you’ll see, it can even search 
within (Metro-style) apps! It really puts Windows 7 Start Menu Search to shame.
 
Figure 3-16: Windows 8’s new Start Search
By default, Start Search will provide search results for Apps, which is really a 
combination of new, Metro-style apps and old-school, desktop-type applications. 
As you can see in Figure 3-17, telling the difference between the two is a bit subtle, 
but Metro-style apps typically have solid-colored, square, tile-like icons while older, 
desktop-type applications have the more familiar, old-school icons.
You can perform a variety of actions on the icons in the search results. For example, 
to launch the application or app, simply click or tap it. But you can perform many more 
actions if you right-click one of the items in the search results list: When you do, a new 
app bar will appear providing the additional options, as in Figure 3-18.
What you see here will vary according to the type of item you select. But some of 
the more common options include the following:
Pin/Unpin from Start:
3
3
 This option lets you pin a tile for the application or 
app to the Start screen. If it’s already pinned, you can unpin it.
To perform  
3
3
a right-click with a 
touch-based screen, 
tap the item and 
drag down a bit.

83
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
 
Figure 3-17: Applications and Metro-style apps mixed in the  
search results
Pin/Unpin from taskbar: 
3
3
This option lets you pin a desktop-type application 
to the taskbar on the desktop (or reverse that effect for an item that is already 
pinned there).
Open new window: 
3
3
This option is applicable to Windows Explorer and it lets 
you open a new Explorer window. (The same as typing Winkey + E.)
Open file location: 
3
3
This option is available only to desktop-type applications 
and it opens a new Explorer window in the location in which the application 
can be found.
Run as administrator
3
3
: This option, which is also only available to desktop-
type applications, lets you run the application within an elevated security 
context. (You’ll be prompted with a User Account Control dialog to authenti-
cate or confirm this option.)
Uninstall: 
3
3
This option lets you uninstall the app. Note that it works only for 
Metro-style apps; you uninstall classic Windows desktop applications as you 
did before (using the Programs and Features control panel).
Why is this 
3
3
called “Run as 
administrator” 
when most 
Windows 8 
users will most 
certainly be using 
an administrator 
account anyway? 
It’s just an 
unfortunate artifact 
from the past.  
What it really  
means is, “Run  
under an elevated 
security context.”

84
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
 
Figure 3-18: The Search results app bar provides more options.
Of course, Start Search isn’t just for applications. You can also filter the view for 
settings (a combination of PC Settings and control panels), files, and individual apps.
To filter the search results for settings, type your search and then tap the Settings 
item in the search pane on the right. As you can see in Figure 3-19, the search results 
will filter to show only the relevant PC Settings and control panels.
 
Figure 3-19: Search results showing settings

85
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
This interface is a bit different from the search results list for apps: The PC Settings 
choices appear first and are segregated from the control panels. And there are no right-
click options to be had. You can only tap the item you wish to access. PC Settings items 
will launch the appropriate screen in Windows 8’s new PC Settings interface (which is 
described in a moment), while control panels will open in a window over the Windows 
desktop as in previous Windows versions.
To filter the search results for files, type your search and then tap the Files item 
in the search pane. As Figure 3-20 shows, this reveals yet another take on the search 
results view, where the files on your PC that match the search term can be further  
filtered by documents, pictures, music, videos, or others.
 
Figure 3-20: Search results showing files
You can also redirect this search type across your homegroup, meaning that the 
files on other PCs on your home network will be included in the search results, too. To 
do so, tap the Files header and select Homegroup from the short menu that appears.
As with settings search results, there are no additional (right-click) options for 
files search results.
The ability to search within Metro-style apps is of course app-specific, and thus 
something we’ll discuss as appropriate throughout this book. But it’s worth noting 
that this feature is a key advantage of the new underlying software platform in Win-
dows 8: As with many other key Metro features, apps can utilize this useful capability 
fairly easy and thus extend the way that Windows 8 works.

86
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Sharing Between Apps
Windows 8 supports a new low-level feature called Contracts that works much like 
Copy and Paste does in that the applications (or, in this case, apps) on either end of 
the sequence—those that are participating in the contract—don’t need to know any-
thing about the other. That is, they only need to support the appropriate contract. 
One of the most common is the Share contract, which lets one app share information 
with another.
A contract, of course, is a two-way street, with one app initiating the operation, 
or “sending” the share request, and the other completing the operation by “accept-
ing” it. So while you are able to share information between many Metro-style apps 
using the Share contract, most will only support one end of the contract. That is, they 
will send, or they will receive.
The canonical example of such a transaction is the web: You’re browsing around your 
favorite website one morning and come across an article that you simply must share with 
someone else. In the days before Windows 8 and Metro, this kind of sharing would have 
occurred in two fairly limited ways. Either the browser would have been specifically 
designed (or “hard-coded”) to facilitate the sharing of web pages (perhaps via e‑mail or 
a social networking service like Facebook) or a third-party developer would have written 
a browser add-on, or extension, to add that capability to the browser.
Either would work. But both solutions are specific to that one browser. If you 
decide to use a different web browser, you’re out of luck. And if you want to share via 
a service or other mechanism that’s not supported by the browser you use—perhaps 
one that’s not been invented yet—you’re equally out of luck.
In Windows 8, Metro-style apps simply need to support the Share charm. They can 
support initiating a share action, and they can separately (or only) support receiving a 
share action. The Metro-style version of Internet Explorer 10, Microsoft’s web browser, 
supports initiating a share action, so you can share web pages with others. But it 
doesn’t need to know which app you’re using to share that page. And that’s because 
any number of apps support receiving the share. One that’s included in Windows 8 is 
the Mail app: You can use this app to share a page from IE 10 via e‑mail, as shown in 
Figure 3-21. But as time goes on, many other apps will appear that will let you share 
web pages via other means, such as with different social networks.
This capability means that Windows 8 will get better over time without Microsoft 
needing to update the OS itself. Third-party developers will extend the system’s abili-
ties by implementing the Share contract, and by doing so will make Windows 8, and 
many other apps that run within it, better than they were before.

Managing Running Apps
Anyone who’s used Windows knows about the Alt + Tab keyboard shortcut that lets 
you quickly switch between running applications. It’s still there in Windows 8, and 
it’s still called Windows Flip, though we suspect few knew that.
What’s different is that Windows Flip now includes Metro-style apps as well as 
desktop applications and the Windows desktop, as you can see in Figure 3-22. And 
Windows Flip is no longer the primary way to switch between running applications 
and apps.
 
Figure 3-22: Windows Flip is still in Windows 8 and works with both apps and  
applications.
Oddly, you can’t 
3
3
access the Start 
screen itself with 
Windows Flip.

88
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
Instead, Windows 8 employs new Metro-style UIs for switching between running 
apps, applications, the desktop and the Start screen. These include a new touch-based 
interface for quickly swiping between views, plus the new features Back, Switcher, 
and the Start notification tip. And as you should expect, they’re each available from 
anywhere in the system, including the Start screen, any Metro-style app, and the 
desktop. So let’s look at each in turn.
Switching Apps by Swiping
You can very easily switch between running apps, and the Windows desktop, using 
a new swipe gesture for multi-touch-based devices. To do so, swipe in from the left-
most edge of the screen. As you do, a large thumbnail of the next app in the “app 
stack”—the list of running apps—will appear, as in Figure 3-23.
 
Figure 3-23: Switching to the next app with a touch-based swipe gesture.
There are a number of things you can do with this gesture:
Switch to the next app: 
3
3
A single swipe will cause the next app to appear, 
replacing the app you were using as the only app on-screen.

89
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
Switch repeatedly through available apps: 
3
3
If you perform the aforementioned 
gesture repeatedly, you will quickly switch from app to app, navigating through 
each app in the app stack in turn. You will typically do this when the next app 
isn’t the app you’re looking for.
Snap the next app: 
3
3
Windows 8 supports a unique side-by-side screen-sharing 
mode called Snap. It can be engaged using this swipe gesture, but is impor-
tant enough that we describe it separately later in the chapter.
Enable Switcher: 
3
3
Windows 8 also includes a new app-switching interface 
called Switcher. This, too, can be enabled via this swipe gesture, and we 
describe it in just a bit.
Back
The new Back experience is a toggle and it works much like quickly tapping Alt + 
Tab once: When you use it, you will return to the previous Metro-style app or to the 
Windows desktop. To access the Back experience, move the mouse cursor into the 
top-left corner of the screen. As you hit the corner, you’ll see a Back tip appear, as in 
Figure 3-24, representing the previous app (or desktop) you used. To access that app, 
just click the tip.
 
Figure 3-24: The new Back experience lets you switch to the  
previously used app easily.
Switcher
Back works well if you’re using a small number of apps. But if you’re a heavy multi-
tasker, you’re going to want and expect a way to more easily access a particular app. 
For those 
3
3
readers lucky 
enough to own a 
multi-touch-based 
device, you can use 
the swipe-based app 
switching gesture 
described a bit later 
instead. There’s no 
way to display the  
Back tip via touch.

90
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
So Windows 8 has a new interface called Switcher that provides Windows Flip-like 
functionality in a Metro-style interface. Shown in Figure 3-25, Switcher can be 
enabled by typing Winkey + Tab.
 
Figure 3-25: Switcher provides a Metro-style list of your running apps.
Mouse and touch users can also utilize Switcher, though with a bit more 
difficulty.
With a mouse, the simplest way is to first trigger the Back tip by moving the mouse 
into the top-left corner of the screen. When you do, you may notice that there are in fact 
a number of ghost-like tile previews that run down the left edge of the screen, indicat-
ing that there are more running apps. To display Switcher, then, move the mouse down 
the left edge of the screen. As you do, the full Switcher interface will appear.
(If you’re familiar with Charms, you may understand that this behavior mimics 
how that interface is activated with a mouse. Likewise, you can alternatively mouse 
into the lower-left corner of the screen and then move the mouse cursor up the left 
edge of the screen if that’s more natural.)
While most touch interactions are by definition simple, enabling Switcher with 
touch is actually pretty difficult. It goes like this: You swipe in from the left edge of 
the screen, but a bit more slowly than normal. When the large thumbnail for the next 
app appears, you stop swiping to the right and move your finger instead backward a 
bit, to the left. If you do it just right, Switcher will appear.

Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
Start Notification Tip
While many will mourn the loss of the Start button from Windows 8, Microsoft 
removed it for a good reason: As a desktop-based interface, it was only available in 
that environment and not in any Metro-style apps. So the company came up with a 
decent replacement, called the Start notification tip, that works from anywhere in 
the system—the Start screen, the desktop, or any Metro-style app—and works exactly 
like the Windows key (or Windows key button on devices); that is, it’s a toggle.
To see the Start notification tip, move the mouse into the lower-left corner of the 
screen. As you do, a thumbnail will appear, representing either the Start screen or 
the previous screen (a Metro-style app or the desktop). This is shown in Figure 3-26.
To navigate to the Start screen  
(or to the previous experience), just 
click it.
The Start notification tip isn’t 
available with a keyboard or touch 
because it’s not necessary. Keyboard 
users can use the Winkey as a toggle, as 
noted earlier, and touch users can use 
the Windows key button on their device 
or access the Start thumbnail that’s in  
Switcher.
Snap
After the wonder of Metro’s full-screen experiences wears off, you may start to feel 
a bit constrained by this environment. After all, Windows is named Windows for a 
reason: It has historically provided access to multiple on-screen windows—each 
representing applications and various system interfaces—simultaneously. And as 
our experience with Windows grew, many have come to expect this type of behavior. 
And yes, it’s still available with the desktops. But all of the Metro-style apps are full-
screen only.
Well, not quite.
No, you’re not going to be running multiple Metro-style apps on-screen, as you 
can do with desktop-based applications. There are security, performance, and bat-
tery life reasons for that, but no matter. What Microsoft is providing is a simple 
screen-sharing feature called Snap, which lets you use two Metro-style apps—or 
one Metro-style app and the desktop—side by side, albeit in limited ways. In this 
Figure 3-26: The Start notification tip

92
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
configuration, one app—the so-called snapped app—will occupy a small channel on 
the left or right side of the screen. And the other app, the so-called main app, will 
occupy the rest.
Not all apps support snapping fully, because they’re either useless or next to use-
less in a snapped configuration. But some apps provide specifically tailored snap 
interfaces—like Calendar and Mail—and can be quite useful in this way.
Since a picture really is worth about a thousand words in this case, examine 
Figure 3-27 to see what Snap looks like. Note that the app in the main area, on the 
right in this figure, can be the desktop or any Metro-style app.
 
Figure 3-27: Snap: Simple screen sharing
While there are a number of ways to snap an app, the most reliable—and consistent 
across mouse and touch—is to use Switcher. Here’s how you do so using either the 
mouse or touch.
After ensuring that the app (or desktop) you wish to have in the main view is 
on-screen, enable Switcher. Then, grab the app you wish to snap from the Switcher 
list of app thumbnails, and then pull it out of Switcher. As you do, the Snap border 
bar, shown in Figure 3-28, will appear. When it does, release the mouse button (or 
lift your finger from the screen) to snap the app.
Note that you can perform these same basic steps to snap the app on the right side 
of the screen. But instead of releasing the thumbnail when you pull it out of Switcher, 
drag it all the way over to the right edge of the screen until the Snap border bar appears 
there. Then release the mouse button (or lift your finger).

93
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
 
Figure 3-28: Snapping an app
There are a few other things you can do with Snap. For example, you can reverse  
the snapped and main apps so that the previously snapped app now takes up most of the 
on-screen real estate. To do so, just double-click the Snap border bar. Or, with a touch 
screen, just drag the bar toward the middle of the screen and then lift your finger.
If you’re a keyboard shortcut junkie, Snap supports some cool shortcuts. For 
example, from any Metro-style app, you can tap Winkey + . (period) to engage the 
Snap border bar and then tap that repeatedly to keep moving it to the right. (Winkey 
+ Shift + . moves to the left.) We provide a complete list of Winkey keyboard shortcuts 
in the appendix.
TIP ​ ​If this is still too limiting, consider a multi-monitor configuration. In this 
case, you can have the Start screen and all Metro-style apps on one screen and 
the desktop and its applications spread across one or more other screens. We 
discuss this configuration in Chapter 5.
Getting Alerted with Notifications
Back in the “Longhorn” days, when Microsoft was prepping the version of Windows 
that was eventually released in diminished form as Windows Vista, the software giant 
revealed that it was working on a new centralized notifications system that would be 

94
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
used by the OS as well as any third-party applications that needed this functionality. 
The idea was a good one since most Windows applications simply do their own thing 
when it comes to notifications. But because of delays in getting Vista to market, that 
notifications system—like many other good ideas from the Longhorn project—never 
made it to into Windows.
Flash forward a decade and Microsoft has finally realized its vision for a central 
notifications system in Windows. That said, Windows 8 bears little resemblance to 
Longhorn, and it’s not likely that many from the Longhorn era of Microsoft could 
have foreseen the rise in touch-based devices that necessitated the full-screen 
Metro experiences in this release.
No matter. It’s here now. And while only Windows itself and new Metro-style apps can 
take advantage of this new notifications platform, they work on the desktop as well. So 
if you get a new e‑mail or have an upcoming appointment, you will still get alerted.
Windows 8 supports two types of notifications: full-screen, modal notifications 
that must be dealt with before continuing, and small, floating notification toasts 
that appear and then disappear on their own. The former are the province of Windows 
and system-level features only and are generally very important. Notification toasts, 
meanwhile, can vary in importance, but since they’re app-based, they’re never going 
to involve a decision that could render your PC inoperable.
Figure 3-29 shows a full-screen notification. As you can see, it’s a fairly jarring 
and attention-getting interface, and something you won’t miss.
 
Figure 3-29: A full-screen notification really gets in your face.

95
Using the System-Wide Metro User Experiences
An app-based notification toast, like the one in Figure 3-30, meanwhile, can be 
subtle, unless of course you are getting repeated toasts appearing back to back as 
you might with an instant messaging app. These notifications appear in the top-right 
corner of the screen and disappear if you do nothing.
Notifications are configured via PC Settings: From anywhere in Windows 8, press 
Winkey + I (or access the Charms bar and then choose Settings) to access the Settings 
pane. Then, select the link titled More PC Settings. In PC Settings, select Notifica-
tions on the left. The screen will resemble Figure 3-31.
 
Figure 3-30: A notification toast
 
Figure 3-31: Notifications settings
There are two basic areas to this interface. On the top are three options related to 
notifications generally. And on the bottom is a toggle for each Metro-style app that 
can provide notifications.
Each of these should be relatively straightforward. In the case of the apps list, 
each toggle provides you with an opportunity to determine whether individual apps 
can provide notifications. So if you feel that Messaging notifications are annoying, 
just toggle those off.
C ROSSREF  ​We discuss PC Settings further in Chapter 5.

C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
There are actually two other places where you can configure notifications somewhat.
If you navigate to Personalize and then Lock Screen in PC Settings, for example, 
you’ll see that there’s a Lock screen apps section where you can determine which, if 
any, apps can provide notifications on your PC’s or device’s lock screen. As you can 
see in Figure 3-32, this interface includes seven slots of normal notifications and one 
for an app—like Calendar—that can provide detailed status information.
 
Figure 3-32: Notifications can be configured separately for the lock screen, too.
Also, earlier in the chapter we mentioned 
the Notification icon in the Settings pane 
(Winkey + I). This interface is useful because 
it lets you temporarily toggle all notifications 
off for set periods of time. That way, if you’re 
busy, you can disable notifications using one 
of the three time periods shown in Figure 3-33 
and then be sure they’ll automatically come 
back later; if you turn them off from the main 
Notifications interface in PC Settings, you may 
simply forget to turn notifications back on 
again later.
Working with Devices
While new apps and other software-based capabilities can extend the functionality 
of Windows 8 and make it better than it was before, adding new hardware devices is

another approach. Add a printer, for example, and many of your apps will suddenly be 
able to print. Plug in an external USB-based hard drive, and your PC has more stor-
age, which can also be used by the OS and by many apps.
OK, we know you understand why adding a few hardware peripherals can make for 
a better computing experience. But we mention this here because the way in which 
Windows 8 interacts with these devices has changed, thanks to the switch to Metro. 
So while some legacy interfaces for dealing with hardware devices remain for back-
ward compatibility reasons, much of your interactions with the devices in Windows 
8 will now occur through Metro-style experiences. And more often than not, that 
means the Devices charm.
Let’s look at some common examples.
Printing
The ability to print is obviously a core capability. And while installing printer drivers 
works as it did in earlier versions of Windows—through the desktop interface using 
familiar methods—as does printing from desktop-based Windows applications, Metro-
style apps interact with printers through the Devices charm.
Consider the Metro-style version of Internet Explorer 10. You’ve found a web page 
you want to print for posterity, but there’s no printer button in the app bar and no 
menu system at all. How do you print?
In Metro, printing—like other device access—is now consistent, and it happens 
through the Devices charm. So you display this charm (perhaps through the Charms bar, 
but Winkey + K is quicker), and you’ll see something resembling Figure 3-34. And in that 
list of devices will be one or more printers, depending on how your PC is configured.
 
Figure 3-34: The Devices pane

98
C h a p t e r  3    Metro: The New User Experience
When you select the printer, the Devices pane will expand to reveal options 
related to that specific printer, as in Figure 3-35. This interface will let you make 
last-minute configurations before actually printing, with many of the options 
available via a More settings link.
To print, just tap Print.
Using Portable Storage
You may recall from previous Windows versions that an Auto Play window would 
appear when you plugged in an external storage device like a USB-based hard drive. 
In Windows 8, Auto Play is now a Metro-based experience. So when you plug in an 
external drive, you’ll see the interface in Figure 3-36.
And if you click this notification, you’ll be confronted by the user interface in 
Figure 3-37, though the options you see here will vary from device to device.

Depending on  
the app, Ctrl + 
P still works for 
printing, too.

Figure 3-37: Deciding what to do when this type of device is plugged into  
the PC
As is the case with desktop applications, this storage is now available to any 
Metro-style app as well. You can see this for yourself in apps that support the Metro-
style File Picker, a new full-screen experience for selecting files on disk. As you 
can see in Figure 3-38, a USB-based hard drive is automatically available to the File 
Picker just as it is to Windows Explorer on the desktop.
 
Figure 3-38: External storage is available to Metro-style apps too, via the File Picker, a sort of 
Metro “Open File” interface.

Using a Second Screen
When you plug a second display into your PC, you can choose between a variety of 
display modes, including duplicating the display on both screens, extending the dis-
play across the screens, or using only one of the two screens. In earlier Windows ver-
sions, finding and then configuring this feature was fairly ponderous. But Windows 8 
provides a handy new Metro-style experience that makes this easier than ever.
To see it, make sure you have a second display attached to your PC. Then, access 
the Devices charm (Winkey + K) and select Second screen. You’ll see the Second 
screen pane appear as in Figure 3-39.
C ROSSREF  ​This was only a short example. We thoroughly discuss multiple 
display usage in Chapter 5.
 
Figure 3-39: This pane lets you configure how a secondary screen works.
You can press

Summary
Summary
Windows 8 provides an exciting and new full-screen user experience we call Metro 
that brings the best of mobile devices to your PC and positions Windows for the 21st 
century. Yes, Metro is a touch-first interface that will be most at home on touch-
based, iPad-like devices. But Metro works just fine on all kinds of PCs, including 
those with a keyboard and mouse, and it provides an amazing new platform upon 
which a new generation of full-screen, Metro-style apps run.
As important, the Metro experience pervades other Windows 8 experiences, 
including the Windows desktop, providing charms, search, sharing, app switching, 
app snapping, notifications, and device interactions that work everywhere in Win-
dows. In this way, we can see that Metro isn’t a “thing on a thing” or even a “thing 
next to a thing.” It’s the heart and soul of Windows 8. It is, ultimately, what makes 
Windows 8 so special.

While the touch-friendly Metro-style user experience is clearly  
the big story in Windows 8, most Windows users have a rich history with the Windows 
desktop and the many, many applications and utilities that have run in this environment 
for years. Fortunately, all of these things are still available in Windows 8, since this OS 
includes an updated and enhanced version of the traditional Windows desktop environ-
ment, its File Explorer file manager, and the other related capabilities Windows users 
know and love. And this is true whether you’re using a traditional desktop PC or laptop, 
or a newfangled tablet computer or hybrid PC, and whether you’re using Windows 8 or 
Windows RT.

104
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
NO TE ​ ​There is one major exception to this rule. While Windows 8-based PCs 
and devices of course provide all of the desktop features you’ve come to know and 
love, those based on Windows RT—the ARM-based variant of Windows 8—are 
somewhat limited in that they cannot run any third-party Windows desktop soft-
ware. That said, all of the features described in this chapter work equally well and 
identically in Windows RT as they do with their Intel-type Windows 8 brethren.
How the Metro-style environment and Windows desktop interact with each other 
is an important consideration for anyone moving to this new operating system. After 
all, in previous Windows versions, the Windows desktop was the entire user interface, 
the face that Windows presented to the world. But in Windows 8, the desktop behaves, 
conceptually at least, as an app that works within the new Windows Runtime (WinRT) 
and the Metro-style user experience. As such, even users who stick strictly to the desk-
top environment will still need to deal with, and understand, various Metro-style user 
interfaces, including the new Back and Start experiences, Switcher, and the Charms 
bar. And indignities of indignities, you’ll even need to use Metro to shut down your PC!
This chapter examines each of these issues as well as all of the new Windows 
desktop features that Microsoft added to this version of the OS. If you were expecting 
very little in the way of desktop enhancements thanks to a focus on the Metro envi-
ronment, prepare to be surprised. There are some very nice updates to the desktop in 
Windows 8.
What’s New on the Windows Desktop?
To best understand what’s new with the Windows 8 desktop, let’s take a quick look back 
at the Windows 7 desktop, shown in Figure 4-1. This was the default (and only) user 
experience in the previous version of Windows, and aside from a few minor bits that 
differed between various product versions, this was essentially what all Windows 7 
users saw when they booted into the operating system.
The Windows 7 desktop comprises a few key items, most of which hadn’t changed 
at all since Windows 95. These include one or more desktop icons (with Recycle Bin 
being the only icon pretty much guaranteed to appear every time), an optional selec-
tion of desktop gadgets (graphical utilities that would “float” over the desktop but 
under any open windows; these first appeared in Windows Vista), a Start button (or 
Start orb, as it was officially called), a taskbar, a system tray (with white notification 
icons and a clock), and the Aero Peek button, which temporarily hid the on-screen 
windows so you could peek at the underlying desktop.

105
What’s New on the Windows Desktop?
 
Figure 4-1: The Windows 7 desktop
The Windows 8 desktop, perhaps not surprisingly, doesn’t look all that different. As 
you can see in Figure 4-2, it looks almost identical to the Windows 7 desktop, though 
the Aero “glass” look and feel has been replaced with a flatter, more opaque, and some-
what Metro-like user experience that is battery-life friendly and a bit more consistent 
with the new Metro user experiences in Windows 8.
 
Figure 4-2: The Windows 8 desktop looks and works like its predecessor, but with some minor 
differences.

106
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
Look a bit closer, however, and you will notice some other differences. For the most 
part, these differences involve user interface elements that were present in Windows 7 
but are now missing in Windows 8. What’s interesting is that the two biggest—the 
Start and Aero Peek—are in fact still functionally available in Windows 8, even though 
they’re no longer visually there.
The Start Button Is Dead. . .Long Live the Start Button
Microsoft’s decision to remove the Start button is, perhaps, one of the more contro-
versial decisions in Windows 8, because this on-screen button has been a ubiquitous 
mainstay of the Windows user interface since 1995. But before you get too upset over 
the change, it’s helpful to understand why it happened and how Windows 8 makes an 
onscreen button on the desktop superfluous anyway.
The why part is straightforward. With the addition of the Metro environment 
as the default user interface in Windows 8, Microsoft has replaced the application 
launching capabilities of the desktop-based Start menu (and, in Windows 7, the task-
bar) with a new Metro-style interface called the Start screen. Microsoft calls this the 
new Start experience. (They do love the word experience.) And they wanted it to work 
equally well—and consistently—from both of Windows 8’s user interfaces, Metro and 
the desktop.
What this means is that every time you tap the Windows key button on your 
Windows device, or press the Windows key on your keyboard—while the desktop 
is displayed, that is—the desktop will disappear and be replaced by the new Start 
screen. This happens instead of the old behavior where the Start menu would 
display.
But what about mouse or touch users? Your muscle memory is telling you to tap 
the Start button. But the Start button is gone.
Or is it?
As it turns out, Windows 8 includes methods for triggering this new Start experi-
ence for both the mouse and touch. As with other system-wide actions, these new 
triggers are part of a collective series of edge UIs, and while we cover this topic pretty 
heavily in Chapter 3, this one is worth discussing here as well since they work with 
the desktop, too, and many users coming to Windows 8 on a traditional PC will inter-
act with it mostly from the desktop.
To trigger the Start experience with the mouse, move the mouse cursor down into 
the lower-left corner of the screen, into the area where the Start button used to be.
As discussed in 
3
3
Chapter 3, many 
capabilities of the 
old Start menu 
can now be found 
in other Metro 
interfaces, such as 
the Charms bar.
If you’re 
3
3
using an older 
or nonstandard 
keyboard that 
doesn’t have a 
Windows key, try 
Ctrl + Esc instead.

107
What’s New on the Windows Desktop?
NO TE ​ ​You can simply push that cursor right into the corner, since Windows 
will stop it from moving beyond the edges of the physical display, even on multi-
monitor setups.
As you hit the lower-left corner of the screen with the mouse cursor, something 
new happens: A Start tip appears, providing a visual thumbnail of the Start screen as 
an indication of what will happen if you click it. This can be seen in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: The new Start tip appears when you  
mouse into the lower-left corner of the screen.
To navigate to the Start screen, simply click the Start tip. (To get back, you’ll need 
to do one of the following: Click the Desktop tile on the Start screen, press the Win-
dows key on your keyboard, or tap the Windows key button on your Windows device.)
 
Figure 4-4: A hidden power user menu can be found by  
right-clicking the Start tip.
To trigger this edge UI with a multi-touch-based device, you can choose between 
two different edge UIs: the Switcher or the Charms bar. Both are discussed in Chapter 3, 
and then again later in this chapter, but since the Switcher method more closely mimics 
the mouse-based description above, let’s look at that quickly here.
Power users 
3
3
will want to right-
click the tip. When 
they do, they’ll see 
the magical power 
user menu shown in 
Figure 4-4. Winkey  
+ X will also trigger 
this menu.

108
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
To activate the Switcher edge UI from the desktop, swipe in from the left edge of 
the screen, and when the previous app thumbnail appears, swipe back to the left. If 
you do it just right, the Switcher appears, as in Figure 4-5. Just tap the Start tip at the 
bottom to return to the Start screen.
 
Figure 4-5: Switcher can appear over the desktop, too.
In case it’s not obvious, all of these methods for accessing the new Start experi-
ence from the desktop work like a toggle. So when you’re on the desktop and engage 
it, using any available method, you will navigate to the Start screen. But if you imme-
diately repeat that step, without launching any other apps, you’ll navigate back to 
the desktop.
Peek Lives On, Too
Where the Start button disappearing act will no doubt cause much wailing and pon-
tificating, few will cry for Aero Peek, which is also missing, seemingly, in Windows 8. 
But as with the Start button, rumors of Aero Peek’s death are exaggerated. Although 
the small UI button that used to trigger this effect is gone, the Peek lives on.
To trigger Peek, you can employ one of the following methods:
Keyboard:
3
3
 Press Winkey + , (comma)
Mouse: 
3
3
Move the mouse cursor into the very lower-right corner of the screen.
Either way, the effect is the same, and you will visually peek through to the desk-
top, so that any floating windows that were on-screen will disappear temporarily, 
replaced by the outlines shown in Figure 4-6.
There’s no  
3
3
way to trigger  
Peek via touch.

109
Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You Get in the Desktop, Too
Beyond the Start button and Peek, much of what you’ll see initially on the Windows 
desktop is identical, or nearly so, to the Windows 7 desktop. But with this being a new 
OS, there are indeed numerous other changes to discover. To find them, all you need to 
do is move the mouse around a bit or start clicking on things.
Or simply read on.
 
Figure 4-6: With Peek, you can peek under any windows and see the desktop  
and the icons it contains.
NO TE ​ ​You can also right-click on the Peek area to display a context menu that 
provides an additional choice, Show Desktop. This option minimizes all on-
screen desktop windows so you can actually access the icons on the desktop if 
you’d like, and not just view them as you do with Peek.
Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You 
Get in the Desktop, Too
While many users of traditional PCs—desktops, laptops, and other devices without 
touch screens—are likely wondering what good the Metro user experiences are to 
them, especially if they’re committed to using old-school Windows applications like 
Office or Photoshop, it’s worth remembering that Metro is, in fact, the underlying 
operating system and that it pervades (some might say invades) the desktop envi-
ronment as well. So Metro isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. Indeed, even those 
If you press

Winkey + D from 
the Start screen 
or from any Metro-
style app, you will 
navigate to the 
desktop, sans the 
Peek effect.

110
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
firmly committed to the desktop will find themselves dealing with Metro experiences 
throughout the day.
This isn’t as bad as it may seem. These experiences work just as well with your 
keyboard and mouse as they do with touch screens, for example, and they provide 
a fairly gentle way for recalcitrant desktop holdouts to dip their toes into the Metro 
waters, so to speak. As a result, these users become acclimated to the new way of 
doing things, and then perhaps make a future Windows tablet or other touch-based 
device purchase not just doable but even preferable.
OK, no promises. But you need to know how this stuff works, and at the very least, 
becoming proficient—and thus more efficient—with Metro is a key step toward mas-
tering Windows 8.
Back
As part of the simplified multitasking model in Windows 8, users can access  
a smartphone-like Back experience (or Back stack) that provides a quick way to 
return to the most recently used app. And yes, this is part of the reason we describe 
the desktop as if it were an app (even though, technically, it’s a bit more nuanced 
than that: The entire desktop is placed in the Back stack, not any of its individual 
Windows applications.
You can access the most recently used Metro app in the Back stack in the following 
manner:
Mouse: 
3
3
Move the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen. A Back tip, in 
thumbnail form, will appear as shown in Figure 4-7, indicating the most 
recently used app. Click it to navigate to that app.
 
Figure 4-7: The Back tip is a thumbnail  
that indicates the previously used app in  
the Back stack.

applications in a side-by-side display, which is described shortly.

Start
In previous Windows versions dating back to Windows 95, the Start experience was 
centered completely on the Start menu. This menu was evolved over the years and 
expanded in functionality and usefulness fairly dramatically in subsequent Windows 
versions. So did the ways in which we accessed the Start experience: first via a soft-
ware button called the Start button (later renamed Start orb) and then via a Windows 
key on PC keyboards.
In Windows 8, everything is changing yet again. The Start experience is now a 
full-screen Start screen, though if it helps you to think of it as a Start menu, there’s 
some logic to that. And Start now acts as a toggle, which is another difference: Acti-
vate it from the desktop, or from a Metro-style app, and you’ll navigate to the Start 
screen. But activate Start from the Start screen and you will return to the previously 
used app (including the desktop).
How you activate Start has changed, too. And while you can still use the Windows 
key on a keyboard to access the Start experience, the software Start button is gone. 
So there are some new ways of doing things.
Here’s how you activate the Start experience from the Windows desktop:
Mouse: 
3
3
As described earlier in the chapter, the Start button is gone, but you 
can still move the mouse cursor down to the same basic place on-screen—
the lower-left corner—and the Start tip will appear. Click this thumbnail to 
activate Start and, in this case, navigate to the Start screen.
Keyboard:
3
3
 Tap the Windows key (Winkey) on your keyboard or use the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl + Esc.
Touch: 
3
3
Touch users have two methods to activate Start. You can swipe in from 
the right side of the screen to display the Charms bar, and then tap the Start 
charm. Or, you can activate Switcher (described next) by swiping in from the 
left, and then quickly to the right; then tap the Start thumbnail.
You can swipe 
3
3
repeatedly to 
quickly navigate 
through every app  
in the Back stack.
You can mix 
3
3
and match, too. 
For example, type 
Winkey + C to display 
the Charms bar and 
then tap (or click)  
the Start charm. 
There are many  
other combinations, 
but you get the idea.

112
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
Switcher
Windows 8 features a convenient and consistent new task-switching interface called 
Switcher that lets you switch between and manage running tasks, including Metro-style 
apps and the Windows desktop. While we introduced Switcher earlier in the chapter, 
there are a few additional details that may be of interest.
Activating Switcher
Here are the ways in which you can activate Switcher:
Keyboard:
3
3
 This is, by far, the easiest way. Just tap Winkey + Tab to activate 
Switcher. You can hold down Winkey and repeatedly tap Tab to navigate 
through each of the various available apps. Just let go of Tab when you find 
the one to which you want to switch.
Mouse: 
3
3
Move the mouse cursor to the upper-left corner of the screen to 
activate the Back experience as described previously. Then, move the 
mouse cursor down the left edge of the screen to activate Switcher and 
select the app to which you’d like switch.
Note that there is a subtle indication that the Switcher is waiting for you when 
you engage Back; as you can see in Figure 4-8, there are a few app thumbnail 
outlines barely visible down the left edge of the screen.
Touch: 
3
3
This is the hardest one of all. You need to swipe in from the left side of 
the screen as if you are going to switch to the previously used app. When the 
previous app thumbnail appears under your finger, move back to the left until 
Switcher appears. If you do it just right, Switcher will actually dock on the 
screen and stay there until you do something.
 
Figure 4-8: Look closely, and you’ll see a hint that Switcher is available.
Remember: 
3
3
The desktop is 
conceptually just  
an app. So Switcher 
provides only a 
single entry for 
the entire desktop 
and its contained 
applications, not one 
for each Windows 
application.
In Windows 7,

Winkey + Tab 
triggered a unique 
task switcher called 
Windows Flip 3D. 
That action is no 
longer available in 
Windows 8.

113
Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You Get in the Desktop, Too
Advanced Switcher Usage
While Switcher is visible on the screen, either by being docked with touch or just by 
being made visible with the mouse, there are some additional capabilities you can use. 
These include the following:
Removing an app from the Back stack:
3
3
 If you’d like to remove a Metro-style 
app from the Back stack—effectively closing or quitting it—you can do so by 
dragging its thumbnail out of Switcher and down to the bottom of the screen. 
You can do this with the mouse or touch input types.
NO TE ​ ​You can also remove apps from the Back stack by right-clicking and 
choosing Close.
Snapping an app for use in side-by-side mode: 
3
3
As described next, Windows 8 
supports a unique side-by-side screen sharing mode called Snap that lets you 
use two apps next to each other on-screen. There are a few different ways to 
enable this functionality, as you’ll see, but if you’d like to snap a previous app 
that’s visible in the Switcher to a side of the screen alongside the current app 
(or desktop), you can right-click it in the Switcher and choose either Snap left 
or Snap right, as shown in Figure 4-9.
 
Figure 4-9: A power user method for snapping secondary apps to a side of  
the screen
Don’t worry if the notion of side-by-side apps is confusing. That’s right: Side-by-
side is our next topic.

C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
Switcher vs. Windows Flip
With all this new task switching goodness, you may be thinking that good old 
Windows Flip—the familiar Alt + Tab task switcher that dates back decades—
is on life support in Windows 8. Not so fast. As it turns out, Windows Flip has 
some important advantages over Switcher, particularly for those who will 
be spending a lot of time in the desktop. And since Microsoft sees Metro and 
the desktop coexisting for the foreseeable future, we think it’s fair to say that 
Windows Flip has some life left in it indeed.
The key advantage of this interface is that it differentiates between multiple 
desktop applications as well as individual Metro-style apps. So if you have 
Microsoft Word and File Explorer windows open on the desktop, and Mail and 
Calendar open in the Metro runtime environment, and then engage Windows 
Flip, you’ll see five items: Word, Explorer, Mail, Calendar, and Desktop. But in 
Switcher, you’ll see just three: Mail, Calendar, and Start. (This assumes you ac-
tivate Switcher from the desktop.) There are no desktop applications—or even 
the desktop itself—available in Switcher if you use it from the desktop.
This means that Switcher isn’t of use to individual desktop applications at all, 
especially if you activate it while using the desktop. So Windows Flip will remain 
a frequently used tool for all desktop users in Windows 8.
That said, it is a bit curious that Start doesn’t appear in the Windows Flip task 
list. But keyboard users simply need to use the Windows key instead.
Snap: Side-by-Side Apps
The new Metro environment in Windows 8 is designed for apps that run full screen, 
similar to how smartphone and tablet device apps work. But Windows 8 kicks things 
up a notch by offering a special side-by-side mode in which two apps can share the 
screen, albeit in limited ways. And one of those two apps can be the desktop, which is 
why we’re discussing it here.
Sadly, side-by-side display sharing is not particularly customizable. You can have 
just two apps, and the one that is considered the primary app takes up about two-thirds 
of the available on-screen real estate. Meanwhile, the secondary app is stuck with just 
one-third, roughly, of the available space. Apps that are side by side in this fashion are 
said to snap into place.
Yes, we’re sure

allusion to the Aero 
Snap window docking

in Windows 7 and is

Windows 8 desktop.

Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You Get in the Desktop, Too
Confused? A picture will make things clearer. Consider Figure 4-10, in which 
Microsoft’s Calendar (Metro-style) app is snapped next to the Windows desktop.
That configuration in the previous figure is one of two possible ways in which a 
snapped, or secondary, app can be snapped in place next to another app. The other, 
of course, has the snapped app placed on the right side of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 4-11. Which side you use is a matter of taste.

Conversely, it’s also possible for the Windows desktop to be the snapped, or sec-
ondary, app. However, when you enable this view, as in Figure 4-12, you’ll notice that 
the snapped desktop only displays thumbnails of the available open windows and 
isn’t too useful.
 
Figure 4-12: You can even snap the desktop.
NO TE ​ ​One interface you can’t snap is the Start screen. And to be honest, such 
a capability would be truly useful, since it could provide a snapped list of tiles 
with live updates. Maybe in Windows 9.
Using Snap to Place Apps Side by Side on the Desktop
The new side-by-side app mode can be enabled in various ways, but here are some 
instructions for the common input types. In each case, it’s best to launch the app 
you intend to use in the secondary, or snapped, mode first and then launch the 
app you intend to use as the primary app. Then you can use one of the following 
techniques to enable the snap mode:
Mouse: 
3
3
Move the mouse cursor to the upper-left corner of the screen to dis-
play the Back thumbnail. Then, while holding down the mouse button, drag 
the thumbnail downward. It will turn into a larger, floating thumbnail, as 
shown in Figure 4-13, and the side-by-side Snap bar will appear.
Release the mouse button to snap the app into the Snap area on the left.
So why would 
3
3
you ever want to 
snap the desktop? 
The best reason 
we’ve seen is to 
monitor a download 
that’s occurring in a 
desktop-based web 
browser. But frankly, 
it’s not very useful 
otherwise.

117
Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You Get in the Desktop, Too
Touch: 
3
3
Swipe in from the left edge of the screen. As you do so, the previous 
app in the Back stack will appear as a thumbnail image under your finger. Stop 
moving your finger and the side-by-side Snap bar will appear. When it does, 
release your hold on the screen and the secondary app will snap in place.
 
Figure 4-13: You can drag a previous app off Back or Switcher and then snap it in  
place alongside the desktop or another primary app.
Customizing Side-by-Side Mode
Once you’ve got two apps snapped into position in side-by-side mode, you can further 
customize the display, albeit in fairly limited ways. Here are the options available at 
your disposal:
Snap to the right instead: 
3
3
While many are happy to snap a secondary  
app to the left side of the screen, some will prefer the snapped app to 
appear on the right. While performing the snap operation, simply drag  
the app thumbnail to the right side of the screen instead of down and  
to the left.
If you’ve already snapped an app to the left side of the screen and would 
like it to appear on the right side instead, the easiest way to do so is via a 
mouse: Just move the mouse cursor to the top edge of the snapped app, and 
when the cursor changes into a small hand, grab the app and then drag it to 
the right side of the screen. With a keyboard, you may find it easier to simply 
close the snapped app, as described shortly, and just redo the snap action and 
place it on the right instead. But the convoluted way in which you can do this 
While there

is no keyboard-
based shortcut 
for enabling side-
by-side mode, 
as you’ll discover 
next, there are 
keyboard shortcuts 
for modifying the 
presentation of  
side-by-side apps.

goes like so: Press Winkey + . (period) three times to snap the secondary app 
to the right. Then press Alt + Tab (or Winkey + D) to return the desktop to the 
primary display area.
Swap the snapped and primary apps: 
3
3
Press Winkey + J to swap the snapped (sec-
ondary) and primary apps on-screen. Or via touch or mouse, simply drag the Snap 
bar toward the other side of the screen, letting go before you hit the screen edge.
Close the snapped app: 
3
3
If a secondary app is snapped on the left, press 
Winkey + Shift + . (period) to close the snapped app. Otherwise, press Win-
key + . (period). You can close the snapped app via touch or mouse by drag-
ging the Snap bar to the closest screen edge.
NO TE ​ ​Side-by-side screen sharing is more interesting for those who wish to 
stick with Metro-style apps, and we cover this feature in Chapter 3 as well as 
a result. But it’s worth mentioning here, because the desktop is considered 
an app, too, and can participate in this task management solution. Certainly, 
some apps will work well in this snapped mode, even when used in tandem 
with the desktop.
Charms
In Windows 8, Microsoft exposes many system-level services through a new user 
experience called Charms. These Charms are accessible via a bar that appears on the 
right edge of the screen in a manner that is consistent across every user experience 
in Windows 8, including the Start screen, all Metro-style apps, and the desktop. This 
can be seen in Figure 4-14.
C ROSSREF  ​Charms are central to using and understanding Windows 8, so 
we cover them as needed throughout this book. The main discussion about 
this experience, however, can be found in Chapter 3.
Opening the Charms Bar
You can access the Charms bar in a variety of ways, and as a top-level interface in 
Windows 8, it has simple triggers for all the major input types:
Mouse: 
3
3
Move the mouse cursor into the lower-right corner of the screen. As 
the cursor hits against the natural edge of the screen, a transparent preview 
of the Charms bar appears, as shown in Figure 4-15.

119
Where New Meets Old: Metro Features You Get in the Desktop, Too
 
Figure 4-14: The Charms bar is a system-wide user experience that works in the 
Start screen, Metro-style apps, and the desktop. When the Charms bar displays, an 
overlay for the time and date also appears.
 
Figure 4-15: A preview of the Charms bar appears when you mouse into one of the  
screen’s rightmost corners.
To fully enable the Charms, move up the right side of the screen. The Charms 
bar will appear normally and you can access the various options normally.
Keyboard: 
3
3
To enable the Charms bar from the keyboard, type Winkey + C.
Touch: 
3
3
With a multi-touch display, you can swipe in from the right edge of the 
screen to enable the Charms bar.
Mouse-based 
3
3
Charms access also 
works from the top-
right corner of the 
screen. But when 
the transparent 
preview of the 
Charms appears,  
you must move down 
the right edge of  
the screen to fully 
activate the  
Charms bar.
This is perhaps 
3
3
the simplest way to 
enable the Charms, 
and if you remember 
just one Windows 8 
keyboard shortcut, 
this should be it.

120
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
NO TE ​ ​Why is the Charms preview shown here? Microsoft realized that many 
users would move the mouse cursor near the right edge of the screen for a 
variety of reasons, such as to access the Peek functionality or to click an ap-
plication’s scroll bar. So the Charms bar appears in preview mode first. If the 
user doesn’t move the mouse cursor along the right edge of the screen when 
this preview appears, the Charms will disappear and you can continue doing 
whatever it is you were doing.
Accessing Charms Features
Once you’ve displayed the Charms bar, you can then access the various Charms and 
perform system-wide or context-sensitive actions. Some of the more common actions 
you may access from this interface include Settings, Search—by which you can find 
desktop applications (as well as Metro apps and PC Settings and Control Panels)—and 
Devices, which helps you interact with various hardware devices, including second-
ary displays, removable storage devices like hard drives and USB memory devices, 
and the like. These functions are all discussed later in this chapter.
Of the remaining two Charms, one, Share, does not work with the desktop or 
Windows applications at all. Instead, the Share charm is aimed solely at Metro-style 
apps, which use this system capability to share information with other apps. The 
other remaining Charm, the Start icon, can be used as a toggle for the Start screen.
How you access these Charms varies by input device. With the mouse, you simply 
navigate the mouse cursor to the appropriate Charm and click it once. Via touch, it’s 
a simple tap. And if you access the Charms bar from the keyboard, you can use the 
arrow keys to navigate around and then press Enter (or Space) to activate a Charm.
Settings
While Windows 8 offers the same Screen Resolution and Personalize context menus 
from the desktop as did its predecessor, Windows 7, Windows 8 also expands on this 
notion of desktop settings by making some of these features available via a handy new 
Metro-based Settings interface as well. This feature is accessed via the Charms bar, as 
noted previously. But if you’re a keyboard maven, you can also access Settings from 
the desktop (or from any Metro-style experience) more quickly by tapping Winkey + I.
However you choose to enable it, the Settings pane for the desktop should resemble 
Figure 4-16.

which concerns system customization.
Personalization:

While the top part of the Settings pane is context-sensitive and will change 
depending on what you’re viewing on-screen, this interface is also a system-wide 
interface. So the Settings pane also provides various system settings, which always 
appear near the bottom of the pane. We discuss these settings in Chapter 3.

C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
Notifications
Windows 8 supports new kinds of system and app notifications, both of which work 
consistently in the Metro and desktop environments. And, as we’re sure you must 
suspect by now, these notifications are of course Metro-based experiences. So they 
appear as an overlay of sorts over the screen, whether you’re looking at the Start 
screen, a Metro-style app, or, yes, the desktop.
The new Windows 8 notifications are also discussed in Chapter 3—along with a 
ton of other Metro user experiences—but let’s see how they interact with the desktop. 
There are two key notification types to consider: Full-screen, modal notifications and 
notification toasts, small floating windows that don’t prevent you from getting other 
work done.
An example of a full-screen notification is shown in Figure 4-17. These notifica-
tions are modal in the sense that they must be addressed before you can move on. 
You’ll see this type of notification when something important happens, such as when 
the new SmartScreen security feature suspects you’re downloading a malicious file 
and wants you to think twice before proceeding.
 
Figure 4-17: A full-screen notification
Notification toasts are far more subtle. They appear as small floating windows 
near the top right of the screen, as shown in Figure 4-18. If you don’t address this 
kind of notification, it will simply disappear.
 
Figure 4-18: A notification toast
Okay, they’re 
3
3
not technically 
modal in that 
you can, in fact, 
interact with the 
underlying screen if 
you really want to. 
But the full-screen 
notifications do 
make it hard to  
do so.

123
Managing Files and Folders
Notification toasts appear for all kinds of reasons, including when you install 
a new application that can change file associations, when you plug in a USB-based 
storage device, and so on. Also, many Metro-style apps, like Mail, Calendar, and Mes-
saging, utilize these types of notifications. For example, Mail can be configured to 
notify you each time a new e‑mail arrives.
Managing Files and Folders
As with previous versions of Windows, you use the desktop interface to interact 
with the filesystem and manage files and folders. This occurs, as before, via the File 
Explorer interface, which has been nicely updated in Windows 8 with a new, ribbon-
based design similar to that used by Microsoft Office and Windows applications, such 
as Paint and WordPad and a new Metro-like (but not Metro-based) window design. 
This section examines the new File Explorer and the improvements to the ways in 
which you interact with files and folders in Windows 8.
Understanding the New File Explorer
File Explorer debuted (as Windows Explorer) in Windows 95, but Windows has of 
course always had a graphical interface for managing files and folders. In fact, even 
the first version of Windows, dating all the way back to 1985, included a basic file 
manager application called MS-DOS Executive.
While File Explorer was evolved over previous Windows versions, it’s been thor-
oughly overhauled with a new, Metro-like and ribbon-based UI in Windows 8, and as 
a result, this version is the best yet. But don’t take our word for it. Let’s compare the 
Windows 8 version of Explorer to Windows Explorer from Windows 7 to better under-
stand what’s changed.
First, take a look at Windows 7. As you can see in Figure 4-19, this version of File 
Explorer is streamlined, with most advanced options hidden under the Organize 
command bar item.
In Windows 8, Explorer drops the Aero glass and adopts the new ribbon-based UI, 
replacing the previous version’s command bar with a more powerful but denser inter-
face that puts all the options you’ll ever need—and then some—right up front. For-
tunately, thanks to feedback during the Windows 8 prerelease cycle, Microsoft opted 
to hide the ribbon by default. So the Explorer UI you’ll probably see the first time you 
use this application will likely resemble the one shown in Figure 4-20.
File Explorer

was called Windows 
Explorer in previous 
Windows versions.

Figure 4-19: Explorer from Windows 7
 
Figure 4-20: The Windows 8 Explorer has a ribbon UI, but it’s hidden by default.
To expand the ribbon and see more commands, click the Expand the Ribbon 
control in the top-right corner of the window. (It resembles a downward-pointing 
arrow. You can also type Ctrl + F1.) When you expand the ribbon UI, File Explorer will 
resemble Figure 4-21.
Interestingly, what you see here only represents a subset of the commands that are 
available in the new File Explorer. And that’s because the ribbon has several tabs, and 
only one of them—Home, in this case—is displayed at a time. You can click the other 
two tabs that are always available, Share and View, to see the commands they provide.
Other tabs 
3

are possible. For 
example, if you 
select an image file, 
you’ll see a Manage: 
Picture Tools tab 
appear. Select a disk 
and Drive: Disk Tools 
appears.

125
Managing Files and Folders
 
Figure 4-21: With the ribbon displayed, far more commands are readily available.
While it would be overly pedantic to step through every single command in this 
interface—we do have certain assumptions about your capabilities, after all—a short 
discussion of each of the new default tabs is perhaps in order.
First, there’s a tab that’s not a tab: The colored File tab is really a button that 
displays the new File menu. Shown in Figure 4-22, this menu provides several useful 
options, including the ability to open a new window, ideal for side-by-side file copy-
ing, open a command prompt or PowerShell window, delete the history in your recent 
places and address bar history lists, and access help.

list from this menu. 
This list is otherwise 
available via the File 
Explorer taskbar 
button.

126
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
Next, the Home tab includes the most commonly needed commands related to 
files and folders, and for the most part, this is the obvious place to start if you’re 
a heavy mouse user and like to click on icons to initiate actions, such as Move to, 
Copy to, and Rename.
The Share tab contains commands related to sharing, of course, and for this reason 
it’s a location you most likely won’t be using very often.
The View tab, conversely, contains a number of commands we wish were more 
easily accessible, including the various icon sizes—Extra Large Icons, Large Icons, 
Medium Icons, Small Icons, List, Tiles, Details, and Content—and the various group-
ing options. It’s perhaps not coincidental that File Explorer has a miniature set of 
buttons in the status bar in the lower-right corner of the window that lets you toggle 
between two of the most common icon sizes, Details and Large Icons.
NO TE ​ ​If you enjoy creating your own libraries, Windows 8 does have a new fea-
ture where you can customize a library’s icon to any icon in the system, offering 
a much more personalized look.
Put simply, the File Explorer ribbon is something that new users should leave dis-
played until they’re comfortable with the new interface. But power users will likely 
want to keep it hidden and enjoy the simpler interface afforded by this configuration.
NO TE ​ ​Hidden in the upper-left corner of the File Explorer window is a new 
Quick Access Toolbar, which can be customized with the commands you need 
most often. That’s ideal for power users who want to hide the ribbon but also 
want access to a handful of useful commands.
OK, it’s time to see what you can really do with this thing. While most of the 
behaviors you’ll see in File Explorer are the same as with previous Windows versions, 
there have been some key changes and improvements as well. In keeping with the 
focus of this book, we’ll assume that you understand the basics, and how things used 
to work, and highlight only these new features.
Working with Files
While we await a future in which the data we work with is managed for us automati-
cally via some cloud-based mechanism, the reality of today is that we work with files 
regularly. These include documents related to work, such as Word documents, Power-
Point presentations, and Excel spreadsheets, as well as photo files, music files, video

Managing Files and Folders
files, and many others. Windows 8, like all previous versions, includes all the basic 
file operations one might expect—copy, move, rename, delete, and so on—and many 
of these have been improved nicely in this release.
Copying and Moving Files
Microsoft has significantly updated the file copy and move experience in Windows 8, 
making it both faster and easier to manage. If you’re familiar with how this works in 
Windows 7 and older Windows versions, you know that each file and/or move opera-
tion you begin creates its own file or move window, and that each subsequent opera-
tion slows everything down to an eventual crawl. The multi-window file copy/move 
experience in Windows 7 can be seen in Figure 4-23.
So how does one improve on a cluttered, slow experience? Simple: Make it stream-
lined and faster. And that’s exactly what’s happened in Windows 8. Now, file copies and 
moves all occur in a single window in which you can pause any copy or move processes 
if you’d like to give precedence to another operation. This can be seen in Figure 4-24
 
Figure 4-23: In older Windows versions, multiple file  
copies (and moves) resulted in slower performance and  
required multiple windows.
 
Figure 4-24: The new file copy/move experience in  
Windows 8

128
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
You can also click the More Details button to display a new detailed view of the 
file copy/move experience that shows the speed of the operation, how much data is 
left to transfer, and so on. This More Details view can be seen in Figure 4-25.
 
Figure 4-25: Detail view of the new file  
copy/move experience
Under the hood, things have improved dramatically, and file copies and moves 
occur much more quickly than before, even when you have multiple file operations 
going at once.
But what about when things go wrong? One of the most common things that can 
happen during a file copy or move operation is that one or more of the files involved in 
the operation already exists in the destination folder. So Windows has always offered 
up a dialog or window in these situations, asking the user what to do.
In Windows 7, Microsoft improved what it calls Explorer’s “confliction resolution” 
logic to pretty good effect. But in Windows 8, it’s done so again, offering its most 
obvious interface yet. This is actually quite important, because when you see the 
window shown in Figure 4-26 in Windows 7, it’s not always clear which option you 
should choose.
Things are considerably clearer in Windows 8. Now, when a file conflict  
occurs, you see the window shown in Figure 4-27. The Replace or Skip Files window 
lets you choose which files have precedence globally or choose them on a file-by-
file basis.
You can find out 
3

more about each 
of the files in the 
conflict windows by 
mousing over them.

appear, displaying its 
path. Want to view

Figure 4-26: Windows 7 made it somewhat  
difficult to resolve file copy and move conflicts.
 
Figure 4-27: In Windows 8, file copy/move conflicts  
are more easily resolved.
Renaming Files
While the act of renaming a file is simple enough and hasn’t changed markedly since 
Windows 7, there is one neat aspect to multi-file renaming that’s worth mentioning, 
since so few are aware of it. And that’s that Windows 8 supports a cool way of renaming 
multiple files in a folder.
To recap, you can rename an individual file by selecting it and pressing F2, by 
selecting it and then clicking it again with the mouse, or via touch by selecting it 
and then tapping it again. When a file is in rename mode, its name is highlighted as 
shown in Figure 4-28. If you start typing now, you will replace the current name with 
whatever you type.

130
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
 
Figure 4-28: When a file is in rename mode, its name appears highlighted.
Normally, you hit Enter when you’re done renaming a file. But if you want to move 
to the next file and rename that, tap Tab instead. This will put the next file in rename 
mode, allowing you to instantly rename it next. You can keep tapping Tab, instead of 
Enter, to rename subsequent files in the current folder.
Pin to Start
In Windows 7, Microsoft allowed us to pin application shortcuts to the taskbar for 
the first time, providing a new way to launch applications. (Previously, you could 
only pin applications to the Start menu.) And starting with Internet Explorer 9, 
Microsoft provided this same capability to web apps, letting sites like Hotmail, 
SkyDrive, Amazon.com, The New York Times, and many others work like pseudo-
applications, pinned to the taskbar or Start menu for quick access.
This is very useful because most Windows users don’t spend all day using just 
Windows applications. They also use a lot of popular web apps and services. And by 
mixing and matching shortcuts for all of these things side by side on the taskbar, as 
shown in Figure 4-29, users can organize their workspace in a way that mimics what 
they’re really doing all day long.
 
Figure 4-29: You can mix desktop application and web app shortcuts on the taskbar  
in Windows 7 and 8.
These capabilities carry forward in Windows 8, and you can pin applications and 
web apps (via Internet Explorer 10, now) to the taskbar just as you did before, using 
exactly the same methods. But as you know, Microsoft is also replacing the Start menu 
with the new Start screen in Windows 8, and that interface is the primary place for you

folders, too, not 
just files.

Managing Files and Folders
to manage and launch the apps you use most frequently. As discussed in Chapter 3, 
you can easily pin new Metro-style apps to the Windows 8 Start screen. Can you do the 
same for classic, Windows desktop applications like Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, 
and the like?
Yes, you can.
There are two basic interfaces for accomplishing this. You can use the new system-
wide search functionality that is available in Windows 8, as described later in this 
chapter. Or you can do so directly from File Explorer.
Here’s the best part. This functionality works for applications, as you’d expect. 
But it also works for libraries and folders. And you can pin favorite web apps and sites 
via Internet Explorer 10, though we cover that in Chapter 7.
To pin a folder or library to the Start screen, navigate to the location’s container 
in File Explorer, right-click it, and choose Pin to Start as shown in Figure 4-30.
 
Figure 4-30: You can pin applications to the Metro-style  
Start screen from the desktop environment.
As with anything else that’s pinned to the Start screen, the folder or library 
is placed at the end of the Start screen. From there, you can position it as needed. 
(This functionality is discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5.)
Using External Storage
Windows 8 works with external storage devices, such as USB-based hard drives and 
memory sticks, in a manner that is very similar to Windows 7. That said, the user 
experience that appears the first time you plug such a device into your computer has

changed in Windows 8, and is now a Metro-based notification rather than a dialog 
box or pop-up window as before.
The first time you plug in a USB storage device, you will see the Metro-style 
notification toast shown in Figure 4-31.

Tap the notification to choose what to do with these types of devices going forward. 
As you can see in Figure 4-32, the available choices can include using the device to 
speed up the PC with ReadyBoost, to back up File History (which is described in Chap-
ter 11), to view the files with File Explorer, or to take no action. Choose wisely because 
this interface will never appear again, at least not automatically.

will vary according to the performance  
characteristics of your PC and the

Okay, you don’t have to get it right the first time. If you want to change your 
choice later, you can. Just navigate to the Computer view in File Explorer, right-click 
the icon for an attached USB-based storage device and choose Open AutoPlay from 
the context menu that appears. You’ll be provided with the same Metro-style experi-
ence shown earlier.

Managing Files and Folders
Using Disk Images
In Windows 8, Microsoft has added support for two very popular disc (and disk) image 
formats, ISO and VHD, allowing users to browse within these special files as if they 
were physical discs (or disks) connected to the PC.
If you’re not familiar with these formats, a quick overview should get you up to 
speed. ISO is a disc image format in which the contents of an optical disc (CD, DVD, 
and the like) are packaged into a single archive file, generally with an .iso extension, 
which is similar to a ZIP file. You can then later burn this ISO file to disc, creating a 
copy of the original.
VHD, or virtual hard disk, files are created for Microsoft’s virtualization solutions, 
including Hyper-V and Windows Virtual PC. These files represent a hard disk drive, 
and as you’ll discover in Chapter 14, they are useful in a number of scenarios, such as 
testing operating systems and other software, for help desk support, and for software 
developers.
While Microsoft has used both ISO and VHD file formats to distribute evaluation 
and even final versions of Windows and other software in the past, it’s never really for-
mally supported these formats in Windows to any major degree. The one exception is 
ISO burning support: Starting with Windows 7, you can burn ISO files to disc natively 
with the integrated Windows Disc Image Burner utility. (This capability also exists in 
Windows 8, as you’d expect.) But you couldn’t browse into them as you would with a 
physical disk.
Now you can.
Windows 8 automatically mounts both ISO and VHD files so that they become, in 
effect, part of the PC’s filesystem, just as with any other attached storage device. For 
example, when you plug a USB hard drive into your PC, it may become the E: drive, 
or whatever. So it is with both ISO and VHD files: Simply by opening such a file—by 
double-clicking it with the mouse, say—it becomes part of the filesystem and imme-
diately picks up the next available drive letter.
Let’s see how this works.
Using an ISO File with File Explorer
If you double-click on an ISO file in Windows 8, two things happen. First, a new 
Explorer window opens, letting you browse into the contents of the file as if it were 
a physical storage device. And second, a new virtual optical drive is mounted in the 
filesystem and given the next available drive letter. Both of these things can be seen 
in Figure 4-33.

134
C h a p t e r  4    (Still) Alive and Kicking: The Windows Desktop
 
Figure 4-33: ISO files work just like any other storage device in Windows 8.
Because an ISO file works like physical storage, it can be used like any other 
storage device. You can navigate through its virtual directory structure using File 
Explorer, copy files out as needed, and even run applications contained within the 
file. This means, for example, that you no longer need to burn an ISO file to disc if 
you don’t want to. Instead, you can just mount it in the filesystem and run whatever 
Setup or other applications it contains.
You may have noticed that an ISO file creates a new tab in Explorer when the file 
is mounted. This Disk Tools: Drive tab is of more use for other types of drives, but for 
an ISO file it’s pretty much there to provide a way to eject—really, unmount—the ISO. 
This will remove the ISO from the filesystem, along with its drive letter.
Using a VHD File with File Explorer
VHD files work similarly to ISO files in Windows 8, and offer other unique virtual-
ization-related capabilities. However, there is one subtle but important difference. 
Whereas an ISO file is treated as a removable disc when it is mounted, a VHD file is 
treated as a fixed hard disk.
When you double-click a VHD file in Windows 8, a new drive letter is added to 
Explorer, just as with an ISO file, but it appears as a fixed disk, not a removable disk. 
You can see this in Figure 4-34, where the VHD appears next to the PC’s main storage 
device (which is typically a hard drive or SSD).
Okay, so you may be thinking: So what? The icon’s different, but you can still 
navigate around in the VHD as you do with an ISO, and of course use all the standard 
file management actions you can with physical storage or ISO files. But there is an 
This is, in fact, 
3

the primary reason 
that Windows 8 
offers this capability: 
It allows you to run 
the Setup application 
from an ISO file 
without first burning 
the file to disc.
You can also

mount an ISO file 
by right-clicking 
and choosing Mount 
from the context 
menu.

important distinction to mounting a VHD vs. an ISO: With a VHD, you get the full 
suite of Windows 8 disk utilities to work with.
 
Figure 4-34: VHD files mount as fixed disks in Windows 8: Here, Drive G: is a VHD, not a  
physical hard disk.
To see what this means, open File Explorer, navigate to the Computer view and 
select the VHD. As you can see in Figure 4-35, the Disk Tools: Drive ribbon tab is now 
fully enabled, providing access to advanced capabilities, such as BitLocker, disk 
optimization and cleanup, format, and more.
 
Figure 4-35: VHDs offer many more options than ISO files.
That said, you can still eject a mounted VHD just as you do with ISO: Right-click 
and choose Eject, or select Eject from the Disk Tools: Drive tab in the Explorer ribbon.

Managing Classic Windows Applications
While Windows does offer some basic applications and, in Windows 8, some new Metro-
style apps as well, most Windows users will want to install a number of more full-featured 
Windows applications, such as Microsoft Office, as well. And while Microsoft is moving 
inexorably to a future of Metro-style apps, Windows 8 also works with traditional (one 
might say, “old-fashioned”) Windows applications almost exactly like its predecessors. 
But there have been a handful of improvements in this area, so we’ll discuss the changes 
in this section.
Configuring Desktop Applications
From a compatibility perspective, Windows 8 works just like Windows 7, though you 
can now use the built-in Application Compatibility tools to emulate Windows 7 if 
needed. But from our regular usage of Windows 8, it’s pretty obvious that little in the 
way of compatibility work will be required, and if you have an application that works 
with Windows 7, it should work fine with Windows 8 as well.
Of course, with the move to a Metro-like user experience, Windows 8 users will 
need to deal with a few Metro-related nuances when it comes to working with classic 
desktop applications. And the big two, in our experience, involve file associations 
and the pinning of applications to the Metro-style Start screen.
Desktop Applications and File Associations
Most Windows users are probably familiar with the notion of file associations, where 
various applications are known to be compatible with different file types and Windows 
provides an interface by which you can select which of those applications is used by 
default. Likewise, Windows has long supported an Open With functionality that lets you 
override the default file association on the fly and use a different application. This lat-
ter capability is usually accessed by a right-click context menu such as the one shown in 
Figure 4-36. Here, we’re overriding the default file association for .jpg picture files and 
opening them with Windows Photo Viewer instead.
This functionality works as it did in Windows 7. But there is one major difference 
in this version of the OS: Windows 8 supports both new, Metro-style apps as well as 
classic Windows applications. So it’s possible that the list of applications you could 
use to open a file will contain a mix of both Metro and desktop applications. And 
aside from Open With, which works as an Explorer extension as before, the interfaces 
you use to configure file associations are now Metro-based.

137
Managing Classic Windows Applications
 
Figure 4-36: Overriding a file association with Open With
There are two key times you’ll run into these new interfaces. When you install a 
new application that tries to associate itself with various file types, Windows 8 will 
display a notification toast, like the one in Figure 4-37, alerting you that there are 
new file association choices to make.
If you click the toast, you’ll be pre-
sented with a window similar to the one 
shown in Figure 4-38. (It will, of course, 
vary according to the file type.) Here, you 
see a list of Metro-style apps and desktop 
applications that can open a certain file 
type. And if you always want to open that 
file type with a certain application, this is 
a great time to make sure that happens.
And be sure to click the See All link to 
expand the window, when available, to see 
more options.
But what if you’re not quick enough 
and the toast disappears? Or perhaps you

simply want to change the file association at a later time. In these situations, you 
can redisplay the new, Metro-style file association interface in a surprisingly old-
fashioned way. Simply find a document or file type for which you want to change the 
associated application, right-click it, and choose Open With and then Choose Default 
Program. Voila!
How Pin to Start Works for New Application Installs
We discussed how you can pin any application to the Metro-style Start screen earlier 
in the chapter. What you might not realize, however, is that Windows 8 automatically 
pins application shortcuts to the Start search for you. This happens when you install 
any classic desktop application, and depending on the application, it can get ugly.
Some applications are simple, standalone affairs, and thus won’t pollute your 
Start screen with dozens of new icons. Install the desktop version of Google Chrome 
for example, and you’ll find that a single new tile is added to the end of the Start 
screen as shown in Figure 4-39.
 
Figure 4-39: When you install a desktop application, one or more tiles are added to the  
Start screen.
When you install more complex applications like Microsoft Office or Visual Studio, 
you could be in for a surprise: Some will populate the Start screen with multiple tiles, 
many for applications you’ll never (or perhaps rarely) need.
First, the bad news. You can’t stop this from happening. And the reason is simple: 
Because the Start screen replaces the Start menu, it emulates the Start menu, and 

139
Managing Classic Windows Applications
this is the same behavior from Windows 7 and previous Windows versions, just a bit 
more in your face.
We discuss the many ways in which you can personalize the Start screen (and 
other aspects of Windows 8) in Chapter 5, but it’s wise to check this screen after each 
Windows application install to see which tiles were added. And then you can delete 
the ones you don’t want and, if desired, reorganize those you do.
Remember that deleting tiles from the Start screen won’t remove those applica-
tions. You can see this by opening the All Apps view by tapping Winkey (or Start) and 
then choosing All Apps from the Start screen app bar, which appears at the bottom of 
the screen. In this All Apps view, all of the installed applications are available and are 
even segregated in groups.
Switching Between Running Applications, Apps, 
and Open Windows
Even when Windows was just a simple graphical front end to MS-DOS, it supported 
means by which users could switch between various running applications, bringing 
one to the visual forefront and making it the current application. These task manage-
ment capabilities have long worked with both keyboard and mouse, and even with 
touch, and include such well-understood tools as Windows Flip, the familiar Alt + Tab 
keyboard shortcut.
These capabilities largely come forward in Windows 8, which for the most part 
provides a superset of the multitasking and task-switching capabilities in Windows 7. 
But because Windows 8 includes the new Metro-style environment and full-screen 
Metro-style apps, there are a few differences.
First, it’s now possible to task switch between Metro-style experiences (like 
the Start screen) and apps and the desktop. To do so, you can use Windows Flip as 
before, tapping Alt + Tab repeatedly until you find the application or app you want. 
In Windows 8, Windows Flip provides access to individual desktop applications, 
individual Metro-style apps, and the desktop, as shown in Figure 4-40.
You can also use the new Switcher user experience, which was discussed ear-
lier in this chapter. Switcher is mouse- and touch-friendly, and provides a new 
way to switch between running tasks.
Finally, it’s worth noting that the Windows Flip 3D task-switching interface that 
was available in both Windows Vista and 7 is no longer available in Windows 8. Now, 
the Windows Flip 3D keyboard shortcut—Winkey + Tab—activates Switcher instead. 
Sorry, Flip 3D fans.

Figure 4-40: Windows Flip now works with both Metro-style app and desktop applications.
Using Task Manager
As with the task-switching functionality described earlier, Windows has also offered 
an interface called Task Manager that, among other things, provides a way for users 
to manually kill processes and applications. It’s perhaps a sad statement that this 
interface is one of the most frequently used tools in Windows, but there you go. And 
in Windows 8, it’s gotten its most impressive upgrade in years, with a simple new user 
interface that offers a superset of the functionality from previous versions.
Task Manager is accessible many ways, but the simplest is the tried-and-true 
method of right-clicking a blank area of the taskbar and choosing Task Manager from 
the context menu that appears. As you can see in Figure 4-41, the Windows 8 version 
of Task Manager offers a much simpler interface by default than its predecessors.
From this very simple interface, you can right-click an application and perform a 
number of actions, the most commonly used of which are End task (kill the applica-
tion dead), Switch to (to bring that application to the forefront), and Open file location 
(which will display the application executable in File Explorer). But since End task is 
the single most common option, there’s a button just for that: To kill any application 
immediately, select it in Task Manager and click End task.
While it’s possible that the End task button and right-click menu will meet most 
users’ needs, the power users in the audience are probably looking at the interface and 
thinking that there are many missing features. But that’s only true because they’re

hidden by default. Click More details and Task Manager will expand into a power user’s 
dream come true. Not only are all the capabilities from the Windows 7 Task Manager 
present, but there are new capabilities here as well. The advanced Task Manager inter-
face is shown in Figure 4-42.

There’s a lot going on here, but the highlights include:
Filtering for better application management: 
3
3
Using the various columns 
available in the Processes tab—CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, and so on—you 
can filter and pivot the view of running processes using a visual heat map view 
and get a better idea of how individual applications are impacting system 
performance. By filtering on Memory, for example, you can see which applica-
tions are sucking up the most RAM.
Metro-style apps and desktop applications managed together: 
3
3
As you may 
have noticed, Task Manager lets you manage both traditional desktop appli-
cations and new Metro-style apps. And you do so with the same interface and 
commands.
Manage startup applications:
3
3
 Task Manager now provides an excellent new 
capability on its Startup tab that helps you manage which desktop applica-
tions—not Metro-style apps—auto-start when Windows boots.
Services: 
3
3
Users who wished to manage system services previously needed to 
use the Services control panel. While this control panel is still available in 
Windows 8, Microsoft replicates it in the Task Manager as well. In retrospect, 
this is a fairly obvious place for this functionality.
Finding and Launching Applications with Search
Windows 7 includes a fantastic feature called Start Menu Search. To use it, you sim-
ply tap the Start button, type the term you’re looking for, and the search results are 
returned right in the Start menu. It provides an amazingly handy way to quickly 
find an application you want without mousing around the labyrinthine Start menu 
submenus.
OK, fine. But with Windows 8 doing away with the Start menu, you may be won-
dering how you can accomplish the same feat in the new operating system version.
Surprise: It works exactly the same way.
That is, if you’re using the desktop environment and would like to find and then 
run an application, just tap the Windows key on your keyboard (or otherwise return 
to the Start screen) and start typing. Instead of a Start menu–based search, you’ll 
see the new full-screen Search experience, now called Start Search, as shown in Fig-
ure 4-43. And it’s far more powerful than the old Start Menu Search.
This new Search experience now provides a filter capability where it returns both 
traditional Windows applications and Metro-style apps by default. But you can use

the various items in the Search pane on the right to change the search to Settings 
(and control panels), Files (documents and other files), and, interestingly, within 
Metro-style apps that support this functionality.
Keep typing to refine the search. When you see the application (or app) you want, 
simply click (or tap, or select) it. If it’s a desktop application, the view will switch 
back to the desktop and the selected application will launch immediately.
Knowing that Start Search now works for settings, files, and apps, you’ll probably use 
it more than ever. But even if a desktop application search is all you need, you can rest 
easy knowing that one of Windows 7’s best features has carried forward to Windows 8.

To the Cloud: Using the SkyDrive Desktop App
While Microsoft built SkyDrive support into the Metro environment, providing File 
Picker-based access to the files on that cloud service, as well as integrated setting 
sync for those who want it, there is one crucial bit missing for desktop users: you 
can’t natively navigate your SkyDrive storage using File Explorer.
Fortunately, you can overcome this issue by downloading a SkyDrive desktop 
application that integrates your SkyDrive storage with File Explorer, providing a 
libraries-like interface for exploring SkyDrive, copying and moving files to and 
from this cloud storage service, and syncing those files with your PC.
Shown in Figure 4-44, the SkyDrive application integrates with File Explorer and 
also lets you upload large files (up to 2 GB in size) to the service, which isn’t possible 
through the normal web interface. And even more exciting, it provides a unique

Remote Fetch functionality that lets you access files on remote PCs through the  
SkyDrive web interface.
The SkyDrive application and Remote Fetch aren’t really features of Windows 8, 
per se, so we won’t waste too much space on them here. But you should know that this 
application is available, since this functionality will make your Windows 8 experi-
ences even richer.

Summary
While Microsoft is very clearly heading to a future in which increasingly sophisticated 
and full-featured versions of the Metro user experience will eventually squeeze out the 
classic Windows desktop, we’re a long way from that future. And honestly, Metro and 
the desktop will coexist for the foreseeable future, thanks to the over one billion PCs 
out there still running classic Windows applications and the vast depth of experience 
that users have with this environment.
Fortunately, Microsoft hasn’t left desktop users in the lurch with Windows 8. This 
version of Microsoft’s client OS includes deep integration with new core Metro user 
experiences, and many desktop-related improvements like a new File Explorer, a new 
Task Manager, a new file copy and move experience, and more. So even if you spend 
most of your day in the desktop, Windows 8 will be a useful and desirable upgrade.

With its brand-new Metro interface, you won’t be surprised  
to discover that there are new ways in which to customize Windows 8 to work the way 
you want it to. Aside from the app-specific tweaks we discuss throughout this book, 
Windows 8 provides an entirely new PC Settings interface for customizing many Metro- 
and system-level features; new personalization features for the lock screen, Start 
screen, and app tiles; and more.
And customizing Windows 8 is not just about Metro. As with previous versions of  
Windows, this OS also provides a number of ways in which you can customize the Windows 
desktop, including useful new multi-monitor capabilities that will be valuable in a number 
of usage scenarios, especially for those who pick up a new Windows 8 (or RT) tablet and 
decide to dock it to a larger display—and a keyboard and mouse—at home or at work.

146
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
Rounding out the Windows 8 customization capabilities are a handful of ways in 
which you can make the Metro and desktop environments interact a bit more seamlessly 
with each other. Ultimately, the goal here is to help you make Windows 8 work the way 
you want it to.
Customizing Metro
When it comes to customizing the Metro user experience, you’ll be spending much, 
but not all, of your time in the new PC Settings, a Metro-based interface that partially 
replaces—augments, really—the old Control Panel interface from older Windows versions.
The easiest way to access PC Settings will depend on the type of PC or device 
you’re using and whether you prefer to use the keyboard, mouse, or touch screen.
Keyboard: 
3
3
Those who prefer keyboard shortcuts should remember the Win-
key + I shortcut, which displays the Settings pane from anywhere in Win-
dows 8. This pane, shown in Figure 5-1, provides two areas: a top area that is 
context-sensitive to the experience—Start screen, desktop, or Metro-style 
app—you’re currently viewing and a bottom area that is global, and thus the 
same everywhere. That is, the top area will look different depending on what 
you’re doing at the time, whereas the bottom area will always look the same.
 
Figure 5-1: The Settings pane

147
Customizing Metro
Here, you’re concerned with the bottom area. Below the grid of system icons, 
you’ll see a link titled Change PC settings. Select that to access PC Settings.
Mouse and touch: 
3
3
Those with a touch screen, or those who prefer to the use 
the mouse, will find that accessing the Charms bar, as shown in Figure 5-2, 
and then Settings, will be the easiest route. Then, from Settings, click the 
link Change PC settings.
 
Figure 5-2: You can get to Settings and 
then PC Settings from the Charms bar.
Accessing the Charms bar, of course, varies a bit between the two interfaces. For 
touch, simply swipe in from the right edge of the screen. With a mouse, you need 
to move the mouse cursor into the upper- or lower-right corner of the screen and 
then move the cursor along the right edge of the screen toward the center-right 
edge of the screen; as you do, the Charms bar will appear.
However you access it, the PC Settings interface should resemble Figure 5-3.
OK, got your bearings? Good; let’s go customize the Metro interfaces in Windows 8!

Customizing the Lock Screen
In Windows 8, the lock screen has taken on renewed importance and it now works much 
like the lock screen on Windows Phone handsets. This is by design: While users of tradi-
tional PCs will be a tad uninterested in the lock screen, the success of Windows 8 hinges 
in part on a new generation of iPad-like tablets and other nontraditional devices. And 
on these machines, the lock screen can behave as a nice “glance and go” front end to 
the time and date and your daily activities, with a favorite photo as the backdrop.
The lock screen is customized in PC Settings, Personalize, Lock screen. Since 
this is the default view in PC Settings, you won’t have to do much navigating unless 
you’ve previously used PC Settings for some other purpose.
There are three basic lock screen features you can customize in PC Settings: the 
background picture, which apps can run in the background while the PC is locked and 
provide simple status updates via the lock screen, and which app can run in the back-
ground while the PC is locked and provide detailed status updates.
Background picture:

If you click or tap the Browse button, you can use a 
standard Metro-style File Picker interface to find a favorite photo and use 
that as the lock screen’s background. If you’re not familiar with this interface, 
shown in Figure 5-4, note that it can be used to find pictures not just on your 
local PC, but also via an online service for which you’ve installed a compat-
ible app. For example, installing the SkyDrive app lets you navigate your 
SkyDrive-based storage as well.

The lock screen can be configured 
with up to seven notification icons that provide simple status updates from your 
favorite apps. Not all Metro-style apps support this functionality, so you can tap 
an empty square (denoted by the “+” sign) to see which apps are available, as

Generally speaking, it makes sense to configure icons for apps like Mail, which 
will show you how many new e‑mail messages you’ve received, and Messaging, 
which will likewise show you how many instant messages you’ve missed.
Lock screen app with detailed status updates:

While the seven notification 
icons noted previously are somewhat useful, Windows 8 also provides for a 
single app to provide you with more detailed status updates.
Of course, you may not be a fan of the lock screen, and this will be especially true 
of the many, many people using Windows 8 on a traditional desktop PC. If this is the 
case, you can simply disable the lock screen.
To disable the lock screen, you’ll need to run the Local Group Policy Editor, an 
old-school management interface that’s been in Windows for years but hidden so 
that normal users don’t stumble across it by mistake. To find the Local Group Policy 
Editor, use Start Search, and search for gpedit.msc; it will pop up in the Apps list and 
resemble Figure 5-6 when running.
In the leftmost pane of this console, navigate to Computer Configuration, 
Administrative Templates, Control Panel, and then Personalization. When you do, 
the application will resemble Figure 5-7.
Double-click the entry titled “Do not display the lock screen” and then select 
Enabled in the window that appears. Click OK to close that window, and then close 
the Local Group Policy Editor. The change will take effect immediately.
 
Figure 5-6: Local Group Policy Editor
We typically

choose Calendar 
for this purpose, 
as it will provide 
information about 
the next scheduled 
event right on the 
lock screen. But 
other apps can be 
useful this way, 
too, like Weather.

Figure 5-7: There it is: a way to disable the lock screen.
Now, when you restart the PC, you’ll bypass the lock screen entirely and be pre-
sented with the sign-in screen instead. Likewise, when you lock the PC (Winkey + L), 
you’ll go immediately to the sign-in screen, not the lock screen.
Customizing the Start Screen
The Start screen is unique for many reasons. As the new default user interface for 
Windows 8 and the place by which you will launch and, via their live tile updates, 
monitor your running apps, it’s the central dashboard that many users will face, 
literally, each day. Not surprisingly, it offers a number of useful customizations. 
Oddly, however, these customizations can occur through two interfaces. That is, 
some of the customizations occur through PC Settings, as with other Metro features. 
But some occur directly from within the Start screen itself.
Changing the Start Screen Theme
If you navigate to PC Settings, Personalize, Start screen, you’ll see the interface 
shown in Figure 5-8. From here, you can choose the theme that is applied to the Start 
screen, a combination of background pattern, accent color, and background color.
If you’re not a fan of the background patterns, you can thankfully choose no 
pattern, which is the final square in the grid of pattern squares. What you can’t 
do is choose an arbitrary combination of accent and background colors. Instead, 

152
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
Microsoft has chosen combinations that it thinks work well together. For example, 
if you like a dark purple background color, your only accent color options are two 
shades of light purple. You’ll find that the gray backgrounds tend to have the most 
accent color choices for whatever reason.
 
Figure 5-8: Start screen theme selection
Determining Which Tiles Appear on the Start Screen
Windows 8 ships with a default selection of live tiles, and of course PC makers can add 
their own. And as you install Metro-style apps and traditional Windows applications, 
more tiles will be added to the Start screen so that, over time, it becomes a mess of 
useful and non-useful tiles alike. Fortunately, you can configure which tiles appear 
on the Start screen.
Remove a tile: 
3
3
To remove a tile, you must first select it. This is most easily done 
with a mouse, where a simple right-click is all that’s required. But it can be 
done via touch, of course, and far less easily via the keyboard, too. With touch, 
you must perform a short downward swipe on the tile to select it. With the key-
board, use the arrow keys to navigate to the tile in question—you’ll see a selec-
tion rectangle as you go—and then press the spacebar on the appropriate tile.
However you do it, when you select a tile on the Start screen, you will see that 
an app bar like the one in Figure 5-9 appears. This bar includes an Unpin from 
Start button: Just select that option to remove the tile.

153
Customizing Metro
 
Figure 5-9: Selecting a tile on the Start screen
You can also select multiple tiles at once. To do so, simply select one tile and 
then perform the same selection action—based on whichever input type you 
prefer—on other tiles in sequence. You can arbitrarily select as many tiles as 
you’d like and then unpin them all at once.
Add a tile:
3
3
 You can also add a tile to the Start screen. There are two methods 
for doing so.
From the Start screen, you can search for the item you wish to pin. To do so, 
just start typing and Start Search will appear. For example, if you wish to pin 
WordPad to the Start screen, type wordpad in Start Search. Then, as shown 
in Figure 5-10, right-click (or otherwise select) WordPad in the search results 
and choose Pin to Start.
 
Figure 5-10: Pinning a new application or app to the Start screen
Various items

can be pinned to 
the Start screen, 
such as Metro-
style apps; Windows 
desktop applications; 
File Explorer and 
various Explorer-
based locations, 
including folders, 
libraries, and the like; 
and websites.

154
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
You can also pin some items from the Windows desktop environment. Some 
desktop icons—like Recycle Bin, Computer, Network, and similar—can be 
pinned: Just right-click one on the desktop and choose Pin to Start. You can 
do the same for libraries, the homegroup, and various folders from within File 
Explorer as well. For example, in Figure 5-11, you can see that Pin to Start is an 
option when you right-click any location in the Explorer navigation bar.
 
Figure 5-11: Pinning from the desktop
Arranging and Grouping Tiles on the Start Screen
Adding and removing tiles is nice, but of course most people will also want to arrange 
tiles on the Start screen so that they appear in the order they prefer. This is obviously 
possible, as is the ability to group icons into visually segregated groups.
To move a tile’s location, simply select it with the mouse or, on a touch screen device, 
with your finger and drag it around on the screen. As you can see in Figure 5-12, as you do 
so, tiles will part and redistribute intelligently to accommodate the tile you’re moving.
 
Figure 5-12: Rearranging the tiles layout on the Start screen

155
Customizing Metro
You can also group Start screen tiles. To create a new group, select a tile and move 
it to the far left or right of the current group until you see a new group bar appear as in 
Figure 5-13; this is your indication that dropping the tile there will create a new group.
 
Figure 5-13: Creating a new tile group
And when you do release the tile, you can see that it’s by itself in a new group (Fig-
ure 5-14). Now you can just move other tiles into that group as you would normally.
 
Figure 5-14: A lonely tile group of one

156
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
TIP ​ ​How you arrange and group tiles is of course up to you, but many people 
like to group them logically, with media apps (Music, Video, and so on) together 
in one group, productivity apps in another, and so on.
You can also move and even name groups. To do so, you need to take advantage 
of a cool Metro feature called semantic zoom which lets you visually zoom the entire 
Start screen so you can see the whole layout at once in a kind of thumbnail view.
You can enable semantic view most easily via touch or mouse. With touch, simply 
pinch the Start screen. As you do, the tiles will visually shrink until they’re a small 
group of thumbnails as in Figure 5-15.
 
Figure 5-15: Semantic zoom
With a mouse, move the mouse cursor in the lower-right corner of the screen and 
click the tiny semantic zoom button, which can be seen in Figure 5-16. This tiny button 
will immediately place the screen into semantic zoom view as well.
 
Figure 5-16: It’s easy to miss,  
but this button will display the  
Start screen with semantic zoom.

157
Customizing Metro
There are two basic actions you can perform in this view.
First, you can arrange groups. To do so, simply select a group—using the same 
3
3
methods that are used to select an individual tile—and then drag it around 
the thumbnail view of the Start screen, positioning it where you want, as in 
Figure 5-17.
 
Figure 5-17: Rearranging the layout of  
tile groups
Second, you can optionally name each tile group. To do this, select the group 
3
3
you wish to name while in semantic view—again, using the same selection 
technique you learned for tiles—and then tap the Name group app bar button 
that appears. It will provide a text box for you to type the name. And when you 
are done, the group name will appear over the top-left area of the group, as 
shown in Figure 5-18.
 
Figure 5-18: A named tile group

158
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
To exit semantic zoom, use the stretch gesture (a sort of “reverse pinch”) on a 
touch-based screen. Or, with a more traditional PC, type Esc or click on any empty 
spot on the screen.
Customizing Individual Start Screen Tiles
Looking at your Start screen, you’ve probably noticed that the tiles are two different 
sizes. There are large rectangular tiles and then smaller, square tiles. This raises a 
few questions, but key among them is whether it’s possible to customize individual 
tiles so that they are one or the other size. It depends.
Tiles that represent Metro-style apps can support both tile sizes. And most do, 
though it’s not a requirement. So you may occasionally run into a Metro-style app 
that offers only one tile size. But in either large or small variants, these tiles can 
optionally be live, offering app-related updates graphically or textually.
Tiles that represent websites, traditional Windows applications, or Explorer loca-
tions support only the smaller, square tile size. These types of tiles are not live: They 
provide the name of the app or experience only, and some icon. That’s it.
You can customize a live tile in the following ways:
Make it bigger/smaller: 
3
3
A large rectangular tile can be resized to be a smaller, 
square tile if you’d like. Likewise, a smaller, square tile can be resized as a 
larger, rectangular tile. Doing so will generally impact the amount of informa-
tion displayed by a live tile, though the exact change will differ from app to 
app, depending on how it was created. In Figure 5-19, you can see different 
versions of the same live tile, one large and one small.
 
Figure 5-19: The same tile in its two supported size  
configurations
Turn live tile on/off: 
3
3
While some will really appreciate the constantly updat-
ing live tiles on a typical Windows 8 Start screen, others will find it distract-
ing or even annoying. There are two things you can try to cut down on the 
noise if you’re in the latter group. First, you can experiment with resizing the 
tiles from large to small, since those smaller tiles—while still “live”—tend to 

159
Customizing Metro
be less dynamic than their larger versions. But if you just want it to stop, you 
can also turn off live updating on a tile-by-tile basis. And this works for large 
as well as small tiles. In Figure 5-20, you can see the effect this has on a typi-
cal app tile.
 
Figure 5-20: Same tile with live updates on (left) and off (right)
To perform either of the preceding customizations, select the tile in question and 
then choose the appropriate app bar button as shown in Figure 5-21.
 
Figure 5-21: Tile options in the app bar
Customizing User Accounts
While we dedicate a large chunk of Chapter 12 to user accounts, it’s worth mention-
ing here that PC Settings is also the home for most user account customizations as 
well. There are two basic interfaces: one for your user account picture and then a 
more general Users settings area that lets you configure other aspects of your account 
and other user accounts. (And no, we don’t know why these two things are separate.)
Changing Your Account Picture
To change your user account picture, navigate to PC Settings, Personalize, Account 
picture. Or, select Change account picture from the Start screen-based user tile in the 
upper-right corner of that screen. Either way, you’ll be presented with the screen in 
Figure 5-22.
You can’t 
3
3
customize the color 
of a tile, which is 
designated by the 
app’s creator and 
cannot be modified. 
Still, some apps let 
you customize the  
tile face in some  
ways. For example,  
the Photos app lets  
you apply a favorite 
picture as the  
tile face.

160
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
 
Figure 5-22: Account picture settings
Using this interface is pretty straightforward. The Browse button lets you find a 
picture on your PC or elsewhere using a standard Metro-style File Picker. The Camera 
tile lets you capture a still image using the Camera app. (And you can see other apps 
listed there as well, of course.)
If you sign in with a Microsoft account as we recommend, note that changing this 
account picture will also change the account picture associated with your online 
account. Likewise, if you change your Microsoft account picture elsewhere—such as 
on the web—it will change the image you see here in Windows 8 as well.
Changing Other Account Settings
Other settings related to your user account, and other accounts that are (or will be) 
configured on this PC can be found in PC Settings, Users (Figure 5-23).
Here, you can change your password, associate a PIN or picture password with 
your account, add other users, switch your account between a local and Micro-
soft account type and, if you’re signing in with a domain account, connect that 
account to your Microsoft account. (And these are in addition to other options, 
depending on how things are configured when you view this screen.) This is all 
covered in Chapter 12.

Other Customizations in PC Settings
The PC Settings interface provides an obvious and discoverable way to customize 
many aspects of Windows 8, so there’s no need to step through every conceivable 
option. That said, there are a few you may want to pay special attention to. And these 
are as follows:
Notifications: 
3
3
As with live tiles, new Metro-style apps—including the ones 
that come with Windows 8—can provide floating notification toasts to alert 
you when something happens, such as an e‑mail arriving (Mail), a new 
instant message (Messaging), or a pending appointment (Calendar). But like 
live tiles, these notifications can get a bit chatty and depending on your 
needs and temperament, you may want to turn them off or determine whether 
individual apps can even use notifications. Notifications can be configured in 
PC Settings, Notifications.
Devices.

 You can rename certain types of devices—Xbox 360 consoles and 
DLNA-compatible set top boxes, both of which you may want to use with the

notification sounds. 
Now that gets 
annoying.

Xbox Music and Xbox Video apps in Windows 8—by selecting them in the 
Devices view and typing a new name. That way, when you select them from the 
Devices pane, they’ll have names that make sense to you, and not names like 
WDTVLiveHub.
Ease of Access: 
3

While Windows 7’s excellent accessibility tools have been 
updated only somewhat in Windows 8, this new OS does of course have a new 
Metro environment to deal with as well. So you will find some interesting 
accessibility features in PC Settings under Ease of Access. Key among them 
are the high contrast mode, which works in both Metro and the desktop, and 
the Winkey + Volume Up shortcut, which can be used to toggle Magnifier,  
Narrator (the default), the onscreen keyboard, or nothing.
Sync your settings: 
3
3
This is the most important set of settings, arguably, in PC 
Settings and is directly tied to why signing in with a Microsoft account is such 
a big deal. This one is important enough that we describe it in the next section 
of this chapter, “Customizing Settings and Settings Sync.”
Windows Update: 
3
3
While there is still a control panel-based Windows Update 
in Windows 8, it’s a bit hard to find and not the primary interface for Micro-
soft’s software updating service. Now, the new, Metro-style front end to 
Windows Update can be found in PC Settings, Windows Update. As you can 
see in Figure 5-24, this interface is simple and obvious.

might be of 
interest to any

unwieldy, with

Customizing Settings and Settings Sync
In PC Settings, Sync your settings, you will find a long but surprisingly incomplete 
list of the groups of features that you can sync from PC to PC if you sign in with a 
Microsoft account. You can see this interface in Figure 5-25.
 
Figure 5-25: Sync your settings
While signing in with a Microsoft account is enough to trigger the synchroniza-
tion of most settings between the current PC and your other machines, one settings 
group—for Passwords, as shown in Figure 5-26—won’t be synced until you make the 
current PC a “trusted PC.”
 
Figure 5-26: Passwords won’t sync unless your current PC is a trusted PC.
Indeed, this 
3
3
list of features—as 
well as those that 
are inexplicably not 
noted in this UI—is 
collectively the single 
best reason to sign in 
to Windows 8 with a 
Microsoft account.

164
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
You may have already made your PC a trusted PC, by the way: At the end of Setup, 
you’re prompted to provide a mobile phone number as part of the security verification 
info. Doing so causes Microsoft to send that number a text message with an embed-
ded hyperlink that, when tapped, verifies the Windows install and makes that PC a 
trusted PC. Likewise, you should have received an e‑mail to this effect at the time 
you set up Windows as well. Like the text message, this e‑mail contains a hyperlink 
that lets you mark the PC as a trusted PC.
If you didn’t perform either of these actions earlier, you can enable password 
syncing by tapping the Trust this PC link provided in PC Settings. This will launch 
your default browser and navigate to account.live.com/p, where you can click a 
Confirm link to make the current PC a trusted PC.
With that out of the way, you can examine the entire list of settings groups, each 
of which can be enabled for syncing or not. Microsoft is nice enough to list some of 
the features that are synced with each group, but not all of them. That’s where we 
come in: In the list that follows you’ll find a much more complete list of the features 
that get synced with each group.

: This settings group concerns settings related to Start screen, 
lock screen, and user tile personalization. But it also syncs two other very 
useful settings. First, as described earlier in this chapter, it’s possible to indi-
vidually configure app tiles to provide live information or not; this settings 
group determines whether those customizations are synced. And second, it 
includes file type associations: If you configure, say, Windows Reader to open 
PDF files on one PC, it will be auto-selected as the default app for that file type 
across your PCs.
Desktop personalization: 
3

As its name suggests, this settings group relates 
to some Windows desktop settings (but not all; see the related Other Windows 
settings group later in the list). Chief among these is the desktop theme (as 
configured in the Personalization control panel), which includes the desktop 
background, the Explorer window color, sounds, and screen saver. But it also 
includes taskbar customizations (including which edge of the screen to which 
the taskbar is connected) and desktop-based photo slideshow (triggered from 
the Explorer shell or Windows Photo Viewer) customizations.

As you may expect, this settings group includes all of the

Language preferences:

Here, you’ll find settings such as the display language, 
additional installed languages and input methods (IMEs), and settings related 
to the onscreen keyboard. But there’s another important setting that’s synced 
via this group: The new Windows spelling dictionary, which can work from any 
Metro-style app.
App settings:
3
3
 This settings group curiously notes that it will sync “certain 
settings in your apps.” That’s a bit of a stretch as installed Metro-style apps 
can actually participate in Microsoft account-based PC-to-PC sync on their 
own. Instead, this settings group is really related to Windows Store-purchased 
app information.
Browser: 
3

This settings group encompasses a wide range of Internet Explorer 
settings, including browser history, Favorites, homepage, Tracking Protection, 
domain suggestions, and more.

This settings group, strangely separated from Desktop 
personalization, incudes settings related to two specific desktop features: File

your settings are synced over metered Internet connections.

the previous settings, but on a more expensive roaming connection. This is 
disabled by default.
As noted previously, each Metro-style app you install can optionally use your 
Microsoft account to sync its own settings from PC to PC, and some apps will provide 
their own granular control over this and other features. Check the app’s settings—
through the Settings charm, or Winkey + I—from within the app itself to see whether 
this functionality is available.

Customizing the Desktop
If you’re familiar with Windows 7 or previous Windows versions, many of the same 
customization options that were available before are also available in Windows 8.  
As is the case throughout this book, however, we’ll be focusing only on those aspects 
of the system that are new or at least notably changed in this release. And believe it 
or not, there have been some interesting improvements to desktop customization in 
Windows 8 despite the obvious focus on the new Metro environment in this release.
Automatic Explorer Window Color
With Windows 8, Microsoft has removed the translucent glass effects of Windows Aero 
and replaced it with a more opaque and flat new Explorer desktop theme. But that 
doesn’t mean you can’t customize the look of the desktop to your heart’s content.
For example, in Windows Vista and 7, you could configure the color of the trans-
parent or “glass” parts of File Explorer windows (and, in Windows 7, the taskbar) to 
match the underlying desktop background. So if you set up your desktop to cycle 
through a favorite set of photos from a recent trip to Ireland, for example, you might 
change the window color to a pleasant green to match.
This capability was nice, and of course you could save background and window 
color combinations as desktop themes. But it was a bit tedious if you changed back-
grounds regularly, or used a dynamic theme like those provided by Bing that changes 
background pictures on a schedule. So in Windows 8, there’s a new option that will 
automatically change the File Explorer window and taskbar color to match the desk-
top background. You will see this option in the Color and Appearance control panel 
shown in Figure 5-27.
Of course, you have to find it first. You can find Windows Color and Appearance 
much as you did in Windows 7: Right-click the desktop, choose Personalize, and 
then click Color in the resulting window. Or, you can get there directly—and more 
quickly—from Start Search: Simply search for window color and look under Settings.

167
Customizing the Desktop
 
Figure 5-27: A new automatic window color option will keep your windows and  
taskbar in sync with the desktop background.
Make Items Bigger
While Windows 7 included a display scaling feature that made it a snap to enlarge the 
appearance of all desktop items using percentages like 125 percent and 150 percent, 
Windows 8 goes a step further by providing a new interface for just increasing the 
text size for specific items. It’s also found in the Display control panel, which can be 
accessed in a variety of ways, though the easiest is Start Search: Search for display 
and then select Display from the search results.
In the Change only the text size section of the Display control panel, you can select 
individual desktop UI elements—Title bars, Menus, Message boxes, Palette titles, Icons, 
and Tooltips—and provide them with custom sizes, as seen in Figure 5-28.

Metro-Style Apps on Netbooks: A Workaround
If you want to run Metro-style apps on your Netbook, there is a fix, as it turns out.  
But be warned that modifying a Windows 8 install to allow Metro-style apps to run will 
cause the desktop environment look a bit skewed, or squished. But if your goal is to 
enjoy Metro, this will do the trick.
Run the Registry Editor, Regedit (Start Search, regedit), and search for the term 
display1_downscalingsupported (using Ctrl + F). Find each instance of this entry and 
change its value from 0 to 1. (Use F3 to repeat the previous search.) Do this until 
you’ve found them all, close Regedit, and reboot.
You will now have additional resolution options, such as1024 × 768 and 1152 × 864. 
If you do have multiple resolution choices, try each (that’s above 1024 x 600) to see 
which looks best. But either way, Metro apps will now work. 

169
Customizing the Desktop
More Efficient Multi-Monitor
While previous versions of Windows offered only basic multi-monitor capabilities, 
Windows 8 addresses past issues and adds some unique new features that let you 
customize how you can view the Metro and desktop environments side by side on 
multiple displays.
NO TE ​ ​First, a general rule: While it’s possible to span your desktop across 
multiple displays, the Metro environment can only appear on a single screen. So 
if you have a four-monitor system for some reason—perhaps you’re James Bond 
or are a little too excited about flight simulator games—you can have this setup 
configured in one of two basic ways: one screen showing Metro and three show-
ing the desktop, or all four screens showing the desktop.
Given this limitation, let’s look at some of the ways in which you can configure 
your PC for multi-monitor use in Windows 8.
Basic Multi-Monitor Configuration
There are two interfaces you will use to configure a multi-monitor setup. The most basic 
is the Metro-based Second Screen pane, which replaces the old “presentation” mode 
from previous Windows versions. You can access this screen, shown in Figure 5-29, in 
several ways.
 
Figure 5-29: The Second Screen pane

170
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
The simplest, we think, is to use the Winkey + P (where P = “presentation”) key-
board shortcut. However, you can also find this interface via touch or mouse by dis-
playing the Charms bar and choosing Devices and then Second Screen.
While it is clearly aimed at those who need to project a presentation to a secondary 
screen or projector, the Second Screen pane will meet the needs of many users who have 
two screens attached to their PC, including laptop or tablet users who dock their device 
at home or work in order to use a larger screen.
This pane lets you configure the screens as follows:
PC screen only:
3
3
 In this mode, the second screen is simply ignored and only 
the PC’s primary display is used.
Duplicate: 
3
3
In this mode, the second screen duplicates, or mirrors, the primary 
display. There are some limitations here based on the capabilities of the screen. 
For example, the mirrored screens will both utilize the resolution of the lowest 
resolution screen of the pair. This is a common choice for those giving presenta-
tions who wish to see the same display as the audience.
Extend:

In this mode, the PC display is extended across the two screens. This 
common configuration allows you to have a desktop that spans two screens or 
a configuration in which you use Metro on one screen and the desktop on the 
other. Unlike with Duplicate, each display will use its own native resolution. 
Presenters can also utilize this mode with the Presenter mode in recent versions 
of Microsoft PowerPoint.
Second screen only:

Here, the main PC display (on a laptop or tablet, the 
display that’s built into the device) will be disabled and only the secondary 
screen is used. This is a common choice for those with portable computers 
who wish to use a docked display, keyboard, and mouse while not moving 
around.
More Advanced Multi-Monitor Configuration
The Second Screen interface is fine for basic usage, but if you have more than two 
screens or need to configure how the screens work, you’ll need more control. And 
that comes via a legacy control panel called Screen Resolution. Shown in Figure 5-30, 
this control panel can be accessed by right-clicking the desktop and choosing Screen 
Resolution, or via Start Search (screen resolution).

171
Customizing the Desktop
A number of configuration options are available here, including the following:
Visual positioning and orientation of the displays: 
3
3
You can move the graphi-
cal representations of the displays in the window to approximate how the 
physical displays they represent are in fact oriented in real life (Figure 5-31). 
Because you will need to move the mouse cursor from screen to screen, it 
makes sense to line up the displays so that they work onscreen as they do in 
real life.
You may recall that Windows 8 utilizes the corners of the primary screen as 
“hot corners,” which are required by Metro interfaces such as Back, Start, 
and Charms. Fortunately, Microsoft has configured Windows 8 such that if a 
corner of the primary display is lined up exactly with a corner of a secondary 
display, that corner will become “sticky,” and the mouse cursor will hard stop 
when it reaches such a corner. This feature prevents you from accidently over-
shooting the hot corner, moving the cursor to the next display, and missing 
out on the Metro feature you meant to trigger.

fine-grained control over multiple displays.
Of course,

anyone using a 
multi-monitor 
setup can probably 
remember a 
keyboard shortcut, 
too: Winkey + C.  
This shortcut opens 
the Charms bar so  
you don’t have to  
use the mouse.

Set screen resolutions:

Using the Resolution drop-down, you can ensure that 
the resolution of each display is set correctly to the optimal resolution (gener-
ally the highest possible resolution, or the display’s “native” resolution). Select 
a display in the graphical representation area first and then make sure the 
resolution is correct.
Orientation:
3
3
 You can choose between landscape, portrait, landscape (flipped) 
and portrait (flipped) orientations, which can be handy for those displays 
that can be rotated.
Multiple displays: 
3

This drop-down works much like the Second Screen pane 
described in the previous section. It lets you choose between the same four 
options, though they are annoyingly described somewhat differently: Duplicate 
these displays (Duplicate), Extend these displays (Extend), Show desktop only 
on 1 (PC screen only), and Show desktop only on 2 (Second screen only).
Fine-Tuning Multi-Monitor Configuration
OK, you’ve got your multiple displays configured and oriented the way you like. But 
what about the desktop wallpaper and taskbar? By default, Windows 8 will simply dupli-
cate both the wallpaper and taskbar across two or more displays, even if you’ve chosen 
the Extend view, which extends the desktop across the multiple displays. Wouldn’t it be 
nice if you could extend a panoramic wallpaper across the displays, or use a different 
picture for each display? And what about having the taskbar be unique to each display 
so that, say, the taskbar on the second display only shows buttons for the windows that 
are actually open on that display?
Yep, you guessed it. You can configure how each of these features works, too.
Configuring the Desktop Background to Span Multiple Displays
To configure the desktop background for multiple displays, you will use the Desk-
top Background control panel, which is accessible through the Personalize control 
panel (right-click the desktop, Personalize, and then Desktop Background) or 

173
Customizing the Desktop
directly from Start Search (desktop background). In this interface, shown in Fig-
ure 5-32, you can click the Picture location drop-down to choose between a variety 
of background types.
The Span option lets you span a single image across multiple displays. This 
works best, of course, with panoramic images, and while you’re free to make your 
own, Microsoft is stepping up by providing panoramic wallpapers (and even desktop 
themes, which also include other unique configurations) that are designed specifi-
cally for this use.
Some are included in Windows 8. To see what’s available, select Windows Desk-
top Backgrounds from the Picture location drop-down near the top of this window. 
There, you’ll find a few panoramic options that, when selected, span nicely across 
two displays as in Figure 5-33.
 
Figure 5-32: Desktop Background control panel
 
Figure 5-33: With a panoramic background picture, you can create a  
seamless display across multiple monitors.

174
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
Be sure to select Span from the Picture position drop-down as well to see the 
effect correctly. It also helps if the displays are lined up properly, since otherwise the 
picture will stagger from screen to screen.
Note that Microsoft is also making panoramic wallpapers and themes available 
from its Windows Personalization Gallery website at windows.microsoft.com/en-US/
windows/downloads/personalize. This collection is updated regularly, so be sure to 
check it out from time to time.
Configuring a Different Background Picture for Each Display
Another choice is to use a different background picture for each display. This is 
absolutely possible in Windows 8, though it’s not particularly obvious.
To do so, navigate to the Desktop Background control panel. (Again, via Person-
alize and then Desktop Background or from Start Search, with desktop background). 
Select a (picture) location from the Picture location drop-down list and then select 
the picture you want for the first display. Then, right-click that picture and choose 
Set for monitor 1, as shown in Figure 5-34.
 
Figure 5-34: Specifying a  
background picture for the  
first display only
Then, find the picture you want for the second display, right-click it, and choose 
Set for monitor 2. Repeat as necessary for further displays.
Configuring the Taskbar for Multiple Displays
By default, the taskbar will duplicate on each display even if you’ve chosen the 
Extend option. But you can change this so that the taskbar on each screen is  
specific to that screen. To do so, right-click an empty area of the taskbar (any 
screen will do) and choose Properties. You’ll see the Taskbar Properties window 
shown in Figure 5-35.
In case it’s not 
3

obvious, all desktop 
themes designed 
for Windows 7 still 
work the same with 
Windows 8, too.

Customizing the Desktop
There are four possible configurations for the taskbar on a PC with multiple displays:
Duplicated across all displays: 
3
3
By default, the same taskbar will appear on all 
displays and its collection of buttons will be duplicated on each. That is, the 
taskbar on each display will be identical.
Taskbar only on the primary display: 
3
3
If you’d like to display the taskbar only 
on the primary display, uncheck the option titled Show taskbar on all displays 
in Taskbar Properties. This will eliminate the taskbar on all secondary dis-
plays, and display it only on the first, or primary, display.
 
Figure 5-35: New to Taskbar Properties:  
a way to control how the taskbar works with  
multiple displays
A unique taskbar on each display: 
3

If you’d prefer to have a taskbar on each 
display but would like each to hold buttons (shortcuts for running and non-
running programs) that are specific only to that display, choose “Taskbar 
where window is open” from the Show taskbar buttons on drop-down. In this 
configuration, the secondary displays will only display buttons for windows 
and applications that are open on that screen.
A unique taskbar on each display, but all open windows available on pri-

mary display, too: This most confusing of options is basically identical to the 
previous configuration, but with a twist: Open windows and applications will 
display a button on the taskbar of both the display they’re open on as well as 
the primary display.

Configuring Metro for Multiple Displays
You may recall that you can only use the Metro environment on one display. The 
question is: Which display?
As it turns out, there’s no user interface for specifying which display is used for 
Metro, and of course it uses the primary display, or what’s sometimes referred to as 
Monitor 1, by default. You can, however, change which display Metro uses. As is so 
often the case, you just need to know the trick.
To switch Metro from the primary display to a secondary display, you need to 
launch any Metro-style app. That is, you cannot do this from the Start screen. Once 
you have a Metro-style app running, “grab” the top of the app via touch or mouse—
the cursor will change into a gloved hand cursor if you’re using the mouse—and then 
drag the app to the display you prefer.
To the Cloud! Do More with Libraries
When it comes to libraries, Windows 8 works much like Windows 7, with the 
only major difference being that the new ribbon-based File Explorer exposes 
library options and configurations in a much more obvious way, as you can see in 
Figure 5-36.
 
Figure 5-36: The easier-to-find Library management features in Windows 8
The only issue 
3
3
with this tip is that 
it’s not persistent 
across reboots. 
Metro will stay on 
the secondary display 
until you reboot, but 
once you do, you’ll  
need to perform 
this drag-and-drop 
operation again.

177
Customizing the Desktop
As before, you can configure which physical folders are used to populate indi-
vidual libraries and you can, as before, make your own libraries, too. What’s different 
in Windows 8 is that Microsoft is now providing SkyDrive apps for both the Metro and 
desktop environments (though only the former is available “in the box” with the OS). 
This means you can now access and use cloud-based SkyDrive storage as if it were 
part of your PC’s hard drive, including with libraries.
Once you’ve downloaded and installed the SkyDrive application for Windows 
(apps.live.com/skydrive), it will sync the contents of your SkyDrive cloud storage to 
the location on your PC that you configured. Then, you can access your SkyDrive stor-
age as you do with any other storage that’s attached to your hard drive.
To add a SkyDrive-based folder to a library, simply right-click it in Explorer, as 
shown in Figure 5-37, and select Include in library and then the name of the library 
you prefer.
 
Figure 5-37: Adding a SkyDrive folder to a library
Then, you can even optionally make that cloud-based folder the default save 
location. To do so, open the library in question in Explorer and then select Set Save 
Location from the Library Tools – Manage tab in the ribbon. Voila! Now you have a file 
store that is replicated to the web and will survive a hard drive failure or operating 
system reinstall.
TIP ​ ​This tip works with other cloud providers, too. For example, Google pro-
vides a Google Drive app that lets you access its cloud-based storage natively 
from File Explorer as well. If you use this service instead of SkyDrive, you could 
of course add Google Drive-based folders to your libraries instead. You can 
download Google Drive for Windows from the Google website: tools.google 
.com/dlpage/drive.
The SkyDrive 
3
3
app for Windows 
caches the contents 
your SkyDrive cloud 
storage to the hard 
drive so that it’s 
available when your 
PC is offline, too.

178
C h a p t e r  5    Make It Yours: Personalizing Windows 8
You could also take this tip to its logical conclusion and replace the default 
library locations with locations in SkyDrive. For example, you could create a Docu-
ments folder inside of SkyDrive, add it to the Documents library, and then remove 
the My Documents and Public Documents folders from the Documents library. Now 
a cloud-based folder will be your default save location for all of your documents and 
will be automatically replicated from PC to PC, and to the cloud.
Power User Customization Tips and Tricks
While personalizing the Metro and desktop environments is useful, we’re particu-
larly taken with customization tips that make the PC work the way you do. And with 
Windows 8, reaching that happy middle ground can be a bit more daunting since the 
new Metro environment isn’t naturally efficient for power users, while the old-school 
desktop environment isn’t necessarily a happy site for those less sophisticated users 
with tablets who would prefer to stick with Metro. (We’re told those people exist. Bear 
with us.)
Here are a few tips for spanning the otherwise separate worlds of Metro and the 
desktop.
Easing the Transition Between Metro and the  
Desktop . . . with Wallpaper
If you’ve bet big on Metro and would like to stay out of the desktop environment as 
much as possible, you of course have our best wishes. And you can of course start 
by removing the tiles for the Desktop and any other desktop applications (like File 
Explorer) that may exist on your Start Screen. Good luck, seriously.
But anyone who uses Windows 8 will need to deal with the desktop from time to 
time, simply because Metro is an incomplete environment that doesn’t offer all of 
the functionality that’s present in the desktop. How could it? The Windows desktop 
is the result of over 15 years of improvements and tweaks, while the Metro environ-
ment is a 1.0 release. It’s nice, sure. But it’s always going to offer just a subset of the 
features you get in the desktop.
With that in mind, you can blunt the visually jarring effect that occurs when you 
switch between any Metro-based screen and the desktop by duplicating the Start 
screen background as your desktop background. There’s no automated way to do this, 
but if you know the trick (and don’t change your background too often), you can make 
it happen.
This makes us 
3

wonder whether 
Windows 9 will 
feature some sort 
of cross-environment 
“themes” capability, 
since it’s such an 
obvious need.

Power User Customization Tips and Tricks
Here’s how.
	
1.	 First, configure the Start screen with the theme—colors and background 
pattern—you prefer, as described earlier in the chapter. Then, click the small 
icon in the lower-right corner of the screen to enable the semantic zoom fea-
ture on the desktop. This will cause the tile groups to shrink down, as shown 
in Figure 5-38.
 
Figure 5-38: Semantic zoom on the desktop
	
2.	 Now, take a screenshot by tapping the Prt Scn key on your keyboard. This cop-
ies the onscreen image to the Windows clipboard.
	
3.	 Now, run Paint (Start Search, paint) and paste the screenshot image into the 
application (using Ctrl + V). Use Paint’s magnification options to shrink the 
image a bit (using right-click) so that it resembles Figure 5-39.

Two more steps.
	
4.	 Next, you must select the background color of the Start screen as the back-
ground color in Paint. To do that, select the Color picker tool and then right-
click on a blank area of the background in the image. Then, cut out the tiles 
and the user tile with the Selection tool so that it resembles Figure 5-40.
 
Figure 5-40: The edited background in Paint
	
5.	 Now, save the image to your Pictures library. And, from the File menu in Paint, 
choose Set as desktop background. Once you do, your desktop wallpaper will be 
changed to this new image (Figure 5-41).
Now, as you switch back and forth between the Start screen and the desktop 
(test this by tapping Winkey) you can see that the background remains the same, 
creating a fairly seamless experience.

Summary
Summary
While Windows 8 provides most of the same customization and personalization func-
tionality from previous Windows versions, it also includes new capabilities. These 
extend from the expected Metro-based enhancements to new desktop customization 
features and, perhaps most interestingly, some features that make the Metro and 
desktop environments work better together. Now that you understand the basics of 
using both of these environments, and how to meld them to your needs, it’s time to 
learn more about the Metro apps that make Windows 8 so special.

With its Windows Store, Microsoft is following the app store  
model pioneered by Apple, sure, but it’s also providing a unique approach to what is now 
considered a key part of any new platform. This approach establishes the very important 
rules that all apps available from the store must follow, providing users with the assur-
ances they need to trust these apps. But it also plays into one of Windows 8’s greatest 
strengths as a platform: These apps aren’t just isolated islands of functionality, but they 
can also integrate deeply into the OS, extending the capabilities of Windows 8 well into 
the future.

184
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
As an app in its own right, Windows Store is beautiful to look at, easy to navigate, 
and a somewhat ideal way to discover, download, and manage Metro-style apps. It 
provides a rich environment with app categories and subcategories, lists of useful 
apps, app landing pages with detailed information, and an excellent set of feedback 
features that let you rate and review apps and other reviews.
This chapter examines Windows Store and how you can use this full-screen 
experience to find the apps that will matter most to you.
What Is an App Store . . . and Why 
Does Windows 8 Need One?
While many associate app stores with Apple, the truth is that Microsoft got there 
years earlier with offerings such as Xbox LIVE Marketplace, Windows Marketplace, 
and other services. But Apple’s begrudging entry into the app store space—remember, 
Apple originally wanted to keep the iPhone a closed system and only caved because 
of overwhelming customer pressure—ignited a revolution. To give the Cupertino 
consumer electronics giant credit where credit is due, Apple got its app store right, 
establishing rules for app submissions, purchasing, and management that are now 
essentially standard across the industry. Today, you can’t launch or maintain a mobile 
or computing platform of any kind without offering an associated app store as well.
The app store in Windows 8 is called Windows Store, and it’s modeled largely on the 
Windows Phone Marketplace, which Microsoft launched alongside its smartphone plat-
form in 2010. And as with its Windows Phone offering, Windows Store is just part of a 
wider ecosystem of services that includes other online stores as well. For example, Win-
dows 8 users may be interested in Microsoft’s Xbox Music and Xbox Video Marketplaces 
as well.
C ROSSREF  ​The Xbox Music and Video Marketplaces are discussed in Chapter 9.
OK, so Windows Store is the app store for Windows. That’s not a terrifically difficult 
concept, nor is the notion that Windows is supported by a surrounding ecosystem of 
related products and services. It’s always been this way, of course, and with Windows 7, 
for example, we discussed how related products and services like Bing, Windows Live, 
and Zune “complete” the Windows experience. This sort of thing is absolutely still true 
today, though some of the brands have changed. But with Windows Store and the Win-
dows 8 extensibility capabilities that its apps can take advantage of, things are a bit 
more nuanced today. They’re also terrifically more exciting.
The Music 
3
3
and Video 
Marketplaces 
were previously 
collectively branded 
as the Zune 
Marketplace. With 
Windows 8, that 
brand is being 
phased out and is 
being replaced by 
the Xbox brand 
instead.

185
What Is an App Store . . . and Why Does Windows 8 Need One?
Consider the way applications have always extended the capabilities of  
Windows. In the past you could purchase full-featured applications like Microsoft 
Word or Adobe Photoshop to meet certain needs, such as creating and editing 
word processing documents or graphics art projects, respectively. The integration 
these applications offered with the underlying OS (still do, in fact) was pretty 
much relegated to snagging file associations. So you might open .docx files in 
Word instead of the WordPad utility that shipped with Windows.
Smaller applications, or utilities, such as a Zip utility or an antivirus solution, 
often supplied similar integration capabilities that lit up capabilities through the 
Explorer shell.
At a basic level, these classic Windows applications make Windows better, some-
what generally, because they provide more capabilities than what is present solely in 
Windows. It’s fair to say that no one uses Windows because of Windows itself, per se, 
but rather because of the utility of the amazing collection of applications that are 
available for this system.
None of this changes with Windows 8. Microsoft and third-party developers big 
and small will continue making traditional desktop-based applications to enhance 
that part of the Windows experience.
What changes in Windows 8, however, is that developers are now shipping 
Metro-style apps in addition to traditional Windows applications. Yes, some of 
them will simply be immersive, full-screen replacements for existing Windows 
applications. You’ll see Metro-style word processors and graphics art apps, for 
example. But some will be much more than that.
Thanks to the extensibility features in Windows 8, developers can now create 
apps that make Windows 8 better in unique ways. In fact, they make Windows 8 
almost future-proof in the sense that they can provide functionality to the OS that 
its makers didn’t even know would one day be desirable.
Consider the Windows 8 share contract. Through this system-level service, apps 
can engage in two-way conversations without ever knowing what app is on the other 
side. The canonical example is sharing a web page via e‑mail: Internet Explorer 10 for 
Metro supports one part of this contract—the ability to share an item, in this case a 
web page, with another app—and the Mail app supports the other part—the ability to 
receive a share request. This is a powerful feature because it’s available to any Metro-
style apps, and developers never need to know anything about the app that is on the 
other side of the equation. It’s like copy and paste, but about a hundred times more 
powerful.
In a few years, some entrepreneur we’ve never heard of may launch a new online 
service we’ve never imagined. And while anyone could write a third-party app to 
Remember,

when we use the 
word app here, we 
are referring to 
Metro-style apps. 
Applications are 
traditional desktop 
applications.

186
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
support that service, with Windows 8, one could write an app that integrated with the 
OS’s unique extensibility features. So this new Metro-style app for this new service 
could accept a share request from Internet Explorer 10 just like Mail does, but then do 
something completely different with it.
This is a simple (and purposefully vague) example. But the point is simple: Thanks 
to the massive and pervasive improvements to the underlying platform in Windows 8, 
apps aren’t just something you install and use as standalone islands of activity. They 
will often be truly integrated experiences that make Windows 8 better. And that 
means that as time goes by, and more and more apps appear, Windows 8 is only going 
to get better. And it will do so even if Microsoft never lifts a finger to make that so.
Windows Store, then, isn’t just a way to find new apps. It’s a way to make Windows 8 
better. That’s just exciting.
First Rule of Windows Store: There 
Are Rules to Windows Store
If you’re a developer targeting Windows 8 with a new Metro-style app, you’ve got a 
lot of work ahead of you, not just in writing that app, but in conforming to a long list 
of app rules that Microsoft has devised. These rules exist for simple reasons: Metro-
style apps need to be safe, perform quickly, and work well, and they need to offer 
users a unique value of some kind.
For you, the Windows user, these rules are like the gold standard, ensuring that 
all of the apps you find on Windows Store—you know, the apps that are going to make 
Windows 8 better and better going forward—do what they’re supposed to do. And 
while a rote list of these rules would be mind-numbingly boring, even to the most 
pedantic of developers, understanding what’s required at a high level can be very 
informative. Here’s what you can expect from the apps sold Windows Store:
Windows Store only
3
3
: Microsoft only allows Metro-style apps to be acquired 
and updated through Windows Store. Developers cannot offer these apps (or 
app updates) separately, from the web, or through other means. This allows 
Microsoft to control the quality of apps for Windows 8 and to enforce the rules 
that follow.
Free and paid: 
3
3
Windows Store caters to both free and paid apps. Those paid 
apps can range in price from $1.49 on up (in the United States).
Enterprises  
3
3
can get around  
this limitation, 
however, and  
“side-load” apps  
to their users 
through secure 
portals as well.

187
First Rule of Windows Store: There Are Rules to Windows Store
Trial versions: 
3
3
App makers can optionally provide a trial version of a paid app. 
That trial version of the app has to provide a reasonable approximation of the 
full version and cannot simply be an ad for the paid app. Trial versions can be 
time-limited or feature-limited.
In-app purchases: 
3
3
Apps can optionally offer in-app purchases, which are 
optional paid features.
Advertising:
3
3
 Apps sold by Windows Store can contain advertisements. These ads 
can include offers for in-app purchases, offers for the full version of the game 
from the trial version, and so on. Apps cannot, however, exist solely to serve ads. 
And apps cannot serve ads on their live tile, app bar, or via the edge UIs.
PCs and devices: 
3
3
The same Windows 8 apps can run on both traditional PCs 
(e.g., Intel x86) and new Windows RT-based (ARM) devices. However, app 
makers are not forced to support both, and you will see some apps that run 
only on one platform or the other.
5 PCs/devices: 
3
3
Apps you purchase or install from Windows Store can be 
installed on up to 5 PCs and/or devices.
Content policies: 
3
3
Windows Store enforces strict content policies that can 
vary from region to region. No apps with a rating over ESRB (Entertainment 
Software Rating Board) Mature (or equivalent) are allowed, which excludes 
adults-only content (that which features prolonged scenes of intense violence 
or graphic sexual content).
One tile:
3
3
 If you’ve ever installed an old-school Windows application like Office 
or Visual Studio on Windows 8, you know how awful it is to have numerous 
application tiles spewed onto your Start screen at the end. This won’t happen 
with Metro-style apps: Developers are limited to adding just a single app tile 
to the Start screen.
Metro-style apps only: 
3
3
Apps sold via Windows Store must be real Windows 8 
apps—that is, Metro-style apps and not traditional Windows applications. That 
said, Microsoft is allowing developers to list their desktop applications in Win-
dows Store, though directing users who wish to learn more, download the appli-
cation, or purchase it, to do so from the developer’s website.
No websites allowed: 
3
3
An app must be a native Windows 8 app and not just a 
shell for a website. Windows 8 provides a facility for pinning favorite websites 
to the Start screen already.
In this context, 
3
3
a PC is a PC based 
on an Intel or Intel-
compatible chipset, 
and a device is a 
PC that’s based on 
an ARM chipset and 
running Windows RT.
Apps must be 
3
3
rated and conform 
to rules set forth 
by the ESRB or 
equivalent rating 
system used in  
your locale.

C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
Respect privacy:
3
3
 If an app needs to publish your personal information to a 
third-party service, it must provide an opt-in mechanism so that you, the 
user, can explicitly OK this behavior before it happens. And the description 
provided must accurately explain how the information will be used or share 
and provide a way through which you can later rescind your permission. Apps 
that collect personal information must provide a privacy policy that explains 
how the developer is safeguarding your information.
Secure: 
3
3
Apps cannot compromise the security or integrity of Windows. Put 
simply, they can’t be malware or link to malware.
Reliable:
3
3
 It sounds fairly obvious, but apps must be reliable and not stop work-
ing suddenly, end unexpectedly, or contain what Microsoft calls “programming 
errors.” Ignore the irony of that statement for a moment and consider why this 
is truly important: When you download an application from the web, there’s no 
quality guarantee at all, and if the application stops working or never works 
properly, you have no real mediation other than complaining to the developer. 
In Windows Store, there are community-based means of complaint—poor 
reviews and ratings in the store—and Microsoft, as the curator of the store, to 
complain to as well.
Performance: 
3
3
Microsoft calls Metro-style apps fast and fluid, and it means 
that. Put in real-world terms, apps must start up in 5 seconds or less and 
resume in 2 seconds or less. Not impressed? Those scores must be obtained 
on a low-end, Atom-based PC. Chances are the Windows 8 device or PC you’re 
using is much faster.
Windows 8 features:
3
3
 Apps must support key Windows 8 features, including 
Snap, in which the app can share the screen with another snapped app. Apps 
must respect and utilize the system-level methods for app closing and not 
provide their own buttons or other mechanisms for closing. If an app uses 
notifications, it must support the system settings for these notifications so 
that the user can externally configure whether they work.
Network-friendly: 
3
3
Thanks to a new emphasis on cellular connectivity in Win-
dows devices and PCs—or what Microsoft calls metered Internet connections—
apps must prevent users from unintentionally transferring large amounts of 
data over such networks. Typical examples include apps that provide streaming 
video or audio, both of which have specific transfer limits.
Multiple markets and languages:
3
3
 Apps can be sold in multiple markets and in 
multiple languages if desired, though they must only support one of each.

Launching Windows Store
While Windows Store can be accessed like any other Metro-style app, the store is also 
central to other Metro experiences, so you’ll find a few more entry points in Windows 8 
as well. Here are some of the ways in which you can launch Windows Store:
Start screen tile:
3
3
 The Windows Store tile, shown in Figure 6-1, is available by 
default on the Windows 8 Start screen. Just tap the tile to launch the app.
 
Figure 6-1: The Windows Store tile  
is the obvious entry point to this impor-
tant app.
All apps:
3
3
 If Windows Store isn’t present on the Start screen for some reason, 
just enable the All Apps view (Right-click a blank area of the screen, tap Win-
key + Z, or on a touch screen device, swipe up from the bottom of the screen). 
It will appear in this view as Store.
App Search: 
3
3
You can also use Windows Search to search for Windows Store. 
Just tap Winkey + Q and type store.
From other apps: 
3
3
Microsoft and third-party apps can provide front ends to 
Windows Store. The obvious example that’s included with Windows 8 is Xbox 
Games, which provides access to, among other things, Metro-style games for 
Windows 8.
Using Windows Store
Of all the Windows 8 user experiences, Windows Store is perhaps the simplest and most 
obvious of all. Technology fans tend to toss around words like intuitive far more than is 
accurate, but in this case, it’s close: You’d have a hard time getting lost in, or confused 
by, Windows Store. Shown in Figure 6-2, Windows Store is a model for the Metro-style 
fierce reduction of user interface that Microsoft seems very proud of these days.

Figure 6-2: Awash in white space, it’s Windows Store.
It’s Going to Change
Thanks to the dynamic nature of its new apps platform, the Metro-style apps 
that Microsoft includes with Windows 8/RT will change over time, so it’s highly 
likely that this app will appear somewhat differently over time and will include 
additional features. This is normal, and as a general statement, it’s probably 
fair to say that the version of Windows Store you use will provide a superset of 
the functionality we describe in this chapter.
Navigating the Store’s Home Screen
As a true Metro-style experience, Windows Store offers horizontal rather than 
vertical navigation. That is, you scroll from left to right through the various app 
category sections that make up the home screen of this app, and not up and down 
as you would in a document-based application like Microsoft Word.
This navigation occurs logically enough as well: Users with touch-based devices 
will find that horizontal swipes work exactly as expected. Those with a mouse (or 
trackpad) can access the bottom-mounted scroll bar that appears when that pointing 
device is present, as shown in Figure 6-3, or use the mouse’s scroll wheel.

191
Using Windows Store
 
Figure 6-3: Mouse users can navigate Windows Store with a scroll bar.
And if you’re keyboard-bound, Page Up and Page Down will scroll the UI from 
category to category. Home and End will navigate directly to the front and rear of the 
app’s home screen, respectively.
In fact, it’s very similar to how the Start screen works. Windows Store even supports 
the semantic zoom feature that’s also available in the Start screen. This feature lets 
you zoom out the display of the app and view it from afar, enabling you to gain a better 
understanding of its layout and navigate more quickly to a specific store category.
The semantic zoom view is shown in Figure 6-4.
 
Figure 6-4: Windows Store in semantic zoom view
To achieve this effect, you pinch the screen if you’re using a touch-based device. 
With a mouse and keyboard, hold down the Ctrl key and use the mouse’s scroll wheel 
to move in and out of semantic zoom view.
Windows Store also provides an app bar, though it appears a bit differently than 
with other Metro-style apps, at the top of the app rather than the bottom, and using 
text-based links instead of normal buttons. Shown in Figure 6-5, the Store’s app bar 

192
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
lets you navigate quickly back to the Home screen from anywhere in the app— 
a handy feature given how quickly you can get lost while spelunking for apps.
 
Figure 6-5: Windows Store’s app bar provides a couple of handy quick links.
The Store’s app bar also provides a way to jump quickly to Your Apps, a list of the 
apps you’ve already downloaded or paid for. We discuss this latter feature later in 
the chapter.
Understanding Windows Store Categories
As noted earlier, Windows Store uses a category-based design in which the various 
app categories are represented visually by groups that are laid out from left to right, 
much as Start screen groups can be. The following major groups are available:
Spotlight: 
3
3
The first group provides a front-of-store experience, with the latest 
and most highly reviewed apps, showcased apps, and other notable apps.
Games:
3
3
 Expected to be the most popular app category as it is on Windows 
Phone and other mobile platforms, this group gets preferential placement 
and additional promotional space.
Social: 
3
3
This group contains apps related to social network services, such as 
Facebook and Twitter as well as blog-related apps, such as WordPress.
Entertainment: 
3
3
This group covers entertainment related apps that often 
cross over into music and video, including Flixster, Netflix, Xbox Companion, 
and the like.

193
Using Windows Store
Photo:

3
Here, you’ll find apps that extend the basic photo experiences in Win-
dows 8 with support for editing capabilities and various online photo services.
Music & Video: 
3
3
As with photos, Windows 8 provides only a basic multimedia 
experience, so this category will open up the platform’s support for music, 
video, online radio, podcast, and other related services.
Sports:
3
3
 Need an app to check up on the latest sports scores and gossip? It’ll be 
in here.
Books & Reference: 
3
3
Filled with apps for e-book reading platforms like Kindle 
and Nook, as well as more traditional reference material, this is the category 
to check out if you’re looking to turn that Windows 8 tablet into an electronic 
bookshelf.
News & Weather: 
3
3
If you wish to stay up to date with the news or weather, 
you’ll find a plethora of apps here for newspapers like The New York Times  
and Los Angeles Times, TV, and online-based news shops, such as News360 and 
MSNBC, weather utilities, and the like.
Health & Fitness:
3
3
 Need to track how many calories you’ve burned preparing 
for that dinner you made using an app from the next app category? You’ll find 
an app for that in this category.
Food & Dining: 
3
3
This category highlights cookbooks, restaurant review apps, 
and related apps.
Lifestyle:
3
3
 A collection of apps related to lifestyle activities that are not 
covered by the other categories.
Shopping: 
3
3
Here, you’ll find apps for Amazon.com and your other favorite 
retailers as well as apps related to the shopping experience, including reviews-
based apps.
Travel: 
3
3
Travel apps, including currency converters, guides to international 
locales, and hotel, airfare, and auto rentals can be found in this category.
Finance: 
3
3
Apps related to personal finance, taxes, and the stock market are 
available here.
Productivity: 
3
3
Perhaps the broadest category aside from games, this category 
includes apps related to productivity, including note-taking solutions like 
OneNote and Evernote, word processors and other document editors, cloud 
storage, and much, much more.
Tools:
3
3
 A collection of useful utilities which, like Security below, also 
includes a larger-than-usual selection of desktop applications in addition 
to Metro-style apps.

194
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
Security: 
3
3
The most curious category because it will likely consist mostly of 
links to traditional desktop applications over time rather than Metro-style 
apps, this category houses PC security and personal protection apps.
Business:
3
3
 This category includes the expected business-oriented titles, but 
also cloud-based storage services.
Education: 
3
3
Here you’ll find educational app titles of all types, from SAT 
preparation to star charts.
Within each group in the home screen, you will see a few promoted apps, tiled for 
top free and paid apps in that category, and other entries.
Diving a Bit Deeper
As you browse around Windows Store’s virtual storefront, you’ll eventually see some-
thing that strikes your fancy and you will want to dive a bit deeper. There are basically 
three paths you can take from the Windows Store home screen and arrive at a different 
type of landing page. These include landing pages for categories, lists, and apps. So 
let’s look at each.
Browsing by Category
Each category has its own landing page that provides a list of the apps within that 
category that are sortable by subcategories, prices, and/or other criteria (noteworthy, 
newest, highest rating, lowest price, and highest price). Accessing a category landing 
page, curiously, isn’t very obvious: You need to tap or click the category title on the 
Windows Store home screen.
The view is fairly consistent between categories, and you’ll see the same basic user 
interface elements on each category landing page, as you can see in Figure 6-6.
These elements include the following:
Back: 
3
3
A browser-style back button that persists throughout the Windows 
Store UI, letting you quickly navigate back to the previous screen. In the case 
of a category landing page, tapping this button will return you to the Win-
dows Store home screen.
Category title: 
3
3
A non-clickable title that indicates which category you’re 
viewing.
App count: 
3
3
Next to the category title, you will see an app counter listing how 
many apps there are in the current category. This number changes if you filter 
the list as described shortly.

195
Using Windows Store
 
Figure 6-6: The landing page for the Games category.
Subcategory filter: 
3
3
This widget lets you filter the current view so that it 
displays only apps of the selected subcategory. Available subcategories 
vary by category, of course. Games includes subcategories like Action, 
Adventure, Arcade, Card, Casino, and many, many more. A category view 
filtered with a subcategory will resemble Figure 6-7.
 
Figure 6-7: Viewing a subcategory only

196
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
Price filter: 
3
3
With this widget, you can filter by price with available choices 
being free, free and trial, and paid.
Sort filter: 
3
3
The sort filter is probably the least obvious but has some useful 
choices: Sort by noteworthy, newest, highest rating, lowest price, and high-
est price.
In case it’s not obvious, you can filter the view by any combination of subcategory, 
price, and sort. So you could, for example, view only noteworthy, free, strategy games 
if that’s what you’re looking for. This is shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: That’s exactly the game I was looking for!
Browsing by List
In many of the category groups on the Windows Store homepage, you’ll see colored 
tiles that represent app lists that are specially curated by Microsoft because they 
believe they’ll be interesting to users. There are some regular lists that will often be 
available, such as Top free and Top paid, and then promotional lists that appear from 
time to time. It’s not hard to imagine lists related to a holiday like Halloween, a major 
game release like the next Halo, or similar.
In Figure 6-9, you can see six such list tiles mixed in with tiles for individual 
games in the Spotlight group. These lists include Great apps for Windows 8, All Stars, 
New releases, Top free, Picks for you, and Rising stars.
When you view a list landing page, it looks a lot like the landing page for a category. 
There are Back, List title, and App count elements, as well as a grid of app tiles. Some 

197
Using Windows Store
of these list landing pages also include a nice textual description of the list so you can 
better understand what you’re looking at, as shown in Figure 6-10.
What’s missing here is any filtering: These list landing pages don’t include the 
subcategory, price, and sort filters you see on a category landing page.

Browsing by App
Eventually, it all comes down to an individual app. You can reach an app landing page 
via a direct link on the Windows Store home screen or by tapping its tile on a category 
or list landing page. In Figure 6-11, you can see the landing page for an app.
 
Figure 6-11: An app landing page
These app landing pages, like those for categories and lists, feature some common 
elements. These elements include:
Back: 
3
3
A browser-like Back button that will return you to the previous page.
App title: 
3
3
Non-interactive title text providing the name of the app.
Navigational breadcrumbs: 
3
3
Below the app title, you’ll see two or more bread-
crumb hyperlinks, providing you with both the exact location of the app in 
the store (like Home R Games R Puzzle) and a way to jump back to any loca-
tion in the store above the app. That is, you can tap Home, Game, or Puzzle in 
the previously cited example and navigate directly to one of those locations.
Overview view:
3
3
 The default view provides one or more screenshots, a descrip-
tion and feature list, and, optionally, other information such as links to the 
app website, app support, and feedback.
Details view: 
3
3
Tap the Details header and the display will change to show you 
the app’s release notes, supported processor(s) (x86, x64 and/or ARM), sup-
ported language(s), permissions, accessibility (if available), and terms of use. 
A typical app details view is shown in Figure 6-12.
The permissions 
3
3
list is worth looking 
at. Many apps 
will require access 
to your Internet 
connection, but some 
of the other possible 
permissions include 
access to your home 
or work network,  
your music library,  
and the like.

Tap the Reviews header and you’ll navigate to each of the 
reviews, and associated ratings, for the app. This list of reviews is sorted by 
newest by default, as shown in Figure 6-13, but it can be sorted by oldest, 
highest rated, lowest rated, or most helpful if desired.

 In the left pane of the default Overview 
view, you’ll see one or more buttons related to downloading the app. These 
include Buy, Try, and Install. We look at app downloading and updating 
later in this chapter.
Other Ways to Find Apps
If you’re content to simply browse around, the category-based layout of Windows 
Store is pleasant enough. But oftentimes you’re looking for something specific. 
And Windows Store does provide a couple of other ways to find the apps you want.
Finding Apps with Search
The most obvious way to search for apps is to use the system-wide search functional-
ity that’s available to all Metro-style apps. This occurs via the Search pane, which can 
be summoned while using Windows Store by tapping Winkey + Q, or by invoking the 
Charms bar via touch or mouse and then selecting Search. The Search pane is shown 
in Figure 6-14.
The Windows Store search experience isn’t bare bones. As you type, search sug-
gestions appear at the top of the pane, as shown in Figure 6-15. And in addition to 
basic as-you-type suggestions, Search provides recommendations for particularly 
well-regarded apps when appropriate.
 
Figure 6-14: The Search pane

201
Using Windows Store
Search suggestions and recommendations  
appear as you type, in the Search pane. But if 
you tap Enter, a complete list of search results 
will appear directly in the app, as shown in 
Figure 6-16. These results can be fine-tuned 
much like other landing pages, and they pro-
vide widgets for category, price, and sort.
From here, you can tap the app you want, 
go back to the previous page with the Back 
button, or tap the subtle Home link to return 
to the Windows Store home screen.
Finding Apps from the Web
Windows 8 users have a number of ways in 
which they can find Metro-style apps on the 
web. The first is via a developer-provided link. 
As it does with Windows Phone, Microsoft 
gives developers a way to link to Windows 8 
apps from the web. So developers can create a 
website for their new app and provide a hyper-
link that will actually cause the Windows Store 
app to launch when clicked, and then navigate to 
that app’s landing page. This is similar to links 
you may have seen for iPhone/iPad and Android 
apps online.
 
Figure 6-16: Search results appear in-app.
Figure 6-15: Windows Store Search  
supports search suggestions and  
recommendations.

202
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
As an added nicety, Microsoft also publishes an HTML version of the Windows 
Store landing page for your app that developers can place on their own site. This 
landing page looks exactly like the app landing page in Windows Store except that 
the Buy/Try/Install buttons have been replaced by a View in Windows Store button. 
An example is shown in Figure 6-17.
 
Figure 6-17: A web-based landing page for a Windows 8 app directs users to Windows Store.
For you, this feature is useful because Windows 8 app listings are available  
to search engines. So you can visit Google Search, Bing, or whatever other search 
engine and find the apps you’re looking for using the searching methods you’re 
already familiar with. We suspect that many will do just that.
The final way in which you can find apps from the web is a bit more subtle—OK, a 
lot more subtle—and it requires you to be using the Metro version of Internet Explorer. 
When you browse to the website for a Windows 8 app, that site can optionally provide 
an entry in IE’s Page Tools button menu, and can indicate this availability by placing 
a cute little plus (“+”) sign on the button. When you click the Page Tools button, you’ll 
see a menu item, Get app for this site, as shown in Figure 6-18. Clicking this item will 
cause the app’s landing page to load in Windows Store.
The Store app 
3

catalog is literally 
indexed by search 
engines, so anything 
that’s in the store 
is available from 
these services.

If you already have the app installed on your PC, that menu item will let you open 
the app instead.
Downloading, Installing, and Updating Apps
OK, so you’ve found the app of your dreams. Now what?
Downloading and Installing Apps
As you may recall, Windows Store supports three basic types of apps: free, paid, and 
trial, the latter of which are a reduced functionality (or time limited) version of a 
paid app. These app types will be reflected in the button or buttons you see on the 
landing page of the app you intend to download. As an example, consider Figure 6-19. 
Here, we see a single Install button.
 
Figure 6-19: An app landing page can have  
buttons for Install, Buy, or Try.

204
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
Install is just one of several buttons that can appear here. The complete list included:
Install: 
3
3
There are two reasons you might see an Install button. First, you have 
previously downloaded/purchased the app, so Windows Store is making it 
available to you now on another computer or device. Or second, the app is free.
Buy:
3
3
 Click this to purchase a paid app.
Try: 
3
3
Click this button to download a trial version of a paid app.
When you click any one of these buttons, the app begins downloading immedi-
ately. This is indicated in two ways: Windows Store navigates back to the homepage 
and displays a subtle installing message in the top right of the screen, followed by 
the notification shown in Figure 6-20.
 
Figure 6-20: Downloading and installing an app
If you’re quick enough, you can click (or tap) that initial download message and 
view the Installing Apps screen. This screen, shown in Figure 6-21, provides a progress 
bar for the app download and install process.
 
Figure 6-21: The Installing Apps screen
When the download completes . . . nothing happens. That is, if you stay on the 
Windows Store homepage, the installing message simply disappears. And if you do 
navigate to the Installing Apps screen, that’s not much help either: It simply reports 
that you aren’t installing any apps right now. Right.

205
Using Windows Store
As it turns out, the Metro-style app install process is so seamless that most 
installs take just seconds, and none require any hand-holding, User Account Con-
trol prompts, reboots, or the other nonsense that often accompanies a traditional 
Windows application installation.
On the other hand, a little guidance would be nice. But it’s not difficult: To find 
your app, you need to visit the Start screen. When a new app is installed, it’s placed 
on the end of the Start screen, so you may need to scroll to the right. In Figure 6-22, 
you can see our newly installed app, ready to go.
 
Figure 6-22: Newly installed apps appear at the end, or far right, of the Start screen.
Updating Apps
By default, Windows Store will automatically download any app updates in the 
background and then notify you—albeit in very subtle ways—when updates are 
ready for installation. There are two such prompts. The first appears on the Win-
dows Store live tile. If you have one or more pending updates to install, this tile 
will display a number notification on its surface, indicating how many apps need 
to be updated, as shown in Figure 6-23.
C ROSSREF  ​You can also manually check for updates, though this isn’t usually 
necessary since the process is automatic. However, if you’ve disabled the auto-
matic download of app updates, you can find out how to manually check for up-
dates in the section “Configuring Accounts and Preferences” later in this chapter.
Sometimes, 
3
3
if an app update 
is important and 
required, the app  
will actually notify 
you to download 
the update. The 
full-screen, modal 
notification will  
explain that a newer 
version of the app is 
required to continue 
using it.

206
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
When you navigate into Windows Store, you’ll see a similarly subtle message in 
the top right of the screen indicating that updates are available. (See Figure 6-24.)
 
Figure 6-23: The Windows Store live  
tile indicates whether you have pending  
updates.

choices in Figure 6-25.

To install all of the pending updates, simply click the Install button.

207
Using Windows Store
Finding Your Apps
Once you’ve used Windows Store for a while, or across a few PCs and devices, you may 
find it useful to view all of the apps you’ve downloaded and purchased. You can do 
this through the Your apps interface. To find this, display the Windows Store app bar 
and choose Your apps. After a bit of thinking, you’ll see a display much like that in 
Figure 6-26.
 
Figure 6-26: The Your apps interface provides a handy front end to, well, your apps.
As with other areas of Windows Store, you can filter this view, in this case in  
two unique ways. You can view all of the apps you’ve downloaded or just the ones you 
downloaded on a particular PC. And you can sort by apps that aren’t installed on the 
current PC, by date, or by name.
To install an app, simply select it and then click the Install button that appears 
in the app bar at the bottom of the screen as in Figure 6-27. You can also click View 
details to learn more about a selected app.
Getting the Core Microsoft Apps
Thanks to regulatory and antitrust-related agreements around the world, Microsoft 
is no longer free to bundle as many useful applications (or, in this case, apps) with 
Windows as it did in the past. For this reason, Windows 7 was often accompanied on 
new PC installs by related products like Windows Live Essentials and Zune that Micro-
soft said completed the Windows 7 experience. These applications didn’t technically

all of your apps?

the bottom left of 
the screen and then 
click Install.

208
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
come with Windows, but they were available separately, for free, and PC makers were 
free to bundle the apps on their PCs alongside Windows. So the net effect for most 
users was the same as if Microsoft had included them in Windows 7.
 
Figure 6-27: Installing apps from Your apps
Windows 8 faces similar scrutiny. So there are numerous Microsoft apps in this 
release that are not technically included with Windows 8. And though most PC makers 
are bundling them with Windows 8 as before, completing (or muddying, others would 
say) the experience, so to speak, many users will also acquire Windows on their own.
As discussed at the beginning of this book, we consider these apps to be a key 
part of the full, or complete, Windows 8 experience. The good news is that they’re 
readily available from Windows Store. And all of them are free. So if they’re not 
available in your copy of Windows 8 for some reason, you can find them here.
The app categories and the apps that fall within each are listed below:
Communications apps:
3
3
 These include Calendar, Mail, Maps, Messaging, People, 
Reader, and SkyDrive, or what we call the productivity apps.
Entertainment apps: 
3
3
Camera, Photos, Xbox Companion, Xbox Music, Xbox 
Video, and Xbox Games.
Bing apps:

 Bing, Finance, News, Sports, Travel, and Weather.
Not surprisingly, this book assumes you have these apps installed, so if any aren’t 
present on your PC, get cracking.

Rating and Reviewing Apps and Providing Other Feedback
As you download and install apps, you may find yourself relying on the in-store 
reviews and ratings that other users have provided. And as you spend more time 
reading these often useful bits of feedback, you’ll discover that you can optionally 
leave different types of feedback of your own, if you’d like and depending on what 
you’re comfortable with.
Windows Store supports different types of feedback, listed here from simple and 
fast to more involved.
Was This Review Helpful?
As you read an individual review, you may feel that it was particularly helpful . . .  
or not. And in a nice bit of fair play—where the hunter becomes the hunted—you can 
review a review, so to speak. That is, you can indicate whether a review was helpful 
in getting you to decide whether to download or buy it.
To leave this kind of feedback, find the Was this review helpful? link that 
appears below each review, as shown in Figure 6-28. Simply click Yes or No to  
indicate your choice.
 
Figure 6-28: You can rate a review!
As more and more people rate reviews, these choices become very important as 
they indicate the relative trustworthiness of each review. If 19 out of 20 people found 
a review helpful, for example, chances are it’s pretty good.

Report This Review
Sometimes a review is so terrible it warrants special attention. Perhaps the author 
uses foul language or is complaining about something that has nothing to do with 
the actual app (a long-running pet peeve of ours). If so, you can report the review 
and a real, live human being at Microsoft will take a look. If they agree with you, 
the review could be removed from the store.
To report an app, click the Report this review link.
Rate and Review an App
If you’re interested in opining on the quality of an app—for better or worse—you can 
write a review of your own. Reviews have a few components: a rating, which can go 
from 1 to 5 stars, a title, and then the review itself.
To write a review from within Windows Store, visit the app’s landing page and 
click the Write a review link you’ll see in the colored pane on the left side of the 
Overview view. In the next screen, shown in Figure 6-29, you’re provided with 
stars for the rating and fields for a title and the review body.
 
Figure 6-29: Windows Store app review form
Note that you are accountable for the reviews you write: The name and picture asso-
ciated with your Microsoft account will accompany the review, for all the world to see. 
But with awesome responsibility comes awesome power: Your rating will impact the 
overall rating of the app, and your review is now open to the plaudits—or criticisms—of 
your fellow Windows 8 users.
However, be 
3
3
careful when doing 
so: There’s no 
confirmation and no 
chance to change 
your mind.
You will need to

have first installed 
the app for the

Using Windows Store
Uninstalling Apps
If you’re familiar with the horrific and unreliable method for uninstalling traditional 
Windows desktop-based applications, which in many cases does nothing to remove 
spurious files and registry entries, you’ll be delighted to discover that uninstalling 
a Metro-style app is simplicity itself. Most surprisingly, perhaps, you uninstall these 
apps from the Start screen.
To uninstall an app, navigate to the Start screen and locate the tile for that app. 
If it’s not present, you can use the Windows 8 All Apps list, or Start search to locate 
the app. Here’s how:
All Apps: 
3
3
From the Start screen, open the app bar. This can be done by swiping 
in from the top or bottom edge of the screen, by pressing Winkey + Z, or by right-
clicking an empty area of the Start screen with the mouse. Then, select All apps 
from the app bar and locate the app you want to remove from the list.
Start Search:
3
3
 From the Start screen, open the app search experience. This can 
be done by swiping in from the right edge of the screen and choosing Search 
from the Charms bar. (Alternatively, press Winkey + Q, or activate the Charms 
bar and choose Search with the mouse.) From this interface, type the name of 
the app you wish to uninstall until it becomes obvious in the filtered app list.
Whichever method you’re using—the Start screen, All Apps, or Start Search—to 
uninstall an app you must select it first. This is done on a touch interface by tapping 
and holding and then dragging down until a selection border appears (Start screen 
tile) or the app tile is color-selected (All Apps, Start Search), and the app bar appears. 
With a mouse, simply right-click the tile. Keyboard selection is a bit trickier and less 
common, but you can use the arrows keys to highlight the correct tile or app, and 
then press Ctrl + Space to select it.
Figure 6-30 shows what a selected Start screen tile looks like.
 
Figure 6-30: A selected tile on the Start screen

212
C h a p t e r  6    Windows Store: Finding, Acquiring, and Managing Your Apps
Wherever you make this selection—
from the Start screen, All apps view, or 
from Search, you will see an Uninstall 
choice in the app bar. To uninstall the app, 
simply select this button. As you can see 
in Figure 6-31, you will be prompted with a 
pop-up window and informed that Metro-
style app uninstall is a complete wipe: not 
just the app but its data is removed from 
the PC.
Configuring Accounts and Preferences
Like other Metro-style apps, Windows Store provides a simple Settings interface, and 
it is through this interface that you can access your account settings and other store-
related preferences. Likewise, accessing this interface occurs as it does in other 
Metro experiences, through the Settings pane. You can access this pane from within 
Windows Store by typing Winkey + I, by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, 
or by using the mouse to enable the Charms bar and then choosing Settings.
The Windows Store settings pane is shown in Figure 6-32.
 
Figure 6-32: Windows Store settings
Figure 6-31: Are you sure you 
want to uninstall that app?
To do this, move 
3
3
the mouse cursor 
to the upper- or 
lower-right corner 
of the screen and 
then move the 
cursor along the 
right edge of the 
screen toward the 
center. It’s a bit 
more natural to 
perform than it is 
to describe.

213
 Configuring Accounts and Preferences
While the Preferences option may seem to be the most relevant, it leads to a 
screen with only two configurable choices—Make it easier to find apps in my pre-
ferred languages (which is enabled by default) and Make it easier to find apps that 
include accessibility features (which is not). Instead, click Your account. When you 
do, you’ll see a full-screen interface like that in Figure 6-33.
 
Figure 6-33: Your account
From here, you can configure some useful settings related to Windows Store. 
These include the following:
Your store account: 
3
3
You can sign out of your current account and use a  
different account for store activities.
Payment and billing information:

Windows Store uses the credit card 
information that is registered with your Microsoft account for purchases 
by default, so this option is generally set to No. However, if you’d prefer to 
manually sign in to your Microsoft account every time a purchase is made 
for security reasons, you can make that change here.
Click App

check for app 
updates.

Your registered PCs (and devices):

When you install any app (paid, free, trial) 
on a PC or device, it is added to the list of 5 PCs/devices to which you can install 
apps. These apps, of course, and the 5 PCs/devices list, are tied to your Microsoft 
account. Via this interface, you can remove a PC/device from the list of your 
registered PCs and devices, as shown in Figure 6-34. Doing so will prevent those 
apps from running on the deselected PC/device going forward.

Summary
With Windows Store, you can feel secure that Microsoft’s curated app store will provide 
you with the best possible experience, one that bridges the gap between the insecure 
Wild West of Google’s Android platform and the overly controlling and nonintegrated 
Apple App Store. This best-of-both-worlds experience draws on the lessons Microsoft 
learned from Windows Phone Marketplace, as well.
Using the store is a breeze, thanks to its intuitive, Metro-style UI, logical category-
based organization, and a plethora of app discovery and feedback tools. You can use 
Windows Store to find, download, try, and buy Metro-style apps, and then update them 
with new features as needed. Only app uninstall occurs outside the store, and that’s a 
simple process that won’t litter your PC with leftover files and registry entries.
With this experience under your belt, you can begin further exploring Windows 8’s 
rich app landscape. And in the remainder of this section of the book, you’ll do just that, 
as you examine Internet Explorer 10 and the various productivity and entertainment 
apps that make this OS the best Windows yet.

third-party browsers
In keeping with the dual user experience nature of Windows 8  
itself, Microsoft has reimagined Internet Explorer—and, really, web browsing in 
general as well—in this new operating system, creating a fascinating, dual-mode 
version of the most-frequently used Windows application. Internet Explorer 10 is, 
in many ways, the poster child for this Windows 8-based vision of the future, offer-
ing both a Metro-style user experience and a more traditional, desktop-based web 
browser version as well.
It’s a model that other web browser makers, and perhaps other application makers, 
will emulate in their own solutions. But because web browsers play such a special role in 
Windows, having both Metro-style and traditional browsers available comes with some 
unique new constraints as well. So this chapter explores these changes, as well as the new 
features of both versions of Internet Explorer 10.

216
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
Two Browsers, One Brain: Understanding 
Internet Explorer 10
How you view Internet Explorer 10 will depend greatly on how you view Windows 8 
and its two separate user experiences. That’s because, like Windows 8 itself, Internet 
Explorer 10 offers two faces to the world: a full-screen, Metro-style version of the 
browser and a more traditional, desktop-based version.
Let’s see what that means. In Figure 7-1, you can see the Metro version of Internet 
Explorer, with its normally hidden application user interface (or chrome) displayed 
for context. This version of IE offers a full-screen, touch-friendly, immersive user 
experience.
 
Figure 7-1: The Metro-style version of Internet Explorer 10
In Figure 7-2, meanwhile, you see the desktop version of Internet Explorer 10. 
This looks and works much like previous IE versions and is tailored for the traditional 
desktop environment. It offers a richer feature set, with full support for add-ons and 
browser extensions.
These two solutions are separate but also connected. That is, the Metro-style app 
and the desktop application are indeed two different executables, or programs. But 
they utilize the same rendering engine under the hood, share numerous features and 
data, and, most confusingly, interact with each other, and with other browsers and 
the underlying OS, in brand-new ways.

217
Two Browsers, One Brain: Understanding Internet Explorer 10
 
Figure 7-2: The desktop version of Internet Explorer 10
Microsoft describes these dual Internet Explorer applications as two different 
experiences, or skins, with one underlying browser engine. But that’s a bit of a stretch. 
In reality, Internet Explorer 10 acts as two distinct applications, and that becomes 
more evident when you configure Windows to use a different default browser (like 
Google Chrome).
As a result, it’s perhaps a bit fairer to say that Windows 8 offers two very different 
browser experiences, though each do share some underpinnings. Which one you use 
will depend very much on how you use Windows 8.
That is, if you find yourself using the Metro user experience a lot, perhaps 
because you’re using a touch-based device like a tablet, you’ll probably want to stick 
with Internet Explorer for Metro. But if you are using a more traditional mouse- and 
keyboard-based system, perhaps a desktop PC or laptop, the desktop version of Inter-
net Explorer will be what you’re looking for.
Or maybe things aren’t so black and white. As it turns out, our devices, just like 
the OS they run, are changing. And as you read this, you could be using a tablet that 
docks and connects to a larger display and a keyboard and mouse, and other periph-
erals, while you’re sitting at a desk. Or perhaps you’ll opt for a hybrid laptop or Ultra-
book that can work as both a traditional PC, with keyboard and mouse, or, with the 
flip of a screen, can be used like a tablet.
With such devices, your usage will vary not by the device type—since these new 
kinds of PCs are so versatile—but rather by the situation. They can change on the 
fly, in fact, and you can move between the different Internet Explorer applications 
as your usage changes. And because these two applications share browsing history, 
typed addresses, settings, and more, moving back and forth is fairly seamless.
While we tend 
3

to use the term 
app to describe 
Metro-style 
solutions, and 
application for 
desktop solutions, 
this is just for 
convenience. 
Effectively speaking, 
both types of 
solutions are 
applications.  
(And, as it turns  
out, both are  
apps too!)

and IE 10 desktop

features, such as 
SmartScreen and 
InPrivate Browsing.

218
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
NO TE ​ ​IE 10 Metro and IE 10 desktop also share many (but not all) underpinning 
technologies, including hardware acceleration of web-based text, graphics, 
video, and audio, and compiled JavaScript—you know, if you’re a web geek.
Another thing to consider, though this may be hard to believe: You may just end up 
liking Internet Explorer 10 Metro, and grow to prefer using it, even if you work mostly 
in the desktop environment. It can be said that the Metro version of Internet Explorer 
10, with its chrome-free user interface and full-screen browsing experience, is like a 
gateway drug for the rest of Metro. It may, in fact, help convince you to ditch that aging 
desktop or laptop and head toward a more modern device with touch capabilities.
Either way, Internet Explorer 10 does offers what Microsoft loves to describe as 
a “no compromises” web browsing experience that works very well with both touch-
screen devices and desktop-based machines, and also offers a way to move back 
and forth between them. Both experiences are available anywhere, from a powerful 
multi-display desktop all the way down to a svelte, 7-inch tablet.
But don’t decide now. In the coming sections, we’ll thoroughly examine the 
new Metro-style version of Internet Explorer. (IE 10 for the desktop hasn’t changed 
much at all, from a user experience standpoint, since IE 9.) And then you can 
decide for yourself.
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro is a touch-friendly, Metro-style web browser that works 
pretty well with mouse and keyboard too. It offers an add-on free experience that is 
faster and safer but dispenses with some useful functionality you may expect if you’ve 
used previous IE versions.
Like other Metro-style apps, IE 10 Metro is immersive, or tailored for a touch-first 
device experience. That means no visual distractions—thanks to its lack of chrome—
and the ability to use simple gestures to navigate the web and pan and zoom across 
individual web pages.
IE 10 Metro also changes the web in some crucial ways. On-screen controls like 
check boxes and radio buttons are styled differently so that they’re touch-friendly. 
It’s very similar to the experience offered by the Windows Phone version of Internet 
Explorer, in fact.
Some common browser activities are handled quite a bit differently in this version 
of Internet Explorer. For example, search and sharing occur from the system-wide 
IE 10 Metro 
3
3
may be add-on  
free, but it does 
include an integrated 
version of Adobe 
Flash so it will work 
with many (but not 
all) popular Flash-
based websites, 
including those for 
videos and games.

contracts that are available from the Charms bar. And the Metro Devices interface is 
used to print, play video on other screens, and interact with other devices.
C ROSSREF  ​Chapter 3 describes Charms, contracts, and other common  
Metro features.
Some things, of course, are the same as with the desktop version of IE. Aside 
from the basic feature set, including features like InPrivate Browsing and Tracking 
Protection, you’ll find that many keyboard shortcuts from desktop IE continue to 
work in the Metro version of the browser. And if you find a page that won’t work in IE 
Metro—perhaps because of its lack of add-on support—you can easily open that page 
in the desktop version of Internet Explorer and get back to work.
The IE Metro User Experience
The Metro version of Internet Explorer 10  
should be available via its live tile on the  
Windows 8 Start screen, as shown in  
Figure 7-3.
IE Metro Isn’t Always Available
Yes, that says should. Sadly, depending on how you acquired Windows 8—perhaps 
by upgrading an existing PC or from a PC maker who has modified the default 
settings—you may see a tile for the desktop version of Internet Explorer instead, 
as shown in Figure 7-4. Or, you may see a tile for a competing web browser.

That’s the IE 10 desktop tile.

C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
Unfortunately, this is an important consideration, because when another brows-
er or the desktop version of IE is configured as the default browser, Internet 
Explorer 10 for Metro won’t even be available. It will literally be hidden from you, 
and unavailable. Because of this possibility, we explain exactly how and why this 
happens, and how you can fix it, in the final section of this chapter. So if you’re 
not seeing what you should be seeing, jump ahead now. And no worries, it’s  
easily fixed, if not easily understood.
The first time you launch the Metro version of Internet Explorer may be a bit sur-
prising, and while Figure 7-5 is probably inadequate for explaining why, here it goes.
 
Figure 7-5: It’s the touchable web: IE 10 for Metro.
What you may not be getting from that static screenshot is that Internet Explorer 
for Metro, like IE for Windows Phone, offers only a very minimal user interface, and 
one that is, in fact, hidden by default. So what you’re looking at there is a web page 
loaded in a browser that has no surrounding user interface, or what browser makers 
call chrome. That is, you’re seeing just the web page, and not the browser.
Like other Metro-style apps, Internet Explorer 10 does provide a so-called edge 
UI that is accessed by swiping toward the middle of the screen from the top or bottom 
edge. (Mouse users can right-click any blank area of the browser’s surface to trigger 
this interface, while keyboard users should learn the Winkey + Z shortcut.) When you 
access this edge UI, the browser will resemble Figure 7-6.
Yes, this is 
3

why Google named 
its own browser 
Chrome.
To hide the edge 
3
3
UIs, simply perform 
the same swipe—or 
keyboard shortcut, 
or right-click, again. 
These things almost 
always work like a 
toggle.

221
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
 
Figure 7-6: The IE Metro edge UI
There’s a lot going on here. In fact, one thing you may have noticed is that Internet 
Explorer 10 is fairly unique among Metro-style apps in that it not only offers a single 
app bar—that toolbar-like control at the bottom of the screen that in IE is called the 
navigation bar—but it also offers a second bar, called the tab switcher, at the top of the 
screen. Almost all Metro-style apps offer a single app bar. But very few go beyond that, 
as IE does.
The reason for this overloaded user interface is simple. Internet Explorer 10 is a 
fairly complex and certainly full-featured app, just like its desktop-based cousin. And 
it requires the additional space for commands that’s afforded by the extra chrome.
NO TE ​ ​In some cases, only the navigation bar will appear, allowing you to type 
a URL into the address bar or perform other actions. If you don’t see the tab 
switcher as well, simply swipe down from the top of the screen (or perform any 
other input action that will display an edge UI).
Understanding the Navigation Bar
The Internet Explorer navigation bar has several main user interface components, 
which are called out in Figure 7-7 and described next.
Back: 
3
3
This button functions like a simplified version of the Back button com-
monly found in desktop web browsers. However, in keeping with the Metro 
design philosophies, it lacks advanced features, such as the ability to tap and 
hold to access a menu of past pages and the browser History.

222
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
 
Figure 7-7: The IE navigation bar
NO TE ​ ​IE Metro supports other ways to go back to the previously loaded web 
page. We’ll examine these capabilities in the “Navigating the Web with IE 10 
Metro” section.
Site Icon: 
3
3
A noninteractive button that displays the site’s icon, if any.
Address bar: 
3
3
This control works much like the address bar in the desktop ver-
sion of Internet Explorer, but with some key differences. You can, of course, 
select the address bar to type any arbitrary URL, and then press Enter to start 
navigation. But IE Metro is unique because a full-screen view of Frequent and 
Pinned sites is displayed each time the address bar is selected. And as you type, 
these lists are filtered, on the fly. This feature is so cool, we discuss it more in 
the “Finding Favorites and Other Websites” section later in this chapter.
Sites with encrypted connections will include a lock badge in the address bar, 
just as with the desktop version of IE. This control also works as a progress 
indicator while sites are loading.
The address bar also lacks some features of the desktop IE’s address bar, 
including a menu-based auto-complete list and Compatibility View.
Refresh/Stop: 
3
3
This button works just like its desktop cousin: Tap it to refresh 
(reload) the current page or, if the currently loading page is stuttering or not 
completing for some reason, tap it to stop it from loading.
Pin to Start: 
3
3
While old-school IE users probably cart around a folder full of 
Favorites—Internet Explorer’s version of the browser bookmarks feature—the 
cool kids started pinning their favorite sites to the Windows 7 taskbar with 
IE 9. And now in IE 10, you can pin your favorite sites to the Windows 8 Start 
screen too. This is how you do it, and because it’s such a great new feature 
with unique capabilities, we examine it in detail later in this chapter.
NO TE ​ ​The Favorites Bar is no longer available in IE Metro, because of screen 
real estate reasons.
Page Tools: 
3
3
This useful tool displays a pop-up menu when tapped. From 
here, you can utilize IE Metro’s Find on Page and View on the Desktop 
To search 
3
3
the web from 
the address bar, 
simply type your 
search query in the 
address bar. Internet 
Explorer will search 
the web using the 
configured search 
engine, which, by 
default, is Bing.
You can still pin 
3
3
websites to the 
Windows 8 taskbar. 
But you will do this 
separately, from the 
desktop version of IE.

223
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
functionalities. The former helps you search the currently displayed web 
page for a specific search term. The latter, new to IE 10, loads the currently 
displayed web page in the desktop version of Internet Explorer. You will also 
occasionally see a Get app for this site option in the Page Tools menu; in such 
cases, the button itself will change a bit, adding a small gear graphic, indicat-
ing that a Windows 8 Metro-style app is also available.
Forward: 
3
3
Yep, this works much like the Forward button in the desktop version 
of IE. But as with Back, it lacks advanced features, like the ability to tap and 
hold to access a menu of past pages and the browser History.
Understanding the Tab Switcher
Whereas desktop versions of Internet Explorer feature an always-visible row of 
browser tabs, IE Metro tries to do more with less, so it hides its new tab switcher and 
other UI chrome elements by default. But when enabled, the tab switcher, as shown 
in Figure 7-8, provides the UI elements described next.
 
Figure 7-8: The IE tab switcher
Active Tab(s): 
3
3
The majority of the tab switcher is occupied with one or more 
thumbnails representing the currently open browser tabs, each with its 
own web page loaded. You will always see at least one tab thumbnail here—
representing the current page—and if you open enough tabs, a second tab 
thumbnail row will appear.
New Tab: 
3
3
This button opens a new tab and then provides a view of your Frequent 
and (if available) Pinned lists (offering your most frequently accessed sites as 
well as those you’ve pinned to the Start screen, respectively) and the address 
bar so you can manually type in a website URL—or a search term—if desired.
Tab Menu: 
3
3
This button displays a small menu when tapped. It has two 
choices: New InPrivate tab and Close tabs. The former opens a new tab in 
Internet Explorer’s InPrivate Browsing mode, which prevents anything that 
happens in that tab from making its way into the global browser History. 
(What happens in InPrivate Browsing mode stays in InPrivate Browsing 
mode.) Close tabs is exactly what it sounds like: it simply closes all but the 
currently displayed tab.
IE Metro only 
3
3
supports two tab 
thumbnail rows in 
the tab switcher.  
If both rows are  
full, and you open  
yet another tab,  
the oldest tab is 
removed.
Want to close 
3
3
just a single tab? 
Ctrl + W still works 
for the current tab. 
And you can use the 
little close icon on a 
tab if you prefer  
using touch or the 
mouse.

Navigating the Web with IE 10 Metro
Now that you’re up to speed on the major UI components of the Metro-styled version 
of Internet Explorer 10, you can turn your attention to actually using the browser. 
You’ll also see some similarities with desktop IE versions, and some differences, 
which could prove to be vexing.
Key among these is right-click, or what we call “tap and hold” for touch users. This 
common action doesn’t work in IE Metro the same as it does in the desktop versions 
of the browser, and in fact only offers up limited options, depending on what you’ve 
clicked (or tapped). Right-clicking also brings up the browser navigation bar if you’re 
not selecting an on-page object.
What this means is that you can’t right-click any element on a web page and 
access all of the advanced options you get with desktop IE. Instead, you’ll have 
limited options depending on what you’ve selected:
Images:
3
3
 Right-click an (unhyperlinked) image, and you’ll see two useful 
choices in the context menu that appears: Copy, which copies the image to 
the clipboard, and Save to Picture library.
Hyperlinked Images: 
3
3
Right-click a hyperlinked image, and you’ll see Copy, 
Copy Link, Open link in a new tab, Open link, and Save to Picture library.
Text: 
3

If you select a block of text on a web page, you can right-click to copy it 
to the clipboard.
Hyperlinked text:
3
3
 Right-click hyperlinked text, and you’ll see Copy Link, 
Open link in a new tab, and Open link.
But most actions will work as expected in IE Metro. You can tap hyperlinks to 
access the underlying page, scroll with your finger, and so on. Here are some key 
navigational concerns you’ll want to know about in Internet Explorer for Metro.
Home
As with mobile device browsers, IE Metro does not support the notion of Home, let alone 
allow you to configure multiple homepages, as does the desktop version of IE. Instead, 
the browser maintains state between sessions, and even between shutdowns, so that 
the last site you were visiting—all open tabs, really—are automatically reloaded the 
next time you open IE Metro.
Back and Forward
As noted previously, the IE Metro navigation bar sports both Back and Forward buttons 
for normal navigation, albeit without any advanced features. But when you consider 

225
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
that IE Metro will normally be used in a chrome-less mode in which the navigation bar 
and tab switcher are hidden, re-enabling the navigation bar just for basic purposes 
could get pretty tedious. Fortunately, there are other ways.
Keyboard users can utilize the standard Alt + Left Arrow and Alt + Right Arrow 
combinations for Back and Forward, respectively. But since Metro in general and IE 
Metro specifically are designed for multi-touch interfaces, it’s more likely that you’ll 
want to utilize some new gestures to navigate Back and Forward. To do so, simply tap 
and hold near the edge of the screen and then swipe toward the middle. If you do so 
from the left edge of the screen, you’ll navigate back. Do so from the right, and you’ll 
navigate forward.
But even mouse users have a new way to navigate. If you move the mouse cursor 
near the left edge of the screen, you’ll see a new Back transport control appear, as in 
Figure 7-9. You can click this control to navigate Back without needing to first display 
the navigation bar. A similar control appears on the right side of the screen for Forward.
 
Figure 7-9: The IE Back tip lets you navigate back without having to  
first display the navigation bar.
Visiting Specific Websites
As with any web browser, you can arbitrarily visit any website by typing its name into 
the address bar. As described previously, however, the address bar is hidden by default. 
So swipe up from the bottom edge of the display (or down from the top) to display the 
navigation bar, which includes the address bar.
Finding Favorites and Other Websites
Since the Metro version of IE is focused on providing basic web browsing function-
ality in a package that is touch-friendly, it doesn’t include all of the features of its 
Keyboard

users will want to 
remember one of 
two quick keyboard 
shortcuts to more

course, with a mouse, 
you can simply right-
click any blank area  
in IE Metro.

desktop cousin. Or in some cases, it hides functionality in order to keep the display 
minimalist.
One of the classic examples of this latter user interface miscue is Favorites. It’s 
in there. In fact, IE Metro synchronizes your Favorites list with the desktop version 
and, if you’ve enabled it, with other PCs as well. But this browser offers absolutely no 
way to access your Favorites as a list or menu. And it provides no way to save a site as 
a Favorite. Instead, you must pin favorite sites to the Start screen.
But since IE Metro does at least synchronize with your list of Favorites, there must 
be some way to access these sites from the browser, right? Right. And there is. It’s just 
not clear to us how anyone would ever discover this functionality on their own.
The only way to access Favorites in IE Metro is via search: Select the address bar 
and start typing. As you do, the navigation tiles at the top of the display change to 
display search results that match what you’re typing. And these results comprise four 
things: frequently accessed sites, pinned sites, very popular websites, and . . . wait 
for it . . . your Favorites. You can see this effect in Figure 7-10.
 
Figure 7-10: Favorites are available only when you search through the address bar.
Why so opaque? It’s pretty clear that Microsoft considers the Favorites list a legacy 
interface and would prefer users to start moving toward pinned sites. This will be fine 
for average consumers who only store a handful of frequently visited sites. But power 
users will need to know the workaround, or simply stick with the desktop version of IE.
You can access the Frequent list, as the list of frequently accessed sites is called, 
and your pinned sites—but not your Favorites—simply by selecting the address bar. 
This navigation list display is shown in Figure 7-11.
 
Figure 7-11: Frequent and Pinned sites are available when you just select the address bar.

Chapter 2.

Working with Tabs
Tabs provide a convenient way to access multiple websites from the same browser win-
dow. And IE Metro, as a modern mobile web browser, offers decent tab functionality. As 
noted earlier, you can access the new tab switcher by using the top or bottom edge UI 
(or the Winkey + Z shortcut) and manage tabs from there. But your old tab skills work as 
well. You can use Ctrl + T to open a new tab, for example, and Ctrl + W to close one.
Internet Explorer Metro also provides access to InPrivate tabs, special tabs whose 
browser history will not be recorded as you go, providing a sense of privacy. InPrivate 
Browsing is available via a button in the tab switcher, but you can also use the key-
board shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P. However you choose to engage this feature, you’ll see 
a display similar to that in Figure 7-12, indicating that InPrivate Browsing is on and 
you’re safe.
 
Figure 7-12: InPrivate Browsing keeps your browsing history private.
You can switch between open tabs most easily with the keyboard: The Ctrl + Tab 
keyboard shortcut from desktop IE works identically in IE Metro.
Fun with Zoom
If you’ve ever used a mobile browser before, you know that most support a cool, touch-
based system in which you pinch the screen or double-tap the screen to zoom in to and 
out of specific areas of a web page. Not surprisingly, IE Metro supports these gestures 
too. And they make a big difference in the way you’ll read many web pages.

228
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
Consider a typically busy website like the one shown in Figure 7-13. While it is 
possible to read such a site on larger screens, the text is small and hard to read with 
smaller displays like those on a slate-based device.
 
Figure 7-13: Modern websites are often difficult to read on portable devices like those  
running Windows 8.
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro offers two ways to cut through the clutter. First, 
you can double-tap the screen to zoom in to the area you tapped, such as a column of 
text. This will resemble the screen shown in Figure 7-14.
To reverse the effect, just double-tap the screen again.
The second and arguably even more fun effect involves pinching the screen to 
zoom arbitrarily. Simply pinch the screen with two fingers to zoom out, and then 
“reverse the pinch” to zoom back in.
Actually, there’s a third way. If you’d prefer to change the screen zoom perma-
nently, you can configure IE Metro to do so. Please refer to the section “Configuring 
IE 10 Metro,” later in this chapter, for details.
Downloading Files
While IE Metro utilizes the same Download folder as the desktop version, the download 
experience is, naturally, a bit different. This browser utilizes a pane just above the

navigation bar, asking whether you’d like to Run, Save, or Cancel the downloadable file. 
This is shown in Figure 7-15
 
Figure 7-14: You can zoom in to a text column or other on-screen area by  
double-tapping it.
 
Figure 7-15: The file download experience
You may be familiar with this process on the desktop version of IE, which offers 
advanced save options—Save and run, and Save as—in addition to the choices offered 
in IE Metro. But as it turns out, the Save option in IE Metro is identical to Save and run 
on desktop IE. That is, IE Metro will prompt you to run a downloaded file—assuming it 
passed the SmartScreen security screening—as shown in Figure 7-16.

Searching the Web
Searching the web from a web browser has evolved over the years, with desktop ver-
sions of Internet Explorer first offering a dedicated search box and then integrating

search directly into the address bar. In the Metro-style version of Internet Explorer, 
this capability has been refined yet again: This browser uses the integrated Search 
contract capabilities of Windows 8 to provide Internet search capabilities.
So you perform a search just as you do in any other Metro-style app: Open the 
search pane from the Charms bar and start typing.
Here’s how:
Touch:

then tap Search.

 Press Winkey + Q to open the search pane.
However you do it, the search pane will resemble Figure 7-17.
 
Figure 7-17: To trigger an Internet search from IE Metro, you must use the search pane.
As we explained in Chapter 3, the Search contract that backs this functionality is 
available system-wide in Windows 8 to any Metro experiences that choose to support 
it. And many do: This interface is used to search for Metro-style apps, classic Windows 
applications, settings and control panels, and files, as well as many different Metro-
style apps—including, as it turns out, Internet Explorer Metro.
Here are a few things to note about this functionality.

231
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
First, the default search engine is Bing. This choice is inherited from the desk-
top version of Internet Explorer and is extremely laborious to change. If you simply 
want to perform a one-time search via Google, or some other service, you’re better 
off navigating to that service’s website manually.
No, Really, I Want to Change the Search Provider
Okay, so you really want to change the search provider? Don’t say we didn’t 
warn you. Here are the hoops you need to jump through:
First, open the desktop version of Internet Explorer, as you can’t change search 
providers using IE Metro. Now open the Tools menu by clicking the gear icon in 
the upper-right corner of the window (or type Alt + T); then, click Manage Add-ons. 
This opens the Manage Add-ons window.
On the left, click Search Providers, then drill down to your preferred search 
service on the right; then, click the Set as default button.
Of course, you probably only have one search provider, Bing, installed on 
your PC. To install another search provider—the reason you’re reading this—
click the Find more search providers link at the bottom of the window. This 
will load the Internet Explorer Gallery website where you will then need to 
find and install a service provider.
One last hoop: Newly installed providers don’t always show up in the Manage 
Add-ons window immediately. To make that happen, you may need to close the 
Manage Add-ons window and try again. It’s surprisingly laborious.
Second, the search pane maintains a list of recent searches. So you may see these 
appear below the search box in the search pane. Click one to rerun that search.
Sharing a Web Page with Others
In addition to supporting the Search contract, Internet Explorer Metro also supports 
the Share contract, allowing it to share web pages with other apps.
To share a web page from IE Metro, open the share pane via the Charms bar. This 
works identically to the procedures detailed in the previous section, but you will choose 
Share instead of Search from the Charms bar. When you do, the Share pane appears as 
shown in Figure 7-18.

232
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
Select the app you wish to share with and that app’s Share interface will appear. 
In Figure 7-19, we’re using the Mail app to share the current web page with others via 
e‑mail. (This experience will vary from app to app.)

Printing with IE Metro
To print from the Metro-style version of Internet Explorer, you can access the Devices 
interface, which is also accessible via the Charms bar. This is the standard way to 
print from Metro-style apps. However, IE Metro also supports the traditional Ctrl + P 
keyboard shortcut.
Once displayed, the Devices pane should resemble Figure 7-20.
Select a printer from the list and you’ll see a screen like that in Figure 7-21, with 
options that are specific to that printer. Tap Print to print the page.

options you’re used to seeing via the Devices interface. But don’t fret; you can 
still access those features via the print dialog shown in desktop applications, 
including the desktop version of Internet Explorer.
Finding Windows 8 Apps on the Web
Finally, here’s a fun Windows 8–specific feature you’ll see from time to time. When 
you visit a website that offers a Windows 8 app, it can change the Page tools app bar 
button and menu. The button will display a small plus sign, and when you click it, a 
third new menu choice, Get app for this site, will appear, as shown in Figure 7-22.
 
Figure 7-22: Sites can advertise their  
Windows 8 Metro app through IE Metro.
Tap that item and the Windows Store will open and navigate to the app’s land-
ing page.
Using Pinned Websites
If you’re familiar with Internet Explorer 9, you know that Microsoft added a unique 
ability to this version of its web browser: The ability to pin websites to the Windows 7 
Start menu and taskbar, alongside those for traditional Windows applications. These 
pinned sites work much like regular applications, and they appear in a special version 
of the Internet Explorer 9 browser frame that is color-coded to match the design of 
the underlying site.
The desktop version of Internet Explorer 10 provides this same capability in 
Windows 8, but the new Metro-style version of IE 10 offers a unique, Metro-based 
take on this functionality: You can now pin websites to the Start screen as well.
This makes sense when you consider that the Start screen is replacing the 
application-launching functionality of the Start menu and taskbar in Windows 8. 
If you already

235
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
But there are some curious behaviors—and differences with taskbar/Start menu 
pinning—to know about.
To pin a website to the Start screen, load it in Internet Explorer Metro and then 
tap the Pin button in the navigation bar. (This bar may be hidden. If so, you can swipe 
up from the bottom of the screen or use your other new Metro skills to display it.) As 
shown in Figure 7-23, you’re given a chance to rename the site before it’s pinned. 
(Some websites have annoying long names.)
 
Figure 7-23: You’re given the opportunity to rename the site  
before you pin it to the Start screen.
Once you tap the Pin to Start button, the site is pinned. You’ll need to manually 
leave Internet Explorer to see this, however, so press the Windows key on your key-
board (or access the Start option in the Charms bar) to return to the Start screen. Since 
all newly pinned items are added to the end of the Start screen—on the far right—you’ll 
need to scroll over there to see the pinned site. This can be seen in Figure 7-24.
From here, you can perform basically two different actions. You can move the 
pinned website tile to a new location or you can unpin it.
C ROSSREF  ​Start screen customization is discussed in Chapter 5.
Pinned site tiles can provide simple alphanumeric notification badges just like 
they can on the taskbar, with the canonical example being an e‑mail service that dis-
plays the number of unread e‑mails. But the tiles for pinned websites simply aren’t as 
expressive as those for Metro-style apps can be.

236
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
 
Figure 7-24: All newly pinned items are placed at the end of the  
Start screen by default.
Within the browser, however, pinned sites also offer another feature borrowed 
from pinned taskbar sites: Jump lists. So if you tap that site tile, you’ll notice that 
IE Metro loads with a slightly different user interface, assuming that the pinned site 
utilizes jump lists: The Pin to Start button in the navigation bar has been replaced by 
a new menu button. And if you click this button, you’ll see whatever jump list the site 
provides, as shown in Figure 7-25. (The items in this menu will vary from site to site.)
 
Figure 7-25: A jump list displayed in IE Metro

237
Internet Explorer 10 for Metro
If you’re familiar with pinned sites in IE 9 and Windows 7, you know that they run 
in their own browser frame. But this isn’t the case with IE 10 Metro and Windows 8. 
Instead, these pinned sites load inside the same IE Metro app as any other web pages, 
and they will load alongside whatever other tabs were already open in the browser.
Configuring IE 10 Metro
The Metro version of Internet Explorer 10 is configured just like all other Metro-style 
apps, via the globally available Settings pane. To activate this pane, swipe in from 
the right of the screen to display the Charms bar and then tap Settings. IE 10 Metro 
settings can be found at the top of the Settings pane, as shown in Figure 7-26.
 
Figure 7-26: IE 10 for Metro settings can be accessed from the Settings pane.
Internet Explorer Settings is accessed by tapping the Settings link. As you can 
see in the aggregated view of this unique interface shown in Figure 7-27, which most 
likely won’t be completely viewable on your screen and will need to be scrolled verti-
cally to see all the options, there’s a lot going on here.
Available settings include the following:
Delete Browsing History:

passwords. Unfortunately, there’s no way to delete the contents of just one; 
it’s an all-or-nothing, one-click option.

to request location information from visitors in an effort to offer a personal-
ized, location-based experience (or, more nefariously, advertisements). By 
default, IE 10 will trigger a notification when such a request is made. But you 
can turn off this behavior—and thus allow all sites to automatically grab your 
location data—if you’d like. A separate Clear button lets you clear the list of 
sites for whom you’ve OK’d location data, once again triggering those notifica-
tions each time a location request comes in.
 
Figure 7-27: Internet Explorer Settings
Zoom:

By default, Internet Explorer displays web pages normally, at a zoom 
level of 100 percent. But depending on the resolution and size of the screen 
(or, with a tablet, the device itself), you may want to configure the browser 
to always display items a bit bigger, or smaller. That’s where Zoom comes in. 
You can zoom as low as 60 percent, and as high as 260 percent, and thanks to 
Windows’ amazing text rendering capabilities, the results will be readable 
and surprisingly clear regardless of which zoom setting you choose. But this 
feature is particularly useful for high DPI displays (smaller screens with very 
high resolutions, typically), because normally displayed websites will look 
too small.
NO TE ​ ​Zoom is one of those features that makes IE 10 for Metro more palatable 
on a big screen display. Just set the zoom level to 140 or 160 percent and enjoy 
the big-screen goodness. You can see a typical zoomed website in Figure 7-28.

This new IE 10 feature—also available separately in the desktop

sending some information to Microsoft to work, this feature is opt-in and dis-
abled by default.

While you won’t need to muck around with this option very much, 
you should head here if you visit websites where the text isn’t displaying

Using the Desktop Version of Internet 
Explorer 10
The Metro-style version of Internet Explorer 10 is obviously big news because it’s a 
key component of converting users over to the new Metro environment and its touch-
first apps. For the majority of Windows users, however, or those with traditional 
desktop PCs and laptops, Internet Explorer 10 Metro is decidedly less well-optimized 
for the input devices they’re using and are comfortable with.
More to the point, it’s also lacking some key functionality, such as the ability to run 
in a floating window alongside other applications on the desktop. It can’t run add-ons 

240
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
or browser extensions, including ActiveX controls. And while it supports pinning favor-
ite sites to the Start screen, those pinned sites don’t take on their own app-like iden-
tity, as do sites you pin (to the taskbar) with the desktop version of Internet Explorer.
So it’s no surprise that IE Metro’s less adventurous cousin is going to get the nod 
from a very large number of Windows 8 users. But that said, there’s just aren’t many 
new features in this version of IE. If you’re used to Internet Explorer 9 already, IE 10 
will be very familiar.
Under the hood, Microsoft has been thoroughly overhauling the engines that 
drive the browser’s HTML, CSS (cascading style sheet), and JavaScript rendering: 
the three core technologies that enable today’s more standards-compliant web. 
Where IE was once the laughing stock of the web standards world, IE 9, and now  
to an even greater degree, IE 10, is not only performing well, but it’s leading  
the way.
Without getting too deep into the technical miasma that are web standards, 
this leadership takes two forms. The first is an ability to accurately render the 
various features that web standards bodies recognize as being key parts of the 
most relevant building blocks of modern web standards—those HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript bits. A web developer should be able to target these standards—and 
not be forced to write to individual browsers and browser versions—and know that 
what they create will simply work.
The second form of Internet Explorer leadership over competing browsers is per-
formance. One of the most amazing transitions we’ve witnessed in recent years is the 
methodical remaking of Internet Explorer’s rendering capabilities from being soft-
ware driven to being pervasively hardware accelerated. This means that any modern 
PC can offload the rendering of virtually any o-screen element in the browser from 
the PC’s microprocessor to its graphics processing unit, or GPU. The result is better 
performance, better battery life, and less general overhead for the system. It’s not 
just a win-win. It’s a win-win-win.
NO TE ​ ​What’s a “modern” PC? Basically, any PC that was manufactured to 
run Windows Vista or newer. So any PC that was made since 2006 qualifies for 
purposes of this discussion.
As far as you and other Windows 8 users are concerned, what really matters is that 
the browser starts up quickly, runs reliably and with good performance, and renders 
the sites you visit accurately.

Configuring IE 10 Desktop
Configuring IE 10 Desktop
The configuration of the desktop version of Internet Explorer hasn’t changed much 
over the years because it mostly still occurs through Internet Options, which is still 
accessible via Control Panel (try Start Screen Search) or from within IE itself via 
Tools, Internet Options. Either way, you’ll see a window like the one in Figure 7-29.
 
Figure 7-29: Internet Options

launch it from Control Panel and Internet Options when you do so from IE. Ah, 
Microsoft, thy name is consistency.
Since we’re all adults here, we won’t step through every single option in this com-
plex and multi-tabbed window. But there are some new and/or important options 
that every IE user should at least be made aware of:

While the Metro version of Internet 
Explorer 10 lets you delete temporary files, history, cookies, and saved pass-
words in one fell swoop only, the desktop version features a far more granular 
control in which you can choose which of the following to delete: temporary

far more powerful and useful. (Where: General tab, Browsing history, Delete.)

If Internet Explorer is configured as the default 
browser—a feature we examine in a moment—you can choose which of the 
two IE 10 browsers to use for opening links in other programs. This can even 
override the default browser behavior, so you might configure IE Metro as the 
default but choose to open all external links in the desktop version. (Where: 
Programs tab, Opening Internet Explorer.)
Manage add-ons:

Unlike IE Metro, the desktop version can be extended with 
an amazing array of add-ons. You manage them through the logically named 
Manage Add-ons interface. (Where: Programs tab, Manage add-ons, Manage 
add-ons.)
NO TE ​ ​You can also launch Manage Add-ons from the Tools menu in IE.
Where IE Metro and Desktop Meet...and Don’t
As we discussed previously in this chapter, it’s very easy to launch the desktop ver-
sion of Internet Explorer from the Metro version: Just tap the Page tools button in 
the navigation bar, and then View on the desktop to load the currently displayed web 
page in the desktop version of the browser. You may want to do this when you run 
into a web page that won’t work in IE Metro, perhaps because it expects an add-on of 
some kind.
In such cases, you’ll see some content that isn’t displaying correctly, along with 
a message like that shown in Figure 7-30 indicating that the site would load properly 
only if you downloaded the appropriate add-on. This happens most frequently with 
Adobe Flash (though many such sites do work in IE Metro) and (irony alert) Microsoft 
Silverlight based sites.
Don’t be fooled by this. Yes, you can follow the supplied link and, yes, you can down-
load and then install the appropriate add-on. (This will happen in the desktop environ-
ment, which is perhaps a clue to the futility of this action.) But when you do, the add-on 
is only installed in the desktop version of IE. When you return to IE Metro and reload the 
page, you’ll get the same message about needing to download the add-on.
If you deselect

IE 10 and Default Browser Selection
 
Figure 7-30: When good sites go bad: Browser add-ons won’t run in IE Metro.
We wish IE Metro were a bit more sophisticated about this. But you’ll quickly 
learn, and remember, that IE Metro can’t work with add-ons. So you’ll have to do 
something different, like load that page in desktop IE and see if it just works. 
Chances are it will.
OK, so you know how to handle the situations where you’re in IE Metro and want 
(or need) to load a page from desktop IE. But what about launching IE Metro from 
desktop IE?
Unfortunately, there’s no direct way to open a page you’re viewing in IE for desktop 
in IE Metro. But if you really want to do this for some reason, the simplest way is to just 
copy the URL of the page, switch to IE Metro, and paste it into the IE Metro address bar. 
As always, keyboard shortcuts are your friend: Alt + D will select the One Box/address 
bar in either browser, and Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V can be used to copy and then paste, 
respectively.
IE 10 and Default Browser Selection
Before moving on from our look at web browsing and Windows 8, there’s a final, some-
what uncomfortable topic to discuss. And that’s what happens when you change the 
default web browser in Windows 8 to anything other than the Metro version of Inter-
net Explorer. Trust us; this is going to get weird.

244
C h a p t e r  7    Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 10
First, understand that in a clean, unchanged install of Windows 8, the Metro-
style version of Internet Explorer 10 is indeed the default browser. This means that 
anytime a web browser is needed by the OS, another Metro-style app, or a desktop 
application, IE 10 Metro is invoked.
Likewise, in this default configuration, you will find an IE 10 Metro tile on the 
Windows 8 Start screen. What you won’t find, curiously, is an IE 10 desktop tile. And 
there is no way to add an IE 10 tile to the desktop when IE 10 Metro is the default. 
That’s just the way it is.
Unfortunately, Windows 8 is oftentimes not configured in this way. And of course, 
you can change things yourself. So let’s look at some of the scenarios in which IE 10 
Metro is not the default browser, and see what happens.
You Change the Default Browser to IE 10 Desktop
If you’d rather use the desktop version of IE 10 as the default browser and not IE 10 
Metro, you can do so by accessing Internet Options from within IE 10 desktop as 
described earlier in the chapter. Then navigate to the Programs tab and change the 
Choose how you open links option to Always in Internet Explorer in the desktop.
And if you want the desktop IE tile on the Start screen (and any pinned websites) to 
open desktop IE instead of IE Metro, also check the box titled Open Internet Explorer 
tiles on the desktop.
When you perform both of these steps, IE Metro, for all intents and purposes, is 
removed from your system. It’s not literally gone, of course; it’s just inaccessible. 
And it will remain so until you change those settings back.
You Configure a Third-Party Web Browser 
as the Default Browser
Like previous Windows versions, Windows 8 allows you to install your choice of third-
party browsers. But when you do so, things can change with IE 10, depending on how 
the other browsers are configured.
Specifically, if you configure a third-party browser—Google Chrome or Mozilla 
Firefox for example—to be the default browser in Windows 8, the Metro version of 
Internet Explorer disappears.
You can see the change on the Start screen: The tile for IE has changed to a tile for 
desktop IE, not IE Metro.
The only way  
3
3
to return IE Metro 
is to make IE the 
default browser in 
Default Programs 
again.

245
Summary
You Upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7 and Can’t 
Find IE Metro
If you upgrade a Windows 7–based PC to Windows 8, you may notice that the IE tile 
on the Start screen is for the desktop version of IE 10 and not for the Metro version 
as expected. This is for the same reason as stated earlier, and you had configured a 
different browser as the default browser before upgrading. So Windows 8 hides IE 10 
Metro. Again, to return IE as the default, you will need to access the Default Programs 
interface.
Summary
If ever there were a poster child for the dual—one might say dueling—nature of the 
Windows 8 user experiences, it’s Internet Explorer 10. As with the OS on which it 
runs, Internet Explorer 10 offers two separate but complementary user experiences: 
a standard Windows application that runs in the desktop environment and a touch-
first, Metro-style app.
The Metro-style version of Internet Explorer 10 works best on tablets and other 
touch-based devices, offering all of the gesture support you’d expect combined with 
the best features of the desktop browser.
For users on traditional PCs, or those who prefer the more full-featured desktop 
versions, Internet Explorer 10 builds on the improvements of previous IE versions, 
offering better performance, better web standards support, and, of course, some 
great integration with the Metro browser.
The strangest part of this dual browser experience, perhaps, is understanding 
how each of these products works with the other and, more confusingly, with third-
party browsers. Here, the dual nature of Internet Explorer becomes more confusing 
than complementary. But with a little bit of understanding, you’ll be able to config-
ure your PC to work with the browser or browsers you prefer.

Throughout its decades-long existence, Windows has been  
known primarily for its use as the basis for the PC productivity workhorse, and it has 
long included a suite of useful productivity applications. These applications have 
always ranged from marginally useful to truly useful depending on the version of  
Windows and the tool in question. But with Windows 8, you are given a truly impressive 
arsenal of useful Metro-style productivity apps and, of course, traditional Windows 
applications.

C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
This chapter examines the new Metro-style apps that Microsoft includes with 
Windows 8 and RT, whether they’re acquired with a new PC purchase or downloaded 
separately from the Windows Store. These include new contacts, e‑mail, calendaring, 
and messaging solutions that replace legacy Windows Live applications, as well as 
useful new apps for cloud storage access, PDF reading and annotation, mapping, and 
more. This chapter also briefly examines the Office 2013 applications—Word RT, Excel 
RT, PowerPoint RT, and OneNote RT—which come exclusively with Windows RT, the 
ARM-based variant of Windows 8.
It’s Going to Change
Thanks to the dynamic nature of its new apps platform, the Metro-style apps 
that Microsoft includes with Windows 8/RT will change over time, so it’s highly 
likely that the apps described in this chapter will appear somewhat differently 
over time and will include additional features. This is normal, and as a general 
statement, it’s probably fair to say that the Metro-style productivity apps you 
use will provide a superset of the functionality we describe in this chapter.
A Note About the Windows Productivity 
Apps and Your Microsoft Account
Before we can discuss the individual productivity apps that are considered part of the 
full Windows 8 experience, you need to be aware that many of these apps—including 
the core People, Mail, Calendar, and Messaging apps—all rely on connectivity with 
your Microsoft account, or what used to be called a Windows Live ID. You may recall 
from previous discussions in this book that we strongly recommend using a Microsoft 
account for your sign-in with Windows 8 instead of an old-fashioned local account 
because that former account type provides such useful integration capabilities. But 
we realize that some of you will ignore this advice, either because you feel you know 
better or because you simply don’t have a choice, perhaps because the Windows 8 PC 
you’re using is supplied by work or for other reasons.

249
A Note About the Windows Productivity Apps and Your Microsoft Account
If that’s the case, the first time you launch People, Mail, Calendar, or Messaging, 
you will be asked to sign in to your Microsoft account, as shown in Figure 8-1. There 
is no way to use these four apps otherwise, because they are, by nature, what we call 
connected apps, or apps that offer no disconnected-only experience. (Microsoft calls 
them communications apps.)
 
Figure 8-1: You will sign in to your Microsoft account. Oh yes, you will.
That is, they rely on online services in ways that are pervasive and necessary. So 
with People, you will not manage contacts that are local to that one PC. Instead, you 
will manage contacts that are stored in one or more cloud-based services. Ditto for 
Mail, Calendar, and Messaging. None of these apps works only with local data. (In 
fact, none work with local data at all.)
Microsoft first took this approach with Windows Phone back in 2010, and it was 
somewhat controversial at the time. Some users, familiar with local personal infor-
mation stores like that provided by traditional Windows applications such as Micro-
soft Outlook didn’t understand the benefits of centralized, cloud-based data storage, 
or were perhaps suspicious of such services or unwilling to change. With Windows 8, 
however—and with Windows Phone 8 as well, for that matter—Microsoft has leapt 
firmly into this connected future. And while you’re still welcome to use old-fashioned 
applications that lock data to a single hard drive on a single PC, the software giant 
won’t help you do so with its own Metro-style apps in Windows 8.
We recognize that this will still be somewhat controversial with an increasingly 
smaller group of people who resist change for whatever reason. But we also believe 
that Microsoft’s approach with Windows 8 is correct. And having long ago adopted 
this cloud-based model, we’re excited to access our data from anywhere now using 
Windows 8. We suspect most of you are as well.
Don’t confuse 
3
3
“connected” with 
“online.” Some of 
these apps do work 
when the PC is 
offline. But they 
all rely on online 
services, not local-
only data.

People
When you sign in to Windows 8 for the first time with a Microsoft account, a number 
of interesting things happen behind the scenes, including the ability to sync settings 
between PCs. But Windows 8 also provides this account information to apps, includ-
ing the core productivity apps that one might want to use with an online account, like 
Mail, Calendar, Messaging, and People. That latter app, based on the People hub that 
appeared first in Windows Phone, is Windows 8’s new contacts management app. And 
it provides a nice interface for aggregating the contact lists from multiple accounts, 
providing a single view into them all, and thus for all the people you know and interact 
with each day.
The People app is shown in Figure 8-2.
 
Figure 8-2: The People app helps you manage your contacts.
The People app also provides a nice, Metro-style view of all of the activities that 
your contacts are doing online, culled from the various feeds that are associated 
with their accounts. This can include sources such as Windows Live, Facebook, 
Twitter, and more, and includes the ability to comment on what others are doing.
Finally, you can also use the People app to view and edit your own online persona, 
which is the way other people view you out in the world.
This app is 
3
3
called the People 
hub on Windows 
Phone, but it looks 
and works similarly.

251
People
Understanding the People App
Like all Metro-style apps, the People app is a full-screen experience with a nice layout 
that automatically flows according to the size and pixel density of your display. This 
app consists of the main view and several other views, including:
Social: 
3
3
A timeline-like view of your contacts’ activities across all of the 
connected online services.
Me:
3
3
 Here, you can view and edit your own online persona.
Notifications: 
3
3
A list of notifications from each of the connected online 
services.
What’s new: 
3
3
The latest activities from across the connected activities.
You can switch to the other views by clicking (or tapping) the appropriate 
headings or tiles in the People app’s main view.
The People app also provides an app bar that is hidden by default. Its functionality 
varies by view and is described in the appropriate sections later in this chapter. But as 
always, this app bar can be enabled by right-clicking any on-screen empty space with 
the mouse, by swiping toward the center of the screen from the top or left edge, or by 
typing Winkey + Z.
The People app is also designed to be snapped, utilizing a new feature of the 
Metro environment that allows one app to be used as a secondary app next to 
another Metro-style app or the Windows desktop. As you can see in Figure 8-3,  
the snapped view of the People app provides a handy miniaturized version of the 
full app.

Managing Accounts
While you may have many contacts and other information associated with your 
Microsoft account, it’s as likely that you use other account types for e‑mail, con-
tacts, calendar, and task management too. And for this reason, the People app is 
one of a few places in Windows 8 from which you can configure other accounts as 
well. Configurable account types include:
Facebook: 
3
3
The world’s most popular social networking service, Facebook is a 
great way to keep up with your friends’ and families’ activities. In Windows 8, 
the People app will pull information from your Facebook friends list (that is, 
contacts) and provide a look at their activities in the What’s new view.
Twitter: 
3
3
This very popular micro-blogging service has emerged as a social 
networking wunderkind in its own right, providing numerous feed types, 
topic searching, and follower and following lists. Twitter posts, called tweets, 
will appear in the What’s new view.
LinkedIn: 
3
3
Popular with upwardly mobile, white collar wage earners,  
LinkedIn is the social network for those who wish to keep up with  
co-workers and professional contacts. The People app integrates with  
your LinkedIn contact lists.
Microsoft/Hotmail:
3
3
 Microsoft’s popular web-based mail service is the basis 
for most people’s Microsoft accounts, and since Windows 8 uses this account 
as your sign-in by default, chances are you’ve already configured one. Hotmail 
provides e‑mail, contacts, calendaring, and task services, and as with the 
Google account type, each surfaces in the appropriate Windows 8 apps. The 
People app, as you’d expect, integrates with your Hotmail contact list.
Exchange: 
3
3
The People app can connect natively to Exchange and Exchange-
type accounts, meaning those that utilize the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) 
technologies, a de facto standard for mobile devices. Generally speaking, you 
will use this account type for any account that utilizes Exchange Server, Office 
365, or something similar, all of which offer e‑mail, contacts, calendaring, and 
task management. The People app provides integrated access to Exchange or 
EAS-based contacts.
Google: 
3
3
The world’s largest Internet company provides excellent e‑mail and 
contacts (Gmail) and calendaring and tasks (Google Calendar) services, and 
this account type will connect each to the appropriate apps in Windows 8. 
The People app accesses your Gmail account’s contact list.
Microsoft is 
3
3
in the process of 
replacing Hotmail 
with a new web-
based e-mail service 
called Outlook.com. 
It works similarly  
to Hotmail.

253
People
To configure an account, click the appropriate account type under Add people to 
your contact list and follow the steps requested. Each account addition occurs via a 
full-screen notification-type interface like the one shown in Figure 8-4.
 
Figure 8-4: Adding a new account to Windows 8
If this account isn’t present, you can access the Accounts interface from the 
Settings pane. Shown in Figure 8-5, this pane can be reached in a variety of ways, 
including by typing Winkey + I, swiping in from the right edge of the screen, and 
tapping Settings, or by using the Metro-style mouse hotspot for the Charms bar 
and then clicking Settings.
Click Accounts to view Accounts settings, which lets you access and add additional 
account types. The Accounts settings interface is shown in Figure 8-6.
You can also 
3

delete accounts 
from here, though 
it’s not particularly 
obvious. Just  
right-click the 
account you’d like  
to delete—or tap  
and hold—and  
choose Delete from 
the menu that 
appears.

Managing Contacts
Managing accounts is usually a one-time thing. For the most part, you’ll be interact-
ing with contacts while using the People app. And the nice thing about this app is that 
all of your contacts, aggregated from multiple accounts, can be accessed in a single 
location. From here, you can perform a number of useful activities related to contacts.
Interacting with Your Contacts
If you manually launch the People app, you’ll be presented with the app’s main view, 
which lists all of your contacts in two groups. If you’ve configured any contacts as 
favorites, as described a bit later, those contacts will appear on the left.
The default view is pretty basic, and pretty obvious. But there is a fun hidden 
feature that makes it much easier to navigate through a huge list of contacts: Just 
tap any letter. To jump to the contacts that start with F, for example, just type F. 
The view will change, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: You can quickly jump through the contact lists by typing a letter.

255
People
To view the details for an individual contact, simply select that contact from the 
list. What you see here will vary pretty wildly based on a number of factors, including 
which account(s) to which the contact is attached and what information you or they 
have provided, but it should resemble Figure 8-8.
 
Figure 8-8: A typical contact card
Some of the information that can be associated with a contact includes:
Contact information: 
3
3
Name, associated account(s), address, and so on, but also 
actionable options such as Send e‑mail, Send message, Map address, and more.
What’s new: 
3
3
A list of the contact’s activities, culled from one or more accounts.
Photos:
3
3
 A collection of the contact’s photos, culled from one or more accounts.
For both What’s new and Photos, the views are not just read-only: You can comment 
on posts and photos, and even “like” items, just as you might if you accessed Facebook 
or Twitter manually.
NO TE ​ ​If you have duplicate contacts—two contact cards with the same 
information—you can also link them together. View one of the duplicates, 
display the app bar, and choose Link.
Editing a Contact
To edit a contact’s information, right-click anywhere while viewing a contact card and 
then choose Edit from the app bar. A new view called Edit contact info will appear, as 
shown in Figure 8-9.

256

Figure 8-9: You can easily edit a contact’s information.
Edit the information as needed and then click Save in the app bar to save the 
changes.
Adding a New Contact
You can also add a new contact, of course. To do so, display the app bar while in the 
People app’s main view and click the New button. (It resembles a “+” sign.)
This interface is fairly obvious and similar to the Edit screen mentioned previously, 
but the one area to call out is the Account drop-down list: This interface determines 
which account will store the new contact. By default, People will use your Microsoft 
account for all new contacts, but you can change that on the fly if you prefer to associ-
ate it with another account.
Adding a Contact to Favorites
The Windows 8 People app, like previous Microsoft contacts management solutions such 
as Windows Live Messenger and the Windows Phone People hub, supports the notion of 
favorite contacts. Favorite contacts, or Favorites, are provided a special and prominent 
location in the main view of the People app, so you can access them more easily.
To add a contact to favorites, open that person’s contact view, display the app bar, 
and then click Favorite. When you return to the main view of the app, that contact 
will have been added to the favorites area on the left.

257
People
NO TE ​ ​To remove a contact from favorites, simply visit the person’s contact 
card, display the app bar, and toggle the Favorites button again. Bam, they’re 
off the island.
Pinning a Contact to Start
If you find yourself interacting with a certain contact frequently, you can pin that 
person’s contact tile to your Start screen for quick access. To do so, open that per-
son’s contact view, display the app bar, and then click Pin to Start. You’ll be shown 
a preview of the tile, as shown in Figure 8-10, and be provided with a chance to edit 
the tile name.
 
Figure 8-10: Pinning a contact to the Start screen
To view the new tile, return to the Start screen and navigate to the end (right 
side). As you can see in Figure 8-11, your contact now appears in live tile form on 
your Start screen.
And it is indeed live, and not just a static picture. By default, the contact’s live tile 
will animate and will display recent activities culled from their What’s new feed. You 
can, of course, disable that effect: Simply right-click the tile and choose Turn off live 
tile from the app bar that appears. (You can also unpin the tile from this interface.) 
Other possible configuration options include moving the tile to a new location, perhaps 
in a new or existing tile group.

Figure 8-11: A frequently-accessed contact appearing as a  
live tile on the Start screen
Search: Finding Contacts
Like many other Metro-style apps, the People app supports the system-wide Search 
contract, so you can use this capability to find a particular contact whether you’re 
currently in the app or not.
To search from within People, type Winkey + Q. This displays the standard Search 
pane, with the People app selected. Now, just type part of the name of a contact you’d 
like to find. When you press Enter, the search results appear within the People app, as 
shown in Figure 8-12.
What’s amazing about these new system-wide Metro features, of course, is that 
you don’t even have to be using People to search for contacts. In fact, you can do so 
from anywhere in Windows 8: the Start screen, another Metro-style app, or even from 
the desktop.

259
People
 
Figure 8-12: Search from within People.
To see this in action, return to the Windows desktop (Winkey + D) and tap Win-
key + Q. The Search pane appears as expected, so start typing part of the name of a 
contact you’d like to find. But this time, instead of just typing Enter, select People 
from the list of apps. Voila! The search results are returned in the People app.
Seeing What’s New with Your Friends, Family,  
Co-Workers, and Other Contacts
In addition to functioning as a super-powered address book, the People app also 
provides a What’s new feed that aggregates content from Facebook, Twitter, and 
other accounts. It’s a one-stop shop where you can find out what’s going on with 
your friends, family, and other contacts, no matter where they’re posting informa-
tion. The What’s new view is shown in Figure 8-13.
What’s new provides a decidedly Metro-y take on this sort of information, with 
each post segregated into a tile-like space. Scrolling occurs horizontally—that is, left 
to right—and not vertically, as with document-based applications. And while the app 
will refresh this view periodically, you can refresh it yourself by enabling the app bar 
and clicking the Refresh button.
One of the neatest things you can do, of course, is interact with your contacts by 
leaving comments and other feedback to their posts. What you can do varies from 
account type to account type. For example, you can also choose to “like” a Facebook 

260
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
post, mark a Twitter “tweet” as a favorite, or “retweet” something you see on Twit-
ter. To do any of this, find a post you like and click it. It will display full screen, as in 
Figure 8-14, providing a more complete view that includes others’ comments as well 
as whatever actions are available.
 
Figure 8-13: The What’s new view provides a way to easily keep up with your friends and other 
contacts’ activities.

261
People
Then, tap the Add a comment box on the bottom to add a comment. You can 
optionally click a Like, Favorite, or Retweet button if available, again depending 
on the account to which the post was made.
Viewing Your Digital Persona . . . And Creating 
Your Own Posts
In addition to your contacts and their aggregated activities view, People provides 
a handy front end for managing your own digital persona, or the online account or 
accounts that establish you as an entity that can perform tasks and establish rela-
tionships with others. Called Me and shown in Figure 8-15, this interface is to you as 
the What’s new view is to others, a look at what’s going on . . .with you.
 
Figure 8-15: The Me view is all about you.
In this view, you can see and edit your own contact information via the View 
profile link, view your own What’s new feed, which is culled from whatever online 
accounts you’ve configured, view and deal with pending notifications, and view 
the photos you’ve recently posted to social networks and other accounts.
Most important, perhaps, you can also use this interface to post to supported 
social networks. If you have more than one configured, you’ll see a drop-down letting 
you choose the service you want to use, and a text box labeled “What’s on your mind?” 
where you can type in your new post.

C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
Mail
It’s perhaps surprising that the Windows 8 Mail app is a big-screen version of the 
mobile Mail app that first debuted in Windows Phone, providing access to multiple 
e‑mail accounts using an interface that’s optimized for bigger, touch-enabled 
screens. It utilizes common e‑mail features like attachments, CC and BCC support, 
and the reading of textual and graphical e‑mails. It also works in either portrait or 
horizontal display modes, so you can manage mail the way you want to.
Understanding the Mail App
Mail provides a three-pane view, as shown in Figure 8-16, where you can see the 
major elements of the app’s primary user interface.
 
Figure 8-16: The Mail app
These elements include:
Accounts pane:

This leftmost pane provides access to each configured 
account and to the e‑mail folders contained within each. (Only the folders 
for the currently selected account are shown.) The number of unread mes-
sages will appear next to the Inbox folder heading. Or, if you have multiple 
accounts, next to the link for that account. In Figure 8-17, you can see the 
accounts pane in Mail as it looks configured for three different accounts.

occur through Mail’s

it’s missing a few typical features one might be expecting. Key among these, 
perhaps, is the ability to drag and drop, such as you might do to move mes-
sages from one folder to another: This capability simply doesn’t exist in Mail, 
and if you’re used to managing mail in, say, Windows Live Mail, Outlook, or even 
web-based solutions like Hotmail or Office 365, it takes some getting used to. 
Remember: Metro-style apps work like—are, in fact—mobile apps, so they follow 
some usage patterns that may seem out of place on a full-featured PC.
Managing Accounts
While Windows 8 supports numerous account types as explained in the previous 
section about the People app, only a few of them—Hotmail, Google, and Exchange 
(which handles Exchange Server, Office 365, many other Exchange ActiveSync-based 
account types), and IMAP—provide e‑mail support that works with the Mail app. Put 
another way, the Mail app functions much like a mobile device mail application and 
not like a full-featured desktop application such as Outlook. It’s basically just an 
EAS e‑mail app—Hotmail and Google use EAS behind the scenes to sync with mobile 
devices—though to be fair, it’s more accurately described as a connected mail app, 
since it does also work with IMAP-based e‑mail accounts too.
This design has its pros and cons, but the end result is that Mail, like Windows 8, 
is forward leaning, and not all that concerned with legacy e‑mail solutions based on 
out-of-date technologies like POP3. If you need that kind of support, you will have to 
look elsewhere.
The first time you use Mail, you’ll see a little box in the bottom of the Accounts 
pane that explains how you add accounts and provides a link for doing so. But you 
can add accounts at any time by visiting the Settings pane, as with other Metro apps. 

265
Mail
To display that pane, press Winkey + I, or find it via the Charms bar, and then click 
Accounts. You will see a display much like that in Figure 8-18, listing the accounts 
you’ve already configured.
 
Figure 8-18: Mail accounts settings
To add a new account, click Add an account. Then, in the next screen, choose 
among the available account types; Hotmail, Google, Exchange, or Other Account. 
Account creation occurs as it does in the People app, via a full-screen Metro-style 
notification like the one in Figure 8-19.
 
Figure 8-19: Adding a new e‑mail account
Note that if you need to configure an IMAP-type e‑mail account, you will want to use 
Other Account as the account type and then click the Show more details link to enter the 
appropriate server information.
To manage an existing account, navigate to Settings, Accounts and then click 
the account you wish to edit. You’ll see a pane like that in Figure 8-20.

Managing E‑mail
Once your various accounts are all configured, you can begin using Mail normally, as 
you would with any other mail application. Things work mostly as expected, though 
there are a few unique aspects to this application you should be aware of.
First, there’s no centralized, linked inbox view as there is on Windows Phone 
and other mobile e‑mail clients. Instead, each account is accessed separately, with 
its own inbox and set of folders. So if you are using multiple accounts, you can jump 
back and forth through the Accounts pane.
As a Metro experience, the Mail app makes it a bit ponderous to select multiple 
e‑mails in the Mailbox folder pane and then act on them as a single unit. For example, 
suppose you want to select three e‑mails and then move them to a new folder. To do so 
in Mail, you must right-click each e‑mail to select them in turn—a small check box will 
appear in each e‑mail header to indicate the selection, as shown in Figure 8-22—and 
then select the appropriate command—in this case, Move—from the app bar.
 
Figure 8-22: Selecting multiple e‑mails
You can multi-

e‑mail messages 
as you would other 
objects in Windows, 
such as files in the

you wish to select and, 
while pressing the  
Shift key, select  
the last. Voila!

C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
When you do select Move, most of the Mail app visually fades away, aside from the 
Folders view, so you can choose where you’d like to move the e‑mail.
Sending and Receiving New Mail
Mail retrieval happens automatically and, as noted previously, the schedule can be 
configured on an account-by-account basis. But you can always manually check for 
mail at any time if you’re the disbelieving type: Display the app bar and tap Sync.
Responding to or Forwarding an E‑mail
Microsoft overloads the Respond button in the upper right of the Mail app with three 
related and useful commands: Reply, Reply all, and Forward. When you tap this button, 
a small pop-up menu appears, offering those options.
If you find this too ponderous—which it certainly can be—you can use keyboard 
shortcuts instead: Ctrl + R for Reply, Ctrl + Shift + R for Reply all, and Ctrl + F for Forward.
Writing an E‑mail
When you write a new e‑mail or respond to an e‑mail you’ve received, Mail first 
provides the view in Figure 8-23.
 
Figure 8-23: A plethora of options are available for e‑mails you write with Mail.
The following options are available initially:
Account:

If you’ve configured two or more e‑mail accounts, you can choose 
from which to send the message, using a drop-down box.
To:

 The e‑mail recipient. Mail will use auto-complete as you type, comparing 
the name or e‑mail address you’re typing with the contacts in the People app. 
If you’ve configured an Exchange-type account, you can also use the drop-
down that appears to search your workplace’s user directory.

Click this button to save a draft of the current message.

This most interesting of commands triggers a Metro-style file

filesystem locations—Documents, Pictures, Music, and the like—and apps 
that surface files from online services, including Camera, Photos, and Sky-
Drive, which is shown in Figure 8-24.

Searching for E‑mail
As with the People app, you search your e‑mail using the system-wide Search capa-
bility, or contract. Put more succinctly, you search for content in the Mail app. This 
works as it does everywhere else in Metro: Just type Winkey + Q from within the Mail 

271
Mail
app, or do so from anywhere in the system and then choose Mail from the list of apps 
on the right. This displays the standard Search pane.
Now, just type in a search term. This can be part of an e‑mail message or subject 
line, or the name of a person who has sent you e‑mail (or received e‑mail from you). 
When you tap Enter, the search results appear within the Message pane of the cur-
rently selected account in the Mail app, as shown in Figure 8-26.
 
Figure 8-26: Search for e‑mail from anywhere in Windows 8.
Note that Search provides a history list of previously performed searches, and 
that this history is app-specific. So when you search from Mail, this Mail-specific 
history list appears below the Search box so you can re-do the search at any time.
Configuring the Mail App
Aside from the accounts settings discussed previously, the Mail app offers only a 
handful of other interesting configuration choices. You can configure the following 
features through the Permissions choice in this pane:
Notifications: 
3
3
This toggle determines on an app-wide basis whether Mail can 
trigger “toast”-style notifications every time a new e‑mail arrives.
Lock screen:
3
3
 By default, the Windows 8 lock screen will provide a simple Mail 
icon with a number indicating how many new, unread e‑mails are available. 
(It is similar to the behavior in Windows Phone, actually.) For this feature to 
work, of course, Mail has to be running in the background. And if you’d prefer 
for that not to happen, you can disable it here.
C ROSSREF  ​You can configure which of the available lock screen icon spots is 
used by Mail by visiting PC Settings, Personalize, Lock screen. We discuss this 
and other personalization features in Chapter 5.
Note, however, 
3
3
that when this 
is enabled, you 
can still determine 
whether each 
account triggers 
these notifications 
individually. (You do so 
through the settings 
for each account.)

Snap: Sharing the Screen with Mail App
As with other Metro apps, Mail supports the Metro Snap view, by which you can 
dock, or snap, the app to the left or right side of the screen and use it alongside 
another Metro-style app or the Windows desktop. Frankly, it’s not horrible when 
you consider the amount of information this app displays normally. But because 
of the thin, 320-pixel-wide area afforded to snap apps, Mail can only show a single 
pane at a time in this view. You can see this effect in Figure 8-27.
 
Figure 8-27: Mail in snapped view
You can navigate between the Accounts, Messages, and Reading pane views, 
though many e‑mail messages are difficult, if not impossible, to read in this view 
because of the horizontal space limitations. The best reason to consider snapping 
Mail is for those times when you’re working in another app, or on the desktop, but 
you want to keep an eye on Mail for some reason. When the e‑mail you want does 
arrive, you can simply unsnap the app and view it full screen instead.
Calendar
Microsoft provides several excellent calendaring services through its Hotmail and 
Exchange technologies, with the latter surfacing not just in traditional, enterprise-
based versions of Exchange Server but also in the far more affordable and accessible 

273
Calendar
Office 365 service. Powering these services on the back end is a Microsoft technology 
called Exchange ActiveSync (EAS), which provides push-based support for e‑mail, 
contacts, tasks, and, yes, calendaring. EAS is a de facto industry standard, it’s used 
even by Microsoft competitors such as Apple and Google, and it’s at the heart of 
Microsoft’s new Calendar app.
Like the Windows Phone app on which it is based, Calendar is a connected cal-
endar, one that is designed to work in concert with one or more online calendars, 
in this case calendars that are provided using EAS technologies. So it works with 
Microsoft calendars such as Hotmail Calendar and Exchange/Office 365, of course, 
but also calendars from other companies, such as Google Calendar.
If you set up Windows 8 to sign in with a Microsoft account as we recommended 
early on in the book (and you did, right?), then you already have a Hotmail Calendar. 
And that calendar is automatically available through the Calendar app. You can, of 
course, configure other calendars as well.
Understanding Calendar
Calendar offers a simple, full-screen, Metro-style interface. The default display, shown 
in Figure 8-28, provides a look at your schedule using a month view.
To see more options, as always, you right-click any empty space on the screen (or, 
with touch, swipe toward the middle of the screen from the top or bottom edge of the 
screen). When you do so, Calendar’s app bar appears as shown in Figure 8-29.
 
Figure 8-28: Calendar app

274
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
The Day, Week, and Month app bar buttons are used to change the view. For example, 
the week view will resemble Figure 8-30.
 
Figure 8-29: Calendar’s app bar
 
Figure 8-30: Calendar’s week view
You can also navigate through your schedule using browser-like “back” and “for-
ward” commands. To move back or forward in time through your schedule, you can swipe 
the screen in either direction or use the Internet Explorer-like keyboard shortcuts Ctrl 
+ Left Arrow and Ctrl + Right Arrow (for back and forward, respectively). Or, when you 
move the mouse around on-screen, you’ll see small navigational arrows appear near the 
top left and top right of the screen. Click one to navigate in either direction.
These browser-like navigational movements take place within the context of the 
current view. So when you go back while viewing your schedule in week view, you go 
back to last week. Go forward while using day view and you will navigate to tomorrow. 
It’s all very logical.
Of course, you may sometimes find yourself lost in the schedule, or at least 
so far in the future or past that navigating manually to the current date will be 
tedious. Fortunately, in this case, Calendar provides a handy Today button in the 
app bar. Just click that to return to the current day, week, or month, depending  
on the view you’ve chosen.

275
Calendar
Managing Accounts
A calendar is only valuable to you if it holds your schedule, so the first order of business 
is getting this app connected to the calendar service you use. The choices are somewhat 
limited because Calendar supports EAS-based calendars only.
To access the account management interface, you must display the Calendar 
settings pane. As with any Metro-style app, you do so by typing Winkey + I, or by 
activating the Charms bar with the mouse or touch and then choosing Settings.
The Calendar settings pane, provides only a few options, including Accounts, 
which is what you’re concerned with here. (Another useful entry, Options, will be 
discussed later in the chapter.)
In the Accounts view that appears, you’ll see a list of configured accounts—just 
Hotmail by default—and an Add an account link, as in Figure 8-31. Click that, and 
you’ll be offered the supported account types.
Since this works as it does in Mail, there’s  
no need to belabor the point, and indeed, 
accounts you configure here will be configured 
for you in Mail (and People), and vice versa.
Calendar lets you configure multiple 
accounts, of course, and the events associ-
ated with each account will be color coded in 
the application. (You can change these colors 
through Settings, Options, as described later 
in the chapter.) Additionally, you can configure 
multiple accounts of the same type. So if you 
have two Hotmail accounts, for example, you 
can easily configure Calendar to display  
the schedule from both.
NO TE ​ ​When you configure an EAS-type account in People, Mail, or Calendar, 
that account is automatically made available to the other apps as well. So if 
you added a Gmail account to Mail earlier, its corresponding Google Calendar-
based schedule will already appear in Calendar too.
Working with Events
Once you start viewing your various calendars in the Windows 8 Calendar app, you’ll 
probably want to use this interface to manage your various events as well. And as you

to events as 
“appointments.” 
The terms are 
interchangeable.

276
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
might expect, Calendar offers some useful functionality around creating and view-
ing events, as well as how you can be reminded about pending events.
To create a new event, open the Calendar app bar and tap New. (This button 
resembles a “+” sign.) You’ll see the view in Figure 8-32, which provides a plethora  
of items to configure.
 
Figure 8-32: The new event view
These items, which have been nicely simplified using plain language, include:
When:

A number of Metro-style fields that let you configure a date for the

changes the Details pane of the new event view to include an End date area 
where you can configure the exact date and time the event will end.

 Also on the right side is an expansive message area that lets you

You can also

create a new event.
While some

support rich text 
and even graphics

apparently never

You can only use 
plain text here.

277
Calendar
Oddly, unlike the New Mail screen in the Mail app, this screen doesn’t provide an 
app bar or any options related to formatting.
To save the event, just click the Save button. Or cancel it by clicking the Cancel 
button.
Dealing with Reminders
Like other Metro-style apps, Calendar provides notifications using the standard, system-
level notifications that you see from time to time. As you may know, Windows 8 offers 
two basic notification types, full-screen warnings and pop-up toast notifications that 
appear in a thin strip near the top right of the screen. Calendar uses the latter type, and 
at the configured time, you’ll see a Calendar notification toast appear, as in Figure 8-33. 
Click the toast and Calendar will load so you can view more details about the event.
 
Figure 8-33: Calendar notification toast
Configuring Calendar Options
Calendar offers some useful configuration  
options. To view and modify them, visit  
Settings, Options, and you’ll see an Options  
pane like that in Figure 8-34.
Here, you can determine on a  
calendar-by-calendar basis whether to display 
that calendar’s events in Calendar and what 
color you wish to use to display that calendar. 
Note that calendar sources with multiple cal-
endars will show an entry for each calendar.
Snapping Calendar
Like other Metro-style apps, Calendar supports 
the Metro Snap capability, so you can snap it 
in a subordinate position on-screen next to 
Figure 8-34: Calendar Options.

278
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
another Metro-style app or the Windows desktop. Unlike some Metro-style apps, how-
ever, Calendar works quite well in this arrangement, providing a customized layout 
that matches the thin area provided quite nicely.
As you can see in Figure 8-35, the snapped Calendar app provides a thumbnail 
view of the month as well as any events that are occurring today. You can also click 
other days in the month view to see the events for those days.
 
Figure 8-35: Calendar snapped next to the desktop
Two additional commands are available via the snapped Calendar’s app bar: Go to 
today in the calendar and Add a new event. When you choose the latter, you get the 
nice snapped version of the new event screen shown in Figure 8-36.
 
Figure 8-36: The new event view, snapped

type Ctrl + T to 
“go to today” in 
Calendar, whether 
it’s in snapped view 
or the normal full-
screen mode.  
Ctrl + N works in 
snapped view, too,  
for creating a  
new event.

Calendar
Lock Screen and Live Tile Use
Because of the nature of the Calendar app and the underlying calendar services 
it utilizes, this is a very interesting example of where the Windows 8 integra-
tion strategy makes a lot of sense. That is, while you can absolutely open the 
Calendar app to view your events and manage your schedule, oftentimes you 
simply won’t need to. And that’s because the Calendar app is very deeply inte-
grated into Windows 8.
In the previous section, we discussed how the Calendar app can provide notifica-
tions that alert you to pending events no matter where you are in the system—Start 
screen, Metro-style app, or the Windows desktop—or what you’re doing. But Calendar 
also provides at-a-glance calendaring information in other key places in the Windows 8 
user interface, such as the Lock and Start screens.
Lock Screen
The expressive new Windows 8 lock screen provides a ton of useful information at a 
glance, including the date and time, the number of pending e‑mails, your network 
connectivity, and so on. But Calendar is awarded a special capability on the lock 
screen: When configured properly, you can see the title, location, and duration of 
your next event, as shown in Figure 8-37.
Let’s review the three configuration interfaces you could access to change this 
behavior.
The first is the Calendar settings pane. If you access this interface (easiest way: 
Winkey + I from within the app) and click Permissions, you’ll see an option there that 
allows this app to run in the background and display information on the lock screen. 
This option must be set to On for this functionality to work.
 
Figure 8-37: Calendar event information on the lock screen

280
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
The second place is in PC Settings, the new Metro-style control panel. If you 
access this interface (Winkey + C, Settings, More PC settings) and navigate to  
Personalize, Lock screen, as shown in Figure 8-38, you will see some pertinent  
settings for Calendar.
 
Figure 8-38: In PC Settings, you can configure how Calendar works with the lock screen.
Under the Lock screen apps area, you’ll see that Windows 8 allows you to config-
ure up to seven Metro-style apps that can run in the background and provide quick 
status and notifications. But below that is a very interesting option: You can config-
ure a single app to display detailed status information. If Calendar isn’t chosen here, 
click the “+” icon and choose Calendar from the pop-up list.
If you’re still not seeing Calendar events on the lock screen, there’s one last place 
to check. In PC Settings, navigate to Notifications and then ensure that the option 
Show app notifications on the lock screen is set to On.
C ROSSREF  ​Windows 8 offers far too many ways to customize the system, but 
we cover this functionality in Chapter 5 if you can’t get enough.
Live Tile on the Start Screen
If you’re using the Start screen as a dashboard of sorts, you know that most Metro-
style apps provide live tiles that provide ongoing, app-related updates. In the case of 
Calendar, this functionality is quite useful, as the app’s live tile will animate through 
the day’s pending events as you watch. The Calendar live tile, shown in Figure 8-39, is 
quite expressive.

281
Messaging
Of course, if you misconfigure things, the  
live tile could be very static. But you can check 
the live tile properties easily enough to make 
sure it’s configured to your liking. To do so, 
right-click the Calendar live tile and consider 
the commands that appear in the app bar at the 
bottom of the screen, as in Figure 8-40.
 
Figure 8-40: The Calendar live tile settings
Unpin from Start:

Here, you can remove the Calendar live tile if you don’t 
wish to use it anymore.
Uninstall:

 Calendar can only display live updates when it’s set to the 
larger (rectangular) tile size. If you set it to the smaller (square) size, it will 
simply animate between static displays.
Turn live tile off/on:

3
 You can use this command to toggle whether live 
updates appear on the tile’s surface. By default, this is set to on.
Messaging
If you’re familiar with Windows Phone, you know that Microsoft’s smartphone plat-
form sports an excellent unified messaging client called—wait for it—Messaging 
that lets you communicate with others via services such as SMS, MMS, Windows 
Live Messenger, and Facebook, all via a single interface. That Messaging client uses 
color-coded threads to differentiate between conversations you have, regardless of 
the service used, and you can switch back and forth between the available services 
depending on which services your contacts use as well. It’s a nice little app that 
Figure 8-39: The Calendar live tile

282
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
integrates well with the underlying OS, popping-up notification toasts if you’re doing 
something else and a new message arrives.
NO TE ​ ​SMS stands for Short Message Service and is used for text messaging, 
while MMS stands for Multimedia Messaging Service and can be used for shar-
ing video, photos, and other multimedia content.
The Messaging app for Windows 8 works in much the same way, though there are 
some key differences between the two. The biggest is that the Messaging app for 
Windows 8 does not support cell phone/smartphone services such as SMS and MMS, 
since these occur over carrier networks and almost always incur additional fees.
Though these the two apps work similarly, those who are familiar with Windows 
Live Messenger for Windows might consider Messaging to be its Metro-styled equiva-
lent, or even replacement. That’s because Messaging works with the same basic two 
services as does Windows Live Messenger: Windows Live and Facebook.
Understanding Messaging
Messaging provides a simple, full-screen interface like that shown in Figure 8-41.
On the left, you will find a Threads pane that contains the various threads, or 
conversations, you have (or are currently having) with others. Each contact will have 
their own thread, so each time you communicate with the same person, the new con-
versations will be appended to the previous ones.
 
Figure 8-41: Messaging

283
Messaging
The Threads pane also includes a prominent New message link which lets you 
start a new conversation with a contact.
On the right of the application window is the large Messages pane, which shows 
you the conversations that have occurred in the currently selected thread. At the 
bottom of the window is a box in which you can type a message. When you tap Enter, 
that message is added to the currently selected conversation and thread.
When you activate the Messaging app bar—by right-clicking a blank area of the 
screen, tapping Winkey + Z, or swiping toward the center of the screen from the top 
or bottom edge—a few additional commands are revealed.

: This button allows you to set your online status, which is how you 
will appear to other contacts in their own messaging applications. Available 
choices in the pop-up menu that appears when this button is clicked include 
Available (what we used to call “online”) and Invisible (“appear offline”).
Invite:

This button triggers a pop-up menu with two choices, Add a new friend 
and View invites.
Delete:

 This command lets you delete the currently selected thread. It will 
delete the entire thread, and not any individual part of the thread.
Managing Accounts
Messaging is primarily a Microsoft Messaging (formerly Windows Live Messaging) 
client, and as such it will be automatically configured to access this service if you 
sign in to your PC using a Microsoft account as we recommend. That said, you can 
also connect to Facebook’s messaging service (as you can from Windows Live Mes-
senger), and we suspect other services will come on board over time, thanks to the 
Windows 8 extensibility features.
Accounts are added and managed in Messaging as they are in other Metro-style 
apps like People, Mail, and Calendar, through Settings, Accounts. Unlike other apps, 
however, Messaging does not support multiple Messaging or Facebook accounts: You 
get only one of each.
Working with Threads
To start a new messaging thread, click the New message link. The unique People 
chooser interface will appear, as shown in Figure 8-42.

284
C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
 
Figure 8-42: The People chooser lets you pick a contact to communicate with.
The People chooser is very interesting, because it connects to whatever Metro-
style apps that have registered with the system to provide access to contacts, or the 
People app by default. But as more such apps become available, you’ll be able to choose 
contacts from those apps, too, using the drop-down control to the right of the People 
title in the chooser.
The chooser is also smart about which contacts to show you. That is, it doesn’t 
provide you with a rote list of every single contact you have. Instead, it only shows you 
those contacts that are connected to a compatible service. You can optionally toggle 
the view between all of these contacts and only those who are currently online.
Once you’ve selected a contact, you return to the main Messaging view. If you’ve not 
yet communicated with the selected contact, a new thread will be created. If you have, 
the new messages you’ll exchange will be appended to the end of your existing thread.
Messages within a thread follow a logical form, using rectangular conversation 
“bubbles” that are similar to those in other messaging apps, such as the one in Windows 
Phone. Each time you hit Enter, that message—contained in its own bubble—is com-
pleted and sent to your contact.
Handling Notifications
Since most people won’t want to stare at the Messaging screen and wait for a new 
message to arrive, Messaging supports the standard Windows 8 notifications capa-
bilities and will provide pop-up notification “toasts”—along with a corresponding 
notification sound—whenever a new message does appear. These toast notifications 

285
Messaging
will appear briefly on-screen, near the top-right corner, no matter where you are in 
the system, on the Start screen, while using a different Metro-style app, or on the 
Windows desktop. A typical Messaging notification can be seen in Figure 8-43.
 
Figure 8-43: Messaging notifications  
appear over other Windows 8 experiences.
NO TE ​ ​This is probably obvious, but Messaging notifications will not appear when 
you’re using Messaging. If you receive a message from another contact outside of 
the thread you’re currently viewing, Messaging will do one of two things:
If a thread already exists for that contact, the thread is moved to the top of 
3
3
the threads list.
Otherwise, a new thread is created and added to the top of the threads list.
3
3
To deal with a Messaging notification, just click it and you’ll be brought into the 
Messaging app where you can read the entire message and reply if necessary.
Of course, notifications are, by definition, interruptions and you may want to 
configure the way the system deals with notifications globally or for Messaging 
particularly.
As with other apps, you can configure some notification settings in Settings, 
Permissions, including whether Messaging notifications are enabled in Windows 
and on the lock screen.
Notifications can also be globally and 
temporarily toggled on or off using the Set-
tings pane. To access this interface, type 
Winkey + I or open the Charms bar and then 
select Settings. From this interface, you 
can select the Notifications icon near the 
bottom of the pane to toggle this function-
ality, as shown in Figure 8-44.
That functionality is nice from time to  
time, such as when you’re busy working and 
don’t want to be disturbed. But as you use 
Figure 8-44: Notifications can be 
toggled globally, on the fly, using this icon.

Windows 8 more and more, you may find that you want to change the way Messaging 
notifications work going forward. This happens via the new PC Settings interface. 
(You can reach PC Settings at any time by accessing the Settings pane and selecting 
More PC settings.)
A few relevant options here include:
Notification sounds: 
3
3
We happen to find the chime that rings each time a 
notification appears to be annoying. If you do too, change the option titled 
Play notification sounds to Off.
Show individual app notifications:
3
3
 You can determine whether individual 
Metro-style apps, including Messenger, can even display notification toasts. 
Given the nature of this app, we recommend leaving notifications on for 
Messaging. But if you’re not interested, you can disable this behavior.
Snapping Messaging
Messaging provides a reasonably useful snapped experience by which you can snap 
the app to the left or right side of the screen alongside another Metro-style app or the 
Windows desktop. In this mode, only one of Messaging’s panes can be seen at a time, 
as shown in Figure 8-45.
 
Figure 8-45: Messaging app in snapped mode
Most Messaging functions work just fine in this mode. You can view individual 
message threads, add messages to an existing thread, and, via the hidden app bar, 
change your status or start a new message thread.

SkyDrive
SkyDrive
For years, Microsoft has offered a cloud storage service called SkyDrive that has 
offered an industry-best allotment of free online storage—7 GB most recently—but 
few ways to use it effectively. As a result, SkyDrive had been largely ignored by the 
computer-using public, while competing offerings from Apple (iCloud), Amazon 
(Cloud Player and Cloud Drive), and Google (Google Play and Google Drive) have 
grabbed all the headlines.
That’s changed. And while there are many reasons why SkyDrive is central not 
only to Microsoft’s vision for Windows 8 specifically, but also for all of its consumer-
oriented offerings generally, here’s one pertinent fact that may drive this home 
nicely. Windows 8 doesn’t provide a way to browse the local filesystem from the new 
Metro environment. But it does offer a way to browse your SkyDrive storage, and the 
SkyDrive app is a neat little solution for those of us with our heads—well, our data at 
least—in the clouds.
SkyDrive Requires a Microsoft Account Sign-In
There is one important consideration with the SkyDrive app. We mentioned early 
in the chapter that the People, Mail, Calendar, and Messaging apps require you 
to sign in with a Microsoft account, though you can do so even if you’re signing 
in to the PC with a traditional local account. The SkyDrive app does not allow 
this: To use this app, you must sign in to the PC with a Microsoft account. To 
change how you sign in, you can visit PC settings, Users, and then select Switch 
to a Microsoft account. (Or, if you’re using a domain account, you can connect a 
Microsoft account to that domain account.)
Understanding the SkyDrive App
The SkyDrive user interface, shown in Figure 8-46, replicates the folder structure of 
your SkyDrive storage.
To understand how this is so, compare it to the web-based view of the same 
SkyDrive account, which is shown in Figure 8-47. Restyled to resemble the Metro 
app, the SkyDrive web interface also utilizes Metro-style elements to represent 
folders and files, providing a more consistent experience.
SkyDrive has 
3
3
had a few names 
over the years, 
including Windows 
Live SkyDrive.  
Today, however, 
it’s referred to as 
Microsoft SkyDrive, 
or simply SkyDrive.
You can also 
3
3
install the SkyDrive 
application for 
the Windows 
desktop and view 
and manage your 
SkyDrive-based 
storage from there.

C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
 
Figure 8-46: The SkyDrive app
 
Figure 8-47: SkyDrive on the web now resembles the Metro SkyDrive app too.
Navigate inside one of the folders in the SkyDrive app and you’ll see a similar 
Metro treatment applied to documents as well. In Figure 8-48, you can see a Sky-
Drive-based folder that contains both subfolders, on the left, and documents and 
other files, which are displayed on the right.
 
Figure 8-48: Documents in the SkyDrive app

289
SkyDrive
Beyond that, SkyDrive offers browser-like navigational controls, including a 
large, obviously placed “Back” icon in the top left of the screen. Keyboarders can also 
use the browser-based Alt + Left Arrow shortcut to navigate back if they’d like.
As with other picker-style Metro user experiences, there’s a subtle widget next to 
the SkyDrive title. Click this widget, which resembles a downward-facing arrow, and 
a small menu, or jump list, appears, as shown in Figure 8-49. This menu lets you jump 
to frequently needed locations, including the root of your SkyDrive storage as well as 
virtual views such as recent documents and shared documents.
 
Figure 8-49: SkyDrive’s jump list
Opening and Editing Documents and Other Files
To open a document, simply tap (or click, or otherwise select) it. Some document 
types, like PDF files, will open in the Metro-style app, or Windows desktop application, 
that is associated with that file type. However, some behave a bit differently than 
expected. For example, Office documents—Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and 
PowerPoint presentations—as well as OneNote notebooks open in the SkyDrive-based 
Office Web Apps instead. This can be seen in Figure 8-50.
When viewing a folder full of photos, as shown in Figure 8-51, SkyDrive provides a 
more compelling and panoramic view of the folder contents.
But there’s still little you can do beyond viewing individual photos: No slideshow 
is available, and you can’t even manually switch from photo to photo in a pleasant 
full-screen view.
Copying Files from SkyDrive to the PC
To copy (or download) a document, photo, or other file from your SkyDrive storage to 
the PC, simply select it and then display the app bar (Winkey + Z is quickest). Then, 
select the Download button, which can be seen in Figure 8-52. You can perform this 
action on individual files or multiple files.
Would you 
3

prefer to open 
that document in 
Microsoft Office on 
your PC? You’ll have 
to download it first, 
as discussed next.

Copying Files from the PC to SkyDrive
To copy (or upload) a document, photo, or other file from your PC to SkyDrive, navigate 
to the destination location in SkyDrive, display the app bar and then select the Add 
button. A File picker screen will appear, allowing you to select one or more files from 
your local filesystem, as well as from various Metro-style apps that are connected to 
online services of their own.

SkyDrive
 
Figure 8-52: You can download SkyDrive-based files using the app bar.
As you select files to upload, they are added to the File picker’s basket, which 
runs along the bottom of the screen. This basket lets you collect files from various 
locations and then upload only when you’ve gotten all the files you want, no matter 
where they’re found throughout your PC’s filesystem and potentially on other storage 
services in the cloud.
Sharing Files from SkyDrive
To share files from SkyDrive, you use the system-wide, Metro-style sharing mecha-
nism that’s available to all apps. Simply open the Share pane (via the Charms bar, 
or with the Winkey + H keyboard shortcut) and you can share the currently selected 
document, photo, or other file via any apps that are configured to offer this capabil-
ity. In Figure 8-53, you can see that Mail and People are available for sharing the 
currently selected document.

Windows Reader
After fighting against the tide of Adobe’s popular PDF document format for years, 
Microsoft has finally given in and created its own Windows PDF reader app. Dubbed 
Windows Reader, this great little app works as expected and is a lightweight and fast 
alternative to Adobe’s bloated Reader application, even for those who prefer to stick 
largely with desktop applications.
Windows Reader presents a very simple full-screen interface, like many Metro-style 
apps, but some interesting features are revealed, as always, by activating the app bar 
(Winkey + Z, swipe toward the center of the screen from the top or bottom edge, or right-
click anywhere). Windows Reader is shown in Figure 8-54 with its app bar displayed.
 
Figure 8-54: Windows Reader with its app bar displayed
Windows Reader provides the following features related to PDF document viewing:
Zoom: 
3
3
In any of the available view styles, you can zoom in and out to better see 
the document. Zooming works as it does elsewhere in Metro: Via pinching on 
touch-based systems, with Ctrl + - (zoom out) and Ctrl + + (zoom in) keyboard 
shortcuts, or by holding down the Ctrl key and using your mouse’s scroll wheel.
NO TE ​ ​Zoom out enough and you’ll see a nice thumbnail view.

app bar work like toggles so that only one can be on at a time. In Two pages

Microsoft’s aborted

The Bing Apps
One page view, only one whole page will be seen at a time and you must use 
the app’s navigational controls (discussed next) to move from page to page. In 
Continuous view, only one whole page will be seen at a time, but you can scroll 
through the document continuously, with the start of the next page being 
visually attached to the end of the current page.
Navigation: 
3
3
In Two pages and One page view, you can swipe left and right, use 
the left and right arrow keys, or click the pop-up navigational controls that 
appear to move through the document.
In Continuous view, navigation works differently. That is, instead of behaving 
like a standard Metro-style app with horizontal navigation, it behaves like a 
traditional document-based Windows application and utilizes vertical navi-
gation instead. In this mode, you can move through the document by swiping 
up and down, by using the up and down arrow keys, or by utilizing the scroll 
bars that appear on the right side of the application.
Find: 
3
3
By using the Find button in Reader’s app bar, you can search for text 
within the current document. This interface supplies Previous and Next but-
tons so you can find individual references to the search text, and an optional 
results pane, that calls out each instance of the search text in the document 
for quick navigation.
Annotations: 
3
3
You can make annotations (but not edits) to a PDF document 
with Reader by selecting a block of text, right-clicking, and choosing High-
light (to add a colored highlight to the text) or Add a note (to embed a note in 
the PDF). You can then save the changes to the original PDF or to a copy.
Rotate: 
3
3
If you’ve ever gotten a PDF file that seems to be visually sideways, you 
know how useful this command can be.
Print:

Since Windows Reader is a document-based app, you may actually want 
to make a hard copy from time to time. That works as it does elsewhere in the 
Metro environment: You access the Devices charm (Winkey + C, Devices) and 
then select the appropriate printer from the list. Or, access the printer list 
directly with Ctrl + P.
The Bing Apps
In Windows 8, Microsoft has adapted many excellent Bing services into Metro-style 
apps. And while some of them are worth only a passing mention, one app in this group, 
Bing Maps, is quite useful.
This right-click

Bing Maps
As it does for Windows Phone, Microsoft provides an excellent Bing Maps app for 
Windows 8 that brings the beautiful and useful Bing location and directions func-
tionality to a new generation of Windows PCs and devices. You’re welcome to use 
Maps on any PC, of course, but it works best on highly mobile devices such as tablets 
and hybrid portable computers that have pervasive Internet connectivity, perhaps 
via a cellular-type connection, and of course a GPS sensor.
NO TE ​ ​We’ll often refer to Bing Maps simply as Maps, and it is that latter, simpler 
name that is used in the user interface.
It won’t be surprising, perhaps, that Bing Maps prompts you to access your location 
information before running for the first time, as shown in Figure 8-55.
 
Figure 8-55: Bing Maps needs access to your location for fairly obvious reasons.
Once your location is available, Maps will then zoom into your current location, 
using a nice animation that’s the hallmark of Bing Maps across the web and various 
mobile implementations.
All Over the Map: Navigating with Bing Maps
Maps works much as expected, and much like other Metro-style apps, with a clean inter-
face and most options hidden in an app bar. You can swipe around on-screen to move the 

295
The Bing Apps
view in various directions, or, on a mouse-based system, simply “grab” the map with the 
mouse cursor and then move the mouse in any direction to achieve the same effect.
For keyboard users, there’s a neat navigational shortcut that’s not immediately 
obvious. Simply tapping the arrow keys does nothing. But if you hold down the Ctrl key 
and then tap an arrow key, the map will navigate one-half-screen’s worth in that direc-
tion. Type Ctrl + Left Arrow, for example, will navigate a bit to the west. (How much will 
depend on the current zoom level.)
Speaking of zoom, this functionality works as expected as well. On touch-based 
systems, you can pinch to zoom out and reverse-pinch (or double-tap) to zoom in. Mouse 
users can access the on-screen zoom controls that appear in  
the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 8-56. You can  
also use the mouse’s scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
Keyboard users can zoom with Ctrl + - (zoom out) and  
Ctrl + “+” for zoom in (which is to say, Ctrl, Shift, and “+”).
If you get lost, you can always find your current location  
by selecting the My Location button on the app bar. (If it’s  
hidden, you can display the app bar by tapping Winkey + Z,  
right-clicking, or by tapping and holding.)
Changing the Look of Maps
You can change the look of the Maps presentation in two ways:
Show Traffic: 
3
3
By default, Maps doesn’t muddy up the view with traffic indi-
cations—roads that are colored green, orange or red depending on the traffic 
level—but this is obviously useful information if you’re using the app on the 
go. To enable this display, activate the app bar if necessary and tap Show 
Traffic in the app bar. The view will change to reflect the current traffic con-
ditions, always excellent in the Boston area. To disable this display, simply 
toggle Show Traffic again.
Map Style:
3
3
 Maps supports two display styles, Road View, which is the default, 
and Aerial View. You can toggle this view with the Map Style button in the 
app bar.
Find Your Own Location
If Maps gets lost for some reason, you can use the My location button in the app bar to 
find yourself again. Simple.
Figure 8-56: No touch? 
No problem: You can still 
zoom with a mouse!

C h a p t e r  8    Get It Done with Windows 8’s Productivity Apps
Finding a Location
To find a particular location with Bing Maps, you use the system-wide Search contract 
functionality, available from the Search pane. There are many ways to display this 
pane, but the simplest, perhaps, is to type Winkey + Q; mouse or touch users can display 
the Charms instead and then choose Search.
To search, simply type a location name into the search box and press Enter (or 
select the Search button). When you do, Bing Maps will likely navigate to the exact 
location, unless you’ve been too vague. A direct hit can be seen in Figure 8-57.
 
Figure 8-57: Find a location with Bing Maps.
Bing Maps utilizes Bing’s search technologies on the back end, so you might 
expect searching to be fairly granular. It’s not. Yes, you can use paris france to find 
Paris, France. And if you type in las vegas, Bing Maps will zoom right to Las Vegas, 
Nevada. But if you meant Las Vegas, New Mexico—or Paris, Texas, for that matter—
you’ll need to be more specific. Or, you can use a neat option that appears in the app 
bar after a location has been found: You’ll see a new More results button that will dis-
play other possibilities. (You can also use the Refine button to refine your search, or 
the Clear button to start over.)
Getting Directions
Where Bing Maps really shines is in its ability to help you find your way. If you want 
to get directions, click the Directions button in the app bar to display the Directions 
pane shown in Figure 8-58.

297
The Bing Apps
Then, you can enter starting and ending  
locations in the provided boxes. The first will 
default to current location, which is exactly 
what it sounds like. And if you want to 
reverse the directions, tap the directional 
button at the right of the top box.
When you’re ready to get the directions, 
click Enter (or tap the right arrow icon to the 
right of the bottom box). Bing will think for 
a bit and then provide its attractive, full-
screen driving directions as shown  
in Figure 8-59.
 
Figure 8-59: Getting from here to there with Bing Maps
You can zoom into parts of the route by clicking, tapping, or otherwise selecting 
individual parts of the route display at the top of the screen. And the printed version 
of the Bing Maps directions is particularly nice: You access this interface, as always 
through Charms, Devices, and then the appropriate printer. The Print pane can be 
seen in Figure 8-60.
You can also use the Clear Map button to exit from this display.

Bing Finance, News, Sports, and Weather
Microsoft also provides four very similar looking apps, Bing Finance, News, Sports, 
and Weather, which take the notion of a news aggregator and turn it into something 
truly beautiful and useful. Each obviously focuses on its own core topic, with Finance 
providing a gorgeous front end to the stock market and financial news and topics, 
News providing a general purpose news experience, Sports taking on locale-specific 
sports news of note, and Weather doing its best to make the weather look gorgeous, 
no matter how ugly it gets outside.
Since each is so similar from a presentation perspective, let’s just look at one, Sports, 
to see how something basic can be made to look so beautiful. In Figure 8-63, you can see 
the Sports landing page, which provides beautiful, magazine-style photography and 
layout.
Scroll over to the right and you’ll see other top stories from the day, highlighted 
again in a highly visual style with a nice layout as in Figure 8-64.
Each of the apps is fully customizable in some way. In Sports, for example, you can 
follow your favorite sports, teams, or players. And in Weather, of course, you can con-
figure the weather display for your favorite places, and even pin individual weather 
tiles for each on the Windows 8 Start screen.

Microsoft Office Comes to Windows . . . Sort Of
Over the years, we’ve been struck by how many people seem confused by the relation-
ship between Microsoft’s two most successful product franchises, Windows and Office. 
That is, many people believe that Office is “part” of Windows and that these two very 

301
Microsoft Office Comes to Windows . . . Sort Of
separate software solutions are thus one. And some are surprised when they reinstall 
Windows, or get a new PC, to discover that Office is no longer present. So we’ve spent a 
lot of time trying to educate people about the differences between Windows and Office, 
and how they are separately acquired.
To be fair, the reason so many people believed that Windows and Office came 
together is that, for many, they did. Most people acquire both Windows and Office 
together with a new PC purchase and thus don’t draw a distinction between the two. 
The problem is, if you’re not paying attention at the time of that PC purchase, you 
may not get Office at all, or you may get a version of Office that you don’t want.
Also, during the life cycle of Windows 7, many PCs came with a stripped-down 
Office version called Office Starter that included two very basic Office applications, 
Word Starter and Excel Starter. This solution came free with many PCs and was 
designed to be electronically upgraded to higher-end, paid versions of Office.
With Windows 8—and a new family of Office products branded as Office 
2013—Microsoft is completely changing the equation. The ARM-based versions of 
Windows 8, called Windows RT, actually do come with a special version of Office 2013, 
and while this freebie Office version doesn’t offer all of the power and flexibility of 
the high-end Office 2013 suites, it’s a far cry from the basic experience previously 
offered by Office Starter. (Office Starter is no longer available.) Office 2013 for Win-
dows RT version includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, and if you purchase 
any Windows RT-based device, you’ll get these powerful applications for free.
As you may recall, with Windows 8 and RT, Microsoft has divided the PC market 
somewhat with two complementary Windows 8 families of products, one of which 
runs on traditional PCs (and, confusingly, device-like tablet PCs) based on familiar 
Intel x86/x64 and compatible chipsets. But there are also versions of Windows 8 that 
run on the ARM platform, which is typically used on very thin, light, and elegant 
portable devices similar to Apple’s iPad. Those Windows 8 versions, collectively called 
Windows RT, do include the Microsoft Office applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
and OneNote. So that’s something to consider when you’re shopping for a device.
NO TE ​ ​Why do Windows RT devices include Office you ask? Though Windows RT 
looks and works much like traditional x86 versions of Windows 8, it is not com-
patible with traditional Windows desktop applications like Office. So Microsoft 
has made a special version of Office just for Windows RT, while focusing mostly 
on Metro-style apps going forward on that platform.

There is some precedence for this product bundling. As long ago as 1995, when 
Microsoft launched the first version of Windows CE, a specially made version of Win-
dows designed to run on non-PC devices of the day, it also bundled basic versions 
of its Office applications, then called Pocket Office, with the tiny machines that ran 
that OS. And through the years, subsequent updates to that product line, including 
Pocket PC and Windows Mobile, also included these Pocket Office applications as part 
of the platform.
And in the modern Windows Phone platform, which is today now based on the 
PC version of Windows 8, Microsoft continues to bundle Office. Windows Phone 8 
includes what’s now called Office Mobile 2013, with portable versions of Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote that provide not just document compatibility and basic 
editing functionality, but also interoperability with Microsoft’s cloud-hosted Office 
document repositories, SkyDrive and SharePoint. So it should be no surprise that 
Windows RT devices—that is, those machines that sit logically between phones and 
“true” (or at least traditional) PCs—would also offer similar functionality.
Expectations for Office on a highly mobile device like a tablet are, of course, 
somewhat reduced compared to those one might have for a solution that runs on a 
full-featured PC. But since many Windows RT and Windows 8-based devices can be 
docked or otherwise transformed into more powerful PCs with keyboards, mice, and 
external screens, the bundling of these applications is all the more interesting for 
those of us who want one device that does it all.
In any event, the bundled version of Office includes the following solutions:
Word:

When you think about word processing, you think about Microsoft 
Word, and while there have been many pretenders throughout the years, none 
have approached the power and utility of Microsoft Word, nor its amazing 
reading experiences. In fact, Word is so good, we used it to write this book.
Excel:

Excel is Microsoft’s spreadsheet solution, and like Word, it dominates 
the market in which it competes. Excel offers all of the number crunching 
functionality you expect and lets you analyze and visualize data in amazing, 
graphical ways.
PowerPoint:

Microsoft’s presentation package is a staple in offices and 
schools around the world, offering professional features, support for amaz-
ing embedded multimedia, and the ability to broadcast to any Internet-
connected PC or device.
OneNote:

Less well known than the other Office applications, perhaps, 
OneNote is ideal for portable devices, offering amazing, cloud-connected 
note-taking capabilities.
Microsoft is

also providing two 
Metro-style Office 
apps with Office 
2013, OneNote and 
Lync. These work with 
both Windows 8 and 
Windows RT.

Summary
Summary
As this chapter ably demonstrates, Windows 8 is a productivity whirlwind, with an 
amazing array of Metro-style apps and traditional desktop applications that will keep 
you up to date, efficient, and working through any conditions. From the new Metro-style 
People, Mail, Calendar, Messaging, SkyDrive, Reader, and Bing offerings like Maps, Bing, 
Finance, News, Sports, and Weather, and more, Windows 8 includes enough in the box 
to keep you busy for a long, long time. Of course, Windows 8 isn’t just about work. And 
in the next two chapters, we’ll examine the fun side of Windows 8, examining its enter-
tainment and game capabilities, respectively.

In the old days, users would manage their media collections on  
their PCs and then sync a subset of their photo, music, and video content with devices 
and share a further subset via discs, USB devices, and online services. While these 
activities are still possible in Windows 8, and will no doubt be quite popular for some 
people, Microsoft is embracing a new way of doing things that more closely mirrors 
related changes in the tech industry.
The new way of doing things was triggered by a technological advance called cloud 
computing. In this new model, your data isn’t stored on a single hard disk on a single PC, 
where it’s inaccessible from other PCs and devices and could potentially suffer from data 
loss because of a catastrophic hardware failure. Instead, the data is stored in the cloud—in 

306
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
powerful, geographically redundant data centers run by major corporations we actu-
ally trust—and is always accessible from any PC or device.
In this new cloud computing model, all of your data is always available on your 
PC, just like before. But now you can pick up almost any other PC or device and still 
access your data seamlessly, because it’s automatically synced for you. Microsoft 
pioneered this new approach with Windows Phone back in 2010, and it’s finally going 
mainstream with Windows 8.
You can see cloud computing’s impact on Windows 8 in many places, from the new 
Microsoft account sign-in to the synced settings and the mobile device–like produc-
tivity apps discussed in the previous chapter. But the system’s photos and entertain-
ment capabilities, related to digital photos, music, and video, are an interesting case. 
This is because Microsoft had previously spent over a decade delivering an increas-
ingly powerful but complex series of applications and services through its Windows 
Media and Zune product lines, to which hundreds of millions of Windows users have 
grown accustomed.
Today, those services are being reorganized under the Xbox entertainment 
brand. Previously, Xbox meant one thing and one thing only, video games. But Xbox 
is evolving into a more general purpose entertainment platform, adding digital 
music and video to its stable of capabilities. (Photos remain separate because users’ 
photos are their own and are not acquired from a central location.)
If you’re not ready to move forward and utilize online services like SkyDrive to store 
your music collection, or rent and buy movies and TV shows from Microsoft’s Xbox-based 
marketplaces, no need to worry; all of the local-based digital media capabilities in 
Windows 7 are still present in Windows 8. But as with the rest of this book, this chapter 
focuses solely on the new capabilities. And in this specific case, that means enjoying 
digital photo, music, and video content in new ways through new Metro experiences.
It’s Going to Change
Thanks to the dynamic nature of its new apps platform, the Metro-style apps 
that Microsoft includes with Windows 8/RT will change over time, so it’s highly 
likely that the apps described in this chapter will appear somewhat differently 
over time and will include additional features. This is normal, and as a general 
statement, it’s probably fair to say that the versions of the Photos, Camera, 
Xbox Music, and Xbox Video apps you use will provide a superset of the func-
tionality we describe in this chapter.

A Note About the Windows 8 Entertainment Apps and Your Microsoft Account
A Note About the Windows 8 Entertainment 
Apps and Your Microsoft Account
In Chapter 8, we discussed how many of Windows 8’s productivity apps are simple 
clients for online services provided by Microsoft and other companies. As such, you 
must sign in to your Microsoft account to access many of these apps, even if you’ve 
elected—against our advice—to not automatically do so by signing in to the PC with 
a Microsoft account.
Photos and Camera actually work fine without a Microsoft account, go figure, but 
as you’ll see, you will need to sign into various online services to use Photos to its full-
est. But Microsoft’s new Metro-style entertainment apps, Xbox Music and Xbox Video 
(and the related Xbox Companion) do require you to sign-in with a Microsoft account 
to be used effectively.
If you have signed in with a Microsoft account, these apps will automatically sign 
into that account as well, tying your PC or device to the Xbox entertainment services 
in the cloud. But if you’ve configured a non-Microsoft account and attempt to run one 
of these apps, you’ll be asked to sign-in with a Microsoft account. You can retain your 
current domain or local account if you’d like, and just sign in to app and app groups 
with a Microsoft account. Or, you could follow our advice from Chapter 12 and do the 
right thing: Sign in with a Microsoft account. Or, if you have a domain account, con-
nect it to a Microsoft account. Signed in with a local account? Convert it.
Both Xbox Music and Xbox Video provide a similar experience for non-Microsoft 
account users. You’ll just see a non-threatening Sign In prompt in the upper-right 
corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 9-1.
 
Figure 9-1: Xbox Music and Video both require a  
Microsoft account to be used fully.
If you don’t sign-in, you’ll only see a tiny subset of the functionality described in 
this chapter. But you’re not going to go through any of that, right? Right.
These apps rely

heavily on online 
services, are less 
full-featured when 
you’re offline; you’ll 
only be able to use 
content stored on 
the machine, your 
own PC-based photos, 
music, and videos, and 
any rented movies or 
purchased TV shows  
or movies.

C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
Enjoying Photos
Windows 8 includes tools for enjoying digital photos on your PC or device, no matter the 
source. That means basic photo-viewing experiences for both Metro and the desktop, 
and ways to acquire (or download) photos from a digital camera, smartphone, memory 
card, or other device. But most Windows 8 PCs and devices will also include more 
advanced tools for editing photos, uploading them to your favorite online service, and 
more. Don’t worry: If you don’t have these tools, we’ll tell you how to get them.
NO TE ​ ​As with elsewhere in the book, we focus only on new features in 
Windows 8, and not on functionality that remains unchanged from previous 
Windows versions. Again, the assumption is that you know how to use Windows 
and want to get up to speed on the new stuff.
Here we look at the photo features in Windows 8, starting with the new Metro-style 
Photos app.
Using the Photos App
The new Photos app is a great way to view your photos, whether they are on the PC, in 
SkyDrive, on your other PCs, or on various third-party online photo sharing services. 
It also provides photo acquisition features, so you can acquire, or “download” photos 
from a digital camera, memory card, or other device.
The Photos app, shown in Figure 9-2, is a typical, full-screen, Metro-style experi-
ence, with large tiles representing the photos on your PC, in various online services, 
and on your other connected PCs.
These sources can include some combination of the following:
Pictures library: 
3
3
Here, you’ll find all of the photos stored in the Pictures 
library on your PC.
SkyDrive: 
3
3
Microsoft’s cloud storage service, SkyDrive, provides 25 GB of free 
storage plus paid annual tiers for those who need even more.
Facebook: 
3
3
The most popular social network on earth is also an increasingly 
common way for people to share photos with friends, family, co-workers, and 
other contacts.
Flickr:
3
3
 Yahoo!’s popular Flickr remains the number one photo-sharing service 
on earth.

Connected PCs:

 If you’ve downloaded and installed the SkyDrive desktop 
application from www.skydrive.com on each of your PCs, you will see the photo 
collections from those PCs listed here as well. In Figure 9-2, for example, Ivy-1 
and Series9 represent other connected PCs.
 
Figure 9-2: Photos app
About Libraries
Microsoft introduced libraries in Windows 7, providing a new way to collect 
related content—documents, music, photos, and videos by default—in virtual 
folders that are really views to two or more physical folder locations on the PC. 
Libraries continue in Windows 8 largely unchanged, and Microsoft provides 
the same four default libraries—Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos—as 
it did in the previous OS version. Likewise, each library aggregates the same 
two physical folders as in Windows 7, in default. So in the case of the Pictures 
library, that means the My Pictures folder that’s part of your user account and 
the Public Pictures folder.
This is all a long way of saying that Windows 8’s basic photo management 
features haven’t changed since Windows 7.
Depending on how you’ve configured your Microsoft account, some of these 
sources will and will not be immediately available. The Pictures library is always 

310
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
available, online or off, and will include whatever photos and other pictures you store 
in your Pictures library. And your SkyDrive source should be automatically config-
ured since your Microsoft account comes with access to SkyDrive storage.
But the other sources, Facebook, Flickr, and your connected PCs, may or may not be 
configured and available. If you took the time to associate your Facebook account with 
your Microsoft account, this source will be set up and ready to go. But if not, you can do 
so now from within Photos. And the process for configuring this account to work with 
Photos is similar to that for Flickr, which has to be performed manually regardless of 
how you’ve configured your Microsoft account. So let’s examine that first.
Configuring Facebook or Flickr Photos
To manually configure Facebook—remember, the process is also very similar for 
Flickr—to work with the Photos app, you will need to visit the app’s Settings pane. 
To do so, tap Winkey + I. (Or, with a touch or mouse interface, display the Charms bar 
and then select Settings.) The Settings pane should resemble Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: Photos Settings
Select Options to display various options related to Photos. Next to both Flickr 
and Facebook, you will see a link titled Options. Click the link for the service you 
wish to configure. (We’re using Facebook in this example, but the process is very 
similar for Flickr.)
Photos will pass you through to the web-based Facebook authentication site 
using Internet Explorer. Here, as shown in Figure 9-4, you will authorize Photos to 
use your Facebook account.

311
Enjoying Photos
 
Figure 9-4: Configuring Photos to work with Facebook
Click Connect with Facebook to connect the Facebook service to the Photos app. 
Once you’ve provided your Facebook credentials, Microsoft will link the two accounts 
and you can return to the Photos app. When you do, you’ll see that a new Facebook 
tile has been added to the app, providing you with access to the photos from that  
service (see Figure 9-5).
 
Figure 9-5: Facebook is now available in Photos.
Again, the way you configure Photos to work with Flickr is identical to what we 
just discussed. So if that’s required, you can connect to your Flickr account in the 
same fashion.
If you don’t use 
3
3
Facebook or Flickr, 
you can actually 
remove these tiles 
from the Photos 
home screen. We 
describe this process 
a bit later in the 
chapter.

312
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
Using SkyDrive to Connect to Other PC Photo Libraries
By this point, you should have Photos configured to work with some combination of 
your local photos, SkyDrive-based photos, and possibly your Facebook and Flickr-based 
photos as well. That’s a lot of photos. But most people have two or more PCs, and if you 
configure these PCs a certain way, you can actually access the photo collections on your 
other PCs—or what we call your connected PC—from any of your PCs.
This assumes that the PCs in question are online, of course. If a connected PC is 
off or asleep, you won’t be able to access its pictures from the Photos app. On the good 
news front, these other PCs don’t have to be on your home network to work: One could 
be in Singapore, for example, and one in Boston, Massachusetts, and you’d still be 
able to make the connection as long as they’re both online.
So how do you connect PCs? There are two requirements:
Microsoft account: 
3
3
You must configure each PC to sign in with the same 
Microsoft account.
SkyDrive application for Windows: 
3
3
You must install the SkyDrive application for 
Windows (not to be confused with the Metro-style SkyDrive app for Windows 8) 
on each PC and configure that application to use a feature called Remote Fetch. 
This feature makes that PC’s files available to you on your other PCs and devices. 
You do this through the SkyDrive application’s Settings window, which can be 
seen in Figure 9-6, and accessed through the app’s system tray icon.
 
Figure 9-6: Make sure the SkyDrive application is configured to share  
its files with other connected PCs.

313
Enjoying Photos
When you do configure your PCs to use SkyDrive’s Remote Fetch feature, the 
photo libraries from those PCs will appear in the Photos app on your other PCs. It’s 
like magic!
Navigating Through Your Pictures Library, SkyDrive, 
Facebook, and Flickr
Once all of your photo sources are configured, you can use the Photos app as it is 
intended: to view your photos, regardless of their location. Well, assuming you’re 
online, that is: When you’re offline, only the Pictures library tile will respond.
Navigation in each source is similar: You’re presented with a horizontally arranged 
list of tiles, each of which represents a folder, file, depending on the source. These tiles 
are in alphabetical order, from left to right, with folders appearing before actual files. 
Consider the view shown in Figure 9-7, which displays the contents of the Pictures 
library.
 
Figure 9-7: Viewing folders in the Pictures library
In this view, you can see two folders, which are represented as tall, rectangular 
tiles and a single photo, which appears in its native aspect ratio. If you find this view 
constrictive, you can view more folders (and files) simultaneously by using semantic 
zoom to pan back the view, resulting in the grid-like layout shown in Figure 9-8. 
Obviously, this option—which is available in virtually all Photos views—is more 
effective (and even necessary) when you have a lot of pictures.

314
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
 
Figure 9-8: You can zoom out to view more photos on-screen at once.
You can enable semantic zoom in a variety of ways. With a touch-based system, 
you use the suddenly common pinching gesture, with two fingers, directly on the 
screen. With a mouse and keyboard, you can hold the Ctrl key and use your mouse’s 
scroll wheel. Or, with just the mouse, click the small minus (“-”) symbol in the bottom 
right of the screen.
And if you zoom enough in the correct direction, you can even use this feature to 
zoom into a photo! (If you do, you can use the small plus (“+”) symbol that appears in 
the lower right to zoom back out as well.
These basic views are true of all the photo sources, but of course each is a bit 
different in its own way. So here’s some information to consider about each:
Pictures library: 
3
3
By default, the Pictures library consists of the contents of two 
locations, My Pictures and Public Pictures, but you can add and remove locations 
as well. Files and folders in a library are mixed together and arranged as one. So 
if you have folders named Alpha and Gamma in your My Pictures folder and then 
one folder named Beta in Public Pictures, they will be arranged alphabetically as 
Alpha, Beta, and then Gamma in the Pictures library in both File Explorer (on the 
Windows desktop) and in the Pictures library view in the Photos app.
SkyDrive: 
3
3
When you access SkyDrive from its normal web interface at skydrive.
com, you’re given the opportunity to configure the “type” of each folder. One of 
those types is Photos. And only folders that are configured as type Photos will 
appear in the Photos app in Windows 8. So if you’re not seeing certain SkyDrive 
photos appear, make sure they’re in a properly configured folder.

315
Enjoying Photos
Facebook: 
3
3
Everyone’s favorite social networking service organizes photos into 
albums, and what you’ll see in the Facebook view in Photos will correspond to 
that. You’ll see common Facebook locations like Cover Photos, Mobile Uploads, 
Wall Photos, and so on, as well as whatever albums you’ve manually created. 
The order here, however, is not alphabetical. Instead, they’re arranged by 
which most recently were accessed.
Flickr: 
3
3
Yahoo’s popular photo-sharing service provides users with a Photo-
stream, which is basically just every photo you’ve ever uploaded. But it also 
provides folder-like containers, including sets, which can be further grouped 
into collections. So you might consider these folders and sub-folders, respec-
tively. Looking at the Flickr view in Photos, you’ll see a tile for your Photo-
stream and then tiles for each collection and set.
Connected PCs:
3
3
 As with your own Picture library, your connected PCs will 
present an aggregated list of folders, sorted alphabetically.
Viewing Photos and Photo Slideshows
Each of the supported photo sources provides nearly identical features related to view-
ing photos and photo slideshows. So you can browse into any source, and eventually 
you’ll be presented with one or more actual photos, in a folder. At this point, you can 
perform some basic activities related to individual photos or groups of photos.
To view a photo full-screen, simply select it. This works exactly as expected, but if 
you open the app bar (Winkey + Z) while viewing an individual photo, you’ll see some 
interesting options, as shown in Figure 9-9.
These options include the following:
Set as … Lock screen:
3
3
 While you can always use the PC Settings interface to 
select a favorite photo for your lock screen image, oftentimes you’ll think to 
do this while actually viewing photos. This menu item, found by tapping the 
Set as button, lets you do so.
Set as … App tile: 
3
3
By default, the Photos app tile will shuffle through photos, 
presenting an animated view. But you can configure a single picture to be the 
permanent tile image if you’d like.
Set as … App background: 
3
3
As you’ve seen, the Photos app provides a nice 
photographic background image in its main view. But you’ll probably want 
to change that to a favorite photo of your own. When you do, this view will 
change to resemble Figure 9-10.

316
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps

folder that contains the picture you’re currently viewing.
 
Figure 9-9: A single photo viewed full-screen

Of course, you can also trigger slideshows from a folder view, and when you access 
the app bar from this view, you get a different set of buttons, and thus capabilities.  
A few are notable.
Note that this 
3

delete button is 
not available when 
viewing photos on 
connected online 
services or PCs.

317
Enjoying Photos
The first is a Browse by date button, though it only appears in the Pictures library 
view. When you activate this button, the view switches so that each “folder” tile now 
represents a month, as in Figure 9-11. (And there’s now a new Browse by album but-
ton in the app bar so you can switch back.)
 
Figure 9-11: The Pictures library, viewed by date
There’s also a power-user feature of sorts that lets you collect photos from differ-
ent folders (within a single photo source) into a basket, like that in the Metro-style 
File Picker, so that you can run a slideshow of photos from different locations.
To use this feature, enter a folder or view that contains photos. Then, select indi-
vidual photos, as you would when selecting Start screen tiles: by right-clicking them, 
tapping and dragging down a bit, or by pressing the Spacebar; as you select a photo, a 
selection rectangle will indicate success. Or you can select every photo in a folder by 
opening the app bar and pressing Select All.
Either way, as you select photos, you’ll see two new buttons in the app bar as you 
go: a Clear Selection button for clearing the selection and a selection thumbnail that 
indicates how many photos you’ve selected; these can both be seen in Figure 9-12. Once 
you’ve selected all the photos you want—again, from multiple folders—you can tap the 
Slide show button to start this more advanced slideshow type.
Sharing, Printing, and Searching
Many common photo-related activities work consistently with similar features in 
other Metro apps, thanks to the new system-wide capabilities in Windows 8. For 
example, when viewing a photo, you can print it by accessing the Devices interface 
(Winkey + K) or, more directly, the Print interface (Ctrl + P). Or you can use the Share 
interface (Winkey + H) to share the photo with others using a compatible Metro-style 
app, such as Mail.
In this Browse 
3
3
by Date view, you 
can also reverse 
pinch to zoom 
out and see more 
on-screen at once.
This is a neat 
3
3
feature, but it 
works only within 
a single source. You 
can’t mix photos 
from, say, Facebook 
and Flickr into a 
single slideshow. You’ll 
be prompted to that 
effect if you try.

318

Figure 9-12: Multi-selecting photos from different folders.
Likewise, the excellent Search functionality in Windows 8 can be used in Photos to 
find particular pictures. If you access the Search charm (Winkey + Q) while viewing a 
photo or from within a particular folder, the Search pane that appears will search only 
that folder. Search at the source level and it will search just that source.
If you open the Search charm from outside the Photos app and then select Photos 
from the list of apps in the Search pane, you get a grid-based view of your Pictures 
library, filtered to the search term, as shown in Figure 9-13.

(like a smartphone) that contains pictures to Windows in the past, you know that

way to search 
all sources 
simultaneously, 
though that would 
be very useful.

Enjoying Photos
Microsoft’s desktop OS has long supported basic photo acquisition (or what some people 
think of “downloading”) capabilities through desktop apps like Photo Gallery. You can 
still do this, if you’d like. Or, you can use the new Metro-based photo acquisition inter-
face that’s available through the Photos app.
When you plug in a compatible device that contains photos, you’ll see a Metro-style 
notification flyover, or “toast,” like that shown in Figure 9-14.
 
Figure 9-14: Windows 8 asks what you’d like to do  
when you plug in this sort of device.
If you select this notification, you’ll see a window similar to that in Figure 9-15; 
like the notification, this display can appear anywhere in Windows, including Photos 
or other Metro-style apps, the Start screen, or the Windows desktop.
 
Figure 9-15: Choose what you’d like to do with devices that  
contain photos.
You may want to use Photos as the default choice when such a device is plugged 
into the PC, though we feel that you should examine your choices before making 
such a decision. Remember that you can always change what happens later using the 
AutoPlay control panel, though. So if you make a mistake, or want to change your 
selection later, you can do so.
The easiest way 
3

to find AutoPlay 
is to use Windows 
Search: Type 
autoplay, select 
Settings, and then 
choose AutoPlay from 
the results list.

320
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
For now, let’s just use Photos to manually acquire photos from an attached cam-
era, memory card, or other device. To do so, launch the Photos app and then display 
the app bar. On the far right side of this app bar, you’ll see an Import button. Click 
this, and Photos will prompt you to choose a device, as in Figure 9-16.
Do so, and you’ll be presented with the  
full-screen interface shown in Figure 9-17. 
Here, you can determine which photos to 
acquire and what the folder name that 
contains them will be.
What you can’t do, of course, is con-
figure other photo acquisition options, 
and this is why we noted previously that 
you may want to review your options first. 
Photos doesn’t let you name the acquired 
photos to your liking (unless you happen 
to like the default, which is to use awful, 
camera-based names). And it doesn’t let you 
choose whether to delete the photos from  
the device once they’re acquired. (They are  
not deleted.)
 
Figure 9-17: Choosing which photos to acquire.
Click Import to acquire the photos.
When you’re done, you’re prompted to open the folder containing the photos you 
just imported. This will happen in Photos, of course, not in File Explorer on the desktop.

Enjoying Photos
Put simply, the photo acquisition capabilities in Photos are, well, basic. And if 
you want more control over this process, as we do, you should consider using the free 
Photo Gallery desktop application instead. We look at this useful tool a bit later in the 
chapter.
Using the Camera App
As with other mobile, touch-based systems, Windows 8 includes a simple Camera app 
that works with the camera (or, in the case of some modern devices, the cameras) that 
is included in (or attached to) your PC or device. This app lets you capture still pictures 
and short movies. It’s not quite as useful as, say, a camera in a smartphone, but it’s 
there if you need it.
The first time you run the Camera app, you’ll be prompted to allow the app to use 
your webcam and microphone. Obviously, you must allow this for the app to function. 
If you block this access, the app will simply quit.
The Camera app, shown in Figure 9-18, is simplicity itself. There’s an app bar, 
always visible in this app, with just a handful of buttons.

Available app bar buttons include:

On PCs or devices with multiple cameras, the Change camera 
button will let you choose which camera to use. For example, many Windows 8 
and RT devices include both front- and rear-facing cameras. This button works 
like a toggle: Tap it once to change the view to the next camera.

that will be consistent across all Windows 8 PCs: Photo/Video resolution, Audio 
device, and Video stabilization, though not all options will be configurable on 
all PCs. You can also click a More link here to view additional camera options. 
What you see in that interface will vary from PC to PC, but some of the more 
common options include Brightness, Contrast, Flicker, and Exposure.

: This button also works as a toggle. By default, Camera is set up 
to take still photos. But if you enable this button, it is set up to take videos 
instead. Tap it again to return to camera mode.
To take a photo with Camera, simply tap (or click) anywhere on-screen. If you’re 
in video mode, this will start video recording instead. To stop recording, tap (or click) 
the screen instead.
Photos and videos taken with Camera can be found in the Camera Roll photo, which 
is added to the default save location for the Pictures library (My Pictures, by default).
Doing More with Your Pictures
The Photos app is fine for what it is. But it doesn’t have any photo editing features at all. 
Its photo acquisition features are lackluster at best. And if you want to share photos via 
an online service that’s not supported by a Metro-style app that’s savvy to the Share 
contract, you’re out of luck on that count as well.
For these and other slightly more advanced scenarios, you’ll need to turn to 
the Windows desktop. Here, you’ll find some features that are built into Windows 8 
directly, and a few that will require some optional and free Microsoft applications 
that may or may not be installed on your PC or device.
Since these capabilities haven’t changed since Windows 7, we won’t go into great 
depth here. But we’ll provide you with a rundown of the applications you can use, 
and for what activities, and help you find any missing applications that may not be 
included with your Windows 8 install.
Built Into Windows 8: Photo Viewing on the Desktop
Windows 8 includes an admittedly well hidden desktop application called Windows 
Photo Viewer that lets you view individual photos and perform other photo-related 
Keyboard users

can tap Space to 
take a photo or

recording.

functions. Windows Photo Viewer is odd in that you can’t actually find the applica-
tion via normal means—it doesn’t appear in the All Apps view or even via Start Search. 
But you can access Photo Viewer by right-clicking an image file from the desktop and 
choosing Open with and then Windows Photo Viewer.
As you can see in Figure 9-19, this application provides print-, e‑mail-, and disc 
burning-based ways to share photos and a handy but simple slideshow feature courtesy 
of that large button in the lower middle of the window.
 
Figure 9-19: The Windows Photo Viewer application provides basic features related to viewing 
and sharing photos from the Windows desktop.
You could also make Windows Photo Viewer the default photo-viewing application 
if you wanted. To do so, right-click an image file and choose Open with then Choose 
default program, and then pick Windows Photo Viewer from the list that appears. Or, 
use the Default programs control panel (via Start Search).
Or don’t. Because there’s a better option for desktop users . . .
Completing the Windows 8 Photo Experience with Photo Gallery
If you’re looking for a more versatile tool that can do it all when it comes to photos— 
photo acquisition, viewing, editing printing, e‑mail sharing, burning to disc, tagging, 
captioning, geotagging, advanced slideshows, sharing with numerous online services 
including SkyDrive, Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, panoramas, and more—look no further 
than Photo Gallery. This amazing application, shown in Figure 9-20, is everything you 
need, all in one place.
Photo Gallery

used to be called 
Windows Live 
Gallery, and it was 
previously available 
as part of a suite of 
apps called Windows 
Live Essentials. The 
application carriers

Live branding.

Figure 9-20: Photo Gallery
Photo Gallery is the full meal deal, and because it provides a superset of the 
features available in a basic Windows 8 install, we recommend using it over  
the built-in tools.
How to Find Photo Gallery
The only problem with Photo Gallery is that you may not find it on your PC or 
device. If that’s the case, browse to windows.com, where you’ll find this and 
other useful Windows applications.
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
Microsoft has supported music lovers with various Windows-based applications and 
platforms for over a decade, beginning with its first true jukebox, Windows Media 
Player, which debuted in Windows Millennium Edition (Me), way back in 2000. In 
Windows 8, well, things get a little Metro-y.
If you’re in a 
3
3
pinch, Microsoft 
Paint, included in 
Windows 8, also 
provides some 
basic photo-editing 
features.

325
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
Yes, Windows 8 includes Windows Media Player, which you may remember from 
Windows 7. And Windows 8 Pro users (only) can optionally buy and install Windows 
Media Center, which was also available in Windows 7. So the range of functionality 
provided by these applications is still available in Windows 8, if not improved. (In 
fact, as far as we can see, they are the versions of Windows Media Player and Media 
Center from Windows 7, carried across unchanged.)
Over the past several years, Microsoft also cultivated a separate and somewhat 
incompatible media platform called Zune, which included software, device, and 
music and video service components. Zune was meant to be a one-stop-shop solution 
that could compete head-to-head with Apple’s dominant iPod/iTunes, but suffice it to 
say that never happened despite some interesting advantages on the Microsoft side. 
So Zune has been discontinued as a brand.
The trouble is, just declaring Zune dead doesn’t magically erase the parts of this 
tragic platform that are still out in the world. Millions of people still use the Zune 
PC software, which offers some interesting advantages over both Microsoft’s own 
Windows Media Player and competing applications such as Apple iTunes. The Zune 
software and services were integrated into the first two versions of Windows Phone, 
as well, also in use by several million people around the world. And key parts of the 
Zune platform, including the music and video marketplaces, are good enough to sur-
vive the death of this brand. And, as it turns out, they’re continuing forward, minus 
the Zune name.
So in addition to carrying forward its legacy music applications for old-timers, 
Windows 8 also provides a Metro-style music experience, called Xbox Music, which 
while based on Microsoft’s Zune efforts, now accesses Xbox-branded services on the 
back end. Not coincidentally, it looks and works much like the Music experience on 
the Xbox 360, and it accesses the back end Xbox Music Store that used to be part of the 
Zune platform (as Zune Music Marketplace). Since this is the biggest change, music-
wise, in Windows 8, we’ll focus largely on that app and its supporting services here.
Using the Xbox Music App
Microsoft’s new Xbox Music app is a front end for your own content—which you 
store on your own PC or in the cloud-based SkyDrive service—as well as content 
that’s found in the Xbox Music Store. Shown in Figure 9-21, Xbox Music provides a 
basic but attractive Metro-style app that uses different functional groups across 
its horizontally scrolling interface.
Note that

Windows Media 
Player and Media 
Center are 
not available in 
Windows RT at all.

However, if your collection is empty—most likely, since most people don’t 
have gigabytes of music content sitting on their PCs—this interface will more 
closely resemble the barren wasteland shown in Figure 9-23.

Here, you’ll find a rundown of the albums and artists that are 
most popular in the Xbox Music Store right now.
Put simply, there may be multiple groups in the Xbox Music app, but there are 
really only two basic activities occurring here. You’re going to access your own 
music collection, or you’re going to browse, potentially buy, and, if you have an 
Xbox Music Pass, even play music online.
Naturally, we’ll look at both.
Accessing and Playing Your Own Music
To access your music collection, scroll over to the My Music group and tap the My Music 
heading. You’ll be presented with the full screen My Music view shown in Figure 9-24, 
which provides a nice if somewhat inefficient album-based view of your music collec-
tion by default.

worth noting. These include the following:

You can change the view between Albums, 
Artists, Songs, and Playlists. Each has a similar presentation, though you 
can also choose to sort each a bit differently. For example, in Figure 9-25, you 
can see the Artists view sorted alphabetically.
 
Figure 9-25: The Artists view, alphabetically

329
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
The Music app includes an app bar, but it doesn’t do much beyond allowing you to 
open an individual music file unless you’re already playing music. We’ll examine that 
functionality in just a bit.
First, however, let’s dive into the collection a bit deeper. If you’re using the Albums 
or Artists view and select an item (that is, an album or artist, respectively), it provides a 
pop-up display providing more information about that item. In Figure 9-26, you can see 
this effect for a particular artist.
 
Figure 9-26: Selecting an artist or album provides a pop-up instead of opening a new screen.
This unique approach displays the information about the artist or album in this 
new area, but it will typically require more space than the area provides. So this view 
also enables you to scroll within the area, vertically, to see more information. In either 
view, for example, you can scroll down (within this pop-up) to see more songs.
This pop-up also provides prominent Play all, Add to now playing, Explore artist, 
and Play on Xbox 360 buttons. But you may be surprised to discover that tapping an 
individual song here won’t trigger immediate playback. Instead, this expands the 
view in-line yet again, providing separate Play and Add to now playing buttons, just 
for that song, as shown in Figure 9-27.
Here’s a rundown of the actions you can trigger from these pop-ups:
Play: 
3

This button plays the current selection, which can be a song, an 
album, or an artist, and triggers the app bar-based Now Playing experience 
shown in Figure 9-28. Here you’ll find useful on-screen playback controls 
and other buttons.
If you click Play, 
3

the selected song is 
added to—and does 
not replace—any 
other songs that 
may already be in  
the Now Playing 
playlist.

mation, like artist biography and discography, which can be viewed by scroll-
ing to the right.

music via the Zune PC software or Xbox 360.

Play on Xbox 360: 
3
3
This button launches the Xbox Companion app, which will 
connect you to an Xbox 360 console in your home (it needs to be powered on 
first) and play the selection there, instead of on the PC or device. Two things 
happen when this connection is made. On the Xbox 360, a familiar (and Music 
app-like) Now Playing screen appears for playback and, in fact, gives you 
additional playlist editing features you don’t even get in the Music app, such 
as the ability to clear the queue and add and remove songs. And on your PC 
or device, the Xbox Companion app provides a remote-like experience called 
Xbox Controls that provides playback buttons, as shown in Figure 9-31.
There’s one more aspect of music playback that needs to be addressed. While Play to 
Xbox 360 is useful and interesting, it’s not the only solution that Windows 8 provides 
for playing music from your PC (or device) to another device in your home. That is, in 
addition to supporting Play to Xbox 360, Windows 8 (and thus the Metro-style Xbox 
Music app) also supports the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) “Play To” technol-
ogy, which works with a wide range of devices, including, go figure, the Xbox 360.
NO TE ​ ​This Play on Xbox 360 functionality is a bit more sophisticated than the Play 
To feature that’s been in Windows for years. To work, however, Play on Xbox 360 
requires that the content you’re playing be found in the Xbox Music (or Video) Store, 
whereas Play To simply streams music from the PC or device to the console.
Microsoft will be 
3
3
replacing the Xbox 
Companion app with 
a similar but more 
powerful app called 
Xbox SmartGlass, 
which should be 
available by the end 
of 2012. You may 
want to look for this 
app, too.
If you don’t 
3
3
already have the 
Xbox Companion 
(or SmartGlass) 
app installed, you’ll 
be prompted to get 
it from Windows 
Store.

333
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
 
Figure 9-31: The Xbox Companion app lets you push music playback to your  
Xbox 360 and use your Windows device like a giant remote.
So why support both Play on Xbox 360 and Play To? Play on Xbox 360 is, of course, 
Xbox-specific, and it requires that the content you’re playing is found in Microsoft’s 
Xbox-based online stores. That’s because while using Play on Xbox 360, Xbox Music 
isn’t streaming the content, it’s handing it off and letting the console play it instead. 
Play To, meanwhile, is more basic in that you’re just streaming content from the PC 
(or device) to a compatible set-top box. So if you were to shut down the PC, the music 
playback would stop. On other hand, Play To lets you play music through the console 
that isn’t found in the Xbox Music Store.
To utilize Play To, start music playback and then bring up Xbox Music’s app bar. 
Click the Play To button on the right of the app bar, and then choose the appropriate 
device from the Play To pane that appears, as in Figure 9-32.

334
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
From here, playback control works as it does when you play music locally on the PC: 
You simply use the Xbox Music’s playback controls (in the app bar) to control playback.
Using the Xbox Music Store
Microsoft isn’t shy about its attempts to sell you music via its Xbox Music Store 
(formerly Zune Music Marketplace), which can be accessed from the Spotlight and 
Most Popular groups on the Xbox Music home screen as well as through various 
links like the Artist information interface in your own collection.
Clicking the title of the Spotlight or Most Popular group will provide a view similar 
to that of My Music. This is a rather paltry front end to what Microsoft claims is an 
online storefront of approximately 30 million tracks either way, but as you can see in 
Figure 9-33 it is, at least, simple.
 
Figure 9-33: Most Popular view of the Xbox Music Store
Since this interface is so similar to that of My Music and provides the same ways 
to filter and view information, drill down into various artists, albums, and genres, 
there’s no need to cover basic navigational information here. Instead, let’s look at 
some of the unique things you can do in the Xbox Music Store.
Buying Songs from Xbox Music
To purchase an album or song, click the Buy Album (or Buy Song) button you’ll find in 
the pop-up for that item. Xbox Music will display a full-screen notification interface 
like that in Figure 9-34, and step you through the process of purchasing the music.

335
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
 
Figure 9-34: Buying a song from the Xbox Music Store
One important note about the music purchasing experience: You must use Micro-
soft Points. Microsoft doesn’t use your local currency for purchases as do other online 
music stores like Amazon MP3 and Apple iTunes. Instead, Microsoft uses a system 
called Microsoft Points, which works across its other online stores, including the 
Xbox Video Store and Xbox Game Store.
The Microsoft Points system exists for one reason and one reason only: to save Micro-
soft money—since you must buy points in batches, sparing the company per-transaction 
credit card fees—but its biggest effect is to make online purchases needlessly confusing 
for consumers.
For your edification, 80 Microsoft Points is worth $1.00 US, so you can see how 
the math gets fairly convoluted. But Microsoft sells points, online and via gift 
card-like cards in retail stores, in bundles of 400 ($5), 800 ($10), 1600 ($20), 4000 
($50), and 6000 ($75) points. So if you’re interested in giving Microsoft an interest-
free loan, you can stock up.
Playing Music with Xbox Music Pass
Microsoft has an interesting music subscription service called Xbox Music Pass—
formerly Zune Music Pass—which provides you with almost unlimited access to its 
online music collection for a monthly fee. (In the United States, this fee is $10 per 
month, but if you sign up for a year upfront, you will receive 12 months for the price 
of 10, or about $8.33 a month.) Depending on how you feel about owning music and 
the quality of Microsoft’s Xbox Music Store, this is either a tremendous bargain or 
something to avoid all together.

336
C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
Maybe we’re just getting old, or perhaps we’re simply tired of micromanaging a 
locally saved music collection, but we’ve come to really appreciate and enjoy Xbox Music 
Pass. But instead of trying to sell you on this service, we’ll simply explain what you can 
do with (almost) unfettered access to the Xbox Music Store music collection.
First, you can use the Play album, Play song, Play top songs, and other similar 
buttons you’ll see as you navigate around the Xbox Music Store to stream virtually 
any music in its entirety. If you were not an Xbox Music Pass subscriber, you’d only 
get a 30-second preview. (This streaming functionality is also available on Windows 
Phone handsets, Xbox 360 consoles, and via the web.)
Second, you can arbitrarily download any of this music to your PC and, while your 
subscription is in place, play it (online or off) on your Windows-based PCs and devices 
(and Windows Phone handsets). It’s like having 30 million songs in your own music 
collection—you know, as long as you’re a paying customer. You’ll see a handy Add to my 
music link, like that in Figure 9-35, letting you copy Store music to your own PC.
 
Figure 9-35: Using Add to my music to copy music from the Store to  
your PC
Xbox Music Pass has other advantages, but the point here is that with this service, 
the Xbox Music Store is suddenly open to you in ways that it isn’t otherwise. You can 
find out more about the service at www.xbox.com/music.
Searching the Store for Music
Of course, even finding music to buy can be difficult. And while the navigational 
facilities in the Xbox Music Store are, at best, basic, your best bet is to search for the 

337
Buying, Managing, and Playing Music
music you want. And in this one case, Xbox Music Store actually works really well 
(assuming you know what you want, of course), thanks to its integration with the 
system-wide Windows 8 search functionality.
Search works as it does throughout Windows 8, and you can trigger a search of 
the store from within Xbox Music or at any time from elsewhere in the OS. To do so, 
display the Search charm (Winkey + Q) and, if you’re not already using Xbox Music, 
be sure to select Music from the apps list in the search pane.
Then start typing in a search term, perhaps an artist, album, or song name, and 
the Search experience will often supply suggestions as you type. You can see an 
example of this in Figure 9-36, and search results appear right in the Xbox Music app, 
giving you a way to dig deeper into your favorite music.
 
Figure 9-36: Searching in Xbox Music
What About Podcasts?
While the Music + Videos app on Windows Phone fully supports podcasts, the 
Xbox Music app in Windows 8/RT doesn’t, so there’s no way to find, subscribe 
to, or listen to/view podcasts. Instead, you’ll need to try a third-party app. One 
that’s emerged as an early favorite is SlapDash Podcasts, which you can find in 
Windows Store.

C h a p t e r  9    Relaxing with Windows 8’s Photo and Entertainment Apps
Doing More with Music
While the Music app provides a handy, consumption-only interface for music, those 
who have more advanced needs will need to turn to some classic Windows applications 
that have been kicking around for several years.
All versions of Windows 8 include Windows Media Player, which is shown in 
Figure 9-37. This application has historically been used as a media management 
system, but it hasn’t really changed since Windows 7, for better or worse.
 
Figure 9-37: Windows Media Player
Windows Media Center, meanwhile, started life as a consumption-only application, 
like today’s Metro-style apps, though it picked up more sophisticated capabilities over 
time. It features large, touch-friendly controls, works well in full-screen mode, and has 
a particularly nice Now Playing interface, which is shown in Figure 9-38.
Unfortunately, finding Media Center is a bit problematic.
First, Media Center is not available on Windows RT or the base version of Windows 
8, which is called Windows 8 Core. Instead, you must have Windows 8 Pro before you 
can get Media Center.
Second, even if you have Windows 8 Pro, Media Center isn’t free: You can buy it for 
a small fee from Microsoft using the new Add Features to Windows interface. (You can 
easily find this through Start Search.) Why bother? If you have to ask, you don’t want 
Media Center. And frankly, the world has moved on anyway.
Note, however, 
3

that neither of 
these options 
are available to 
Windows RT users: 
Only Windows 8 
provides any support 
for these legacy 
desktop-based music 
applications.

Buying, Managing, and Playing Movies and TV Shows
 
Figure 9-38: The full-screen Media Center music playback experience
Buying, Managing, and Playing

The Windows 8 video experience revolves around a new Metro-style app, called Xbox 
Video, and some traditional Windows applications—Windows Media Player and Windows 
Media Center for playback and Movie Maker for video editing and sharing—which carry 
over from Windows 7.
So it shouldn’t be surprising that the video experience is similar to that of music: 
The Metro-style Xbox Video app works well enough for video playback on tablets, 
other portable devices, and PCs, and for browsing Microsoft’s new Xbox Video Store 
online, but doesn’t offer any advanced features. If you want to do more with videos, 
like edit your own home movies and share them via online services like Facebook 
or YouTube, you’ll need to stick with the more productive desktop environment and 
those more mature Windows applications.
NO TE ​ ​You’ll also need to stick with Windows 8, and not Windows RT. Note that 
Windows RT does not include or support Windows Media Player, Media Center, 
or Movie Maker.
Of course, what we’re most concerned with here is the new stuff. And that means 
the Xbox Video app.
The Xbox Video

app is a bit more 
limited than that, 
actually. It can’t 
play DVD- or  
Blu-ray-based  
movies either.

Using the Xbox Video App
If you’ve used the Xbox Music app described earlier in this chapter or are familiar 
with the video playback capabilities of the Xbox 360 video game console, the Xbox 
Video app will be immediately familiar. As you can see in Figure 9-39, this app is a 
typical, Metro-style full-screen experience that extends horizontally and looks and 
works much like the Xbox Music app.
 
Figure 9-39: The new Xbox Video app
And like the Xbox Music app, the Xbox Video app pushes Microsoft’s online store 
experiences over your own local video collection, offering Spotlight, Movies Store, 
and Television Store groups up front, somewhat obscuring your own media.
Frankly, with the prevalence and usefulness of online video stores like Micro-
soft’s, and the fact that most people simply don’t have massive collections of TV 
shows and movies as they do music, this isn’t as bothersome as it may be with the 
Xbox Music app.
Navigating Your Own Videos
If you do have a PC-based video collection for some reason—perhaps you’ve ripped 
DVDs to the PC’s hard drive using Handbrake or similar tools—or you’ve rented or 
purchased TV shows or movies from Microsoft—which we describe a bit later—this 
content will be found by navigating left to the My Videos group on the Xbox Video 
home screen. This group, shown in Figure 9-40, will show a selection of videos found 
in your Videos library.
You can find

You can click the My Videos title to view your own video collection in a full-screen 
view like that in Figure 9-41. Here, your collection is divided into All, Movies, TV, and 
Other categories, and you can sort the view in various ways.

As you dive into your collection, by selecting a category and then an actual video, 
the Xbox Video app will display a pop-up for selected video, as shown in Figure 9-42, 
that offers a variety of options which includes some combination of the choices Play, 
Play on Xbox 360, Explore movie/series, Play trailer, and more.

Fixing the Video Categories
The Xbox Video app, like the Zune PC software on which it is based, often 
misfiles videos, assigning many of them to the nebulous Other category. 
The only way to fix this that we’ve found is to install the legacy Zune PC soft-
ware (www.zune.net) and use that application’s Edit capability to change the 
video type of each file to the appropriate value (usually TV Series or Movies). 
Unfortunately, the Xbox Video app doesn’t provide any editing capabilities of 
its own.
 
Figure 9-42: Options for an individual video
These options work as they do in the Music app, of course, and will vary from 
video to video. For example, some videos will not have the Play on Xbox 360 button 
available because of compatibility issues.
Playing a Video
Playing a video works as expected. When you click or tap the Play button, the full-screen 
playback experience appears, and will look something like Figure 9-43.
These simple controls should all be pretty familiar. The timeline scrubber is a big, 
touch-friendly control that takes the guesswork out of finding the right place in a 
video, even on a tablet. And Play/Pause works exactly as expected.
Anyone who’s

Play on Xbox 360:
3
3
 In this scenario, you can hand off the playback of Store-
based content from your PC to your Xbox 360, over the same home network 
only. That is, the content you play to the Xbox doesn’t have to come from Win-
dows 8. Instead, it can be located online, in the Xbox Video Store.
Accessing Store Content
Most people who use the Xbox Video app aren’t going to have large video collections 
they’ve ripped from optical media. Instead, and in keeping with the modern design 
of the Metro environment in which it runs, Xbox Video operates as a front end for 
Microsoft’s Store back end, in this case with the TV and Movie Stores in particular.
You’re probably familiar with how such stores work thanks to previous experience 
with Apple iTunes and other e-commerce destinations. But Microsoft’s online efforts, 
perhaps not surprisingly, offer some advantages.
First, the basics. Microsoft offers both TV shows and movies for purchase, and 
movies for rent. Some of this content is available in a choice of standard definition 
(SD) or high-definition (HD) formats, where the latter is more expensive but looks 
better on higher resolution screens. Videos rented or purchased from Microsoft work 
with the Xbox Video app, Windows Media Player, and Media Center in Windows 8/RT, 
with the Xbox 360, and on Windows Phone, too. And, as with music, Microsoft unfor-
tunately uses Microsoft Points for its video sales, so you’ll be doing some math.
Intriguingly, you’re given some choices when you buy or rent videos. That is, 
you can stream the video directly to the current PC or device, bypassing the need to 
download it before watching it. But if you do want to watch the video later offline 
(say, on a plane), you can choose to download if you prefer. But you can also simply 
just make the purchase and then not watch the rented or purchased video at that 
time. Later, you can access the video content from a Windows 8/RT PC or device, or 
the Xbox 360, or Windows Phone, and begin watching as you please.
This choice is pretty liberating, and you may find yourself queuing up a few movie 
rentals for the weekend on your Windows 8 tablet but then watch them at home via 
your Xbox 360 and HDTV. Or you could stream part of a purchased movie on the 360 
and then finish watching it in downloaded form on your Windows 8 tablet on the way 
to work the next morning (assuming you commute by bus or train, of course).
And in case it’s not obvious, content you purchase is yours forever, for the most 
part. This content is associated with your Microsoft account, and anytime you access 
the Store—from Windows 8 or the Xbox 360—you can browse through your previous 
purchases, or simply go to an item directly in the marketplace and start streaming it 
immediately: Instead of a Play/Rent button, you’ll just see a Play button.

Buying, Managing, and Playing Movies and TV Shows
The Movies and Television Stores work as expected, offering different navigational 
schemes—Featured, New releases, Top selling, Genres, and Studios for movies and 
Featured, Last night’s shows, Free TV, Top selling, Genres, and Networks for television—
and, in some views, different filtering and sorting capabilities.
The Movies and Television Stores work a bit differently than does the Music Store 
in Xbox Music, providing you with a true front end to the whole store experience. But 
content selection works as it does in Xbox Music: When you select a movie, for example 
and as shown in Figure 9-45, you’ll see buttons related to buying and renting the film, 
movie information, Play on Xbox 360 (when available), and to playing the trailer.
 
Figure 9-45: Options associated with movies in the marketplace
Because TV shows feature multiple episodes across multiple seasons, the Store 
provides a slightly different layout. When you select a TV show in the Television 
Store, you’ll only see a few choices, including View seasons and Explore series. When 
you select the former, a new full-screen view appears, offering information about the 
show plus links to each of its seasons, as shown in Figure 9-46.
When you select a season, a pop-up appears, as is common in the Xbox Music  
and Video apps, providing links for each episode in the season. Select an episode and 
you’ll see buttons related to buying the episode and, depending on the content, play-
ing it on the Xbox 360. This can be seen in Figure 9-47.
The renting and purchasing experiences differ a bit, and for reasons that are best 
left to the imagination, not all video content is available in both HD and SD formats, so 
you may not have that choice. When you do, you’ll see a screen like that in Figure 9-48, 
letting you choose between both quality sizes and either streaming or download.

Figure 9-47: TV show episode options
When buying such a movie, your choices are between HD download and stream, 
and SD download and stream.
When you purchase a TV show, you will also see different choices. There are no TV 
show rentals, but you can choose to purchase shows in SD or HD (when available), and 
you always get both download and stream availability. You can also choose to buy a 
Season Pass, which provides all of the episodes in the given season in a batch, includ-
ing those seasons that are still in progress. You will see the same HD and SD choices as 
you do with movies, assuming those options are available for the title you selected.

Doing More with Videos
As we discussed in the Music section, the old-school Windows Media Player applica-
tion is available to all users of Windows 8, and this solution provides decent, desk-
top-based video playback. You can also purchase and download the Windows Media 
Center solution if you’re running Windows 8 Pro only. Again, neither application is 
available to users of Windows RT.
Frankly, we think you can do better. If you want to play videos on the Windows 
desktop, check out VLC Media Player from videolan.org. It provides all of the video 
playback features from both Windows Media Player and Media Center but offers some 
significant advantages over either. First, unlike Media Center, VLC is free. And it also 
supports all kinds of subtitles and captioning, something that’s decidedly lacking in 
Microsoft’s video playback applications.
Movie Maker is another useful video tool that’s been kicking around for over a 
decade in one form or another. The current version is tuned, somewhat, to editing 
home videos and then sharing them online via YouTube, Facebook, and other services. 
Movie Maker is shown in Figure 9-49.
How to Find Windows Movie Maker
As with Photo Gallery, Movie Maker may not be preinstalled on your 
Windows 8-based PC or device. And the solution is the same: Browse  
to windows.com and download it.

Summary
While the new Metro-style digital media experiences in Windows 8 are almost purely 
consumption-based, they nicely complement the already rich and mature digital 
media applications that Microsoft has included in Windows for years. Photos is a 
simple and attractive, and touch friendly, way to enjoy your photos, no matter where 
they’re stored. Xbox Music provides a device-like interface for playing music online 
or off. And Xbox Video integrates nicely with Microsoft’s online marketplace, provid-
ing a handy way to access TV shows and movies, at home or on the go. It even lets you 
play videos through your Xbox 360, using the handy Xbox Companion app.
Together, these apps provide a decent set of basic consumption capabilities. But 
over time, Windows 8 will be improved both with updates to these apps and by new 
Metro-style apps that provide additional digital media functionality. As with every-
thing else in this pioneering new OS, what you get in the box, so to speak, is just the 
beginning.

If the rise of touch-based devices like the iPad and  
smartphones has taught us anything, it’s that people love to play casual games.  
And while some hard-core gamers will cling to their high-end gaming devices—say,  
the Xbox 360 video game console or Windows-based PCs—this audience is a minority. 
Most people enjoy games but don’t have the time or energy to devote to all-night death-
match contests in virtual worlds. And the changes Microsoft has made to Windows 8’s 
built-in games functionality reflects that fact.
Windows has always included at least a handful of casual games, most notably the 
now-classic Minefield and Solitaire. But with the switch to immersive, full-screen, 
Metro-style experiences in Windows 8, Microsoft is likewise moving its game efforts 
into this environment. So the new game experiences in this release are tailored to 
Metro and are largely designed around the multi-touch interactions that will be com-
mon on tablets and other touch-screen devices.

C h a p t e r  1 0    Xbox Games with Windows 8
This chapter examines the game-related functionality that is new to Windows 8 
and covers what you need to do to get up and running with this new generation of 
touch-based gaming experiences. We don’t focus on the legacy features that carry 
forward from previous versions.
It’s Going to Change
Thanks to the dynamic nature of its new apps platform, the Metro-style apps 
that Microsoft includes with Windows 8/RT will change over time, so it’s highly 
likely that the apps described in this chapter will appear somewhat differently 
over time and will include additional features. This is normal, and as a general 
statement, it’s probably fair to say that the Metro-style Xbox apps you use will 
provide a superset of the functionality we describe in this chapter.
Games and the Metro Environment
In Windows 7, Microsoft bundled several fun games that ran within the Windows desk-
top environment, as one might expect, as well as a container for games, if you will, 
called Games Explorer. This time around, Windows 8 instead integrates with Microsoft’s 
popular Xbox LIVE games and entertainment services. It includes a new app called Xbox 
Games, a central location for discovering, downloading, and buying new Xbox LIVE 
games for both Windows 8 and the Xbox 360. And of course, you can find and download 
more casual Metro-style games through the Games area of Windows Store.
The differences between Xbox LIVE games and other games can be important if 
you’re a bit more serious about gaming than the casual gamer. But we’ll discuss the 
vagaries of the Xbox LIVE service—and what it means to be an Xbox LIVE game title—
later in the chapter. For now, let’s examine how Metro-style games differ from their 
predecessors in earlier versions of Windows.
Full-screen, immersive experiences: 
3
3
Like all Metro-style apps, Metro-based 
games are full-screen, immersive experiences. They provide a so-called chrome-
free experience with no visible OS-based user interface elements such as tool-
bars, window handles, and so on, and feature smooth, flicker-free performance 
with adaptive layout capabilities that ensure that these games look great on 
any PC or device, regardless of the screen size or resolution.
Windows 8 can, 
3
3
of course, run 
traditional Windows 
games that run 
under the desktop 
and provide full- 
screen experiences  
as well. The 
capabilities listed  
here are in addition  
to legacy features.
Note, however, 
3
3
that Windows RT 
cannot run 
traditional Windows 
games that run 
under the desktop.

351
Games and the Metro Environment
Consider the game shown in Figure 10-1. Here, you can see a game in which 
the entire screen is literally used for one purpose only: for the game itself.  
No other UI intrudes on this experience.
 
Figure 10-1: Windows 8 Metro-style games are full-screen, immersive experiences.
Multi-touch and sensor compatible: 
3
3
As with games on smartphones and other 
tablet-based systems like the iPad, Windows 8 Metro-style games integrate with 
underlying system capabilities such as multi-touch and the gyroscope and other 
sensors and devices. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities, such as 
driving games in which you physically move a tablet in space to steer, accelerate, 
and brake, or interactive games in which the device’s cameras are used to inter-
act with the outside world.
On the flip side, these games are also generally designed to be used with other 
input devices. So if you’re using a mouse- and keyboard-based PC instead of a 
tablet, you can still play.
Integrated with Metro experiences: 
3
3
Like any other Metro-style apps, 
Metro-style games fully integrate with the wider Metro experiences. This 
means that edge and corner UIs such as the Charms bar, Back, Switcher, 
and Start are all available during gameplay. For example, in Figure 10-2, 
you can see the Charms bar being displayed over a game.
Furthermore, you can receive notifications during gameplay. This can be 
helpful if you’re whittling away a few minutes before a meeting or other event, 
and you wish to be alerted when it’s time to get back to work. A typical notifi-
cation, again being displayed over a game, can be seen in Figure 10-3.

Figure 10-2: Metro experiences such as the Charms bar are still available while  
playing a game.
 
Figure 10-3: Notifications still pop up onscreen during gameplay, too.
Metro-style games also use the standard Metro-style Settings interface, 
which is available via the Winkey + I keyboards shortcut or through Settings 
in the Charms bar. This consistency means that you will always know where 
to go to access game options, permissions and ratings capabilities, as shown 
in Figure 10-4. That said, many games will opt to use their own interface for 
in-game options.

353
Games and the Metro Environment
 
Figure 10-4: From Settings, you can access game permissions and ratings  
capabilities.
Finally, Metro-style games can utilize any common Metro-style user inter-
faces that are available to other apps, including edge-triggered app bars, file 
pickers, and the like. (That said, many games will choose to use more custom-
ized experiences, but that’s up to the developer.)
Acquiring and updating happens through the Windows Store: 
3
3
Like other 
Metro-style apps, Metro-style games can only be acquired from Windows 
Store, and that includes free games, trial games, full games, and Xbox LIVE 
games. Ditto for software updates: When a game needs to be updated, you’ll 
see an alert badge on the Windows Store live tile on the Start screen and a 
notice about pending updates inside the Store app. No Metro-style games 
can be offered elsewhere, for security and reliability reasons.
Rights for up to five PCs and/or devices: 
3
3
One of the many upsides to Microsoft’s 
Windows Store requirements for Metro-style games is that you have the right to 
install a purchased game on as many as five Windows 8 PCs and/or devices, each 
of which needs to be associated with your Microsoft account. This is in sharp 
contrast to retail video games, which are almost always licensed for use on just 
one PC.
Compatible with both Intel-compatible PCs and ARM-based devices: 
3
3
Most 
Metro-style games are designed to be compatible with both Intel-compatible 
PCs as well as ARM-based Windows RT devices. Not only that, but they are also 
engineered to perform similarly on both types of machines, regardless of the 
underlying architectural differences.
You can find 
3
3
and acquire Xbox 
Games through the 
Xbox Games app, 
too, but it is utilizing 
Windows Store on 
the back end.

That said, you’ll want to be careful about choosing games that work on both, 
and as you can see in Figure 10-5, the Windows Store landing page for each 
game will describe which platforms are supported.
 
Figure 10-5: You can discover which platforms a game is compatible with in the  
Windows Store.
In-app purchases: 
3
3
Metro-style games can provide in-app purchases, which 
can include new content or functionality, such as unlocking the next level of 
a game, a new weapon, or other trinket. In-app purchases have proven to be 
very popular on other casual game platforms like smartphones and, no doubt, 
will prove to be so in Windows 8 as well.
Not just for simple games:
3
3
 While there is no shortage of simple, casual games 
like Checkers and Hangman, Windows 8 Metro-style games can be as photo 
realistic and exciting as anything on the Xbox 360 or other dedicated game 
platforms. The system supports advanced DirectX capabilities for both 2-D 
and 3-D experiences that take advantage of every ounce of processing muscle 
your PC can provide. Will there be a future version of Call of Duty or Halo in a 
Metro-style version? There’s no (technical) reason why not.
Multiplayer online games: 
3
3
You’re not (necessarily) alone when you game on 
Windows 8. Metro-style games can support full multiplayer capabilities as 
well, letting you compete with others online in real time.
Optional integration with Xbox LIVE: 
3
3
As noted earlier and described later 
in the chapter, developers can choose to release their games as is or integrate 
them into the Xbox LIVE service. This requires additional work on their part, 
but Xbox LIVE also provides additional capabilities as you’ll soon discover. 
Xbox LIVE games are also available separately through the Xbox Games app.

Finding and Acquiring Games for Windows 8
Finding and Acquiring Games for Windows 8
In Chapter 6, we discuss Windows Store, Microsoft’s new online marketplace for 
Metro-style apps. And as previously discussed, this is the place where you can dis-
cover, download, and purchase new Metro-style games as well. Given the popularity 
of games, especially casual games, it’s no surprise that this type of app is prominently 
offered in the Windows Store.
As you can see in Figure 10-6, the Games group is the first actual category of apps 
displayed in the main screen of the Windows Store.
 
Figure 10-6: The Games group figures prominently in the Windows Store.
Finding games in Windows Store is straightforward, and this process is documented 
elsewhere in the book. As a quick refresher, Windows Store is the only distribution 
point for (Metro-style) games, which can be offered in free, paid, and trial versions, 
with or without in-app purchasing and advertisements.
The Games group in the Windows Store supports more subcategories than any other 
category: Action, Adventure, Arcade, Card, Casino, Family, Kids, Music, Puzzle, Racing, 
Role Playing Shooter, Simulation, Sports, and Strategy. As you can see in Figure 10-7, 
filtering the view to show just a single subcategory really cleans up the display.
The landing page for an individual game features the same views provided for 
other apps including Overview, Details, and Reviews pages, which are generally 
stocked with information. Figure 10-8 shows a typical game landing page.
Again, you can 
3

find Xbox LIVE 
games in the Xbox 
Games app.

Figure 10-7: Filtering the Games category by subcategory
 
Figure 10-8: A game landing page in Windows Store
As with installation for other apps, game installation is nearly instantaneous and 
happens in the background; though if you’re quick enough, you can view the Installing 
apps page to view the install progress. Windows 8 will display a toast notification when 
the game is installed, and if you view the end (right side) of the Start screen, you’ll see 
that a single tile for the new game has been added, as shown in Figure 10-9.

357
Finding and Acquiring Games for Windows 8
 
Figure 10-9: A tile for a newly installed game is added to the end of the  
Start screen.
Finding Games with Search
As with other Metro-style apps, Windows Store fully supports the Windows 8 
Search contract, which means that you can search for individual game titles 
from within the store, or from anywhere in Windows 8. To do so, type Winkey + Q 
to display Search, or open the Charms bar and then select Search. If you are 
outside of Windows Store at the time, be sure to select Store from the list of 
apps in the Search pane when searching.
If the Windows Store has a problem, it’s that it gets overloaded pretty quickly. 
Curiously, it’s lacking a subcategory called Xbox LIVE, which would show both full-
featured Xbox LIVE game titles as well as the smaller, indie-type Xbox LIVE Arcade 
games that many users are looking for. Fortunately, Windows 8 provides another 
sneaky way to peek into Windows Store and find only those types of games. We’ll dis-
cuss that in the next section after a brief explanation of the Xbox LIVE service and 
why it’s so important.

Finding and Acquiring Desktop Games
Oddly enough, Microsoft does allow developers to advertise legacy desktop games 
and applications in Windows Store alongside Metro-style games and apps. These 
games do not necessarily offer any of the formal capabilities provided through true 
Metro-style games, and, because of this, Microsoft doesn’t let you download those 
games from the Store. Instead, you’ll be directed to visit the developer’s web site.
Let’s quickly see how this works.
When browsing through Windows Store, you’ll come across some game and app 
tiles that include the notation “desktop app,” as seen in Figure 10-10. This indicates 
that the game (or application) is for the desktop, and not the Metro environment, so 
you will not see a rating or price, as with Metro-style apps and games.
 
Figure 10-10: Desktop games (and applications) will include a “desktop app”  
note on their tiles in Windows Store.
View the game’s landing page, as in the example in Figure 10-11, and you’ll see that 
desktop games and applications cannot be downloaded from Windows Store. Instead, 
you can click the link, Get app from developer, to visit a website and proceed from there.

cannot run on 
Windows RT. They 
are designed only  
for Windows 8  
(and perhaps  
older versions of 
Windows, too).

Xbox LIVE and Windows 8
Xbox LIVE and Windows 8
Xbox LIVE began in 2002 as a feature of the original Xbox console. It was an offshoot 
of the multiplayer features in the first Halo game, and essentially formalized those 
features across an online network that other games could then use. But the Xbox LIVE 
service as we now know it appeared in 2005 alongside the Xbox 360, Microsoft’s second 
video game console. At that time, Microsoft greatly enhanced Xbox LIVE, providing the 
core capabilities and experiences that Xbox 360 gamers—and Windows Phone and now 
Windows 8 games gamers—still enjoy today.
NO TE ​ ​Video game historians will note that the first video game console Microsoft 
contributed to was the Sega Dreamcast. But when the Windows CE-based envi-
ronment in that console proved unpopular with game developers, Microsoft took 
things into its own hands and created the Xbox.
Microsoft also offers two types of Xbox LIVE accounts: a free account that’s simply 
called Xbox LIVE and a paid account called Xbox LIVE Gold. Xbox LIVE Gold members 
pay about $50 a year and are rewarded with some unique features. Looking just at the 
Xbox 360 console, gamers who opt for the Gold subscription get online multiplayer 
gaming, party and party chat functionality, and video chat capabilities. But they also 
get access to many multimedia services, including Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO GO, Sky 
Player (UK only), Last.fm Internet music streaming, Xbox Music and Video services, 
and a lot more.
C ROSSREF  ​Microsoft’s Xbox entertainment services, Xbox Music and Xbox Video, 
used to utilize the Zune brand. Windows 8 includes apps for these services, too, 
which we discuss in Chapter 9.
Signing up for Xbox LIVE is one of many ways in which you can create a  
Microsoft account. (Other popular methods include signing up for Hotmail or the 
Xbox Music Pass subscription.) Xbox LIVE, like other Microsoft services and, now, 
Windows 8, uses the same underlying identification service. So at the time of 
sign-up, you can use your own e‑mail account, no matter where it’s from, and Xbox 
LIVE will convert that e‑mail address into a Microsoft account. Or, if you already 
have a Microsoft account through Hotmail, MSN, or wherever, you can simply use 
your existing account. For purposes of this discussion, we’ll assume that you’ve 
created a Microsoft account, since you’ll be using this same account for gaming 
purposes on Windows 8, just as you do on the Xbox 360 (and Windows Phone).
Next, let’s examine what your Xbox LIVE account provides.
Many of

these third-party

Xbox LIVE Accounts
Your Xbox LIVE account is your online persona on that online service, the thing that 
represents you in whatever virtual worlds you decide to use. Each Xbox LIVE account 
consists of the following general features:
Gamertag: 
3
3
This is your identity, or name, on Xbox LIVE, and it will be the 
same name you previously established for your Microsoft account. If you’re 
not happy with this name, you can change it at any time, but Microsoft 
charges $10 each time in order to prevent kids from constantly changing their 
names while playing games. Yes, really.
Gamer Zone: 
3
3
This item describes what type of gamer you are and can be set to 
Recreation, Pro, Family, or Underground.
Gamer Picture: 
3
3
This is a small, usually simple picture that represents you 
online. Subscribers to the free Xbox LIVE service have one Gamer Picture, 
which is shown to all users, while Xbox LIVE Gold gamers can have two: one 
for friends and one for the general populace. (See? That $50 annual fee does 
make sense.) If you have a video camera add-on for the Xbox 360 console, you 
can use that to take a still photo of yourself as a gamer picture, but only for 
friends to see.
Motto:

This is a 21-character textual representation of who you are and what 
you stand for. I’ve used such bon mots as The end is listless and Pwned.
Avatar:

Based largely on the Nintendo Wii’s similar Mii characters, an avatar 
can be designed to look (somewhat) like you, albeit a slightly rotund and car-
toonish you. A typical avatar is shown in Figure 10-12.

Your Xbox LIVE profile consists of the Gamertag, Gamer Zone, Gamer

described previously.
Rep: 
3
3
This is your rep, or reputation score, on a scale of one to five. Every Xbox 
LIVE member starts with a rep of 3, but it can go up or down from there based 
on your experience (where the more you play, the higher the rep) and whether 
any other gamers complain about you online (the more you misbehave, the 
more people complain, and the more your rep declines).
Gamerscore: 
3
3
Each Xbox LIVE game can assign Gamer Points to individual 
achievements, as we’ll soon discuss. These points are applied to your Gamer-
score, which starts at 0 when you open the account. The higher your Gamescore, 
the more experienced you are, generally speaking, though many hard-core 
gamers only play in multiplayer matches that don’t provide multiplayer achieve-
ments and thus might have deceptively low Gamerscores. Likewise, those with 
higher Gamerscores could be achievement point addicts, or even cheating.
Gamercard: 
3
3
Your Xbox LIVE Gamercard combines your Gamertag, Gamer Picture, 
Rep, Gamerscore, and Gamer Zone into a single, easily viewable overview of your 
Xbox LIVE account, or gamer persona.
Messages: 
3
3
Using an e‑mail-like system, Xbox LIVE members can send messages 
to each other using text, audio, and video. These messages aren’t ever broad-
cast via normal e‑mail systems (via the e‑mail associated with your Microsoft 
account), but you can view and respond to received messages, and create new 
ones, on the Xbox 360 and via the Xbox website, as shown in Figure 10-13.
Friends list:
3
3
 As with Facebook and other social networking services, you can 
“friend” other people online, send and receive friend requests, see what your 
friends are doing online in real time, send messages to friends, and more. The 
Xbox LIVE Friends list is sorted by online status, so that online friends are 
listed first.

Xbox LIVE also tracks the games you’ve most recently played on 
the Xbox 360, Windows Phone, and Windows 8, as well as the achievements 
you’ve most recently earned, including all of the achievements earned in each 
played game. Friends can examine your account to see which games you’ve 
played, and which achievements you’ve earned, and compare them to their 
own results.
Xbox LIVE and Xbox LIVE Arcade Games and Achievements
If you’re an avid game player, one of the best reasons to join Xbox LIVE is, well, the 
games. And among the cream of the crop are those games that get people together so 
they can compete against each other online.
On the Xbox 360, the most common of these types of games, the multiplayer 
games, are online shooters, such as those in the Call of Duty, Gears of War, and Halo 
series. But there are many other wildly popular online game types on Xbox LIVE as 
well, including real-time strategy, racing, and, Kinect titles, the latter of which use 
that device’s motion-sensing and voice technologies to provide unique experiences.
Aside from facing off against your friends and others, Xbox LIVE also offers an 
achievements system in which games can offer between 200 and 1,000 achievement 

363
Xbox LIVE and Windows 8
points, usually via a large number of individual achievements. When you do trigger 
an achievement—perhaps by completing an in-game level or other task— the console 
displays the ever-popular Achievement Unlocked notification, providing the name 
of the achievement. You can tap a button on the Xbox 360 controller to learn more, 
including how many achievement points you’ve earned and the description of the 
achievement. You can also view your overall Gamerscore to see how the achievement 
points affected things.
How Many Points?
Although 200 to 1,000 achievement points seems like a wide range, it is, in fact, 
even wider than that.
Xbox LIVE games for Windows Phone, and Xbox LIVE Arcade titles, which tend to 
be shorter and much less expensive than normal Xbox LIVE titles, typically provide 
200 achievement points that can be spread out over up to 12 individual achieve-
ments. Retail Xbox LIVE games for the Xbox 360 and Windows 8 typically provide 
1,000 achievement points, which can occur over as many as 50 individual achieve-
ments. But Microsoft has also expanded the achievement points system for those 
game makers that wish to support their games with add-on packs that extend 
gameplay and provide new features. For those games, it’s possible to have as 
many as 1,750 achievement points, over as many as three separate add-on packs.
Xbox LIVE games also support a feature called leaderboards, which are ranked 
lists that are relevant to the individual game. In a shooter like those in the Call of Duty 
series, for example, there are leaderboard lists for most overall points, most overall 
victories, most victories per game type, and so on.
Xbox LIVE Comes to Windows 8
While Xbox LIVE was originally conceived as an online service for the Xbox video 
game consoles, Microsoft ported it to Windows, poorly, as Games for Windows – LIVE 
in 2006. Games for Windows – LIVE is pretty lackluster, only offering a subset of the 
capabilities you get with Xbox LIVE on the 360. But it still exists and Microsoft has 
pledged to continue supporting it in Windows 8, even though it supports only those 
games that run via the legacy Windows desktop. We won’t examine it in more detail 
here because nothing has changed.

In the years since creating this weird offshoot of Xbox LIVE, Microsoft also created 
the Windows Phone platform, which debuted in 2010. One of the major features of that 
platform was an integrated version of Xbox LIVE.
Unlike Games for Windows – LIVE, Xbox LIVE for Windows Phone wasn’t a horrible 
compromise, and it provided access to great Xbox LIVE games, with achievements 
and other Xbox LIVE features. Xbox LIVE on Windows Phone was so successful, in 
fact, that Microsoft decided to bring it to Windows 8 as well.
So what’s the difference between Xbox LIVE (for Windows 8) and Games for  
Windows – LIVE? It’s two-fold. First, Xbox LIVE works with Metro-style games on 
Windows 8, not desktop-based games. Second, Microsoft has created new Xbox LIVE 
user experiences for Windows 8 that mirror those it created first for Windows Phone. 
These experiences take the form of two apps, for now, called Xbox Games and Xbox 
Companion.
NO TE ​ ​Like so many Metro-style apps in Windows 8, Xbox Games and Xbox 
Companion are connected apps, meaning that they require you to sign in with a 
Microsoft account. As always, it’s easiest if you simply sign in to your Windows 8 
PC or device using a Microsoft account. But if you are using a local account type, 
you can sign in to a Microsoft account the first time you run either of these apps.
Xbox Games
Xbox Games is the front end to all of your Xbox LIVE game activities on Windows 8, 
and oddly enough that includes a ton of Xbox 360-related functionality, too. If you’re 
familiar with the Games hub in Windows Phone, you will see the functional similari-
ties, though the Windows Phone interface lacks the links to Microsoft’s dedicated 
gaming console. And if you’re familiar with the Xbox 360, you’ll immediately recog-
nize that the Metro-style Xbox Games app is very much based on the console’s Dash-
board user experience. You can see this app in Figure 10-14.
Xbox Games is a standard, horizontally oriented, Metro-style user experience, 
but with one twist. Yes, it’s divided into a series of groups that extend from left to 
right, like other Metro experiences. As with the Xbox entertainment apps, Music, 
and Video, Xbox Games does not start up oriented at the left edge of its extended, 
multi-screen user interface. So while you can scroll to the right when you first enter 
the app, you can also, oddly, scroll to the left.
When you do, you’ll see that there are two small groups, Gamercard and Friends, to 
the left of the starting point of the app, at the Spotlight group, as shown in Figure 10-15.
Windows 8 also

including your first name, Gamerscore, motto, location, and bio, plus links to customize 
your avatar, edit your profile, view your and achievements. You can also share your pro-
file and view incoming friend requests.

The achievements interface lets you view your Xbox 360, Windows Phone, Games for 
Windows – LIVE, and Windows 8 game achievements by game or date, with the ability 
to sort between all achievements and unlocked achievements (those you’ve actually 
achieved). As you can see in Figure 10-16, as you scroll to the right, you will see that 
every Xbox LIVE game you’ve ever played, regardless of platform, is accounted for.
 
Figure 10-16: Bask in the glory of your past achievements.
You can also click on individual games—using the box art or Game Details 
button—to see the full-screen landing page for that game in what’s called the Games 
Store (as described later in this chapter). This interface scrolls off to the right and 
provides different capabilities depending on the title, but you’ll see such things as 
a trailer movie, Buy Game for Xbox 360 and Play on Xbox 360 buttons, lists of game 
achievements, extras, and related games, and more. A typical game landing page is 
shown in Figure 10-17. (We’ll examine the Buy Game for Xbox 360 and Play on Xbox 
360 buttons a bit later in the chapter.)

dress up your avatar with new tops, headgear, glasses, wrist wear, gloves, rings, and 
other silliness. The Customize Avatar interface is shown in Figure 10-18.

Spotlight
The Spotlight group is the default view in Xbox Games and functions as it does in 
Windows Store. It’s a place for Microsoft to highlight and promote games and other 
offers that it thinks you’ll find interesting. It’s also, sadly, stocked with a couple of 
outright advertisements, which we find a bit insulting, having recently renewed our 
Xbox LIVE Gold subscriptions at $50 a pop.
Game Activity
The Game Activity group, shown in Figure 10-20, provides a grid of the games you 
most recently played across all of the platforms on which Xbox LIVE is supported, in 
reverse order.
 
Figure 10-20: Your most recently played Xbox LIVE games
If you tap on the Game Activity title, it will present the entire list of Xbox LIVE 
games you’ve ever played, dating all the way back to 2005. In keeping with the game 
activity theme here, the games—each represented by box art—can display messages 
about the activities that friends have done with each. So you may see something 
like 1 beacon, 2 online, or similar noted on individual games, indicating that you’re 
friends are busy having fun online while you’re reading this dry, humorless tome.

When you tap on an individual game, a display pops up to show more information 
about the game, much like the interfaces in the other Xbox apps, Music and Video. 
This can be seen in Figure 10-21.
C ROSSREF  ​The Xbox Music and Video apps are discussed in Chapter 9.
What you see here will depend on the platform of the game that you’ve selected. 
Most games will provide at least some descriptive text about the title. But you can 
also see a number of buttons, including:

Windows Games Store
Now, we can guess what you’re thinking. We just told you that the Windows Store was 
the only place you could find, download, and update Windows 8 games, and yet here 
we are in the Xbox Games app and there’s a group called Windows Games Store. What’s 
up with that?
It’s a fair question.
Behind the scenes, all of Microsoft’s online entertainment services—Xbox LIVE 
Marketplace, Windows Store, Windows Phone Marketplace, the old Zune Music and 
Videos Marketplaces (now called Xbox Music and Xbox Videos, respectively), and so 
on—utilize the same back end. You might think of this back end as Microsoft Market-
place, though to be honest that’s not really the name. But you get the idea. Microsoft 
really has just one online marketplace. But it’s exposed in different places differently.
So, yes, Windows Store is the go-to place for all Windows 8 apps. But if you’re 
just looking for Xbox LIVE games for Windows 8—that subset of Windows games that 
utilize the Xbox LIVE service and thus provide unique features like achievements—
then Windows Games Store does that, and without any distractions. It includes 
featured games, picks for you (based on previously played games), genre lists, and 
more. To be fair, it’s not an actual marketplace; it’s just a group within Xbox LIVE 
games, and a window, if you will, into a very specific subset of Windows Store.
Xbox Game Marketplace
When you consider that Microsoft’s online marketplace for the Xbox 360 is actually 
called Xbox Marketplace, the Xbox Games Store group seems a bit misnamed. But let’s 
not quibble. This group, like Windows Games Store, is really just a view into an actual 
online store—in this case, the Xbox Marketplace—and like the Windows Games Store, 
it provides different views, such as Games on Demand, Demos, Indie, Arcade (for Xbox 
LIVE Arcade), and All Games. You can also sort by genre and arrange the view by best-
selling today, release date, best-selling all-time, top rated, and title.
The Xbox Games Marketplace is shown in Figure 10-22.

371
Xbox LIVE and Windows 8
 
Figure 10-22: Xbox Games Marketplace
What makes Xbox Games Store unique is that it’s basically a place to browse, find, 
and purchase games for the Xbox 360. You do this from Windows presumably because 
it’s a better experience than doing so on the console itself. Like the Game Activity 
group discussed previously, you’ll see buttons such as Play on Xbox 360 and Explore 
Game, and they work just as they do elsewhere in this app. But you’ll also see new 
options like Buy game for Xbox 360. And that means you’ll eventually find yourself 
pushed over to the Xbox Companion app, which happens when you make a game pur-
chase or select the Play on Xbox button. So let’s examine that app next.
Xbox Companion
The Xbox Companion app is based on a similar app for Windows Phone. As its name 
suggests, it’s designed as a companion to the Xbox 360, and as such it is a key part 
of Microsoft’s strategy to better integrate its previously separate Windows and Xbox 
platforms.
The Xbox Companion app is often triggered from other Metro-style apps, including 
Xbox Games, Xbox Music, and Xbox Video. But it can also be run independently.
Before doing so, however, you will need to configure your console to work with 
the Xbox Companion app. To do so, boot the Xbox 360 into the Dashboard and then 
navigate to Settings, System, Console Settings, and then Xbox Companion. There, 
change the setting from Unavailable to Available.
Next, run Xbox Companion in Windows 8 or RT. The app will connect to your console 
and then present a UI similar to the one shown in Figure 10-23, with a number of groups 
laid out in a horizontal, Metro-style UI that should be familiar by now. (Like Xbox 
Games, it features a hidden, leftmost group that you can scroll over to find.)
Xbox Companion

will eventually 
be replaced by a 
similar but more 
full-featured 
app called Xbox 
SmartGlass. This 
app, due by the end 
of 2012, will offer 
a superset of the 
functionality in Xbox 
Companion.

372
C h a p t e r  1 0    Xbox Games with Windows 8
 
Figure 10-23: Xbox Companion
Xbox Companion provides the following groups.
Search
The Search experience, shown in Figure 10-24, is similar to the Bing group on  
the Xbox 360 Dashboard. (And no, we can’t imagine why Microsoft doesn’t use  
consistent naming.)
 
Figure 10-24: Xbox Companion Search
You can type virtually anything Xbox related—a game, movie, or TV show name, 
for example, or perhaps an actor or musical band name—and the app will then show 
search results in a graphical Metro-style interface that is sorted by videos, games, 
and music. For example, a search for Van Halen reveals a number of relevant results in 

373
Xbox LIVE and Windows 8
the music category. The Office, however, will be most relevant under videos, since it’s 
a hit TV show.
Search results work like so many other Metro-style experiences, providing 
options like Play on Xbox 360, Explore Game, Play Trailer, Series Details, and so 
on, which will vary by content type. Since the point of this app is to act, literally, 
as an Xbox Companion, the assumption here is that you’re sitting in front of your 
Xbox 360 and HDTV and using Windows 8 or Windows RT as a large, intelligent 
remote, looking for content that you’ll then play to the console (and thus to your 
HDTV and/or home theater system).
We’ll examine Play on Xbox in just a bit. But the end game for all of the options in this 
app, when you think about it, is to play the selected or found content on the console.
Quickplay
The Quickplay group is an interesting collection of Xbox 360 content—games, enter-
tainment experiences such as Netflix, and the Dashboard itself. When you tap one, 
the Xbox will navigate to that experience (for example, playing on Xbox) and you’ll 
be provided with the full-screen Play on Xbox experience, described at the end of 
this section.
Videos
The Videos group provides a front end to the Xbox 360’s movies and TV shows experi-
ences, which consists of video apps such as ESPN, Hulu Plus, MLB TV, Netflix, Vudu, Xbox 
Videos, and more. As you can see in Figure 10-25, there are tiles for promoted individual 
movies and TV series, but also Explore Movies and Explore TV tiles that will load the 
appropriate Store in the Metro-style Xbox Video app.
 
Figure 10-25: The Videos group in Xbox Companion

374
C h a p t e r  1 0    Xbox Games with Windows 8
Games
The Games group provides a similar treatment for Xbox 360 video games, with some 
tiles for individual games that link to landing pages for those titles, as well as a Dis-
cover Games tile that loads the Xbox Games Store in the Xbox Games app.
Music
The Music group works similarly to the Videos and Games group; a Find Music tile 
loads the Xbox Music interface in the Metro-style Xbox Music app.
Play on Xbox 360: The Xbox Companion’s Reason for Being
What each of the groups in the Xbox Companion app has in common is that all of them 
lead you to one unavoidable outcome: Eventually, you’re going to come across music, 
or a game, TV show, or movie that you will want to play on the Xbox 360 console. And 
while the experience differs slightly from content type to content type, in general the 
effect is the same: You click the Play on Xbox 360 button and Xbox Companion con-
nects to your console, after asking if you mind interrupting your current (Xbox 360) 
session if you’re currently running an app or game on the console.
When this happens, the Xbox Companion app switches to the full-screen dis-
play shown in Figure 10-26. (This will of course vary depending on the content 
type you’ve chosen.)
 
Figure 10-26: While handing off playback to the console, the Xbox Companion displays  
a full-screen interface.

375
Summary
From here, you could use your Xbox controller to control the action. But the 
Xbox Companion can also function as a basic controller. To enable this mode, 
display the app bar and press the Xbox Controls button. The display will change 
to resemble Figure 10-27, letting you navigate through menus by using sliding 
gestures and tapping on virtual buttons to make selections. (You can tap on the 
middle of the screen to emulate the green “A” button.)
You can’t play games with this virtual controller. After all, it only emulates a handful 
of buttons and some simple navigation controls. But with the Xbox 360 being used more 
and more for entertainment experiences of all kinds, Xbox Companion is a great way to 
interact with that content on the console, and to find games, videos, music, and more.

Summary
With Windows 8 aimed squarely at a Metro-styled future, it’s no wonder that the new 
Windows 8 game experiences are Metro-based as well. This version of Windows offers a 
stunning array of games of all kinds through the Windows Store, provides handy organi-
zational features for those who wish to access their favorite games from the Start screen, 
and of course it integrates with Microsoft’s market-leading Xbox LIVE service for the 
first time, offering access to the full range of gaming and entertainment services that 
Microsoft previously provided only on its Xbox 360 console. There are also fun hooks in 
Windows 8 for controlling the Xbox 360 and finding content that can be played to the 
console, with your Windows 8 device acting like a big and sophisticated remote control.

In Windows 8, Microsoft has dramatically recast its storage  
and backup and recovery technologies while offering a familiar selection of other 
related tools that have appeared in Windows for years. This melding of the old and the 
new is, of course, a theme that runs throughout Windows 8, as is the notion of reimag-
ining Windows itself. So while previous Windows versions included ways to recover 
data and the entire OS in the event of a disaster, in Windows 8 these tasks are more 
logically linked together. Because, after all, when you do have to resuscitate a PC, you 
want to resuscitate it all—your data included—and not just the OS.

378
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
To this end, Windows 8 includes technologies such as Storage Spaces, which keeps 
your data safe through hardware redundancy, and File History, a far more useful new 
take on the Previous Versions feature from older Windows versions that makes docu-
ment and data backup and recovery automatic and highly graphical. Best of all, you can 
even combine Storage Spaces and File History into a single cohesive solution that not 
only backs up your crucial data but does so in a way that will survive hardware failures. 
It’s brilliant.
Windows 8 also reimagines PC recovery in ways that will astonish you. Thanks to 
the new Push Button Reset functionality that can return your Windows 8 install to its 
factory-fresh condition, complete with a new car smell, you can also quickly recover all 
of your data, settings, and Metro-style apps as well. And this process generally takes 
just minutes, not the half or full day such procedures would require with Windows 7 or 
the typical PC maker recovery solution. It’s night and day.
This chapter examines these technologies. In some cases, you will need to learn 
some new skills. Trust us, however; it’s worth doing.
NO TE ​ ​We’re all about “new” here. But many Windows 7 recovery features 
do carry forward, mostly unchanged, in Windows 8. These include Windows 
Troubleshooting, the Problem Steps Recorder, System Protection, and 
System Restore.
Storage Basics: NTFS Today, ReFS Tomorrow
While the details have changed fairly dramatically, PCs still interact with storage 
devices—hard drives, solid state storage (SSD), USB memory keys, and the like—the 
same as they ever have. That is, to enable the use of storage, the devices must be 
formatted with a filesystem and then assigned a drive letter so that Windows, or the 
apps and applications that run within this environment, can access their contents.
Over the years, Microsoft’s filesystem technologies have evolved dramatically, 
first with MS-DOS–based filesystems built around the FAT (file allocation table) 
architecture that debuted in Microsoft Stand-Alone Disk BASIC way back in 1977. 
Originally designed for 5.25-inch floppy disks, FAT was evolved over the years to 
support different floppy disk formats and then hard drives of ever-increasing sizes.
When Windows NT debuted in 1993, it included a new filesystem called NTFS that 
had numerous advantages over the FAT-based filesystems Microsoft was still using 
in then-mainstream Windows versions. Without getting into the technical details, 
And go figure,

FAT lives on today 
with a version of 
the system called 
exFAT that is used 
almost exclusively  
on flash storage 
devices.

Storage Spaces
suffice it to say that it was more reliable, efficient, manageable, and, eventually even 
offered better performance though that certainly wasn’t true of the first few versions. 
It also supported much bigger storage devices than the FAT filesystems.
With Windows XP in 2001, Microsoft made NTFS the default filesystem for its OS, 
and in the intervening years, this filesystem has been regularly updated with new 
features and functionality, including support for encryption, quotas, file version-
ing, and much more. And in Windows 8, NTFS is still the default filesystem for storage 
devices, especially hard disks and SSDs. But that’s all about to change.
Concurrently with Windows 8, Microsoft developed a new filesystem that will 
one day replace NTFS. Dubbed the Resilient File System, or ReFS, this new filesystem 
is currently available only in Windows Server 2012, and then only for the file server 
workload. Moving forward, however, Microsoft will extend ReFS first to work else-
where in Windows Server, including as a boot disk. And it will then move ReFS to the 
Windows client as well.
Microsoft has not yet revealed how or when that could happen. So it’s equally 
possible that ReFS support will debut in a future Windows 8 service pack or other 
update, or that it will simply be included in Windows 9.
Compared to NTFS, ReFS is an evolution, not a brand-new filesystem. So it retains 
complete compatibility with NTFS while offering automatic data correction and sup-
port for even larger partition/disk, file, and folder sizes, among other things. ReFS also 
works with the storage features discussed in this chapter, including Storage Spaces.
For now, just know that you will be using the NTFS filesystem almost exclusively in 
Windows 8 when it comes to large capacity storage devices like hard drives and SSDs, 
even though it’s possible in some cases to format them with FAT-based filesystems.
Storage Spaces
NTFS and other filesystems have their advantages, but the reliability of any file-
system is ultimately tied to the weakest link in the chain, the underlying storage 
hardware. It’s a simple fact of life that hard drives (and related storage devices) 
fail, and that when they do so, they often bring your data down with them.
Windows has used various technologies over the years to help overcome the inevi-
tability of data loss. For example, Windows 7 includes a feature called Previous Versions 
that automatically stores document revisions so that you can later go back and resusci-
tate an older document version when needed. It also includes a Windows Backup utility 
that does a decent job of backing up important files, or even the entire PC.

C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
These and other recovery solutions are reactive, meaning they provide help in the 
event of a worst-case scenario, be it the accidental deletion of a file, the overwriting of 
a file with an older, less correct version, or whatever. But they don’t solve the underly-
ing problem of relying on a single hard disk (or other device). They don’t, for example, 
replicate your critical data across two or more disks automatically so that if one drive 
fails, your data is still safe.
Windows 8 includes such a feature. It’s called Storage Spaces, and it works with 
both NTFS- and ReFS-formatted disks, providing a safe, secure, and redundant way 
for you to provision, manage, and use storage that spans multiple disks, replicating 
your data automatically.
Storage Spaces provides two basic services:
Data redundancy
3
3
: Storage Spaces utilizes data mirroring technology to ensure 
that there are at least two copies of data, each of which lives on a different 
disk, to help prevent data loss in the event of a hard disk failure. Storage Spaces 
lets you configure up to three disks for redundancy purposes. (It also supports 
a parity feature, which provides you with two different copies of your data but 
requires three physical disks; the third disk is used for parity purposes.)
Single pool of storage
3
3
: You can organize the storage on your various hard 
disks in one or more storage pools that are managed as a single entity—called 
a storage pool, or simply pool—despite having storage that could span many 
disks. And unlike complex technologies such as RAID, these disks can be of 
multiple different sizes and types, and can include fixed disks (SATA) and 
external storage (like USB). You’re free to mix and match as you like, and add-
ing storage to a storage pool is as simple as plugging in a new disk and adding 
it to that pool using a very simple interface.
Storage Spaces is easy to set up and configure, and once you do that, you can 
pretty much just get on with life and not worry about it anymore. Storage Spaces also 
integrates with File Explorer, much like libraries do. This means you get a normal view 
of the storage from Explorer, and it uses a normal, widely understood drive letter, 
appearing to look and work just like a simple hard drive. This is useful for users, but 
also for the OS and any applications, since they’ll expect such things. This means the 
compatibility of Storage Spaces is excellent.
Storage Spaces also lets you create a space that is bigger than the total amount of 
physical storage. This feature, which is called thin provisioning, lets you preconfigure 
a space to a large size and then add physical storage later, when it’s actually needed. 
Likewise, physical storage is only allocated as it’s needed. (You’ll be prompted when 
needed through Action Center, which uses a Windows Troubleshooting notification.)
Storage Spaces 
3

is conceptually 
related to a 
technology called 
Drive Extender, 
which debuted in 
a product called 
Windows Home 
Server. That said, 
Storage Spaces is 
the superior solution 
and is technically 
unrelated to Drive 
Extender.

381
Storage Spaces
Finally, in addition to working with normal NTFS-based disks, Storage Spaces is 
also compatible with ReFS-based disks. This means that today on Windows Server 
2012, you can optionally mix and match NTFS and Resilient File System (ReFS)-based 
disks. And in the future, you’ll be able to do so on Windows as well.
As is always the case with new technology, Storage Spaces brings with it some 
new terminology. Where a storage pool can consist of the storage on one or more 
disks—though of course you’d need two or more for redundancy—you access this 
storage via a new entity called a storage space, or space. To understand what this 
means, consider how libraries work in Windows 7 and 8. In these operating systems, 
you have physical folders such as My Pictures and Public Pictures, and the combined, 
virtual view of these folders is called the Pictures library. Spaces work the same 
way. You may combine your E: and F: drives into a single pool of storage. But you will 
access that pool through the filesystem using a virtual view called a space, and that 
space will be given a name. In this case, it could be called the Pictures space.
So storage spaces have names and drive letters. But they also have an assigned 
resiliency type. This determines how (or whether) the data stored in the space is 
synced automatically across two or more disks, or what is called redundancy. The 
available resiliency types include:
None
3
3
: In this configuration, the space works exactly like a normal hard drive. 
Data is not mirrored on two or more disks but is instead stored on just a single 
disk. This configuration requires a storage pool with at least one physical disk.
Two-way mirror
3
3
: Here, your data is mirrored on two physical hard disks, pro-
tecting that data from a single hard disk failure. This configuration requires 
a storage pool with at least two physical disks. However, the available storage 
in the pool will be halved, assuming both disks are the same size.
Three-way mirror
3
3
: In this configuration, your data is mirrored on three phys-
ical hard disks, protecting that data from the failure of two hard disks. This 
configuration requires a storage pool with three physical disks. However, the 
available storage in the pool will be one-third the total, assuming all three 
disks are the same size.
Parity
3
3
: In this advanced configuration, your data is mirrored alongside addi-
tional parity information that could help Windows recover data in the event of 
a hard drive failure.
Because spaces have this unique capability to reserve more storage than is 
physically available in the attached disk(s), the feature lets you plan for the future 
by pretending that you have more storage than you do. If the data stored in the 
A parity 
3

configuration is 
notably good for 
storing very large 
files, like videos.

382
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
space begins exceeding your physical capacity, you’ll be notified to add more phys-
ical storage.
Meanwhile, because Storage Spaces uses thin provisioning to allocate only a small 
amount of physical storage when a new space is created, even if you create a space of 
multiple terabytes, only 1 GB of space is actually taken right away.
Getting Ready for Storage Spaces
To use Storage Spaces, you will need at least one additional hard disk or similar storage 
device. It can be an external device (typically USB-based) or internal (SATA, perhaps). 
But if you want to take advantage of Storage Spaces’ redundancy features, you will 
need two or more hard disks. These can be different sizes and types, and any mix of 
internal and external devices. Storage Spaces is very flexible.
When you attach a new hard disk to your PC, it will usually show up in File 
Explorer accompanied by a new drive letter. We assume anyone reading this book  
at least understands this basic Windows functionality.
Of course, things aren’t always this simple. Most PCs need to be shut down before 
internal hard disks can be installed, and sometimes when you add an internal or 
external storage device, it simply doesn’t show up in Explorer. If this is the case, you 
must use the Disk Management tool to format or otherwise enable the disk. The quick-
est way to run Disk Management is to mouse into the lower-left corner of the screen, 
from either the Start screen or the Windows desktop, right-click to display the new 
Windows 8 power user menu shown in Figure 11-1, and select Disk Management.
 
Figure 11-1: A new power user menu provides quick access  
to useful but infrequently needed tools.

system and boot

are typically both

participate in 
Storage Spaces.
You can also

display this handy 
menu by typing 
Winkey + X.

Storage Spaces
Disk Management, shown in Figure 11-2, shows the various physical disks that are 
connected to your PC and graphically displays how each is partitioned. For example, 
Disk 0 in this PC was partitioned by Windows Setup into a system reserved partition, 
which doesn’t get a drive letter and second, larger boot and system partition that’s 
been assigned to drive C:.
 
Figure 11-2: Disk Management
Disk Management has been around since the earliest days of NT, so we won’t belabor 
its use here, but the important thing to note is that this is the first place you should 
look when you add a hard disk to your PC and it doesn’t show up in Explorer. From this 
interface, you can do such things as format a disk, activate a disk, assign a drive letter, 
partition a physical disk into separate logical disks, and shrink and expand existing 
partitions. If it relates to storage, Disk Management is the place to start.
The Most Basic Storage Spaces Configuration of All: 
One Disk, One Space, No Resiliency
The simplest possible Storage Spaces configuration involves just one (additional) 
disk, which you will use to create a single storage pool that can then be divided into 
one or more storage spaces; we’ll use one to keep things simple.
After you’ve added the disk and verified that it’s working in File Explorer, you 
need to access the Storage Spaces control panel, the Windows 8 user interface for 
managing this feature. As a classic Control Panel, Storage Spaces is well hidden, but 
you can find it easily enough by using Start Search (look under Settings, not Apps) 

384
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
or, if you’re more of a desktop kind of person, by using the power user menu or some 
other means to launch Control Panel and the search from there.
However you do it, Storage Spaces will resemble Figure 11-3 when launched the 
first time, regardless of how many additional disks are attached.
 
Figure 11-3: The Storage Spaces control panel
Click the link titled Create a new pool and storage space. After a User Account Con-
trol prompt—you don’t want the commoners mucking around with storage, now—you’ll 
be presented with the display shown in Figure 11-4. Here, Storage Spaces has found a 
single viable disk and is offering to let you use this device to create a new storage pool.
 
Figure 11-4: Creating a new storage pool with just one physical disk

meaning that any 
data on a non-
pooled (that is,

deleted as part of 
the process. You 
can think of this 
as formatting the 
pool, if that helps it 
make sense.

link removes the 
drive letter from 
that storage device. 
You can do this to 
recover that drive 
letter, which you  
may wish to use  
for the space you’re 
about to create.

385
Storage Spaces
To add the disk to a new pool, select it (by clicking the empty check box next to 
the disk) and then click Create pool. A new pool is created and then you are prompted 
to create a storage space that will exist in that pool. Unlike a pool, a storage space 
has a name, a drive letter assignment, and a resiliency type, and it can reserve more 
storage than is physically available. All of these capabilities are configured in this 
screen, which should resemble Figure 11-5.
 
Figure 11-5: After the pool is created, it’s time to create a space within that pool.
For a one-disk configuration, the choices are fairly limited: You can assign a 
name and drive letter of your choosing, but the only resiliency type you can use  
is “Simple (no resiliency),” which for some reason is not automatically selected. 
(The other options require two or more attached disks.)
So select “Simple (no resiliency)” from the Resiliency type drop-down and then 
click the Create storage space button. Storage Spaces creates your new storage space 
and returns to the main Storage Spaces’ control panel view, which will have changed, 
as shown in Figure 11-6, to include the details about your new storage pool and the 
single space it contains. (Additionally, a new Explorer window will open, showing  
the virtual partition that represents your new space.)
You can also expand the physical drives area to see the one-to-one representa-
tion between the actual drive and the space for which it is being used. Obviously, 
this capability gets more interesting—and useful—when you create a space with 
two or more physical disks.

Storage Pool Configuration Options
Once you have configured at least one storage pool, there are a few new options that 
present themselves. All of these are available from the main Storage Spaces control 
panel view, and all but the first three are found within the Storage pool area:
Create a storage space
3
3
: Every storage pool will contain at least one storage 
space. But once you have a storage pool, you can keep adding additional 
spaces as needed. To do so, click the link titled Create a storage space. You’ll 
see the same interface discussed in the previous section, and your options 
will be limited only by the available storage types attached to the PC.
Add drives
3
3
: If you’ve already created a pool and would like to add one or more 
drives to that pool, you do so through the Add drives link. Drives added in 
this fashion will automatically be made available to any spaces within the 
pool. (But note that Storage Spaces does not provide a way to change the resil-
iency or size configuration of a space after the fact, as is discussed a bit later 
in the chapter.)
Rename pool

: By default, a storage pool is silently given the imaginative 
name Storage pool by Windows. You can change this with the Rename pool 

387
Storage Spaces
link though, to be fair, this isn’t something you’ll need to deal with unless 
you’re creating multiple pools for some reason. That’s a fairly advanced con-
figuration and, in our opinion, pretty crazy for even an advanced PC user.
Create a new pool and storage space
3
3
: This link on the left side of the Stor-
age Spaces window will allow you to create other storage pools, and their 
contained spaces, assuming you have the additional disk capacity to support 
such a thing. Honestly, a single storage pool with multiple spaces is probably 
complex enough for most people. But if you have the urge to really overthink 
things, go nuts.
Storage Space Configuration Options
You can also configure various options related to a storage space. These include:
Change
3
3
: You can change various aspects of a storage space after it’s created 
using this link. These include three key storage space options: Its name, its 
drive letter, and its maximum storage space size.
Delete
3
3
: You can delete a storage space as well. This will remove the space only; 
the containing pool is retained along with any attached storage.
Remove (drive)
3
3
: If you have two or more disks being used for a storage space, 
you will see a Remove link next to each. If you click this, the drive is removed 
from the pool and the space, is formatted, and will reappear in File Explorer 
with a new drive letter. If you remove the last drive associated with a pool, 
that pool will be removed as well.
A More Resilient Space: Two Disks, Two-Way Mirroring
While a single-disk storage space has some value, the inability to add resiliency 
at a later date seriously hampers that kind of configuration. As far as we’re con-
cerned, the real value of Storage Spaces begins when you have two or more disks 
you can use in a mirrored setup. This configuration will automatically replicate 
data between two disks, providing you with some measure of protection in the 
event of a hard disk failure.
Consider the screen shown in Figure 11-7. Here in the Storage Spaces interface, 
you can see that the PC has two additional 3 TB drives that it can use as the basis for 
a storage pool and one or more contained storage spaces.
Any data stored 
3
3
on a space is 
deleted when the 
space is deleted. So 
be sure to back up 
anything important 
before continuing.
Note that  
3
3
this option will not 
appear when there 
is only one drive in  
a space.

388
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
To get started, select both of the disks and then click Create pool. As before, the 
storage pool is created and you are shown the screen in Figure 11-8, where you select 
options related to the first contained storage space. This time, you can select a two-way 
mirror for some hardware resiliency. In fact, that resiliency type is selected by default.
 
Figure 11-7: Two additional disks will open up additional configuration options.
 
Figure 11-8: Now you can choose a two-way mirror.

389
Storage Spaces
Note that by default, Storage Spaces selects 2.72 TB (or roughly 3 TB) for the 
maximum size of the space, even though the total pool capacity is twice that. That’s 
because that’s the natural size of the mirrored disks: the combined size halved, so 
that each bit of data will be equally replicated across both physical disks. You can of 
course increase the logical size now and add physical storage later if and when it’s 
needed. In fact, you can basically make it as big as you want. (You can also increase 
or otherwise change the space’s maximum size later if needed.)
Click the Create storage space button to initialize the space. A new Explorer win-
dow opens, too, displaying this new space. But as you can see from the Explorer view 
that opens, it appears as a normal 3 TB disk to the system, even though under the hood 
it is using about 6 TB of actual physical storage spread across two disks. Mirroring 
reduces the available storage, but offers better resiliency. That’s the trade-off.
Back in the Storage Spaces control panel, you can see that once again the new pool 
has been created, along with a single space. But this time the space includes two hard 
disks, as you can see when you expand the Physical drives view as shown in Figure 11-9.
 
Figure 11-9: A two-way mirrored space, as seen in Storage Spaces
Under the hood, of course, a mirrored storage space is far more powerful than 
a single drive. Anything stored within is being replicated across the two physical 
disks, automatically. You could add more spaces to the pool, rename the pool or its 
contained spaces, and perform other management tasks. In fact, if you return to the 
Storage Spaces control panel, you’ll see a number of details about the pool and space 
you’ve created.
Everything

about the space 
is normal from 
an Explorer 
perspective. You  
can even protect  
it with BitLocker  
if you want.

Storage Space Tom Foolery: What Happens When ... ?
Storage Spaces is a pretty amazing feature, and it’s not hard to imagine tying together 
multiple high-terabyte hard drives to create a single pool of redundant storage for a 
massive video collection, music library, or any other data. But such a configuration 
seems to require a desktop computer, and unless you’ve been living under a rock for 
the past few years, you know that most people are turning to laptops, tablets, and 
hybrid portable computers, not traditional desktop computers. Is Storage Spaces only 
a toy for that niche audience of power users that still use desktop PCs? Not quite.
First, it is worth noting that many users with big media collections may indeed want 
to invest in a desktop PC solely so they can use this feature and then share their media 
around the home using the home network. In this way, a fairly pedestrian Windows 8 
PC—albeit one with a ton of storage—could be used as a replacement for a Windows Home 
Server machine or, more likely, network attached storage. It’s just so versatile.
But even for users of portable PCs and devices, Storage Spaces can make plenty of 
sense. Remember, this feature works equally well with internal and external storage, 
so there’s no reason you couldn’t link multiple external drives off your portable PC—or 
better yet, off a dock or USB port extender—and simply use the contained spaces when 
you’re sitting at the desk. When you’re out and about with the PC, it will still work nor-
mally. But when you’re home, or at the office, the space(s) will be available.
OK, but what happens when you start removing disks? Does Storage Spaces freak 
out? It depends.
If you detach all of the storage used by a space at once, the space will simply 
disappear. But when you reattach the storage, the space comes back immediately 
and all is well.
A more slippery slope is encountered when you remove one of the disks being 
used by a space that is configured with two or more disks. In this case, the space still 
exists in Explorer and functions normally. You can read and write to it and access it 
like any other disk. But under the hood, some error messages are being generated, 
and if you look at the Storage Spaces control panel, you’ll see the beginnings of a 
hissy fit developing, as in Figure 11-10. Spaces has detected that a drive is missing 
and, thus, the space’s resiliency is compromised.
Eventually, you’ll receive an Action Center-based notification warning you  
to reconnect the drive. But the system will continue working properly and, if you  
do reconnect the drive, all will return to normal. (This happens almost immediately, 
though Spaces will repair things, meaning it will ensure that the replication between 
drives is accurate and complete.)
But here’s where things get really weird.
In fact, 
3

all of the 
Storage Spaces 
examples used 
in this chapter 
were done on a 
Windows 8-based 
tablet computer 
connected to a dock 
that had several 
USB 3.0-based  
hard drives chained 
to it through a  
USB 3.0-based 
extender.

391
Storage Spaces
 
Figure 11-10: A drive is missing from a mirrored space.
What happens when you use the drive or drives from a space with another  
Windows 8-based computer? That is, you bring home a different laptop from  
work, or whatever, plug in the drives that make up a space on some other machine. 
What then?
Amazingly, incredibly...it just works. Windows 8 will take a moment to install 
the devices the first time, but after a few seconds, you can open Explorer and see 
not the separate drives, but rather the exact same storage space, just as you had 
configured it on the original PC. (With one difference: It won’t necessarily retain 
the same drive letter between PCs.)
This is true regardless of how many of the configured disks you attach, and it 
has amazing repercussions for those who need to blow away a PC configuration but 
retain all the data. By putting your valuable data in spaces, you can be sure it’s all 
immediately available after the fact when you reinstall Windows 8 or simply buy a 
new PC.
Amazing.
NO TE ​ ​We probably shouldn’t be putting this idea in your head, but it’s even 
more amazing than we suggest. You could actually change the configuration of 
the space on the second PC—say by adding a new disk—and when you go back 
to using the space with the first PC, that configuration will carry back as well.

Advanced Storage Spaces: Three-Disk Configurations
There are two final, extreme Storage Spaces configurations, both of which involve 
using three disks with either mirroring or parity. In a three-way mirrored configura-
tion, Storage Spaces works just like two-way mirroring, except, of course, that your 
data is replicated on three physical disks. With parity, again, additional redundancy 
information is written to each disk, which could help with recovery in the event of a 
hard drive failure.
Creating either configuration works much as before, however, this time you will 
need three additional disks. After selecting each in the Create a Storage Pool window, 
you’ll be presented with the screen in which you provide a name, drive letter, resil-
iency type, and logical size for the first space in the pool, as shown in Figure 11-11.
 
Figure 11-11: This time, the Storage Spaces configuration uses three drives.
In a three-way mirror, the total storage pool capacity is of the total capacity of 
the three drives added together, so in this example, with two 3 TB disks and one 
512 GB disk, it’s roughly 6 TB. But a parity configuration, shown in Figure 11-12, is 
a bit different.
Here, the total storage pool capacity is again roughly 6 TB, but the maximum pool 
capacity usage is different than that of a three-way mirror configuration because of 
the way parity works.

When Drives Fail: Storage Spaces Recovery
Earlier, this chapter described the situation where you remove a disk from a storage 
space and then later plug it in again, repairing the space and bringing everything 
back to normal. That’s nice when it happens. But what if a disk goes bad?
Just as you can easily remove disks from a space as noted previously in this chapter, 
you can also add new disks. But since disks are added to pools, not to spaces, you’ll 
need to remove the old, potentially damaged disk first. And then the space will simply 
claim storage on another disk in the pool for its own. Here’s how it works.
Suppose you have a pool that consists of one space, called Space (we know, 
inventive), that’s been configured as a two-way mirror with a logical size of 20 TB, 
and two physical disks, each of which are 3 TB. Over time, the space fills up with 
content—perhaps you’ve been busy ripping your DVD collection to the PC in antici-
pation of an optical disc-less future—and you’re getting close to the 3 TB physical 
space limit. And then disaster strikes: One of the disks goes down for the count, so 
your content is no longer being replicated.

394
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
When this type of thing happens, Action Center will trigger a notification like 
the one shown in Figure 11-13. Click it and you will navigate immediately to Storage 
Spaces so you can fix the issue.
 
Figure 11-13: An Action Center warning about low disk  
capacity in your storage space
In the Storage Spaces control panel, you will see warnings next to the space itself 
as well as the injured disk. If you attempt to remove the bad disk, you may see an 
error message related to data that has to be reallocated. Instead, click the Add drives 
link, select the disk or disks you’d like to add to the pool, and then Storage Spaces 
will do the rest. Eventually, you’ll be able to remove that bad disk from the control 
panel and get back to work.
Note that this would also work if you wanted to replace existing disks with 
larger capacity disks. So when those 4, 5, or 6 TB hard drives come to market, you’ll 
be ready.
File History
Windows 7 included a decent but well-hidden feature called Previous Versions that 
allowed you to recover an older version of a document or other data file, perhaps 
because you made an editing error and then inadvertently saved over the correct 
version. Previous Versions was a first stab at creating a front end for a service called 
Volume Shadow Copy that debuted in Windows Server 2003. And it was fine if you 
knew it was there. But most users didn’t. That’s because you had to right-click on the 
document, choose Properties, navigate to the Previous Versions tab, and hope that 
the appropriate previous version of the file was there.
In Windows 8, Previous Versions has been replaced by a vastly superior feature called 
File History. This feature works much like Previous Versions did, and utilizes updated 
versions of the same back-end technologies. But there are three major differences 

395
File History
between Previous Versions and File History. First, File History isn’t enabled by default, 
so you’ll need to turn it on. Second, File History uses a lot less disk space to perform its 
backups, thanks to new compression technologies in Windows 8 and its ability to cache 
backups on your system disk. And third, File History is about a million times easier to 
use than Previous Versions. OK, we exaggerate. Maybe it’s just a thousand times easier.
What File History Backs Up
By default, File History automatically backs up everything in your libraries, on your 
desktop, in your Favorites, and in Contacts. That’s a lot more stuff than it perhaps 
sounds like; remember that your libraries consist of eight locations by default: My 
Documents, Public Documents, My Music, Public Music, My Pictures, Public Pictures, 
My Videos, and Public Videos.
You can also configure File History to automatically back up other locations of 
your choice or, to not back up certain locations too. If you have a home network with 
a home server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, or a PC with lots of storage, 
you can even configure File History to work across the network, and then automati-
cally recommend that location to others on the homegroup, creating a central loca-
tion for all file backups.
C ROSSREF  ​Chapter 13 discusses homegroups, which is a networking feature 
that makes home-based sharing easier than ever.
To better understand File History, let’s see it in action.
Enabling and Configuring File History
File History, like Storage Spaces, is implemented as a classic control panel. So the 
fastest way to access its configuration interface is to use Start Search. Or, display 
Control Panel via the new power user menu (mouse into the lower-left corner of the 
screen, right-click, and select Control Panel) and then search for File History using 
the preselected search box.
The File History control panel is shown in Figure 11-14. As you can see, it’s disabled 
by default.
On a single disk PC or device, like your typical portable computer, File History will 
recommend using a network location.
Not impressed? 
3
3
Well, if you create 
your own libraries, 
file versions in those 
locations will be 
backed up too, and 
automatically. Come 
on, that’s downright 
impressive.
File History 
3
3
actually caches a 
subset of your file 
backups to your 
system disk. So this 
feature will often 
work just fine even 
when you’re away 
from home with a 
portable computer.

396
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
 
Figure 11-14: File History is disabled by default and will recommend a network location on a 
single disk system.
Alternatively, you can use any other disk, including a removable, USB-based 
hard drive. If you have such a disk attached to the PC, File History will resemble Fig-
ure 11-15, where the other disk is preselected.
 
Figure 11-15: You can use secondary disks for File History as well.
To enable File History, simply click the Turn on button. However, some configura-
tion options are available and should be considered first:
Change drive
3
3
: If you’re not happy with the drive that File History selected, 
click this link to select a new one. The resulting page will help you select a 
new disk, if one is available, or a network location.
Exclude folders
3
3
: If you would like to exclude certain folder locations from 
being backed up, you can do so here. Remember that everything in your 

397
File History
libraries, desktop, Favorites, and Contacts is backed up, so be sure to pick a 
folder inside one of those locations, since other locations are already omitted.
Advanced settings
3
3
: This important interface, shown in Figure 11-16, provides 
some fine-grained control over key File History functionality. You can change 
how often files are backed up, the size of the offline cache (which is the size 
of the File History backups replicated on your system disk), and the length of 
time to save backups. You can also use this interface to clean up (that is, delete) 
older backups and advertise your backup location to others on the homegroup.
 
Figure 11-16: Be sure to spend some time examining these options.
Once you’ve configured File History to your liking, click Save changes to return 
to the main File History screen and then click Turn on. File History will indicate that 
it is saving copies of your files for the first time, but you are free to close the window, 
get back to work, and do other things. You can pretty much forget about File History 
until you need it.
Recovering Documents and Other Data Files 
with File History
When the time comes to recover a lost or previous version of a file, you have two basic 
ways to access the new File History restore functionality. You can relaunch the File His-
tory control panel and click the Restore personal files link. Or, you can use the far more 
discoverable method that’s available right in File Explorer. This latter option makes 
more sense for two reasons. Oftentimes when you’re looking for the previous version 
of a file, you’re staring at that folder anyway. And when you trigger File History restore 
You can also 
3

manually run a 
File History backup 
at any time by 
revisiting the control 
panel and selecting 
Run now.

398
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
from File Explorer, it will navigate automatically to that location for you. So you won’t 
need to hunt around for the file.
Since the second method makes so much more sense, we’ll examine that. Navigat-
ing in File Explorer to the scene of the crime—a folder in which a file was deleted or 
overwritten, perhaps—you will find a History command in the Home tab, as shown in 
Figure 11-17.
 
Figure 11-17: The History command opens File History restore for the current folder.
Click History to display the File History restore interface shown in Figure 11-18.
 
Figure 11-18: File History’s restore interface
This window includes some interesting features. First, the current view shows 
the most recent file revisions, typically from the same day, and generally from a fairly 
recent time period. (If you left File History’s Save copies of files feature on the default 
setting, these versions will be less than one-hour old.) There are navigational elements 
Since the

Explorer ribbon 
is minimized by 
default, you may 
need to expand 
it before you will 
see the History 
command.

399
File History
similar to those in File Explorer that allow you to go Back and Forward, and up one 
level, and you can type an arbitrary Explorer location into the address bar if you’d like.
The Options icon (which resembles a gear) in the top right provides numerous 
options related to icon view styles as well as some restore links. And the Windows Media 
Player-like control at the bottom of the window will let you restore any selected files 
and folders, or all of them. Or you can click the Rewind button to see earlier versions of 
the backed-up files. In fact, if you keep clicking this button, you’ll travel back in time 
(not literally), seeing multiple revisions of frequently-accessed documents as you go.
If you find something you’d like to recover, you have two options: You can 
recover them directly to the same folder, overwriting whatever’s there now; or  
you can recover them to a different location.
To recover files and folders to the same location, just select what you want and 
then click the big blue Recover button. The wizard will ask you if you’d like to replace 
the current files, skip any duplications, or choose which files to keep in the current 
folder; this interface, shown in Figure 11-19, is identical to the normal file remediation 
window one sees when copying files with Explorer.
 
Figure 11-19: File History will ask you what to do with recovered files.
If you’d rather restore files to a new location so you can compare them side-by-
side with the current version, click Options and then Restore to instead. A standard 
Save As dialog will appear, letting you pick the location you prefer.

400
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
NO TE ​ ​Yes, File History looks a lot like the Time Machine feature in Mac OS X, 
minus the ridiculous animations and graphics. To be fair, however, Microsoft 
implemented the underlying technologies behind File History several years 
before Apple copied them with Time Machine.
Better Together? Storage Spaces + File History
File History is an excellent way to ensure that your most valuable documents and 
other files are backed up regularly and available in different historical versions. 
Likewise, Storage Spaces is an amazing Windows 8 feature that provides redundant 
storage for your most valuable data, protecting them from a potential hard drive 
failure. Since File History works with secondary (or network-based) disks by default, 
you may be thinking that there’s no benefit to using these two features together. 
That’s crazy talk.
For the ultimate in data protection, consider creating a storage space with two or 
more disks in a two-way mirror configuration. Then, you can configure File History to 
back up your files to the space, instead of to a normal disk. In fact, you might want  
to advertise this location to other PCs in your homegroup so they can back up over 
the network to this new, super-reliable disk mirror. This will enhance the resiliency 
of all of your backups, no matter which PC you use on the home network.
Like peanut butter and chocolate, File History and Storage Spaces are two great 
tastes that go together. And they form the basis for an amazing centralized home 
network backup solution you can use with multiple PCs. Just a thought.
Using the Windows 8 Recovery Tools
Like previous versions of Windows, Windows 8 includes a full suite of system 
recovery tools that can help fix a non-booting PC and correct other system issues. 
Some of these tools are available from within Windows 8, but since you often need 
them most when Windows won’t boot, they’re also available outside of Windows 
as part of the Windows Recovery Environment, or WinRE. This environment can 
be accessed from the Windows Setup media (DVD or USB flash drive), from a dedi-
cated system recovery disc (or drive) you can (and should) create, or at boot time 
when your PC first turns on. To start, let’s examine how you can create a dedicated 
system recovery disc.

401
Using the Windows 8 Recovery Tools
Creating a System Recovery Disc (or Drive)
Because these tools are so important and are usually needed when something horri-
ble happens, we strongly recommend taking the time to make a system recovery disc 
(or USB-based drive) just in case. You can do this from the Recovery control panel. 
(To find it, open Control Panel and search for recovery. Then, choose Recovery, and 
not Windows 7 File Recovery.) This interface, called Advanced recovery tools, should 
resemble Figure 11-20, providing you with access to a few additional tools.
 
Figure 11-20: Recovery control panel
Click the link titled Create a recovery drive. After a User Account Control prompt, 
the Recovery Media Creator will run. This tool helps you create a bootable USB flash 
drive or, if you prefer, CD or DVD. (The flash drive must have a capacity of at least 256 
MB, and its contents will be erased during the creation process.)
Which to choose? USB is faster and more reliable, but some PCs can’t boot from a 
USB device, so you will want to test this before committing. We recommend starting 
with USB and going from there.
Booting to the Windows Recovery Environment
With Windows 8, you now have a wealth of riches when it comes to booting into the 
Windows Recovery Environment, or WinRE. Of course, you may not be feeling all that 
positive about things if you have to use these tools. Here are the various ways in 
which you can access WinRE.
The Recovery 
3
3
control panel won’t 
even provide an 
option for optical 
disc media if a USB 
flash drive is inserted. 
So if you intend to 
make a disc, be sure 
to unplug any USB 
media first.
The similar  
3
3
tool in Windows 7 
could only create 
optical disc-based 
recovery media.

402
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
… With the System Recovery Drive
If you created a system recovery drive, you can boot from this USB flash drive or disc, 
instead of from the PC’s hard drive as usual, and load the Windows Recovery Environ-
ment. (Interrupting your PC’s normal boot process varies from machine to machine, 
so study the firmware screen that appears when the PC restarts for clues or consult 
your PC’s documentation for the answer.)
… With the Windows Setup Media
Your Windows 8 Setup media can also be used to run the Windows Recovery Environ-
ment. (Interrupting your PC’s normal boot process varies from machine to machine, 
so study the firmware screen that appears when the PC restarts for clues or consult 
your PC’s documentation for the answer.) When you boot from the Setup media, you 
will first be presented with a screen in which you select the language, time and cur-
rency format, and keyboard or input method. Click Next to skip this screen. When 
you do, you will be shown the Install now screen. Instead of clicking Install now, 
however, click the link titled Repair your computer. On the Choose an option screen 
that appears next, click Troubleshoot.
… By Interrupting the Normal PC Boot
In previous Windows versions, you could interrupt the Windows boot process by hold-
ing down the F8 key immediately after the BIOS screen and before the Windows loading 
animation. If you did it just right, you’d enter the Windows Recovery Environment.
Windows 8 makes this much easier. Instead of trying to interrupt the boot 
manually—somewhat impossible on touch-screen tablets in particular, but difficult 
on all Windows 8 PCs because the OS boots so fast—simply navigate into the Metro-
style PC Settings interface and visit the bottom of the General area. There, under 
Advanced startup, you’ll see a Restart now button, as in Figure 11-21. Click that to 
enter the Windows Recovery Environment.
… From the Windows 8 Boot Menu
If you have a PC configured for dual-boot (that is, you can choose between two or 
more operating systems at boot time), you can access WinRE from the boot menu 
that’s already in place. From the main menu, titled Choose an operating system 
screen, click Change defaults or choose other options. Then, in the Options screen, 
click Choose other options, and then Troubleshoot.

403
Using the Windows 8 Recovery Tools
 
Figure 11-21: A new way to boot into the recovery environment
Using the Windows Recovery Environment
However you access these tools, you will eventually reach a Choose your option 
screen that has a Troubleshoot option. From the Troubleshoot screen—the heart 
of WinRE—you will find the following tools, many of which are accessible via the 
Advanced options:
Refresh your PC and Reset your PC

3
: These tools collectively make up a new 
Windows 8 capability called Push Button Reset. It’s so important, that it’s 
examined in the next section.
System Restore
3
3
: This is a legacy recovery capability from previous Windows 
versions that lets you reset the PC configuration to an earlier time, usually 
because you’ve installed a bad hardware driver that has made the system less 
stable. This feature is discussed later in the chapter.
System Image Recovery
3
3
: Another legacy feature and part of Windows Backup, 
this option lets you recover Windows using an image-based backup. Generally 
speaking, most users will not use Windows Backup with Windows 8, but you can 
use this option to recover a Windows 7- or Windows 8-based install if needed.
Automatic Repair
3
3
: This useful option should be your first stop if you are hav-
ing issues booting into Windows. Simply click Automatic Repair and WinRE 
will diagnose your PC, check for disk errors, and attempt a repair. More often 
than not, this will simply work and you’ll be up and running in no time.
This tool is

analogous to

from the Windows

though it fixes other 
errors as well.

Push Button Reset
When you encounter a problem with your PC, be it performance related or otherwise, 
you can now undergo a surprisingly fast process in which Windows 8 is quickly wiped 
out and reinstalled in a factory-fresh condition. This doesn’t require mucking around 
with a Setup DVD or USB media, and it won’t take half the day as it did with Windows 7. 
Instead, Windows 8 includes a new feature called Push Button Reset, and it very well 
may be the single greatest new feature in this operating system.
Push Button Reset is exposed as two separate tools called Reset your PC and 
Refresh your PC, respectively. Both are available from the Windows Recovery Envi-
ronment, as discussed previously. But you can also access both from the Metro-style 
PC Settings interface and from the desktop-based Recovery control panel. Microsoft 
clearly wants to make these capabilities readily available to everyone.
Reset Your PC
3
3
 deletes all of your personal data, apps, and settings from the 
PC, and then reinstalls Windows to its factory-fresh, day-one condition. Dur-
ing the process, everything on the PC hard drive will be erased, so you may 
need to back up crucial documents and other data first.
Refresh Your PC
3
3
 performs similarly, but this amazing utility retains all of 
your personal data, settings, and Metro-style apps (but not legacy desktop 
applications), reapplying them to Windows after it has been reinstalled.
In either configuration, Push Button Reset is amazingly fast. According to 
Microsoft’s own performance analysis, most PC Reset operations will finish in 
roughly 6 minutes, and a PC Refresh will take a bit over 8 minutes. These figures 
have been borne out in our own usage. In fact, they’re conservative.
To be clear, 
3
3
desktop-based 
applications 
like Microsoft 
Office and Adobe 
Photoshop will need 
to be reinstalled 
after using Refresh 
your PC.

405
Using the Windows 8 Recovery Tools
The impact of this tool cannot be overstated. With Windows 7, you could perform a 
clean install of the operating system in about 20 minutes, a major improvement over 
previous versions. But that didn’t include the time and effort required to first back up 
your data, install updates, install applications, copy the data back, and then reapply 
all of your personal settings. With Windows 7, you typically spent the better part of 
day restoring a PC in this fashion. And it’s a time-consuming and boring process with 
lots of downtime.
But it gets better. Push Button Reset is also vastly superior to the old ways of 
wiping out a PC because you can do it at any time. If something goes wrong, just 
Refresh the PC and all will be well. With the Windows 7 tools, you really had to be 
prepared, and then had to go through great time and effort to do it properly.
Critics and conspiracy theorists will point out, correctly, that Push Button Reset 
isn’t a complete PC recovery solution because it doesn’t help at all with traditional, 
Explorer-based applications like Microsoft Office and Photoshop. And that’s a fair 
enough statement, though if Windows 8 is truly successful, these types of applica-
tions will soon only be used by power users and business users for the most part. So 
Push Button Reset, combined with other data backup features in Windows 8, does 
present a fairly complete solution for most average users, especially as they replace 
their old applications with new Metro-style apps over time.
Regardless, even those who do need to install and update a handful of traditional 
Windows applications after the fact will still experience an amazing reduction in the 
time it takes to complete the entire process. This one feature has revolutionized  
the way users restore Windows and get back to work. You’re going to love it.
The following two sections discuss how you can use PC Reset and PC Refresh, 
respectively. As you may recall, these tools are available from the Windows Recov-
ery Environment, but also from PC Settings (in the Metro environment) and the 
Recovery control panel. Because these interfaces are simpler and easier to reach, 
you will often proactively use Push Button Reset, and not as the result of a calam-
ity that renders your PC non-bootable. But you can always use these tools from 
WinRE if you prefer.
Finding Push Button Reset (Metro Version)
To access the Metro-style interface for Reset your PC, visit PC Settings and navigate 
to General. Near the bottom of the list of General PC settings, you will see the options 
Refresh your PC without affecting your files and Remove everything and reinstall 
Windows. These represent Refresh your PC and Reset your PC, respectively.
Now, follow the instructions in one of the following two sections, depending on 
which you’d like to accomplish.

406

Using PC Reset: Wiping Out Windows and Starting Over
When you click the Get Started button under Reset your PC and start over, a full-
screen Metro-style notification like the one in Figure 11-22 will appear.
 
Figure 11-22: The Reset your PC screen explains what’s about to happen.
This notification alerts you that the PC Reset process will delete all of your per-
sonal settings, files, and apps.
Click Next to continue.
If you have more than one drive, PC Reset will ask whether you’d like to remove 
all files from all drives, or just from the drive on which Windows is installed. Make 
a choice, and then PC Reset will ask you to choose between quick and thorough file 
removal types, as shown in Figure 11-23. The second, more thorough option is useful 
if you wish to sell or give away the PC to others, but the first, quicker version is what 
you’ll want when you’re simply resetting the PC for your own uses.
Next, PC Reset declares that it is ready to reset the PC. Click the Reset button  
to continue.

Accessing System Image Backup and Recovery Functionality with Windows Backup
PC Reset will reboot the computer and quickly reinstall Windows. Your customized 
settings, data, and apps will all be deleted. After a few minutes and a few reboots, you 
will be presented with a shortened version of the Windows Setup procedure, during 
which you will agree to the Windows license terms and then complete the out-of-box 
experience (OOBE), where you configure some features and sign in for the first time. 
(Chapter 2 describes this procedure.) This makes sense, as you are essentially configur-
ing this PC as if it were brand new.
Once this process is complete, you will sign in and arrive at the Start screen.
Using PC Refresh: Restoring Windows Along with Settings, Data, 
and Metro-style Apps
When you click the Get Started button under Refresh your PC without affecting 
your files, a full-screen Metro-style notification will appear, alerting you that the PC 
Refresh process will retain all of your personal settings, files, and apps. However, tra-
ditional Windows desktop applications will be removed.
Click Next to continue.
PC Refresh is now ready to reset the PC while saving your personal settings, data, 
and Metro-style apps. Click the Refresh button to continue.
Your PC will restart and undergo the process of setting aside your personal set-
tings, data, and apps, reinstalling Windows, and reapplying those items back to the 
new install. This will occur over your device’s firmware screen or, on a traditional PC, 
on a screen that resembles the Windows boot animation.
After a few reboots, Windows 8 will simply return to your familiar lock screen. 
Sign in as before and Windows will indicate that it is preparing for a few moments. 
Then you’ll be returned to the Start screen, just as you left it.
You should then navigate to the Windows desktop, where you’ll find a web docu-
ment listing the (classic) applications that PC Refresh removed. This list will help you 
get started reinstalling, as many web-based apps will be helpfully hyperlinked.
Accessing System Image Backup and Recovery 
Functionality with Windows Backup
In Windows 7, the backup and recovery story centered on a very useful tool called 
Windows Backup, which offered two basic features: It could be used to back up 
certain locations and their contained data to another hard disk, optical disc, or 
Obviously, you 
3

should still ensure 
that your data has 
been backed up 
before using Refresh 
your PC. Better safe 
than sorry.

408
C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
network share, and it could make system image backups of the entire PC, which 
could be used to recover Windows, its data and customizations, and applications 
and application states.
Windows Backup seems like the full-meal deal, so you may be surprised to dis-
cover that it’s been relegated to also-ran status in Windows 8. Yes, it’s still there. But 
Microsoft went to great pains to hide it. So naturally, we’re going to tell you how to 
find it.
First, though, a short discussion about why this happened. If you’ve been reading 
this chapter, you know that Windows 8 includes amazing new tools related to storage, 
backup, and recovery. And that these tools separately allow you to fully recover a PC, 
and, optionally, all of your data, settings, and Metro-style apps in just minutes (Push 
Button Reset). Further, they let you recover not just backups of your most important 
documents and other data, but also an extensive collection of data file revisions (File 
History). Both of these tools separately answer different needs. But collectively, they 
accomplish almost all of what most people used Windows Backup for, and more impor-
tant, they do so far more quickly.
This reasoning won’t matter very much to you if you have a collection of Windows 
Backup-based backups from Windows 7 that you still want to access. Or perhaps 
you’re simply just familiar with Windows Backup, like how it works, and wish to con-
tinue using this solution.
You can. But, boy, does Microsoft make it difficult.
Try to find Windows Backup from Start Screen Search, or by searching the classic 
Control Panel, and you’ll come up blank. The term backup yields results for File His-
tory only, and a search for windows backup will actually come up empty. It’s almost 
like they don’t want you to find it.
But fear not, it’s there. Just search for recovery instead—from the Start screen or 
Control Panel—and you’ll see a result called Windows 7 File Recovery. This, as it turns 
out, is both the way to access Windows Backup and a none-too-subtle reminder that 
Microsoft really wants you to consider using something else.
Say the magic words correctly and you’ll see the Windows 7 File Recovery control 
panel shown in Figure 11-24. From this window, you can do everything you used to 
do in Windows Backup.
Just don’t tell Microsoft we told you about this one.
But seriously, 
3
3
you should be using 
the new tools in 
Windows 8, and not 
Windows Backup. 
The only real 
exception is that 
you have to access 
a previously created 
backup for some 
reason. That’s really 
why this tool is still 
in Windows 8.

409
What’s Missing: Cloud Backup
 
Figure 11-24: Windows Backup lives in Windows 8 as the Windows 7 File Recovery control panel.
What’s Missing: Cloud Backup
While Windows 8 offers a fairly complete selection of backup and recovery tools, 
many of which are discussed elsewhere in this chapter, there is one key piece of the 
puzzle missing, and that’s cloud-based backup. That is, in addition to backing up 
key data locally to another drive attached to your PC or, better still, to a completely 
different PC or device on your home network, you should consider having an off-site 
data recovery solution in place. This will provide that final measure of safety should 
a real-world disaster occur, such as a fire or theft.
To better understand the scope of this issue, consider how Windows 8’s various 
backup and recovery tools work together to keep your PC and its contained data safe. 
At the most basic level, you can use the Push Button Reset functionality to quickly 
recover the operating system and, optionally, your data, settings, and Metro-style 
apps. So even in the worst-case scenario, software-wise, all you’ll lose are your tradi-
tional Windows applications, which will need to be reinstalled.
Of course, recovering the operating system is only one layer of safety and this won’t 
help with your precious data—documents, photos, and so on—if the PC’s hard drive 
fails. So Windows 8 also offers a nice File History feature, which backs up not just your

C h a p t e r  1 1    Storage, Backup, and Recovery
data, but the various revisions of your data as well. And it does so to secondary storage—
another hard drive attached to your PC—or to a network location, further enhancing 
resiliency with physical separation.
You can enhance data storage in general, or File History specifically, with Storage 
Spaces as well. This amazing feature lets you mirror data across two or three disks, 
again providing protection in the event of hardware failure.
Old-timers, or those who simply can’t let go of the previous ways of doing things, 
can take advantage of Windows 7-era backup and recovery features too, including 
various troubleshooting tools, System Restore for repairing bad driver installs and 
other issues, and even Windows Backup, for complete end-to-end PC image backups.
But none of these solutions will help if your home is destroyed, or the PC and its 
hard disks are stolen. What you need to complete this end-to-end backup and recovery 
picture is off-site storage. You need cloud backup.
Sadly, this is the one backup and recovery solution that Microsoft doesn’t explicitly 
provide in Windows 8. You could, of course, pay for SkyDrive additional storage, use 
the SkyDrive application or a third-party solution to provide Explorer-based access 
to Microsoft’s cloud service, and then back up data in that fashion. We happen to like 
using SkyDrive for this purpose, since it keeps valuable documents, photos, and other 
files synced between PCs and the cloud. The SkyDrive app’s folder structure can be seen 
in Figure 11-25.
 
Figure 11-25: Using SkyDrive instead of regular folders to keep content synced with the cloud.

411
Summary
Or you could use a third-party service such as CrashPlan—which we’re both using 
because of its low cost and excellent performance—Carbonite, or similar.
While we wish that Windows 8 completed the picture, there are certainly enough 
cloud backup services out there to satisfy anyone’s needs. Just be sure to use one of 
these services, as ultimately, the responsibility to protect your data is yours alone.
Summary
On the face of things, a topic like storage, backup, and recovery doesn’t seem very 
exciting. But here’s an amazing fact: Of all the new features and functionality in 
Windows 8, our two favorite, by far—Storage Spaces and Push Button Reset—are 
covered in this chapter. What a turn of events.
It all starts with the new storage features in Windows 8, the key of which is Storage 
Spaces, a way to elegantly and easily mirror multiple disks of multiple types and sizes, 
creating redundant pools of storage you can use as you see fit. Building on this is File 
History, an improved take on the Previous Versions feature from Windows 7 that auto-
matically backs up multiple versions of your most important data files so you can always 
find the one you want.
Windows 8 also improves on the Windows recovery toolset and in a dramatic 
fashion. There are new and improved versions of legacy recovery tools, of course, 
but also brand-new tools like PC Reset and PC Refresh, components of a Push But-
ton Reset functionality that lets you very quickly take a balky Windows install and 
make it new again.
Put this all together and you see a version of Windows that is safe and reliable and 
easily and quickly made right should something go wrong. This alone is an amazing 
achievement. That it is but a small part of the list in improvements in Windows 8 sug-
gests that this is a mighty new OS release indeed.

Everyone who uses Windows knows that you typically sign in,  
or “log in” as we used to say, to the PC using an account with which unique settings, 
documents and files, and even applications are associated. The types of accounts we’ve 
used in Windows have certainly evolved over the years, but for the most part, there 
have been two basic kinds of sign-ins: domain accounts, which are used exclusively by 
corporations, and local accounts, which are specific only to the PC on which they are 
used; home users and most individuals have always used this latter account type.
In Windows 8, Microsoft is introducing a new type of sign-in that is tied to a Micro-
soft account, or what used to be called a Windows Live ID. (With Windows 8, Microsoft is 
eliminating Windows Live as a brand, but is continuing its most popular products and 
services, often with new names.) As you’ll discover, this new account type is really just a 
formalization of a capability that debuted in Windows 7, but it takes on new prominence 
in Windows 8 thanks to this system’s pervasive PC-to-PC sync capabilities.

414
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Windows 8 also provides interesting new choices for signing in, augmenting the 
long-lived password system with some new choices that may make more sense on today’s 
modern Windows devices and PCs. As always, securing your PC against electronic and 
human attack is job one for Windows 8, and in this version of Windows, you have more 
tools than ever to help ensure that your PC and its valuable data are safe.
But it all begins with your user account. So let’s look at that first.
User Accounts
Once relegated only to the corporate market, where they have always made sense 
because of their security and permissions boundaries, user accounts are central to 
today’s PC experience—so central, in fact, that you establish your user account when 
you first install Windows or set up your new PC.
Of course, user accounts aren’t generally as restrictive at home as they are at 
work. It’s your PC, after all, and most people rightly feel that they should be able 
to do anything they want on their PC. So that first user account you create, during 
Windows Setup, is automatically an administrator-class account, providing the 
permissions and access control that one would expect.
These local user accounts, or what we used to call workgroup accounts, work well 
enough for what they are. And they allow for some niceties, even at home. You can 
create multiple accounts on a single PC, giving users their own sign-in identity, along 
with its associated custom settings (desktop wallpapers and so on) and Windows and 
application configurations.
But local user accounts are starting to show the strain of time, and as our PC 
usage changes, so do the needs we place on them. For example, most people don’t 
bother to protect their own user accounts with a password, which can have huge ram-
ifications in the event of a stolen PC. Local accounts are literally local to that one PC 
and thus hard, if not impossible, to replicate across machines; if you have more than 
one PC, as so many of us do now, making each one look and work the same is tedious. 
Local accounts make home network sharing difficult, too, which is why Microsoft cre-
ated the homegroup sharing technique for Windows 7.
What’s interesting is that Microsoft basically solved these issues over a decade 
ago when they instituted the Active Directory domain services scheme in Windows 
Server. This system, which is used by corporations around the world, provides a more 
centralized approach to user accounts (and other things). So instead of signing in 
to a single PC and locking all of your personalized settings to that one machine, you 
Families can 
3
3
further manage 
accounts using 
parental controls, 
which we’ll 
examine later in 
the chapter.

415
User Accounts
sign in, instead, to the domain. And if you need to access a different machine, your 
customized experience can travel with you, so to speak, from PC to PC. With this 
scheme, the settings you typically think of being associated with an account are no 
longer locked into a single PC.
Active Directory is powerful and interesting, but it’s also far too complex for a 
home network and of course requires expensive and complex servers in addition to 
the PCs that people actually use each day. So this system isn’t well-suited for regular 
users at home.
So for Windows 8, Microsoft has created a new type of user account, based on your 
Microsoft account (previously called Windows Live ID) that provides many of the 
niceties of Active Directory but with none of the complexity. In fact, for most people, 
signing in to a Windows 8 PC with a Microsoft account is just as easy as doing so with 
a traditional local account. But there are numerous advantages to doing so.
So let’s examine them as part of a wider discussion about the types of accounts 
you can use with Windows 8.
Understanding Account Types
Windows 8 lets you sign in using three different types of accounts: domain, local, 
and Microsoft.
Domain Accounts
Domain accounts are used by corporations that utilize an Active Directory infrastruc-
ture running on top of Windows Server. The account is centrally managed by your 
employer, as are whatever permissions and capabilities you may be able to enjoy.
You connect Windows 8 to a domain as you did with previous Windows versions, 
using the advanced system control panel. Once the domain is configured, you reboot 
the PC and then sign in with your domain account’s username and password. In use, 
Windows 8 works almost identically to a local user account, but you lose some of the 
integration pieces that are special to Microsoft account sign-ins. As we’ll see in just a 
bit, there is a simple way to mitigate that issue.
Local Accounts
In Windows XP, Vista, and 7, most home users signed in to their PC using a local 
account, or an account that is, literally, local to that one PC. Local accounts are typi-
cally one of two account types, administrator or standard. An administrator essen-
tially has complete control of the system and can make any configuration changes 
V413HAV

416
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
they want. A standard user can use most application software and many Windows 
services, but is prevented from accessing features that could harm the system. For 
example, standard users cannot install most applications, change the system time,  
or access certain Control Panel applets.
In previous Windows versions, most people simply used an administrator-type 
account because standard user accounts were so limiting and annoying. But with the 
move to multi-PC households and the PC-to-PC sync capabilities one gets with using 
a Microsoft account instead of a local account, our expectation is that the vast major-
ity of Windows 8 users will no longer use local accounts. It’s still supported, of course, 
but it’s just depreciated.
Microsoft Accounts
Signing in to a Microsoft account is now the default, and preferred, way of doing 
things. A Microsoft account provides you with all of the benefits of a local account—
simplicity and the ability to have both administrators and less privileged users—plus 
the benefits of the multi-PC settings replication of a domain account, and, of course, 
integration with Microsoft’s online services and third-party services like Facebook, 
Twitter, and more.
But the Microsoft account is more than a nicety. It’s required for many of the 
Metro-style apps that are built into Windows 8, including the productivity apps—
Mail, Calendar, People, and Messaging—the digital media and Xbox apps—Xbox 
Music, Xbox Video, and Xbox LIVE Games—and more. Windows 8 was designed to 
integrate deeply with a Microsoft account, much like Windows Phone before it. And 
a Microsoft account is super easy to use.
For these reasons, we believe that signing in with a Microsoft account is the 
obvious choice for most Windows 8 users. Furthermore, we pretty much assume 
that you’re using a Microsoft account throughout this book because of the advan-
tages of doing so.
There’s just one problem. In some cases, you can’t sign in to your PC with a 
Microsoft account the first time you set up Windows 8. For example, if your PC is 
offline the first time you use Windows 8, a Microsoft account won’t even be offered. 
But the more obvious example, perhaps, is a work PC: There’s no way that corporate 
will let you or other users bypass the built-in security features of their carefully 
crafted policies and sign in with your personal Microsoft account.
If only there was a way around this limitation.
You can bypass 
3
3
this limitation 
by entering the 
credentials for 
an administrator 
account. You do so 
using a feature  
called User Account 
Control, which we’ll 
examine later in  
this chapter.

417
User Accounts
Making the Most of a Domain or Local Account
If you are signing in to a PC with a domain or local account, there are some changes 
you can make to provide you with the best possible experience. Which you do will 
depend somewhat on whether you’re currently signing in to Windows 8 with a local 
account or a domain account. These changes include:
Switch a local account to a Microsoft account:
3
3
 If you opted out of the Micro-
soft account sign-in when you first set up Windows 8, perhaps because you 
were confused by this new account type and simply wanted things to be as 
close as possible to the way it was in Windows 7, Microsoft actually lets you 
change your local account after the fact and switch it to a Microsoft account.
To make this change, navigate to PC Settings and then Users. Then, under 
Your account, click the Switch to a Microsoft account button, as shown in 
Figure 12-1. Voila! Problem solved.
 
Figure 12-1: You can convert your local account to a Microsoft account at any time.
Connect
3

 a domain account to a Microsoft account: If you’re using a domain 
account, you can’t switch it to a Microsoft account. But you can link your 
domain sign-in with your Microsoft account, achieving the same benefits as 
you’d get by simply signing in with a Microsoft account. In the business, this 
is what we call a “best of both worlds” solution.
To do so, navigate to PC Settings and then Users. Under Your account, click 
the Connect your Microsoft account button. When you do, the screen shown 
in Figure 12-2 appears. Here, you choose which PC settings you’d like to sync 
with your domain account.
You cannot do 
3
3
this with a domain 
account. Only a 
local account can 
be switched to a 
Microsoft account.
You can also  
3
3
use this same 
interface to switch  
from a Microsoft 
account to a local 
account. And no,  
we can’t think of a 
single reason why  
you’d want to  
do this.

418
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
 
Figure 12-2: You can connect a domain account to a Microsoft account and even 
choose which settings to sync.
After choosing which settings to sync, you will sign in to your Microsoft account 
and confirm or enter your security verification information, just as you do when 
you sign in with this type of account normally. And from now on, you can use 
Microsoft’s account services—and the bundled apps in Windows 8 that take 
advantage of them—seamlessly, without needing to sign in with each app. Actu-
ally, it’s even better than that: Some apps simply won’t work unless you sign in 
with a Microsoft account. This linking process makes them work.
Why This May Not Work
Okay, there’s a huge gotcha to this scheme. (You had to sort of expect there 
was going to be one.) It goes like this: Your domain administrators simply may 
not allow it. Whether they do will depend on a number of factors, but it all boils 
down to whether your environment is highly controlled. So all you can do is try 
and hope for the best.
Sign in to app groups with a Microsoft account: 
3
3
There is a third approach, 
one that provides a more limited way to access some Microsoft account good-
ness, but without changing your domain or local account in any way. That is, 
instead of linking or switching your existing sign-in account, you can simply 

419
User Accounts
try to run one of the connected apps in Windows 8 and then sign in when 
prompted by a screen that will resemble Figure 12-3.
 
Figure 12-3: If you can’t or won’t use a Microsoft account, you can instead sign in to  
various app groups.
This approach isn’t as sophisticated as using (or linking) a Microsoft account. 
You’ll need to sign in a few different times, to different app groups—Microsoft 
considers the productivity (or what it calls “communications”) apps to be one 
group, for example, and the Xbox (media and games) apps to be a separate group. 
And you don’t get the PC-to-PC settings sync functionality that’s available with 
a real Microsoft account sign-in. But if you don’t have a choice—or are just really, 
really stubborn—this will at least let you use the built-in Metro apps to their 
fullest.
Managing Accounts
In previous Windows versions, we managed local user accounts in Control Panel, a desk-
top user interface that dates back to the earliest days of Windows. But in Windows 8, 
basic user account management tasks now occur within the Metro-based PC Settings 
instead, while, confusingly, a few more advanced or esoteric features can still be found 
in legacy control panels. So you may find yourself moving back and forth between the 
two environments depending on your needs.
Let’s start with the basics.

420
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Managing Accounts in PC Settings
Like many Metro interfaces, the Users section in PC Settings is almost disarmingly 
simple. As you can see in Figure 12-4, this UI lets you manage features related to your 
own and other user accounts. (This figure displays the version of this screen that 
most users will see, since it depicts a Microsoft account.)
 
Figure 12-4: PC Settings provides a new user management interface.
These features, which vary somewhat depending on the type of account you use 
to sign in, can include:
Switch to a local account/Switch to a Microsoft account: 
3
3
If you’re signed in 
with a Microsoft account, there is a Switch to a local account button that will 
let you do just that, albeit at the expense of losing all of the included func-
tionality one gets with such an account type. If you are signed in with a local 
account, however, you will see a Switch to a Microsoft account button instead.
Connect your Microsoft account/Disconnect your Microsoft account: 
3
3
Those 
who are signed in with a domain account (used only in corporations and other 
businesses) will see a button, Connect your Microsoft account, as described ear-
lier in this chapter. If you’ve already connected your domain account to a Micro-
soft account, you will see a Disconnect your Microsoft account button instead.
Change your password: 
3
3
Those with local or Microsoft account sign-ins can 
change their password at any time using this button. Domain users will not 
see this option; instead, you can type Ctrl + Alt + Del and choose the Change a 
password option from the full-screen menu that appears. However, your abil-
ity to actually change your password will be based on corporate policy. (And, 

421
User Accounts
in fact, many businesses may require you to change passwords on a regular 
schedule, whether you want to or not.)
Create a picture password/Change a picture password: 
3
3
With the advent 
of touch-based Windows devices, including tablets and other touch screen 
devices, Windows 8 now offers two fun and efficient new ways to sign in to 
your computer: picture password and PIN (the latter of which is described 
next). Neither replaces your normal password. Instead, you can use either 
to implicitly sign in to the system using your actual password, but using a 
method that is simpler (and, in this case, a bit more fun) than a normal pass-
word. This is especially useful because tapping out a long password on a touch 
screen can be tedious.
A picture password is essentially a photo over which you trace any combination 
of three circles, lines, and/or taps, using the device’s touch screen. You might 
imagine a picture of a family member where you “poke” them in each eye and 
then draw a smile over their lips as an example of this type of sign-in (though 
not necessarily one you would want to choose to use, since such a combination 
of swipes is fairly obvious and could undermine the security of your PC).
Creating a picture password requires completing a short wizard. After providing 
your password to prove that this is your account, you’re prompted to choose the 
photo you’ll use. Obviously, you can use any photo of your choosing.
Once you’ve selected the picture and the wizard has verified this selection, 
you’ll be prompted to set up your gestures, as shown in Figure 12-5. Here, you 
choose the three gestures you want to use—again, any combination of three 
circles, lines, and/or taps—as your sign-in.
 
Figure 12-5: Creating a picture password

422
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
The wizard will make you repeat the gestures to ensure that you’ve got the 
sequence memorized correctly, and then you’re good to go. You can later 
change the picture password or remove it.
Common Sense Security Tips for Picture Password
With the understanding that common sense is a key aspect of anyone’s personal 
security regimen—and, on the flip side, that human error is almost certainly the 
number one factor behind most security mishaps—we feel compelled to remind 
readers that picture password, like any other authentication scheme, is only 
as secure as you make it. So use some common sense when creating a picture 
password, keeping the following tips in mind:
Complexity: 
3
3
It’s not hard to guess that a picture password that uses a 
person’s headshot as the picture most likely involves poking both eyes and 
making a smile across the lips. Be more creative than that and use a photo 
that is more complex, with less obvious points of interest.
Use different gestures: 
3
3
Three identical straight lines do not secure a 
picture password make. Consider mixing it up, using a combination of taps, 
straight/curved lines (in both directions), and circles that move in both  
directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise).
Physically shield the screen: 
3
3
You wouldn’t let strangers watch you enter 
your bank card’s PIN at a cash machine. Don’t let onlookers see your  
picture password . . . no matter how cute you think it is.
Clean the screen: 
3
3
Today’s touch-screen devices leave indelible smudges 
each time you tap or gesture. So be sure to keep your screen clean, reduc-
ing the chance that someone could tilt the device in the light and quickly 
guess which gestures you use to sign in.
You’re not locked 
3
3
into using this or 
any other sign-in 
type. You could 
have a password,  
a picture password, 
and a PIN all 
configured for  
the same account 
and then choose 
which to use at 
sign-in time.
Create (or change) a PIN: 
3
3
If you’ve ever used a smartphone, you know that 
four-digit PINs, or personal identification numbers, are the norms for securely 
signing in on such devices. This sign-in option allows you to use the same 
convenient sign-in type on your Windows PC or device, and while it’s particu-
larly nice for touch-screen devices, we’ve both switched to using this sign-in 
type on our traditional desktop PCs, too, since it’s so fast. Setting up a PIN is 
very straightforward, and each digit must be a number.

423
User Accounts
NO TE ​ ​Oddly enough, you can use the picture password and PIN sign-in types 
even with a domain account. However, some corporations have very strict pass-
word policies, so as is the case with other options in this chapter, you may not 
be able to use these features with a work-based domain account.
Add a user: 
3
3
If you select the Add a user link under Other users, you’ll be pre-
sented with the new full-screen interface shown in Figure 12-6. It’s set up for 
a Microsoft account by default, but you can click the link titled Sign in with-
out a Microsoft account to configure a traditional local user account instead.
 
Figure 12-6: Add a user, Metro-styled
So, yes, you can mix and match Microsoft and local accounts (and even domain 
accounts) on a single PC, though our general rule about using Microsoft accounts 
exclusively when possible still applies for your own PCs.
Advanced User Management with Control Panel
PC Settings is cute and everything, but if you want to dive into the nitty-gritty of 
user account management, you’ll need to visit the old-school Control Panel interface 
instead. And yes, you still want to know about this interface even if you’re not par-
ticularly interested in advanced features. And that’s because there are certain things 
related to account management that you can only do from Control Panel.
For example, the very first account you create with Windows 8 is always an 
administrator-class account, and that’s true whether that account is a Microsoft 

424
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
account, as recommended, or a traditional local account. But when you create 
other accounts, as explained earlier, those accounts are not administrator-type 
accounts. And the Metro-style PC Settings interface doesn’t offer any way to 
change them.
But Control Panel does. In fact, Control Panel provides so much additional func-
tionality with regards to user accounts that it seems a shame to ignore it.
Of course, you need to find it first. The easiest way is via Start Search: Display the 
Start screen, type user, select the Settings filter in the right pane, and then choose 
User Accounts in the results list. This displays the old-school User Accounts control 
panel, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
Figure 12-7: User Accounts control panel
Here are some of the user account–related tasks you can only complete using 
Control Panel:
Change an account type: 
3
3
As noted previously, the first account you configure 
on your PC—whether it’s a Microsoft account or a local user account—is an 
administrator-type account. But what about subsequent accounts? As it turns 
out, all subsequent account additions—be they Microsoft or local accounts—
are created as standard users, not administrators. This may be desirable, but 
if you’d like to change an account from one type to the other, you can do so.
If you have 
3
3
only configured one 
user account, you 
cannot, however, 
change it from 
an administrator-
type account to 
a standard user 
account. You must 
always have one 
administrator 
configured on  
the PC.

425
User Accounts
To change an account’s type, click the link Manage another account in the User 
Accounts control panel. This will change the display to resemble Figure 12-8, 
where you can choose an account to change.
 
Figure 12-8: The Manage Accounts interface lets you configure user accounts.
Select the account you wish to modify to display a screen like that in  
Figure 12-9. Here, you can see a secondary Microsoft account that was 
automatically configured as a standard account type when it was added  
to the system.
 
Figure 12-9: If it doesn’t say Administrator above “Password protected,” it’s not  
an administrator.
Click the Change the account type link, choose Administrator, and then click 
the Change Account Type button. Now, you can see as in Figure 12-10, that 
this other Microsoft account is an administrator too.
When working 
3
3
with a local 
account, you 
can also use this 
screen to change 
the account name, 
create or change 
the password, set up 
parental controls, or 
delete the account.
When working 
3
3
with a Microsoft 
account, you can 
also use this screen 
to set up parental 
controls or delete  
the account  
(from the PC).

Manage User Account Control: 
3
3
In Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced what 
was then a very controversial feature called User Account Control, or UAC, which 
took advantage of Microsoft’s efforts to componentize Windows by dividing 
each of the system’s functional entities, or components, into one of two groups: 
those that require administrative privileges and those that don’t. Those that 
don’t would just work and you could just go about your day and not really think 
about the security implications of anything underpinning the system.
But then there are those other components that do require an administrator-
class account to actually work. Those components are a bit trickier. These 
components will trigger a UAC dialog, or prompt, that must be bypassed before 
you can continue whatever task you are trying to complete.
UAC is theoretically annoying, but it’s been refined over the past two Windows 
versions to be, well, less noisy. That is, it doesn’t rear its head very often any-
more, and if you’re logged in with administrator privileges—and chances are, 
you are—it will rarely do more than interject a small “Are you sure?” type dialog 
to interrupt your workflow.
This interruption will vary according to what you’re trying to do—a UAC 
prompt appears when you try to install an application, for example—and 
according to what type of user account you’re using. But the important thing 
to note is that the presentation of UAC prompts hasn’t really changed since 
Windows 7. So unless you’ve been using Windows XP for the past few years, 
you already get the drill. It works much as it did in Windows 7 and is much 
less annoying than it was in Windows Vista.
Configuring User Account Control works as it did in Windows 7, via the User 
Account Control Settings control panel. So there’s no need to waste time on it: 
UAC works as before, isn’t annoying, and shouldn’t be messed with.

427
User Accounts
NO TE ​ ​Okay, there is one interesting side note about UAC in Windows 8: One 
place you’ll never see this prompt is in any of Windows 8’s Metro experiences. 
That’s because UAC is a desktop technology, and the Metro environment has 
its own more pervasive protections built in and designed to protect the OS from 
exactly the kinds of issues that UAC, too, is aimed at.

Microsoft first provided pervasive 
Windows-based parental controls functionality in Windows Vista, providing 
parents with a way to create and enforce settings related to computer usage, 
including a web filter (for allowing and disallowing individual websites and 
downloading), time limits, games, and applications (including which can and 
cannot be used).
In Windows 8, Microsoft is carrying forward the parental control functionality 
from its predecessor, and it works almost exactly the same way, with a few use-
ful improvements. Parental controls, called Family Safety in Windows 8, can 
be applied only to non-administrator accounts—including Microsoft accounts, 
which is indeed new to Windows 8—and is administered one account at a time.
There are two ways to add parental controls to an account. You may recall that 
when you add a new account to the system, it’s silently created as a standard 
user account, and not as an administrator. So as an added nicety, Windows 8 
provides a check box option, shown in Figure 12-11, which lets you enable 
Family Safety right when the account is created.
 
Figure 12-11: You can enable parental controls when you add a new account to the PC.

are not available

Or, you can add parental controls to an account after it has been created. To 
do so, select Manage another account from the main User Accounts control 
panel, select the account you want to manage, and then select Set up Family 
Safety. The Family Safety interface resembles Figure 12-12.
 
Figure 12-12: Family Safety helps you protect your children online and on the PC.
If you’re familiar with the parental controls functionality that was included 
in Windows 7, all of the functionality from that release carries over into 
Windows 8. But there are a few useful additions in this release, too. For 
example, where the Windows 7 parental controls allowed you to specify 
the hours of each day that the child could use the PC—this feature is now 
called “curfew”—Windows 8 adds the ability to limit how many hours they 
can use the PC each day as well. Additionally, Family Safety integrates with 
Windows Store so you can see and control which Metro-style apps and games 
your child downloads, based on country-specific ratings; in the United 
States, we use ESRB (Entertainment Software Ratings Board) ratings.
Enable the Guest account: 
3

While you can go to great lengths to protect stan-
dard user accounts with parental controls, sometimes all you’re looking for is a 
single, temporary user account with standard user privileges that anyone can 
use. As with previous Windows versions, Windows 8 includes such an account, 
called the Guest account, and it’s a safe and easy way to let others use your 

429
User Accounts
PC without worrying that they’re going to view, modify, or delete any crucial 
data, uninstall or change an application, or perform other dangerous tasks.
To enable the Guest account, select Manage another account from the main 
User Accounts control panel. Then, in the Manage Accounts screen, choose 
Guest. (Its icon will note that the Guest account is off.)
The control panel will ask you whether you’re sure you wish to enable this 
account, noting that password-protected files, folders, and settings are not 
accessible to guest users. Click Turn on to enable the Guest account.
Now, when you leave the computer, you can lock your account (easiest way: 
Winkey + L). And then your children or actual guests can browse the web, run 
apps, and perform other common duties using the Guest account while you’re 
away: A new Guest option will appear on the lock screen.
Remember that the Guest account is temporary to each sign-in. So when 
the user signs out of the Guest account, any settings changes or documents 
they’ve created will be deleted. Each time you sign in to the Guest account is 
like the first time that account is used, and nothing is retained.
Reset EAS Policies: 
3
3
When you sign in to a Windows 8 PC or device with a 
Microsoft account, you’re using a technology called Exchange ActiveSync 
(EAS) under the covers to provide push-based access to your Hotmail-based 
e‑mail, calendar, contacts, and other data. EAS is a Microsoft-created corpo-
rate standard that is used by Hotmail and Microsoft’s Exchange- and Office 
365-based services, and also by competing services from Apple, Google, and 
other companies. (In this way, it’s a de facto standard for all modern mobile 
devices.) And one of its big advantages is that it supports the notion of EAS 
policies, which can set restrictions on the device—smartphone, tablet, or PC—
that you use to access the underlying services. For example, your workplace 
may want to ensure that you sign in with an account that has an acceptable 
password (from a length and complexity standpoint) and then auto-locks 
after a certain period of inactivity.
When you sign in with a Microsoft account, whatever restrictions Hotmail 
enforces are automatically applied to your PC. But this is only required if 
you are using Microsoft’s bundled Mail app. If you access Hotmail’s e‑mail, 
calendar, and contacts from a Windows application, or from the web, you can 
decouple Hotmail’s EAS policy requirements from your PC. And, oddly enough, 
you do this from the User Accounts control panel: Just click Reset EAS Policies 
on the left, and you’ll see a window like the one shown in Figure 12-13.

on your PC.
The User Accounts Control Panel 
and Domain Accounts
The User Accounts control panel experience described in this chapter applies 
only to those who sign in with a local or Microsoft account. If you sign in with a 
domain account—or on a PC for which a domain account has been configured—
you’re going to see some different options in the User Accounts control panel.
While many of these options are only of interest to domain administrators, it’s 
worth pointing out one of the common tasks we mentioned earlier is managed 
using this interface: changing an account type. To change an account type, click 
Manage User Accounts. Instead of opening a new view in the User Accounts 
control panel window, you will see the old-school windows in Figure 12-14.
 
Figure 12-14: User Accounts manage­
ment on a domain-based system.

431
Security and Windows 8: Keeping Your PC Safe
Now, select the account you want to change—and if you see two entries for 
one account, as you will for Microsoft accounts, choose the top one—and click 
Properties. Then just choose Standard user or Administrator from that window.
The easing of restrictions will apply until and unless you run the Mail, Calendar, 
People, or Messaging app(s) again. At that time, the EAS policies required by Hot-
mail will be simply be silently reapplied. If you sign in with a corporate account, 
however, it won’t be so silent: You’ll be prompted to accept the policies change.
Security and Windows 8: Keeping Your PC Safe
While Mac partisans and tech pundits like to present a tortured view of how difficult 
it is to secure a Windows PC, the truth is far less dramatic. Previous to Windows 8, 
there were a few simple steps you could take to technically secure your PC—enabling 
automatic updates and installing an antivirus solution—and that, combined with 
some good old-fashioned common sense was all that was required.
In Windows 8, you’ll be ecstatic to know, it’s even easier.
Under the hood, of course, Microsoft’s decades-long commitment to system secu-
rity continues. This version of Windows includes the same anti-malware technology, 
firewall, User Account Control, and other security features that made Windows 7 the 
most secure version of Windows yet. And then they turned it up a notch by adding 
two crucial new features: Antivirus is now included in the OS, finally, so you won’t 
need to add that separately. And the SmartScreen protection feature that the com-
pany debuted in Internet Explorer 9 is now part of Windows, so you’re protected even 
if you use competing browsers.
You’ll still want to employ common sense. But that’s not a focus of this book.
Windows Defender
Microsoft has included an integrated anti-spyware and anti-malware solution called 
Windows Defender since Windows Vista. Defender was good at what it did—in fact, most 
Windows users simply aren’t even aware of its existence, which is proof of its efficiency—
but it’s always been lacking one crucial feature: It didn’t include antivirus functionality. 
So we recommended an external and free utility called Microsoft Security Essentials 
(MSE) for this purpose: MSE looked and worked just like Defender, but it added that one 
crucial feature, completing the Windows security picture.

432
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Now, Windows Defender includes the same antivirus functionality that used to 
be part of Microsoft Security Essentials. It’s built into Windows 8, it’s enabled by 
default, and you get it for free, just for buying into Windows 8.
This is exciting because both of us have used MSE for years, and we trust it to pro-
tect not only our own PCs, but more crucially those of our families and friends. And 
we’ve experienced no major issues yet. Not once.
So our advice is simple. Assuming you’re not spending your time in the nether 
regions of the web, downloading illegal software and goodness knows what else, 
Windows Defender is enough. It’s lightweight and quiet, and it won’t bother you with 
annoying pop-up dialogs. You won’t need other security applications or even more 
expensive security suites. You know, assuming that common sense is employed.
TIP ​ ​Okay, there is one more thing you can continue doing from time to time: 
Use a second anti-malware utility. (You should never use two antivirus solu-
tions, however, because they will interfere with each other.) It’s not necessary 
to leave the second anti-malware utility running in real time, but it’s a good idea 
to run it once in a while, just to make sure something hasn’t slipped by.
But we know you want to know a bit more about Windows Defender.
Shown in Figure 12-15, Windows Defender has a simple interface. From here, you 
can trigger a malware and virus scan, check for updates, view the history of Defender’s 
activities, or access various options. It works just as Defender did in Windows 7, except 
that it’s now checking, in real time, for viruses as well as spyware and other malware.
 
Figure 12-15: Windows Defender

433
Security and Windows 8: Keeping Your PC Safe
There’s not a heck of a lot to do here. Configured properly, Defender’s real-time 
protection against viruses and malware will be enabled, and its virus and malware 
definitions—part of its ability to detect errant software—should be up to date. You 
can manually update the definitions from the Update tab, but it’s unlikely there’s an 
issue here unless the PC has been offline for weeks or longer.
Potentially harmful items that have been found are cataloged on the History tab. 
Here, you’ll see different buckets for quarantined, allowed, and all detected items. 
If there are any items here, you can further remediate them if you’d like—perhaps by 
removing them entirely—but there’s usually no reason to bother.
The Settings tab has, as expected, a number of configuration options and is worth 
looking at. For example, you can configure Defender to scan removable drives during a 
full scan. This is desirable if you regularly use an external disk, like a USB hard drive, 
when you’re home. You can also configure Defender to automatically remove quaran-
tined items after a set time period—by default it does nothing—and determine whether 
to participate in Microsoft’s Active Protection Service, or MAPS, which is used to make 
Defender more effective for everyone. Do your part: We recommend at least a basic 
membership.
Boot-Time Security
Windows Defender, like its predecessor, is great at what it does. But there’s one 
problem with an integrated antivirus and anti-malware solution like Defender, and 
that is that Windows 8 must be running for it to work. There are certain situations 
in which you may wish to secure your PC’s hard disk—just as when it’s booting—or 
need to run a security scan against the hard disk when Windows isn’t running. And 
while one might argue that these capabilities aren’t technically Windows 8 features 
per se, you need to know about them.
First, as PCs have become more sophisticated, the architecture on which Windows 
runs has evolved. And one of the biggest changes that Windows 8 has been designed to 
accommodate is the long overdue switch from the primitive BIOS (basic input/output 
system) environments that have graced (disgraced?) PCs since the 1980s. BIOS is a type 
of firmware, a tiny bit of software that runs before Windows when the PC first powers 
on. And while it’s possible to run Windows 8 on a BIOS-based computer—basically every 
single PC made before 2012—a new generation of more sophisticated PCs and devices 
are instead using BIOS’s replacement. It’s called UEFI, or the Unified Extensible Firm-
ware Interface.
UEFI provides many advantages over BIOS, but from a security perspective the 
big deal is that PCs based on this firmware type can support a new technology called 

434
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Secure Boot. Based on industry standards, Secure Boot ensures that a system hasn’t 
been tampered with while offline. (That is, while Windows isn’t running.)
It sounds Orwellian but the purpose of Secure Boot is valid: It targets a growing 
class of electronic attacks that insert code before Windows boots and try to prevent 
the OS from loading security software like Windows Defender at boot time, leaving  
the system vulnerable to further attack. Secure Boot ensures that only properly 
authorized components are allowed to execute at boot time. It is literally a more 
secure form of booting.
All Windows 8 PCs and devices will be configured from the factory to support 
Secure Boot and have this firmware feature enabled. But if you are going to install 
Windows 8 on a previous PC, you can check to see whether this feature is supported 
and then enable it before installing the OS.
As a feature of the PC firmware, Secure Boot isn’t configured in Windows; it’s con-
figured in the UEFI firmware interface. This interface will vary from PC to PC, but it’s 
generally available via a Boot or Security screen in the firmware and is toggled via an 
option that will be labeled UEFI Boot. This can be set to Enabled or Disabled.
The other security issue that arises at boot time occasionally is the need to scan 
an offline system. That is, you may want to run a Windows Defender security scan 
against a Windows 8 hard disk, but when Windows isn’t running. This can be a vital 
capability if your system is infested with a bootkit or rootkit, malicious forms of soft-
ware that are both hard to detect and almost impossible to remove . . . when Windows 
is running. But if you can attack bootkits and rootkits while Windows is offline, then 
voila! Problem solved.
Fortunately, Microsoft makes a standalone version of Windows Defender called 
the Windows Defender Offline. As you might expect, it is based on Windows Defender, 
and looks almost identical to that tool. But you install it to a bootable optical disc 
or USB memory stick and then boot the PC from that. Windows Defender Offline is 
shown in Figure 12-16.
Strictly speaking, there’s no reason to run Windows Defender Offline unless you 
know you have a problem. But don’t wait to create a bootable Windows Defender Offline 
disc or USB key until you have a problem: This is a tool you should have at the ready, 
just in case. You can download Windows Defender Offline from the Microsoft website  
at tinyurl.com/defenderoffline.

to protect the contents of a Windows PC’s hard drive. These are discussed in 
Chapter 14.

Windows SmartScreen
Microsoft added an interesting and useful security feature to Internet Explorer 9 
called SmartScreen that helps guard your PC against malicious software downloads. 
IE 9’s SmartScreen feature works very well, but of course it can’t help you if you use a 
different browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, or if you download a mali-
cious file through another means, such as an e‑mail application or USB storage device.
To help protect you against malicious software more globally, Windows 8 includes 
a special version of SmartScreen, called Windows SmartScreen, which protects the 
filesystem against malicious files, no matter where they come from. Windows Smart-
Screen works exactly like IE 9’s SmartScreen feature, meaning it utilizes both holis-
tic sensing technologies and an Internet-hosted service to determine whether files 
are malicious or at least suspected of being so.
Configuring Windows SmartScreen
To configure Windows SmartScreen, you’ll need to launch Action Center, which is 
available via the system tray (it’s the icon that resembles a cute little white flag) or 
through Start Search.
SmartScreen 
3

uses a Microsoft 
hosted “reputation” 
service that 
uses actual user 
feedback to 
help determine 
whether files are 
trustworthy. So 
that means you 
can help make 
the service more 
useful for everyone 
simply by using this 
feature.

436
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Using the Action Center route, you’ll see an option on the left of the window 
called Change Windows Start Screen settings. Click this option to display the win-
dow shown in Figure 12-17.
 
Figure 12-17: Windows SmartScreen settings
We recommend using the default setting, which is “Get administrator approval 
before running an unrecognized app from the Internet.” Unless you’re regularly 
hanging out in torrent sites or other gray areas of the Interwebs, you’ll find this isn’t 
too annoying.
Using Windows SmartScreen
When Windows SmartScreen fires up, you’ll know it: The full-screen notification 
shown in Figure 12-18 displays, interrupting whatever you were doing.
 
Figure 12-18: Windows SmartScreen notifications are a bit hard to miss.
As with any full-screen notification, you’ll want to deal with this before proceeding. 
And while SmartScreen can certainly suffer from false positives, our advice is to think 
very carefully before just dismissing this. It’s warning you for a reason.

437
Security and Windows 8: Keeping Your PC Safe
Action Center Improvements
If you’re familiar with Action Center from Windows 7, you know that it’s an improved 
version of the Security Center that dates all the way back to Windows XP with Service 
Pack 2. In Windows 8, Action Center carries forward largely unchanged in that it still 
performs the same function of tracking security and troubleshooting items in the OS 
and popping up notifications when something goes wrong.
What’s changed is that Action Center now tracks far more items than it did in 
Windows 7. And while many of the items it tracks are, as you might expect, related 
to new features in Windows 8, some aren’t. It’s just fleshed out better.
In Windows 8, Action Center now tracks these additional items:
Windows SmartScreen: 
3
3
This security feature, described earlier, debuted  
in Windows 8 and provides anti-malware protection directly through the  
Windows filesystem.
Windows activation: 
3
3
While activation is hardly new to Windows 8, Microsoft 
has created an Action Center experience in this release that tracks whether 
your copy of Windows is activated, and thus valid. You can see this interface 
in Figure 12-19.
 
Figure 12-19: Windows is activated
Microsoft account: 
3
3
The ability to sign in to Windows 8 with a Microsoft 
account is obviously new to this version of the OS, but the underlying technol-
ogy that Action Center is actually tracking here is whether your account is 
working properly and syncing settings from the PC to SkyDrive (and thus to 
other PCs) and vice versa.

438
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Automatic maintenance: 
3
3
Like previous Windows versions, Windows 8 will 
automatically run a scheduled maintenance routine at a set time, 3:00 a.m. 
What’s changed in Windows 8 is that this activity is now tracked by Action 
Center to ensure that it completes successfully. But you can use the Start 
maintenance link to run a manual check or Change maintenance settings  
to configure a new time.
HomeGroup: 
3
3
Action Center now checks to see whether you’re part of a home-
group. This is important because signing in with a Microsoft account breaks 
the normal workgroup-style home network sharing we used to use.
C ROSSREF  ​We examine networking issues in Chapter 13.
File History: 
3
3
The new File History feature works with the Push Button Reset 
functionality in Windows 8 to create a more flexible way of restoring lost data 
than the old method, a combination of Previous Files (which no one even 
knew existed) and Windows Backup (which was ponderous and slow).
Drive status: 
3
3
Action Center now checks to see whether all of the fixed disks 
attached to your computer are working properly.
When Action Center detects an issue, it provides notifications via its system tray 
icon. Clicking these, or the associated warnings that appear in the Action Center con-
trol panel, brings you to the user interface you need to mitigate the issue. For example, 
as part of its overall system performance and reliability tracking, Action Center could 
eventually warn you to disable app[lication]s to help improve performance. This slightly 
off-base recommendation—it really means, “disable startup applications to improve 
boot-time performance” and has nothing to do with Metro-style apps—links to the 
Task Manager. In Windows 8, the Task Manager now provides a Startup tab that lets you 
enable and disable applications (but not Metro-style apps) that are configured to run at 
boot time. This can be seen in Figure 12-20.
But Wait, There’s More
In addition to the features discussed previously, Microsoft has improved a number 
of security features that debuted in previous Windows versions, too. Most of the 
features don’t require any user interaction. They simply work in the background, 
ensuring that Windows 8 is as secure as it can be.

439
Security and Windows 8: Keeping Your PC Safe
 
Figure 12-20: Task Manager now helps you disable boot-time applications.
A small sampling includes the following:
Credential Manager: 
3
3
Windows has long included a Credential Manager inter-
face—previously called Windows Vault—that helps you combine the usernames 
and passwords for the local network and for websites with your Windows user 
account. New to this release is that you can now tie these other sign-ins with 
your Microsoft account for the first time, since most people will be signing in to 
Windows 8 with that account type.
Windows kernel: 
3
3
The innermost part of Windows has been shored up with 
protection technologies that were curiously available only to other Windows 
components in previous OS versions.
ASLR: 
3
3
Since Windows Vista, Windows has employed a technique called 
address space layout randomization (ASLR) to randomly load code and data 
into different memory addresses at run time, cutting down on an entire class 
of memory-based attacks. In Windows 8, ASLR has been improved with even 
more randomness. And it’s been extended to even more Windows components.

440
C h a p t e r  1 2    Accounts and Security
Memory: 
3
3
Modern Windows versions have of course always included various 
forms of protection against memory-based attacks, and the move to isolated 
Metro-style apps will help in this and other regards. But Windows 8 also 
includes new protections against “use after free” vulnerabilities, where rogue 
or malicious applications are able to examine and exploit freed up memory 
that still includes valuable data or other code.
There’s still more, but you get the idea. While many Windows 8 security features 
are in your face when required, some simply work behind the scenes, tirelessly keeping 
you safe without you doing a thing. What’s missing is the “security theater” that used 
to dog older Windows versions, where the security features were purposefully made to 
be overly chatty and interruptive, providing you with a sense that something good was 
happening.
Summary
With Windows 8, Microsoft offers the first major change to user accounts since, well, it 
added user accounts to Windows. Now, home users can get the same kind of settings-
roaming functionality that was previously available only in expensive and complex 
corporate environments, tied to the online ID—the Microsoft account—we all already 
use. Of course, those using traditional workgroup-type local accounts or domain 
accounts won’t be left behind either, and you can mix all three account types on the 
same PC if desired.
From a security perspective, Microsoft has finally closed the loop and silenced 
the critics by adding an excellent and effective antivirus solution to the OS. That, 
combined with new boot-time security protections, new security features like 
Windows SmartScreen, a host of new Action Center-based reliability and security 
tracking functionality, and, of course, all the excellent security features from 
Windows 7, makes Windows 8 the most secure Windows yet.
But then you expected nothing less, right?

After making major improvements to its networking  
infrastructure in Windows XP with Service Pack 2 a decade ago, Microsoft has been 
evolving this technology in subsequent Windows versions. In Windows 8, you see the 
most refined version of this technology yet, with new Metro-based interfaces for con-
necting to wired and Wi-Fi wireless networks. Windows 8 also includes a Metro-based 
front end to the HomeGroup network sharing scheme, which takes on all new impor-
tance in this release thanks to Windows 8’s Microsoft account sign-in capabilities.
More revolutionary, however, is Windows 8’s support for the cellular data networks 
that are becoming more and more ubiquitous thanks to the rise of smartphones, tablets, 
and other modern computing devices. Windows 8 treats this network type specially, with 
an understanding of their metered nature that will help users avoid overage charges and 
automatically switch to more efficient—and less costly—networks when available.13

442
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
What Was Old Is New Again
All of the networking functionality you’re familiar with from Windows 7 is present in 
Windows 8, though some of these interfaces have been updated to accommodate the 
new Metro environment that sits at the core of this new OS. Features that carry forward 
to Windows 8 include the following:
HomeGroup sharing: 
3
3
In addition to older, traditional network-based resource 
sharing techniques from previous versions of Windows, Windows 7 added a 
simple new scheme called HomeGroup sharing. This makes it easy to share 
digital media content, documents, and printers on a home network. Because 
of the move to Microsoft account-based sign-ins in Windows 8, HomeGroup 
sharing is more important than ever in this release, so we explore this topic  
in more detail later in the chapter.
Network and Sharing Center: 
3
3
This complex interface provides a single place 
to go to view, configure, and troubleshoot networking issues, and access new 
and improved tools. It’s still there, virtually unchanged in Windows 8.  
If you’re lucky, you will never need to use it.
If you’re unlucky, you can access Network and Sharing Center via Start Search. 
Or, right-click the Network notification icon in the Notification Area and choose 
Network and Sharing Center from the pop-up menu that appears.
The Network and Sharing interface also includes a feature called Network Map 
that visually shows how your PC is connected to the Internet and other devices, 
an issue that is particularly important to understand when troubleshooting.
Seamless network connections: 
3
3
In Windows XP, unconnected wired and 
wireless network connections would leave ugly red icons in your system tray, 
and creating new connections was confusing and painful. Now Windows con-
nects to secure networks automatically. Windows will also automatically dis-
able networking hardware that isn’t in use, a boon for mobile computer users 
on-the-go who want to preserve battery life.
The interface for managing wireless networks is now a Metro experience. 
Since it’s new, we’ll discuss that in the next section.
Network explorer: 
3
3
The old My Network Places explorer from previous versions 
of Windows has been replaced and upgraded significantly with the new Network 
explorer. This handy interface supports access to all of the computers, devices, 
and printers found on your connected networks, instead of just showing net-
work shares, as XP did. You can even access network-connected media players, 
video game consoles, and other connected device types from this interface.

443
Connecting to and Managing Wired and Wireless Networks
Network locations: 
3
3
Windows 7 featured a Set Network Location wizard that 
would appear whenever you connected to a new wired or wireless network 
for the first time. This wizard let you set multiple complex network charac-
teristics under the hood by providing a simple list of choices for the type 
of network you were connecting to: Home, Work, or Public. Home and Work 
were essentially the same, in that both opened up sharing between your PC 
and other PCs and devices on the network. Public, meanwhile, was for public 
network connection, like the Wi-Fi connections you might run into at cafés, 
airports, and similar locations.
In Windows 8, network location is handled differently and, believe it or not, 
it’s even easier than before. Now, there are only two states, and instead of forc-
ing the user to think about the network type, you choose between whether you 
want to share or connect to devices. We explain this functionality and how to 
configure it on a per-connection basis in the next section.
Connecting to and Managing Wired 
and Wireless Networks
With the move to a Metro-based infrastructure in Windows 8, many core system 
tasks now occur within that interface rather than in the classic desktop environ-
ment. So while many of the advanced networking features from Windows 7 are  
still present, largely unchanged, in Windows 8, the most frequently-needed fea-
tures for connecting to and managing networks—both wired and wireless  
(Wi-Fi/802.11-style)—have changed.
Using Wired Networks
A wired Ethernet network is the simplest type of network to connect to, from the per-
spective of Windows at least. That’s because Microsoft is making a big—and usually 
correct—assumption with this type of connection. And that’s that anyone who signs 
in to Windows using a local or Microsoft account and then connects a network cable 
to the PC is doing so on their own home network. And that network, by definition, is 
trusted, a private network type, and one in which being able to share with other PCs 
and connect to devices is not only safe, but desirable.
Connecting to a wired network is as easy as plugging an Ethernet cable into your 
home router on one end and the appropriate port on your PC on the other. When you 

444
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
do, a few things happen. Under the hood, Windows establishes the connection and 
enables sharing and device connections. Then the Network icon in the Notification 
Area (of the Windows desktop) changes to indicate that you’re connected, similar to 
the way it did in Windows 7.
If you click this Network icon, a new Metro-style interface, the Networks pane, 
will appear. This interface, shown in Figure 13-1, will help you manage not only wired 
networks, but also wireless (Wi-Fi) and cellular data networks.
 
Figure 13-1: The new Metro-style Networks pane helps you manage networks of all kinds.
NO TE ​ ​The Networks pane is important enough that you may need or want to 
access it from the Start screen or a Metro-style app. To do so, you must first 
enable the Settings bar (Winkey + I being the easiest way) and then select the 
Network icon at the bottom of that pane.
There isn’t a lot of configuring you can do with a wired network from this inter-
face, but there is one bit of functionality: You can disable (or enable) PC sharing and 
device connections. To do that, right-click the wired connection in the Networks 
pane and choose Turn sharing on or off from the little pop-up menu that appears. This 
won’t be hard since that’s the only choice, as you can see in Figure 13-2.
In the resulting display, you’ll be confronted with a question, part of Microsoft’s 
never-ending attempts to turn something technical into child’s play: Do you want to 
turn on sharing between PCs and connect to devices on this network?

445
Connecting to and Managing Wired and Wireless Networks
 
Figure 13-2: If you’re looking for lots of options, look  
elsewhere; this is all you get for a wired network.
There are two possible answers:
No, don’t turn on sharing or connect to devices. For networks in public places.
3
3
Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices. For home or work networks.
3
3
In case it’s not obvious, the first choice—for public places—maps to the old 
Public network location type from Windows 7. And the second choice, for home or 
work networks, maps to the Home and Work network location types, respectively.
Using Wi-Fi Networks
Wireless networks, of course, require a bit more finesse. Unlike wired networks, 
they’re not assumed to be safe, since you could be connecting to the Internet from 
a café, airport, or other location where electronic predators are lurking, waiting to 
steal your valuable personal information directly from the airwaves. Furthermore, 
not all wireless networks were created equal: There are wide-open, unprotected wire-
less networks and protected networks that offer various levels of security. But even 
the various types of networks aren’t completely safe, so it’s best to err on the side of 
safety, which is exactly what Windows 8 does.
To connect to a wireless network, you display the Networks pane. As described 
previously, you can do so by clicking the Network icon in the Notification Area or 
by typing Winkey + I and then clicking the Network icon in the Settings pane that 
appears. As you can see in Figure 13-3, when you’re within in range of one or more 
wireless networks, those networks will appear listed in the Networks pane under 
the heading Wi-Fi.
You will see two types of wireless networks here: unprotected and protected. An 
unprotected network is noted with a small exclamation point emblem to indicate that 
it could be unsafe. And as shown in Figure 13-4, when you select this type of warn-
ing, Windows provides a final warning before you connect.

446

Figure 13-3: Available wireless networks are displayed in the  
Networks pane.
 
Figure 13-4: Windows 8 warns before letting you connect to an unprotected wireless network.
Regardless of the protected status of the network, you’ll see two other choices when 
you select a wireless network in the Networks pane: Connect and Connect automatically. 
If you check the latter option before connecting, Windows 8 will automatically connect 
to this network whenever it’s within range. (If there are two or more such networks, 
Windows 8 will intelligently select the one with the best connectivity.)

447
Connecting to and Managing Wired and Wireless Networks
Once you click Connect, one of two things can happen.
For a password protected network, you’ll be prompted to enter the password, as 
shown in Figure 13-5, and then Click Enter.
 
Figure 13-5: You need to enter a password for a protected network.
If you are accessing an open, unprotected network, the Networks pane will ask 
you whether you want to turn on sharing between PCs and connect to devices on this 
network. (For protected networks, this is the next step.) As with any other network 
type, there are two possible answers:
No, don’t turn on sharing or connect to devices. For networks in public places.
3
3
Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices. For home or work networks.
3
3
Choose accordingly, and you’ll be connected to the network. In the Networks pane, 
the connection will be accompanied by a Connected notation.
Wireless networks provide many more configuration options than do wired net-
works. If you right-click a wireless network to which you’re connected, you’ll see 
a number of options, though it should be noted that not all of them are relevant to 
Wi-Fi networks. (Some are more applicable to cellular data connections, as described 
in the next section.) These options include:
Show/Hide estimated data usage: 
3
3
This option is actually a toggle. When it’s 
enabled, you’ll see a data usage estimate whenever you select the connection, 
as shown in Figure 13-6.
Using this information to keep track of usage is, of course, valuable for cel-
lular data connections, which are always metered. You can click the Reset link 
in the Networks pane to reset the data usage estimate to 0.
Mouse over a

and Windows will 
provide information 
about the type of 
the network (for 
example, 802.11g or 
similar for wireless 
networks) and the 
type of security it  
uses, if any.

If you’ve configured Windows 8 to remember 
a wireless network and thus reconnect to it automatically, you can change that 
behavior using this option (and vice versa).

interface lets you configure advanced settings for obscure, non-typical wire-
less networks and isn’t generally needed.
Connecting to Cellular Data Networks
Over the years, the support in Windows for different network types and networking 
technologies has of course evolved. And in Windows 8, finally, Microsoft is explicitly 
supporting the 3G and 4G/LTE cellular data networks that are now becoming ubiquitous.

449
Connecting to Cellular Data Networks
 
Figure 13-7: Back to the Stone Age
Understanding Cellular Data Networks
3G refers to the third-generation cellular data networks that are now consid-
ered the baseline—that is, the slowest—for such networks.
4G, confusingly, refers broadly to a range of cellular network types, includ-
ing pseudo-4G data networks such as HSPA (high-speed packet access) and 
HSPA+ that are really based on the older 3G standard.
LTE, or long-term evolution, is, for now at least, the “true” standard for 4G cellu-
lar data connectivity and offers the best performance of these network types.
Prior to this release, you could connect to such networks using third-party soft-
ware, which was generally acquired from the wireless carrier or device maker that 
provided the connectivity, perhaps through a USB-based add-on peripheral or inter-
nal SIM card interface in a laptop or other device.

450
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
NO TE ​ ​A SIM (subscriber identity module) card is a small integrated circuit on 
a plastic card that is used to authenticate your device, and thus you, the wire-
less subscriber, to the cellular data network. These cards are used in smart-
phones, tablets, and modern PCs, and while they come in various sizes, they 
are functionally identical.
But now, in Windows 8, this capability is just built-in. And that integration into 
the OS isn’t just a convenience. In addition to providing the functionality that used to 
require third-party software installation, the built-in cellular data connectivity that’s 
available in Windows 8 is also more intelligent. It will use your Wi-Fi or other network 
connectivity whenever possible, switching off of cellular as frequently as possible in 
order to save you money. That’s because cellular data is notoriously expensive and 
almost always metered, with a set monthly or per-use allotment of data.
Put simply, Windows 8 treats cellular data just like your smartphone does, neatly 
bridging the connectivity gap between those small and highly portable devices and 
the monolithic PCs of the past.
Choosing a Cellular Data Connection
To use a cellular data connection with the integrated Windows 8 capabilities, or what 
Microsoft calls mobile broadband, you must have a Windows PC or device that includes 
a built-in SIM port. If you don’t have such a thing, you utilize external methods for 
connecting to the Internet via a cellular data connection. Some of the more obvious 
choices include the following:
Portable wireless router: 
3
3
Many wireless carriers sell tiny wireless routers that 
access their data networks and then broadcast a Wi-Fi network that you can use 
with multiple devices and PCs. From the perspective of Windows 8, connecting 
to such a device is no different from connecting to any Wi-Fi wireless network. 
A typical device, such as the Novatel MiFi, is resold by a number of wireless  
carriers and shown in Figure 13-8
Smartphone or tablet Internet sharing: 
3
3
Smartphones and tablets are gener-
ally available with built-in SIM cards and cellular data connectivity of their 
own, and some can share that connection over Wi-Fi with other devices and 
PCs, much like a wireless router. This process is sometimes called Internet 
tethering, because sharing a smartphone’s Internet connection in particular 
can lead to a quick loss of battery life. So it’s advisable to connect, or tether, 
the phone to your PC via a USB cable to keep it charged. Windows 8 interacts 
with these networks as it does with any Wi-Fi type wireless network.

451
Connecting to Cellular Data Networks
 
Figure 13-8: A portable wireless router  
can connect multiple PCs and devices to  
a cellular data network.
USB dongle: 
3
3
Many wireless carriers also provide small USB devices that plug 
into a PC (or Windows-based device with a USB port), providing cellular connec-
tivity directly to that PC. These devices typically come with their own software 
stack, so that they work with all modern versions of Windows, and if you use 
such a device, it’s likely that you’ll need to install this software before you can 
get online. In such cases, usage will vary, since the provided utilities will vary 
from device to device. A typical cellular data dongle is shown in Figure 13-9.
 
Figure 13-9: You can add 
cellular data connectivity to 
any PC using an external  
USB dongle.
If you’ve purchased a modern Windows 8 PC or device, especially a portable 
computer such as a laptop, Ultrabook, tablet, or hybrid PC, chances are good that it 
came with at least a SIM module, which would allow you to later add a SIM card and 
associated data plan from your wireless carrier of choice and use that connectivity 
to access the Internet on the go.
The placement and accessibility of this SIM port will vary from machine to machine. 
They’re generally well-hidden, hard to access, and only need to be fiddled with once (if 
at all): when you install the SIM card the first time.
Availability and cost of cellular data will also vary by wireless carrier, so you’ll want 
to consider your needs—that is, whether you’ll typically use the connectivity from 
the same basic location (home, work, the local coffee shop) or while traveling. That’s 
because cellular data coverage varies from place to place, and while certain carriers offer 
great coverage in one area, they may offer terrible coverage elsewhere, if at all.

452
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
You’ll also need to consider your data needs, planning, and shopping accordingly. 
Some wireless carriers offer pay-as-you-go plans, while others require you to sign up 
for 2 years and pay a standard monthly fee for a set amount of data (with additional 
payments made for overages). We happen to use AT&T Wireless in the United States at 
the time of this writing, and this company offers the following pay-as-you-go data 
plans for Windows-based PCs and tablets with a built-in LTE-based SIM card.
Prepaid plans with an auto-renew option and anytime termination:
250 MB monthly pass $15
3 GB monthly pass $30
5 GB monthly pass $50
These plans expire when you have used all the data in your plan or your time 
expires, whichever occurs first. Any “leftover” never carries forward to the next 
time period, sorry. But AT&T also happens to offer international data add-ons 
for world travelers, another option to consider. However, this is just an example; 
you’ll want to shop around.
Determining how much data you need can be difficult. Fortunately, with a pay-
as-you-go plan, you can adjust over time until you settle on the plan that makes the 
most sense for you.
Setting Up a Cellular Data Connection
To set up a cellular data connection in  
Windows 8, you use the same Networks pane 
that is used for wired and wireless (Wi-Fi) con-
nections. This is accessed from Settings (Win-
key + I), Network, or by clicking the Network 
icon in the Notification Area in the desktop 
environment. Either way, you’ll see a Mobile 
broadband area in the Networks pane, as shown 
in Figure 13-10, with an entry representing 
your cellular data connection.
When you select the cellular data connec-
tion, the Networks display expands to show 
additional options. As you can see in  
Figure 13-11, these include View my account,  
Connect automatically, and Roam automatically.
Figure 13-10: Cellular data connec-
tions receive their own special area in 
the Networks pane.
V413HAV

453
Connecting to Cellular Data Networks
We’ll look at these options in a moment. For 
now, the goal is to get this connection set up. So 
click Connect to continue.
After a bit of configuration, you’ll be con-
nected to the wireless carrier’s custom Metro-
style experience where you can create a (or 
connect to an existing) account, determine which 
data plan you would like to use, and so on. This 
experience will vary by wireless carrier, but in 
Figure 13-12, you can see an AT&T account portal 
for a pay-as-you-go data plan.
Meanwhile, back in the Networks pane, the  
cellular data connection will note that it’s connected.  
You will need to disconnect from that network to configure the two other options noted 
previously. These include the following:
Connect automatically: 
3
3
If selected, your cellular data connection will 
attempt to connect anytime you are otherwise not connected to the Internet 
via a wired or Wi-Fi connection. Most users with 2 GB of more of monthly data 
allowance are probably safe with this option enabled, though you’ll want to 
monitor it and ensure that it’s configured as a metered connection; both of 
these options are discussed in the next section.
Roam automatically: 
3
3
If selected, your cellular data connection will attempt 
to connect anytime you are otherwise not connected to the Internet, even if 
you’re outside of your own wireless carrier’s network. This is not recommended 
unless your carrier explicitly allows this and doesn’t charge extra for the privi-
lege; such connections often come with additional charges. Check with your 
wireless carrier to be sure.

Further Configuring a Cellular Data Connection
As with a wireless (Wi-Fi) connection, you can right-click (or tap on and hold) a cellular 
data connection to view additional options. These include the following:
Show/Hide estimated data usage: 
3
3
This option is actually a toggle. When it’s 
enabled, you’ll see a data usage estimate whenever you select the connection.
Set as metered/non-metered connection: 
3
3
This option is enabled by default 
for cellular data connections, meaning that Windows 8 correctly treats such 
networks as metered. A metered connection is one that is limited to a certain 
amount of bandwidth for a certain period of time, typically a month. Most 
wireless carriers offer tiers of service, with monthly allotments of 250 MB, 
2 GB, 5 GB, and so on. So most users will want to ensure that their device isn’t 
sopping up the available bandwidth each month. And this is where Windows 8 
provides some interesting functionality.
When you’re connected to the Internet with just a metered connection, 
Windows 8 changes its behavior to be less data hungry. For example,  
Windows Update will not automatically download updates in the back-
ground, even if you have Auto Updates enabled (as you should). There’s  
no exception to this: If Microsoft feels that a security update is particu-
larly important, it will enable the downloading of that fix regardless of  
the connection type.
And just in case it’s not clear why this ability to configure a connection as 
metered is important, consider this example: In the writing of this book, 
your authors of course spent a lot of time testing things—a process that 
involves reinstalling Windows 8 again and again and reconfiguring the OS 
from scratch to ensure that the behaviors we see and describe aren’t col-
ored by other user or application configurations. While doing that for this 
chapter, the process of updating the OS and the bundled Metro-style apps 
(through Windows Store) consumed an entire 250 MB monthly cellular allot-
ment in about half an hour. The ability to configure a metered connection 
isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.
Forget/Remember this network: 
3
3
Cellular data networks are configured to be 
remembered by default. If you’d like to forget the network for some reason, 
you can do so.
View connection properties: 
3
3
Choosing this option displays an old-school 
desktop-type configuration window, as it does for wireless networks. 
We’re not sure 
3
3
why this isn’t 
enabled by default 
for a cellular data 
connection, since 
it is such useful 
information. Our 
advice is to enable 
it and, especially 
on connections 
with a limited data 
allowance, keep an 
eye on usage.

455
Connecting to Cellular Data Networks
However, there is one useful option in this window when used with a cellular 
data connection: You can enable a PIN for the PC or device’s SIM card to help 
protect against theft.
Comparing this list to that of a wireless network, you may have noticed that the 
Turn sharing on or off option is unavailable. This makes sense since a cellular data 
connection, by definition, cannot connect you to your local network. It is instead 
used to connect to the Internet directly and thus will always be public.
Using Airplane Mode
Like a smartphone, Windows 8 actually supports a useful Airplane Mode toggle that 
instantly disables all of the wireless (Wi-Fi and cellular data) connections in your 
PC or device without requiring you to fumble with multiple interfaces, as you did in 
previous Windows versions.
You access Airplane Mode from two different locations. The easiest is the Networks 
pane (Winkey + I, Network). As you can see in Figure 13-13, it’s the toggle right at the 
top of the pane. So if you’re on an airplane, literally, or wish to otherwise disengage 
the various antennas in the device to preserve battery life, this is your go-to toggle.
 
Figure 13-13: Airplane mode is available from Networks.
You can also access Airplane Mode from PC Settings under the Wireless entry. As 
shown in Figure 13-14, this interface lets you toggle Airplane Mode as you would from 
the Networks pane, but you can also individually toggle the availability of specific 
wireless (Wi-Fi plus cellular data) connections.
This is dramatically simpler than with previous Windows versions. Before, you 
had to find the Network Connections explorer and then manually disable each device 
individually.

Sharing Files, Media, and Printers 
at Home with HomeGroup
Prior to Windows 7, most home users with two or more PCs would employ a simple 
strategy to easily share files over their home networks: They would simply configure 
each PC with at least one user account with the same username and password. This 
way, they wouldn’t need to enter a username and password combination each time 
they accessed a shared folder on the other PC.
This type of workgroup networking scheme worked well enough but it also 
required users to understand how to actually share folders, too—a process that was 
fairly arcane even after the addition of a Simple Sharing functionality in Windows 
XP Home Edition. So with Windows 7, Microsoft finally moved to formalize a simpler 
method for sharing resources on a home network, which included not only files, but 
also printers and digital media (for streaming purposes via Windows Media Player 
and Media Center). Dubbed HomeGroup, it was one of the nice, consumer-oriented 
innovations in Windows 7, though we suspect it was underutilized in that release.
HomeGroup sharing didn’t replace the old-school workgroup-style sharing tech-
nique, and that’s still true in Windows 8. This means you’re free to share as you’d like. 
But in Windows 8, HomeGroup sharing is more desirable than ever, thanks to the 

457
Sharing Files, Media, and Printers at Home with HomeGroup
addition of Microsoft account sign-ins, as you’ll soon discover. But first, let’s review 
what HomeGroup sharing is all about.
NO TE ​ ​Microsoft’s use of the word HomeGroup may seem inconsistent because 
the word appears variously as HomeGroup, Homegroup, and homegroup through-
out the Windows user interface. However, Microsoft tells us this is all by design. 
The word HomeGroup is a trademarked term and refers to the sharing feature 
itself. A homegroup, meanwhile, is the generic “thing” that is created by the fea-
ture. And if you see it spelled as Homegroup (with a capital H but a small g, that’s 
just because it’s a title or other place in the UI where an initial capitalization is 
required. Seriously, they told us this. And yes, they really believe it.
HomeGroup sharing works much as it does in Windows 7, though as part of a wider 
effort to streamline, well, virtually everything in Windows 8, it’s no longer an option 
during Windows Setup. So you’ll need to create—or join—a homegroup after you’re 
done installing Windows 8.
HomeGroup allows you to easily share three items that, prior to Windows 7, required 
three different interfaces. They are as follows:
Libraries: 
3
3
Previously, you could create individual folder shares to share docu-
ments and other files, but now you can share these through your various librar-
ies—Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos—and individually determine 
which ones are shared. This is more powerful than sharing individual folders 
for many reasons, but one obvious reason is that since libraries by definition 
aggregate multiple physical locations in the filesystem, what you’re really shar-
ing are discrete groups of files (or documents) rather than individual folders.
Printers and devices: 
3
3
When you configure a printer or other attached device 
for one PC, it can be made automatically available to all the other home PCs 
that join the homegroup.
Media devices:
3
3
 You can provide access to your media collection for purposes of 
media streaming to compatible devices such as an Xbox 360 or other Windows 8 
PCs using software such as Windows Media Player. As with library-based shar-
ing, this makes far more sense than being forced to remotely browse folders of 
content on your PC from a device. Instead, you can simply connect to a media 
library and browse the actual content.
In addition to not being part of the Windows 8 Setup process, the interface you 
use to configure a homegroup is now a Metro-style experience that can be found in PC 
Settings. To access this interface, navigate to Settings (Winkey + I) and select More 

458
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
PC settings at the bottom of the Settings pane. This will load the full-screen PC Set-
tings interface. When you select HomeGroup from the list of options on the left, you’ll 
see a screen like that in Figure 13-15.
 
Figure 13-15: It’s time to join the homegroup.
Enter the homegroup password and click Join. Once the PC is connected to  
the homegroup, you’ll be able to choose which items to share, including individual 
libraries—Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos—as well as printers and devices, 
and media devices.
When you’re done, you can exit PC Settings.
You can access the shared resources of other PCs on your homegroup using new 
Metro-style apps that support this feature. Your homegroup is also available via the 
standard Metro-style file picker, which can of course be integrated into any app. 
As you can see in Figure 13-16, the file picker displays each of the machines in your 
homegroup, letting you dive into the shared libraries on each and find what you’re 
looking for.
Homegroups are also available from the Windows desktop, of course. When  
you open an Explorer window, you’ll see a Homegroup node in the navigation 
pane, and you can easily browse through the shared items on your home network-
connected PCs. This works as it did in Windows 7, as you might expect, where files 
and other resources exposed through the homegroup are available to any desktop-
type application, too. For example, applications can open and save files to home-
group locations.

459
Sharing Files, Media, and Printers at Home with HomeGroup
 
Figure 13-16: Your homegroup is accessible by any Metro-style app, including  
via the standard file picker.
Put simply, HomeGroup works much as it did in Windows 7, aside from the new 
Metro-style configuration interface. But there is one more wrinkle.
As you know, Windows 8 provides a new sign-in model where you use a Microsoft 
account (previously called a Windows Live ID) instead of a traditional local account to 
sign in to the PC. This new sign-in type provides many advantages related to PC-to-PC 
sync settings and more, and as a result we recommend eschewing old-fashioned local 
accounts in favor of this new sign-in type. But using a Microsoft account also comes 
with a few challenges. And key among them is home network interoperability. If you 
need to access shared resources on other PCs on your home network, whether they’re 
using Windows 8, Windows 7, or whatever Windows version, you could experience 
some difficulty.
That is, if you use the standard Network explorer to access shares on your other 
PCs, you’re going to be seeing the dialog in Figure 13-17 all too often. And that’s 
because you’re now signing in with a Microsoft account. If the other PC isn’t also 
signed in with the same account, you won’t be automatically authenticated to access 
that shared resource.

460
C h a p t e r  1 3    Networking and Connectivity
 
Figure 13-17: Not-so-seamless network connectivity
You could of course enter a correct username and password combination, and 
chances are you know what these entries are since it’s your home network. And 
Windows 8 even fixes a long-standing bug in Windows networking so that when you 
select the option “Remember my credentials,” it actually—get this—remembers your 
credentials.
So that works. But you could also simply choose to use HomeGroup sharing 
instead of the Network explorer. (That is, you will access shared resources via the 
homegroup and not through the Network interface.) This method requires that all of 
your home machines are running Windows 7, Windows 8 (or, interestingly, Windows 
Home Server 2011). So if you are using an older Windows version (Vista, XP) on your 
home network, this method won’t work.
Long story short, you should use your homegroup for all home network-based 
sharing activities when possible: It’s simpler, more powerful, and it’s automatic. But 
if you are still using older Windows PCs on your network, Network explorer will make 
their shared resources available to you as well … as long you know the credentials.
Summary
Windows 8 offers all of the power and flexibility of the networking and connectivity 
services offered in its predecessor, but improves on matters enormously with new 
Metro-style interfaces that work across the OS, and features new capabilities that 
make this version of Windows the best yet from a connectivity standpoint.

461
Summary
Key among these new capabilities is the native support for cellular data con-
nections, which achieves first-class status in Windows 8 alongside wired and 
wireless (Wi-Fi) networking types. If anything, cellular data support is superior 
to those older types of networking, thanks to intelligent integration with your 
wireless carrier’s metered and costly data plans. It’s even more powerful than the 
cellular support in most smartphones.
Windows 8 also expands on the HomeGroup sharing functionality from Windows 7, 
by adding a new Metro-style interface. And HomeGroup-style sharing is more impor-
tant than ever because of the prevalence of Microsoft account sign-ins, which makes 
old-school sharing schemes a bit more difficult. But if you do need to access the net-
work resources of a PC running an older Windows PC, too, the hidden Windows Creden-
tials feature will make that happen.

Let there be no doubt: Windows 8 is quite definitely a  
consumer-focused release of Windows, the first since perhaps Windows Me to cater almost 
exclusively to that part of the market. This is understandable, given the rapid rise of 
competing consumer technologies from companies like Apple and the rapid adoption of 
those technologies, even in businesses. This trend, called the consumerization of IT, has 
revolutionized many aspects of technology used in business, including areas that were 
once sacrosanct. And it’s led to a loosening of the reigns, so to speak, as the workforce 
has evolved to engage in computing activities away from the office.
Microsoft has embraced this trend with its client and server products and cloud  
services, and while Windows 8 may seem a bit light on the business technology side, this 
needs to be viewed in perspective. First, as a superset of Windows 7, Windows 8 does 

464
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
include all of  the business-oriented features and functionality that graced that 
product, often in upgraded or enhanced form. That means that it shares the same 
basic deployment tools, manageability, and other back-end technologies, as well as 
its general feature set.
But Windows 8 also includes some new business-oriented technologies of its own. 
And while consumers are having fun with the Metro-style experiences that dominate 
this product, what you’re about to discover is this version of Windows also offers a 
compelling upgrade case for businesses, too.
C ROSSREF  ​Windows 8 isn’t just about Metro. There are numerous updates 
to the desktop environment, which we discuss in Chapter 4, plus a new desk-
top version of Internet Explorer, amazing new file and system recovery tools 
(Chapter 11) and network and connectivity capabilities (Chapter 13). Metro is 
fun, and beautiful to look at. But Windows 8 is a productivity champion, too.  
It’s in the product’s DNA.
NO TE ​ ​Most of the features described in this chapter require Windows 8 Pro, 
the business- and enthusiast-focused version of Microsoft’s latest operat-
ing system. Some require Windows 8 Enterprise, which is only available via 
Microsoft’s volume licensing program, Software Assurance. Those features 
that also work with the base version of Windows 8 will be noted as such.
Domain Join and Group Policy
When you think about it, traditional home-based Windows PCs are unmanaged in the 
sense that there’s no central oversight available, either by the head of a household 
or a central server. This type of computing, which has been formally described as 
workgroup computing makes a certain amount of sense at home, where each PC is an 
island of functionality onto itself. In the workplace, however, especially at mid-sized 
businesses and enterprises where there can be hundreds or thousands of PCs, the go-
your-own route doesn’t actually make any sense. Corporations need a central way to 
manage users, PCs, devices, and other entities, and ways to secure and update their 
computing products. They need what’s called a managed solution.
The most popular managed solution for businesses is called Active Directory, or 
AD. It requires a centralized Windows Server infrastructure and uses Group Policy to 

465
Domain Join and Group Policy
establish rules for its computing services. While AD and Group Policy haven’t made 
a lot of headway with smaller businesses—though that could change with the adop-
tion of these services in cloud-based solutions like Windows Azure, Office 365, and 
Windows Intune—it’s the standard at larger businesses. And chances are, if you’re 
provided with a PC at work, you’ll be required to sign in to your AD domain, not just 
to the PC using a local account or Microsoft account. Domain joined computers are 
controlled via policy, so they can be very restrictive, especially for such things as 
application installation and certain system customizations. But they’re also typi-
cally better locked down from a security standpoint and, when configured properly, 
allow you to access your company’s secure network resources, even while working 
remotely.
Domain join works in Windows 8 as it did in previous Windows versions. If your 
Windows 8 PC hasn’t been pre-configured with your user account, you can sign in to 
the domain in two ways: from the lock screen or through the Advanced System Prop-
erties control panel.
To sign in to your domain from the lock screen, select Other user. Then, in the 
screen shown in Figure 14-1, you must provide your domain, username, and password 
credentials.
 
Figure 14-1: Signing in to a domain from the Windows 8 lock screen

466
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
This sign-in must take a specific form, like domain\username or username@
domain, in the username field. (Your employer will provide the domain name.) 
Assuming the domain name is mydomain.com and the username is paul, the user-
name would then be mydomain\paul or paul@mydomain.com.
Alternatively, you can connect to your domain first from a local (or Microsoft) 
account using the Advanced System Properties control panel. You might use this 
method if you wanted to access your work account from your own home PC, for 
example, though again your workplace would likely provide you with additional tools 
(such as a VPN) or information for making the connection.
First, of course, you must find Advanced System Properties. The easiest way is 
to use Start Search from the Start screen, type advanced system, and then choose 
Settings from the Search bar. In the search results list, select View advanced system 
settings. You’ll see a window like the one in Figure 14-2. (If not, navigate to the Com-
puter Name tab.)
 
Figure 14-2: Advanced System Properties
To sign in to your domain, click Change. In the Computer Name/Domain Changes 
window, enable Domain and type your fully qualified domain name (yourdomain.
com) in the Domain field. (Again, this will be supplied by work.) Then, in the dialog 
that appears, type your username only (for example, paul, and not mydomain\paul) 
and password. You’ll be prompted to log off and then sign in with the new domain 
account. Here, again, you’ll need to use either the domain\username or username@
domain.com syntax for the username (for example, mydomain\paul).

467
Domain Join and Group Policy
When you sign in with a domain, Windows 8 works largely as it does otherwise, 
aside from whatever policy-based limitations your corporation has applied. Two obvi-
ous areas of difference include the new Metro-style Mail app, which is discussed in 
Chapter 8: When you run this app, you may be required to accept the workplace’s more 
stringent Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)-based policy, as you can see in Figure 14-3. 
This requirement exists outside of whatever domain-based policies you may have in 
place as well.
 
Figure 14-3: EAS clients like Mail app will be required to conform to your workplace’s  
policies before they can be used with a work-based account.
Likewise, the User Account control panels work differently with a domain. We 
discuss these differences in Chapter 12.
Better Together
As is the case with each new version of Windows, Windows 8 comes with a num-
ber of new group policies that help administrators control new features that are 
specific to Windows 8. Some of these policies are Windows 8-specific, so they 
don’t require a certain version of Windows Server. This means they can be used 
with older versions of Windows Server, like Windows Server 2008 R2. Others are 
related to technologies that also require Windows Server 2012, the Server version 
of Windows 8. These products can work in tandem to deliver certain technologies 
in truly modern workplaces. Suffice to say, that’s pretty rare.

468
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
Domain users are probably familiar with the myriad of ways in which their cor-
porate overlords can control their computing experience. And in each new version of 
Windows, Microsoft adds to these capabilities, which are exposed through a technol-
ogy called Group Policy, part of Active Directory. To give you a taste of what to expect, 
Table 14-1 highlights some of the over 150 new Windows 8-specific policies that have 
been added to Group Policy.

Disk Encryption
Windows 8 supports a number of disk encryption technologies, which prevents 
thieves from accessing sensitive data should your computer be physically stolen: 
If the thief removes your hard drive and attaches it to a different computer, any 
encrypted files cannot be read even if the thief figures out a way to access the hard 
drive’s filesystem. There are two major technologies at play here: the older Encrypt-
ing File System, or EFS, and BitLocker, a more modern and easily managed system.
EFS
EFS, while still available in Windows 8, has been somewhat deprecated. It was cre-
ated as a way to encrypt individual files or, more commonly, a folder. With the latter 
approach, encryption works for both new files as well as those that were present when 
the folder was encrypted. That is, as you add new files to the encrypted folder, those 
files are automatically encrypted.
To encrypt a folder with EFS, right-click it and choose Properties from the menu 
that appears. Then, in the Properties window that appears, click the Advanced but-
ton. In the Advanced Attributes window shown in Figure 14-4, select the option 
titled Encrypt contents to secure data.
 
Figure 14-4: Encrypting an individual file or folder is  
easy and generally quite fast.
When you click OK (or Apply), you’ll be asked to make the change to the folder 
only (which includes all of its contained files) or to the folder and any of its subfolders 
When files 
3
3
are copied or 
moved out of an 
encrypted folder, 
the encryption 
is retained unless 
you move them to 
a location where 
encryption is not 
supported, such as 
to another machine 
on your home 
network.

471
Disk Encryption
and their contents. Windows will encrypt the appropriate items and immediately 
suggest that you back up your encryption certificate and key, which is required for 
recovery should you try to access the folder contents later via a different PC or future 
reinstall of Windows. Microsoft recommends backing these items up to removable 
media. But we’d go a step further and make copies in multiple places, including cloud 
storage like SkyDrive.
Encrypted folders are easily identified later: When you open an encrypted folder, 
you’ll see that all of the enclosed files have a green (rather than black) filename. This 
is a visual indicator that they’re encrypted.
BitLocker and BitLocker To Go
EFS is good for what it is, but it has a few limitations. First, it’s ponderous to encrypt 
an entire hard disk with this technology since it only works with individual folders 
and files; a set-it-and-forget-it whole-disk encryption makes more sense. And second, 
EFS only provides software-based encryption services. A technology that integrates 
with on-PC security chipsets would be far more difficult, impossible really, to crack. 
And finally, EFS encryption sticks with files as they travel around. It would be nice  
if the encryption was automatically removed if a file was copied or moved from an  
EFS-protected folder.
Enter BitLocker and its baby brother, BitLocker To Go. They’re both managed 
from the same control panel, but use slightly different technologies under the 
hood. From a usability perspective, BitLocker is used with fixed disks—those 
disks mounted inside your computer—while BitLocker To Go serves the needs of 
external, removable disks.
Like EFS, BitLocker enables you to encrypt data on your hard drive to protect it in 
the event of physical theft. But BitLocker offers a few unique twists:
BitLocker is full-disk encryption, not per-file or folder encryption. If you 
3
3
enable BitLocker on a disk, it encrypts the entire hard disk, and all future 
files that are added to that drive are silently encrypted as well.
BitLocker can also provide full-disk encryption services to both system and 
3
3
non-system partitions, so in addition to encrypting the entire hard disk on 
which Windows 8 is installed, you can encrypt any other partitions, too.
BitLocker protects vital Windows system files during boot-up: If BitLocker 
3
3
discovers a security risk, such as a change to any startup files (which might 
indicate that the hard drive was stolen and placed in a different machine), it 
will lock the system until you enter your BitLocker recovery key or password 
(discussed shortly).

472
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
BitLocker works in conjunction with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) security 
3
3
hardware in some PCs to provide a more secure solution than is possible with a 
software-only encryption routine. No hacker will defeat a BitLocker-protected 
hard disk.
Files copied or moved from a BitLocker-protected disk are automatically 
3
3
decrypted as part of the copy or move procedure.
There isn’t a heck of a lot to configure for BitLocker. It’s either on or it’s not, and 
you either have TPM hardware or you don’t: If your system does have TPM hardware, 
BitLocker will use it.
To unlock a BitLocker-protected disk, you must use a recovery key. This key can 
take different forms, including a password or smartcard PIN. BitLocker-protected 
disks can be configured to auto-unlock when you sign in to Windows, which is the 
recommended approach for day-to-day use.
BitLocker is generally a seamless experience, with one exception: Some soft-
ware installs are blocked when BitLocker is enabled on your disk. For this reason, 
you can temporarily suspend BitLocker, install the software, and then re-enable 
BitLocker.
W ARN ING ​ ​If you lose your recovery key—forget the password or smartcard 
PIN, for example—it’s game over. There is literally no other recovery option 
available. Microsoft Support can’t help you.
Not scared off?
To enable BitLocker, launch the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel (as always, 
Start Search is your friend). Shown in Figure 14-5, BitLocker is straightforward.
To enable BitLocker (or BitLocker To Go), simply click the Turn on BitLocker 
option next to the appropriate disk. The BitLocker Drive Encryption wizard will step 
you through the process of encrypting the disk and creating a recovery key, which 
can be a standard password or smartcard with PIN.
The wizard will also ask whether you’d like to back up the recovery key, which is 
certainly desirable. You can save to SkyDrive, to a file, or print the recovery key.
Once this is complete, the wizard will present two options, new to Windows 8, for 
encrypting the disk: It can encrypt the entire disk, including the empty space, which 
is slower, or just encrypt the used disk space, which is faster and perfectly acceptable 
for unused disks.
You can’t use 
3
3
any old password: It 
must meet certain 
minimum length 
and complexity 
requirements, which 
could be set by 
corporate policy.
We recommend 
3
3
you do all three. 
(Be sure to keep 
the printed copy 
secure, in a safe 
perhaps.)

Disk Encryption
 
Figure 14-5: BitLocker and BitLocker To Go utilize the same configuration interface.
Encrypting an entire fixed disk can be a very time-consuming process. In fact, 
you may want to do this overnight, though the process doesn’t impact your ability to 
use the disk.
When the encryption is complete, you’ll see that the disk appears different in both 
Explorer, as shown in Figure 14-6, and in the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel.
 
Figure 14-6: BitLocker-protected disks are visually differentiated and now provide  
other options.

474
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
They also have some new options in the control panel. These include the following:
Back up recovery key: 
3
3
While the BitLocker Drive Encryption wizard won’t 
complete without ensuring that you back up your recovery key in some 
fashion, you can back it up again at any time.
Add or Change password: 
3
3
If you’re using a password, you can change the 
password at any time. Or, if you’re using a smartcard PIN, you can add a 
password as a second way to enter the recovery key.
Remove password:
3
3
 You can remove the password if you’ve separately con-
figured a smartcard PIN.
Add or Change smartcard: 
3
3
If you’re using a smartcard PIN, you can change 
the PIN at any time. Or, if you’re using a password, you can add a smartcard 
PIN as a second way to enter the recovery key.
Turn on (or off) auto-unlock:
3
3
 By default, BitLocker-protected disks will 
prompt you for a password (or PIN) each time you sign in to Windows or, in the 
case of an external, removable disk, when you plug the drive into the PC. The 
password entry interface can be seen in Figure 14-7. You can use the Auto-
matically unlock on this PC option, found under More options, to disable this 
tiresome requirement.
Turn off BitLocker:

If you’d like to remove BitLocker encryption from a disk, 
this option will reverse the process.

each time they’re first accessed.

475
Virtualization
Encryption in Windows RT
BitLocker and BitLocker To Go are available only in Windows 8 Pro. But 
Windows RT, the ARM-based version of Windows 8 that’s included with 
Windows devices, includes a feature called drive encryption, which is on by 
default and functions somewhat similarly to BitLocker. Why include this fea-
ture in Windows RT? These devices are managed with a technology called 
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS), which uses policies to ensure that compatible 
devices—which include iPhones, iPads, Android devices, Windows Phones, 
and now Windows RT devices—meet the basic security rules of your organiza-
tion. And one of the policies it can set includes device encryption. Without this 
security feature, many corporations wouldn’t allow users to access corporate 
resources.
Virtualization
In Windows 7, Microsoft provided a virtualization solution called Windows Virtual PC 
that allowed users to run virtualized instances of Windows XP, Vista, and 7, and even 
individual applications within those environments, side by side with native Windows 7 
applications. And it did so without forcing users to manage the complexity of dealing 
with two desktops, one virtualized and one native.
Windows Virtual PC offered decent functionality but middling performance 
because it was based on an older form of virtualization technology purchased long ago 
from Connectix Corporation. So in Windows 8, Microsoft has dramatically expanded the 
virtualization capabilities of its desktop OS. And let’s just say that performance is no 
longer going to be an issue.
Thanks to the integration of its previously server-only hypervisor technology, 
Hyper-V, Windows 8 offers the same core virtualization features as does Windows Server 
2012, albeit aimed at a few core scenarios. And it doesn’t stop there: Windows 8 also 
includes some interesting and useful virtualization integration features that really put 
this version over the top.
Users of 
3
3
Windows 7 
Professional, 
Enterprise, and 
Ultimate could also 
download a free 
feature called XP 
Mode, which was 
essentially a copy of 
Windows XP that  
could only be used  
inside of Windows 
Virtual PC.

476
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
Client Hyper-V
Client Hyper-V, as Microsoft calls the Windows 8 version of Hyper-V, has been 
added to the OS for two primary reasons. One is for software developers who need 
to test applications and web apps on a variety of operating system and browser 
combinations. The other reason is for IT pros who are managing virtualized envi-
ronments using Microsoft’s enterprise virtualization tools—Hyper-V on Windows 
Server 2012, but also Application Virtualization (App-V) and Microsoft Enterprise 
Desktop Virtualization (MED-V)—and want to work with virtual machines (VMs) 
and their Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) locally on a PC before deploying them else-
where in their workplace.
These reasons bear little resemblance to the stated mission of Windows Virtual PC/
XP Mode, which existed for a completely different reason: to provide users with a fairly 
seamless way to access Windows XP-based applications that, for one reason or another, 
simply wouldn’t run natively on Windows 7. And while that may be confusing for some, 
if you need the XP Mode functionality from Virtual PC, you’re still welcome to use it in 
Windows 8 Pro. Client Hyper-V is a completely different animal.
Generally speaking, it’s more capable and powerful than Virtual PC. It offers 
much better performance and you can run multiple virtual machines simultane-
ously. It runs both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, and not just 32-bit like 
Virtual PC. And it comes with an amazing management interface, just like the ver-
sion from Windows Server. (In fact, they’re identical.) This means that your expe-
rience using Client Hyper-V in Windows 8 will be directly applicable to Windows 
Server 2012 as well.
Hyper-V Requirements
Of course, with this power comes some responsibility. And Client Hyper-V comes with 
some important system requirements that can’t be circumvented. These include the 
following:
64-bit PCs only: 
3
3
Client Hyper-V only runs on 64-bit PCs that are running  
the 64-bit version of Windows 8 Pro (or Enterprise).
Chipset requirements: 
3
3
Hyper-V requires modern Intel and AMD microprocessors 
that include Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). This is a feature of all cur-
rent generation microprocessors (for example, Intel “Sandy Bridge” and newer) 
at the time of this writing.
RAM: 
3
3
Your PC must be configured with at least 4 GB of RAM. But with  
virtualization, more is always better, and if you wish to run multiple virtual-
ized OSes, you’re going to need a lot of RAM.

477
Virtualization
Installing Hyper-V
Assuming you meet these requirements, you’re free to install and use Hyper-V. 
Because this is a feature of Windows, you install Hyper-V in the Windows Features 
control panel. This can be hard to find, but the easiest way is Start Search: Type win-
dows features, then select Settings, and then choose the option titled Turn Windows 
features on or off. The Windows Features window is shown in Figure 14-8.
 
Figure 14-8: You can add Hyper-V to your  
PC using Windows Features.
Expand the Hyper-V entry in the list of Windows features, and you’ll see two 
entries: Hyper-V Managements Tools and Hyper-V Platform. Any Windows 8 PC can 
install the management tools, so that option should always be available. But if 
Hyper-V Platform is grayed out, it can mean only one of two things: Either you don’t 
meet the system requirements or the CPU’s virtualization features are disabled in the 
PC firmware or BIOS.
If it’s the latter case, you’ll need to examine the firmware and enable the correct 
features. How you do so, of course, will vary from PC to PC, so there’s no way to pro-
vide general instructions here. Consult your PC’s documentation for the details.
Once you’ve selected all of the Hyper-V features (and do select them all if you’ll 
be using Hyper-V on that PC), click OK to install Hyper-V. The PC will need to be 
restarted. Once it does so, you can use the various Hyper-V tools to create and work 
with virtual machines. There are two primary interfaces: Hyper-V Manager and 
Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection (VMC).
Using Hyper-V Manager
Hyper-V Manager is the Hyper-V management console and the exact same utility that 
is provided with Windows Server 2012 and the Remote Server Administration Tools 

478
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
(RSAT) for Windows Server 2012. As you can see in Figure 14-9, Hyper-V Manager is 
a modern and full-featured tool, and all you need to create, manage, and run virtual 
environments on your PC.
 
Figure 14-9: Hyper-V Manager
Hyper-V Manager is such a feature rich application that describing all of its 
features would require a book in its own right. But here are the top things you  
can do with this utility:
Connect to other PCs or servers: 
3
3
While you can of course work solely on your PC, 
you can also connect to other Hyper-V installs on other PCs or servers in your 
environment. In fact, you can connect to multiple Hyper-Vs, which is useful for 
copying virtual machines from machine to machine, within Hyper-V Manager, 
using drag and drop.
Create a virtual machine: 
3
3
The primary function of Client Hyper-V, of course, 
concerns the creation and configuration of virtual machines, or VMs. To create 
a new virtual machine, click New and then Virtual Machine in the Actions pane 
and then step through the wizard to complete the action. Each virtual machine 
can be configured with a name, (dynamic) RAM allotment, a network, one or 
more virtual hard disks (VHDs), and an attached installation media (which can 
be a physical disc, an ISO, or other source).

479
Virtualization
Create and manage a virtual hard disk: 
3
3
Separate from your virtualized  
environments, you can create and then edit virtual disks that can be used by 
any of these environments (or accessed as physical disks from the host OS—
your PC—using a new VHD shell integration feature we’ll describe shortly).  
To create a new VHD, click New and then Virtual Hard Disk in the Actions pane 
and then step through the wizard. Note that Client Hyper-V now supports the 
newer VHDX format, which provides support for virtual disks up to 64 TB. But 
VHDX is not supported in OSes earlier than Windows 8 and Windows Server 
2012. Also, VHDs can (and should be) configured to be dynamically sized. That 
way, a 2 TB virtual disk—which appears as a single file to the host system—
won’t take up much too much disk space unless you later fill it up with content. 
To edit a virtual disk, select Edit Disk from the Actions pane.
Create and manage virtual switches and SANs:

 Useful in both testing and 
production environments, you can create and manage both virtual switches—
external, internal, or private networks—and virtual SANs, which emulate a 
corporate storage area network.
Manage virtual machines:

3
Once you’ve created a virtual machine, you  
can access its settings and configure far more features than were available 
in the New Virtual Machine wizard. Among other features you can configure 
are the device boot order, the memory (RAM), the number of virtual proces-
sor cores, the attached hard disks (which can be virtual or physical), and 
much, much more. As you can see in Figure 14-10, virtual machines come 
with a dizzying array of settings.
Install and run an operating system in virtual machines: 
3
3
At some point, 
you are of course going to need to install an operating system in that virtual 
machine, configure it to your liking, and then possibly install applications 
within it. You do so as you do when installing Windows or other OSes on a 
physical PC, except in this case it’s running virtually and is accessible in  
a window as shown in Figure 14-11.
Import and export virtual machines: 
3
3
If you’ve created a virtual machine in 
another instance of Hyper-V, you can use the Import functionality to import 
it to whatever machine you’re connected to (the host PC or a remote PC). 
Likewise, you can export virtual machines so they can be used elsewhere. 
You may do this, for example, when you’ve completed configuring a VM and 
would like to deploy it to a product server.

that application, 
choose Action,

Using Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection
Hyper-V is a one-stop shop for creating and managing virtual machines and other 
virtual resources, but sometimes all you need to do is connect to a virtual machine, 
which can be found on your own PC or in a Hyper-V install on a different PC or server 
in your environment. When you want to just work with a single virtual machine that’s 
already created and configured, you can use Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection 
(VMC) instead of Hyper-V Manager.
As you can see in Figure 14-12, VMC looks an awful lot like the desktop version 
of the Remote Desktop Connection utility from Windows 7 (which can be found in 
Windows 8 as well).
To connect to a virtual machine, you’ll need to select the server first. This can 
be a bit tiresome; if you don’t see the server name in the top drop-down list (named 

481
Virtualization
Server), choose the option called Browse for more, then click Advanced and then 
Find Now to search the local network for Hyper-V servers.
 
Figure 14-11: Virtual machines are often run in a window so you can access the host  
machine simultaneously.
 
Figure 14-12: Virtual Machine Connection

482
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
Then, select the virtual machine you wish to use from the Virtual Machine drop-
down list and click OK to connect. When you do, VMC will resemble the Virtual Machine 
Connection window shown back in Figure 14-11. This gives you the opportunity to 
interactively access the virtual OS and its virtual apps and resources in a window on 
your host PC.
NO TE ​ ​If it’s configured correctly, you can also connect to a virtual machine 
using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC). By configured correctly, we mean that 
it’s attached to the same network and includes remote desktop host function-
ality (see later in the chapter) that is enabled. You’ll also need the VM’s host 
name or IP address and the proper sign-in credentials.
VHD Shell Integration
Windows 8 now offers direct shell integration with VHD files, letting you seam-
lessly “mount” them as if they were physical disks and then browse through them 
using File Explorer. To do so, all you need to do is locate the VHD file in question in 
the filesystem—remember, you can create them with Hyper-V manager—and then 
double-click it in File Explorer. (Or, right-click and choose Mount.)
When you do, the VHD is mounted and made accessible as the next available drive 
letter, much as is the case when you insert a USB drive or memory stick. This can be 
seen in Figure 14-13.
 
Figure 14-13: Mounting a VHD as if it were a physical disk

483
Virtualization
OK, fine. But why do this? Working in virtual environments can sometimes be a 
lot slower than doing so with physical PCs and disks. By bridging the gap—accessing 
a virtual disk from your host, physical PC—you can perform actions like bulk file 
copies more quickly than if you do so from within a virtual OS. When you’re done, 
simply right-click the disk in Explorer and choose Eject to unmount it.
C ROSSREF  ​We describe Windows 8’s VHD shell integration further in Chapter  4.
Remote Desktop and Remote Desktop Host
All versions of Windows 8, including Windows RT, include the desktop-based Remote 
Desktop Connection software and have access to the free Metro-style Remote Desktop 
app from Windows Store, allowing you connect to remote computers using Micro-
soft’s RDC technology and access them through a window, much as you access virtual 
machines in a window using Hyper-V Manager or Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection.
As a Metro-style app, Remote Desktop offers a full-screen experience and lets 
you configure multiple remote connections, though you can only access one at a 
time. The Remote Desktop interface can be seen in Figure 14-14.
Remote Desktop Connection is a bit more useful. It runs on the desktop, but you 
can run multiple instances of this application at a time and thus connect to multiple 
remote computers as well. Remote Desktop Connection can be seen in Figure 14-15.
 
Figure 14-14: The Metro-style Remote Desktop app

484
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
 
Figure 14-15: Connect to multiple remote machines simultaneously with RDC.
With Windows 8 Pro, you can also host remote connections, a feature that is 
generally available only on server operating systems like Windows Server 2012. That 
way, you or another user (with the proper credentials) could use Remote Desktop or 
Remote Desktop Connection to access your PC across the home network or, with a VPN 
solution (or Windows Server’s DirectAccess feature), across the Internet. This feature 
is called Remote Desktop Host.
To enable RDH, you need to access the System Properties window. But the easiest 
way to find this interface is to use Start Search: Type remote, select the Settings filter 
in the Search pane, and then choose the option called Allow remote access to your com-
puter. The System Properties window, with the Remote tab preselected, will appear as 
shown in Figure 14-16.
By default, remote desktop connections are not allowed for security reasons. 
To enable this type of connection, choose one of the following options instead:
Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop 
3
3
(less secure): While it’s possible you may want to choose this option, only do 
so if you’ll be connecting to your PC from a very old PC running Windows XP or 
Vista, a non-Windows PC running some other OS, or a mobile device like an iPad.
Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Net-
3
3
work Level Authentication (more secure): If you will be connecting to your PC 
from a PC running Windows 7 or Windows 8 (or Windows Server 2008 R2 or 2012), 

485
Virtualization
this is the way to go. These OSes support Network Level Authentication (NLA), 
and this will provide you with a more secure connection in which you’re authen-
ticated against the remote PC before the connection is fully established.
TIP ​ ​There’s an additional layer of complexity that occurs if you wish to access 
a home computer that is sitting behind a router of some kind from outside your 
home, perhaps from work. To do this, you will need additional software, such 
as a Virtual Private Network (VPN), or you will need to configure your router 
to allow such a connection. Since the latter is complex and router-specific, we 
recommend the former. LogMeIn Hamachi (logmein.com) is a great option for 
this, and it’s free for noncommercial use.
 
Figure 14-16: You configure RDH from this,  
ahem, remote location.
Optionally, you can further lock down the RDH by specifying which users can 
access the PC. That is, when you use Remote Desktop or RDC to connect to your PC, 
you will be prompted to supply a username and password. By default, the currently 
signed-in user is automatically OK’d at the time you enable RDH. But if you want to 
configure other user accounts (or user groups) for this access, click Select Users. 
Then, in the Remote Desktop Users window shown in Figure 14-17, add the users 
and/or groups you want via the Add button.

486
C h a p t e r  1 4    Windows 8 for Business
 
Figure 14-17: Adding additional users to  
RDH with Remote Desktop Users
Note that these users must be already configured for use on the PC, as they will 
sign in to their custom environment when they access the PC remotely.
To test that Remote Desktop Host is working properly, use the Remote Desktop 
client on another PC on your network to try and connect to your PC.
Features Exclusive to Windows 8 Enterprise
In addition to the Windows Pro-based business features that were discussed in this 
chapter, Microsoft is also providing a unique set of features for users of the Windows 8 
Enterprise edition. This high-end Windows 8 product edition is available only to corpo-
rate customers that subscribe to Microsoft’s Software Assurance volume licensing pro-
gram. So while it doesn’t make sense to spend too much time describing each feature, 
we can at least provide a rundown of what most of us are missing.
Unique features in Windows 8 Enterprise include the following:
Windows To Go:
3
3
 This feature lets you deploy a new, fully manageable Windows 8 
environment on a bootable external USB flash drive, enabling the “Bring 
Your Own PC” (BYOPC) usage scenario. Employees can use Windows To Go on 
any company PC as well as from their home PC, securely accessing corporate 
resources on an encrypted device that would be useless in the hands of others. 
Windows To Go is a feature we hope to see ported to other Windows editions in 
the future, and it would be a huge boon to lab environments of all kinds, includ-
ing those used by educational institutions.

487
Features Exclusive to Windows 8 Enterprise
DirectAccess: 
3
3
This is a more modern take on VPN functionality, letting remote 
users seamlessly access corporate network resources without dealing with the 
hassles common to VPN solutions. DirectAccess is based on the proven HTTPS 
(secure HTTP) tunneling technology Microsoft first used with Exchange Server. 
There’s no VPN configuring, connecting, and reconnecting. In fact, there’s no 
VPN at all. Instead, DirectAccess-enabled PCs are simply always connected, 
securely, to the corporate network. As long as you have an Internet connection, 
you’re in. And for the end user, there’s nothing to see or configure. You’re simply 
connected. And on the administrative side, IT pros and admins can configure 
which corporate resources are available to which users, and they can direct 
Internet-based network traffic as they see fit.
BranchCache: 
3
3
Aimed at distributed corporations, BranchCache lets servers 
and users’ PCs in branch offices cache files, websites, and other content that 
is sent from a central office over the WAN, so that it is not repeatedly down-
loaded at great cost by different users in the same location. With more and 
more corporate mergers and acquisitions, and larger companies maintaining 
separate physical offices in different locales, this is a real need.
AppLocker:
3
3
 Introduced with Windows 7 as a replacement for Software 
Restriction Policies (SRP), AppLocker is more flexible and malleable but 
offers the same basic functionality: It uses Group Policy-based rules to 
determine which applications users can and cannot access. But it goes 
deeper than SRP by introducing the concept of publisher rules, where 
admins can specify which application versions are allowed or disallowed. 
For example, suppose there’s a known vulnerability in an out-of-date ver-
sion of Adobe Reader, the popular PDF viewer utility. With AppLocker, you 
could specify that users are allowed to install and use Adobe Reader 10.01 
(or whatever) or newer, only. Problem solved: Users retain the ability to 
view PDFs and you, the administrator, don’t need to worry that they’re 
doing so with obsolete and potentially dangerous versions of the software.
VDI enhancements:
3
3
 With updates to RemoteFX and Windows Server 2012, users 
can access virtualized instances of Windows 8 Enterprise from the data center 
and receive rich desktop experiences via thin clients, including, interestingly, 
Windows RT-based tablets. (See the following section for more information 
about Windows RT in the enterprise.)
Windows 8 (Metro-style) app deployment:
3
3
 Domain-joined PCs and tablets 
running Windows 8 Enterprise will automatically be enabled to “side-load” 
internal, Windows 8 Metro-style apps, bypassing the Windows Store.

Windows RT and Business: A Tablet 
for All Seasons
While ARM-based Windows RT tablets and devices are aimed squarely at the consumer 
market, Microsoft also knows that these devices will be hugely popular at work, because 
they’re deployed by the employer or because users will simply choose to use them to get 
work done. There’s just one problem: Windows RT, like the basic version of Windows 8, 
doesn’t support domain join, so you can’t integrate your Windows sign-in with your 
employer’s Active Directory environment. Fortunately, Windows RT has two things 
going for it that will somewhat mitigate this issue.
First, Windows RT, like all versions of Windows 8, fully supports the Exchange 
ActiveSync (EAS) management protocol, the same technology that businesses use 
to manage devices all of kinds, including Windows Phones, Apple iPhones and iPads, 
Android handsets and tablets, and many other devices. EAS provides a ton of manage-
ment functionality, including:
Push-based corporate e‑mail, calendaring, tasks, and contacts: 
3
3
And these 
all integrate with the appropriate Metro-style apps on Windows RT, including 
Mail, Calendar, and People.
Password:
3
3
 Your workplace can specify a minimum password length, that 
a password is required to use the device, that an alphanumeric password 
is required, and password reset intervals. After a failed number of sign-in 
attempts, the device can be remote wiped or disabled. And many, many more 
password policies are available.
Timeout:
3
3
 Your workplace can specify that if the device is left unused for a set 
period of time, it will be locked automatically.
Device encryption: 
3
3
Your employer can require that any disks attached to the 
device be encrypted. This can include the primary storage device (the inter-
nal hard disk or SSD) as well as external storage. Windows RT provides this 
support with device encryption.
Hardware device disabling: 
3
3
Your workplace can specify that certain devices 
in the Windows RT tablet be disabled, including the camera, Bluetooth, IrDA, 
and more.
Software disabling: 
3
3
Your employer can specify that certain types of soft-
ware be disabled, including consumer e‑mail, POP3/IMAP e‑mail, web 
browser, and more.

489
Summary
Second, Microsoft is providing a special Windows RT management client that will 
allow users to connect to a self-service portal on their employer’s servers and browse 
and install Metro-style line of business (LOB) apps that would otherwise require a 
domain connection, as well as perform other duties. Key among these is the abil-
ity of the employer to specify compliance around certain EAS-type policies such as 
device encryption, the enabling of Auto Updates, and the configuration of antivirus 
and anti-spyware solutions.
While these capabilities don’t quite amount to domain join, they do remove most of 
the pain with using a Windows RT-based device for work in a managed environment. It 
remains to be seen how many companies will be forward leaning enough to implement 
this in the years ahead, however.
Summary
There’s no doubt that Windows 8 is a huge upgrade for consumers, a revolutionary 
new version of Windows that will allow Microsoft’s most successful product line 
to enter new markets for touch-based portable devices. But Windows 8 isn’t just 
about fun and games. Like previous Windows versions, it comes well-stocked with 
an abundance of business-oriented features, including updated versions of many 
preexisting features like domain join and Group Policy support, EFS, BitLocker 
and BitLocker To Go, and more.
Windows 8 includes new business features, too. It picks up the powerful 
Hyper-V virtualization platform from Windows Server 2012, providing users 
with an astonishing new tool for managing virtual environments and resources. 
And Hyper-V is further bolstered by new VHD shell integration and a new Virtual 
Machine Connection client. Remote desktop users will find both Metro-style and 
desktop clients as well as a secure version of Remote Desktop Host that will allow 
you to access your own desktop PC remotely.
Those corporations that opt for Windows 8 Enterprise will see several other 
additional features. And even consumer-oriented Windows RT tablets can make 
their way into businesses thanks to Exchange ActiveSync compatibility and a 
unique management client.
