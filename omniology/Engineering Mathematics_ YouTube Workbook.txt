The delivery method for each learning module in the workbook is as follows:
• Briefly motivate the topic under consideration;
• Carefully discuss a concrete example;
• Mention how the ideas generalize;
• Provide a few exercises (with answers) for the reader to try.
Incorporating YouTube as an educational tool means enhanced eLearning benefits, for example, the 
student can easily control the delivery of learning by pausing, rewinding (or fast–forwarding) the video 
as needed.
The subject material is based on the author’s lectures to engineering students at UNSW, Sydney. The 
style is informal. It is anticipated that most readers will use this workbook as a revision tool and have 
their own set of problems to solve – this is one reason why the number of exercises herein are limited.

Partial derivatives & partial differential equations
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV56UC31rbk, [PDE].
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are very important in modelling as their solutions unlock the 
secrets to a range of important phenomena in engineering and physics. The PDE known as the wave 
equation models sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields such as acoustics, 
electromagnetics and fluid dynamics.
Motivation 
Consider the wave equation
∂2w
∂t2 = c2∂2w
∂x2 ,
c is a constant.
Show that a solution is given by
w(t, x) := cos(2x + 2ct).
Example 
• When verifying solutions to PDEs, compute the necessary derivatives and show that the 
PDE holds.
• In certain circumstances, the chain rule will be required to compute the partial 
derivatives of interest.

Consider the wave equation
∂2w
∂t2 = c2∂2w
∂x2 ,
c is a constant.
Show that another solution is given by
w(t, x) = ln(3x + 3ct).
Show that the wave equation has solutions of a more general form
w(t, x) = f(x + ct)
where f is a sufficiently smooth function. (Hint: use the chain rule.)
Exercises

Partial derivatives & chain rule
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOzMR22HsiA, [Chain].
The chain rule is an important technique for computing derivatives and better-understanding rates 
of change of functions. For functions of two (or more) variables, the chain rule takes various forms.
Motivation 
Let the function w := f(x, y) have continuous partial derivatives. If we make a change of variables: 
x = r cos θ ; y = r sin θ  then show that
∂w
∂r = ∂f
∂x cos θ + ∂f
∂y sin θ.
Example 
• It is generally helpful to draw a simple diagram to understand which form of the chain 
rule to apply.
• For functions of two (or more) variables, the chain rule takes a more profound form than 
the one–variable case.

Error estimation
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLrHCkesOA8, [Est].
When taking measurements (say, some physical dimensions), errors in the recorded measurements are 
a fact of life. In many cases we require measurements to be within some prescribed degree of accuracy. 
We now look at the effects of small variations in measurements and estimate the errors involved.
Motivation 
A cylindrical can has height h and radius r. We measure the height and radius and obtain 12cm and 
5cm respectively, with errors in our measurements being no more than 0.5mm. As a result of the 
errors in our measurements for h and r, obtain an estimate on the percentage error in calculating 
the volume of the can.

There are two important motivational points concerning Leibniz’ rule:
• If a function I defined by an integral is useful for modelling purposes, then it would seem 
to make sense that the derivative I' would also give us insight into the problem under 
consideration;
• Leibniz’ rule can be applied to evaluate very challenging integrals.

Some max/min problems for multivariable functions
Assume that f is continuous and has continuous partial derivatives up to and including all those of 
the second–order.
• Determine the critical points of f by solving the simultaneous equations: fx = 0 and fy = 0.
• If (a, b) is a critical point determined from above and defining 
D(a, b) := fxx(a, b)fyy(a, b) −[fxy(a, b)]2
then the nature of the critical points can be then determined via the 2nd-derivative test:
1)	 If D(a, b) > 0 and fxx (a, b) < 0 then f has a local maximum at (a, b);
2)	 If D(a, b) > 0 and fxx (a, b) > 0 then f has a local minimum at (a, b);
3)	 If D(a, b) < 0 then f has a saddle point at (a, b);
4)	 If D(a, b) = 0 then the 2nd-derivative test cannot be used and some other method or 
technique must be sought to classify our critical points.
The bigger picture
Determine and classify all the critical points of the function
f(x, y) := x2 + xy + 3x + 2y + 5.

The method of Lagrange multipliers
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E-uLaRhrcA, [Lag1].
The method of Lagrange multipliers is a very powerful technique enabling us to maximize or minimize 
a function that is subject to a constraint. Such kinds of problems frequently arise in engineering and 
applied mathematics, eg, designing a cylindrical silo to maximize its volume subject to a certain fixed 
amount of building material.
Motivation 
Consider a thin, metal plate that occupies the region in the XY-plane
Ω:= {(x, y) : x2 + y2 ≤25}.
If f(x, y) := 4x2 −4xy + y2 denotes the temperature (in degrees C) at any point (x, y) in Ω then 
determine the highest and lowest temperatures on the edge of the plate.

Suppose f and g have continuous partial derivatives and: ∂g/∂x ̸= 0; ∂g/∂y ̸= 0; when g = 0.
• If f is our function to maximize/minimize and g = 0 is our constraint then the method of 
Lagrange multipliers involves calculating the critical points of the Lagrangian function 
L := f −λg
where λ is the Lagrange multiplier.
• To solve the resulting simultaneous equations, some creativity is often required.
• If L has more than one crticial point then compare values of f at each critical point to 
determine which gives max/min values of f.

The gradient field of a function
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5wsWDt1Cg, [Grad].
The gradient field of a function is one of the basic concepts of vector calculus. It can be used to 
construct normal vectors to curves and surfaces, it can be applied to calculate slopes of tangent lines 
to surfaces in any direction, and can be very useful when integrating over curves (line integrals) to 
compute work done.
Motivation 
Consider the function f(x, y) := x2 + 4y2.
1.	 Compute ∇f.
2.	 Show that ∇f is normal to the level curve f(x, y) = 16.
3.	 Calculate the rate of change (directional derivative) of f at (1, 1) in the direction 
u = (1, 1).
Example 
• The gradient readily generalizes to equations involving three or more variables, 
∇f = (fx, fy, fz).
• For differentiable functions f the vector ∇f will always be normal to level curves / level 
surfaces of f.
• For differentiable functions of two variables the directional derivative of f at P(x0, y0) in 
the direction of u is just the slope of the tangent line to the surface of f with the tangent 
line lying in the vertical plane that contains (x0, y0, f(x0, y0)) and u.
• Directional derivatives are generalizations of partial derivatives.
The bigger picture 
Consider the function f(x, y, z) := x2 + y2 −z2.
1.	 Compute ∇f.
2.	 Compute a normal vector to the surface f (x, y, z) = –7 at (1, 1, 3).
3.	 Calculate the rate of change (directional derivative) of f at (1, 1, 1) in the direction 
u = (1, 1, 1).
[Ans: 1. (2x, 2y, –2z); 2. (2, 2, –6); 3. 2/√3.]

The divergence of a vector field is one of the basic concepts of vector calculus. It measures expansion

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to mathematically model a range of phenomena from 
science and engineering. ODEs naturally arise when making simple physical assumptions about the 
model under consideration. By computing a solution to an ODE we can make precise predictions 
about future and past states of the model of interest.
Separable ODEs are a special type of ODE and have the form
dy
dx = f(x)g(y).
Motivation
(a) Solve the separable ODE
dy
dx = −x
2y.
(b) If we have the extra information y(0) = 1 then determine the constant in the solution in (a).
Example
• To solve a separable ODE simply: separate the variables (via divsion and / or 
multiplication) and then integrate both sides.
• Sometimes some algebraic manipulation is required to identify a separable ODE.
• If an initial condition is known, then the arbitrary constant from the general solution can 
be determined.

Introduction to the Laplace transform
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7BzFOlJtKw, [LT1].
Laplace transforms are used in solving initial value problems that involve linear, ordinary differential 
equations with constant coefficients. These types of problems usually arise in modelling of phenomena. 
Laplace transforms offer an advantage over other solution methods to initial value problems as they 
streamline the process and can easily deal with discontinuous forcing functions.
Motivation
Define and denote the Laplace transform of a function f = f(t) by
L{f(t)} :=
 ∞
0
e−stf(t) dt = F(s).
(7.1.1)
1)	 From the above definition, calculate
L{e−2t},
for all
s > −2.
2)	 If a is a constant then use (i) to make a conjecture concerning
L{e−at},
for all
s > −a.
Example
• While it is possible to directly use the definition of the Laplace transform to perform 
calculations, it is standard practice to use a table of Laplace transforms. This can save a 
lot of time!
• The inverse of the Laplace transform is denoted by L−1. Roughly speaking, it “undoes” 
the Laplace transform and vice-versa. From (ii) we deduce

• If f has a jump discontinuity at c then Sf(c) = [f(c+) +f(c–)]/2.
• Simplifications occur when dealing with odd or even functions.

Fourier series can be useful in solving differential equations that arise in the study of vibrations. They 
provide a means of approximating discontinuous periodic “forcing” functions over intervals (rather 
than just near certain points).

Deriving the heat equation
View this lesson at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-CI61wV6JQ, [HeartDerive].
In the early 1800s, J. Fourier began a mathematical study of heat. A deeper understanding of heat 
flow had significant applications in science and within industry. A basic version of Fourier’s efforts 
is the problem
α2uxx = ut; u(0, t) = 0 = u(L, t); u(x, 0) = f(x)
where: u(x, t) is the temperature at position x at time t; α2 is a constant; and f is a given function.

PDEs & separation of variables
Derive the heat equation
ut = α2uxx 
(9.1.1)
where α2 := κ/ρc  called the thermal diffusivity (in (length)2/time) and κ , ρ and c are positive 
constants that depend on the material of the bar.
Example
Our assumptions and method may be summarized as:
• The total amount of heat H = H(t) in D (say, in calories) is
H(t) =
 x1
x0
cρu(x, t) dx.
• Fourier’s law of heat flow says that heat flows from hotter regions to colder regions and 
the flow rate is proportional to ux
dH
dt = −κux(x0, t) −(−κux(x1, t)).
• Differentiation then gives us two expressions for dH/dt which can be equated to form the 
heat equation.
