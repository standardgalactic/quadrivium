EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE EDITOR
Sharil Abdul Rahman | PC.com Editor
H
ello and welcome to another issue of PC.com. We 
have a packed issue for June, so let’s get right into it. 
Health is a very important subject that everyone 
needs to take care of. Without good health, we 
can’t do the stuff that we like to experience daily. Hence why 
the growth of the industry is important, and the growth we are 
seeing of the health sector and IT spending is something to be 
amazed. Another thing to be amazed is that there are many 
names that are usually associated with consumer products in the 
health sector. Check out our cover story this month to see what 
we are talking about. 
Of course we want to be healthy, so we invest in gadgets that 
can help us track our lives and even our health info. These health 
bands are full of tech, but then are they worth the money to 
invest in? Check out our showdown this month as we put these 
health bands to its paces (literally).
The new Huawei P10 Plus is our star of the Tested for June. 
We also have a couple more items in the list that may catch your 
eye. This includes the new Samsung QLED TV, the ASUS GR8 
II, The Fujifilm X100F and for our football fans, the ExMobile JDT 
Special Edition smartphone. Check out our tested page to see all 
of these and more. 
If you like challenging games, check out what we have in 
our Gametime reviews this month. NiOH is a PS4 game that is 
stimulating and beautiful to look at the same time, and it could 
and maybe should be in your gaming list. Read our review if you 
feel you agree with this statement. 
June is shaping to be a month to look out for, as we have our 
team on the ground at Computex 2017 in Taipei. Look out for our 
coverage in our next issue. To all of our Muslim readers, Selamat 
Berpuasa!
Until next month, keep on reading!

What are the differences between Western 
Digital hard drive colours?
Chin Kok Leong
LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
The greater the clock speed of a graphic card would result in faster performance but that is also dependent on 
the architecture used in the graphic card (i.e. like NVIDIA’s Pascal architecture).
Full HD resolution allows you to watch videos in 1080p resolution without any problems at all. However, you 
won’t be able to get the full experience of 4K videos if you were to watch it on a Full HD display.
The colours of WD hard drives denote the different series, 
RPM speeds and purpose of usage. For example, WD Blue 
is for your everyday usage while Purple is more towards 
video surveillance. Hope this helps!


Samsung Launches The Galaxy 
S8 & S8+ In Malaysia
The latest flagship from Korea hits local shores
fter waiting for quite some 
time, Malaysians can now 
get their hands on the new 
flagship from Samsung – the 
Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+. The twin 
offerings from the biggest electronics 
company brings to the table a slew of 
new features and a design that is out 
of this world, and with curves to boot.
“We firmly believe that meaningful 
progress can only happen when you 
dare to defy barriers; and the Galaxy 
S8 and S8+ are true representations 
of our technology prowess and fine 
examples of how we push boundaries. 
By reshaping the device that we have 
all come to intimately know and rely 
on, and adding to it an exciting suite of 
A
new features, our latest addition to the 
Galaxy line-up define what it means to 
simply ‘unbox your phone’. The Galaxy 
S8 and S8+ open a gateway to a rich 
mobile life that takes you beyond the 
boundaries of today’s experiences 
and unlock the full potential of your 
imagination,” said Lee Jui Siang, 
Vice President, IT & Mobile Business, 
Samsung Malaysia Electronics.
The new phone features technology 
like the new Infinity Display, a power 
efficient yet powerful 10 nanometre 
processor, a great combination of the 
rear 12-megapixel camera and the 
new front 8 megapixel selfie shooter, a 
large screen within the compact body, 
and large batteries – a 3000mAh for

the Galaxy S8 and a 3500mAh unit 
for the largest S8+. It also features 
future-proof support such as Gigabit 
LTE and USB Type-C connection that 
can be used for fast charging, fast 
data transfer or with the optional 
Samsung DEX dock, a desktop-like 
experience from a device that fits 
snugly in your pocket.
The design of the new S8 and 
S8+ is also something to check out, 
as the subtle curvature flows from 
the front of the device to the back to 
create a more ergonomic grip ideal for 
one-handed operation. The phone’s 
camera, fingerprint scanner and heart 
rate sensor have been incorporated on 
the back of the device in a way that 
minimises protrusions, ensuring a 
sleek aesthetic at any angle.
The 
Galaxy 
S8 
and 
S8+ 
provide 
strengthened 
security 
features through the integration of 
Samsung’s trusted Knox security 
platform and a combination of 
new 
and 
enhanced 
biometric 
technologies. The Galaxy S8 and 
S8+’s highly secure iris scanner 
is fast, accurate and touch-free, 
making user verification easier 
than ever, adding to the device’s 
other security feature – fingerprint 
scanning. The Galaxy S8 and 
S8+ also provide various security 
services including Secure Folder, an 
encrypted folder that keeps private 
information separate and safe with 
an added layer of security.
If you are looking to get one right 
now, it is available from now and 
retailing at RM3,299 and RM3,699 
respectively; it is available from all 
Samsung Experience Stores and 
authorised dealers nationwide.

no matter how dark or light the scene 
on the screen is, giving you the greatest 
possible outcome. Samsung has also

features for its QLED TVs, such as the

controls what.

new tone of class and sophistication.

mount isn't up to your taste, Samsung 
also offers a range of stylish TV stands 
like its easel-like Studio Stand or its 
Gravity Stand, which provides easy 
display rotation.

photos similar to those taken by SLR 
cameras in macro mode. The dual rear 
camera is also able to take photos 
from different angles and combine 
them together to create high-quality 
3D photos. In addition, the refocus 
mode allows users to select the focus 
area after shooting in order to see

armin has officially unveiled 
three new smart bands into 
its arsenal – the vivosmart 
3, the Forerunner 935 and the vivofit 
jr., Garmin’s first attempt at making 
smart 
bands 
targeted 
towards 
children. While the vivosmart 3 and 
the Forerunner 935 are successors to 
an earlier time, the vivofit jr. is a one-
of-a-kind for Garmin.
The vivosmart 3 was made for 
the everyday active user who is 
constantly on-the-go as it provides 
statistical insights on the wearer’s 
fitness levels as well as providing an 
estimated fitness age. This allows 
the user to compare their own fitness 
level with the estimation and work on 
what needs to be done to get them at 
the same age. If you’re a gym junkie, 
the vivosmart 3 also comes with a 
rep counting feature in its Strength 
Training activity tool. This makes 
it easier to lift weights and keep 
count. Another new and nifty feature 
introduced into the vivosmart 3 is the 
all-day stress tracking feature, which 
is capable of tracking stress levels 
based on heart rate variability. It also 
provides breathing exercises to lower 
stress levels if it ever gets too high.
What makes the vivosmart 3 
great is that its suitable for adults of 
all ages; if you have a family, you can 
get the kids involved with health and 
fitness too with the vivofit jr. Fitted 
with some of the same features as 
the vivosmart 3 like step and sleep 
tracking, the key feature of the 
vivofit jr. is the free parent-controlled 
mobile app. It provides educational 
adventures in keeping kids fit 
and healthy, family-oriented step 
challenges as well as reward-based 
task completions.
However, for heavy-duty health 
fanatics who are interested in 
marathons, triathlons and such, 
the Forerunner 935 is the perfect 
fit for you. While sharing similar 
features with the Garmin Fenix 5, the 
Garmin Made for All
Garmin introduces three new devices, one of which are for kids!
G
Forerunner 935 comes with a 24/7 
heart rate monitor as well as new 
training exercises, which will help an 
athlete better recover through fine-
tune exercises. Paired with Firstbeat 
technology, it allows wearers to 
better monitor the performance 
and better prepare for an upcoming 
marathon or race.
All three devices are available 
at Garmin’s headquarters located 
in Cheras as well as concept stores 
around Malaysia. The vivosmart 3 
comes in black (small/medium/large) 
and purple (small/medium) and will 
be retailing at RM699. The vivofit jr. is 
retailing at RM399 and is available for 
kids aged between four to nine and in 
three funky colours for kids – Broken 
Lava, Digi Camo and Red Flower. 
Lastly, the Forerunner 935 is priced at 
RM2,449 and is available in black and 
yellow with the option of switching 
with Garmin QuickFit bands in leather, 
silicone or metal.

he wave of portable and versatile laptops 
has steadily been on the rise for the past few 
years as more and more people have come 
to realise that the day of working in an office 
cubicle is becoming a thing of the past. With the 
help of the HP Spectre x360, you can now work from 
anywhere and everywhere thanks to its consistent 
performance while remaining extremely adaptable in 
any given situation.
To ensure you can keep the Spectre x360 in your 
arms or resting comfortably in your bag, it weighs 
at only 1.32kg and is only 13.9mm thick, making 
it the perfect laptop to have with you always. 
With something that compact and lightweight, 
the Spectre x360 also spares no expensive in the 
design department as it was crafted entirely out of a 
single block of aluminium. With a blend of black and 
gold thrown into the mix, the Spectre x360 exudes 
style and class while allowing you to remain highly 
productive. Located at the back of the laptop lies two 
360-degree hinges that keeps the base connected 
to the 13.3-inch Full HD (FHD) display. The hinges 
allow you to turn the Spectre x360 into four different 
shapes of your choosing.
The crème de la crème of the Spectre x360 is its 
versatility to turn it from a conventional laptop into 
something more. If you’re busy grinding through your 
emails and proposals, keep it in Laptop mode to get all 
your work done. Once that is over and you’re ready to 
present your work, flip the screen over into Tent mode 
so you can have the best viewing angle of the Spectre 
x360 without having the base in the way. If you 
want to watch a movie or make a video call, flip the 
screen over and leave the keyboard-facing side of the 
base flat onto the surface to have it in Media mode. 
Although the cooling fans will be facing upwards, you 
won’t even hear it. Lastly, if you’d much rather prefer 
to write down your thoughts onto the Spectre x360, 
you can flip the display screen all the way until it rest 
on the back side of the base, giving you a 13.3-inch 
tablet to work with. Fun fact, the keyboard will be 
disabled the moment you flip the screen.
T
If you’re wondering how the Spectre x360 can 
keep up with all these features and functions, fret not 
as its powered by Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor 
as well as having up to 8GB of RAM to boot. You 
can now multitask through anything without having 
to worry about the Spectre x360 trying to keep up. 
It also comes housed with faster PCIe storage so 
starting it up, shutting it down or even opening any 
application or software, it is definitely more than fast 
enough for your needs, especially when you’re on-
the-go.
Not only is the Spectre x360 great for 
productivity, it works wonders with movies and 
music. This is due to the quad speakers, which have 
been finely tuned by the experts over at Bang & 
Olufsen. Watch your entertainment come to life as 
the quad speakers are backed with HP Audio Boost, 
HP’s very own audio configuration program that will 
constantly measure and maximise the speaker’s 
topmost output while ensuring the sound stays 
crystal clear all-day long.

otorola first broke the mould of mobile 
devices with the launch of the Motorola 
RAZR, a flip mobile phone that had 
many consumers in shock and awe. 
These days, the craze for Motorola devices have died 
down considerably. However, the launch of the Moto 
M is just the device to bring Motorola back into the 
mainstream market as one of the manufacturers in 
mobile devices. Having already been acquired by 
Lenovo back in 2014, Motorola brought forth the Moto 
M earlier this year, complete with a 5.5-inch Full HD 
(FHD) display wrapped in an all-metal body.
Available in Gold and Grey, the 
all-metal unibody of the Moto M 
keeps it looking spectacular, 
whether on the table or 
in the palm of your 
hands. The biometric 
f i n g e r p r i n t 
scanner 
is 
mounted 
on the 
back of the device right below the camera, giving you a 
much easier and more natural finger placement rather 
than many other smartphones these days. This leaves 
the front device free of any noticeable buttons, giving 
it a cleaner outlook overall.
Housed within the Moto M lies the Mediatek 
Helio P15 octa-core processor and is available in two 
variations – you can choose between having 4GB 
of RAM and 64GB of internal storage space. This 
gives you greater versatility when multitasking and 
performance power to get everything that needs to be 
done straight on the Moto M from switching between 
social media apps to video streaming and even playing 
games. If you’re starved for space, the Moto M 
can also support an additional 128GB via 
a microSD card, which will take 
over the slot of its dual-
SIM capability.

As far as looks,
in a class by itself
Motorola is back in the game by announcing a new addition to the family
device lies the 16-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 
aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and 
Colour Correlated Temperature (CCT) flash with dual 
LEDs. This allows you to capture stunning images 
in crystal clear clarity with minimal noise and 
distortion. The front-facing can also hold its own with 
8-megapixels so your selfie game will always be on 
point. When it comes to listening to music or watching 
videos, the Moto M has got you covered as its rear 
speaker features patented Dolby Atmos technology. 
This will allow the sound to move in three-dimensional 
space, giving you amazing clarity, richness and depth 
to your music and movies that no other smartphone 
can achieve.
If you’re worried about getting the Moto M wet, 
fear not as it with an invisible layer of nanocoating, 
protecting the device from accidental splashes and 
spills. You also will never have to worry about the 
Moto M dying out on you in the middle of the day 
as enclosed in its metallic unibody lies a 3,050mAh 
battery with rapid charging capabilities and is 
supported with a USB Type-C port. Juice it up in a 
matter of minutes and the Moto M will last you the 
entire day.

elcom and Ericsson conducted 
a 5G trial in Malaysia, 
showcasing the future of 5G 
technology and the potential capabilities 
for a more connected world. 
The trial featured 5G Radio 
Prototypes, achieving a peak throughput 
up to 18Gbps (Gigabits per second) and 
latency as low as 3ms (milliseconds). 
This is the first ever 5G trial on the 
28GHz band in South East Asia. The 
nation’s first 5G lab trial demonstration 
was witnessed by Yang Berhormat 
Dato’ Jailani Johari, Deputy Minister 
of Communications and Multimedia at 
Menara Celcom in Kuala Lumpur. 
The event also showcased many 
use cases, including robotic control, 
connected environment, virtual reality, 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications and 
4K video streaming over 5G. Although 
the technology is still a few years away 
from rolling out to consumers, Celcom 
and Ericsson are set to drive technology 
innovations in Malaysia, supporting the

Connected Future

C
government’s “Digital Malaysia” vision 
that calls for the creation of a developed 
digital economy by 2020. 
Todd Ashton, Head of Ericsson 
Malaysia & Sri Lanka, says: “This 
collaboration with Celcom is a further 
demonstration of our support for 
Malaysia on its journey towards 5G, 
following on from the success of the 
Innovation Center for 5G that we set 
up last year with Universiti Teknologi 
Malaysia. Together with partners like 
Celcom, we will study and test this new 
technology to capture the full potential 
of 5G for consumers, business users and 
entire industries in the country.”
Compared to 4G, 5G will give 
consumers wider bandwidth, higher 
bitrate and lower latency. This all 
translates to faster upload and download 
speeds, as well as shorter time 
connected to the network - which saves 
your device's battery life. As technology 
becomes increasingly connected and 
real time data a commodity, network 
speed and latency becomes more and 
more important. Technologies such as 
VR, AI, machine learning, autonomous 
vehicles, robotics and big data analytics 
rely heavily on fast access to data. 
Celcom’s 
recently 
announced 
“journey to 5G” will involve the 
deployment of key technologies such 
as 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-
output (MIMO) and 256 QAM 
(quadrature amplitude modulation) 
to provide users with data speeds up 
to 400Mbps (megabits per second). 
In the near future, Celcom will also 
deploy IoT to enable digital and 
connected living. Both Ericsson and 
Celcom didn't comment on a specific 
timeline for rolling out commercial 
pilot trials in Malaysia. 
Michael Kuehner, Chief Executive 
Officer of Celcom Axiata Berhad, says: 
“5G is very important to Celcom as 
it will support the development and 
meet the communication needs of 
consumers and digitisation of various 
industries. It is critical that we explore 
this new generation technology and 
its capabilities with global partners 
like Ericsson.”
Ericsson signed a Memoradum of 
Understanding (MoU) with Celcom 
in Barcelona back in February. The 
MoU saw Ericsson and Celcom 
striking a partnership, cementing both 
companies' commitment to bringing 
5G and IoT capabilities to consumers 
in Malaysia. 
Initiatives such as this 5G trial 
illustrate the many technological 
enablers 
needed 
to 
open 
up 
opportunities and realise the full 
potential of Digital Malaysia. 5G 
presents a huge opportunity for 
telecom 
operators 
who 
address 
industry digitalisation, with foreseen 
global revenue potential of USD 582 
billion by 2026. Manufacturing and 
energy sectors represent the biggest 
opportunity for revenues created or 
enhanced by 5G.

Jabra launches 
the Evolve 75
First in the region, the new headset features active noise 
cancelling
or companies who are looking to turn 
their calls into pitch perfect voice

a new headset called the Evolve 75. 
And upgrade to the previous model launched 
locally, the 75 now features two-stage noise 
cancellation for both the speakers and the 
microphone, which will help in transmitting 
clear and concise conversation to the other end 
of the call. 
Designed for the open office, the Jabra 
75 is part of the popular Evolve line that has 
been sold for over 2.5 million units around the 
world. Recent research from Jabra found that 
knowledge workers lose about 24 minutes a day 
thanks to noise and distractions, and it takes 
on average 20 minutes to get back to the work 
groove that they were on before. 
The Jabra 75 comes with Bluetooth 
connectivity, which is using the Bluetooth 4.2 
version. It also supports Dual Connectivity, 
where two devices can be connected at the 
same time. This means you can connect both 
your phone and laptop to the Jabra 75 at the 
same time. 
“The premise behind the open plan 
office is to foster collaboration and improve 
F

their many benefits, they have become breeding 
ground for unsatisfactory labour output,” says 
Holger Reisinger, SVP, Jabra Business Solution.

conducive for better work performance.”
The Jabra 75 is now available, and if you are

nationwide through the common 
language of sports, building values 
of excellence and innovation and 
sharing the joy that success brings. 
“We are very pleased to support 
Tunas Lagenda - the brainchild 
of our national football legend 
Haji Bakri Ibni, a midfielder who 
represented the Malaysian national 
football team in our glory days of the 
70s and the 80s. He is an amazing 
coach and advisor to have for the 
young and aspiring Malaysian talent 
who want to develop international 
football excellence. The fact that 
they are part of the National Football 
Development Programme (NFDP) 
launched by the Prime Minister in 
2014, also speaks volumes of the 
club’s achievements and potential.
At Epson, we stand for creative 
thinking and challenging ourselves, 
and not surprisingly, ur global tagline 
is “Exceed Your Vision”, which we 
see synergistic to Tunas Lagenda’s 
key philosophy. We both stand for 
breaking through barriers in pursuit 
of excellence”, said Danny Lee, 
General Manager, Sale & Marketing, 
Epson Malaysia.
Elated with Epson’s outreach, 
Haji Bakri Ibni, Founder, President

Lagenda’s vision is to produce star 
rated players for the national football 
team, who will be the best in Asia 
and the world. We are committed 
to creating the next Football Legend 
and we do this by recognising the 
potential and giving equal opportunity 
to all children in the country to put 
forward their football talent and 
develop it to the highest level. We 
are thrilled that Epson Malaysia 
shares our values and that we will 
work together over the coming year 
for even better results .”
“I 
believe 
that 
Malaysian 
football can be again in the top 
flight of Asian football. Through 
our efforts at TLFC, we will bring 
back the glory to Malaysian 
football. Our young men from 
TLFC will grow up not only to be 
professional players but develop 
the entire ecosystem by becoming 
capable referees, part of technical 
teams, football administrators and 
so on”, Bakri concluded.
When asked, Danny said that there 
is a possibility of players and coach 
exchange with sister clubs under Epson’s 
sponsorship umbrella - this includes 
Matsumoto Yamaga FC in Japan. At 
the same time the sponsorship will also 
have Epson’s logo as the titular sponsor

ithout anyone noticing, technology has seeped into our daily lives. From smartphones, computers and even something 
as small as a connected light bulb – technology is not only an important facet of the modern daily life – it is also 
a catalyst to many great things. However did you know that tech is also a big thing in the health industry? From 
connected tablets to health bracelets – health tech is now becoming one of the big verticals to look out for. IDC 
forecasted that Healthcare will be the fastest-growing industry in terms of IT spending, which is said to have a compound average

hile the idea may be 
foreign, 
technology 
has 
always 
been 
part and parcel of 
the health industry. 
Major technological breakthroughs 
and innovation are made possible 
throughout the years by researchers 
toiling through years of research and 
information to come out with a result 
that will change the medical and health 
industry. Most of this discovery was 
made with the use of tech and devices 
that helped the professional extract the 
required information. 
One of the earliest tech that is still 
in use today is the microscope. There 
are many purported designers and 
inventor of this medical tool, but the 
idea of glass used together to magnify 
a tiny (or microscopic) object. Of course 
the modern microscope is more than 
just a simple glass arrangement – we 
have now companies that incorporate 
new features and tech to make a 
researcher’s live much easier. 
Companies like Olympus and Leica 
are but a few of the names that are 
associated with the medical and health

industry. They are the world leaders in providing 
innovative microscopy, camera and software solutions 
for imaging and analysis of macro-, micro- and 
nanostructures.
Some of the features you can see in a modern 
microscope includes enhanced glass for clearer image, 
video capture, external image output and much more. 
You may be surprised that we are seeing names that 
are usually associated with photography in the health 
sector, but taking a look back, it is a logical step from 
them talking about taking a photo of a landscape, to 
taking photos and video of something on a microscopic 
level. 
Not only imaging is important – data collection and 
storage is also another big ticket item for the health 
industry. As health care professionals look after their 
patients, they collect a lot of data from their patients – 
health status, readings, x-ray and many more data that 
needs to be collated into a cohesive collection for the 
health professionals to make judgement on the status 
of the health of the patient. 
To this extent, many companies around the 
world are either producing or partnering with 
other companies to produce health-sector specific 
products that can help these health professionals to 
collect and make sense of the data they have in their 
hand. Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Panasonic 
and HP are producing devices that can help these 
professionals, but creating a central point of reference 
for data. Products like the iPad, Microsoft Surface and 
HP ElitePad Health are changing on how health data 
are collected as doctors and nurses can now access 
more data at their fingertips, to help in their diagnosis 
and treatment of the patient.
With these new devices, comes new apps to take 
advantage of the processing power that is available on 
tap. Applications are evolving at great speed, catching 
up to the needs and requirements of the health 
professionals. Five years ago, doctors may have their 
needed information on their Blackberries, but they are 
usually just simple reference for specific items that 
they need access to. Now with high speed broadband, 
doctors can instantly get drill-down information in 
regards the matter that they are checking at that 
instance. Apps such as Epocrates and PEPID are now 
invaluable tools to doctors on the go as these apps 
allows instant referencing to happen – in regards to 
drugs, symptoms and other information that can help 
in diagnosis. 
Doctors are embracing this explosion of technology. 
Apart from apps that can help them get better 
reference, there are also apps out there that gives 
the patients better access to doctors. A company in 
Malaysia has created Doctoroncall.com.my, a service 
where patients can access information the nearest 
doctor to their location. The service gives patients 
information on the nearest clinic, without the need 
to search the local directory. The service also gives 
the doctor a channel to diagnose the patient directly, 
without the need to wait in long lines in waiting 
rooms, as the diagnosis can be done online, and better 
still, the medicine delivered straight to the patient’s 
doorstep. This service has been a great success for 
the doctors who are involved in the service, and are 
looking to expand their services in the near future.
Another segment of the health industry that is 
actually dominated by big-name consumer brands is 
imaging. Brands such as Olympus and Fujifilm are no

stranger in this segment, as they are first and foremost 
trusted brand names in consumer imaging world wide – 
so it is a simple logical step for them to enter the world 
of medical imaging as they can bring their expertise 
in camera and lens technology to the diagnosis and 
operating table. Olympus specifically is famous 
for their micro-imaging technology, as they have 
experience in creating products such as endoscopes 
for diagnosis purposes. Fujifilm meanwhile is famous 
for their  digital X-ray imaging and diagnostic systems, 
digital mammography systems and X-ray films. There 
is a big chance that your next encounter with medical 
imaging, you will see these brands on the side of the 
endoscope/MRI machine the doctor will be using on 
you.
One new area that is fast becoming big among 
both the health professionals and even the consumer 
are personal health tracking. This segment is now one 
of the big verticals of the consumer health segment 
that can’t be ignored, and the number of players that 
are vying for a slice of the market pie is growing is 
getting bigger by the year. Names such as FitBit, 
Apple, Google and even Moto and Huawei are on the 
bandwagon to deliver consumer grade devices that 
can track health, and in turn, data that is collected can 
be used by the physician to advise the user on how 
they can enhance their lives, or maybe even tweak 
their daily routines to turn their good life to a better 
one. 
Of course technology evolves over time, and 
sometimes what was fantasy can be reality. Take for 
example the Medical Tricorder from the sci-fi show 
Star Trek. It is an all-in-one device that doctors can 
flip open and diagnose the condition of a patient on 
the spot, which can save time, energy and most likely 
the life of the patient as the diagnose can be made 
immediately. 
We are not there as of yet, but thanks to the 
teams who took part at the recent Qualcomm XPrize 
competition, we are getting close to that reality. The 
winner of the Qualcomm XPrize Tricorder competition 
is a company called Final Frontier Medical Devices. 
Their device, the DxtER, emerged as the winner for the 
contest which netted them a US$ 2.5 Million grand 
prize. The system, which revolves around the iPad, can 
accurately diagnose over a dozen illnesses through the 
usage of several sensors that can be attached to the 
patient. These sensors are small enough that it can be 
carried in a small bag to make the doctor more mobile. 
Thanks to the connected iPad, the system can pull 
together data from a patient’s personal and family 
medical history. The system also pulls in data from 
physical exams, information from files as well as 
from the aforementioned sensors to make a quick and 
accurate assessment of the patient’s health status. 
This system is great for doctors on the go, or perhaps 
for use during emergency times and triaging patients 
on the ground.
Technology and health medicine is fully intertwined 
since the dawn of mankind. They go hand in hand, and 
they usually become catalysts for one and another to 
advance technological innovation. As mankind steps 
into the unknown, being in perfect health is very 
important. Hence, technology and heath will be a vital 
tool to master in the years to come .

The Flagship’s Flagship
Huawei P10 Plus
A Perfect 10?
After making its debut at MWC 
2017, we finally get the much-
anticipated Huawei P10 Plus into 
our labs. As an owner of a P9 Plus, 
I felt obliged to take it in my stride 
to see if the P10 Plus can woo me 
away from my current paramour. 
At first glance, I wasn’t a fan of its 
front-mounted fingerprint scanner; I 
much prefer where it was on the P9 
Plus. However, the scanner is much 
faster compared to my device and 
even setting it up takes less touches. 
Even the simplest of touches unlocks 
the device, making it much easier to 
unlock.
New is Always Better
After using the P10 Plus for a bit over 
a week, I have been slightly swayed 
by its design as its curved edges and 
sides are much more comfortable 
to hold compared to my P9 Plus. 
It is also slightly smaller compared 
to the P9 Plus in terms of screen 
width, giving it a slight edge when 
I have it in my hands. The downside 
is the display screen, which is prone 
to easy smudging – although it isn’t 
considered punishable by death, it 
smudges a lot more than the former.
Upgraded Hardware
The P10 Plus is fitted with its in-
house developed HiSilicon Kirin 
960 while the P9 Plus comes with 
the 955. It also comes with 6GB of 
RAM while mine has 4GB, making 
multitasking and daily usage 
significantly better. Although both 
devices have an octa-core processor, 
the P10 Plus just edges out ahead 
of the P9 Plus in terms of speed and 
performance. The benchmark scores 
also paint a pretty picture as its 
placed much higher compared to the 
P9 Plus.
Keeping some 
Similarities
The Home and Volume 
button placement 
remains the same as the 
P9 Plus as well as the 
SIM card tray.
More Colour 
Variety
Unlike the P9 Plus – 
which only offered 
two colours – the 
P10 Plus gives you 
eight colours to 
choose from: Arctic 
White/Dazzling 
Blue/Dazzling Gold/
Graphite Black/
Moonlight Silver/Rose 
Gold/Greenery.

Crème de la Crème
Obviously, the main reason why 
most people would be interested 
in the P10 Plus – its Leica-certified 
rear dual-cameras. This time round, 
it comes with a 20-megapixel 
monochrome lens and a 12megapixel 
RGB lens with f/1.8 aperture. The big 
win is obviously the optical image 
stabilisation (OIS), which was missing 
from the P9 Plus. After taking the 
camera for a joyride, I must say that 
the camera is much better compared 
to mine and I now regret ever buying 
the P9 Plus (I am a bandwagon 
jumper).
Coming Out on Top
Even the camera on the P10 Plus focuses on the subject much faster compared to the P9 Plus and it can even record 
in 4K quality. The P10 Plus has officially trumped the P9 Plus with its camera alone as that would give it the edge in 
this race. Although I’m still using my P9 Plus, I am currently looking for buyers who are interested in a second-hand 
device which is less than a year old – you know where to find me. 
Starting out with its monochrome lens, 
the P10 Plus captures great detail in it 
while still remaining very sharp.
The picture places the focus on the shoe 
while creating a nice bokeh effect, all 
thanks to its wide-aperture lens.
Longer and Faster
The P10 Plus comes with a much 
larger battery capacity – 3,750mAh 
to be exact and it lasts much longer 
compared to the P9 Plus while also 
charging faster.

Ultra Nice, but Ultra (too) Big?
HTC U Ultra
A big, big phone
If you are comfortable in carrying 
a large phone around with you, the 
HTC U Ultra may just be the phone 
for you. With its 5.7-inch screen, 
the phone is on the large size on 
average, but because of the large 
screen it can show more to the user 
without sacrificing any realestate or 
even features (except one of two) 
that most modern smartphones has. 
HTC (will) Sense U
The latest version of the HTC Sense 
overlay is quite interesting as it is not 
as Sense-heavy as previous models, 
and it combines both the design 
aesthetic of stock Android and HTC’s 
own design elements. The Sense 
UI also works with the secondary 
screen to show all the notifications 
that is received throughout the day. 
The second display also works as a 
touch screen, so quick access icons 
can be loaded there for easy access.  
Shoot away
The camera on the HTC U Ultra is 
one of the better shooters in the 
market. The 12 megapixel HTC 
UltraPixel 2 sensor features both 
PDAF and Laser focusing system 
to ensure photos are sharp and on 
tack. It has on board Optical Image 
Stabilization to ensure shake-free 
photos, and the f/1.8 aperture lens 
will give the camera a leg’s up for 
low light photos. It can also record 
4K video with ease.

Zooming Into Your Hearts
Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom
Metal is a Must
The Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom comes 
with an all-metallic unibody design, 
crafted in such a way that your fingers 
would feel right at home. It certainly 
does feel that way as its especially 
comfortable when taking pictures. The 
only drawback I have to the Zenfone 
3 Zoom is that it tends to slightly 
overheat when it’s on heavy duty 
usage like streaming through Netflix or 
YouTube videos. Aside from that, it’s 
clear soft bumper made it a joy to have 
in my hands.
It Takes Two
The time of dual-lens on smartphones 
is here and Asus is now part of the 
equation. The Zenfone 3 Zoom carries 
two independent camera systems 
– a 12-megapixel f/1.7 aperture, wide-
angle lens while the other houses a 
12-megapixel 2.3x optical zoom lens. 
You can also switch between the two 
lens for greater efficiency as the wide-
angle lens is also great at capturing 
images in super low-lighting conditions. 
The optical zoom lens on the other 
hand allows you to shoot at 12x zoom 
while leaving the image sharp and 
crystal clear with minimal noise.
DSLR-like Quality and Feel
Although it would be taking it a step 
too far to say the Zenfone 3 Zoom can 
match up to a DSLR camera, it does 
provide a similar feel to what a DSLR 
can offer when in Manual Mode. Aside 
from being having control over the 
shutter speed, ISO and white balance 
with a single touch, you can also 
instantly switch the lens between the 
25mm or 59mm focal length, giving 
you more versatility when shooting. 
Changing the settings and switching 
between the lens was easy and super 
quick, which made things easy for a 
newbie like me. 
Selfies Galore
The front-facing camera 
is surprisingly powerful – 
fitted with 13-megapixels, 
f/2.0 aperture and with 
a Sony IMX214 camera 
sensor, you could take 
countless selfies and not 
be able to decide which 
makes you look better.
Great for Videos
As it comes with a 5.5-inch, 
Full HD 500nits AMOLED 
display with 76.5% screen-
to-body ratio, the Zenfone 
3 Zoom is perfect for 
movies and videos as its 
painstakingly bright and 
clear without causing any 
discomfort to the eyes.
Staying Awake
 for Days
Paired with a 5,000mAh 
battery, the Zenfone 3 Zoom 
lasted me for almost two days 
on a single charge – and that 
is with me using it constantly 
for social media and video 
streaming.

Stabilise Your Mobile 
Zhiyun Smooth Q
3-Axis Magic
The Zhiyun Smooth Q brings to the 
masses a way to stabilize their video 
taken with the smartphone that does 
not come with optical stabilisation 
built in. What you get is a gimbal that 
can rotate on the X, Y and Z axis (pan, 
rotate and twist) so your videos will be 
buttery smooth everytime you swing 
around the room for footage.
Full Camera Controls 
After installing the companion app, 
users can control the parameters of the 
gimbal with the physical controls that 
is on the gimbal itself. Control the pitch, 
yaw and roll of the smartphone head. 
There is also a button to activate the 
shutter or video recording, depending 
on the mode the app is in. Of course 
the gimbal can be used without the 
app as well. 
Free to Follow
There are two main modes with the 
gimbal – a free mode (also known 
as follow) and a locked mode. The 
former will allow free movement of 
the smartphone without focusing on 
a single point, while the latter will lock 
the focus point to a single point, so that 
whichever direction you are swinging 
the gimbal it will be locked to that 
point. The latter is useful to follow a 
subject while the latter is useful to do a

Shoot from Anywhere 
Bundled together with theAS300R 
action cam is the Live-View Remote, 
which can either be strapped to your 
wrist or held with your hand. This 
allows you to see what the camera 
sees while giving you full control 
of the camera as well. The action 
camera also comes with a built-in 
stereo mic so you won’t need to 
insert an additional mic to capture 
the sounds of nature.
More Than One Way to 
Strap On
Whether it’s strapping the camera 
onto your chest, helmet, dongle or 
cradle, the AS300R can fit into any 
device for a first- to third-person 
view of what you’re shooting. If you 
want to capture still shots, you can 
also fit the action camera onto a 
tripod to give it more stability.

Monster Firecracker
Compact, yet powerful
The Firecracker is named aptly – it’s 
small but packs a punch. Around the 
size of a water bottle, it’s lightweight 
and easy to carry anywhere – 
camping, road trip, or just a small 
speaker in the room. Don’t be fooled! 
They might be small, but it can get 
really loud – enough that you can 
hear clearly what is being played in a 
room 2 floors up. The music quality 
is decent too – not top of the shelf, 
but definitely clear, with bass coming 
through really nicely. Although 
softer tones can get ever so slightly 
muffled.   
• Built in super-bright 7 hour flashlight
• High-intensity daylight, 5000K
• 500 Lumens
• Pure Monster Sound wirelessly with 
NFC
• Stereo (from 2 Full-Range Drivers) 
with passive bass radiator

• Heavy-duty cabinet with color-

Is it a torchlight?
Yes. Yes it is. It’s a torchlight – and 
a very bright one at that. You could 
totally camp out with that. You can 
search for keys in the dark with that. 
You can even use it to double up as 
lighting for photography if you’re in 
a pinch. Besides that, it’s weather 
proof – so you don’t have to worry 
about it getting wet. It’ll still work 
without troubles
Keep going, forget the 
cables
The battery is said to last for 25 
hours – and indeed, on full blast I’ve 
subjected my house to my sometimes 
eccentric music choices for the 
entire day and it was still going. 
Plus point if you turned it on and it’s 
not connected to any devices for a 
significant period of time, it will turn 
off automatically, saving power. 
Fiesty Little Beast
Bluetooth connected
The Bluetooth sensor is 
quite sensitive, and connects 
easily with my mobile 
devices. If I left an area, and 
returns to the vicinity, it 
reconnects instantly.
One cable to charge
The charging cable is a 
standard microUSB so if 
your phone uses the same 
wire – you don’t need to 
bring any extra wires just to 
charge this baby up.
No slipping
Rubber bumpers ensure that if you put 
it on any surface it won’t slip off. It’s 
survived my maniacal driving, while not 
moving an inch on the dashboard.

Down to Basics
BLU Grand M
It’s down to basics
OK, it’s not bells and whistles and 
there isn’t a lot to sing about. It’s got 
a standard specs that could hold up 
to daily use. Of course if you decided 
to load a graphics heavy game it’s 
going to lag and seize up for at least 
a good 30 seconds. Having said that, 
it does do daily tasks pretty well. 
Given it’s a RM300 range phone, it’s 
reactive to changes and swapping 
between a few apps is smooth. 
Lights, Camera, Action!
The camera is actually quite decent. It 
comes with a 5MP rear camera and a 
3.2MP front camera – both front and 
rear camera has LED flash. It’s pretty 
clear too, with colours that are vivid.
Charger?
Oddly the charger 
that came in 
the box came 
with a US pin – 
and without a 
detachable cable. 
I had to use my 
other cables to 
charge it. It works 
with any micro

Nano SIM
You’d be forgiven 
to think that 
given the specs, 
you’re expecting 
a micro SIM slot. 
Nope – you have a 
nano SIM slot and 
a hybrid slot for 
nano SIM or micro 
SD.
Keep it essential
With limited storage and memory – you might want to keep 
your apps to the bare essentials – or use Lite version of apps. 
Standard day use
At 2200mAh, it’s not going to be a 
power house. Just generally scrolling 
through social media, browsing web, 
texting, navigation, taking photos 
and calling – that will take you 
through a decent work day. But if you 
are looking to use battery sucking 
applications like navigation for long 
periods – well, be prepared to have a

Illegear Q5 Evo
Bang for your Buck
If you’re into the modern wave of 
virtual reality (VR) gaming but are 
afraid of having to pay through the 
nose to experience it, the Q5 Evo is 
capable of accommodating VR-ready 
gaming, theoretically. With specs 
like the NVIDIA GTX 1050Ti GPU as 
well as the Kaby Lake i5-7300HQ 
processor, the Q5 Evo is VR-ready 
as it meets the Oculus Minimum 
Specifications. Although we never 
got a chance to test it out as we don’t 
have an Oculus Rift lying around in 
the office but on paper, it should 
work out just fine.
Gaming Made Easy
eSports scene with games like Dota 
2, Overwatch, League of Legends 
(LoL) and Counter Strike: Global 
Offensive (CSGO), the Q5 Evo would 
be your best bet at streaming live 
games as well as gaming on it. After 
running through Dota 2, Overwatch 
and CSGO, the Q5 Evo handles itself 
pretty well without any frame rate 
drops and virtually no lag whatsoever. 
However, you might want to reduce 
the settings on Overwatch otherwise 
your frame rates would drop but not 
to the point of being unbearable. 
Upgrade 
Needed
Although the 
15.6-inch FHD 
anti-glare display 
is more than 
adequate, I’d 
much rather 
upgrade it to 
include Wide 
Colour and Wide 
View for better 
resolution.
More is 
Always Better
The Q5 Evo comes 
with 6GB of DDR4 
RAM, which can 
be expanded to 
32GB for greater 
performance and 
speed.
Great for Movies
With the 15.6-inch FHD 
display, you can now 
enjoy movies paired 
with the Sound Blaster 
Cinema 3 feature built-
into the speakers.
Build Your Own
Illegear has always been known to 
gamers around Malaysia as the only 
brand that allows you to customise 
your own gaming laptops. Sadly, 
that almost always comes with an 
exorbitant price tag. While most 
of its gaming laptops are towards 
the steep pricing range, the Illegear 
Q5 Evo is a much more affordable 
option compared to its older brother 
– the Q5.

Fix the Trackpad
Although 90% of my time with the 
Q5 Evo was for gaming, I have no 
need for the trackpad as I’ll be using 
the mouse. However, the real flaw I 
had with the laptop was its trackpad, 
which had a really challenging time 
registering my movements or when I 
were to click on something. Although 
it isn’t that big of a deal, it does 
hamper my daily usage quite a bit as 
I had to stick with my mouse for the 
entire duration after that.
Great for Casuals
When it comes right down to it, the 
Q5 Evo is a great laptop if you’re

and Overwatch on it without any 
problems. With its modest price 
point and adequate specifications, 
the Q5 Evo is for gamers who are on 
a budget but still want something 
stylish while still holding its own when 
gaming. 
Easy Plug & Play
The Q5 Evo comes with a host

The Devil Is In
Power Color Red Devil RX580
Not the Devil
The Red Devil by Power Color is one of 
the first RX580 based graphic card in 
the market. The card is quite boxy, and 
features heavily angular shapes. Black 
with red accent is the order of the day, 
which is apt for it’s “Red Devil name” – 
not to be confused with the Red Devil 
football team yeah.
Performs like the Devil
Under the hood, this graphic card 
rocks a 14nm AMD RX580 chipset 
(Ellsemere), 8GB of GDDR5 memory 
that has been clocked to 2000Mhz 
and has an interface width of 256bit. 
The card itself will try to push itself 
to 1380Hz, which is a mind blowing 
optimisation compared to the RX480. 
For efficient power draw, the card 
utilise an 8+6 power connections.
Maybe it is the Devil…
The Red Devil RX580 supports DirectX 
12, as well as Vulkan. Combined with 
the 8GB GDDR5, as well as the faster 
clocked graphics, AAA games should 
be not a problem with this card. And 
best of all this powerful card only 
draws 550W max

Middle of the Pack Power
For those who are ok with something 
middle of the pack, the new AMD 
Ryzen 1500X is perfect for you. 
Why? The value it represents is quite 
something else. It has the same number 
of cores as a comparable CPU from the 
Blue team, but at a lower price point.  If 
you are looking value for money, this is 
a good investment to start with as you 
will be getting more power for every 
RM you spend.
65watt TDP
Thanks to the lower TDP on the 1500X, 
it does not need super expensive 
power supply or even cooling to keep 
it cool. But it will still deliver the power 
and performance you expect from 
the Ryzen series of processors. We 
saw impressive performance from 
the 1500X, nearly matching its bigger 
brother the 1600X, and edging some of 
the other processors available on the 
market currently. 
Unlocked performance
Because the Ryzen chips are all 
unlocked processors, there will be 
little barrier for anyone to start to 
dabble and overclock this processor. It 
is also stable enough at most speeds 
even when overclocked to deliver 
good performance in daily usage and 
gaming, that we are whole heartedly 
recommending this for anyone who 
are looking for a mid-tier computer to 
build around. 
Gently, Now
It uses pins rather than LGA – so be 
careful when installing this in your 
motherboard
More to Come
More motherboards supporting 
this CPU will be available after 
computex, so stay tuned!
Light em' Up!
The included Wraith CPU 
cooler is cool – it even comes 
with RGB lighting!

Keeping it Curvy and with Quality
Samsung QA65Q8C QLED 4K TV
Riding on a High
Just when you thought Samsung 
couldn’t get any more popular after 
the high demand of its Galaxy S8 
and S8+ smartphones, it goes ahead 
and introduces its QLED TVs in 
spectacular fashion. Being the first in 
the industry to feature quantum dot 
(QD) technology into TVs, Samsung 
is paving the way for constantly 
innovating our lives with its devices, 
whether it’s a smartphone or even a TV.
Home Theatre-friendly
Coated in a full on metallic body, the 
Q8C features a 65-inch QLED 4K ultra 
HD display paired with a border-less 
design. Watching movies on it is a 
definite must as you will now have 
nothing in the way of the screen so 
you can enjoy it like how the director 
intended for it to be. Not to mention 
– it’s sleek, metallic design can blend 
into any modern household with ease, 
giving an added touch of class and 
elegance.
We Need More QD Tech
QD technology essentially 
encompasses very small 
semiconductor particles that are only 
nanometres in size and is capable of 
emitting light of specific frequencies if 
electricity or light is applied to them. 
In Samsung’s case, its QD technology 
helps to create an even brighter TV 
without causing friction with the colour 
and contrast, giving you a perfect 
blend of sharpness and brightness.
Be Gone Cable 
Clutter
Samsung fits all 
your cables into 
a single optical 
cable connect to 
its One Connect 
Box, removing 
the need for cable 
management and 
giving your TV a 
much cleaner and 
neater outlook.
You’ll Need Deep 
Pockets
To get your hands 
on one of the QLED 
TVs, you will have 
to pay through 
the nose – the 
cheapest QLED 
TV it has to offer is 
priced at RM12,999…

Giving Colours New Life
Thanks to HDR, it also provides great colour contrast to the Q8C, allowing 
you to spot even the darkest of objects in a black background setting. The 
Q8C also comes with a wide viewing angle without compromising on its 
colour consistency. While most TVs lose out on colour and contrast when 
viewed from a side angle, the Q8C provides the same consistency, 
no matter where you’re watching it from. 
Many Ways to Mount
Whether mounted on a wall, with a 
Gravity Stand or the easel-like Studio 
Stand, the Samsung Q8C 65-inch TV 
can be displayed in a variety of ways 
to suit your household.
Free Streaming
Lasting until 30th June, every 
purchase of the Samsung QLED 
TV grants you a free 12-month 
subscription to Asia’s top VOD 
service – iflix.
One Remote to 
Control it All
Whether it’s the TV, its One 
Connect Box or even your Blu-
ray player, every Samsung QLED 
TV comes with the One Remote 
Control, removing the need for 
multiple remotes.

Samsung fits its QLED TVs with plenty 
of features that is sure to rival even 
the best of OLED TVs. Aside from its 
QD technology, the brightness of the 
TV reaches up to 2,000nits, which is 
a lot for a TV. The Q8C also comes 
with HDR technology, which further 
increases brightness of colours while 
still maintaining the deepest blacks on a 
much wider range as compared to what 
is provided with a conventional TV.

For the Girls
vivo V5s
Seen One, Seen All
As with most smartphones these days, 
vivo has taken a similar approach to its 
flagship – the V5s with a sleek metallic 
unibody design. Although quite stylish, 
it pretty much shares the same design 
concept from Oppo. At a certain angle, 
it also resembles the ever-popular 
fruit smartphone that we all love to 
hate. The only flaw I could find with 
the design is the fingerprint scanner 
placement, which I am not a fan of.
Touching is Fun
Except little kids, that is just 
unacceptable. However, I digress; the 
V5s is equipped with the FunTouch OS 
3.0, its own iteration for the Android 
smartphone. With reduced bloatware 
while still featuring nifty features, the 
V5s is great if you’re looking for a no-
nonsense smartphone. One feature 
that I adore is the App Clone function, 
giving you another copy of an app 
that can hold two separate accounts. 
This helped me distinguish between 
WhatsApp chats of girls so I don’t 
accidentally reply to Sarah, thinking it’s 
Olivia (names have been changed for 
obvious reasons).
Selfie King Candidate?
With the tagline ‘Perfect Selfie’, you 
would guess that the V5s is capable 
of taking excellent selfies that increase 
your Follower count on Instagram and 
Facebook. As debatable on who the 
real selfie king is, the V5s would be a 
strong candidate as its front-facing 
20-megapixel camera. It also has plenty 
of features to deceive your followers 
into thinking you have flawless skin 
and perfect complexion, making it that 
much easier to gain more followers and 
sponsorships.
Great for Guys and Gals
The V5s comes in two colours 
– Crown Gold and Matte Black, 
making it great for both genders 
as the colours.
Easy on the 
Eyes and 
Hands
Its curved edges 
and metallic 
unibody makes 
the V5s easy to 
grip your fingers 
around while still 
looking great.

Overall Experience
As I am not the type to flood my Facebook or Instagram with selfies (I’m 
not that narcissistic), I would probably still get the V5s as its priced quite 
reasonably, which means I wouldn’t have to break the bank for it. As most 
smartphones go, the V5s is great if you’re looking for a good-looking 
device that can do all the necessities and can last you for hours; if you’re 
into selfies, that’s an added bonus. 
Lasting Long 
Enough
With the 3,000mAh 
battery, the V5s is 
fairly long-lasting as 
I could go through 
an entire day with it 
without needing a quick 
recharge.
Just smile 
and wave
Taken with the Face 
Beauty feature, the 
V5s’ front-facing 
camera does make 
your complexion 
insanely clear while 
covering up any 
blemishes you may 
have.
I'm High 
Dynamic
 Range
The HDR feature 
on the front-facing 
camera makes 
your pictures look 
highly realistic but 
still keeping it clear 
and sharp.
Numbers Don’t 
Lie… mostly
Based on the 
benchmark scores, 
the V5s comes off as 
a completely mediocre 
smartphone that is only 
capable of taking gorgeous 
selfies and uploading them 
onto social media. To a certain 
extent, that is true but the V5s 
is also great for streaming videos 
and playing casual games like 
Pokemon Go and Candy Crush 
without causing the battery to drain. 
However, if you’re into games that 
are graphic-heavy, you might want to 
steer clear from this.

not expect the best at the highest 
resolution. Still, the fact that 
something this small can be your VR 
machine is very commendable. 
Full Selection of Ports
Thankfully the GR8II does not come 
with lack-o-port-titis. On the front 
you get two USB 3.0 ports, alongside 
audio and microphone ports, while 
at the back you get a bevy of ports 
which includes Gigabit Ethernet, USB 
Type-C, multiple USB 3.0, two HDMIs, 
one DisplayPort and even an optical 
S/PDIF port for high resolution audio. 
Small yet powerful
The power brick is quite hefty, 
but it powers the juice needed 
to run this machine
LAN Party Approved
 The volume of the machine is only 
4-litres, making it portable enough 
for LAN parties 
Listen to footsteps
Gaming-grade audio with 
ROG SupremeFX audio- Hi-Fi-
grade audio, including Sonic 
Studio III and Sonic Radar III for 
unbeatable aural experience
Compact yet powerful
If you are looking for something 
that is small yet gives a good punch 
for games – the ASUS GR8II is your 
ticket. Thanks to the powerful Intel 
Core i7 7700 inside this machine, it 
can handle just about anything you 
can throw at it – be it modern AAA 
gaming, intensive graphic-based 
computation or even simple web 
browsing. 
this is the 
ultimate mean

Lacking in storage options
Out of the box, you only get 256GB 
of SSD storage. Yeah, it is barely 
enough for two or three games that 
nowadays can run up to 30GBs per 
install or more. Luckily ASUS has 
made upgrading the GR8II an easy 
one – just slide open the side panel, 
and you have access to more M.2 
slots and 2.5-inch bays for more 
SSDs.
Like a jet engine
The GR8II is quiet when it is idle – the 
rated value is about 23db, which is about 
the same as a quiet room. However 
when it is on full load – it will get loud 
quickly. The first time we heard the fans 
spooling to cool the system we thought 
a jet engine was going to take off! 
However the cooling is working because 
the system did not heat up as expected 
for something that is this small and 
compact. 
Let there be light
Yes, you get RGB lights 
everywhere – on the front, 
on the sides and on the top.

Not only the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1

managed to make magic happen 
and fit a 13-inch display in a 12-inch

the laptop has a fan less design so

USB Type-C is the future
Even though it is slim, it has enough 
space for a few connecting ports. 
You get two USB Type-C – one 
on each side – that also works 
for charging and external display 
through Thunderbolt. A microSD slot 
is there for any external data, and a 
combo headphone/microphone jack 
completes the package. Oh, Dell also

Sharp Like A Blade
Sharp AQUOS UA440X 4K UHD TV
Above Average Picture 
Quality
In terms of how the TV performs, 
it cannot match up to the likes of 
LG, Sony or even Samsung for that 
matter. The good thing about the 
UA440X is that even with its 60-inch 
4K UHD resolution, it still performs 
admirably with colours consistency 
looking bright and sharp without any 
bleeding or pixilation. However, the 
TV doesn’t come with a wide viewing 
angle so watching it from the sides 
can cause the picture to look bland 
and blurry. 
Is it Worth Buying?
Priced at RM5,699, the Sharp AQUOS 
UA440X is a value buy in most cases 
as you will get a 60-inch TV with 4K 
UHD resolution at a reasonable rate, 
most of which can’t be said about 
other brands in the market. The only 
drawback is its smart TV applications, 
limited mounting capabilities and 
its somewhat bulky demeanour – 
depending on whether you’re into it 
or not. 
Not so 
Versatile
Aside from its 
regular two-
legged stand, 
the UA440X 
can be wall-
mounted but 
it would have 
to be from a 
third-party as 
Sharp doesn’t 
produce its own 
wall mounts for 
the TV.
Built-in Speakers
The UA440X also comes with double-firing 
speakers located at the back of the TV 
on both sides, giving you clearer sound 
without any distortion.
HDR Not Included
Sadly, the UA440X or even any other 
Sharp TV for that matter comes with HDR 
technology, giving it less range in terms of 
colour and brightness.
Easy 
Navigation
The remote of 
the UA440X 
comes with 
a dedicated 
button for both 
Netflix and 
YouTube so you 
don’t have to 
waste time and 
effort changing 
any settings.
PRICE: RM5,699

SPECS
Slow and Steady
Unlike its competitors, Sharp has 
been rather slow in taking off with 
its range of TVs as the likes of LG 
and Samsung have shot past them 
thanks to the use of OLED and QLED 
technology. However, what Sharp 
lacks in technological innovations, 
it makes up for it in pricing as the 
UA440X is reasonably priced, 
making it a worthy option to take 
into consideration.

VERDICT: “ Aside from its steep price point, the Xperia XZs is long-lasting and has an Instagram-worthy smartphone with 
awesome features. ” - Wi-Liam
If it Ain’t Broken…
Sticking with a similar design that 
has not faltered for some time now, 
Sony Xperia smartphones has stuck 
to its guns by giving almost all its 
devices a similar look. However, 
the key difference to each device is 
the feel of the smartphone in your 
hands. The XZs is by far the most 
comfortable to hold in your hand, 
especially for long hours when 
wrapped around your fingers. It’s not 
particularly wide so it makes it a lot 
easier to type one-handed.
A Worthy Adversary
When it comes to picking a 
smartphone for its camera quality, 
the Xperia XZs should be mentioned 
along the top contenders. Taking 
a leaf out of its CyberShot camera 
series, the Xperia XZs comes with 
the Eye Motion camera, capable of 
capturing what the eye normally 
doesn’t. Although it only comes with 
19-megapixels at the rear, it also has 
laser autofocus electronic image 
stabilisation (EIS) and even predictive 
phase detection so you won’t miss 
out on anything ever again.
Slow it Down
One of the two great camera 
features would be the Super Slow-
mo, which slows down your shot to 
960 frames per second. This gives 
you an inside look on your shot and 
how it comes to life. Another would 
be the Predictive Capture, which 
picks up on the movement in front of 
you and snaps up to four images for 
you to choose from in case you were 
to capture it too late. 
Dump it in Water
The Xperia XZs finally 
gets a IP65/68 rating so 
you won’t have to worry 
about water or dust 
affecting the device.
A Smart Smartphone
After using it for a couple of days, the 
Smart Stamina studied my usage and 
crafted a specific battery-saving plan for 
me to accommodate my heavy usage 
without draining the battery.
A Device to Behold
Thanks to the TRILUMINOS display, the 
5.2-inch screen of the Xperia XZs gives 
out rich and vibrant colours while still 
maintaining its consistency.
Xzellancy
at it's best

A Camera For The Streets
Fujifilm X100F
Compose comfortably
The Fujifilm X100F is an upgrade 
to the X100 series, but this is an 
evolutionary upgrade rather than a 
revolutionary. One of the features 
that was carried forward from the 
previous model is the excellent 
hybrid view finder. This viewfinder 
works both as an optical viewfinder 
as well as an electronic one – users 
can switch between the two with a 
simple press of a button. Plus it is 
very comfortable to use too, thanks 
to the rangefinder layout and design.
APS-C goodness
Behind the Fujinon glass is an APS-C 
sensor – the same sensor size that is 
used in DSLRs. You get great image 
quality with a sensor this size, and 
the X-Trans sensor delivers colours 
that pops, with Dynamic range that 
is not achievable with smaller sensor 
sizes. It does mean that the lens 
can’t go into the body, but that is a 
trade-off that we are ok to have in 
regards to sensor quality.
Full Manual Control 
The Fujifilm line of cameras are 
one of the few brands out there 
that puts all of the important 
photography controls as physical 
dials on the body itself. The trend 
continues with the X100F. It shares 
mostly the same controls as the 
other X100 series, but this time 
Fujifilm added the control joystick 
from the larger cameras to the 
X100F. This means that users 
can move around the focus point 
without taking their eyes off from 
the viewfinder. 
Retrospective
The retro design 
bodes well even in the 
21st century

Satisfying clicks
One of the hallmarks of this camera 
is the everything is within reach, and 
everything has a very satisfying click 
to it. The dials click into place with 
every turn, and this in turn makes it 
very enjoyable to use this anywhere 
you have it. The fact that it looks 
like a classic camera adds to the feel 
of using the X100F when you are 
out and about on walkabouts – you 
will feel like you are carrying a film 
camera, not a modern digital one.
Fujifilm colours
One factor of this camera that is 
also enjoyable to own is the X-Trans 
sensor. The colours produced with 
this camera sensor is unlike others 
in the market. It pops out on screen 
– both on the camera and on your 
desktop. Not only that, the focus is 
speedy and accurate that you can 
just bring it up to your face and snap 
away with abandon. It also comes 
with the Fujifilm film simulations so 
that you can apply it to your photos 
before you shoot it.

No Rocket Science
The installation is easy and quick 
– it takes minutes, if that. There’s 
no need for any extra installation 
– connect you LAN and go. Your 
devices on the same connection will 
automatically detect it. The interface 
is easy enough to use – copy, scan, 
fax and print – you don’t need to 
figure out any rocket science to use 
this multifunction printer. It’s a small 
enough machine that can fit on any 
regular sized table. 
Colour clarity
Scanning and copying documents 
is quick, easy and clear. The opera-
tions are simple, no need to set 101 
different settings just to copy or 
scan. It’s all immediately obvious on 
the MFP’s interface. The copy and 
scan quality is clear, with no fuzzy 
edges, all the details are clearly re-
flected on the copies or scans. With 
the copies, it’s nearly indistinguish-
able to which is the original. You’ll 
have to squint really hard. 
No Jam, No Smudge
Print the AGM report, print an IKEA 
catalogue – the printer will still be 
running smoothly. No worries. Sure, 
it’s not the fastest printer, but it 
does a decent job, printing a 130-
page document taking less than 
10 minutes. The colours are quite 
crisp, and does daily documents 
quite well. It’s not going to look like 
our magazine you’re holding, but it 
will look professional enough for a 
business report. There are also no 
issues about ink smudges found in 
many rollers. 
Easy reload
The design of the 
machine means all 
the stuff you need is 
in convenient reach. 
Tray, ports, interface – 
no fumbling needed.
Connect and go 
in minutes
Don’t worry about 
downloading any 
software – it’s already 
all there. Just scan for 
device and print.
Simple interface
No confusing buttons, 
does things as said 
on the tin. Copy? 
There’s a button for 
that. Scan? There’s a 
button for that. Fax? 
You already know the

SHOWDOWN
iving in a country such as Malaysia, it is a fairly arduous task to actually maintain a healthy lifestyle while being constantly 
bombarded with new cafes, restaurants and whatnot popping up all around you. Known as a smorgasbord of cuisines 
blended together to create a harmonious culture coming together for the love of food, it is a task on its own to keep track 
of your own dietary needs and still going after that popular ramly burger.
In this month’s Showdown, we talk about the four distinct types of smart bands that will keep you in track of your diet while still 
giving you enough leeway to have a cheat day occasionally.
TIME TO GET 
PHYSICAL!
Dubbed as the modern-age arm candy, we decide on which smart band is best suited for you.

WeLoop – Now 2
irst up to bat is the WeLoop Now 2 smart band, distributed from Olike 
Malaysia, the official accessories partner with Oppo smartphones. 
Although still fairly new into the market, the WeLoop Now 2 has 
managed to tick all the right boxes, from being a highly affordable smart 
band to even providing great features along with it. Priced at RM199, the Now 
2 is highly affordable for people who aren’t looking to break the bank for a new 
smart band. In terms of pricing alone, the Now 2 would be an instant winner as it 
appeals to the masses, especially with the ever-fluctuating economy that resides 
in Malaysia.
F
The design of the Now 2 is also slightly different compared to the rest of the 
entries we have for today’s Showdown; while most carry a slim body with a slim 
wristband to match, the touchscreen display is larger compared to the rest. This 
proved to be a hit-and-miss as I did quite like its size while plenty of other people I 
knew didn’t really fancy it. Another wonderful thing about the Now 2 is its weight 
– weighing in at only 16 grams, you wouldn’t even notice you have it on you! 
This is great, especially for sleep as it proved to not be a nuisance as I do tend to 
move around a lot in my sleep. The wristband is also another aspect of the design 
that I quite liked as it didn’t itch nor annoy me in any way; on the contrary, it was 
quite comfortable to wear on for days. My only pet peeve with the wristband is 
the difficulty in trying to lock the clasp in place. Lastly, it’s sweatproof, waterproof 
and shatterproof so you don’t have to worry about taking it for a long run, a swim 
or even if you accidentally drop it.
In terms of performance, the Now 2 could do just about anything most smart 
bands can do these days. It managed to track the difference between running 
and slow walking (something I did a lot), how many calories I burned during that 
entire session of walking mixed with a little bit of running, the number of steps I 
took as well as the total distance I travelled. It could also track when I was doing 
sports like futsal although this wasn’t very accurate as it said I only ran 100 odd 
steps in a 10-minute game when I clearly ran way more than that; my panting and 
wheezing were testament to that. The sleep tracker was also a little bit off as it 
showed that I woke up from deep and light sleep zero times when in actual fact, 
I woke up at least twice to use the bathroom – unless of course I was dreaming, 
which I can’t really tell anymore at this point.

Fitbit Alta HR
Fitbit has always been at the forefront when it came to smart band 
technology as its constantly coming up with innovative technologies on 
how to better your lives through its smart bands. The Alta HR is the latest 
introduction to its already formidable lineup of wearable technology, 
which have been steadily growing in popularity over the years. However, the thing 
about Fitbit’s smart bands is its price and the Alta HR is no different as it retails at 
RM730, a rather steep price to pay to want to stay fit. This is exactly why people 
like me will never achieve beast mode status as we must pay through the nose 
for it. Although you do get a host of Fitbit technology that can set you in the right 
direction, paying RM730 for a smart band is pretty absurd to say the least.
F
Design-wise, the Alta HR borrows elements from its previous flagship, the 
Fitbit Charge 2 as it’s an almost carbon copy-like with the Alta HR being much 
slimmer while the Charge 2 was a lot chunkier and big. In typical Fitbit fashion, 
the wristband on the Alta HR in interchangeable, much like its many other smart 
bands. This makes wearing the Alta HR worthwhile for every occasion as you can 
choose between its premium leather band – that comes in three colours – and its 
metallic cuff-like bands. The latter encompasses either its stainless-steel choice 
or you can also opt for the more ostentatious 22k gold-plated band. There are 
also Alta HR special edition bands, which uses the most popular colours of the 
season right now paired with 22k gold, making you look stylish and classy at the 
same time.
However, despite all its quirky accessories that can be paired with the Alta 
HR to go along with its ridiculous price, Fitbit has made it to be one of its most 
consistent smart bands to date. One of its standout features is the PurePulse 
technology – Fitbit’s very own heartrate tracking technology. I’d like to say that 
the PurePulse technology is highly accurate as my heartrate was off the charts 
as I was trying to keep my lungs from bursting out of my chest. Another notable 
feature is Fitbit’s all-new Sleep Stages feature, which will show your sleep time 
in light, deep and REM sleep. This helped me better understand my own quality of 
sleep as I come to realise that I am an unhealthy human being and that’s putting it 
lightly. It also comes with a nifty silent alarm to wake you up based on the number 
of hours you’ve slept and when is the correct time. Through the Fitbit smartphone 
app, you can also curate your very own exercise plan, which the Alta HR will 
ensure you follow every step of the way. Of course, you can always just give up 
halfway and grab that bag of chips that’s been calling out to you for the past hour; 
that’s what I did anyway.

Xiaomi Mi Band 2
lthough first made popular through its market-breaking smartphones, 
Xiaomi has since branched out into developing more than just 
smartphones with the introduction of its Mi Mix, Mi Box and even 
Mi TVs. One such area that Xiaomi touched on is also the smart band 
market with its Mi Band 2. Retailing at RM94, the Mi Band is by far the most 
affordable smart band in this month’s Showdown. For something along this price 
point, you would think the Mi Band 2 can only offer so much but it has more than 
you would think.
A
Much like the Alta HR and the Now 2, the Mi Band 2 features an LCD 
touchscreen display but its silicone strap cannot be changed, unlike the Alta HR. 
When comparing all three smart bands together, the Mi Band 2 is slightly smaller 
but is still large enough to display the statistics like your heart rate, step count and 
the number of calories burnt. However, the display of the Mi Band 2 comes with an 
OLED panel, which promotes itself to be power-efficient so it will last longer without 
draining the battery. The Mi Band 2 is also splash resistant with an IP67 certified 
rating while also being resistant to dust and corrosion.
The Mi Band 2 also supports many features that can be found in the smart 
bands for our Showdown like step count, heart rate and even the time just to name 
a few. It can also track your sleep with statistical analytics to tell you when you’re in 
light and deep sleep. One unique feature about the Mi Band 2 is when paired with 
your Android device, you just have to place the smart band close to the device to 
unlock it without the need for passcodes or fingerprint recognition. Once paired, you 
will also receive message and call notifications.

Misfit Shine 2
art of the Fossil Group, which are famous for its line of watches as 
well, the brand from America known as Misfit came out with the Shine 
2 smart band with a unique twist. Its circular face is a breath of fresh 
air compared to the rest in this month’s Showdown as all share similar 
aesthetics. However, the Misfit does share one trait with other smart bands today 
and that is its price; at RM461.88, the Shine 2 is priced between the Alta HR and 
the Now 2 but still much more expensive compared to the Mi Band 2.
P
The Shine 2 does come with a wide range of colours to choose from and the 
price changes depending on the colour. We got the Rose Tone Misfit Shine 2, 
which shares the same price as the Carbon Black – every other colour is priced 
at RM277.11. One unique feature about the Shine 2 is that there are no hour or 
minute hands on its face; rather, there are 12 LED lights which make up the hours 
of the day and will light up according to the time. The LED lights will also light 
up to show progress reports as well as notifications when connected with your 
device. Another great design aspect of the Shine 2 is that it cannot be charged as 
it comes with a replaceable coin cell battery, capable of lasting up to six months.
The smartphone app that connects the Shine 2 to your device is easy to use 
with easy to set goals as well. While other smart bands require a constant Bluetooth 
connection with the device to record your stats for the day, the Shine 2 doesn’t need 
to stay connected as you can connect it at the end of the day to check on all your 
progress. The Shine 2 is also waterproof so you can take it for a swim to track your 
progress and it can stay with you in the shower as well! Sadly, the Shine 2 doesn’t 
come with a heart rate monitor but it does come with the usual features like step 
count, calories burnt, sleep tracking and your activity level. The face of the Shine 2 
can also be removed if you’re too tired of the same band colour and are looking to 
opt for something a little bit flashier.

CONCLUSION
Choosing between these four smart bands is a task on its own as each has its own 
set of features that are different from one another while still sharing other similar 
features like the usual step count, calories burnt, etc. etc. With that said, if you’re 
looking for a more budget-friendly smart band that can do all of the above while 
still looking stylish, the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is a great choice as you can even 
change the bands to give it a different look or to even match your outfit of the day. 
If you’re not interested in changing its band, you can stick with the WeLoop Now 
2. However, if you’re really interested in making a change in lifestyle and need all 
the help you can get, the Fitbit Alta HR is the partner for you as it’s features are 
second to none but so is its price. Lastly, if you’re looking for something that is 
long-lasting and complementing how you look on a daily basis, the Misfit Shine 2 
is a good choice for you.

The Canon EOS 800D is fighting above its paygrade
Announced in February 2017, the new EOS 800D is a DSLR camera that caters to entry-level users. It comes equipped with the latest image processor, DIGIC 
7, a maximum ISO speed of ISO 25600, 45 AF points in its viewfinder, a continuous shooting speed of up to 6 fps, and compatibility with Bluetooth. Yuki 
Marubashi shares her experience with the new Canon EOS 800D.

Top entry-level DSLR that encapsulates the latest technology
EOS 800D/ EF50mm f/1.8 STM/ FL: 50mm (80mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE (f/3.2, 1/320sec, 
EV±0)/ ISO 400/ WB: Daylight (B1)
EOS 800D/ EF50mm f/1.8 STM/ FL: 50mm (80mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE 
(f/2.5, 1/2,500 sec, EV+0.7)/ ISO 400/ WB: Daylight
I shot my child’s old drawing along 
with shortened crayons that show signs 
of frequent use. In order to portray 
a soft feel, I shot with a little bit of 
backlight, and searched for a suitable 
angle while checking the result on Live 
View, making sure that the drawing 
would not be masked by the reflection 
of light.
The EOS 800D is the latest model to follow in its vastly popular line of DSLR cameras catered to entry-level users. Equipped with the latest image processor, 
DIGIC 7, it features a maximum ISO speed of 25600 to give improved rendering, 45 AF points, a continuous shooting speed of up to 6 fps, and compatibility with 
Bluetooth low energy technology.From the actual shoot, I felt that the usability of the camera has been improved. In particular, the convenience I experienced 
while shooting in Live View is worthy of special mention.Although I highly commend the vari-angle monitor, which is also present on previous models, shooting with 
the monitor extended to the side may result in users wondering if they are shooting at an accurate horizontal level. No fears about that with the EOS 800D, which is newly 
equipped with an electronic level that determines the correct horizontal level, enabling you to shoot with ease. This can also be used when shooting objects on a table, where 
slight variations in the horizontal level can affect the image that you ultimately get.Furthermore, the AF speed also provides an ease of use. With Dual Pixel CMOS AF, focus 
can be established very quickly with just a touch on the monitor.
Placing only an arm through to the 
other side of the fence, I used Live View 
shooting to capture the drooping plum 
flowers. Since this method of holding 
the camera made it unstable, it was 
difficult to prevent camera shake. To 
counter that, on the screen, I touched 
the flower I wanted to focus on, which 
allowed AI Servo AF to track the focus, 
and enabled me to capture the shot.

EOS 800D/ EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM/ FL: 18mm (29mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE (f/6.3, 1/500 sec, EV+0.3)/ ISO 1600/ WB: Daylight
I captured a dynamic shot of the child using a wide-angle of 18mm. Even if the child 
is moving, using [Face + Tracking AF] enables focus to be accurately positioned onto 
the face throughout all frames, without it shifting to the playground bars or onto 
his foot in the front of the picture.
EOS 800D/ EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM/ FL: 88mm (141mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE (f/5.6, 1/800 sec, EV+0.3)/ ISO 400/ WB: Daylight
Shooting at a very low position close to the ground with Live View captures the face 
of the cat clearly and portrays a spacious background. When the cat approached me a 
few moments later, using AI Servo AF in high-speed continuous shooting allowed me 
to capture all of the frames in focus.

EOS 800D/ EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM/ FL: 135mm (216mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE (f/5.6, 
1/25 sec, EV±0)/ ISO 800/ WB: Tungsten light (A9, G8)
I noticed that I had been using Live View for the 
majority of the scenes in this test shoot, including 
those with moving subjects. Using [Face + Tracking 
AF] detects and tracks a face even if there are many 
other elements present in the surroundings. Since 
it is able to maintain its focus onto a face even if 
the person looks down or is partially obscured for 
a moment, I was able to shoot a scene of a child 
playing in a playground with ease. Combining this 
with the ‘high-speed continuous shooting’ drive 
mode setting enables greater shooting success. 
Perhaps this will encourage the use of Live View 
To bring out the dewy atmosphere of 
the forest after rain, I set the white 
balance with an emphasis on blue. 
Since the ‘Tungsten light’ setting 
would make the image appear too blue, I 
corrected the white balance by moving 
it towards the amber/green end. Even 
though I used a shutter speed of 1/25 
sec, which was slower than what I 
would normally use when shooting 
handheld at the telephoto end, the image 
stabilization ensured that there was no 
visible camera shake in the image.
shooting for photographing everyday scenes 
involving children.
Upon testing the camera, I found many features 
which affirm its usability. For example, Creative 
Filter now features as an independent shooting 
mode. This means that even if your camera is set 
to shoot in RAW, you just need to turn the Mode 
Dial to apply a Creative filter effect to the image 
(note that the image will be saved in JPEG). I feel 
that the EOS 800D is a camera that will satisfy 
entry-level users who have a strong desire to 
improve their shooting skill.

Breaking from Brick and Mortar
GIL Malaysia 2017 shares how entrepreneurs of today do what they do and achieving success
lobal markets are being 
disrupted by an accelerating 
pace of innovation in the 
digital world. Digital transformation 
has entered an era of unprecedented 
change for enterprises necessitating 
a fundamental shift across processes, 
functions, 
customer 
engagement 
and many other aspects of business. 
Today, more than ever before, it has 
become imperative for organisations to 
implement concrete strategies around 
digital transformation.
“Digital transformation is deeply 
impacting our businesses and our 
society. The digitisation of data helps 
make things more efficient by saving on 
paperwork, manpower and time, where 
multiple things are now in reach at 
the click of a button. While digitization 
is creating great value for society; 
collaboration 
between 
businesses, 
regulators 
and 
policy-makers 
to 
maximize value for business and wider 
society will be imperative,” says Manoj 
Menon, Senior Partner & Asia Pacific 
Managing Director, Frost & Sullivan.
In its tenth year, Frost & Sullivan’s 
Growth Innovation and Leadership (GIL) 
2017: Malaysia congress addresses 
the continuing the journey to visionary 
innovation, where among its sessions, 
the event hosts a panel discussion 
with some of Malaysia’s up and coming 
entrepreneurs in this digital age, where 
they share their views and experiences.
G
Despite being one of the largest 
eCommerce markets in Southeast Asia, 
Malaysia still has a long way to go 
with its penetration rate only at 1% to 
2% as compared to 7% to 8% in more 
advanced countries.
According 
to 
Jesrina 
Arshad, 
Co-founder and CEO of PurelyB, she 
became an entrepreneur due to her own 
frustration of having to battle health 
issues. As for Goh Chee Hau, Managing 
Director of The Lorry, he co-founded The 
Lorry in 2014, when a digital platform 
for lorry rentals have not existed yet.
To them, being an entrepreneur 
in the digital age means providing 
solutions to the consumers by creating 
or disrupting products and services to 
suit the consumers’ needs.
Easier Said Than Done
It is an exciting time in the Southeast 
Asian region with all the disruptive 
technology rising in entrepreneurship. 
Combined with all the support from 
the 
government 
and 
institutions 
like Malaysian Global Innovation & 
Creativity Centre (MaGIC) and Malaysia 
Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), 
it’s safe to say that we can expect to 
see a lot more innovation coming from 
local SMEs.
However, 
Karl 
Loo, 
CEO 
of 
ServisHero believes that the major 
inhibitor holding entrepreneurs back 
from reaching their full potential is 
the cultural and mind shift change. 
Needless to say, they would need 
the support from the people around 
them to back up the courage it would 
take to do something that is outside 
the norm.
“I think one of the biggest 
challenges is taking the risk going 
down the journey of entrepreneurship 
and breaking the traditional career 
path,” states Loo.
“That’s mostly the case for 
women,” adds Jesrina. “They lack 
the confidence to turn their great 
ideas into reality – but once they 
see the success of other women 
entrepreneurs out there, they will feel 
more empowered to take that step.”
She also mentions the saturation of 
the market today causes people to doubt 
themselves more, making them fear 
failure if their product/services are not 
uniquely interesting enough to be a hit for 
the consumers.
When There’s a Will, There’s a Way
From the words of Joel Tay, Chief 
Business Officer of Soft Space, this 
is the golden age of opportunity. 
Entrepreneurs who come up with 
disruptive technology also have a choice 
to work together with the disrupted to 
create brand new offers – with fintech 
being an example. More and more 
financial institutions are going digital 
and adapting the way they do business 
to improve customer experience.
With all this technology going 
around, it is only natural that there 
should be enough space to cater the 
demand, which calls for more data 
centres to store the information. 
“People rely heavily on technology 
and web services now. As a result, 
there’s going to be a high demand for 
infrastructure to support this digital 
economy,” concludes Loo.

ell EMC introduces their 
Integrated Data Protection 
Appliance (IDPA), a solution 
that ensures data is secure, backed 
up and protected against disasters 
and outages.
IDPA is a purpose built, pre-
integrated and turnkey appliance 
that converges protection storage, 
software, search and analytics in a 
single appliance. By providing data 
protection across a wide ecosystem 
of 
applications 
and 
platforms, 
this removes the complexity in 
setup or management for different 
applications, platforms or data silos.
With expansive coverage for 
physical and virtual workloads across 
multiple hypervisors, the solution 
also offers native cloud-tiering for 
Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance gives you a peace of mind for you data’s safety

D
long-term retention. IDPA comes 
with encryption, fault detection and 
healing capabilities, as well as ability 
to scale. 
Not only can companies deploy data 
protection measures faster using IDPA, it 
also offers the simplicity of a single user 
interface for typical daily operations.
IDPA will be available in four 
different models (DP5300, DP5800, 
DP8300, and DP8800) for customers in 
SMB and enterprise alike. Starting at 
34 terabytes usable capacity at entry 
level, the family scales up to 1 petabyte 
usable capacity at the high end. 
Dell EMC is also rolling out new 
capabilities to its cloud data protection 
portfolio to enable customers to simply 
and effectively protect and back up 
their data anywhere, anytime. 
With the release of Data 
Domain Virtual Edition (DD VE) 
3.1, organisations can gain the 
performance, 
efficiency, 
and 
reliability of Data Domain in the 
cloud. DD VE enables back up of 
both 
traditional 
and 
emerging 
workloads in Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) and Microsoft Azure and 
efficient replication to, from and 
within the cloud. Additionally, the 
Data Protection Suite can perform 
monitoring and reporting of these 
backups in the cloud. 
Data Domain paired with Data 
Protection Suite can now provide 
low-cost disaster recovery to the 
cloud by enabling organisations 
to extend protection of their on-
premises environments to AWS S3. 
Data is sent securely and efficiently, 
requiring minimal compute cycles 
and footprint within AWS. 
In the event of a disaster, VM 
images can be restored and run 
from within AWS. Since neither 
Data Protection Suite nor Data 
Domain are required in the cloud, 
compute cycles are only required 
in the event of a restore, bringing 
more cost savings to users.   
Dell

Integrated 
Data

now and will be generally available 
in the summer of 2017.

ot Gadgets is no stranger in the local 
IT market, as they have been the name 
behind the push of the JBL brand here 
in Malaysia. Now they have brought 
in two new brands – BLU and E-blue. 
One of it is a smartphone brand, while the other 
is a gaming peripherals brand. We talked to Ng 
Yew Choong, Sales and Marketing Director of Hot 
Gadgets to talk about the company, and what are 
their plans in the Malaysia.
Congratulations on the launch of the brands 
BLU and E-Blue in Malaysia. First of all, can 
you share with us a brief background on Hot 
Gadgets?
The company actually started in 2013 as a fulfilment 
company, supporting other distributors in Malaysia. 
But after 2014, we decided to change our focus 
from fulfilment to become the sole distributor for 
IT products. We also then started to be the sole 
distributor for Harman Kardon AKG from then 
onwards. We started with four employees, and as 
of last year, we have over 30 employees covering all 
our distributor business. 
The BLU brand is popular in the United States 
as an affordable brand that is marketed 
exclusively through Amazon. What was the 
reason this brand was chosen to be marketed 
in Malaysia by Hot Gadgets?
The BLU brand is well known in USA, and the 
Greater America continent. We would like to have 
the same experience and exposure of the brand 
to the Southeast Asia market. We have been 
appointed as the sole distributor for the brand for 
this region, and we are starting the distribution 
in Malaysia in the beginning. Hot Gadgets will 
be heading to Vietnam next to distribute BLU in 
that country. We also found that the pricing and 
marketing strategy of the BLU brand fits Southeast 
Asia right now.
With a selection of phones catering to 
different segment, what was the selection 
criteria to market certain models here?
Basically, we selected only 10 out of the more than 
50 models available in their catalogue. We also 
want to bring consumers better quality products 
for their choice, which is also backed by a two-
year warranty for every unit. We don’t think any 
other brands out there offer warranty that long for 
products at this price point. We are targeting the 
mid-tier market rather than the high-end market. 
The reaction to the brand has been good thus far, 
and we will be turning M-Mart to be the first BLU 
touch-and-try corner for the brand.
E-Blue is a very interesting gaming brand, 
with a wide range of products under its 
wing. As per the question for BLU, what is the 
reason Hot Gadgets chose this brand to bring 
into Malaysia?
If you talk about the brand, we are bringing almost 
everything in the catalogue. The only thing we are 
not bringing in is the Iron Man branded products. 
We are waiting for updates from our principal on 
this matter as they want to market this line globally.
Is Hot Gadgets bringing in the full range of 
products from the E-Blue range? 
E-blue is already a good performer for our offline 
market. We are getting good reaction for the market, 
especially for our tables and chair surprisingly. Our 
dealers are getting high volume enquires on the 
E-blue products, so we are forecasting that the 
brand will be one of our best performer for the year.
What can we expect from Hot Gadgets in 
the next few months in term of branding, 
marketing and new products?
We are looking to do more branding and product 
exposure to more people around Malaysia. Not 
only we want to strengthen JBL’s position here 
in Malaysia, we also want to push both BLU 
and E-blue to the Malaysian mass market. In 
September, we will be doing the first JBL Fun Run 
2017, which you can check out on our Facebook 
page. It is the first JBL-branded run event in the 
world, and we have representatives coming from 
the principal company, Harman. 
We also would like to retrofit a corner of the 
M-Mart to be a showcase of our brands as well 
– for JBL, BLU and E-blue products. We expect to 
have this happen sometime around the start of the 
third quarter.

he Malaysian mobile service 
market is highly competitive 
and price sensitive. in a country of 
31 million people, industry witnessed 
subscriber penetration to plateau 
around 140%, with 44.3 million 
mobile subscribers at the end of 2016. 
with 
declining 
traditional 
voice revenues and increasing 
competitive play, the focus has 
moved to the mobile data services. 
To support the business growth 
from digital services and deliver 
enhanced 
customer 
experience, 
Malaysia CSPs accelerated their 
4G network rollout (88% of the 
population) and modernized their 
existing infrastructure. 
During the CY2016, the Celcom 
and Maxis observed consolidation 
in terms of their subscribers and 
cumulatively they lost 2.5 Mn users. 
On the other hand, U Mobile, Digi and 
top 3 MvnOs - TuneTalk, XoX and 
Redone, showcased strong customer 
momentum based on their strong 
value propositions and aggressive 
marketing, and added 2.5 Mn 
subscribers that saw industry register 
58k subscriber net-addition.
To 
attract 
new 
customers 
and retain existing ones, CSPs 
offered affordable device-bundling 
campaigns and introduced attractive 
data propositions with generous 
quotas. CSPs also fortified their 
digital services portfolio to deliver 
a superior customer experience 
and effectively monetized the data 
opportunity. These campaigns helped 
drive the smartphone penetration to 
67% and mobile data penetration to 
70% of the subscriber.
As 
a 
result, 
average 
data 
consumption per user almost doubled. 
non-voice revenues grew by 9.2%

and contributed 47% of the total 
mobile service revenues. However, 
the growth of the digital service 
segment was not enough to contain 
the 11% decline in voice revenues, 
and overall mobile service revenues 
declined by 1.4%. Despite all 
the market challenges, Service 
providers were able to sustain their 
profit margins through better cost 
control measures.
2017 Q1 performance
Amidst the intense competition, 
Maxis performance was relatively 
stable as compared to Digi. it 
witnessed 1% mobile subscriber 
net-attrition during the quarter and 
registered a 2.5% decline in the 
total revenues, yet it maintained 
its profitability. Digi lost 0.5 Mn 
customers and reported revenues 
decline of almost RM 100 million, 
primarily from its price-sensitive 
prepaid segment. However, it was 
able to lower its operating expense 
and because of lower taxes, its PAT 
margin improved by 1pp to 24%. 
The Malaysian mobile services 
industry is expected to bottom-out over 
the next few quarters and CSPs will 
stabilize. The next phase of growth for 
the industry will come on the back of 
higher adoption of digital services and 
new business opportunities from the 
enterprise segment. 
New leadership at TM
early 
this 
month, 
Datuk 
Seri 
Mohammed Shazalli Ramly joined 
Telekom Malaysia as its new MD 
and Group CeO. Datuk Sahzalli, is 
highly appreciated for delivering 
32 consecutive growth quarters 
at Celcom through his business 
acumen and innovative strategies. 
The appointment is being viewed as a 
progression towards the re-merger of TM 
and Axiata Group amidst the challenging 
scenarios in the overall telecom industry. 
within a few days in his new job, 
Datuk Shazalli announced some key 
appointments at the top management 
in TM & its subsidiaries. All these 
appointments are in-house talents that 
are promoted to take the leadership roles 
and are expected to play an instrumental 
role in the transformational journey of the 
service provider. 
webe’s 
new 
CeO 
– 
Moharmustaqeem, 
who 
has 
a 
decade long experience working 
with one of the leading mobile SPs 
in the country along with Datuk 
Shazalli are anticipated to change 
the business fortunes for one 
of the smallest mobile service 
providers in the country. Since 
the P1 acquisition, the industry 
expected TM to introduce quad-
play services after completing the 
business integration, which did not 
happen. So now, under the aegis 
of these two able leaders and 
new management, it will be quite 
noteworthy to see if webe is able 
to leverage TM’s 2.4 million home-
broadband subscriber base across 
the nation as part of TM Group’s 
convergence strategy, and if TM 
will emerge as a fully converged 
service provider?

fter slogging through hours of Dark Souls III, only to die over and over and 
over again, I made a vow to never put my sanity through that experience 
ever again. However, all that diminished when Nioh was released. 
Through it’s Dark Souls-inspired combat mechanics (which includes ridiculous 
mechanics of making death inevitable), Nioh taught me a valuable lesson. No, it 
doesn’t involve patience or peace; Nioh taught me to never get sucked into the 
hype of newly-launched games, even if it will be worthwhile experience because 
my heart, sanity and dignity cannot take losing to AI-controlled enemies anymore.

he Premise
Set in the year 1600 during a 
fictionalised dark fantasy version of 
the Sengoku period in Japan where 
the clans were at war with each other prior to 
the unification under the Tokugawa shogunate 
and right before the Edo period, Nioh takes 
you on a whirldwind adventure through the 
control of William, the main protagonist (one 
of the reasons I wanted to do the review for 
my namesake). Looking like a grimmer version 
of Geralt from Witcher 3, Nioh is your typical 
hack-and-slash game, much like the Dark Souls 
series and Bloodbourne where you will have 
to systematically plan your battles before it 
happens as your enemies will lay waste to you 
if you don’t (a mistake I should’ve encountered 
much sooner).
Be warned: Nioh is unforgiving and 
merciless as it will sense blood in the water 
the moment you display any signs of weakness, 
much like the girl I used to sort of date.
Kicking Things Off
Right off the bat, I must say that Nioh has a 
horrendously slow start, which is great for first-
timers as it gives you a chance to familiarise 
yourself with the game and its mechanics as 
well as find the right fighting style for you. 
This slow start is also great as it gives you 
the chance to witness your death again and 
again as you curse yourself, your TV, your PS4, 
your neighbours and probably your neighbour’s 
annoying children to oblivion (I’m not saying I 
did that).
I discovered that my fighting style is highly 
primitive – charge forward and no looking 
back. Little did I realise that that is the worst 
kind of fighting style and you should not follow 
suit. After dying for the umpteenth time and 
losing all my gold and Amrita (the game’s 
T
106
JUNE  2017
experience points), I finally caved and placed 
my controller down – no I didn’t fling it at the 
TV – and went out to clear my head. Once that 
was all over, I restarted the game only to see 
myself die and die again at the hands of two 
heavily-armoured knights; oh, what joy.
The strategy to Nioh is timing and being 
able to keep your Ki stamina bar healthy while 
still dishing out attacks, which eats at your 
stamina. I know that sounds like a double-
negative but with practise (I mean a lot of 
practise), you will be able to lay waste to 
both human enemies as well as supernatural 
beings.
Throughout the course of the game, you will 
be able to pick up a variety of weapons, which 
include polearms, broadswords, axes and a 
wide range of other swords. This will in turn, 
deplete your Ki stamina, depending on which 
weapon you’re using. If it’s an axe or polearm, 
it will deal more damage in a single hit but eat 
up more Ki while swords will deal less damage 
but in turn deplete less Ki. Nioh is all about 
finding the right balance between maintaining 
your Ki, avoiding enemy attacks – which also 
takes up Ki – and dishing out enough damage 
to them.
Shrines Are the Best/Worst
Much like the bonfires scattered around Dark 
Souls, Nioh follows a similar approach with its 
Shrines, where you can exchange all the EXP 
you’ve gained and turn them into levels, which 
will increase your stats and such. Shrines also 
act as a safe haven for you as it will count as a 
checkpoint in the game so if you ever die (you 
will… a lot), the respawn point will be at the 
last used shrine.
However, do note that once you activate a 
shrine, it will reset the enemies in the area. 
This will mean that you will have to cross 
through waves of them, again, much to my 
dismay.
If You’ve Prevailed
Along the way, William will be able to summon 
Guardian Spirits, which are animals that will 
aid you in battle by combining both your health 
and stamina into a single bar. This will give 
you added stat boosts like increased attack 
damage or defense. Each Guardian provides 
different stat boosts and can only be switched 
out when using Shrines so be sure you have 
the right Guardians for the right situation. In 
more than one occasion, I’ve actually forgotten 
that I have Guardians Spirits or maybe my ego 
just got the better of me thinking that I could 
actually defeat my enemies without any help. 
Believe me when I say this – Guardian Spirits 
are crucial, especially when you’re fighting for 
your life.
Sadly, Guardian Spirits will be lost when 
you die. Fret not, you can get them back again 
when using Shrines but at the cost of your lost 
EXP so it will come down to decisive planning 
as to whether you’re willing to forgo a huge 
chunk of your EXP just to stay alive.
I Failed to Understand
The key thing about Nioh – much like Dark 
Souls and Bloodbourne – is that dying is a 
part of the game. If you can’t handle losing 
(like how I can’t handle rejection due to my 
on-going issues), Nioh is not the game for you. 
Also, if you’re the type of gamer to rage, you 
might want to invest in additional controllers, 
TVs, window panes, etc. etc. as this game 
will make you want to flip your table over and 
swing a sledgehammer over your PS4. Trust 
me, I’ve had that feeling more than once.
But, if you can look past all this, Nioh 
is actually a pretty decent game with a

ith the days of apocalyptic wasteland while living in destitute being a recurring theme in movies, books and even video 
games, one can’t help but wonder what it would be like to live in times like these. For obvious reasons, I would want to avoid 
anything that is Mad Max- related as I just can’t see myself spraying chrome on my mouth while reciting lines of Valhalla 
and shouting, “WITNESS ME!” Unless of course you throw in Rosie Huntington-Whitley into the fray then we have a deal.
However, I digress; I wouldn’t mind being put in a somewhat similar situation, minus the whole ‘eating-scorpions-to-survive-while-
running-from-crazy-idiots-on-motorbikes’ thing. For those who aren’t familiar, Fallout is one of the more popular post-apocalyptic video 
game series with over seven game titles spanning from PS 2 to PS4. Fallout Shelter borrows elements from previous game but the main 
element is the Vault Shelter, which you will be the Overseer of.

eeping Things Tidy
First off, Fallout Shelter reminds me of 
Sims with the stark difference being you 
can’t outright kill your Vault Dwellers 
(believe me, I tried). There is a way to kill them but 
it takes a lot of time and sanity, both of which I don’t 
have much of. The game starts you off with a basic 
tutorial on how to build, maintain and manage your 
Vault Shelter as you expand it with more and more 
Dwellers making their way to you.
In order to keep your Vault Shelter from 
crumbling, you will have to assess each and every 
Dweller on its stats called SPECIAL – which stands 
for Stamina, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, 
Intelligence, Agility and Luck. By assessing their 
stats, you can then place each Dweller at different 
locations in your Vault like the Diner, the Power 
Generator or the Water Treatment room. These guys 
are the backbone of your Vault as they will work to 
keep it up and running, which in turn will keep your 
Food, Water and Power bar above the threshold. If 
it were to fall below, you will get updates from Pip-
Boy.
Started From The Bottom, Now We Here
Fallout Shelter initially began as a mobile spinoff 
game to the Fallout series on the console. It has 
since been made available through Steam as well 
for free. Much like its mobile version counterpart, 
Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play game but with 
annoying consequences. Each room has a timer to 
when it will replenish your food, water and supply 
bars and just like any other mobile game, it will 
make you wait. To get rid of the long timers and 
processes – you will have to pay real cash instead 
of using the Rush ability, which will get the job done 
quicker. While that is all fine and dandy, there will 
be a possibility of the job failing, which will most 
likely result in fire or a Radroach infestation. This 
will then cancel out all the work your Dwellers have 
done in that time.
Keeping You Entertained
Just as an added titbit because I thought this 
was pretty hilarious – if you put a male and female 
Dweller in the same living quarters, they will 
eventually begin to take a liking to each other. At 
which time, they will fall in love and consummate 
that love. What I love about the control of time 
with Fallout Shelter is that it takes on average two 
to three minutes to replenish the food, water and 
supply bar but it takes less than a minute for a man 
to impregnate a woman.
You can also send your Dwellers out into the 
Wasteland to gather supplies, Caps (the in-game 
currency) as well as gaining EXP while battling the 
deformed foes which you probably will never meet 
unless they come barging through your Vault.
It Needs More
Sadly, the novelty of Fallout Shelter wears off pretty 
fast as it lacks a lot of depth as well as any sort 
of narrative storyline. The use of microtransactions 
are also a big turn off as the idea of having to pay 
to play seems utterly ridiculous as where is the fun 
and joy in that. Lastly, Fallout Shelter lacks any sort 
of ending, which leads me to believe that you will 
be working your Dwellers to the bitter end until they 
grow old and die, which is when their children will 
take over their jobs. This reminds me of the third-
world countries where generations of a family tree 
end up working in the same factory.
I’m basically running a totalitarianism. Oh good 
God; this is where my reign of terror begins.

which puts you as the owner of your own gaming 
company where you will have to come out up

hen I was a kid and having recently just got my first ever gaming console (it was a PS1), I always had a dream of working at a gaming 
development and publishing company like Square Enix because of how its game made me feel as a child growing up (Final Fantasy VII changed 
my life). Sadly, as I grew older, those dreams stayed just that – dreams. Also, reality caught up with me after doing some research on what it 
takes to create a video game and I said to myself, “yeah, I’m definitely not cut out for that.”

genres like Adventure, Action, Puzzles and the 
likes and mix it with which platform you’d like 
the game to be played on, the type of game 
you’ll be developing and the direction of how you 
want the game to turn out. Game Dev Story also 
follows along a similar route to how video games 
in real life work with developers and publishers 
as there will be announcements of new gaming 
consoles. You will then be able to buy the license 
of said new game consoles and produce games 
for them, thus increasing your fan base.
During the alpha and beta stages of the 
game, you will need to choose from your list of 
employees on who would be better equipped to 
work on the sound and graphics for the game. 
You are also given choice of being able to hire 
freelancers to do the work for you instead of your 
employees. Trust me, sometimes it’s better to get 
freelances as your employees can be a bit… how 
do I put this gently – stupid. Why I say that is 
because during the production of the game, your 
employee will come up to you say they want to 
try and boost the game’s production, whether 
it’s through graphics, sound, it’s fun factor or 
creativity. On more than one occasion, they have 
failed me miserably. When they fail (which they 
will!), it will also increase the chances of the 
game getting more bugs than there already are.
Bugs Are Good!
Which leads me to my next point; if your game 
is under development and gets hit with tons of 
buggy codes, that could also be a good thing as 
you will gain more Research Data points from 
debugging them. The points can then be used to 
train or level up your employees, decreasing the 
chances they will screw up on the job. 
Another note to take away from Game Dev 
Story is that time moves really fast. When you’re 
in-between creating new games, there are also 
contract jobs you can take up to earn some fast 
cash like coming up with ringtones, creating 
game scenarios or even designing some new 
characters. However, when you’re busy with 
Contract jobs, you won’t be able to develop new 
games and once your fans realise that you’ve 
gone quiet, they will start to lose interest in 
you so it’s best to maintain a healthy balance 
between doing Contract jobs to earn cash and 
maintaining your fan base by creating new and 
exciting games.
What to Take Away from This
Game Dev Story is pretty fun and honestly quite 
interesting and you work your way around your 
company trying to create new games that will 
not only boost sales but also your profits and 
even your fanbase. Although this version is the 
free one because I am too stingy to actually 
spend RM10.99 on the full version, I am actually 
quite tempted into paying for the full version of 
the game. With that being said, if you want a 
mobile game that you just won’t be able to put

ow do you fancy a computer 
that is as pricy as a mid-
sized sedan? That is what 
the new Acer Predator 21 X 
is, and it is now available in Malaysia 
for an eye-watering RM 39,999. The 
laptop is part of Acer’s a five-day 
roadshow. The Predator 21 X is the 
world’s first laptop to offer a curved 
21-inch IPS display (2560 x 1080 
resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate) 
that is taking Acer’s Predator brand 
position in gaming to a new level with 
its showcase of advanced technology 
and never-before seen innovation.
Acer Sales & Services Sdn Bhd 
General Manager of Products, Sales 
and Marketing, Chan Weng Hong 
said, “The Predator 21 X along 
with Acer’s wide range of gaming 
devices reinforces our commitment 
to premium gaming with discerning 
enthusiasts around the world in mind.

The Predator 21 X is Acer’s flagship 
gaming laptop and is advanced 
beyond anything available in the 
market today.”
Bruce Howe, General Manager, 
Microsoft Consumer and Devices 
Sales, Microsoft Malaysia added, “On 
behalf of Microsoft, I congratulate 
Acer on the launch of the world’s first 
curved screen laptop. We are proud 
and excited to collaborate with Acer 
to deliver a modern device powered 
by Windows 10. At Microsoft, our aim 
is to enhance the user’s experience 
and with this in mind, the device is 
packed with amazing built-in features 
like Windows Ink, Paint 3D, enhanced 
gaming features and Windows Hello 
that enables users to login in to their 
devices securely.  Also designed 
to provide the most complete 3D 
experience, Windows 10 is the best 
gaming platform for users today.”

Underneath that monstrosity that 
is the Predator 21 X are components 
that can rival even the best desktop 
computers available out there. At the 
heart of the machine is an Intel Core 
i7 processor, what is overclockable 
by the end user to get more out of 
their gaming experience. It has not 
one but two NVIDIA GTX 1080 in SLi 
to deliver unmatched graphics to the 
gamer. Talking about graphics, the 
1080p, 21:9 screen on the Predator 21 
X is curved, the only machine in the 
market that is designed to feature a 
curved screen. This wider size also 
gives games a wider view angle for 
the gamers to immerse themselves 
in the world they are playing in.

“You can identify 
enemies, aim, and 
take cover simply by 
gazing at objects on 
the screen.”
Of course if that is not enough, up 
to three additional screens can be 
connected to the 21 X, as well as 
3D goggles for the true immersive 
gaming experience. 
To enhance immersion even 
further to the next level, the laptop 
also integrates Tobi eye-tracking 
technology. The eye tracker consists 
of illuminators and cameras that 
complement keyboards, mice and 
gamepads as an input method for 
a new gaming experience. You can 
identify enemies, aim, and take 
cover simply by gazing at objects on 
the screen.
For 
gaming 
controls, 
the 
Predator 21 X comes with a 
full-sized keyboard with a full 
complement of Chery MX Brown 
switches, to give the best tactile 
experience while typing or gaming 
on the machine. The keys are full 
RGB and can be customised by 
using Acer’s own software. Cooling 
down the machine is up to the five 
fans that Acer has installed into the 
Predator 21 X. 
A lucky person will be able 
to purchase this limited unit as 
there will be only one available in 
Malaysia, for the price of RM 39,999.

Red Bull Coliseum is back for Season 2 with an even 
bigger prize pool!
fter the conclusion of the Red Bull 
Coliseum last year, which saw a prize 
pool of RM50,000 and three dominant 
eSports titles, Red Bull Coliseum is 
back for Season 2 with an even bigger prize 
pool of RM100,000 and two new game titles, 
FIFA Online 3 as well as Blizzard’s very own 
Overwatch. These two games will join the 
already stable roster of games – Dota 2, CS:GO 
and FIFA 17.
Having attracted over 1,100 players during 
its debut season, Season 2 is looking to increase 
that to over 5,500 players this time around in a 
total of five different countries around Southeast 
Asia, which will include Malaysia, Thailand, 
Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.  It 
a
will be looking for 512 teams (2,560 players) for 
Dota 2, 256 teams (1,280 players) for CS:GO, 512 
players for both FIFA 17 and FIFA Online 3 as 
well as 32 teams (192) for Overwatch. There will 
of course be regional qualifiers held in all five 
countries while the main event will be held in an 
undisclosed location in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
With a major eSports event of this scale, 
Red Bull Malaysia will not be pulling it off on 
its own as it has brought along various other 
official partners. MSI will be the Official Laptop 
Partner of the event while Logitech is the Official 
Peripherals Partner during the event and Digi is 
the Official Streaming Partner. Air Asia is also 
the Official Travel Partner while both Garena and 
Gamesbond are the Official Industry Partners.

ota 2 is a game that is 
ever-changing 
and 
is 
constantly evolving along 
with the gameplay meta that changes 
whenever there is a patch update. 
This time round, the game receives a 
relatively huge patch update, dubbed 
patch 7.06 and along with it, brings the 
inevitable nerf/buff hammer for plenty 
of the previous meta-favourite heroes.
The biggest change that has 
received plenty of traction since the 
patch’s release is the replacement 
of Respawn Talents on no less than 
42 heroes in the game. Talents were 
introduced during the game-shifting 
patch known as patch 7.00, which saw 
the game receiving a total makeover 
alongside plenty of other updates 
and changes. Talents were a fresh

Valve’s Dota 2 receives a major patch update dubbed 7.06
introduction into the game as it requires 
each hero to dedicate a total of four skill 
points at levels 10, 15, 20 and 25, which 
provided some much-needed diversity 
and versatility into the game. While 
most talents were simple upgrades 
like added physical damage, movement 
speed, armour or even granting lifesteal 
and spell damage amplification to name 
a few, one of the biggest Talents would 
be reducing the death timer on certain 
heroes with that Talent listed in its Skill 
Tree. Mostly reserved for supports, this 
provided a notable change into the 
gameplay meta as a reduced death 
timer on heroes would allow a team to 
bounce back into the game, even if they 
lost all five heroes.
Although 
most 
heroes 
that 
received the Talent change were 
acceptable like Enigma receiving 
an additional Malefice Instance, 
Bristleback 
gaining 
10% 
Spell 
Lifesteal and Earthshaker receiving 
an additional 350 range on Fissure, 
some of the Talent change were 
downright ludicrous. For example, 
in place of Furion’s Respawn Talent, 
it is now a ‘Remove Teleportation 
Cooldown’ Talent instead, making 
it insanely difficult to gank Furion or 
even split-push other lanes safely. 
Warlock’s Respawn Talent change is 
also ridiculous as it can now Summon 
another Golem upon death, making 
the grand total of two Golems or even 
three if Warlock has the Aghanim’s 
Scepter upgrade.
Other noteworthy Respawn Talent 
changes includes Techies additional 
250 Attack Damage, which turns 
Techies from being a nuisance to a 
downright pain in the behind to deal 
with. Aside from Techies, Magnus 
also gains an additional 500 Skewer 
range, Jakiro’s Macropyre now deals 
Pure damage and Pierces Immunity 
and Io’s Tether provides a Stun.
Plenty of heroes also received 
reworks on their Aghanim’s Scepter 
upgrades but the most notable one’s 
would be to Dazzle and Medusa. For 
Dazzle’s case, its Aghanim’s Scepter 
upgrade used to increase the Area of 
Effect (AoE) to its Ultimate – Weave 
as well as the duration. It has now 
been changed for its life-saving 
ability, Shallow Grave from being a 
single-target skill to an AoE skill. This 
gives Dazzle the potential to save all

four teammates and thus, turning 
the tides of a teamfight with one 
skill. Medusa’s Aghanim’s Scepter 
upgrade pays tribute to her ultimate, 
Stone Gaze, which turns enemies to 
stone if they’re looking at her. With 
the upgrade, Medusa’s Mystic Snake 
can now turn enemy heroes into 
stone as well for one second. The 
stun duration is then increased by 0.2 
seconds per bounce with a total of 
six jumps at Level 4, making the stun 
duration to be a total of 2.2 seconds.
Other updates and reworks to the 
game includes the usage of Shrines, 
which are now locked until after 
five minutes into the game, making 
it that much harder for midlaners 
to win their lane based on damage 
output alone. Creep denies also give 
30% experience points (XP) bounty 
to the denying team and there is an 
added melee creep in the mid lane 
for the first 15 minutes and creeps 
meet a bit closer towards the offlane 
towers. Neutrals were also not 
spared as it goes back to its original 
spawn time of one minute instead 
of two but it now gives 20% less XP 
and gold.
Roshan also now drops Cheese 
on its second death rather than the 
third, placing him in much higher 
importance than before; Buyback 
cooldown has been increased from 
seven to eight minutes; Uphill miss-
chance no longer applies to flying 
units (Batrider using Firefly) and of 
course, Illusion building damage 
reduced from 50% to 60%.

ridgestone just created a new wheel 
concept for bicycle tyres that will 
eliminate the need for riders to head to 
the nearest air pump. 
The “Air Free Concept” is a 
technology that eliminates the need for tires to 
be inflated with air to support the weight, using 
a unique structure of spokes stretching along the 
inner sides of tires. In addition, the resins that are 
used in the spokes and rubbers help realize more 
efficient use of resources.
Your next bicycle tyre may just be the new 
design from Bridgestone, as it eliminates the need 
to pump your bike, and is flexible enough that 
we may just see new bicycle designs in the near 
future. Plus, it is very futuristic looking as well!
